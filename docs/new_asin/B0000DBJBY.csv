8000405,4,B0000DBJBY,Another great story of gall force.,1478044800,,34,4.833333333333333
8000406,4,B0000DBJBY,I really have to disagree with the last review-he (or she as the case may be) sounds like an embittered troll. I enjoyed Earth Chapter but it doesn't have a great deal of rewatchability for me. It is part of the Gall Force series and needs to be watched for it all the make sense. On a scale of 1 to 10 I'd rate it at 7.,1349395200,,320,3.791044776119403
8000407,5,B0000DBJBY,"These OVA continue the story line of RHEA Gall Force, and Mach as well with the end of the first trilogy of gall force (don't try to look at it as a forced sequel or a reincarnation of characters. They just take some stuff of the old story to build a new one)

It's not the typical fight between the good guys and the bad guys, story have good arguments, and the fact that both sides are playing all out.
Character designs are great, not less than expected from Kenichi Sonoda en el trazo. characters have motivations, fears, wishes, make mistakes, they are not the stereotypical super hero without fear.

Mecha designs is very good (I really like the tank design) and are just that, Mecha. Story doesn't go around the Mecha.

in some parts I wish the animation where better

In resume
Story Line---------------Excellent
Character design--------Excellent
Mecha design-----------Excellent
Animation---------------could be better
Music-------------------does not mach with the action

After these chapter comes another one called Gall Force New era, these one IS the chapter that worth nothing",1333497600,,1091,5.141242937853107
8000408,5,B0000DBJBY,Having this set filled in a gap in my collection and made the whole set make more sense. The only complain I had is the price was a bit steep but well worth it.,1320278400,,160,3.735294117647059
8000409,1,B0000DBJBY,"Gall force earth chapter, is pure mind numbing ""crap"", the aniamation is not as good as the others,hell every thing in this ova sucks, by the end you will want to put a loaded gun to your head. all the other ""gall force"" ova are excellent!. forget this one or burn in anime hell.",1284249600,,279,4.185185185185185
