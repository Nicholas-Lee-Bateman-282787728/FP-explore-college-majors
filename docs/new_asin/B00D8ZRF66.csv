5778893,4,B00D8ZRF66,"this is of coarse a very..very..very inexpensive copy of the series compared to the other dvd editon..
video qualitity is so/so..for a dvd..actually the picture is a bit grainy and digitalish..audio is subpar but nothing a little eq can't fix
but on the other hand, the series itself is absolutely PHENOMINAL and a true classic! and this is well worth it for the subtitles being that my spanish is not that great..I purchased this in the event that a blu ray or better quality version won't be released with subs..

a few minor but insignificant scratches in the dvd's themselves..noticeable but haven't had any trouble with the dvd's playing smoothley...I'm satisfied with the purchase",1392163200,,686,5.017543859649122
5778894,2,B00D8ZRF66,"Pro - It has English Subtitles if you need them

Cons - No Spanish Subtitles, poor sound, edited.

I watched this series on Caracol and really enjoyed it. I bought this set because it was cheaper than the $90 boxed set and am disappointed. The series is re-edited and is not exactly what was broadcast. Many scenes were deleted and episodes are edited together.

Sound is very poor on some of the episodes, others the video is not the highest quality.

I'm not saying this set is pirated, but it is of the same quality",1383609600,,518,4.421052631578948
5778895,5,B00D8ZRF66,"Good quality of the product and very interesting serie about a part of the history of Colombia and the links and fight  against the trafic of drugs, policy, Government and civil society.",1382745600,,186,4.8125
5778896,1,B00D8ZRF66,"I want to be very clear that I'm not giving this product a bad review because of the series itself. ""El Patrn del Mal"" is an AWESOME series that deserves to be seen everywhere. It's well done, well acted, and very entertaining.

The reason why I'm giving this product a one star rating (And I wrote the same on the Volume 1 section) is because the quality of the DVD's is staggeringly bad. I bought three box sets of this series and ALL of them came scratched and with some unplayable episodes. I bought ALL of them brand new, with cellophane wrapper and everything. Never been used, yet they were all scratched. I bought Volume 1 first, obviously, and had to return it. I got the exchanged copies and had the same problem. I also ordered, from a different seller, Volume 2 and, yet again, it came scratched.

If you're going to watch them on your computer, it might be okay. But if you plan to watch them on your TV, I recommend you stay away from this box set. It's a damn shame too because it's affordable and the episodes look great (when you can see them).",1379030400,9,1061,4.353535353535354
5778897,5,B00D8ZRF66,"A five disc collection with 5 episodes per disc, the second part of this 3-part collection (part 3 will be out in a couple of weeks), now features different images for each episode selection in the menu, as opposed to the same picture we got for each episode in the set containing the first part, so now it's easier to figure out where you left off. The episodes, however, still have no chapter stops, so the only way of advancing is by using the fast forward button on your remote control. The English subtitles are still a condensation of the actual dialog, but for those who don't speak any Spanish, they're enough to know what's going on. As is, this is still the cheapest option for getting the whole series, even if it's divided into three sets, each costing around $12.99 (the Colombian made version containing all 15 DVD's costs over $80, and has no subtitles, English or otherwise).

That said, my only quibbles are with the music, that sounds cheap and cheesy and seems to have been recorded with a cheap Casio keyboard. Hell, even using GarageBand they could have created better music than the one heard here. It sounds like elevator music, cheapening the whole project, although you can see that they put much money into it. Another problem is how they recorded the sound. They attached tie clip microphones onto the bodies of every character, and since most of the series was shot outdoors and with various cameras shooting simultaneously, it meant they wouldn't get a boom mic in the way of any camera view. However, the whole thing was recorded at full volume, meaning you also get every rustle of the clothing, squeaking of the furniture, wind blowing, insects buzzing, and crickets chirping along with the characters speaking, sometimes all at the same time. And since it was all recorded at full blast (hell, this must be the loudest DVD I've ever heard), whenever a character screams or yells, the sound gets distorted. This isn't a mistake on the DVD, but rather on how the whole sound was recorded.

As is, this set contains one of the highlights in Escobar's colorful life, mainly the one where he orders his killers to gun down a presidential candidate (and most probable future president), just to show the government the reach of his power. But this will also be the beginning of his downfall, as his brother-in-law tells him. Again, what makes this series so harrowing, is that it's all based on fact, even if the names of various characters have been changed.

Highly recommended, and can't wait for the third part to come out!",1375056000,,2554,4.721973094170403
5778918,5,B00D8ZRF66,"Carefully thought out and brilliantly executed, this tells the true story of Pablo Escobar. Even though it is presented as ""fiction"", and has its own bias, the only fictional parts seem to be 1. change of names and nicknames for some of the historical figures; 2. invention of dialogue for continuity (even the dialogue is in keeping with the characters presented); and maybe a few scenes added to fill out the series, but then, even those are in character.
If you view this series, you will have quite a good idea of Pablo Escobar and his methods, the internal history of Colombia during the '80's and early '90's, and an understanding of its impact on the U.S.",1450828800,,662,4.666666666666667
5778919,1,B00D8ZRF66,It was sent to me in a broken box. The actual video was of poor quality and didn't work.,1450483200,,88,3.6842105263157894
5778920,3,B00D8ZRF66,"This is the International release. It is not the Columbian release.

They cut it from 113 episodes to 74.

So much is missing. Things seem to appear out of nowhere without explanation and there are many plot holes because of this.

Other than that, still a great series. Better than NARCOS by a longshot!

The plastic that holds the DVD's in place is cheap and breaks super easy.",1449964800,,379,4.529411764705882
