2439414,5,B000BRO4YA,"I don't care that the video quality isn't perfect, I'm not a snob, it was filmed in 1981! It's 1981 quality! The sound through my home theater speakers is excellent and the performances were spot on. The vocals and harmonies sound killer! This DVD rocks!",1296518400,,254,4.666666666666667
2439415,3,B000BRO4YA,"Love LRB! So much fantastic talent. However, who in their right mind thinks that interviews and backstage chats should be mixed in with concert footage? I was completely flabbergasted when towards the end of the first song, ""It's a Long Way There"", the concert fades off to showing them on their bus?!... WTF! You can still barely hear in the background the concert continuing with an incredibly awesome guitar riff but then that eventually fades completely away and we're left with them chatting. Now EVERYTIME I watch the DVD, I have to watch all the non-concert footage too. You have no idea how I'd love to personally talk to the editor and tell them how idiotic they are!

I give the band 5 stars. I give the film editor a one-finger salute.",1289433600,11,746,4.651515151515151
2439416,4,B000BRO4YA,"Audio is NOT 5.1 digital. However, it suggests setting your receiver to SIMULATE 5.1. On my Yamaha receiver, set on Pro Logic Enhanced, it indeed sounded very good and used all 5.1 speakers. Video is not up to today's standards but the sound of the music was very good and much like the studio versions.  Worth buying at a decent price.",1284508800,,336,4.508196721311475
2439417,5,B000BRO4YA,"Great DVD that showcases the talent of LRB. Great selection of songs coupled with outstanding audio and video
This is a keeper. If you are an LRB fan and want to see them at their peak with original members, this is the one.",1265760000,9,224,4.232558139534884
2439418,5,B000BRO4YA,"This is a concert DVD of the LRB in concert in October 1981.  Between each song is a brief video segment of members of the band interviewing each other, doing in-studio radio interviews and promos, doing pre-show vocal harmony warm-ups, or some other backstage footage.  Song, video footage, song, video footage, song, video footage, etc.

This isn't the original line-up of the band (there are 2 relatively new members at the time) but it may be considered the ""classic"" line-up.  When I saw the LRB back in the late nineties, the 2 ""new"" members from this show were the only members still in the band.  Everyone else was gone.  But enough moaning.

There is an interesting typesetting goof on the DVD back cover and the insert page.  The set list includes the songs ""It's Not a Wonder"" and ""Lady"", but they are folded together as one song title by mistake.  They are listed as ""It's Not a Wonder Lady"" not once but twice.  It wasn't until I watched the video and heard the separate songs (and read the correct credits at the end) that I learned there is no such song as ""It's Not a Wonder Lady"".  Just as well, too.  I had no idea what a ""Wonder Lady"" could be.  It's not a ""Wonder Lady"" (pardon the pun).

Total running time is about 75 minutes and almost a third of that is non-concert footage.  But the show itself is good and it's nice to hear the LRB again.  The cameramen or director or editor apparently didn't care too much about ""equal time"" considerations.  The keyboard player barely gets a second or two of screen time.  If it weren't for the off-stage footage you wouldn't even know what he looks like.

The concert was from nearly 30 years ago and it shows in the video quality.  Very grainy.  But that wasn't unheard of at the time.  Those of us of a certain age are used to video footage like that.  It used to be the norm.  It doesn't bother me one bit, though it may not be a big hit with folks who are only used to (or simply demand) pristine digital video.",1252800000,5,1978,4.3856749311294765
2439419,4,B000BRO4YA,"This was, IMO, LRB's best line-up of musicians with bassist / vocalist Wayne Nelson in the mix with the original members. (Interestingly, Nelson would obtain the rights to use the LRB band name in recent years, playing without any of the original band members!) The concert music and songs presented are excellent and the video demonstrates the great talent this band had. With that said, I would not rate this a 5-star video as the production quality of the concert's taping and its transfer to DVD are not the best and resulted in a grainy video. Also, I wound have preferred to see  the concert footage separated from the side material (interviews, rehearsals, road travel), but instead the latter is presented during the concert songs. In spite of these drawbacks, I do recommend this DVD to LRB fans.",1252800000,15,805,4.833333333333333
2439420,5,B000BRO4YA,"I am very happy that we finally have a look and listen at the real Little River Band.
The band touring today may as well be a tribute band because there is not one original member!
This is the real deal the way they were meant to be seen and heard. Buy this DVD!",1250294400,9,262,3.8703703703703702
2439421,4,B000BRO4YA,"The little river band came from Australia and its members where from well know Australian bands. This DVD shows the band at its prime in Texas, includes interviews and there great hits. Its suprising the DVD is not released on Capital? A great DVD -John",1248220800,4,253,4.644444444444445
2439422,5,B000BRO4YA,"The ""Time Exposure"" tour of 1981 was beyond description.  I saw this band at the Greek Theater (LA) in September of 1981 (10 days before the video in Houston was shot) and it was absolutely THE BEST, and I mean THE BEST live show I've ever seen.  Yes, the original band was about to break up, but ""magical"" is the only way I can describe the show at the Greek....Glenn Shorrock on vocals, Wayne Nelson on bass, etc.  The band was never better and Austrailian music never prouder. Gosh I love these guys.",1155772800,5,503,4.387096774193548

2439424,3,B000BRO4YA,Pretty much the original LRB on this version.,1424649600,,45,4.75

2439426,3,B000BRO4YA,I was expecting more of a concert feel but the concert quality wasn't great and there was a ton of random footage spliced in that was a bit...awkward.,1408492800,,150,4.392857142857143
2439427,4,B000BRO4YA,One of my favorite bands.,1407024000,,25,4.2

2439429,1,B000BRO4YA,Many of the songs are interrupted by commentary from the band. I wouldn't waste your time or money on this.,1393891200,2,107,4.4
2439430,1,B000BRO4YA,was very boaring poor sound to much talking n not enough music so personall i do not recomend this dvd,1392595200,2,102,4.15
2439431,5,B000BRO4YA,I have attended 5 live Little River Band shows. This DVD was as good as any of the shows I witnessed. It is my opinion that this DVD shows that the players in LRB understand the importance of harmony as much as the Eagles. I have watched this DVD countless times since I purchased it. No disappointment at all.,1380844800,3,310,4.271186440677966
2439432,2,B000BRO4YA,"I bought this DVD specifically to see and hear ""Long Way There"" performed LIVE. It turns out the song was merely an audio backdrop for a promotional video of the band in Texas. Very disappointing.",1376524800,4,196,4.628571428571429
2439433,5,B000BRO4YA,"Long time fans of this band will remember their development on the US charts, starting slowly and then sweeping the country, seemingly everywhere all at once.  This video captures the band at the height of ""LRBmania"", if there was such a thing.  This is full throttle, head on, in your face Little River Band doing what they do and doing it oh-so-well.

The video quality isn't the crystal clear high-def picture we have grown accustomed to in this digital age, but this DVD still looks and sounds great.  The 5.1 audio track will fill your room with the most wonderful of songs and without an alternative to this video, this is as good as it is going to get.  Fans, by and large, won't be disappointed.",1366588800,4,703,4.5476190476190474
2439434,4,B000BRO4YA,This live concert makes you feel you are in the crowed rocken with them.  For those who love the old rock n roll. Never get tired of them.,1364256000,,138,3.9285714285714284

I have sung these songs all my life (at school-1978-1983, in a band ... and solo in Japan bars while in the Air Force (Yokota Air Base-2001)...  If you are a Little River Band fan, the grainy-ness of this video will NOT AFFECT YOU !!!  All the songs are there !!!  And the silly interviews between songs really won't matter---  It's GREAT !!! And the price--- You CAN'T BEAT IT !!!!",1360281600,2,446,4.261904761904762

2439438,2,B000BRO4YA,The little River Band is one of my all time favorites. Unfortunately this disc is of low quality sound and even lower quality video. Too bad...great concert content and even my high-end DVD can't overcome the poor quality.,1323388800,2,222,4.868421052631579
2439439,5,B000BRO4YA,"This DVD represents LRB just the way you remember....on fire!  Just the right mix of rock, with a little bit of jazz fusion on a few songs.  Opening with a It's a Long Way There sets the tone with new member Stephen Housdon ripping on guitar.  The lone American, Wayne Nelson, plays funky bass throughout, especially on Happy Anniversary. Glenn Shorrock's vocal are spot on, and has you singing along on Reminiscing and Cool Change.  It has all the classics, and is a must own for any real LRB fan.  Make a night out of it, and enjoy.",1323216000,3,534,4.408163265306122
2439440,4,B000BRO4YA,"I listen to LRB before I can play guitar. I started playing back in 1993, then guitar solos are starting to make sense.  It's good to see this guys on DVD, it's a keeper!",1314921600,,170,4.0

8091666,5,B000BRO4YA,Loved it all. I just wished they didn't cut the front of some songs and let the concert go threw its entirety. But I will take what I can get. The Band deserves that.,1509667200,,166,3.911764705882353
8091667,2,B000BRO4YA,"Great concert but very poor video quality. VHS at best. Plus they tried to get cute and add video affects to some of the songs that were most of the time distracting. ""The Night Owls"" was basically unwatchable. I'd give the video 5 out of 10 and audio 8 of 10. Over priced, if you ask me.",1494460800,,288,4.0701754385964914

8091669,4,B000BRO4YA,"Great to have vintage LRB video footage! Features lineup at their commercial (and perhaps creative) peak. Those disappointed by songs being interrupted by interviews (resulting in lack of complete video performances) have hopefully by now found the holy grail of Little Rive Band footage in the form of DVD by BSG (Birtles, Shorrock and Goble), the founding members of LRB who reunited in early 2000's. This (""Live in Texas"" DVD is good, but BSG is GREAT!",1472947200,,455,5.0
8091670,5,B000BRO4YA,Saw this show at the Greek Theatre in LA in 81 when Poco opened for LRB. This band blew me away. Best vocal band ever.,1470960000,,118,3.76

8091672,5,B000BRO4YA,"Great band, filmed with most of the original members, at the height of their popularity. Sadly, the original band members lost the rights to the name ""Little River Band"" so the current version bears no resemblance to the originals here...so it's great to have a video of that band here.",1461974400,,286,4.74
8091673,4,B000BRO4YA,Produced in 1981 in a documentary style while on tour in texas with the groups original lead singer. This was 2 years prior to the HBO special in australia (my favorite) with the new lead singer. Lots of interesting info about the group members and all the liitle river band standards. Only negative was that the quality of the images on the dvd was somewhat lacking,1446681600,,366,4.5606060606060606
8091674,3,B000BRO4YA,"The DVD is great music, however the quality of the DVD production is very poor. It looked like it may have been dubbed too many times.",1437868800,,134,4.1923076923076925
