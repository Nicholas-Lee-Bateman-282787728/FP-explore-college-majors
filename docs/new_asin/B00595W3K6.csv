4620357,1,B00595W3K6,"The acting was so bad that I found myself repeating the words after the characters just because it was funny.  The movie wanted to be dramatic, but was more melodramatic.  Lots of pointlessly violent murders, including the only halfway likable person.  The writing was abysmal -- for instance, the main woman argues with people over something several times by repeating the same words over and over.  It wasn't even bad in a way that could be funny.  And I really love these movies and books with these kind of ideas, so I was particularly disappointed.",1363219200,4,553,4.778947368421052
4620358,3,B00595W3K6,"The Echo Game is the feature length debut from writer/director Brian Feeney. It's a paranormal thriller that revolves around ESP and a murderous plot to obtain these powers. Starring Alisha Seaton as April Reilly. A woman whose life is thrown into peril when she receives a letter from her former lover, Rachel, who supposed died 10 years earlier. April's daughter Sarah, played by Melissa Lee, starts having psychic visions of the now truly deceased Rachel (Angela Landis). These visions and powers put Sarah on the radar of Rachel's killers lead by Anne Cassavettes (Judy Clement). Anne wants Sarah's powers and will stop at nothing to get them.

The film is wonderfully shot with nice attention paid to color and mood. Feeney creates a great atmosphere here. The pacing keeps the viewer engaged, building nicely, flowing from intrigue into action. My only is gripe is that the end felt a bit rushed. I would have like to have seen more between Sarah and Anne. More psychic cat and mouse as it were. Very strong performances from Alisha Seaton, and Melissa Lee keep the believability intacted when a few of the other performances were a tad stilted. A strong script and well developed characters also builds the believability. These are characters you end up caring about and pulling for. The story of the ""Echo"" project is something I want to know more about. It would have been neat to see it in flashbacks. Or maybe a prequel? A creepy upstate boarding school for psychic kids, hmm...

This is not a slasher flick, however there are some very nice bloody FX. The two that really pop in my mind are the knife thru the hand and one thru the back of the head. Also in the gore department, this film has a well done baseball bat beating. Always good fun. I thought it was a fun and nice touch that April's current girlfriend Casey, played skillfully by Jeannie Bolet, works at an FX company called ""Gore Girls"". I was also very happy to see that most of the FX were done practically. Practicality always lends itself to a heightened since of believability, when done right, and this film dose it right. There is on scene in particular when Sarah is in the hospital and is talking with a spirit. It's a tight shot on Sarah's eye and you can see the reflection of the spirit inside. This is something many would just do in post, but not here. It's done right then and it plays off very well.

Another aspect I must mention here is the music. The score of The Echo Game is one of it's stars. It creates an atmosphere all on it's own and strengthens Feeney's great visual feel. Ranging from happy and comforting to eerie and tense. Composer Austin Wintory shows a great talent here. I look forward to hearing more from him.

The Echo Game is a fun ride with a strong story and a good core cast. Brian Feeney has shown that he can do a full length feature and do it well. He has a great eye for shot placement and color. He is also a very adept story teller. I hope to see more from him soon. Sarah says in the film ""Don't play the echo game."" I disagree I say do play The Echo Game.

4620359,5,B00595W3K6,What a great indie horror movie!!! I highly recommend it. Alisha Seaton was fabulous as well as the rest of the cast. Looking forward to more movies from the talented Brian Feeney and Psychic Bunny Productions.,1322006400,2,210,4.861111111111111
4620360,3,B00595W3K6,"I've seen a few articles on horror sites about this movie, so I knew it was shot on a shoestring, but it's damn impressive work when you take that into account.

The flick's got a retro vibe, definitely similar to older horror movies than modern tortureporn - but the kills are AWESOME. One of the actors is a little uneven but the two leads and the girl are excellent and the music is seriously seriously good. October in our house means we watch a ton of horror movies and probably five or more the night we carve elaborate pumpkins. Saw this bookended by ""Jennifer's Body"" and ""Jack Brooks, Monster Slayer"" and of the three this was hands-down the most intriguing and the only one worth the time to write a review.

It's worth checking out if you're a horror buff, especially of the low-budget variety.",1319068800,4,805,4.544827586206897
4620361,4,B00595W3K6,"The Echo Game boasts a surprisingly skilled child actor and puts an interesting new twist on a subject that most are familiar with. You may be thinking, `ESP? Really, more?' but don't let the glowing eyes fool you. This film will take you on a psychological journey that will even trip up your local psychiatrist. If you love gore, suspense and a healthy bit of mystery, this film is for you. Woo!",1319068800,3,397,4.527777777777778
4620362,1,B00595W3K6,"Giveaways to cheap:
All lead actors have as their acting experience a lot of video shorts and a few TV series. Acting was like, well, acting - read a line, cut. Move to the next location, read a line, cut. The story was a redux of dozens of others where someone is trying to gather kids and enhance their ESP only to have it all get go wrong and now the ESP kids have to be found. Eventually one of the ESP offspring has more than was expected and out-ESPs the bad person.

Giveaways to low budget:
Filmed in a minimum of inside locations. No subtitles. Cheap Halloween fake props e.g. the neck prosthesis was way too big, thick and obvious for the subsequent fake blood and knife wound. Cheap Photoshop overlay of blue light covering the eye iris to represent ESP. Really bad '70s level CGI of the baddest person getting roasted at the end - a brief scene as CGI flames toast the head into a skull. Laughable ghostly studio audio coming from who knows or cares where. Confusing story with editing that jumped around from scene to scene. The background story consisted of bits and pieces such as a news clipping, a letter and a few downloadable Goog docs. The ending did nothing for the story - ESP girl and mom hug each other.",1317772800,2,1227,4.405286343612334
