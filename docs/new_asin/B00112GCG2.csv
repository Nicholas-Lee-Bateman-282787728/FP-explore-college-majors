8239969,5,B00112GCG2,"Dickensian tale of deception on the high seas! The video quality is fair considering when it was filmed and it has a rousing soundtrack. Some characters are dubbed better than others, but none of it really detracts from the enjoyment of the series.",1466812800,,248,4.790697674418604
8239970,5,B00112GCG2,"""Jack Holborn"" is a German production made in 1982.

BUYER BEWARE:
This disc has German dialogue only and I would emphasize the fact
that there is no English dialogue on the disc and there are no
sub-titles whatsoever.

As Long John Silver exclaimed in the Disney movie version of
""Treasure Island"" - ""Oh for ten toes!""
I would exclaim here - ""Oh for an English version!""
(dialogue or sub-titles).

Here we have an excellent television mini-series but cannot
understand a word being spoken.

The technical information provided by Amazon clearly states
German audio but unfortunately no mention is made of the fact
that there are no sub-titles and as most foreign discs do have
sub-titles, I assumed that this one also did.  It only goes to
prove that you cannot assume anything.  If there are no
sub-titles on a foreigh disc you would expect the technical
information to say so, after all English is the predominant
language spoken in this country.

However, I did decide to retain the disc and just looking
at it I can vaguely see what it is all about and it looks
terrific.

This is an intelligent, no nonsense, adventure in the grand
tradition of yesteryear.  It is a real life situation and the
type of entertainment where we cry out for more but nobody
listens.  It has been replaced by high-tech movies which
contain extreme violence and exaggerated action scenes which
are humanly impossible.  Such movies are plain nonsense and
provide entertainment mainly for the thrill seekers.

Jack Holborn is a 13 year old orphan in the 1800's who wants
to get a job on a sailing ship to avoid foster homes.  So he
sneaks aboard the ""Charming Molly"" where he becomes a deckhand.
He does not realize until later that the ship is involved in
piracy.

So the journey begins, a journey that is packed with adventure
and excitement both on the sea and in foreign countries.

Jack, who was found abandoned as a baby, is plagued by strange
dreams and questions which remain unanswered.  In the end,
Jack will find the answers but the road there is long and
difficult.

Patrick Bach plays the role of Jack Holborn with profound
sensitivity and understanding.  He is Jack Holborn as you
would imagine him to be.

This is a brilliant and fascinating mini-series on 3 discs.
It is presented in 4 parts with extras.

If you are prepared to accept this disc set and the limitations
that it has, then it may make your day.",1337212800,2,2405,4.680952380952381
8239971,5,B00112GCG2,I saw this mini-series in 1987 when I was living in England and it was one of the best shows I ever watched. I really am hoping it is released on DVD when they say it will be. I'm keeping my fingers crossed.,1203897600,,207,3.8372093023255816
