8326653,5,B001NFNFIA,"""Body in Numbers"" is a really interesting, informative, and innovative dvd. It strives to inform its viewers about the workings of the human body, by utilizing number amounts of everyday objects as comparisons. It relates specific information on many various parts and stages of our bodies...but at the same time, it manages to capture/maintain your interest while doing so. Because of this, it appeals to both young adults and older adults...it is actually enjoyable! In many ways, it seems somewhat similar to the ""Eyewitness"" science videos...except that this dvd is obviously targeted at more mature audiences. In fact, I plan on showing portions of it to my Living Environment high school classes...it's great to find a dvd that will enable students to enjoy, while also learning. I highly recommend it to anyone who has an interest in learning about how and why our bodies function the way they do. You'll be astonished, and amazed by what you learn!",1285372800,4,956,5.056962025316456
