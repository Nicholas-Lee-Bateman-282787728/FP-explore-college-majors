8246757,3,B0012LWHAC,"I had this dvd previously and loved the different segments that focused specifically on your upper abs, lower abs, and then obliques. This dvd is not that one, it has level 1, level 2, & level 3 of varies exercises but does not specifically categorize the different abs which I really liked though maybe it was time for change because these new exercises on here were great!",1297382400,,374,4.597014925373134

8246760,2,B0012LWHAC,"The commercial was great- I was hoping for something that I'd get hooked on the way I did with Tae Bo back in the day. No such luck.  The ball doesn't even come with a pump- as a result I can't even get it to be fully inflated.  And if you have questions or want them to stop sending you ""risk free"" items to review, you can join me in calling their customer service line and not having them pick up (it's been 20 minutes and counting. I'm leaving it on speakerphone just out of curiosity).

Just do your situps and stop whining.",1203465600,17,529,4.116504854368932
