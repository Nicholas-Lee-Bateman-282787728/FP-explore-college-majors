Barry's boot camp is something you can to do in the house, that seems like its not much at all, then when you see someone who knows you, say what are you doing to trim down, you know its working.  All I can say is keep at it, and I never made it to the full work out I always did the modification work out, so I can only imagine, the difference if I could do the exact work outs Barry does.",1524614400,,449,3.7157894736842105
8375774,5,B002O13J60,Had to replace the upper body workout of my set after a few years/me not taking care of the DVD.  The workout plan works if you stick with it but its very intense on the knees.,1408924800,,176,3.888888888888889
8375775,5,B002O13J60,"i totally love this DVD, i have been lookin for something like this, it has moderate intensity, looks like you doing nothing but actaully working. Because i just wanted to tighten my boobs :-) , lose the back fat and get slimmer back and arms....and trully in 1wk i saw difference already, of cos i wear my sauna suit after rubbing the sweat cream in 20minutes i am sweating like i never did before and my husband even commented on my boobs that they feel tighter and firmer...lol. He like it.",1376265600,,493,4.428571428571429
8375776,5,B002O13J60,"This workout is part of the Barry's Bootcamp Complete Workout System. It requires a fitness ball and resistance bands.

The Fat Blaster is the basic workout. This is a twenty-one minute program (fourteen one-minute exercises) with three additional minutes of warm-up on the front end and three minutes of stretching on the back end. With the complete set, you're supposed to go back and forth each day between the Fat Blaster Blue (lower body) and the Fat Blaster Red (upper body). Both workouts alternate between strength-building exercises and cardio-oriented, heart rate-boosting exercises.

There are also six supplementary Mission Specialist routines: Abs, Upper, and Lower, each in Beginner and Advanced. These are each twelve-minute, eight-exercise programs focused on toning a particular area; the advanced ones feature more strenuous exercises and faster reps of basic exercises, and are often stacked to hit the same muscle group repeatedly. All six Mission Specialists routines are on both Fat Blaster DVDs, so you never have to change discs in the middle of a workout.

This is a fantastic workout, but it works better if you get the Barry's Bootcamp Complete Workout System and get the whole shebang.",1324252800,10,1213,5.307291666666667
8375777,5,B002O13J60,"I recommend Barry's Bootcamp to anyone who wants to get into shape really fast. This one, along with the other videos and the transformer ball and resistance bands all work very well! There's the upper body emphasis and the lower body one, so you can choose which parts of your body to work out.

I do want to warn you that you should have a big bottle of cold water nearby, and eat about an hour before working out, because you'll need the fuel but don't want to have just eaten because you won't want to work out (or maybe that's just me lol).

Very intense workouts, very tiring, but very worth it!",1303862400,5,601,4.3097345132743365
