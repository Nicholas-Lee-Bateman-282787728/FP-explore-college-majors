5681420,5,B00BY0EBDC,"The W.C. Fields Comedy Favorites Collection DVD set is a must have for all fans of America's Grandest Comedian, W.C. Fields.  All ten films have been previously released, by Universal, on DVD in two DVD sets, know as Volume One and Volume Two.  The big difference with this new release is affordability.  Volumes One and Two retailed for approximately $50. each retail and now you can own all ten films for approximately $15.  If you have enjoyed a W.C. Fields film on television or at the movies you have to purchase this DVD set.  And even if you own the original two volumes of the W.C. Fields Collection you should purchase the new W.C. Fields Comedy Favorites Collection, as it makes a great set makes a great gift for future fans of W.C. Fields or to make it easier to travel with your favorite W.C. Fields on DVD.

Even thought I am starting to sell off some of my vast W.C. Fields memorabilia collection, I purchased this new DVD set. I hope is that this set sells well and that Universal decides to release the remaining, never before officially released, films of W.C. Fields on a ""Volume Three"" set in the future.

5681421,5,B00BY0EBDC,"Universal's budget-friendly DVD set combines both volumes of the ""W.C. Fields Comedy Collection""  minus the surviving theatrical trailers. Once again, the sole bonus feature is a 1965 Canadian TV documentary with highlights from ""If I Had a Million,"" ""Six of a Kind"" and ""Mississippi."" Three generous discs of 100-proof Fields in excellent quality.",1371427200,20,348,5.566037735849057
5681422,5,B00BY0EBDC,"It's amazing to think of the diversity of great, iconic comedians working in Hollywood at the same time during the 1930's: Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd, The Marx Brothers, Laurel and Hardy, Mae West, The Three Stooges, The Little Rascals... Certainly among this elite group is the inimitable W.C. Fields, who was, and still is, truly one of a kind with his particular brand of comedy.

This definitive DVD collection includes the lion's share of Fields' work in feature films: INTERNATIONAL HOUSE (1933), IT'S A GIFT (1934), YOU'RE TELLING ME (1934), THE OLD FASHIONED WAY (1934), MAN ON THE FLYING TRAPEZE (1935), POPPY (1936), YOU CAN'T CHEAT AN HONEST MAN (1939), MY LITTLE CHICKADEE (1940), THE BANK DICK (1940), and NEVER GIVE A SUCKER AN EVEN BREAK (1941). Spread over three single-sided discs, all the films look and sound really nice, and come with optional subtitles but no chapter menus. The single bonus feature is a vintage documentary, ""Wayne and Shuster Take an Affectionate Look at W.C. Fields"".

It's great to have all these classics in one compact, very affordable volume which, along with Criterion's edition of Fields' sublime shorts, make up some of the most timeless comedies ever made.

Highly recommended.",1370304000,153,1244,5.1182266009852215

All 10 titles are the same as what were on the two 5-film sets previously released.  Also, these 10 movies are all crammed onto 3 discs, meaning they will likely be double-sided - a common practice of Universal Studios.",1369872000,14,489,4.4222222222222225

5681438,5,B00BY0EBDC,"You already know the legend and the legacy of laughter. Other reviews have given the individual rundown on the actual films. So please allow me to add to the praise of this 10 movie ""W.C. Fields Comedy Favorites Collection"" (which has combined 2 earlier ""5 movie"" sets into 1 set, providing even more value/convenience for your entertainment/enjoyment). Presumably struck from vault prints (they are all look like they were filmed yesterday), these all also have subtitle options.

I can remember a time when local network stations would have these films programmed via syndication so that you could happen upon them while on summer vacation. They were formative to my (then young) sense of humor, and I'm happy to report that they have not lost their impact on my funny-bone (and in some instances possibly gained more momentum through the ages).

I cannot give a higher recommendation to this collection. If it does not make you laugh, or if you find the humor ""dated"", then I have deep sympathy for you and hope that you strongly consider consulting a doctor for what ails you.

One of the best byproducts of revisiting these films created by the great Mr. Fields is that although he gets pickled (and often), you don't necessarily have to, so that you can clearly enjoy his antics and remember them in the morning. I had also forgotten how heartwarming some of his portrayals of the common man were. Sure, sure, times have changed, but it's been my observation that without heart, there is not a lot of hope.

Those who know of these films will know that which I speak of; those who don't should buy this pronto if it sounds like this collection belongs in your life. Special praise to the hard-working staff at Amazon who delivered this priceless package to me without a hitch, enlightening (and possibly even saving) my life in the process - thank you!!!",1503360000,2,1860,4.785046728971962

5681442,4,B00BY0EBDC,"When I was a wee lad, on rainy days after school was ""The Early Show"" on TV... all older movies. The WC Fields movies were almost as funny as the Stooges shorts, & Godzilla or alien movies were kind of scary. Fast forward to today. The humor is all new & different, filled with word play that went right over a 6 yr. old's head as well as some pretty funny story lines & stunts. I'm enjoying these films all over again.

The picture & sound are as good as the originals. There were often running vertical lines on movies of the time. The short Canadian made bio on disc 3 is pretty interesting too.

For some reason we get to see the Universal Pictures globe intro, not once but, twice before each movie.",1499040000,,704,4.246268656716418

5681459,5,B00BY0EBDC,"Let the fun begin !  If you're longtime fan of W.C. Fields, or, a new convert to his inimitable style of humour, you'll enjoy this, truly ""Cream of the Crop"" set of DVD's that package together TEN of his most-memorable Classics !

One of the best things about this set is that it runs in Chronological Order, starting with the legendary, large, star-studded cast ""International House"" (1933), to his last starring role in ""Never Give A Sucker An Even Break"" (1941)...a daffy, wild, disjointed, purely fun romp.

I won't list all of the films here, that's been done elsewhere.  My personal favorites are ""International House"", the hilarious ""It's A Gift"", and, probably his best-remembered classic ""The Bank Dick"".  BUT, one  of his most-sincere & funny gifts to us all, is ""You're Telling Me !"" (1934), in which he plays an Inventor whose inventions never work right.

""Your Telling Me !""  stars the beautiful Adrienne Ames, and I won't spoil it for you, but there's a truly touching scene in which Fields thinks that Ames character is going to commit suicide (which she isn't), and tries to talk her out of it.  In this segment, Fields shows a sincere, sweet, side of himself...one of the only times he's done that in a comedy, and it's one of the best performances.

Do yourself a favor, buy this set while it's still available !  You won't be disappointed !!",1459382400,4,1361,4.72457627118644

""International House"" is a real surprise: Some pre-code naughty references combined with talent like Bela Lugosi in a non-horror role along with comedians George Burns & Gracie Allen.
""The Bank Dick"" has pre-Stooge Shemp Howard in what I think is Fields best movie.

5681481,5,B00BY0EBDC,"I love this collection of movies.  If Fields didn't invent ""Funny"", he certainly improved on it.  In the days of movie censors, how did he get away with so many risque double entendres?  For example, the name of the cafe in The Bank Dick.  Many cafes back then were named the Black Cat Cafe.  But in this movie, it is the Black Pussy Cat.  Then notice how, in some scenes, Fields skillfully manages to allow only the first two words of the name to appear.

Seriously, in most of the movies in this collection you need to pay close attention to every line, every word, or you will miss something.  Hard to pick a favorite, but the later ones, The Bank Dick, My Little Chickadee, and You Can't Cheat an Honest Man are gems.

The Canadian Broadcasting Company's Wayne & Shuster program includes funny clips from other Fields movies that are not in this collection.

But It just breaks my heart that Fields movies have plummeted to such low cost reissues.

I like the low price, but that just indicates the lack of interest in them, sadly so.

I have the non USA 17 film collection and it is wonderful with many more movies included, but in USA you need a region free player for it.

I can not think of anything comparable in films today, from the black and white style to the  Vaudeville shtick and pacing. The films in length are closer to the TV sitcom, but far better written than most.

5681539,5,B00BY0EBDC,"I don't know which of these excellent films is my favorite.  All I can say is this collection is a bargain.  Thing about them is, you almost have to watch all of them three or four times to get all of what he's doing.  For example, in ""It's a gift"", there is a long scene on the back porch that grows on you the more often you see it.  This poor man, put upon by everybody, including his wife and daughter, is just trying to get a little sleep - - - amazing what can go wrong.  But you have to let him tell his story in his own inimical way.  Then it's funny!  You won't regret spending the money to buy this absolutely first class DVD.  Universal did a great job with this.  Great comedy has pathos as well.  Watch the end of ""The Old Fashioned Way"" as he says goodbye to his daughter, it'll tear your heart out.",1381276800,18,813,4.025
5681540,5,B00BY0EBDC,"I think it's great that Universal issued these same 10 films at more affordable prices.  Otherwise, if anyone expects Universal to actually put something out that they haven't already, then they need a reality check.  Universal hasn't released anything NEW in classics titles on pressed discs for YEARS*.  Unless another company were to license titles from Universal (as TMC did with MILLION DOLLAR LEGS) or they release them on DVD-R (TILLIE & GUS now on a Universal Vault Series release), we're unlikely to see the remaining titles released in this country.

In the U.K. there is a very good box set at an affordable price (about $35) that includes all of the Universal-owned Fields titles except for MRS. WIGGS and ALICE IN WONDERLAND.  It includes 17 titles over 10 discs with great transfers/mastering.  Although Fields only has a guest shot, the complete FOLLOW THE BOYS World War II variety film is included.  It's sad when another country values U.S. film heritage more than we do!!

5681541,5,B00BY0EBDC,Very nice collection of ten films that all rate in the 7/10 range in IMDB. Nice example of 1930s comedies with an additional documentary by Wayne and Shuster. Pick it up now at Walmart for 9.99,1377129600,,193,4.388888888888889
5681542,4,B00BY0EBDC,"The ten films found in this DVD collection were previously released by Universal in two fairly expensive DVD box sets of five films each. Instead of only allowing one movie per disc as seen with the two earlier releases, Universal has opted to either put three or four movies onto each of the three discs found in this collection. Since these particular movies tend to only run about sixty to seventy-five minutes each, putting multiple movies onto each DVD does not present any technical problems to the audio/visual quality of the films. The transfer quality of the films is very good (so good in fact that I wish that Universal would have gone the extra step and presented these films on blu-ray). Even though I already own the two previously released W.C. Fields collections, I have actually purchased two copies of this budget reissue - one for myself as a ""back-up"" copy and another that I plan to give as a gift next Christmas. Given how inexpensive this set is, you have no excuse if you're a fan of the Great Man and yet lack DVD copies of these movies. The only reason why I am giving this release four stars instead of five is that I am disappointed that Universal did not make this a comprehensive W.C. Fields collection by including all of the Fields movies they own on it. Granted, some (not all though) of the Fields movies not included in this set have been included in other collections. Even still, it would have been very nice to have them all collected in one set(and it's not as if Universal has never released the same movie in different collections - e.g. ""My Little Chickadee"" in both W.C. Fields and Mae West DVD collections and ""We're Not Dressing"" in both Bing Crosby and Carole Lombard DVD collections). Universal, if you're listening, please release the rest of your W.C. Fields movies in a follow-up collection. The films in that collection should include:
1. Million Dollars Legs (1932): available in a TCM DVD collection of Universal rarities. Also available as a standalone DVD-r movie on demand release.
2. If I Had a Million (1932): this movie has not been available on home video in North America since the DiscoVision laserdisc days of the late 1970s. This film is comprised of various segments dealing with how certain people react to getting a million dollars. Most of the W.C. Fields segment is included on the Wayne and Shuster tribute to Fields that is included on this DVD set, but it would be nice to have the entire movie.
3. Alice in Wonderland (1933): probably one of the most bizarre movies to have come out of 1930s Hollywood. This movie is available on DVD (and the DVD is very inexpensive). Fields (or just his voice) appears briefly as Humpty Dumpty.
4. Tillie and Gus (1933): not available on DVD in North America.
5. Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch (1934): not available on DVD in North America
6. Six of a Kind (1934): available on a Burns and Allen triple feature DVD.
7. Mississippi (1935): available in a Bing Crosby DVD collection.
8. The Big Broadcast of 1938: available on one of the ""Bob Hope: The Tribute Collection"" DVDs
9. Follow the Boys (1944): not available on DVD in North America. During WW2, each of the major studios made at least one all-star movie revue to bolster the morale of the public. ""Follow the Boys"" was the one made by Universal. W.C. Fields made a brief guest appearance to do his famous pool playing routine.
In conclusion, Universal has done well in making these ten classic W.C. Fields movies available at a budget price, but as I have just shown, Universal can still make many Fields fans happy by releasing at least one more collection dedicated to the cinematic legacy of the Great Man.

Edited to add (9/11/13): About a month after I wrote this review, Universal released  a DVD-r copy of ""Tillie and Gus."" I just received and watched my copy the other day, and I can report that the print quality is very good. Fans of the Great Man should not hesitate in adding this title to their collections. Now, let's hope that Universal gets around to ""If I Had a Million,"" ""Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch,"" and ""Follow the Boys.""",1374796800,94,4114,4.634246575342465
