8074641,5,B000A5N4J4,I only wish I had these before I even took lessons from an instructor. Looking at the 'basics' from an INCREDIBLE instructor who makes it so CLEAR is amazingly useful. I highly recommend it to anyone -- especially beginners and anyone looking to break 100... like me! I purchased 5 of his DVDs plus a set of 5 in one pack. Worth every dollar.,1493510400,,342,4.359375
8074642,5,B000A5N4J4,Anything from David Leadbetter will definitely improve your golf game. You will watch this DVD over and over again. A must have for Golfer.,1390780800,,139,4.833333333333333
