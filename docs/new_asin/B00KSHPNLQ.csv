8661179,5,B00KSHPNLQ,"RJ Boyle brings his authentic passion for daytime swordfishing to video.  This is a great video series for anybody who either is just starting in the pursuit of daytime swordfishing or wants to bring new tricks to their growing playbook.  It is a fantastic introduction video that is specific to basic rigging but viewers should know (or know where else to locate) instructions on rigging basics such as knots (bimini twists), creating floss loops, and creating/buying wind-on dacron leaders to name a few.

This video is Video #1 that can be used as a basis for moving on to three other videos that discuss additional insight and applications.

Viewers will learn approaches to boat layouts and rod positioning.  The author fishes on a center console (approximately 31 foot) boat and uses a swiveling rod holder that is mounted closer to the console.  Boat positioning is discussed that may be very helpful for those anglers with smaller boats and especially center console layouts.

Author filmed the video series in south Florida and spends ample time covering fishing approaches in areas that have stronger currents (gulf stream versus say the Gulf of Mexico).  He discusses the differences and modifications that may be made in slow current/tide locations but those are not shown in the video.

Equipment such as electric reels, gaffs, harpoons, hooks, and other essential information is covered in depth.

Author clearly has a deep passion for daytime swordfishing and makes every attempt to communicate successful tips and techniques without holding back specifics or secrets.  These videos were not produced with the intent to get you to buy follow up charters or additional products but rather to show you what you need to improve your technique on your own boat and catch more fish.

Viewers would be wise to have a notebook handy while watching the DVD's.  There is so much information discussed that it would be difficult to absorb that much knowledge in a single viewing and be able to remember it and apply it on your next trip(s) out.",1444953600,,2049,4.991176470588235
