2699825,1,B000L42NT6,This has always been my favorite show for grilling and bbqing. But when I ordered this I bought it without reading the description. And I was surprised when I got it in that it was just one disc. I thought for the price it was for the whole season.  I was very disappointed. I had to send it back without even opening it.  But I still maintain that this show should still be on tv cause it is the best...!!,1247184000,4,406,4.0625
2699826,5,B000L42NT6,"Great grilling show! When my cable provider changed channels around I lost my ""License To Grill"" shows and missed it so much I went out and bought the DVD set and it is my most often watched DVD. It is both entertaining and easy to follow along when you want to BBQ at home. I liked it so much I got one for my brothers birthday and one for my Dad on Father's Day. Every serious grill master has a collection of reference materials and ""License To Grill"" is a major part of my collection.",1240012800,,488,4.147368421052631
2699827,5,B000L42NT6,"Licence To Grill is our favorite! Robbie Rainford not only has great gourmet grilling recipes, but he has fun presenting them. He has a very happy and pleasant manner that makes him easy to watch. His outdoor kitchen and pool are beautiful. The music is cool and catchy and we end up humming it all day. Everything about the show is great, why can't other cooking shows be as entertaining? We watch it as much for entertainment as for grilling recipes. His recipes are more complex than basic grilling - they are really gourmet! Everything of his we have made has been excellent. He is a little nervous in the first episode or 2, but afterwards he loosens up and his personality comes thru. We were very happy to find this DVD after our cable company changed their lineup and we lost his show. Now we NEED Volume 2... and 3 and 4! ""Its time to grill... Action!""",1228348800,7,861,4.455696202531645
2699828,5,B000L42NT6,awesome dvd!!! if you own a bbq then you need this dvd. Rob Rainford takes you a mouthwatering adventure in every episode!!,1224028800,3,123,4.636363636363637
2699829,5,B000L42NT6,"I love this show.  But because I don't live in Canada, and it isn't currently broadcast in the DC-Metro area I can't watch it regularly.  This DVD is a great alternative.  Plus there's no commercials. They pick interesting, but not overly complicated recipies.  I find the BBQ-U guy to be a pompous windbag.  Plus he only uses charcoal.  Rob Rainford cooks real food with flair. And he uses gas grills, which appeals to me.  They do complete meals, not just one item.  He also explains what to watch out for.  For example, he has a 'steamboat' rule.  Hold your hands over the grill and count ""one steamboat"" ""two steamboats"" etc.  If you can't get to five, it's too hot (for slow cooking). Simple, effective way to measure the temperature.  He also encourages you to experiment or vary the recipe to your taste.  If you go to the product website you can get a sample of the video, and if you go to the food network Canada website you can see the recipes online.

With this DVD you'll be cooking great meals on the grill in no time.",1220659200,7,1031,4.44385026737968

8160096,5,B000L42NT6,"Volume 1 contains 2 DVDs with 5 episodes per DVD. It's a mixture from season 1 - 5. Each episode last about 22min (no commercials). The video format is probably 480i which is a little better than YouTube quality, but not as good as satellite or cable. This product is priced a little high. I didn't like assuming it's a complete season. I asked Amazon for details on this DVD before I purchased it and received no feedback. So I made the purchase and wanted to report this information to you. It's Time to Grill...",1333324800,5,514,4.421052631578948
8160097,5,B000L42NT6,"This man really enjoys grilling and so will you as you watch/ read this. For searing meats or veggies this is second to none. The advice on what to watch for before and during grilling is better than anyone else. Others just slap on a piece of meat and say cook for 10 minutes, Rob tells you what the meat should look and act like as well how to add smoke to your cooking. I highly recommend this.",1325635200,,397,4.102564102564102
