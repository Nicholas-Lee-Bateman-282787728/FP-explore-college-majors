6408726,1,B00K9EGAKQ,"This might have been a blast in the original theatrical release in Hong Kong, as it was designed to be seen as a 3D movie, but on TV it looks embarrassingly cheap and CG-glossed. Despite the presence of awesome kung fu actor Donny Yen, and luminaries such as Chow Yun-Fat, it's really just a silly kid's tale with bad costumes. As far as Sun Wukong goes, this tells the tale before he was even put in the employ of Guanyin, with his golden headband, and his adventures with his monkey tribe as the Mei Hou Wang, as described in the early chapters of Journey To The West, well before he met Tripitaka and the journey even started moving west.

One thing that's a bit different about this tale is that Donnie Yen makes his Wukong much more monkey-like, with mannerisms of a wild monkey, rather than the suave trickster that he is in other films.

LOL
THIS IS A FOREIGN FILM. DO NOT BUY A FOREIGN FILM AND THEN COMPLAIN HOW THEY DO NOT SPEAK ENGLISH.
Go buy Breakfast Club if you want an English speaking cast.
The film is spectacular in visuals and the cast is amazing. It tells the tale very well. Wonderful adaptation.
Subtitles come in handy if you are trying to actually watch the story. The best way to absorb it, is watch the film twice. (I mean, that IS why you bought it right? Watch it more than once...?)
Folks buying a foreign film then complaining that it doesn't have an English option is like going into Panda Express, then complaining that they don't serve pizza.",1520812800,,704,4.465116279069767

6408740,5,B00K9EGAKQ,"Great adaptation of a classic Chinese novel with mythical characters. Initially it felt like a 2AM kung fu movie, which is what I expected, but once settled in, it was a lot of fun.

The quality of the production is great: think Rodriguez's Sin City or Spy Kids, but with more elaborate practical sets, more fantasy, and 'green screen' technology and animation that is leaps and bounds ahead of his movies. The Monkey King doesn't have the completely synthetic look and feel of Avatar, which never fully allows suspension of disbelief because it is an outlandish cartoon, but more of 'this is exactly what a heaven where a Monkey can fly looks like.' There are also enough edge of fantasy to remind you that it is not a 'real world' explosion fest that is going to make you root for the machines to end it all, before your hearing is damaged, or a character tries to set a catchphrase into our lexicon.

A secondary benefit of this being subtitled in English, is that it forces you to be completely engaged in the story and its larger than life action. No surfing the web during this one - plus it deserves better. The few 'what?' moments in the subtitles are probably the result of English not having a word that means or has the same emotional connotation as the word in the script, just like that German automaker who introduced us to a word they think describes the experience of driving their car.

For those that may be worried the Buddha component of the story will make them vegetarians, shave their head, and cause an eternity living with the guy in the shiny red suit with the pointed tail who smells of Eau de Sulfur - the lessons here are the same as in the other fictional religious books that people brainwash themselves with.",1499299200,,1740,4.552715654952077

6408803,4,B00K9EGAKQ,"""The Monkey King - Havoc in Heaven's Palace"" is, well, simply breathtaking.  Starring Donnie Yen as Sun Wukong (a/k/a the Monkey King), this wonderful piece of cinema tells the story of this legendary character of Asian folklore.  Born of stone and educated by one of Heaven's chief Taoists, the Monkey King's powers were legend.  He could change himself into just about anything.  According to legend, each of the hairs on his body possessed magical properties that were capable of being transformed into clones of the King himself.  According to folklore, the Monkey King could travel 107,000 miles in one jump!  Quite mischievous, the Monkey King's battles with the Gods of the Heavens were also legendary.  This film is the first that I can remember that actually traces this legend from his birth to his capture by Buddha, who had him imprisoned for 500 years in order to help teach him a lesson.

As stated before, Donnie Yen is superb in the lead role.  Donned in complete makeup throughout, he is able to portray (with great conviction) any emotions felt by this creature.  There is one scene (which I will note reveal) that just about dissolved me into tears because of Yen's range of character.  Together with a cast of thousands, the viewer is taken into a world where few have ever traveled.  This movie is NOT your typical kung fu, beat everyone to death bloodbath.  In fact, I thought it was geared more toward a younger audience than it was an older one.  Regardless, I think any age could enjoy this.  The art direction, cinematography, direction, and acting are absolutely top-notch.  I will caution that it takes a little while for this movie to get going.  It is kind of ""meh"" in the beginning, but stick with it.

This movie is a different movie than ""The Monkey King - The Legend Begins.""  I have not seen that one, but it is stated it has a different story and is in English.  This version is in Mandarin with subtitles.  I actually prefer subtitled movies of this genre; it makes them seem all the more authentic.  Rated PG for minimal violence and action sequences, this is one of the best I've seen in 2016.,  Very Highly Recommended.",1455062400,6,2159,4.698666666666667

The move has some fantastic wire work int he fight scenes and it breaks you heart when the kill off Ruxue.

The only thing I could really wish for is better letter boxing on the captions, often the scenery and back ground hid the captions and you couldn't read it well. Otherwise I know this is one of China's favorite stories and I have the story of the Monkey King since I was old enough to watch moveis and saw it back in '59 / '60  in Okinawa Japan on the big screen.",1527120000,,752,4.251748251748252
