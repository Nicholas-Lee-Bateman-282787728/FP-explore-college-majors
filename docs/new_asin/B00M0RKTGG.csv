Kim's talent, along with guest artists, put on a fantastic evening, bringing a concert into your living room.  The testimony of Kim's nephew is especially touching, and penetrates deep into our hearts and souls.
You will not be disappointed.  I recommend this to all who enjoy and appreciate fine music, with beautiful arrangements, backed up with an orchestra that enhances the entire evening.",1418601600,,463,5.22972972972973

6543662,5,B00M0RKTGG,The best part of this dvd was the story of Kim's blind nephew and how he lost his sight at 2 years old. He played the piano and sang some too. He should do a dvd.,1414713600,2,162,3.5277777777777777
6543663,5,B00M0RKTGG,"I have to tell you, music is something that draws me. It speaks to the heart like nothing I know. So when I saw the new DVD by Kim Collingsworth, I just knew it would be a great addition to my music library. And believe me, Majestic is absolutely wonderful!!

As I said above, I am partial to music. It can be soothing and sweet but then turn right around and rouse the mind and body all the while speaking to the heart. And that is exactly why I like Kim Collingsworth. Her style of playing is different from most southern gospel pianists and it almost has a classical sound. Don't get me wrong, she can plunk out a southern tune too, but overall I would say her flair is towards classical. The filming is very well done and we see her fingers flying across the keys or Kim singing along to the playing. I have been at a taping before and there is so much that goes on behind the scenes but I think this turned out superb!!

The songs range from quiet and meditative to rousing military tunes or jazzy southern gospel classics. We also see not only Kim and her family but other well known pianists Tim Parton and Stan Whitmire. And believe me, I love seeing them play. But I also found the lesser known guests to be quite a delightful surprise! This includes Jesse Keep, Brian Keaton and the Keep girls. Boy are those girls little angels! Loved their part in the DVD. But I have to say, one of my favorite parts was hearing Jesse lay Great is Thy Faithfulness. Wow!! His story is amazing but his playing is superb. It was also a joy to hear Tim and Stan battle at the pianos.

I received a copy of this DVD through Family Christian Bloggers in exchange for an honest review. All thoughts are 100% mine. No other compensation was received.",1414022400,4,1739,4.3119266055045875
