3772821,5,B001R23G7E,"Girl 27 is a film whose story and images continue to tumble through the mind even after the tears have dried.  David Stenn's documentary about a girl who was raped in 1937 by an MGM salesman, and then dared to seek justice against the movie behemoth in a cruelly sexist era, strikes multiple chords. It is an expose of the movie industry, a detective's search for the evidence of a crime, a story of gender and victimization, a personal journal of the far-reaching effects of trauma, and a poem to the healing potential of speaking out.  It demands to be revisited.
 Stenn's meticulous and persistent research gives us a host of amazing revelations - including on-camera testimony from the daughters of an eyewitness to the crime who subsequently perjured himself on the stand (and lived his life with the guilt of what he'd done) to `30s film clips with startling scenes of apparently acceptable violence toward women.
 But what makes this documentary take flight is that Stenn actually found Patricia Douglas herself, now in her 80's, a bitter recluse.  With painstaking effort he persuaded her to talk about what she had refused to think or speak about for 65 years.  Douglas is absolutely riveting on camera, as Stenn slowly wins her trust and offers her a second chance at vindication.  Her account of what happened to her is both wrenching and ennobling.  We witness an amazing encounter, as Stenn's quest kindles Douglas' long-buried courage.  Together they pay homage to a painful truth that even the glory of MGM couldn't ultimately suppress.  We can't help but be left with the impression that something extraordinary happened in the coming together of these two people.
 This is a first rate documentary.  It made me hungry for the bonus material on the disk.  Stenn's commentary track adds insight into the story, as well as rich and touching depth to the relationship that develops between him and Douglas.
 Girl 27 is not only effective filmmaking on behalf of innocence, but an uplifting testament to the power of truth.",1196035200,7,2035,4.895043731778426
3772822,5,B001R23G7E,"I purchased this dvd because I read David Stenn's article, upon which this film is based, about four years ago in the annual HOLLYWOOD issue of Vanity Fair. At the time I had read Stenn's books on Clara Bow and Jean Harlow and was already  quite a fan. The article (like his books) was extremely detailed and well-researched. It factually illustrated and  supported just how powerful the studio system was and how efficiently MGM managed to bury this wrong. At the time I thought it regretable that this story would probably be forgotten in time. There was ample material for an extended article, but seemingly not enough for a book.

The resulting dvd is a wonderful surprise and most definitely is a 'must see'. While the article was outstanding, the film (and esp. the interview with ""GIRL 27"" Patricia Douglas) has a poignancy that even surpasses the impact of the long form article.

It's great to see David Stenn utilizing his considerable skills and those of his associates in this film. I would definitely recommend this documentary to anyone interested in the golden age of Hollywood and/or the studio system. Fascinating and heart-rending.",1194480000,7,1149,4.937823834196891
3772823,3,B001R23G7E,"This is a compelling story of how a 1930's teenage dancer, Patricia Douglas, was twice violated - once by a drunken MGM salesman from Chicago and once by MGM itself who paid off everyone connected with the case including Patricia's attorney and her own mother.  Director David Stenn manages to find the elderly Patricia living in an apartment in Las Vegas and the two form a ""friendship"" though at times Stenn seems to be simply exploiting the woman for her memories to include in his documentary.  Still articulate and insightful Patricia tells her story well and it is tragic to see how the incident she was brave enough to report adversely effected her relationships throughout her life.  Stenn does a decent job of including film clips and newspaper headlines from the 1930's to set the story in its historical context.  However he makes a big mistake in giving himself so much screen time as he comes across as annoying and a bit smug.",1194048000,6,940,4.748466257668712
3772824,5,B001R23G7E,"I saw this movie in a theatre last summer and found it to be a sensitive and moving portrayal of the terrible consequences of rape on one woman's life.  Patricia Douglas, along with many other chorus girls, was lured to a remote location under false pretenses (she was told it was a casting call) only to find herself in the midst of a drunken bash sponsored by MGM for its exclusively male sales reps.  She was raped by one of these men.  Not only did Douglas have to suffer this shameful act of violence, but after being brave enough to bring charges against the perpetrator, she was hung out to dry by everyone that should have protected her, and subjected to further degrading treatment.

The realization that the system would do nothing to protect her or attempt to right the wrong that was committed against her left what was once a carefree and confident young woman completely shut down emotionally.  She lived out the rest of her life unable to truly love anyone, even her own child.  ""Girl 27"" shows how the consequences of a single act of selfish violence played out over a long, lonely and unhappy life.

Patricia Douglas is powerfully moving in her descriptions of the rape, and almost painfully honest about her own failures in her subsequent life, the later part of which was spent living as a recluse, in poor health, friendless and estranged from her only daughter.  Douglas is amazingly articulate about her experience, and her voice will stay with you a long time.

I was touched by David Stenn's dedication to the truth and his sensitivity towards Douglas, who was without question a difficult person.  She came to love and trust him in the process of telling her story.  So not only is telling her story a liberation for her, but telling it to Stenn, who clearly came to love and admire her, allowed Douglas to love and trust someone again before she died.

Though I think this movie is worth seeing for Douglas alone -- she is without equal as an oral witness of the consequences of her era's sexism -- it's also a fascinating study of the Hollywood studio system and the image of women at the time, with relevant film clips and interviews woven in throughout.",1193097600,8,2182,4.624352331606218
3772825,5,B001R23G7E,"In 1937, Patricia Douglas, a straight-laced, 17-year-old studio dancer was sent by a casting agent to what she thought was a film call.  She ended up at a MGM Studios sales convention ""stag"" party where she was manhandled and eventually raped and beaten by an out-of-town salesman.

When she tried to seek justice, she got screwed again - this time by everyone from top MGM brass, the district attorney, the press, and key witnesses to her doctor, lawyer and own mother.  The emotional ripple effect of that crime has been felt by three generations to-date.

Flash forward 65 years to Hollywood historian, author and filmmaker David Stenn's discovery of Douglas' story in old newspapers while researching a Jean Harlow biography and pursuing the truth, much to the chagrin of Douglas who gave up hoping for justice long ago.

GIRL 27 is not only a documentary about a powerful studio scandal and cover-up, it's also the story of how an 85-year-old woman overcomes decades of pain, fear and disappointment to learn to trust someone again when they say ""I want to help you find justice, vindication, peace.""  As such, I liked that the film shows the development of Stenn and Douglas' friendship and the emotional bond they formed.

The most compelling part of the film is Douglas' on-camera recollections, speaking about the rape for the first time ever.  (She was never interviewed for any of the exploitative newspaper articles of the day.) This is a woman who needed to feel, and did ultimately feel, heard and understood.

There's lot to love about this film besides the courage and heroic beauty of Patricia Douglas.  Vintage film clips showing how violence against women was treated by Hollywood at the time, interviews with family members of key players in the story and insights provided by experts such as actress Diana Carey (herself a victim of studio system sexual harassment), author Judy Lewis (the daughter of Clark Gable and Loretta Young, and victim of a Hollywood scandal cover-up), attorney Michael Taitelman and legal analyst Greta Van Susteren.

I'd highly recommend viewing the DVD while listening to Stenn's audio commentary track.  He provides lots of relevant insights and additional facts pertaining to the case and Hollywood history, as well as background tid-bits on the making of the documentary.  I thought it was one of the more compelling commentary tracks I've heard in years.",1192838400,28,2407,5.0327455919395465
3772826,5,B001R23G7E,"This is an incredible film, a powerful film, a love letter to someone who was deeply and tragically wronged. This is a film that shows how sadness, dispair and actions can be carried down through the generations. It is also a film that shows that the system may try to destroy you but if you believe in yourself, the truth will come out somehow.
This is a film that is moving in every way a film can be. David Stenn, the filmmaker has done alot of good with his film. He has helped to change lives, bring closure, and allowed Patricia Douglas to feel that she is not alone in her struggles and regrets.
An absolute must see. You won't regret it.",1192665600,19,645,4.295081967213115
3772827,5,B001R23G7E,"I have long been a fan of David Stenn's biographies of Clara Bow (""Runnin' Wild"") and Jean Harlow (""Bombshell"").  I have read many film bios and Stenn's are the most compelling and painstakingly researched ones I have ever read.  He leaves no stone unturned.  Naturally I was very eager to see GIRL 27 and to find out how he would translate his work into the form of a documentary.

I was impressed with the results.  GIRL 27 is the story of Patricia Douglas, a dancer who was brutally raped at an MGM party.  While I often romanticize the ""Golden Age"" of Hollywood, this film is a searing, compelling and fascinating look at the other side of that illusion.

I had no problem with Stenn putting himself into the story since he was such an integral part of it.

Stenn really helped Douglas to have the last word and to achieve the peace and vindication that had clearly eluded her until now.

GIRL 27 is a haunting, compelling and powerful documentary that will stay with you long after the final credits.",1192320000,15,1005,4.538888888888889
3772828,5,B001R23G7E,"It's now two days since I watched this fascinating documentary about the studio power of MGM in the 1930s and I'm still hearing the voice of Patricia Douglas, a minor ""extra"" who was raped by an MGM sales rep at an MGM-sponsored Convention in 1937. What? You never heard of Patricia Douglas or the case? Neither have most folks. But when journalist David Stenn was researching his bio of Jean Harlow the case popped up. He dug further and reported his findings in a long article in Vanity Fair magazine in 2003. Then he went further and edited his interview footage - of the reclusive Douglas, who he found still living at age 85, and legal experts - with some feature film clips into this compelling 80-minute film.

There was a whole file on the case in the USC Film Archives that hadn't been touched since the 1930s and provided lots of info for Stenn.  The filmmaker narrates the film - and even interviews himself! - in a pleasant voice but the voice you won't forget is that of Douglas. It's gruff and worn and angry. After 65 years, she is seeing her story come to light. Sure, the studio (MGM) is now a different corporate entity, having been swallowed up by Ted Turner, but there probably is still a ""casting couch"" out there.

The impeccably researched and creatively edited film is a must for anyone interested in the Hollywood films of the 1930s or 40s. The bonus features include the 10-minute Paramount short ""Hollywood Extra Girl"", which is - sadly - cropped too close so that the top and bottom of picture are cut off as well as a Director's Commentary by Stenn. The commentary really adds to the understanding of the case and Stenn's voice is engaging, making it almost essential to listen to.

I dove into this DVD with no prior knowledge of it's subject, except for the blurb on the DVD case. I did not leave my TV set from the opening title. And I'm still hearing Douglas's voice telling her story!

3772829,1,B001R23G7E,"Panned by the Hollywood Reporter as follows: ""Stenn, an accomplished TV writer-producer with an ebullient personality that doesn't wear well, undercuts his material by putting himself front and center -- he has more screen time than Douglas. Stenn films himself pacing in his hotel room, thinking out loud in the car and, in a lapse of taste, dancing on Ross' grave. Declarations of his good intentions, however genuine, come across as self-serving. There's certainly a whiff of exploitation here.""

For me, this film made me feel pretty repulsed, a woman who was exploited by one man is exploited all over again by the repulsive David Stenn (he's the writer of Vanilla Ice vehicle Cool As Ice by the way).",1189987200,8,706,4.932773109243698

Luckily, it's the power and poignancy of the story that carries the piece beyond some seriously annoying production shortfalls that hopefully Red Envelope Productions will note.

David Stenn is soooo busy putting himself INTO the story, that he becomes an unwelcomed character in it instead of a storyteller. (Hey Dave, got it already! I'm sure your Mom is proud, oy!) I would have rather had a decent voiceover and called it a day.

I also found it quite a production speedbump to cut to Greta Van Sustern on the visually loud Fox TV set every time she chimed in. While it was likely a condition to get her, it still added to the ""patchwork quilt"" look that you don't see in some of the best documentaries which I'm quite addicted to by the way.",1339632000,,852,4.525974025974026

3772833,4,B001R23G7E,"Do not expect shocking revelations and uncovered conspiracies. This is a documentary about a woman who was raped at 17 while working as a dancer at the MGM Sales Convention. It didn't take much to cover up this scandal 65 years ago. One bribed witness who magically couldn't identify the rapist, one unscrupulous doctor who proclaimed the innocent victim a tramp, one unhelpful mother who didn't want to stand up for her daughter.

3772834,4,B001R23G7E,"I watched Girl 27 on Netflix yesterday and I still hear Patricia Douglas's voice in my mind. Patricia Douglas was a dancer at MGM in the 30's. She was raped at a party for MGM salesmen. When Patricia tried to fight what had happened to her the press and MGM just went after her. MGM bought off her lawyer, the DA, her mother, and the main eyewitness. Definitley the seedy underside of Hollywood. This is also the story of the hard work and dedication of David Stenn who uncovered Patricia's story while researching for his book about Jean Harlow. Stenn finds Patricia 85 years old, living in Vegas and basically a recluse, depressed, and bitter. He wins her trust and she tells her story to him. The clips of the MGM dancers and of films at that time show how women basically had no rights and men could do whatever they wanted. It was interesting hearing from Patricia's daughter and seeing how that one event impacted her whole family through the generations and emotionally isolated her from her family. It was so sad to watch how this ruined Patricia's life and impacted her marriages, family, and how she lived her life. But at the same time so amazing in the courage it took to tell her story 65 years later and back then to try to get justice for herself. She is unforgettable. It was very poignant when David Stenn talked about how when he first met Patricia he gave her a hug and at first she didn't hug back but then she opened up to him and through Stenn Patricia got to experience that love and trust from another person before she died. The most gripping parts of the documentary are hearing Patricia's voice and seeing her on camera talking about her experiences.

3772835,5,B001R23G7E,"For anyone interested in the ""golden age of Hollywood"", this documentary underscores the seamy underbelly and the hypocrisy of that era.  Louis B Mayer was strong on morality in his films, but apparently couldn't have cared less regarding the welfare of the people who worked for him.  Unless you were a big star, you were completely expendable, especially if you were a woman.  This is the true story of a young dancer in 1937 who was raped at an MGM party by one of the MGM salesmen and the coverup that ensued after she brought charges against the man who raped her, also involving the studio.  What is fascinating is the lengths the studio went to to erase her story and how easily the people involved were bought off.  It's amazing that over 70 years have gone by and the pain and intensity have not diminished.

But the idea that in the 1930s, a young girl was raped at a movie studio party and the whole thing was covered up...is this supposed to be a revelation?  In the film, various legal experts weigh in and their incredulity that this happened is more shocking than the event itself.

I know Patricia Douglas wanted her story told, but I came away thinking it was a disservice to her to make this tragic event and what little happened afterward into a full length movie, since there just isn't that much to say.

8337181,4,B001R23G7E,"If there's anything anyone who has more than a passing interest  about Hollywood soon comes to understand,is that beneath that ritzy glitzy exterior,lies a place with a sordid and sometimes ugly past. David Stenn while doing research on his book about Jean Harlow(at the point,coincidentally,about her death)accidentally uncovered a reference to one Patricia Douglas. Patricia was one of thousands of extras then employed in Hollywood. She was just 17,was a quick learner and was competent at her work. In May of /37 came what was thought a casting call for her and many other girls. In reality it was to attend  the (Hal)Roach Ranch(where many Roach films had been shot),where she and others would help to entertain a bevy of MGM salesmen brought into Hollywood for a multi day bash. The drinks flowed and the entertainment consisted of,among others,Laurel and Hardy. They were greeted by an exuberant Louis B.Mayer.
David Stenn uncovered a still extant file on Patricia Douglas and  actual film footage of the arrival and start of the salesmen fete. It wasn't that long into the party when Patricia Douglas was raped by one of the salesmen. Patricia sued MGM,a bold move for the 30s,and the wagons at MGM immediately circled. Misinformation and behind the scenes manipulation all but crushed any hopes that Patricia would ever succeed with her claim.
Fast forward to the early 2000s and David Stenn enters the picture trying to put what little pieces there are of the puzzle, with what he slowly but surely uncovers,together. He interviews Roach biographer and Laurel and Hardy author Richard Bann as they walk in the area of what was once the Roach Ranch. As the doctor who""examined"" Patricia right after the rape was recommended by Roach,one wonders how much did Roach know,or any of the entertainers on the bill,for that matter?(these two questions are never touched upon,and are all but lost in time).He tracks down her assailant who has since passed away. But miracle of miracles occurs when he finds that Patricia is alive and well in Las Vegas! When he is finally able to gain her trust,which took considerable time and patience,Stenn through long talks on the phone,eventually persuades Patricia to go on camera for the record. It is heart wrenching to see this now 85 year old lady talk in stops and starts about the still raw and humiliating experience she suffered those many years before.
The film fills in as many gaps as can be filled,as time has been enemy#1 on this case. He interviews the siblings of the man who found Patricia outside the building and took her to the hospital,another rape victim which occurred a few months after Patricia's and experienced the same thing she had,and an interview with Patricia's daughter. It seems Patricia was certainly naive when she worked at MGM,but her brutal rape obviously shaped the rest of her life in many unforeseen ways. She became  a loner and her personal life became a more than dysfunctional one. Mr. Stenn got to Patricia in time, as just a short while after,she passed away.
Technically the film is in its original w/s a/r of 1:66:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include commentary,a photo gallery and a Paramount short of the era about extra girls ,which gives one a nice backgrounder on the whole extra scene back then. I would advise one watch the short first. Btw,the short has a 1:37:1 a/r but is shown in the 1:66:1 a/r ,which essentially chops much of the bottom off. I believe the point was just to convey the background on extras,which it did,and the a/r was secondary,which in this case I did not mind.
All in all a very compelling and sordid mess of a story that will stick with you LONG after you watch it;not only for those questions answered,but all the unanswered ones.",1412553600,,3758,4.848909657320872

8337184,1,B001R23G7E,"This is a strange documentary about a strange woman thrown together by an emotional ""documentarian."" I first watched Girl 27 with the hopes of learning what happened in this lesser-known scandal. I was intrigued. I did not, however, realize that I would be dragged into a meandering diatribe about the evils of men of yester century. Over and over again all we hear is the endless complaining by the ""documentarian"" about the corrupt MGM studio execs and the complicit media. And then when you feel you've heard their complaints enough, they start over.

The film is emotional garbage that, from the very get-go, presupposes that the story is true. Now, it very well MAY be, but the documentary spends a large amount of time piling on and besmirching the reputations and names of people who are unable to defend themselves. The film points to the fact that David Ross was never charged with the rape and while a sensible person might find that to be as a result of a lack of evidence, the documentarian jumps to the conclusion that deviousness MUST have driven the scandal to go away.

Again, I'm not saying that it's possible to know one way or another what happened in 1937; all I know is that this film makes absolutely no attempt to provide a balanced discussion or even discuss the supposed events.

It does, however, offer a disjointed narrative that is beyond absurd. At one point, they interview Judy Davis, the lovechild of Loretta Young and Clark Gable. What does she have to do with this story? Absolutely nothing. Seriously, nothing.

Patricia Douglas, the woman who claimed to have been raped in 1937, provides a purely bizarre twist to the documentary. I actually found myself asking, ""What is this that I'm watching?"" The ""documentarian"" went on at great lengths about how much he loves Douglas, she rambled on in a nonsensical manner similarly. Douglas' daughter spoke candidly about the horrendous maternal instinct of the arguably white trash Patricia Douglas. Then, for no reason, Douglas' daughter's son comes in, says something about going to a gay bar and being a ""queen"", and then styles his mom's hair on camera. It was like a bad acid trip watching the disjointed storytelling.

Most disappointing of all, however, was the way both Douglas and the ""documentarian"" so readily jumped to explain away all of the mistakes Douglas had made in the preceding 70 years as a function of the alleged rape. Again, the story very well could be true. But aside from never attempting to offer a balanced discussion of the events, the film spends a tremendous amount of time framing the 70 years of Douglas' white trash behavior as having been a result of emotional trauma. She abandons her own daughter (who seems to share a mutual dislike of one another) but it's okay- she got raped so she's a saint and never has to take responsibility for her actions and poor decisions.

The film really is absolute garbage. Don't waste your time.",1379376000,,2946,4.812252964426878
8337185,5,B001R23G7E,"Actually anyone with compassion, and who wants to see how trauma can affect generations, especially those who know nothing of the trauma, should watch this documentary.

He discovers a 65 year old rape case that made big, big news and then disappeared. What happened, why the cover up, and what ever happened to the brave teenager, Patricia Douglas, who dared to file a landmark lawsuit against MGM studios? Stenn takes the viewer on his decade long journey with him, what starts out as trying to understand what happened all those years ago turns into a profound look into the rippling affects this trauma is still causing today.

Stenn is surprised to find Patricia Douglas alive. But she is in hiding and bitter and wants to leave this long buried story dead and buried. But the story hinges on getting Patricia's point of view, so Stenn persists. It is the viewers reward that he did so, it is her voice, and that of her family. that makes this film unforgettable. She was David against Goliath (MGM), it is truth, honor and righteousness versus corruption, deceit and betrayal. From the very beginning, at the hospital examination, MGM used its power to sweep everything away. Patricia bravely persisted, at a time when rape was barely considered a crime, and filed a lawsuit against MGM and the man who raped her. MGM, with its far reaching influence worked on erasing evidence and manipulating everything else, including the most personal of betrayals. These betrayals change this strong willed young lady, affecting the rest of her life, her daughter's, and her grandchildren.

This is not a pretty, happily-ever-after Hollywood story and those who do not want that image of classic Hollywood tarnished should stay away. Also Stenn is a bit guilty of making himself too much a part the story at times. For me these interruptions didn't detract from the potency of the story, but for those who want a documentary to be purely about its subject, it could be a distraction. Please be aware this film is not for children, its mature subject matter, frankness, and language, although handled in a tasteful and respectful manner, may make some sensitive viewers uncomfortable.

This compelling, disturbing, and thought provoking film will stay with you long after viewing it. The veracity of this one event shatters so many and shows that it never affects only one person. My hope is that possibly it will help someone to see that, despite the pain, sharing their own trauma can bring healing for themselves and others. Either way Patricia Douglas and her story are unforgettable.",1376697600,2,3098,5.601279317697228
8337186,5,B001R23G7E,"I watched Girl 27 on the recommendation of someone who posted about it in a forum I frequent. I love old Hollywood and I love a good scandal so I watched this on Netflix straight away. I liked it so much that I bought it. First, this isn't a glamorous old Hollywood story by a long shot. Like a lot of people, I had no idea who Patricia Douglas was. She was never a star - just a young girl living in LA who appeared as a dancing extra in a film or two. Unless you were alive and living in Los Angeles in 1937, you likely wouldn't know her either.

At 17, Douglas was hired by MGM under the guise of appearing in a film. Douglas and a slew of other young girls were actually hired as ""entertainment"" for a group of salesmen MGM trucked out to the Hal Roach ranch for a sales convention. As you'll learn from the documentary, ""sales convention"" is a euphemism for free-for-all drunken orgy. Douglas was raped at the sales convention by a Chicago salesman, David Ross. She was found by a parking attendant, examined by an inept doctor and pressed charges against Ross. The media had a field day with the story, but only at the expense of Patricia. MGM made the whole matter go away by throwing money at everyone involved (including Douglas' own mother) and Ross was never brought up on any charges. He slunk back to Chicago to live the rest of his life. Douglas didn't get a dime from MGM and basically faded away.

Author David Stenn, the director of this documentary, stumbled upon this story when he was researching his biography about Jean Harlow. Harlow died around the time this story was making headlines which is how he became familiar with it. He eventually found Douglas and set about telling her story. Understandably, she wasn't eager to rehash the past but I think part of her wanted to talk to someone about it.

I found the documentary to be well made. Even if you're not familiar with old Hollywood or the studio system, this gives you enough background information to bring you up to speed. The facts of the case are also laid out very well. Unless you're incredibly optimistic or live with blinders on, it's easy to see that MGM took great pains to bury this story. Stenn did a great job of finding nearly everyone involved in the story. Some of the participants have since died (like Ross who died of rectal cancer in 1961) but some of the participants' families were interviewed and acknowledged the pay offs. In one instance, the daughters of the parking attendant who found Patricia after she was raped were interviewed. They admitted their father changed his testimony in exchange for a ""job for life"" from MGM. It's easy to be outraged at an action like that but I can't imagine the man had too many choices. Would his account have changed things? As the documentary shows, MGM ran Los Angeles at the time so it's difficult to say. Another story that is similar to Douglas' is also briefly looked at. Eloise Spann, who was a singer and appeared in a few films, was also allegedly raped by a man who worked at MGM. Spann died some time ago, but Stenn found her son who tells her story. While Spann's story is strikingly similar to Patricia's, her fate was a bit darker to say the very least.

What I also enjoyed about the documentary were the interviews. Stenn didn't just interview the subject, he also interviewed people who were working in Hollywood during that era to establish what it was like for young women who were trying to break into show business. Actress Diana Serra Cary (who was a huge star in the silent era as Baby Peggy) recalled her time at MGM as a young woman. Sexual harassment was pretty much the order of the day back then. If you wanted a job or didn't want to be completely ostracized, you didn't complain about being groped. Stenn also looks at the hypocrisy of Hollywood. Someone like Douglas, who was not protected by a studio, was publicly derided for being a tramp for getting herself raped. Stars who found themselves in similar sticky situations were protected. This isn't earth shattering news, but it is still interesting to learn just how far people will go to keep up appearances for the sake of fame, money and phony morality.

While the Hollywood aspect of this film was interesting, the real life facts behind Douglas are also compelling. Her rape and the ensuing public spectacle did change her life. Douglas married three times but didn't find happiness (two of her husbands were bigamists). In between her marriages, she continued to live with her mother with whom she already had a difficult relationship. This wasn't helped by the fact that Mom sold her daughter out when MGM offered her some cash to make the rape case go away. Douglas' rocky relationship with her own daughter is also examined. I've read a few reviews where people are appalled by her daughter's behavior. I don't know if I'd agree considering their relationship. I found her complaints about paying $25 for a box to hold her mother's cremains a bit petty but as someone who has a difficult (ie non-existent) relationship with a parent, I might very well feel the same.

Also included on the DVD is commentary by the director/writer, David Stenn, and a short film called ""Hollywood Extra Girl"", released in 1935. I have yet to listen to the commentary for the reasons listed below. I have watched the short many times because it is thoroughly entertaining. ""Hollywood Extra Girl"" is one of those shorts studios made to promote, well, nothing. They're mostly propaganda-ish now and border on absurd. This particular short follows an ""extra girl"" named Suzanne Emery who is appearing in The Crusades (as an extra girl, natch) directed by Cecil B. DeMille. Come to think of it, I think this short was made just to showcase DeMille acting like a tyrant, er, genius, while giving unconvincing fatherly advice to a young hopeful. By the way, the ""star"" of this short went on to do nothing. She appeared in The Crusades as an unbilled extra, did this short and then dropped off the face of the Earth. I guess DeMille was right when he said the odds of her making it were slim to none.

As well made as I found this documentary, there was one point that could have been changed. David Stenn is a pretty good author and filmmaker, but he interjects himself into the documentary a wee bit too much. I don't know if we had to see his thoughts about everything all the time. Yeah, it's awesome that his editor (who was Jackie O by the way...in case you missed that. You might miss that) ordered him to do this story because no one else could, but I think most of us are aware that the person who makes a documentary is typically interested in the subject. It was touching that he did establish a relationship with Patricia because she was obviously in need of some friends, but his presence was overwhelming at times and unneeded for the most part. I wouldn't say he exploited Douglas, but it seems like he was going above and beyond to showcase that he cared for her. It was distracting the first few times I watched it but I have since tuned his parts out. For me, it was a minor point and not enough to overshadow the overall story and research that went into this.

There are obviously folks out there who find this kind of story ""boring"" because sex crimes, injustice and cover-ups have been around since the dawn of time and one more story about it won't solve anything. I don't subscribe to that line of thinking and frankly don't understand it, but I get that this story isn't for everyone. If you're one of those people, skip it. If you'd rather see old Hollywood as a perfect, glamorous place where bad things didn't happen, again, skip it. This documentary won't totally ruin your view on that lovely era, but it will darken it a bit. If you're interested in that era in general or in the legal system and how very corrupt it can be, this documentary may be for you.",1356739200,3,7901,4.551336146272855

I decided to see if it was available for purchase on Amazon and it was for a reasonable price.",1355184000,,197,4.5
8337188,3,B001R23G7E,"The saddest aspect of this story is how thoroughly ruined Patricia Douglas's life was. I feel so sorry for her beautiful daughter, who bore the brunt of her mother's emotional damage. Not only did she suffer as a child from her stepfather's depredations, but she seemed to receive no love or support from her mother the entire time her mother was alive. It's a shame that someone as strong-willed as Patricia Douglas was, in standing up to her attacker and the studio to try and receive justice, could not put the pieces of her broken life back together. Why she treated her own daughter so badly is hard to fathom, but it appeared in the movie that her daughter was able break the cycle and be a loving mother herself. It's sad that her mother never let her within her emotional walls, while the filmmaker, David Stenn, somehow charmed his way in.
Overall a compelling and tragic story, but it would have been better had the filmmaker not injected himself so much into the story.",1346544000,2,980,4.605714285714286
