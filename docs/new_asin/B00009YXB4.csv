1898241,3,B00009YXB4,"This goes straight for B-movie status and grabs it by the horns. There is no over-arching premise. This is big spiders in the countryside. The effects aren't that bad for low budget campy horror. The plot is a wire framework holding the spider scenes together. The character interactions are clunky and forced at times. But the dialogue between the two main characters though comes off as natural which is nice. Look, its cheese, but its fun and works most of the time.",1508198400,2,469,4.7317073170731705
1898242,1,B00009YXB4,"Junky low-budget creature feature. Start with a terrible script that has to pander to 15 year old boys who want a glimpse of breasts, add in some amateur actors forced to say lines like: ""I don't snore. I know because I stayed up all night once to make sure"" (If you laughed at that chestnut you may find some amusement herein), and finish up with poor direction and this is what you get. The stop-motion arachnia are a nice nod to the big bug films of the 50s but can't save this puerile nonsense. Stick around for the closing credits, if you can, and laugh at their misspelling of soldiers: SOLIDERS. Honestly, if you can't even get that right...

1898249,2,B00009YXB4,"The filmmakers admitted that they were trying for a 50's vibe with this creature feature.  Along the way they neglected to consider that the makers of those fabulously awful 50's flicks weren't trying to create funny or bad films, they were trying to make good films (no one sets out to make a bomb).  They wanted their films to be taken seriously.  Unfortunately, good intentions don't always translate into good movies.  Brett Piper's attempt to recreate the look and style of a 50's sci-fi flick failed because he tried to make a parody of them and not a tribute.  He had the story right, a small plane crashes during a meteor storm.  Lost in a remote area, they seek refuge in an abandoned building, quickly running into the owner who is willing to put them up for the night in his house.  It's soon revealed that he has more than a nodding acquaintance with freakishly large spiders that soon show up in droves.  Who will survive and who won't?

The main problem with this movie is the hopeless dialog and inept acting skills resulting in too many unlikable characters that soon prove too annoying to ignore.  In desperation, nudity is featured as a last ditch effort to distract from the lack of skill set on display.  Sadly, the best thing about this movie was the cheesy stop-motion spiders.

It was watchable, but not something I'd care to watch again.",1411776000,4,1361,4.648535564853557
1898250,3,B00009YXB4,"Just before Brett Piper signed a multi-picture deal with EI Independent, he pumped out this moderately entertaining movie about giant spider monsters that menace a small town. There's not much else to it than that. Piper brings the creatures to life with his usual quirky stop motion animation, and it looks great for the budget. The monsters aren't scary, but they remind me a little of the Crites from ""Critters""; they have a personality in how they were crafted, giving them some degree of depth beyond being the films mindless antagonist that must be overcome.

The movie doesn't have any aspiration beyond being a low rent monster movie and it succeeds. Unfortunately, it's success means that it's ultimately forgettable, lost to the deluge of DTV schlock that glutted rental store shelves during the time. I would say that fans of b-movies should give it a look, but Piper has plenty of other, more interesting offerings on his resume. This one's nothing more than a bit of dumb fun.",1408233600,,989,4.886904761904762

The stop action photography is really excellent too. The acting is pretty good as well. Better than some high budget films on the Sci-Fy channel. Fun from beginning to end. Any fan of 50's horror, low budget horror, or sci fi should see this. Brett Piper the director is making cool films. I will look out for his other ones. I am giving it an extra star for the fun factor.",1407542400,,520,4.21
1898252,3,B00009YXB4,"This gets about three and a half stars. It's a little slow in the beginning, but the pace picks up a little later. I thought it was a campy and entertaining B movie. The spiders aren't CGI created and are basically done with stop motion in some parts and are practical at other times. There's a good topless and rear nude scene with Alexxus Young, and the entire film is lively. It says it's rated R for ""nudity/sexuality and some language,"" but it does have some slimy scenes with them killing the spiders; an example would be towards the end when the guy fights a couple of them with a chainsaw. There's also a really cheap clay FX scene when a guy is torn in half, and there's some other violence as well. I thought the directing was decent, the acting was pretty good for a direct to DVD cheap movie, and some of the music was pretty good; however, it's still mainly for fans of cheap B-movie stuff. There isn't really any effective atmosphere, and the locations are not really worth mentioning. With the exception of it having a slight problem earlier on of being a little slow, I thought it was a fun and cheap flick.

The quality is good. The DVD menu screen and chapter stops are well done with animation and music.",1405641600,,1223,4.411504424778761

1898254,4,B00009YXB4,"We watch a lot of bad movies. Some are good, most are bad, and some are really bad. I expected Arachnia to fall into the ""really bad"" category. I was surprised to discover that Arachnia is actually a fun, low-budget monster movie. The monsters are large spider-like stop-motion creations, like something from the 1950s. Other than a lack of color (the monsters are uniformly grey-brown), the special effects are reasonably well done for a low budget movie. The characters are distinctive, the acting is not too shabby for a low-budget film, and the writing is actually pretty good. We chuckled several times, not just at the movie, but with the movie. There are even a few nude scenes, but rather than the awkward, uncomfortable to watch, overtly sexual and yet completely non-erotic scenes you get in movies like Final Examination, Arachnia has a sense of innocent fun. One of the times we laughed was actually during one of the nude scenes, and this was not a ""laughing because it is so bad"" moment, but a moment of intentional humor. How rare that is!

So, for just plain fun, I give this movie four out of five stars.

Trivia: Arachnia was made by Edgewood Studios, the same Vermont folks who gave us Timechasers.",1263081600,,1217,4.735849056603773
1898255,4,B00009YXB4,"How do you judge or rate an individual film's worth? That's the question I ask myself every single time I sit down to type up a review. Should I compare this film with CITIZEN KANE or THE GODFATHER or some other film generally regarded as one of the finest cinematic accomplishments of all time? That hardly seems fair, especially since I'm usually dealing with horror or kung fu flicks. So then, should I judge it against some ideal of GENRE perfection as they do in a cat show where they compare every single cat against the specifications for perfection within its own particular breed? Persian against Persian, Siamese against Siamese? Then at the end of the day all breeds compete against each other for Best in Show. Well, that's not very fair either because it doesn't take the low budget independent films into consideration. In the end you still wind up judging a house cat against a Persian--an indie against a blockbuster. BATMAN,THE DARK KNIGHT against CURSE OF THE QUEERWOLF.

After much thought on the matter my criteria for judging any film no matter the genre (which I seem to repeat at any and every possible opportunity) is this; How much did the film makers manage to accomplish with the resources at their disposal? Obviously the standard is going to be higher for those with a lot of money available to them for the simple reason that they have absolutely no excuse NOT to turn out a first rate film. They can hire the best actors, writers, technicians, anything and everything they want is right there at their beck and call. The only justifiable reason for failure under those circumstances would be either lack of talent or excessive interference by the people who control the money. However at a certain level the latter ceases to be a problem and we are left with only one conclusion: They should be watching movies, not making them.

My criteria for low budget film makers is the same, but since their resources may often be limited to how much they can squeeze onto their own credit cards, I am inclined to feel a lot more generous toward them and their films. Mark Pirro for instance turned out his classic 8mm film A POLISH VAMPIRE IN BURBANK for well under $8,000! Although I've never heard its budget, Peter Jackson's BAD TASTE was filmed while he was still in high school so I doubt that a lot of money was spent on it. And at the head of the low budget wave, almost like a nouveau Roger Corman, is Brett Piper who has turned out an impressive number of cheap flix over the past decade or two. Among these films is ARACHNIA, one of my favorites, although one of the lowest rated of his movies here.  Go figure. Arachnia has everything I look for in an entertaining film. Its made with the same sense of fun and adventure as the giant bug movies from the 1950's and features Piper's trademark stop motion animation of the titular arachnids which come in all sizes up to and including as big as a pick-up truck. But let's start at the beginning, shall we?

 Our story opens with a small plane crashing when the concusion from a nearby meteor impact knocks it out of the sky. Our survivors include; heroic pilot Shaun Pachowski (Rob Monkiewicz), Professor Mugford (David Bunce) an expert in vertebrate palentology who was flying to a dig in Arizona, Chandra his more than able personal assistant(Irene Joseph), grad student Deke (Dan Merriman) whose purpose is to provide comic relief and possibly spider fodder, and the Doublemint Twins (Bevin McGraw and Alexxus Young) whose purpose it is to provide adolescent male stimulation vis a vis some girl on girl and, possibly become spider fodder too.

Our intrepid group decides to hike 50 miles in the dark to where the nearest town is supposed to be, and so off they go towards their date with animated destiny. Fortunately they encounter one of those conveniently located deserted cabins that every movie seems to have and they decide to call it a night. But not before the Doublemint twins get in a little bath time and the opportunity to show that they have not as yet availed themselves of the services of a plastic surgeon. This is approximately the point at which the cabin's owner shows up, Moses Cobb by name (James Aspden). He gets an eyeful of Twin and then repays everyone by showing them what he has out in the barn. A GIANT DEAD SPIDER! The Professor of course points out that its a fake and is forced to sleep in the barn with it for his poor manners. (Moral: Don't be rude to farmer's with Big Dead Spiders.) Later that night the saxophone music starts and the Twins get to show why the got hired for this movie in the first place.(I think there might have been a longer version of this scene, since mine ends rather abruptly, thank God) And that's when the spiders decided to ATTACK EN MASSE, I guess they'd had enough g on g too.

This movie really is a lot of fun if you'll just ease up and let yourself go with it. Both Irene Joseph who plays the Professor's beautfiul, take-charge African-American assistant and Rob Monkiewicz, the heroic and extremely well-built pilot who seems much too smart to be in the situation he's in, are Piper regulars. They both bring more humor and believeability to their roles than one would expect in a low budget film, and why shouldn't they? They're hardly novices anymore. Dan Merriman is a bit irritating as the comedy relief, but then he's supposed to be. David Bunce as the Professor is every bit the arrogant academic the role calls for, and the Doublemint twins, well, they have all the right parts for their parts.

It's always a joy to see stop motion animation in this world of over-blown, over-utilized, heartless, sterile CGI. I don't care if the animation would have to improve 100% in order for the spiders to look even vaguely realistic. I admire the people who take the time and the effort to animate the old way--it has more soul. And I just have a soft spot in my heart for these goofy looking arachnids who have more eyes than any spider has ever needed before. And when you add the heroics of Rob Monkiewicz, Spider Slayer, wielding his chainsaw and looking for all the world like Bruce Campbell on steroids to the picture--well, you've made my week!

Does this movie make sense? Kinda. Is it fun? Definitely. Will you like it? I think you might. Will it kill you to try it? I seriously doubt it.

The dvd has only Spanish subtitles which was a drawback for me. I like to watch movies late at night and I use the subtitles to help keep the noise down. It is letter-boxed. It has a commentary track, and a not-very-special behind the scene featurette showing some of the spider manufacturing process. (Piper also does his own stop motion work.)

1898256,2,B00009YXB4,"""Arachnia"" is a terrible piece of B-movie tripe, but I am going to give it two stars for the hilarity of the stop motion giant spiders. These are the stupidest and least scary monsters I have seen since Ro-Man terrorized audiences in ""Robot Monster"".

The plot is sublimely ridiculous: a small plane crashes due to a meteor and the survivors spend the rest of film squabbling and running from rubber spiders. The film has the typical B-movie elements: a heroic pilot, a strong female lead, an idiotic pair of sorority sisters, a conniving scientist, and an utterly wretched guy named ""Deke"". (At least he gets eaten early.)

The film has great little diversions, like building a moat of fire, feeding a giant spider dynamite, challenging a giant spider to a duel with a chainsaw, and an Army invasion to clean up the mess. It even has the mark of a true B-movie, namely a concluding title card reading ""The End?"" (Like we need a sequel.)

The film does feature a commentary track and a few other extras, the best of which is the ""Behind the Scenes"" featurette. I am unsure where the DVD was actually manufactured, but it had problems playing in my DVD players. I have no idea why I was so dedicated to the film that I kept looking for one that would play it. (An old Sony DVD player finally did the trick.) There is also some sound dropout on my copy of the DVD; I don't know if these problems are widespread or are specific to my copy, but technical troubles are worth mentioning. I recommend this only to fans of exceptionally bad B-movies (although this is not as amusing as many), or to citizens of Rutland, Vermont, the home of Edgewood Studios, maker of this wonder.",1211068800,,1672,4.548172757475083
1898257,1,B00009YXB4,If you're looking for a movie that resembles the product of a really bad 1950's movie and a soft-core porn flick then this is the waste of celluoid for you! The only thing I've seen that even comes close to the level of unbelievable badness (and not in a good way; in a way that makes you want to track down and torture the producers) is Ice Queen. Not even Sci-Fi channel made-for-tv-movies are this god-awful.,1169942400,,411,4.421052631578948
1898258,2,B00009YXB4,"This movie was really bad! It's about huge killer spiders. The plot is tired and cliche, the characters are the same and the special effects are low budget. It's so badly made, it looks like a student film or something. It's hard to believe that people still make movies this horrible. The only reason I gave it an extra star is because it's so cheesy that parts of it are funny. Unless you are a big fan of bad b-horror movies this is not worth watching. Even the lesbian scene between the two hot girls is not enough to save the movie and they can't even play believable bimbos! This is good for a laugh or a 'bad movie' party but other than that I doubt I could find a reason to watch it again. It's not bad enough to be a 'so bad it's good' movie and not good enough to become a cult classic. It's not great as a scary movie either because it's way too laughable and fake looking to scare anyone!",1169078400,,900,4.148571428571429
1898259,3,B00009YXB4,"But, if we did, ARACHNIA would be the second or third movie on the screen.

Yes, it's pretty terrible.  The stop-motion animation of the spiders was oddly refreshing in an age of CGI-crazy SFX.

I wish the movie had had more of a sense of humor about it.  Not some lame SCARY MOVIE stuff, just some straight-faced winking like the bad drive-in horror movies I grew up on (such as PIRAHNA and the king daddy drive-in classic, HUMANOIDS FROM THE DEEP).  They weren't great movies by any means but they delivered good times: cheap scares, rubber monsters, nudity.

I've got to be honest: two of the three stars are for Alexxus Young, the ""sci-fi diva"" who has her own website.  She looks great naked and I commend her for surviving a plane crash into mutant spider land and immediately wanting to strip and bathe.  That's the kind of B-movie heroine that makes me stick around for the worst of movies.

I also liked the female lead, a beautiful African American girl who takes charge and completely avoids all stereotypes.

This is a bad movie but it would've been fun on a drive-in screen.

But we don't have drive-in theaters anymore.",1161388800,5,1133,4.615
1898260,1,B00009YXB4,"This is the worst film I've ever had the misfortune of viewing, and this is coming from the guy who gave CHUPACABRA TERROR 5 stars. This film deserves -5 stars.

 Some bad CGI meteors knock a plane full of brain-dead college students out of the sky and causes it to crashland in the middle of nowhere. The dimwits inside leave and wind up in a little shack belonging to a crazy old farmer.

 Next thing you know, giant spiders start popping up every few minutes.

 The stopmotion used for the spiders looks to have been done by a four-year-old. The script appears to have been written by a six-year-old. The actors have the talent of a deaf chimp, and put about as much energy into their roles as a sloth.

 This film also rips-off many other better movies such as EVIL DEAD and ALIENS. The DVD transition is mediocore at best, but at least the special features include three trailers and a making-of featurette. But these aren't enough to make up for this beyond-horrible piece of cinematic trash.",1155686400,2,998,4.567415730337078
1898261,1,B00009YXB4,"10 Fangs, 8 Legs, 2 Claws, no hair

1898262,3,B00009YXB4,"In my hometown, there's a little greasy spoon which specializes in burgers.

The burgers are nothing spectacular.  They're about the size of White Castle burgers and you can get four of em for a little less than two bucks.  They're fast, they're cheap and most people would probably call em godawful.

But here's the thing.  They taste great and me and a whole lot of folks keep going back because, when you get one, you know exactly what you're going to get.

""Arachnia"" reminds me a lot of those burgers.  It's fast, cheap, and you know exactly what to expect from it.  That's why it's surprisingly good. Maybe it's just the fact that I recently caught this film on latenight cable and, as a result, came to it with vastly lowered expectations. Nevertheless, I was shocked at how much this film DOESN'T suck.

Granted the special effects(and I use that term loosely here) are strictly of the 1950s horror film variety, the hokey script offers nothing you likely haven't seen before in dozens of giant bug movies, and the acting just barely rises above that of a better than average high school play.

But if you're a fan of Ray Harryhausen-style stop motion animation, seeing it used in a 21st century film, can't help but tickle the nostalgia bone and frankly comes off as kind of sweet.  And the script is enjoyable precisely because it IS so damn predictable.  And the acting, though high school level is nowhere near godawful.

There are too big reasons to see this film, the first is Rob Monkiewicz as the film's hero, a pilot for hire with a heart of gold.  Other reviewers here have pointed out that Monkiewicz comes off as a little too smart for this movie, almost like a law school student slumming for some extra cash to pay off those huge student loans.  It's a valid argument but this actually works in his character's favor by painting a portrait of a smart guy who maybe made some bad choices and is now just trying to keep his bills paid.

The second reason is Irene Joseph as a no nonsense personal assistant who actually turns out to be the sharpest AND toughest character in the film.  Joseph, incidentally, is African-American but the film's script and her performance wisely eschew any of the hackneyed, over the top ""sista girl"" mannerisms and slang that are seen all too often in African-American characters in movies of far bigger budgets.

While the total budget of this film probably wouldn't even buy a day's worth of catering on Peter Jackson's ""King Kong"" it's always impressive when a director makes movie work even on a shoe string.  While I don't think I've seen any of Brett Piper's films prior to this one, I'm now interested in checking more of his stuff out.

Arachnia is far from a classic.  In fact, I don't even know if I can recommend buying it to any fan operating on a tight budget.  But if you've got a little extra dough burning a hole in your wallet you could do far worse.",1151280000,2,2919,4.573076923076923

The script is infantile. The special effects (monsters, explosions, and so on) are amateurish. Those in the film cannot act, at least not in any believeable fashion. Indeed, it was a very poor choice of actors. Rob Monkiewicz is the consummate geek. Irene Joseph is way too full of herself (she isn't ""all that,"" as they say - or, in this case, any of that). Bevin McGraw contributes nothing to the film. Dan Merriman is one strange dude, actually distracting from the film. Ultimately, the only mildly interesting scenes were those with Alexxus Young in various states of undress, but even those are nothing to shout about (she isn't that good looking and she certainly can't act). In other words, I can't think of a single reason for anyone to buy this film.

There is also Monster Island, and Marbutao which i'm not sure is avilable. Monster island had  a good plot but very cheese special effects and not alot of action.

This threat mixed with romance would have made the movie better. I would actually give the movie a 2.75 score. The two dimwits got on my nerves. One of the many comical moments was the prfessor turning around in digust and telling them to shut up. It would not have taken much to have made this a better movie, but apparently someone ran out of money.

These two (played with horrible abandon by Bevin McGraw and some unnamed starlet) are a hoot to watch, they are definitely el stupido.  (Their lesbian scene is unnecessary, but not surprising!).  The spider monsters are fine, when viewed from a distance; only when there are close-ups are they obviously fake!  But Rob Monokiewicz as the studly hero is fun to watch; he looks like a law student, but his quiet understated performance should have gotten him more roles.  Irene Joseph as the professor's assistant is pretty fun, too.  Dan Merriman as Deke is awful, but not to the point of absurdity.  Brett Piper directs with his tongue in his cheek, and ARACHNIA, though not a classic, is a fun time passer.",1079395200,2,855,4.855172413793103
1898269,4,B00009YXB4,"During a meteor storm, a large meteor explodes on a mountainside and opens a system of caves.  The explosion also causes the crash of a small airplane carrying an archeologist and some of his students.
It is cold and dark and they are far from any sign of civilization but get lucky when they find an abandoned shack.  Huddling in the shack leads to a gratuitous bath scene and then introduces a new character; an old man who owns the shack.  He takes the survivors back to his house and they make the discovery of the giant arachnids (but not until after a gratuitous lesbian scene).
The spider-like monsters need to be stopped.  The are social creatures and not loners like true spiders.
In the end things work out in a fashion as these movies usually do.  The acting is not as bad as others have said, but it would have been nice if the casts ""beauty"" was actually pretty.  The old man is a hoot and the archeologist is fun to hate.
The creature are done in a marvelous stop-motion style (with some full scale models) reminiscent of The Black Scorpion.  The critters are good, ut the sets are obviously small models.
Fun in the B-Movie style and sure to please fans of cheesy movies.  A body ripped apart and plentiful nudity make this one unsuitable for some.",1075161600,2,1263,4.4847161572052405

7994448,5,B00009YXB4,"Ultra-cheeeze-meister, Brett Piper's ARACHNIA (2003) opens w/ Professor Munkford (David Bunce) and his college students: Chandra (Irene Joseph), Trina (Bevin McGraw), Kelly (Alexxus Young), and Deke (Dan Merriman). They're on their way by plane, to investigate a newly found specimen. A strange meteor causes them to crash-land safely, thanks to their pilot, Sean (Rob Monkeiwicz). Totally lost, the group happens upon an old farmhouse. As the evening progresses, it becomes evident that: #1- The professor is a bit of a creepy pervert. #2- Trina and Kelly are beautiful, brain-deprived, and only speak whine-ese. #3- Chandra and Sean are the only two, aside from the detestable professor, who could possibly count past twelve. When Mr. Cobb (James Aspden). the owner of the property returns, he has something interesting for his ""guests"" to see in the barn. Heavens above! It's an enormous, cow-sized arthropod carcass! Then, a living version of the monster is sighted! In no time at all, humongous horror crawls forth on segmented legs! This is where Piper's use of stop-motion and practical creature fx shines! I haven't seen him use them this effectively before. This is easily his best film since BITE ME! This is one big ball of cheeeze-corn fun! Jam-packed with: Arachnoid action! Humorous hilarity! Unnecessary nudity! Annnnd- Guns! Dynamite! A chainsaw! Molotov cocktails! Annnnnd- The final reveal of just what has caused the sudden population explosion among giant bug monsters! HINT: Think ALIENS. Annnnnnnnnd- One VERY low-rent military response! Have no fear! There's nothing serious here!...",1521417600,,1606,5.428

A soft porn lesbo scene and a bunch of idiotic moves from everyone.  I would just skip to the end and watch the fight after the army shows up and call it good.

At 30 minutes or so, the movie grabs the coveted R-rating bared ta ta's.  But as the movie wore on, it kind of grew on me, especially the female lead.",1508457600,2,319,4.015873015873016
