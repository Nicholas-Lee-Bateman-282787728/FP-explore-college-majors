8210066,4,B000TLTCW2,"My little girl stumbled on Care Bears and fell in love with them -- the old ones. I tried to watch the newer version with her, but Dark Heart was too scary. This is one of the older (original) versions. We bought this together with Forest of Feelings and Sharing in the Sunshine. Forest of Feelings sort of bombed, but the other two are still requested pretty often. We have satellite TV and lots of kid DVDs and Blurays and she still requests this one and Sharing in the Sunshine once every few weeks.

If these original versions were available anywhere else, I might say save your money. But at rental places and online, I was only able to find the Dark Heart ones, and that just wouldn't do.",1358899200,,694,4.37984496124031

I know there are many Care Bears DVD's listed on Amazon with no episode lists.
This makes it hard to know what you are getting!
I've decided to help organize your collections by providing dates and  Episode Lists.
