8585605,4,B00CS7PIB4,"This is a collection of five National Geographic documentaries. A variety of topics are included. Some interest me more than others (I like ""Forces of Nature"" best), but you can decide for yourself whether you're interested. If you do decide the topics interest you, I can report that you will have a mildly entertaining and informative viewing experience.

The most important thing to note is that these are not feature films - each film is only 40-45 minutes in length.

I believe these documentaries were originally filmed for large format theaters, such as IMAX. I have an IMAX dome nearby at a local science center, and I remember some of these films playing there. The good news is that because these were designed for large format venues, on home video they have an aspect ratio of 1.78:1. That means if you're using a standard widescreen TV the image should fill your entire screen (no black bars).

Video and audio quality on these discs are generally good. These movies were funded by multiple partners, one of which is National Geographic, but they didn't have huge budgets... so expect a few flaws in the image (many of which are part of the original product, not a result of the blu-ray transfer). For example, ""Flying Monsters"" has some computer generated creatures - and I'm sure you'll agree they aren't particularly well done and the CGI seems a bit outdated, but it still works.

This is a nice box set, but keep in mind that four of the five docs are also available for purchase individually, except for ""Wildest Weather in the Solar System"" - this is a new documentary exclusive to this set.",1376697600,7,1611,4.742857142857143
