3011074,5,B000Y11BBW,I enjoyed both movies so much.  Am glad that I was able to get both of them together.  A great buy and fast shipment.,1319068800,,117,3.8333333333333335

3011076,4,B000Y11BBW,"It took me til 2010 to finally see this film.  It's a very good study in human relationships, but not much on human-horse issues.  A few, just not much.  What happens at the very end to subdue the horse, is what Robert Redford's character should have done at the very beginning!

It runs too long, that's a bit of a bore.  And the horse is traumatized by the girl, not a situation, which I found very odd.  She didn't do anything to traumatize him, they were involved in an accident.  He would not have associated that with her, she would be a comfort image for him, so that was askew.

Girl's mother is a strange bird, the Daddy is very dull.  No wonder Robert Redford's character looks so attractive.

Despite the length & the misfirings on the animal-human connection, it's a watchable & entertaining movie.  Scenery is breathtaking.",1297123200,,836,4.581081081081081

3011091,5,B000Y11BBW,"I Am a Horse Lover since childhood. Loved goin to my Cousin's house in the Summertime. They had Horse's need I say More... Older now still get Excited when I am Around those Beautiful Equine's anywhere I go. I have 2 grandkids. My youngest has developed a  Love for those Majestic Equine's. She has been taking horseback riding Lesson's this summer. My oldest Grandson is goin into high school in less than a month. He made 1st Chair in Band w his Trombone . His future in Band looks great. Awesome movie for him to watch and Learn. As for the Movie's The Horse Whisper Awesome. I would rate it a Thousand Star's. But I am Partial ! Just for the  Love of Horse's. Cutting edge real stuff from the rehabilitation of the Horse and rider in All Area's. The MAGIC that happens between A Handsomely Rugged Cowboy and a Beautiful Lonely Woman Great storyline. That Scenery was absolutely Breath taking. You could NOT of ask for a better QUALITY of movie.  The other movie was  great As well. Mr Holland's OPUS. Plus 4 stars Over the Top. He had Obstacles on All Sides... But He Persevered and WAS a  Winner. One of the Best Rewards a Teacher Can Receive is Thank You for Believing in Me. Pushing me when You Know there is Greatness inside that Student, and it is Attainable. But When those Students Come Back to HONOR that Teacher it Exzemptlify's ONE's INTEGRITY and CHARACTER of That Person. Give HONOR to whom HONOR is Due. I think I should have ordered 2 movies though. It Probably will be Worn Out Before Christmas. Look for another order real soon. Thanks Amazon You Are The Best !!!.",1469059200,,1584,4.486111111111111

3245614,5,B000Y11BBW,Horse Whisperer is  a compelling storytelling of getting down the road of life.  Ya gotta give.  Ya gotta get.  And sometimes ya just have to have the patience to get beyond what is.  Mr. Holland's Opus can't be beat.  Would be a great school-age social studies project.  Heartwarming and real. Couldn't picture anyone else but Dryfuss and all the frustration and warmth he brings to his character.,1372550400,,398,4.850746268656716

3245624,5,B000Y11BBW,"A music teacher inspires a timid student to continue ""plugging through"" until she can achieve that difficult ""clear"" note on the flute.  The compassion he extends during this difficult time for her is well rewarded in the progress she makes. See how it all develops.  The wonderful, surprise ending brought tears to my eyes. If you enjoy music, this is a ""must have"" because you'll certainly want to play it over again.  You can purchase the DVD at Amazon.com.",1352678400,,460,4.7974683544303796
