Wow, less than 2 hours after I posted the list, the product description suddenly is updated to show which films are included.  I actually looked for that information in the weeks leading up to the release.

Let me also point out some of the films that are NOT included in this set or the Season 1 set.  These include: The Announcement, Catching Hell, The Fab Five, The Marinovich Project, The Real Rocky, and Unguarded.  To get these 6 films you must purchase the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ESPN-Films-30-for-30-Film-Favorites-Collection/dp/B008QE9YDQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ESPN Films 30 for 30: Film Favorites Collection</a>.  That set also includes 6 movies that are already included in the Season 1 set, so you'll end up with duplicates if you want them.  Also, be careful when ordering any of these sets.  The Film Favorites Collection includes reviews from several different collections of these films (the Season 1 full set in both DVD and Blu Ray and the Film Favorites Collection) but you won't see which set the review is from unless you click on the reviews for a specific number of stars (1 star reviews, 2 star reviews, etc.).  Read the product description carefully since they've repackaged these films into several different collections.",1387152000,80,2112,5.148367952522255
