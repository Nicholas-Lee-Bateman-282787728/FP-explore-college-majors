6797765,4,B00PCSVM6G,"OMG what a way to get a date LOL

I really enjoyed this movie; some of the lines are killers (no pun intended) and it's well written and directed.
It's to the point, got good production values, decent acting and it's well paced.

I have to say though the hero of the movie is a real cheapskate. Damn, this poor soul saves your life from a spirit possessed killer and all you're gonna give him is a dozen ice cream cones or hotdogs!? Hey what kinda s*** is that, I'd be like, uh I saved your stupid ass, I want 50% on every new condo unit you sell ya cheap son of a b****...........sorry just had to get that out of my system.

6797766,1,B00PCSVM6G,"I love budget horror films and hate to bash movies but this was just awful. Horrendous acting and effects, and an ending that will just leaving you sitting there with your head cocked to the side. Want some decent B horror, check out Billy Club or The Butchers. They're a little silly but a lot of fun !!!",1424995200,4,305,4.275862068965517

6797768,4,B00PCSVM6G,"The film starts with a great period montage from past that sets up the story. Have lots of fun with a bucket of popcorn watching and waiting for the jolts.  The pace is brisk and moves fast, with ups and downs like an amusement park roller coaster.",1424908800,2,248,4.276595744680851
6797769,4,B00PCSVM6G,"There were some funny moments and scary moments to this movie... overall everything you'd expect from a classic B-horror film, cheesy lines, acting, etc.",1424908800,,153,5.416666666666667
6797770,1,B00PCSVM6G,Only thing that could improve this movie is making it a silent film... worst.cast.everrr  directing STINKS so all that end commentary has to be the contingency clause for getting paid!  I couldn't sit through it without forwarding through and it was part of my prime stream.  Not even a Hail Mary can help this one,1424304000,6,314,4.672727272727273

6797776,1,B00PCSVM6G,"I read the reviews after only seeing part of the movie. I completely agree with all of the one-star comments except...in my view it was SO bad it was really hilarious, and I laughed until I couldn't stand it anymore and turned it off. Too bad it wasn't in Mel Brooks' hands, he could've done something with it!",1455926400,,310,4.362068965517241
6797777,2,B00PCSVM6G,"I really hate giving bad reviews, and I only take time out of my busy life to do it, if 1.a B rated flick is AWESOME enough to definitely recommend (these diamonds in the rough are truly rare here on prime) or 2. They are SO  BAD, I feel the need to warn the viewers of the waste of time they are about to experience. I always try to give the benefit of the doubt to the film makers. I often picture a group of 13 year old boys sneaking off with their dads equipment to make a REAL movie, but in THIS case, (when the film is followed by commentary from the cast, crew, and director who all appear to have written it in their spare time dwelling in the convalescent home in Kentucky) my excuses are shattered, and adults are actually to blame for releasing something that should have gone back to the drawing board. The beginning was actually pretty good (the period flash back, where the furious farmer casts a curse on the wicked land thieves  after they've murdered his innocent wife and 2 children), but the continuity ends there and it almost seems like the rest might have been written by someone else. If you want to watch a decent film that has the same feel but is actually well done, I'd recommend The Skeleton Key, with Kate Hudson.",1454803200,,1242,4.32618025751073

6797780,2,B00PCSVM6G,"A haunted house in Brownsville, Pa. exists on a site where an accused witch was hung in front of her husband subsequently killed. It is going to be torn down, but town folks don't like that, saying the ground is hallow. Meanwhile a former residence of the house shows up and a guy in the group was born May 5th.

When the killing starts, there is the question of the killer's identity? will Nicole Alexandra Shipley take her top off? and why did they so obviously set up Maggie as the Final Girl?

The film was 68 minutes in length with an added 14 minutes of the director patting himself on the back. Next time put 90 minutes in the can, and you won't have to take up 20% of the film to convince us it was worth watching.

6797784,2,B00PCSVM6G,"Its a okay watch. The script has some silly lines thru it that don't fit.  The actors some perform well for what they had to work with, but others your like OMG! Really!
But in all is still worth a watch.",1433980800,,204,3.975609756097561

6797787,1,B00PCSVM6G,Everything about this movie is bad. The crew interviews at the end are the best part. These people are either delusional or being pressured into beaming about the film experience.,1428192000,2,179,5.0

6797792,1,B00PCSVM6G,Awful acting. Although the end credits where all the actors and director and staff talk about it like they were making a masterpiece was amusing.,1426204800,2,145,4.84

6797794,3,B00PCSVM6G,"This was not the worst movie I have ever seen by any stretch of the imagination. The acting is a bit wooden, the story is a bit thin, and the set is less than stellar. It did however have me watching even though I knew exactly what was going to happen. And the ending was way to abrupt for my taste.

I didn't have time to even get to know the characters before they started dying.",1425859200,5,381,4.0131578947368425
6797795,4,B00PCSVM6G,"Solid indie slasher, it plays out like a classic early 90's film. The director worked on many other classic horror films like Hellraiser 3, Waxwork and Necronomicon to name a few.
 The movie zips through too, not very long but worth a watch!",1425859200,3,241,4.604651162790698
6797796,1,B00PCSVM6G,"wow.... HORRIBLE  movie lol. I enjoy B movies, low budget horror, but this one was horrible. I will be honest I did not even finish it, it was so bad. Turned it off after 40 mins. The acting was so bad, it was almost a joke. I love Halloween themed horror movies,and have seen MANY !  low budget ones that were great !, and  I was looking forward to this but it was just terrible",1425686400,3,379,4.026666666666666

6797798,5,B00PCSVM6G,"I loved the story behind this movie. It takes place in Allegheny, Pennsylvania. It reminded me of the older 80's type of horror flicks where there were many surprises, and suspenseful flash scenes without all the crazy gore you see in modern horror movies. Great movie to queue up on Halloween!!! Was well worth watching from beginning to end. I can't wait for the sequel!!!",1425340800,,374,4.769230769230769
6797799,2,B00PCSVM6G,The acting was bad and the story was weak.  I would not pay money to see this film.,1425168000,2,83,3.611111111111111
6797800,2,B00PCSVM6G,"This film features some decent actors, but it's a horror movie in name only. Strangely, it does have a lot of elements you won't find in a microbudget b-movie of it's kind. Good directing, good camera work, a good set, decent practical special effects... However, for me, It completely lacked any scares, thrills, spooky moments, and/or chills, despite the imposing DVD artwork. But, it is currently free on Amazon Prime, so might be good for a lazy day off.

That said, and really for serious films buffs and film school students, especially budding cinematographers, at the end of the movie there is a roughly 10-15 minute vignette about the Director of Photography on the film that might be worth your time. In fact, I really found that more interesting that the movie itself. Kudos to the filmmakers for including this added feature",1425081600,2,836,4.887323943661972
8687566,1,B00PCSVM6G,"This would have been a good movie, if it had actually been a movie!  WTF!  This was ridiculous, it was getting good, and had me trying to guess what was going on, and what did they do? They quickly ended it, and left about what I thought would be 15 more minutes expecting a twist, when all it did was having the producers tell us how great they were.
The stupidest thing I've ever seen.
