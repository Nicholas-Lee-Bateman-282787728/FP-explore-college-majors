3622583,5,B001H29FDS,Good movie and very good acting by all actors. Seems so natural. The ending is left to the audience to have their own opinion.,1360972800,,126,4.291666666666667
3622584,4,B001H29FDS,"I was excited to finally watch this film and it definitely lived up to my expectations of it. A great story with minimal flaws and shot beautifully , in the style of woody Allen's manhattan. Glad I purchased this.",1359849600,,213,4.487179487179487
3622585,5,B001H29FDS,This movie totally kept me entertained.  I thought the story and the acting were original and inventive.  This guy Scoot McNairy is under used in other parts I've seen him in.  I actually had to watch it again.  Everybody was so believeable in their acting.  I wish there would be a sequel--what happens to Vivian?  Her and Wilson can't just never see each other again.  Jacob and Min--who knows?  This was a good stuff.,1355788800,,420,4.581081081081081
3622586,5,B001H29FDS,"This is a great movie. Unpretentious, fun, a little sad at points. It's an uncheesy look at relationships and loneliness. It's well-written and directed, and the actors are great. The movie has such a great flow, and comes across so natural. It feels very real and the characters have such depth. One of the things I love about this movie is how it shows L.A. It's a character in the movie as the characters explore downtown L.A. I never knew L.A. even had a subway until I saw this movie (I live on the east coast). It's definitely worth watching!",1309910400,,548,4.49
3622587,4,B001H29FDS,"Cleuer, thovghtfvl indie(definitely an independent)that's uery good at what it is:  romantic comedy.  breathes bits of fresh air into the same ol'-same ol' stale mavdlin new year's eue hollywood premise, with svrprise and sincerity.  lots and lots of dialogve and ironical scripty jibber-jabber; for those opposed to talkies and Whit Stilman-esqve pics, look elsewhere on the .99 cents bin.  charismatic lead performances proue the heart of the story and worth euery minvte; the secondary characters dvbiovsly so-so and rather non-commital, yet forgiuable and easy to ouerlook as their total screen time was probably(thankfvly)chopped in the editing room.  be reminded, again be warned this is for fans of bvdgeted, hand-crafted DIY indie mouie-prodvction a few rvngs higher than a gifted grad-stvdent's final project.  and that is meant in the best possible way - why, the uery dirty trick of making Los Angeles and its cityscape(s) seem attractiue is alone an accomplishment in itself.  the real magic lies with the feeling yov might go away with, that this was more than a mere entertainment for Holdrige, his leads, for the crew, for euerybody inuolued.  chances are In Search of a Midnight Kiss was a labovr of loue.

  great poster, poor choice of image for the DVD box.  great kiss.  go, Scoot.",1305849600,,1301,5.167464114832536
3622588,5,B001H29FDS,Its black and white but its a really lovely story.  Its totally engaging and has an amazing sound track.  Los Angeles actually looks good in this movie!,1278892800,,152,4.592592592592593
3622589,5,B001H29FDS,"This film was the 2008 winner of an Independent Spirit Award - the John Cassavetes award.  It didn't get a long theatrical release, so definitely check it out on DVD if you missed it!

Funny, fast-paced, moving, poignant and beautiful - this is one of the best indie films of late.  It captures perfectly the feeling of living and dating in this day and age. Midnight Kiss is also one of the few films I've seen that manages to convey both the male and female points of view, in a very truthful and funny manner. The actors are all fantastic, in particular the expressive Scoot McNairy and the lovely Sara Simmonds.

This is what every independent film should be - unique, engaging, laugh out loud funny and tear-inducing as well. I was never bored and left wanting more. The audience I saw it with included twenty-somethings on up to people in their 70s, and everyone raved about it afterwards - amazing to see a film connect with so many people from different age groups.  Check out the DVD and see why critics and audiences alike raved about this movie!",1240876800,6,1056,4.5661375661375665

8307674,5,B001H29FDS,arrived in great condition and played with no skips or problems.,1466208000,,64,4.909090909090909

8307676,5,B001H29FDS,"OK, so I need to give this movie some love; it is new year's eve you see - and I do bring it out every New Years Eve!  As I read somewhere, its a love letter to LA,  and a period piece too -  the opening-scene technology - ha!.  As a fan of indie movies, I appreciate what the creators did with what must have been a small budget.  Ahh, I'm not too old to remember the promise in that midnight kiss...",1451520000,,401,3.841463414634146
8307677,5,B001H29FDS,Awesome story about two awkward people that have trouble finding connections in life and they find each other.  It's a funny quirky love story in a modern setting.  I definitely recommend watching this with your special someone.  It's funny in a warm way.,1446940800,,255,4.883720930232558
8307678,3,B001H29FDS,"Expected it to be a movie that we would watch over and over again, like Love Actually...but will never watch again!  Was disappointed, and really expected to laugh more. In fact, I don't even remember what it was about, who was in it; doesn't say much for recommending this one, does it?  There were scenes where I felt either extremely sorry for a certain character but I really don't remember the plot or story-line; and to me a great movie is one where you can remember characters, lines, scenes for years to come...and can hardly wait to watch it again.",1424131200,,557,4.56
8307679,5,B001H29FDS,"I saw this movie in a theater when it first came out, and it's definitely one you should see on the big screen. When Wilson and Vivian are standing on the stage in the deserted theater, and they're looking out at all the empty seats--the emotional atmosphere would get lost if you're watching that on a small screen at home. Likewise for the shot when they're looking up and see the birds fly out of the giant clockface--it's got to be a big image.

By the way, don't watch this movie if you're alone on New Year's Eve. No matter what!",1391385600,,535,4.297029702970297
8307680,5,B001H29FDS,"There's a nice factoid at the start about dating sites gaining an influx of new members around New Year and which is the basis for the movie. Wilson, played by Scoot McNairy, is a down on his luck screenwriter who hasn't had a date in years. After some nagging from his friend, he places an advert online for a date when a mysterious and complex woman calls him. In Search of A Midnight Kiss is a film about love, and how two very lonely people can embark on a relationship. The film is set in one day, so we are on a journey with them, learning why they're on the date and about them as people. The only negative is that it's in black and white (although some copies are in colour). It's not obtrusive but the directors comments that he wanted this to harken back to olden day romantic films doesn't really change the fact that the black and white adds nothing to the plot, only taking away. At times it's funny, others it's heart warming and sometimes it's even heart breaking. In Search of A Midnight Kiss is a wonderful, human story that is a journey for the audience and the characters.",1379116800,,1091,4.352941176470588
8307681,4,B001H29FDS,"When's the last time you saw a film in black & white? Paradoxically, the lack of color somehow adds to the realism of this simple story rather than subtracting. Although simple, the plot is anything but formulaic. It is witty and engaging right up to the end, with very little covering of ground you've already traversed in other films. It's not bizarre per se, it's just a different take on boy meets girl. Ever have a whimsical but pleasant transient experience with someone that was brief but somehow deeper than a typical one night stand? It's like that, but with added humor...",1363996800,,582,4.715686274509804
