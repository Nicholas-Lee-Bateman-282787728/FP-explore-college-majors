8671288,5,B00MB2XFW0,"A powerful, yet poignant narrative of the short, unhappy life of Ira Hayes, the Pima Indian who was one of the five Marines and a Navy corpsman, who raised the U.S. flag on Mt. Surabachi, Iwo Jima, memoralized by Joe Rosenthal's memorable photo.

Tony Curtis was fantastic in the role of Ira Hayes, who was treated as an outsider by society as well as his own tribe.  Made in 1961, before such psychological ills as survivor guilt and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were focused on by the military, it is obvious that Ira suffered from both, seeing his best buddy, played by James Franciscus, killed on Iwo Jima while sitting right next to him, and the ensuing stress brought on by the publicity following publication of the Rosenthal photo.  His own tribe rejected him at the end and Ira wound up in a water-filled ditch, dead from acute alcoholism.

The film was based on the book by William Bradford Huie, who also wrote ""The Execution of Private Eddie Slovik"" (the only American sericeman executed for desertion during World War II).

The movie was engrossing and exciting, yet very sad--not quite a tearjerker, but close to it.  After seeing this movie, I recommend Clint Eastwood's film ""Flags of Our Fathers"", which focuses on the same issues, but covers all three of the survivors who raised the U.S. flag on Mt. Surabachi, whereas ""The Outsider"" deals only with Ira Hayes.",1417132800,,1388,4.810924369747899
