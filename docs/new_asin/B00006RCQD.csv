1789944,5,B00006RCQD,"I hadn't worked out for a few months when I found this tape in my garage. When I tried it the first time, I could really feel it the next day! But now it's one of my favorite workouts. The music is terrific (I keep hearing it in my head throughout the day after a workout), and the moves are dance-y enough and complex enough to keep me interested. Richard keeps things interesting by not repeating a lot of moves, which I know is a problem for some people, but it's one of the things I like most. Once I have a routine down, going quickly from move to move keeps me from getting bored. I had done SWEATIN' TO THE OLDIES years ago, but after spending a few weeks with this tape, I'm ordering a lot more of the Blast-Offs, hoping they're as good as this one. If you love to dance and pick up moves quickly or are willing to keep at it till you do, you'll really enjoy this one. I have a blast when I do it, and I do it sometimes five days a week!",1333324800,2,945,3.9789473684210526
1789945,5,B00006RCQD,"Richard is fun and motivational, as always.  There are a variety of musical styles, and a variety of personalities - young, not so young, thin, not so thin, etc.  One of my favorities - it includes 30 minutes of aerobic exercise and 10 minutes of toning.  Perfect for a hectic day.  Thanks again, Richard Simmons!",1322265600,4,313,4.636363636363637

1789947,4,B00006RCQD,"If you want to get in shape or just stay in shape, this is a good video for you.  The music is fun to ""dance"" to and Richard keeps you going. I'm 63 and felt this was just right for me. I'm an outdoor walker but felt I needed a cardio workout as well  and also on those rainy or snowy days when you are stuck indoors.",1272844800,,317,3.716417910447761
1789948,5,B00006RCQD,"Excellent.  I love it. Better than I expected.  Gives you a real workout, you sweat head to toe.  Just what I was looking for.",1245888000,,126,4.166666666666667
1789949,2,B00006RCQD,"This tape is a little fast paced for me, as I need more repetition and better cues to keep up with the exercises. I am holding onto it, because I am hoping that in the future, I will be able to keep up with the pace better.  It does have good music and is entertaining, but I like some of his other tapes MUCH better!  In fact, this is the only tape in that series of three that I kept.  The others in my opinion were much too fast paced.",1201737600,,438,3.8444444444444446
1789950,4,B00006RCQD,"I enjoyed the Mega Mix Blast-off because it was fairly short and great when you don't have much time. As with most Richard Simmons videos, the first time watching the tape is the hardest. This one has a quick weight workout at the end, so your muscles don't kill the next day and you still see great results. I think his videos are such a success because you become hooked and keep coming back for more. This this tape is no exception.",1105142400,11,435,4.317073170731708

1789980,1,B00006RCQD,I had to buy a new DVD player just so the DVD I bought would play. So I ended up spending more money than I wanted to.,1369699200,,118,3.4074074074074074
1789981,5,B00006RCQD,Love all of Richard's  videos. He really gets you moving. I really enjoy the songs in this video and especially the toning  at the end. It is a great 30 minute video.,1364256000,4,166,4.15625
1789982,4,B00006RCQD,"This is the first Richard Simmons workout I have tried, and it hooked me! I don't LOVE the music (a mix of recognizable songs and originals), but it's not bad. I have since purchased a few other Simmons videos and this is definitely the most vigorous. It was a little hard to keep up with the first time, but as with all of his workouts IT GETS EASIER EVERY TIME. And it is fun; I have small children and they LOVE this video.

It is worth noting, that after the warmup/workout/cooldown (about 25 minutes), there is a 10 minute bonus toning workout. You use wrist weights. You could probably use dumbbells if you already have them.",1358467200,,631,4.439655172413793
7972786,5,B00006RCQD,"Arrived quickly and in excellent condition. Fairly easy to follow if you're familiar with Richard's moves. Was a little disappointed that it's so short, but the run time was stated, so already knew to expect that. Good to have when you're short on time.",1492387200,,253,4.7727272727272725
