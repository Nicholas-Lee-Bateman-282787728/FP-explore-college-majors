2652748,5,B000I2J6SC,This game provides hours of fun for your little princess.  She can play with a crowd or by herself!,1170806400,2,99,4.2105263157894735
2652749,4,B000I2J6SC,"Fun for the whole family!  My 4 year-old can play along with her big sister and answer the questions too!  The game can seem a little slow, but it has been fun!!!",1169078400,3,162,4.03125
2652750,1,B000I2J6SC,"My 8 year old daughter bought this game with her own money. She was very diappointed with it.  It only has 1 game and the difficulty level can not be adjusted.  This game should be labeled for 4 to 6 year olds as it does not hold the interest of anyone above that age group.  Fortunately, we found a 100 per cent guarantee of satisfaction on the package and instructions on how to mail it back within 30 days if you are not satisfied.  We were happy to mail it back!  Don't waste your money on this game!!",1168214400,3,505,4.112244897959184
2652751,1,B000I2J6SC,"Since the Disney Princess DVD game that I ordered for my granddaughters (ages 4 & 5 3/4) was backordered, it was very much anticipated as a belated Christmas gift.

The package in which the DVD comes states that there are 250 games on the disk; that is far from accurate.  There is only one game that may have 250 variations as purported but in the past few days as it has been played with, it seems to be very limited in it's scope.

The dimensional graphics & artwork are nice but don't make up for a lack of excitement, actual participation in, or anticipation in the game.

The manner in which a player loses a turn happens suddenly seemingly without fanfare or thorough explantion.  It seems to me that the children who might be interested in playing this DVD game would be better served by using their own game playing skill & imagination on a real board game : or might I suggest Disney's DVD version of BINGO which is way more particpatory & fun?

The girls are already becoming bored (I never use that word loosely) with their Disney Princess DVD game & I do not feel it was worth the money.",1168128000,9,1100,4.394088669950739
2652752,5,B000I2J6SC,"My 7 yr. old daughter got this for Christmas.  She has really enjoyed it and asks to play it multiple times a day.  You can have up to 4 players.  I usually play with her.  All you do is put the DVD in your DVD player, listen to the instructions and use your DVD remote control to play.

Educationally, there isn't much there.  There is some luck involved and some skill involved at answering questions about the princess movies.  There is trivia (answering questions about princess movies), reading lines from the movies correctly, guessing # of items shown game, dancing, and many ""which princes or princess movie does this belong to"" games.  Also there are some suprises along the way...trapdoors, and villains, etc.

This has been a very enjoyable game and recommended for any girl that likes Disney princesses.",1167609600,10,815,4.805755395683454
2652760,5,B000I2J6SC,I purchased this game for my son. He loves playing games and has played a demo version of this on one of his movies. He loves seeing the characters and the clips from movies.,1366502400,,174,4.147058823529412
2652761,4,B000I2J6SC,THE GAME WAS A GIFT FOR MY LITTLE COUSINS AND GRANDCHILDREN AND THE ENJOY IT. I DIDN'T TRY THE GAME UT THE SAY IT'S GOOD.,1362960000,,121,3.88
2652762,5,B000I2J6SC,It was a Christmas gift. The users loved it. It was new and it is a good gift for the Disney lovers on your list. Not just for kids.,1358985600,,132,3.586206896551724
2652763,5,B000I2J6SC,This is an excellent board game for Disney fans and kids who love dogs. My niece lobes this game!!! GREAT PRICE!!!!!,1347494400,,116,4.571428571428571
2652764,5,B000I2J6SC,"My 3 granddaughters, ages 6, 4 and 2 love this game.  There are many variations and it keeps them happy for hours.",1279929600,,114,4.181818181818182
2652765,3,B000I2J6SC,"The first few times that you play this game is really fun but after that questions start to get repeated. I really enjoyed seeing all of the dogs that Disney has had in their movies throuout the years. One thing that I have noticed is that the game tends to give many turns to one person while the next person gets just one. It doesn't seem to be random. Difficulty wise, I would say that small children could have some trouble with it and even adults could be challenged by some of the questions. All in all, I like the game. I just wish the game was a little more fair on turns and that the questions did not repeat so much. I don't think that it is worth more than $10 or $15. Disney has many films starring cats. Maybe they should make that game next.",1255996800,,755,4.142857142857143
2652766,3,B000I2J6SC,"Very fun game, my son likes it a lot. Most of the time though, it does not go back and forth for turns. It gives one player (or the other) many turns at a time.",1217376000,,160,3.6
2652767,4,B000I2J6SC,"For this who enjoyed the trivia game on the ""Lady and the Tramp"" DVD this game is for you.  Here the game play is very much the same except there are bonus mini games, video clues, and some time limit questions which makes it more challenging.  However there is a trial version on the ""The Fox and the Hound 2"" DVD.  So therefore if you already have ""The Fox and the Hound 2"" get this DVD game to complete the set.  Here this game is family friendly to all ages including me.  I am thinking about the Princess Edition later.",1187481600,,524,4.2
2652768,4,B000I2J6SC,"Ever wanted a trivia game that young and old alike can play together?

You knopw there are games that seem so simple for adults and complex for kids. Well I just played with Disney Dogs and had a great time.

Next to Lassie, Walt Disney studios is the greatest doggy film-maker of all time. Every dog from 101 Dalmations to goofy is covered here in trivia.

Its fun and for families & Disney Buffs alike

So dog gone wild for these dogs

2652769,4,B000I2J6SC,"This is really neat. You can choose to play as several different Disney Dogs on this virtual board game. You use your DVD control to choose your dog and also to spin the spinner to see if you can move 1, 2, 3,4 spaces. You earn blue ribbons by answering dog questions that can be from any Disney movie with dogs. There are 2 ways you can play family or expert

(I think it's called). We've played the family and it's hard. And when you get an answer wrong it doesn't tell you the correct answer. It's a little frustrating for our 4 year old, but she does want to play and she knows to stay way from Sneaky Pete's square which makes you loose a ribbon or other squares you might loose a turn. It is a cute game and a must for those who love Disney Dog movies!",1170806400,2,758,4.053333333333334

8143658,2,B000I2J6SC,"This game has worked once, the rest of the time it continues to go through the intro without letting you choose anything or play it. It was fun and my 4 year old loved it the one time it did work.",1404777600,,196,3.8048780487804876

Fun for the whole family! Easy to play, my son was only four when he first started playing this game and he was able to understand and enjoy as well. Great for all Disney movie lovers!",1385164800,,353,4.130434782608695

8143662,1,B000I2J6SC,"This game is ridiculous!  They asked questions about movies that are from 1960.  I didn't even watch them as a child.  It is pretty sad when my 5 year old daughter repeatedly gets the answers wrong and I can't even help her get it right.  They have all the cute puppies from classic disney movies, but they rarely ask questions about them.  Very disappointed!",1376697600,,359,4.546875
