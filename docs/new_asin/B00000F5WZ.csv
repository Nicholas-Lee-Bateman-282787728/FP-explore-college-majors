1208288,5,B00000F5WZ,"Funny, but I must've seen this when it came out, because I was just a kid. But I loved the movie so much I've never forgotten it.

It is the story of a priest (Van Dyke) who has lost his faith and his direction. When a new nun, Sister Rita (Quinlan) comes to town, he is inspired by her energy, faith and a simple love that flows from her & touches everyone she meets. But the only problem is that they are both only human....
There's the great acting by both Van Dyke and Quinlan (Stapelton is nice in a supporting role) and the unforgettable score by Ernest Gold. But when it all comes down to it, this is a love story. And a unique one in a way because it isn't about the usual lust and physical attraction that accompany the average Hollywood love story. These were two kindred spirits that just happen to meet at the wrong place and time and as a result the consequences were disasterous.
It is an all around wonderful movie and really should be on DVD (if they can put all those sitcoms from my youth on DVD, they can put this on DVD too!)

I recommend this movie.",1186358400,7,1070,4.189320388349515
1208289,1,B00000F5WZ,"I recently was a part of the production of this show at my university, and after performing the show and working with it for over 4 months, i was disappointed when i finally watched the film.  The rewrites changed much of the emotional content of the story, and actually made it harder to understand.  Finally, when it comes right down to it, i felt that Dick van Dyke missed many of the traits for the character.  It's an excellent show, and if it's ever being performed in a close vicinity to yourself, then go see it! but the film is not nearly as good.  And also, it's a good show assuming the lead actors understand the roles...since the entire story hinges on two characters, they are extremely important and can either help or destroy the show.

Also, contrary to what somewhat else said, Milan Stitt wrote the play in the 70's, and then rewrote the screenplay very soon after it was a hit on broadway in the same decade.",1179360000,,928,4.4674556213017755
1208290,5,B00000F5WZ,This is one of the great love stories I've ever seen. I've seen this movie in the '70's when I was studying in the seminary and I found it to be compelling and great. I never became a priest though but I'm married to a wonderful woman who studied in a secondary school run by nuns. The actors in the movie are superb and I really love to watch it again with my wife. Could this be on DVD too? I'd really really appreciate it.,1129075200,13,425,4.011764705882353
1208291,4,B00000F5WZ,"Father Rivard (Dick Van Dyke) once dreamed of a life of religious scholarship, but years in a small, economically depressed mining town (in the 1920s) have dulled his dreams. Then arrives the young Sister Rita (Kathleen Quinlan) to teach in the village school. She is fresh and full of life, and despite their deep commitments to their religious vows, the two find themselves falling in love. To make matters **really** interesting, the film opens with Rivard accused of Sister Rita's murder.

This is tight, well-plotted, character-driven drama. Once Sister Rita arrives and the two are thrown together, matters proceed with that measured inevitability that leaves me tense every time I watch. Their story is told in flashbacks, interleaved with scenes of Rivard in prison and, later, on trial. The shifts in time are deftly handled, giving us not one, but two suspense stories to enjoy. (Milan Stitt wrote the play in the 1920s - based on a true story - then, over 40 years later, wrote the screenplay. I find the writing in both stage and film versions compelling.) The film also features excellent performances by Maureen Stapleton as Rivard's housekeeper, along with Beau Bridges as his lawyer, Tammy Grimes, and Ray Bolger.

I've read that this film was condemned by the Catholic Church, but I can't for the life of me see why. There's no bodice-ripping, no devil worship. And if ever there was a movie that tackled - and honored - the heartbreak of faith in the ""real world,"" this is it.

This excellent film should be on DVD.",1114646400,36,1533,4.865900383141763
1208292,5,B00000F5WZ,"I saw this movie in the ""70's with about 13 other people worldwide.  But the murder trial of a Catholic priest for a nun under his care is so lovely and evocative.  And the ending is a surprise.  I remember most that upon leaving the theater I went to the restroom and there was a woman just sobbing her heart out.  She expressed how I felt about the film.  I know it's hard to find, but it's worth it.  Dick Van Dyke is great.",1112227200,21,427,4.023809523809524
7907853,5,B00000F5WZ,"This movie was primarily filmed in Roslyn, Washington. The local people left the stars alone, not bothering them for useless autographs. We all gathered one night to watch the elderly nuns' house burn while the local fire department ""put it out"" -- it was a Hollywood fire controlled by gas jets strategically placed.  The acting was superb and the story mesmerizing!! Two thirds of the audience at the Premier showing of the film in Seattle was comprised of Roslyn and Cle Elum local folks.  This is a most heartfelt movie not to be missed or forgotten.",1458604800,,554,4.760416666666667

7907857,5,B00000F5WZ,"This movie was filmed in the small town I currently live in. My mother was an ""extra"" in one of the scenes. She was ""out on the town"" one evening and was solicited by Jerry VanDyke to do so. I was quite young at that time and have never gotten to see this movie. My mother passed away in 1997 and I would very much like the opportunity to view it. Please, please format this movie to DVD. Thank You, Tammy Damore",1372896000,,412,4.036585365853658
7907858,5,B00000F5WZ,"When I saw The Runner Stumbles, I was already a fan of Dick Van Dyke as a comedian...he completely blew me away with his performance in this movie. I believed what he was going through as a priest, and more importantly, as a human...his conflicting emotions and the nun's feelings for him were heartbreaking. Kathleen Quinlan as the young nun, and Beau Bridges as his lawyer, were excellent and Maureen Stapleton as the housekeeper was simply magnificent. The ending was a shocker, and moved me to tears.

I tried to purchase this movie and found it unbelievable that it's not on DVD!!",1354752000,,585,4.735294117647059

If you are a fan of Dick Van Dyke, you HAVE to see this movie. (If you can find it.) It turns out that Dick Van Dyke is amazing as a dramatic actor as well as a comedian. Not that that was really a surprise.

As I also have issues with the Catholic Church, I found this movie doubly interesting. Dick Van Dyke plays Father Rivard, a priest accused of murdering the nun with whom he's fallen in love, Sister Rita. It's a very compelling story. Sister Rita had been living with Father in the rectory - against the rules - because the other two nuns had developed consumption. Naturally in the 1940s this was unthinkable, even though the rectory had plenty of extra rooms and the convent did not. What I found extremely amusing was when the man the bishop sent to check on them refused to even go in and say hello to the sick nuns. Sister Rita was supposed to live with them, but he couldn't even be exposed for two minutes! Sister Rita lied and said she was living in the convent.

It seemed to me that Father Rivard was taking his role as a priest too seriously, as he started being rude to Sister Rita, first refusing to be seen with her around town and then not even speaking to her unless it was absolutely necessary. But in reality he was going through an intense struggle: wanting to maintain his vows as he realized he was falling in love. And it didn't help that Sister Rita felt the same. This movie is really amazing, with its exploration of human emotions. There are some really interesting emotions with his housekeeper and the townspeople as well.

This movie is not available on DVD (as of 2012) and I doubt it will be, as I see I am only the 9th person to write a review in many years. Luckily the VHS is a pretty good quality, and my VHS is pretty old.",1346544000,,2281,5.126344086021505
7907860,5,B00000F5WZ,"I totally agree, this is an excellent movie and Dick Van Dyke did a great job.  He's always known for his comedies but this dramatic movie definitely left a mark.  I wish this was out on DVD as well.",1294963200,,199,4.076923076923077
7907861,5,B00000F5WZ,"This movie from the 1980s has a great script with a powerful ending. The plot is easy to follow, and Dick Van Dyke is at his best in this dramatic performance as a priest who falls in love and faces a conflict which challenges his commitment to his vows. Kathleen Quinlan also enhances the storyline in her supporting role as a young & energetic nun.  Every movie buff and movie-buff-wannabe should own a copy of this film.",1252713600,4,423,4.4935064935064934
7907862,4,B00000F5WZ,"As if this makes me some sort of expert or celebrity, but, whoo-hoo, I come from the ""real"" town/parish where the events that inspired the play and later the movie actually took place.  Filming ""on location"" in our town/parish was denied, of course. Still as the filming went forward (in another location as we know)and after the film's release the people of our parish were outraged that such sins would be exposed. The publication of the play drew similar, but easily as passionate a reaction.  For such a long time the roots in our community ran deep and strong. The people worked hard and were pious. Loyalty and discretion were expected.  They wrapped themselve in renunciation not only of their sins but of the world at large. The story as it unfolded in real life brought disgrace to a community, a church and a people who had dedicated their lives to avoiding the near occassion of sin. The creation of the play and later the movie threatened the delusion that for years had allowed the parishioners to pretend this terrible thing had never happened. Ultimately the fear of being ""found out"" subsided.  People realized that the location, time-line, characters and roles had all been blurred so well that our parish/town's anonymity was still firmly intact. The facts were blurred into fiction, so it goes. The detail that the inspiration for these works of fiction came from a scandal/crime in our town/church was irrelevant to both the play and the movie.  Protest of  the parishioners and the inevitability of our parents forbidding us (the younger set) to read the play or see the movie only led to our being curiouser and curiouser! They should have trusted that the secret had been kept so well.  We youngsters may have never known the shame and degradation this event had brougt upon the parish/town at one time. The protests only brought the story to light.  Anyone who didn't know about it already was now compelled to dig furiously to find out more. Unfortunately, facts about the real life story of this priest, this nun, this housekeeper, are fairly sketchy at best. Only the bare bones of the story remain. Documents were destroyed. Much information was supressed.  Most of the old timers who would remember the true details of this scandal are no longer with us.  When they left, the secret of what really happened went with them to their graves. But in order to make a more compelling play or movie, writers must take license and add elements to woo us. I will say that it feels odd for me to have such an affinity to something largely because of the threat of scandal and the faint shimmer of the glitter of Hollywood that it brought to our little town, but I think that is why this story still intrigues me. Truly, it was the most excitement the kids my age had seen in the county so far!  So. Long story long.  I think the writers germinated the seed of a real life tragic crime and wove it into a more paltable piece of entertainment.  For my part, I one huge lesson learned was that ideas for art of all kinds can come from anything, anyone, anywhere;even from our innocuous little part of the world.  Could it be that interesting things happen in places other than New York and Los Angeles.  Go figure.",1186444800,5,3230,4.6520210896309315
