Great video of places seldom seen on film, like thee area between Chama and Durango, parts of the Chili Line and etc. This gives a good account of how things were in the middle 50's. These video's were taken on Rocky Mountain Railroad Club fan trip. Enjoy, I sure did.",1358726400,,354,4.298507462686567
