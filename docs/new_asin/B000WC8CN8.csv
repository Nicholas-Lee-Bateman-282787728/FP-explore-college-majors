8548527,5,B000WC8CN8,"In the DVD booklet the Producer Jill Godmilow explains why the filmmakers of Two Laws have been hesitant to distribute the film in any other format besides 16mm. It was shot in a wide angle lens with the camera on the ground, and when projected on a large screen it ""invites us to sit nearby and listen to the conversations"" of small and large collective groups. Over twenty years after the making of this landmark film it became available to a wider audience in 2008 because DVDs allow for easy projection. The style of the documentary is very original because it is made by members of the four language groups around Borroloola in the Northern Territories of Australia. It is a mixture of oral history and reenactments of events as recounted by members of the communities. You can feel a history being patched together, elucidated by each member who is given their own turn to speak. The concept of ""two laws"" is successfully captured because the film is made and owned by the people of Borroloola and not outside observers. There is a law that the aboriginal people follow and a law brought by Europeans which is forced upon them. This is a very interesting and informative film unlike anything I have seen before. The DVD booklet contains lots of additional information like an Intro by Jill Godmilow and an Essay, ""Watching Two Laws"" by Fred Meyers. The special features add to the viewing experience, most notably a short film about the return of a group of islands to the Yanyuwa people in 2006 and an annotated version of the film.",1317686400,,1539,4.682656826568266
