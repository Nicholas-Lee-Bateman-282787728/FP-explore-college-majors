7876167,5,6304653670,"Where is the Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist entire series of 81 episodes on dvd?

So many bad programs are being released, it's ridiculous -- when can we expect this great animated show on dvd?  Please, please, please, please, please......

[...]

Currently over 6400 people have signed the online petition asking for Dr. Katz on dvd.  The time is now.

I have emailed Comedy Central which aired Dr. Katz, and Scholastic which bought Tom Snyder's company that produced Dr. Katz and have not received an answer beyond ""there are no plans to release the series on dvd...""

This is unacceptable -- the world needs the complete Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist series on dvd today!",1126483200,4,679,4.95575221238938
7876168,5,6304653670,"Is this the episode with Dave Chappelle's ""Super Hero"" skit?  That is one of the funniest episodes ever.  A close second is Ray Romano's bit with the Spider!!!",1094774400,,159,4.642857142857143
7876169,4,6304653670,"Episodes 303 (#22) - ""Fructose"" - 10/20/96, and 306 (#25) - ""Guess Who"" - 1/5/97.  ""Fructose"" is hillarious.  Bob Odenkirk, of HBO's ""Mr. Show"", will completely obliterate you with his failed gang-joining attempts and the David Copperfield monologue.  Emo Phillips also shines (I'll never get that train station image out of my mind).  ""Guess Who"" is not as funny, although Jon Stewart is quite humorous with his stomach cancer and emergency broadcast bits.
For anyone who's never seen ""Dr. Katz"", it's a show about a cartoon psychiatrist who's patients are all celebrities.  The couch sessions amount to hillariously illustrated small bits of stand up comedy.  The in-between sessions bits tell a story in the life of Dr. Katz, his lazy son Ben, and his exasperated secretary Laura, usually extremely well written satirical pieces on American Life.
Another thing to note is that although the tape box says 100 minutes, the video is really only 45.  ~$12 is a bit high for 2 episodes, but for the quality of laughs it's worth it in my opinion.
Now if only they'd release a tape with the ""manatee"" sketch... *sigh*.
