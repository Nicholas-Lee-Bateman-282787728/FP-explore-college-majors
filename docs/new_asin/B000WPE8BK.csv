8224874,5,B000WPE8BK,I'v had this dvd 1 month now and I can tell you it's worth every dollar. Hell yeah shows were they recorded at dime bags studio for the hell yeah record ex pantera/damageplan guitarist with brother vinnie paul. the band shows behind the seen there lives and why they play music not for the money but for love of making a kick a$!! record. Theres some live footage of the band electric and acoustic and the making of the video. I won't tell you which video you will have to buy the dvd.,1245196800,,485,4.225806451612903
8224875,5,B000WPE8BK,I have been a big fan of Hell Yeah since their album came out.  This dvd is awsome!  A great mix of both live footage and interviews.  I would definitely recommend it.,1202860800,,167,4.15625
8224876,3,B000WPE8BK,"I am more than a bit dissapointed in this DVD in that there is no live show as I expected there would be. It is a documentary of sorts on how the band got together and recorded the first album. This is more like an exaggerated ""extras"" section of a live concert DVD - with NO concert!!! They need to put out a live show.....and soon.",1202774400,,333,4.0606060606060606
8224877,3,B000WPE8BK,"Hellyeah is an awesome band who's taking Pantera fans by storm.  I saw Hellyeah this past summer on the Family Values Tour, and honestly they were by far the best performing band on the bill.  Even better than Korn.  The DVD tells the story of how the band came together, and how they got to where they are now.  It's nice to have the back story, and to get a look into the personal lives of the guys in the band.  However the DVD could've used a little more live footage.  Hopefully Hellyeah's next DVD will be a straight concert DVD, and not this crap.  Great band, great music, not so great DVD.  Next time guys, just record a live show and put that out instead.  That'd be much more worth while.",1198972800,2,699,4.234848484848484
