8413677,5,B0042GZOR2,Wonderful video about the amazing New York Botanical Garden Christmas train show. Very well done showing the entire process of constructing the buildings from the woods to finished form and large G-scale trains. Great music and everyone's exuberance make for a special time. Also see the official Garden store website for info. First saw on PBS.,1475366400,,345,5.178571428571429
