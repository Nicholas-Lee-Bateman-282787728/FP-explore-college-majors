4861139,5,B005RT5N10,"One of Jeff Goldblum's  greatest performances.

This movie is not a horror film; it is a psychological thriller, and it pulls it off very well. It doesn't rely on scare tactics or CGI, it just makes you think about the possibility of the events being a reality. Jeff Goldblum plays Mr. Frost, a serial killer in a psychiatric institution who has not spoken a single word in 2 years. Kathy Baker plays Dr. Sarah Day, the psychiatrist who gets assigned to Mr. Frost after he chooses to speak to her and her only. Weird events start to happen around the institution and also to Dr. Sarah Day, and it seems that Mr. Frost is involved and he only wants her to be intertwined into his plans. Will she give into this peculiar patient's demands, or will she trust in her theories and medical beliefs?

This is a good movie that has an intriguing plot and has good performances, especially from Jeff Goldblum. I love this genre of film; it is right up there with the movie Copycat that features Sigourney Weaver. So if you like a good psychological thriller, I say give this movie a go.",1412294400,,1077,4.48469387755102
4861140,4,B005RT5N10,"I enjoyed this movie. What was most frightening to me about Goldblum's performance was the likability with which he imbued his character of ultimate evil. I found myself wanting to overlook the wickedness Goldblum's character was instigating, and at times I was actually rooting for him. Scary. I couldn't find this DVD in the States, but I did find nearly all of the movie online, except for the ending. I'd add this movie to my DVD collection if I could find it in a convenient format.",1407628800,,487,4.674418604651163

4861143,4,B005RT5N10,"This is a great little ""B"" flick featuring a very creepy Goldblum as Satan (my favorite performance by him), but it's not worth $25 for a PAL version that you can't view in North America (like this one). It's certainly not worth $57 on an old VHS tape. Someone needs to remaster this for US fans for about $10-$12 per DVD, along with several other 80s gems like Book of Love, Grandmother's House, PIN, and Mosquito--all now either way over-priced on mostly PAL dvds or unavailable.",1372464000,2,481,4.604651162790698

8484356,2,B005RT5N10,"Mister Frost is such a disappointment and ridiculous film because it opens with such intelligence and has such a excellent beginning but falls apart pretty rapidly. Basically it has one of the stupidest story lines for a film. We find out in a excellent beginning that Jeff Goldblum's character is a serial killer with the calm and cool of Satan. That's because he really is Satan. We find this out early on so there is no mystery there about who this guy is and that's too bad because that really could have made for a better story. After a very chilling reveal of dozens of mutilated bodies in his back yard, Mister Frost is sent away. For two years he is in prison and doesn't speak a word. He is finally transferred to a mental hospital where he picks the only female Doctor as the person he will talk with. This is basically the set up of the film and from the beginning you get the feeling you are in for a interesting, thrilling horror story......WRONG!!!!
Story line, plot devices, and dialog all work together to help make this film fail. Even the makeup department can't get it right as hairstyles are so ridiculous on several characters it's very distracting and laughable. But probably the thing that really kills it for me is just the incredibly inept story and the silly juvenile attempt at theological dialog. While trying to convince his Dr. of his true nature during therapy sessions, it comes out that Satan is pissed because the world does not believe in him anymore. Science and logic have taken over for why bad things happen in the world and he wants to change that. So how does he go about doing it.......Sits in a mental hospital having theological conversations with his Dr. while a patient he took control of with his devil powers escapes and shoots a couple of priest sniper style. His ultimate plan is to have his Dr. kill him so he can be reborn or something like that. The whole thing is so stupid none of it really makes sense. Here we have the ultimate evil being since God created man who has the power to create chaos and havoc, who has destroyed men and women and who is the master of manipulation. He chooses to not exorcize his demonic powers on a granular scale, but instead decides to sit and pout it out. I'm not sure how all of this is suppose to make the world believe in Satan again, but I guess it seems logical to Mr. Frost.
So you have this as the main plot while a subplot evolves the Dr. falling in love with this aging, grizzled ex detective who has the most laughable hair piece in movie history. I mean, it's like they went out of their way to find the most ridiculous looking wig ever made, but even with that aside the romance is vey awkward and implausible.
The ending is anti climatic and pretty much goes hand in hand with the rest of the plot being ridiculous. So the Dr. decides to kill Mister Frost finally believing he is indeed Satan. She walks in his room and shoots him. As Satan falls to the ground dying, they pan back on the Dr. and she mumbles something in Jeff Goldblum's voice insinuating that the devil switched bodies and she is now really Satan. The last shot of the film shows her being arrested and put in the back of a patty wagon. Her raccoon headed boyfriend shows up to see her sitting there in handcuffs speechless and looking spacey. The end!
So I guess this is how Satan is going to make his big comeback....just switching bodies, killing one person at a time, jumping into another body, rinse repeat.
One thing I noticed while looking over other reviews is all the comments about how this is Jeff Goldblum's best performance. It's strikes me odd because Jeff Goldblum is one actor who is basically the same character in every movie. Don't get me wrong, I like his acting but it's always the same. He always acts like he has just had ten cups of coffee and rushes around with his dialog and uses the same mannerisms and body language in all his roles. He is a little more toned down in this role but his hand gestures and facial expressions, all the same from Invasion Of The Body Snatchers to Independence Day. He also always gives the same flirty look when trying to charm woman characters.  He is simply just playing the same character over and over with a different name. I just can't see how this performance rises above anything else he has done.
On a end note here, there are so many stupid plot devices I haven't even mention that help make this film a disaster. There are just too many to go into but I'll give one example. During one of the therapy sessions, Mister Frost, in a attempt to make the Dr. believe he is really Satan, takes her ring she is wearing and holds it with his right hand. He then melts the ring into a liquid pool of metal on the floor. Her response....no biggie. She just walks out like it was a parlor trick because, you know, every guy has the ability to melt metal in their hands, lol.
That is just one of the many inept scenes that make Mister Frost a movie to forget. The audience back in 90' got it right and stayed away from this horrible film.",1434758400,2,5065,4.405549626467449
8484357,5,B005RT5N10,"PLEASE SOMEONE RELEASE THIS FILM IN THE AMERICAN ( REGION 1 ) FORMAT.  I have been searching a long time and it is very disheartening to think I've finally found it, only to discover it's a Region 2 version.  This is such an excellent film and it needs to be made available again.  Jeff Goldblum at his best.",1421366400,2,308,4.275862068965517
