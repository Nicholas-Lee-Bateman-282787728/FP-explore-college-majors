8235253,5,B000ZBUJ0A,"I was stationed at Bien Hoa for 1 year to the day. Home of the 90th TFS  Pair O Dice. Hot and steamy everyday even in the monsoons. We had our share of mortar attacks. Base was over run during TET in  1968. Loved to see the 727's land to take our guys home. I never thought my day would come. Life in the town was a challenge for us. Trying to get a cold beer was tough. Water buffalo steak was awesome. Life on the flightline was busy for Crew chiefs,we lost a few F 100's to ground attacks. The Bien Hoa story was complete and interesting. It is amazing how we adapt to life in a war zone. The story brought me back 45 years like it was yesterday.",1360713600,3,649,3.946564885496183
8235254,5,B000ZBUJ0A,"The video is just what its like to be at Bien Hoa AB,The only think you miss is the noise from the planes the air had its on smell and the heat.but its about the men who served there doing a job they were trained to do for there tour of duty. The rocket attacks where often at Bien Hoa and of couse a loss of sleep and the fear of just being in the area.
Its a must have video for folks that want to see what it was like at Bien Hoa",1349654400,,432,3.606382978723404
