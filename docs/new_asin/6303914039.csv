724640,5,6303914039,I gave this DVD as a present to a girl who loves horses.,1142467200,3,56,3.3846153846153846
724641,5,6303914039,"This video was given as a gift to a ""horse crazy"" 5 year old who watches it constantly. She learns something new each time....and very seriously told me yesterday that you couldn't speak to your horse during a ""Pressage"" test. Excellent learning video for kids!",1122422400,10,261,4.822222222222222
724642,5,6303914039,"Entertaining for adults as well as children.  I really enjoyed this video.  Also, my 4 year old niece just loves it!  She gets such a big laugh out of the horse ""going"" to the dentist!  I'm so glad I found it on AMAZON!",1113177600,21,219,4.023255813953488
724643,5,6303914039,"I got this video for my girls (3 and 1).  They both love it!  It's great how this the story is told from the horse's point of view.  It's also wonderful as an adult to watch, I've even learned a few things!  Both my girls are glued to the tv when it's on.",1073260800,18,255,3.7547169811320753
724644,5,6303914039,"This is the best horse video I've ever seen !  My horse-crazy 4 year old loves it so much she wants to watch it every day.  I enjoy watching it as well.  It is the story of a three-day event horse.  It covers basic horse care, training, planning for events, and actual participation in two events.  A winner.",1029456000,54,308,4.241379310344827
724645,5,6303914039,"My (at the time) 16 month old son received it as a loan from a friend.  They're not getting it back.  Previously, he had been into the Baby Einstein series off and on, but never quite got into Teletubbies or Elmo or Barney (thank goodness from Mommy's perspective.)  He has always been fascinated by trucks and machinary.  The first time he saw this he was mesmerized. After a few days, he would point at the box or pick up the tape and try to put it into the VCR himself.  (No oatmeal in the VCR for this one - knows it might prevent him from seeing his favorite).  The theme song is catchy and tends to stick in your brain for weeks.  (Grandma left from a visit and said she could still here it a week later.)
It mixes actions of kids playing with construction equipment (an insufficient warning at the beginning says don't do this at home) and real narration from real construction workers, without any silliness or patronizing tone, make it a palatable tape to sit through again and again and again...",976665600,3,1005,4.429347826086956
724646,5,6303914039,"We originally got it from the local library. That's not good enough, I had to get our own copy.
The I dig dirt song is a catchy tune and during long car rides or moments of tension it is great fun coming up with improvised  variations.
A must for any front loader, dump truck or excavator fan!",964656000,2,293,4.140350877192983
724647,5,6303914039,I bought this for my young grand-nieces & nephews and they loved it!  They even took it to show-and-tell.  It captivated their attention.....interesting for all and a real learning tool for the young  one's.,963187200,,207,5.029411764705882
724648,4,6303914039,I purchased this video for my nieces & nephews.  They watch it over and over. They really love it. They also sing the songs for days afterwords. I would really recommend it as a great gift for young folks.,960508800,4,205,4.256410256410256
724792,5,6303914039,Good movie,1408665600,,10,4.5
724793,5,6303914039,If it's got a horse in it I'll watch.  I truly love this show.  What a super little horse.,1407628800,,90,3.6842105263157894
724794,5,6303914039,"All beginning eventers should see this timeless, uplifting documentary!",1407024000,,71,7.0
724795,5,6303914039,Movie is great for families and is well put together. It gives experienced horse riders an insight without going over the inexperienced horse lovers.,1397433600,,149,5.25
724796,5,6303914039,I loved this book and highly recommend it to any horse lover. You will be mezmerized by the story highly recommend,1367107200,,114,4.476190476190476
724797,5,6303914039,"This is  a great movie, very well done. Is a wonderful family movie with postive elements and a good ending. I hate movies with bad endings and this one is a good one. It may not be a fancy blockbuster with a ton of special effects, but if you like horses you will like this one.",1265932800,,279,3.982142857142857
724798,5,6303914039,My grandson loved the trailers for this video he saw on other DVD's.  He was very happy to have the whole movie.,1251417600,,112,4.090909090909091
724799,5,6303914039,I bought this DVD for my wife who loves horses.  It was a great movie!,1250812800,,70,3.6666666666666665
724800,2,6303914039,"I bought this on the strength of some of the other reviews and ended up wondering what they were talking about. My review is based on the first ten minutes of the movie because I, my wife, and my two little girls who love horses and horse movies, couldn't stand to watch any longer. It really gave the impression of a poorly edited amateur movie - long, everyday scenes with no evident scripted action and little editing. We watch a lot of Hollywood but also independent film-makers and this was just very, very disappointing to my whole family.",1242000000,3,545,4.571428571428571
724801,5,6303914039,"We own a Connemara mare and she is a beautiful little horse.  My two daughters ride her in jumper classes. She can jump like a deer.  She loves to jump and my daughters love riding her of course.  So I had to buy this dvd for them.  Needless to say, they were delighted.  My wife and daughters, and I, have spent many hours at jumper shows.  This film is like a documentary about entering and competing in a horse show.  The star is the little horse with a big heart, Erin Go Bragh the Connemara stallion.  Even I loved this film.",1234224000,,530,4.178217821782178
724890,5,6303914039,"It's basically a documentary narrated by the horse!  You learn what goes into the caring and showing of a horse.  A nice idea that all of us love.  It shouldn't be too long now where we can recite the whole thing from memory.  If you're looking for a movie with a Hollywood plot, this isn't it.  It's more enjoyable than 95% of the movies out there.",1212710400,,349,4.2272727272727275
724891,5,6303914039,"I bought this DVD for my two-year-old nephew who loves horses.  I thought he might be a bit too young for it, but he is totally fascinated with it.  And his five-year-old brother loves it too!  It gives you a very ""real"" look at the life of a horse.",1196208000,,249,4.040816326530612
724892,5,6303914039,"Very good DVD.  I was surprised at how small this stallion looked.  My granddaughter is just starting to get into horses and take riding lessons, and she liked watching the DVD.  Thanks for a quality product.",1190246400,2,208,4.722222222222222
724893,3,6303914039,I bought this for my grandaughter.  She liked it but then again she loves horses.  I didn't care for it.  There is no real story and it tell all about horses.  Its like a documentary.  If you're looking for a good story this is not the book for you.,1187222400,,249,4.0
724894,5,6303914039,"I'm saving this DVD for my grandchild to view. It's an up beat story about a horse and the people who loved him, cared for him and competed him. There is no unhappiness or overwhelming odds the animal or people have to endure to reach their goals. Children will feel good and understand the importance of treating a horse to the best of their abilities. The jumping adds suspense and excitment to the story.",1181779200,4,407,4.513513513513513
724895,5,6303914039,I have a 4yr old daughter. She loved the movie. I enjoied it also.,1179964800,,66,3.7857142857142856
724896,5,6303914039,"My daughter is a horse lover and she LOVES this dvd. It's more like a documentary, not a movie, but really interesting!",1168473600,,119,4.454545454545454
724897,4,6303914039,"My 2 year old grandson, who loves horses, requests this dvd every time he spends the day with me.  He especially enjoys the first part that shows  the horse going to the vets, getting shoes put on him, being bathed and groomed, and the first competition.  He loses a little interest when there is more than one horse event, but still requests it the next time he comes to visit!  He also likes that the movie is told by the horse's perspective.  When I ordered this dvd I was afraid that the narration would be in an Irish brogue, but was pleased that it was not so that it would be easier to understand.",1167868800,2,604,4.2631578947368425
724898,5,6303914039,I am purchasing this dvd for my 6 yr old who has been riding since she was 4. My childs teacher who knows my child love for horses and riding lends her her sons (old vhs) movies and my daughter has watched this particular movie practically everyday since. It was time to get her her own copy.,1148428800,3,292,4.140350877192983
724899,5,6303914039,"From a horse crazy girl to a horse crazy mom raising a horse crazy 5 yr old. This is the greatest video ever. Simple enough to keep the kids attention and informative enough for adults even if they aren't into horses.my daughter has learned alot watching this and it has given her inspiration to compete without having ever been to a show yet. Pay close attention to the special trainer Anns' accent,very odd and I chuckle each time I hear her. I truly enjoyed this video,I only wish I bought it sooner.",1144454400,9,503,4.478260869565218
7854762,3,6303914039,Definitely for small teen girls in love with horses.  Not so much for adults.,1499731200,,77,4.5
7854763,5,6303914039,Warning: NOT a DVD. This is a VHS Video tape! I can't say if the movie is good or not. My movie review based on the experience of others who have seen it. I cannot watch the video without buying a VCR! I'm having the video converted to DVD so I can watch it.,1492214400,,258,3.7962962962962963
7854764,5,6303914039,"Love this video! It is a well done video by someone who knows horses well.  In addition it features an incredible ""Little Horse"". Go Bragh is an amazing athlete and we are blessed to have two of his offspring both purebred Connemaras with their sire's intelligence and athleticism. Thank you yo the Harris family for sharing their wonderful Connemaras!",1484611200,,352,4.966101694915254

7854768,5,6303914039,I was so very excited when I found this movie in DVD format!  I have watched this movie repeatedly since I was in grade 5 (I'm now 22).  I had it on VHS and was extremely sad when the silly VHS player wrecked the movie 4 years ago.  Can't wait to watch it again :),1449705600,,264,3.7636363636363637
