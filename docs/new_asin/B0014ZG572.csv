8256738,4,B0014ZG572,"I am 62 and rather flexible, fairly active but by no means athletic. This is an excellent Pilates exercise video. The slower pace doesn't bother me as breathing, precision, relaxation and control are key in Pilates. I get a better workout because I can focus rather than having to race to keep up. Her detailed instructions are excellent, her grasp of Pilates is top notch. I have done Pilates for years, starting with private instruction as I had pretty severe back problems and am prone to injury. I now live pain free and know when the instruction is good (my body tells me). I highly recommend this video. Only 4 stars because she does her own dubbing and her accent is a bit thick so a bit hard for me to understand but I will keep using it and get used to her speech.",1461888000,7,773,4.375

8256741,2,B0014ZG572,"The product itself was fine, it was just not what I needed. The exercises were too hard for the seniors in our group as they could not get up and down off the floor. Also, the instructions were hard to understand and too wordy. The vendor was great, however, and gave good service and good communication. I would buy from this vendor again.",1408060800,8,340,4.412698412698413
8256742,4,B0014ZG572,I like this DVD.  It is well put together and gave me the basics.  It is very easy to follow and can be done.  I have Rheumatoid Arthritis so many exercises are beyond my ability.  This one is not but yet I feel benefits from doing it on a regular basis.,1264896000,18,254,3.9215686274509802
