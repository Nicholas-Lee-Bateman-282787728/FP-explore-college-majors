8249064,3,B00133QNJ0,"I was kinda hoping that this DVD would play well on a LCD TV, but due to low resolution of the video, I was a little disappointed.  Some scenes were actually out of focus.  The narration of Pierce Brosnan was actually pretty good.  I do think that if the quality of the DVD was sharper I would have enjoyed it more.  Maybe some day they will remaster it to a higher resolution.",1216684800,11,377,4.194444444444445
