3658403,4,B001JNNDRY,"The second disc of ""new"" generation of Columbo movies - after the long-running NBC show got its resurrection on ABC - contains four of this reviewer's favorite installments (""Columbo Cries Wolf,"" ""Agenda for Murder,"" ""Rest in Peace, Mrs. Columbo,"" and ""Columbo Goes to College). Great guests stars (Emmy winner Patrick McGoohan, Helen Shaver, Ian McShane, Roscoe Lee Browne, and Robert Culp, to cite just four), crisp writing and direction, and the always brilliant Peter Falk in the role that won him awards and fame make these four worthy of inclusion with classics during the show's initial run.

The remaining two have their moments (the ""denouements"" in both ""Murder in Malibu"" and ""Unessy Lies the Crown"") and interesting guest stars (Oscar winner Brenda Vaccaro in ""Malibu"" and Paul Burke in ""Crown"") but the stories and the guest murderers (James Read in ""Crown"" and ""Andrew Stevens in ""Malibu"") aren't as engaging as those in other Columbo shows).

Also, Universal still doesn't give the show the respect it deserves: no extras and a poor navigation system, allowing viewing of only one episode before having to restart the disc to click onto the second episode on the two-show disc.

The final indignation to actor Falk is that the company uses a younger picture of him on the cover and poorly ""dyes"" the older image of the actor on the back.

We fans know that the performer that made the shows in the nineties is twenty years older than the one from the 70's.

Regardless of his age, Falk is still the one and only ""Columbo,"" deserving of greater respect.",1235088000,3,1567,4.89811320754717
3658404,5,B001JNNDRY,"The last box set ""1989"" was the return of our favorite detective and pretty enjoyable (I did leave a positive review). But just a year later, now he's in 90s with his traditional 70s attire, it seems to me that killers have developed and ""educated"" mostly in terms of technology and knowledge that killers apply to their crimes. So Columbo has to go with these new stuffs. Yet, he still faces the cases with his experience and his own traditional style. For these high-tech & knowledgable killers, Columbo sets up lots of traps. All these episodes in this box set are a bit over 90 minutes so there are longer times that Columbo spends and talks with people (suspects, neighbors, etc) very very thoruoghly. And I really like this slow yet sure way of solving the mystery step by step. Then again he sets up a trap for each situation, which is not high-tech or far-fetched at all. Instead it is very fundamental yet too deceptive for killers to notice such as his wife's car, surgent's house, that sort.
Just one draw back to me was the first episode. It is good as some sort of a mystery movie but to me it is a bit too hokey and lavish for Columbo. Indeed the actual murder was too cheap at the end. Maybe it was how the 90s started...

So how many more DVDs are we expecting?? According to my research, there are 13 episodes left. So probably two more box sets?? I really want to see them as time goes by. But I don't want it to end.....

Also, though a bit too far-fetched, around this time Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh (Yes, Lethal Weapon) must have been running through the same town as homicide sergents of LAPD. I bet they are not working for or with Columbo......can you imagine a picture?",1235001600,2,1700,4.4281150159744405
3658405,4,B001JNNDRY,"I really went out of way to defend the '89 set and the five stars I gave it.. sadly, that amazing record of every season at 5 stars comes to a close here. The problem is many of the 'bit players' from this set, normally the series' strong suit, often give cringe-worthy performances.. bordering on soap-opera territory. Understand, Falk is always awesome, always, but so many of the hired help here just falter. The cases were generally good but the perps were not always up to the task.

Another problem, not so much with the show but the 'purchase' is the fact I burned through this in 2 days. So, now I'm expected to wait another year or 2 for another set? I think the price point is fair, but with only 6 episodes it all ends far too quickly. They really need to combine these seasons into '89-'90, '91-'92, etc, or release them faster.

Also, there is no way to get from the episode menu screen back to the main menu without ejecting the disc, no 'return to main menu', if you selected the wrong episode or want to watch both back to back, forget it! The artwork is nice, the disc art is bland ('color discs' is all) and there are exactly ZERO extras which is a shame.. there must be a mountain of interviews out there, and in this case I'd settle for a mole-hill.

Still, having said all this, it's a must own. Columbo's main problem is always having the bar so high we expect it to stay there. Who would have thought the best 'cop show' on TV would never feature the star breaking down a door, having a shoot out, or even handling a gun? No matter what he does, it's gold, whether the perps keep up or not.",1234396800,18,1613,4.281967213114754
3658406,3,B001JNNDRY,"I do enjoy the individual episodes on this set of DVDs. What caused me to give the set only 3 stars is the way they set up the DVDs menu. ALL the other Columbo collections have a menu that allow you to Play ALL or play the episode you want to see. But if you choose to play a certain episode when it is over you get taken back to the main menu and get to pick Play ALL or any episode on the DVD. THIS collection decided to leave off the Play ALL option, so you must pick a certain episode to watch. When the episode is over the DVD does NOT go back to the main menu but only goes back to the menu allowing you to play the episode you JUST watched.
  As we always used the play all option on Columbo DVDs we were VERY unhappy to find it missing and MORE unhappy when we found how difficult they made it to even watch the different episodes.",1234310400,13,839,3.9005847953216373
3658407,5,B001JNNDRY,"This new movie collection is so good.  The best episodes of the movie collection, way better than the first one.  Several classics such as Murder in Malibu and Columbo Goes to College. I can't wait for more movie collections to be released.",1234051200,3,240,4.690476190476191
3658408,4,B001JNNDRY,"Columbo is great, we all know that. I will not get into describing the films... The only thing I wanted to add is that this set has only 3 discs not 6 as the Amazon description says. Other than that is awesome.",1234051200,,210,4.023809523809524
3658409,4,B001JNNDRY,"I should begin by identifying myself as a diehard fan of Columbo. I end nearly every day with an episode or two and I'll continue purchasing these collections till I own every episode / movie. Having said that, I agree with a previous review that stated that Columbo belonged in the 70's and should have stayed there. Sure, I guess substandard Columbo is better than none at all, but these later episodes (anything following season 7) pale in comparison to seasons 1 through 7. Weak loose scripts, D list guests stars, MAJOR continuity errors, poor acting and terrible use of music all fly in the face of what the original seasons brought to the table. While I'd rather watch a bad episode of Columbo versus a ""good"" episode of any modern cop show any day, it's still a shame that the high standards weren't upheld.",1233878400,,815,4.627586206896551
3658410,4,B001JNNDRY,"The Old Peugeot, Raincoat, Cigars, even the formula for solving the murders in modern 90s style settings leave you with the impression that Columbo has become a walking anachronism for the genre of golden age of detective fiction.
There are many fans of course (including myself) who don't wish to see any great series come to an end. The proposal of four movies per year of course has worked well. The stories are excellent and generally better than anythng on television anyway.
However, I still believe along with the founder of the original series that Columbo belonged in the 70s and should have stayed there. Columbo is out of place in the modern world of the 90s. Many fans will disagree but I believe that they are not being honest with themselves due to their desire to see Columbo solve more murders. No matter how you slice these shows, they are really just re-hashes of plots already developed and played out in the original series. Now I don't want to boo-hoo this current set. It is wonderful to see Columbo in action again. After all, the smiling face of Ian Buchanan as a ""Hefneresque"" character is fascinating to watch. I love seeing a couple of smart aleck College students get caught, and I am always fascinated by Patrick McGoohan's ability to adapt to various roles while still playing the same personality as ""The Prisoner"".
I know that this series of movies went on for many years and I as a fan, no doubt, will continue to buy every set that comes down the road. ...and speaking of roads, who is the mechanic that has kept that old peugeot running? ...and the big question..Why won't Columbo apply for antique tags for that car to save some money?",1233705600,15,1671,4.648648648648648
3658411,4,B001JNNDRY,"Looking forward to the 'class of 1990' group. A couple of real classics!

3658412,5,B001JNNDRY,"He's back! Everyone's favorite rumpled detective, Lt. Columbo (portrayed with iconic perfection by Peter Falk), returns in this boxed set of some of his more recent mystery investigations.

Universal has been releasing the Columbo - Mystery Movie Collection on DVD. This DVD boxed set continues where the last one left off with installments that were produced in the 1990s. When I initially posted this review, I made an error and listed the episodes expected in the NEXT DVD boxed set, not this one. Thanks to Mike, Tom and Michael Todd for correcting this information.

For some viewers, these latter installments of the dirty-trench-coat-wearing, cigar-smoking sleuth are less satisfying and well-crafted than the original series, but for me, ANY Columbo is better than 99 percent of the current TV roster.

The six mysteries in this boxed set were the last to be produced in the miniseries format, meaning the episodes each run about two hours, while the remaining Columbo mysteries produced were originally shown as one-shot 90-minute movie length specials and are yet to be released on DVD.

Collected here are:

Columbo Cries Wolf (which originally aired Jan. 20, 1990): Two true iconic soap opera actors, Ian Buchanan and Deidra Hall, star in this episode as feuding business partners. Hall ends up dead and Columbo has to use all of his skills to ""uncover"" the crime.

Agenda for Murder (which aired Feb. 10, 1990): Fabulous actor Patrick McGoohan who has wowed fans since the 1960s Danger Man, is also a close friend of Falk's. That's very lucky for Columbo fans, because he has graced the series with some of the most memorable episodes of the series. This time out, he directs AND stars as a powerful attorney who has political aspirations - and a big secret. Soon, a longtime blackmailer is dead and Columbo is matching wits with an attorney who has never lost - until now.

Rest in Peace, Mrs. Columbo (which aired March 31, 1990): In an unusual episode, Columbo is the target in this episode. A vengeful woman wants him to pay for the death of her husband, whom Columbo arrested for murder and whom has recently died in prison. Look out for a classic Columbo twist at the end.

Uneasy Lies the Crown (which aired April 28, 1990): Iconic TV writer-producer Steven Bochco (famed creator of Hill Street Blues) wrote this story about a dentist who does away with a patient - who just happens to be his wife's lover - in a creative way. Look for a couple of fun cameos by Nancy Walker and Dick Sargent who play themselves.

Murder in Malibu (which aired May 14, 1990): A famed romance writer whose engaged to a much younger man (Andrew Stevens) learns that he is only after her money, so she calls off the wedding. Exit the author during an apparent burglary. Brenda Vaccaro guest stars.

Columbo Goes to College (which originally aired 12/09/1990): Columbo is on campus as a guest lecturer on criminology. His visit coincides with the machinations of two rich and arrogant frat boys (portrayed by Justin Rowe and Cooper Redman) who utilize ""remote control"" to kill the professor who's threatened to expel them. The obnoxious killers flaunt their intellectual superiority before the seemingly dull Columbo, who they are stunned to learn is a lot smarter than he looks. Look for the brilliant actor Robert Culp (I Spy), who himself has portrayed a murder in three prior Columbos.

Some of the mysteries yet to be released on DVD include: Caution: Murder Can be Hazardous to Your Health (which originally aired 02/20/1991); The Murder of a Rock Star (which originally aired 04/29/1991); It's All in the Game (which originally aired 10/31/1993); Butterfly in Shades of Grey (which originally aired 01/10/1994); and Undercover (which originally aired 05/02/1994).

Let's hope that Universal continues to release these wonderful episodes, because there ALWAYS will be one more question!",1225411200,292,3891,4.969230769230769

The 1990 fashions, decor and electronic gadgets (fax machine, giant brick cellphone, beeper bracelet) are strange to look at now!

3658631,5,B001JNNDRY,"When Peter Falk returned as Columbo for the ABC Mystery Movies, the writer's began to give us a glimpse of the inner workings of the Columbo mind. We saw police sergeants and other characters give Columbo a sounding board for his theories. We learned that the Lieutenant wasn't a magician; he just paid attention to the details. In the 1950's Dragnet, Joe Friday just wanted the facts. Fast forward 40 years and Columbo just examined the details. The re-birth of the series shows us a Columbo who has aged like a fine wine. There are the same cigar, same raincoat and wife; but with an ever increasing passion for the details. I particularly love his encounters with Patrick McGoohan, who continued to provide a formidable ""Frazier"" to Columbo's ""Ali.""  Obviously, Peter Falk loved the challenge presented by talented guest stars like McGoohan and, in other seasons, Jack Cassidy and John Casavettes. The complete Columbo series is so much fun for everyone - especially the viewer.",1367971200,,981,4.945454545454545

It turns out that I did not have that same problem, although the disc format may have been improved since the original reviews. My remote has two buttons: one says ""Play List"" and the other says ""Top Menu"". It's true that if you push Play List you cannot get back to the main disc menu.

The storylines are boring and since they're movies, they are longer and the set up takes forever...not necessarily a bad thing if the story was interesting. Also, unlike the the series, the movies have a lot of sexual situations which are not intriguing in any way and just look ridiculous. Plus, the 90s style was so tacky--the clothes, hairstyles, interior design... Everyone is trying to look cool but look silly instead. It's like watching Miami Vice today and wondering ""what were they thinking?""

""Columbo"" is a murder mystery television series, starring Peter Falk (1927 to 2011) as Lieutenant Columbo, a homicide detective with the Los Angeles Police Department.

This series popularized the inverted detective story format or ""HowdHeCatchem"" format where in almost every episode began by showing the commission of a murder by a killer.  There is no ""WhoDunIt"" element.

The plot mainly revolves around the killer or killers, whose identity is already known to the audience, and how he, she, or they will be caught and exposed.

Columbo is a friendly, verbose, dishevelled-looking detective (his trademark attire is a rumpled raincoat over a suit and tie) of Italian decent who is consistently underestimated by his suspects.  He has increasingly irritating, pestering behaviour with those he thinks committed the crime.  Columbo has certain unforgettable catchphrases (one which titles this review).

The episodes were broadcast from (1968 to 1978) and from (1989 to 2003).  There were 69 (45 + 24) episodes in total.

This collection contains the six episodes that were televised in the year 1990.  Some of these episodes vary from the format indicated above.  The titles of these episodes and my brief impression of them are given below:

(1) Columbo Cries Wolf: good
(2) Agenda for Murder: the best of the six in my opinion

(3) Rest in Peace, Mrs. Columbo: interesting but unrealistic
(4) Uneasy lies the Crown: good

(5) Murder in Malibu: not very good, seems too scattered
(6) Columbo goes to College: good

The first five episodes had a thirty-second preview before a particular episode began.  I personally did not like this preview and thought it was great that it was finally eliminated by the sixth episode.

In each episode, the screen goes black for a second or two between scenes.

The menu system on this collection can be frustrating.  I've found that the fastest way to get back to the main menu after you've played a particular episode is to begin playing an episode and then press ""top menu"" on your remote.

Finally, there are no extras with this collection (that was released in 2009).

In conclusion, this collection gives you a chance to see the legendary Peter Falk play the equally legendary trench coat-wearing Lieutenant Columbo.  Oh!  ""Just one more thing.""  (I'm kidding! This is another Columbo catchphrase.)

(1990;  9.5 hr;  6 episodes;  1 hr, 35 min per episode;  3 discs;  2 episodes per disc;  full screen)

Columbo as always puts them off guard. Even the other people that he questions think he is a bit excentric. He always was able to find the hard to find clues to solve the crime.

3658741,3,B001JNNDRY,"I'm one of those people who plans to own every ""Columbo"" ever filmed, including even the worst ones.  This collection has some of the best and the worst.  ""Uneasy Lies the Crown"" could have been one of the best in any season.  It seems to be the perfect crime, with a young dentist finding a way to get even with his wife's lover.  ""Agenda for Murder"" is excellent, and reminescent of the earlier series' ""Candidate for a Crime,"" though we get a late introduction of ""clinching"" evidence that makes it not quite the iron-clad case we are used to.  However, re-watching the episode shows us clues that were there all the time, had we noticed them.

""Columbo Goes to College"" gives us a chance to laugh at two smart-alec kids who, throughout the episode, we know will finally get theirs, and who give us a mocking impression of Columbo that even offends him.  ""Rest in Peace, Mrs. Columbo,"" though designed as a gimmick to get more people to watch, actually has some crime-solving expertise that is worthy of ""Columbo.""

The set, as usual, is poorly and disrespectfully distributed to die-hard fans of Columbo.  It is hard to navigate, lacks special features and interviews, and is pretty plain vanilla, though we are, at least, spared the pathetic two-sided DVD's of earlier seasons.  I guess they know we will buy these for the sheer joy of watching Columbo, but really wish they had added some special feature to please the fans.

Anyone who loves Columbo will be pleased, at least, with the episodes, which are well-reproduced from a good source, with good sound and picture.",1295049600,15,1577,4.73992673992674

But who cares? We all love Columbo.",1271116800,,172,4.580645161290323
3658759,5,B001JNNDRY,"I've been a fan of Columbo for ever. This series of older episodes is an awesome reminder of how unreal TV can be. Columbo, as usual, focus on ""unreasonable doubt"" to close his cases. There is always very little evidence to convict the criminal but Columbo offers a theory and they start confessing! (lol). Now, that will never happen in real life but the annoying manner in which Columbo pursues a criminal is entertaining at the least.",1269388800,,437,4.688311688311688
3658760,5,B001JNNDRY,For those who have been wondering when the next Columbo Mystery Movie collection will be released: I contacted Universal Studios and asked if there are any plans for future releases of Columbo.  The answer was no:(,1265241600,5,214,4.944444444444445
3658761,5,B001JNNDRY,One of my favorite TV shows - so glad to get it so I can play it anytime,1264550400,,72,3.0555555555555554
3658762,4,B001JNNDRY,"I have more than one set of Columbo, this my most recent.  Each show is fun to watch for the actors involved and the mystery scripts. Production values abound. The picture quality is very good and the audio is on a par with the quality of the time.

The only thing I don't like about this set is the way it was set up for the dvd.  There are 2 episodes on each disc.  Why isn't there an option on the menu to PLAY ALL?  When an episode finishes, the dvd reverts back to the menu just for that episode and when you press top menu, it still doesn't go to the main menu so you can select the other episode. Also when you press Play for a particular episode, you must also press Play again to get into the episode.  The only purpose for that (according to the dvd) is so that you can select a language but the language setting could have been set up on the main menu for both episodes. I suspect that there is a software programming economy in setting up the dvd in this way so that the customer has to press more buttons than necessary.  Really, this could have been produced better. I have noticed this with certain dvd sets - NYPD Blue being another.  The customer can't sit back in the chair and watch the whole thing uninterrupted.

Content very good, dvd production needs work.",1260921600,,1279,4.230452674897119
3658773,5,B001JNNDRY,"I thought I had all of Columbo's DVD and  was pleasantly surprised to find this one.
Have enjoyed it very much.",1258070400,,111,4.285714285714286
3658774,4,B001JNNDRY,"I will not discuss the content of this collection. The odds are that anyone who is on this page loves Columbo and knows Columbo. This is a given and me discussing the greatness of these movies (I believe that these are considered TV movies, not 'series') would be preaching to the converted. I am only writing this to caution future buyers that the quality of the disks falls somewhere between miserable and unacceptable.

'Disks 2 and 3' were freezing and skipping the first time I tried to play them. They are both scratch-free and it have no fingerprints. This is a player that has no problem with some of my daughter's scratched and handled by kids hands Disney movies. I am very disappointed and, whatever money-saving deal Universal might have struck with some cheap off-shore DVD maker, this is not going to earn them a lot of good will. I wish I could say that maybe I was out of luck with this set but I know of other Columbo sets that had this exact same problem.

I will keep this set and learn to live with the defects because I'm such a sucker for Columbo and because it's too late to return it now but I will be watching for Universal DVDs and I doubt that I would be buying too many old 'series' in the future if they are Universal productions.

I suggest that anyone who buys this set play it from beginning to end immediately and then play it again and return it, requesting an exchange if they skip and freeze.",1257465600,3,1428,4.401515151515151

3658777,5,B001JNNDRY,"Age has imparted a merry glint to his shrewd, once severe squint, but this Columbo is just as relentless and ruthless as his younger personae.  Unlike the 1989 collection, in which the character had taken on a bumbling, semi-comedic demeanor, this series plays it as straight as the original.  The over-the-top theatricality is also gone, and the emphasis of each episode is back on Columbo and his solving of the murders at hand.  Though some of the plots have more twists and turns than the 70's series, the stories are basically traditional Columbo and should please all but the pickiest purist.",1251676800,5,598,4.900990099009901
3658778,5,B001JNNDRY,"I bought this along with the 1989 movie collection as well as seasons 1-7 for my dad for Father's Day, so this is his review. The set is excellent. Columbo just as you remember him - only in better quality video and audio! For those of you who don't know, Columbo was THE detective show before the likes of Law and Order and NYPD.

Where else can you see how the crime is committed at the beginning of the show and then sit back and enjoy the detective at work trying to puzzle it out!  Anyhow, I've been particularly waiting for this collection to come out since it has the episode where Mrs. Columbo is the target of a killer!  I remember watching it several years ago on TV but missing the ending so I've been very anxious to watch this again!

3658785,3,B001JNNDRY,they came out with the next installment of the series.  one thing only i didn't like and that is once you start an episode and even at the end of an episode you cannot access the main menu.  you have to eject the dvd and then reinsert it to get to the main menu or the next episode.  never had to ever do that with any dvd I own.  somebody sure messed up somewhere when they designed this dvd.  it's quite annoying.,1241740800,8,415,4.012195121951219

3658788,3,B001JNNDRY,"Love Columbo.  Because I'm obsessed with having every Columbo movie possible, I am willing to overlook the terrible flaws in these DVDs.

There is no way to get back to the main menu after watching an episode.  You can not navigate to watch the other episode on the disc.  With my DVD player, I must remove the disc, play another disc, remove that one, then put the first disc back to get to the main menu to choose the unseen episode.  We thought that there was something wrong with our disc or with the player, until I saw other reviews here.

This is a very poorly presented set - but because I adore Columbo I endure it.  Since there are only six movies for 1990, one would think that they could have combined the movies from 1991 to make this a meatier set - but they wouldn't do that, because this way they can milk us fans for all our dollars as much as possible.

It's obvious that the producers have no respect for the buyers, but we love Peter Falk so we suffer gladly, to hear ""Just one more thing....""",1239840000,80,1013,4.267015706806283

For the cost of watching ONE of these, you get six of them, totaling ten hours of continuous viewing.  Obviously with a DVD (an excellent quality by the way), you can stop, start and change the disc.

You can't beat the price either.  I went to the mall to buy one, but I stopped myself due to the price: TWICE the cost of this one.

Besides that, I LOVE this show!  The late Peter Falk was superb--He IS Columbo!  He is world famous.  Even his trench coat (which comes from his own personal wardrobe) is in the Smithsonian.
