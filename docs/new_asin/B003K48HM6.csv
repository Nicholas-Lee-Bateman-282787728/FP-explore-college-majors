I all way like the unsolved movie and i really enjoyed and liked this DVD Movie.",1380758400,,264,4.26
4133069,4,B003K48HM6,"This is an older movie, I found it very entertaining but also perdictable. I knew the moment they intoduced the character that he was the killer. They try and keep you guessing but I think it's pretty obvious who it is. Even so it was still a well done movie. You feel for the characters and I enjoyed the movie. I'd say it's worth the watch.",1377216000,,342,4.196969696969697
4133070,4,B003K48HM6,Another one watched with granddaughter.  She was intrigued with the mystery behind everything that happened.  Not scary but good.  Liked the twists and turns.,1374710400,,158,5.5
4133071,2,B003K48HM6,"The plot is fairly predictable and all of the male characters look so much alike that it gets a little confusing at times. The distraction was that there was only one black guy in the entire movie. He has very few lines. At one point, he and the white cop are at main character's door and she walks onto the porch and immediately just turns her back on the black cop and ignores him completely! Just talks to the white cop like black cop is a shrubbery! Unbelievable!! Last scene was pretty disgusting too, horrible chamber music, bad jazz, and all these ritzy white folk sliding around dancing, not one ethnic person in sight. It was a weird movie.",1367193600,,649,4.46218487394958

4133075,4,B003K48HM6,I really like Cheryl Ladd (the reason I rented the movie + horror.) It was very suspenceful and had a surprise ending. Who woulda thought? I would recommend this to anyone who likes suspence.,1360627200,,191,4.647058823529412
4133076,4,B003K48HM6,Older movie but very good anyway. Plot will keep you guessing until almost the end.  Great sit back on the sofa flick.,1359763200,2,118,4.363636363636363
4133077,5,B003K48HM6,"I really liked this movie the first time I saw it way back when and I've been looking to own a copy for a while. I did tape it on VHS but I wanted a commercial free copy. Also, I've been a fan of Duncan Regehr since his performance as Dracula in Monster Squad. Thanks Amazon for having a great selection to choose from! I just need more money!!",1318204800,7,344,4.0

4133082,4,B003K48HM6,Anything with Duncan Regehr is awesome.  Good all around cast.,1417046400,,62,5.2
4133083,4,B003K48HM6,"If The Lady in White were a made-for-TV Lifetime movie I think it It would be The Haunting of Lisa. This could just have easily have been made in the mid to late 80s, I really couldn't tell when it was made until I looked it up (1996). I think I mainly enjoyed this movie because I watched it during the day when I was sick. I liked it, but I tend to like made-for-TV schlock so use your own judgement. It focuses on human drama, not ghosts.",1409097600,,441,4.0227272727272725
4133084,5,B003K48HM6,"Powerful movie.  Cheryl Ladd and Duncan Regehr star in this movie with para-psychological overtones.  Great scripting. Very gripping at end, when the identity of the killer seems to travel from person to person until the final solution.",1408147200,,236,5.351351351351352
4133085,4,B003K48HM6,"Cheryl Ladd stars as Ellen Downey, the mum of a young daughter named Lisa who experiences spectral visions (yep, she sees dead people!). Lisa sees a beckoning spirit, just as the dead body of a little girl is found. What does the spirit want? What, if anything, does its appearance have to do w/ the current child murder? Things really heat up after Ellen finds the hidden grave of the spirit's ""forgotten child"". Ellen soon finds her home besieged by reporters and religious nuts. Lisa's visions continue, while the police hunt for the murderer. Meanwhile, Ellen learns about a child-killer from years earlier, known as Captain Moonlight. Has the Captaiin returned? THE HAUNTING OF LISA is an above average, made-for-TV supernatural thriller. Recommended, especially for Cheryl Ladd fanatics!...",1385769600,3,796,5.2265625
4133086,3,B003K48HM6,Just another Lifetime movie.  (I think I saw it there years ago.)  Mildly entertaining and ok for background play while working on other things.,1383696000,,144,4.958333333333333
4133087,4,B003K48HM6,"For a TV movie, very good.  Suspenseful.  Keeps things going right to the end. Cheryl Ladd was very good, too.",1383350400,,110,4.45

8398689,1,B003K48HM6,"This movie fails on many levels.  Terrible script, wooden acting by most of the actors. The true haunting was my choice to view this garbage flick to the end.",1439337600,,158,4.448275862068965
