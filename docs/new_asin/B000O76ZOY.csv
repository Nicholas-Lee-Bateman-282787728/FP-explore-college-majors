2791657,5,B000O76ZOY,"John Burns, the Baghdad bureau chief for the New York Times, calls this film ""the single best document (book, film, or article) you could see on the war in Iraq."" Director Deborah Scranton taught three soldiers from New Hampshire's National Guard --Steve Pink, Mike Moriarty, and the Lebanese-American Zack Bazzi who is fluent in Arabic --how to use a camera, then edited their 800 hours of war footage down to 97 minutes. The result is a first person visual narrative of the war in Iraq. It's probably about as close as you can get to experiencing war vicariously-- the chaos, bravado, feelings of helplessness, fear, vulgarity, boredom, and cynicism. Endless rows of charred vehicles in an equipment vehicle. Security escorts protecting convoys of Halliburton trucks carrying septic waste (""follow that shit truck!"") or cheese cake. Children everywhere. And yes, IEDs and daily mortar attacks lobbed into Camp Anaconda. The film documents the stories of the three soldiers from their deployment to their return to their families and post war symptoms, including several takes with their wives back home interspersed throughout the film. Parts of this film are very hard to watch.",1181260800,10,1181,5.18848167539267
2791658,5,B000O76ZOY,"`The War Tapes' is a unique documentary recorded by 3 soldiers in the New Hampshire Army National Guard during their one year deployment in Iraq.  Using cameras mounted on vehicle turrets, dashboards, and helmets along with utilizing night vision devices and thermal imagers, this compilation is assembled from over 800 hours of footage.  Sergeants Steve Pink and Zack Brazzi, along with Specialist Michael Moriarty are the central characters that carry the cameras and capture the images.

Almost from the first day on the ground in country, powerful and unsettling footage is shown from mortar attacks, ambushes, firefights, explosions, and injuries sustained from soldiers and civilians alike in Iraq.  The video is graphic and intense and it leaves a serious impression about what soldiers have to endure in Iraq.  You can get a sense of the underlying tension and anxiety experienced by these soldiers as they narrate what they've seen and felt.  Also shown are their attitudes and thoughts regarding why America is in Iraq and the consequences of the war.

In-between segments of the documentary, footage is shown with Michael Moriarty's wife, Zack Bazzi's mother, and Steve Pink's girlfriend.  They all put on a brave face but you can sense the emotional turmoil of having loved ones so far away in such a dangerous environment.  The families at home also share their mixed feelings about the American involvement in Iraq and the difficulties of being on their own.  Upon re-deploying back to the United States, there are physical and emotional changes evident in the returning soldiers and it is significant in how this affects a person's lifestyle and relationships.

`The War Tapes' is a well produced documentary, in my opinion, and delivers a thought provoking, important, and sometimes disturbing look at many aspects dealing with the war in Iraq.  To compliment the main program, there are 2 extra features on the DVD that are worth checking out.  One is a collection of interviews lasting just under 30 minutes and the second is 80 minutes of additional material covering several different and interesting topics.",1179360000,25,2128,5.169096209912537
2791659,4,B000O76ZOY,"`War Tapes' is a great documentary because it is made and narrated by the soldiers fighting in Iraq.  Three men from New Hampshire share different backgrounds but one purpose:  To win the war in Iraq, but each states his own personal motivation well.  The film has three different aspects:  the battles, the family life at home, and life in the army in Iraq.  There are three main participants:  Steven Pink, who has most of the cameras and a girlfriend, Lindsay, waiting for him at home;  Zach Bazzi, a Lebanese migr, whose mom is devoted to her soldier son; and Mike Moriarity whose wife and children wait on pins and needles for his return.  At times the documentary is composed.  We hear the thoughts of loved ones, torn by separation anxiety, pride, and love.  The soldiers testify to their sense of purpose.  Then, we get harrowing battle scenes with tanks going through the unstable streets of Fallujah.  We hear them work as a unit fighting the insurgents with appropriately shaky cameras and thundering ammunition.  Their candor is almost groundbreaking.  The disdain for the enemy and the opportunism of war purveyors KBR and Halliburton are telling.  Seeing soldiers train Iraqis, sorely needed recreation, and the aftermath of the men's sacrifices are key highlights.  Whether or not you support the war, this film shouldn't be missed for supporting and understanding the soldiers. Sometimes funny, often unsettling, but always interesting, 'The War Tapes' is a rewarding and informative film.",1177804800,7,1505,5.081632653061225

2791664,4,B000O76ZOY,"Possibly my favorite of the documentaries made about the recent conflicts in the Middle East, The War Tapes is unique in the fact that it has great pacing, culminating in an epic climax that will leave your heart pounding. Genuine elements of real-life pacing (without a script) are exceedingly rare and difficult to capture on film, but the War Tapes does just that. And I haven't even mentioned the valuable insight into the War on Terror that this doc provides. The War Tapes is truly a one-of-a-kind experience.

What makes TWT work so darn well is that it builds a story on real life experiences that have a complete beginning, middle, and end. We are introduced to three soldiers who are called to serve in the tumultuous Iraq War. Starting just before their preparations to leave the US, we get to know what our three characters are like before the war and what makes them tick. We are introduced to their families and units and get a sense of what their lifestyle is like. All of the men were good choices for leading the viewer through the campaign, as each soldier has a memorable personality and provides insightful (and oftentimes, quite witty) commentary on the day-to-day happenings. Whats more, the fact that all three of the soldiers have notably different personalities and opinions allows us to get a wide range of analysis on the Iraq War campaign, and each soldier draws their own conclusion about the quagmire. Instead of setting out to document the Middle Eastern conflict with a predetermined agenda, the film-makers made the smart decision to give us multiple vantage points from which to observe the complexities of the Iraq invasion.

The footage itself is a combination of hand-held camerawork courtesy of our National Guard volunteers and post-war interviews. These scenes are well edited so that every situation is explained as it progresses and you always know what is going on.

The incredible thing is that all the footage is arranged in a well-paced manner that makes each conflict and conversation more memorable and easier to understand. Frequent comic relief in the form of soldiers wisecracks and surprisingly insightful observations go a long way toward lightening the mood and helping to relate to each of the soldiers. There are plenty of gruesome and hard-to-stomach events, to be sure, but none of these feel forced, unnecessary, or heavy-handed. It is quite a journey, overall, and it builds to powerfully intense climax that leaves you on the edge of your seat. The War Tapes is easily one of the best, if not the best, Middle East war documentary that I have seen thus far.

-

SCORE: 9/10

+ The editing and arrangement of the National Guardsmens video diaries and interviews are top notch. The story of each soldier is interesting, exciting, and highly informative.

+ The personalities of the three soldiers are some of the films highlights, with their senses of humor being particularly memorable.

+ The final shootout is a tense, white-knuckle experience.

2791666,1,B000O76ZOY,What shocked me the most was the level of incompetence these supposedly trained soldiers displayed as well as the absurd level of ignorance and racism shown.,1355184000,2,157,5.076923076923077
2791667,2,B000O76ZOY,This project was a great idea and the film itself is a pretty good production.  But I have to agree with the other poster.  It all comes down to the post-production and editing.  How did this turn into an anti-Haliburton / anti-Bush/Cheney rant?  It did so because of the producer's bias.,1353628800,5,288,4.588235294117647
2791668,3,B000O76ZOY,"It's so very sad that while America has two major wars raging you are hard pressed to find ANY major media coverage. There was better coverage of Vietnam! So, if you want to see what your government has been working so hard at making sure you don't see, watch this. Watch the extras if you want to see more soldiers' stories. In a way, the extras are better than the feature.",1350086400,4,375,4.295774647887324
2791669,4,B000O76ZOY,"The reviewer who wrote ""Not as Advertised: This Film is Heavy with Anti-Military Agenda"" must have been talking about some other movie.  This movie is extremely positive toward the military.  It is also inarguably pro-war.  It is typical bush era pro-war propaganda that took over the country and the media in the wake of 9-11-2001.  If there is an anti-military agenda here you'd have to point it out because I didn't see it.

That said, the movie itself is about war as seen by one soldier who has taken a camera with him to film his tour of duty.  It is graphic and realistic. It shows human carnage and captures the terrible sounds and sights of explosions and gunfire. It shows this soldier's experiences in his day to day activities focusing on his personal thoughts and opinions. It includes segments about his family back home.  The film seems honest and sober and the likeable soldier we get to know is an admirable and reasonable fellow more often than not.  One ""not"" moment was when he reveals that watching a dog eating a human corpse did not bother him at all. This was due to the fact that the corpse belonged to an enemy militant.

All in all it's not a bad movie but it is not eye-opening or revelatory.  This is what a tour of duty looks like in the Middle East.",1340150400,,1280,4.478448275862069
2791670,5,B000O76ZOY,"It would be interesting to see how these guys are doing now. I'd also like to know how Sgt. Smith is doing and how well we were able to restore him and his leg to preholocaust status. Good job here. I haven't seen any of the 'war movies' before this except gun camera videos. Butchers. Our behavior is worse than the Nazi's ever was. As was pointed out, imagine your sister run over by a NATO (in the U.S. defending the U.S. elite from the angry People) convoy truck heading to attack your local resistance hiding out in the Oregon Coast Range forests or your neighbor shot to death when he gave the finger to a NATO troop carrier and passed them in traffic or the empty grocery stores, sporadic electricity, and no running water... ...your suddenly randomly dead wife, mother, son, daughter, sister, brother...even your dog. Not for oil, for Iran and KBR. It so mystifies me why Republicans cannot see the absolute corruption their leadership has become. ""Oh, but the Democrats..."" Yes!! The same!! But Republicans pride themselves on a deft touch with money yet somehow cannot see when they are being robbed blind of both their wealth and more importantly their children by their own leaders. Speaking of one political party in America is speaking almost exactly, save for representational color, the same thing about the other. What is wrong with America that we have settled for nonrepresentational government? Does believing in religion with all of its magic and hierarchy make a mind easily convinced (that is, propagandized) by political tools? I think every believer should consider their personal vision of heaven or the afterlife, see it clearly whether in images or words, and then seriously contemplate the word 'eternity'. Imagine entering into that great afterlife and the awe of it all, I suppose, for a day, two days, and on. Study astronomy and paleontology so you get used to big numbers of years and think about year after year in your heaven. Whenever you invest in something, particularly if you invest your life, you should study it closely and clearly understand your payoff. For me, the only eternal is the place I was in before I came here and to which I will return. Let's have just one more war, the War on America's Social Disease: Our Elite. Cut them off of us like a bad wart. We'll grow a new one. Interesting that, when the time comes, we might be facing the Mass. National Guard among others. But, Pink won't be among them. He'll be walking out in front of us and asking the Guardsmen to put down their weapons... The government is not the Country, only we are the Country. We must direct our government to completely resorb and eliminate our current deranged elite and create conditions favorable to the psychopathic wouldbes to form a new, more polite, less greedy elite.

2791671,4,B000O76ZOY,"This is worth looking at.  The footage and real time audio is just what it was like...I was there, I know.  It is slightly slanted in the comentary...though I suspect that was an attempt to find a few subjects (the soldiers) that would give a varried view point.  By trying to balance things, you'd think the guys over there were as much for as against.  Not true.  But that really matters not, I'm willing to believe the intent was balance, not an intentional skew of the opinions.  War sucks.  Period.  Hooah",1325721600,3,510,4.527472527472527
2791672,1,B000O76ZOY,"I saw this film when it first came out at a premier in Boston.  It advertised itself as ""no politics, no agenda"" and nothing could be farther from the truth.

This film was produced by an anti-war producer/director during the worst crunch point in the recent Iraq War.  The producers of this film gave cameras to about 18 souls in the NH National Guard unit sent to Iraq during those difficult times.  Then she choose the three guys of the 18 who most fit her agenda and anti-war perspective and shamelessly appropriated them and Lord only knows what her editing of their hundreds of hours of tape would have told in another person's hands.  The advertising and false representation of this cut-and-paste job of film footage into a ""movie"" is nothing less than gross dishonesty.

I served in Iraq with the Marines in 2003 and little of what the producer-directorial team depicts is an accurate portrayal of men and women at war today.

Anyhow, if you want to be spoon fed a liberal anti-war agenda that unfairly appropriates three innocent Army soldiers to do the dirty work, fork out you money for this flick.  If not, and you prefer your entertainment without a heavy dose of someone else seeking to enlighten you and manipulate you into their world view - - then get Quentin Tarentino's INGLORIOUS BASTERDS and be truly entertained and satisfied with your purchase.",1299801600,17,1368,4.766949152542373

2791674,1,B000O76ZOY,"I only gave it a one for three reasons.

First off one of the soldiers makes the claim that Halliburton makes 24 bucks a plate, even if empty, with nothing to back this claim. It's probably nothing more than a made up story. He lost all credablility with me when he then made the claim that Dick Cheney runs Halliburon and is making money off this war. He needs to be educated because Dick Cheney quit Halliburton in 2000.

Second the Muslim guy in this film annoys me. It's the typical sympathize with the enemy attitude that I cant stand. First he tries to make a comparison that makes no sense. He says what if Canada invaded the USA, I'm sure lots of Bush lovers would pick up their guns and fight back. Ok let's get this straight. First off if Canada invaded I would kill Canadians, not my own people in the markets and churches. Those people are not trying to liberate their country, they are trying to cause choas and kill their own people, women and children. Second Saddam was a war criminal who gased his own people and is responsible for chemicals getting thousands of our soldiers sick in the first gulf war. There is no comparsion. His typical, ""I side with my people"" attitude sickens me and turned me off from the film.

Third, there is hardly any action. If you want to see an action film, this is not for you. It's more complaining than anything.",1216857600,30,1363,4.422310756972111
2791675,5,B000O76ZOY,"The idea behind The War Tapes is simple enough: give video recorders to a handful of NH National Guardsmen on their way to Iraq, then edit the results into something worth viewing. The project could have been a disaster, yielding nothing but prosaic (or worse) self-congratulatory nonsense that would have been hell to watch. Instead, the men whose footage made it into the film provided insights far deeper than many of are accustomed to watching. The men show themselves and their comrade posturing nervously as they prepare for battle. Once in Iraq, they begin to realize just how the war is being waged. They experience the ever-present threat of IEDs, the plight of civilians caught between sides. Tellingly, they experience the absurdities of war -- a night spent guarding a shipment of cheesecakes, offers of homegrown cigarettes and pornography from the locals, a graveyard of trucks and equipment blown apart by explosives, each wreck telling a story.

The home front is shown as well. The men's wives, mothers and children must deal with the prolonged absence of the men from home, and hope they will come back alive and reasonably sane. When the men do return, they face the complexities of reintegrating with their old lives. What do you say when one day you are dodging enemy bullets and the next you are sitting on your Mom's living room? What's it like to commute to work when the roadside has held such horrors?

The War Tapes is a masterful piece of editing. To craft unplanned footage from several uncoordinated cameras into a coherent tale -- avoiding glamorizing the war or becoming a polemic against it -- shows remarkable trust in the soldier's experiences. The soldiers need to be commended as well for allowing themselves to be filmed expressing every emotion from loyalty to disgust to bravado to self-doubt. The War Tapes is an incredible accounting of the realities of the experience of fighting in Iraq. A masterpiece of reporting that far outstrips any of the embedded ""reporting"" done by the networks or cable channels.",1214179200,,2049,4.953488372093023

2791677,5,B000O76ZOY,"I just saw this on the military channel and am buying the DVD.

Brilliant telling of a very human story. Great Americans, by which I mean honest decent men, with strong convictions, performing a nasty mission on behalf of their country and more importantly their fellow soldiers. You can't go through their experience without being changed in fundamental ways, and you see the immediate and long term costs of what some people debate on a policy level, but which ultimately manifests in the lives and families of these brave, scared, lonely, decent men. They are in my prayers as they go forward, trying to make meaning of it all, and carrying on with their lives. As a retired career soldier myself, I found myself reliving my own memories of hell and boredom, frustration and fear, and the odd moments of joy and humor. They have done an awesome job of expressing the unexpressable. I admire their courage in letting us see themselves in the moment.

The story is told with integrity and honesty, and without apology, and for that I am grateful. Anyone who thinks war is honorable is nuts, although there are elements of honor in it. Anyone who thinks it's glory and policy are wrong, although there are elements of glory and policy in it. It's also heartwrenching accidents and indelible events and human prices that keep getting paid. It's tied to the dark side of human nature and will be with us as long as we are the half animal/half noble spirit that is humankind. I pray that our consciousness survives. it's only through these shared stories and truths that consciousness may win. Without understanding there can be no compassion and empathy, and ultimately that's what it takes for love and peace to thrive.

i wish these brave soldiers well, and want them to know how many people DO understand their sacrifice and courage and conviction. we need more voices like this to inform the public debate on monumental decisions that commit our people to war

2791678,3,B000O76ZOY,"Having grown up in a career military family, I must applaud this film.  The fact that it was commissioned and sponsored by the U.S. Army National Guard is a positive sign that the military is attempting to ease the transition of fighting troops back into normal civilian life.

What are the messages of this film?  According to the Extra Features:

1) Understand what we soldiers have been through in service to our country.
2) We were sent to Iraq to kill people.  Right or wrong, that was our mission, and we did it to the best of our ability.  Judge us on that basis.
3) Support our troops without asking whether the Iraq War was necessary. That question only demoralizes us and makes our job more difficult.
4) Don't blame us the way you did the Vietnam veterans. We are all wounded warriors, emotionally if not physically. Welcome us home as heroes.

I served in the Army as a medic during the Vietnam conflict.  When I returned home from overseas, I was confused and depressed for six months.  I needed to talk with my family about what I had experienced, but no one seemed to understand or even wanted to listen.  The soldiers in this film said it was very helpful for their families in understanding ""why I am the way I am since I returned.""

This film may not be considered a true ""documentary"" in the sense that the cameramen said all the tapes were turned over to Command for their editing and approval.  The sergeant described that when he started thinking of himself as a photojournalist and asking other soldiers what they thought about apparently inane orders on camera, his commander called him in and warned him these were actions unbecoming a non-commissioned officer.

If you are looking for a film that says ""The Iraqis are real people and they are suffering too,"" this is not it.  But this film supports the troops without question, helps their families to understand what they went through for us, and they deserve this and a lot more from the American public.",1186185600,21,1982,4.6257142857142854
2791679,4,B000O76ZOY,"In 2004 Deborah Scranton was invited to join a New Hampshire National Guard unit being deployed to Iraq as an imbedded journalist. She and producing partner Charles Lacy had a different idea: why not provide the soldiers with miniDV camaras and let them record what they experienced. What resulted was some 800 hours of footage that was edited into the brillant 97 minutes of the War Tapes.

The story follows the day to day lives of three soldiers from training to return from duty one year later. Mike Moriority is a hard line patriot who wanted to be deployed to Iraq as a result of what he saw at 9-11. Steven Pink is a wise cracking college graduate who thinks service will make him a better man. Jack Bazzi is a Lebanese emigre who uses his knowledge of Arabic to give us a unique view of the culture.

Through these men we see the horror of war close up. The footage is graphic and haunting and is not always easy to watch but it is essential. There is more to be seen and talked about here than in 10 conventional war films. Whether you are pro war or antiwar there is something here that you can take in and discuss with others. The essential question is the age old one:why are we fighting. To some it is to bring democracy to the Iraqi people to others the ony real reason is for the oil and to make money for corporations like Haliburton.
