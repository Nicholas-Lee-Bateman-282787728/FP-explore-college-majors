4214214,2,B003WN1W22,"These movies from Lionsgate are available at a fair price, but they reuse old transfers (likely from original video sources). They are not remastered at all, and are all presented full-frame only. I would not recommend the set unless you are a fan of one of the films. I don't expect perfection from older films, but if Severin, Code Red or even Anchor Bay had released these, they would probably be properly framed at least.",1298160000,12,425,4.68

4214217,5,B003WN1W22,"I love the movies on this collection.  My best friend is a vampire, is a classic tale a teenager dealing with vampirism and a crush on a girl.  Repossesed is a great collectors item for most of us who are big fans of the original excorcism movie, it pokes fun at a women who is possessed by a demon.  Slaughter high is basically a revenge movie.  Silent night 3 is a great scary movie for the holidays.  Thanks for the great movies.",1428105600,2,432,4.219512195121951

4214227,5,B003WN1W22,I was familiar with Repossessed.  It's a great comedy.  My Best Friend is A Vampire was also very good.  The other two movies weren't quite to my taste but as a combo of movies it wasn't bad.,1369008000,,191,4.108108108108108
4214228,5,B003WN1W22,"Can't go wrong with these classic gems! But IN A SET?? ALL AT ONCE?? Who can resist??

Not me.

YOU CANNOT find this in a store. Atleast not anymore, nor can I even find it anywhere and I actually don't recall EVER seeing it anywhere, ever!

So, for the price and selection of movies in a set. IT'S A NO BRAINER!!",1362614400,,313,4.098360655737705
4214229,5,B003WN1W22,I bought the collection for the silent night deadly night movie but was pleasently surprised with slaughter high. i had seen my best friends a vampire before..in fact i previously owned it. if you like spoof movies then repossessed is one to check out,1360368000,,251,4.7272727272727275
4214230,4,B003WN1W22,"I went for the multi pack to get My Best Friend is a Vampire and Repossessed which is also fun in its own right. Any House fans should see MBF simply for the joy of Robert Sean Leonard who at a tender age had the same charm he does in House. In many ways it's the same character who might not know why he's friends with a loud carefree guy and has so-so luck with women. Pretending it's the same character could blow your mind. When I first saw this movie many years ago it was from searching for things Rene Auberjonois was in, and his few scenes king of help set the tone for a misunderstanding or a thinly veiled metaphor of vampirism as something that wasn't spoken of much when this was filmed.

After an awkward start the film picks up a bit, it's not that good nor is it as bad as it could be. It's best not taken too seriously and enjoyed for the sake of a rather fun movie you might feel good enough letting the older kids watch, just check it out first because of kissing and other teen situations. There are parts where I wish it was developed more, in a way some parts happen too fast, and fan fiction writers could find some starting points. As for vampire lore there is an interesting pint between ""living"" and ""dead"" but no sparkling or anything else to give people fits. THere's a feeling of half done research but what the writers might not know won't hurt anything.",1341273600,,1383,4.258555133079848
4214231,5,B003WN1W22,"I bought these for my grandchildren, and they have watched them so many times that it is almost time to get another for them!  If you like fright..this is the way to go! And 4 in a set, you just can't beat that, especially for this price!",1323907200,,238,4.0638297872340425
4214232,4,B003WN1W22,"I picked up this DVD specifically for ""My Best Friend is a Vampire.""  This is cheesey goodness like a fine roquefort.  The only person in the movie who can't act is the ""we need a Molly Ringwald type"" (MRT) cast as the female lead, but everyone else in the movie is gold.  Including acadamy award winner Kathy Bates as MRT's mom.  I don't know what became of the actor that played the lead's best friend, but that guy should have won some kind of award.  I could watch this movie 100 times.  There is absoultely nothing about this movie that isn't predictable, and arguably not as good as the early Jim Carrey vampire schlock fest ""Once Bitten,"" (another movie I could watch a few hundred times).  Still, if you are looking for an enjoyable 80's flashback, you could do worse than this movie.

Repossessed does to ""The Exorcist"" what Airplane did to ""Zero Hour.""  Leslie Neilson (RIP) is great as the old priest.  There are some truly funny bits and others that try and don't quite make it.  Still, if you are in the mood for a quality send-up, this is a good way to go.

I have not watched Slaughter High or Silent Night, Deadly Night 3 (or for that matter, either of the first two of this magnum opus).  The good news is I paid 9$, and 4.50 for each of the first two is more than a great price.  If you have not seen My Best Friend is a Vampire, and you enjoy 80's fromage, pick this up.",1305590400,7,1389,4.272030651340996
4214233,5,B003WN1W22,"what else can I say about this 4 movie special it is really worth buying if you trully love great horror movies especially the ones from the early 80's when scary movies were really at thier best. So, again this film collection is just wonderful to have all the time.",1304899200,3,267,4.36
4214234,4,B003WN1W22,"I love getting 4 movies for the price of 1 especially if the set has movies I would have bought separately anyway, this is one of those sets, Slaughter High is a classic 80's revenge slasher, My Best Friend is a Vampire is a really fun 80's fish out of water flick about a teenager who has to adjust and learn the ways of the modern Vampire after being bitten by one, with the help of his 300 year old mentor. Silent Night, Deadly Night 3 I actually really enjoyed, a blind girl is being stalked by a lobotomized killer she was psychically linked to while he was in a coma, file under trashy fun. I haven't watched Repossessed yet, having caught some of it on cable in the past I'm in no rush, but the other 3 are worthwhile flicks and make a nice addition to my collection.",1304380800,4,774,4.201342281879195

8407430,3,B003WN1W22,"MY BEST FRIEND IS A VAMPIRE & REPOSSESSED which is a comedy spoof on the Exorcist
and SLAUGHTER HIGH & SILENT DEADLY NIGHT
have been reissued on dvd for their first time ever by Lionsgate
you can either get each film seperatly as the Lost collection series or buy this 4 film collection
which has 2-2 sided discs Disc 1 my best friend is a vampire/repossessed & Disc 2 Slaughter High/silent night deadly night 3
if you buy the individual dvd versions then it says on the back cover 1:33:1 Fullscreen
but i tested both My best friend is vampire & repossessed on my Widescreen TV
and there's no black pillars/black bars on either side of the screen
so it appears the screen ratio of both films have been fixed to fit 1:85:1 ratio anyway, i assume it's the same with Slaughter High aswell
the picture quality is very Good most of the Grain & Dirt have been cleaned up for sure & the sound quality is Dolby digital 5.1
so 8/10 for picture quality & 7/10 for sound quality
so the quality definitely beats the VHS tape versions no Doubt about it
Tragically no extras for each of the films not even the original Trailers, so each film does have screen Menu
but there's only play, chapter selection & subtitles that's it
amazon are selling this 4 film collection for under $10 so it's better value for money to buy the 4 film collection
Full 3 stars i give for this collection based on excellent Digital remaster transfers & Dolby digital 5.1 mixes
but tragically no extras",1490054400,,1465,4.470149253731344

I first watched Slaughter High late night on Cinemax and spent a long time searching for it. I was very happy when I found it. If you love 80's horror movies, you should definitely add this to your collection. The reason this movie is so great is because the ending is not predictable; I never would have expected that to occur. I recommend this collection to everyone, worth the purchase.
