862115,3,6304397259,"I saw this film when it first came out in the theaters.  I remember I went in wanting Rachel McLish, respecting Carla Dunlap, and repulsed by Bev Francis.  I came out of the theater wanting Carla Dunlap, respecting Bev Francis, and repulsed by Rachel McLish.  I was about 21 at the time.

I am giving this film only three stars because, while ""Pumping Iron II"" is a well made film, it is a poorly made DVD.  The film looks underexposed throughout and somewhat grainy in places.  I realize the distributor is a small company but a little more effort could have been put into the transfer.  If they could manage to get George Butler (the director) to do commentary then one would think they could manage to procure a better quality print (or even make a print from the negative) for DVD release.  The photos in the still gallery that come in the Extras are digital crisp, even when viewed with the ""zoom"" feature on your remote.  They should have put the same cleanup effort into the movie itself.

Speaking of extras, why is there no commentary from any of the principal participants/competitors themselves?  This film was such a big break for all of them that I can't believe the producers couldn't get even one of them to offer their insights.  A film like this needs some historical perspective, IMHO.  Still, it's a good movie, worth buying if you're a fan of women's bodybuilding, or interested in women's studies.",1063843200,24,1418,4.646586345381526
862116,4,6304397259,"This short documentary explores the world of competitive female bodybuilding during the early 1980's. This film is true to the era with heavy makeup, spandex, bad hair and a moonwalk included during a posing routine. The film ponders the the level of acceptable muscularity that a woman should posess and examines the judging of a competitor who at the time was bigger than any other woman who ever stood on the competitive stage -- Australian power lifter Bev Francis. By current standards, Bev would fit right in and might actually be on the small side as compared to other female professional bodybuilders, but by 1983's standards, she was considered a freak. Neither the judges nor the competitors could come to a consensus about the ideal. The first Ms. Olympia Rachel McLish was more along the lines of what the public expected of female bodybuilders -- sleek, with some definition and feminine. McLish and the others look more like today's fitness competitors. Carla Dunlap had considerable size, but was still smaller than Francis who she said ""Has muscularity that most men would envy.""
Female bodybuilding is still a fringe activity, and this film shows some of what the pioneers endured in the early days. And much like today, the officials and trainers are mostly male.
I enjoyed this movie for its camp value, but it's also a nice history lesson for female physique competitors.",1054771200,31,1391,4.9742489270386265

7870018,3,6304397259,"Wow, talk about ""documentary"" filmmakers having an agenda. These guys (George Butler and Charles Gaines) must have graduated from the Michael Moore School Of Objectivity.

This film is the follow-up to the highly-acclaimed ""Pumping Iron,"" made by the same guys about a decade earlier, and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, That one was well-done, even though they went out of their way to stretch the truth there, too. (Arnold is shown to be overly heartless and ruthless and his main competitors are pictured as easily-manipulated stupid idiots. Both were exaggerated).

Here, in the women's edition of Pumping Iron, Gaines and Butler have two more main objectives: 1) show how Bev Francis got screwed out of the championship trophy; 2) show the Christian contestant to be downright evil and a big phony.

As someone who spent his career in the newspaper business:I can tell you editors pick and choose what they want you to see and hear. It's called editing. You can bet thousands of footage was filmed for this ""documentary."" On McLish, only the material that made her look bad was inserted in the film. That was obvious. We never see her shown in a positive light. And, of course, anytime they could get her to mention she was a Christian, and then follow that up with something the audience would find distasteful about her, all the better!

Regarding Francis, frankly, I agree -- she did get robbed. Who in their right mind would argue she wasn't hands down the best contestant? Nobody, even the gracious winner Carla Dunlap. However, the filmmakers could have let the viewers see the obvious, without hammering their point home time and time again, going out of their way to show how ignorant the judges were. It's like.....okay, we know what's happening here .... move on. How about showing more of the winner of the contest?

Overall, the movie was interesting, especially to people who work out regularly in a gym....... but it could have been so much better without the bias.",1239753600,9,1984,4.91044776119403

7870021,5,6304397259,"When you watch this film you wonder what happened to the Ms. Olympia contest where women look like healthy athletes (Carla Dunlop, Rachel McLish) to the vein-popping, manly-looking contestants of today?  The movie hints the answer with the introduction of Bev Francis.  Though she does not win the contest, you can sense that her type is the wave of the future.

I liked this movie far better to Arnold's version, though Arnold was able to launch a mega-career from his movie where Rachel McLish only had a brief and unmemorable movie career.

The competition between McLish and Dunlop is fierce and more intriguing than the Arnold/Ferrigno competition of the men's version.  Just watching these two goddesses compete is worth the price of the disk!",1190592000,2,749,5.008064516129032

7870023,3,6304397259,"In any athletic field, the most watched female athletes are those who have a distinct physical presence.  Just being good at your sport may allow you to win medals but you won't get much popular or media attention.  This historic documentary highlights why this became a huge issue back in the 1980s when women's bodybuilding just started to take off.  Rachel McLish was considered the favourite for the Caesars Palace World Cup Championship.  She was very toned, lightly muscled and considered very attractive by most people.  Bev Francis was an Australian powerlifting champion who shocked people wherever she went because she was so muscular.  Everybody agreed that she had bigger muscles than anybody else but where there was disagreement was whether it was ""aesthetic"" for a women to be that heavily muscled.  Bev comes across as very honest, dedicated, outspoken and caring, something you would expect when you see her.  Lori Bowen was a Rachel McLish fan, so much so that she actually looked a lot like her.  She and her boyfriend (who is a go-go dancer) dream that she will win big.  She is from an economically depressed background and you get the feeling she has struggled for whatevr she got. Carla Dunlap is very well muscled, although not as big as Bev.  She comes across as a very intelligent, outspoken woman, the type you would see in a unversity classroom arguing with her professor about an issue in metaphysics.  I won't tell you who wins because that would spoil the movie but let me tell you why I gave it 3 stars.  It explores the issue of sexualizing women in the sport of bodybuilding and at the same time tries to educate the viewer about the sport.  Although it does fairly well at both tasks, the two different lens that are applied tend to make the final product less effective.  Is it about women and their objectification in bodybuilding - something that continues today ?  Or is it just a story of the competitors ?  Or does it try to educate viewers about bodybuilding as a sport for women.  In the end although you would have learned a little about each part, you are not quite sure.",1107475200,10,2116,4.688346883468835
7870024,4,6304397259,"Does anyone know the name of a certain track in the movie near the beginning when Rachel Mcclish is seen posing in a studio under the guidance of Joe Weider. She is wearing colored feathers and posing with 2 dumbells in her hand. The song that is playing I would like to know the tiltle of.

Thanks, Warren",1104451200,,306,4.275862068965517
