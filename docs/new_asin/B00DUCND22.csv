8597815,5,B00DUCND22,"Welp, as a total Steins;Gate fanboy I shelled out the moolah for this. I can honestly say I'm not disappointed. It comes with the movie, some drama CDs, and a booklet that contains some stories and art from Steins;Gate (if only I could read Japanese). The movie is very good for an anime movie in my opinion. It covers more of the relationship between Okabe and Kurisu and I think adds to the series very well. I give it two enthusiastic thumbs up.",1470787200,,448,4.409638554216867
8597816,5,B00DUCND22,"I couldn't wait for the Funimation release any longer and purchased this. While the subtitle track was a bit weird in a few places, it got the point across and the picture quality blows away anything Funimation usually releases. If you were on the fence like I was and prefer the Japanese dub work, I highly recommend throwing caution to the wind and purchasing this release. El Psy Congroo.

PS. The music CD was also cool. I can't understand the drama CDs, but they were still fun to listen to with a script I found online.",1460419200,,525,4.46875
8597817,5,B00DUCND22,"As a fan of the original visual novel, I was a little disappointed with some of the changes made in the anime adaptation. But this movie really makes up for those. It explores a core theme of the VN that was underdeveloped in the anime series, the question of how one's existence in the present worldline relates to one's existence in other worldlines. An important device for exploring this theme was the alternate endings of the visual novel, which are finally acknowledged in the anime series too, here in this movie. I am very happy about this, and I hope this element can be equally appreciated by people who have never read the VN.

Overall, this movie is better looking than the anime series. It has some gorgeous backgrounds and more dynamic animation throughout. I also like that it was clearly designed to be movie from the start. There are beautiful landscape shots and unique camera angles. Important events are communicated visually, and characters often interact with each other simply their facial expressions. There is some very touching usage of visual metaphor too.

The pacing was perfect, neither rushed nor lagging, although I didn't realize the whole thing would be so melancholic. I kept expecting the action to ramp up, and all of a sudden the movie was over. I'm not disappointed with this, in fact I think the ending was very good, but my initial expectations were definitely off. I guess the story structure reminds me more of those 90-minute-long episodes of European crime dramas (like BBC's Sherlock and Wallander) than of typical movies.

It was refreshing to see a story from Kurisu's perspective. I enjoyed learning more about her character as she likewise learns to confront her own very real fear of being vulnerable to others.

This movie was designed to be watched after the anime series OVA, as in Episode 25. I'd also agree with others who say it's really meant for existing fans. But those fans will definitely enjoy this movie. Recommended!",1454198400,,1981,4.886904761904762
8597818,4,B00DUCND22,"Note: It has been a long wait for the real American version of this film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Steins-Gate-The-Movie-Load-Region-of-Dj-Vu/dp/B01NCOVUTF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Steins;Gate: The Movie - Load Region of Dj Vu</a>, and I wasn't expecting all that much.  I was STUNNED!  Never mind with any of the different versions of this comparatively poorly subtitled film; stick with the Funimation version!

If you loved&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Steins-Gate-The-Complete-Series/dp/B00KU3Y5CG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Steins;Gate: The Complete Series</a>, you are going to want to watch this sequel, set a year after the series.  Unfortunately, there is no American home video version yet, but unlike so many Japanese anime editions, this one comes with English subtitles (After selecting the S for the setup menu option, you will see audio and subtitle options.  The middle subtitle selection turns on the English subtitles.)

Having successfully moved to the Steins;Gate world (time) line where all of his friends are safe, Rintarou Okabe is ready to relax and enjoy life, but now his singular ability to remember events from all world lines he's passed through is causing problems: he finds himself spontaneously jumping to another world line and disappearing from the Steins;Gate world line,...

and from the memories of everyone he leaves behind.  Once more Suzuha Amane carries the mail, bringing word from 2036 that the only way to save Okabe is for Kurisu Makise to travel back into the past and find a way to plant a unique memory strong enough to firmly tie Okabe to this world line, but Kurisu is torn between playing it safe (doing nothing), thus obeying Okabe's clearly stated wish once he's apprised of the situation, and risking it all to save the man she is finally willing to admit that she loves.  In many ways the TV show is the tale of Okabe's trip to Hell and back (and Back and BACK) in order to save both his childhood friend and the girl he wasn't quite willing to admit that he loved.  Now this movie is Kurisu's trip to Hell and back in order to save Okabe.  This now shared experience must of necessity draw them closer together,...

assuming these two tsundere idiots are capable of getting a clue....

Note: Of all the memories of alternate world lines that assault Okabe's sanity, the most interesting is one that appears in the virtual novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Steins-Gate-PC-Regular-Edition/dp/B00K886062/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Steins;Gate - PC (Regular Edition)</a>&nbsp;but NOT in the anime: Vengeful Nae's Track.  This is particularly noticeable because the events that provoked this are significantly changed in the TV series, arguably making it impossible (or at least as impossible as anything can be in a world with time travel).

Note: This movie is available in several different versions depending on what if any extras you want (all extras are of course in Japanese):

8597819,5,B00DUCND22,A fantastic wrap up to the Steins;Gate series! I would definitely suggest watching the tv series first. This story is told from the main females point of view which was very entertaining for me. Worth every cent,1447200000,,211,4.72972972972973

Its a great epilogue, concluding an even better series. In short, the whole series is about time travelling sprinkled with some romance and tension that usually accompanies time travelling movies as things go wrong.
I am not going to write much more here - but I'll put a full review in the main series.",1444694400,,623,6.341176470588235
8597821,5,B00DUCND22,"While the Steins;Gate anime ended on a very lovely note, going even farther than the first Visual Novel did, I'm sure many people still want to see canon adventures of this wonderful cast. Fortunately for SciAdv fans around the world this movie does the cast and story justice, but the ""99% science 1% fantasy"" element of the original series definitely gets stretched pretty far for the plot in this story. In the movie's favor the original did have a microwave time machine so calling the pseudo-science out on it might be too far.

Overall: The movie is a great addition to the Steins;Gate story exploring Kurisu's character in more detail, and at the same time it shows how Okabe has come to terms with all that has happened to him.

Is this movie great for people who have never seen Steins;Gate? While the overall story is really well done a lot of the tragedy and motivations behind the characters will be lost to those who haven't seen or read the source. On the other hand the movie does a good job of attempting to explain the past events for newcomers, so those just watching something Steins;Gate related shouldn't be completely lost.

Animation: The animation is better than the anime which already had fantastic animation. Not much to say here.

Sound: All the cast returns from the VN as far as I could tell which means incredible performances all around. No English audio. The music is also great which is expected since nitro+ & 5pb. all do music in-house.

Translation: A pretty good translation with a headscratcher here and there. Ex. as mentioned above tsundere became ""sweet and sour.""",1442188800,,1606,4.762589928057554
8597822,5,B00DUCND22,"Well worth the purchase, nice addition to the series.",1436140800,,53,5.0
8597823,5,B00DUCND22,"Since there doesn't seems to be any proper clear review of the product, I'll try to cover everything here so that any question can be answered.
(Do consider that I am not a native english speaker, and that I may write in a weird manner and/or be unclear at some points.)

First of all, this japanese blu-ray will play on North American blu-ray players, in case you were wondering, and there are indeed english subtitles. The subtitles themselves are quite good, but do expect them to translate things in unexpected ways sometimes, if you are familiar with the anime. (The only instance this striked me is when they translated tsundere to sweet and sour instead of keeping the actual word as the funimation subs do). But overall, everything is good here. The movie itself last around an hour and a half.

Now, this movie is a follow-up to Steins;Gate anime (and the original visual novel that follows the same story pretty much). I would say it is better if you have watched the series before watching this movie, but not essential. Most of the necessary things that are needed to be known are explained for you to understand the storyline. But, keep in mind that without any prior knowledge, understanding some points will prove to be difficult. Overall, I highly recommend you have watched the anime OR played the visual novel before watching the movie.

As for the movie itself, it's nothing short of great, in my opinion. If you are a fan of Steins;Gate, you will certainly not be disappointed. This time around, Makise Kurisu is the main character (instead of Okabe Rintaro), and it's nice to really see a story from her point of view. I won't go in the details of the plot, but overall it's pretty good and interesting. I do feel, however, that the science behind this movie is weaker than in the anime (and visual novel), but maybe that's just me (however, do consider this movie has only an hour and a half to tell a story). Also, this is a movie way more oriented towards emotions rather than action, which isn't a bad thing at all as far as I'm concerned, just don't expect the movie to be an action flick or one of the more action-oriented episodes of the anime. Nevertheless, this movie is about emotions, and it does incredibly well in making the viewer feel for the characters (maybe less if you haven't seen the anime). Some people may argue that some parts of the movie are slower, but it didn't strike me as being problematic, even if the actual main plot kicked in after half an hour (which was an entertaining half an hour as far as I'm concerned). I will not add anything on the subject, fearing I might spoil something, just keep in mind this movie has the same humor as the original anime and the same emotional weight at some points too.

In conclusion, this movie is incredible, and any Steins;Gate fan should watch it, and I'm pretty they are bound to love it as much as I did. The price is a bit high however, so maybe it would be preferable to wait until funimation releases it on their end (since their licensed it this year I think). The problem is, we do not know when such a release will see the light of day.",1418342400,24,3139,4.511423550087874
