8383982,4,B00009ATKC,"This show was shot professionally for use in an Australian TV special called ""The Inner Sanctum"" which aired in 1980. The live versions of Detroit Rock City and Rock & Roll all Nite featured on the Exposed video were culled from this footage. I caught Kiss' very next show in Brisbane a couple of days after this one and I would have to say that I have mixed feelings about it. This concert comes from the time when the band were in the middle of their ghastly ""Pop"" phase (Unmasked having been released a few month's earlier). The whole mix leans more toward pop than hard rock - especially the drum sound. Also they used some sort of electronic harmonizer on Paul's vocals which gives these renditions of Kiss' classics a strange almost surreal edge. That said, this tour did have some unique features which make it an interesting part of Kiss history. Firstly this was the final leg of Eric Carr's first world tour with the band - the first tour ever without the 4 original members. (Eric does a fine job handling the lead vocals on Black Diamond). The set list contains a number of tunes which have rarely - if ever - been part of the set list since such as Is That You, Talk To Me & Shandi. In summary - this is not classic Kiss but if you're a fan you've just got to see it - it's an integral part of the Kiss puzzle.",1052697600,8,1323,4.296
8383983,5,B00009ATKC,"Well, I know it aint out yet but figured it could use a simple review as its been circulating as a bootleg for ages - It's a great show put simply - Kiss in makeup with the best line up Kiss had during the 1980s (Gene/Paul/Ace/Eric).
Great set too from the Unmasked tour so a few odd tunes rarely seen on other Kiss shows like Shandi and Talk To Me pop up alongside the classics.... the live drum sound sounds a bit like upturned bathtubs being hit with mallets but other than that a top notch DVD (hopefully!).
