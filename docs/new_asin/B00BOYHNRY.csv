5663011,4,B00BOYHNRY,"This Taiwanese movie is cute and charming.  All the characters are likeable.  They are all very cute and with personalities.  The casting was great.  Storyline is there is a bakery shop in a small town/village operated by a father, a son, a daughter and a male worker.  The worker and the daughter are in love and are boyfriend and girlfriend, or at least the guy is in love and the girl is trying to figure out if he's the one.  Worker wants to be engaged and to eventually marry the girl, but he is simple minded.  The girl doesn't want to be stuck in a small town; she wants to see the world, particularly Paris.  She learns French and speak decent English.

An internationally well known TV baker loses his mother and misses her so much that he digs into her past.  He disappears off the radar and ends up at the bakery shop in this small town because his mother was once a friend of the mother of this bakery shop.  His mother was a writer and the mother of the bakery shop loves her books, so she bakes a particular bun that the writer loves.  The son is now looking for this bun and the ingredients that make this bun as it reminds him of his mother's happiness.  In his search, he meets the daughter of the bakery shop and begins to have feelings for her.  The question is will he pursue her and if so, how far will he go being that she has a loving boyfriend?

I must say the breads in this movie look delicious and some parts of this movie is quite funny.  The people are very attractive and you feel for the characters.  Great acting and decent story.  Incorporates multiculturalism with a nice touch.  It makes me consider going to baking school.  Nice movie.",1438905600,,1671,4.311897106109325
5663012,4,B00BOYHNRY,"The concept that any skill or art is rooted in a genuine dedication to please another (like adding love to the baking of bread) instead of achieving glory or wealth is an axiom worth considering. Sometimes the characters become muddled, but this is realistic, because even a villain must have loved someone sometime. The love affair didn't quite work for me, and the closing image of the giant doll chasing the girl and the famous baker on a motorcycle didn't quite work for me. Otherwise, it is beautifully acted.",1436745600,,514,4.786516853932584

5663014,5,B00BOYHNRY,"I, too, loved this movie!  It's charming, funny and throughout the entire movie I wasn't sure how it would turn out.  I enjoyed the view of small town Taiwan, the characters were realistic and fun to watch and all that wonderful bread... It's a great way to spend a few hours.",1435968000,,276,4.392156862745098
5663015,4,B00BOYHNRY,"For the rest of us there are a few movies like this. Will the story end the way you hoped it would? Maybe. Maybe not. A strong willed, small town, 28 yo baker's daughter with somewhat big dreams wants her hard working, average, baker boyfriend to go to France and win baking awards. Then she treats him like dirt after the greatest bread baker on earth drops into town because his deceased mother ate the best bread at her family's store. There's a surprise ending.",1432944000,,465,4.482352941176471

8572044,5,B00BOYHNRY,"Slow-moving, with a kind of even (but slow) pace, this movie is cute as can be, sweet as can be.

The bread and the food in the movie makes it almost a movie for foodies. It would be that if the breads weren't interrupted with cuteness and adorable scenes. If this movie is missing anything, it's little fuzzy ducklings following the male lead around. Or maybe maybe more music like the very catchy song about a Pineapple Bun!

I enjoyed watching this film. You will, too, especially if you have ever baked anything - even a cookie. Bring something to eat because you will get hungry.",1502841600,,584,4.5

8572046,1,B00BOYHNRY,The main actor is a white guy acting in the role of an Asian (Taiwanese) guy.  It was just odd to watch it.  Kinda reminded me of the old days when they used white actors in Hollywood to make fun of Asians.  It was uncomfortable watching it.,1476921600,,241,4.085106382978723

8572051,5,B00BOYHNRY,"Lovely movie. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys a romantic comedy. It has its awkward moments of poor acting but nothing too bad. Worth the watch just click play and enjoy. Plus, who doesn't love watching how the bread is made.",1463356800,,230,4.634146341463414
