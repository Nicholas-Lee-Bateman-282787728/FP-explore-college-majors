Good picture and sound.
Wish there were more of them.
So good to watch good clean family entertainment.

5856609,5,B00DUJBWIW,"I bought volume one when it came out and was delighted when this companion collection finally came out.  I enjoy these a lot and highly recommend them. If you are not familiar with the series, they show MGM's idea of small-town life in the late '30s and '40s centered on a teen-age boy named Andy Hardy (Mickey Rooney), his family, his problems and love interests.  Mainly light comedy and a little drama thrown in.  Thoroughly enjoyable escapism to another era.",1378771200,3,462,4.75
5856610,4,B00DUJBWIW,Forget Barrimore was first Judge Hardy. Volume two covers all the Hardy films. Should have released it first - some overlap with Vol 1.,1376524800,,135,4.666666666666667
5856611,5,B00DUJBWIW,"The fifteen original Hardy family movies are real gems in MGM's crown from the late 1930's through the World War II years (I'll get to the 16th don't worry).  Originally planned as a ""B"" movie and not a series 'A Family Affair' was the surprise hit of 1937 and caught L.B. Mayer completely off guard with it's huge success.  So much so that theater owners were sending him plenty of telegrams clamoring for more Hardy family movies...especially that brash teen Andy Hardy!.  Mayer knew potential when he saw it and of course he ordered more pronto...another one for 1937...three more each for 1938 and 1939..and then periodically through 1946.  Of the original cast only Mickey Rooney and Sara Haden as Aunt Milly returned and all the other roles were re-cast.

America fell in love with the Hardy family as it has no other since and the small town of Carvel became the center of America's small town existence with the life, loves and travails of Andy Hardy and his parents and sisters and neighbors.  Lewis Stone came to embody Judge Hardy a little more nobly than Lionel Barrymore had originally played him in my opinion and acted as the anchor (ably supported by Fay Holden as Mrs. Hardy) as solidly embedded in Americana as Walt Disney's later family features ever were (who can forget he and Andy's 'mad to mad' conversations???.  Not to forget Cecelia Parker as Andy's sister Marian and Ann Rutherford (who died in 2012 at 94) as Andy's long time sweetheart Polly Benedict.  Later another Andy admirer named Betsy Booth (the granddaughter of the Hardy's next door neighbor) joins the whole troupe and falls hopelessly for Andy as well (played by the lady most associated with Mickey Rooney in film - the late great Judy Garland and their scenes are terrific in the Hardy series).

Thus America's affair with the Hardy family spanned almost ten tumultuous years (including the WWII years).  Love Laughs At Andy Hardy was the final in the original series in 1946 and then a dozen years later when MGM had fallen on hard times and was desperately trying to recreate some of its former glory came the 16th and last Hardy family film 'Andy Hardy Goes Home' which found Mickey Rooney returning to Carvel with all the original family members gathering sans Lewis Stone who had passed away in 1952.  It's a poignant send off to the series tho Stone's absence is felt acutely throughout and ultimately it failed to revive the series but is fondly remembered by fans for providing some sense of closure.

The movies focused mainly on Andy Hardy's High School, College and beginning of adulthood years with plenty of side plots for Judge Hardy and the family reflecting the modern concerns of small town Americans of the era.  Evenly balanced between drama and comedy throughout they are wonderfully entertaining even today and imagine my surprise when my 16 year old granddaughter and 19 year old grandson sat down with me a while back and watched 'A Family Affair' and loved it!!  We're moving on to the rest.

Recently Warner Brothers (who acquired the rights to the MGM library) have finally released all 16 movies on two sets (single sided dvds for those curious).  While not meticulously restored they are in fine shape for films from the 30's and 40's and for the first time since they were released provide access to the whole series in order (tho do your homework because they are not in order in the sets - but you can google the order and release years in 5 minutes).  The Andy Hardy Film Collection Volumes 1 & 2.  Volume 1 has six movies on six discs and Volume 2 has ten movies on five discs (don't ask why...just be grateful that they're finally available!).

I might add that I paid for these and did not receive them through Vine for those who accost me with 'are vine reviews honest since you get the merchandise for free!' never realizing how that impugns my honesty in the question itself.  Amazon is offering the two sets at very reasonable prices (cheaper than the WB Shop I can tell you!) and if you want to relive a simpler time with values that should be taught in all times then these movies are for you.  Many young MGM stars of the time that went on to bigger and better parts and movies and stardom are cycled through these films and you'll always be surprised by who shows up.  It's entertainment pure and simple.

Trust me on this one.  I know my movies.",1374969600,60,4381,4.652399481193256

Every show presents at least one moral dilemma to be dealt with and the values back then clearly are not present in America today. Makes you wish we could go back and fix what we screwed up. This is a great series of fun, clean and actually humorous movies that everyone will enjoy watching regardless of how old you are. Be aware that they are not in chronological order between volumes 1 and 2 and that a previous reviewer was nice enough to list their correct order.",1421020800,9,629,4.294117647058823

5856651,5,B00DUJBWIW,"I love the Andy Hardy films.  The stories are simple, but always engaging, perhaps in part because the Hardy family is so easy to like and Mickey Rooney is such a fine actor and a joy to watch.  It's nice to have movies where the crises are so small and personal and one knows that everything will work out, but it's still fun to see it happen.  These films are comfort food, but nourishing nonetheless.  It's lovely to get this big bunch of them in one set, at a reasonable (if not fantastic) price.
