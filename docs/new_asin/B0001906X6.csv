1977731,5,B0001906X6,"I am a huge CSI fan. If you've never watched it, first of all, say hi to everyone on Mars for me.. other than that, order your copy today. Have no doubts. There is no way you can be wrong about buying this DVD. Besides one small problem.
In a show, where one of the lead characters is having a hearing problem, how come there are no subtitles recorded? It's the down side of it all, that kind of takes the fun away when big latin words start flying around.
As I said, do not hesitate. Just order.",1081987200,3,496,4.071428571428571
1977732,5,B0001906X6,"As a huge C.S.I. fan, I cannot objectively rate this. I love C.S.I., and own the other two seasons. I just spent the weekend watching this (Yes I know I need a life! : ), but I felt it was a weekend well spent.
Even though C.S.I. had two plotlines that never worked in season three (Grissom's hearing loss, and Sara lusting over Grissom), this season contains some of the best C.S.I.'s yet. When the personal lives of the C.S.I's combine with the cases they are working on, you get some of the best acting out of this distinguished group of actors. The plotline of Eddie Willows' death, and how it effects Catherine is probably one of the most gripping ones of the season. Also, when Warrick puts his personal feelings for the victim, someone's daughter from his past, ahead of his criminalistic objectivity we see how fragile he really is.
In most every C.S.I. episode, there is an ""A"" story and a ""B"" story. At times, you wish that the C.S.I. writers would use only one story at a time, as it could get confusing. But other then that, I cannot find any horrific flaws.
Jerry Bruckheimer continues his reign as the modern day Jack Webb with his series ""Cold Case"", and ""Without a Trace"". The C.S.I. Miami and now New York series are watering down the name, but Bruckheimer continues to turn out hit after hit. Go with this C.S.I. season for a great DVD set.",1081036800,10,1358,4.479838709677419
1977733,5,B0001906X6,"CSI and company (Billy Petersen, George Eads) do it again in the 3rd season of the Eyeball Network's hit drama.  Starting out with the season 3 opener, Revenge is Best Served Cold, CSI quickly picks up right where season 2 left off.  By the end of the season, Gil's hearing is addressed, more cases are solved and Greg (Eric Szmanda) is still trying to win a date with Sara. All in all, this has to be one of the best CSI seasons to date.  With episodes like ""Fight Night"" and ""Blood Lust"" how can you go wrong by purchasing this set?  A must for any CSI fan!",1080864000,2,559,4.196261682242991

1977851,5,B0001906X6,"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation moved from strength to strength when Season 3 premiered on CBS in September 2002. With 23 suspenseful episodes, this police procedural had by now established itself as one of only a very few shows that I would make time to watch every week.

In CSI: Crime Scene Investigation Season 3, viewers are once again transported to the grave shift at the Las Vegas crime lab. Each week, shift supervisor Gil Grissom (William Peterson) and his team of highly trained forensic investigators, Catherine Willows (Marg Helgenberger), Warrick Brown (Gary Dourdan), Nick Stokes (George Eads), and Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox), tackle a wide range of cases that certainly challenge every one of their investigative and deductive skills.

Several extraordinarily capable lab technicians, working in their own specialties, assist the field investigators.  Most notable among them are Dr. Al Robbins (Robert David Hall), who joins the team as the Medical Examiner. Greg Sanders (Eric Szmanda) is the DNA technician, Archie Johnson (Archie Kao) the electronics whiz; and Bobby Dawson (Gerald McCullough) the firearms and ballistics expert. Rounding out the night shift is Captain Jim Brass (Paul Guilfoyle), a hard-boiled, cynical detective who serves as the police departments liaison with the crime lab.

CSI: Crime Scene Investigation Season 3 has several outstanding episodes, including The Accused is Entitled, where the team comes under the scrutiny of a private investigator who is trying to discredit their work on behalf of a movie star accused of a double murder.  In Lady Heathers Box, Catherines ex-husband is found murdered, and the life of her daughter is threatened when the car shes riding in with her father crashes and floods during a sudden downpour. Meanwhile, the rest of the team investigates a murder at Lady Heathers sex fetish club. An season-long story arc follows Gil as he slowly comes to grips with a hereditary condition that will possibly lead him to lose his hearing completely.

With its consistently high production values, CSI: Crime Scene Investigation really began hitting its stride in Season 3. It also became one of the most-watched shows on TV, averaging over 25 million viewers each week. Without question, its the best police procedural drama of its generation and perhaps of all time. Highly recommended.",1472601600,2,2353,5.278074866310161

1978137,5,B0001906X6,"An FYI on some glitches I have noticed while watching this set. (1) ""Meat Is Murder"" was by The Smiths, not Morrissey. (2) The Tylenol killer was in fact caught, it was a woman who was attempting to manipulate her husband's death in order to collect the insurance, and this was known at the time the show was filmed. But then, it is only when a show is very good to start with, that you even notice the occasional minor flaw.

Despite the occasional minor thing like this, the DVD sets have a lot of content and the quality of the episodes is pretty consistent. If you are considering buying one, it is very unlikely you would regret it, provided you have some interest or have liked other episodes you have seen.",1406937600,,713,4.401515151515151

That means nothing to you, but to me it means that I can watch season after season much quicker than someone who may have followed the show episode by episdoe when it first began.  It gives me a more heightened sense of detection for when things change, a little bit anyways.  And so I must say this season in particular was when the cast and writers were really getting the hang of things and the plots were still fresh.  I live in Las Vegas as well so hearing them say street names and landmarks just makes it that much better for me.

Shipping was speedy and it is one of many trusted sellers I buy from.

In this episode there is the additional bonus of seeing Pauly Perrette pre NCIS.
Be sure and watch all the episodes Lady Heather and Grissom appear in:
""Lady Heather's Box"", ""Pirates of the Third Reich"", ""The Good, the Bad and the Dominatrix""
and ""Leave Out All the Rest"". I bought them all.

1978204,1,B0001906X6,"THE WALLFLOWERS appeared live in THE ACCUSED IS ENTITLED performing EVERYBODY OUT OF THE WATER but Jakob Dylan was not included on the commentary or was the video for the song included on the Special Features. Big name band-little DVD notice.

The dwarf population in the United States was given spotlighting in A LITTLE MURDER, this was also Naren Shankar's writing debut having written for STAR TREK:THE NEXT GENERATION.

ABRA-CADAVER-William Peterson having become known for playing FBI agent Will Graham in MANHUNTER brought his costar Tom Noonan to guest as magician Zephyr Dillinger. Where was their commentary?

The Blue Paint Killer arc began in THE EXECUTION OF CATHERINE WILLOWS. Elizabeth Devine & Carol Mendolsohn deliberately wrote it to be open ended with BPK captured in a sequel episode.

Sara received more character development when she reopened a cold case in 1 HIT WONDER where she had to arrest a close friend for the murder of her husband. Then came the bomb that blew up in Sara's life when she discovered Hank was cheating on her in CRASH & BURN.

There WAS commentary on RANDOM ACTS OF VIOLENCE but not from Keith David & Gary Dourdan, the central actors of that episode.

LADY HEATHER'S BOX was also lacking in having no commentary from Timothy Carhartt & Madison McReynolds especially when you factor in the scene when Catherine has to rescue Lindsay from Eddie's sinking car.

Greg being a coin collector gets to use that knowledge when Grissom sends him undercover in PRECIOUS METAL which is where Greg fell in love with field work. This should have been Eric Szmanda's chance to shine more focus on Greg. Season's 4 & 5 would see Greg slowly doffing his labcoat for a field vest with his name on the front.

A NIGHT AT THE MOVIES paid tribute to the Hitchcock classic STRANGERS ON A TRAIN. Just as & THEN THERE WERE NONE was a literary tribute, this was a cinematic tribute. A testimonial to a seminal film director. The B-Plot had a rather creative cause of death for the teenage victim in that episode.

INSIDE THE BOX-what the f()<k were they thinking not having commentary on this? The return of Sam Braun, Braun is arrested for the murder of his mistress Vivian Verona. Catherine having her suspicions regarding paternity has Greg match her DNA with Braun's blood sample. CONFIRMATION! Sam Braun IS Catherine's father & this misappropriation of evidence is what allows Braun to get away with murder. The bank robbery proceeding all of this resulted in the murder of Detective Cyrus Lockwood who loved by every show fan. Where was the commentary from Marg Helgenberger, Jeffrey Sams & Scott Wilson? The events of this episode colored father & daughter's relationship till it met Its end with Braun's murder in BUILT TO KILL(7 premiere).",1365724800,,2770,4.876595744680851

This is another set of DVDs which have to be played in your computer's DVD tray with Windows Media Player, not in a DVD player box, in order to access Closed Captioning.

1978364,5,B0001906X6,"A smash hit from the moment of its 2000 debut, CSI: CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION has continued to remain one of the most popular, innovative, and critically acclaimed crime dramas in television history. Created by Anthony Zuiker and executive produced by movie maven Jerry Bruckheimer, the thrilling series centers on the Las Vegas Police Department's night-shift forensics unit, which utilizes cutting-edge technology to solve the often grisly crimes of a glamorous city whose constant influx of visitors makes it rife with criminal elements. Quickwitted detective Gil Grissom (William Petersen) leads the highly-skilled investigative team that includes his single-mother partner, Catherine Willows (Marg Helgenberger); hair and fiber expert, Nick Stokes (George Eads); former gambling addict, Warrick Brown (Gary Dourdan); and fresh-faced newbie, Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) with the help of tough-as-nails police captain, Jim Brass (Paul Guilfoyle) and efficient lab coroner Dr. Al Robbins (Robert David Hall).

Heavy on science, creative camerawork, and uncomfortably graphic depictions of violence, CSI is revered by fans and critics alike for its consistently gripping and well-written storylines, often inspired by real-life cases. This collection presents all 23 episodes from the series' third season.",1197158400,,1302,5.962566844919786

It is within this season that we get to see the real human side of the CSIs; they're not cold nor devoid of emotion, and some of the cases go straight to the heart for these hard-working, crime solving supercops.

If crime shows is your thing, as it is mine, this is definitely a season to add to your collection!",1166572800,,459,3.989130434782609

1978401,5,B0001906X6,"Having absorbed the third season, it's amazing how this series continues to grow both dramatically and technically.  In this season, apart from the usual puzzling crime scenes, the stars of the show find themselves in varying crises:  Grissom's hearing loss gets worse and a decision must be made; Katherine's personal life undergoes a tragic change; Warrick finds himself involved in an internal affairs investigation; Sarah loses one love and contemplates a surprising replacement; Nick takes up a dangerous new hobby; and Brass continues to be his wonderfully sardonic self.  We get dwarves, stand up comics, vigilantes, murderous actors and more.  The cast as always is impeccable with William Petersen continuing to be the most complex character on television.  Brilliant show just keeps getting better!",1151539200,3,808,5.483870967741935
1978402,5,B0001906X6,"By the third season of any popular series, it's not unusual for creative plot ideas to slow down, the acting to become stagnant, and the show to generally weaken. Not so with CBS's runaway smash hit ""CSI: Crime Scene Investigation"". Like its first two years, season three was full of drama, mystery, and episodes that kept viewers on the edge of their seats.

If season one introduced audiences to the world of forensic science and season two saw the characters become a bit more comfortable with each other, season three was full of action and character-driven drama previously unseen on the show. Gil Grissom (William Petersen) continued to struggle with his growing deafness and increasing chemistry with Sara; Catherine Willows (Marg Helgenberger) managed to not only lose her ex-husband in a car accident but discover the identity of her father and blow up the lab. Warrick Brown (Gary Dourdan) learned that personal actions have consequences for the victims in his cases, Nick Stokes (George Eads) began his ongoing competition with Sara for Grissom's approval, and Sara Sidle (Jorja Fox) just plain had a bad year, from finding out she was her boyfriend's 'other woman' to nearly being killed in a lab explosion. Greg Sanders (Eric Szmanda) continued on his quest to become a CSI, while Jim Brass (Paul Guilfoyle) and Doc Robbins (Robert David Hall) continued to process some of Las Vegas's craziest.

However, the personal dramas took a backseat to the reality of crime in Vegas as the nightshift continued to investigate some of the most compelling cases to date. 'The Accused is Entitled' featured a popular actor going up for murder and putting CSI on trial in the process (not entirely unlike what happened with OJ Simpson a decade earlier), 'Fight Night' took viewers into the underworld of boxing, and 'Inside the Box' combined the death of a police officer with mob ties and the high-stakes world of a casino mogul. In addition to these episodes, season highlights included 'The Execution of Catherine Willows', 'Random Acts of Violence', and the 90-minute episode 'Lady Heather's Box', a mini-movie that brought the return of infamous dominatrix Lady Heather (Melinda Clarke) in a mystery so full of twists it will have you glued to your chair.

In addition to all twenty-three season episodes, the DVD box set includes a tour of the police lab, a behind-the-scenes view of the writers' room, interviews with the cast, and episode commentaries full of information on how each episode comes together.

Having passed the sophomore hurdle, in its third season, ""CSI"" proved that it was capable of delivering quality entertainment, and is still going strong.",1148428800,6,2670,5.0613636363636365

I started with Season 1 (never saw it on t.v., just started watching the DVDs) and am now on Season Three.  This has to be one of the best cast shows out there -- the chemistry between the CSIs is amazing, the story lines are fresh, and it has quickly become my favorite drama (with 24 being a VERY close second).  Only one thing about the other reviews -- yes, Nick's character is gorgeous, but how about that Warrick?  He's not what you might think of as movie star gorgeous, but there is something about him that is just absolutely amazing -- nice face, body -- everything.  Grissom is also attractive because he's so intelligent and seems to know something about everything.  Sara has a great voice, and well I could say something great about all of the character's physical qualities, but the most important thing is that the show is captivating, innovative, and fresh.  Season after season, you're drawn into each and every story line.  I love CSI and hope it stays on the air for another 10 years!",1132704000,,1082,4.541237113402062
1978406,4,B0001906X6,"Between CSI Miami and this, the original series, I think that this series wins hands down.  I remember first seeing Petersen (Gil Grissom) in Manhunter (the first movie based on Thomas Harris' book the Red Dragon and the perfect movie adaptation of that book) when he was quite a bit younger and thinner but it is not his leading man qualities that make him so appealing.

The writers/producers/directors of this series manage to recreate some of the things that make British crime dramas so fascinating-- they 1) don't pull away from the dark to contrive a happy ending; 2)they don't hesitate to portray the lead characters as vulnerable and ""strange""; and 3) they look for really great faces, not conventionably pretty or ugly actor, for the parts.

Sure, it's science fantasy in the sense that things don't happen  in real life the way they happen in the CSI lab,  and it's not great art, but its a great way to pass time.",1128384000,3,925,4.685185185185185

Each episode is such a unique story, with twisted human emotions

and perceptions of the truth and the real truth. And how the human mind

is so animalistic. This season only had one returning character, but made it

worth while to get more insight of the character of Gil Crissom. And Warrick

Brown returns to his old

neighborhood to give you a perspective of his past.

season as mush as 1 and 2.",1123804800,,634,4.387931034482759

Some of the best episodes of Season 3 are:

-Let the Seller Beware

-The Execution of Catherine Willow

-Blood Lust

-Random Acts of Violence (a great Warrick episode)

-Lady Heather's Box

-Crash and Burn (love the parallelism of the two plots)

-A Night at the Movies (a great nod to Alfred Hitchcock's Strangers on the Train)

Also, philosophy of the good, bad, and justice discussed sometime in a very advanced level. Another fact, forensic science enrollment increased after airing CSI.

Outshining shows like Criminal Intent and NYCS, this has been one omy favourites and still remains as sharp and potent as it was when originally aired. Especially impressive since this has the possibility to become a very repetitive show, but thankfully the writers have kept it real without sacrificing any sense of entertainment.

1978444,5,B0001906X6,"""Whooooo are yo-ou o-ou?""  The best theme song of any show on TV is topped only by the actual quality of the show.  Season 3 picks up just where season 2 left off, and doesn't miss a beat in terms of show or acting quality.  Every episode of this show has me glued to the screen, and it doesn't stop here either (see season 4 and beyond).

This show remains one of the top couple shows in the ratings, and has brought about a huge new interest in forensic science.  Colleges across the country are starting new criminal science programs or increasing their existing ones.  This show is not only incredibly interesting, but is also making an actual difference in the world.  There are few shoes on TV today that can say that.

William Petersen's acting is simply brilliant as Gil Grissim, and with marvolous support from actors and actresses like Marg Helgenberger (Catherine Willows), George Eads (Nick Stokes), Gary Dourdan (Warrick Brown), Jorja Fox (Sara Sidle), Paul Guilfoyle (Captain Jim Brass), and Eric Szmanda (Greg Sanders), the show can't (and doesn't in any way) miss.

Another 'but' and a big one: just about all the viewers l know - friends, neighbors, co-workers - complain about the same thing: in the show, why is Marg Helgenberger all too often referred to as 'beautiful' or 'gorgeous' or 'lovely' when she is simply an ordinary-looking, run-of-the-mill actress with tight, low-cut clothing? Really! She hardly stands up to any lovely woman, so the question is: is she married to the producer or the Studio Head to get such unwarranted acclaim?",1104883200,3,659,4.831858407079646

The hightlights have got to be the season opener, A Little Murder, Last Laugh, snuff etc but it truelly is the cast who make this show, great going & the team is the heart, George Eads has done a superb job with bringing Nicky Stokes on even when his character is so overlooked.

I was thrilled when a friend let be borrow the first season DVD set of CSI and I immdeiatly started hunting them down.

I enjoyed the third season as much at the first two.  I loved the ending which left you wondering about how Grissom's surgery would turn out and if Sara and Grissom would get together or not.

What I also appreciate is the fact that while they give us intresting tastes of the lives of the CSI personel the do not let it get in the way of the mysteries.  I used to watch ""Judging Amy"" but after a while it switched from being about cases to being about Amy's crazy family life and in my oppinion just another soap opera.

I have all 3 seasons, and can't wait until season 4 is released.  This is a fantastic show with realistic crime scene depictions, often taken off the front pages of today's newspapers.  The twists and turns make it fun to try to solve the crime before it shows you at the end, and some cases I find truly baffling!  The tools are real, and I've gotten to the point I have a deep interest in forensic science.  I've even thought of going back to school for it because of this TV SHOW!  I think this is my favorite show EVER..even above ER, Third Watch, and Crossing Jordan!  If you haven't seen it yet, you're missing something truly unique!  Furthermore, I like the original CSI in the Las Vegas setting, and don't much care for the spinoff of CSI: Miami.

I like to pretend that I'm watching Will Grahem (aka Gill Grisom) as Manhunter 20+ years later still catching bad guys. Worth every penny, all three seasons were watched in a month.

I say ""back to being the best"" because I thought the quality of season 2 dipped a little from the blockbuster first season.
I seriously doubt any viewer needs a recommendation from me or others to be motivated to buy this DVD set.  Primarily I was compelled to question another reviewer's accusation that 4 ""reruns"" were included in this third season set. Where did he get THAT?  If you check the season episode finder for the first two seasons, which the reviewer says he has, you'll find no such repeats.  Has he been watching broadcast episodes and now calls them reruns?  That's pretty funny!

The highest rated show on prime time TV managed to get better and better by each passing episode as the crimes investigated by Gil Grissom (William Petersen, never better) grow all the more bizarre.  Superstar producer Jerry Bruckheimer's mega production values give the show a gloss that no other prime time TV drama has, and the cast is better than ever, with special nods going to Gary Dourdan and the gorgeous Jorja Fox.  The ever growing plot twists in various episodes owe a huge debt to the early years of the long running Law & Order, as C.S.I. finds ever growing greatness just as the aformentioned show did in it's prime years ago.  Just as with the previous two C.S.I. season collections, Paramount has hardly assembled any extras for this set, which is yet again a major disappointment.
