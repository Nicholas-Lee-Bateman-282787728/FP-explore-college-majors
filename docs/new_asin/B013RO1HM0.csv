7370836,5,B013RO1HM0,"Love Tom Selleck and the Jesse Stone series. They are great stories, well written, produced and directed. A perfect fit, other than a good western, for Tom Selleck to star in.",1452297600,2,175,4.67741935483871

7370838,5,B013RO1HM0,"I have always enjoyed the Jesse Stone movies, but at the release rate of one a year, they come out so infrequently that I would forget some aspects of the basic story line between them. This way, all eight of the Jesse Stone movies, including a prequel that shows how Stone wound up in his rural village, can be watched in sequence (the order is printed on the storage case). This set started out at more than $100, but by Christmas it was a third of that price, and well worth it. I plan to watch these again. Since they were released over about a decade, you can see the characters age in place, so it's realistic. A truly enjoyable set.",1451779200,20,639,4.289256198347108

7370842,5,B013RO1HM0,"If you like a detective series with a soul, this Jesse Stone series offers it up in the form of haunting and original music, inspired scenery and sets (love Stone's waterside home), quirky and realistic plots, insightful casting, gorgeous cinematography, and a sensitive but tough detective with Tom Selleck playing Jesse Stone.

Jesse has a few of his own mysteries to solve, along with the ones he confronts in his work. Is he ever going to not answer the phone when his ex-wife calls and just forget about her? Will he be able to stop drinking? Can he keep his community happy in the small northeastern town he polices and hang onto his job? Will he ever find a woman who is sympatico?

In between battling his own demons, therapy sessions with his shrink (William Devane), and cryptic conversations with just about everybody including his dog, Jesse manages to solve quite a few crimes with his non-police manual methods.

In analyzing why this series is compelling, one reason is that it just feels real. Selleck inhabits the role of Jesse Stone with ease. You feel like he's playing some aspect of himself. The secondary characters are strong. You don't feel like you are watching a show. You feel like it's real life. And you care about the characters. Even the crooks have a sort of likability in some instances.

This is the kind of series you could watch every year.  Selleck said in an interview that he thinks someone will want to produce another episode. Hallmark did this fall titled LOST IN PARADISE to be released on DVD January 26, 2016.  In the meantime, you can just re-watch the episodes in this complete set until they do.",1449273600,42,1643,4.7073170731707314

7370907,5,B013RO1HM0,"Seldom does an actor inhabit a character as fully as Tom Selleck does Robert B Parker's iconic Jesse Stone, hardboiled former L.A. detective, now Chief of Police in the small New England town of Paradise.  The eight TV movies in this collection capture all but the recent TV movie in the series (2015's Lost in Paradise).  For fans of the series, it doesn't get any better than this.

The Jesse Stone movies are slow-burners, typically beginning with the commission of a serious crime.  Stone, battling alcoholism and lingering feelings for his ex-wife, seems to need the focus of solving a crime to keep his life on track, and Paradise seems to have a surprising number of dark corners for such a small town.  Jesse is more interested in justice than in securing convictions in court.  He can be just as ruthless as his opponents, but he always has an eye out for those who can't defend themselves.

The brooding New England landscape (Nova Scotia fills in) is almost a character in these movies.  The supporting cast is terrific, with fleshed out characters who will make multiple appearances across the life of the series.  Stone's unorthodox methods will have him at odds with the town council, the State Police, the members of his own police department, and even the parade of women in his life.  The slow pace of some of the movies puts a lot of weight on Tom Selleck to make Jesse Stone that interesting, and he succeeds.  This collection is highly recommended to fans of the series.",1460073600,,1490,4.714285714285714

7370910,5,B013RO1HM0,"This a great collection for Tom Selleck and Robert B. Parker fans!  I love the story lines and the Jesse Stone character's methodology in solving murders.

7370960,5,B013RO1HM0,Jesse Stone is an interesting  character portrayed by Tom Selleck.  The entire cast is first rate.  The stories are compelling without a lot of noise making.  They are slow moving and beautifully filmed.  If you are a fan of fast loud action this series might not be your cup of tea.  If you prefer quieter mysteries these are for you.,1455580800,4,335,4.5

7370988,3,B013RO1HM0,My husband and I love Tom Selleck like he was close family.  We have all his westerns and watch them regularly and this collection was the icing on the cake . . . but only the first 3 movies have subtitles in Spanish and my husband doesn't  speak any English let alone read it.  I have to stop the movie every 10 minutes to translate everything that's going on.  We still enjoy it but not as much as we thought we would.  Next time make sure your movies have Spanish and French subtitles - we are your nearest neighbors and greatest buyers!  Thank you,1453593600,3,551,4.25

Including the 9th ""Lost in Paradise"", (2015). I don't own this set, but if they come out with a 10th in the series and make it a complete set, I would own it.
