Old time comedians in this movie, not including William Shatner, but Andy Devine, who must be in his 80s in this, and Marty Alan,  It's okay.  At the end, you get some nice five minutes of film footage of the whale shows at Marineland.  Other than that, had the movie been a little shorter, the story would be more tolerable, but it kind of goes on a little too long to the point of predictability.",1353888000,,454,4.125
