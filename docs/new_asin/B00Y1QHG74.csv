7207454,2,B00Y1QHG74,"I remembered this film as much better than it was -- perhaps because I last saw it when it first came out, when I was all of nine years old. I knew nothing then of Shavian wit, so the story was enough, especially when Androcles began dancing around the arena with the lion.

The first mistake was the screenplay, at least in the opening.

The film begins with material that is not in the original play, and was clearly not written by Shaw. Instead of priming us with sparkling, satirical wit, the script gives us a flat, heavy handed picture of a meek and not very interesting Walter Mitty Androcles hounded by an incredibly nasty, shrewish wife, in what must be Elsa Lanchester's most unrewarding performance. The ""humor,"" if one can call it that, depends on the most juvenile slapstick.

But the biggest mistake was the director. Chester Erskine had no feeling for Shaw.

By the time we get to Shaw's own dialogue, the damage is done and the audience is not prepared to be receptive. To make things worse, many of Shaw's most ironic lines have been cut, and the pace throughout the movie is excruciatingly slow, with, as theatre people like to say, holes you could drive a truck through.

Jean Simmons and Robert Newton are well cast. Simmons is fine, a perfect Lavinia. And Newton would be a perfect Ferrovius, but he was directed to deliver his lines as if every word were reluctant to come out. Victor Mature looks good as the Roman Captain, but he takes the whole thing far too seriously, with not a trace of the worldly, philosophic outlook with which the lines cry out to be said.

Maurice Evans was one of the last century's finest actors. But he's far too light in his role as the Roman Emperor. He has the wit, but lacks the weight. It's impossible to take him seriously as a despot. Claude Rains was a much more believable Roman Emperor in ""Caesar and Cleopatra.""

One can't help comparing this film with Gabriel Pascal's other Shavian films, all of them far more effective, directed by Anthony Asquith and Pascal himself. ""Pygmalian"" and ""Major Barbara"" were perfectly cast, written, and played. They stand among the greatest films of all time. ""Caesar and Cleopatra"" was not a commercial success, but has since gained somewhat in stature. All three had the advantage of screenplays adapted by Shaw himself, and all three were directed and acted with brio.

I wish I could rate this film higher, out of my love for the play. But that would unjustly credit a work that does the play a disservice.",1368230400,5,2508,4.632882882882883
7207455,5,B00Y1QHG74,"I always loved this film.  I do wonder though why one of the most profound of Shaw's lines was cut from this film.  The centurion tells Livinia that her death will mean nothing. She answers ""then, why kill me"".  Not in the film.",1364860800,4,228,4.255813953488372

8717383,1,B00Y1QHG74,"Review of Androcles and the Lion
Hot Toasty Rag, July 24, 2017

I think Androcles and the Lion was supposed to be a comedy, but it was so awful, I couldn't be sure. In the midst of the 1950s biblical craze, Hollywood created a film about a group of slaves who are rounded up and sent to the gladiator pit to fight a lion, because they are Christians. Of course, the Roman bad guys are all portrayed as buffoons, since they are not Christians, and the overwhelming theme is Christians are good, and everyone who isn't is a terrible bad guy who should learn his lesson. That theme isn't necessarily a bad one, especially since Hollywood made a ton of biblical films in the 1950s and 1960s, but the ridiculous feel of the film ruins it, not to mention the over-the-top moronic performance of Alan Young as the title character, Maurice Evans as Caesar, Elsa Lanchester, Gene Lockhart, Robert Newton, Jim Backusthe list goes on. Jean Simmons, a Christian slave, and Victor Mature, a Roman soldier who falls in love with her, aren't particularly over-the-top, but the few scenes they have together are hardly worth it. In reality, if hed been found hiding and protecting a slave, and if shed repeatedly sassed her captors, they both would have been killed.

Alan Young loves animals, so when he comes across an injured lion in the middle of the road, he coos it with baby talk and takes the thorn out of his paw. Its pretty ridiculous, almost as ridiculous as the rest of the film.",1500854400,,1475,4.583333333333333

This is why I shop almost exclusively on Amazon for movies that I want to keep. I feel I can always rely on the various vendors selling through Amazon. So far, I have never been disappointed.

Thanks,
