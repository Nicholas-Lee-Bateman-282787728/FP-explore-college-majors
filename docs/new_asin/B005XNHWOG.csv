8488797,3,B005XNHWOG,"Nicole Johnson (Natasha Henstridge) is a well-respected criminology professor who defends her star student (Brea Grant) from charges that she brutally murdered her roommate. But soon after Professor Johnson wins her student's release, doubts begin to emerge about the crime, and Professor Johnson finds herself in danger. The evidence is irrefutable, and incredible.",1390521600,,366,5.9245283018867925

8488800,5,B005XNHWOG,"I really liked this film. Very suspenseful. I really like the role Natasha Henstridge played. Good story and great directing.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Perfect-Student/dp/B005XNHWOG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Perfect Student</a>",1329868800,3,285,10.44
8488801,1,B005XNHWOG,"I groaned as the film opened with ""Inspired by True Events."" Too late. I had already paid for it. Natasha Henstridge sadly plays a college law professor who can't spring her innocent brother from jail. In the opening scene, a college girl gets killed. Her nerdy roommate, Brea Gant with some facial zits, whose only alibi was an empty library, gets blamed.

The story had many plot holes. I had to laugh at the bad writing. The victim was last seen with a boy, no DNA rape test. The boy is never questioned. The roommate is charged with circumstantial evidence. Her attorney was idiotic. The police action was bad, especially for LA that has the resources. Henstridge dons her CSI gear to solve the crime...she looks at Facebook profiles and uses her cell phone camera. At one point she gets a message ""Leave it Alone."" Oh the tension just builds and oozes...NOT!

And you don't want to break into a California TV home because they keep a golf club by the bedroom door for protection!

There are no girls in plaid skirts as seen on the cover (I could have added a star for that). This was made for TV quality...about 1970.

No f-bombs. There is an opening, dimly lit sex scene (brief nudity?).",1328918400,2,1193,4.5607476635514015
8488802,1,B005XNHWOG,"Stereotypes of female college roommates - one nerdy; the other a partier. One dies; guess which one? So the nerdy roommate get's blamed because she's jealous of her ex-roommates popularity. The person to the rescue is their shared prof who happens to teach about the justice system and it's inadequacies, and so happens to also have a brother in jail because of it's inadequacies. So prof becomes a defender of her nerdy student who is in jail for reasons so flimsy that you would think this was being filmed in Syria. The prof, everyone calls Professor, and the cop, everyone calls Detective - how formal - are as stereotyped as any that Hollywood has ever produced. Prof acts like she's never even been in a classroom in any capacity student, custodian, whatever. Cop acts like he's never even seen a police officer or been in a police station in any capacity.

Wouldn't be a movie unless there's some twist which is that the prof spends the entire movie trying to prove the innocence of her nerdy student when she's just a devil of a person in disguise. By the way, how did she make it into college? She and her accomplice surfer dude boyfriend (goof: he's surfing in 2 foot waves that only break 15 feet from shore - what an animal!) both get snagged at the end. And, just as predictably, the prof's brother is sent free.

Acting was read the lines tolerable from mostly TV-series and B movie actors - well, it pays the bills. Directing was really rough as the cuts and scene jumps made the movie not very suspenseful. Mustang chase scene with screeching tires and curvy roads was distractingly pointless and when our prof brakes from 60mph on a short dirt pull off without skidding out of control was just not believable.",1327795200,4,1726,4.618892508143323
8488803,4,B005XNHWOG,"This has no doubt been done before but the cast takes the script and makes it interesting anyway, with some twists and surprises along the way, as a college professor tries to solve the murder of one of her female students.",1327622400,6,223,4.463414634146342
