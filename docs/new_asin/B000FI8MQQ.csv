At 40 minutes long, it's a mix of average (at best) images of nature, with terrible clipart images floating and bouncing around the screen, all set to elevator music with the occasional nature sound thrown in for good (or bad) measure.

The images are repeated frequently, many of them are not exactly sharp, and the cut-and-paste animals on some of the images aren't very professional.

Our sixth-month-old son was more interested in chewing the box than watching the video, which did not hold his attention at all. If you have a decent digital camera, you could very easily create a slideshow of your own to make something more personal, and likely with better quality images. Having said that, you would need to do a lot of travelling, as there are images from around the world included here, it's just that they aren't outstanding.

On the bright side, it's only 40 minutes long. On the negative side, it's 40 minutes too long.",1347753600,,1171,4.642512077294686
