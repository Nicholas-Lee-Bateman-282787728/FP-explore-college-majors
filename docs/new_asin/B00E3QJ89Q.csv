8600703,4,B00E3QJ89Q,"Its been many-many decades since I read The Borrowers by Mary Norton, so I was not overly put off by the story changes presented in this film.  In this version, the book is reduced to a Christmas advent calendar, parceling out the story in sections.  Were introduced to the Borrowers through the derring-do of Pod Clock (Christopher Eccleston).  He scales a cupboard to borrow a piece of candy.  This incites granny Driver to rip up her floorboards, trying to stab the little thieves.  She also enlists the aid of a disreputable professor (Stephen Fry as Mildeye) and his psychotic assistant who is anxious to dissect the Homo sapiens redactus.  For Christmas sake, the Clocks escape with the bad professor hot on their trail.  He has a point to prove!

This version has a certain amount of humor, teen angst, action sequences, and lots of derring-do by a host of characters.  Its quite fun.  There are a few background tunes that are warbled now and then, totally forgettable.  Not bad for a pseudo-Christmas movie.",1449792000,,1016,4.815028901734104

8600709,5,B00E3QJ89Q,"The story line is very interesting, I bought it because it has Christopher Eccleston in it, he was my favorite Doctor in Doctor Who, but the story keeps you engrossed. Def worth buying and watching several times.",1391212800,4,212,4.756756756756757
8600710,5,B00E3QJ89Q,"This is a movie based on The Borrowers books. If you are not determined to have the exact storylines that are in the books this is an enjoyable movie.
The storyline tells of a boy whose mother has died and he and his father, who is trying to make money, are living with his grandmother. The grandmother knows she has little people stealing things and living under her floorboards. The borrower family consists of a father (Christopher Eccleston of Dr. Who fame) a mother and 16 year old daughter Arriety who has been sheltered and longs to get out of their little home. She does and inadvertently gives away their existence, but the boy is determined to protect them especially from Professor Mildeye who wants to prove the little peoples' existence.

It is an adventure story with some family values thrown in. The special effects are okay and enough to enchant those who might enjoy the tale. It's one of those rare films- made for family viewing. It takes place at Christmas time, so could even serve as a Christmas movie.

It does have English subtitles and is 1 hour and 28 minutes long. There are extras with the cast talking about their experiences with The Borrowers books and showing how the special effects were created. It's still a nice little film as long as you are not expecting a line by line storyline from the books.",1390089600,7,1334,4.624472573839663
8600711,3,B00E3QJ89Q,"Mary Norton is the genius responsible for ""The Borrowers"" and it's a genius she created in 1951 and continued over three decades with four sequels. She established a story so strong that millions of people not only fell in love with these characters but they found they could not tolerate the change of plot or characters. The story centers around teenager Arriety, a five inch tall girl with parents named Pod and Homily. Circumstances having to do with Arriety speaking to a ""Human Bean"" cause a chain of events that change their lives, forcing them to move house, and, in this film, at a battle of wits with Mr. Wildeye (A small part in Norton's books, he is a gypsy, but a 2011 film must be politically correct and gypsies are no longer politically correct. Is this the result of their maltreatment by the public or their near eradication by the Nazi's?)

 The special effects in this film are period appropriate and are, therefore, better than the 1972 film with Dame Judith Anderson (at her best), Tammy Grimes and Eddie Albert. Those effects aside, that version remains the best performances. They certainly are not in this film.

It is not the fault of the cast but rather a collection of screenwriters who bastardized the original story in an attempt to create something ""fresh"" for today's children (add a little more violence and competitive drive and any producer will believe he has the key) and then some of the blame deserves to go with the director, Tom Harper. The story itself takes on a mild feeling of The Borrowers Meet Rambo."" Arriety and her family used intelligence and creativity to by-pass those human beings who were dangerous to them. This film seems to take away a lot of the wit, creativity and, sadly, character quirks that made each character so precious. Harper, sadly, believes that remarkable effects will somehow cover this up0. Either that or he didn't notice the loss of kindness and (dare I say it?) humanity.

 We are best to simply re-read the books, then buy the 1972 version. The 1992 version isn't bad and includes the first two books, but this film (as well as the John Goodman version) is a rather sad disappointment. If you have not read the books then you may well be amused by this film but if you are looking to re-create the feelings you had with the books, it just won't happen here.",1379894400,12,2335,4.671532846715328
