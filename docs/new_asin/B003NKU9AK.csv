4159820,5,B003NKU9AK,"Dear God,

Would you please inspire film-makers to make more movies like the Letters to God that I just watched.  The world you created for us has become a very cold place with hate, greed and violence everywhere.  Hollywood adds to this by continuing to make movies and Reality Shows that depict the worst in our society.  This movie gave me a renewed hope that there are still good people and values on our Planet Earth and hopefully with your help, Writers, Directors and Producers will create more films like this one.

Regardless of your religiousl persuasion, I think a person would have a heart of stone not to have been touched by the message of this movie.  We all have or will have many difficult challenges and situations in our lives. As I watched the film, I felt comforted to know that I wasn't alone in the way I have felt at times as trials came into my life.

I hope people who see this will get in touch with you soon and share this with their family, friends and neighbors.  One of the best movies that had a powerful message since I saw Pay it Forward, which has caught on in our Politically Correct Society. Thank you God for the people that made this movie.",1281484800,55,1179,4.400921658986175
4159821,5,B003NKU9AK,"I loved the messages the boy's father started to God.

It reminded me of that Haley Joel osment movie where he did a good deed and told the next someone to pass it on.",1281139200,5,167,3.911764705882353
4159822,4,B003NKU9AK,"The movie has a wonderful message and more than being sad it was uplifting.

While the movie does tug at your heart strings. Letters to God is a good movie. We want Tyler to get better. We want his family and friends to be strong. We want everyone who is touched by his story to find the Lord.

The acting is good. The storyline moves and you find yourself really caring about these people. I love the scenes of Tyler and his friend Samantha. Tyler and his brother. Brady the mailman who eventually is saved by Tyler's Letters to God are all very moving.

Not overly religious? Don't worry.
While it is obviously a religious movie, I don't believe messages are crammed down your throat as in some religious themed movies. The movie is a feel good movie with a beautiful message of friendship, strength, inspiration, prayer, second chances and dignified endings.",1280620800,84,861,4.651315789473684
4159823,5,B003NKU9AK,"This movie came out at the appropriate time and I was lucky enough to watch it at a time in my life when I was asking for a sign from above. God, thank you for hearing my prayers, for answering them through this movie, and for re-lightening in me the flame of not giving-up. It's definitely a movie that is worth seeing and will helped you find your path and purpose.",1279238400,32,367,4.183098591549296
4159824,5,B003NKU9AK,"This is probably the best movie I've seen in a long, long time! I was thrilled to see a movie that totally smashed the modern non-religious mentality. Thank God that this story has been told! I hope and pray to see more like it.",1275264000,84,228,4.204545454545454
4159825,5,B003NKU9AK,"I can't say enough about this movie. The deep faith in God and the simplicity of how he prays.  I walked out of the movie with a fire inside that I have not felt for a long time.  My friend and I promoted the movie to our school principle and also put it in the church bulletin as a must so for the whole family.  Please go out of your way to see this film, you won't regret it.",1274227200,37,378,3.759493670886076
4159826,5,B003NKU9AK,"May 16, 2010 - this movie was wonderful. I saw it today and although it wasn't in many theaters, I drove across town to see it and am glad I did.  It took me back to a time in my life when I discussed everything with God and things were better. I want to get back to that place in life again.  Look forward to the movie coming out on DVD and watching it again with family and friends.",1273968000,32,384,3.848101265822785
4159827,5,B003NKU9AK,"This is an incredible movie. It lit a fire within me- I now want to know Jesus better. Unfortunately, it is in only a few theaters. I drove from Woodland Hills Ca, to Simi valley to see it and it was well worth the trip. When it comes out on Video I will buy it for my friends and family.",1271376000,84,288,3.816666666666667

4159830,5,B003NKU9AK,"Wonderfully Depicted. Though God did not give this boy cancer, it was used for good. This boy clearly allowed himself to be a warrior for Christ. Sweet, touching, and definitely a tear jerker.
It definitely ignites the desire to be more active and see past the faults of others. Though I appreciated Fireproof as well I feel this was much better. The sheer number of letters of the boy and not for himself were just amazing, much like pay it forward.

4159838,1,B003NKU9AK,"I was forced to watch this movie while with my son at a care now.  It played in the waiting room as well as the exam room.  It is god awful (pun intended).  Crappy acting, creepy mailman, and every adult appears to be brain dead.  This is the worst form of the Christian ""feel-good"" genre.  Why the hell would your write a letter to god?  That's what prayer is for, you stupid kid.  Must have brain cancer.",1516492800,,406,4.194805194805195
4159839,5,B003NKU9AK,"Some people might find this a depressing movie about a young boy with cancer.  I found it to be a very inspirational movie about a young boy dealing courageously with an unfortunate life situation.  Based on a true story, the 8-yar old is shown going through trials in life, but dealing with them in a very positive way.  His courage and faith changed the lives of the people he dealt with, and enabled him to deal with a situation that he had no control over.  The movie inspired me to think more positively about my daily trials, which don't even come close to the young boy the story is about.  There were humorous add-ins as well.",1515369600,,634,4.431034482758621

4159853,5,B003NKU9AK,"I rented this movie and I was happy I did so. I watched this with my family and we were touched by this heart wrenching, bittersweet, but praiseworthy film. Most Christian movies on the market usually are pushed aside by entertainment consumers as ""bad acting"" or ""too cheesy,"" this movie had none of that. Still, while I admit a few sections of the movie were predictable, it was nonetheless impactful. Keep in mind that it was based  on a true story, so cheesy or not, this is a movie set and cast on a person's life. All that to say, I encourage at least a renting of this movie. Like me, you won't regret it.",1498262400,3,612,4.321739130434783

4159903,2,B003NKU9AK,"This movie was very disturbing for me and for my three daughters too. The movie seemed to be saying that God gave this boy cancer so he could be a Warrior for God. While there were some very good things in the movie, I do not agree that this particular assertion is Biblical. I believe we get horrible diseases because, since God gave mankind free will and Adam and Eve made the wrong choice, we live in a broken, fallen world. I think this grieves God but He hasn't given up on us. He is always with us if we have repented and asked him to be our Father. I think this boy was a strong, beautiful witness of how Christ loves us and is always with us, even in our struggles. I will even agree that  the boy was a Warrior, but I do not agree that he was created to get cancer so he could be a Warrior. Maybe they didn't really mean to say that, but that is how is came across to me.",1461196800,,880,3.9717514124293785

4160267,3,B003NKU9AK,"I watched it with my 11-year old daughter, who got very involved in it.  I usually love inspirational tearjerkers that are based on real life (as this one was), but I had very mixed feelings about this movie. I certainly appreciated the themes of interconnectedness and the importance of personal choices in times of crisis. I also liked the exploration of the idea that those who are seriously ill can choose to build a legacy through their actions.  What spoiled it for me was that every few minutes I was rudely distracted from these themes by yet another reference to conservative Christian ideals--some one was always praying 'to the Lord' or thinking out loud about what Jesus would do, or telling a folksy story about why hands should be clasped a certain way when people pray. The smugness underlying the certainty that there is but a single 'right' way to get through difficulties and make decisions cheapened the positive messages and made the acting feel stiff and characters seem like the stereotypes they were--sad,mom, angry teen brother, supportive and kindly grandma, saintly dead father, kindly neighbor. That people were pondering spiritual matters was great; that they all found the same answers seems to me both unlikely and very limiting.  The main characters were decently (though certainly not superbly) acted.  If there had been less preaching and more diversity of character and belief, it would have felt more realistic and ultimately more satisfying. If you watch it, prepare for proselytizing.",1441324800,,1521,5.096385542168675

4160271,5,B003NKU9AK,"A great movie and profound messages in the story.  I loved it and am recommending it to everyone I can.  It's just like God to use everything and
now let any actions or messages go unlearned to those who are seeking........and, maybe not seeking, but He knows and calls us all to come to Him.  How precious the letters.  How precious the life of one who truly grew to know God in such a profound way.  Sometimes it takes illness and
death to ""get it"".  The circle of peoples whose lives were touched was all a part of God's scheme of using the circumstances in a way that opened new doors to believe, finding life in new ways, by fighting for a son after messing up........to even the bar tender who was supportive and loving in his own way.  AH, LIFE IS A MIRACLE.  AND, we need to be grateful for each breath we have as it is the generosity of our God to give us each moment we have.  Praise God for movies such as this.  Even a child can teach us profoundly.  Suffering is what happens in each of our lives.  We need each other to learn, teach and help us ""bear"" what we are called to live through this side of heaven.",1441152000,,1121,4.162790697674419

This is a confident child's view of the world (even when he has a terminal disease) which influences the attitudes and decisions of the more experienced and jaded adults in his life.  It's based on a true story and I imagine that many, many people could be encouraged by experiencing this movie.  I really enjoyed it.",1429142400,,476,4.698795180722891
4160786,5,B003NKU9AK,"Within this moving 'Family Approved', color, single-disc, DVD, LETTERS TO GOD is the compelling, heart-warming and simultaneous gut-wrenching, true story of 8 year old: Tyler Doherty, a lovable and very brave, little boy who was destroying the diagnosed cancer within himself by his consistent positive attitude. How does he do it... especially, in the face of such devastating, life threatening, internal, adversity? By his simple, child-like faith and trust in the Lord! For Jesus Himself, said: ""...whosoever shall not receive the Kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein"" (Luke 18:17 KJV). And Tyler, who was intelligent beyond his years understood the humble, Old Testament - Proverb within the Holy Bible, which states: ""Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct thy paths. Be not wise in thine own eyes..."" (Proverbs 3:5-7 KJV); ""...that in Me (Jesus) ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world"" (John 16:33 KJV). And how did Tyler handle anxiety and the very real possibly of death by way of such a dreaded disease, such as cancer? He adhered to the do-able and simple premise of: ""...in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus"" (Philippians 4:6-7 KJV). And, he also understood that healing comes in many forms, besides physical. Those being: Spiritual healing, emotional, mental, and so forth. And so, he - on his sick bed, wrote LETTERS TO GOD for himself and on behalf of others. And in so doing, he brought together his family, his friends, a neighborhood, a wayward Mail Carrier and the Post Office. This big-screen, 114-minute, DVD movie, clearly shows that prayer's to the Lord come in many forms, all of which stem from a sincere, child-like, heart of faith. This deeply moving, family-friendly film, should be seen by every Postal Worker and every hospital should have a copy of it. Particularly, in the Children's Cancer Ward. Why? As you will see when you watch it, too provide a sense of hope in a time of crisis and inspiration in a time of shocking despair. Yes, it mentions God. But, instead of the legalistic, modern-day, Pharisees wasting everyone's time especially when a child or a loved one is going through a health crisis, namely: Splitting hairs about the ridiculous and fictitious ideology of the separation of Church and State particularly since the Laws of the Land are predicated on the Ten Commandments which are conveniently located within the Holy Bible (See Exodus 20), or debating, arguing or legalistic filibustering about a healing that took place on the Sabbath (Luke 13:10-17 KJV), they should recognize the message and true life depiction of great faith, hope and courage within this powerful film. For it is encouraging to the disheartened, educational to the unaware, a strength to the weary and a builder of faith and trust to worried and fearful. And, as the Psalmist, wrote: ""Bless the Lord, O my soul: And all that is within me, bless His Holy Name. Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all His benefits: Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; Who healeth all thy diseases; Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; Who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies; Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's"" (Psalm 103:1-5 KJV). Keep in mind, if you would: That regardless of one's chronological age..., in every young, humble and faithful heart, there is the hope of a child. Nina Kish",1429142400,,3741,4.93026941362916

The mailman's dilemma is also well done as he faces his divorce and the possibility of never seeing his son again. It has some really corny dialogue however, that I felt could have been done better. There was one scene where the main character is getting teased at school and his line is Oh I will just do what Jesus did. I love Jesus but felt that this line at that time did not add to the flow of the film. It is a good movie but not a great movie.",1403222400,,780,4.1381578947368425

We are sold the lie that causes us to believe ""How can one little person make a difference in anything?"" TRUTH is that one person CAN make a difference when used by GOD.",1375747200,,346,3.9571428571428573
4161331,5,B003NKU9AK,This is a great family film.  What it teaches about God and having a relationship with Him is presented in a totally wonderful way.  The acting is top notch. It deals with hard issues with truth and beauty.  It left me weeping and movies don't usually do that.  Some may think that a movie that deals with a child with cancer would be too much of a downer but it is actually very life affirming.  I recommend that you take the time to watch the special features that come with the movie.  Watch them with all your family and then talk about the film.,1375660800,,550,4.240384615384615

4161336,5,B003NKU9AK,"Letters to God. The title to this writing says it all. We can't always see what God's plans are and it seems He is always having to show us that we can trust Him no matter what situation or circumstances comes into our lives. God knows our hearts and He knows what we can handle. Sometimes when we are going through the worst time of our lives is when Christ' light shines through the brightest. Tyler Doherty is an eight year old who's childlike faith is strong and courage indomitable when facing brain cancer. Through his experience he actually mentors those around him including his family and new friend the reluctant postman (he doesn't want a walking route). Tyler's influence changes his life as he is having marital problems and isn't allowed to see his own son. As the movie title suggests Tyler's sends his prayers to God via letters which he hands to the mailman. He doesn't know where they are going but in his childlike trusting heart he knows they are going to the right place. I will stop right here as I don't want to give the whole movie away but I will say if you watch the whole thing you will need a box of tissues handy. Inspirational? You bet! And all the more so because it is based on a true story. I keep thinking of the old gospel hymn: ""This little light of mine, I'm going to let it shine"" and Tyler was living proof that you can let your little light shine no matter the circumstances.",1374883200,,1415,4.38403041825095

4161347,5,B003NKU9AK,"Besides being the most touching movie I have ever watched, I was so impressed with the acting. Usually Christian flicks have cheesy actors, but I LOVED the little boy who played in this movie.::: SPOILER ALERT:::  He radiated goodness and you came to care for him so much that when the time came for him to go to his heavenly home, I cried as if he were my own son. I rarely cry that hard at movies. However, what makes this even more heart felt is that it is based on a true story. The actress who played his mother was awesome, as well as Brady the mailman. Very believable, which made it that much more emotional for me. It's a real tear-jerker, so make sure you have lots of tissues. Cancer SUCKS!!!

It will make you hold your kids a little closer, have compassion for those with children in situations that are hard to understand, and appreciate every moment you have with your kids...well, at least that's what this movie did for me.  This movie shows how the faith of a child is a strong force in this life, and encourages me to see the most important things in life.  The salvation of friends and family is priceless and this movie shows that.  The way that a community comes together in hard situations is also an important factor in life. I saw this in my own life when my 3 year old nephew was dealing with cancer...which is healed from now...all praise to Jesus.  The reality, though, is that many families face situations like the family in this movie and we can learn from the way they handled the difficulties.",1366848000,,852,4.542483660130719

4161397,5,B003NKU9AK,"A friend in a Bible study recommended this movie to me, and I am glad I bought it.  This emotional and inspirational story reinforces the importance of relationships:  the horizontal ones we have with family and friends and the vertical one with God.  This is a great family movie.  My only criticism is that I would have liked a bit more information on what happened to some of the key characters after the death of the protagonist.",1363824000,,433,4.584415584415584

I've seen him answer my prayers many times, and not always the way I want them to be, but the results are always much better than I could have imagined. I loved the way the little boy responded to his illness, and how others responded to his undefeatable attitudes. It was hard when he passed but he left a lot of changed lives and happiness behind him. My Father died from cancer when I was in my twenties so my mind and heart respond to the feelings of of the family memebers and friends. This is a wonderful movie I would suggest for families or anyone. And may God grant every one that watches it his blessings.",1363737600,,706,4.198529411764706

4161404,5,B003NKU9AK,"I am the mother of an 11 year old son who often gets bogged down in the stresses of school, homework, and the frustrations of a young life.  I got this movie to help him see beyond himself and to help him recognize the blessings in his life.  What a beautiful work of art this movie has been for accomplishing just that purpose.  This life is temporary and the way we choose to live our lives, no matter what is taking place, can either point people toward God or away from God.  I pray that all who see this movie will choose to be a warrior, as the young, main character and child with cancer has done in this movie, pointing people toward the Lord.  What a beautiful story of bravery and strength, strength that can only come from our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.  Highly recommend for the entire family.

I've spent 8 months in the chemo ward along with a toddler as my best chemo buddy.  Thank God we are both fine today; it is not like that for everyone.  But everyone can get a taste of the hope there is in God, along with the arguments with Him we all make when we suffer.  Tyler, the main character, acts as a true role model of faith for all of us who believe and for those who have doubts and need reassurance that there IS a God to believe in even throughout our pain.

His mom loved him dearly and stood by him until he died.  I could watch this movie over and over again.  If it was the end of the World and I could only watch one movie before I died, I would watch ""Letters To God.""

I rented this film to watch with my kids because I thought it would represent a good life lesson about what it would be like to be a child with a serious illness. I was a bit worried that the film would be overly religious, but based on a review I read at Amazon which said that it was a good movie even if you were not religious, I rented it anyway. Suffice it to say, I disagree strongly with that review. The acting isn't bad. The production qualities are okay.

I didn't read the description well and I thought it was something else when I put it on, but I got caught up in it anyway.  So now that I know this is a kids movie, I gotta say, it was excellent.  I'm kinda surprised this type of movie could be made in Hollywood.  While it is Christian themed, I think even nonbelievers or people like me that are not regular church goers, will be inspired by the main character, Tyler.  I did not think that it was forcing religion.  The Story is about Tyler and his impact on those around him.  What I really liked was that there was no one praying for a miracle.  Not once did any one ask ""please find a cure for Tyler.""  It wasn't treating God like a magic genie granting wishes, the prayers were more spiritual.  This is far more realistic and easier for kids to relate to.  My Favorite part of the movie was when we got to hear what was in some of Tyler's letters to God.  It really developed the Character, and had a great message, because even at his worst times when he struggled the most, he always was thinking about other people.  Throughout the whole movie, he was always concerned with others, and I think that is great message also.  There were a couple great performances too, by the young actors that played Tyler and Sam.  The were so positive and happy.  I don't think the stopped smiling at all in the whole movie.  They were great, did a great job delivering lines, had great chemistry, and really it is those 2 that gave the movie a positive feel.  I read some of the negative reviews and those comments were kinda harsh.  I think that is way off base.  They were absolutely fantastic.  So, it cant all be positive though, there is room for improvement.  I thought some of the supporting adult actors could have stepped up their performances, especially Tyler's brother Ben.  He was terrible.  I know it was a kids movie, but still would have like to see a little more emotion put into some of the performances.  A little more character development for the Mailman and Mom would be nice too.  Finally, the writing and flow of the movie was a little jumpy.  Some of the scenes seemed to be important but ended prematurely.  It seemed to have some scenes in the middle that were not well connected or were out of order.  I also would have like to have some scenes where Tyler was visibly sicker, to show that his positive attitude never changed.  Overall fanatastic story, with realistic scenario, and very uplifting.",1325894400,,2532,4.441304347826087

4161496,3,B003NKU9AK,"***Spoilers ahead***

To be honest, I was biased against this movie, since Christian movies have a penchant for simplistic plots and for overselling their messages. I decided to give it a try anyway and I was impressed.

The production values are solid and the acting, especially by Tyler, his mother, and the mailman, are believable to me. Tyler's best friend overacts to some degree but she was still fun to watch. By the end, I could feel the effect of Tyler's loss on his loved ones and cried along with them.

My favorite storyline was that of the mailman. He was flawed, but also a good man who wanted change and who found what he needed. The struggles of an alcoholic who lost his family and his reputation hit home with me. I would have loved to have seen a movie that focused on him. With regard to production values and storytelling, the flashbacks to the drinking and the arrest were some of the best scenes. A cardinal virtue of storytelling is ""Show, don't tell"" and these flashbacks allow us to see what McDaniels is thinking and feeling without having it totally spelled out for us.

The story: Not bad. Sure, it can be hokey at times, but it has a realism to it that ""Facing the Giants"" could never hope to achieve. Prayer does not give you everything you want in this life. The real rewards come after, and that is what Tyler's life, and death, teach the audience. Real sadness and real anger are all shown here in spectacular fashion by Ty's mom and his brother. Ty is not a saint, but a regular kid who likes to play games and be a trickster.

So that's the good news.

The bad news is that there is still a propensity to oversell the message, and that's unfortunate to me. God's word is powerful enough to speak for itself, and Christian artists should have more faith in their stories. Quotes like ""I'll do what Jesus would do"" and telling the bully to ""open his heart to Jesus"" are heavy-handed storytelling, even if some people do talk like that. Illness is a major test of faith for most people, but Tyler didn't seem to notice. He never stopped believing or even questioned whether this hope he had for something unseen was worth it. The Catholic saints themselves struggled with sinfulness and disbelief, as did Jesus's disciples, so it's not like being honest about it would have been a stain on Tyler's character. Like the mailman, having these questions, falling in and out of faith, and coming BACK to the faith in the end are genuine indicators of a strong faith. It's not about falling. It's about getting back up.

Like most evangelical Christian movies, there is the obligatory scene where all the people who have been evangelized publicly open their heart to Jesus in just so many words. Subtlety, please! You do not need to be Christian to gain comfort and instruction from Jesus (salvation factor aside) and Christians don't necessarily have faith strike them like a bolt of lightening the way the movie makes it appear. Again, McDaniels was great in this regard. He spoke to Tyler, went to church a few times, and really pondered the journey he was on. The girl and the bully both just sort of went BAM! PRAISE THE LORD!

It actually deserves 3 1/2 stars, but Amazon only allows whole number ratings. Give it a shot. You should know what you are getting into, which is a Christian message movie, but seriously, give it a shot. You might be surprised.",1303603200,6,3388,4.579207920792079

The message is good, the boy is a real role-model and the ending really moving. But compared to Fireproof, the acting in this movie is rather poor. It's smile or cry, some common phrases and the characters are mostly stereotypes. The drunk divorced-messy-life guy, the good'old'granny, the wild neighbor's-kid and of course a soft pastor.
I don't want to be too judgmental but the storyline is really predictable. Actually at some points I was kind of bored because the movie did not really evolve that much. The movie takes two hours, but they definitely could have done it in 90min.

Don't get me wrong, the message and the morals of this movie are brilliant.

4161514,5,B003NKU9AK,"Before you sit down to watch ""Letters to God,"" I strongly suggest grabbing a whole box of tissue to bring with you. By the end of this movie, you are definitely going to need it.

Tyler Doherty is an 8 year old who is battling cancer. His way of praying is to write letters to God. He has one for the mail carrier almost very day. Brady, a man whose life has fallen apart and who seeks solace in alcohol, is a new mail carrier who takes over the route. On his first day, Tyler pukes on his shoes. Nevertheless, he and Tyler soon become friends. He still isn't sure what to do with all of his letters to God, however. In time, both his friendship with Tyler and his family, and the letters himself will change his life.

The idea of writing letters to God takes off and by the end of the movie, many people have joined Tyler in praying in this matter. This movie just may inspire you to write one or more of your own to God.

This is truly an amazing, heartbreaking story about faith and trusting in God even when all seems hopeless. It is rated PG and is appropriate for ages 7 and up (due to subject matter). As an added plus, Ralph Waite (the father from ""The Waltons"") does a remarkable job as the grandfather of Tyler's best friend Sam.",1290556800,,1240,4.201680672268908

My girlfriend (who is spiritual and somewhat religious) and I (an agnostic) rented this film because it was on sale but couldn't get through the whole thing. There is a group of (probably mostly church-going) people who will like -or love-  this movie (as indicated by all the positive reviews here), but we found it preachy, pious, proselytizing, and all too predictable.",1289347200,8,410,4.927536231884058
4161519,2,B003NKU9AK,"With all the stellar reviews here, I was expecting an exceptional film, but we got no such thing.  This movie plays like a weak TV movie, with a script that's horribly predictable and acting that sometimes approaches decent.  The direction is simply all over the place--sometimes it seems to be getting serious, only to immediately fall into slapstick silliness.  All of the typical cliches of this genre of film are here, rolled out one after another until you stop expecting any originality at all.  Also, all of the stereotypical characters are present in full force--the down-and-out drunk, the cheerful sick kid, the sassy-but-cute neighbor/best friend, the rebellious teen son, the ""caring"" employer vs. the man who wants the drunk fired--and they definitely add to the predictability.  (And tell me how anyone who misses four of his first twelve days at his post office job and shows up hung over two hours late a day after he missed work isn't going to be fired!  Holes in the plot don't help!)  It was extremely difficult to watch.

I do like the idea that people can be shown praying together in a movie.  I like the idea that faith can be shown in a film without apology.  I like seeing people acknowledge their beliefs and try to live up to them, and seeing people treat each other nicely.  I also like a film that doesn't feel a need to fill its time with swearing and/or sex and violence.  But so many other films treat this topic better--this wouldn't be bad to watch at a time when you really don't have anything else to do, but keep your expectations low.  This is NOT a five-star film.",1289088000,5,1603,4.641843971631205

Don't expect to be untugged in the emotion department because there are definite heart string pulling moments. But not so sad that you will go through a box of tissues unless you are struggling with huge emotional stuff.

I think this would be a terrific movie to watch with a kid who might be going through a situation with a friend or relative with a serious illness. Dying is a part of life and this film handles death with sensitivity and dignity.",1288915200,12,670,4.87719298245614

4161525,4,B003NKU9AK,"This movie is wonderfully simple and sincere in presenting its message. The story is based on the life of Patrick ""Tyler"" Doherty. It presents the question ""Why God?"" Here is an upright church-going family, where firstly the father and main bread winner dies unexpectedly, and then the younger of two brothers is diagnosed with a rare breed of brain cancer, that is quite aggressive.

Most Christians believe in divine healing, but what is the response supposed to be when a much needed healing does not take place in the life of a young innocent boy? This is the scenario that is presented. Each member of the family suffers from the pressure of this situation and Tyler's grandmother steps in as a source of help and encouragement.

Tyler keeps his faith and starts writing his letters to God in order to keep his perspective of things and those around him. In an apparent answer to one of these letters, a new postman shows up and befriends the family. He has his own family challenges, but Tyler's resolve and determination motivates him not up give up on trying to solve his own personal problems.

This film is very moving emotionally, it will make most people cry and will keep you hoping and believing. The message rings true to the end, hold on to Jesus no matter the outcome.",1288224000,,1285,4.676991150442478

4161530,3,B003NKU9AK,"I must admit that I went into this film a bit of a skeptic. The storyline just seemed a little too ""Hallmark Channel"" for me.
The movie begins with 8 year old Tyler Doherty, who is suffering from brain cancer and writing letters to God that he leaves for the postman every day. His mother is returning to work as a nurse and life is trying to continue after Tyler has undergone painful radiation treatments.

We are also introduced to the postal workers of the area (which area we never know). There is Walter the over achieving veteran postal worker who doesn't feel right taking time off; Lester the kind and gracious boss; Carl, the over eager middle manger and Brady, the slacker Iraq ex-service man who is an alcoholic. In a not so shocking twist of fate, Brady gets assigned Walter's walking route which includes Tyler's home.

Tyler eventually is well enough to go back to school. His best friend Sam (Samantha not Samuel), is his protector and confidant. On his first day back a bully is particularly mean to him and Sam proceeds to smash the trouble maker's face in his lunch. The three wind up in the principal's office.

Brady continues to drink. He  doesn't know what to do with the letters to God that Tyler continues to write. He decides to take them to a church where the pastor tells him that he doesn't believe that they came into Brady's possession by chance. The pastor prays with him. Brady keeps the letters, unopened. Through collecting the letters Brady becomes a close friend to the family and his drinking stops.

The movie continues with more exposition explaining how Tyler's cancer affects the entire neighborhood. Tyler becomes the light of many people's world and he points several characters to a relationship with Christ. The movie takes a deeply emotional turn in its falling action. It concludes by letting us know that the story is based on true events and showing us several cancer survivors that we assume had something to do with the film's production.

I will say that this, in similar fashion to the much superior film To Save A Life released earlier this year, has upped the quality expectations for Christian movies. However, To Save A Life captured real, gritty, life and made little apologies for its realism. Letters to God does play as I feared, much like a TV movie. It is a quality TV movie but nonetheless not what you expect when you attend a theater to see a film. It's scope is small and not quite full enough for a large theater venue.

The acting is far superior to many films of this genre. Jeffery Johnson does a fine job portraying the troubled Brady who is a complex character driven by his past mistakes with his own family and the uneasy pull to become a part of this new one. He is understated in his subtext. His feelings seem real and his character is one of the best written in the film. We see his hurt and regret and can believe that it is true as he battles his past and its demons.

Robyn Lively is not as strong but turns an adequate performance as the struggling mother of a child with cancer. In her most emotional scene, one of the few in the movie that actually rings true to the doubts and grief of struggling with a terminal illness, Lively is a bit over the top and flirts with overacting. She does reign it in just as she brushes over doing the scene and making it unbelievable. You do trust her performance when it comes to the scenes where she shows love and emotion toward her sick son.

There is a surprise appearance of Ralph Waite (of The Walton's and more recently the Kevin Costner/Whitney Houston film The Bodyguard) as Sam's grandfather. He is a fine actor but the role was written in such a way that it seems a waste that someone with Waite's pedigree would play the part.

You get the sense that Tanner Maguire, who plays Tyler, is trying a bit too hard. Although, the script he has to work with makes believability hard to grasp. Tyler is written in such a way that Mcguire never really has the freedom to delve into the fears and hurts of someone struggling with cancer. He also is a bit too old to be believable as an eight year old. He often has a glossy look that I am not sure is meant to be Tyler's wandering thoughts to Heaven or Maguire's confusion on how to play a child who seems to not struggle much with the fact that he is terminally ill.

Bailee Madison is cute on 110 on a 10 point scale, playing the role of the best friend Sam. The director often uses her to make the crowd say ""awww"" and forget that cancer is messy. She is a fine young actress and I will admit that her final scenes and voice overs came the closest to manufacturing genuine emotion from me.

Actually the most restrained and believable performance was turned in by Michael Bolten (not the singer) who plays Tyler's older brother, Ben. We can  believe that he cares for his brother and sense his genuine pain at losing first his father (in a ""sudden"" way that is never disclosed) and now the threat of losing his only brother as well. Bolten never seems to overdo his emotions and the writers stay away from the emotionally manipulative tone that haunts other characters in the scripting of Ben. Bolten also demonstrates a quality musical talent in a scene late in the film.

The Gospel is very plain in this movie. Those who felt that To Save A Life lacked the over the top salvation message should be amply pleased by it's presentation in Letters to God. Although I thought the restraint shown in To Save A Life was necessary for the tone of that film, I am happy that the filmmakers of Letters To God did not shy away from the road to true peace. We see lives changed by the work of Jesus and His name is credited many times.

The movie is worth your time. Perhaps it would be best viewed in your home on a more intimate format than the big screen. It is always pleasant to go to a movie and be entertained and not have to feel like you have somehow compromised your values by watching it. Letters to God will help get us further down the road to consistent quality Christian film making. If we continue to put quality first, we can only expect for movies with a faith message to get better. I do believe that God can (and will) use this film to further His Kingdom and in the end, I know that is what matters most.",1286496000,4,6293,4.431660899653979
4161531,1,B003NKU9AK,"I don't mind movies with religious themes usually, as long as they aren't overly didactic.  This one is.

What is really the point of that? It is only eating you up. Just let it go and stop dwelling in past. When I have God's love, wisdom and strengten, it show me it ain't stoppin' there or there. It is keeping growing and growing. So be example in the walking of Jesus by keeping giving love to a person. No matter what they did or who they. That what he does in the movie. Yea, that why the enemy of his is angry and making funny of him. He just mad 'cuz he thought he should be weak as a cancer victim. But with God's love that he keeps giving, he gains the strength. Boy wanna a power , he thought he can steal that by making funny of him. He is humble enough to smiling and writing a letter ""Okay, I forgive you"" Boy says what are you doing? LOL...
