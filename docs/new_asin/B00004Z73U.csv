1383504,5,B00004Z73U,"My boyfriend let me borrow this video, and I must say that I have not given it back. I love the Quick Fix Girls (Minna, Julie, and Nancy). They are pleasant, and not dry or overly excited (Denise Austin). I also love their shapes which are motivating: not too skinny with nice muscle tones. They give you good short instructions on how to do the movements properly and tell you what body part you are working on. The video is divided into 3 segments (legs&arms, legs, arms) so you can choose to do one, two or all 3 segments in a row. Believe me, I have not been able to do all 3 in a row yet, and I've been using the video for months. I look forward to this workout every week as it gives a nice burn and a good sweat (and that's in one segment). I love alternating it with my cardio and ab video (also by Quick Fix).",1040860800,2,818,4.055555555555555
1383505,5,B00004Z73U,"This is a great, fast workout.  I really worked up a sweat, and felt the burn the next day.  I would definitely buy other tapes in the Quick Fix series.",1030579200,2,152,4.033333333333333
1383506,5,B00004Z73U,"I bought this video because I was looking for a shorter workout for when time is a little tight.  I wasn't sure what to expect in ten minutes, but I absolutely love it!  I usually just do one segment a night, combined with other videos, and I feel each workout.  The other night I did all three, and boy did I feel it! For the next few days!  I love Minna, and I'm planning to get more of her videos.  I like the Quick Fix format so much I also bought the buns and abs videos and plan to get the yoga one, too. If you're short on time or like to do a few videos in a night like I do, I would definitely recommend this video.",1019433600,7,624,3.84375
1383507,5,B00004Z73U,"I found this to be a great workout tape not only for your arms and legs, but your entire body.  The steps are easy to follow and you feel great after using this tape.  You really feel as though you have had a total workout for your spirit, mind and body.  This tape is a great way for to reduce stress and anxiety.  Since I have been using this tape I have noticed that my arms and legs are shaplier with more definition, not to mention I have lost a few pounds.",1014163200,5,462,3.989130434782609
1383508,5,B00004Z73U,"Don't be fooled by the title -- this workout really makes you feel it all over.  I purchased this tape after buying the Quick Fix Total Body Workout.  I really liked the segment Minna (she is the instructor for this entire tape) did the best so I decided to find some more tapes by her.  And I am glad I found this tape.  There are three segments - the first is a mix of arm and leg work; the second focuses on just legs; and the third is just arms.  I barely made it through all three!  What is good is that you can break the segments up and do them seperately to focus on the areas where you most need help or do them all together for a total strength training workout.  The instruction is clear and the moves are simple yet they really work!  I used three pounds weights for the arm segments but I would suggest starting out lighter if you are new to strength traning.  These are good, basic exercises that are really effective.",982454400,39,931,4.185393258426966

7928333,5,B00004Z73U,"I love the Quick Fix workouts as they are broken down into 3 ten-minute sessions that enable me to fit in the time I have. I usually do all three as the time passes quickly.  I find the workouts to be the perfect way to keep toned in-between other more strenuous and lengthy workouts (which I only do once or twice a week).  These are not body- changers, but serve the purpose of maintenance.",1382313600,,392,4.283783783783784
7928334,5,B00004Z73U,"For only 10 minutes each, it's such a tough and effective workout!  No kidding it's part of the Quick Fix series because you get results very quickly!  this one's great!",1187395200,,169,4.6
7928335,5,B00004Z73U,All of the videos in the Quick Fix series are excellent. The work outs are broken into three parts of ten minutes each. All that one needs is tennis shoes and some weights and a good attitude toward getting fit. The instructors give clear and easily demonstrated excercises. I will use this video on hectic days. I usually use 5 lb weights. It is both challenging for the begginer and someone who is in good shape.,1123113600,,414,4.4605263157894735
7928336,5,B00004Z73U,"Okay, so being a Minna Lessing-fan I might be positively prejudiced, but this tape just goes to prove she's a real pro.

Don't expect anything outstandingly new from this tape, she just combines good ol' squats and plies in the standing leg-work and different types of lifts with handweights in the arms part of the workout. What makes it great is that even though it's a slow-paced, low impact, pretty ""laid back"" workout (just what I like instead of jumping around), it still makes me sweat. If you're not just starting out, my advice to you is to try and complete all three of the workouts and you'll definitely feel like you've done some serious work.",1112227200,,655,4.646551724137931
7928337,5,B00004Z73U,"I love it.  First segment is arms & legs: triceps, squats, lunges, arm curls.  Second is mostly lower body:  squats, lunges, plies, leg lifts.  Third is all arms:  delts, triceps, biceps.  Enough reps for each exercise.  Use heavier weights if you're intermediate or advanced.  All standing work, no floor work.  Minna Lessig is superb, professional, and motivating.  I can't say enough about this video so I'll just stop here.  Happy Toning!",1065398400,2,442,5.084507042253521
7928338,4,B00004Z73U,"Love my quick fix pilates tape. My sister bought the denise Austin weights, but she screams so much . We use her tape with he sound off. This tape is much calmer, the first section works arms and legs with weights. After one week I moved up 3lbs on my weights, my sister is up to 8 lb weights. This tape accomplishes a lot with out killing or annoying you to death.  Will keep buying quick fix tapes, I get a lot of enjoyment and body change.",1051488000,,442,4.080459770114943
7928339,5,B00004Z73U,"Like all of the tapes in the Quick Fix series, this video consists of three 10-minute workouts that can be done separately or together.  Minna Lessing takes the lead on this tape, with Julie Upton and Nancy Popp in the background.  Although short, each workout is fairly intense, but you can stay motivated by watching the countdown clock in the lower right corner.
The first workout targets both legs and arms.  After a very brief warmup, Minna leads you through a mix of traditional toning exercises such as bicep curls, squats, and lunges; there's also several sets of french presses for the triceps.  Many of the exercises consist of leg/arm combinations, and some are pretty tough.  The cool-down consists of only one arm stretch.  The second workout focuses solely on legs, mostly via squats and lunges.  It also contains some leg extensions, both to the side and to the front, and two brief stretches at the end.  Finally, workout three is for the arms.  Biceps are targeted through single, double, and hammer curls, and tricep exercises include the french press and extensions.  Several exercises for shoulders are also included; these are done at a slower 2-count as opposed to the tempo pace of the other exercises.  Like the first program, a single stretch is offered for cool-down.
Not a lot of instruction is given by Minna, but she and the others are friendly and motivating without being overly peppy.  The Quick Fix series is great for those who are time-crunched, and this tape is no exception.  For full-body strength training, trying doing all three programs on this tape combined with one of the Quick Fix Tight Abs workouts, and you'll have a great 40-minute workout that just flies by.",1041292800,12,1707,4.865051903114187
