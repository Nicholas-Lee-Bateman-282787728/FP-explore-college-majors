Sasha Mitchell and I like it the way he play in this movie. Vincent Klyn (Lucifer) was great,he is my favorite bad guy from the movie. The movie is about a plague who dominate the planet and the cure that everyone wants it. At first the Cure from the plague

is taken by Vincent Klyn and his gang,but in the end The guy who saved Sasha from the prison(the good guy)take the cure and take the doctor in Phoenix. I was a little angry because Sasha was shut in the head at the middle of the movie. Unless that it was great. Watch this movie. Is really a Great Action Movie.",1140566400,,638,3.9765625
1663505,5,B00005U8Q2,"In recent years the best place to find good action movies were not the theater as some might make you believe, but the direct to video market.  It is there that action stars Jean Claude Van Damm and Steven Segal have remained and continued to develop their fan base.  While this film features neither one of those, it is an example of a campy action film that is entertaining in just how cliched and bad it is.

The story here is that the nuclear holocaust has occured and a deadly virus has emerged (most likely caused by the nukes).  Civilization (at least in America) has crumbled and gangs are slowly taking over.  Mankind is doing what it can to survive, yet gathering up the gangs of the country is an evil dictator known as Lucifer.  He kidnaps the scientist who is developing the cure and ruthlessly executes those who stands in his way.  Three heros band together to stop this menace and bring peace to a damned world.

The story is cliched and the acting is non exsistant.  So what makes this movie so appealing is that it kept me entertained the entire way through.  Call it a cheap thrill but this is a campy, guilty pleasure flick that is a must see.  As bad as it is I enjoyed it all the way through and it is mercifully only 90 minutes.  This is an example of a DTV movie done right, while understanding it's target audience.  Some may hate it, I personally enjoyed it.",1109376000,5,1384,4.3803921568627455
1663506,1,B00005U8Q2,"Dig a hole in your yard. Throw 9.99 into the hole. Fill the hole back in. Go read a book. This is a far better way to spend your time and money. Better yet, give the 10 bucks to a homeless person. Then go read a book. Hell, read the back of the shampoo bottle for 94 minutes. Do not waste your time on this one. It makes anything by Ed Wood look like Citizen Kane. I gave it one star only because Amazon won't let me give it zero.",1106611200,4,430,3.7888888888888888
1663507,3,B00005U8Q2,"I give it 3 stars because of the amount of times it made us laugh out loud.  This is some of the worst direction, production and writing in the history of, well, history.  I've seen soft-core porn with a better storyline.

Best thing about this movie?  It's billed as having Ice T and Coolio as the stars...they're both dead within the first 3 minutes of the film.  I'm sorry....did I just call this failure a film?  I meant movie.

Don't watch this alone.  It'll make you feel icky.  It's meant for a rainy saturday afternoon, with a good friend and a good bottle.

I have to get back to this disaster now...beware...this movie is the reason that other cultures hate us.",1100304000,3,671,4.471074380165289
1663508,5,B00005U8Q2,"There is a strand of movies that few are aware exsist.  Most of the time people pass them up for something more major, with more flair, with more recognizable actors.  Gangland is in the realm of direct to video action movies that only appeal to a certain crowd.  I will tell you this right now I have not had this much fun with an action film in a long time.  The action in this is non stop, it has kind of an 80's Mad Max feel to it, but with a martial arts.
Gangland story takes place after World War 3 or the Nuclear War.  Many people are dead and those that are not are plauged with a deadly flesh eating virus.  To make matters worse gangs from across the nation have united under a leader Lucifer and are slowly conquering the United states.  These gangs terrorize people, are killing off the law enforcement, civilians, and doing whatever they please.  At this point we see three heroes unite in an attempt to stop these evil gangs each with their own motivation, all of them a loss of a loved one.  The action is relentless as every one in this movie knows some form of martial arts, combined with plenty of explosions and gun fights you have one hell of a movie here.
This movie also has an incredible cast.  The main lure for any one who looks is the fact that Ice T and Coolio are in it.  However they are only there for the first few minutes, as cops,  before the gangs get them (what bitter irony).  The real stars are as following.
1:Sasha Mitchel (TV's Step-by-Step, Kickboxer 2-4, Class of 1999 part 2 the Substitute) who plays Derek who loses hs brother in the fight with the gangs, more specifically Lucifer.  Sasha brings to the movie a kind of Dumb Jock appeal that lightens the dark mood and adds camp appeal.
2: Costas Mandyler (Pledge, Double Take) as Jared who lost his family to the gangs, moe specifically Lucifers second in command Damien.  Costas brings the driven for revenge like aura but at the same time cool and knows what he is doing.
3: Kathleen Kimmount (The Things you Do, Bride of Re-Animator) plays Alexis who carries a sample of the virus she extracted from her sister before she was murderd by the gangs.  She brings the tough as nails yet caring character to the group.
4: Tim Thomerson (Trancers series, DOllman, Near Dark, Air America) plays Dr. Adams the man who discoverd the cure for the virus.  He is then captured and forced the develop the cure for th gangs.  He brings the troubled Dr. who is forced to against his will to do this for the sake of his family.
5: Vincent Klyn (Urban Menace, TV's Baywatch, Cyborg) plays Lucifer, the evil leader of the gangs.  He brings to the movie an incredible over the top villian that is so ridiculous and cheesey that you have to love him.  Bascally he almost reminds me of some ways of Jeremy Irons from Dungeons and Dragons, so over the top that it's ridiculouse.
6: David Defalco wrote, produced and Stars as Damien the second in command to Lucifer.  He is more seriouse and not as over the top, but damn can this guy take a beating as you shall see while watching this movie.
Overall this mindless action flick is highly recomended for anyone.  The camp factor is incredible, the action is relentless, and overall this is highly recommended.  A guily pleasure movie you might say.",1050105600,5,3274,4.438127090301004

It has a recommended cast and brings into focus a lot of points that could arise if Marshall Law was put into effect on major cities. Costas Mandylor (Picket Fences, the Saw franchise), Sasha Mitchell (the Kickboxer series, Step-By-Step), Kathleen Kinmont (Renegage, Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers) and Kristanna Loken (Terminator: Rise of the Machines, Bloodrayne) star.",1398038400,,426,5.188405797101449
7954239,1,B00005U8Q2,"A cheap straight to video movie that is sure not worth what it's selling for. Very much a movie for those not interested in the storyline & just wanting to watch Ice-T, I really am lost for words on this one :)",1359072000,,210,4.023809523809524
7954240,3,B00005U8Q2,"I bought this movie for the simple fact that Sasha Mitchell is in it. Ice-T and Coolio are on the cover and both die by the first 5 minutes. I swear I saw Sam Brown(Flash Gordon)in the beginning. That is showing my age. Anyway Ice-T was over the top and in retrospective it was way funny. I don't know if it was meant to be, but it was a groaner. Sasha Mitchell shows up about 10 minutes into the movie. Him and his brother are tooling along and suddenly they are being followed by bad guys. You just know that a fight is going to happen. I am a sucker for martial arts fight scenes. Even if the movie is total crap the fight scenes are worth watching. Well my oh my the guy playing Sasha's brother can kick some major ass. I don't know who he is, but he could hold his own. Sasha himself has some very formidable skills and this is the biggest I have ever seen him. He is amazingly agile for being that pumped up. His crescent kicks and jump spin side kicks are not what I would want to be on the receiving end of, let alone his dangerous elbows. Those hurt when you get nailed with the pointy end. I really like Sasha Mitchell's acting and his laugh. He plays it pretty low key . Some of the other actors are just so over the top you have to laugh. The guy playing Lucifer is a prime example. It almost borders on hilarious. The dude playing the steroid pumped growling beast was who I was hoping that, in the end, would match up against Sasha. No, he makes it 3/4's of the way through only to get shot in the back of the head. Major bummer, and I instantly lost interest in the movie, because the 2 people left I can do without. Kathleen Kinmont might have learned martial arts when she was married to Lorenzo Lamas but she can't fight and the other guy from Picket Fences acted like he was in a coma. I love Tim Thomerson from the Dollman movies and he is seriously funny in stand-up so he does a pretty good job. All in all I had to remember that it is a DTV movie and go from there. If you like either martial arts fights or are a Sasha Mitchell fan get it. Like another reviewer said thankfully it is only 90 minutes. I probably should have stuck it out, but after Sasha dies so did my reason for watching. It is one of those movies you watch when you have nothing else to do.",1351987200,,2283,4.098214285714286
