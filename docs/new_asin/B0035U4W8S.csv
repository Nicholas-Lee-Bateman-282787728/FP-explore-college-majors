8602935,1,B0035U4W8S,"I bought recently on Amazon two Surround Records blu-rays and I'm sooo disappointed!

The first hints were given right after opening the boxes, everything looks so unprofessional:
the covers look like printed with a cheap ink-jet printer, the same for the disc labels. One
of the discs has scratches on it right out of the box. Everything looks like home-made using
a blu-ray burner.

But the real issues started when listening, probably due to poor authoring of the discs or to
poor quality of mastering equipment... or to poor quality of workmanship.

One of the discs, ""E - Music Experience in 3-Dimensional Sound Reality"" stops playing during
the last track, 5 minutes before the end. The discs freezes there. Fast forwarding a few
seconds and playing again does not help: from there on to the end of the disc there's no sound.

The other disc ""Spatial Dynamics - Music Experience in 3-Dimensional Sound Reality"" has the
first track unplayable: a few minutes into the song awful noises superposed on the music,
making you jump for the remote to stop the play. Then, for the rest of the disc, there are various
pops and loss of sound all over the place, making the ""Experience"" unlistenable.

Overall, a complete waste of money on these discs... and they didn't came out cheap!
