1110675,5,6306004440,"This is a very good movie. A must have for collection. It shows so much about Jamaican life in the inner city.
Only wished it was encoded for DTS.",986342400,,146,4.068965517241379
1110676,4,6306004440,"if you love dancehall this movie has a bit of a surprise for you. ninjaman, elephantman, nitty kutchie, boom dandemite, harry toddler, and cutty ranks all have roles in this movie; which is a cop versus gun dealer type flick. the dvd is full screen and shot in cheap video format, but it still shines despite these flaws. the soundtrack is very good despite containing no tracks from the aforementioned artists. i wonder if this is what ninjaman has been doing lately, because he does have quite a substantial role in this flick, and doesn't do bad at all at the acting thing....",983923200,3,579,4.631067961165049
1110677,5,6306004440,"Chris Browne's film had my attention right away.  Not only is it a great story in the tradition of John Woo, Brothers on the opsite sides of the law but has the same grim ending of all great Woo Films.  THe DanceHall Sound Track really keeps the film pumping.  The use of video in this film really makes me believe that films can be shot on video and have the same impact as somthing shot on 35mm.  This film is really worth your time.  Chris Browne Rules as a director and I hope he gets another film here in the states",978220800,2,520,4.108910891089109
1110678,1,6306004440,"This movie was a waste of celluloid and my time!!  The actors need shooling, and the cop needs lessons in walking in heels if he's gonna portray a prostitute.  Who did the makeup here, Marilyn Manson?  The drug shoot-outs practically had me rollin' in the aisles, and if you look closely you see bullet explosions from the victim's chests!  A third world blaxploitation masterpiece!!  Buy the CD and light-up a blunt instead!",977270400,,425,4.847222222222222
1110679,3,6306004440,"A Jamaican ""Dirty Harry"" is the quickest way to sum up this movie, and that is a complement.
Paul Campbell plays Capone, a tough cop  who has just been transferred to Kingston to help get a handle on the crime  scene there. His first assignment has him going back to his hometown on the  trail of some stolen guns. As fate would have it he runs into his buddies  from childhood including his best friend, Ratty. Unfortunately Ratty turns  out to be the right hand man for the local crime boss.
The picture  quality of this DVD is excellent as it was shot using digital cameras which  makes the transition to DVD a perfect match. I wish it had been shot as a  widescreen feature instead of full-frame, but I can certainly understand  them not making that decision.
BTW, during the scene where Capone is  using a laptop computer, be sure to notice the names of the folders on the  desktop! - moviesforguys.com",967593600,2,907,4.5030674846625764
1110680,5,6306004440,"Massive, this movie totally eclipsed ""Harder They Come"" one of Jamaica's finest.  This action packed film highlights the struggle of a  Jamaican cop who has to returned to his former stompping only to discover  his brethren from his youth is on the wrong side of the law.  A gripping  tale of blood, guts, and a traditional yard style humour, seen.",967420800,2,348,4.733333333333333
1110681,2,6306004440,"If you've ever wondered what it takes to succeed as a cop in a Third World country like Jamaica, writer/director Chris Browne has a simple answer for  you -- be as ruthless as the criminals.  But despite the charisma of lead  actor Paul Campbell (""Dancehall Queen""), it's hard to root for a  lawman with an itchier trigger finger than all the bad guys in the film  combined.  Consequently, his childhood friend, Ratty (Mark Danvers), a  dancehall promoter by day/gunrunner by night comes across as the better man  simply because he's that much less violent.  Of course, it's possible that  we're meant to see Ratty's importing and distribution of weaponry as the  *means* by which gunfire continues to fill the air of Kingston Town as  loudly and as insistently as dancehall.  But never fear!  Campbell's  Capone, like De Niro before him, proceeds to ""wipe the scum off the  streets"" until there's no scum left to wipe.  And that may very well  make him a successful cop...but at what cost?  That will have to wait for  another movie.  Nonetheless, fans of Carribean culture will probably want  to check out what has become the most successful Jamaican film of all time  (despite camera work that often makes it looks like a home movie).  Music  by Sly and Robbie and featuring an appearance by veteran actor, Carl  Bradshaw (""The Harder They Come"") as Ratty's boss, The Don.",965779200,12,1375,4.793991416309013

1110762,3,6306004440,"Third World cop seeks to extend the legacy of the 1970's cult classic ""The Harder They Come"".  Fast forward to the late 1990's Kingston and the bad guys and heroes may look the same but the game remains the same.  We're still looking to get over and this film certainly tries.",1357948800,,276,4.392156862745098

1110764,4,6306004440,The DVD was excellent and sound was but the box was alitle bit damaged but it didn't damage the DVD. Just a shame really as I bought that for someone for Christmas. Apart from that I am really happy with your service.,1327190400,,217,4.190476190476191
1110765,4,6306004440,not beleiveable plot.stars from dance hall queen were bad guys in one movie than they become good guys in third world cop.,1311638400,,122,4.590909090909091
1110766,5,6306004440,"I like this movie. I watch it over and over and over. The plot is kind of the same as a ""Dirty Harry"" type black police detective. But here is were the problem Ly,the protagonist and antagonist were buddies in the past. The detective capone took the hoodlum ratty under his ""wings"" in the past after ratty's brother lion was killed,but when they became adults they both went their separate ways(in more ways than one).I would describe this movie as an action mystery. Very entertaining. It's worth buying.",1297728000,,505,4.75
1110767,2,6306004440,"This movie was strongly recommended to me, but it unfortunately turned out to be a serious disappointment. Paul Campbell overacts in his role as a ""shoot first, ask questions later"" cop, working too hard to play the tough guy a la Steven Seagal of the 90's. Carl Bradshaw (who made his film debut as Jose in ""The Harder They Come"") doesn't do much better as crime boss One Hand.

The shootouts are laughable, the special effects are painfully bad, and the film looks as though it was shot entirely with a camcorder. This movie was Chris Browne's first attempt at writing and directing, and not surprisingly his last attempt at filmmaking. The only reason I can give this film two stars instead of one is because of the soundtrack, courtesy of artists like Sly & Robbie, Beenie Man and Red Dragon.

I do appreciate the fact that this was meant to be a gritty movie, and that the Director intentionally shot in Dungle. Beyond that, as a fan of urban film, I have no idea why this movie has such a following. My suggestion is to rent it before you buy it.",1264032000,,1052,4.473958333333333
1110768,4,6306004440,"This is a great movie, especially if you like ""Dancehall Queen"". Paul Campbell does a great job as Capone and Carl Bradshaw is excellent as usual as the crime boss. While the story is somewhat generic it is still well worth watching.",1042761600,11,233,4.571428571428571
1110769,5,6306004440,"I bought this video because it had some of the same actors as ""Dancehall Queen"" and boy did I get my monies worth! I like that Paul Campbell, the bad guy in ""Dancehall Queen"", is the hero in ""Third World Cop"". I enjoyed the interplay of action, drama, and comedy.  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoyed ""Dancehall Queen"" and does not mind some non-graphic violence.",1026345600,10,372,4.552238805970149
1110770,5,6306004440,"A one-of-a-kind movie that must be added to your ""Jamaican"" collection. It is authentic, unique and superb in content and quality! I give extreme credits to all the outstanding Jamaican actors who, without a doubt, outdid themselves. I sincerely hope this movie gives each of them the credit they deserve and that this is the beginning of a prospective future. Above all, great respect to Paul Campbell and Carl Bradshaw for their outstanding performances.",1011657600,4,456,5.175675675675675
