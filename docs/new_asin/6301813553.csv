7815822,2,6301813553,"The dance moves in this DVD, like in the 50's of this series, are too fast or too slow to most of the songs.  It's more like work than play.  However, I think it can be an effective work out, because you can see the teacher and class sweating.  The dances in the 80's of this series are perfect; they are very fun and easy to follow, and can be done at different levels of fitness.",1415059200,,381,3.986842105263158
7815823,5,6301813553,"I am a 55 y/o female. I'm slender (~115 lbs) but struggle with depression and - even worse: APATHY (where you just don't care) AND I'm a procrastinator too! I'm my own worse enemy. I KNOW I need to exercise - I feel better when I do - but I just keep putting it off ""til tomorrow"". I have a bunch of exercise tapes that I pick up in thrift stores and I like them for the most part, but the instructors tend to annoy the heck out of me. Today I found this tape at Goodwill and tried it...I absolutely LOVED it! Now you have to realize - white girl CAN'T DANCE! But the steps were easy enough to follow - I didn't get frustrated like I do with other tapes; it was like dancing rather than just exercising. I worked up a sweat and thoroughly enjoyed it.",1413849600,,750,4.040268456375839
7815824,3,6301813553,"I ordered this thinking it was a DVD, my mistake. I don't have a DVD player, so I can't rate the content. Not work the hassel of returning it though.",1379548800,,149,4.0
7815825,2,6301813553,"I needed a dance exercise tape.  I thought this would fill the bill, but not only is it too dated, she really does not each you the steps.",1268179200,,138,3.9285714285714284
7815826,5,6301813553,I work out with this video all the time....this one and get fit with the hits 1950's.  Theyre low impact yet fairly strenuous...they provide a terrific workout.  Aerobics is an excellent way to get fit and these tapes are great!!  Pick them up!!,1094428800,2,245,4.651162790697675
7815827,5,6301813553,"This tape is an excellent tape for people who just want low impact aerobics at a slightly excelerated rate; it's a little faster then most low impact instructers would go, but other than that Molly Fox, the choreography,the music it's all just terrific.  Getting physically fit with the music you love from the 60's.  Just looking at the people and the set their on takes you back to the 80's; It's great.",1019692800,6,405,4.611111111111111
7815828,4,6301813553,"I got this tape about six years ago and I have really enjoyed using it.  I love the songs on the tape and the movements go with the song.  The songs carry you away and you don't even realize how hard you are exercising! And once you get to ""Eli's Coming"" if you are not working up a sweat than you are not doing it right.  It is a energizing tape that is a lot of fun.",1010016000,6,368,3.7532467532467533
