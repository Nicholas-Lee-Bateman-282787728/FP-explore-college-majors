8341704,5,B001TJU2GS,"For someone who last caught a fish at age 10 -- a Missouri River mud-munching catfish -- I found this video genuinely fascinating.  Also, for someone with no real fishing background or even more than a casual  interest, the things that struck me most were the deep intellectual underpinnings which this sport probably shares with no others.  True, baseball has grace, and golf has beauty (at least on its perimeter) but many sports (rugby, football, boxing, hockey, and even basketball, are often just thinly papered-over thuggishness.  This video demonstrates that fly-fishing represents so much more than that -- a real literary and humane quality that shines through the beautiful natural photography and the really stunning close-ups of colorful flies (they all look like genuine works of art) being assembled.  I think even a general audience should find both this subject and the people it features warmly welcome on just about any screen anywhere.",1272153600,5,954,5.209150326797386
8341705,5,B001TJU2GS,"Fly fishing is an amazing pastime.  (I had initially used the word ""sport"", but to me fly fishing is far more than that a sport.) It has been just over a year since my first introduction to fly fishing, so the delight and pleasure of fly fishing is still new to me.  This short film beautifully conveys the magic of fly fishing, far more than I had thought possible.  If you have ever wondered what is so special about fly fishing, you should watch this amazing film.  Books cannot adequately impart the joy and beauty of fly fishing, and the cable programs on fly fishing equally miss the mark.  Why Fly Fishing, in contrast, manages to do this, and to make you feel what is so special about this activity.  Beware, though: if you do not yet fly fish, I suspect you will want to rush out to purchase a rod and reel once you have seen Joan Wulf et al. provide a glimpse of fly fishing's enchantment.",1255651200,5,899,4.321428571428571
8341706,5,B001TJU2GS,"""Why Fly Fishing"" is a beautiful film, one which instructs, informs, entertains and, best of all, evokes all the emotion we who fly fish feel when we are fly fishing.  The viewer is made to feel good about the sport and the many interesting people who practice it, and to feel the urge to get out again and go fly fishing.

8341707,5,B001TJU2GS,"How great to discover a film that helps show and explain the attraction of fly fishing, both to those who already love it and to those who don't really know anything about it.  The people in this film are not only true masters of what they do, but also at showing and telling us why they love what they do.  For those who've already cast a line, ""Why Fly Fishing"" will invariably remind you of the first time you caught a fish on fly.
