8177356,5,B000NDECG2,"This DVD sure shows a lot of detail of the history along the route of Amtrak's Empire Builder. The Empire Builder is one of several Amtrak trains I hope to ride on someday, along with other popular trains like the City of New Orleans, the Crescent, the Southwest Chief and the Coast Starlight. I consider this as a preview of what to expect if I do get a chance to ride across the country on this legendary train.",1491782400,,413,4.3076923076923075
8177357,2,B000NDECG2,The first 22 minutes were about Seattle.  I have taken the Empire Builder.  I wanted to share this with my husband.  Instead we watch a documentary about Seattle.  Big Whoop.  The last 15 minutes were about nothing in particular and Chicago architecture. Again Whoop.  The train ride lasted maybe 15 minutes.  Glad I took pictures.,1419724800,,331,4.909090909090909
8177358,4,B000NDECG2,"This dvd provides a review of the train trip from Seattle to Chicago via Amtrak's Empire Builder. It is a pretty good discussion of the highligts of the train trip and some of the interesting points along the way. Good video of the scenery. Good discussion of Seattle; history, current attractions.  Recommended for those interested in an overview of the trip.

An other dvd to consider is ""The Empire Builder - Discovering the great NorthWest"" by Green Frog Video (also available here at Amazon) for about $35 new.  That video is much more expensive but does a bit better job of covering some of the locations/cities along the train trip. It was produced by a TV station in Spokane, WA.

This video is recommended as a good value for the price.",1301184000,4,745,4.66412213740458
8177359,4,B000NDECG2,"Since my wife and I are planning to take a trip on the Empire Builder in October 2010, we wanted to get an idea what we could expect.  This DVD does a very good job of informing one what the experience will be like.  We are very satisfied with the Disc and are happy we have it to view in the future when we want to ""Re-experience"" our trip.......................",1275782400,3,363,4.246376811594203
