774094,1,6304040067,"Maybe the worst images ever transferred to video tape.  The male lead, Billy, was hysterically bad.  A complete waste of time and money.  The only reason I give this putrifying piece of trash a star is so my review will be posted.  If I could give negative stars I would - say, minus 100.",983059200,2,288,4.277777777777778
774095,5,6304040067,"An interesting movie with Shannon Tweed relishing her role, just check out the fun she has in the out-takes at the end of the film! If you are a Shannon Tweed fan make this part of your collection today.",941846400,11,203,4.230769230769231
774096,3,6304040067,"Though apparently trash, this film is actually a very sophisticated S-M fantasy with strong, deliberate psychoanalytic overtones",930787200,6,128,6.588235294117647

7860765,3,6304040067,"Its a hot and sexy ride. It make you sweat up  storm but lets face it folks , the only reason you watch this is to see Shannon Tweed naked or in tight leather. There is no story here at all.",1417996800,,190,3.6341463414634148

7860767,3,6304040067,"Not much to say. It's a cheap Skinemax film on DVD. If that's what you're looking for, this one's a pass.",1387152000,,105,4.0476190476190474
7860768,5,6304040067,"Just because Shannon Tweed was in this I wanted to watch it, and it was worth it. The had a good plot and seemed like a good Si-fi Thriller film. Some parts of this movie was funny but it had an interesting twist. I liked it, enough to spend that much money.... well no.",1348790400,,270,4.018518518518518
7860769,5,6304040067,"Electra's plot starts off pretty similar to Swampthing. Powerful villain, Mr Roach, needs Billy's,a brilliant scientist, secret formula to give him health, super strength, and an evil army to rule the world.
 But because the serum can only be spread sexually. Mr Roach has to force Billy into having unprotected sex with someone that he can later have sex with. This advances the already strange love-triangle between Billy/his stepmom Lorna(Shannon Tweed)/and his girlfriend Mary.
The film also has a good vs evil theme that climaxes with a battle between Mr Roach and his henchwomen:Karen, Gina, and Electra, vs Billy and Mary.
I liked this movie, it had a lot of eye candy, raunchy humor, and cheesy fight scenes.",1344556800,4,716,5.067796610169491
7860770,3,6304040067,"A very old oedipian theme (the attraction of a stepmother for her son), the fantams of a mad and handicapped man for physical strongness, and a magic chemical product which provide this strongness by sexual relation. It could have been a good film, and Shannon Tweed is sometimes very good, but there are too many silly shots.",1267142400,2,326,4.7368421052631575
7860771,5,6304040067,"Full marks to Shannon Tweed. Clumsy direction but if you love girls in leather then watch out for the two ladies working for the villian 'Roach'. Lorna(Shannon)'s son is the lead role who  along with his girlfriend try to stop her stepmom after she has sex with her son and becomes the powerful and evil Electra. Shannon comes really strong and hot in the film. Dressed up in leather as Electra she seduces the audiences completeley. The rest of the cast seems like fill ups as Shannon takes over the story and the movie completely. I believe her sexual appeal electrifies you and you want her to achieve whatever it is, even though you know its bad and evil. I am eagerly waiting for a sequel.",995760000,11,694,4.507936507936508
7860772,1,6304040067,"Sorry but is this film a comedy i couldn't stop laughing. From the start were we saw the 'evil villian' who looked suprisingly like DAVROS from Dr. Who. To the whole tree incedent, Billy's super powers, the scantily clad super villenesess. then at the end were it totally lost the plot giving the billy's gfriend super powers, electra's 'hold it in' line to get the cure from her step-son, DAVROS' flame throwing wheel chair, and electra gaining super powers herself for some bizzare reason which weren't even similar to billys.",983923200,4,528,4.877777777777778
