4499096,5,B004YDSNMQ,"I'be been watching this series on the Reelz channel.  The acting is superb, you would really think you were watching JFK himself and Katy Holmes is really great as Jackie.  I don't want to discount the actor playing Bobby Kennedy.  I don't think he particulary looks like Bobby but he sure sounds like him.  If you want a good idea of the politics of the era and the interactions of the Kennedy family, this is a really entertaining way to get it.  I haven't seen the whole series yet but what I have seen makes me want to purchase the dvd now.  I don't know why this series was rejected by the major tv channels and the Kennedy family.  It probably has something to do with the womanizing ways of Joe Kennedy and JFK.  I don't think it diminishes my memories of JFK and I still find him to be a great leader.  Really, this series should not be overlooked.",1302134400,48,856,4.3
4499097,3,B004YDSNMQ,"I read most of the reviews posted here and it seems everyone has made some pretty good points across the board.  There is SOOOOOOOOOOOO much to mine as far as story possibilities it is actually staggering.
First off, the acting(1.) I usually just ignore Greg Kinnear ButI think he did a pretty good job. He did look like JFK, more than I thought was possible if I had to cast someone to play Jack. Buthe can't hold a candle to Bruce Greenwood's performance in THIRTEEN DAYS. I remember seeing the Martin Sheen mini-series in 1983 and loved it, but alas, I haven't seen it since then.  Sheen is such a fine actor that I'll take it on blind faith he nailed it better than Greg. A lot of JFK's magnetic personality was lacking in the performance, most especially the dry humor. But some of that blame should be heaped onto the writers for not infusing the script with more depth.  (2.) Katie Holmes. I think she has charm and talent. Did she nail Jackie, no. was it a terrible portrayal, no.  She did her job, no better no worse than any other capable actress could have done.  (3.) Barry PepperI think he is a fine actor and did bring out certain traits of RFK that seemed to ring true. But..again I feel, like some others have already stated,  Steven Culp nailed Bobby's personality for me, anyone else is just a copy of a copy.  (4.)  Enrico Colantoni's portrayal of Hoover left me cold. Far too animated at times.  (5.) I like Tom Wilkinson and thought he gave a good performance as the cold and calculated Kennedy elder. Could it have been more sublimesure.  Could there have been a bit more lightness to counter the harsh ""Kennedy-touch-football-win-at-any-cost"" attitudeof course. Again this is the writers fault for not including these moments for the actor to use.
Overall I think the series is a Clift Notes (or Coles Notes if you're Canadian like me) version of the Kennedy era. So much was left out and so much was incorrect. I could go on and on like some others but I won't rehash  other reviews.
If you know NOTHING about the Kennedy era then it will satisfy, if you do then there are lots of things that will grate on one's nerves. SIMPLE fixes that did not hinge on spending extra moneyjust on a BETTER SCRIPT!
The production value is pretty good but there is a ""TV"" quality about it. But that comes down to budget, you can only do so much with a finite amount of money especially when dealing with a by-gone period of history. It simply costs money to change our 21st century landscape to other past eras. So I will let that go and say they did a pretty good job (even though I have no idea of the allotted budget, it is not reported on this site). Having said all thatit is also up to the director and cinematographer to take what they have and make it better with staging and lighting and camerawork andandand !
The biggest problem are 1. the writing and 2. The directing.  Lets deal with the writinglike others have stated, so many things were factually wrong with the entire series. Granted, it is impossible to include everything into an 8 hour time frame when you are dealing with such a big chunk of time and with as many important figures within this storyBUT at least when you cherry pick what you ARE going to use at least get it factually correct. The writers had the benefit of 50 years of other people's tireless investigative work on this subject (literally thousands of books and films out there) and yet it seems they made so many 101 factual mistakes with their script. This topic (the Kennedy's) should have dedicated much more that 8 hours to tell this epic story. I also agree with the few who pointed out the random ping-ponging back and forth in time within a single episode. Over all, just sloppy writing. Both writers come from TV and it shows. The director of 24, Jon Cassar, obviously used them since they worked on that show. A smart producer should have stepped in (at least one of the 14 listed) and kept them as junior writers, paid some extra money, gotten some heavy weight writers in to do the final drafts and made the entire series stronger. Oh by-the-by; someone should have Ok'd the hiring of a history consultant! But I'm sure that money was better spent on all the producers bonus's and perks or whatever.
Now on to the biggest problem, the directing. This looks like a TV mini-series. Mr. Cassar could never be accused of being cutting edge or having a cinematic eye. Most of 24's unique look came from the editing. If this production had been shot in the 1980's it would be stellar, but in 2011.it looks okay at best. The entire series is simply a homogenized version of some truly monumental events in that era that demanded more attention to detail and more time to tell the story properly.
The saddest part is that when a production company drops the ball on an important subject like this, that it usually takes a dozen years to pass until someone will justify spending money to produce a new version to get it right. At least there are other films and mini-series like THIRTEEN DAYS, JFK, PARKLAND, KENNEDY (1983), etc. to  show a more accurate view of whatever slice of the pie they chose to present.
As of this writing the same production company is producing a follow up series and I'm sure it will serve up the same old same old. Unlike the first time, I will not be buying that DVD set sight unseen.
So to sum it up, this mini series is basically the BEST OF the Kennedy's with a bunch of the hits missing.",1510790400,,5472,4.481927710843373

It is rare for any famous families to allow all truth be told & in my research & knowledge gained about JFK & RFK and OMG-Joseph P. Senior; what a piece of work!!  I enjoyed the series very much. Despite JFK's foibles my heart feels for all he went through. A brave man!  Would have perhaps brought about peace. He was ahead of his time & the Mafia & Government conspired & assassinated him with hired assassins- NOT Oswald!  It's been proved now. Archives has documents to view for us. I have always been deeply affected by the glamorous couple and family. Amazing and sad. Brilliant, beautiful, wealthy. Bobby knew he'd probably be assassinated as well and now it is known the same fate as his brother's was his. He accepted it. Joseph P. Sr. Really drove that family!!  Like a Greek tragedy with deep psychological implications thread through everyone.  The implications of that neo fascist government participation in the public execution then coverup of Kennedy's death are alarming today in this present time!!!!

Greg Kinnear has always been one of my favorite actors and he is perfectly cast as Kennedy.  His acting really captures JFK's persona.  His physical portrayal and accent is spot-on (he's so handsome!) and Katie Holmes is stunning as Jackie Kennedy -- she really brings that sort of enigmatic grace to the role that Jackie Kennedy had.  Barry Pepper is beyond fantastic as Robert Kennedy -- he totally nails it.  The British actors (Tom Wilkinson and Diana Hardcastle) are completely amazing as Joe and Rose Kennedy.  Not to leave out the other cast members - they are equally wonderful in their roles also and bring tremendous life to this series.  I have read some negative reviews of this series and I'm not sure how it could be viewed that way -- this is simply one of the best portrayals of the Kennedys that I have ever seen.

4499136,5,B004YDSNMQ,"I had always thought that Greg Kinnear would be perfect to play JFK, so I was thrilled to find this on Netflix. I could not stop watching. I have always loved John Kennedy. I was young when he was killed and did not know much about the Cuban missile crises and the bay of pigs. This series not only was enlightening but displayed the very human aspect of Kennedy. While I can understand the Kennedy family not wanting the dark side of our president to be brought to light, JFK will still be one of the best presidents to sit in the oval office.
The performances were outstanding,  I just wish that there had been more about the Vietnam war as well as his contribution of the Peace Corps. There was so much to the short time Kennedy served as president, and it would have been nice to see more.
I plan on purchasing the series to watch again and again.",1463443200,,851,4.285714285714286

4499139,5,B004YDSNMQ,"From E's Talk Soup to the White House, Greg Kinnear pulls this off! I didn't know what to expect from this series. I only knew it was probably one if the toughest subjects any actor could think to tackle. JFK is so well known it would take a miracle as a viewer to lose yourself to the actor in this role. There'll be those who are far pickier then I about this, but as far as I'm concerned, Kinnear nailed it.

Historically speaking, this was quite well done. You can feel the tension in the war room as they make plans for the Cuban ""Quarantine"". You get a newfound feeling of respect for RFK. As his older brother's champion and the well grounded, and ""happily married to Ethyl"" guy, RFK holds his ground against everybody from his father to J. Edgar. You also understand JFK's desire to keep from going to nuclear war with the Soviet Union.

The Kennedys offers a fantastic view of Camelot and JFK's proverbial Knights of the Round Table.",1459296000,,942,4.4393063583815024

4499150,5,B004YDSNMQ,"Thoughts in passing on the major cast of THE KENNEDYS (Canada-US-2011):
Greg Kinnear looks a lot like JFK but can't do the voice.
Barry Pepper has Bobby's way of speaking down perfect, but there's no physical resemblance.
Tom Wilkinson portrays their dad as a calculating, cold-hearted, adulterous bastid. Physically he's too stout for the role, but that's minor.
Katie Holmes, who has been criticized elsewhere as one-dimensional, gives a fine performance throughout the series.

Plotting seems somewhat arbitrary. There's time to watch Lee Oswald eat fried chicken while Air Force One lands at Love Field, but not a second for the Anniston and Birmingham, AL. bus station attacks on Freedom Riders, for a single comparison.

The biggest gap in the story, perhaps of necessity, is any mention of youngest Kennedy child, Ted.

There's much invention in these eight hours. General Thomas Bennett (Barry Flatman) a fictional composite of the Air Force's Curtis LeMay (and others), is portrayed as a seething warhawk. Lost in history but brought to life here is Secret Service Agent Abraham Bolden (Rothaford Gray) the first man of color to personally guard a Chief Executive. Their few brief conversations are wholecloth, but welcome in a story that  deals in part with the touchy subject of race relations.

Each chapter has at least one supposition flashback moment. Rose (Diana Hardcastle) glancing at a snapshot of daughter Rosemary (Laura Schutt) takes us to events that led to this intellectually challenged girl's tragic lobotomizing. Joe's mention that he misses his first-born son returns the story to WWII and the air explosion death of Joe Jr.(Gabriel Hogan). A comment to Jackie that she must've known from their first meeting that JFK would one day be president allows for a scenario on how the two met.

The assassination in Dallas is finely rendered with just hints of the horror within that open Lincoln.
LBJ asking Bobby's permission soon after the murder to be sworn in as President was a surprise to this viewer, as was the depiction of Jackie hooked on ""Dr. Feelgood""'s speedball shots a year earlier. That she left her husband just prior to the Cuban Missile Crisis was also news.

But most of the story is familiar, and well-done by all concerned.

One sad highlight comes late; RFK's despair over his brother's murder, which he takes the blame for, both to wife Ethel (Kristin Booth) and father Joe, who's been left a silent cripple by a near-fatal stroke. Barry Pepper's acting in these scenes is superlative, a viewer can feel Bobby's personal agony.

That the final episode races through history's pages isn't a detraction, for the JFK story is central to this miniseries; all events from Dallas forward  seem almost epilogue in nature.

For all  interested in late 1950s and early '60s American political history, THE KENNEDYS is a must-see.
For anyone unfamiliar with the era and family story it may not be as compelling,
yet, is certainly educational to those wanting an idea of those tumultous years.",1449878400,9,3028,5.046092184368738

4499209,5,B004YDSNMQ,"This production was excellent on every level. This mini series covers the intimacies, ruthlessness, passions and flaws of the Kennedy family, as well as the significance of JFK and his presidency. Rolling all of that into eight hours in a manner sufficient to hold one's interest is no easy task to begin with, and ""The Kennedys"" accomplishes this with no apparent agenda. Like many others, I've seen and read much about JFK and this family over the years, but never anything that so artfully and realistically captures the nuances and transformations of the individuals, the family and the nation as does this film. We see young Jack as a playboy with the mantle of his father's ambitions thrust upon him after his older brother's death in World War Two. It's fascinating to know that on many levels he didn't even want to be President. We see that, initially, he struggled to be up to the job and was forced to grow into it as he was simultaneously admonished to grow as individual, husband and father. We see how RFK carried and covered for Jack in those earlier days, and continued to do so in personal matters, even as JFK became less reliant on him as President. There is the backdrop of the heartwarming, plutonic love story between RFK and Jackie, and his reticence to let her go after the assassination. We see Jackie's (somewhat ironic) affinity for Joe, Sr., a man hardly deserving of sympathy but trapped in his own body by a debilitating stroke and largely ostracized by his family. Most of all, we see the incredible strength of Jackie Kennedy, whose doubts, fears and regrets are overcome with force of character and true love for her husband. We see all of this against the backdrop of a nation and a world on the verge of implosion, a time still referred to by many as ""Camelot"".

The brilliance of the cast, particularly that of Greg Kinnear and Katie Holmes cannot be overstated. Other reviewers have described these portrayals as ""eerie"", almost as though we're seeing the real John and Jackie Kennedy on screen. Though slightly overshadowed, the acting of Barry Pepper (Robert Kennedy) and Kristen Booth (Ethel Kennedy) was in the same arena. Tom Wilkinson has received well-deserved critical acclaim for his portrayal of Joe Sr., and I believe Diana Hardcastle was just as good as the matriarch, Rose. Almost lost in the shuffle is Laura Schutt's haunting portrayal of Rosemary. Don Allison and Enrico Colantoni remind us (again) that LBJ and J. Edgar Hoover were manipulative power mongers with ice water in their veins.

As time continues to move forward, the US and the world continue to pay a heavy price for the shots fired in Dallas more than fifty years ago. Watching this mini series, it matters not if one is Democrat or Republican- it is virtually impossible to ignore the value of those times...what was, what could have been, what might have been and what will never be again. If you care nothing for history, stellar acting and brilliant productions, skip this one. If not, ""The Kennedys"" is a must-see.",1395446400,,3038,4.7958015267175576
4499210,5,B004YDSNMQ,"I get so wrapped up in the show, that I forget they are not the real Kennedy's.  Katie Holmes is Jackie to a ""Tee"".  It is interesting and gives you a great look at the workings of politics even back then.",1394668800,,205,3.975609756097561

4499212,5,B004YDSNMQ,"I didn't expect this to be as good as it was. I'm not a fan of Katie Holmes acting, but she did do OK as Jackie. The rest of the case was absolutely phenomenal & I was entranced from start to finish.",1393459200,,199,3.761904761904762
4499213,4,B004YDSNMQ,"This mini-series is loaded with amazing actors and actresses playing every part as if to be sure you (the viewer) feels invited into observing the Kennedy family experience yourself on location right with them. It certainly doesn't have that cold, staid undertone of a typical Kennedy documentary. The fashions and interior decorating are perfect in their accuracy. The lighting of the indoors scenes even feel purely 60's in a way that convinces you it really is the 60's style of everything. Like on record album cover photography from that era.

Even though actor Barry Pepper does not physically look a lot like Bobby Kennedy he has the rare talent of seeming so much like him on screen in other ways. There's an indescribable tenderness to him as Bobby.

Famous British actor Tom Wilkinson who was awesome as General Cornwallis in the Revolutionary War drama ""The Patriot"" and then as Ben Franklin in the HBO miniseries about John Adams is equally stunning as Joe Kennedy Sr. Talk about acting talent!

Of all actors who ever played JFK, Greg Kinnear as JFK to me is the closest physical resemblance to the real JFK, and the quality of his imitation of his mannerisms and voice cannot be criticized.

The opening theme music is absolutely mesmerizing as a dreamy gaze into the early 60's via visions of the atmosphere of Washington D.C. I actually wish I could have it playing as a long symphony on a CD recording to listen to! Composer John Williams accomplished the same effect for some of Oliver Stone's ""JFK"" and ""Nixon"" movie soundtrack scores - a musical sound I fell in love with.

Speaking of the opening credits to the episodes, the flashes of the characters shows a very quick glimpse of Marilyn Monroe from behind singing ""Happy Birthday Mr. President"". However, for viewers who like Marilyn Monroe it was a little disappointing to find that the actual scene of that had been deleted from the mini-series. Another small disappointment is that Ted Kennedy should have been portrayed at least briefly. He is not portrayed at all. I agree with other customer reviews that said the same. I guess because the sadness of what happens to Kennedy daughter Rosemary during the 1940's was something chosen to be more important for emotional impact to be included than the personage of Ted Kennedy would have been.

I also agree that two more episodes would have given a little more completed story of the Kennedys within the finality of the assassination of Bobby Kennedy to make it an even ten. There should have been more substance to that part and what happens to the rest of the family as the 1960's decade comes to a close.

Despite the aspects that are not so great, this mini-series is still (in my opinion) good enough to count as irresistible if you're in the mood to watch something about the Kennedys, or even if you're just in a 1960's civic, political frame of mind.",1392076800,2,2885,4.7695390781563125

It also shows how much actual physical pain he was in daily ,just to function normally.
I won't spoil the ending by sharing too much detail, but everything I can remember about the family that has been reported to us, and more, are here in this movie.

I'm always suspicious of depictions like this, but it is a movie and producer/director/writer make no promise that it's a documentary. Many times people forget it's a movie and there are always certain liberties taken. Nevertheless, it certainly moves along, never boring and sheds light on some aspects of the family that have never been touched (that I've ever seen) like the mentally-challenged sister and what happened to her.",1370822400,,535,5.022471910112359

4499251,5,B004YDSNMQ,"First, let me begin by saying why I almost gave it a Four instead of a Five Star rating.....  Mainly because of the TOTAL omission of Edward M. Kennedy (Teddy).  He was absolutely and completely left out... not as much as a single reference to this historical figure.  I am assuming it could only be that the producers were trying to avoid legal action by the family... Similarly, the sisters are avoided.  (The exception of this would be the episode concerning mentally-handicapped Rosemary, and her tragic, botched lobotomy.)  Character omission from the get-go tarnishes the historical accuracy of the series for me.  Also, I was let down by the entire understated (?) assassination of JFK sequence.  I really don't know what I expected, but that was definitely NOT it!  Those issues somewhat diminished the series for me.
  Now with that out of the way, let me go onto what I found enjoyable.  First of all, I found the portrayals by Greg Kinnear and Barry Pepper to be dead on!!!  The best actor portrayals I have ever seen of those two complex men.  Frankly, I was mesmerized.  Not only was the resemblance pretty amazing, but the voice characterizations were good, too.  I have heard other viewers' criticisms and it has quite frankly left me stumped. I don't get it.  Even Katie Holmes was criticized and I found her to be more accurate than other actress who have tried to pull it off.  A possible exception might be Roma Downy who was quite good in ""A Woman Named Jackie"" (I think).  That was a series worth seeing, as well.
  Real-life Husband and wife, Diana Hardcastle and Tom Wilkinson, did well as Rose and Joe Kennedy in a commendable fashion.  I think Hardcastle probably nailed the emotionally cool yet strong matriarch of this complex clan. I haven't seen many performances of Rose Kennedy, but I assume she was pretty true to the character of this interesting woman.
  I wish the series had had more episodes so more detail could have been given to issues such as Jack's womanizing (including more on Marilyn Monroe and the multitude of others he bedded), his back-pain, heath issues and drug dependency, shady political shenanigans and his overall relationship with Jackie as husband and wife and their children.  It would have been interesting to have seen more of the personal side of Jackie as well.  She was a chain-smoker and also enjoyed the medical services of Dr. Max Jacobson, aka Dr. Feelgood. This was only alluded to in one episode. Jackie's own father, BlackJack Bouvier, was also a notorious womanizer, ironically, like her husband.
  It would have been a service to viewers unfamiliar with the background of Joe, Sr. to have given some insight which would explain his frantic ambition towards his sons' success and power. To have portrayed the prejudices experienced by the early Kennedy and his forefathers would have been helpful in order to understand his determination.  The treatment of Irish Catholics in old Boston was harsh and Joe was quite a credit to have made his achievements.  He became the youngest  bank president in the country as of that time, rose in financial and social status, was a bootlegger, Hollywood producer and multi-millionaire all before he was tapped by FDR to become Ambassador to the Court of St. James, prior to WWII.  He was then to leave in disgrace due to his pacifist stance against the approaching Nazi storm.
  I enjoyed the hauntingly beautiful, yet regal theme music throughout the series, featuring a simple trumpet.  It was a dramatic and moving overture for the beginning of each episode.  The entire musical score was appropriate and memorable.
  I urge readers of this review to buy this mini-series and hope that they enjoy it as much as I. Such a dramatic time in history, such a dramatic and complex dynasty. There is so much story to tell about The Kennedys.  A tragic and flawed yet remarkably accomplished family.",1365120000,,3903,4.848714069591528

4499259,4,B004YDSNMQ,"Via various print media, I had read two reasons why this biopic about the Kennedy's may not have been aired.  The first reports seemed to indicate that the acting was poor.  The second indicated that the mini-series may have been embarrassing to the Kennedy family.  I find this interesting, considering that the acting was pretty darn good by all (Katie Holmes was a bit off - lol) and, unless one has been hiding under a rock for the past 20-30 years, there wasn't really anything ""new"" about the family that most people wouldn't have known simply by osmosis from television let alone reading various unauthorized biographies about them.

""The Kennedys"" mini-series focuses on the origins of the family's ambition through the patriarch, Joseph Patrick Kennedy, and through the Kennedy White House years.  Greg Kinnear was EXCELLENT as John F. Kennedy (had the elite Boston dialect down pat and looked the part perfectly).  Barry Pepper was also excellent as younger brother Robert Kennedy, but his prosthetic nose sometimes got in the way of his performance (lol - he was still excellent, though).  Katie Holmes... was Katie Holmes.  She was OK as Jacqueline Kennedy in that she looked the part... I felt she fell a little short of acting and sounding like Jackie Kennedy.  Tom Wilkinson was great as Jospeh P. Kennedy... really the whole supporting cast was very good.  No one did a poor acting job.

I've seen better mini-series, but ""The Kennedys"" did a good job of showcasing this brilliant, but flawed family in a well-rounded way.  I felt that JFK, Jackie O and Robert Kennedy were portrayed as very real people who cared about their civic duties, but oft times had an imperfect way of handling their family lives (like many people).  In my opinion, it should have been aired... It was very good.",1359331200,,1804,4.8754098360655735
4499260,5,B004YDSNMQ,"I am still puzzled by why in the world this mini series garnered so much controversy before its release.  Nothing is covered that has not been speculated or written in other venues.  The Kennedy's, like any powerful political family, had its dysfunctional dark side as well as its philanthropic generosities.  In my humble opinion, this series captured it all.

The Kennedy's did not want this movie out and I can see why. Back in the 1940's and into the 60's, the news media respect for the highest office would not allow some of the tabloid stories that we are accustomed today. Private life was kept private, no matter what took place. We have learned one thing, all Presidents are in fact human and as such can make mistakes. Do we feel different today about Thomas Jefferson, even though he had inter-racial sex with his black slave? Franklin Roosevelt had a well known mistress in the white house. In fact, the media was not supposed to take pictures showing how he was crippled with polio. So, Kennedy was a womanizer, Betty Ford was an alcoholic.

We knew about the Bay of Pigs and the Cuban Crisis. We knew about Dallas in 1963 and later the Bobby Kennedy shooting.  It was all there in the storyline and transfered to the screen perfectly. The actors gave great credit to the people they were portraying. JFK, Bobby Kennedy, Jackie and the rest. The movie came across as a ""Godfather"" type with a political background..

In addition, Katie Holmes stakes her claim to fame with her portrayal of Jackie.  In fact, from Holmes to Tom Wilkinson, there isn't a poor performance in the production.

All the major characters are presented warts and all, making their achievments all the more laudable.  In particular, the dynamic between Joe Kennedy, his sons, and organized crime are presented very candidly and without resorting to rose-colored glasses.  A real achievment here.

4499283,2,B004YDSNMQ,"I thought the actors actually did well with the script they were given but it was too biased, glossing over the misdeeds we all now know was part of the fabric of this family. JFK's liason were glossed over, portraying Marilyn Monroe as a mentally unbalanced stalker. RFK was portrayed as a saint, drinking only Dr. Pepper and totally faithful to Ethel. Ethel was depicted as some housewife driving car pools instead of the real woman who simply popped out babies in competition with Rose. I actually felt Katie Holmes did a decent job with her portrayal of Jackie. The whispery voice was close to accurate but little was done to show her redecorating of the white house or the fact that her spendthrift ways was a source of friction between her and Jack. Joseph and Rose Kennedy were probably pretty accurately depicted. From what I've read elsewhere, Rose was pretty cold with her religion taking center stage and indeed influencing her apparent lack of grief over the loss of several children.

I don't know if the Kennedy's had any say in how this movie was done. I suspect they didn't have much influence which wasn't really necessary since this was for the most part a puff piece. It could have been better since we now know so much more about the family than was ever admitted in the 60s.",1349308800,,1295,4.630434782608695
4499284,5,B004YDSNMQ,"This is a three disk collection containing a total of eight episodes, each about 45 minutes in length. Over all the series is very well done. I give it five stars. There might be a quibble here or there with a few historical details, but nothing too dramatic. I was, however, disappointed by how many things were not included. The last two episodes in particular rush through some of the most important historical events during JFK's presidency. I would liked to have seen this as a ten episode series, but I guess it's better to be left wanting more, rather than less.

Below is a synopsis of each episode, which may contain spoilers.

Episode One: Joe's Revenge Hour I: This first disk is where we meet the family. We quickly learn that Joe Kennedy had early aspirations for the presidency, but loses the opportunity through mistakes he made as ambassador. In his stead, Joe Junior plans to fulfill his father's dream. Obviously that doesn't happen and the obligation falls to Jack.

Episode Two: Joe's Revenge Hour II: Jack has just been elected president, but is still living under his father's thumb. In flashbacks we learn that Jack had no initial aspiration to become president. He campaigns without heart to please his father until he finally finds his voice. It's a beautiful moment, and I found myself wishing I had been there. The flaws of the Kennedy family are portrayed in various roles, particularly that of unfaithful husbands.

Episode Three: Us Against Them: This is the episode where Jack makes his famous big blunder, the Bay of Pigs. It opens just before the inauguration. Rose Kennedy asks her daughter-in-law, Jackie, who has recently had a baby, what she will wear to the inauguration. Jackie mentions that she has eight weeks to get her figure back, and Rose snubs her by saying that it only took her four. (Oh, to be a woman.) We also see Joe Senior's influence continue. Joe insists that Bobby become Attorney General.  Jack tells his father that Bobby doesn't want to be Attorney General, and Joe responds, ""Well, I want it for him."" And that's that.

Episode Four: Who's In Charge Here: Joe dabbles in the mob with both feet out of the pond. As Attorney General, clean-cut Bobby attacks the mob head-on. Sound like trouble? It is. Once again the presidency becomes off-limits to Joe, all the while the Berlin Wall goes up. Jack continues to battle health problems, particularly the old injuries he sustained during World War II.

Episode Five: Life Sentences: The civil rights movement is in full swing, though it isn't swinging smooth. Lindon Johnson seems to be the only cabinet member able to communicate with southern politicians. As the presidency prepares to support James Meredith's enrollment at Old Miss, as ordered by the Supreme Court, Joe suffers a debilitating stroke. The family members are left reeling as they try to cope with their unresolved feelings. Rose, in particular, is burdened by troubling memories. Simultaneously, law and order dissolve in Missouri as a near civil war atmosphere engulfs the university and threatens the state.

Episode Six: The Brink: Jack's indiscretions cause Jackie deep pain. She takes a trip to Virginia with the children just before the Cuban Missel crisis begins. Tensions run high as the entire cabinet works together to prevent disaster. This is truly JFK's finest moment, and true to form, Bobby is continuously at his side. Ethel and Jackie have a candid conversation, and Jackie returns to the White House as Jack brings the country safely through what could have easily become a nuclear war.

Episode Seven: Lancer and Lace: The episode opens with Walter Cronkite telling the world that the president is dead. The rest of the episode leads up to that point. Jack's affair with Marilyn Monroe is referenced, and as usual, Bobby is stuck cleaning up the mess. Jack commits more definitively to Jackie prior to the assassination, which is left to the imagination, or memory, and the families reaction to Jack's death is explored.

Episode Eight: Bobby picks up where Jack left off, protecting Jackie as if she were a blood relative. Jackie eventually remarries, stating the need to keep her children safe. Bobby is determined to carry on in politics, and becomes a presidential candidate. When the polls show him out of favor he turns to his mother for political backing. He begins to rise in the polls only to be assassinated a short time later. As he is dying he asks Ethel, ""Was anyone else hurt?"" And that's the end of Bobby. With such a gruesome end to the tale, the episode closes by going through some enthusiastic scenes that leave the viewer feeling like everything is fine.",1347148800,,4668,4.87515762925599

It didn't help that her part was so blah. They made her into a perfect little princess while everyone else was fleshed out and human. The most interesting part about it is seeing the bigger historical perspective in which all the action occured.

4499289,4,B004YDSNMQ,"The mini-series THE KENNEDYS is one of the best films on the Kennedy family I have seen in a long time. Taking place from JFK's election up til RFK's assassination, it is very entertaining and filled with accurate historical events during Kennedy's presidency. Compared to the mini-series KENNEDY starring Martin Sheen, I enjoyed THE KENNEDYS much more, although Martin Sheen's KENNEDY is enjoyable also. However, when I watched Greg Kinnear in THE KENNEDYS, I felt as though I could be watching the real John Kennedy. He resembled the President quite a bit. When I watched Martin Sheen in Kennedy, I just felt like I was watching Martin Sheen doing an impersonation of JFK. Plus THE KENNEDYS contains more historical fact, as when Marilyn Monroe sings Happy Birthday to the President. And Katie Holmes is fabulous as Jackie. All in all, Martin Sheen's KENNEDY is like watching a movie about JFK. Greg Kinnear as Kennedy is like watching history unfold.",1337731200,2,953,5.0
4499290,5,B004YDSNMQ,"The miniseries follows the Kennedy family from their days during WWII, JFK's early political career to his Presidency of the United States, with the help of his domineering father Joe Sr. and his devoted brother Bobby. But JFK had many obstacles -- he suffers a bad back, his father made many enemies, and his marriage to Jackie was troubled. Over the course of his administration, JFK grapple with Cuba, the missile crisis with the Soviet Union, riots over civil rights for Blacks, and going after the mob. The series' more salacious aspects: drug habits, mobsters, election fixing by Joe Sr., and JFK's womanizing are revealing until the assassinations that destroyed both Jack and Bobby. The miniseries is a fair and sympathetic look at the Kennedy clan overall and it is a must see for those interested in an overall view of JFK and his Presidency.",1336694400,,852,4.882758620689655
4499291,3,B004YDSNMQ,"Like the plot irregardless of how accurate... I lived through it, but it doesn't bother me whether the experts argue how accurate specific conversations are.  What troubles me more are the actors - especially Katie Holmes' NJ/chawing accent and stilted movements; shows just how too awkward Holmes' is in her acting skills - better choice out there, surely?  This is not Jackie as many saw her in MA.  Kinnear is uncanny at times with the mannerisms especially the grimace - he talks closely enough to match JFK and the story dares to show the flaws of the man - HOORAY.  Pepper is the most disturbing to watch, yet to listen is remarkably spot on with the voice, tone and mannerisms of even the upper lip roll.  He doesn't look a thing like Bobby - the most attractive of the boys.  The drug use was whispers among those who knew them from Newport and of course the philandering.  I agree with another's commentary about Ted's omission from the story - Chappaquiddick the ultimate in his own philandering coverup.  Finally, the parents are as steely and driven as the originals - difficult to watch and realize that the truth of how they were polar opposites of each other yet firmly joined in demanding position and power.",1335916800,,1224,4.686915887850467

I guess what bothered me most was it was too short. I wanted more and more..details and answers/major events. The actors did well with the script they had and limited direction. Yeah, they didn't look like the real McCoy but after awhile, I got used to it -suspended my disbelief like in theatre. I agree with other viewers, last 2 episodes seemed to rush by way too fast. Like, ""we're running out of time, quick, throw in Marilyn & Oswald.."" And that was another issue for me. Treating Marilyn like a cheap slut who came onto Bobby like her next challenge/conquest. Where did they get this stuff? He was like a moth circling a flame after she sang Happy Birthday to RFK in 62 -but no mention of that. The Kennedys could have any woman they wanted, and they did. Marilyn was just one more conquest for both of them -users. But they got theirs, didn't they? Cosmic justice comes around. She deserved better than this miniseries debasement of her. So, who is brave enough out there to make a movie on Marilyn Monroe? Oh wait, no grand jury investigation into her death so we really don't know how she died, 50 YEARS LATER! -thanks to the Kennedy Family/FBI coverup.

4499294,4,B004YDSNMQ,"The Kennedys is a mini-series that started under an air of controversy when the History Channel decided not to air the show.  It was eventually aired on the Reelz channel.  While the series does have moments such as showing both JFK & Jackie taking ""vitamin"" shots to give them energy to make through their grueling schedule, showing some of JFK's philandering, it isn't a salacious tell-all exposing the dark side of the Kennedy presidency.  The heart of the series shows of the rise of JFK from young playboy to esteemed leader and the large role his father and brother Bobby played in his triumphs.  Greg Kinnear is very good as JFK.  He plays him a sympathetic figure whose main goal is to please his father.  Tom Wilkerson is excellent as the Kennedy patriarch Joe.  He plays him with a ferocity and an underlying evil streak.  Barry Pepper stands out above all as RFK.  He plays him as a man who is torn between the ambitions of his father for his sons and his want to live a quiet life with his large family.  Katie Holmes is not terrible as Jackie but she plays her as a sad and empty person which is what I guess the direction was.

The portrayals of these characters seemed like such incredible exaggerations. Then, the writers took a bunch of facts, scrambled them up with whatever lame obvious fiction they could pull from their brains, and wrote trite, contrived conversations around them - like a president and first lady's discussion presumably around the couple getting addicted to uppers: ""oh honey, I think its time you laid off those injections""... and ""oh, OK, yeah and btw you should too honey"" and weeeeee problem solved.

4499297,5,B004YDSNMQ,"I thought this series well done, and effectively censored on American TV not because it was materially untrue, but because the Kennedy family didn't want us reminded of Camelot's darker sides. The mobsters. Marilyn Monroe. Drugs. Marital tensions. Chicago. Joe Sr. Rosemary.

That said, this series is actually sympathetic. It shows the main players - Joe Sr. and Rose, Jack and Bobby, Jackie and Ethel - as real people, struggling to succeed and to stay together despite all the glamour and ambition and opportunities to fail.

Drug use by Jack? A response to the unremitting back pain he suffered, plus his many medications for his illnesses.  A playboy? It's good to be king, particularly if you're super rich, and a lot more men in his social stratum tended both to do this and expect to get away with it back in that day. A charmer? Yes, because he was smart, witty, self-deprecating and ultimately possessed of enough wisdom and justice to, say, find the world's way through the Cuban Missile Crisis without launching our own missiles.

Joe Sr. a tough guy who stopped at nothing and drove his family mercilessly? Yep, and found great success doing it, and that was the way a lot of parents were in those days. And he remained close to his family all the while. (He must have done something right: in 2012, we're still talking about the Kennedys and yet another one has declared for office.)

Bobby ruthless? Yep, and watching his brother's back the whole time, pounding on the Mafia and meanwhile finding time to father a dozen kids.

And while it alludes to some of the disclosures tainting the original glowing-but-unreal Camelot image, it then treats the characters sympathetically. Dalliances between Bobby and Marilyn, and later Jackie, are hinted at but never spelled out, just as they've been in history. Giancana? Joe Sr. and his way of doing politics emerged from an era when dealing with mobsters, mob-controlled unions and machine bosses was a given in politics. An assassination conspiracy is hinted at, but meanwhile Lee Harvey Oswald is still shown as the shooter. Stimulant shots from Max Jacobson, Dr. Feelgood? Both Jack and Jackie are shown weaning themselves off it, in response to the other's concerns for them. Marital tensions between them? Obviously, but each stands in there and appears to value the other, Jack's philandering not withstanding. (You do have to wonder why a guy married to the most glamorous woman in the history of the world would fool around with anyone, but when you're rich and handsome and used to it and women like Marilyn Monroe are throwing their buxom selves at you - well, it's a dilemma a lot of us guys would like to have.)

I liked the pacing of this series. It's not a documentary, and can't bring to the fore every single event of that momentous time. It selects them reasonably well, picking ones that either allow Kennedy family subplots to develop, or other major factors such as their delicate relationship with J. Edgar Hoover. Its omission of Teddy and the Kennedy sisters, apart from Rosemary, was a reasonable and prudent choice to make, as none of them played central roles in the events recounted here as they've come down through history, and meanwhile every minute devoted to them, out of about six hours of action, would have been a minute less devoted to the major characters. (You could easily, of course, create a six- or seven-season TV series out of this a la ""The Sopranos"". Between the history, the large cast of characters, the sex and glamour, the Kennedys easily would give us enough to work with.)

Meanwhile we never seem to get bogged down in any one period. The early days, the launching of Jack's political career, his marriage to Jackie, his election to the presidency and so on all keep moving, with a focus on what's going on behind the scenes. The series' biggest potential flaw is, of course, the writing of fictional dialogue to dramatize private conversations that the participants never disclosed and that no one else witnessed. But enough has been written and factually established about the Kennedy family that the general themes being played out here can't be all that far from the truth.

Katie Holmes is terrific as Jackie, capturing her beauty and elusiveness. Both she and Greg Kinnear physically resemble Jackie and Jack respectively as to really aid their fine portrayals of them. Kinnear is a few inches too short, making him the same height as his wife and shorter than his brother, both wrong, but that's a minor flaw. Barry Pepper less resembles Bobby, but he gets the speech and character so well you sort of forget about that. He really projects Bobby's rectitude and intensity.

It's informative enough to be worthwhile, and racy enough to keep you watching if its educational value doesn't. And while it shows the flaws that would have sunk people in the America of that day, it does it in the context of present-day viewers more accustomed to finding forgiveness and redemption for those who have strayed so as to not overlook the good they did, and because we would want that same understanding for ourselves.",1330819200,4,5126,4.848
4499298,4,B004YDSNMQ,"I love anything about the Kennedy family.  This production had great acting, a good script, was a good length.  The discs themselves were not that great and did not play in all my DVDs.  Also, there are no subtitles, and although I am not hearing-impaired, I like subtitles because I like to get every word, and this is not always possible with the audio.

I also don't know why Barry Pepper (Bobby Kennedy) had to wear a protheses nose.  To me, the nose made him look less like Bobby Kennedy.  I learned this from the one special feature which was included.  But all the main characters - John, Joe, Bobby, Rose, and even Jacqueline - I thought the acting was great and very true to the historical figures they were interpreting.  This is a great miniseries, and if the discs were produced at a higher quality, and with more features, like subtitles and commentary, like ""real"" DVDs, I would give it 5 stars.  As is, I have to dock one star for the poor production!",1330214400,2,966,4.474285714285714
4499299,4,B004YDSNMQ,"I spent the past weekend watching this 8-hour opus (about 6 hours on DVD plus a making-of feature) and was pleasantly surprised.  The impression I got from the controversy surrounding the broadcast was much ado about an ultimately unworthy production.  This is actually a pretty respectful, mostly well-acted accounting of what most people already know about the Kennedys.

Let me start right off by saying Katie Holmes did a good job.  That seems to be what most people want to talk about first.  I always felt Jackie was guarded and did not show much expression, and that's exactly what Katie captured.  She does have a rather remarkable resemblance to Jackie.

The second thing that most reviewers want to focus on is the portrait of the patriarch Joe Kennedy.  Since he was not so prominent in the media, the producers could take a little more liberty with his character.  I absolutely believe that Joe could have been every bit as Machiavellian and austere as portrayed by the awesome Tom Wilkinson.  How ironic that he outlived his three dynamic, handsome and compelling sons.

And while we are on the subject of sons, where was Teddy?  That's what bugs me most about this production.  Like other reviewers, I assumed since so much time was taken up with JFK's presidency, they would not even deal with Bobby's candidacy and assassination.  Since they did, however briefly, I would have thought a few seconds could have been devoted to Teddy.  The decision to omit him baffles me.  I suppose Teddy was still alive while this series was being filmed, but I am pretty sure it was released after his death.  In the making-of feature, someone mentions that one of their first decisions was which Kennedys they were going to focus on, but no specific mention of Teddy whose absence is glaring to me.

Greg Kinnear and Barry Pepper are both quite good as JFK and RFK, but the acting prize goes to Kristin Booth as Ethel.  She really lights up the screen in every scene.  The only outrageously bad performance was the actor who played the young JFK.  His Boston accent consisted solely of changing his ""ars"" into ""ahs"".  That's really not all it takes.  Did they not have vocal coaches on set?

A lot of the media seemed to delight in making fun of this production.  I really hate it when reviewers suddenly decide they are comedians.  I found this series to be relatively restrained, given the hugeness of the subject matter, but would have preferred another hour or two to spend more time on the other Kennedys.  Still a solid 4 stars.",1329696000,,2536,4.730593607305936

Barry Pepper (as Bobby)- what a transformation from the character he played on 'Like Dandelion Dust'. He's very versatile in his looks, and man, can he act! The ending, obviously known, is emotional.

I tend to be forgiving about minor factual inaccuracies if they are necessary to further the movie or appeal to a wider audience. However, The Kennedys makes a bit mistake by totally ignoring Ted Kennedy. It's as if Jack and Bobby didn't have a younger brother!

I am fascinated by all documentaries, movies and news about this period in history because I am a boomer child. Remove the historical label from this entertaining series and you witness some great acting by Greg Kinnear, Tom Wilkinson, Barry Pepper, Katie Holmes and the actress that portrayed Rose Kennedy.

Despite the controversy it had finding a distributor, ""The Kennedys"" walk away with a batch of nominations and took home a Best Actor Emmy for Barry Pepper amongst other awards.

But there are a couple of shocking scenes that challenges what you may have known about this beloved First Family. In the 80s, the criminal white trash government of Ronald and Nancy ""wet rat"" Reagan would have had you believe that they brought back the elegance and glamour of the Camelot Presidency. Nothing could be further from the truth. Katie Holmes as the elegant Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy was more believable than Nancy""wet rat"" Reagan could ever be. But the liberties this mini series took even about First Lady, Kennedy, are pretty shocking but riveting as tawdry entertainment. Tom Wilkinson burns the screen with a searing portrayal of the sometimes not very likable but highly effective, Joseph Kennedy Sr. Barry Pepper engulfed the role of Bobby Kennedy to the highest degree. Katie Holmes' acting is a little more debatable. But I enjoy it and felt that she reminded me enough of our beloved First Lady that I feel a little differently about her as an actress.

Questions are left unanswered. Marilyn Monroe looked pathetic and almost unsympathetic. It was yet another shocking turn that was at once absurd and on another cheaply captivating.

Applause to the still fringe, Reelz Channel for acquiring rights to this highly entertaining mini series. What the priceless as a
country belies that this is a cognitive dissonance to get such acknowledgment from the Emmys to help put their channel on the map. The Blu-Ray disc is quite reasonable in price.

4499319,2,B004YDSNMQ,"What a melodrama! The pace was like a soap opera. Jack always looking so grim,the way he as played it was like was with no charm or humor. Where was his famous sense of humor - his charm or grace. The way he was plyed it was like he had a migraine throughout the production. I give GK snaps for his accent though. It was not too bad In the real films of Jack we see him SMILING in the car in Dallas- in this show we see him looking pretty cranky.
 Katie Holmes did NOT capture the mystique of Jackie. Her accent seemed straight out of Brooklyn and the crooked ""smile"" ? Jackie had a breathy, soft voice with a combination of NY and Virginia accents.
I know she is married to Tom Cruise so I suppose that is why the oh wow's over her performance.
I was also distracted by the makeup - I could not get away from the white eye shadow - and the relationship between her and Jack. you never got WHY she married Jack, in this depiction she was always staring into space wondering why she was there. I wondered too. The real Jackie  was besotted with him - she had a way about her as a iron fist in a velvet glove and got what she wanted. Where was the renovation of the white house also.

And Ethel the ""gee kids lets put on a show"" attitude? Ethel, was never anything like that, critical, and harsh. That's Ethel. She and Jackie did NOT get along

Rose- crying all the time? Rose had a back of icy steel, she worshiped Joe, and that scene about Rosemary? I doubt VERY MUCH if Rose went off like. Rose had a cold distant connection to her children. She was more of an administrator than a mother. I do not doubt that she loved them but this lady who played her - Rose did NOT display emotion and if you have read her writings she firmly believed in control of her emotions.

I am not sure who says this is an accurate rendition of the Kennedys-
Where was the fun the humor on their interactions. They were close as could be and had an intricate relationship.
I hate it that they got this so wrong when there was tons of documentation and and archive of resources to study these people.
I find the story of Jackie, Ethel and Joan in Camelot a better rendition of these people.
I would not be so harsh at this series if I did not know there would be people who will view this as a set of facts. The producers and writers did a disservice to the Kennedys -",1321228800,3,2347,4.12691466083151

The other actors were adequate--basically mediocre.  Since this family has been idealized and placed on a pedestal for so many years, supporters do not like to accept the fact that Joe Kennedy basically bought senatorial seats and the presidency for his sons.  It is pretty well known that Joe Kennedy would go to any lengths to get what he wanted.  It's no secret that the men were all womanizers and unfaithful to their wives. Many other accounts on this family have also brought out the corruption, womanizing, dirty deals, etc.  The miniseries presents President Kennedy as a strong man who truly cared about his country and right or wrong, agree or disagree with his politics, he lead his country with honor and did his best. He was a patriot and loved his country. The miniseries shows both sides of the coin----the good and the bad and in my opinion, is a fair depiction.

4499327,1,B004YDSNMQ,"Intending to ignore the many critics' reviews panning this mini-series, I plunked down the money with an open mind.  I should have been warned when a sticker on the box indicated that the notorious tabloid ""New York Post"" hailed this as one of the most historically accurate mini-series ever.  Having lived through many of these events as well as an avid reader of multiple scholarly works on the era, I can only agree with those who contend that this was, indeed,  a right wing hit job.  Certainly the History Channel was correct in rejecting this ""dramatization"" --it certainly was not historically accurate---especially in its depiction of JFK's actions during the Cuban Missile Crisis---but I digress.

The producers of this mini-series did stress that it is not a documentary, but absent its historical accuracy--it does commit the mortal sin of not being very entertaining.  Aside from the scene stealing acting of Tom Wilkinson as Joseph P. Kennedy, everyone else in the cast portrays their respective characters as pretty self loathing creatures. And in fact, after watching all of these episodes, the viewer ends up not liking these characters either.  And that would seem to be the intended effect of putting the darkest and most sinister spin on the character and the motives of JFK, Jackie, Bobby and just about the entire Kennedy clan.

There's no question that Joseph P. Kennedy was a very unlikeable fellow and that he pushed his sons into public service.  But is seems that until his stroke in 1961--the series would have you believe that the two Kennedy brothers (I guess Teddy never did exist after all) cleared every decision through daddy--including ALL cabinet selections. In fact, it seems that through every event depicted--the Bay of Pigs; James Meredith's admission to Ole Miss; the Cuban Missle Crisis------JFK seems to be an timid, drug addled, intellectually over matched bystander.

After almost 50 years, there's little about John F. Kennedy that we don't know--including his philandering  as well as his illnesses ----and the authors of the mini-series seem to make his moral failings the central theme of this work. Kennedy was certainly an imperfect human being---as were all of the men who served the office---but it is no myth that he lead us through some of the most dangerous and tumultuous times in the history of this country.  And in regards to his fellow presidents who were considered loyal family men---the marital fidelity of Nixon and George W. Bush were never questioned---but both were disasters as Presidents and turned out to be two of the worst crooks in the history of the office--but in both cases, those facts would fill an encyclopedia.

In regards to the Cuban Missile Crisis--after the release of files in the US, the former Soviet Union and Cuba over the last forty-nine years--as well as the Kennedy tapes---we know more now about how dangerous that era was as well as Kennedy's leadership throughout the entire thirteen days.  The writers of this mini-series make it clear that this crisis was Kennedy's fault--because of his own so called ""weak kneed"" decisions regarding the Bay of Pigs fiasco. And once the Cuban Missle Crisis was underway---Kennedy seems to be a freightened bystander--overwhelmed by events.

Over the last 25 or 30 years--conservatives (and particularly ""neo conservatives"") have been busy at work, attempting to rewrite history to suit their own world view---everything from blaming FDR for the Depression to blaming JFK for the events during his administration to re-writing the Bush Administration's involvement in the Iraqi war and the economic meltdown of 2008.  But facts are stubborn things---and ""artistic license"" only allows just so much diversion from the truth.

I was so hooked on the story line that by the time it ended, it was a letdown to know I could not continue the story with the characters I had grown accustomed to, and it seemed oddly wrong to see the actual pictures of the Kennedys (the characters in the series seemed more real).

4499338,3,B004YDSNMQ,"OK Series, but not the best.
I have seen no less than about 8-15+ or more - Kennedy mini-series, docu-dramas and documentaries, as well as having done extensive reading and research on the Kennedy family.  This series is only average, at best.  The acting is frequently mediocre, although Greg Kinnear is a very good/excellent JFK.
Many ""historical"" elements are simply unsubstaniated and border on gossip and heresay.  Some are true, but great liberties are taken - some things are absolutely not correct.
Kate Holmes as JBK - An awful job.  She just doesn't have Jackie's personality, sense of wit, and none of her personality comes through.
BETTER SERIES ON KENNEDY:  Thirteen days (Movie), The Kennedy Women (TV Movie - Excellent!!!!), Kennedy (Martin Sheen as JFK - 1980's), American Experience Documentaries on the Kennedy's -JFK, RKF, JBK, etc., PBS Documentaries on Jackie, and History Channel documentaries. - Also many others, Documentary channel has some also.

BEST ACTING (AS KENNEDY's):  Overall - ""The Kennedy Women""! - This movie has some of the best acting as members of the Kennedy family. REALLY GOOD CASTING.
  Best Acting As JFK:  Greg Kinnear, and Lead Actor in Kennedy Women, and Martin Sheen too.

BEST JACKIE:  Jill Hennessey (The Kennedy Women) - Has Jackie's wit, true personality, style, physical figure, you forget she's Jill!
BEST ETHEL KENNEDY:  Lauren Holly (The Kennedy Women) - Lauren has Ethel DOWN!  She is tomboyish, simplistic, tact-less, and CAMPY!  BEST BOBBY:  Actor in Kennedy Women.  BEST TED:  Actor in Kennedy Women.  BEST KENNEDY SISTERS:  Kennedy women.

I've seen alot of Kennedy stuff.  I could recommend some good books too, but don't have enough space here.",1318377600,4,1708,5.17948717948718
4499339,5,B004YDSNMQ,"When I first heard news of this Mini-series, I was not interested in this. I thought that it was going to be another Kennedy Approved series(as the 1983 Martin Sheen version was)but When I heard that The Kennedy family opposed it-My interest grew. However When I heard who was producing the show-Joel Surnow and Jon Cassar(who also directed)of ""24"" fame-I decided that I would get the DVDS. Boy was I ever pleasently surprised.

To begin with-The Kennedys had good reason to object this. It did not present the rosey camelot view of things-Insread they showed the human side-the realistic side. They show that JFK was not the darling saint as we were led to believe-instead we see that his personal life is a shambles. Then we see Joe Sr. As he really was. He raised his boys to be ruthless-he taught them the ends justify the means.

To be fair however, JFK still had to do his Job. He had to lead the country through some difficult times-Like the Cuban Missile crisis and the Civil rights movement. I was born in 1964-so I wasn't born yet-yet in watching this I get the feeling I was there-one of millions of people watching these events unfold on TV.

I Believe that the history Channel reasons for not airing this is Pure bunk. The real reason why didn't air it is because the Kennedy Family put pressure on them not to air it. It is clear within the first 10 minutes of Episode 1 why the Kennedy family opposed this. They  opposed it because it was not the Camelot version-it showed us the real side.

The Cast was perfect-Greg Kinnear was perfect as JFK, Katie Holmes as Jackie-and Barry Pepper as Bobby. These 3 do an amazing Job and Kudos to the makeup department-my-if this wasn't a tv show-you'd think that these were the real Kennedys-they were that good. It doesn't stop there-Tom Wilkison as Joe Sr, showed who he really was. The actress who played Rose(I forget her name)also did a good job.

If I was to pick a favorite episode,It would be episode 6, the one on the Cuban Missile crisis. But I think this needs to be viewed as a six hour movie(W/O comercials)

Do notfall for the left's negative reviews-just see it for your self.",1318291200,2,2145,4.541450777202073
4499340,4,B004YDSNMQ,"Well, I'm not actually Spartacus and Greg Kinnear isn't JFK.  But in his portrayal of Kennedy, Greg Kinnear does an absolutely outstanding job!  He has the speech patterns and mannerisms of JFK down pat - and with the big wig he looks uncannily like Kennedy.  There are many scenes wherein one almost thinks they are watching newly uncovered film of the actual President.  In the scenes of him playing football with his shades on, I almost thought the producers of this series had snuck in some actual footage of the real deal.  I have no idea how Mr. Kinnear landed the role.  Unfortunately, in the interesting extra on the making of the series we are not told how Mr. K was picked to play President K - but only a casting genius could envision the actor as Kennedy.  Without the wig, without the makeup I would never in a million years pick Mr. Kinnear for the part.  But thankfully someone did - and I will say it again - Greg Kinnear is not just a Vaughn Meader (remember him?) but as others have noted, he seems to be channeling the actual man he is portraying.  Likewise with Barry Pepper's Emmy-winning portrayal of RFK.  Mr. Pepper's is a powerful, poignant performance and the award is completely earned by his actor's showcase of a performance.  And the incredibly prolific and versatile Tom Wilkinson is simply amazing as Joe Kennedy. (When Mr. Wilkinson as the Ambassador tells the actor playing Frank Sinatra to ""Shut up!"", well, it certainly doesn't seem like acting at all - and that is the highest goal to which an actor aspires, to completely hide the acting, which Mr. Wilkinson always does in whatever role he remarkably plays.  Katie Holmes as Jackie is likewise perfectly cast. Heck, the whole cast is perfectly cast!

The three discs contain the full eight episodes of this controversial series.  Eight episodes - eight hours.  Eights hours is one third of a single day.  Yet the series covers decades!  Is it any wonder that THE KENNEDYS therefore seems very rushed at times?  That it doesn't include everything of import?  How could it? Yes, instead of eight episodes there should have been at least ten.  Much is missing: for some unknown reason there is no Ted Kennedy even mentioned or even hinted at; there is nothing of the space race; there are barely a few minutes devoted to Vietnam; MLK is absent; though apparently filmed but ending up on the cutting  room floor is Marilyn Monroe's singing of ""Happy Birthday"" to her secret lover.  One could go on and on - but why do so?  The series is historical drama based on actual people and events.  It is not a documentary as many others have noted.  It is presenting the saga of perhaps the most captivating family in all of American history - and attempting to illumine not only the public side of this saga, but its personal aspects as well.  It is a drama - and the undocumented moments are historical assumptions based on known facts.  If this series makes viewers want to know more about the Kennedy clan - and by way of that, huge and profound portions of American and world history - then it has succeeded in being not merely entertainment that is over as soon as the discs stop spinning, but a recreation and evocation of a time and place that is important to never lose knowledge of.  What we have here in THE KENNEDYS is, yes, an extremely entertaining, highly educational, wonderfully emotional experience.  Are there sleazy moments shown?  Sure - but much of the actual story was sleazy, just as much of Life itself is sleazy.  Does the music score overbearingly insinuate its way into each and every scene , thereby sneakily and subliminally telling us what we should be feeling and when?  Certainly - but music underscores much of our own lives, whether it be in elevators or doctors office or coming off the TV or through the walls from the kid's room.  Bottomline - the series is flawed, but nobly so.  The makers of THE KENNEDYS aimed high - and mostly achieved their aims.

SPOILER ALERT: Having said all of the above, offering my applause by way of words, I was somewhat dismayed to see that in the seventh episode the film-makers present Lee Harvey Oswald's culpability in Kennedy's murder as a fait accompli.  Dramatically I can see why the film-makers bought into LHO's guilt: the cross cuts between his lonesome preparations to kill the President and Kennedy's people-mobbed approach to Dealy Plaza are rather effective.  The problem is that - if one were truly objective about the truth - there is as strong a case that Oswald didn't kill Kennedy as there is that he did.  With that in mind, a more ambiguous approach to the assassination should have been adopted in this series.  I recollect that the assassination was approached in just such a way in the Martin Sheen TV movie of years back.  In earlier episodes we clearly see President Kennedy ruffling the feathers of the FBI, the Mafia, the military-industrial complex, the rascist elements in the South, the Cubans (those both pro and anti-Castro) - so one would expect the assassination to have been left as the Mystery which it truly is.  But no - Oswald is depicted as the sole killer - even though in subsequent scenes we are shown RFK's wondering if, afterall, the Mafia or Operation Mongoose itself may have led to his brother's murder. We are even shown Pepper as RFK angered by the blatant, obvious, ridiculously intelligence-insulting  silencing of Oswald by Jack Ruby.  While these are RFK's feelings - since he was not in the Deposity building eating chicken with Oswald - they should have been ours, the viewers, as well. (BTW, if Oswald truly ate chicken with his rifle as company, where did he discard the chicken bones?  Surely his saliva and tooth marks and finger-prints could have been matched had chicken bones been discovered.) Anyway, dramatically the cross-cutting between Oswald and JFK and a stroke-ridden, wheel-chair bound, trying-to-stand Joe Kennedy and a soda bottle opening RFK somewhat works.  But leaving the actual killer or killers in question would have been, I think, even more powerful - and also more openly honest.  One last thing about this flawed yet vital episode:  we are sadly not in the limo with Kinnear's Kennedy because the actor is relegated to the sidelines for too long a time while actual footage of the motorcade is used.  When Kinnear is utilized again, as he turns to Jackie a final time before the first bullet, it comes as something as a shock, an intrusion to us viewers.  Frankly, it doesn't work.  And likewise, there is no real sense of the impact of the fatal head shot on both its target and Jackie as played by Katie Holmes.  Her scene in the hospital, alone with her dead husband, is extremely unmoving.  And this is not Ms. Holmes' fault at all; it is a script lapse and directorial dereliction.

Despite my personal feelings about what's wrong with episode seven as noted above, this is still a rich, rewarding, consummately acted peek into the public and personal lives of that incredible and forever interesting clan - THE KENNEDYS.  Don't miss it!

Addendum:  Two memorable moments in the series that by themselves make viewing it eminently entertaining and worthwhile - one is Joe Kennedy's telling Frank Sinatra to ""Shut up!"" and the other is JFK's leaving a White House concert - not to be shown photos of the Cuban missle sites, as we are led to believe - but to go and watch the Kirk Douglas movie SPARTACUS in his private screening room somewhere in the Freudian depths of the White House whilst chomping on a big phallic cigar and awaiting the arrival of one of his many lady-friends.  Great moments that one would never see in a documentary!  Soap opera?  Heck, yes!  But much of life is soap opera.  And unlike DALLAS or DYNASTY...this one is grounded in history!",1318204800,3,7800,4.716395864106351
4499341,5,B004YDSNMQ,"I recieved my copy of The Kennedy's over a week ago and finished watching it,and found it to be quite revealing and well acted,even though the actors Greg Kinnear and Berry Pepper didn't look axactly like thier character's. I think Tom Wilkinson did a realistic and outstanding portrayal of father Joesph P. Kennedy who was a manipulative and over bearring head of the Kennedy family who pressured his sons into politics,and raised them to be womanisers,and to get thier way,no matter who they steam rolled over to get it. Yes I think the Producer did his research very well,and it was a very accurate portrayal of Joesph Kennedy,Rose,and John and Robert,but only scratched the surface in telling the story,and would have needed at least another four or five more episodes to have covered more of thier story,including more about the Marilyn Monroe affair and the Cuban missile crisis,and there would have still been more to tell,and explain what really led up to JFK's assassination?
 For those who really enjoyed this mini series and would like to find out more and and like to read. I recommend ""Kennedy Must be Killed"",A noval by Chuck Helppie,that is well reaserched and covers alot of the same ground,and more in the portrayal of the Kennedy family, and the most likely motives behind the Assassination on Nov. 22,1963. A work of Historical fiction,it points out why JFK acquired so many enemies and thier most likely motives for wanting JFK out of the White House at any cost? In my opinion,the only thing that is fiction about the noval is the storyline and some of the fictional characters,that was written for entertainment purposes,but mainly to get the point across. This noval is also available on amazon.com",1318032000,,1721,4.93448275862069
4499342,4,B004YDSNMQ,"Let's just quickly get past the already stated History Channel paying for and then rejecting this miniseries for whatever reason we all want to believe; Kennedy family pressure, etc.

Now, down to the critique - This series was created with knowledge of real events, true enough, but there is so much drama in it that you might roll the eyes.  The rush through the events from World War II to the ending with Bobby's death is just too much time to cover properly even in a miniseries.  The series is entertaining but it is NOT a documentary and maybe that is the real reason for the History Channel rejection and the reason so many Historians bashed it.

So, remember ""miniseries"" not ""documentary"".  Unfortunately a large part of the series did show a rather unflattering view of each family member, but I would not say it was a ""smear job"".  There was tragedy in the Kennedy family, but also many wonderful times as well, but would that sell?  So they chose to show more of a negative slant, but there are volumes written and numerous shows of the positive regarding this American ""Royal Family"" and one should see those as well.

As for the actors, I would note that Greg Kinnear did a very good performance as JFK and I enjoyed watching that.  There have been reviews of Katie Holmes being stiff, but take a look at reels of a young Jackie and you will see that she was that way.

All in all, I would say that this is a slightly above average movie and an interesting and entertaining series to watch but just don't expect it to be a true documentary that follows the history of the times.  Just sit back and enjoy and don't roll those eyes because you just might miss something.

4499343,4,B004YDSNMQ,"Having watched this mini-series on History Channel Asia, the only questions that linger are the ones that surround the murders of the Kennedy brothers. Come on, do you really expect the world to believe that the Kennedy brothers were killed by lone, single oddballs?

The overly simplistic and official version of the tragic Kennedy deaths do not do justice to the truth.

Were the brothers murdered because their political rivals, the CIA and the American military-industrial complex wanted to continue to wage phoney wars, like those in Asia - wars that killed MILLIONS OF innocent civilians that are unreported and ignored even to this day? Could the wars in Indo-china be avoided or scaled down if JFK had remained in office?

Or, were the brothers killed because they were initiating reforms to civil rights for minority groups? Martin Luther King, Jr. was killed in 1968 and he had also met with tremendous political obstacles that wanted to impede societal reform.

Or, were the Kennedy brothers killed BECAUSE they were Catholics? They were living in times when anti-Catholicism was still rife in America, within an insane fearful environment created and propagated by fanatics from the Protestant camp. America was, and is, after all, a Protestant/atheist country with crazy right-ring elements that can't seem to think rationally.

Out with the truth, History Channel!

On a lighter note, actress Charlotte Sullivan is a hottie that could have spiced up this show! She takes up about 10-15 mins of air-time as Marilyn Monroe, whom JFK had had a fling with. Charlotte Sullivan looks more sizzling than Marilyn Monroe! If you want to watch more of Charlotte, be sure to catch the TV series ""Rookie Blue""!

What's great about this mini-series is how the actors look almost like the historical characters that they play.

4499344,4,B004YDSNMQ,"This mini-series was originally commissioned by the history channel. The Kennedy family eventually brought enough pressure that the history channel declined to air it. And so did most of the large American television outlets. That the Kennedy family has the power to ban a mini-series is a sad comment on modern America. And after finally seeing it, its very difficult to understand why they even cared.

Its not exactly controversial. Its really old fashioned and its fault (if anything) is that it takes itself too seriously. But it says nothing about the Kennedy family that has not been said before in many other places. And its also often well acted. While it takes liberties with documented history at times, it doesn't do so in a mean or nasty way. And it doesn't break any new ground.

Tom Wilkinson gives an outstanding performance as Joe Kennedy. Its certainly the best performance of 2011 on television. Greg Kinnear is ok, but nothing special.

Those looking for scandal will probably be bored. Considering all the junk that gets taken seriously today (take HBO for example), its sad that something like this was driven off television and prohibited from awards consideration. Its not the greatest thing I've ever seen, but its better than most of whats on television these days. At the very least they were trying.",1316476800,3,1327,4.941704035874439
4499345,5,B004YDSNMQ,"""Your name is Kennedy & Kennedy's never come second."" The controversial
mini-series passed on by the History Channel that shows the highlights
of the life of JFK (Kinnear) and RFK (Pepper). Beginning with the
family preparing for election night and following them, with
flashbacks, until the assassination of Bobby. Being a huge history
buff, and more specifically a Kennedy buff I was very much interested
in this. When I saw Greg Kinnear and Barry Pepper playing the roles of
Jack and Bobby I was excited to see them in this. I was not
disappointed at all. While some of the events were not exactly as they
happened (Joe finding out about the assassination for one) this is
still a very good account of the life of the men. Being a mini series
and so much to cover almost all of the events are glossed over quickly,
(the Cuban Missle Crisis is begun and finished in 42 minutes) but the
important aspects are in this. The acting is fantastic from everyone,
and the casting is perfect, much like Jaoquin Phoenix in ""Walk The
Line"" no make up (besides the hair) was used and you swear that Kinnear
is actually JFK. I can see why the History Channel did pass on this
series though in the fact that it's not 100% accurate, but this is very
much worth watching. This can easily stand up to (and in my opinion
surpasses) the ""John Adams"" series. Overall, a fantastic award worthy
series. Both for the series and the acting. Biggest problem with awards
will be who to give supporting award to...Pepper or Wilkinson. Watch

4499348,4,B004YDSNMQ,"A somewhat superficial but entertaining focus of the Kennedy family and their rise to power with the early focuses being on Joe Kennedy (played brilliantly by Tom Wilkinson) and later on JFK (Greg Kinnear really gets the mannerisms down of the original JFK). Many of the high points of JFK's Presidency are covered and every scandal or dark secret connected to the family seems to be covered (i.e. JFK's sleeping around, Marilyn Monroe's suicide being because of JFK, Frank Sinatra and the mob, etc). Kennedy fans may consider those focuses a ""character assassination"" attempt on the man so be warned. Katie Holmes gets criticized for her role in playing Jackie Kennedy but I felt she did a commendable enough job. Barry Pepper did a lot better than I expected as Robert Kennedy and Diana Hardcastle was a startlingly good Rose Kennedy. In fact, I'd say some of the most interesting scenes were the flashbacks between her and Joe especially when their eldest child was put away into a nunnery and later lobotomized. I would have liked something about Ted Kennedy and some argue the assassination was toned down in the last episode which I partly agree with. Historian David Talbot was used as source material in the making of this miniseries. I would surmise they sometimes get it right but it's a truly rare piece that tries to be historically authentic over emotionally engaging. As of the writing of this review the Emmies have nominated this miniseries for: Outstanding Miniseries, Best Actor in and Outstanding Miniseries or Movie (Greg Kinnear and Barry Pepper) and Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or Movie (Tom Wilkinson).

There has been a lot of commentary before the series was even released related to whether it was accurate etc.  There may or may not have been liberties taken but the spirit of the series is to showcase the Kennedys and the force that drove them to become a major political force in modern American politics.  I don't feel they were portrayed in a negative light; quite the contrary. From the early election years to the Bay of Pigs fiasco, to finally Kennedy's resolve during the Cuban missile crisis, the series kept us on the edge of our seats.",1312156800,7,653,4.425
4499352,4,B004YDSNMQ,"When I first heard about this series, I was excited.  Finally, a well-acted, pull-no-punches, documentary about this family.  Having watched the first three episodes, I have to say it just isn't that great.  Although some things do come out that weren't in the public domain, the production values disappoint at every turn.  The characters seem wooden caricatures of their parts - Greg Kinnear does a decent job portraying JFK, and Katie Holmes does her best with Jackie - they even do an okay job with the accents.  But when it's obvious that Kinnear is sporting a wig that sometimes doesn't want to stay put, the video loses a great deal in credibility.  I have to admit there are times when Kinnear does a star turn with a pose, or gesture, that calls to mind a photograph or video clip the viewer has seen (I shook JFK's hand during his election stopover in Cincinnati many years ago), I put that down to excellent research on somebody's part trying to invest the show with some realism.  We'll watch the rest of the series, and I may update this review after.
- - -
The series picks up in production values and acting in the fourth (and subsequent episodes).  Overall, it's definitely worth watching (although if you can catch it on cable or through NetFlix, so much the better).  The makeup, especially Kinnear's wig, is much, much better as the series develops.  I won't go into as much detail as the other reviews - how many times do you want to read the same things?  Sure, a lot is skipped over, and they could have continued the family story with Ted and Mary Jo Kopechne - in fact, Ted appears nowhere in this series - but we'll possibly watch the series again some time in the future.

4499355,5,B004YDSNMQ,"""The Kennedys"" ranks with the very best miniseries.  It provides a balanced look at the political lives of the Kennedy family, without becoming either a whitewash or a hatchet job.  Jack and Robert Kennedy, and Joe Kennedy, are vividly portrayed as talented and powerful, and yet flawed men.  It is an unforgivable scandal that after The History Channel commissioned this series the Kennedy establishment successfully lobbied it not to air it.  No matter, it is available in other venues including this Amazon DVD and it is not to be missed.

It is obvious that what prompted the Kennedy family enmity towards this series is its frank look at the infidelities of both Jack and Joe Senior.  This is already well established and no longer the secret it was during the Kennedy presidency.  In any case it is one of numerous central themes to what appears to be, in the main, a balanced look at the Kennedy dynasty.

This series takes several interesting positions on issues.  Firstly, it claims that even Joe Kennedy Sr. did not know about the Chicago ballot-box stuffing.  I found this hard to believe; the series blames it on Frank Sinatra and the local mafia crime family who it indicates did this without direct knowledge by Joe, but with the expectation that the Kennedys would be appropriately grateful (which they were not).  There are other positions that it takes as well, which I will eschew mentioning for fear of this review becoming a spoiler.

The series' portrayal of Kennedy during both the Bay of Pigs and the Cuban Missile Crisis rings true.  This is probably one of the more balanced presentations of both crises, and it is arguably the case that Kennedy learned from his mistake in the first to successfully handle the second.

Anyone who is interested in politics or the Kennedys (and who isn't?) will want to own this superb miniseries.  I find myself watching it over and over again.  Highly recommended.  RJB.",1309651200,9,1930,4.835365853658536
4499356,1,B004YDSNMQ,"This series is nothing more than ultra right wing propaganda produced by Republican Americans with an obvious agenda of character assassination and smear. No, there was no such thing as ""Camelot,"" and Yes the Kennedys were not and are not angels. But they did make very important positive policy contributions to American history and they did so at a crucial time. It doesn't need much imagination to recognise what would have happened during the Cuba Missile Crisis if Nixon or Goldwater had been in the White House. Imperfect as they were, the Kennedys learned their political lessons the hardest way possible, changed direction and might well have pointed the USA to a much better future had they survived. The rest of the world would have gained too.

This disgusting, poisonous series is intent on minimising the actual political impact and intentions of the Kennedys by pushing lies and distortions about sex, political machination and character. It is the opening shot of a campaign to once again mislead unaware and naive citizens from the truth as the 50th rememberance of JFK's murder approaches in 2013. Predictably coming up are two movies which allege the assassination was conceived, organised and carried out by the Mafia, the biggest load of tragic nonsense since the Reagan-Bush presidencies.

If you want to know the truth of what the Kennedys faced, how they dealt with it and what their true intentions were you won't find it in this pile of right wing turds. Check out primary sources and the actual record - it's hard work but well worth it; it also readies you for this kind muck.

4499357,5,B004YDSNMQ,"The miniseries is almost a lost art. What passes for it these days is usually too mini and lacking the drama necessary to hold our interest. This one, clocking in at roughly six hours, is both compelling and critical. Smear job? Nonsense. NOTHING in this miniseries is anything we didn't already know about JFK and company. If anything, I have more respect for John, Bobby, and Jackie than I did before. The sheer number of crises that the Kennedy brothers had to navigate during their short tenure is jaw-dropping.

No president since then (including Bush) has had to deal with so many world problems on the scale of the Berlin Wall, the Bay of Pigs (which JFK inherited), Soviet missiles in Cuba, and Southern hostility to equal rights for black Americans. Did JFK always do the right thing at the right time? Of course not. But you come out of the miniseries with renewed appreciation for the job he did under extremely trying circumstances, including his own debilitating health problems. It's a warts-and-all depiction, but a fair one.

The controversy over the miniseries was ridiculous. It says more about the pathetic History Channel and those useless ""historians"" than it does about this fine miniseries. If the remaining Kennedy's had anything to do with the attempted blacklisting of this series, then it only shows how blind they are to the merits of the more interesting members of their own family.

And to the reviewer who complained that Ted Kennedy was absent from the miniseries: that was gift from the film makers to all of us!",1308441600,10,1546,4.848484848484849

I'm remembering how Caroline Kennedy said her mother wept for days and days and days and was inconsolable, and the way it was played by Katie Holmes had none of the depth or passion of the real Jackie.  I felt the characters were cardboard, and even the good performances were not representative of the real family.

The true story of Miss. Kopekne and Chappaquitik (sp) remain untold and the great Ted and his nephews crimes remain  hidden from view. It's a shame as this was a story as much a part of the Kennedys as was the series was.

4499361,3,B004YDSNMQ,"""The Kennedys"" caused a big stir before it was even aired, since the History Channel refused to air it, allegedly because it was a smear job.

Well, it wasn't a smear job, and reportedly the History Channel pulled out because the Kennedys put pressure on them. But it also wasn't the great American epic that you would expect -- its stately beginning and exploration of the world-changing effects of the Kennedy administration are marred by a rushed ending and lackluster direction.

The miniseries follows the Kennedy family as John F. Kennedy (Greg Kinnear) is elected as the President of the United States, with the help of his bombastic father Joe Sr. (Tom Wilkinson) and his devoted brother Bobby (Barry Pepper). But JFK had many obstacles, both personal and professional -- he's crippled by a bad back, his father made many enemies, and his marriage to Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy (Katie Holmes) was troubled.

And over the course of his administration, the Kennedy brothers grapple with Cuba, Russia, riots over civil rights for African-Americans, and chasing down the mob. But there are also many personal crises -- drug use, a baby's death, Joe Sr.'s stroke -- that they struggle to deal with, until the shocking assassinations that destroyed both men.

First off: is ""The Kennedys"" a smear job? Answer: no, it is not. However, it contains a lot of material that the Kennedy family doesn't like to publicize despite its truth: Rosemary Kennedy's lobotomy, the frequent infidelity by Joe Sr. and Jack, the First Family's drug use, and the fact that Joe Sr. wasn't above using crooked associations to get what he wanted.

However, the miniseries is a fair and sympathetic look at the Kennedy clan overall. The first five episodes are slow, stately and careful, outlining some of the major events of the Kennedy administration, and adding in flashbacks to show some of the family's history (such as the death of Joe Jr.). It's actually pretty amusing, although the direction is pretty lackluster, and painfully maudlin during emotional moments.

However, about five episodes in, the producers seemed to suddenly realize, ""Yikes, we have only a few hours to wrap everything up! We'll have to smush everything to make it fit!"" The last few episodes are HORRIBLY rushed -- the Marilyn affair takes up about ten minutes max (with no ""happy birthday"" song), and Bobby's entire presidential campaign is squashed into the final twenty minutes. The poor guy deserved more than that.

As for the actors, they're a mixed bag. Wilkinson and Diana Hardcastle are absolutely pitch-perfect as Joe and Rose Kennedy. Pepper and Kinnear don't look anything like their real-life counterparts, but they both give good performances -- Pepper is particularly good as the devout ""good boy"" who struggles to do the right thing, and he is the saving grace of the last two episodes.

The worst part, hands down? That would be Katie Holmes, who doesn't have the elegance, poise or grace to play Jacqueline Kennedy. And she has only three acting modes: pouty, smiley and blank.

""The Kennedys"" is certainly a miniseries worth watching, especially since it highlights part of the Kennedy family's past that are often left unilluminated. But that doesn't mean it couldn't have used another two episodes and a better Jackie.",1304208000,77,3299,5.038532110091743

4499363,5,B004YDSNMQ,"I met JFK, and Greg Kinnear is absolutely the best JFK ever. It's almost like seeing the original once more. Every mannerism, quirk, attitude, is perfection. Kinnear never slips up, never forgets to look uncomfortable rising from a seated position, due to JFK's very real back problem.

Holmes, while not a perfect Jackie, comes closer than any other actress has ever done.
Pepper is wonderful, and his RFK accent is exact, as are facial expressions and physical attitudes.
Tom Wilkinson as old Joe Kennedy was brilliant, and the unsung actresses who accurately portrayed Ethel Kennedy and Rose Kennedy (Kristin Booth and Diana Hardcastle respectively) were superb. The only flaw I found in casting was the actor who played Frank Sinatra. On the other hand, Charlotte Sullivan as Marilyn Monroe was among the best Marilyns ever.

The controversy preceding airing on Reelz was probably conjured up to excite people into watching rather than take the chance that audiences don't care about the Kennedy Family any more.

Whatever your reasons, get this miniseries above all others. News about the family that was once limited to insiders has finally gone public with this miniseries.

I think it's coming out on DVD May 15th, at least that's what Reelz is saying.

If nothing written here grabs you, how about this: Joel Surnow and Jon Cassar, producers of The Kennedys (and Cassar also directed), also produced 24, script was written by 24's Steve Kronish, and the music for The Kennedys was written by 24's own Sean Callery.

4499366,4,B004YDSNMQ,"When President Kennedy was killed, I was 13 years old. Like most others of my generation, I will never forget that day or where I was when I heard the news. The controversy surrounding his death has fascinated me for years, and I have several books on the subject.
I thoroughly enjoyed this miniseries. The acting was SUPERB! Especially that of Barry Pepper, who, as my daughter said, was 'spot-on'as Bobby Kennedy. The only real negatives I can say about the mini-series are: 1)I wish they had included Teddy Kennedy also. (It was as if he wasn't even a member of the family.) 2)I felt that there was too much crammed into the last episode. The last five years were really sped through. Seems that either Bobby's candidacy should have been left out, or the series should have been lengthened to accomodate more of that time span. 3) In the last episode, you never saw Bobby Kennedy's assassin. I would have preferred if John Kennedy's assassination had also been handled in that way. Like many others, I don't believe the 'lone gunman' theory. I would have preferred to see only the barrel of a gun being fired or simply hearing gunshots and nothing more.
Having stated those negatives, I have to say that, in this reviewer's humble opinion, the series was very well done. Since I was so young at the time when he was president, my knowledge of the details of both the Bay of Pigs invasion and the Cuban Missile Crisis was limited. Although I've read much regarding the assassination over the years, I hadn't dealt on the details of those events. It was good to see them dramatized in such a detailed way.

The series also deserves high recognition even though I read that some dialogue was cut out or changed as to not offend the Kennedy family.  I disagree with this attempt to clean up the act.
