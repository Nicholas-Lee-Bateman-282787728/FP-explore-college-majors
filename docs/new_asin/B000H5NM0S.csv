8136356,5,B000H5NM0S,"Focuses on the eyes, ears,nose and throat. Talk about a lot of info on such few targets. He basically covers all the angles of attack based on the angles of knife fighting. He gives you the best hand techniques to use and how to attack those targets. Simple and direct, as usual Loren W. Christensen does not disappoint. Thank God for people like him who know what they are talking about, give you no nonsense applications and don't hold back on teaching you. You always learn something of value from him, always worth buying his products. I like what he teaches because we are on the same page on combat so his techniques do not clash with mine but compliment them. Even a beginner or non martial artist can effectively learn from his DVD's. Well worth it!!!",1383091200,2,759,4.547445255474453

8136358,5,B000H5NM0S,"I guess one of the many reasons I like the Christensen aproach to the martial arts is his philosophy seems to match mine when it comes to street wise combat.  This DVD is not a sport oriented film, but rather shows that in a street fight, the target areas of the eyes, ears, nose and throat are the best places to strike and press win on the street.  Since I have always taught these same techniques and tactics in my combat Jujitsu and Karate classes, this DVD was a good review on the many ways to approach these target areas in a confrontation.  In conclusion, if you are seeking a no nonsense approach to surviving a street fight, this is a must DVD for you.
