8603070,1,B00E9ZATM6,"I bought this because we taped George and the Christmas Star off TV when I was a kid and we had it on DVD but lost it over the years, so I bought this disc to replace it. It's terrible. The George special looks like a bad bootleg copy. The picture moves rapidly side to side on the screen for the entire time, and the colors are so unsaturated that it's almost black and white. If I hadn't paid just $3 I'd be returning it.",1480377600,,423,3.988235294117647
