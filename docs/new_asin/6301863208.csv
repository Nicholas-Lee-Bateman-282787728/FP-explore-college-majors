372679,5,6301863208,"A taut,exciting 1950 film well cast with Richard Widmark as a public health official trying to track down potential plague carriers before they infect others,grudgingly assisted by Police Captain Paul Douglas. Set against a seedy New Orleans dockland backdrop the pursuit of the possible plague carriers is further complicated by the fact they have killed the original carrier. an illegal immigrant,and are unaware of the danger. The race to track them down before the incubation period is complete, making them deadly in a crowded city, is well handled by director Elia Kazan and leads up to the climax,in the warehouses and on the dockside.

372682,5,6301863208,"Richard Widmark and Jack Palance star in this 1950 gritty thriller directed by Elia Kazan. It offers a bit of a different twist on similar film-noir for the fact that its villain is the Bubonic plague.

The acting performances are top-notch, particularly from newcomer JackPalance, who plays a gangster named ""Blackie."" Adding to the film's emotional level is the beautiful B&W photography lensed on location in New Orleans.

The highlight of this film for me, was the harbor chase scene at the end of the film. It's quite a way to end such a remarkable movie.

372734,5,6301863208,"Bubonic plague in New Orleans -- and as if that isn't enough, Jack Palance is out to get what's owed him.  Richard Widmark plays an Army Medical Officer who has to deal with both of these problems.  This is a fine movie.  The plot is plausible.  Palance -- IN HIS FIRST MOVIE ROLE -- is wonderfully threatening.

And New Orleans should have won Best Supporting Actor for this movie.  And this is gritty, sweaty, back-streets New Orleans in 1950 -- perfectly filmed in B&W.  If you are at all interested in New Orleans, you should see this movie.  There's a scene in which Widmark meets a woman in a caf, to question her.  It's a small place, no more than 8-feet wide, with a long counter.  At one point the camera pans down the length of the counter, showing us one tired, unwashed patron after another -- all obviously locals -- staring at nothing.  This scene alone is worth the price of admission.

Nice interplay between Widmark and his wife (Barbara Bel Geddes).  And Zero Mostel plays a bad guy!

372782,4,6301863208,"Engrossing if not quite top-drawer noir with great New Orleans atmosphere and Cold War subtext. Widmark nicely steps into the role of (flawed) hero after all those loser/sociopath/wise guy turns in films prior. While Widmark does fine work the film belongs to Paul Douglas as a crusty police chief and especially Jack Palance, who snarls, scowls and - sometimes - charms, all the while projecting his quintessentially pure evil, menacing persona. BTW the chemistry between Widmark and Douglas is another plus. Barbara Bel Geddes as the wife is fine with thankless material but alas, to my way of thinking, anyway, domestic and noir just doesn't work and spells instant dullsville. The story might have been shortened by at least ten minutes or so by deleting the domestic scenes. The DVD has commentary by Alan Siler and James Ursini, and do these guys know their noir!
A couple of points: did the idea of bodies being infected, taken over as it were, and the resultant panic, anticipate Invasion of the Body Snatchers of a few years later, a film which also had Red Scare overtones? Also: an interesting anomaly is that for a movie set in New Orleans, filmed on location no less, there are so few players, minor or major, who speak with a Southern accent. The accents are either flat Midwestern (Widmark, Bel Geddes) or big city, vaguely East Coast (Zero Mostel, Paul Douglas).",1418947200,,1378,4.868085106382979

372833,5,6301863208,"This is a very good (not classic) film noir.  Others have gone into much detail about the movie so let me review the item in question the Blu Ray version.

First, the print is wonderful , exactly what us noir fans love, rich blacks and a crisp image with good contrast.
secondly , the bonus features are extensive and push this 3plus star movie up to the 5.  The commentary by Noir experts Ursini and Silver is as all theirs are, truly informative and interesting.  Secondly however Fox has bolstered this release by adding the theatrical trailer ...and the biography documentary on Jack Palance ""From Grit to Grace"" which is a terrific program.  As Blu Rays can hold more information they've also added one of my favorite biography programs ""Richard Widmark Strength of Characters"" to the disc!  Both of the biographies are about 45 minutes (must have been 1 hour programs on TV) and are like the feature 1:33 aspect ratio.

This kind of loading up of extra content should be rewarded and I hope this BR does well so Fox continues to issue classic Noirs on BR and adds the bonus features that make them worth owning.",1396051200,5,1117,4.611111111111111

372871,4,6301863208,"""Panic in the streets"" is a 1950 medical thriller, one of the first of its kind. A man sneaks into the port of New Orleans, gets killed, and then when his body appears in the morgue, they discover he has pneumonic plague. Public health investigators have less than 48 hours to track down everyone who has been in contact with the man, but they have no idea who he is.

Rugged Richard Widmark plays a Public Health officer. Widmark was nominated for an Oscar and winner of a Golden Globe for his debut film (""Kiss of Death"", 1947) and also nominated for an Emmy for ""Vanished"" (1971). Widmark appeared in more than 50 films, initially as a villain but increasing as a hero. He was a staple in Westerns - ""The Last Wagon"" (1956), ""Two Rode Together"" (1961), ""Cheyenne Autumn"" (1964), ""Death of a Gunfighter"" (1969).

Everyman Paul Douglas (1907-59) plays a Police Captain assigned to Widmark. Douglas is probably best known for his role as the baseball manager in ""Angels in the Outfield"" (1951), although I think his TV work in the early 50s best showcases his great acting skills.

Barbara Bel Gedes (1922-2005) plays Widmark's wife. She is best known for her work on the TV series ""Dallas"" (1978 - 91), although her best work was on stage. She made only a dozen films, including ""I Remember Mama"" (1948) and ""Vertigo"" (1958).

Jack Palance (1919-2006) makes his screen debut as a small time hoodlum. Palance is best remembered for his Oscar nominated role as the bad guy in ""Shane"" (1953), his Oscar winning role as the cowboy in ""City Slickers"" (1991), and his Emmy winning performance in ""Requiem for a Heavyweight"" (1957).

Musical comedy legend Zero Mostel (1915-77) appears as Palance's henchman. Mostel's film career was cut short in the 50s when he refused to name names at the HUAC hearings. Because the blacklist wasn't applied to Broadway, he transitioned to the stage where he had a prodigious career (""Fiddler on the Roof"", ""Rhinocerous"" ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum""), returning to film in the late 60s.  Mostel is best remembered for his Golden Globe nominated performance in ""The Producers"" (1968)

Little Tommy Rettig (1941-96) plays Widmark's son. Rettig is best remembered for the TV series ""Lassie"" (1954-7). This was his first film, although he doesn't appear in the credits.

Elia Kazan (1909-2003) directed 21 actors to Oscar nominations and 9 wins. He won two Oscars for directing (""Gentlemen's Agreement"", ""On the Waterfront"") and three Tonys (""JB"", ""Death of a Salesman"", ""All My Sons""). His otherwise distinguished career was spoiled by his role as an informer during the McCarthy era. Nobody likes a rat, on screen or in real life.

FWIW - Kazan has an uncredited role as a mortuary assistant.

Screenwriter Richard Murphy (1912-93) was nominated for two Oscars (""The Desert Rats"", ""Bommerang"") and several WGA awards including this film and ""Cry of the City"".

Variety called it ""an above-average chase meller. Tightly scripted and directed..."" and the Chicago Reader called it the ""best and most neglected of Elia Kazan's early features.""

1950 was a good year for films with Oscars for ""All About Eve"" (Picture, Director, Supporting Actor), ""Cyrano"" (Actor) and ""Born yesterday"" (Actress).  The top grossers included ""Cinderella"", ""King Solomon's Mines"", ""Annie Get Your Gun"" and ""Sunset Boulevard"". Other notable films released in 1950 were -  ""The Asphalt Jungle"", ""Cheaper by the Dozen"", ""The Glass Menagerie"", ""Rashomon"", ""The Third Man"", and ""Twelve O'Clock High"".

If you like films about infectious diseases, here's a few of the best - ""12 Monkeys"" (1995), ""The Andromeda Strain"" (1971), ""Outbreak"" (1995), and ""Contagion"" (2011). Of course, one can also watch the plethora of films based on Richard Matheson's 1954 novel ""I am Legend"" - ""The Last Man on Earth"" (1964), ""The Omega Man"" (1971), ""I am Legend"" (2007), ""I am Omega"" (2007)

""Panic in the Streets"" is often referred to as ""film noir"" which it clearly isn't. But it does have great location shots, good photography, interesting characters, and a fast moving script. The performances are uniformly good, although watching Jack Palance and Zero Mostel in the same scene can be a little off-putting.",1367020800,,4214,5.007153075822604
372872,3,6301863208,"I think the reviewer of 03/15/05 got it quite right: This is a film that is less than the sum of its parts. The cast is great, including Jack Palance in his movie debut. Making use of great locations, the picture boasts some outstanding black-and-white photography. Elia Kazan's direction is top-notch. Ultimately, however, Panic in the Streets is a letdown because there's actually not a lot of serious tension -- and never any panic in anything other than an alleyway, actually. The premise is not bad: A person smuggled into the country turns out to have plague, and he's gunned down over some poker winnings. The authorities  realize that the killer(s) and perhaps others have been exposed and must find those who've been in contact with the victim, including the murderer(s). Military health official Richard Widmark and local policeman Paul Douglas must find ways to cooperate to achieve that goal. Meanwhile, the killer, Jack Palance, gets wind of the government's interest and assumes it's because the victim brought into the country something of great value. These two worlds finally collide in the film's climax. In the end, although it was great to watch Palance, Widmark, Douglas and Zero Mostel and Barbara Bel Geddes as well, the film somehow never ratcheted up the suspense adequately for me. I'd like to give it 3.5 stars, but it'll have to settle for 3.",1363132800,,1370,4.956521739130435

The naval doctor working for the U.S. Public Health Department overseeing the operation is Richard Widmark and Barbara Bel Geddes plays his wife.

372875,4,6301863208,"Panic in the Streets (20th Century Fox, 1950) was director Elia Kazan's sixth film.

A sick man is murdered in New Orleans by some petty thugs for cashing out of a card game. When the body shows up at the morgue Dr. Clint Reed (Richard Widmark) determines it's a case of pneumonic plague. Police Captain Tom Warren (Paul Douglas) is directed to find the killer in forty-eight hours to stem an epidemic. A dragnet ensues and Reed and the police are eventually led to Poldi (Guy Thomajan), Fitch (Zero Mostel), and Blackie (Jack Palance). A chase takes place with Fitch and Blackie taking cover in a dock warehouse. The pair is apprehended and New Orleans is safe from the dreaded plague.

Panic in the Streets is delightful film noir. Kazan often stated it was the first of his films that he actually liked. Filming was done on location in New Orleans using many, many non-actors bringing a powerful sense of authenticity to the movie. Cinematographer, Joseph MacDonald, did some tremendous work on this picture. The cast is fantastic. Widmark's performance is very enjoyable. There are a couple of touching domestic scenes with Barbara Bel Geddes as Reed's wife that present an effective counterbalance to the frenzied manhunt. Kazan was critical of Paul Douglas and I agree the loveable lug is a bit too much. Palance is simply superb in his film debut as the short-fused thug, Blackie, along with Mostel as his cowering yes-man. Dan Riss does a commendable job as the snooping reporter. The viewer even gets to see Kazan in a cameo sweeping the floor. For all you trivia buffs, the little person who appears in a couple of scenes with Blackie is Pat Walshe who played Nikko, the leader of the winged monkeys in The Wizard of Oz.

Kazan reached a level of realism and authenticity in Panic in the Streets lacking in his earlier films.

Hardly any character is empathetic they are just a bunch of mean people that stand around arguing with the police. Jack Palance featured on the cover has a lessor role. The movie moves too fast to give you a chance to get involved. The idea is so single, ""the plague"",  and has little else to support it. Oddly the illness is put on the back burner to the mouthing off of the police and military doctor which is not interesting. I can see that the script had many of the important film elements but it did not jell. This is the type of movie you shut off before you get to the end then you sell or throw away.

Working with Kazan was noir cinematographer Joe MacDonald, who managed to create another masterpiece.  The neon-lit tracking shot down a New Orleans street, as the introductory credits role, is wonderfully done; and that is only the beginning.

The Oscar-winning story involves Lt. Cmdr. Clinton 'Clint' Reed M.D.'s attempts to stop a pneumonic plague from ravaging the United States.  Unfortunately, the plague has been introduced into New Orleans by an illegal immigrant, who was shot dead during a night of gambling.
Reed is called in to help confirm that it is plague, and to suggest ways of dealing with the outbreak.  In this performance, Richard Widmark is able to demonstrate (after being villainous in KISS OF DEATH, THE STREET WITH NO NAME, ROAD HOUSE, and NIGHT AND THE CITY) that he can also be quite forceful, acting in the role of film noir 'hero'.

The great black-and-white cinematography helps put it in the film-noir category.  It looks very good on this DVD.  The angular-faced Palance, listed as ""Walter Jack Palance"" in here, always makes for a good villain and Zero Mostel was an interesting part of his group.

Richard Widmark played an normal intense role, except this time as a good guy, and Barbara Bel Geddes was her normal wholesome character.  Frankly, I prefer Widmark as the crazy-type villain. He spends much of the time in this film as a frustrated doctor, yelling at the cop Paul Douglas. That gets tiresome after awhile.

Shot on location with many non-professional locals in acting roles that required scenes featuring their own occupations, Panic in the Streets, is an intense montage of classic noir images. Darkened alleys, seedy coffee shops, and one night boarding houses add to the realism that the New Orleans docks brings to the film's shadowy cinematography. Kazan uses extended long shots and heightened contrasts of dark and light to amplify scenes that are dominated by hopeless characters trapped in low level crime. Richard Widmark gives a credible performance as the doctor who is trying to alert the city's bureaucracy of an impending pandemic caused by a mysterious drifter who spends a night of card playing with local hustlers headed by Blackie ( Jack Palance). Blackie is a menacing character played to the hilt by Palance. Zero Mostel plays one of Blackie's sycophants who urgently seeks his bosses approval by appeasing his every whim. The final chase scene is shot and edited beautifully.  The liner notes on the DVD  add interesting facts about the making of the film, particularly Widmark's recollection of the ending fight scene.  According to Widmark, Palance substituted a real gun, when a prop rubber gun should have been used. Widmark was hit on the head and was out for 20 minutes. Did he say anything to Palance?

372968,5,6301863208,"This is an very rare avis among the Noir film genre. And in this sense, I would like to mention the famous novel of Albert Camus: ""The plague""; the film obviously recreates with stylized visual refinement a lot of issues related with the pneumonic plague. An unknown immigrant in New Orleans, dies because of it, surrounded by people of the underworld, just when he won $ 190. Blackie (Walter Jack Palance) is the leader of  this outlaw organization, and after killing him in order to recover his lost money, this dead body will be analyzed in the forensic autopsy as the unconscious carrier of this infectious disease.

The smart script suggest us several interesting proposals: Is it recommendable to keep the secret r divulgate it by the press? An abnegate and very, very underpaid medic (Richard Widmark) represents the ethical conscious; to keep the secret , in order to catch the closest persons around this fatal victim.

Elia Kazan introduces in the middle of the movie important reflections about the poor economical conditions and underestimation, in a striking and sharp dialogue with his wife.

On the other hand, we witness the police' s way of thinking respect to the best solution about it; as well as the natural accomplishment between the bureaucratic opinion against the sensate point of view of the doctor in question.

The movie is dark, not only because of the fact was filmed at night almost a ninety five per cent of the running time; but Kazan scraps the dark corners of a beloved city, synonymous of pure diversion and evasion.

Finally you may find important clues the are linked with ""On the waterfront"" ; the use of a fluid camerawork, the incisive dialogues and a sense of fevered rhythm that will lead the viewer in an anguishing and effective climax.

There are many reasons that allow us to affirm this was one of the bleakest and intelligent Noirs ever made - in the great tradition of two other emblematic films ""Pick up on South street"" and ""Kiss me deadly"" - where there is much more to watch and reflect beneath the simple circumstantial anecdote.

373002,4,6301863208,"This review is for the 2005 Twentieth Century Fox DVD.

The movie opens in the French Quarter of New Orleans where a group of four men are having a serious poker game and one of the men, Kochak, who is new in town, claims that he is not feeling well and decides to leave.  The other players object since this guy has won a substantial amount of money and they feel he hasn't given them an adequate opportunity to win their money back.  Kochak then runs off and the remaining three, Blackie (Jack Palance), Ray Fitch (Zero Mostel) and Poldi (Tommy Cook) chase him into a train yard and corner him.  When Kochak tries to fend off these apparent attackers, Blackie shoots him dead and they take his body and dump it in a nearby canal.  After the body is found by the local police, the coroner examines the corpse and discovers that he may have had a serious disease.  To confirm this diagnosis, Dr. Clint Reed (Richard Whitmark) of the U.S. Public Health Service is called in to examine the body and concludes that the victim was ill with the pneumonic plague.  Due to the deadly and contagious nature of this disease, Reed meets with the police and local government to let them know that aggressive action needs to be taken to find out who this victim was, where he came from and who has he been in contact with.  When Fitch and Blackie find out that the police are making a major deal about this person's murder, they conclude that he smuggled something into the country very valuable and they believe that Poldie knows more than he's let on.  This sets up the remainder of the movie involving where Dr. Reed and the police have a 48 hour window to crack the case and stop a city-wide epidemic, while Blackie and Fitch put the squeeze on Poldi since they believe he's double-crossed them.

I really like the way this film started off .  The scenes from the French Quarter with the boogie woogie music playing in a nearby lounge really made a stunning impact on the look and feel of the movie.  But as the movie went on, it seemed too much time was spent on bureaucratic issues between Reed and the police and other officials.  Watching the film, it seemed like mass hysteria could break out at any minute but never did.  Jack Palance was fantastic as the consummate tough guy but he couldn't carry the movie.  The climax seemed very tame which amounted to a very mundane chase.  The film was likable, but not lovable for me.  It's a shame too, since night time in the French Quarter makes the perfect setting for a film noir movie.

The DVD quality was immaculate.  Not only was the picture free of visual defects, there was no observable graininess in the black & white full screen presentation.  The sound was very good too.  There is optional real-time commentary on this DVD by James Ursini and Alain Silver.

373003,5,6301863208,"When authorities in New Orleans discover a murder victim was suffering from `pneumonic plague,' the chase is on.  They have 48 hours to track down and quarantine everyone the victim came in contact with before the press reports the story and create PANIC IN THE STREETS.  The health service man in charge is Naval Lieutenant Commander Dr. Clint Reed (Richard Widmark), who has to join in uneasy alliance with Capt. Tom Warren (Paul Douglas).  Their chase will cause them to cross paths with elements of the criminal underground, including Blackie (Jack Palance) and Raymond Fitch (Zero Mostel.)

 There's an awful lot to like about this Elia Kazan directed thriller, beginning with Joe MacDonald's cinematography.  PANIC IN THE STREET was directed on location, unusual enough for a 1950 Hollywood movie, and some of the night scenes, especially, are breathtaking.  Not many movies from that era give you a sense of being there.  This one does.  There's a ratty and seedy quality, populated with `real' people, that adds immeasurably to the realism.  Also, there's none of the caffeinated, modern, hyper-kinetic editing.  The actors move backward and forward within the frame, resulting in longer takes, a smoother pace, at times heightened tension, and overall a greater documentary feel.

 On the commentary track, film historians James Ursini and Alain Silver mention the `explosive' quality of actors Palance and Mostel.  Widmark could be a pretty pressurized screen presence, too.  When they were allowed to `explode,' the commentators indicate, they could pull a movie down with them.  Widmark was always able to harness the violent side of his character.  Mostel and Palance lacked his discipline, and, as good as they could be, in the hands of a weak director their over-acting could sink a movie.  Kazan reins them in here, for the most part, and there's a serious sense of menace when the movie takes us to their turf.  This was Palance's first movie, and his angular, hissing, reptile of a character is one of the better screen villains of the fifties.

  Although the commentators find left-wing messages buried in the plot - there's a freedom of the press subplot, and Widmark has a `global village' speech to deliver when he's forced to convince city officials that pneumonic plague is more than a local problem - PANIC IN THE STREETS reminded me of those sci-fi paranoia b-film of the 50s.  The ones with the exploding spaceships and 20-foot-tall spiders skittering about Death Valley.  In those the threat was foreign born, literally falling from the skies; here, too, they're of foreign origin, coming from across the sea and slipping in through our ports.  Either way, the politics of the thing doesn't get in the way of the story (Oscar winning screenplay, by the way) of this skillfully crafted movie.  Not to be missed.",1132358400,3,2839,5.03862660944206
373004,4,6301863208,"Elia Kazan's ""Panic in the Streets"" was a good film noir thriller that had potential to be excellent considering the volatile nature of the subject matter.  The movie fell a little short in that it never really built up enough pandemonium which would be expected with a possible outbreak of pneumonic plague.

U.S. Navy doctor and epidemiologist Dr. Clint Reed played by Richard Widmark is called into an autopsy of a gunshot victim in New Orleans.  The victim a foreigner and stowaway aboard a ship that recently docked apparently had been infected with the plague.  He had met up with his cousin Poldi an associate of lethal and domineering hoodlum Blackie played exquisitely by a young and angular Jack Palance.  Palance shot the man known as Kochak after a disagreement at a card game, unwittingly infecting himself and his associates, one of whom being Zero Mostel.

Widmark and Paul Douglas playing police captain Tom Warren desperately search through the streets of New Orleans trying to determine who might have been infected.  Their desire to confine the contagion must be performed within a certain limit limit.  The mayor of New Orleans threatens to release the facts of the until now, unrevealed problem to the press.

Brilliantly shot in and around the harbor areas of New Orleans in glorious black and white, ""Panic in the Streets"" was a good tension packed film that had potential to be great.",1131926400,,1408,4.932203389830509

Through a sequence of events, a plague is unleashed upon the city, Widmark must track down those who have been exposed and quarantine them before it becomes an epidemic.

373008,5,6301863208,"""Panic in the Streets"" is entirely fictional, but adopts some conventions of the docudramas of the late 1940s. Director Elia Kazan filmed on location in the New Orleans wharf district and employed nonprofessional actors in minor roles. This is considered to be a transitional film in Kazan's career, in which he proved that he could tell a story visually, in departure from his earlier more theatrical films. Perhaps Kazan's theatrical background is responsible for the remarkably long takes in ""Panic in the Streets"" in which the camera moves a great distance or characters walk in and out of frame. Cinematographer Joe MacDonald delivers a lot of archetypally film noir night scenes with shiny wet streets. But I found the overall stark tones of the film a little unpleasant. I don't know if that's the film stock or the result of filming outdoors in harsh sunlight. ""Panic in the Streets"" is a solid thriller with terrific character writing and dialogue. Those elements capture the audience's attention on the first viewing. But it's worth a second viewing to look closer at the long takes and use of depth of field in some of those shots.

In New Orleans, an illegal immigrant just off the boat wins $190 in a card game with his cousin and some small time hoods. He riles Blackie (Jack Palance) when he leaves the game early due to illness. Blackie, his sidekick Fitch (Zero Mostel), and the cousin Poldi (Guy Thomajan) pursue the man and kill him to recover the money. When the body is brought into the morgue the next day, it is discovered that the dead man had a lethal, highly infectious disease. Dr. Clinton Reed (Richard Widmark) of the Public Health Department recognizes the contagion as a (fictional) pulmonary form of bubonic plague that is spread by casual contact. Dr. Reed sounds the alarm that the city has 48 hours to find everyone who has been exposed, starting with the man's killers, in order to contain a possible epidemic. A doubtful Police Captain Warren (Paul Douglas) launches an aggressive manhunt to find the the murderers, while Blackie concludes that the man he killed must have been in possession of something valuable in order to merit so much attention.

Dr. Clinton Reed isn't as hard-hitting as Richard Widmark's noir villain roles of the 1940s. But Widmark is very good in the part of this crusading, frustrated family man. The scenes of Reed and his wife (Barbara Bel Geddes) discussing their son's allowance, Clint's receding hairline, family finances, and his frustration are among the most realistic domestic scenes I've ever seen in a film -which doesn't mean that they're dull. Clinton and Nancy Reed speak like real people who know each other well but are frustrated with one another, nonetheless. An even more interesting relationship is that of Reed and Capt. Warren, who pulls no punches in expressing his resentment of Reed's civil service job and suspicions of his self-promoting agenda. There is a distinct personality clash, and the two men trade a lot of insults. Reed's relationships, his righteousness, and his self-pity are more focal and more interesting than pursuit of the criminals, who turn out to be rather clever metaphors for rats. That said, Jack Palance is nothing if not menacing as Blackie.

The DVD (20th Century Fox 2004): Both picture and sound quality are good. Bonus features include a theatrical trailer (2 minutes) and an audio commentary. In the commentary, film noir historians Alain Silver and James Ursini speak predominantly about the film in relation to Elia Kazan's career and the staging in various scenes. Other subjects they address include: story, visual style, themes, and the cast. Subtitles are available for the film in English and Spanish.",1123977600,2,3729,4.982343499197432

373010,4,6301863208,"Love him or hate him (many in Hollywood still do, hate him, that is, based on his cooperating with the HUAC - House Un-American Activities Committee back in the early 50s), Elia Kazan knew how to make damn good films, including such features as A Streetcar Named Desire (1951), On the Waterfront (1954), which won eight Academy Awards, including one for best direction and one for best actor in leading role for Marlon Brando, Splendor in the Grass (1961), and this earlier effort titled Panic in the Streets (1950), which also won an Academy Award in the best writing motion picture story category for Edward and Edna Anhalt.  Starring in the film is Richard Widmark, whom I last saw in the one of the unfunniest comedies I've ever seen in National Lampoon's Movie Madness (1983), so I really relished this opportunity to put that experience in the past as I knew Widmark capable of much better things having seen Pickup on South Street (1953), which I think is one of his best films (I have yet to see them all).  Also appearing is Paul Douglas (It Happens Every Spring), Barbara Bel Geddes (Vertigo), Zero Mostel (The Producers), Guy Thomajan (The Pink Panther), and Jack `Believe it...or not!' Palance (The Professionals, Torture Garden) in what appears to be his first silver screen role, credited as Walter Jack Palance.

The story, which takes place in New Orleans, or New Awlins', if you prefer, begins as a seedy poker game breaks up early due to one of the players feeling all sick like...the others are annoyed, especially Blackie (Palance), as the man was winning, and they believe he's using the old `I'm leaving early because I'm sick, not because I'm winning' ploy to get out of giving them the chance to win back their money, so they follow him because the aforementioned Blackie is an especially poor loser and wants his dough back...to which they end up killing the man and dumping his corpse in the harbor...only thing is, the now deceased was truly sick, suffering a pulmonary form of the bubonic plague aka the black death (you know, that bug that spread across Europe and killed millions?), diagnosed by Lieutenant Commander Dr. Clinton Reed (Widmark) of the U.S. Public Health Service.  He tries to impress upon the local authorities the importance of finding everyone who had contact with the relatively unknown man due to the extremely communicable nature of the pathogen, but police captain Tom Warren (Douglas), whose been assigned to work with Reed, has little faith in finding the killer as there are virtually no clues (the dead man has no ID as he recently arrived by steam shipper and entered the country illegally).  Now Reed and Warren have 48 hours to crack the case, lest the disease take a foothold and spread across the country.

My favorite exchange in the film was between the characters of Reed and Warren, the two civil servants stuck with each other, Reed feeling Warren isn't taking things serious enough, while Warren thinks Reed is over-reacting.

Reed:  You know, my mother always told me if you looked deep enough in anybody, you always find some good, but I don't know.

Warren:  With apologies to your mother, that's the second mistake she made.

This is a really strong film, although I'm not sure if it did too well the time it was released.  The most striking aspect about the movie, in my opinion, is the dark haired Palance who played the role of the lead antagonist Blackie.  He's a truly scary individual, not only because of his lean, almost gaunt, towering physique, but also because quiet nature of his character, sort of a calm exterior barely containing seething cauldron of violence ready to spill over on anyone who goes against him (check out the scene where Blackie dumps the sickly Poldi, mattress and all, over the stairwell)...one really interesting thing, and something I think often tends to screw films up in less capable hands, is the inclusion of so many different facets of a story...the disease, the killer(s), the relationship between Reed and Warren, the relationship between Reed and his wife (played by Bel Geddes), the withholding of information from the public, risking the possibility of full blown outbreak vs. the fear of causing a  panic that drives the killer, who may be infected, out of town, etc.  Yes, there was a whole lot going on (perhaps too much), but it handled well, and with little or no confusion.  One aspect that I really liked was the perception by Blackie that police were putting so much heat out there because he thought they thought the man had smuggled something valuable into the country, something he would be interested in...is it me, or did Zero Mostel play the role of flounder lap dog to Blackie just a little too well?  I mean yeah, I wouldn't want to get on Blackie's bad side being the man's a gorilla that trusts no one, but Mostel seemed a little too comfortable in the role.  All in all I enjoyed this film, and I thought it provided a somewhat different and unique spin on a well-established genre...plus I've always been a fan of Richard Widmark and would strongly recommend two of his other films from the same period in Night and the City (1950), directed by Jules Dassin, and the one I mentioned earlier Pickup on South Street (1953), directed by Samuel Fuller.

The picture on this DVD is presented in original full frame aspect ratio (1.33:1), and looks very sharp and clean.  The audio is available in both Dolby Digital stereo and mono, and comes across very well.  In terms of special features, there's a commentary track by authors and film historians James Ursini and Alain Silver, along with a theatrical trailer and liner notes for the film.  There are also trailer for other 20th Century Fox noir films like Call Northside 777 (1948), House of Bamboo (1955), Laura (1944), and The Street with No Name (1948).

If I learned anything from this film its not to play cards with Jack Palance...he doesn't like to lose...",1123372800,45,5964,4.784810126582278
373011,5,6301863208,"That's what a small-time hood says when he's picked up in the dragnet along with all the rest of the crooks in New Orleans. The cop's response (a pun on the phrase ""constitutional lawyer""?) is ""I think you're a constitutional liar.""

The New Orleans cops are looking for whoever killed a man found floating in the water (he was shot). The coroner determines he was either an ""Armenian, Czech, or mixed-blood."" I wonder how they were able to narrow it down to that group. One of the less scientifically educated cops gets to the point: ""Foreigner, huh?""

One more dead foreigner wouldn't bother the local police so much, let alone Richard Widmark as a Navy officer in the Public Health Service, except that this foreigner brought pneumonic plague with him, and may have given it to anyone he had (probably illegal) contact with. The doctor warns that ""Anyone who leaves here endangers the entire country."" He won't let the police captain tell the local newspapers about the plague outbreak because he's afraid the killers will run if alerted, taking the plague to other parts of the country, where it might be impossible to contain.

The plague was ""obviously smuggled into the country."" It couldn't have originated here. Only the dark and sweaty people who make their living from the port get infected by the killers running from the police. Not one ""white"" American comes down with the plague. Maybe they have a natural immunity inherited from Plymouth Rock.

The public health officer knows how dangerous a threat this is: ""I've seen this disease work. It can spread all over the country.""

The authorities trace the infection to a particular ship whose captain wasn't careful enough about the kind of stowaways he took money from. The crew is ""sure these two men got on in Oran."" It may be coincidence that director Elia Kazan's plague-bearers come from the same seaport Albert Camus set his recent novel The Plague in. Camus's plague represents fascism, but what disease is Kazan (a Greek-Turkish immigrant himself) warning postwar America about?

We're not sure what we should be afraid of exactly, except that foreigners are bringing it.

Watching the Navy doctor (Richard Widmark) arguing with the police captain (Paul Douglas - - one of those actors everybody recognizes but nobody can name) reminds you of Marlon Brando and Karl Malden  in Kazan's movie made four years later, On the Waterfront (1954). The doctor and the cop, like the boxer and the priest, disagree on most things, but ultimately they find out they're on the same side.

On the Waterfront (the story of a reluctant informer against racketeers) was partly a justification of Kazan's testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee, for which many never forgave him (witness the protests when he got an Oscar in 1999). Ironically, Kazan's Panic in the Streets (1950) was one of Zero Mostel's last films before he was blacklisted from movies for refusing to testify against fellow leftists. Mostel started working in films again fifteen years later when he starred in A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (an appropriate title, when you think about it).

If the police captain (himself descended from English-speaking immigrants, we're sure) and the public health officer understood the people they live among better, they would have found the source of the plague sooner. Nobody trusts them enough to tell them what they know. Or, as the captain puts it, ""If I knew what shish-kabob was . . ."" (One of the captain's junior officers tells him what shish-kabob is.) But even in his ignorance, at least the captain understands that he's dealing with people.

You get the impression that to the doctor, sources of infection (whether biological or ideological) are just points on a graph where x meets y. He cares about populations, not people. The doctor takes pleasure in inoculating the captain, but usually leaves the actual treatment of people who've been exposed to the plague to flunkies.

The captain wants to warn the city, so people in ""the community"" - - the people he's responsible for - - can take steps to protect themselves. The doctor says ""We're all in a community. The same one."" (The federal government's perspective is just a mirror image of its Cold War enemy.) The doctor is willing to risk the inhabitants of New Orleans to keep the plague contained. His responsibility isn't to individual citizens, but to the country (or is it just the government?) as a whole. Stalin, still alive when this movie was made, would have understood the doctor's choice. ""One death is a tragedy. A million are a statistic.""",1122854400,3,4619,4.922879177377892

373023,4,6301863208,"Three years before he blasted Elisha Cook Jr. and 41 years before he hitched up with a bunch of city slickers Jack Palance murdered an illegal alien and in doing so caught the bubonic plague.  Now it's up to public heath officer Richard Widmark to catch Palance before the disease spreads.

Set in the seedy area of New Orleans director Elia Kazan takes full advantage of the existing locations filming in an almost documentary style in rundown bars, ports, a huge warehouse and shabby apartments.

I like the movie and was amazed that Palance gave such a remarkable performance in his first movie, but still the pacing was too slow and my mind began to wander a few times.  Great for Widmark and Palance fans but others might find it boring.

373024,5,6301863208,"This is a film noir with a twist.

You still have your bad guys, cops, dames, crimes, shadows, alleys...don't you worry about that.

However, instead of some sort of central crime, this noir follows the breathless search for a plague-infected individual.

Who happens to be a crook.

Even though the search is led by a forthright doctor from the Public Health Department, he's partnered up with a weatherbeaten, bitter cop, leading him through the dark streets of New Orleans. See? In this manner, they incorporate all the elements of a traditional film noir (minus the femme fatale) and expand it with the whole medical-thriller aspect.

The film, directed by Elia Kazan moves along at a brisk pace, and Richard Widmark does stellar work as the doctor. Barbara Bel Geddes is cute-almost-sexy (who knew?) as his wife.

This apparently is Jack Palance's first big movie role. He's an odd-looking character, isn't he? If you stuck a triangle-shaped shower drain in his mouth, he'd look like Darth Vader. Or I guess, technically, Vader's MASK.

Anyways, the movie speeds along, with everybody talking like nobody does is real life, but like everyone does in good film noir. It's all double entendre, knowing winks and dramatic exaggerations and similes. It's terrific...

The cinematography is crisp; the DVD looks great and the audio is fine.

The disc includes a commentary by some historians, and a smattering of trailers.

373025,5,6301863208,"I remember catching this movie on TV about 15 years ago, and I immediately fell in love with it, despite the fact that I wasn't particularly crazy about any of the stars, or even 'film noir'.

This amazing gritty documentary-style film just jells perfectly; the setup of the plague, Richard Widmark and Paul Douglas' dilemma, the sleazy New Orleans waterfront dives and characters.

Director Elia Kazan used real locations and often real local people; some of the cops were New Orleans cops, etc.

I'm so glad that this has finally been released....and hopefully most of you will discover one of the most distinctive films of the late 1940's...right up with there with ""White Heat"".

And....to top it off, the opening theme music by Alfred Newman is, in my mind, one of the amazingly spirited and exiting themes in the history of motion pictures.....",1111276800,10,850,4.923076923076923
373026,4,6301863208,"Dr. Clint Reed (Richard Widmark) and New Orleans Police Captain Tom Warren (Paul Douglas) frantically search for a pair of criminals involved with the murder of a card player who may have been infected with plague by the victim. Reed and Warren have 48 hours to find the criminals before they become infectious and spread plague through the population like a wildfire. Although it doesn't compare to the gorefests that pass for suspense thrillers today. Kazan's eighth film as a director is filled with long takes  influenced by Welles (although far more naturalistic looking without the unusual angles that Gregg Toland used on Welles' masterpiece ""Citizen Kane"") creating as much suspense by letting the action play out as the quick cutting style of Hitchcock and other directors working at the time. Featuring the lovely and underrated Barbara Bel Geddes as Widmark's wife, ""Panic in the Streets"" continues to astound with its suspenseful direction and brutal violence. A young Jack Palance steals the film with his role as ""Blackie"" one of the infected criminals and Zero Mostel appears as the other criminal a year or two before Kazan ratted him out to the House of Un-American Acitivies. A believable, powerful drama that still resonates today because of Kazan's on location shooting and powerful down-to-earth performances. Writer Murphy and Kazan would frequently allow the actors to improvise some of their scenes changing dialogue around to bring a sense of spontaneity. Kazan's film, unlike many of the time, shows interdepartmental conflicts slowing down the hunt for the infected men.

""Panic in the Streets"" looks good in its first presentation on DVD. There's a predictable amount of grain and dirt but, on the whole, there's nothing to panic about. The sound is presented in the original mono mix and an augmented artifical stereo mix as well. The former sounds the best of the two. The sound occasionally comes across as harsh but there's little hiss or other analog problems. Image qualtiy is exceptionally good for the movie and this is a must have for fans of film noir featuring one of Palance's best early performances.

Unfortunately, we don't have any featurettes or documentaries on any of the stars from the film. I seem to recall  A&E Biographies on both Jack Palance and Richard Widmark and am a bit puzzled as to why they weren't licensed for this project. Perhaps it's because this is a lower profile classic film that doesn't have the built in audience of, say, ""Laura"" or ""Letter to Three Wives"". We do get the theatrical trailer for the film as well as four trailers for four other Fox Noir Classics available on DVD.

A great, involving commentary track authors and film historians James Ursini and Alain Silver is a highlight of this release. The authors point out Kazan's more straight forward style relying much more on lighting the actors to maintain the mood of the film. There's also scenes here that are echoed in later Kazan films such as ""On the Waterfront"" and ""A Streetcar Named Desire"".

A sharp, vivid looking transfer for this classic noir is a highlight of ""Panic in the Streets"". It's a pity that there's no background on the production of the movie provided in the form of a featurette or documentary. As it is, though, we get plenty of information from the two film historians and authors on the commentary tracks and their efforts aren't as dry as some commentators.

Now it's a race against time for the police and health officials to find the killers before they become contagious and spread the plague across the entire city.
The idea of an epidemic threatening populations seems increasingly likely in this modern time. The spread of AIDS, Ebola, and the recent West Nile virus seem to flood our television screens every day. However, this film is probably just a disguised red scare allegory. The danger of the spread of disease, the way the police hound and interrogate people for information, all this reminds me of the Cold War paranoia sweeping America at the time of the film's release (1950) and the subsequent witch hunts. Appropriately, the director Elia Kazan would name names of suspected Communists before HUAC two years later. Zero Mostel, who played one of the gangsters and plague carriers, would be blacklisted by the Hollywood studios.
Fortunately, one doesn't have to read deeply into this film as it is first and foremost an exciting and entertaining suspense thriller. It was shot entirely on location in New Orleans in black and white giving it a documentary feel. One can almost feel the sounds, tastes, and smells of New Orleans of the 1950s. Kazan considered it to be his first ""real"" film. One can easily believe it. Before PITS, Kazan had made well acted but stagy dramas. This film truly turned him into a real director, not just a stage director as were his roots. By the time he made ""On the Waterfront"", Kazan had fully mastered the cinematic techniques while still managing to get great performances from his entire cast.

7816250,5,6301863208,"A gripping film noir tale - part mystery, part thriller - with Richard Widmark in his first major heroic role as Lieutenant Commander Clint Reed, a Navy doctor working for the US Public Health Service. Widmark's cool facade gives way and he grows increasingly frenetic as the authorities' search goes on and time runs short, in contrast to his prickly, jaded counterpart from the New Orleans PD (Paul Douglas). ""Panic in the Streets"" also marked the major motion picture debut of Jack Palance in a featured role, showing off his villainous chops as Blackie, the ruthless thug-turned-boss who puts the entire city in peril.

Fox's stable of character actors are a real treasure trove, from petty crooks to ship's cooks to iffy informants to nosy newspapermen, the splash of local color adds depth to the story, and a little humor to a tense plot. Chief among these bit players is Zero Mostel (The Producers, 1967) as Palance's insecure sidekick who practically has to run to keep up with Palance's long, purposeful strides, and is quite literally dragged along in the crime caper.

Postwar New Orleans is another unsung star of this film, as director Elia Kazan shot much of the action on location and the authenticity really shines through - you can almost smell the seedy dockside bars and grubby tenements, in contrast to the newly-cut grass and fresh paint of Widmark's picture-perfect suburban home. His precocious, only-child son and his understanding but careworn wife ( Barbara Bel Giddes, best known as Midge from Vertigo, another understanding but careworn love interest for another obsessive protagonist) must take a backseat to his work during a crisis, but he knows he'll make it up to them, somehow.,,",1506556800,,1714,5.010526315789473
