8135306,4,B000GYI3O0,"i am a recent doctor who throwback...i watched it when i was a kid, but only when my cousin came up for the summers. i don't know what got me going as an adult. i guess i like the intelligence of the sci-fi plot and the fact that each story can stand on it's own. all too often sci-fi is poorly written with flimsy theories and shady science. i thin k i fell in love with the dr. when i solved the cat thing (is he dead/alive). Schroedinger's Cat!! this is a true paracosm that bazzilions of people worked hard to maintain. i understand the littiny of decision makers at the BBC resemble a political election process. this is handled so seriously and delicately and you can tell by the outcome that it is well thought out and most intriguing. i am only through the 1st 3 discs and the sound and graphics are phenominal. i am using an old computer set up with some junk ipad mini speakers. it worked! i sat in my ""tardis"" and held on for a beautiful ride. i had never seen this 9th dr. before. he reminded me of the old testiment Christ. i fell in love with him and am in the process of getting a sim-looking fellow on my ipad (don't ask...some sim/boyfriend game my co-worker wants to hook me up with). i am looking forward to finishing the rest off. dinner will not be served this week!

8135309,4,B000GYI3O0,"This vanilla release concludes the final three episodes of the New Series of Doctor Who. Boom Town is not a fan favorite, but it does have some funny moments. While Bad Wolf and the Parting of the Ways ties the season together, starting by putting the Doctor, Rose and Capt Jack Harkness in Reality Programs in the future. The New Series looks and sounds great. Christopher eccleston makes a great Doctor, and Billie Piper is a surprisingly great fit for his Doc. 'tis a shame Eccly only wanted to do one season.",1167264000,3,512,4.576086956521739
8135310,5,B000GYI3O0,"Dr. Who is Forty (actually he's 900, but like the Doctor, the show had been around in one form or another since 1964). During March and through June the BBC celebrated by bringing the show back to television for its 27th season (or as it is more consistently called: SEASON ONE)in a glossy, fast-paced enough to satisfy contemporary audiences, while still conscious of its roots. This SET contains all 13 season one episodess for the 2005 rebirth of the longest running sci-fi series in TV history. The producers, clearly have a respect and understanding of the UK icon. Obviously, fans, the creators do things with the show we would do ourselves.

Doctor Who has always has a voice defined by the decade each in tune with its era and this holds true to the new Doctor Who. This Doctor is almost child-like in his enthusiasm and wonder. Featuring the Doctor as played by Christopher Eccleston (Shallow Grave, Gone in 60 Seconds), infusing the character with great intensity and humanity, while remaining mysterious and alien, along with his companion Rose played by Billie Piper, growing from an awed slacker to a seasoned space adventurer. However, the format of the show has changed to 45 min. parts, some 2 parters ending with cliffhangers, some without. Like any ""new"" series there are good episodes and not-so-good ones, the upside here is MOST of these are great episodes! The 40 year history of the series isn't squeezed into one pilot, through-out the year we get a trickle of back-story, some old, like his time/space machine looks like a police-call-box, and some new back-story, like the fact that his race, the TIMELORDS have been wiped out in a TIME WAR.

This set includes BOOM TOWN in which the Doctor, Rose, Capt. Jack and Mickey team up to stop Margaret, the sole survivor of the Slitheen family (from World War III and Aliens of London.

This was filmed as a cost-cutting ""bottle episode"" but has some great writing in it, as consequences of the Doctor's actions are explored... what happens after the action, when the Doctor must dirty his hands with the possible execution of a defeated foe.

In the 12th episode, BAD WOLF, the Doctor, Rose and Captain Jack have to fight for their lives on board the Game Station, in the season finale, THE PARTING of the WAYS, Rose Tyler has seen danger and wonders alongside the Doctor, but now their friendship is put to the test and the Doctor says goodbye...sort of. This 2 parter features ""Big Brother,"" & ""Weakest link"" gags as the Doctor becomes a ""flatmate"" and Rose a contestant. Also features the ""Final Battle"" of the ""Time War,"" the return of an old enemy in a battle sequence that couldn't be beat even if Dr. Who goes to the big screen!
