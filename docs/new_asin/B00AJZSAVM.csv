8552860,5,B00AJZSAVM,"I'm trying to collect this series but I'm at a stand still. I have only 2 1/2 seasons. Can some body please help me find the rest of this series because I enjoy watching everything that goes on in the show from hanging out with their friends to family time from transformation and saving the world to shopping. Since I'm unable to watch Nickelodeon, I try to watch online and I'm still having trouble with that so if anybody know where I can buy the Wins Club on DVD please let me know. I have both of the movies and they were great. Since I don't have  Winx Club-The Power of Sirenix yet I still strongly recommend it for all young and old.",1383782400,,641,4.211382113821138
