8089449,5,B000BNTM3C,I have heard this match was great for years. I am not disappointed. The audio and video on the dvd is great. I will be looking to get other dvd.,1290038400,,144,3.8333333333333335
8089450,4,B000BNTM3C,"My daughter is tennis mad and it's not easy to get high quality, ladies' matches to watch (and analyse on DVD). This is a good example of a competetive match and the quality of the production is good. She still prefers to watch the drama of, for example, Federer and Nadal, but this is a good match to watch for aspiring tennis girls and she watches it quite a lot.",1283558400,,365,4.228571428571429
8089451,5,B000BNTM3C,I missed the 2005 Wimbledon Women's Final and was so glad I was able to find a DVD to be able to watch at my leisure.  It was a fantastic experience and I am able to go back and enjoy the event any time of the year.  The DVD was clear and up front; it was like I was sitting on the court side myself.  Great purchase for anyone that is a tennis fan.,1281312000,,349,3.689189189189189
