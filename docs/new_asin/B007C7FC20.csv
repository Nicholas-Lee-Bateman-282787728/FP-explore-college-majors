8514269,4,B007C7FC20,Was originally released on laser disc. This dvd release is the same as the laser disc but not improved for a shaper image. The audio quality is fine. Most of the structures featured are King Ludwig's creations. His most famous castle and Linderhoff his small palace with gorgeous gardens followed by his Turkish bath.  Glad to have a copy.,1380844800,,339,4.745762711864407
