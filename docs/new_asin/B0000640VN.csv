1698992,4,B0000640VN,"A sweet, simple love story with a time travel twist.
Meg Ryan does a serviceable job in this flick, though not nearly as good as some of her other past films like You've Got Mail, Sleepless in Seattle, or I.Q.,  but I'd guess that was more due to the script and direction.
Hugh Jackman was awesome, playing a nobleman from early America. It's a great contrast to the Wolverine role he played in X-men.  While in X-men, he was a somewhat coarse and wild, yet principled ""wildman, "" here he plays a totally genteel, polished gentleman whose straightforward honesty and candor make the girls who meet him just wriggle with romantic ecstasy, while inspiring nobler sentiments in the men.
There's only one short scene where time travel is really batted around. The rest of the film is a fun, not overdone exploration of how a gentleman from the past would respond to our contemporary world. And, without ruining the ending, it makes us nostalgic for the simple courtesies and chivalries of the past. At one point though, when feeling this, I also realized that it left out the harsh realities-- that back in time, there were a good proportion of cretinously sexist, racist, ignorant, wealthy pigs. Jackman is playing an idealized male romantic hero, as one might find in a Harlequin romance.
I also really enjoyed the role played by Liev Schreiber, the besieged (ala One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" by psychiatry discoverer of the time warp which made this story possible.
There are a number of magical moments in the story-- and it's magic which melts the heart and pulls those heartstrings for which we pay the eight bucks to see the movie on the big screen.
This is light fare, and sometimes, the light-fare genre just hits the spot. Great music helps on this soundtrack.
One thing though. His uniform, as shown in the trailer and throughout the film, appears to be mroe fitting to the end of the 1700s, not the 1800s. But they repeatedly say he has traveled from the late 1800s. Then, at one point, they say he's 200 years old, which would match his outfit. It looks like the writers got confused on the script. Oh well. It really doesn't hurt the story an iota.",1008374400,13,2162,4.657068062827225
1698993,3,B0000640VN,"Kate McKay is a successful business executive for a big market research company, her life is turned upside down after meeting Leopold, the Duke of Albany from the 19th century who accidentally followed her ex-boyfriend Stuart back through a time portal.  When sparks fly between these two and love develops, how will they ever make the relationship work?
Kate & Leopold is one of those movie with a very deceiving trailer, the kind that makes the film looks more interesting than it actually is.  Don't get me wrong, it was an ok movie...for the first hour, but somewhere in the middle it took a nose dive.  What ruined the experience for me is towards the end when they start trying to explain the time traveling with all the techno-babble, and it plays about half an hour too long.  The characters are likeable for the most part, Hugh Jackman is especially charming as Leopold, handsome and chivalrous, I really enjoyed his performance.  Meg Ryan on the other hand is boring, her portrayal of Kate is the same as all the other romantic comedy roles she's done in the past (i.e. You've Got Mail, Sleepless In Seattle, When Harry Meet Sally, etc...)  I think it's time for her to start branching out to other genre, she's just not very exciting to watch any more.  Breckin Meyer plays Kate's brother Charlie, an out of work actor, he had all the great lines and funny dialogues in the film; unfortunately Liev Schreiber was quite underused as Stuart, I would've liked to see him more.
Sweet, filled with plot holes, and ultimately forgettable, Kate & Leopold is your standard romance comedy you've probably seen a hundred times before.  I recommend waiting until it comes on video, otherwise catch an early show if you must see it in the theater.",1008374400,6,1746,4.720394736842105
1698994,4,B0000640VN,"This movie borrows very heavily on other movies:  an incredulous Duke Leopold (Hugh Jackman) wandering the streets of New York, like H. G. Wells in 'Time After Time'; or Kate (Meg Ryan) jumping out of a cab and running to meet the man of her dreams, like 'Sleepless in Seattle'; or lovers separated by time like 'Somewhere in Time', etc.  But, despite the thin plot piecing together borrowed scenes, the movie works because of the chemistry between these two superstars (yes, after this movie, Hugh is a superstar) and the fully-realized supporting characters. When I went to a sneak preview and was surrounded by single women, their collective sighs over Leopold's elegant gallantry almost drowned out the sound track.  Not like me and bonny Kate...sigh.  Also, Meg's proclivity for subtle comedy has never been so much in evidence or put to such good use.  For me, the ending came to soon, and sadly without the need of a hanky...for that I blame the director (bad, bad director...no biscuit for you).  So, through no fault of hers, this isn't quite in the same stratosphere as 'Sleepless in Seattle' or 'You Have Mail', but it's close.  Meg is back!",1008288000,5,1152,4.817258883248731

1699067,1,B0000640VN,"A British aristocrat from 1876 time travels to 2001 NYC. An interesting premise, but the movie falls flat thanks to a mediocre script by James Mangold and Steven Rogers. The big problem is that there is no chemistry between Leopold (Hugh Jackman) and Kate (Meg Ryan). They fall in love just because the script requires them to, not because there is any real spark between them. In fact, Kate is shrill and unlikable. It makes no sense that a refined gentleman like Leopold would fall for her. Jackman actually has better chemistry with Breckin Meyer, who plays Charles, Kate's brother. Their friendship is the most interesting thing in the movie, with Leopold teaching Charles how to court a lady. But the worst thing is what the movie tells the female audience. See, Kate is a career driven business woman, so she is told by her boss that she is ""like a man"" and the plot has her unbelievably leave her modern day life as a newly promoted vice president of the company behind to follow Leopold back to 1876. This would be a time where she, as a woman, would be totally stripped of all her rights, including the right to vote. Also disturbing it that it turns out that her ex, Stuart (Liev Schrieber), is actually the great great grandson of Leopold and Kate. So Kate was committing incest with her own grandson for four years. Really distasteful. So despite a charming performance by Jackman, the film is a real disappointment.",1508112000,,1428,4.670634920634921

1699073,4,B0000640VN,"I remember having a good impression the first time that I saw this, there was a science fiction time travel element to it and Hugh Jackmans charm won me over. The second viewing, while okay, wasn't as kind as my memory had previously allowed. Jackman may not have been the biggest star in the movie at the time (that title would go to Meg Ryan) but hes the best. He plays a stifled inventor in the late 19th century, stifled mostly because of his royal lineage and expectations. When he inadvertently comes across a time-travelling fellow (Liev Schreiber) he does what any good bit of royalty wouldnt dohe pursues the traveler himself. And just as inadvertently Jackmans Leopold gets whisked forward in time to the time travelers point of origin in the late 20th/ early 21st century. Thus the stage is set for an fish out of water story where the fish may not know the ways of the pond hes found himself in, but his civility and moral compass and convictions shine brighter than all those around him. And Schreibers ex-girlfriend (Ryan playing Kate with a bit of a used up mean streak) is intrigued by Jackman but believes that hes a loon, an actor too far immersed in his role, but she just cant help fall for him. And he cant help but to encourage her to believe in herself and pursue her dream. And, thus and thus, Kate & Leopold end up in a love story where they both travel back and forth in time to make sure that they keep their connection. Theres some good twists here, and its a refreshing development for the romantic comedy dept.",1503273600,,1540,4.483985765124555

Meg Ryan:  enjoyed her acting in many of her other roles - but not in this film.

1699109,5,B0000640VN,"The Director's Cut is FAR superior to the theatrical version, making the film much more comprehensible.

Kate is a practical, skeptical, unromantic marketing research expert in 2001 NYC. Leopold is an inventor and reluctant aristocrat from 1876 NYC. Stuart is Kate's ex-boyfriend, a visionary physicist who discovers a means of time travel which brings Leopold into Kate's world.

It sounds nuts, or like it will be a snooze. But it's not. At the heart of this movie is the theme of intellectual independence versus dependence. Living by basing one's choices on one's own vision, or basing one's choices on what others think.

As well, the movie is a charming contrast between modern values and 19th-century values.

The performances of the three leads are stellar. Meg Ryan nails her romantically weary modern. Hugh Jackman nails 19th-century integrity. Liev Schreiber nails his bumbling misunderstood genius.

And the script is great.",1496707200,,936,5.297297297297297

Not sure, but I just didn't feel the love the way I did in ""French Kiss"" with Meg Ryan and ""Someone Like You"" with Hugh Jackman. Of course there are others starring these great actors, but I'd recommend both of them instead of ""Kate & Leopold.""",1474761600,,444,4.349397590361446
1700473,1,B0000640VN,"Couldn't get through this movie. Its sole purpose seemed to be pushing an out-dated, cardboard-cutout version of masculine chivalry that's just as bad as the modern corporate sexism it tries to reject. The characters were gendered, stiff, and had no chemistry. I have never disliked Meg Ryan in a film EVER, but the mopey, self-absorbed Kate was extremely irritating, second only to the poor bemused Hugh Jackman, who offered nothing except a pretty face. Ultimately, this movie's message is that any broken woman can fall in love if only you twirl her around and carry her to bed like a manly man. But I suppose this is what happens when you get men to write and direct a romantic comedy... Missing you, Nora Ephron.",1474675200,,717,4.790322580645161

The supporting actors are well cast and add joy and realism to the film. Meg Ryan, however, falls short.  She plays Kate so beautifully. But, her inane  hairstyle is so unattractive is breaks the mood.  Ryan is constantly pushing it out of her face.  It does not suit her cute style, it does not work for a hip professional, nor does it work for her elegant period style. Why is it like this?  It amazes me that this one decision ruined a perfect romance.",1474502400,,577,4.598039215686274

If you are seeking for an exact ""When Harry met Sally"", this is not it. However, it is fun. I found that Hugh did a better job of acting, than Meg. Liev also did a great job. The movie may not have hit so well with me if I was looking for something else. But I watched the movie trailer and found it to be lighthearted and humor, so I gave it a go.

It boggles the mind the producers put such an unappealing woman with a romantic duke & expect us to believe he falls madly in love almost immediately. I'm all for romantic license & fantasy, but Meg Ryan's character is genuinely annoying that really, you just want to kick her in the butt. 2 stars for the men in the movie - love all of them.",1468540800,,467,4.318181818181818

1701489,3,B0000640VN,"Kate and Leopold is moderately entertaining and very self aware that this type of Meg Ryan romantic comedy was beginning to become a cliche that audiences tired of. That lack of conviction in this genre undermines the charm of the film, especially Meg Ryan's role. Hugh Jackman is perfect in the role of the 19th century nobleman who stepped out of the past. Leiv Shreiber plays an annoying character and is grating to watch for most of the film, but  has the most memorable scene near the end when he  explains the time portal that allowed Jackman's character to come from the past.",1468454400,,583,4.650485436893204

Despite numerous repeats of that Brooklyn Bridge story throughout the nation and in relation to my own efforts to locate real property to buy, I found Meg Ryan's movie delightful.

Meg Ryan's character was a little lacking, - it was like every other character Meg Ryan has played. But Leopold (High Jackman) was so fabulous that my wife could overlook the other. Even I enjoyed it a little bit. Funny and sweet.",1462838400,,388,4.8059701492537314
1701844,4,B0000640VN,"First of all, I really liked the premise of the movie because I like stories that have some aspect of time travel or multiple dimensions. Then I liked the performances of a few of the actors in this movie. Hugh Jackman really does steal the spotlight in this movie playing a well-bred, erudite, and charming aristocrat from the late nineteenth century and I liked how genuine his character is. Liev Schrieber, though not seen a whole lot in the film, plays a brilliant yet misunderstood physicist and delivers a rather moving monologue, and I found Breckin Meyer's character, Charlie, surprisingly sweet if not a bit of a comedic relief character. However, while I did like these three actors' performances, my biggest complaint lies with Meg Ryan's character, Kate.

Kate is supposed to be this cutthroat businesswoman in marketing research who isn't good with men (something she actually says in the film) and has grown cynical with the idea of finding the right man. I initially wanted to like her character, but jeez Louise, I ended up really despising her into the middle of the film. She has this shrill, bossy, and overbearing personality to the extreme and spends a good portion of the film being snide. It still boggles me as to how someone like Leopold would fall head over heels for such a harpy. Then she was just droll. Aside from having an amplified and overdone version of the personality type that just about every character Meg Ryan has played over her romcom career, I didn't see much else to her character. On a lesser important note, she was just unpleasant to look at. Her clothing choices were as dull and ugly as her personality and her hairstyle is a warning to us all to never look back at women's hairstyles from the early 2000s--the dreaded choppy, shoulder-length, pin-straight but sticking out in weird places haystack on the head. Overall, it was like looking at a woman who was clearly marching towards her middle age years trying to look and act like a hip, cool twenty-something. When I watched this movie with a friend, she agreed with me that Meg Ryan was better suited to voicing Anastasia in the Don Bluth animated film than this movie, and that Kate's secretary, Darci (Natasha Lyonne), would have made for a more compelling and cute love interest.

The minor issue I had with the movie were the historical inaccuracies, including the costume designs for the party guests in the nineteenth century, and the fact that I could tell that the ladies' gowns had zippers in the back. Other than that, it still didn't make me like this movie any less because I treat it in the same way I would treat a historical romance novel that you would pick up at the grocery store: it's just for fun, and expect potential inaccuracies, but don't try to let them hinder the fun totally.

Long story short: I thought Meg Ryan's character was a cow, but I still liked it for other reasons.",1462665600,,2907,4.707269155206287

1703567,5,B0000640VN,"This is a simple, charming film which brings together two fine actors ..  Meg Plays Kate, a scatter-brained market analyst, living in a bizarre apartment complex between her brother and her former BF.  It's a good ploy to set up how, although her position is quite lucrative, she yearns deep inside for a more relaxed, peaceful environment. Instead, her days are rushed and hectic.  Kate has forgotten how to relax.  The XBF, has somehow managed to find a portal in the space-time continuum, when he succeeds, he finds himself in mid 19th C society.  Wanting to document his success, he takes numerous photos with a tiny, almost invisible techie-created camera. The XBF is trying to blend into the happy event of celebration,  apparently the commemoration of the soon to begin construction which will be called the Brooklyn Bridge. At least, that's what I thought was happening.  The tale continues still photographing as he goes. Too bad for him, but his behavior is finally noticed by none other than Leopold, the 3rd duke of Albany, who seems to be bent on confrontation and explanation.  Spooked, the XBF takes  off, headed for the height of the great tower bridge, where he originally passed through time. He must return to his time, but Duke Leopold is right on his behind.  By sheer chance, and with great imagination, XBF passes through the portal, and as he does so, Duke is rather like a dingleberry, totally dependent upon its host.  Amazed, Duke gets to follow XBF, landing in NYC, present day.  There's much more to the story, but too much time is spent trying to convince Kate of Leopold's true identity.  Used to the silly BS verbally bantered around by Kate's actor-brother, XBF et.al, she is convinced Leopold is a good actor, immersed in his role.  She just won't accept his or anyone's explanation of events.
The film proceeds from this point to rather madcap chases, mini spates of amazement at finding himself in the future, the Duke is in love with the city and it's assorted treasures, happily Kate manages to rescue him a few times.  She finally begins to suspect some truth, but is sceptical to the nth degree.
I found the physical comedy entertaining, the special effects were well done.  Costumes were accurate for the 19th century, and the soundtrack wasn't too intrusive.
IMO, this is a chick flick for certain, but older femme teens may also enjoy it. Except for her silly choppy haircut, Ryan is believable as a skittish Kate. Hugh Jackman is just adorable.  The story is predictable but saucy. Not a lot of profanity, and most of what there was were some point of a time warp indice.
Hinging on proving to Kate for good that her story could indeed have a happy ending, trust is established amid astonished looks of those no longer overly doubtful...expect a pleasant conclusion.  Worth the time, and a few actual LOL moments. Ryan is at her girl next door brightest, and her fellow cast are all just nicely presented.  Fun for an evening of silly romantic films, so don't forget the sacred chocolate and the cheese doodles.  Enjoy!",1451347200,,3063,4.787072243346008

1703598,5,B0000640VN,"I'm married, masculine, and I love this movie!  Leopold sets the standard for how men should behave, treat ladies, and interact with others.  He's refined, courageous, considerate, intelligent, capable.  Meg Ryan does an excellent job representing the modern woman who feels that having a career, living independently, and showing no weakness are required to be respected.  But slowly, over the course of the movie, Leopold is able to show her that she has been neglecting certain needs in her life; companionship, care, chivalry.  In our world where gender differences are becoming more obscure, Kate and Leopold reminds us that the intrinsic chemistry between a real man and woman works so well.  So, men: watch it and take notes!",1450137600,,732,5.161016949152542
1703599,5,B0000640VN,"I can't believe how much I loved this movie! Especially when it was an accidental choice! I meant to click on a movie beside it and accidentally clicked on this one instead. Once it popped up I decided to go ahead and watch it because I have always liked movies that Meg Ryan played in.

Even though I like Meg Ryan there was just a something about her in this movie that was a little off. Not sure of what it was unless it was her looks. Her hair was not the best of styles--reminded me of a shaggy dog for some reason--and she looked even thinner than I remembered her--maybe even anorexic. Even so she still gave a good performance. But it was Hugh Jackman that really made this movie. It was the first time I have ever seen him so I was unfamiliar with him but he was fantastic in the role he played. And he was so handsome too!  He played the part of a duke just with the right tone--he pulled it off so well that he was very believable. I also loved the way he was astonished by the things he saw--things in the future that that he would never have dreamed of.

I have always liked movies and books about time travel so if you like those kind of stories you will love this one too. I will look for more movies with Jackman because I really liked him.",1449792000,,1256,4.118367346938776

Kate's former love interest, Stewart has found a way to get back into the 1870's.  He finds Leopold, a Duke who dabbles in inventions and whose uncle is hosting a large gathering on the day/evening Stewart is present.  The gathering is held for the sole purpose for Leopold to choose a woman to be his bride.  While he may be a Duke from England, his family's money is almost gone.  While he can provide the title an rich American father's seeks for his daughter, the father can provide a dowry which will replenish the wealth to a titled English family.  Leopold feels his title is outdated.  There are the new greats--those who have discovered or invented.  He lists names of greats only to be slapped by his Uncle and to be told that after that night his Uncle will disown him if he doesn't make a good match.  Meeting Stewart though changes everything!  Time travel and exploring how a man of different values behaves in a world of advertising, dating, saving the day is a bit outdated in the 20th Century does not stop Leopold from sticking to his values and the result, well.....

The plot overlooks the fact that Stuart was in fact in an intimate/sexual relationship with his own grand mother Kate.
Whoever wrote the movie script however was not just unaware of the facts that there are people who pay attention to what the characters say.
In the beginning Leopold tells Stuart:
What the hell is an elevator? Where the hell am I?
That is NOT how they spoke English in 19th century.
In commune, Leopold asks JJ what is his favorite opera.
JJ responds la Bohm .... Leopold seems to know the piece and even recites the opening of act1 .... Well, excuse me??? Leopold the duke of Albany from 1856 knows an opera written by Puccini in 1907?

1703801,4,B0000640VN,"Not gonna lie but this happens to be one of my favourite guilt pleasures along with it being one of my favourite movies as well. The story is really contrived yet simple to follow. The film actually starts off in 1876 in New York City and we are introduced to a very young looking Hugh Jackman who plays Leopold,Duke of Albany, who is planning to get married to a rich socialite for his 30th birthday but things take a turn when he ends up following a time traveller named Stuart who is spying on him and Leopold decides to follow him,but when Leopold does try and stop Stuart the two of them end up falling off  the Brooklyn Bridge and both go into the present day  of New York City in 2001,thanks to a portal that is found at the end of the bridge(confusing tell me about it as it is never mentioned how Stuart created it only you see a diagram of the actual portal). From there Leopold struggles with our modern day time and he later meets a cynical businesswoman named Kate McKay(played by Meg Ryan) and later of course,he falls in love with her,but will he go back to his own time frame or will he stay in our modern day world?.  The romance between Hugh Jackman and Meg Ryan is very cute yet kinda forced from time to time as the title says it all,but they had great chemistry in the film. The real reason I like this movie is because of Hugh Jackman. He literally takes this role and kills it,his like a Disney prince for 35 year olds and I have a crush on him since this movie,when I first seen it on TV years ago but luckily I now have it on DVD. So do I like this film,yeah I found it endearing and cute. Overall check it out I loved it. Hugh Jackman you can share me your butter any day oh yeah.

Like I said I loved it as it took me a while to get the jest of it. Also watch out for Sting's song Until at the ending credits. Its a really nice song. If you love Enchanted than check it out or if you are a fan of Meg Ryan or Wolverine himself Hugh Jackman then this is for you. But don't take this movie seriously as its suppose to be a fish out of water romantic comedy.

It's hard for me not to like a romantic comedy with Meg Ryan.  And Hugh Jackman?  One of those actors who very easy on the eyes.  And with Meg Ryan, not bad.  But on the negative side, the premises of the film are far-fetched - it was difficult at times to suspend my belief enough to really get into this. And the chemistry between Ryan and Jackman is not quite the chemistry that appeared to be present with Ryan and some of her prior leading men.  It was hard not to notice that some of the ""work"" done on Ryan's face is not particularly flattering - that makes me sad for her because I am guessing that once done, some of that work cannot be changed.

1704048,2,B0000640VN,"It was OK, but left me feeling rather flat.

I think the biggest problem in this movie is that the female lead is dreadfully miscast.  Meg Ryan is a good actress and I liked her in other things, but I think she had outgrown this type of movie and really shouldn't have been playing this role.  She was at a place in her career when she wanted to do other things and it showed - seemed tired and bored in this movie.  Hugh Jackman was wonderful as the male lead, but there was no chemistry between them.  The notion of them being a pair was actually jarring.

The supporting actors were great, the screenplay was interesting.  I just think the casting of Ryan as Kate ruined what was potentially a very good flick.",1406678400,,713,4.315789473684211

Anyway, this is Hugh Jackman's show and he is amazing here but then again he is swoon-worthy any time he's in period clothing.

Oh and Meg Ryan is in this too...  moving on.

So, I am a bit confused here. When Ryan's character goes back in time to be with Jackman's character at the end... does that mean then that the Schrieber character is related to her somehow. Like she became his great, great aunt or something... because weren't they knocking boots for 4 years prior to the events in the movie.  If so.... Ewwww!  ( ;0",1393632000,,564,4.375

I admit that I am like time-travel movies and this is no exception, except most are science fiction/drama.  It is hard to find movies that the whole family can enjoy (no sexual content or violence).  Even my teenage son (14 yrs old) enjoyed it (he's an action/thriller fan).",1384646400,,389,5.046875

There are a few goofs in the movie, such as the historic dates and who actually invented the elevator, and the possible plot hole that Kate may just be Stuart's great-great grandmother even though they dated during the few years together and may have slept together, but Hugh Jackman's performance definitely sets this amongst his best work of his career, and though it's tricky to see him paired up with someone like Meg Ryan, they still make an exceptional couple.  Most women will thoroughly enjoy it, and some men may find it a charming viewing from a guy's typical flick.  A 4/5 rating is sufficient.",1381968000,,627,4.73394495412844

But it doesn't feel like she's surrendering her freedom or anything sinister like that. She's ditching a really, really crappy job (marketing research designed to figure out ways of selling people more junk), to have a meaningful life (and yes, it's with a gorgeous guy). Also, Hugh Jackman shows that being a Gentleman (with a capital ""G""!!) NEVER goes out of style.",1374278400,,489,4.764705882352941

I am actually not typically a ""Romantic Comedy"" fan however, this film is very fun.  Hugh Jackman is both believable and charming as a 19th century ""man of privilege"" stuck in the future (21st century New York.)  Meg is a hard working career woman who is a romantic at heart, although she has become cynical from being hurt by previous relationships.  (I can definitely relate to her character.)  Liev Shreiber is great as the genius/comic relief for the film.  He is such a good dramatic actor, it is nice to see his comedic side.  Hugh Jackman's character also has some highly comedic moments, and Breckin Meyer is also enjoyable as ""Kate's"" younger brother, the actor.  I love the time travel aspect of it, which is most notably enjoyable during the opening scene, although Jackman's character definitely keeps the ""period"" alive throughout.  Just a fun film.",1373155200,,984,4.879518072289157

The sound quality has been improved and upgraded as well. Most Blu-rays have many more features that can be viewed as well which make for a much fuller movie experience too! Oh and just so you know, even if you don't own a Bluray movie you should go buy an on sale Bluray player. Why? Because a Bluray player scans the disk many more times than just a standard DVD player, that it will even make your older DVD movies look much better.

And, this is yet another Nora Ephron-style women are truly stupid - always infantile, always giving up what little they might have to, like Daisy Mae - GET MAH MAN.  If it is true, and, sadly, it does seem to continue to be the case, that women will give up all just to have a man, then let's stop the pretense now.  It is as tiresome as the infantile portrayals of and by Meg Ryan.  Men continue to have so many more resources than most women, and the worst man can snap his fingers and get a woman.  But enough of that.

Not only are we subjected to the infantile behavior of the heroine, (again, and as with 'You've Got Mail', etc.), blatant historical inacurracies, etc., but we are presented with the ultimate proof of women's willingness to do as she is told, in this case, to, figurately, jump off the Brooklyn Bridge.  But not just to believe her ex-boyfriend and brother, that she'll be okay, but to walk across an openwork steel girder in high-heels to do it.

Get the promotion you've always wanted?  Time to kill yourself, because you've lost your man in the process.  This is no leap of faith - this is suicide.

Kudos, too, to all supporting cast members, although I was dismayed to see Philip Bosco in an almost invisible role; this actor gets out attention no matter what his character, and his invisibility here was unworthy.

It's not good when all any of the females watching this movie can say is how much they wished the movie had been solely about inventors, Leopold, and JJ, with no women involved whatsoever.  Very sad.",1343001600,,1791,4.504643962848297

My first thought after viewing this film is that it's a pretty good one in the Chick Flick genre, without too much junk stuck in to ruin it.  Hugh Jackman is awesome as the 19th century Duke bachelor thrust into the 21st century accidently by a time-travelling scientist.  And Meg Ryan is effective as his modern-day love interest.  My second thought was that this movie is a very mild PG-13.  I.e., I think that even a 12 year old could watch it and not get an unhealthy dose of toxic cultural poison (unlike, say, Morning Glory or Twilght Breaking Wind).  Don't get me wrong, the movie isn't an intellectual masterpiece, but it works. I highly recommend it for a date night, or you could even watch it together with your 12-and-up children.  It's romantic, it's premise is neat, and it has imaginative details (like pictures taken by the Time-Traveller that show a 19th century ball but taken on a modern small color camera!).  It even gives us some life-lessons.  Also makes us think about modern conveniences (like the elevator!)

Jackman is great -- he's consistenly 19th century, but when he realizes that he's been transported in time, he quickly adapts to modern life.  And then he doles out a healthy dose of thoughtful yet pointed criticism of the modern lifestyle.  Meg Ryan's character is very unlikeable at first (purposefully I think), but she warms up quickly, after Jackman chivalrously recovers her stolen laptop using his horsemanship skills.  I also like the character of her brother (Brekin Meyer), who adds a touch of comedic, familial humanity to the cast, and her visionary scientist former boyfriend (Liev Schreiber) who has discovered portals in time and how to get from the present to the past & back again.  All these characters Work in this enjoyable movie!  But the best character is Hugh Jackman's Duke Leopold.

In brief, the scientist has gotten Leopold to the future, Leopold and Kate get entangled in each other emotionally, but then the scientist tries to get him back near the movie's end.  Will Kate accept the scientist's crazy time-portal idea, and go with him?  But don't try to think too hard about the various intellectal problems with the time travel, just pour the wine, pop the popcorn, buy into the silly premise, and enjoy the light yet entertaining romantic plot!",1334707200,,2503,4.877068557919622

1704583,3,B0000640VN,"I'm a Meg Ryan fan so I was disappointed by her performance in this movie.  She's lovely, luminous, but shrill, petulant, rude, stomps around- for me, didn't evince anything that Jackman would admire or find remotely attractive, much less come to love.  I got the feeling that Meg was trying to act as she thinks high-powered female execs do- but if she behaved that way she'd never have gotten past the copy-room (actually, would've been fired).

[SPOILER ALERT] What was that all about, her looking for her little pointy thing?  She's a vice-president but doesn't know the word STYLUS?  Not quite as bad as Goldie Hawn in Bird on a Wire, but let's just say that woman-kind wasn't well-served by Ryan's performance.  What was the director looking at?  There's a scene near the end where Ryan walks up to a front door, and without preamble, says ""You don't seem to understand, I'm trying to blah blah.."" but those are the first words she's said, she hadn't said anything for them TO misunderstand.  No-one noticed this?

I love time travel movies, especially romantic ones, and I do very much like Jackman's performance, dashing and believable, and the central premise, thus, the three stars, and the film is entertaining enough.  But there's so much that's wrong with the script, the direction, the scenes in the hospital detract from the film, for example (who cares?).  Are we not to notice that Meg's dress mysteriously changes (for no particular reason, since it's still not in keeping with the style of the period)?

1704603,3,B0000640VN,"Kate & Leopold

Released Christmas Day 2001, a romantic comedy with some sci-fi elements.  The comedy is not that funny and the scifi elements are full of plot holes.

Sad but interesting premise: A man, Stuart, finds a portal in time and goes back to the 1800s to research the inventor of the elevator, Leopold.  Unfortunately Stuart is not to careful with his mini-camera and is found out.  In being chased by Leopold (to find out who this guy is who's spying on him) they fall into the portal and reappear back in 2001.

Meg Ryan plays the ex-girlfriend of Stuart.  Not only does she flatly refuse to believe anything Stuart says regarding Leopold, but she gives her brother, Charles, a hard time, too when he joins Leopold in a song & dance.  Meg's character is vindictive and not very attractive at the start of the film.

I'm thinking, ""This is a date movie?  Not!""

Leopold (played expertly by Hugh Jackman as a nobleman) has the manners of a 19th century man, stands when the lady stands (Kate shirks this as nonsense) and has some difficulty cutting through frozen TV dinners.

Most of the film has comedy activities as Leo has difficulty dealing with the year 2001 and desires to return to his own century as soon as possible.

In this film, time changes occur slowly.  I never understood this concept.  Things should change all at once (as in Frequency).

Meg's character gets frustrated with what she considers an ""act"" by Leo, ""pretending"" that he is from the 19th century, but he says something that gets her thinking about her next marketing ploy at the job.  With Leo's help, she may be able to make vice president!

Stuart meantime is very worried that to keep Leo in the 21st century will create a time space continuum rift (which is never fully explained).

Interesting scenes:

Kate doesn't get that her boss has other motives when he takes her to dinner and Leo insists on being a Chaperone.  Kate doesn't have a clue and goes out anyway with predictable results.

Leo rides a horse to stop a purse thief.  Mildly interesting.  At this, Kate starts to reconsider that Leo just may be a duke.

Stuart attempts to get on the phone to make sure Leo stays in the apartment, ends up dislodging some guy's air tubes.  Not that funny.

There are several continuity and anachronistic errors.  If the producers had not used the incorrect date of 1876, yet he is at the dedication to the Brooklyn Bridge which was 1893.
Cute if predictable ending!

There are other plot holes:  If his disappearance affected elevators being invented, then why are there still elevator shafts?  And wouldn't buildings be shorter?  And what of the Otis Elevator Company?

Lots of nitpicking, but if you fail to pick the nits, and are a Hugh Jackman or Meg Ryan fan, you should enjoy this on a slow Saturday night for your next rental.

1704631,4,B0000640VN,"Lest you hold that old-fashioned romance is dead and gone, here comes a quality movie to flick your earlobe reprovingly and to gainsay that belief. 2001's KATE & LEOPOLD stars Hugh Jackman at his elegant, charming best and Meg Ryan, appealing as ever and very much in her wheelhouse. And while not quite as classic as Meg's SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE or WHEN HARRY MET SALLY... this torn-out-of-time, fish-out-of-water romantic comedy sparkles with humor, appealing characters, and, yup, romance.

Hugh Jackman plays the robust fictional Leopold, third duke of Albany (as opposed to the sickly real-life Leopold, duke of Albany). In Jackman's hands Leopold isn't some fancy pants twit but rather a suave, well-mannered and stand-up guy. It's April 28, 1876 and Leopold has brought his destitute but noble pedigree to New York, his uncle insisting that he find some rich American heiress to marry. We learn early on that Leo is not only an engineering inventor of sorts but that he's also discontented with his royal lot in life.

Meanwhile, in modern-day New York, Kate (Meg Ryan) on the surface is a successful career woman, doing big things in market research. But her personal life is a mess, Kate having just a month ago broken up with her longtime boyfriend Stuart (Liev Schreiber), a scientific louse obsessed solely with time portals. And who happens to be the great-great grandson of Leopold the third duke of Albany. Past and present get Kevin Baconed when Stuart discovers and uses a time portal to the past, just off the Brooklyn Bridge, and returns with an ancestral passenger accidentally in tow.

Kate and Leopold meet, and it's not pretty, what with the jaded, heartbroken Kate finding Leo in her ex-boyfriend's crib. Then there's how Leo is dressed like Sergeant Pepper. But this is Meg Ryan, whose mutant power is to embody the wistful, starry-eyed heroine in these things, so slowly Leo begins to have an effect. To ratchet the suspense, elevators all over the city begin to malfunction, this being a side effect of Leopold not being in his own time. It makes sense once you realize that in his rightful era, Leopold - who, remember, is an engineer - would go on to invent the lift. And if Leo were not to return to his rightful era, well, cue in the scary repercussions...

Hugh Jackman owns this movie even more so than Meg Ryan. Those who've seen him take on the grim superhero part (snikt!) in the X-Men films may be surprised that Hugh can also play a convincing cultured Englishman. He demonstrates this saving grace, a self-deprecating quality, which keeps him from venturing into snobbyland. So you end up liking him even as he imparts lessons in gentlemanly refinement and etiquette to various contemporary New Yorkers. Hugh's romancing of Meg is fun to watch and the most key element in the film, but, let's face it, the love story is a foregone conclusion. So, really, it's Hugh's reactions to his shocking new environs which particularly caught my interest. Would that we all were as graceful under similarly unfamiliar straits (although, yeah, his royal dudeness does lose it a bit when confounded by the enigmatic toaster).

It's fun watching Leopold interacting with New York's fast-lane living denizens. It's a given that the ladies would be bowled over by his charm and couth and accent. But I was surprised at how well Jackman works with Breckin Meyer, who plays Kate's aimless younger brother. It isn't too long before Breckin's character is looking up to Leo and taking his advice in behavior and in how to woo a chick. Breckin also just gave me a mantra for dealing with stubborn bottles of certain condiments: ""You shake and shake the ketchup bottle; none will come, and then a lot'll.""

Casting aside the trappings of time travel, KATE & LEOPOLD is a throwback, wafting in that whiff of old-fashioned romance. It's just as well that the time portal angle isn't dwelled on for much of the movie (other than in the running Stuart sub-plot), as it probably would've just muddied up the waters. As it is, we get to take in wonderful performances by Meg Ryan, being her sweet self, and Hugh Jackman, terrific as a nobleman out of his time but not out of his element. Hugh's Leopold reminds us that, even in the face of swines and cynicism, there's yet a place for good manners. And that also, back in the day, operas weren't just for sissies.",1236988800,,4372,4.80718085106383

This is not on the level of a Nora Ephron romantic comedy with her trademark witty character development, but it is amusing, sometimes thoughtful, and very romantic.

Meg Ryan and Hugh Jackman are brilliant in this fun time-travel movie. A man comes to the future and meets Ryan. His adventures in the big modern city are really funny and tell a lot about modern society.

The idea of using time travel to tell a story of romance is not new.  But the idea to also show that men, no matter what age, could still be honest, charming and truthful to themselves and others was perfectly displayed by the character of Leopold played by Hugh Jackman.  The only reason I took away a star was Meg Ryan.  I am sorry but all her characters seem alike to me.  I enjoyed the performances of both Breckin Meyer and Liev Schreiber who played important, if not major, characters in the movie and really added to the intelligence of the story.

The extras, such as the commentary of Director James Mangold, the On The Set featurette, and the deleted scenes, are great and really allow you to see how the movie was thought out and crafted.",1172966400,,876,4.246987951807229

Plus, she has a truly awful haircut.

Wow, this movie is fun, funny, interesting, witty and quick.  It is not laugh a minute funny, yet it will make you laugh at loud at times due to Leopold's experience with a city he know so well, New York, but in a time he does not relate to.

This is a renaissance man type movie again.  Yet, there is a renaissance woman type of approach to this as well.  You see, both Kate, played by Meg Ryan, and Leopold, played by Hugh Jackman, have a complete grasp of who they are and where they are coming from.

Jackman really shows his versatility in this movie.  Instead of the tough demeaner you see in some of his other roles, he shows a sense of poise, culture and strength.  He has a lot of charm and you really believe this is the way he is.  Ryan, really plays a great role as an up and coming research executive who is on somewhat of a fast track.  She is so different from the meeker roles she has played at times.  Ryan too shows her versatility as an actor.

Liev Schreiber and Breckin Meyer also play great roles.  Liev is a seemingly unlikely inventor and Breckin Meyer plays Kates brother, actor in training who learns a lot about how to relate to the world from his new friend Leo.

The reason I like old movies so much is that it lets me verify whether I'm watching a good movie.  Sometimes, when a new movie is released, it's hard to tell if it's any good because the publicity about it makes me want to see it, and it's hard to tell in that moment whether it's any good.  Whereas, when the movie is old, if the jokes are bad, and the plot is stupid, it shows.

A lot of people think Kate and Leopold was a cheesy movie, but I liked it for several reasons.  Although Meg Ryan was a disappointment because she played herself, or the same character in You've Got Mail, I thought Hugh Jackman was impressive because he acted differently than Wolverine.  Well of course we all expected him to act differently than Wolverine in Xmen, but sometimes people play themselves and are not able to adapt to new roles very well.

1704687,3,B0000640VN,"Hands down, this romantic comedy is a Hugh Jackman vehicle, as he totally steals the show from Meg Ryan. Jackman plays the role of the Duke of Albany, Leopold Mountbatten, an English nobleman visiting his uncle in New York in 1876. At his uncle's behest, Leopold is to find a rich socialite to marry, so that he may replenish the family's depleted coffers.

While at a ball in his uncle's New York house, awash with rich and eager heiresses, he notices a stranger who had earlier caught his attention. He follows the stranger and finds himself in the year 2001, as he falls through a portal in time. Landing in the apartment of Stuart Besser (Liev Schreiber), the stranger whom he had followed, he soon meets Kate McKay (Meg Ryan), Stuart's former girlfriend of four years and a modern day everywoman. Let the games begin.

What follows is nothing earth shattering. In fact, it is pretty predictable. Leopold and Kate fall in love, though the big question is why, as there is nothing to suggest why they should. Meg Ryan does her usual Meg Ryan thing, though she is starting to get a bit little long in the tooth to be playing the brash, cutesy ingenue. She is, in fact, getting to be quite tiresome in these sorts of roles, as she plays them all exactly the same, making them virtually indistinguishable one from the other. She needs to extend her range, before her adoring public stops adoring her.

Jackman, however, does a star turn with his gently effective and ingratiating portrayal of Leopold. He is simply sensational. Charming, handsome, and warm, with a light British accent that rings true, he is totally believable as a chivalrous gent from another time. Jackman totally upstages Ryan without meaning to do so. It is a good thing that he does. Were he not to have done so, the film would most likely have totally tanked. Clearly, Hugh Jackman is big time, leading man material.

Liev Schreiber is unappealing as the film's erstwhile time traveler and Kate's ex-lover, Stuart Besser, who, it turns out, is the great, great grandson of the Duke. Moreover, it is not believable that Stuart and Kate would ever have dated, much less have been lovers for four years, as there is no chemistry between them. Still, it is more believable than the relationship which blossoms between Leopold and Kate. The happy ending also makes Stuart's and Kate's former relationship somewhat distasteful, if not downright incestuous, in retrospect.

The rest of the supporting cast is fine with an excellent performance by Breckin Meyer in the role of Charlie McKay, Kate's somewhat goofy, but lovable, cute, younger brother. Bradley Whitford of West Wing fame also gives a winning performance as J.J. Camden, Kate's smarmy boss, who ultimately has second thoughts about what constitutes professional behavior and lets the cream rise to the top, so to speak.

1704712,3,B0000640VN,"KATE & LEOPOLD isn't a very original film.  It has a predictable plotline and follows the same ""fish out of water"" routine that countless previous films followed.  Surprisingly, this doesn't work against the film; in fact, it works for it.  It's as if the film realizes that it's not original and it doesn't care - because it's not trying to be.  It's meant to be an enjoyable way to spend roughly two hours of your time, and that's what it is.

The plot involves Stuart (Liev Schreiber), a man from twentieth-century New York, somehow stumbling across a portal that allows him to travel through time (it's never explained just how he discovers this, just one of many large plot holes).  He travels to the early nineteenth-century, where he draws the attention of Leopold (Hugh Jackman), a duke bored with the life of the wealthy.  Leopold chases Stuart, and when Stuart returns to present-day New York, he accidentally brings Leopold with him.  Naturally, Leopold is at first horrified by his surroundings, but he gradually adapts to them while falling in love with Stuart's ex-girlfriend, career woman Kate (Meg Ryan).  Leopold must return to his time in a week; can love overcome the bounds of time?

The script, by Steven Rogers and director James Mangold (GIRL, INTERRUPTED) based on a story by Rogers, is nothing too great.  There's a noticeable lack of originality and an even more noticeable abundance of plot holes.  Mangold is apparently a talented director, but his directing adds little to the film.  So what holds it up?  The cast - in particular, Ryan and Jackman.  At first, casting Hugh Jackman and Meg Ryan as a couple may sound like a ridiculous idea - it certainly did to me - but these talented actors make it work.  Ryan's performance isn't the highlight of her career, but it's definitely fun and likable.  Jackman's performance isn't a knockout either, but his masculine charm and sincerely chivalrous attitude are irresistible nonetheless.  Schreiber, Breckin Meyer, and Natasha Lyonne are great in supporting roles.

Along with the charming performances of the cast, there's some great production design and costumes in the nineteenth-century scenes, as well as a fittingly dreamy song by Sting.  And though that's really all the film has going for it, it's enough.  KATE & LEOPOLD isn't brilliant, it's not even clever, but its charisma and simple romance will be enough for anyone seeking an enjoyable, easy-to-follow rom-com.",1160870400,4,2453,4.9926108374384235

Not that the other major three actors aren't fantastic, they are. Liev Schreiber's comedic timing tickles me to no end, and while Meg Ryan is sometimes typical Meg Ryan (and what's wrong with that?), she also does a great job portraying a jaded, work-wearied career woman who as her character's boss rightly comments ""doesn't do pretty"".

The music is great, the dynamics between the actors are like a dance and the scenes flow. Though the film isn't a musical, I get the impression that it is because it melds so well, especially the juxtaposition between the modern discordant imagry/sounds and the sepia-toned dream world past connected by the story and score.

Charming, handsome, and warm, with a light British accent that rings true, he is totally believable as a chivalrous gent from another time. Jackman totally upstages Ryan without meaning to do so. It is a good thing that he does. Were he not to have done so, the film would most likely have totally tanked. Clearly, Hugh Jackman is big time, leading man material.

Liev Schreiber is unappealing as the film's erstwhile time traveler and Kate's ex-lover, Stuart Besser, who, it turns out, is the great, great grandson of the Duke. Moreover, it is not believable that Stuart and Kate would ever have dated, much less have been lovers for four years, as there is no chemistry between them. Still, it is more believable than the relationship which blossoms between Leopold and Kate. The happy ending also makes Stuart's and Kate's former relationship somewhat distasteful, if not downright incestuous, in retrospect.

The rest of the supporting cast is fine with an excellent performance by Breckin Meyer in the role of Charlie McKay, Kate's somewhat goofy, but lovable, cute, younger brother. Bradley Whitford of West Wing fame also gives a winning performance as J.J. Camden, Kate's smarmy boss, who ultimately has second thoughts about what constitutes professional behavior and lets the cream rise to the top, so to speak.

All in all, this is a moderately entertaining film, all but forgettable, but for the memorable performance of Hugh Jackman.",1148860800,,2973,4.865612648221344

1704719,4,B0000640VN,"The movie Kate and Leopold is a wonderful romantic-comedy with a touch of science fiction. The beginning of the film takes place in New York 1876; Leopold (played by Hugh Jackman) is the Duke of Albany who invented the elevator. Leopold's uncle expects him to choose a wealthy bride before the night ends in order to bring money into the poor family. Leopold sees an unusual man (named Stuart) with a digital camera and follows him to the Brooklyn Bridge, where there is a time portal, which brings Leopold to present day New York.

Stuart (played by Liev Schreiber) found the time portal from 1876 to the twenty-first century and, naturally, Leopold is confused when he sees new technology and peoples' actions. For example, he was fascinated by a stereo and a television, and he was interested and also rather appalled by how busy Americans had become. Americans, it seems, are always running around, and always have somewhere they have to be; Americans are not as relaxed as they were in 1876. Leopold meets Kate McKay (played by Meg Ryan) who is a hard-working woman, who is afraid of love and change; she is lonely and very successful. Leopold is intrigued and fascinated by Kate who is much unlike women in the 1800's. For instance, Kate is a very impressive woman with a great job and she tries to look really tough, when at times, we see through it. Leopold has never felt love before and he believes that ""marriage is the premise of eternal love, as a man of honor, [He] can not promise eternally what [He's] never felt momentarily."" Kate, likewise, is still getting over a previous breakup and believes ""love is a myth"" and ""you can't live a fairy tale.""

While both Hugh Jackman and Meg Ryan bring humor to the film, Brekin Meyer (Charlie, Kate's brother) plays a hilarious actor who has trouble with the ladies.  This can be seen when Charlie talks about himself and tells stupid jokes to impress a woman, but it only makes it worse. With the help of Leopold, Charlie gets the girl and becomes a true gentleman.

I believe this movie did a wonderful job with the changes and developments of the characters. For example, in the beginning of the film, Kate is very uptight, busy, and independent, but as the story progresses, she sees that love is real and she learns to follow her heart. Another example is Leopold, who believes ""love is a leap"" that he is being forced to jump, but then he finds a reason to take the leap himself because he finds a woman he can be happy with.

 The beginning of the film was rather confusing and slow, in that it took a long time to figure out what was even happening. The thought of a time portal off the Brooklyn Bridge was a highly improbable instance that gave the movie a turn for pure silliness than anything else. However, once Kate and Leopold meet, one becomes fixated on the beautiful romantic relationship in which they share. But this movie is not just about the relationship between the two main characters, there are more topics to the story. For example, Kate's brother Charles and his dating life or acting career. Another example is the plot of Kate's possible promotion in her profession. There is also the story of Stuart and his problems while he is in a hospital because they will not sign the release form because they find him crazy. This creates a fun-filled story about different aspects of life and not just romance.

 While the love story is similar to the new film Pride and Prejudice (in that both films have a kind, intelligent, loveable gentleman who falls in love with a more modern woman, who is not like traditional women because she is strong willed), this movie is not just about love and relationships. Kate and Leopold is also about the belief that we do not always have to do what is practical or expected of us, but that we can follow our hearts and choose the seemingly impossible path, which is often the most enjoyable.",1138752000,3,3908,4.61294964028777
1704720,5,B0000640VN,"Time travel has been used so much that I had seen this movie a few times (in the last 24 hours) before I even thought of how often this plot was used in the TV series `Quantum Leap.'  Though the audience might be expected to laugh occasionally, the characters are utterly serious, and the outstanding cast of agile actors have an uncanny ability to match Meg Ryan's zest, and to be on, interesting, and believable as unexpected events, such as elevators disappearing on the day that their inventor falls into the future, crop up.

Though `Kate & Leopold' is obviously a fantasy, with a plot that is basically a *stranger*in*town*comedy set in New York City, it can compete with `Midnight Cowboy' for the number of unusual insights into the nature of modern characters.  People who can enjoy hearing every possible approach to the theme of this story explained will like having a DVD with director James Mangold's comments about how the magic of movie-making works.  I liked how music maintains the dramatic continuity even in the midst of such mind-boggling activities near the end of the movie as intercutting scenes taking place in the same building (now a rented ballroom) on April 28, 1876 and in the year 2000 as a couple who faced modern despicabilities for a few days try to meet again in a time when elevators have not been invented.

James Mangold believes that a comedy should not run longer than two hours, so the theatrical version and a full director's cut both run 118 minutes.  I liked the test screening of a movie in which James Mangold plays a director blasting market research and polling at the beginning of the version that is only available on the DVD.  The commentary places a tremendous emphasis on the theme of the story that this movie is trying to tell.  I watched the deleted scenes before I played all the deleted scenes together with the director's commentary, and the disclaimer on the DVD which explains that James Mangold speaks only for himself is so obvious after awhile that you begin to wonder if anyone could think `Kate & Leopold' might be a better movie if theater audiences had spent a minute listening to the moans of an injured man at the bottom of an elevator shaft.

All of the bonus materials on the DVD sound like effective advertising for the film after you have learned its lessons about promotional activities.  Sting contributed a song after watching a rough cut in 2001, and he must have realized that the theme of the film was stolen from a song, `Time In A Bottle' written by Jim Croce in 1971, which had some lines:

But there never seems to be enough time to do the things you want to do once you find them.

I've been around enough to know that you're the ones I want to go through time with.

Sting starts his song singing about capturing the world in a bottle.  Another verse begins with capturing time in an hourglass.  A clock at the beginning of the movie is striking the hour in 1876, but that hardly seems as close to the theme as Jim Croce's line, ""I'd save every day like a treasure and then again I would spend them with you.""  Only a fantasy world 1876 could be that time, but in `Kate & Leopold,' 1876 is that time.  Giving away the plot here should not be as objectionable as some people suggesting that a fantasy character turning his girlfriend into his great-great-great grandmother violates standards of decency which apply to comedy in a way that is non-ludicrous.",1137542400,4,3439,4.611475409836066

Hugh Jackman did give a fairly decent performance, and definitely carried the film.  However, I believe both stars fell victims to being confined to an underdeveloped script.

1704747,2,B0000640VN,"Or maybe not.

At first, the romantic comedy Kate & Leopold seems like an odd film for James Mangold to direct in between the teenager-in-an-asylum movie Girl, Interrupted and the slasher-horror film Identity. Mangold's other movies (like Cop Land) are more noirish than cute, too.

But Kate & Leopold does have one thing in common with Girl, Interrupted and Identity - - one of the main characters is in a mental institution. Stuart, an inventor and Kate's old boyfriend, is locked up when he says he's discovered a crack in time that permits travel to 1876. Stuart also says the man staying in his apartment is an English duke who came back with him from 1876. Of course Kate and Leopold fall in love.

It's too bad Leopold couldn't have found a way to stay with Kate in the twenty-first century. Kate and Leopold both make a physical leap (off the Brooklyn Bridge, which is just over the time portal Stuart discovered), but Leopold jumps back to a familiar world. Kate gives up her family and her career. Leopold is also an inventor and an educated aristocrat and would have more opportunities in Kate's time than Kate would as a woman in his. (""Research is a fine profession for a woman. Suitable to the feminine mind."")

Many reviewers of this movie have noticed that Kate chooses the traditional role, picking a man over a life. But Leopold is more afraid of the new than Kate, and by going back to 1876 Leopold takes the easy way out. Just like Kate, Leopold's choice limits his possibilities (but not to the same extent as Kate's).

Leopold has already invented the elevator in his own time, inspired by the ""erections"" (I hope Mangold is ashamed of the childish jokes in the first scene) being built in 1876. During his time in the twenty-first century he even invents an improved toaster. For Leopold to go back and miss out on what the new age has to offer is just as cowardly as Kate trying to be the heroine in one of her assistant's romance novels instead of living in the real world.

We don't see much of 1876 society except for a grand ball at Leopold's uncle's mansion, which is good, because the poverty and racism in the time Leopold came from might spoil our fantasy. When a black female New York cop tells Leopold to pick up dog poop, his reaction is respectful, admirable, and completely unbelievable. Leopold accepts the social differences between his time and ours too easily.

The DVD has the original theatrical release and the director's cut. The director's cut makes a few of the time-travel twists more understandable. The director's cut tells us that Leopold is Stuart's ancestor, which is why Leopold has to get back to 1876, otherwise Stuart won't be born. That also makes Stuart, who has just broken up with Kate, someone who (assuming Kate and Leopold live happily ever after) has been sleeping with his great-great-something grandmother. The producers might have thought that was a little too Sophoclean for the theatrical release.

If you want to see a dumb romantic comedy that doesn't leave a taste in your mouth like Farmer's Bounty (the ""raw suet"" margarine Leopold winds up being TV spokesman for), check out Wimbledon or One Fine Day.",1119484800,3,3177,4.711711711711712

Anyone expecting deep exploration of the time-space continuum or an extended ""fish out of water"" story may be disappointed. As other reviewers have noted, this film is a vehicle for Hugh Jackman to shine.  Meg Ryan, I hate to say it, is the movie's only weak link.  Yes, Ryan's character, i.e., a straight-talking 21st century woman in trousers, is much preferred to the dull society ladies in Leopold's 1876, but that is still no reason for him to fall for her. In fact, there is so little chemistry between them that its painful to watch them kiss on screen (the few kisses we do see look like two actors kissing in a movie).

And who cares that Leopold is an expert on opera that had yet to debut (""Penzance"") or even be written (""La Bohme"")? And who cares that the mode of time travel, i.e., jumping through a rift in the fabric of time that exists somewhere between the girders of the Brooklyn Bridge and the East River below, is laughable? I don't. This movie is as charming as Hugh Jackman's character and the story that writer/director James Mangold deftly weaves together.

1704756,3,B0000640VN,"Okay.  We've heard it before.  There are no gentlemen left in the world and chivalry is dead.  Leave it to director James Mangold to create a film that solves the modern female conundrum: rather than proving that chivalry does exist in a modified form, simply yank a proper gentleman from the 19th century and plop him down in the streets of New York.  I have to admit, I went into this film with the lowest expectations.  I wanted to hate it.  I wanted to laugh at its stupidity and cast it aside as a poorly written, female rant about the carelessness of men that failed to take into consideration the negative sides of traditional chivalry and societal roles.

And I did laugh.  But I also found myself entertained.  _Kate and Leopold_ does not descend into a rant, but rather chooses to focus on the humorous clash between the modern world and that of Duke Leopold of Albany (played by Hugh Jackman).  So while it still falls into all of the well-worn ruts of the romantic comedy, finding once again that fated true love is a reality, it escapes these constraints by offering up the hilarious dynamic of Leopold's adjustment to the modern world.  In fact, while many write about Meg Ryan's performance in the film, I feel that she is completely secondary to Leopold's own quest and that she merely provides the background for Jackman's performance.  Jackman steals the movie and one has to wonder how long Meg Ryan can continue to fill these roles.

While the movie does throw some dirt in the face of the feminist movement, I don't think that one should analyze the film that carefully-it is a romantic comedy, let us remember.

The titulary Kate is one of the most regressive film heroines I have seen in recent years.  Her exhaustion with her career and with modern life is a perfect example of what the current crop of feminist backlash thinkers would have you believe about the condition of American women today.  Too bad for them, it's complete bunk.  The idea that a successful, smart woman like Kate would jump back in time to an era where a woman's worth was completely dependent on her husband, and where enfranchisement was decades off, just to have someone make her toast with mascarpone for breakfast is offensive.  And the idea of the modern American man as either a predator or a buffoon (or both, which J.J. is shown to be) is equally offensive.

The movie drags in the middle, but is still a wonderful undertaking.  The film would not have been as good without Liev Schreiber as the brilliant but odd scientist, and Breckin Meyer as Kate's warm-hearted wanna-be actor brother.  Schreiber has some of the best lines in the film.

Hugh Jackman carries the movie single-handedly.  His portrayal of the chivalrous duke will make women sigh and men whip up breakfasts in bed.  Hugh is so dreamy, drop-dead handsome.  The Duke contrasts well with Kate's tough single career woman image.  A message in this film is that modern times are sorely lacking some things from the old days, like slowing down the hectic pace of life, really tasting and enjoying your food, and finding truth and meaning in today's confusing, ad-ridden society.",1097625600,2,1233,5.019704433497537
1704772,4,B0000640VN,"""Kate and Leopold"" is a routine, by-the-numbers, fish-out-of-water romantic comedy. Fans of Robert Altman's ""The Player,"" can easily imagine the ""pitch"" scene where ""Kate and Leopold"" got sold to the studio -- ""It's a romantic comedy involving time travel and a satire on the soulless world of advertising, but it's got a heart -- I see Hugh Jackman and Meg Ryan -- it's ""When Harry Met Sally"" meets ""Time After Time,"" but it's got a heart."" ""Sold!""

 Since there are virtually no surprises in store for the audience, such formulas rely almost exclusively on the talent of the players, and ""K&L"" gives good cast. Meg Ryan (Kate) is Meg Ryan, queen of the romantic comedy (although she almost seems impatient with this movie). Liev Schreiber has some fun Keystone Kop-ish scenes as Kate's ex-boyfriend. Breckin Meyer merrily tags along as Kate's little brother, a struggling actor. And Bradley Whitford hits some good notes as Kate's obnoxious boss.

 But the real star of the flick is Hugh Jackman as Leopold. Living in New York of 1862, Leopold yearns to be a man of accomplishment but is confined by position and (lack of) purse to be a mere gentleman, condemned to marry for money to preserve his family's station. Enviously watching the engineer Washington Roebling brag about his mammoth achievement, building the Brooklyn Bridge (""the greatest erection on the planet!""), Leopold notices Stuart snapping pictures with a small camera. Does the film ask why only Leopold notices a man in 21st century attire using a tiny camera? No -- ""K&L"" uses time travel as a mere excuse to get a love interest to NYC for Meg Ryan and some fish-out-of-water comedy.

 Stuart accidentally brings Leopold back to the modern age and, his use to the plot virtually complete, is sidelined through a hilarious elevator accident. Leopold, left to fend for himself, quickly accepts the fact that he has breached the space-time continuum and becomes part of Kate's life.

 Kate, who naturally can't stand Leopold at first, is a harried advertising executive whose boss (Whitford) wants to seduce even though Kate ""knows women, but is not of them."" Kate's big project is to pitch a horrible butter substitute. And who could possibly be a better pitchman for butter substitutes than a transplant from the 19th century?

 As stated before, the film has no surprises -- you will not be surprised that Leopold chases down a purse snatcher on horseback in Central Park, because anyone from the 19th century must be a master horseman, even if he's a frustrated NYC nobleman with dreams of building an elevator.

 But it is undeniable that Jackman and Ryan have some chemistry, and Jackman imbues Leopold with sufficient gravitas and humor to sustain this silly plot.

 This is not a great romantic comedy, but it is a good one. But while it's fun to see Jackman successfully step outside of his Wolverine/Van Helsing action persona, ""K&L"" also proves that it's about time Meg Ryan left this genre behind.",1090972800,2,2978,4.93
1704773,1,B0000640VN,"Since this was a Meg Ryan movie I was ready to be bored out of my mind and I wasn't disappointed. Meg plays cute and perky Kate, a street smart New York executive. She has everything going for her except one thing-she has lousy luck in men. This is where it gets interesting and I use that term loosely. Her ex-boyfriend who happens to be living right above her discovers a hole in time that will allow him to go back to nineteenth century and he does just that. Complications arise, however, and a Duke of Albany, from 1876, who is incidentally young, handsome and unmarried, accidentally follows him back through time to present time New York. If that sounds stupid, you've heard nothing yet. He gets in all these incidents because obviously he never seen any of the modern technology which I assume filmmakers wanted to be funny but it wasn't. It was boring as hell. I bet you can guess what happens next. Duke meets Kate, they fall in love because he has nice manners, he goes back in time because balance must be preserved, of course Kate follows him into nineteenth century, they get married and live happily ever after. Oh, I forgot to mention number of boring discussions they have about love and all that. Can someone shoot me, please!.",1090108800,6,1245,4.5625

1704775,3,B0000640VN,"While Meg Ryan has contributed some worthy movies to the ""chick flick"" genre, KATE AND LEOPOLD falls woefully short of ""good movie"" status.  While not a complete nadir, KATE AND LEOPOLD serves up yet another formulaic movie that offers no real surprises and makes us wonder why Ryan plays a role in a film as uninspiring as this.  Not that the acting is bad, because it's not.  The real problem is the story itself.
Stuart (Live Scheiber), an inventor and Kate's ex, discovers a time wormhole and travels back to 1876 New York.  Leopold (X Men's Hugh Jackman), who invented elevators, chases him from his uncle's house, where he is to announce his bride to be, back through the wormhole into modern day New York.  Leopold was to marry into money since his family has run short of funds.  The rest of the movie shows Leopold adjusting to the modern world and wooing Kate (Ryan) off her feet.  The first half plays like a natural ""fish out of water"" story.  Stuart conviently has an elevator accident, getting him out of the majority of the movie.  Also making an appearance, Charlie (Breckin Meyer), Kate's brother, spends a lot of time with Leopold, thinking him another actor.  Beware: spoiler ahead.  If you know anything about films, it's obvious how this is going to end, so it's not really a spoiler.  Kate and Leopold go back to 1876 New York to live happily ever after.
The biggest problems I had with this movie was the uneasy mixture of science fiction and romance.  The exact same story could have been told without involving time-travel.  An excellent film in its own right, Splash took the ""fish out of water"" story and succeeded quite admirably.  Here, the science fiction is little more than a gimmick to dress up a rather formulaic story.  The most depressing thing of all, however, is Ryan has proven you can quite successfully have a ""chick flick"" while having an excellent supernatural slant (City of Angels).
KATE AND LEOPOLD gives us a rather unrealistic love story.  KATE AND LEOPOLD is just an elegant man sweeping a boring woman off her feet.  Why Leopold would want Kate, other than she has Meg Ryan's looks, is beyond me.  Another problem with the story, however, is Stuart the inventor.  He is by far the most interesting character, and I kept wishing to see more of him.  Leiv does a wonderful job with the role, and the most interesting sections are the all-too brief scene of him in 1876 New York and again in the psychiatric ward.  The best and most captivating scene deals with Leiv explaining to a nurse that he is not crazy.  I won't ruin it for you if you do decide to see the film, but his explanation is absolutely wonderful, and is easily the highlight of the film.
However, he is taken out most of the movie because of an elevator accident, which makes no sense.  The logic of the movie is since Leopold did not invent the elevator, then all the shafts would be empty.  Well, if there were no elevators to begin with, why would there be shafts?  This is just sloppy writing.  The next time the writers want to do a cross-genre film, I hope they do a much better job than this film.
I give it a low three maybe a high two for a squandered opportunity of making another good cross-genre film like CITY OF ANGELS and involving an unrealistic love story.",1084147200,3,3288,4.566552901023891

1704797,4,B0000640VN,"I didn't catch ""Kate & Leopold"" in theaters, and I missed it when it hit DVD last year. I just never seemed to be in the mood for a frothy Meg Ryan comedy about a New York career woman who, thanks to a ""crack in time,"" falls in love
with a duke from the late 1800s.
  But I recently read Peter Biskind's new book, ""Down and Dirty Pictures,"" an absorbing examination of independent cinema that focuses largely on Miramax, the once-small distribution house that hit a boon in the late '80s with ""sex, lies, and videotape,"" then struck gold with ""The Piano"" and ""Pulp Fiction,"" was bought by Disney and became a big production company with a serious Oscar resume.
  Miramax produced ""Kate & Leopold,"" and one of the more interesting sagas in Biskind's book is how the film (which scored high with test audiences) was inexplicably cut and recut by Miramax's notoriously volatile and ""edit happy"" head, Harvey Weinstein, right up until its release.
  Intrigued, I rented the DVD and was surprised to discover that the disk contains two versions of the film: the shorter version that ran in theaters but also co-writer / director James Mangold's better, slightly more complex original version. Both have commentary by Mangold that explain in detail how the movie was made and how it was eventually unmade.
  None of this would matter at all if both versions stank, of course, but ""Kate & Leopold"" is a surprisingly fun escapist romance. It's lightweight but finds a nice even ratio between fluff and substance. That's largely due to inspired, clever writing (a monologue about dogs' inability to see rainbows
is corny and beautiful and could've come straight out of a Frank Capra movie). The movie's other ace is the always reliable Hugh Jackman as Leopold, a 19th century gentleman who finds himself stuck in modern-day Manhattan; the character and the situation are ridiculous, but Jackman plays it completely straight and with such sincere, kooky dignity that he makes the premise fly.
It's a shame such a nice little movie met with such an unfortunate fate, but had it not  I might never have gotten around to seeing it.",1077840000,4,2118,4.81267217630854

Without all the holes and goofs, 5 stars would be in order and Hugh Jackman would have won his Golden Globe nomination for best actor -- and the film would have been nominated for more Oscars than just music.  ""That I can amuse myself at all is an evolutionary marvel.""  ""And what, pray tell, did The Great Disappointment say?""  ""You're a trip, Lionel.""

1704801,4,B0000640VN,"One more variation on H.G. Wells  Time Machine . The details on this travelling in time are not really important. Let's accept it as possible. But this film is a comedy and it enables a duke, the inventor of lifts, to move from 1876 to 2000. What a surprise ! Leopold is adaptable, like any other human being, and is able to even become a fast success in present day New York, a better success than what he had been in the old New York. He meets with a woman who is also a success in her professional life, advertising, and uses him as a strong asset. The film insists on the differences between the two worlds, particularly at the level of ethics. One world is dominated by honor and honesty, the older one, which is a myth we will accept lightly, though it is totally false. The other world is based on success at any cost or price, even if you need to lie, which is alas a real vision of our modern world that considers pragmatic success as a sign of quality, which it rarely is. Of course this is a comedy and these ideas are largely false, but they produce a funny, at times phony, adventure both for Leopold, the poor misplaced Duke, and Kate, the poor place-looking successful female executive. Many situations reveal both the absurdity and the deep evolution of today's world when compared with an older state of affairs. It is romantic and it has no depth, but it is also entertaining and restful. The rhythm and dramatic events of this time-travelling comedy are a lot less stressful than  Back to the Future , though it is fundamentally the same thing.

Leopold is graceful, polite and well dressed and enters a society that has become too laid back as far as dress and manners are concerned.
This is a very good romantic comedy.  A must see for anyone!
It is definitely a movie that we needed in our time to take us back to a more simpler, slower time.  Everything is so fast paced in today's society, that we do not have time or take time to really enjoy life to its fullest.

The big thing in this picture is Hugh Jackman, he's incredible as Duke Leopold.  If Prince,or in his case Duke Charming ever existed, Jackman's read on Duke Leopold was right on the money.
The really wonderful thing about one of the messages in this movie is that good manners & a man who acts like a real gentleman are really quite sexy.

I disagree with other comments here that the movie is without conflict, and therefore, lacking.  You don't need major conflict in a feel-good movie.  Besides, trying to merge worlds 125 years apart should count as conflict.  Not every movie needs to solve all the world's problems.

I enjoyed how this movie touched on the ""What if"" scenarios of removing people from their place in history without forcing an answer.  It causes you to think.  It also serves as a reminder of what dramatic changes this country has seen over the last 125 years.  Is there another 125 year span in history that has seen as much change?  Stop and think about what life was like before some of the simplest inventions were created.  What if Leopold hadn't been there to invent the elevator?  Eventually someone else would have, sure.  But would it have been as timely, as well designed, as safe or reliable?  What would be different if it had taken 5 more years for someone to come up with the idea?

Of course, this movie isn't setting out to change the world or give lessons in American Civilization and certainly not in science (of any kind).  It's up to us to open ourselves to deeper thoughts.  It's also up to us to allow ourselves to feel happy and to smile.  This movie can be the conduit of both.

Back to basics: Of course, Kate and Leopold are the leads of the show, but Charlie is adorable!  He symbolizes the simplicity of heart that is this movie - and he's hilarious.  The movie WOULD be lacking without him.

As to Kate (Meg Ryan's character), I'm not sure she's supposed to be endearing or that we're supposed to want to be her as others have proposed.  She is a harsh NY City Executive.  And, yes, she is stiff and unapproachable even cold: not the type of character we want to love. (Especially with that hair!) But then we find out why - she herself is out of her ideal environment - she's meant to be in the 1800s.  This is a basic fish-out-of-water story as was mentioned previously... for both Kate and Leopold.

I don't want to make this movie sound any deeper than it really is.  It is a cheesy, extremely predictable, love story - and again, it's not trying solve all the world's problems.  But use a little creativity of your own with it.  Movies shouldn't have to spell it all out for us; and they shouldn't have to be deep, emotional dramas to make us think.  Sometimes, they are light-hearted, predictable, moderately funny, sappy love stories.",1057795200,7,2564,4.525054466230936

1704821,4,B0000640VN,"I watched the Director's Cut version of the film on DVD and never saw this in the theater, so I'm not sure how many changes there were between the two versions.  The major change, I believe is the relationship between Hugh Jackman's character and Liev Schrieber.  In the Director's cut, Leopold (Jackman) is the ancestor of Stuart (Schrieber).  In the theatrical release, there is no mention of this relationship.  This changes the dynamic of the film in that Stuart wouldn't have nearly as much motivation in his actions as he does in the director's cut.  I'm getting ahead of myself, though.
Once more, I must mention that this review is for the Director's Cut of Kate and Leopold.  The movie opens in the 1800's.  A bridge is just being built (I believe the Brooklyn Bridge, but I don't believe it is ever said).  Leopold is at the dedication ceremony.  He notices a man snickering behind him and turns to look.  He sees this man (turns out to be Stuart) take a picture with a tiny (and I do mean tiny) camera.  This is out of place and Stuart takes off running.  Leopold gives chase but is unable to catch him.  Next we see Leopold at home, at a party, and he sees Stuart one more time and he gives chase again.  This time he catches up to Stuart but they both fall from a bridge.  Flash forward to our time and Kate (Meg Ryan) appears.  She lives one floor below her ex-boyfriend, Stuart.  Stuart calls her and says that he has actually traveled through time but accidentally brought back his great grandfather.
Still angry at her ex, Kate does not believe his story nor does she believe that Leopold is really from 1867.  However, because of the close proximity of their apartments, and Stuart's later accident, Kate and Leopold interact more and more often and become friends.  Boy meets girl, you know the story.  It is a simple story and the time travel isn't nearly as important as you might think.  Yes, it plays a major role, but it really is nothing more than a device.  This is a romantic comedy and time travel is only there so two people can meet.  It brings a different twist to the film, but make no mistake, the emphasis is on the romance between Kate and Leopold, two people from very different worlds and social classes.  The film is ultimately about ""meant to be"", just like any other romantic comedy.
The movie was nothing special, but is lighthearted and enjoyable.  While you may forget what you watched a few days later, this was an enjoyable and fun little movie.",1052697600,4,2490,4.5291479820627805
1704822,3,B0000640VN,"Meg Ryan is not the pretty young little blondie girl she used to be in movies like ""Sleepless in Seattle"" and ""French kiss"" anymore. Not at all. Now past forty, it's a mistake to go after parts that used to be perfect for her up to five years ago. I mean, in ""Kate & Leopold"", Meg's age shows in her face. I liked her a lot in previous light comedies as the ones above and other like ""Joe versus the volcano"" and, most of all, ""When Harry met Sally"", but this (""Kate & Leopold"") is too much. And that's just the first annoying thing on the movie.
I can put up with a script that deals with things like traveling in time (example: ""Back to the future"" is one of my favorite movies), and a XIXth century guy trying to live a week in 2001 New York: movie scripts are like that, they're meant to be entertaining; even if they are based upon the most preposterous assumptions, if the movie is good, funny, has good actors, whatever, if you really like the movie it usually doesn't matter that much if the script is a little absurd.
What I can't stand, and there is plenty of it in ""Kate & Leopold"", is a script that treats the viewers as dumb people. Anachronisms are ok, even understandable when dealing with movies that deal with past times; script writers aren't supposed to know everything. But in this case, the writers didn't even make the shallowest research. If they wanted Leopold to say things about ""La Boheme"", ""Tosca"", if they wanted him to say things about Jack the Ripper, if they wanted to be smart and base parts of the plot on the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge, why did they make Leopold come from 1876, before all those things happened?
""Kate & Leopold"" would be completely forgotten when you were past the theater's exit doors, except for the fact that Hugh Jackman saves the movie. A very talented actor, Jackman makes you believe he's really from XIXth century, and his old fashioned etiquette lessons provide the story with some very funny situations. Jackman's name should, in the least, appear before Meg Ryan's in the credits, since he's the one actor who carries the movie on his back. Live Shreiber doesn't show himself too much and Breckin Meyer does the only character he knows. So, that's it: ""Kate & Leopold"" is one of those disposable, forgettable comedies that may lighten up a day if you don't pay attention to a bad-written script. I did, that's why only three stars. Anyway, a light entertainment for a normal day.
WARNING: don't watch it with your girlfriend; even if you're the best boyfriend in the world, she will compare your present-day manners to the ""obviously"" better male manners of XIXth century.

1704824,1,B0000640VN,"Well, this was definately a chick flick from beginning to end. You don't really even need to see the movie. You pretty much know the beginning from the end from the title.
A new york woman gets mixed up with a guy from earlier in time. Like 200 years earlier. He doesn't know really what is going on and she thinks he is kinda wierd. He shows some old time shivelry by treating her like a lady and she falls in love.
But it wouldn't be a true love story if there wasn't a fight and separation. So he goes back to his time and then she realizes what she lost, travels back and they live happily ever after.
Same old story, different scenery. If you want to see this movie just rent a film with previews for this show on it. You will see all you need to from that.",1048550400,,762,4.052980132450331
1704835,4,B0000640VN,"Being rather slow on the uptake, I did not see Kate and Leopold in theater and watched it on video for the first time a couple nights ago. I must confess I have never seen Meg Ryan in a film before, nor Liev Schreiber. I absolutely fell in love with Schreiber. His acting is superb. Meg Ryan, however, was disappointing. At times it was painfully honest that she was acting, and she looked bored. Yet another brainless blonde romantic part? However, Hugh Jackman as the Duke, Leopold, did a smashing job and helped change this film from yet another sappy romance into a story full of laughs and love and just a little bit more.
The idea of time travel, though intrical to the plot, wasn't delved into too deeply. Nor in this version of the film (non-bonus) was it revealed that Stuart (Kate's ex-boyfriend) and the Duke were related, thus many of the motivations weren't clearly explained. It would have helped if that bit of the plot had been left in, but still, the pretzel twisted idea of having to go back in time in order to move forward and so on was cute, if a bit hackneyed. As in every good romance, love ultimately triumphs and wedding bells ring.

1704839,2,B0000640VN,"That's what a friend of mine told me after we both finished watching this cute, dumb movie that tries to combine romance and time travel in an effort to say that all modern woman really needs is to be courted or some such nonsense.
Romantic-comedy staple Meg Ryan plays a driven 20th century ad exec, who manages to be successful despite her flaky, Meg Ryan-esque nature and constantly tousled hairdo. I used to like Meg Ryan, back when she did the still-good films ""When Harry Met Sally"" or ""Sleepless in Seattle,"" but now she annoys the heck out of me. It feels like she's phoning in her performance. I wish she'd do a different kind of movie. Though I know she's played against type before, it's never in anything that I've wanted to watch. (The last time I saw her play someone not cutesy was back in ""DOA,"" I think.) She's getting, dare I say it, too old to play this part well. She needs to pass the baton on to the next generation of actresses, like Sandra Bullock (who's starting to do too many of these movies herself). Meg, for the love of God, play some teenager's mother in your next film. Please.
Hugh Jackman's absolutely charming as Leopold, a 19th century New York nobleman about to reluctantly choose his bride when he gets sucked into the 20th Century. He carries the movie, which is otherwise routine and dead-in-the-water when he's not at the center of it.
Breckin Meyer and Liev Schrieber do little with their supporting roles. The entire film is throwaway fluff.",1044316800,5,1484,4.60377358490566

1704841,4,B0000640VN,"All I have to say about ""Kate and Leopold"" is that it is a sweet, romantic movie that undoubtedly falls under the category of ""Chick Flick"". Hugh Jackman's preformance as a 19th century English duke is almost the only thing that makes this movie worth watching. He's handsome, charming, and courteous...everything a woman ever wants in a man. Meg Ryan, however, was grievously mis-cast in her role as modern-day career woman. There wasn't much chemistry between her and Hugh and you can tell she wasn't quite feeling it. But still, the movie isn't a COMPLETE loss. The idea of Hugh Jackman as this gorgeous, perfectly chivalrous duke sweeping you off your feet is enough to merit watching it. The costumes are brilliant and the sets are beautiful. The script was also nicely written, must give props to the filmmakers for that. Overall...the movie has a sweet feel to it and when it's over...it'll make you wish you had someone like Hugh to cuddle up with!",1043020800,,956,4.8
1704842,4,B0000640VN,"This is not my kind of movie.  While I have seen an occasional good chick flick I would not choose them, normally too sappy and light.  I saw this at the theater ( under protest ) and it was sappy and light, filled with plot holes, but mildly amusing.  Don't ask me why I bothered to watch the directors cut on the DVD, I don't know, but I am glad I did.  This is almost a completely different film.  Many of the inconsistencies of character motivation are cleared up, the characters actually deveolop in signifigent ways, and it contines a bit more of the messiness that accompanies real relationships, even if doing so in a fantasy premise.
  For example, in the theatrical release there is no reason for the motivations of Meg's ex.  He is fixated on this guy, then fixated on Meg being with him.  In the theatrical release the only motivation I could ascribe to him was to get rid of the pain in the butt ex-girl freind by hooking her up with someone else and sending her away.  In the directors cut issues of fate, the resiliance of the tapestry of time (if one were to interfear directly in their personal history they would already be a product of that interfearence), and a very very attenuated incest theme that probably is what led to this being cut.  In addiiton, Meg Ryan's character is much more fully realized, rather than a wounded woman on the rebound, she is a deeply cynical, perhaps deeply wounded, woman who reacts to the civility of charm of Jackmon not just as a "" I found someone "" type, but as one who is awakening to the fact that there are good people, idealism and integrity are not lies, and thus sheds her armour of cynasism.
  The addition of these things create drama in what was otherwise poor fluff ( but I must complement all the actors. )
  The most interesting scean, however, was one in which Meg, playing a marketing expert, tells a director that main character in the movie they are screening is unlikeable etc, and she points out that they are killing cinema.  I notice several reviews note this as hypocracy.  Maybe,  I don't know what was in the directors head when he filmed that scean.  However, it also could have been a brilliant backhand slap at the fools that released the theatrical cut, surely based on such focus groups rather than doing it as the director wanted.  They got what they deserved and he has his little laugh.  He clearly demonstrated his point, not by makeing a great film, but makeing one what was solid, interesting and enjoyable that they turned in to schlock.",1042588800,4,2528,4.512087912087912

Hugh Jackman is superb as the fish-out-of-water Duke of Albany who finds himself accidentally in modern-day New York.  Jackman demonstrates great depth and range of emotions, and his exceptional acting truly deserves a better movie than this.  Meg Ryan's character is actually quite unlikeable - I couldn't figure out why Leopold liked her in the first place - and her awful shaggy haircut is very distracting.  Fortunately, the interesting plot, strong acting by Jackman, and comedic talents of Liev Schreiber and Brecken Meyer save this movie from being an otherwise patchy love story and elevate it from being only mildly entertaining to being an enjoyable piece of fantasy.",1042243200,,844,5.323308270676692

Instead of concentrating upon the technicality of bringing people from the past to the future, and vice versa, this movie devoids of the time travel sequence completely.  Perhaps, this would save cost upon the special effects.  Hugh & Meg are likeable characters, and it's hard not to vouch for them to fall in love with one another.  In some ways, this movie is kind of ironic when Meg's character is a researcher, getting feedbacks from the general public to produce movies, ads that the mass public would accept.  This movie is no different from that, stick to the premise of the Prince sweeping the Princess off her feet and living happily ever after.  The gags about Hugh's character getting used to the contemporary setting is funny but forceful.  I'm sure that after a while, it wears thin.  This is not really a bad movie, but it's simply too well-rehearsed and too predictable.  Sting music is worth mentioning too.  Recommended for a rainy day.",1042156800,,1021,4.7175141242937855
1704866,5,B0000640VN,"""Kate and Leopold"" is a marvelous and whimsical romantic comedy blessed with an ensemble of gifted actors who demonstrate a great flair for sophisticated, light comedy.  The story concerns Leopold, Duke of Albany (winningly portrayed by Hugh Jackman) who is transported from the 19th century into the 21st century via a ""portal in time"" discovered by Kate's ex-boyfriend, Stuart (neatly played by Liev Schreiber).
Kate McKay (played by Meg Ryan) is a smart, industrious advertising analyst whose career is on the upswing while her love life takes a dive since breaking up with Stuart.  But her personal life gets a boost when Stuart introduces Leopold to Kate, although it is not love at first sight for Kate.
Kate initially believes that Leopold is a nutcase since he insists that he really is a 19th century Duke.  But Leopold's gallantry and earnestness eventually soften the cynical Kate's heart.  Love and complications ensue.
Hugh Jackman is pitch perfect as the Duke.  Jackman wears nobility effortlessly.  And Meg Ryan is appealing and convincing as a career woman who discovers that there is more to life than work alone.
I must comment on some of the negative remarks made about Meg Ryan by some reviewers here.  While I respect those reviewers' opinions, I wholeheartedly disagree with their displeasure over Miss Ryan.  Meg Ryan is a gifted actress who makes comedy look easy (and it isn't). And she has a pretty face which sometimes produces a goofy, endearing smile.
Meg Ryan cannot help the fact that she is cute, even adorable at times.  It is also not her fault that she has a girlishly youthful demeanor.  Because beneath her lightheartedness, Miss Ryan is able to convey through her expressive eyes a world-weariness and wisdom gained from life's sometimes harsh experiences.  To me, she is totally convincing as an intelligent, ambitious modern woman trying to balance a burgeoning career with a decent social life.
""Kate and Leopold"" is worthwhile because its characters are so likeable and identifiable.  Their longing for love and acceptance is universal.  This movie is a witty and insightful homage to longings fulfilled.",1042156800,5,2146,5.097142857142857

Come on! If that wasn't bad enough, they have Meg Ryan's character falling in love with the 19th century guy (Hey, I'm not giving anything away, this was all in the commercials for the film) just because he opens doors for her.

Of course, it is MY opinion. That's why you should see it. Chances are that you'll agree with me after seeing it. It would be terrible not seeing it after reading one of the one-star ratings. Well, indeed, Meg Ryan gets older. We all do. This makes this movie absolutely not less good!

1704869,3,B0000640VN,"Hands down, this romantic comedy is a Hugh Jackman vehicle, as he totally steals the show from Meg Ryan. Jackman plays the role of the Duke of Albany, Leopold Mountbatten, an English nobleman visiting his uncle in New York in 1876. At his uncle's behest, Leopold is to find a rich socialite to marry, so that he may replenish the family's depleted coffers.
While at a ball in his uncle's New York house, awash with rich and eager heiresses, he notices a stranger who had earlier caught his attention. He follows the stranger and finds himself in the year 2001, as he falls through a portal in time. Landing in the apartment of Stuart Besser (Liev Schreiber), the stranger whom he had followed, he soon meets Kate McKay (Meg Ryan), Stuart's former girlfriend of four years and a modern day everywoman. Let the games begin.
What follows is nothing earth shattering. In fact, it is pretty predictable. Leopold and Kate fall in love, though the big question is why, as there is nothing to suggest why they should. Meg Ryan does her usual Meg Ryan thing, though she is starting to get a bit little long in the tooth to be playing the brash, cutesy ingenue. She is, in fact, getting to be quite tiresome in these sorts of roles, as she plays them all exactly the same, making them virtually indistinguishable one from the other. She needs to extend her range, before her adoring public stops adoring her.
Jackman, however, does a star turn with his gently effective and ingratiating portrayal of Leopold. He is simply sensational. Charming, handsome, and warm, with a light British accent that rings true, he is totally believable as a chivalrous gent from another time. Jackman totally upstages Ryan without meaning to do so. It is a good thing that he does. Were he not to have done so, the film would most likely have totally tanked. Clearly, Hugh Jackman is big time, leading man material.
Liev Schreiber is unappealing as the film's erstwhile time traveler and Kate's ex-lover, Stuart Besser, who, it turns out, is the great, great grandson of the Duke. Moreover, it is  not believable that Stuart and Kate would ever have dated, much less have been lovers for four years, as there is no chemistry between them. Still, it is more believable than the relationship which blossoms between Leopold and Kate. The happy ending also makes Stuart's and Kate's former relationship somewhat distasteful, if not downright incestuous, in retrospect.

The rest of the supporting cast is fine with an excellent performance by Breckin Meyer in the role of Charlie McKay, Kate's somewhat goofy, but lovable, cute, younger brother. Bradley Whitford of West Wing fame also gives a winning performance as J.J. Camden, Kate's smarmy boss, who ultimately has second thoughts about what constitutes professional behavior and lets the cream rise to the top, so to speak.
All in all, this is a moderately entertaining film, all but forgettable, but for the memorable performance of Hugh Jackman.",1041552000,75,2970,4.867588932806324

WITHOUT viewing this first, the edited version makes no sense, and is implausible in every way.  At lease with the directors cut, in FANTASYLAND the plot makes sense.  Without that all crucial mysterious relationship, it does not make sense that Stuart would be so desperate to get Kate to take the jump.  His reasons for doing so are the central reason for the plot, the impetus that everything revolves around, and removing that factor is inexplicable to me...for those of you who have remaining questions upon seeing the theatrical version, viewing the Directors cut will fill in pretty much all of the blanks.  I just can't imagine why they chose to omit them later ... take a look at how many previous reviewers here are so baffled by Stuarts panic throughout the movie ....  total mystery to me why they would leave the whole central plot point out of the final cut.. go figure ..great movie anyway (directors cut version 5 stars, theatrical version zero stars ...",1039392000,2,1327,4.764192139737991

The thing that worked in the movie was the clashing of ways of life. True, the time machine theme has been beaten down inccestantly, but how to fit in? That gives the movie the most hilarious moments and some fine performances by the two leads and all the secondary characters, especially Kate's brother and ex-boyfriend, who give the movie the salt.

I wish that somebody would have informed Ms. Ryan that her hair looked like it was styled a la weedwacker in this movie(it was very distracting)! Don't get me wrong I usually love Meg in romantic comedies and I love Hugh in anything.

How the time travel took place was different but highly questionable, like after jumping off the bridge how do they land in the other time era, on their feet with no impact or in the river, How does Stuart know that when Leopold goes back that he will be repeating the whole day over of when he left, and when Meg's character goes back why does she arrive later that day and just in time?

KATE & LEOPOLD often reminds me of EVER AFTER --only it's a Duke instead of a Prince being forced into a loveless marriage, looking for a woman of intelligence and independence. The Prince finds her among the common people. The Duke finds Kate in the future.

1704932,5,B0000640VN,"Ah! The casting is the thing that makes this delightful romantic comedy work so well! Meg Ryan is at the top of her comedic form as is relative newcomer Hugh Jackman in this tale of star-crossed lovers from different epochs falling deliciously head over heels for each other despite all the differences supposedly separating them. For anyone waxing nostalgic about the lost values and manners from the past, the series of situations and gags involving exactly those characteristics in a wistful recollection of how charming and wonderful such luxuries as manners can be.
Alas, fellow travelers of the time continuum; we happen to live in a time almost totally bereft of any personal knowledge of the human comfort and shelter such social practices can bring to both ourselves and to others, of the ways in which a disciplined code of consideration of others and a corollary code of conduct act to smooth the social waters we must trudge through in our daily quest to make our livings, meaningfully interact with others, and find some semblance of meaning and purpose in so doing. Thus, Jackman's character acts to reaquaint Ryan's with the delicious luxury of time-honored cultural practices and dutiful manners, and she falls as much for the lost treasures of being treated with courtesy and consideration as for the man treating her with such unusual (for our time) deference.
The script is lively and entertaining, and the building of the romance quite believable and engaging, as well. The use of the difference in expectations and the differences in each of the principal's world view for comedic effect is also a lot of fun, and the intelligence and wittiness of the dialogue is unusual, to say the least. This is a well acted and well-thought-out thought piece disguised as a romantic comedy, and it works very well indeed. Two thumbs way up for this one! Enjoy!",1030579200,22,1869,4.936507936507937
1704933,4,B0000640VN,"Kate and Leopold is one of those adult fairy tales set in modern times.  At least partially so!  Director James Mangold chooses to focus not on the story of time travel, as discovered by a
nondescript New Yorker bachelor who travels through a ""portal"" (Liev Schreiber, apt and amiable), but rather on the romantic events of the Duke he brings back with him to the future.
That Duke, Leopold, as played by Hugh Jackman, has traveled some 130 years in time, from late 19th century New York, where he lived as a titled British transplant, searching for love and wealth...and finding neither.  Naturally, in the most serendipitous of ways, he meets Kate (Meg Ryan), a marketing research exec, fiercely career-oriented, but as vulnerable underneath as Meg Ryan was in ""Sleepless in Seattle"" and ""You've Got Mail"".  Unfortunately, her hairdo leaves something to be desired, and her choice in clothing is mannish and severe, but Ryan's charm makes Jackman's crush believable.
Your surprised that Tom Hanks has been supplanted by Hugh Jackman.  Hugh Jackman?  Nah...wasn't he a hairy super-hero in X-Men?  You'd think he was playing against type until you see his performance here.  He's marvelous.  Believable, confident, playing this role as Ben Affleck never could, Jackman gets the largest round of applause for making this movie a commercial and DVD success. He's immersed himself in 19th century manners, etiquette and deportment, but is still vulnerable and kind.  The movie plays for laughs somewhat, on his introduction to timeless Americana such as ketchup, Tater Tots, and scooping up the dog doo after you walk your monster dog in Manhattan.
If the real market research experts are watching, Affleck, etal., may never win another romantic lead again!
So, of course, there is the crisis, the separation, and eventually the film finds a way to end happily.  Bradley Whitford of The West Wing is terrific as JJ, Kate's supercilious and vain boss, and I love Brecklin Meyer as Kate's brother...he's thick enough not to realize that Jackman isn't just acting his historical role, yet bright enough to realize that he has just as much ability to be charming as Leopold, once he figures out how to lose the attitude.

Instead, the 19th-century Leopold (Duke of Albany) has little trouble getting by after his initial confusion; he even helps Kate's brother, the truly hilarious Charlie, pull his social life together, and his 19th century views on life turn out to be astonishingly relevent to 21st-century life.

I went right out and bought the DVD that weekend. I watched the Original version and the Director's Cut. The Director's Cut is definitely better. It adds more history to Kate's character and helps the story flow more smoothly. The character of Leopold, Duke of Albany is excellently played by Hugh Jackman. Meg Ryan was her same cutsy self with a layered mop hairdo. However, this wasn't one of her best movies. Liev Schreiber and Breckin Meyers were also excellent in their roles. Breckin was really funny when his character ""Charlie"" was ""in the zone"" with his favorite girl and his replaying of Leopold's conversation about the Louvre. I think that is when Leopold realizes that he is falling for Kate. I love the scene where Leopold is sitting next to Kate in the restaurant and corrects J.J. on the location of his English home, the opera's characters and his view of J.J.'s trying to seduce Kate. My favorite scenes were Leopold's rescuing of Kate at Central Park; the rooftop dinner and dancing; the following morning when he made breakfast and the dishwasher lesson; the finding of his uncle's house; the evening listening to the soundtrack of ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" and his tucking in and snuggling with Kate. Did you notice when Leopold called Kate ""Your Grace""? I particulary like the part where Kate realized that she really loved Leopold and was willing to take that ""leap of faith"" off the Brooklyn Bridge to be with Leopold, because it meant that she was willing to leave her family and career to find love and happiness with somebody that treated her with love and respect. Who in their right mind would turn away from that? (I certainly didn't when I moved from CA to NJ to be with the man I loved.) I wish that when Kate and Leopold were dancing after Leopold announced his bride, the script could have gone further with the culture shocks that Kate would have experienced in the late 1800's. Then of course, that's the perfect excuse for a sequel! Overall, this movie was lovely and it became one of my favorite movies. I am sure that I will watch this many times over.

I wish I could blame the actors for not taking on challenges, but I really can't because if I were offered millions of dollars to make the movie, I would not have been able to turn them down. With this said, this is an okay movie. Although it resembles several of more recent Meg Ryan movies (You've got Mail, Sleepless in Seattle, French Kiss, IQ need I say more) it still set's itself aside as a pretty good movie. Question for all ya'll what happened to the days of The Doors, When a Man loves a Woman or even When Harry met Sally? Those days when Meg Ryan was much more diverse in her acting. No offense to the marvelous Meg Ryan, I think she could handle any acting job put in front of her. I blame the movie makers, producers, screen writers that make these movies that are 'perfect' for Meg Ryan.
Okay I'm off my soapbox. Sorry
Kate and Leopold is about time travel, love and chivalry.  Wierd combination? Absolutley, so let me summarize. Kate played by Meg Ryan, is a modern day woman who has had problems with relationships, and is currently trying to deal with her most recent break up in addition to getting a promotion from a boss that apparently just wants some action. So needless to say she is currently struggling with her faith in the opposite sex. Her recent ex-boyfriend, Stuart, is a scientist played by Liev Schreiber, who has found a tear in the space time continuem, yeah I know it sounds like something out of Star Trek but that's what it is. While traveling through time Stuart accidentally brings his great-great-great grandfather Leopold back to the future with him. For some unknown and unexplained reason, Leopold can't go back in time until the next week and is forced to spend that time in modern day New York. During this time he meets and falls in love with Kate (Ryan).  What's even more surprising is that Kate also falls for the chivalrous Leopold who stands when she leaves a table and insists on chaperoning her dates.  Well before he knows it the time has come for him to go back, will he go is now the question?",1029715200,2,2227,4.493827160493828

This movie goes beyond bad all the way to terrible. Don't waste your time or your money. Poor Hugh Jackman is stuck in this movie, trying his best to do something with his role. And this is yet another of Meg's really bad choices. If you have a burning need to see her, get Sleepless In Seattle. It's a sweet-natured film, worth seeing.",1029628800,7,630,4.439655172413793
1704950,3,B0000640VN,"Don't you just hate it when Hollywood comes up with an idea for a romantic comedy, gets two likeable stars to play the leads, and then forgets to come up with a decent script?  Oh maybe they make a conscious effort to just forgo one and save some money (especially if they have to shell out a lot for one of the leads).  ""Kate & Leopold"" is just such a movie.

The hook is fairly simple.  Leopold (Hugh Jackman), the Duke of Albany, ends up falling off the top of the Brooklyn Bridge in 1876 in pursuit of a mysterious figure (Liev Schriber) and finds himself in the New York City of today.  There he meets Kate McKay (Meg Ryan), an ad executive who turns out to be the ex-girlfriend of the mysterious figure, one Stuart Besser.  Kate and Leopold fall in love, mainly because they are the title characters and the names of the two actors appear before the title in the credits.  I mean, we understand what she sees in him: he is polite, articulate, and dashingly handsome.  But as near as I can tell he falls in love with her because she is Meg Ryan, so what other possible response could there be?  Then again, she is different from every other woman he has met in his high society days, so maybe there is some notion of chemistry somewhere in there.

The time travel aspects of the film barely rise to the level of secondary considerations, which seems to be a big mistake given the premise.  The portal idea is fine (after all, Christopher Reeves ""thought"" himself back to the past in ""Somewhere in Time""), but if you are going to take someone from 1876 and put them in the present, you would think they would have more important culture shock moments than encounters with a toaster and the NYC pooper-scooper law (please note, these are separate encounters).  Leopold is apparently the inventor of the elevator, or would have been, if he had not come forward in time.  Somehow this explains why all the elevators in NYC (and one presumes the world) have stopped working.  This is really just a minor plot device that allows us to know when Leopold is coming and going, as well as setting up how Leopold ends up on his own in our brave new world.  But certainly the script does little to explore the scenario it has set up (contrast it with the milk it for everything it is worth approach used in ""Groundhog Day"").  Time may well be a pretzel, but that is no reason not to try and straighten out this script a bit.

This movie seeks to answer that age-old quandary, if a bird and a fish fall in love, where would they build a home?  The happy ending is fairly predictable, although the specific mechanics of how it comes about are pretty much pulled out of a hat (if a time portal is always at the same time and place at one end then why is at the same place but at different times at the other end?)

Hugh Jackman's performance carries the film, at least as far as it goes.  Meg Ryan's character seems to be moved by the script rather than motivated to do most of what she does; there is a telling moment early on when she complains that she has wasted her best years on Stephen and he responds unthinkingly but tellingly, ""that was your best?""  It is not a funny moment, and it could have provided a key to the character but Kate ends up being nothing more than a career woman who would not mind a Calgon moment of epic proportions.  The audience ends up having to cross-apply their affection for Ryan from ""Sleepless in Seattle,"" ""When Harry Met Sally,"" and/or ""You've Got Mail"" to really develop their rooting interest for the couple.  Actually, I found myself rooting harder for Kate's brother, Charlie (Breckin Meyer) than I did the primary couple.

I like romantic comedies.  I have a romantic soul.  I cry at the BEGINNING of ""Sleepless in Seattle"" when he says, ""It doesn't happen twice.""  But the most touching moment in this movie is when two characters who are NOT in the title discover something quite important in a photograph.  You know a romantic comedy is in trouble when the sweetest moment happens with neither of the title characters in the scene.  Add to this the fact that the funniest scene in the film is the outtake version of Bradley Whitford's speech from the climax of the film you find in the deleted scenes section of the DVD and that is just another bad sign.  Bottom line: ""Kate & Leopold"" might be one of the most disappointing films you see this year.  Be forewarned.",1029283200,3,4404,4.440298507462686
1704951,3,B0000640VN,"I really, really wanted to love this movie.  At first sight it had everything I wanted in a movie....Hugh Jackman, chivalry, time travel, love conquers all theme(yada, yada, yada).  I've liked a few Meg Ryan films before and I certainly was prepared to be open-minded about this film.
It started out fairly promising.  Hugh Jackman looked marvelous as a turn-of-the-century nobleman.  I fell in love with him right away.  The supporting cast led by Liev Shrieber (as Kate's ex-boyfriend) and Breckin Meyer (Kate's brother Charlie) was entertaining and even funny.  It was Meg Ryan (Kate) that I really had a problem with.  From the first frame til the very last second, she really felt wrong as Kate.  There's no sweetness or endearing quality about this character that would make me empathize with her or want to be like her.  Meg Ryan as Kate was stiff and dull - it was as if she (Meg) was going through the motions just for the heck of it.  You get that feeling of: ""heck, here's another romantic comedy for me to act in. Blah, blah, blah.""  At times I even felt like smacking her. You'd think an actress who got paid millions could at least put a little more effort into her work than the usually drivel.
This film in the hands of another lead actress would've made it much more interesting and enjoyable (Gwyneth Paltrow or Cameron Diaz perhaps?).  Thank goodness for Hugh Jackman or the 2 hours I spent watching this could've really been unbearable!  If you want an effective romantic comedy, check out ""Serendipity,"" ""4 Weddings and a Funeral,"" ""Nottinghill,"" ""Cutting Edge"" or any of the Jane Austen-based films (""Emma,"" ""Pride & Prejudice"") instead.",1028764800,10,1659,4.799295774647887
1704952,3,B0000640VN,"This could have been an awful movie.  It almost was.  This literalization of the fantasy of being swept away by a Real Gentleman (dressed in gold lace, on a white horse, no less!) is painfully hokey sometimes.  The ostensible moral of the movie, that if you just love a gorgeous man enough to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge for him (again, literally!) you'll find true happiness, is one that too many women have already taken to heart.  And the science-fiction machinery is just plain embarassing.
BUT there are three great performances in the movie.  Jackman is wonderful.  You really do get the sense of a Real Gentleman from him.  For a movie that regularly goes over the top, Jackman's encounter with the modern world is surprisingly nuanced and low-key -- he's a scientist of sorts, an inventer, and his delight in seeing how things work is really wonderful.  As is his incredulous dismay at how badly toasters work:  one toasting barely warms the bread & two burns it.  (There's a quick throwaway shot a bit later of a toaster he's jury-rigged to toast perfectly.)  When he's tipsy and tells Meg Ryan's boss and would-be seducer that he's a cad and a serpent, you actually believe, not only that a man would talk like that, but that another man would be taken aback and reconsider his life when he heard it.
The second great performance is by Breckin Meyer, as Ryan's brother.  He does a wonderful job of portraying a manic young man who vexes people in hopes of making them like him.  There's great chemistry in the scenes between him and Jackman, as Jackman teaches him a thing or two about how to approach women.  The two of them sparkle together (much more than Jackman and Ryan ever do.)
The third great performance was by Schreiber, who -- with the help of some magnificent directing -- does a wonderful job at the beginning of the movie, as a 21st Century man prowling about late 19th Century America, and appearing subtly, weirdly, surreally out of place. You don't really know why Jackman is fascinated by him in the opening scenes, but you're fascinated too.  And the scenes between the two when Schreiber inadvertently brings him forward in time with him are wonderfully done.
Meg Ryan on the other hand, is more of a place-holder in this than an interesting character.  She's done much better work.
The three great performances keep this from being an awful movie, but they can't quite it a success.  The end is too disappointing.  The movie parodies itself throughout, but that only makes the final descent into improbable schmaltz that much more painful -- you can tell that even the director doesn't believe in it, so why should you?  The characters all suddenly lose their shape.  Why should the self-absorbed Schreiber suddenly go to great lengths to try to make other people happy?  Why should Meg Ryan believe him when he tells her to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge?  Why does Meyer go along with it?  Under what conceivable circumstances would any duke, let alone a Real Gentleman, have announced his choice of a bride in public, in the presence of all contenders, as if announcing the winner of a raffle?

So -- this movie wavered between being a great movie, and being a dreadful one, but it never quite managed to be either.  It's not a bad cosy, Sunday-afternoon cuddle movie.  But you might want to switch it off before the end.",1028764800,4,3355,4.6825938566552905
1704953,3,B0000640VN,"Director James Mangold tries mightily to create a romantic time travel movie whose focus is on love, not the paradoxes inherent in most time travel films.  In KATE & LEOPOLD, Mangold instead creates a much less amusing movie than what he undoubtedly intended.  First, Nicholas Meyer in TIME AFTER TIME did a much better job of plucking a Victorian gentleman out of the 19th century to find romance in the technological 20th century with a hip American woman.  Now, I have no particular qualms about borrowing ideas from past successes, but at some point in the updated version, the director must do something original.  Unfortunately, Mangold is content to let Meg Ryan, who has made a career of playing the ditsy cute blond, reprise a multitude of roles as Kate McKay, a modern career woman who begins the film in a way guaranteed to make the audience see her as a woman with serious romantic issues.  Kate has just dumped her long-standing boyfriend Stuart (Liev Schreiber), but disconcertingly keeps calling him and bothering him for petty reasons.  Into this falls (literally) a Victorian gentleman, Leopold, Duke of Albany (Hugh Jackman) who has time travelled from a 'portal' of time in 1876 to modern day Manhattan.  Stuart is a time traveler who is visiting 1876 Manhattan and unexpectedly brings Leopold back with him to now.  Nearly all of the charm of this film resides in Jackman, rather than in Ryan.  Jackman's Leopold sets to rest the often quoted canard that most women only say that they want a gentlemen, but really want a 'bad boy' to degrade them with oafish behavior.  Leopold is the quintessential gentleman who looks and acts the part.  He stands up when a lady enters the room.  He is unflaggingly polite.  He even uses words in a way that can charm a fluttering feminine heart.  With a man who apparently can have a variety of women, Mangold would have us believe that Leopold falls immediately in love with a woman who sees him only as the answer to a marketing problem from her job.  I would have appreciated a softening of Kate's character to make the illusion of romance seem more seamless than it was.  It is not Jackman's fault that he cannot carry the movie on his broad shoulders, though he comes close.  Rather, when a romance flounders, the culprit is usually a miscasting of one of the leads or a clumsy hand on the director's part.  It would have taken more courage than Mangold had to choose another female to play Kate. Perhaps a better choice would have been to swap roles  with Kate's secretary (Natasha Lyonne), whose own goo-goo eyes at Leopold might have generated more chemistry.  Further, Mangold overlooks a chink in Leopold's chivalry.  During his return to 1876, Leopold is urged by his family to retrieve the family's finances by marriage with a wealthy, but clearly dorky-looking Miss Tree (Kristen Schaal).  They dance while his uncle announces that Leopold will soon claim an unknown bride, apparently the unglamorous Miss Tree.  When Kate swoops back into Leopold's time, we can see that she is being prepped as the receipient of his betrothal.  As soon as Leopold sees Kate, he illogically falls out of character by dismissing Miss Tree without so much as a by your leave.
  At best, KATE & LEOPOLD is a mildly entertaining update of earlier and similar efforts.  I doubt if too many viewers connected more to Meg Ryan than to Hugh Jackman, who now proves that he is more than just a warmed-over update of Hugh Grant.  About the best thing that Mangold did was to avoid cluttering the movie with paradoxes of time travel.  Still, if he wants to become a force in directing, he must learn more about what makes his characters attractive both to each other and to the audience.",1028592000,,3730,4.748447204968944
1704983,3,B0000640VN,"Leopold (Hugh Jackman) is a duke from 1876 who is on the verge of marrying for money.  Through a reality-suspending twist of fate, he follows a man into a portal to the 21st century.  That man is Stuart (Liev Schrieber), ex-boyfriend to Kate (Meg Ryan).  When Stuart is involved in an accident, Leopold is left to fend for himself.
Kate is unbelieving of Stuart's story and sends Leopold out into the city, leading to all of the expected fish-out-of-water adventures.  This first portion of the movie is completely unorginal and provides little humor.  Eventually, the 19th century charm is unleashed, and Leopold and Kate find themselves falling in love (as always happens when Meg Ryan is around, it seems).  Kate is trying to climb the corporate ladder, yet Leopold leads her to quesion her motives and her desires.
While the romantic portion is predictable, it is also reasonably enjoyable.  And since the audience is probably familiar with the typical Meg Ryan movie formula, the lack of originality is forgivable.  It is neither a terrific movie nor a horrible one.",1028505600,,1071,4.944134078212291

Don't get me wrong, Meg Ryan wasn't bad in this movie - the role just didn't seem like it should be for her. Her cute little routine of scrunching up her nose and having that boyish walk was not exactly glorified in this movie, so heh yea..anyway, I recommend this movie for rainy days, I suppose, and when you have the urge to watch a gorgeous man (ahem, Hugh Jackman) strut his stuff.

Hugh Jackman?  I really don't understand the hype around him, he's not THAT good looking and he's a so-so actor.
Breckin Myer was cute as Meg Ryan's brother but what made me stay awake and endure this movie was Natasha Lyonne.  I was shocked she was in this since she's pretty much an indie queen and in my opinion way too talented to take a bit part in this fluff.  Even her part in this can't persuade me to rate this above one star.  Kate & Leopold was just painfully long and SO predictable.

Meg Ryan ignores the man from the past and is too busy to see him for who he really is until her eyes are magically opened to his true nature as her dream guy.

Her character seems to be a bitter ex-girlfriend who can't leave her ex-boyfriend alone when she first meets Leopold.  Throughout the movie, you do warm up to her, but you're not exactly cheering her on.

What really saves this film is Hugh Jackman and the fabulous supporting cast.  Jackman is magnetic as Leopold; you can't take your eyes off the guy.  His character is everything a woman could want - charming, polite, smart, and sincere.  Did I aslo mention gorgeous?  He seizes conversations with a mere word, and finds the time to chase down purse snatchers.
I'd recommend this as a good film for a rainy Saturday afternoon when you have nowhere else to go, and you need a love story.  It has its flaws, but it does keep your interest til the end.",1027296000,3,887,4.49375
1704988,5,B0000640VN,"An absolutely charming romantic comedy about a love destined to span time.  Duke Leopold of Albany (Hugh Jackman) is accidentally swept from 1876 to present-day 2001 where he finds love in a NOW kind of woman (Kate),  aptly portrayed by Meg Ryan. The time travel is nothing more than a means to an end and fortunately does not dominate the movie.  The style of this flick harkens back to movies of old and is suitable for family viewing.  The movie shows the value and allure of true romance as opposed to lust, and chivalry as opposed to expedience.  This is a witty look at what love has lost through the ages and what it can still be if we only take the time.  The story is delivered with a good dose of humor, too.  Jackman is thoroughly convincing as the Duke and humorously confronts the difficulties of modern life in NYC.  The charm of this movie is that it reveals the value of sincerity, good manners, and taste without taking itself too seriously.  Leopold shows us what we seem to have lost in modern times and why we should value love over a marriage for the sake of financial security or advancing one's career. Finally, Sting's classical guitar ballad  ""Until"" which concludes the movie credits is beautiful and will stay with you... stuck in your head, until you watch the movie again.",1027296000,11,1301,4.568965517241379

If you saw the previews, the movie is exactly what you would expect.  Well, maybe not exactly.  There is somewhat of a twist, but the highly romantic theme was well conveyed in the previews.  Besides being a relatively typical Ryan romance, this movie was very hot in a subtle, sweet way.  If you're a male, that's probably because Meg Ryan is in it.  And if you're a female, it's definitely because Hugh Jackman is in it.  Anyone who doubts Hugh's sex appeal and gentlemanly charm will become a believer with this movie.  Meg Ryan is her usual smart, perky, adorable self.  You'll melt right along with her at Jackman's charm.

1704991,2,B0000640VN,"Hey, I love Meg Ryan and I'm a sucker for romantic comedies and that Hugh Jackman--hubba hubba.  So this movie started off as a 5-star movie for me.  The action-oriented beginning of the movie fulfilled my expectations as the Duke of Albany, Leopold, notices that he is being observed by a stranger (Liev Schreiber) who accidentally pulls the Duke forward into present day New York.  Schreiber's ex-girlfriend Kate then enters the picture.  From that point on, the movie slides slowly into Schmaltzville, stopping by Yawn Valley on its way.
Meg Ryan is miscast as Kate, a woman who ""doesn't do pretty"" but does do rude.  For the life of me, even as big a Meg Ryan fan as I am, I can't figure out how or why Leopold would fall for her.  Jackman's magnetism on-screen is undeniable and his dialogue half-interesting, but he can't pull off the fiction that he would find his true love in this invulnerable straw-haired unwomanly person.  Schreiber, who is the most interesting person to watch in this movie, disappears from view about a third of the way in and doesn't reappear until after an hour of watching Kate and Leopold try to convince the audience that they've fallen in love.
My recommendation:  an okay way to kill a couple of hours, but fast forward through Kate and Leopold's requisite Saturday afternoon date montage and subsequent sleep-inducing deep talk.",1026691200,15,1367,4.836909871244635

Then there's Kate in 2001, plugging along in life, not looking for love, her job is her life right now. Then time travel and her ex-boyfriend bring these two strangers together.
Hugh Jackman's portrayal of Leopold is magnificent.  He is becoming one uniquely gifted actor with many different talents from X-Men to this.  And of course nothing compares to Meg Ryan....she continues to amaze!!
Both actors bring such life to these characters...Leopold's look at NYC in the future is hysterical. He sees a world he doesn't understand and some things that haven't changed. Kate begins to see things through his eyes, and the two begin to share a new world. Definitely a tear jerker, get some tissues ready!

1705003,3,B0000640VN,"This movie had its moments, most of them provided by the yummy Hugh Jackman. And Liev Schreiber is very funny.  But it suffers from a bad case of Meg Ryan wrinkling up her adorable little nose and sighing at her hellish, though expensive, life.
It's also one of these new movies that specializes in insulting the intelligence of its audience. An example: the ""villain"" (a confused character played by Bradley Whitford--he's supposed to be bad, but I'm pretty sure he's not supposed to be an idiot) gets caught lying about an opera he hasn't really seen. Here's the thing: Many, many people in New York City (not just incredibly rich ones) love opera. If you don't know the plot of an opera, there's no point in lying about it, because the chances of getting caught are very high. But, apparently, the people who made this movie believe that the potential audience of this movie thinks that opera is only ever watched by upper-class snobs. And of course, in the end, true love conquers all, which in this case means the woman gives up everything she's worked for all her life, not to mention all her family and friends, to be with her man.
I can't say I didn't enjoy watching this movie. But the more I thought about it afterwards, the more insulted I felt by it.",1026604800,2,1262,4.559471365638767
1705004,3,B0000640VN,"I viewed this DVD recently and watched the original ""theatrical"" version first.  OK stuff, Meg Ryan's character is as abrasive and unlikeable as most of her recent ""cute"" characters seem to be (question: why do movie execs think Meg Ryan being a jerk is so adorable? Inquiring minds...).  But Hugh Jackman is really wonderful as Leopold -- a lovely nuanced portrayal that could have so easily been camp, but which is instead touching and completely believable.  He alone is worth sitting through a basic 2-star comedy-romance for.
BUT -- Then for the heck of it, I watched the Director's Cut, just curious to see what had changed.  Well, WOW.  The Director's Cut is much funnier, smarter, and self-aware (one of its first scenes is a cheesy 'movie romantic comedy' scene being judged by Meg Ryan's focus group, with the girl being singled out by all the viewers as 'too unlikeable' -- VERY funny stuff).  It also allows for some additional (and badly needed) character development for Ryan's character, and actually succeeds in making her more three dimensional and lovable.  (Although Meg's yucky spiky haircut still sucks -- it's just not attractive, and (frankly) emphasizes the fact that she's a ""spunky ingenue"" pushing 40.)
My advice:  Skip the theatrical cut and go straight to the Director's Cut -- Mangold knew what he was doing.",1026518400,11,1338,4.968609865470852

This woman has actually built a career on being cute! It's almost irritating how cute she is - almost. On the other hand, Hugh Jackman's Leopold is the dashing and completely refreshing saving grace of the picture. And the plot, though highly implausible, works on the romantic fantasy level and serves as the film version of the everyday woman's mental escape. Frankly, were it not for Hugh Jackman I would not have gone to see this film - or rented the DVD for the behind the scenes look at the film.

I had never really planned to watch it, fearing a tired re-tread of earlier movies with the too-familiar time traveller and his wacky antics in the modern world.  Fortunately, the mood struck me today and I watched this DVD... ALL of this DVD (including commentaries and extras), which took several hours.  Those who wrote earlier reviews touched on the story and the fine job done by both Jackman and Ryan, so I won't dwell on those points except to reiterate that the film is worth your time.
  What I would like to comment on is how different the two versions of the film contained on the DVD really are.  The disk contains both the original theatrical release and the director's cut.  If you are a real movie aficionado and plan to watch both versions, let me recommend that you watch the theatrical release first and then watch the longer, unedited director's cut second.  It amazed me how much the deletion of just a few minor scenes and snippets of dialogue can alter a movie's basic story. There are some major plot differences between the two versions, the main one centering around a relationship between two of the characters that doesn't exist at all in the edited version (I won't spoil by going into further detail).  My personal preference is for the edited version, but you can make up your own mind.  You can listen to Mangold's feature-length commentary for either version, but let me offer additional advice: watch the commentary for the director's cut, even if you have only watched the theatrical version.  That way you can still experience both versions even if you're too strapped for time to watch the movie three times (imagine that!)  This DVD definitely is not at a loss for extra features!

Leopold was born a Duke but never felt like one, always preferring to work on his inventions instead.  He is encouraged (by his uncle) to marry a rich woman in order to pay off the royal family's many debts.  Leopold notices a man acting strangely at a dance (where he will announce his plans to marry) and follows him to a bridge being built, the Brooklyn Bridge.  Thinking the man is going to commit suicide by jumping off the bridge, Leopold grabs his arm and is pulled over with the stranger.  They are pulled into a time portal.  The stranger turns out to be Stuart Besser, Leopold's great-great-grandson.  Stuart has figured out a way to travel through time and has come to 1876 to meet his ancestor.  Leopold awakes in present day Brooklyn in Stuart's apartment.  Stuart tries to explain that they are now in 2001 and that Leopold will have to wait one week before Stuart can return him to his own time.  Stuart gets hurt in an elevator accident and ends up in the hospital leaving Leopold to get acquainted with modern day New York and inventions on his own.
Living just below Stuart's apartment is Kate McKay (Meg Ryan), a modern day career woman who works in market research.  Kate and Stuart used to date but things didn't work out and now are just neighbors and friends.  Kate and Leopold meet but when Leopold tells her that he is from 1876, Kate thinks he is just another nut and dismisses him as such.  Charlie, Kate's brother, arrives for a visit and becomes friends with Leopold, whom he thinks is a fellow actor.  Charlie realizes Leopold is in love with his sister and sets about getting the two together.
Stuart has to return Leopold to 1876 or Stuart will cease to exist.  Also, because Leopold invented the elevator, they also will cease to function properly (which happens in the movie).  Leopold has fallen in love with Kate but realizes that their romance can never be as he knows he must go back to his own time.  Stuart returns a reluctant Leopold to 1876 just as Kate has discovered that he really was from that time and that she is in love with him.  Stuart informs Charlie of the truth and the two men set about getting the two lovers together, back in 1876.  Leopold is announcing his engagement to a rich woman back in his own time when Kate makes the attempt to travel to his side.
A romantic comedy with a touch of fantasy.  Meg Ryan is at her best in romantic comedies and being paired with Hugh Jackman makes this movie even better.  I own a number of Meg Ryan movies and have never been disappointed in any of them, but I am particularly fond of this one.  I am fond of this movie because of Hugh Jackman.  He is the real star here and were it not for him, this movie would not have been as good as it is.  He really brings his character to life and you will find yourself (if you're female) wishing that time travel existed so you could meet your own duke!

Kate and Leopold is another old-fashioned, clean-cut new classic, joining the other new, family friendly films such as The Majestic, Lord of the Rings, Star Wars Episode 2, and Spider-Man!
 Kate and Leopold is the story of two lonely people from different times. Leopold (Hugh Jackman) is a young duke from the 19th century, who's family has moved to America and squandered away their fortune. As a result, Leopold is now being forced to choose a wife. The problem is, Leopold is not in love. Kate (Meg Ryan) on the other hand, is a New York City girl who has recently and bitterly broken up with her longtime boyfriend, Stuart, an inventor who has discovered a portal through time. Stuart leaps through his new discovery and unintentionally brings Leopold, his great, great, great (I forget how great exactly) grandfather, back with him to modern day New York City. From here we get a charming fish out of water love story reminiscent of Splash, but maybe a little less bizarre. Just a little. While Stuart is in the hospital recovering from an elevator accident, Leopold charms his way into various people's hearts, and becomes a bit of a role model for Kate's younger brother, Charlie. Eventually, Leopold even manages to charm his way into Kate's battered heart, and, being Meg Ryan, she manages to charm him right back. But while this odd romance is blossoming, Stuart is telling his time portal story to the hospital doctors and nurses, who take it all in with more than a grain of salt. He soon finds himself in a psychiatric ward, desperate to break out and find his way back to his ancestor and the time portal. He fears that if he doesn't send Leopold back to his own time soon, he, himself, will cease to exist!
 Kate and Leopold reminds us that a film can be funny, heartwarming, sweet and charming, without a lot of foul language, gratuitous footage, and innuendo. This is simply a charming love story, with endearing characters and a touch of fantasy.

1705038,4,B0000640VN,"A romantic comedy between two characters from different times is an idea rich in potential.  Writer/director James Mangold takes full advantage of the possibilities in this enchanting film that juxtaposes the cultures and values of the late 19th and early 21st centuries New York City.
Mangold shows his versatility here by venturing into the light and breezy zone after strong directorial showings in the more heavy handed ""Girl Interrupted"" and ""Cop Land"".  Despite the clear departure from his previous melodramatic films, Mangold again proves is that he is an excellent actors' director, inducing terrific performances from the entire cast.
The story is full of heartrending moments and hilarious culture shock gags as Leopold (Hugh Jackman) attempts to adapt to the technology and attitudes of modern society.  Mangold is successful at making the point that though much has changed around us, we as people are still very much the same.  Unfortunately, in his zeal to tell a great tale, Mangold plays fast and loose with historical details.
If one is going to make a time travel film, one should research the respective eras and represent history accurately.  The film is rife with anachronisms, especially regarding theater and opera.  Leopold is from 1876, but makes reference to ""La Boheme"" (1896), ""Pirates of Penzance"" (1879), and ""Tosca"" (1898), none of which had yet been performed by the time he left the past.  Also, Brooklyn Bridge architect John Augustus Roebling is seen giving a speech seven years after he died, and Leopold mentions Jack the Ripper, who didn't commit his first murder until the late 1880's.  Still, much can be forgiven for a tale so touchingly and amusingly told.
The acting is excellent by the entire cast.  Hugh Jackman's career grows exponentially with each new role.  A veritable unknown when he took the part of Wolverine in ""X-Men"", he blew the doors off that part and never looked back.  Since then he has delivered three outstanding performances (""Someone Like You"", ""Swordfish"", ""Kate and Leopold""), in all cases rising above the vehicle in which he appeared and eclipsing numerous fine actors.  Jackman has the potential to become this generation's Cary Grant, having dapper good looks and an amiable personality with the versatility to glide effortlessly from serious drama to charming comedies.  In this part he is absolutely magnetic, giving a performance that is as powerful as it is captivating.
Meg Ryan returns to her best genre and gives another terrific performance.  Ryan has enjoyed thirteen fabulous years since she broke through with ""When Harry Met Sally"" in 1989, but is in the twilight of her romantic comedy years.  If she hopes to continue as an actor, she will need to move to different roles that don't require the freshness and adorability that fade with age.  This role is a good hybrid, having her deal with the serious issues of a career woman, while also allowing her to slip on the romantic glove that fits her so well.
Liev Schreiber, Breckin Meyer, Natasha Lyonne, and Bradley Whitford all give strong supporting performances, stealing scenes left and right from the two leads.
This film is a marvelous date flick that is easy to enjoy by men and women alike.  The humor is truly funny, the romance engaging and the acting superb.  I rated it an 8/10, penalizing it a bit for the historical cheating, but if you like romantic comedy this film will deliver a wonderful evening of delightful entertainment.",1024704000,3,3478,5.040139616055846

Mr. Jackman and Meg Ryan play off one another very well, not to mention the lovable, childish antics of Kate's (Ms. Ryan) brother, Charlie (Breckin Meyer).  (Be sure to catch Mr. Meyer's imitation of an Indian watching a Mets game for the first time.  Good golly!) Bradley Whitford portrays Kate's boss, the greasy dirty not-so-old man, with alarming skill.
  My complaints are few.  There is little cursing, which is good, and no sex, which is even better.  Ms. Ryan's hair resembles that of a wet dog, but that can be looked over and detracts little or nothing from the plot.

Ryan plays a fast-rising corporate star, while Jackman is a man transported from the 1800's to the 2000's through no fault of his own.  Actually he is brought to the present by Ryan's ex-boyfriend, played wonderfully by Leiv Schreiber.  The plot is predictable, but if you enjoy light, romantic comedy, this movie's for you!",1024617600,,463,4.621951219512195
1705042,3,B0000640VN,"Meg Ryan may be the queen of chick flicks, but ""KATE & LEOPOLD""
is a surprisingly entertaining romance that has just enough comic and sci-fi elements to make it accessible to guys.
Although the story evokes the familiar time travel formulas used in ""Time After Time"" and ""Somewhere in Time,"" director James Mangold wisely avoids too much explanation other than a ""time portal"" in bringing the chivalrous Duke of Albany (Hugh Jackman) from 1876 to present day New York where he falls in love with advertising exec Kate (Meg Ryan).  Romance itself is idealized in Leopold's kindly and respectful treatment of Kate whose ex boyfriend (Liev Schreiber) is Leopold's great, great grandson (and responsible for bringing Leopold to the present).
Instead of laughing at the quaint notions of 19th century gallantry, they suddenly seem quite valid and desirable making the ordinary casualness of our dating customs and easily disposable relationships seem quite tawdry by comparison.  The production values are of the highest order and the brief scenes in 1876 New York at the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge have a gorgeous painterly quality.
The underlying premise that only Love can conquer Time is a universal longing that permeates this heartwarming film.  Familiar and still fresh.  A pleasant diversion.",1024617600,,1304,5.2548076923076925
1705043,5,B0000640VN,"This film was wonderful.  I hated leaving the theater.  I have to admit that this wasn't Meg Ryan's best film; she acted like she was bored and tired with these type of roles.  Hugh Jackman was a real delight to watch.  His versatility is diplayed quite well.  It will be interesting to see what happens with his career.
This film demonstrates what I am sure a lot of women out there dream of; being able to find their Prince Charming and living happily ever after.  This film may not be for the guys, but ladies if you want to be able to get together with your friends and have a ""girls night"" don't be afraid to chase the guys out and have some time where tears and stary eyes and ""Awh"" moments are alowed.",1024531200,,708,4.246268656716418

1705056,4,B0000640VN,"They say that opposites attract, which proves true for Kate and Leopold. Both beautiful Kate, and sexy Leopold, are bold and brave. But otherwise, they have quite different personalities, are from different eras of time, have different ideas about jobs and the part that morality plays in continuing to work a particular job... all of which made watching them together more fun. Kate's ex reminded me of ""the Doc"" from ""Back to the Future,"" because of his many funny misfortunes but likeability. Kate's brother successfully helps Leopold to shine as Leopold demonstrates his romantic tips and points Kate's brother in the right direction. But can Leopold's attractive mannerisms and romantic views sway Kate to his way of thinking, or is there some way to compromise to allow BOTH their ways of thinking to merge? Or will he have to return to his own time, back to his ""Duke"" position and choose a bride whom he does not love? Will Kate ever realize her feelings for Leopold, or will her job prove to be more important? Watch and find out!",1024444800,,1039,4.810055865921788
1705057,5,B0000640VN,"I saw this movie today for the very first time.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes romantic comedy's, back in time movies, or ordinary girl meets rich and handsome Prince Charming.  It is sort of a Cinderella-type movie and Hugh Jackman was excellent as the British Duke.  He goes back in time to the present day (modern times) and of course, it seems very ackward to him.  But he soon adjusts and falls in love with Meg Ryan's character.  Meg Ryan was excellent also, especially when she finally gave in to Hugh Jackman's (The Duke's) charms and old-fashioned values.  For girls, they will wish that they could meet someone from this time period who is as handsome and charming as Hugh Jackman (The Duke).  Their fate at the end of the movie determines their destiny to be together.  She goes back to his world in the 18th Century from the present day.
This is a movie that you will want to watch over and over again!",1024358400,,933,4.479289940828402
1705058,3,B0000640VN,"""Kate and Leopold"" is, no matter what fans of Meg Ryan say, Hugh Jackman's film.  He alone lifts this rather lukewarm work up to the level of watchable, enjoyable movie, and he alone deserves good mention from every lovers of romantic comedy.
So, the story is simple; for some reason or another, a 19th century gentleman Leopold falls in a rift of time so that he comes to modern-day New York of the 21th century, and meets Kate, working for advertizing company.  That's it.  Leopold, clad in Sgt. Pepper clothes, shows his old-fashioned manners and deportment around in the everyday life of cynical Kate, who doesn't believe a single word of Leopold, but soon finds herself drawn affectionately to this strange guy.
As I said, guys, if you don't like these 'chick films,' just watch Hugh Jackman and skip the rest of it.  He IS worth it.  With ease he shows how to grab women's heart, and the great thing about him is, he looks like a real gentleman living in Victorian age.  And moreover, guys, try to learn his humors, which are of course the essential part of his exuding charms.  The way he speaks some English words only makes a fresh version of ""Englishman in New York.""
About other players, it must be said that director James Mangold didn't do his homework at all, simply content of getting Meg Ryan here as the lead.  Frankly, all I can say is she has played this kind of roles too much.  And other supporting roles are, most regrettably, squandered.  You see sweet Natasha Lyonne, but her role (as a secretary) is too small; with a defter director, she could be better used, or more simply, switch the role of Meg and Natasha, which would give a fresh view to the entire work.  And you leave your seat for a minute, and you will miss the brief, too brief scene of Spalding Gray, whose presence would have given more (quirky) energy to the film than any other players here.  Liev Shreiber and Breckin Meyer appear, but both of them are not allowed to do anything except what they had previously did somewhere else, like ""Sphere"" or ""Road Trip.""  Shame.
Overall agreable romance, if you are not trying to find fault with the time-travel setting of the film, which is not the point of the film.  Still, those who loved this would agree with my opinion that ""Kate and Leopold"" could be much  better with a better-crafted script (the ending especially looks too hurriedly done).  For rainy Sunday afternoon, but you have another choice of far more romantic ""When Harry Met Sally..."" or ""Sleepless in Seattle"" just in case you haven't seen  them.",1024272000,7,2551,4.6208425720620845
1705059,3,B0000640VN,"THERE ARE TWO VERSIONS OF THE FILM ON THIS DVD. THEATRICAL AND DIRECTOR'S CUT. THIS REVIEW IS BASED ON THE DIRECTOR'S CUT. KATE AND LEOPOLD IS ENJOYABLE ENOUGH THAT... YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE END. HOWEVER, NOT MUCH HAPPENS. LIEV SCHREIBER IS A SCENE STEALER, AND THE OTHER CAST MEMBERS ARE GREAT AS WELL. THE FILM BELONGS TO HUGH JACKMAN (LEOPOLD) WHO IS BECOMING A MAJOR MOVIESTAR WITH EACH PICTURE HE DOES. ON THE FLIP SIDE THERE SEEMS TO BE AN ABSENCE OF LEOPOLD'S COUNTERPART (KATE) PLAYED BY MEG RYAN. SHE IS WONDERFUL WHILE SHE'S ON SCREEN. BUT SHE'S NOT ON SCREEN AS MUCH AS YOU WOULD THINK. LITE ON BOTH COMEDY AND ROMANCE THE FILM WILL DO ON A SLOW NIGHT AT THE VIDEO STORE, IF YOU'VE ALREADY RENTED JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSE.

1705060,4,B0000640VN,"I love both Hugh Jackman and Meg Ryan so what could be bad in pairing them up? This film was a joy to watch. It had old New York, time travel and a good love story. After falling through time, Jackman adapts pretty quickly. The small scene with the cop and dog is quite telling of the differences he encounters. Although he's an aristocrat, he is quite the gentleman. Meg is the typical ""career girl"" as he dubs her and it's all fun from there. The acting by the supporting cast is wonderful. The movie is just delightful. Watch and enjoy!!!!! Definitely a ""Chick Flick"".",1024099200,,571,4.447619047619048
1705061,3,B0000640VN,"There is a lot to like about Kate and Leopold. It's not a great romantic comedy, but there's enough to it to provide a decent enough evening's entertainment. So light and airy that it feels almost translucent, it's a movie you probably won't remember much about a couple of years from now.
For the umpteenth time, Meg Ryan plays a character called Kate. This time she is Kate McKay, a brash, thirtysomething New Yorker who's an ad executive. She's recently broken up with her boyfriend, Stuart [Liv Schreiber], who lives in the apartment above her. He's some sort of renegade scientist who has discovered a time portal through which he travels back to the New York of the 1870s. While he is there snooping around, he is caught by Lord Leopold Montbatten [Hugh Jackman]. As Stuart races back to the Brooklyn Bridge, where the portal is located, Leopold pursues him, and both wind up back in present day Manhattan.
Leo, a scientific type himself, is utterly fascinated by the modern world. He has no reason to lie about where he is from. After all, who would believe him anyway? Kate certainly doesn't. She assumes he is just another of Stuart's fruitcake friends. At first she can't stand his old-fashioned and chivalrous ways, but gradually she begins to think that being treated like a lady has its rewards, especially when the gentleman is as attractive, witty and intelligent as Leo is.
High Jackman proves he is decidedly leading man material. I can think of few actors who could pull this role off as well as he does. It requires dignity and a lot of comic timing to play someone like Leopold, who the kind of character which can come off as idiotic, but Jackman avoids the pitfalls with graceful ease. Watching him, I was reminded of the young Cary Grant, who was able to act the fool and still command an audience's respect
Ms. Ryan's brash, no nonsense style - so charming in movies like Sleepless in Seattle and When Harry Met Sally - doesn't work here. It's as though the actress wasn't that enthusiastic about a return to romantic comedy. The character is supposed to represent the distrust and isolation that many women feel in today's fast-paced society, but this doesn't explain why Ryan plays Kate as abrasive and frequently rude. Her performance makes it hard to believe that Leo could fall in love so hard and so fast.
Time travel is not what Kate and Leopold is about. It's about opposites attracting. Still, it might say something about the modern world when a girl has to go back to the 19th Century to find a guy. But, then, Leo had to come to our century to find someone. So, does that mean there was something wrong with the girls back then? Will we ever get it right?",1023926400,,2691,4.631799163179917
1705062,3,B0000640VN,"I have always enjoyed time travel stories just to see how the writer works out the twists and irregularities. Unfortunately time travel is just a device to get the two leads together. From that point we know they will fall in love and they will get together at the end of the film.
But the cast is first rate. Meg Ryan does what she does best and Hugh Jackman seems destined to become the next superstar. The two supporting actors are very good. Great cast makes a poor story worth watching.
The tale starts out with the opening of the Brooklyn Bridge in the late 1800s and moves forward to our time with Prince Leopold - in New York at the insistence of his uncle to look for a wife with money to shore up his family's faltering fortune - following a traveler from our time. He lands on Meg Ryans doorstep and eventually in her heart. There is a nice rooftop scene reminisent of The Goodbye Girl and several scenes that could be moved about however you like as they do nothing to advance the plot. If you pay attention at the beginning of the film you will see the end. Appropriate for a time travel tale, don't you think?

1705064,4,B0000640VN,"Check your logic at the door with this film because it's all about having fun. Meg Ryan makes a return to her specialty in this cute romantic comedy. The film is reminiscient of other time travel romances but it manages to make the film interesting without stuffing the 'science' down your throat. A truly charming Hugh Jackman stars as Duke Leopold, living in the 1800's and about to choose a bride. He follows a mysterious man (Liev Schriber) through a portal of time, and finds out this man, Stewart, is his great-great-great grandson. Through circumstances a little too complicated to go through now, Leopold comes to stay with Kate (Ryan) who is Stewart's ex girlfriend. At first the two are at odds and their banter is actually funny. Leopold is polite and charming, and helps Kate in distress. He even manages to teach Kate's younger brother (Breckin Meyer) how to get the ladies. What's not to love? A romance eventually develops between the two which leads to a conflict since Leopold obviously can't stay in the future. I won't tell you what happens but I will tell you it ends with a happily ever after. The reason the film works well is the charisma and the chemistry the two leads share. While it's nice to see Meg Ryan back in her forte, it's even nicer to see Hugh Jackman playing his role with depth and believability. I had liked him before but now I like him a lot and have sought out his other films. The bottom line is, if you're looking for a film with romance, wit and acting well done, 'Kate and Leopold' will definately leave you satisfied.",1023926400,4,1564,4.589285714285714
1705075,1,B0000640VN,"Once again Meg Ryan does her ""ain't I the cutest thing?"" bit in another boring film that isn't worth the price of a small Coke, not to mention the price of a movie rental!!

1705076,5,B0000640VN,"This movie does have elements of many genres, including science fiction, romance, and comedy, and is broad enough to be appealing to viewers of both genders. In fact, I think some of the male-interaction scenes, of which there are many, are perhaps more interesting to the men than the women. If not interesting, then at least educational: men, pay attention! There are some great old-school clues in here for wowing your women. As for the women, there's Hugh Jackman, so what else do you need? :)",1023840000,,497,4.790697674418604
1705077,5,B0000640VN,"Leopold is my new hero. He's not only a gentlemen, but he's a gentleman with moral absolutes. So much in our world is gray, that it's refreshing to meet someone who knows what he stands for. As a movie, it's a great romantic comedy. Who cares if it's ""believeable"". It's a wonderful escape from the threat of terrorist attacks and the rising jobless rate. The only thing I didn't care for was the amount of profanity. A couple of times it just didn't fit. At one point Leopold says, ""Where the hell am I?"" Leopold was an English gentlemen in 1876 and would NOT have used that kind of language. I think it could have been toned down a little in that area. The PG-13 rating is probably appropriate because of the language, but there is nothing else offensive in the movie.",1023840000,,770,4.429577464788732
1705078,4,B0000640VN,"I had been told that to truly enjoy this romantic comedy, I needed to suspend belief, not think about time travel as a reality, and then just sit back and be entertained.
I followed this good advice and really liked this movie for what it was....light, bright, and entertaining with no deep underlying message or dark side. Lots of laughs, some pratfalls, and an enjoyable couple of hours.
Meg Ryan played her usual light comedy role with presence and her effervescent charm. Hugh Jackman was marvelous in his depiction of a chivalrous 19th century nobleman set adrift on the unfamiliar terrain of today's New York City. A good supporting cast is in place as well.

1705095,3,B0000640VN,"Time travel is such a far-fetched theme in hard-scientific terms, that I guess it's understandable that movies that employ it have a tendency to become less science-fiction oriented and more simply ad hoc in how time travel is achieved. Such is especially true when travel into the past is involved. According to science fast-froward time travel is theoretically as simple as just travelling very fast in space, but back-in-time travel is far more conjectural, proposed to be possibly achievable by things so extreme and esoteric as falling into rotating black holes. No scientific theory makes falling off the Brooklyn Bridge at the right moment a means of time travel. So, no surprise that time travel movies become less science fiction and more ad hoc fantasy-drama, from PEGGY SUE GOT MARRIED to FREQUENCY. So we should scarcely object to this movie as scientifically implausible; it's in a genre scarcely attempting to significantly resemble hard science fiction. But what makes it really kind of flaky is that its feel-good human drama is sometimes almost as implausible as its time-travel method. In this generally rather likeable story, Kate is very much what some might call a ""Today's Woman"". She functions in twenty-first century culture with contemporary values and aspirations. Yet she learns that it is somehow her blessed destiny to travel back over a century to live instead in a time when women couldn't even vote, not to mention all the other inevitable culture-shock awaiting her there. Okay, nostalgia for the past is valid to a point; we could learn some positive things from the past. But completely trying to have it both ways is a bit too much. All the changes in gender roles we've been told were vital to justice over the past few decades cannot be both liberating of women from past bondage AND at the same time be part of a modern world that one can only flee from to the old days of all the ""degradations"" that modern demands would ""liberate"" women from. So nostalgia here gets stretched into outright fantasy, not even counting the fantasy of the method of time travel. A woman like Kate (or virtually any other American woman more mainstream than the Amish) would surely find 1870s life more hellish than blessed if suddenly transported back there. If you can suspend disbelief on all levels, this movie can be a low-key feel-good diversion...",1019260800,4,2374,4.9523809523809526
1705096,5,B0000640VN,"Kate and Leopold is a comic and romantic film that circles around the lives of two individuals from two different time zones.  Kate McKay, portrayed by celebrated film leading lady, Meg Ryan, is a topnotch business executive in New York.  As an achiever, she focuses on reaching the highest rank within the company she is working at sacrificing love.  At a time when she is geared towards success, she meets a dashing debonaire from a past era.  Leopold, played by up and coming Australian lead actors, Hugh Jackman.  Leopold transcends to the present time through his accidental encounter with a man from the present who happens to be, Kate McKay's former boyfriend.
After the complicated yet seemingly legitimate process of time travel, Kate and Leopold meets in New York.  They hated each other considering the vast difference in their culture and upbringing.  Imagine, a knight in shining armor from the 18th century in the same side of the world with a controlling woman of the new millenium.  The ultimate clash of civilizations.
The film succeeds in portraying love as the power of all powers.  Time helps two hearts find the love they have been wanting for life.  Love in turn becomes the reason for them to meet at the same time and place in life.
It's a feel-good movie that makes one wish that its events are true and realistic.  Ryan will charm you with her unbelievable presence behind the white screen.  Jackman will entice you with his remarkable talent and melting smile. It's worth the money.",1018483200,2,1509,4.828793774319066
1705097,5,B0000640VN,"I have seen ""Kate & Leopold"" about a few days after the film came out, and I thought that it was a really sweet romantic comedy with a romantic twist! The stars of the film, Hugh Jackman (""Swordfish"") and Meg Ryan (""Proof of Life"") gave great and funny performances that make them the best on-screen couple since Ryan and Tom Hanks starred in ""Joe Versus the Volcano"", ""Sleepless in Seattle"", and ""You've Got Mail""! I really liked Jackman the most in this film because I would like to think of ""Kate & Leopold"" as his follow-up film to 2001's ""Someone Like You"" with Ashley Judd. The direction of James Mangold (""Cop Land"", ""Girl, Interrupted"") was brilliant in every way possible! The film starts off in the late 19th century version of New York. The year is 1876. It concerns Duke Leopold of Albany (Jackman) being accidentally swept away into the present-day New York one night. He takes one look at how the ""new"" New York is and he is quite shocked at what he is seeing. In other words, Leopold has to adjust (""blend in"") with this new trend somehow. There he meets a hardworking Manhattan executive named Kate McKay (Ryan) who lives with her brother Charlie (Breckin Meyer, ""Road Trip""). During the film, to me, it seems as though Leopold and Kate might not be the perfect couple, they might not see eye to eye, but when you get right down to it, they just might fall in love together! In closing, the performances by Jackman and Ryan were very sweet and very appealing as well. The other performances by Breckin Meyer, Natasha Lyonne (""American Pie 1 and 2""), and Liev Schreiber (""The Hurricane""), who plays Ryan's ex-boyfriend, were simply amazing and quite enjoyable! ""Kate & Leopold"" has got to be Hugh Jackman's best since ""Someone Like You"" and Meg Ryan's best since ""Sleepless in Seattle""! It is so charming, so witty, and so downright funny that you would have to see ""Kate & Leopold"" again and again!

We thoroughly enjoyed it and would say to go and have a nice time. There is almost no swearing, and thank God there is not the sexual stuff, that most of us parents have to view. This is a movie that parents and children can see together.

1705101,3,B0000640VN,"When Liev Schreiber as Meg Ryan's former boyfriend opens a time portal, a love match extending not just over the Atlantic Ocean but over the expanse of better than a century occurs.  At the end of the picture Schreiber sees the full significance:
""You'd better get over to England,"" he warns Ryan, ""or I'm never going to be born.""
The critical need for Ryan to travel across the time expanse to nineteenth century England and reunite with the love of her life is that the Duke of Albany, played by dashing Hugh Jackman, is the genius inventor great-great grandfather of Schreiber, who realizes that the future will be disrupted if Ryan's love cannot find him a wife and put the discontented aristocrat on the track to establishing a family.
When the story begins the Duke is on the verge of having his engagement announced to a young American woman from Schnectady, New York on the simple pretext that it is time for him to get married and this is an excellent economic match, a position taken frequently through history in monarchical and aristocratic circles.  The Duke is bored by the whole thing, having concluded that he is not about to find love in the first place.
Once that he is transported across the Atlantic to present day New York Jackman discovers love with Meg Ryan.  Once that she gets over the initial culture shock of meeting a man from another era with a different social perspective Ryan becomes so impressed by Jackman that she displays her flattery in the area where her pocketbook resides, the career domain.  Ryan, a female advertising executive, thinks Jackman conveys just the level of elan coupled with credibility to serve as an excellent advertising spokesperson.  The only hitch, however, is that Jackman is indeed a man of credibility and sterling integrity.  He balks over being expected to endorse a product in which he does not believe.  His protest over the ""follow the leader"" symbolism of Madison Avenue advertising practices prompts Ryan to see her life and job in a new light.
After Jackman has been transported back to England and is on the verge of agreeing to an engagement to the girl from Schenectady, and the surely loveless marriage that will result, Schreiber stresses the need for Ryan to be reunited with him.  She makes her decision at the formal party thrown in her honor to announce her elevation to the vice-presidency of the advertising company where she works.  She stuns those in attendance by respectfully declining the promotion offer, then rushes off.
Ryan in the nick of time manages to jump from Brooklyn Bridge, at which point the time dimension catapults her to England and back to Jackman.  The loveless marriage will not occur, the girl from Schenectady is destined to fade away, and love will reign between Ryan and Jackman, who will ultimately invent the elevator.
This is a lighter, more comedic time travel romance as opposed to the more solemn 1980 love story drama superbly rendered in ""Somewhere in Time"" with Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour.",1016496000,4,3017,4.852140077821011
1705102,4,B0000640VN,"""Kate and Leopold,"" directed by James Mangold, combines a time-travel plot device with a sweet comic romance. Meg Ryan and Hugh Jackman play the title characters, a contemporary research and marketing executive and a 19th century nobleman.
Although Ryan is effective, it's Jackman's performance that really carries the film. He is marvelously funny and charming in his ""fish-out-of-water"" role. Those who are fans of Jackman's moody, intense performance as Wolverine in ""X-Men"" will be in for a stunning surprise if they see him as this witty, cultured character. In addition to nice interplay with Ryan, Jackman also has a great ""buddy"" chemistry with Breckin Meyer in a supporting role.
Liev Schreiber brings unexpected depth to his largely comic supporting role. His character's speech explaining a scientific epiphany is particularly good. ""Kate and Leopold"" is a pretty light film, but it's quite satisfying.",1016409600,4,913,5.436619718309859

A sweet romantic comedy, but not a movie for action lovers. This is solely a movie for Hugh Jackman fans who get to see him with a lovely accent and quite a different role than the other movies he has made. He is truly a rising star.
The ending was rather silly though. Everything happened in less than 3 minutes when it should have had at least 10-15 minutes to let us indulge what was happening. Meg Ryan is still acting like if she were again making French Kiss but still a lovely comedy.",1012089600,,1374,4.188679245283019
1705134,2,B0000640VN,"In itself, there's a sense of the romantic in the notion of time travel; and when you introduce the idea of two people traveling through time to find one another-- when you factor in love-- it puts the romance in the romantic.  It's quite a concept, and it's the basis of director James Mangold's ""Kate and Leopold,"" starring Meg Ryan and Hugh Jackman, a film that asks the audience to suspend disbelief for a couple of hours and just go with the flow.  In other words, don't look too deep into this one; if you can do that, you may have a good time with this film, but bear in mind you're going to have to meet it at least half-way for it to be what it was meant to be:  Pure entertainment; no more, no less.
 It's New York, 1876; the Brooklyn Bridge (which ultimately figures prominently in the plot) is being built, and though John Roebling's ""erection"" (as it is referred to) is of great interest to Leopold Mountbatten (Jackman), Duke of Albany, there are more pressing matters in his life.  His Uncle Millard (Paxton Whitehead) is insisting that Leopold choose a bride from amongst the most rich and available of society, and has arranged for a ball to be held at his mansion, at which time his nephew will announce the name of the lucky lady.  At the ball, however, a stranger catches Leopold's eye, who-- when he notices he is being watched-- bolts from the premises with Leopold in pursuit.  The chase takes them to the bridge, whereupon something inexplicable happens, and Leopold suddenly finds himself in New York, 2001, in the apartment of the man he had been chasing, Stuart Besser (Liev Schreiber).  Things happen fairly rapidly after that, and very quickly Leopold meets Stuart's ex-girlfriend (who lives upstairs), Kate McKay (Ryan).  And then the real story begins as, not surprisingly (refer to title of film here), Kate and Leopold discover that there may be something more to their chance meeting than just a newly founded friendship.  But there's a problem, and it's a big one:  They happen to live in different centuries...
 In the final analysis, this mildly diverting, minor romantic fantasy is buoyed by the star power it employs, without which it would barely stay afloat.  Not that it's a ""bad"" movie, but it suffers from a decided lack of originality in both story and presentation.  Given the concept of the film, it needed an imaginative touch to really make it work, and unfortunately, Mangold was unable to provide it.  And it's a shame, because in Ryan and Jackman he had two of the main ingredients for success, but he failed to make the most of it.  Like mixing metaphors, mixing genres is a hard sell to begin with, and it's imperative that the filmmaker have a definite vision going into such an undertaking; Spike Jonze did with ""Being John Malkovich"" (from which this film borrows the concept, as well as the context, of the ""time portal,"") and was successful.  Mangold, however, failed to realize such a vision, and the moment passed him by.
 As the Duke, Hugh Jackman gives a convincing performance, complete with a passable British accent.  And you have to give Jackman credit for constantly striving to expand his horizons artistically; he's done science fiction (""X-Men""), romantic comedy (""Someone Like You""), action/thriller (""Swordfish"") and now this, which is different still.  Also to his credit, he's done well in them all.  With such a diverse resume, he's already demonstrated his versatility and ability as an actor, and add to that the fact that he has a definite screen presence, and you know-- without a doubt-- that you're looking at a ""star"" who is only just beginning his ascent, the kind who will bring more than ""celebrity"" to whatever role he takes on.  Definitely an actor of whom we will be seeing a lot more.
 Meg Ryan is a versatile actor, as well, who can do drama (she was outstanding in ""When A Man Loves A Woman""), or action/drama (""Proof of Life""), but her forte is romantic comedy (""Sleepless In Seattle,"" ""You've Got Mail"").  As Kate, however, she gets caught up in her character with the same misdirection that characterizes this entire film.  On one hand, Kate is sweet and perky (traits upon which Ryan has successfully capitalized elsewhere), but there is also a more jaded side to Kate, the businesswoman striving to get ahead (More like Diane Keaton's J.C. in ""Baby Boom""), and these two sides of Kate's personality, rather than making her a complex character, simply do not seem to gel, and at times the demands of the way in which the character is written takes it's toll on credibility; and in a story like this, the one thing you absolutely need is believable characters, people you can accept as presented.  And there are too many moments in which the side Ryan is attempting to convey seems forced.  I hasten to add that it is not entirely her fault; the character is poorly written, and Mangold did not serve his star well.  It goes back to the vision of the director.  A Nora Ephron, for example, knows how to get the best out of someone like Ryan, whereas Mangold simply does not.
 Turning in notable performances in supporting roles are Liev Schreiber, another gifted actor who has yet to have his day in the spotlight (he has one of the best voices in the business, so effective in his terrific portrayal of Orson Welles in ""RKO 281""); and Breckin Meyer, convincing as Kate's actor brother, Charlie.
 The supporting cast includes Natasha Lyonne (Darci), Bradley Whitford (J.J.), and Philip Bosco (Otis).  The anticipation for this film was high, but ambiguous direction and lack of definition causes ""Kate and Leopold"" to misfire at just about every turn.  Ryan, Jackman, Schreiber and Meyer deserve better than this, and so does the audience.  The magic just isn't there.",1012003200,10,5763,4.7645875251509056

It stars the amazing Hugh Jackman as Leopold, the Duke of Albany, and inventor of the elevator. Hugh Jackman does a smashing job... dashing his way into the hearts of his female viewers and invoking serious jealousy in the hearts of men.
Seriously though, the character of Leopold has something to teach of respect and integrity... not to mention, does a pretty good job of blueprinting the mind of a genius. The movie does an excellent job of contrasting the rat race of everyday life in modern day New York with the turn of the century Victorian New England. Lack of development of the main female character (played respectably by Meg Ryan) as well as too much action in the beginning of the movie and a short ending are really it's only shortcomings.

1705140,4,B0000640VN,"As a big fan of romance novels set in the regency era, I could tell from the previews that this would be my kinda movie and overall, it was.  Hugh Jackman was believable as a Duke, the perfect gentleman, and he was the perfect actor for this role.  The sky might have been the limit as far as his shining performance goes had he been cast beside someone within his acting league.
I was embarassed for Meg Ryan.  Does she not have any friends that tells her the truth?  Whatever she did to her lips, she looked like Jack Nicholson in his role as the Joker in the first Batman movie!  She couldn't even ACT like she was used to her new lips!  When she's drinking a glass of wine, I couldn't even concentrate on the dialogue!  I was too busy watching Meg learning how to drink with her new lips while still in her role as Kate.  Her tired face isn't going to win any beauty contests either.  Not even a local contest!  Someone with Hugh's looks deserved someone better looking.  I'm all for women of all ages being represented in Hollywood and a wrinkle here and there is ok but not when she's got ""ugly-morning-face"" all throughout the day.  And a talented actress should be able to portray someone who is tired without actually looking worn-out and exhausted.  I don't blame Meg.  I blame the people who chose her for this role.
Then there's her hair.  I understand that she was to portray someone who was trying to break the glass ceiling and she needed to wear pants to remind Leopold that he was no longer in his time.  But there are women who are trying to break the glass ceiling who still look feminine and who wear modern skirts.  I don't believe there is ANY requirement that a female has to have a butch hair cut and look worn-down to climb the corporate ladder.  And this is a fantasy after all.  Why fantasize about ugly when you can fantasize about beautiful?  I myself don't wear make-up and wear pants most of the time but if I wanted to see that, I could've looked in the mirror!  I go to the movies to ESCAPE reality not to look for similarities.  I want glitz and glamour in my escapism.
Last but not least is her now famous dance of joy that she does in almost every movie I've ever seen her in.  She throws her fists into the air in the same manner and style every time!  Meg wasn't acting as Kate.  Meg was being Meg in a movie about a character named Kate.  Why couldn't they have gotten a talented actress to play Kate?  (someone who's proven they can play versatile roles such as Holly Hunter or almost any British/Australian actress)
This fantasy movie was good despite my grumblings about how Kate was represented.  But it saddens me because I see the potential in what might have been.  As it stands now, I have no idea what it was that drew Leopold to Kate.  Her physical points aside, she was suspicious, untrusting, clumsy, uncaring and a lousy cook!  I vote that this movie be remade again with Hugh Jackman and another female actress.  Meg isn't the only thing wrong with this movie but that would be a start.  Those few minutes wasted on the next door neighbor kid should've ended up on the floor of the editing room.  There should have been more of the romance between Kate and Leopold instead.

1705157,4,B0000640VN,"Guys, read the title. Women will enjoy this movie, because it is romantic, and has Meg Ryan (The Queen of the chick flick), and is downright ""cute"" in its entirety. Thrown in for good measure is newcomer Aussie Hugh Jackman (X-men's Wolverine and a top  contender for James Bond after Pierce Brosnan retires) as romantic lead Leopold, a real life duke from the 18th Century.
This movie will keep guys interested too. Though romance is the key element here, there are doses of comedy, physical comedy, and science fiction. Leopold is from another time, brought here (ironically) by Kate's ex-boyfriend, who happens to be a genius inventor. Their is no time machine here to bog down the story. Time travel is broken down as a simple theory and is beautifully handled here.
Supporting cast including Myer Breckman (Rat Race) as Kate's hilarious actor-brother who thinks Leopold is a method actor who just won't break character, Leiv Schreiber (Phantoms/Scream 2-3)as Meg's ex-boyfriend, and film veteran Phil Bosco in a deliciously understated cameo as Leopold's trusted servant Otis, all turn in strong performances.
A great couples film with mass appeal.

Keep your eye on Hugh Jackman. This guy really is the next Mel Gibson.",1010102400,20,1225,5.0594059405940595
1705158,3,B0000640VN,"I quite enjoyed this, but thought that more careful writing could have made it as good as it deserved to be.
Much of the situation's interest comes from how a titled gentleman from 1876 would react to New York in the 21st Century.
Much of that is charmingly done--and Jackman himself does a marvelous job.
But a gentleman of that time would have been shocked to the garters by Kate's morality. He never would have carried her to her bedroom if he thought of her of anything but a trollop, and she asks him to stay the night?
Further his demonstrated ""gallentry"" in lighting a cigarette for a woman (with a wooden matach) is something he wouldn't have done even for a prostitute.
The recreation of 1876 is wonderful. Meg Ryan is wonderful. Everythingh is wonderful except the research.
Also, did I miss something. One review said Jackman was Kate's bofriend's grandfather--and there is some incest issue. Maybe I was asleep during that part but I saw no reference to is in the film.",1009929600,,981,4.64367816091954
1705159,2,B0000640VN,"I'm really sorry to be the lone voice of dislike, here, but this movie had no color. It was almost like Ryan was saying, ""The studio is making me do another one of these stupid romantic comedies."" She obviously didn't want to be tHere, whcih made it really hard for the audience to enjoy viewing her performance. Because she was so colorless, negative, and almost bored with her performance, there was really no chemistry between her and Jackman. He did a wonderful job, as did Schribner as her nutty ex-boyfriend. even her brother lit up the screen. Unfortuately, chemistry is the main ingredient in any romanitc comedy, and this one had no fizzle at all. I could have walked out halfway through, and never missed a thing.",1009929600,4,723,4.700787401574803

Since I am a bit of a history buff (reenactor from the same time era as Leopold is in,) I enjoyed the movie.  I didn't realize that there was going to be a surprise ending to it, which just shocked me.  It's a very sweet movie, and I don't think it will hurt Meg Ryan or Hugh Jackman's career.  You know how you feel you wanna do one of those movies that gets your spirit up, this would be it!  I'm not going to tell you the plot, I'll just let you go see it and find out for your self and see how you like it, instead of me telling you.  Though I was insulted when I came into the movie theater (the ticket person asked me if I was old enough to see this movie...*scoff*.)  I'll just tell you this:  If you want a warm hearted, giggle-fest, modern New York/love story, you will be pleased by this simple story about believing in love even though it comes up as a 125 year old man shot from the past to the present.

Her hair looked a perpetual mess and we could all see the choice of lipliner color.  Meg Ryan is a pretty woman and would benefit from an image change.  Hugh Jackman was wonderful as the male lead and exuded masculine charm and refinement; quite a departure from his role as Wolverine and Eddie in ""Someone Like You.""  The movie's dialogue was fresh and witty.  A good supporting cast helped this movie succeed.  The subplot of Kate's ex-boyfriend in a mental hospital was a bit far-fetched.  However, it was saved by his analogy of time-travel to a dog viewing a rainbow.

I was pleasantly surprised.  The entire ensemble works well together, the film has many moments of charm and humor, and (despite a few logical leaps of faith) it doesn't insult one's intelligence.  This isn't deep, it isn't ""art,"" and it's not going to win any Oscars.  But you're not going to feel like you wasted your $8.50, either.  (And yes, Hugh is great.

1705164,5,B0000640VN,"I didn't expect too much before I entered the theater. However it was just a little too long to sit through the 3 hour Lords of the Ring after Christmas. It was to my surprise that this is not just a light-hearted, less than 3 minute laugh romantic comedy (have you even squeezed a smile during Shallow Hal?). The pace, the casting and the wardrobe of the movie are perfect. The contrast between the 19th century gentleman Hugh Jackman and the 21st century New Yorker Breckin Meyer is extraordinary structured. The jokes are clever and short. The plot, a mix of historical reference and fiction is imaginative (though the jumping off the Brooklyn Bridge part is not convincing at all). This is a typical Meg Ryan role while Hugh Jackman has all the charm and class as the Duke (much better than Swordfish). Breckin Meyer, who plays the little brother is the best of all. He shines through the movie and steals quite some scenes.
Generally speaking, I enjoy it very much and highly recommend it to anyone who is tired of the regular romantic comedy which usually goes nowhere.",1009670400,,1075,4.663157894736842
1705165,5,B0000640VN,"Much to my surprise, this personable time travel romance is the hidden gem of the holiday season.  Of course, the plot - handsome 19th century duke travels to the 20th century where he meets driven but unfulfilled career woman - does require a certain suspension of disbelief.  If you can accept the premise, the rest of the story is predictable but charmingly executed.  The dialoque is witty and clever, and the acting is first-rate.  Hugh Jackman is yummy as the duke, and Meg Ryan is Meg Ryan; the supporting cast is terrific.  The writers have wisely mixed comedic and romantic scenes.  My only reservation is the internal inconsistencies and improbabilities - I was particularly distracted by the idea that a 19th century duke would have the faintest idea of how to cook dinner.  Extra credit for most entertaining use of a ""sign here"" sticker.",1009670400,2,850,4.861111111111111
1705166,2,B0000640VN,"While this story is sheer fantasy, it is sweetly intended but sorrily lacking in plot development, character interaction ( such as: Why didn't anyone visit Stuart in the hospital?) and overall momentum.
The building of affection between the two main characters, not to mention conflict (the foundation of any good story) was almost absent from this film.
The struggle of emotion between Kate (a modern executive woman of the 21st century) and Leopold (a man transported from the 19th century unvoluntarily) is almost non-existant since there is no real conflict adding dimension to the story.
Hugh Jackman offers up a good performance despite a lacklustre plot and co-star.  I fear Meg Ryan has played this role so many times that she lacks the sincerity to do it justice - though, in her defense she cannot be blamed entirely since the premise of the story doesn't exactly lend itself to becoming a romance that leaves you desperate for them to be with each other.  I found myself almost indifferent to their success - occassionally (and mildly at that) feeling a slight wish if only for Hugh Jackman's character, Leopold.
Jackman deserves Golden Globe consideration for making this movie as tolerable as it is.  Simply put, this movie is sweet yet lacking in substance.",1009670400,10,1271,4.985849056603773
1705167,4,B0000640VN,"This movie was both romantic and comical. Hugh Jackman was quite convincing as a Duke from the 1800s.  He was as handsome and charming as Meg Ryan was witty and cute.  Meg Ryan was in true form in this movie including ""Meg Ryan's"" quirky smiles and frowns.  Her character is lovably as usual.  If you enjoyed You've Got Mail, you'll enjoy Meg in this one as well.

1705168,4,B0000640VN,"""Kate and Leopold"" is not a masterpiece, but gets the job done.  A story about lovers meeting across time is not particularly original. However, this film works because of the chemistry between Hugh Jackman and Meg Ryan.  They hold it together in spite of its obvious flaws.  Liev Schreiber as the bumbling time traveler who brings them together gives a solid performance.
My advice is not too take the movie too seriously, but simply enjoy it for what it is.  It is unapologetically escapist entertainment, and doesn't pretend to offer any answers to the existential mysteries of the universe. Does it deserve any Academy Ward nominations?  No, but it will likely bring a warm smile to your face.  ""Kate and Leopold"" is a good way for you and your significant other to enjoy an evening.

1705181,4,B0000640VN,"The movie, Kate & Leopold, could be considered a ""chick flick"", but I went with my husband and he liked the movie too.  The main characters are:  Kate(Meg Ryan) and Leopold, Third Duke of Albany(Hugh Jackman) and funny secondary characters:  Stuart, Kate's ex-boyfriend(Liev Schreiber from the Scream movies), Kate's brother Charlie(Breckin Meyer from Inside Schwartz), and Kate's boss JJ(Bradley Whitford from West Wing).  Stuart is a inventor/science guy who finds a time portal to 1876 and travels there.  Leopold follows him back through the portal and that is when the fun begins.  Imagine trying to fit into a world 125 years in the future.  Kate enjoys the attention and care that Leopold gives her and he finds himself falling in love with her.  Reality sets in and Leopold does go back to 1876, but you have to see the movie to see the happy ending.  Meg Ryan is her usual sweet self, Liev Schrieber does a good job with his limited scenes, Breckin Meyer is so cute as the younger brother, but Hugh Jackman is the star.  His charming presence, soft spoken accent, humor, and grace make him the reason to see this movie again and again.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that the movie ends way too quickly - I needed an short ""epilogue"" on what happens after the ""happily ever after"".

And in these times, that's most welcome! The only negative to me is that Meg Ryan, while no doubt a very talented actress, has done this kind of role many times before, and maybe it's time for her to try other character-types. As for Hugh Jackman, this movie more than makes up for ""Swordfish""! I had to keep reminding myself that this was the same man who played Wolverine in ""X-Men"".

Forget what a lot of the pro critics have to say (in fact, it was a largely negative review by a well-known local critic that motivated us to go in the first place!)--because whether or not everything fits together, gets resolved, or is based in logic really doesn't matter.  Not only is the movie a delightful romantic comedy, but it's about doing the right thing, redemption, and seeing people for what they are--all important in a year that's been rather rough for most of us lately.  Yes, you've seen a lot of it before--but so what?  I'd love to see some  of ""Splash"", ""Sleepless in Seattle"", and ""You've Got Mail"" in every movie for which I fork out seven bucks.
Getting off the subject for a second, I do wish writers of time-travel movies would start checking out the most basic of facts.  ""Somewhere in Time"" comes to mind, where Chris Reeve romances Jane Seymour with music that was not written until 25 years later--or ""Fields of Dreams"", where the great left-handed batter Joe Jackson hits right-handed throughout.  Here, Leopold is transported into the present from 1876, but is an expert on ""La Boheme"".  I'll leave that one for you to figure out...:>)

1705186,4,B0000640VN,"Kate and Leopold is a fine movie if you go into the theater with the right expectations.
Don't expect a great storyline, logical science, or even complete causality. Don't expect it to be Jane Austen.
Kate and Leopold is a pleasant diversion, a place for Meg Ryan to look adorable and romantically helpless. It's a surprising showcase for Hugh Jackman, who pulls off a very respectable English accent and an excellent (for the material) acting performance. It has good (if not necessarily plausible) performances from Liev Schreiber, Bradley Whitford, and Breckin Meyer, and generates an all around feel good atmosphere, where even the lecherous boss comes off as a good man with foibles instead of the usual characatures of the genre.
While there is a little bit of depth to the movie, its best enjoyed as a frivolous date movie, so find someone special to take out to it, and get an extra large popcorn to share.",1008720000,8,914,4.828025477707007

Hugh Jackman is so amazing in this movie that it makes you think he's perfect which he undoubtably is. I assure you that every woman who comes out of the theatre, or at least a damn good portion of them, will be totally smitten with this guy and will be wondering just exactly where he's been all these years. He is a great actor with the most beautiful voice. Now for Meg Ryan. She does a damn good job herself... course that's what she's used to. But nevertheless, she pulls it off. The two have great chemistry onscreen. Well don't know whatelse to say except that I really hope you don't miss this because it was the best and I don't think anyone else but Hugh Jackman, could've pulled such an awesome performance.",1008720000,13,1018,4.27979274611399
1705188,4,B0000640VN,"This is not Meg Ryan's best film, but it is yet another highly enjoyable romantic comedy in the career of one of the most successful light comedy actresses of the past decade.  But this could be a breakout film for Hugh Jackman, who is easily one of the most likable and charismatic new actors on the scene today.  Easily the best thing about X-MEN was Jackman's portrayal of Wolverine.  He has also appeared in SWORDFISH and SOMEONE LIKE YOU, but after seeing this film, he is clearly a very versatile and talented actor, who deserves a lot of chances in a lot of different kinds of films.
The film is enhanced by an excellent supporting cast.  Both Liev Schreiber as Meg Ryan's ex-boyfriend and Breckin Meyer as her brother are extremely appealing.  But the film either falls or stands on the performances of Ryan and Jackman.  This is not, as I mentioned earlier, her best role, but even Meg Ryan at less than her very best is still quite good, and Hugh Jackman is enormously enjoyable.  Natasha Lyonne, who I love a lot, was pretty much wasted in her role as Ryan's secretary.
The movie will invariably be compared to other time travel movies.  It is a genre that has been more successful in the past than one might imagine, thanks to the BACK TO FUTURE series and the superb TIME AFTER TIME.  There are a couple of gigantic holes in the plot (one involves when a particular photograph could have been taken), but overall the film isn't hard to take as sci-fi.  I will say that the scenes set in 19th century New York are my favorite parts of the movie.  The initial scene takes place at a ceremony in which Washington Roeblings, the engineer who built the Brooklyn Bridge and son of the man who designed it, is dedicating (I think) the completion of the second tower of the bridge.  The look and feel is remarkable.  Looking at the masts of the ships in the water, I kept thinking of Walt Whitman's poem ""Crossing Brooklyn Ferry,"" which ferry the bridge superseded.  Most of the imagery was surely computer generated, but the whole scene was nevertheless remarkable to look at.
All in all, this movie was a lot of fun.  It won't be the greatest movie you have ever seen, but it certainly won't be the worst, and I think the vast majority of viewers will be convinced that they will have had a lot of fun.  And a message to Hollywood:  get Hugh Jackman in more movies!",1008547200,55,2372,4.491841491841492
