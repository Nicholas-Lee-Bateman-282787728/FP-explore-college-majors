3983476,5,B002T08R90,"I have been a fan of Ikki Tousen for sometime and I have found the action, silliness, seriousness of the Characters are displayed in a way to keep your attention glued to the screen. My only issue is having to read the subtitles... If the Director (Takashi Watanabe) in his infinite wisdom for making these types of movies, would think of us little Americans that cannot read or speak in foreign languages and edit the movies in english that would be great. I think this is one of the best serious that has ever hit the media stands.",1267574400,5,533,4.448979591836735

8379760,3,B002T08R90,"This is good. Volumes 1 and 2 are good. I think season one was better. I wish there was more of an explanation of which Chinese Three Kingdoms character each Ikki Tousen character represents - some are more obvious than others - especially the main characters - the problem is the anime doesn't give the names in the original Chinese renderings, but uses the Japanese versions (ie. Sou Sou for Cao Cao, etc) Overall a good anime and worth the watch - will be looking for season 3 next.",1439510400,,485,4.46067415730337
8379761,1,B002T08R90,"This is  not anime --It is still life with camera motion. It is a shame that any respectable studio would release this mess on the public. It is a Saturday morning 1960's presentation  Google ""Clutch Cargo"".",1438992000,,207,4.722222222222222
8379762,1,B002T08R90,"This series is a mess I wish I had returned it, but I waited a couple of weeks before I played the DVD. It stinks in every way. I reviewed Volume 1 it dose not get any better. This is drawing not animation only the lips move style.",1438992000,,231,3.8333333333333335
