8225986,4,B0002HOE8K,"Paul Rodriguez does a great job selecting these rising comedians. My only disapointment is he doesn't appear himself. He only hosts the show. But overall, this dvd was a blast! I loved every minute, especially the final comedian, Jual Villareal. If you're a latino comedy enthusiast, you're guaranteed to love this dvd.",1122940800,8,319,5.153846153846154
