8539835,2,B009D21UNM,"I totally agree with the other reviewer. This movie rips off so much dialogue from the other Jaws movies, and I haven't seen a single Tiger shark (other than a caught one, and one in a swimming scene) this entire movie! Lol Great Whites are pretty distinctive and used in over 9O% of the shark scenes. Someone didn't do their homework....It was funny though!",1479513600,,358,4.609375

8539837,4,B009D21UNM,"'Cruel Jaws' (1994), also known as Jaws 5 or Jaws '95 is one incredible piece of work from Italian trash maestro Bruno Mattei, hiding behind the `William Snyder' name.

Not only does it rip off entire scenes and dialogue from Jaws, it also steals the regatta idea from Jaws 2, the marine park setting from Jaws 3 and even re-uses footage from a previous Italian Jaws knock-off  'The Last Shark/Great White' (1980)!!

Mattei hurls everything but the kitchen sink at the viewer to keep them interested- there's a dodgy Hulk Hogan-lookalike as the 'Quint' character, there's a little girl in a wheelchair whom Mattei frequently zooms in on to capture her brilliant acting at tense moments, there's the recalcitrant mayor, terrible acting and dialogue all round, an irrelevant mafia subplot involving cheap mafia goons whose fashion is a criminal offence in itself!

The shark is supposedly a tiger shark, but random shots of real and fake sharks resembling Great Whites are thrown in with no attempt to match. The shark roars and hisses and apparently 'lives' in a shipwreck which was a top secret Navy experiment gone wrong, at one point a bit of the Star Wars score is even thrown in!
I've only ever seen a Japanese VHS of this in English with Japanese subtitles, Universal blocks the release in English-speaking countries just in case the audience recovers from their hysterical laughter and mistakes 'Cruel Jaws' for a lost Spielberg masterpiece.

Absolute gold entertainment!, but I wouldn't pay $25.00 for it.",1418515200,3,1512,4.984126984126984
