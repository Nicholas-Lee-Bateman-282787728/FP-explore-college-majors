8685232,5,B00OWXXGR0,"This dvd has 3 workout on it. Two are for bottom activation and one is a core. You need a loop band and a pilates style ball for these workouts.
#1 workout lasts 18 minutes uses the band and is all floor work. #2 is 14 minutes and is standing using the band. #3 is the core workout at 32 minutes uses the ball and band. I split the core workout into 2-16 minutes sessions. That was very doable.
I would rate this an intermediate level dvd. It is pretty intense especially when using the bands. You could increase the strength of your band as you get stronger or follow the modifier and do not use equipment. Pretty accessible for most people.
What I love about this dvd is the physical therapy/functional feel. So while working on strength you are getting a program for a functional and full core (not just abs).
Patricia's demeanor is encouraging, friendly and knowledgeable. Her training shows here.",1477094400,7,901,4.533742331288344
8685233,5,B00OWXXGR0,"I am LOVING this new DVD from Patricia Friberg!!!  Not only will you get an excellent core and bottom workout, but you will know you are doing it right since the DVD includes an ""alignment"" portion.  Patricia is incredibly motivational and provides timely prompts/cues to keep you going...even when your bottom and abs are ready to quit.  This is a tough workout, but Patricia includes examples of ways to make it doable for any exerciser.  I like that it has three different sections, so I can get in a workout no matter how much or little time I have.  I tend not to love exercise DVDs after the first 3 or 4 times doing them, but I'm now going on Week 6 of using this DVD and I'm really seeing and feeling results.  Thanks, Patricia, for the excellent workout!",1435708800,4,763,4.453237410071942
