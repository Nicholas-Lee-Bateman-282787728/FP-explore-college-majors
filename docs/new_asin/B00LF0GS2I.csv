8665533,5,B00LF0GS2I,"If you enjoy seeing and hearing Jonas Kaufmann sing, then you will play this DVD over and over, although, I think, he just misses a couple of notes in the title song. This is a live concert recording from the ""Grosse Rundfunkhaus"" in the former East Berlin with the Radio Symphonic Orchestra Berlin under the direction of conductor Jochen Rieder. Soprano Julia Kleiter partners Kaufmann for three of the fourteen selections and I would have loved to see and hear more of her in this concert as she complements Kaufmann so well. She gives a delightful performance and her voice is a treat to my ears. These old operetta hits from the 1930's is ""feel good"" music and it leaves you feeling energized and elated. I have no reservations recommending this DVD to any music lover.",1423872000,2,773,4.6911764705882355
8665534,5,B00LF0GS2I,"If I could give this recording 10 stars I would.  What a selection of oldies, but goodies!  And the documentary about Berlin in the '30s was very well done.  If you have seen any of Kaufmann's opera DVDs you will know just how good a singing actor he is.  If you haven't, treat yourself.  He has done Italian, French, and superb Wagner.  The designation of ""world's greatest tenor"" is well deserved now that Placido Domingo has turned baritone and conductor.",1421539200,3,458,4.6625
