8061465,5,B0009IWFYM,great tour of this cave-it was almost as good as visiting the cave in person-it had great color photography,1521244800,,107,4.684210526315789
8061466,5,B0009IWFYM,"Not sure what DVD the other, negative reviewer, watched, but doesn't sound like it was this one. I thought the production values on this approx. 1-hour program were fine, and it did not seem ""dated"" at all. Starts with about 15 minutes of stuff to see ""on the surface"" before you head underground. Well filmed with just about the right amount of narration. I'm rather surprised you can't buy this new, although I would guess they must have this or some other tour DVD for sale in the gift shop at the cavern.",1498953600,,508,4.473118279569892
8061467,1,B0009IWFYM,"I bought this because I am interested in the stalagpipe organ.  The DVD is a poor copy from a travel video that must be from the 70s, given the hair styles.  The image is very grainy and the narration nearly ridiculous.  Don't waste your money or time with this.",1492214400,,262,4.3061224489795915
