1830693,5,B00008979D,"We always hear about ""chickflicks"" and such but never a similar type of movie for a man.  Well this is one of those movies that is just that.  It is a guy version of a chick flick and believe me, this movie has heart.

While most people have never heard of this movie, it is a touching story about a man who raises his Grandson and remains there for him throughout his life when he needs him.

This movie is about their relationship and the bond they share.  The love that is shown but as a man would.  While on the outside they might appear tough and gruff, it is in their actions and sacrifice that we see their true love shine.

The acting is just top notch as well as the script.  It comes across as very real and authintic.

This is one of my personal all time favorite movies.  It is real, it is touching, and no matter how many times I have seen it... I cry like a baby at the end.

I would recomend this movie to anybody but especially men who had a father or grandfather that was very close to them.  The best ""guyflick"" ever.",1233878400,4,1035,4.0945273631840795
1830694,5,B00008979D,"This movie will make you laugh and cry. The message is so beautiful,i.e., how deeply people can love and care for one another. It's so refreshing, and makes you want to go out and be a better person, especially, to those most important to you - your family. Great family movie! Great message of what is truly important in life. This movie should be re-released. Acting, Peter Falk, Sweeney, soundtarck, and cinematogrophy all 'tops.' Especially with all that's going on today; Roomates will rejuvinate your soul! Enjoy, Bravo - Encore!!!",1191196800,3,537,4.977777777777778
1830695,5,B00008979D,I ordered this movie because Peter Faulk is one of my very favorites...hands down. This movie is a treasure.....did not seem contrived...totally natural. Falk's voice is very soothing to me and he shows how it is possible to age in style. A very good movie to watch over and over. Thank YOU!!!,1167782400,,293,4.653846153846154
1830696,5,B00008979D,"I've seen this movie twice, but each time it touched me. I agree with previous review that this movie is overlooked and underapreciated. This movie is about simple, hardworking Polish immigrant grandfather who takes responsiblity for raising his grandson. His ways, quirks,strong influence on granson to better himself and strong love that makes grandfather and grandson sacrifice for each other, love and care that touches heart and makes us see what life is really all about.",1133049600,2,477,5.2894736842105265
1830697,4,B00008979D,"Unfortunately, this gem is one of those movies where people look at the box and just pass up. A big mistake. Although ""Roommates"" starts out as what appears to be light comedy. Peter Falk's portrayal of a cantankerous old man is just great throughout. But as the movie progresses, and down-to-earth hardships such as the loss of family members becomes part of the story, the characters become deeper, and the truly touching love of an old man for his family, and the love of a man for his grandfather come through. It is a beautiful film that will make you laugh out loud, make you cry buckets of tears, break your heart and then repair it again. You cannot help but get absorbed in the characters and relationships in ""Roommates"". Recommended viewing!",1076544000,23,752,4.704545454545454
1830698,4,B00008979D,"It's a shame that this movie's largely overlooked by critics and audience alike. However, many people who happen to ""stumble"" across this movie will be pleasantly surprised. OK, I'm biased because I'm in the movie. But as an avid movie-goer, I have to say this is one of the better family movies in the past 10 years. The relationships are real and touching. Even though I knew -- from the filming -- how it was going to end, the tears that came down my cheeks caught me by surprise. I wish more people would see it and realize what a great movie this is. Peter Falk and D.B.Sweeney have great chemistry. You also get to see other great actors such as Julianne Moore (unfortunately, for some reason, they always fail to mention this film in her bios).",1048896000,9,751,4.489051094890511

1830729,5,B00008979D,Great Movie!!! Peter Falk is a great actor.  I have enjoyed all his acting. This story started with him being an immigrant from Poland and believed in family sticking together no matter what happens.  Grandpa took on raising a little boy by working as a baker. The grandson takes care of his grandfather later.  I have watched this movie  many times and enjoyed it each time. I hope you can enjoy it as much as i do.,1443830400,,416,4.363636363636363

1830760,3,B00008979D,"Peter Falk's makeup wasn't believable and sort of ruined the movie for me.  It reminded me of Jackass's ""Bad Grandpa"" - nothing subtle.  I was unimpressed with the writing and found little to endear me to the Peter Falk character.  Sure he came through and was a stand up grandpa but not that loveable.
But grandparents raising children is a good topic and there's plenty worthwhile in the movie.",1425945600,,396,4.7101449275362315

It is one of those under rated hidden gems that you want to watch again and again.  Peter Falk steals the show with his hilarious portayal of  the Polish grandfather.  If you have any Polish relatives or heritage or even friends you will like and appreciate this characterization even more. To this day I still remember and steal Rocky's line in the very beginning of the movie ""I'll bury you all!!""lol  Julianne Moore is wonderful in this movie as always.",1421884800,,599,4.4495412844036695

I just rented it again last weekend, and watched it for the very first time again (Which was the very first time I had used Amazon Video on Demand). It is a very good story about how families should always stay together no matter how much you struggle in life. I used to not enjoy watching movie that focus on elderly people's plot, but the older I get now I am really starting to enjoy them now a days. If you enjoyed this movie, I would also recommend ""Folks"", ""Grumpy Old Men"", ""Grumpier Old Men"", and ""Secondhand Lions"" Peter Smith",1382832000,,647,4.2682926829268295

1830821,5,B00008979D,"I love this movie! Who would've created such an honest story about an immigrant child, arriving at Ellis Island after his parents were killed in Poland, with one theme running through his mind--family--if it was not about those who experienced it.  As a third generation Polish-Russian-Austrian/German-American person myself, I easily related to Rocky's disposition.  However difficult Rocky's connection to family at a time of crisis, the more he clung to family values, like a clenched fist.  Keep the conversation short, and make the decisive move without contemporary American debate.  He transfers his toughness, keeping people at arm's length growing up as an orphan, onto his likewise orphaned grandson. Rocky teaches his grandson to be street smart, but at the same time instructing Michael to be respectful of people, and foremost, the nuns.  And, he is there for him for as long as he needs him, but Michael has a lifelong struggle to figure him out. When Michael gives Rocky probably the only birthday present he's ever received, and how the connection was made, clearly respect was forming somewhere in his mind, and in return receives affirmation of his dreams to become a cardio-thoracic surgeon from his grandfather.  Its odd--so see this movie to understand this!  Life and death, and confusing passion in between, ends the conversation--settled.  Stand by these truths and don't make it complicated--this had to be based on a true story.",1346112000,,1454,5.210300429184549

1830827,4,B00008979D,"Entertaining over-sentimentalized tale of the grandfather who adopts his orphaned grandson. The late Peter Falk manages to maintain a fair degree of individuality from amidst various forms of stereotyped elder-behavior. Julianne Moore shines as the grown-up grandson's wife, D.B Sweeney is good as the young lover and husband but struggles when forced to play a widower. Ellen Burstyn is allowed to stay just short of being the evil mother-in-law. Major problem is the rapid progress from childhood to top young surgeon for D. B. Sweeney's character. Peter Falk's character, Grandfather and great-grandfather simply requires an old person to go to an ancient. Little change but a certain slowing down and physical deterioration is required. He does it well. Sweeney, having to progress from childhood to a man who is expected to survive considerable difficulties is not given all the ammunition he needs to make the transition.
