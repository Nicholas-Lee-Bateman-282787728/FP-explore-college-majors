2667828,5,B000JBXP6G,I LOVE LOVE LOVE this movie it's so horribly amazing I was so happy to find a DVD of it I had an old VHS reviewers copy I got from my father when I was in highschool and have wanted it since. Doom Asylum is truly campy deliciousness in all its glory.,1292976000,2,250,3.826923076923077
2667829,5,B000JBXP6G,Classic movie to see a young Kristen Davis in a bathing suit sunning outside of a mental asylum....,1265328000,2,99,4.555555555555555
2667830,4,B000JBXP6G,"Hard to find title is as cheesy as a pizza in Wisconsin. Awful dialog, lame plot situations and characters who do dumb things. So its a perfect 80s slasher movie. Looks great on DVD and the trailers that come with it are hard to resist.",1204156800,,236,4.266666666666667
2667831,3,B000JBXP6G,"Decent, if awkward low-budget entry in the slasher genre. Poor dialog, lackluster pacing, not much panache, but the condemned insane asylum that's provided as backdrop for the young stars and starlets to run amuck through before getting hack'd n' slashed is inspired. But seriously, the main reason to check out this horror relic (from the direct-to-VHS days) is Patty ""Frankenhooker"" Mullen and her nerdy friend (Charlotte from Sex & The City). If you're a fan of bad 80's horror, add another star.",1182902400,2,499,5.097560975609756
2667832,2,B000JBXP6G,"Here we have a fairly pedestrian entry into the horror genre, but one not without its charm.  We have a gang of teenagers sight seeing in an abandoned asylum, populated by a deranged killer.
By and large, it's a typical 80's horror film.  It's largely comedic.  The gore factor isn't remarkable by any means, but not bad.  The best part of the movie is the all female angry political cheese-goth band.  They're a hoot.  Beyond that it's all here.  The cheesy 80's goth band, the ridiculous plot twist, and a thoroughly respectable pointless excuse for the topless girl shot.  Worth viewing if you're a horror fanatic and you have an hour and a half you were going to waste anyway.",1029110400,5,680,4.608333333333333
8149580,5,B000JBXP6G,"Its fantastic in how horrible it was! this was made in a time when any horror movie got green lit and they swung for the fences with this one. too bad they only tipped the ball and got a single. Any movie where a man is killed by putting him in a broken dishwasher (I don't think anyone knew it was a dishwasher) and comes out in a bloody box is great. If that makes no sense to you, then watch it and learn!",1518566400,,408,3.869047619047619
8149581,3,B000JBXP6G,"What do you get when you combine a nerd, the supposedly hot girl, the jock, the brainy chick, a token, a Madonna wannabe, a soft hearted but supposedly a hard rocker and a girl with an annoying laugh? You get the some of the ingredients of a cheesy horror flick. I kinda knew what I was getting into when I started the film and right off the bat we are introduced to some bad acting with an out of control car scene where the driver and passenger are throwing their arms everywhere when they have enough time to control their car (aka overacting). Scene really didn't make sense. What makes it worse was the next scene, the two are in the grass crying in pain following the next scene where driver is getting an autopsy and he looked like he was burned, which there was no fire?

This is one of those horror flicks that I think originally was suppose to be a serious horror film but ended up not making sense along the line so it changed into a horror comedy. There are some terrible lines in the movie such as when the wannabe Madonna girl was getting hers by our killer, she said ""Your being violent! I want peace! I voted for Regan"", I never laughed so hard at a horror movie then that line. What difference does it make who you voted for and why would that end up in the script. Smh. There is some more over acting when the guy Darnell and the soft but hard rocker girl are having a day dream moment and they run through the field of weeds and grass to hug eachother, in the second day dream sequence, she looks like she almost tripped in slow motion, how do you almost trip in slow motion??? The final scene I want to reference is the brainy girl and the supposedly hot chick are laying in the grass tanning and they see the jock hanging from the ledge with the annoying laughing girl looking down at him. The one girl says ""isn't that monk hanging from the ledge?"" And the other girl says ""yeah, don't worry he won't fall. He's fine"" really? Also just be prepared for the girl with the annoying laugh as she does it every few minutes and it just makes you feel she should have gotten first!

All in all, if you like 80's horror movies and love horror comedy movies, you should check this one out. The killer is not scary, but he does have some one liners. I'm giving this a 3 out of 5 because even though it was cheezy, it still made for a good time and some good laughs.",1517875200,,2377,4.2105263157894735
8149582,4,B000JBXP6G,"I've seen much worse. It's a film that's willing to make fun of itself, which is nice in this genre. It's intentionally overdone in spots, reminded me of Troma movies that I've seen. Not a movie to take seriously, but if you're into b-grade horror/comedy, it's better than many.",1451260800,,278,4.6938775510204085
8149583,5,B000JBXP6G,"I can't really be mad at this movie. I knew it was going to be bad, don't get me wrong, but I'm a fan of bad movies. But what I didn't know was that this movie would feel nearly identical to every screenplay I wrote when I was a precociously pretentious 15 year old in high school who wanted to make his own horror movie.

At first when I started watching this movie and it didn't come to me right away. I thought ""Wow, the dialogue is awful,"" (beat) ""But then again the special effects are pretty good."" But then the main characters show up and they start giving some really bizarre exposition, like the main female lead calling her love interest ""Mom"" (for reasons I'll let you watch and judge) and the slightly reserved girl who constantly talks about psychiatry. But then it hit me! This is a satire. I didn't know that when I bought the digital video which just said ""Horror/Comedy,"" I was thinking in the ""Evil Dead 2"" sense of horror-comedy, but this is a flat out satire of slasher flicks in general.

You've got all the stereotypes in one movie:

The dumb blonde
the indecisive jock
the annoying nerd
the ""smart girl""
the tough girl who might be gay
and of course:
the black guy who dies first.

The dialogue is deliciously awful, like, not even Mystery Science Theater 3000 could touch this because it's already trying too hard to be satirical. The main villain is a deranged coroner who lives on the grounds of this abandoned insane asylum where he regularly kills trespassing teenagers in creative ways, one of which was obviously seen by Sean Cunningham and written down for the then-future film ""Jason X"" (the one where Jason is in space). The acting is so below par that I'd say the director TOLD the actors to act as poorly as they could because of the weird comical nature of the movie. The pacing's actually pretty good once we get to the first kill (the black guy-- it follows that trope) and from there on out it's pretty much just mischief and mayhem the rest of the movie. It did manage to break the tradition of ""the killer takes them at night"" because the entire movie takes place in the middle of a broadly lit, sunny July afternoon, I'm not sure if this was due to budget restraints that prevented them from filming at night or if they just wanted to try something different, but it works well, either way.

One thing that bugged me when watching it was the slow realization that all the actors in this movie are now my parents' age. And it made me wonder what my parents were doing in the mid 1980s right before they decided to have me. I don't know if either of them were involved with indie film, but I'm going to be calling them up a little later to make some inquiries-- just in case.

Other than that, the movie really appealed to me because the script felt like something I would try to write when I was a teenager-- the movie even features clips from some old 1930s horror movies, which, like many aspiring and wannabe teenage filmmakers you tend to watch a lot of at that age. All in all, it's a dumb but harmless little independent piece of horror from the 1980s that was totally worth the purchase.",1438732800,6,3135,4.424610051993068
8149584,5,B000JBXP6G,"If you follow my reviews, you'll already know that the 1985 British production&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Slaughter-High/dp/B00EI1S4NW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Slaughter High</a>&nbsp;is to me one of the best partly tongue-in-cheek slasher movie spoofs ever made, not to mention one of my all-time favorite films period.  It set a precedent for combining horror, gore, comedy, and all-around fun that few have ever matched.  It had a very limited theatrical release and then became a hit in the home video market shortly thereafter.

Another movie emerged two years later that was clearly influenced by the former but that was never even released theatrically, that being the 1987 direct-to-video slasher parody ""Doom Asylum.""

So many scenes and the general plot in the latter seem to be modeled on the classic ""Slaughter High.""  They both take place in a big abandoned building (in ""Slaughter High"" it was a school, in ""Doom Asylum,"" a mental institution) in which a crazed, horribly disfigured killer offs the young, attractive and energetic cast one by one.  They both are done in a satirical fashion that shows that even stomach-churning gore can be used as a means for myriad quips and one-liners.  And they both have an abundant level of comedic timing and an all-around FUN factor that makes them always a joy to watch (and rewatch... And rewatch...)

""Doom Asylum"" was directed by Richard Friedman, who had previously worked primarily in the television horror market, having directed various episodes of ""Tales from the Darkside"" and ""Friday the 13th: the Series"" in 1986-87.  Judging by the fact that references to heavy metal bands like Metallica, Slayer and Ozzy are spray-painted on the walls of the asylum in this film, my guess is that Friedman worked with a mostly young, inexperienced crew with (very) little money to spare but mega talent on display and a real desire to deliver the goods.  These ""goods"" include a wacky all-girl punk/noise band (led by ""B"" movie queen Ruth Collins) that practice in the asylum, a scene-stealing performance by ""Sex and the City's"" then 22-year-old Kristin Davis (in her first film role) that clearly shows the makings for a real star, and the gorgeous, eye-catching special make-up effects by Vincent J. Guastini.  The cast appears to be as young and inexperienced as the film crew was, making for what is like a big party in slasher movie-dom that the viewer is always a part of and in on the joke.

An extremely obscure title in its day, ""Doom Asylum"" has since built a well-deserved cult underground following.  Code Red released it on DVD not once but twice in the 2000s, the initial pressing in January 2007 and then a reissue a mere year and a half later in the summer of 2008, the latter bearing a much more prominent and much sexier picture of Kristin Davis shown on the cover.  The latter version (the one I own) is the harder to find of the two by far.  Code Red seemed to keep it in print for about 15 minutes tops and now it's rarer than natural cubic zirconia on the internet, as prices for the few remaining copies on Amazon currently range from $150 to nearly $200 (!).  Luckily, a DVD-r version is also now available for sale on Amazon but the second Code Red version is the one to get, not just for the cover, but it boasts a far superior remastered picture and an 11-minute featurette which constitutes an interview with Friedman and the producer.

All in all, fans of serious horror like ""the Shining"" and ""Maniac"" may find little appeal in an obvious parody of the genre, but those just out to witness some great gore, see a couple of boobs bared (courtesy of Ms. Collins), share a laugh with the young cast and just have a great time will find much to savor in ""Doom Asylum.""  For late '80s direct-to-video horror, it's a true diamond in the rough and just might be worth shelling out the serious moolah for it that it is currently commanding.",1400284800,,3967,4.895522388059701
8149585,4,B000JBXP6G,"Doom Asylum is a hidden gem.

It's about a attorney ""Mitch"" and his girl ""Judy"" celebrating his victory off a court room scam. As their driving they crash and are seriously injured. His girlfriend dies on the scene and loses a hand..but the man lives ""even though his pronounced dead"". When the Mitch is getting a autopsy ""he looks like Fred Kruger now"" he comes to live and kills the two coroners. He then flees to the abandoned asylum and calls it home which was by where he got into the car accident. He keeps his dead girlfriend hand with him and reserves it...I forgot how he got it though. Well years later some teens go up to the asylum because the legend goes that there's a killer there they want to test there wits. So Mitch kills the teens off one by one with medical instruments but one teen catches his eye...bring back memories of his girlfriend Judy.

The film is all shot in daylight so it's not really scary at all. But the kills are creative and fun to look at..because the killer always gives a corny punchline after the kill. The dialogue is pretty terrible...but that what gives the movie charm. But still there's a lot of funny scenarios and head scratching moments. It'll defiantly give you a good time.",1395100800,3,1226,4.493273542600897

It's the guiltiest of guilty pleasures. High price tag but again it's OOP and a must have! Do yourself a favor and pick this up!",1373414400,2,501,4.28421052631579

It's as if those responsible were out driving one day, saw the crumbling ASYLUM of the title, and said, ""I know, let's make a movie!"" We get the spooky, decrepit location, filled w/ goofy characters, stalked by a disfigured killer. The ""script"" is as bare-bones as it could possibly get. Still, it does have enough wacky, mindless charm to make it (just) endurable. Plus, the ""drill-to-the-forehead"" and ""saw-to-the-face"" sequences should keep the gorehundts happy. Kristin Davis (BLACKTOP) and Patty Mullen (FRANKENHOOKER) definitely add to the viewing experience! Worth a watch...",1298160000,,675,5.201834862385321
