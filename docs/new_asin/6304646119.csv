7874991,5,6304646119,"This is the CBS Sunday morning special aired a few days after Kuralt passed away.  It is touching, to say the least.  Watching each vignette, you gain appreciation for Kuralt's rare talent.  Unlike other reporters who tend to burn their bridges, he left a wake of goodwill.  From the man in NC who devoted his retired years to fixing bicycles to lend out to area children, to the Afghan who got married and became a citizen in one weekend, to the stirring rendition of founding father oratory that led to the signing of the Declaration of Independence -- we are given a multifaceted look at what it means to appreciate the finer points of life.  Bravo.",1161216000,4,652,4.586206896551724
