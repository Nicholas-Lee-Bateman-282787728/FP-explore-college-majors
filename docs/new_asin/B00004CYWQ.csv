7920216,1,B00004CYWQ,"This movie attempts to be mysterious, but the leads are not convincing in their roles. Silver's part seems to be far and away too much of a stretch for him to get his talent around and the female lead has never been what I consider, convincing!",1416960000,,244,4.326086956521739

7920219,4,B00004CYWQ,"If you know about an ""Enemy of the people""  or the powerful film ""Bad day at Black Rock"" in the middle Fifties, you will understand why this little drama in a small village of taciturn and isolated people in Maine will shock your senses and your humanity, when the intolerance and prejudices being a matter of doubtful moral, according to wrought ethics principles in the name of the preservation of the good manners and the love for truth make become a very dangerous cocktail.

A civilized journalist honored  with the Pulitzer Award, who is just taking a rest with his family will know about a sad incident where a gay is considered the main suspect of the murder of his close friend.

The sum of prejudices and the way this population decides to assume ""the justice"" is very unusual. And our journalist will be ""the private eye""  to solve this entangled case.

Roy Silver in the role of his lifetime. A fine cast that included Christopher Plummer and James Coburn completed a movie that got its aim.",1148774400,3,1003,4.638418079096045
