It starts with a steam locomotive (now extinct) pulling coaches out of a tunnel. Its only an egg. Yes, Maam. Will this married couple live on a farm to raise chickens and eggs? [Owning your own business was still common in those day, like a corner grocery store.] Beautiful country. [Note the dirt roads.] They arrive at their house. No running water, no Frigidaire. [A husband who quits his job then buys a farm without telling his wife? Things have changed.] A leaky roof? No central heating? [A wide-open window on a rainy day? You can tell who was raised on a farm.] Theres a lot of work to do. Hauling gallons of water from the well, nailing new shingles on the roof. A neighbor comes for a visit (and borrows lumber). A horse-drawn carriage [nearly extinct today]. Crabs for sale? [Near the sea.] Gathering eggs is tricky. A salesman comes by.

They get a dog - for free! The hired man talks about his hopes. Betty gets a ride and learns about her neighbors. The sign by the Kettles place has a warning. Free range chickens - and children. [Wearing shoes?] Ma Kettle clears the table. A bell summons the family for dinner. Pa Kettle says Grace. [Note the soup and slice of bread.] Betty has a headache and must leave Harriet Putnams home. Now look what youve done! Then it rains. Guns are needed to kill a cougar. Sport won't hunt. Newly hatched chicks need constant care. A tree is cut down, where will it fall? Bob and Betty have a formal dinner, they dress up. Mr. Henty arrives for a visit, looks around, then leaves. Harriet comes by and asks for help from Bob. [Note the old-style top knot hairstyle on Ma Kettle.] There is a dance where neighbors meet. Never mind. Bob made a donation for the food. Betty meets more people. [There is comedy here.] So it was you. Bob talked to Harriet. There is a fire at the Kettles home, it spread.

Men dig a trench to contain the fire. The wind shifts. We see why farm buildings are placed far apart. But their neighbors have a plan to help. Each makes a donation of things they can spare to help Bob and Betty. [Note what Pa Kettle donates.] Later they visit the County Fair. There is competition on products. Bob talks to Harriet. Will he make a mistake? Mrs. Devlin wins a prize. Betty faints, they send for Bob. Whats her schedule? Betty meets another neighbor, Emily. She used to live at Bettys house until there was a problem. Betty gets a note from Bob, and leaves. Months go by, she returns to Bob. Things have changed, she is surprised to learn about the news. There is a happy ending. Betty has a surprise for Bob, she is on schedule. There is an emergency at the chicken house. [This skimps on the daily care needed for chickens.]

I never read the book by Betty MacDonald, but it must have been a best-seller to be followed by a movie. Did Hollywood change the story to add drama? Ive heard that only a girl raised on a farm makes a good wife for a farmer. [Note the lack of electricity in those days, before the REA brought it into the country. No radio either. They used to make tube radios that would run on batteries for areas without electricity. Transistor radios became available in the mid-1950s.] The 1920s-1930s has many people moving from cities to rural areas, reversing the trend since the 19th century. That changed after the war. Note how people helped one another, as needed.",1498694400,,3377,4.459546925566343
