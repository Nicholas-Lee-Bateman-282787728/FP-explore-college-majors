8289456,3,B001CU7RYE,"Typical history channel show, but if you wanna see something unethical that started ethical data in healthcare, this show is for you.  Unit 731 was ridiculous, heartless and soulless people...",1521936000,,192,5.4
8289457,5,B001CU7RYE,"Based on the research of Professor Sheldon H. Harris of California State University, this documentary is informative, revealing, and quite frankly quite disturbing, but it should be required viewing for high school history classes.  The lesson learned should be that these war crimes should never happen again.",1490659200,,310,5.595744680851064

8289460,3,B001CU7RYE,I give credit to the History Channel for touching on this taboo subject but I thought it was a cursory examination of a international conspiracy to hide Japans hidden holocaust. Japan perpetrated atrocities not only on the chinese people of Manchuria but also imported close to one million Koreans to death Camps during World War II. Oddly it failed to make a single mention of this fact .One can only assume fear of reperations to Korea and strong U.S. relations have helped omit this bitter tyranny in history Japan has yet to admit.,1266019200,7,535,4.763440860215054
8289461,5,B001CU7RYE,"It reveals so many facts unfortunately not so many people know about them (Unless you are Japanese or Chinese!)
I personally liked it since I am one of the people who likes to know the real truth not just what we see or hear in the news.",1039737600,2,237,4.0638297872340425
