1324382,4,B00003CY24,"""The King is Alive,"" is problematic in a very good way.  It's a Dogme film, which means it was made under a set of rules that holds the film maker to natural light, ambient sound, actual locations, and possibly a few more restrictions.  Working within that format the director, Kristian Levring, has made something quite remarkable.  His location is the Namibian desert, and he has captured the splendor of the light, color, and landscape quite well.  The intrusion of a soundtrack is blissfully missing, and the only music in the film leaks from a set of headphones for a disc player, lasts about 5 seconds, and works with great effect.  Mr. Levring also made good casting choices, and the cast does a good job except for a few moments that are miserably improvised.  The big problems are with the script.  There's one plot hole that you could drive the broken down bus through, and a conclusion that's not conclusive - it's as if the production just ran out of film, or tape.  Otherwise, it's entirely believable that a group of people disintegrating in a survival situation would choose to take their minds off their impossible situation by enacting a drama, especially because their situation is one of waiting rather than action; and it's conceivable that ""King Lear"" would be the drama, but it seems to me that if that's the set up then the play within the play should have some relevance to the play itself, and though Lear contains madness and betrayal, the connections are tenuous at best.  Anytime you let Shakespeare into the picture you raise the audience's expectations for a work that will illuminate the master's vision, or vice versa.  Unfortunately, neither occurs.  The study of survivors in extrema is not enhanced by the use of ""King Lear,"" and ""King Lear"" is not enhanced by the situation - or the film.  Too bad, because it was an interesting concept.  Given that, the film is worth seeing.  It's certainly better than most of what Hollywood has to offer, and is a great example of how less can be more.",1039651200,14,2025,4.732193732193732

7918419,5,B00003CY24,"there are a few 'negative' reviews of this Masterpiece of Dogme 95 filmmaking. much like their previous film 'Festen', this film is made 'even more' realistic by the 'groups' restrictive standards.
I will not 'give any spoilers' of the plot other than the 'blurb' one of the characters being stuck in a desert and wiling their time by doing an old Shakespeare play about the 'monstrous greedy negativity' of a royal family called 'the Lears'.

the actors are 'tremendously astounding' and the location 'phenomenal'. the story is 'tight' and really 'brilliant'.

Lost European travelers reluctantly participate in Shakespeare's ""King Lear"" with revealing developments and plot twists. It deals with all the questions of King Lear and more.

7918423,5,B00003CY24,"For these tourists stranded in a desert village, staging an amateur production of ""King Lear"" is a very minor platform to expose their emotional desperation.  A lesser film would have made it all about the play.  This one realizes that each human loses civility or sanity at his or her own unique pace that doesn't require a ""leader"" or ""followers.""  There is no detail here that reminds me of any other movie or book, which is quite amazing considering the subject.",1359590400,,466,4.728395061728395
7918424,2,B00003CY24,"I'm a fan of survival films, especially desert survival films like ""Flight of the Pheonix"" and ""Sands of the Kalahari."" Other films could partially fit this description as well, such as ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" ""Sahara,"" ""The English Patient"" and even the recent ""Mummy"" flicks.

""The King is Alive"" is such a film. A bunch of travelers get stuck in the desolate Namibian desert and conduct Shakespeare's play ""King Lear"" to pass the time and keep their sanity.

""The King is Alive"" is a Dogme 95 film wherein the director is bound by various restrictions, such as actual locations, natural light, no soundtrack or special effects. This is not necessarily a bad thing; in fact, it could well lend a gritty realism to the picture.

Unfortunately ""The King is Alive"" is a colossal bore. The characters are all incredibly unlikable; the story is dreary, slow and boring. The reenactment of ""King Lear"" comes across unbelievable and pretentious. The film basically shows the WORST in humanity and hence comes across negative, hopeless and pessimistic. Despite the beautiful Namibian photography, this is a very UGLY film.

Want proof? One girl fatally poisons another woman for no important reason and an aging man literally urinates on a dying woman (!!). Need I say more?

Needless to say, if you're loooking for a hope-affirming film that will testify to the endurance, greatness and triumph of the human spirit, this is not it.

I'm not suggesting that all films have to be optimistic in nature, after all, I'm a fan of some fairly solemn films (e.g. ""Apocalypse Now,"" ""Runaway Train""), but this is ridiculous. I'd hate to meet the screenwriter because, whoever it is, he or she must be a very UGLY person.

I give one star for the gorgeous cinematography, half a star for Jennifer Jason Leigh, the only remotely likable person, and half a star for the gritty realism.

I saw the film twice and literally threw it away after the second viewing. Why not sell it or give it away? Because it's morally irresponsible to pass along garbage.

Oh, by the way, the end credits rip-off the credits sequence of ""Apocalypse Now."" Perhaps the director felt he had an equally great film on his hands. Not even close.",1153958400,3,2227,4.839473684210526
7918425,5,B00003CY24,"This film turns around the study of the several sociological human reactions under edge knife conditions. The play of Lehar in the middle of the desert is just one more device to explore the inner soul of every human being in that hopeless place.
An extraordinary performance of Jeniffer Jason Leigh.
In this argumental line there's a film of Buuel titled El angel exterminador , that is very closed related to this one.",1086307200,,420,4.767123287671233
7918426,1,B00003CY24,"This ""experimental"" movie about 11 people who get lost in the desert, managing to survive in a difficult and unusual situation, is a missed attempt at trying to examine the human condition. Shakespeare`s play ""King Lear"" is a central element here, as the filmmaker tries to use it as a starting point to study its characters ideas, dramas, reactions and motivations, however this doesn`t quite work as well as it should and ends up being a pretentious, long and lifeless movie. There`s a promising dramatic tension in the beginning and some actors try to achieve something, but it ultimately fails and goes nowhere. The directing is weak as it should since this is a ""Dogma"" movie, one that doesn`t use artificial resources to enhance the lightning, scenery, direction or wardrobe, but here it just seems poor, uninteresting and unfinished. The characters are dull and despicable (I understand that`s the idea but they didn`t grab my attention) and the plot moves at a snail`s pace, becoming empty and dry just like the desert landscape where the movie was made. The King is dead.",1075248000,5,1080,4.93956043956044
7918427,5,B00003CY24,"""A group of people stranded in the desert decide to stage King Lear"" does not begin to summarize this powerful and challenging film, which shows how extremity reveals both flaws and strengths of our characters.  One of the stranded characters, who has unresolved issues with his own daughter, attempts to convince the other characters to stage ""Lear,"" or as much of it as he can remember and write down.  This attempt proceeds haltingly against crisis incidents between the various characters and against fragmented revelations of character that have the allusive quality of Japanese haiku.  Finally, the cast does not so much stage ""Lear"" as become ""Lear.""
The story's resolution resonates deeply with the ""Lear"" theme while avoiding allegory or simplistic, one-to-one correspondences.  There are disturbing, even shocking moments, and characters do not go unscathed, but there are also small moments of redemption.  At the conclusion, I was left with that sense of surprise and inevitability that marks the most excellent drama.  The Dogme 95 emphasis on actor improvisation worked well for me in this depiction of a situation which, in real life, would require improvisation for survival.  And even with the Dogme 95 technical restrictions (available light, natural sound), this film captures the beauty and immensity of the African desert and light.  One is left with a heightened awareness that our own human dramas are played out against forces, both external and internal, that are only partially under our control.
Be prepared to concentrate, perhaps even view the movie more than once, to understand fully what's happening.  This is **NOT** a ""Hollywood rip-roarer"" or love story.  It **IS** one of the most thoughtful and thought-provoking films I have seen in a long time.",1046649600,18,1783,5.268551236749117
