8004882,2,B0000ZG0FE,"This is a fine film about running breaking seas over inlet bars in planing boats.  If it were marketed as such, I would give it four stars.  It is NOT about heavy weather boat handling.  If you think this dvd will help teach you to survive bad weather at sea while cruising offshore, as the title and description suggest, you will be disapointed.  If you want to learn to safely cross a breaking bar in small-medium size outboard skiffs and power catamarans, you will enjoy this dvd, in the unlikely event that you order it, given the misleading title.",1137024000,2,552,4.545454545454546
