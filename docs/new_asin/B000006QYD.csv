1196221,5,B000006QYD,"i don't own this set yet but if you haven't seen it, you'll do good to click that buy button right now. this is the best series about the rise and fall of the nazis that i've ever seen. the early episodes documenting hitler's rise to power were absolutely fascinating. ""The Road to Treblinka"" was a haunting look at the development of the Holocaust the likes of which i've never experienced. i tuned in every night on the history channel to watch it! a very smart purchase.",981936000,6,473,4.448275862068965
1196222,5,B000006QYD,"Old Beeb never disappoints, and this is no exception.  BBC brings its world-famous house-style of fairness, objectivity and depth to analyse and comment on Britain's most dire nemesis in the twentieth century - Hitler and his Nazis, and you can expect a top-rate job.  I must have watched the entire documentary series  4 times, and each time I gain fresh and deeper insight.  BBC gave a fasinating and horrific subject an excellent treatment, shorn of emotive propaganda. Explores even-handedly the difficulties Germany was in during the 20's, and explores the psychological attractions of the Nazi party to a down-trodden but proud German people.  The chilling pronogsis which came across is that had Hitler been more sensible in his relations with the USSR and marketed Nazism to the world not as a racial-based ideology but as an international ideology, the Nazis might still be around TODAY. Then, the world will truly see a sort of tyranny as it has never before seen, made infinitely  more terrifying by the twisted lights of science & technology.  A must see.  Every public library and school library must buy this.  Fifty years after they have been bombed into the ground, Nazism remains still an attractive ideology for a lot of people, and has returned to its roots as a protest against the status quo.  This documentary answers why that can be so.  My only grouse is that there is no segment presenting the many interviews BBC and other companies has done of Albert Speer - Hitler's Minister of Munitions.  Now that would have made this series even more cool.",977529600,14,1571,4.909090909090909
1196223,5,B000006QYD,"studying the cause and effect, of the second world war.has always been.of a great concern of mine . over the past 50 years. primarily because of my concern of it being repeated.the crimes committed were on such a large  scale,that is almost difficult to imagine. how such a cultured people like  the germans could have let this happen.how adolph hitler could have  captured the imagination of a whole country ,and used them for his evil  genius, to launch the world into a world warthat would take 50 million  lives .this is why we must never forget what took place between 1933 and  1945 if we do we will surely relive it  thank you",961286400,11,633,4.548672566371682

7904682,5,B000006QYD,"This is excellent for a basic understanding of the Nazis and Hitler.  Six hours of documentary VHS provide enough detail and analysis to satisfy almost everyone.  For the sake of brevity, the narrator did not say that it was more the Bavarians (""God is on our side"") than Germans from other parts who were surprised by the November 11th Armistice and who relished blaming the Socialist government for a ""stab in the back"".  The narrator also did not say that it was General Ludendorff, chief of staff to Marshal Hindenburg, who had suggested to the Government in August 1918, that they negotiate for an armistice with the Allies, a fact that the 1920s Nazi movement in Bavaria chose to ignore.
  Also, the narrator script left for other documentaries the errors in conduct of the war after 1940 that ultimately led to the several attempts by German officers to kill Hitler.
  But THE NAZIS is excellent in describing the real Adolf Hitler as seen by those who were close to him (lazy and poorly organized behind the scenes); and it provides very interesting detail about how the Germans controlled occupied territories.",1398902400,,1119,4.8578947368421055
7904683,5,B000006QYD,"The greatest documentary series about World War Two, and the cruelty of the Nazi regime.  Buy it, and watch.  You will be shocked at what they did, the records of their atrocities they kept, and the inhumanity of the entire administration, from the top down.",1363737600,,258,4.711111111111111
7904684,3,B000006QYD,"This is a subject of such magnitude that one must learn as` much as possible in order to avert another turn in this direction. Six volumes give this some degree of weight. The size of this world of unreality must be given a great deal of reflection because one version can never fill in all the details. What I""m saying is don't let this be the final word; dig more deeply. The subject is vast.",1235433600,,394,4.266666666666667
7904685,4,B000006QYD,"I found this to be a well-done and informative documentary which focused on the impact of Nazism upon the local population as well as Europe. This film is long (five vhs videos) but well worth watching. I was particularly impressed with the interviews that they attained; former Nazis as well as victims of the regime. They also interviewed Germans who witnessed these times and events and asked them the hard questions such as ""why didn't you do anything?"" and ""why did you participate in persecuting the Jews?""

This documentary has plenty of footage and clearly presents the events that took place under Nazism. Although there is no groundbreaking research presented here, I learned about events that I had no idea took place. The focus of this documentary is ""a warning from history"" and they clearly present this theme throughout this film. There are lessons to be learned about the power of ideology, nationalism and racism and how these streams of thoughts were used to sway a population and the danger of this happening again.",1127952000,2,1034,4.942528735632184
7904686,5,B000006QYD,"I recommend this series to any World History instructors seeking film that will make students think about the ""whys"" on a level other than a Nazi cartoon-image. Care must be taken in utilizing this resource, as with any source. The ""nude Nazi pageant"" in ""Chaos and Consent"" (vol 2) should certainly be omitted, but the interviews, especially those found in vol 3 ""Road to Treblinka"" can easily start very involved discussions as to involvement of the ordinary citizens, anti-Semitism as a cultural constant, and the ""guilt"" questions. Generally, I only show 20 minutes of most film, and always with a guide and questions to avoid ""heads down / snooze"" time. Trust me, especially on ""Road to Treblinka"", you won't have anyone sleeping, and followed up with other readings and assessed with an essay, you'll be glad you invested in this series. Again, some of it may be ""old hat"", but the imagery of 60-80 year olds seeing and hearing their own words and actions replayed for them is something no standard document can give your class.",1080518400,11,1034,4.880681818181818
7904687,5,B000006QYD,Ignore the one star reviewer. It's obvious why he doesn't like the content. The truth always hurts doesn't it? I have seen this documentary around ten times now. One of the very best series documenting this period ever made. The only thing against it is the fact it could have gone onto two tapes as it is in England.,1045440000,8,317,4.389830508474576

This is the worst claptrap, and the most outrageously overpriced  ... that I have ever come across at Amazon.
The six video tapes  contain only old, well used, too often seen, repetitious footage  available in most other Holocaust films, at much lower  prices.
There is nothing new here, and like other offerings from  the ...  BBC and Holocaust Industry, there is little proof to  support many of the statements made. The evidence offered is too  narrow in scope and addresses isolated incidents.
In each of the  six tapes in the series, the subject always returns to the Detention  Camps and persecution of Jews, ...
This  series says little about the Nazis, their military, or their control  and remaking of the German state except as related to the Camps. The  title ""Holocaust- Warning From History"" would be more  accurate. ...",1004227200,18,835,4.871428571428571
