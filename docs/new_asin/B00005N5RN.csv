1628040,2,B00005N5RN,"And there really is nothing wrong with it, other than I was maybe hoping for something really spectacular and intriguing, and what I got was kind of... dull. Shadow Magic is about one of the first introductions of movies to China. In SM the person doing the introducing is Raymond Wallace, an englishman who's wife had just recently left him. A young man named Liu, who is continually fascinated with western technology, allies himself next to Wallace to bring the movies, aka Shadow Magic, to China. Of course life is not easy, and it is tradition and the arranged marriage to the wrong woman that complicates matters. As I said earlier, I really wanted to like this movie. And honestly, I can't quite pin down what it was that disappointed me about it. It flows along at a considerable pace, and has that sweet sentmentality that countries like Ireland and England have practically put a copyright on. But I suppose I was expecting something more, and I was let down. Either which way, I would recommend this film for a historical aspect. But don't expect anything above average.",1148515200,,1081,4.75531914893617
1628041,5,B00005N5RN,"I enjoyed the heck out of this movie, but even if I did not, the best part is that the Chinese spoken is easy to understand. The actors speak very clearly and the captioning actually is in the frames where the speaking occurs. The sound tracking is very clean. I have been watching a lot of Chinese films while I learn to speak Chinese. Too many times it is impossible to follow the voices. This film is great for voice clarity. speed of speaking, lack of complex sentences, and tracking. You can even hear the tonality of the language. A real blessing to begining suffering student.",1148428800,11,583,4.509433962264151
1628042,3,B00005N5RN,"The material for this movie is good: a Westerner trying to strike it big in the Middle Kingdom a.k.a China by introducing Chinese to motion picture.  The movie was set in the early 20th century as China was on the verge of Industrial Revolution and prior to destruction of Ching Dynasty.  It was difficult for him to set up the business at first but through the help of a pro-Western and curious Chinese, motion picture gradually made its headway into the local scene.  Personally, I feel that the motion picture is a metaphor of modern time.  Naturally, there were Chinese who were reluctant to embrace motion picture because they felt that Chinese Opera Theatre had been going on since the beginning of time and thus, that should continue.  Anyway, the movie touched upon the cultural difference between East and West.  The Chinese character was coerced by his father to marry a wealthy widow who was significantly older than him.  In the olden times, the son had no option but conformed out of obligation.  However, the Western fellow (played by Jarred Harris) convinced the Chinese who had since become his best of friend that he should follow his heart, to pursue his dream lady the daughter of a revered Opera Singer of the time.  Jarred's character explained further that it's perfectly okay to display his affection for the opposite sex.  Then, there was mentioning about hierarchy difference.  Whereas the Opera singer's daughter was rich, the Chinese was poor.  Again, in the olden times, it was an impossibility to bridge the gap somewhat.  As a movie would have it, it would build to a climax where circumstances tried the friendship between the Chinese and the Western guy, the new against the old, complacency against courage.  Being a feel good movie, you can guess the rest.  I really feel that this movie is much aligned with ""Cinema Paradiso"" as the scenes of Chinese watching motion picture for the first time was exactly how it set up in the Italian movie.  Furthermore, the soundtrack utilised here is very much an Ernio Morricone rip-off.  It is expected for such kind of movie to be slow-moving.  It's unjust to compare this movie against Cinema Paradiso.  Yet, it's also unfair that the story is put to us in a condescending way suggesting that that's exactly what's going on in China during that time.  Naturally, there were touching moments but it's as if we have been down the same track before.  I question the accuracy of the depiction.  Is it the right kind of gramaphone used for the time?  There's never any display of chaos when the country was supposed to be filled with soldiers of both East and West trying to curb the civil war and the colonisation of various Western powers.  In this instance, Jarred Harris is THE only Westerner in the movie.  Overall, a well-made movie but in a shallow kind of way.  Recommended watching but not for everyone.",1093737600,,2883,4.7854251012145745
1628043,5,B00005N5RN,"A must see movie suitable for all ages. Excellent fotography of real people and scenic geography of the Great Wall. The magic lies in the hearts and eyes of both the Chinese and one Raymond Wallace - the Englishman who introduced the movie camera technology to China during early 1900's. The movie contains both historical facts of that time and the complexity of human relations whenever ""East"" meets ""West"".",1081468800,3,409,4.942028985507246
1628044,3,B00005N5RN,"Don't get me wrong - this is a fine movie.  It's full of feel-good moments and light, humorous touches.  It's beautifully photographed and each scene is shot and editted with equisite care.  It has colorful costumes and exotic street scenes of old Beijing.  It's a charmingly-dressed tableau of traditional China at the turn of the 20th century.
But perhaps it is a little too charming, from the spotless costumes to the immaculate sidewalks.  Our hero bounces through life encountering a cast of well-intentioned characters who conveniently come around at the most opportune moments.  The movie aspires to serious drama, but delivers mostly cliches.  It reminds one of Cinema Paradiso at places but is much more like Mediterraneo in tone.  At least Cinema Paradiso has some real heartbreaks.  In this film our hero gets the girl, keeps the job, and to top it off, the closing credits tell us he went on to make a fortune.
Perhaps that's The Arnold's reality.  But it sure ain't ours.",1066694400,2,984,4.909090909090909
1628045,4,B00005N5RN,"Loosely based on the Chinese cinema history, ""Shadow Magic"" portrays the people surrounding the first showing of moving picture in Beijing, China in 1902.  But the film is more about the fictional chacaters involved in it rather than about the event itself, so do not expect any historical accuracy.  And ""Shadow Magic"" succeeds as the former kind of picture.
Jared Harris (son of late Richard Harris) is in the film as a British entrepreneur Raymond Wallace, who is eagar to make some money, showing the films he brought from the West, but, good as he is, it is not Harris who carries the whole picture.  It is Chinese actor Xia Yu as Liu, a technician at photography studio who is really remarkable in ""Shadow Magic,"" and he is just wondeful.  Liu, interested in anything new from the West, is a kind of misfit in the traditional Chinese society, and naturally, is the first one to get hooked by the idea of Raymond -- showing the ""Shadow Magic"" in China.  They gradually begin to understand each other, and the rapport between these likable fellows is definitely the best part of the show.
The story written by director Ann Hu, I must say, needs some trimming, sometimes filled with clithed moments.  And some viewers object to the way the Chinese society or culture is depicted here, claiming inaccuracy in the film.  Probably, the film's director Ann Hu is already conscious of that, for she is born in China, and lived through the time of Revolution and Chiarman Mao, and then she left the country to study abroad, in USA where she lives now.  Any production designs should be taken, I assume, as her own creations.  If the story or atomosphere of the film looks like a blend of the West and the East, it is probably her intention, or the result of her cultural background.  And I just do not think that the portrayals of Chinese people are seen through patronizing eye of Westerners.  True, they sometimes suffer from clithe, but fairly done, showing enough variety of people among them, avoiding one-dimentional characterization of the East.
The most moving scene of the film is, of course, the first moment in which the people first see the picture and react joyfully.  You might have heard some famous episodes about the first viewers in Paris cafe where the Lumiere Brothers showed a short film of a train arriving at the station.  The same thing happens to the Chinese people.  The theme is thus universal.
And again I say, the most joyful experience for us is to see the truly believable character of young Liu, who must decide his way of life between the two cultures.  His character and the performance of Xia Yu well deserve the name of ""Shadow Magic.""",1047168000,6,2668,4.695278969957082
1628046,5,B00005N5RN,"Usually I use the term ""feel good"" movie as a pejorative but not in this case.  This is a slightly fictionalized version of the difficulties of the first Chinese film maker Liu.  Having suffered humiliation at the hands of foreign colonialism, the Chinese are understably a bit xenophobic around the turn of the 20th Century.  Liu has to struggle against this tendancy and the rigid confucianism of his day to follow his passion...film making.
In addition to the interesting historical and biographical material of this film, we also get a glimpse at our own fascination with film...there is nothing new in film that doesn't
exist all around us...but film viewing allows us time to just sit still and take notice.  Everyone will love this film!

1628047,5,B00005N5RN,"This film depicts the early efforts to introduce motion pictures to China.  It is done with great gentleness and warmth and reflects a deep love of Cinema.  The cinematography is great, as other of the new films from china (like Raise The Red Lantern and King of Masks) and it reflects the role of cinema in our lives much as Cinema Paradisio did.  It is one of the warmest and most enjoyable films I have seen in years.  I can't imagine it not being a strong contender for an Oscar as Best Foreign Film.  The philosophy of the Chinese film maker profiled (who really did make the first Chinese film) is much like the Don McClean line ""Weathered faces lined with pain are soothed beneath the artists loving hand"".  You should see this!",1028937600,3,735,4.488721804511278
1628048,5,B00005N5RN,"If you are interested in a truly great movie, representative of a historical period of time, early 1900s in China --- this is it!!! The sets, costumes and plot make this a MUST and HAVE TO purchase DVD for anyone who is interested in Chinese culture. Fascinating!!!! Don't be bothered that there are subtitles, they are written well. However, the acting is superb and communicates beyond the Mandarin. This surpasses Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon ten fold for anyone who is interested in a Chinese-made movie that is not merely martial arts. One of the best movies that I have ever seen, equivalent to The Last Emperor. For all ages!!!
For technophiles like myself, this is fascinating to watch --- the introduction of photography and moving pictures in China.",1000598400,36,761,4.953125

7946097,5,B00005N5RN,"Only at the beginning of this movie do you strain with captions. As you progress they become almost second nature and you are transported into the story.

I was surprised as the basic story on the surface seems to tell of how people deal with new technology. This is the introduction of moving pictures or ""Shadow Magic.""

The reality of the story is the friendship of two people Raymond Wallace (Jared Harris), Liu Jinglun (Xia Yu), and their relation ship to others. Raymond is dumped by his wife for someone with money; yet finds his self and future in the making of film. Liu is in a rigid culture, including family and friends, which is trying to force him into marring a rich widow instead of the young aristocrat girl Liu Jinglun (Yufei Xing) he loves.

Can Liu over come the culture and individual prejudices or will he re-assimilate?

And what is to become of Raymond?

Though, short of a tear jerker, you will still get involved with their lives and marvel at the cinematography.",1504569600,8,989,4.628571428571429

7946105,5,B00005N5RN,"I cannot help but noticing the striking colorful images the scenes provided.  Just framing the scenes would have created a beautiful picture.  Although the settings were a little to clean and new, the costumes were excellent.  This 2000 turn of the century story with inspiration and love is directed by Ann Hu.  Watch the commentary by Hu for wonderful insight into the making of the film.  Like most Eastern movies, this is clean and something for the whole family.

The story dates to 1902 China.  A young man, Liu, is so inspired by western technology and moving pictures, that  he submits himself to become the assistant to a traveling English photographer.  With persistence,  he succeeds and the townspeople become delighted with images of themselves.  The conflict arises when Liu is in love with the famed opera star's daughter.  He doesn't want to jeopardize his position.

This film is lengthy,  beautiful images, sepia tone and striking reds and shadows.  The subtitles are displayed for easy reading.  Stick with it for a glimpse into the past.....Rizzo",1214524800,,1066,5.040229885057471
