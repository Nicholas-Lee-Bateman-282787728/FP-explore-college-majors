8738848,3,B000UR9THS,"This is my first and likely my last Rocketbook.  I purchased it to show my students after each Act as a review.  The information and summaries contained on this DVD are very good.  I did not agree with every quiz answer however.  The main problem for me is that the info is not presented in a very engaging manner.  It consists of a ""talking head"" and a minimum of line drawings.  I could just read a summary to my students and it would be the same effect.  Strangely, there is music that plays in the background for the entire time.  It is distracting, annoying, and almost drowns out the man speaking.  If you are looking for something different, that your students will be interested in watching, pass on this DVD.",1363824000,3,717,4.453846153846154
