8650211,3,B00JEEZSO6,"Queen is the greatest rock band in my opinion, however it never seems to translate this fact within most of their documentaries for some reason. Queen in the 1970s is an album by album review with DJs, reporters and unfortunately the know-nothing-know-it-all Paul Gambaccini. They call this guy the Professor of Pop, yet you can tell that he only knows what most folks know about Queen. There are some of other folks here commenting on the music of Queen who seem much more knowledgeable about the band - yet instead of dissecting each album they merely talk about the boring greatest hits. Who wants to hear another story about Bohemian Rhapsody?
I do like the fact that they play Queen music via promotional videos and live footage. Some unauthorized rock docs avoid lawsuits by adding their own generic brand of music instead of the artist's works.
If you are a Queen fan, you are among the most tight-wadded fans out there, which means you do not buy every product released authorized or unauthorized. However I do, I bought this amongst all of the other DVDs that had come out over the years. The fact that Queen in the 1970s is strictly a repackaging of an earlier DVD doc - Queen Under Review: 1973-1980 wouldn't matter to most Queen fans because you people didn't buy it the first time around. However for me, this was a major disappointment for me.",1417737600,4,1357,4.682008368200837
8650212,5,B00JEEZSO6,"it's a great disc...unless you already have ""queen: under review 1973-1980"" (like i already do)...this is the same exact documentary...they didn't even change the 'title card'...however...that should not deter you from liking this or buying this if you don't already own the original...still great and classic stuff from the band as well as fellow musicians and some of the most respected music critics in the business...definitely for every queen fan...",1407283200,5,454,5.5
8650213,2,B00JEEZSO6,Poor Quality and endless talk from commentators. We want to watch the band not uknown commentators. Boring,1405641600,7,106,5.294117647058823
