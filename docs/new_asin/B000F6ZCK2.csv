2553401,3,B000F6ZCK2,This was not what I was under the impresion it was!! I was looking for minesweepers of the naval kind.  Not a bad program though!!!,1207267200,,131,4.24
2553402,5,B000F6ZCK2,This documentary on the Art of Tatooing is very interseting and accurate. It was a very good learning experience for anyone wanting to gain knowledge or enter the Tatoo industry.,1200787200,,178,4.966666666666667
2553403,3,B000F6ZCK2,"but could have been better.  I don't think the running time on this video (just under an hour) is nearly enough time to give to the catastrophic weather events of April 3, 1974.

Still, it was a very good DVD with lots of facts, information, and photos about the areas primarily affected during the outbreak, i.e. Ohio, Kentucky, Alabama.  All in all it gives a good overview, but I would have liked it to have been more detailed.",1179878400,,430,4.487179487179487
2553404,3,B000F6ZCK2,"This DVD on the history and legends of werewolves is fun and informational to watch, but on a basic level. For people who are experienced with werewolf lore the information presented might be too common knowledge and simplified. The cinematic presentation portion of the DVD isn't cheesy, but isn't super exciting in my opinion. I've come by books that offer far better insight into werewolf lore and do a better job illustratively presenting it than the DVD did such as Ian Woodward's The Werewolf Delusion.",1179532800,6,508,4.988235294117647
2553405,5,B000F6ZCK2,"I'm sure anyone who lived in the midwestern sections of the United States in the mid-1970s can probably recall the horrific day of Wednesday, April 3, 1974, a day when 148 tornadoes touched down in 13 U.S. states in the midwest and south, claiming more than 300 lives, injuring another 5,400+ people, and causing massive amounts of property damage. It was the single worst outbreak of twisters ever in North America. That day of windy weather became known thereafter as the ""Super Tornado Outbreak"".

This nearly hour-long ""Wrath Of God"" program, produced by The History Channel and A&E Home Video, probes that '74 ""Super Outbreak"" of deadly tornadoes, providing ample video footage of various twisters during the rampage, plus a close look at the damage left in their wake.

In 1974, there were no video camcorders. Therefore, all of the footage taken of the storms came from either private citizens who were using their home movie (film) cameras, or via local area television stations, who were able to film (or tape) some of the twisters with their TV station's commercial camera equipment. In either case, much of this original 1974 footage is quite remarkable -- and scary as heck (knowing the death and destruction that these devastating storms caused).

Many local weather agencies were so swamped with warnings that it became nearly impossible to keep up with them all. It was a weatherman's worst nightmare come true.

From Decatur, Illinois....to Plum Tree, Indiana....to Xenia, Ohio....to Nashville, Tennessee....to Louisville, Kentucky....to Shady Spring, West Virginia....to Roanoke, Virginia -- all of these communities (and tons of others) were hit by at least one twister during the funnel-cloud onslaught of April 3rd.

The Xenia, Ohio, storm turned out to be the most deadly of the tornadoes to strike that day. The fierce half-mile-wide Xenia funnel, which struck at 4:42 PM local time, killed 33 people, while injuring 1,150 more. Approximately half the town was either completely destroyed or badly damaged by the wrath of the incredible ""F5"" twister. (""F5"" being the most powerful and potentially destructive on the ""Fujita"" tornado-measuring scale.)

The official ""Fujita"" definition of an F5 twister indicates the following --- ""F5 Tornado: Wind Speed: 261-318 MPH; producing 'Incredible Damage'. Strong frame houses leveled off foundations and swept away; automobile-sized missiles fly through the air in excess of 100 yards; trees debarked; steel re-inforced concrete structures badly damaged. Incredible phenomena will occur. F5 Relative Frequency: Less than 1% of all recorded tornadoes.""

In theory, it is believed that an ""F6"" category of tornado could exist, but no F6 storms have ever been officially recorded. Interestingly, the official Fujita description of a potential ""F6"" storm is classified in the ""Inconceivable"" category (with winds of 319-379 MPH).

Xenia is located 16 miles west of Dayton, Ohio, and has a population of about 25,000. There were nine churches, four schools, and 1,333 homes and businesses destroyed. The total cost of the damage sustained to the town was estimated to be approximately 100 million (circa 1974) dollars.

The F5 monster that annihilated Xenia stayed on the ground for 32 miles and lasted nine minutes, which is nearly twice as long as a normal tornado. The clean-up lasted three months.

The following link provides a terrifying image of the massive Xenia twister:

snrs.unl.edu/amet451/kozisek/xenia%20tornado.jpg

Having been located in the easternmost portion of Ohio's neighboring state of Indiana as Xenia was being pummelled by its hellish F5 vortex, I can vividly recall tuning in to Dayton television station WHIO-TV on 4/3/74 during the tornado outbreak and watching weatherman Gil Whitney as he provided the non-stop warnings to the public.

I can also remember watching Whitney's radar screen and seeing the distinctive ""hook"" echo pattern located directly over Xenia on the radar. I'll never forget that. Scary as hell.

At about 4:00 PM on April 3, Whitney broadcast an unofficial tornado warning for Xenia based upon images from the station's newly-installed radar. Technically, his action violated National Weather Service procedures, but the ""unofficial"" warning was widely credited with keeping the number of casualties lower than what they might have turned out to be otherwise.

The 32-mile duration of the Xenia funnel, however, did not establish the record-high for ""consecutive length on the ground"" that April day. A twister that tore through Monticello, Indiana, remained on the ground for an incredible 121 miles before finally dissipating. That ""F4"" tornado killed 19 people and injured more than 360 others.

What I, personally, remember the most about April 1974 is visiting the stricken town of Xenia, Ohio, a couple of weeks after the tornado. I recall seeing virtually nothing but devastation on every street we drove down. From local restaurants without their roofs, to houses ripped from their foundations. A sad sight indeed.

And as if the '74 storm wasn't bad enough, Xenia was, amazingly, struck a second time by a deadly twister, some years later. On September 20, 2000, one person was killed and 60 homes totally destroyed by yet another wicked funnel cloud that swept through the small town of Xenia. Talk about lightning striking twice.

There's an Internet website that features all kinds of interesting details, data, and photos surrounding the '74 ""Super Outbreak"". It's located at april31974.com.

That website includes some stunning photographs of many of the deadly twisters that touched down that spring day, and also contains a page of word-for-word text from the remarkable live as-it's-happening reports that were heard on radio station WHAS in Louisville, Kentucky, when helicopter traffic reporter Dick Gilbert tracked the F4 tornado that hit Louisville, reporting live over WHAS radio what he was witnessing.

This History Channel ""Super Outbreak"" DVD program contains very good narration and excellent picture and sound quality. The video is Full-Frame (1.33:1). Audio is in Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo.

More Tornado Talk..........

Nine years prior to the 1974 ""Super Outbreak"", the midwest U.S. experienced a precursor to the '74 storms when more than 50 tornadoes ripped through the middle U.S. states, killing better than 250 and injuring thousands more. That spate of twisters was known as the ""Palm Sunday Outbreak"", occurring on Palm Sunday, April 11, 1965. Lots more information on the '65 outbreak can be found here:

wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Palm_Sunday_Tornado_Outbreak

The all-time record for the deadliest single tornado in United States history belongs to the so-called ""Tri-State Tornado"", which killed an almost unbelievable 695 people in Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana, on Wednesday, March 18th, 1925.

That amazing twister kept the same heading (NE 63 degrees) for 183 miles of its 219-mile path. The tornado travelled at an average speed of 62 MPH, setting still more records for both speed and path length.

After the ""Tri-State"" twister moved into Illinois, the storm was at its worst. In Gorham, Illinois, 34 were killed as nearly 100% of the town was destroyed. Between Gorham and Murphysboro, the record for ""fastest tornado ground speed"" was broken as the relentless funnel cloud barrelled across the ground at 73 miles-per-hour!

The tornado arrived at Murphysboro, Illinois, at 2:34 P.M., killing a staggering 234 people, breaking yet another record (the most deaths in one U.S. city from a single tornado). Damage in Murphysboro exceeded 10-million (1925-era) dollars.

The incredible ""Tri-State Tornado"" was part of a larger tornado outbreak on that March day way back in 1925, an outbreak which included eight tornadoes that killed an absolutely-incredible total of 747 people, making it (to date) by far the deadliest multi-tornado outbreak on record. And it's a record that's not likely to ever be topped. God willing, it never shall.

A 140-page book, first published in March 1992, can be obtained here at Amazon that focuses solely on that 1925 monster twister (""The Tri-State Tornado: The Story Of America's Greatest Tornado Disaster""). Here's a link:

A final word about this History Channel/A&E DVD.......

Re-living the very windy day of April 3, 1974, by way of this 50-minute DVD program, is a tense and, frankly, rather frightening experience. The unpredictability and sheer raw power of Mother Nature at work can quickly make a person realize how helpless any human being truly is when brought face-to-face with what Mrs. Nature dished up during that one heart-pounding day of very bad weather in the spring of 1974.",1157414400,6,8792,5.398100803506209
8118133,5,B000F6ZCK2,"Great DVD, historically well put together, came in Fast and well packaged. I'm very Happy!",1481155200,,90,5.066666666666666
8118134,5,B000F6ZCK2,Nice review of the history of railroad bridge design and construction.,1444608000,,70,5.454545454545454
8118135,3,B000F6ZCK2,This was a video I used to introduce my students to the history of Tattooing upon which they had to do an assignment. It was very accessible but some of the information was not particularly objective and some was inaccurate.  I am not an expert but I do live in New Zealand Aotearoa and teach both Maori and Pacific Island students who know a bit about their own cultural history particularly in regard to tattooing and we found that the Maori and Pacific information was wrong took things from a highly sensationalised partisan viewpoint.,1388448000,,539,4.73404255319149
8118136,4,B000F6ZCK2,"It saddens me that this is one of the three best Abominable Snowman documentaries out there because it is a pretty dull watch. They do have a lot of the basic info and a lot of the usual Cryptozoogical suspects, along with much of the b-roll and archival footage one would want to see. This is very thorough. It is just constructed in the most mundane fashion imaginable and many of the interviews date back a couple of decades. On one hand I think it is pretty run of the mill, unfortunately, when it comes to the Yeti, this is about as good as it gets.",1358121600,,554,4.235849056603773
8118137,4,B000F6ZCK2,I wasn't aware that this focussed more on the non-train railroad items like bridges and tunnels. Interesting but not something I will watch over and over.,1358035200,2,154,4.961538461538462
8118138,3,B000F6ZCK2,"""Sasquatch Attack"" might be one of the few useful episodes of the perennially boring ""MonsterQuest"", a History Channel series with a vaguely ""scientific"" angle on cryptozoology and the paranormal. (In reality, the series is intended as entertainment.)

This particular episode follows a team of scientists, among them Jeff Meldrum, who try to procure hard evidence for the existence of Bigfoot or Sasquatch, the famed but elusive ape-man of North America. The team heads for an isolated fishing cabin at Snelgrove Lake in Ontario, Canada. They are attacked in the middle of the night by somebody or something throwing stones at the cabin, something no native animal can do. A bed of screws shows what could be a footprint. Meldrum and his team manage to procure some blood and hair, but the DNA tests on the physical evidence are inconclusive. The official lab can't find any DNA at all, while an unofficial, pro-Bigfoot test made by a team member supposedly reveals that the DNA comes from an ape more closely related to humans than chimps...

There the matter ends, with some suggestive facts (the stone-throwing at the cabin, which scared the living daylights out of the scientists inside) but no *really* hard evidence. Somehow, it feels like business as usual in squatchland. However, I admit that this show was more interesting (or squatchy?) than MonsterQuest is on average, with the exception of the claim that an earlier break-in at the cabin was the result of Bigfoot activity. That was obviously a bunch of rampaging humans...",1352505600,,1537,5.047244094488189
8118139,4,B000F6ZCK2,"For a historical yeti profile this is one of the better productions available on DVD. You'll see lots of ancient illustrations and get an explanation of the yeti's relationship to Tibetan culture and beliefs. This piece was made in 1997 so it doesn't have the fast pacing or exclusive expedition material of current yeti and crypto beast productions. Expect a presentation of historical and 1997-era material in a documentary style typical of History Channel productions of this time.

Events are presented chronologically and include the 1921 Bury expedition that discovered yeti footprints and launched the Western world's interest of the newly dubbed Abominable Snowman. You'll see profiles of the expeditions from the 50's - 60's including the Tom Slick venture that snatched the Pangboche yeti hand bones. Loren Coleman offers expedition details.

This production is one of the few (if only) that featured the infamous 1996 Nepal Snow Walker video. By 1999 this footage was revealed a hoax but during the time of this 1997 documentary's production this footage was fresh and held curiosity in the crypto community. Jeff Meldrum is featured.

 Overall good production - but rather pricey for 50 mins of material with no bonus material or even packaging art. This like many of the HC titles is really pricey for the amount of content. It should be offered for less or perhaps bundled in a better value. Perhaps include in a season of MonsterQuest or something. Also note that some of the content of this title is reused in the 2001 HC production ""Bigfoot and Other Monsters"" for the yeti portion.",1269302400,3,1599,5.045454545454546
8118140,1,B000F6ZCK2,"This is unquestionably the worst production/presentation I have ever seen.  It's content is 2 hours of visual bovine excrement.  It's so bad that it's insulting.  It's so bad that it makes every presentation by History Channel questionable.  If anyone reading this knows anyone in upper or executive management please, PLEASE contact them immediately and implore that they remove this from their catalog and have it quietly destroyed.  Or, to write off a total loss perhaps the discs can be sold in bulk quantity to shooting ranges as targets.  Let's hope History Channel will collectively get their finger out of their nose and prevent TV viewers from embarrassment this bad ever again.",1259539200,,687,5.1441441441441444
8118141,5,B000F6ZCK2,"If you are serious about learning facts and history of real and fake werewolves you must view this dvd. This is a very educational film. But IF you think it's too boring and you better to watch some thrilling movie instead, this DVD is definitely not for your collection. This is just a piece of history about werewolves. If you like legends and folklore this is probably a must buy. What about me? I have watched this documentary before, and bought it for a collection. I am a HAPPY CUSTOMER :)",1220486400,5,495,4.450549450549451
8118142,4,B000F6ZCK2,"I was looking for something to show my students that wasn't cheesy and had some action.  The footage is really good and the narration does move it along.  It does drag in some spots, but it does eventually pick up.  I would have liked to have seen more twister footage though.",1217289600,,276,4.372549019607843
