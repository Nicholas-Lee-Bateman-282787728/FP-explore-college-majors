The acting is tight and real.  The scene is authentic, down to the background music in the rock club.  It has a beginning, middle, and end.  Very enjoyable.  If you were flipping channels on cable and hit on this, you'd think you had missed the first two thirds of a mainstream movie, but come in for the best part.  But it's all there in these fifteen minutes (or whatever).

""Off The Wall"" is dramatic, funny, and surprising.  And that last is a surprise in itself.  You expect most good short films to have a surprise.  You *prepare* for the surprise.  Yet this furnishes a surprise in a real way.  At least for me.

As it stands, this is completely successful -- all the way from writing to production values.  But I wish I could see a whole movie by this guy.  He could pull it off in a bold way.",1114732800,2,872,4.219512195121951
8045020,5,B00076R5T6,Interesting film.  Good production value.  I think shooting on film paid off.  It looks much better than your average festival film shot on digital video.  The performances are solid and the sound design is very effective.  The DVD has some neat extras.  Definitely worth a look.,1104364800,2,279,4.956521739130435
