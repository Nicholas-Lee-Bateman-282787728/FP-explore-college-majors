7974166,1,B000077VRR,". . .  ""Manhunt"" had the look of a low-budget, sloppy, made-for-tv film from the 1960s.  Pedestrian script, poor lighting, lots of gaps in its plot, unimaginative cinematography...And the sound was SO terrible, it was possible only to pick out only a few words!  The sound was all so mushy.  The music was similarly disjointed, it didn't even sound like music.  It was hard to believe it was made as recently as 2001.

. . .  Three or four lengthy scenes taken with the camera 6 inches above the pavement, showing nothing but the bad guys' cars rolling along, were emblematic of the lack of imagination in this film.  The lead character, obese and unkept, demonstrated truly wooden acting skills.

. . .  I kept wondering why the lead character, on the run from fellow gangsters, stopped on the Argentine side of the border with Paraguay.  If he was fearing for his life, it's a very poruous border and easy to slip across.  Also, how did the other gangsters know exactly where to find him?

. . .  Little happens for the first hour -- if you're expecting a suspenseful build-up, there isn't any.  Just boredom.  After an hour, some action finally begins to occur, but only in dribs and drabs.  At a couple of points, there were shots of wildlife in Africa that cut in.  Huh? I don't know if those were technical mistakes with footage of another film, or some kind of deep symbolism (the title in Spanish, ""Caceria"" or ""Hunting"" -- get it?).  If it was some kind of symbolism, it wasn't lame, it was pathetic.

.  . .  We love Latin American cinema, but were apalled by this extremely poorly done film.  Instead of ""Manhunt"", look for something far better such as ""Y Tu Mama Tambien,"" ""Maria Full of Grace,"" or ""Motorcycle Diaries.""  In the end, I wasn't bored, but rather EMBARASSED that I had wasted my money and family's time setting them down in front of the TV.  The $3.05 price I paid for this film was a waste of money.

.  . .  ""Manhunt"" isn't the slick ""film noir"" or thriller you might be looking for.  It's amatuerish, poorly done and B O R I N G.  Use your hard-earned money to buy something better, even if it's much more expensive!",1138492800,,2145,4.467700258397933
7974167,3,B000077VRR,"""Manhunt"" is an okay drama that puts one in mind of ""Road To Perdition"", but on a very low budget.  The acting is fine and the direction tight.
My beef is with the very poor quality of sound on the DVD.  The picture is good but the sound is terrible!  Were it not for the subtitles, I would have been lost.",1079568000,4,306,3.9836065573770494
7974168,4,B000077VRR,"A well thought out film, Manhunt (Caceria) focuses on Daniel, a man with a criminal past who's also the father of a young son.  After escaping the mob that he no longer wants a part of--and from whom he stole a hefty sum--he retreats to his small home town of Redencion (Redemption) in northern Argentina, far from the urban swell of Buenos Aires.  There he sees, for the first time in years, his former sweetheart who is now married to a cynical wife-beating womanizer.  And, for the first time in years as well, he sees his old friend Miguel, who's now a member of the local police.
And there too, after a day or two, he meets up with members of his old mob who've come to take back their money and then kill him.
Caceria is directed with a great deal of intelligence and understanding. It's a film whose director knows how men and women think and feel, and what they want, and what they'll do to get what they want.  It pulls no punches, it does not waste time, it's honest, it's not rushed, yet neither is it slow.  The pacing is perfect, the acting is excellent, and the momentum of the story is gripping.
Highly recommended.",1060128000,7,1130,4.3875598086124405
