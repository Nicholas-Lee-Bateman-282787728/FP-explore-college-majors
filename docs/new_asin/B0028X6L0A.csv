This anime took me by surprise. It has action, comedy, drama, and romance. The characters are likable, and the story is original and fantastic. My only complaint is the animation. The animation is very good; I just dislike the style. It's very different. You'll see what I mean if you watch it. the voice acting, and soundtrack are also quite well done. I think that this is something that everyone can enjoy. I strongly recommend it.",1358553600,,873,4.525316455696203

I can only give one reaction for this series; it blows you away.
The entire show is only 7 episodes long, each episode measures to about 40 minutes, just slightly longer than a normal show, but every episode leaves you wanting more. The concept came from a Cup Noodle commercial with three clear parameters; It had to have art by Katsuhiro Otomo (Akira), use Utada Hikaru's song 'This Is Love' and show the characters had to be eating Cup Noodle.
On these three tihngs, a delight was born.
First, as for story:

It keeps you hanging, it makes you laugh until you fall off your chair, thrilling, engaging, enchanting. You will feel a connection for the characters and their struggle, and this is appropriate for anyone. Even someone who hates anime can find joy in this short OVA series; any age and any fandom. This is a story that finds humor while not straying into panty-shot territory, it doesn't rely on gimmicks or nonsense to keep it going. I was personally on the edge of my seat with every episode; laughter and frustration with every turn. What kept me guessing the most was the strange realism it had, while being completely fantastic at the same time.

Art:
While done in much the same style as Akira art wise, the method used is a little different than traditional anime.  I was skeptical about it at first, as it's similar to video game type 3-D cell shaded graphics. The art isn't elaborate, but it's beautiful and the characters aren't buxom or bishonen in the slightest. But the simplicity is key for the story to exist, while it's an adjustment from the familiar, it became more than just another anime you've seen around. Rest assured, this is one you won't forget.

Sound:
The music is amazing, the scores fit like puzzle pieces and the opening theme by Utada Hikaru captures you while the intro graphics, which are extremely cool, draw you into the world.

You could say, there's nothing to lose in buying this, and everything to gain.",1259366400,,2144,4.661375661375661
