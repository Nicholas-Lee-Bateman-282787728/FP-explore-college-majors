8176154,5,B000NA278A,"I had seen one or two of these episodes on PBS a few years ago, it is good to have all of them on one disc.  Found it very interesting and I especially enjoyed the Soviet Sports Wars, very eye opening to get first hand impressions from the athletes themselves",1362528000,,259,4.18
8176155,3,B000NA278A,"This DVD has four episodes: I) Red Victories of the KGB, which documents the successes Soviet spies enjoyed in the West (II) Soviet Sports Wars, about the secret efforts the USSR pursued in order to make itself competitive at international sports (III) Secret Soviet Moon Mission, discussing Korolev and the hidden world of the Soviet space program and (IV) Soviet Propaganda Machine, a discussion of how the Soviet Union controlled information within its own borders and also tried to effect the international media. The subtitle of this work is ""Secrets of the Russian Archives Revealed"" but very little of what appears in this set is newly-uncovered information or even new footage backing up much of what is discussed. There are some great and touching first-person accounts by former Soviet citizens, however, and it does much to document the communist state.",1324684800,2,864,5.178571428571429
