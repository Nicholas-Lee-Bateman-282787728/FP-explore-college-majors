8362560,3,B000QQHTGG,"Classic Super Heroes Collection (DVD) both Green Archer are complete. The Mill Creek Green Archer copy is a different source than Alpha studio's copy. Both studios source are from VHS. In Mill Creek Green Archer copy Both left and right have more details. The top is slightly more cropped than Alpha's. It also contains a missing scene from Alpha's copy, a couple seconds when Jory is a prisoner with gang interrogation. Mill Creek Green Archer copy is brighter, darker, sharper also. However, Chs 8 ff some scenes are too bright loosing details. A scene in ch 11 is missing but in Alpha's copy. Flash Gordon is too enlarged for some reason cropping top, left and right. I do not understand why everyone has to release another Flash Gordon. I bought this only for Green Archer. Image has best Flash Gordon. VCI and Super restored have best Archers.",1358985600,2,848,4.775510204081633
8362561,3,B000QQHTGG,"This DVD apparently contains two serials: ""The Green Archer"" and ""Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe."" The following is copied from another seller's Web site: ""It's good versus evil in this collection of two vintage serials. In this third serial of FLASH GORDON CONQUERS THE UNIVERSE, the hero of the title (Buster Crabbe) tackles Ming as he threatens to destroy the earth with Death Dust. The story may be less high-tech in THE GREEN ARCHER, but there's still plenty of action. These 15 episodes feature the Green Archer intervening in a story of kidnapping and family fighting.""",1283817600,4,580,5.052083333333333
