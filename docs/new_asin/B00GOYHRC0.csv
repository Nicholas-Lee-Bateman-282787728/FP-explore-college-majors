6097516,2,B00GOYHRC0,I found this a very narrow focus ... nothing new. I was not impressed. I can not give it more than two stars.,1393891200,,109,3.782608695652174
6097517,5,B00GOYHRC0,"I bought this because my husband was not home when they aired it on the Nat GEO channel, and I was unable to record it.  I told him about it and he wanted to see it.  It is an interesting fictionalized depiction of what might happen if the entire power grid went down in the USA for ten days.  It really makes you think about making some preparations in case of such an event.",1392422400,13,376,4.054054054054054

6097524,5,B00GOYHRC0,I got this from the library without looking at the call number....almost to the end I thought it was the real deal .... people's real life recordings but it wasn't!!! At the end the acting got weird....and then cast names show at the end. I loved it though!!! Makes you think!!! Makes u wanna b better prepared. What an idiot that girl's boyfriend was wanting to give away what's not even his to give! The nerve to do that!,1466553600,,423,4.367088607594937
6097525,5,B00GOYHRC0,"This is a great, practical look at what could happen to Americans if we ever lose electrical power from a grid shutdown due to a cyber or EMP attack. Many lessons to be tsken away after watching and a call to action for more preparedness and self-reliance.",1465257600,,256,4.468085106382978
6097526,4,B00GOYHRC0,"Good for the message trying to get through.  From the point of view over a fairly short period (10 days) without grid power, on individual cel phones, cameras and such.  My biggest eyebrow raise was, ""no power - why is your video still recording after ten days?"". My phone wears down after one day, especially taxing the batteries with data drives.
This representation did its best, from different points of view, exactly how unprepared even the highly prepared can be and exactly how ignorant most of society is.  There will be no help coming people.  Learn to survive.  Do it now, even just a bit.",1464998400,2,599,4.666666666666667

6097532,5,B00GOYHRC0,"Very sobering and well-done scenarios of ""Suppose the power grid went down nationwide"".

6097537,4,B00GOYHRC0,"It's worth a look for educational purposes and it drives home the point of assuming some personal responsibility for one's own safety and security. I can't remember how many times I've turned on the news and some unfortunate family is talking to a news reporter about how suddenly the (insert natural disaster here) had taken them by surprise and how unprepared they were to deal with it's aftermath. What always strikes me as odd is the disasters are usually the ones that come around every year on the east coast, they're periodic, fairly common and anyone who watches the news on a fairly regular basis would know about these things days, hours or minutes in advance.

Power outages are pretty common, you would think people would prepare ahead of time for the occasional outage. Emergency light sources, keeping extra canned goods on hand (many other storage methods), storing extra water and not just relying on the tap, keeping a comprehensive first aid kit and any specialty medicines in good supply. As for personal security, it's up to you (your choice). Finally, communications other than your smart phone which becomes pretty dumb very fast in such times, again many different choices here also, HAM radio comes to mind.

American Blackout is a call to action for personal preparedness in the event of a cyber attack against the American power grid, it's educational, thought provoking and tries to wake people up to their need to take a little responsibility for there own safety in such events. Four stars!",1419465600,7,1519,4.9296875
6097538,5,B00GOYHRC0,"Every American should absolutely watch this video by National Geographic!!!  They will know why they should demand that their elected officials put ""Hardening our Power Grid"" as a Top Priority.  The Future of our Nation is at stake...",1418688000,,234,5.131578947368421
6097539,5,B00GOYHRC0,"This movie has a very believable story line, motivated me to stock up on water and can goods. If you watch the news at all, multiple hostile countries are constantly are trying to hack into all our vital systems. If they succeed ( it only takes once ) this is what will happen, watch this and protect your family",1418342400,,312,4.305084745762712
6097540,4,B00GOYHRC0,"American Blackout & After Armageddon (Contagion too). In training, American Blackout is much what we are to anticipate, except the sudden ""happy ending."" If a CME (instead of hackers) does strike the happy ending will be long in coming.",1415923200,2,236,5.076923076923077
6097541,5,B00GOYHRC0,"A very good visualization of what it will be like after The Crap Hits The Fan. Although the Prepper seems a little dumb, it gives you a pretty good picture of what it will be like.",1411689600,,180,4.027777777777778
6097542,5,B00GOYHRC0,"Fairly realistic to show how quickly people would turn into animals if they didn't have access to things we take for granted like groceries, water, power etc.  Also shows how un-prepared some people are these days.  An excellent watch if you want to see what COULD happen and maybe open your eyes to some things that you are not ready for.

And for God's sake no one should buy $17 an ounce swordfish...... bloody rich whiners :)",1409616000,,429,4.545454545454546
6097543,3,B00GOYHRC0,There are lessons to be learned here.,1404864000,,37,4.428571428571429
6097544,1,B00GOYHRC0,"The three ominous stories presented here show that only the government will be there in the event of a total blackout impacts a great portion or even the entire country.  The various storylines show that no matter what you do whether you prepare for such an eventuality (which happened in the NYC region several years ago), you are incapable to prepare for all eventualities particularly in light of the unpredictable element of animalistic human behavior exhibited by your neighbors or yourself when facing hunger and thirst.  In each story, those who attempted to fend for themselves were unsuccessful.  Only the family who went to the designated spot were okay - having lived through severe Hurricanes in Florida, supplies run out and not everyone waits their turn...

While no one can be fully prepared, nor predict others behavior is the a reason to solely trust the government will be adequate?  No interviews with people from recent disasters such as the various Blackouts experienced here and in Canada and how much the government assisted them during these crises. There have been a number of government meetings in recent years about major power grid sabotage, it is expected!  Yet, they have not formulated any significan means to assist the public once an event such as this occurs (do some research on the internet).  So, while the government has been stockpiling food, tanks, hummers, weapons and bullets, who be the first to get access to food and water?  Remember those in charge will decide the allocation.",1404604800,16,1523,5.015873015873016
6097545,5,B00GOYHRC0,"The premise is an extended power outage in the US. The story follows several individuals as they cope with the outage in different ways.
Given the real examples of outages in the North East, I think their timeline for rioting to begin is optimistic. Otherwise, I feel the portrayals are fairly accurate.
I heard about the Nat Geo special and tracked down when it would be running again. After watching, I had to get the DVD.",1400803200,10,424,4.592105263157895
6097546,5,B00GOYHRC0,"My favorite line in the movie was when a NY couple who was stranded in their high rise apt voiced her appeal by saying ""Why aren't they helping us?"" It clearly is the mindset that govt or other entities will always exits in a crisis. Something of this magnitude, when the whole nation is dark, spells disaster for those unprepared for the duration. People always think we will have police protection 24/7 or that food banks, grocery stores and pharmacies have limitless supplies on hand. The way people think in this day and age with all the entitlements and false belief in their own self- importance will suffer the most. History and human nature never change not matter how civilized we think we have become. Get this movie, show it to you family and friends and then think of ways to endure through a crisis, because it is not far fetched. Think of the collapse of the financial system in this country, which is very likely considering what we have done with out of control spending. It is more than likely going to happen--what are you going to do???",1394496000,35,1055,4.587301587301587
6097547,3,B00GOYHRC0,"Really? Marshal law after 4-5 days? Did we resort to that after Sandy and Katrina, and this winter's numerous ice/snow storm where 100's of thousands of people had no power? Granted those weren't nationwide, I just wonder if people would really resort to mobs looting and rioting for food/water that soon. Also interesting that they only focused on people in urban/suburban areas, no rural people, who routinely loose power for several days to a week every time there is a big storm. I do think the premise is not that far off. We've already had cyber-attacks on banks, and retail chains. How far off can an attack on the power grids be? So the message is good we, as a nation are not prepared. And people need to be prepared themselves, not think FEMA would be able to provide for their needs if something of this magnitude occurred. Not that everyone should become a ""prepper"" and build a bunker, but FEMA itself recommends everyone have 2-weeks of supplies laid-up for themselves.",1394409600,2,983,4.754385964912281

8625818,5,B00GOYHRC0,"EMP  get ready. Get great ideas for your prepping supplies.  I've seen some of this after hurricane Gustov and Katrina.  See what these people have , and don't have and get the stuff for yourself.",1494374400,,196,4.542857142857143
8625819,2,B00GOYHRC0,"This video was a total waste of time. They call it a ""docudrama"". Well I can tell you there is no docu- and it's all drama. And bad drama at that. Utterly predictable and pedestrian. If you like hearing people complain about having to eat cold food and not being able to watch TV or send texts on their cell phones, because the power is out, then this video is for you. The thread about the preppers fending off the neighbors begging for food, then invading their property with guns to ransack the pantry, was just what one would expect and nothing more.

Unlike the History Channel's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/After-Armageddon/dp/B004M9QNR4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">After Armageddon</a>&nbsp;there are no interviews with experts who give their opinions on what things would be like during a global catastrophe (an influenza pandemic in the case of After Arm., a mass power outage with American Blackout). The factual content of American Blackout is ZERO.

The video I would most recommend is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Plague-History-Channel/dp/B000CSTK7O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Plague (History Channel)</a>. Although this happened in the 14th century, this video has rather good documentary content and the information is applicable to any modern pandemic that might occur in our future. The way people and society reacted to the new conditions caused by the elimination of 1/3 of humanity is portrayed in an entertaining and informative style. But please, do not waste your time with American Blackout.

One-half star, but Amazon will not permit me to post a rating less than one. Total utter garbage.

UPDATE 5/8/17: got around to watching the 45-minute extra Doomsday Preppers. Raised rating to one star. This extra technically qualifies as a documentary but it's presented in a slicked-up hyperbolic style. Contains a few useful tidbits of info, but still very superficial.",1493596800,2,1990,5.804794520547945
8625820,4,B00GOYHRC0,"Good, believable story.  As good as any of the many (60 or more) of the same genre that I've read in the last couple years.",1486857600,2,123,3.92
8625821,5,B00GOYHRC0,As good as a zombie movie.,1485129600,,26,3.5
8625822,5,B00GOYHRC0,"Excellent documentary about what would happen if the lights went out - and stayed out!  It is particularly current as cyber threats become increasingly possible.  American Blackout is a docudrama showing people in various situations, some very tenuous, as they cope with the wide ramifications of a power outage.  In addition, National Geographic have added a bonus program on Doomsday Preppers.  Were the preppers right after all?  You may answer ""Yes"" after watching!  Highly recommended!",1483920000,,490,5.466666666666667
