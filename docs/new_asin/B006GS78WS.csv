4987658,5,B006GS78WS,"The video was very helpful and had numerous tips on becoming a better trap shooter. Clearly explained and easily understood.
The advantage of having this information on video is it can be reviewed time and again. It is often difficult to absorb everything in the field and this video ticks all the boxes for us.
It is particularly helpful because of the use of the gun camera enabling the viewer to clearly see what happening in real time.

8497757,3,B006GS78WS,"Harlan is not a great communicator. He covers none of the basics and focused on three primary areas: 1. Gun hold position. 2. Stance and 3. Geometry. The geometry part confused me. His ""leaning into"" the target instruction is very helpful. Overall, a rather narrow instructional DVD. Not to mention the 5-minute commercial he squeezes in for Krieghoff and Remington.",1518480000,,366,5.116666666666666
8497758,5,B006GS78WS,"BEST TRAP SHOOTING VIDEO available!! I know, I have watched them all. No useless info nor rambling boredom like Kiner (his video seems like he has 200 minutes as a goal & talked until he got there.) Harlan's method is logical & seems easy to learn. As a relatively new shooter, I have watched this 3 times & I am NOT the type to re-watch anything. I am first on a waiting list for his seminar in my area next weekend. I keep my fingers crossed!! This DVD is worth every penny & then some!!",1493942400,,489,4.157894736842105

8497760,5,B006GS78WS,Good video.. Loaded with good advice and instruction for veteran as well as first-time trap shooter.,1438214400,,100,5.3125
8497761,5,B006GS78WS,"I am not new to firearms, but I am new to trap shooting.  Got the bug from jump start.  Two sessions with a borrowed shotgun and I was ""all in"".  Researched and ordered an entry level O/U Shotgun:  Mossberg Silver Reserve II - 12 Gauge - 34"" Ported Barrels.  But I knew that I would need the best information possible to aid me in developing a sound foundation in the basics.  My Shooting Club has several veteran shooters, and they are happy to lend counsel, but we do not have a true professional instructor.  And free advice is often only worth what it costs.  So I started to research many possible sources for guidance and instruction from books, magazine articles, the internet, YouTube, DVDs, etc.  I came across a short excerpt of Harlan Campbell Jr. from this very DVD on YouTube.  His competitive record speaks for itself, but it was his manner of presenting himself and the material that intrigued me.  And most especially, it was watching him actually shoot from a variety of angles: from the side, over his right shoulder, and particularly through the ""eye cam"" that sold me.

The eye cam is great because we get to see what Harlan sees.  Unlike shooting at targets, in shotgun shooting sports there is almost no way to tell where you missed and consequently, how to fix it.  Knowing what to look for and how to see it is critical to developing proper timing and gun movement.  In fact, it is probably the key to what separates the duffers from the high scorers.

I have been devouring the the DVD; watching a little bit everyday and applying it to my own practice at home; the physical drills I've developed for myself, the mental visualization meditations, and the ""self talk"" scripts that I am working on.

Must be working.  I shot a 22 on just my 4th time out.  Some of the old hats said that I must be a ""natural"".  I just smiled and politely said, ""No, just got a real good coach.""

As a life long shooter (mostly tactical) I can say that Harlan's approach, technique, and instruction are superb.  I would definitely recommend this DVD to anyone who is serious about laying down a solid foundation in understanding and performance in trap shooting.",1429574400,,2167,4.574025974025974
8497762,4,B006GS78WS,"There's not much one can do for a trap shooter without seeing them shoot. This video very clearly shows the few steps Harlan Campbell takes as HE shoots. How did it help me? Well, if you don't know who to trust to ask for help, it's nice to know (a) how a successful shooter stands (and why), (b) how does he pick his hold and aim points (and why), and (c) how does he finish his shot (and why).

Harlan's positions were similar to my own, so his advice seemed logical to take instead of trying a bunch of different things to ""improve"". His hold point selection made PERFECT sense to me, and was far different from the advice usually rattled out on various forums. Finally his slight ""forward press"" was foreign to me, but seemed to work well - felt good - and is being incorporated into my own routine.

Bottom Line: I like the video and it was useful to me. I couldn't help but feel there was very little I took out of the 45 minutes . . . but then I realized Harlan had covered everything necessary and everything he could (without watching and correcting ME shooting) in 45 minutes. Probably got more of the fundamentals out of it than I would have gotten out of a much more expensive lesson(s).",1426204800,2,1199,4.3244444444444445
8497763,2,B006GS78WS,"I wrote the following review as a brand new trap shooter that was prepairing to go out and shoot his first round. This DVD didn't cover any of the foundation information I was looking for. An experienced trap shooter could possibly think it's great. I have now found and bought Leo Harrison III trap video that is excellent for the beginner and covers all the information that I found lacking with this video. Leo's video includes all the modern technological tools to present clear information. (original eval follows:)

I'm a mechanical engineer and no stranger to geometry or diagrams drawn to illustrate information. However I found all such info presented in this video very confusing. I found very little useful information in this video and will likely never watch it again. I just received Pachmayr's Trapshooting video that cost me about one third the price of this one. Pachmayr's is a far  better instructional video and I will probably watch it time and again to absorb all the useful information. I recommend saving some money and getting a better instructional video to boot with Pachmayr's Trap.

The Pachmayr video is mid 80's and great for it's era. Leo Harrison video is new tech, more expensive but a great video too and I'm glad I also bought it.",1419379200,3,1266,4.824884792626728
