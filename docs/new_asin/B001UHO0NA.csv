8343748,5,B001UHO0NA,"The Green Green Grass is one of the funniest, wittiest English Comedy series ever!
Such clever writing and the actors are all excellent!!!
Boyce & his wife Marlene were characters on the British series Only Fools & Horses...but I have to say...they really shine in this series!
If you love British Comedy that features funny characters and clever writing...this is the series for you.",1355011200,,384,5.015625
8343749,5,B001UHO0NA,"The #1 British Sitcom of all time was ""Only Fools and Horses"".  And it is hilarious.  We now follow Boycie and Marlene and their attempted escape from the evil Driscoll brothers.  Mind you, this is a REGION 2 DVD set.  If you can't handle PAL/Region 2 material, then don't blame the shipper.  Amazon has made every effort to inform you that this will not play in a standard U.S. DVD player or computer (unless you WANT to convert your computer's DVD player PERMANENTLY to Region 2 and lose access to all U.S. DVDs - Microsoft Media Player warning).  I only hope that the rumoured Series 5 will include a visit from Del Boy or Rodney Trotter.  Meanwhile check out Sir David Jason in ""Rough Diamond"".  That's a cross between ""Porridge/Going Straight"" (difficult to get in the U.S.) and ""Only Fools and Horses"".  Don't be a ""plonker"" and blame Amazon's partners for your inability to understand the Queen's English!  Now, where's my bacon sandwich?",1309392000,,945,4.742331288343558
