8095180,3,B000C1VBB4,"It's hard for me to recommend this set because all but two of these DVDs have very bad transfers.  All but two are pan and scan.  That being said, I believe Geneon [Pioneer] is the only one releasing these titles so if you have a favorite at least the price is low.  Two of the titles are really exellent movies with bad transfers. A Town Called Hell and Have a Nice Funeral really deserve better.

Pancho Villa-good story/great image quality(letterboxed).

Bad Man's River-average story/good image quality(letterboxed).

Captain Apache-average story/poor image quality.

Five Savage Men-good story/poor image quality.

A Town Called Hell-great story/poor image quality.

Have a Nice Funeral-great story/poor image quality.",1139529600,13,723,5.441441441441442
