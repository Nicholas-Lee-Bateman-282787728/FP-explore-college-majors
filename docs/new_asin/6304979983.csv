946307,4,6304979983,"For the first time both ""Curley"" and the sequel:  ""Who Killed Doc Robbin?"" are avaliable in one package on DVD.

However, these are NOT remastered version.  ""Curley"" is a pedestrain story of a boy and his friends and has the kind of flavor ""The Andy Griffith Show"" might have if it had revolved around Opie rather than Andy and Barney.  The treasure is the sequel, which has a scene in the courtroom that is priceless:  a boy--about eleven-years-old--reads a poem about nature and then a second:  ""Bombs Away!""  What a contrast to be illustrating through the innocent lyrics of a child in 1947.

If you're a fan of Little Rascals/Our Gang comedies this is for you; as Hal Roach is responsible for both.  ""Who Killed Doc Robbin?""  is the most entertaining, but ""Curley"" is wholesome entertainment that most preschoolers should enjoy (""Doc Robbin"" will likely be enjoyed by the elementary student and his/her family).

Overall, interesting pieces of cinematic history.",1173052800,5,966,4.975
946308,2,6304979983,"With the popularity of the Bowery Boys ""B"" movies, it is no wonder that HAL ROACH would want to bring his kids comedies back to the screen.  He must have been serious about it, he shot it in CINECOLOR!

The problem here is that while the old Little Rascals/Our Gang comedies had real kids being themselves in humorous situations, this movie had kid actors trying to do a Bowery Boys type of movie in a spooky house.  To make things worse, the kid actors are more annoying that Mickey Gubitosi of the later MGM Our Gang shorts!

And some of the humor is at the expense of the kids, in particular the racial humor of the two black boys called ""DIS"" and ""DAT"".  In a 1920's film one could pass it off as a different time, but by the 1950's racial tensions were building and a call for equality was on the way.  Some of the laughs include seeing one black boy turn white when he is scared, seeing only the black boys eyes glow in the dark as they approach.  There is none of the charm of the originals.

The film seems long even though it runs only 52 minutes (the above mentioned time inclues preview traiers for other DigiView DVDs), Hal has lost his touch.

The DVD quality leaves much to be desired also.  DigiView used poor compression when mastering the DVDs and there is heavy artifacting.  The focus is a little soft as it was mastered from a 16mm reduction print.  Only one color 35mm print is known to exist, so all splices in this movie will be on all copies.  At one time the color elements were thought lost, so we should be happy this one print was found.

Trivia Note: In the early 1970's this movie was re-released to theaters as a matinee double bill with Laurel & Hardy's ""WAY OUT WEST"".  At that time only B&W negatives existed on this title.",1119225600,3,1757,4.330275229357798
946309,1,6304979983,"The End.  Could these be the most wonderful, joyous two words in the English language?  They will be if you suffer through Who Killed Doc Robbin?  You might very well call up all your friends, babbling ""The End"" and giggling hysterically when you are finally freed from the painful affliction of this film.  It is hard to believe that Hal Roach, the man who gave us Our Gang (aka The Little Rascals), could go on to assemble the most annoying group of children the screen has ever seen.  How an otherwise decent actor like George Zucco got caught up in this mess is a total mystery to me.  And they actually bothered to shoot this 1948 dud in color - I guess they had to spend some money on something, since they obviously didn't spend a dime on the script.

In many ways, this movie is a blatant, incredibly misconceived knock-off of Our Gang; this is the kind of thing that should have made Hal Roach froth at the mouth - yet Hal Roach is the very man responsible for it.  These kids nose their way into a murder trial, make a mockery of the courtroom, somehow get to give testimony in the case, and then set off to help their friend (the local fix-it guy who just happens to have built the equivalent of an atomic bomb in the back of his shop) avoid a murder rap.  They end up trapped in something like a haunted house, where hilarity is supposed to ensue but doesn't - not by a long shot.  The gang of bothersome kids includes Curley (sort of the anti-Spanky), Dudley the proto-nerd, a couple of sassy little girls, Speck, and a couple of horribly stereotyped black kids called - I kid you not - Dis and Dat.  I have to single Speck (Dale Belding) out for special attention; he is sort of Alfalfa-like with all of his freckles, his extreme cowardice, and his propensity to faint a lot - but he is no Alfalfa.  Speck is truly the most annoying child character I have ever seen; this kid probably had a charter membership in Overactors Anonymous by the time he turned a year old.  Don't even get me started on Speck.

Maybe there is a child somewhere on this earth who would find humor in this film, but I wouldn't want to meet him/her.  Who Killed Doc Robin? is just abysmal, stupid, and the very opposite of funny.  The film also features a monkey - need I say more?",1105488000,2,2270,4.33096926713948

7880334,2,6304979983,"Sometimes you can't go home again. Producer Hal Roach's attempt to revive the ""Our Gang"" formula (with the help of original director Robert F. McGowan) doesn't work  mainly because the new kids are so unmemorable. Shot in Cinecolor, the low-budget ""Who Killed Doc Robbin"" (1948) has the presence of George Zucco but not much else. Few laughs and no chills in this painfully familiar haunted-house comedy. You're better off watching Spanky and Alfalfa in ""Spooky Hooky"" (1936).",1358812800,2,476,5.181818181818182
7880335,1,6304979983,"Who Killed Doc Robbin, 1948 film

The film begins with questions and answers from children. Next we see a dark and stormy night. Three is an explosion! The police arrive. Ann Loring is arrested on suspicion of Doc Robbin's murder. Five children enter the court room (for comedy). Each testifies about the incident. Curley tells about a fight between ""Fix-it"" Dan and the Doc over the ownership of a secret invention. Dan shows up in court to defend Ann Loring. He is arrested as a suspect and jailed. Can those kids help? The kids go to that mysterious house to investigate. There are spooky noises and comic situations. Not very funny today?

Can they find what they seek? The kids wander around that empty house. When a door is opened a body falls out! There is a strange creature in the basement. A gorilla is on the loose! A section of the wall rotates! They call the police but are not believed. Can Dan escape from jail and go to that house? The police arrive and the mystery is solved. Ann was watching Doc Robbin's activities, he was up to no good?

This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. The only good part is its short length. This was filmed in ""Cinecolor"" which is quite contrasty.",1347148800,,1205,4.493150684931507

The adult cast has Virginia Grey and some great B-movie stars like George Zucco and character actors like Grant Mitchell.  There's comedy mixed in with the crime solving so it's fine for young kids as well as nostalgic-feeling older folks.",1185667200,2,409,4.513513513513513
7880338,2,6304979983,"I would give this delightful ""time capsule"" double bill 5 stars if the transfers weren't so depressingly horrible. CURLY is a dreadful print, but at least it's watchable. DOC ROBBIN is so faded/overexposed that I couldn't bear to watch more than 5 minutes. This is the old 2color CINECOLOR process, which, granted, could never equal the perfection of the true 3strip Technicolor process. But miracles can happen by using today's technology. Look at the remaster of Lugosi's SCARED TO DEATH and you'll see the awesome results of what can be done with a CINECOLOR restoration. I'm going to shelve this DVD for a while in hopes that someone will come up with a pristine redo. Hal Roach Studios has been re-issuing some of their old titles using sparkling new prints--hopefully they'll get around to these 2 little gems someday soon...(as usual, the ALPHA packaging/artwork is absolutely gorgeous...)",1176940800,3,896,5.1020408163265305
