Martin and Saga are my favourite characters in any show I have EVER seen.  This is acting and viewing at it's best.  Don't miss this, especially if you are a murder mystery fan.  I felt like I was manipulated and teased and fed ""red herrings"" all along the way.  It was great!",1500163200,5,402,4.739130434782608
