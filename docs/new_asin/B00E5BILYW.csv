8601355,4,B00E5BILYW,"Finally, Salieri is coming out of the darkness. The 'Amadeus'-given profile
is misleading, even if the decline-period of the teacher of Beethoven, Schubert
and Liszt, is painted somewhat accurately. I have bought before Salieri's 'Tarare'
and 'Europa 'Reconosciutta', the latter a masterpiece. 'Falstaff' will not be a match
for Verdi's namesake -almost a century afterwards-,  but it is worth the listening.",1495929600,,408,5.688524590163935
8601356,5,B00E5BILYW,"I was floored by John del Carlo absolutely outstanding performance in the title role only to find out this magnificent baritone died a year ago, in October 2016. I just found his Met Don Pascuale with Nebretko (whom I loathe.  Putin accolite). Other than that, he is very difficult to find, but he does carry the day. Ringholz, Croft, et. al. also deliver stellar performances.  I'd dare to day as good as Verdi's, and then some. This performance dates back to 1995, at the Schwetzingen Festival.  There are only two other Salieri operas on DVD.  Get them all.  Europa Riconosciuta and Tarare are both gems which deserve serious attention by American opera houses.",1494892800,,664,4.84070796460177
8601357,5,B00E5BILYW,The Verdi Falstaff is well known and certainly the Salieri is a welcome addition to the story.  Very well sung and a welcome addition to the Falstaff canon.,1398902400,,156,4.571428571428571
