2562683,5,B000FFJZHE,"We have been searching for this movie for years under the name of ""A Thousand Men and a Baby."" We were so pleased to finally locate this and get it. This is a wonderful movie that shows us that, even during war, soldiers are people too with emotions and compassion. This movie moves us to tears at times but is an excellent movie about the goodness of humanity. It is an honest-to-goodness ""feel good"" movie for everyone!",1322611200,,421,4.48051948051948
2562684,4,B000FFJZHE,"I was stationed onboard the USS Point Cruz CVE-119 for two years just prior to the incidence of the baby adoption.  This was originally a NBC movie of the week I believe, called ""1000 Men and a Baby"".  The story is true and although I was no longer aboard, I knew many of the men who were.  I was an Aerographer's Mate Third Class then.  The crew of the Point Cruz have a reunion each year and the baby, who is now a grown man, usually attends these meetings.  This movie is hard to find on DVD and I was lucky to have found this one.  It is in excellent condition.  The movie is a heart-warming story.",1285200000,11,602,4.094017094017094
