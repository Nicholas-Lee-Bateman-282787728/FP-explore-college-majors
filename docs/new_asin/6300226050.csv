7806848,4,6300226050,"Afterward is an episode found in a series titled Shades of Darkness, a 1980s British production centering on tales of the supernatural. It was produced by June Wyndham Davies and is an ITV production. Initially there were seven hour-long episodes produced in 1983 and there were an additional two hour-long episodes produced in 1984 and screened in 1986.

Based on a short story by Edith Wharton, the story centers on a rich American and his wife who move into an old English manor reputed to be haunted, although according to the locals, the nature of the haunting is a little strange. Those who see the ghost are unaware of their encounter until some time has passed since the encounter. The lady of the house has a similar experience, with tragic consequences.

I enjoyed this story although the pacing is very slow by today's standards. The deliberate pacing sets the tone which is one of suspense. Viewers get the sense almost from the very beginning that there's a palpable sense of doom hanging over the manor house and the American couple, and that the pair are soon to be engulfed in events that are beyond their control. The acting is top-notch for a TV production and I only wish it had been longer in duration.",1368835200,,1222,4.705607476635514
