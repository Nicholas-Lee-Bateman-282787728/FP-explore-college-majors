History Channel has a ""Failure is Not an Option 2"" that is NOTHING like this one.  Don't be fooled into thinking they are the same.  They are not.  Did the History channel run out of these?  You can't find them anymore.  Did they sell their last copy?  I doubt it.  They could sell more, but, for some reason they haven't.  I wrote to them about it.  If you want a copy of this show, write them too and maybe we'll be able to buy a DVD of it.",1335484800,3,544,4.085714285714285
