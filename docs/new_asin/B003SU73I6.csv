4189724,5,B003SU73I6,"This movie has a lot of laughs, I was surprised, after a few minutes it established a rhythm and maintained it throughout. Also the music in it was woven into the fabric of the movie in such a way that it felt like a musical, and it played that way, and I normally don't respond to that type of material.",1293408000,,304,4.083333333333333
4189725,5,B003SU73I6,"Do you wonder if there are dozens of good movies being made that you've never heard of?  Do you then assume there probably aren't and make yourself a sandwich?  The internet makes me stupid, I know, while making me think I'm on top of things but I probably wouldn't have run across this film without being dragged to it and having liked it as much as I do, I wonder if there can possibly be more like it out there, ""below the radar"".  I never learn so I'm betting there aren't.

I don't want to qualify my enthusiasm by saying it's a small picture obviously made with little dough because you won't care about that after 5 minutes or so.  The cast is large and everyone makes an impression.  The comedy comes from people treating their friends and family with the mixture of care and contempt that is, at least, true to MY experience.  And I've said it before, this movie has music running through it that makes it kind of unforgettable.  It's got a high rating on Rotten Tomatoes and showed at about a hundred festivals so it's not like no one has heard of it.  But it deserves to be seen because it's actually funny and effortlessly so--it makes ""Get Him To The Greek"" or ""The Hangover"" seem like root canal.  If I thought I'd see one movie this good for every 4 bad ones, I'd see a lot more movies.",1280880000,2,1301,4.316872427983539
4189726,2,B003SU73I6,"I love many indie movies but found Harmony sophomoric and boring (at least the part I made it through). The main character was not at compelling (and nearly unwatchable) and many of the actors seemed to have a look on their face as if to say ""Look at me! I'm acting in an indie movie.""

The cinematography was also completely lackluster.

Of course, all of the above is exactly what's fashionable in the film festival circuit these days.",1279411200,,437,4.589743589743589
4189727,5,B003SU73I6,"If you like a snappy, well-written film, this is for you. It's an example of independent filmmaking at its best. Justin Rice plays our protagonist Harmony and perfectly pins the angst and wangst of the newly single. The humor is dry and hits the spot every time. It's not fancy but it will have you rolling on the floor. Buy it, watch it, share it.",1278115200,2,348,4.369230769230769
8404722,5,B003SU73I6,"I had been looking for this movie ever since it got taken down from a major streaming site. This is a mumblecore classic on par with the likes of ""The Fuzzy Chair"", ""Bag Heads, ""RSO"", and later, more polished works like ""Jeff Who Lives at Home.""

Justin Rice is a great, underutilized actor who recently starred in Doomsdays, which was also a classic example of the DIY ethos in Film making.

This movie was one that I obsessed over during a painful breakup. I'd go so far as to say that this is THE movie to watch during any breakup or heartache, as it will lift your spirits entirely, through its poignant and hilarious portrayal of co-dependence, love, and finding oneself a bit late in the game.

Also: Justin Rice plays some awesome songs through out the film, incuding an awesome cover of ""Government Center"" by the modern Lovers.",1493856000,,836,4.597315436241611

8404724,5,B003SU73I6,Sweetly funny movie that keeps your engaged from start to finish. Each charecter is well defined and brings a fun perspective to the leads search for resolution to a failed relationship.

8404729,5,B003SU73I6,Just depicts dude going through a break up and encountering a variety of stereotypes.  I thought all the supporting characters were hilarious.  It isn't super mooshy/feely.  Just a light comedy with down-played humor.,1397520000,,217,5.515151515151516
8404730,4,B003SU73I6,"...has a bit part in this movie, as a wedding singer who hits on the pregnant bride.  That bit made the whole movie. (it's near the middle).  And it didn't hurt that we got to hear his song Changing Your Mind.",1392681600,3,209,4.073170731707317
