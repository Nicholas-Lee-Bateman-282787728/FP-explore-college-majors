SYNOPSES:

ANGELS HARD AS THEY COME-- Two gangs meet in the desert to conclude a drug deal. A girl is killed and the gangs turn on each other. Co-written by action film director Jonathan Demme and distributed by Roger Corman's New World Pictures.

C.C. AND COMPANY-- Motorcycle mechanic joins an outlaw biker gang but refuses to participate in the mayhem they create.

EVEL KNIEVEL-- Shows Knievel's metamorphosis from small town lawbreaker to stunt motorcyclist. A desire to continuously top himself often left this daredevil in traction with multiple bone fractures.

STEAL WHEELS-- Biker tracks his wife's killer through Florida's rural backroads. The manhunt comes to a shocking climax.
