2966902,3,B000WCN8Q4,"Very good film of author, a bit too long to start and we would like some more.
The distribution is excellent, and we take time to know the characters... Too much for my taste.
We would like to have some more: to know what it occurs in their head after their experiment. Will there be repeats?
I've been announced this film as being a comedy, but it is more one drama of manners.
The reactions are realistic (though some other reviews say) and I would have preferred that this vision is looked further into. To see this film in couple can certainly bring a certain discussion.
The play of the actors is right and the realization is without too many artifices. The soundtrack is amazing.
Admittedly a good entertainment but we remain on our appetite.
In my humble opinion, it takes too much time to try to know the protagonists; we would like to really know what occurs AFTER...

OK - I just can not in any way, as hard as I may try, I can't think of Macaulay Culkin as sexy. no way. he is and will always be the cute, goofy little boy in Home Alone. the one that my son wanted to be just like as he grew up watching Home Alone 10 times a week.

why did he get cast in this? did he buy his way in? maybe he has connections? I dunno. but, sorry, he is NOT sexy. he doesn't look old enough to have being having sex! (yes, I know he got married at like 16. aggggg.)

OK, on to the movie. sorry.

it was cute. sort of sexy. I really liked the man in the other couple. I like that woman too. the girl that was doing the diddly with little Kevin, don't know her name, but, she showed her ass in ""Broken Flowers"" ? I believe, the one with Bill Murray. and she was in that sad canceled alien TV show. she is adorable - for a 12 year old. (again, am I getting old, but, these kids look too young to be ""doing it""!!)

the sex therapist part was silly and ridiculous. plus, I kept thinking how do these very young couples afford a sex therapist? don't they know they can just go to craig's list to get all that wife swapping for free?

if you want mindless, sort of cute, pretty young couples that get jiggy - go for it. not horrible. not on my top 100 fav list, missed by about 4000.

The writing is competent but hardly exceptional and the leads acquit themselves just fine. There is nothing explicitly revealed visually and the issues that are raised are not dealt with in any daringly original way or with any kind of complexity, like in Sex, Lies and Videotape.

Sex and Breakfast only really gets interesting at the film's conclusion. If more time had been spent on this part, we might have had a better film. Its fatal flaw is that the film fails to examine its themes in a deeper, more meaningful way and the end result is a fine, if average attempt.",1201737600,6,1613,6.680952380952381
2966907,5,B000WCN8Q4,"The narrative subject of the movie is based on a book written by a former psychologist who worked only with teenagers. Its characters and sociological events are the inspiration of a true story life.
The characters are depicted as handsomely looking teenagers who are about to enter in the struggles of the real world. The sexual exposition of various sexual scenes are presented as an artistic form, a social pattern shaped during the last decade, which it considered as the epoch of the post-sexual revolution. It's a period of teenagers who have started living a cohabitation lifestyle while in a courtship. The sexual explorations are genuine reactions among teen peers whom still experience biological developments in their bodies, i.e. alterations of sexual hormones.
As any couple that encounters hindrances to understand awkward situations of cheating, lying, mistrusting one another, sexual lifestyles of teens have evolved into a more sophisticated social methods which it primarily focuses of resolving their teen issues: parent-children relationship, courtship, education and a preparation for a bright future. Undoubtedly, we are talking about a society that has evolved during the industrialization and high technology, ultimately we may label it as a component of the American dream.
Today, teens don't resolve their issues with tears, arguments and just giving up the problems but rather attempt to reach out psychiatrists, sex therapists, friends, counselors, priests and why not parents or the parent they closer to.
This movie enriches the reality of our society we live in. It gives us an unambiguous picture of ourselves. It depicts our demand for consistent trustful intimacy with our partners, our need to explore more about ourselves while diminishes the complexity of insecurity to commit or make certain important decisions in your life.
The characters in the story are witnesses and contributors of the sociological changes of our pop culture. Every individual is an inseparable part of the this social movement we are living in.
It's a must watch movie! Great cast!",1201651200,,2093,5.384146341463414
2966908,4,B000WCN8Q4,"Though many will avoid this little film because the title and DVD cover suggest a mindless mlange of sexual encounters, those who can get past these flaws will find a well written (Miles Brandman) examination of young people's concepts of relationships and how to keep them.  Brandman also directs this stylish charmer and has at his disposal actors not usually associated with a more serious type of story.

James (Macaulay Culkin) and Heather (Alexis Dziena) are young, attractive and in love, though Heather is finally able to confide in James that she is unable to achieve orgasm in their otherwise satisfactory sex life. Ellis (Kuno Becker) and Renee (Eliza Dushku) are another couple whose intimate life has lost its sparkle.  Each of the couples (who have never met) hears about sex therapist Dr. Wellbridge (Joanna Miles) who supports the concept of group sex as a means to strengthen relationships grown stale.  Each couple meets with the doctor, reveals their insecurities and fears and Dr. Wellbridge arranges a 'session' for the two couples to share  an evening of intimate interaction.  How this 'change' alters each couple's relationship is the message of the film: some surprises are in store that are unsuspected.

Yes, there is comedy here and yes, there is thoughtful dialog, but the pleasure of the film lies in discovering the expanded acting abilities demonstrated by these four young attractive actors.  The film may not be deep, but it does entertain and it most certainly has some useful information about love and relationships we all need to know.
