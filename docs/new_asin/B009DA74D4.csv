5319218,5,B009DA74D4,Great show and the DVDs are in great condition!!!! My wife has been watching them while on vacation and had greatly enjoyed herself!!,1388707200,,133,4.826086956521739
5319219,3,B009DA74D4,"We received some ""bootleg"" copies...not sure why...The reason I know this is because the DVDs do not work in blue ray player or any high end DVD player. They come up as a Data disk and will not play. The only type of player they will work on is a small cheaper brand of DVD player. So it limits where I can watch them.",1383609600,6,318,3.984375

5319221,1,B009DA74D4,I love this show but the quality of these dvds were horrible. Amost as if they had been bootlegged.  The last couple of episodes on all the disc started tiling and were very grainy.  I would not recommend anyone buy these disc.,1369785600,9,227,4.380952380952381
5319222,4,B009DA74D4,"The shows were great, but there was some freezes and a skip in the first season's discs. I would recommend it.",1366156800,,110,4.285714285714286
5319223,2,B009DA74D4,"The first disc loaded into the machine and played fitfully... in places the picture devolved into a blur of pixels and faces were not visible... I was concerned because the disc was painted a mono-toned gray color instead of the color that it comes from the manufacturer... this gray color is famous at netflix for the re-burnt discs they are allowed to make by the people who sell them their licenses... with them it's legal, with this I was wondering.  Disc two and three would not play in my machine and that's when I gave up and sent them back.",1363478400,12,548,4.48
5319224,4,B009DA74D4,I always wanted to see this serial.  It is really good.  The only one thing that I missed was the subtitles in Spanish.,1358380800,,119,4.130434782608695

8540126,4,B009DA74D4,The series was excellent. However the quality of the DVD transfer is atrocious. I wouldn't even buy the whole series for $1! It is just too painful to attempt to watch.,1425600000,,168,4.451612903225806

8540128,3,B009DA74D4,"It took over a month to get the DVDs, but I think that was more of a Post Office problem. Our P.O. out here stinks- they constantly lose our mail. The quality was fine. The show is edgy and funny although I think the writers definitely ripped off Kevin Smith....BIG TIME!",1416873600,,271,4.333333333333333
