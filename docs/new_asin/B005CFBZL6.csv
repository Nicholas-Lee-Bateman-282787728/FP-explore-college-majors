4652940,5,B005CFBZL6,"Gingerdead Man 3 is the best in the Gingerdead Man series so far. It's just a lot of fun from beginning to end. In fact, if I were able to watch two or three movies a week that were as much fun as this one, I would be in Heaven. The Gingerdead Man has more hilarious one-liners than Chucky from the Child's Play series, of which this was definitely influenced by. The only complaint I have is that most of the gore is CGI, but you really don't watch movies like this for the gore, anyway. You watch it to laugh. And the DVD has no extras, not even a trailer. But who cares? This is a must watch for b-movie fans and fans of campy movies.",1316995200,11,637,4.0236220472440944
4652941,4,B005CFBZL6,"Gingerdead Man 3 is a hot mess, all wrapped in 78 minutes. Basically, the Gingerdead Man escapes in a time machine and goes back to 1976 for some reason. The film has alot of plots going on at once and it's hard to keep track of everything. Two kids find the device and disappear, leaving the movie goer wondering where the hell they went and why should we care. I hate the killings, all done with fake CGI blood and it looked horrible. The kids transport back to the roller rink and bring back some unsavory chracters in history like Hitler. Was it fun? Very much so. Will the average movie goer like this? I highly doubt it. I'd recommend this for fans of the series or people who enjoy Full Moon pictures.",1316822400,3,708,4.330827067669173
4652942,3,B005CFBZL6,"First off, let me start by saying that I am in no way a reviewer, I'm a novice at this, and my opinion should probably be void by most.

This review contains spoilers

After being digested, crucified, and locked up Hannibal style, it's time for some revenge! Charlie Band takes us on another ride, through the demented mind of a killer cookie, hellbent on bloodshed.

Story - After cleverly escaping the maximum security Research Institute of Homicidal Baked Goods, the Gingerdead Man stumbles up a time machine and finds himself sent back in time as he slaughters the contestants of a 1970's Roller Boogie Contest. The only hope for survival is when a young girl blessed with the gift of Telekinesis makes the scene.

Setting - Dare I say, the actual setting was quite fun and really stood out as a roller disco rink. The sets were filled with colors, music, decorations, disco balls, almost everything you would think of! I actually felt like I was back in 1976.

Actors/Acting - Okay, for the most part, these are first time actors, and they're not bad, especially considering the budget on which they were hired. Most of the characters are stereotypical, like the bitchy girl who wants to win the contest, the dumb blonds, ""stoners"", and let's not forget the German security guard, or Carri, er, Cherry who seems to lifted right out of Stephen King's Carrie.

Effects - Okay, if it were up to me, I'd ban CGI from every movie company that I could, I absolutely hate it when it's the main source of blood or gore, and that's basically all we get here. For example, there's a scene where a few people are shot, but it's completely comical because of the fake CG blood. There were a few scenes that included some fake blood, but not as much as I'd like. The time warp scenes are done in a way that's not overly horrible, they're probably the effects highlight if you ask me.

Deaths - Without including one major scene in the movie, I counted a total of 15 deaths, and some of them were actually very creative, but I expect nothing less with the a company like Full Moon! The highlight includes acid and a water hose, or possibly the death scene that is very similar to that of Sleepaway Camp 3. There were a few cheap deaths, but I guess they all can't be winners.

Overall, I found the movie very enjoyable. Like I said, it does feel like a 1976 horror movie when you factor in the setting, costumes, music, and let's not forget the cheesy makeover scene, complete with music and random outfight changes! There was some forced humor including a cookie penis, and some toilet humor that really took me out of the film, but most people in my demo range will enjoy it. I think one of the most enjoyable scenes had to be the 1941 flashback, it was hilarious! Oh, and don't get me started on the ending, it's so offbeat and random, but you'll enjoy it!

Disc Stats - The movie itself runs 1 hour and 18 minutes from Full Moon logo, to ending credits, and the bit-rate was at a constant 6.3Mbp/s - 7.6mbp/s, which was very nice. The disc is a single layer and the only extras I received were trailers. There were no subtitles, and the movie is anamorphic widescreen.

All in all, I suggest buying it if you liked the first 2 films, it reminded me alot of Jack Frost 2 with the humor and off beat horror comedy. 7/10",1312329600,7,3312,4.468543046357616
4652946,5,B005CFBZL6,"This is one of THE most hilarious movies ive ever seen. Very creative and clever too... several movie spoofs all in one. Hilarious special effects. My favorite part was the beginning... the silence of the lambs spoof.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",1392422400,,236,5.076923076923077
4652947,1,B005CFBZL6,"After the ridiculously bad GINGERDEAD MAN 2: The Passion of the Crust, if there was any doubt left that Full Moon has nothing but contempt for its audience, GINGERDEAD MAN 3: Saturday Night Cleaver should put all those doubts to rest.  This movie isn't bad, its a big middle finger to everyone who bought or watched Full Moon movies over the last several decades.

First starters, the movie opens at the Scientific Research Institute for the Study of Homicidal Baked Goods where Clarissa Darling from the FBI is there to interview the Gingerdead Man.  After walking past a number of other sentient pastries, she comes to the infamous Millard Findlemeyer--or what was Millard Findlemeyer two movies ago.  Far as I can tell, any history the Gingerdead Man may have had before becoming a cookie is gone.  He doesnt even seem interested anymore in finding a new host body, he just kills because its what he does.

So as Clarissa Darling is interviewing the Gingerdead Man, a group of animal rights activists break in, thinking they're freeing animals.  Gingerdead Man kills the woman unstrapping him, then slips into the time travel research department where he kills two scientists before hopping into a time machine and winding up in the middle of a roller skating rink in 1976.

From here we get terrible parodies of CARRIE and PORKYS as the Gingerdead Man slays his way through the night in a variety of stupid ways (at a late-night car wash outside, he hooks up the water hose to a vat of sulphuric acid that just happens to be on-hand) while the skaters prepare for the annual Miss Roller Boogie contest, the last one theyll ever hold because the owner, Trixie, owes $85,000 in back taxes and is being forced to close the rink (hence the car wash outside, a sad attempt to raise money).

Meanwhile, her niece Cherry White, a mousy little nerdy girl with mild telekinesis, is visiting and getting to meet everyone.  Some of the girls give her a roller boogie makeover and the guy who rents out the skates is falling for her.  Cherry is suddenly a frontrunner for the Miss Roller Boogie pageant, which doesnt sit well with the reigning 4-time queen, Tammy, who decides to get even with Cherry by calling on the services of an all-night pig farm.  I think we can all see where this is going.  Yawn.

And as the night goes on, the Gingerdead Man is killing people.  Double yawn.

There was nothing at all the least bit interesting about this movie.  And I love bad horror movies.  I love parodies of bad horror movies.  But for whatever reason, these elements just didn't come together in a convincing or satisfying way this time.  Everything about this movie grated on my nerves and I found myself checking the time every fifteen minutes to see how much was left.

The actors seem to have no love for the genre, nor any idea they're even parodying anything--with the exception of Laura Kachergus who does a bad Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling impression.  But its not just the acting that drags this movie down, its just a total lack of respect on the part of the filmmakers for their audience.

We watch Full Moon movies because, yes they're goofy and silly and stupid, but at least they used to seem like they were made by people who enjoyed making movies, there was a hint of passion behind those early PUPPET MASTER movies or RE-ANIMATOR or even TRANCERS.  They were cheap and badly acted, but they had heart.

GINGERDEAD MAN 3 is nothing more than Full Moon throwing mud at us.  After the second installment, I thought Silvie St. Croix could only get better as a director, but this movie proves the exact opposite.  And William Butler needs to stop trying to write for this franchise.  As horror comedies go, this one is NEITHER, in a big way.

After seeing the third part of this series, I never thought Id say it but I miss Gary Busey.  Thats what GINGERDEAD MAN 3 has done to me.  Now I need a shower, because after sitting through 78 minutes of this movie, Im definitely unclean.",1385510400,,3988,4.622159090909091

4652954,2,B005CFBZL6,"The Gingerdead Man is back on the run after escaping from an asylum for criminally-insane baked goods, and with the help of a conveniently-placed time machine, he is headed to 1976 to stir up some trouble at a local roller rink! The ingredients for this episode include two tablespoons CARRIE, a pinch of SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER, and a splash of SILENCE OF THE LAMBS as the Gingerdead Man passes through one silly spoof after another. GINGERDEAD MAN 3 takes just a tiny step back from the last hilarious entry in the series, providing more gore but fewer laughs along the way. The roller rink serves as such a strange setting for the film, and far too much time is spent actually trying to develop the characters considering this is a movie about a freakin' killer cookie. Regardless, it shows the same high production values that were found in the second film, and legitimately looks like it could have stepped out of the 70's (minus a few computerized kills). Fans of the first two films will be sure to enjoy the latest in the GINGERDEAD MAN series!

4652957,1,B005CFBZL6,THIS MOVIE IS OLD AS DIRT AND IF I HAD REALIZED IT WHEN I WAS VIEWING IT I WOULD NOT HAVE PURCHASED IT. I THOUGHT I WAS GETTING A SAMPLE OF A CHILD'S PLAY TYPE MOVIE.  NOT!!!,1350518400,,174,3.7027027027027026
4652958,3,B005CFBZL6,"I gave this a moderate rating, but all in all you really can't give a movie like this a bad rating considering the title and plot really leave no mystery as to what kind of movie you're dealing with here.
The newest addition to this Full Moon franchise has the Gingerdead Man escaping from an institution for homicidal baked goods(I think I heard about an institution like that on Jesse Ventura's show), stumbling across a time machine and being whisked away to 1976 where he spreads terror at a roller rink.  Oddly enough, The Gingerdead Man himself doesn't seem to be the central character, but merely secondary to the teen drama plot of it being the last night of the Roller Boogie before it's closed down.
Like most of Full Moon's output anymore, this movie is a full blown zany comedy rather an any kind of serious attempt at a horror film, and rightly so, considering no one would take it seriously as a horror film to begin with.  But the problem I found is that it just isn't funny.  Like so many of these movies the humor is of the juvenille sexual variety(example: Hot chick has threesome with boyfriend and a grimy, yucky old janitor because she's under the influence of drugs and thinks the janitor is actually a cute young guy...........Hardy Friggin' Har!!).  The Gingerdead Man goes around making crude sexual jokes, sprouting profanity, and making one-liners that would make Dr. Giggles groan.  Now, this might have actually have been funny had we not seen it eight million times before.  Damn you, Chucky, for introducing the concept of the cutesy, doll-like potty mouthed killer!!
Another gripe is that the movie almost has a Scary Movie vibe with all of it's spoofs/homages.  The beginning of the film is all Silence Of The Lambs, then we get Saturday Night Fever(naturally), Roller Boogie(of course), the hole-in-the-bathroom-wall scene from Porky's, and a big chunk of the prom plotline from Carrie(the leading lady is a repressed, shy, , telekinetic girl named Cherry Wright who goes through an ugly duckling transformation and invokes the wrath of the current Roller Boogie queen who plans on dumping pig blood on her.  Plus she has an overbearing aunt who doesn't want her to roller skate).  Too much time and energy seems to have been spent on faithfully spoofing these films than with anything else in the movie.  And again, it's been done too much before.
Gore?  All CGI.  But what do we expect anymore?  Awful.
Even with all of my bitching, this movie is worth a watch if like off the wall horror comedies, and especially if you're a fan of the previous two films.  It's just intersting enough to watch and actually does have a few chuckles here and there.  And, like most Full Moon films these days, it's very short.",1347753600,,2745,4.7494736842105265
4652959,4,B005CFBZL6,"Not meant as a complaint, but for a movie titled Gingerdead Man 3 you'd think the little cookie would have had the starring role and not a shot as a special guest star.  That said, it is an amusing send-up of several films.  Of course, if you'd never seen any of the films referenced, you might not chuckle as much.  I have so I did.  Plus, there's just something so idiotic about a homicidal cookie that I can't help but respond by laughing.  The rest of the nonsense in this film only helped lighten the load, the burden of everyday life.  A few laughs, a little mayhem, who could want for more?  Me.
I'd like a Gingerdead Man 4.  Please.  With or without raisins.",1340323200,2,666,4.306451612903226
4652960,4,B005CFBZL6,"Who would have thought the Gingerdead Man would have survived to see a third installment? Well somehow our little murderous baked good has blessed us with yet another appearance chock full of more vulgar chaos. While watching some may even shout ""look at the scoreboard its chaos!"" This film, or the other two, are absolutely in no way for the serious movie viewer as there will be no enjoyment to be had. To appreciate any of the Gingerdead series one must be willing to abandon any form of logic or actual thought provocation. Even with those actions being taken you may ask yourself ""why am I watching this?"" but just cast those thoughts aside. That kind of thinking will lead you to hate this movie. Now with that said, Gingerdead Man 3 was very entertaining in the dumbest way possible. Honestly if you're insane enough to sit through three of these films then you really have no choice but to get a kick out of them, so there's no sense in bashing. Just by the title and concept the film doesn't lend itself to any sense of seriousness, so why treat it as such? Just have a good time, maybe toke up, and enjoy some Gingerdead goodness.

We open Gingerdead Man 3 in Silence of the Lambs fashion as our little baked maniac is strapped up in a cell like Hannibal Lecter. When a group of animal rights activist bust into the physc ward the Gingerdead Man breaks loose and transports himself back to 1976. Once the transport takes place he finds himself in the middle of a roller skating risk with a Disco competition. As Rog your delicious deejay plays that funky music the Gingerdead Man begins some loin lashing and slashing. That's pretty much the entire film...seriously. The humor is the typical over the top nonsense which has given this series its very small cult following. One thing to note is how much the Gingerdead Man himself has progressed since 2005. Charles Band pumped about 15 extra dollars into giving him some real looking eyeballs which adds a nice element. It's quite the upgrade from the cheap hand puppet in the original...however that one had Garey Busey. Let's not forget that Busey is currently bankrupt yet wouldn't go anywhere near this or the second installment. I guess being paid in Big Uns wasn't enough to temp Busey, but it may for a fourth.

After sitting through GDM3 we actually thought there is no way they can make another one of these. As much as we love the little crunchy killer it seems his schtik has become a bit stale...huh huh get it? stale? Oh boy! Enjoying your Christmas presents baby? There comes a time when even the most desperate of souls, like Charles Band, needs to put it bed before it just isn't fun anymore. Don't get us wrong because we did enjoy GDM3, especially the scene where hes whacking it like Beavis in Anderson's tool shed...or Santa in the office file room. However let's hope this is this last one so the idea of the Gingerdead Man can be enjoyed for years to come. It's like Death Ring, where you have a beautiful film, but even 3 of those would have taken away from the perfection of the original. So we will recommend GDM3 for those who enjoy the series, but outside of that deranged group of individuals we cannot advocate watching. It only hits a select group on certain cylinders.",1338163200,6,3260,4.580479452054795
4652961,5,B005CFBZL6,"I must first say that I love horror films of all types, from your camcorder hand held B-movie to the most mainstream serial slashers. What makes Gingerdead Man 3: Saturday Night Cleaver,and quite frankly the entire Gingerdead Man series so entertaining for me, is the fact that the humor in and of itself harkens back to some of the great films of the 70's, 80's and 90's. I enjoyed the thought that went into bringing back popular scenes from more mainstream films into the realm of the Gingerdead Man. From Silence of the Lambs to Carrie to Porky's and more this campy film will turn any night into a night full of fun, laughs, and killer pastries.",1330732800,2,650,4.564102564102564
4652962,3,B005CFBZL6,"The third entry in the Gingerdead Man series is really a roller disco comedy with occasional cameo appearances by the Gingerdead Man. He's far from the main character or main focus of the film, which is mostly about a roller queen contest to save a roller rink that might have to shut down because of unpaid taxes. The Gingerdead Man himself is just a weird sidebar in his own movie.

The CGI is terrible, and the Gingerdead Man looks different from the previous films. The lame-o puppetry was one of the things that made parts 1 and 2 so ""great,"" so I didn't care for his new look. I would have much rather seen little puppet legs walking around than this poorly animated CGI action.

Worth watching if you're into the series, but I think the second film was the best of the three, despite having some seriously annoying characters.",1328745600,,833,4.546666666666667

It spoofs Saturday Night Fever, Silence of the Lambs, Carrie, Porky's, Tootsie, and more. The little Gingerdead man is back and more brutal and foul-mouthed than ever. When he's sent back to 1976, he decides to kill the contestants of a roller-disco contest. Cherry Wright (Carrie spoof) is the new girl that everyone picks on, but she's given a makeover and becomes more popular. She falls in love, but tries to kill the evil Gingerdead man before time runs out. This will probably be the last in the trilogy.
