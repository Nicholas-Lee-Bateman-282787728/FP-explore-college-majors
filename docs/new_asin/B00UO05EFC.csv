7064241,3,B00UO05EFC,"SW Scott is still sophmoric funny,  there were thought provoking interludes throughout.  It only received 3 stars due to it not being quite what I thought it would be after seeing the preview clips.",1431907200,,198,4.794117647058823
7064242,4,B00UO05EFC,"Ted (Seann William Scott) lived in a small town and moved to California. His biography is quickly given to us in the first few minutes. We discovered he was bullied (Rob Riggle) in school, berated by his seventh grade teacher (Beth Grant), and had a crush on a little blond girl (Mackenzie Marsh).  His dad (Clancy Brown) died when he was young leaving him to live with his uncouth brother (Garret Dillahunt) and mom (Connie Stevens) who has taken up with a female Elvis impersonator (Diane Ladd). When his wife Penny (Elisha Cuthbert) leaves him, he vows to return home, complete a bucket list and kill himself.

In an attempt to complete his bucket list, he discovers that life has moved on and his bucket list doesn't go as planned. Along the way he meets Greta (Olivia Thirlby) who he confides his plan. Greta insists on filming the events as his ""Death Muse.""

The film deals with teenage homosexuality seriously and sleep walking masturbation not so seriously. This is an indie style quirky comedy/drama/romance whose message is to fill up your life to get rid of the emptiness.

Guide: F-bomb. No nudity. Implied sex. Female masturbation. Genitals outlined. Biggest camel toe I have every seen.",1431820800,14,1201,4.84390243902439
7064243,4,B00UO05EFC,"Seann William Scott has really stepped up as an actor. Being typecast as Stiffler must have been a hard hole to crawl out of however my wife and I agree he is starting to come into his own. After his outstanding performance in Goon he comes in with Just Before I Go and does an excellent, believable job as a person who doesn't have it all figured out. Courtney Cox directs this movie which has ups and downs along with real life situations that people actually deal with daily. She pulls the best out of the actors in this movie, even David Arquette's small part is a notable performance. This is not an Oscar worthy movie however its a great feel good movie that will make you think about life. My wife and I really enjoyed this movie, we hope you do too.",1431820800,3,757,4.300699300699301
7064244,3,B00UO05EFC,"The writer tries to be funny. Its unfortunate because the inappropriate sexual references and acts fall flat and do not forward the plot.
Casual sex outside of marriage and homosexuality are depicted, so if that bothers you, skip this.
The writer assumes drawings of male genitalia are funny.

If your young enough and new enough to sexuality then maybe references to sexuality might be considered funny. To the rest of the adult population...those references were a waste of film time.

There are way to many excuses given  for bullying by adults and by children.

Still, the film gets a few stars for allowing the viewer to rethink some life events via several viewpoints.
The main character is suicidal. The writer manages to take that portion of the story fairly seriously.

The topic of suicidal thoughts and final days is important. I give the writer credit for trying.
Im guessing that the first draft was seen as way to heavy so all those attempts at sexual humor, were an attempt to lighten the mood. They came across as school boy additions to a serious topic.

I hope  this film writer  meets the next topic head on as opposed to tossing in bad jokes to diffuse the tension.

The film is worth seeing. See it alone first before you recommend it to someone else. The context is problematic enough that this cant be recommended to teens.

To those of you looking for sexy nude scenes...these aren't in there. The reviews state there is sex in this movie but its sexual reference and innuendo. If your looking for cheep nude scene thrills, move on.",1431734400,2,1556,4.708487084870849

7064246,3,B00UO05EFC,"My life had been a complete failure sure, but at least I could get my death right. Ted (Scott) has given up. His marriage has just fallen apart and he is left with only one option. He is returning to his hometown to tell off his old teacher, fight the man that bullied him in school and then kill himself. After finding the teacher, things don't go as planned and he starts to re-think his plan. This movie is surprising. It is at once funny, sad and entertaining. I expected this to be a very funny movie, and while it had its funny parts the movie is much more sweet and heartfelt that I expected. This deals with some very heavy issues, but in a way that it doesnt seem preachy or in your face about it. I did like this but it wasn't what I was expecting, not that that is a bad thing. Overall, a funny and heartfelt movie that wasn't what I thought it was going to be. It was better. I give it a B.",1431302400,9,902,4.044692737430168
7064247,4,B00UO05EFC,"I was pretty interested to witness Sean William Scott (aka: Stifler) in a role other than that of,...well, Stifler?!  There's been many actors try and many succeed when they finally get that chance to show a different side of their skills.  Unfortunately,...Scott just doesn't seem to have that set of skills.  He comes off very forced in any sort of ""dramatic"" scene, but that's not to say he didn't play a great role overall.  Other than a couple hard-to-witness ""acting"" scenes he does a great job doing what he does best,...making us laugh!

Ted Morgan (Sean William Scott) has been pushed around his entire life.  After high school he decides to leave town and never come back.  Once out in the real world, he discovers things aren't much different and after his girlfriend, Penny (Elisha Cuthbert) leaves, he decides it is time to end things once and for all.  Ted heads back to his home town to face his past and finally leave the world behind.

Like I said, Scott (with the exception of a few scenes) was great!  I thought he was perfect for the role.  He has this awkwardness about him that just makes you feel sorry for him and what he's going through.  Rob Riggle plays Rawly Stansfield.  Rawly was the bully in school that constantly tormented Ted.  I'm not sure what it is about Rob Riggle, but this guy makes me laugh?!  He does a great job!  Basically, everyone in the film was great in their perspective roles.  My only major complaint was some of the stuff that could have been left out.  This is NOT a kid friendly movie.  The scenes with Kate Walsh could have been subtracted because they really bring nothing to story.  While being really funny (and awkward) the first time,...the second, third, fourth, etc,..just loses the shock value.  Again, just a small complaint.

Final Verdict:  Definitely one to check out!",1431043200,8,1835,4.683385579937304
7064248,4,B00UO05EFC," a spoiler-free review 
At its heart, Just Before I Go is about how people perceive the same thing differently. First-time director Courteney Cox (of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Friends/dp/B00B1LN8WY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Friends</a>&nbsp;fame) does a proficient job of putting into motion a premise ripe for exploration, this time penned by screenwriter David Flebotte (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Desperate-Housewives/dp/B007WWRGAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Desperate Housewives</a>). If you've read the blurb then you know that the protagonist is planning to do himself in, which gives the impression that Just Before I Go will be a dark comedy. Comedy yes, but not nearly as dark as you might imagine. The film succeeds in balancing humor and drama; the humor is solid and consistent without being overbearing (most of the time), and it works to best effect due to the audience being able to empathize with the characters (in varying degrees).

The MVPs may be Olivia Thirlby as Greta and Garret Dillahunt as ""Lucky."" Most will know Olivia Thirlby from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Juno/dp/B0019I6WDG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Juno</a>, but I became a fan after seeing her outstanding performance in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/What-Goes-Up/dp/B002JTJWJA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">What Goes Up</a>; she is finally getting more roles in film, and I'm very much looking forward to seeing her in several that are in pre- or post-production as I write this. Garret Dillahunt, a character actor whose face you may recognize, is all in with a tour de force as the domineering brother/ husband/ father/ cop named Lucky (the reason for this name is revealed at film's end). Evan Ross of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mockingjay/dp/B00UBRHDRU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mockingjay</a>&nbsp;did a convincing Romeo, adding to an already strong cast.

The humor is not for everyone (and if you find masturbation offensive, then don't rent this), but Just Before I Go kept me glued to the screen and chuckling away for 95 minutes.",1430956800,20,2256,6.850174216027875

7064258,5,B00UO05EFC,"Well if your expecting the Sean William Scott character of American pie
and Dude Where's My Car, then you will be disappointed, which is the
only reason I can see people giving bad reviews. Which is still no
excuse. This is why I think movie critics are saying he's no longer a
good actor and done. But they know not what they are talking about, and
as usual with their critique they are dead wrong.

He does a very good acting job in a serious/dark comedy/Drama. It is
very good all around about life in general to a point, with some very
good points, and just insight. I recommend this to anyone who wants a
good night of sitting and watching a very entertaining movie.

Take a chance you will not be disappointed.",1463788800,,716,4.37593984962406

7064260,5,B00UO05EFC,"I am sure you have all read the reviews. So mine will be short. The exceptional cast is some of the best acting I have seen. The score is perfect and retrospective. Sean William Scott is an underrated actor and delivers.. He is a sad sack with baggage who decides his life is not worth a fig, and makes a `revenge list of regrets' before he kills himself. He does a wonderful job of underplaying his role so the rest of the marvelous cast can play off him. The message is not surprising. When you think your life is a bowl of s**t, you may be surprised, so is everyone else's.

By the way, the Whammy symbolizes hope.",1462665600,,617,4.228813559322034

7064267,5,B00UO05EFC,"This was a very nice feel-good film. It is the kind of movie that will leave you smiling when it is over. Sean William Scott is an exceptionally good actor and very under-rated. You travel with him in his transformation, rooting for him all of the time. It was also good to see the great Clancy Brown, one of the best character actors of our generation, abet in a small but important part. Also, I was pleased to see the beautiful and talented Missi Pyle. I really wanted more of her and the always reliable Rob Riggle giving a top performance. And Connie Stevens showed everyone that she still has IT.

Emotion filled movie that is one of those rare ones that I believe everyone should see and would enjoy. Such a great story and it hits all the bases in a way I've never seen done better. It takes somewhat cliche characters and situations and makes them realistic relate-able believable, and even the message of the story that has been over done and relayed so many ways it's exhausted making it just words... this movie does it so well that it is actually gives real meaning and feeling behind it, it makes it matter, makes a difference, turns something you hear into something worth listening to.

7064274,5,B00UO05EFC,"""Just Before I Go"" is such a great and underrated movie. The main character (who I know and think of as Stiffler from American Pie) has decided to kill himself, but before he does it, he's going to confront all the people who made his life such a living hell. That's where any resemblance to a stereotypical movie ends and the really funny, brilliantly creative, unexpected twists and turns begin. This movie is directed by Courteney Cox (Friends) and her ex-husband David Arquette is one of the stars. You can definitely see the influence of Friends all over the place, and if you think hard enough you can actually figure out which character in the movie sort of resembles the character in the show. (I thought it was interesting what she did with Chandler.) Normally my husband and I can scroll through 200 movies on VOD and not find one that we agree on, but this one we both watched really raptly. It's a serious movie with a meaningful message, but you're sort of laughing and incredulous the whole way through. I can't praise ""Just Before I Go"" enough, it's a really human movie, and I love it and hope to see much more like this in the future. GREAT CINEMA!",1446249600,,1165,4.5260663507109005

7064279,4,B00UO05EFC,I enjoyed this movie although seems a bit slow it really pulls you in. Good story line and incredible chemistry between actors. I recommend this move as it is certainly worth of a watch.,1444089600,,186,4.5
7064280,4,B00UO05EFC,"A man returns to his old home town to kill himself after crossing off a few things on his bucket list while there. Such as confronting his school days' bully and telling the only girl from his school days who was nice to him, who he also had a crush on, what that meant to him.  However it is when he goes to tell off a teacher who he blames for derailing his life through humiliation, that he meets her adult granddaughter, who makes his plan a little bit less clear.  As does the fact his bully and the little girl from his school days aren't those things anymore.  Then you throw in Wammy and the dysfunctional life of his brother's family and things might not go as planned.

It's a decent movie, actually a lot better than I thought it would be.  Sean William Scott doesn't play the immature man child he normally does, however the movie does include his brother's wife doing something while asleep to cater to those who bought this after that type of humour, as well as some other younger age school boy type visual humour throughout.  It does cover some serious topics, obviously suicide and depression but also struggling with sexuality in a bigoted parent household and school, as well as other issues by the supporting characters that are not just thrown in, but done well.",1443830400,,1283,4.508620689655173

7064285,4,B00UO05EFC,"While the main character's overall arc is predictable, how he gets there is not. There are some wild and crazy detours on this journey. I didn't feel the full depth of Ted's despair, so that left me feeling like something was lacking. But overall, I really enjoyed this exploration of how every single human being has problems. This movie is not a showcase of perfect, glamorous, wealthy people. It depicts people from different backgrounds and walks of life with real lives.

I was never a fan of Seann William Scott (probably because of the super-goofy movies he's usually done), but he played his part well, if not 100% convincingly. I used to want to dislike David Arquette (I don't even remember why), but the last few performances I've seen him in were very well done. Evan Ross is outstanding.

7064310,3,B00UO05EFC,man they really tried to make a movie here. Scott does his level best to put something into the lifeless dialogue and plodding movement of the movie. it's artless and dumb but tries to be more.,1434412800,,193,4.388888888888889
7064311,5,B00UO05EFC,"This movie may have been overly ambitious, as it addressed multiple issues instead of sticking to one or two. Nonetheless, it has a great cast and the acting is excellent from top to bottom. I thought the leader of the pack of high school homophobes was particularly good.",1434067200,,272,4.6875

7064314,1,B00UO05EFC,"Don't waste your time on this one. There are a few moments spread throughout the movie that are okay, some even slightly funny, but bad acting, bad directing, and characters narrating their own flaws ultimately take over.",1433376000,,221,5.0
7064315,5,B00UO05EFC,"Who knew Garret Dillahunt could be so darn funny? I've seen him in so many shows and movies, and he's generally always a nasty piece of work. Like in Deadwood, The Road, The 4400. But he was seriously so funny in this I found myself unexpectedly laughing out loud at the things he said and his delivery that I was flabbergasted. It was just so unexpected.

The story itself was pretty heartfelt and moving, and really made me think, and appreciate more what I have (not that I don't but it made me more appreciative). The writing was fantastic. I checked David Flebotte's filmography on IMDB, and this appears to be his first feature film. And I hope it isn't his last.

This movie was an unexpectedly great film in my books. I was stunned to see the credits too, that it was directed by Courtney Cox.

I think if you like heartwarming family comedies, such as The Way. Way Back, this movie should appeal.

My only negative is no extras on the blu-ray. But I'd not take a point off for that.",1433376000,,991,4.398907103825136

7064318,5,B00UO05EFC,"Absolutely outstanding movie.... I am talking an insatiably brilliant - incredibly superb - laugh - cry - laugh - cry - cry - cry - laugh - type of movie. It really gets to the heart of life on a multi faceted level that you can feel with every emotion you have - and then some!! As a person who is a huge movie buff - ""Just Before I Go"" is definitely one that is in my top 5 all time favorite movies that I have ever seen. The acting is spot on outstanding, and I loved how the story's plot keeps you guessing -- This was not one of those cheesy you know what's going to happen next fluff type movies.... Courtney Cox - Hats off to you - This movie was a masterpiece, and I can't wait to see what you make next!!! A+++++++++",1433116800,7,725,3.9726027397260273

I'll never think of Sean William Scott just as Chester Greenburg again. And Garret Dillahunt was hilarious. I want more movies like this.",1433030400,2,286,4.415094339622642

7064322,4,B00UO05EFC,"I did like this movie, however I felt there was a bit to much going on. I think the situation with Kate Walsh could have been gone, as well as the situation with The mother, That time could have been used to maybe go into the nephew's issues a bit more, or maybe taking a look at  the High School Friends situation in depth. All of the situations were real life things that we have witnessed happening with friends/family/ neighbors ect.. so they were not way out there, but some took an odd turn, to make them seem a bit far fetched.",1433030400,,534,4.235294117647059

7064330,5,B00UO05EFC,"I was very surprised at how good this movie was actually had some depth to it. from the trailer I thought it was just pure comedy and of course the main actor and his movies he's known for, I thought this was just going to be a cheesy laugh. but I laughed and I cried. Very good and moving.",1432857600,,290,3.9322033898305087
7064331,5,B00UO05EFC,"This movie has something in it for everyone.  I had earlier hesitated watching since I prefer action, thrillers and adventure flicks but checking out the trailer got me hooked.  So glad I rented - emotional and thought-provoking; definitely hit on a few scenarios with which I am very familiar.  Highly recommended!",1432598400,,315,5.137254901960785
7064332,4,B00UO05EFC,"I don't know if this is a 4-star movie or not, but I will wholeheartedly admit that it held my interest the entire time. The very audacity to try to push off something like this on the viewing public quite simply gives me hope that there are still people out there who want to tell unique stories and be different and unsafe. Eggs are meant to be broken and ""Just Before I Go"" certainly does this.

I mean, who would have the audacity to mix depression and suicide with the filthy degrading humor of ""American Pie""? These guys would. Seann William Scott plays Ted Morgan, a guy who is ready to end his life and wants to make amends with all the people he has hurt over the years. Maybe the creators thought that because they had Seann William Scott from ""American Pie"" that the audience would buy some ridiculously dirty humor like a sleepwalking masturbator or a guy getting aroused in obvious fashion by the female police officer who arrested his brother. That's why I'm not sure if this is a good movie or not because these tactics could possibly be called cheap, tactless or capitalizing, but they worked. I was watching and I was laughing and I was either enjoying what I was watching or fascinated by the strangeness of it all.

""Just Before I Go"" is a rude crude thought-provoking movie that will definitely hold your interest in one way or another; mostly because you won't believe what you're watching. The truth is though, there's a lot of reality and heart to the movie. You walk away from the craziness with a lot of thoughts to contemplate and that is its ultimate victory. Life is too complicated to judge it based on past experiences. Life can change on a dime and movies can be multi-faceted.",1432512000,,1708,4.542207792207792

7064334,5,B00UO05EFC,"Great movie! Hilarious, yet inspiring and heartfelt. It's one of those rare movies that manages to convey a deep message about life while also making you laugh. I highly recommend this film for people who like movies about soul searching that don't leave you depressed, but rather inspire you and make you laugh instead.",1432252800,2,320,4.944444444444445

7064337,5,B00UO05EFC,"This movie made me laugh out loud, cry and most importantly didn't leave me feeling terrible afterwards. Luv'd it!!!! Sean William Scott was great in this movie! (But he's a good actor so there's no surprise it's just that people aren't used to seeing him outside of the 'Stiffler' role. Can we get past that people please?) anyway, it's rated R so this film is not for children, it has crude adult humor and mature issues, which is what I liked so very much,but the good stuff doesn't end there, serious topics are highlighted in such a way that I can't even describe. Watch this movie, it's so cool. I was pleasantly surprised by this film and I'm purchasing the DVD ASAP.  If you are offended by certain types of jokes then this movie isn't for you. Courtney Cox did a freaking awesome job and the actors all brought their A game.  This should become an instant classic.",1431993600,,873,4.518987341772152
7064338,2,B00UO05EFC,"The story line started off strong. Then the brothers wife (funny) but come on...the 2 stars are for the last 10 min of the film. With the brothers speech. So lots of BS in between. Is it worth renting....yes. Is it a keeper? Not really so just before you go....you should watch it. If not. Your life will be complete with or without it. :) however ""American loser"" was way better.",1431993600,,380,4.366197183098592
8707681,4,B00UO05EFC,"I thought Courteney Cox did a fine directling job in bringing the disparate elements of this comedy-drama together for an upbeat rom-com conclusion. The movie itself kept me entertained throughout, and I thoroughly enjoyed its subversive streak. Seann William Scott plays Teddy, a man who returns to his hometown in Massachusetts to confront those people in his past whom he blames for a negative impact on his life. Once his first mission is accomplished, he hopes to commit suicide. Along the way, he gets involved with other people's lives, most notably the granddaughter of a vicious school teacher as well as a former school bully's family.

Teddy's brother (brilliantly portrayed by Garret Dillahunt) is the Chief of Police and his home life appears to be unraveling, due to a wife who confronts any house guest with sleep-walking plus  masturbation (if such a thing exists).  Also, his closeted son has an openly gay boyfriend, but he is so fearful that his parents and friends will reject him for being gay that, like his uncle, he considers suicide the only way out. Granted, this movie is chock full of verbal political incorrectness, but in a thoroughly honest way.",1530489600,,1176,4.989795918367347
