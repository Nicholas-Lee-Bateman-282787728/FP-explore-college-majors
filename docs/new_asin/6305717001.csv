1070060,1,6305717001,"A shining example of how a movie trailer is better than the actual film itself.  It's the story of a washed-up film writer on the brink of being edged out of the industry unless he can manage one decent story/script.  Albert Brooks MUST have a LOT of friends in the business.  I can think of  no other explanation for HOW this film got made in the first place.  In the  best interest of your sanity, avoid spending money on this one.  Wait until  it shows up on Fox or something.",952819200,2,479,4.2444444444444445
1070061,1,6305717001,"A movie in search of a good script, ironically enough. Well, maybe not so much a good script as a good editor. There is a lot of dead time in this movie between the not particularly funny set pieces. Albert Brooks gives  himself some funny lines, Macdowell is atrocious (she's not even trying,  for goodness sake), Bridges is almost unused, Stone we are meant to think  as some sort of saint, and there we have it. Lumbering from one average,  name-dropping set piece to the next for an hour and a half. Hmm. If that's  your idea of fun, then be my guest...
This is so unfortunate, as there is  the glimmer of a good idea here, and at least Brooks and Bridges are such  terrific actors, given the right script. If you haven't already done so,  give ""Out of Sight"" and ""The Big Lebowski"" a watch  instead.....",952041600,3,808,4.405405405405405

I loved Brooks' brilliant witty, observant, self-depricating dialogue.  His scripts must be a joy to  read through.  I thought Sharon Stone would ruin the movie but I actually  found her humorous and sweet.  The DVD has little to offer other than a  VERY FUNNY trailer with Brooks narrating.

1070064,1,6305717001,"I love Albert Brooks, the west coast neurotic, whose wit and witlessness in his films draw comparisons to one of my favorite star/writer/directors: Woody Allen. I love many of Albert Brooks films. Modern Romance is a  wonderful film, one of his best. Defending Your Life a neat little  diversion, funny, inventive. That is why the news I have to report on his  latest offering, THE MUSE, is hard to spit up. It is a bomb. It is unfunny.  It made me writhe about out of control for over 90 minutes. I almost walked  out of the room, something I have never done in the middle of a film. I  hated the thing. I did not laugh one single, solitary time. This is why I  am being particularly harsh on the film. It is a movie by someone I think  has a gift at filmaking, yet he makes a film about filmaking that is so  absurd and lifeless it almost makes you think he never made one in his  life. There is a good movie swimming deep deep deep within this wretched  little piece. The film is called THE PLAYER. Buy that instead. As for Mr  Brooks, one can only think that maybe he has lost his edge, much like that  of the character he portrays in THE MUSE. Or maybe he is lost in Hollywood,  much like he was LOST IN AMERICA so long, and so many laughs, before.",951177600,5,1253,4.188284518828452

1070067,4,6305717001,"Love the way Brooks demonstrates the relative irrelevance of Hollywood scriptwriters. Though it's hard to well and truly sympathize with a character of such financial means and the film does craftily illustrate the  vanity and blind willingness to go along with anything that will help them  maintain their life of luxury  - the Brooks character making it plain that  he wants to write big blockbusters in favor of indie films - in order of  course, to live the high life.

1070068,3,6305717001,"The Muse is a gentle little comedy from Albert Brooks featuring Sharon Stone as a muse that comes at a very high price.  What makes this movie special is Sharon Stones performance.  She proves she is not just a former  model, but a very gifted and talented actress as well.  She seems to be  picking better roles these days, and staying away from the typecasting.  The script is light-hearted and sweet, and always fun to watch.  All in  all, a very entertaining film that suggests the best muse is the one inside  of us.",950572800,3,521,4.457446808510638
1070069,5,6305717001,"Albert Brooks to me is a very funny guy. I've enjoyed many of his films in the past such as ""Lost In America"",and ""Mother"". And once again Brooks makes a very funny movie. Brooks who in ways reminds me  of Woody Allen-this isn't anything new,many people have said the same  thing. The reason I think of Allen when watching Brooks's work is because I  can't really think of another comedic film maker who is as witty. Brooks's  comedy is very verbal. And this movie has it's share of great one liners.  For instance in the very first scene we see Cybill Shepherd(Who is one of  many to make a cameo)presenting Brooks with a humanitarian of the year  award. When driving home,Brooks is putting his daughter to sleep. She asks  him....""Daddy what's a humanitarian?"" Brooks replies...""It's  someone who's NEVER won the oscar!"" Now who else could of think of  that comeback? Another highlight is Andie Macdowell was very good in her  role as well.",949363200,2,942,4.717791411042945

Fortunately, Brooks finds a muse, in the form of Sharon Stone, to kick-start his creativity.  Stone disrobes in one brief scene, in which she jumps naked into a bed, and wriggles her luscious bare body between the freshly-laundered sheets.  That image of Sharon Stone completely unclothed, though brief, is stunning, and lingers in one's mind.

Free On-line Dictionary

Hollywood seems so false. Each of us has our own interpretation of Hollywood life, but I can safely assume that behind the glamour is a group of people playing one-upsmanship, trying to outdo the other and using any means to get there. Steven Phillips, played by Albert Brooks is a film writer. Now, Albert Brooks has always been the epitome of irony to me. His acting and comedic skills are so powerful that he has become a favorite of mine. Somehow Albert Brooks is able to convey and project the feelings of a film writer who is on the skids, but doesn't want to face the reality of a Hollywood that has no empathy. He has written 17 films and is comfortable with the company he works for. B ut, he is told by his boss that he has lost his 'edge'. Steven feels he is on the edge now and never lost his. After talking with his agent, Hal, played by Bradley Whitford, he is told that no studio wants him, they all feel he has lost the 'edge'. Steven goes looking for help, and ends up at the home of a fellow writer, Jack, played by Jeff Bridges. Jack reluctantly tells him he has hired a 'muse' to help him through the rough spots. At last Steven meets the Muse, Nicole, played by Sharon Stone and hires her. Sharon Stone steps out of her usual sexpot roles and plays a seemingly, intelligent woman who has wisdom to spare. That is not how this Muse works. Steven must pay handsomely, Muses do not come cheap! As time goes on, Steven's wife comes under Nicole's spell and she and Steven go to great lengths to keep their muse.

This is a light hearted romp through the business of film writing, and we get a look at how Howllywood works. It is not all talent, tricks and under pinnings all play a part in this world. Self confidence can be the name of the game, but we all need a boost every so often. This is not one of Albert Brook's best film, but it is a good one. So, is it better to hire a muse or be one?

Albert Brooks has been called a West Coast Woody Allen. He is not as funny nor as neurotic, but watching his schtick, you can't help but compare them. Born in Beverly Hills, his real name is Albert Lawrence Einstein. So, while some people might say 'I'm no Albert Einstein,' he can literally say 'I AM Albert Einstein.' His brother is Bob Einstein, AKA ""Super Dave"" Osbourne. His father, vaudeville/radio/film comedian Harry Parke, died of a heart attack when Albert was 11. At a Friar's roast for Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz he collapsed next to Milton Berle. While growing up, Debbie Reynolds was always trying to match make him with her daughter, Carrie Fisher.

I mention this biographical trivia to give you an idea of the man's show biz pedigree, and it pertains to The Muse becase it is a very inside Hollywood kind of a movie, and most if not all jokes are of the inside variety.

-------------------
Steven Phillips: [to the gate guard, after being informed that he may enter the studio grounds as a 'walk-on'] Let me ask you - is this the lowest a human being can go? I mean, is there such a thing as a 'crawl on?'
==========================

Says Brooks, ""I've always felt like I work in a small little area that doesn't represent anything like the rest of society."" So we get a parade of cameos with the likes of James F. Cameron, Lorenzo Lamas, Cybill Shepherd, Jennifer Tilly, Rob Reiner, and Martin Scorsese. Not that there's anything wrong with that--in fact the Scorsese cameo deserves an Oscar if they ever decide to recognize that category. And if they ever recognize a category for 'most savage skewering of a weasely junior executive producer' then Mark Feuerstein as Josh Martin is a shoe in. Feurerstein may have been the kiss of death to several sit coms, but here he really nails his part. Even Mark himself cites this as his personal favorite personal performance.

Though the film has many entertaining moments, the whole premise of The Muse falls flat towards the end, and like the writing of Steven Phillips, loses its edge.

1070776,2,6305717001,"The first half-hour is fine. Brooks is always at his best when his character is downtrodden or neurotic, and it's easy to sympathize with the screenwriter he plays here--one who's told repeatedly that he's ""lost his edge.""

But Brooks lets go of his character's misery too quickly ... and the movie never picks up steam from there. The rest of this story--his writer seeks inspiration from a high-maintenance muse played by Sharon Stone--fails to be in any way funny or revealing. It's simply dull, and we sit there waiting for director Brooks to recognize it, too, and turn this dog around.

The problem's pretty basic: Brooks's second and third acts have no pop. The summer-blockbuster idea the muse inspires needs to be funny. But it isn't. It sounds dreadful, and increasingly, the problems of Brooks the character become the problems of Brooks the director: how to put sizzle into an dry, workmanlike script perked up only by a spirited Stone. (Cameos from James Cameron and Martin Scorsese don't really help; they just highlight the barrenness of the terrain around them.)

Indeed, after that first half-hour, very little works here ... until the ending, which exhibits the flash of inspiration missing from the picture as a whole.",1174003200,3,1237,4.995145631067961

Brooks, Stone and MacDowell are simply brilliant just beautiful in their rolls. I also enjoyed seeing Jeff Bridges again whom I always remember for his superb roll in Starman. Brooks and Stone are just fantastic in the last 5 minutes of the finale. The finale does leave some unresolved questions in my mind but still it is a great movie. If Albert Brooks sets his mind to it, I'm sure he could come up with a sequel. I'll see this movie over and over and never get tired of it.

I saw this movie on television having never heard anything about it. When it was through I was left with the feeling that I had been robbed both of my time and of some hidden part of my soul. But I didn't worry much. After all, I've never really understood these quirky dark dramedies. Then I hear that this was supposed to be a straight-out comedy?!?!?! Somebody find me a joke in this thing. This is a film about a really depressed writer (Albert Brooks) who's career is over. Sharon Stone is supposedly a muse who Brooks hires to help him. Ironically she ends up helping everyone except Brooks and taking complete advantage of him. Yeah, real funny Brooks, let's see how long you can make that one gimmick work. The only thing keeping us from hating Stone is that she's a magical being and therefore must know what's best. At the end it turns out that maybe she was just an escaped mental patient. We're not really sure. So the audience is left with this horrible taste in their mouths rather than any shred of laughter that the filmmakers might have been hoping for. In short, the entire affair is an abysmal waste of celluloid to be avoided by anyone who values their time...and SOUL!

The problem is that its low-key shaggy-dog story has plenty of flat stretches, and its reliance on basically one in-joke premise fizzles out much too quickly.

It's the sort of Hollywood-punches-Hollywood theme you've seen many times before and several times better, like with The Player. Even the continuous stream of cameos from celebrities becomes tiresome after a while.

What the movie needed, ironically, is some inspiration. It may be a decent rental to pass a particularly sluggish afternoon, nothing more.",1105747200,4,858,5.584615384615384

At the suggestion of a friend, he seeks to engage the services of a muse, Sarah - Sharon - who demands gifts, living quarters and perpetual adoration.  The initial benefit is questionable as Brooks struggles to realize any positive ideas from Sarah while his wife - Andie MacDowell - comes up with a hundred thoughts regarding the relationship between him and his erstwhile source of inspiration.
It's Andie that strikes gold first through the presence of Sarah, leading to comic angst from her husband - and perhaps no one has as much angst as Albert Brooks.  Cameo appearances by a number of Hollywood characters playing themselves help to keep your interest through whatever slow spots might bog things down at times.

The preformaces by the actors, especially Albert Brooks, are prefectly delivered in this material. In addition, I could not stop laughing at some of the brilliant comedy. It's much better then the gross-out sex gags seen everywhere in cinema today.

Others have already synopsized the film, so I'll just say: try watching it and thinking of the Muse (Sharon Stone) as, literally, an artist's creativity.  What happens? It makes extravagant demands at inopportune times.  It wakes you up at three in the morning because that's when it feels like working.  It wants what it wants and doesn't care about your pocketbook, your relationship or your convenience.  It gets [ticked] off and leaves if you undervalue it or start doubting it.  You worry that others' creativity and success might take away from yours.  Your female side (Andie McDowell) is maybe a little more comfortable with it (even thinking she will share a bed with it) then runs away when she sees what she's getting into (better to sleep on a cold, hard floor than to get too close to a real creative life).  The writer, told he has lost his ""edge"" gets into a situation where he's lost his job, can't sell his work--can't even get a meeting--and has to spend prodigiously to support this costly, demanding, maddening, beautiful thing.  Desperate, anxious, confused...he sure does get edgy by the end.  It's hilarious that the Muse keeps saying to him, ""are you writing this down?""  She makes him write, even if it's just her shopping list.  I enjoyed this film not just for the Hollywood satire, the clever lines and the sparkling performances, but also for its pointed, thought-provoking subtext.",1030320000,36,1550,4.807547169811321

no. It really doesn't. Is it still a pleasant and charming and humorous film?. Yes. It's just not up to Brooks' standards. In the movie, Brooks stars as Steven, a Hollywood screenwriter who can't seem to get a break, even after winning a prestigious film award. He has a nice home and a beautiful wife(played by Andie MacDowell), and some kids, but his career is floundering. It seems as if the studios aren't helping him much either. Then, his rich best friend(played by Jeff Bridges), lets Steven in on a little secret. He's been using a muse. Someone who inspires creativity in someone. At first, he's unwilling to share his muse with Steven, then gives in when he sees how desperate his buddy is. Steven meets Sarah(Sharon Stone), and it's not all great as he thought it would be. Sarah helps and gives, but expects things in return. Not just things, but nice things. She even moves in with the family!. I won't go into the ending and say what happens, but it is kind of a downer really. I wished it had ended some other way. The movie is light and airy and easily forgettable after a while, but it is smooth going down. Stone has never been more appealing here, even if she does get a little bossy here and there. Brooks is his usual reliable self. The film also has cameos by James Cameron, Martin Scorsesse, Wolfgang Puck, Rob Reiner, and Jennifer Tilly. The scene where Brooks is talking with a foreign man in a restaraunt and he doesn't understand what he is saying is priceless. I laughed hard at that one.

1070875,3,6305717001,"`The Muse' may not be the best comedy ever, but, let's face it, this is a funny, charming and entertaining movie. Moreover, sometimes its critics to Hollywood system can be very pertinent.
Albert Brooks writes, directs, produces and stars this comedy about a Hollywood writer who -- as everybody says-- has lost his Edge. Advised by a friend who is very succesfull in the business, he meets The Muse, played by Sharon Stone. But far different from the simple Greek entities, she likes expensive clothes and hotels, she has many extravagant desires and charges for her inspiration. Undoubtly her attitudes and advices will change not only the writer's life but also his wife's.
Don't expect something dark or mindy; this is a very light film. But this is very most of its charm lies. And, in Sharon Stone. She hasn't been as beautiful as in this movie for many years. She is the heart and soul of the story. She was born to play this character; there would never be a muse as amusing as she. And to make things better, she has a good timing for comedies. She uses all her sex symbol status to make her character sensual without being vulgar.
The other players are fine. Jeff Bridges is particularly funny as Brooks's friend. Many industry insders, as Martin Scorsese and Rob Reiner,  also pop up in some scenes, playing some of the muse's protgs. Andie MacDowell is not bad but she has been better before, but her character allows her some transformation. Albert Brooks is a good comediant and he deliviries fine here.
Brooks's  script sounds very resenteful with the big studios and their system. But his critics to them is as not acid as they could be. Actually, they taste much like an piece of cake that went off than bile as they actually should be to make this a much better movie-- but they are critcs anyway. Some of them are too clichd, for one, the studio executive who turns to be Satan itself.
I suggest you to take a look at this muse. You may find some good ideas here and there. Brooks himself may actually have been helped by a muse during the procution of this film -- but not all the time.",1015200000,,2106,4.5394736842105265

1070877,5,6305717001,"I will admit my bias right up front: If I had to make a list of reasons I'm glad I'm alive, comedian-writer-director Albert Brooks would surely be in my top ten.
But though Brooks has been directing his own movie comedies for 20 years, he remains a cult comedian whose humor often seems a little too inside. And Brooks's THE MUSE is unlikely to change his track record. But if you're burned out by in-your-face comedies, I strongly encourage you to see this. It's gratifyingly intelligent and superbly hilarious to boot.
Brooks plays Steven Phillips, a Hollywood screenwriter who, as the movie opens, is being presented with a humanitarian award. (When one of his daughters asks what a humanitarian is, he replies, ""It's a man who never won an Oscar."") The award is the last good thing to happen to Steven for a while.
Trying to peddle his latest script, he is told by many disparate parties that he has ""lost his edge."" The movie's first half-hour milks huge laughs from Steven's desperate attempts at script-hustling, as he moves further and further down the Hollywood food chain.
Then Steven happens upon Jack Warrick (Jeff Bridges), an old Hollywood friend whose career is on a dramatic upswing. Jack reluctantly shares his secret with Steven. He has a muse--not an imagined source of inspiration, but a real live goddess who gives him the help he needs. Jack arranges a meeting between Sarah the muse (played to the hilt by Sharon Stone) and Steven.
THE MUSE, like the best modern-day comedies, is almost anti-high concept. Trying to explain its appeal usually bungles it for anyone who isn't in on the laugh. Brooks is simply one of the great comedians--for my money, right up there with Chaplin and all the other comedy icons you just have to trust will give you a good time. He's also a subtle, underrated director who gets huge laughs from the simplest camera set-ups. (Witness Steven's trek through a movie lot as he attempts to meet Steven Spielberg.)
Brooks must have had his own muse to get such an inspired performance from Sharon Stone, whose appeal has been lost on me until now. She usually comes off as self-obsessed. But here, that can only be an advantage. Stone's best moments are Sarah's slack-jawed reactions to Steven's cost-cutting attempts to get her services for less. What's money to a muse like her, anyway?
Even the ending, which is usually the weakest part of Brooks's movies, manages to wrap things up beautifully here. If Brooks really has a muse, I hope he'll lend her out to every comedy maker in Hollywood, fast.
One final point in the movie's favor: Elton John's lush score, one of the best of 1999.
THE MUSE is rated PG-13 for adult language and situations, and brief nudity.",992649600,,2713,4.762208067940552

I think this film is right on with Brook's unique and enjoyable way of telling a story.  The only reason this got 4 instead of 5 stars is the very ending of the movie.  I won't say what it is here so as not to spoil it (because it was good), but it was just not the ending I was expecting...not as clever as I thought it would be.
This way a very good movie, an enjoyable journey.",985392000,,538,4.095238095238095
1070879,5,6305717001,"Summary: Albert Brooks' genius shines again.
Albert Brooks again shows why he's the best director and writer in America. Like Defending Your Life and Mother, The Muse is packed with insight, heart and originality. A Hollywood writer who (the suits claim) has lost his Edge, turns in desperation to a professional ""muse."" Sharon Stone plays this role just right - deliciously flaky, but heartrending, too, for her ability to activate others' potential, but inability to realize her own (how many of us play this role, believing our role is to encourage and inspire others, but never jump-starting our own dreams -- I never thought about this until I saw the movie). Albert Brooks and Andy MacDowell are also wonderful. Their bumpy search for the meaning of success is poignant, inspiring and, in true Brooks fashion, hilarious. Albert Brooks has most decidedly not lost his edge. I can't wait for his next one.",974764800,,909,4.9868421052631575
1070880,2,6305717001,"Albert Brooks has directed, stars in and written the so-so screenplay for The Muse.  Refreshingly, not many movies that trump the cliches and stereotypes of modern day Hollywood go at it from the perspective of the screenwriter specifically.  It seems many times, we get a peek at the Hollywood fishbowl through the eyes of an actor, director or producer (Bowfinger).  The screenwriter is a somewhat forgotten character in the movie-making mix.  But, at least screenwriters still get to accept their Oscars during the televised portion of the ceremonies, unlike all those other poor schmucks who get relegated to the 15-second ""Awards Given Earlier"" segment.
 The Muse introduces us to Steven Phillips, a screenwriter who is riding the high of receiving a Humanitarian award.  However, when his daughter asks what a humanitarian is, Steven (Albert Brooks) humbly replies, ""A humanitarian is someone who's never won an Oscar.""  Brooks is masterful at seeing the cloud for the silver lining.
 Steven's life takes a turn when, during a meeting about his latest screenplay, he is not so delicately told he's lost his edge and released from his studio contract.  Young studio whipper-snapper Josh condescendingly prompts Steven to start his second career in life, stating that people usually have three careers in their lifetimes.  Annoyed and somewhat lost, Steven tries vainly to figure out what his next step should be.
 One funny sequence is his trying to get a meeting with Stephen Spielberg.  The Spielberg headquarters almost mimic a David-Koresh-Branch-Davidian- compound feel, a veritable fortress that begs a level of respect.  Once inside, whether you are allowed to drive in or if you are diminished to ""walk-on"" status, your chances of actually meeting Spielberg are virtually non-existent.  Monotone actor/comic Steven Wright has a small role as cousin Stan Spielberg.
 Finally, desperate and wondering how he will feed his family, Steven approaches his friend Jack (Jeff Bridges), hoping for a break.  Jack shares the secret of his many successes.  He is using a muse, yes, a muse, one of the nine daughters of Zeus, inspirational patronesses of the various arts.  Steven is desperate to try anything once at this point, and gets a meeting with Sarah, the muse (Sharon Stone).
 Sarah agrees to take him on, after explaining many of her conditions, not the least of which is staying at the Four Seasons to the tune of $1700 a night.  Not only that, but he must pay for her groceries, her transportation and be at her beck and call at all hours since she might have some inspiration in the middle of the night.  She does not give any ideas or do any of the writing, she merely is present for inspiration.
 Stone turns in an amusing, cute performance as Sarah that might mimic many of the qualities of your favorite high-maintenance friend.  She is very particular, expects gifts from Tiffany's, and wants Waldorf salads from Spago in the middle of the night.  Her insistence that things be exactly right is evident in her constant reminder to Steven, ""Are you writing all this down?""
 She eventually moves into the Phillips home, and befriends Steven's wife Laura (Andie MacDowell), inspiring her to start a venture of her own.  Steven is most displeased with the mayhem that ensues, and feels slighted, wondering if Sarah's ""museness"" is being sucked dry by his wife as well as other Hollywood types James Cameron, Martin Scorsese and Rob Reiner who keep popping up everywhere.
 Martin Scorsese is the funniest part of the film, all hopped up on Starbucks coffee, and contemplating a remake of Raging Bull, except this time, with a really really thin, angry guy.  Oh man, it's a knee-slapper.
 There's a plot twist at the end of the film, which I didn't expect, but also didn't like.  I would have liked the follow-through to be more consistent.  It's a cute movie and interesting premise.  People generally don't mind being entertained with unrealistic possibilities.  Albert Brooks is very talented and I've liked his work in the past.  This is certainly not his strongest contribution, so I would recommend Defending Your Life he did with Meryl Streep, an interesting take on what might happen in the afterlife.
The Muse is ho-hum at best, Sharon Stone is charming and Albert Brooks is his usual deadpan, frustrated, well-spoken self.  The cameos are fun, you can watch for appearances from Cybill Shepperd, Lorenzo Lamas, Jennifer Tilly and Wolfgang Puck as well as the aforementioned slew of directors.",971222400,,4516,5.032301480484522
1070881,3,6305717001,"I wish I could give this film 3 1/2 stars. It's not the greatest film ever made, but the fun little jabs at Hollywood's psychological underbelly are darn cute. Having once worked at Paramount, I recognized some of the types if not the actual characters (although I swear that Josh's ""office"" was not in the Lucille Ball building but probably in Paramount's main building).
Sarah Little (the ""Muse,"" played by Stone) might represent anyone in a position of confidential, advisory power in the ""Hollywood"" community.  Her advantage-taking, meddling and boundary-crossings could characterize an agent, psychologist or ""psychic"" whose client/patient list overlaps incestuously -- someone who gains some personal psychological ephemera by ""serving the stars"" who are, of course, eternally grateful.
In real life, the ""Muse"" would end up a defendant in a malpractice suit.  My goodness, we even find her taking over the marital bed, eventually using the couple's ""best sheets"" to fairy-tale her escape!
The film is worth watching just to see Sharon Stone in Emanuel Ungaro, and Andie MacDowell is stunning in a wonderful black dress in one of the above mentioned ""marital bed"" scenes.  Did Ungaro also do Andie's dress?

Charicters deliver truly  unbeleiavable lines, with no emotion, over and over - The only good thing  about this movie is that it's over quickly. This movie isn't even the type  of bad movie that one can enjoy watching with friends and making fun  of..

1070956,4,6305717001,"I enjoyed this film, but I must say right away that it is not funny as in ""huh-huh, what a good line/a great joke...huh-huh"". It is nice, pleasant, at times witty, but not overly funny. The best part of this film  is the ending, which I could not have predicted in millions  years...
Basically, this film is about one Hollywood writer, who is on  the verge of mid-life crisis and writer's block, which is the result of the  mid-life crisis.
Watch this film, even if you could care less about  Hollywood writers and their problems. If for nothing else, watch this film  to see Sharon Stone being stunningly gorgeous [as always], while constantly  changing her amazing wardrobe!",960422400,,676,4.726495726495727
1070957,1,6305717001,"What's most ironic about _The Muse_ is the fact that the plight befalling its main character is equally troubling Albert Brooks himself.  Like his fictional counterpart, Brooks has entered a creative dry spell with _The  Muse_, offering up neither writing nor acting that particularly  satisfies.
Though the film's concept-that traditional Greek muses walk  among us and *must* be put up in a suite at the Four Seasons-has the  initial appeal of novelty about it, the ending negates all the promise of  the setup.  Instead of taking the setup to an interesting conclusion,  Brooks creates an air of unreality and  then walks away from it.  Better  endings have been written for Christmas episodes of sitcoms.
As if  anticipating the dismal ending, most of the actors fumble their way  passionlessly through their lines-including, oddly, Brooks himself.  He  could've surely used an objective eye to help direct him in his own  scenes--he's largely more grating than welcome.  As his wife, Andie  MacDowell is absolutely miscast, as unable to show the emotions her lines  call for as she is to find an accent and stick with it.  Of the three  principals, the only actor to turn in an enjoyable performance is Stone,  who is perfect for the role.  Unfortunately, the role itself is far from  perfect, and never gives Stone much to work with.
Likewise, the Hollywood  commentary might've been fresh at one time, but here it seems pale and  imitative. There are scenes which are almost entirely evocative of _The  Player_, not just in substance, but in visual composition.  The restaurant  scene, in particular, could've been lifted directly from that much better  film.  And _Bowfinger_ delvers better, less whiny laughs about the movie  making process itself.
In sum, this film is a negligible achievement  that will leave all but the most diehard Albert Brooks fan unhappy--if not  downright angry--that they bothered.
(DVD notes: The extra features here  are minimal.  There's no additional audio commentary of any kind and the  behind-the-scenes featurette is short.  The DVD isn't significantly  better, therefore, than the VHS, unless you just really want the  convenience of chapter search.)",959644800,4,2195,5.177650429799427
1070958,4,6305717001,"Hollywood takes a hit in ""The Muse,"" a subtle comedy from co-writer, director and star Albert Brooks.  One week after screenwriter Steven Phillips (Brooks) receives a Humanitarian Award for Lifetime Achievement,  he is fired from a three picture deal at Paramount because there are those  who feel that he is ""losing his edge.""  His agent, Hal (Bradley Whitford),  tells him to take a year off, get his edge back.  With a wife and two  daughters, however, Steven proclaims this to be an unviable option,  whereupon he falls into a funk with no idea of what to do next.  His wife,  Laura (Andie MacDowell) urges him to consult with his best friend and  fellow screenwriter, Jack Warrick (Jeff Bridges), who has been on a roll  for the past couple of years, including one in which he won an Oscar.  After some coaxing, Steven gets Jack to let him in on the secret of his  success, and it turns out that he has a muse (a ""real"" muse), and her name  is Sarah Liddle (Sharon Stone).  Incredulous, initially, Steven is finally  convinced, and Jack sets up a meeting for him with Sarah.  She agrees to  take him on, and he quickly learns that there are rules and obligations  that go along with having a muse, which include a suite at the Four  Seasons, being on call whenever she feels ""inspired,"" as well as getting  her dry cleaning done and shopping for her.  All at his expense, of course  (""Consider it an investment"").  And then there's the little matter of  explaining it all to Laura (""Muses exist!  They live amongst us!"" he tells  her).  She responds as expected, but then Brooks cleverly takes the story  in another direction.  Laura and Sarah have lunch together, bond, and soon  Steven is sharing his muse with his wife.  Brooks fine-tunes and  finesses the humor throughout the film, taking Steven through his paces as  he tries to balance out his obligations to Sarah and Laura with the time he  needs to actually do some writing.  But the fact that Sarah is supposedly  the daughter of Zeus, and that it is taken for granted by all who believe  her to be a real muse, is really at the core of the humor in this movie.  Watching intelligent, successful people falling prey to such gullibility  enables us to laugh all the more at a situation that is already hilarious  on the surface.  Moreover, when you think about it and realize that there  are actually those in Hollywood (as well as anywhere, I suspect) who could,  in reality, be convinced that such a thing as a ""Muse"" actually exists, it  makes it all that much funnier still; yet if you extend that thought  further, it almost becomes scary.  Ultimately, Brooks and co-writer Monica  Johnson have turned out a movie that works extremely well on two levels,  with the satire on the surface perfectly complimented by all that's going  on underneath.  As usual, Brooks has assembled an excellent supporting  cast, including Mark Feuerstein (Josh Martin) and Steven Wright (Stan  Spielberg), as well as sprinkling effective cameos by Rob Reiner, James  Cameron, Lorenzo Lamas, and Jennifer Tilly (all of whom play themselves),  throughout; and there's an especially humorous bit by Martin Scorsese (also  playing himself).  The triumph of ""The Muse"" is that it is thought  provoking as well as laugh provoking; you'll laugh, think about it for  awhile, and when it really hits you, you'll probably be smiling and  chuckling for the rest of the day.",958348800,2,3412,4.739726027397261
1070959,3,6305717001,"Every few years Albert Brooks declares himself God and creates a little universe in his own image and likeness in the form of a film he writes, directs and in which he stars. ""The Muse"", his latest creation is  a harmless jab at the Hollywood filmmaking industry. The story is not  particularly new or fresh, but it is effective satire in Brooks' inimitable  sardonic style. The comedy mostly works, but sometimes falls flat with  excess as Brooks can't seem to judge when a gag becomes too much of a good  thing.
Brooks plays Steven Phillips, a veteran writer who has ""lost  his edge"". At least that is what he is being told by everyone else.  Upon relating his frustrations to his best friend Jack (Jeff Bridges), Jack  confides in him that his career was saved by a muse and promptly offers to  set up a meeting with her and Steven. Enter Sarah Liddle (Sharon Stone),  muse extraordinaire, who in return for her inspiration requires lavish and  continual attention and has an insatiable appetite for luxuries.
Steven  becomes her shameless lackey as does his wife (Andie MacDowell) in hopes  that she can bring both of them fame and fortune. Ultimately they discover  that she is not actually a muse, but something else entirely.
As always,  Brooks casts himself in the puling nebbish role, full of self deprecation  and sarcastic pokes at everyone and everything. The movie makes the  satirical point that everyone in Hollywood is looking for an edge and will  do just about anything to get it. In typical Albert Brooks style, comedy is  used to make an introspective point. If one looks deeper, the philosophical  point is that ""the edge"" is a perceptual concept. If one is  affected by the industry's negative opinion of one's work, the loss of  confidence will cause him to lose his edge. This is obvious by the fact  that the muse had no real powers, yet she helped every person she met. The  only thing that changed was each individual's belief in the talent they had  lost faith in.
The story meanders from scene to scene with no real flow  and shamelessly throws in dozens of cameos of all Brooks' Hollywood  friends. From a directorial perspective, this film show why it is not a  good idea for a writer to direct his own material. He is too close to it  and can't see the little flaws that make the movie choppy.
The acting was  mixed. I'm convinced that Albert Brooks is not really acting when he stars  in movies he writes. He is just being Albert Brooks, saying the words he  would say if he were in this fantasy situation of his own creation. While  his whimpering style can be funny in minor roles as a foil to some other  character, a full feature dominated by his whining gets more than a little  tedious.
Andie MacDowell never ceases to be fresh in the nice girl role.  She just beams with enthusiasm and vitality as Steven's wife who, inspired  by the muse, turns her love of baking into a Hollywood cookie  empire.
Sharon Stone dominates and energizes the story in her role as the  muse. This is the type of role she plays best, the ultimate femme fatale, a  siren of fantasy and desire. She exudes feminine superiority and gets her  way through guile and manipulation. No one can resist her magic and she  makes slaves of them all.
I gave this movie a 7/10. All in all, it was  entertaining, with some funny gags and plenty of Albert Brooks ironic  jaundice for life. If you can't get enough of Albert Brooks, you will want  to see this movie.",955929600,,3467,4.574918566775244
