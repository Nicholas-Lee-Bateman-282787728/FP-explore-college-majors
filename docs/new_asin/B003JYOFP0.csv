4131509,5,B003JYOFP0,This was a present for my young grandson. He loves it and we sing when we watch it. The price was great and the condition of the item was excellent. A good choice!,1370476800,,163,3.9696969696969697
4131510,5,B003JYOFP0,Awesome educational DVD! ASL storytelling is very authentic. Deaf adult signers are natural ASL language models to young deaf and hard of hearing children. I believe that the DVD should be used in every American Sign Language and English bilingual and bicultural classroom in schools in the United States.,1361404800,,305,5.244897959183674
4131511,5,B003JYOFP0,"I was pleased to see the signing was going along with the pages in the book. I didn't know what to expect it would be like but quite pleased with the format. They zoom into a page in the book, added a small bit of animation to the page & then the signer is super-imposed onto the screen. The book is being narrated at the same time. My 25 year old niece with Downs Syndrome loved it! We both loved Manny Rodriguez (one of the signers)! There are other stories within this DVD as well. We bought several other DVD's & enjoy all of them.",1358553600,,535,4.104761904761904
4131512,2,B003JYOFP0,"We own many of the Scholastic Video series DVDs and really enjoy them. This one is geared toward hearing impaired children or someone learning sign language. While I think this is great for hearing impaired children who can not yet read, if you are thinking you'd like to add to your library with a few more stories you don't have yet, you might reconsider this one. The people doing the sign language are right in the middle of the screen in front of the pictures and are quite distracting from the story. We love these stories and were disappointed that it was not very enjoyable to watch in this format.  Too bad they don't make another series with all of these done for hearing impaired children and another done the original way. The product has a sign language icon but on the cover but be warned it isn't an option to toggle off and it's very intrusive to the story being told.",1351468800,3,884,4.45679012345679
4131513,5,B003JYOFP0,"I have a (now 5) year old daughter with special needs. She has full mental capacity and understands what the narrator is saying, as well as enjoys the very vibrant way the story is told with signing. As she has trouble talking, she also ""talks"" with her hands too and although she cannot follow along with the adults, this is not meant to teach a child to sign the story. It is meant to Tell the story via sign language, which it does very well.

I am confused by other reviews giving one star. In the description it very clearly says ""illustrations"" or drawings. It does not say it is a cartoon at all. People need to learn to read. If you are looking for a learning sign language DVD invest in the Signing Time series, those are wonderful for teaching the entire family signs.

These stories are fun, basic, engaging and not too long. They are bound to hold your child's attention unless your child is ""beyond"" being read basic stories (eyeroll).

Highly recommended here!",1343174400,3,974,4.5227272727272725
4131514,1,B003JYOFP0,"Don't even buy this unless it is for a impaired child.  I did not read the reviews first, and now I think I am stuck with it, as I can't find anywhere the instructions on returns!",1339977600,,179,3.9722222222222223
4131515,1,B003JYOFP0,"Unless you have a child who is learning extreme sign language, do not buy this movie!! what a waste of money its not even a real cartoon its just pictures from the book and people standing there doing sign language blocking the picture. my daughter was so disappointed and got bored very fast....",1321401600,,296,4.60377358490566
4131516,1,B003JYOFP0,"The story was a ""cartoon"" with a narrator and a person ""signing"" for those with hearing difficulties.  Both detracted from the story and seemed to overpower it.

4131517,5,B003JYOFP0,"The stories really come to life on this DVD! The ASL signers are just so excellent and the animation, voice over, and on-screen display of the words are all fabulously done and work really well together. This is no ""baby signing"" either. These stories are told in fluent ASL by native speakers. In that respect, this DVD is a great resource for families that speak ASL in the home for whatever reason. Out of all the ASL materials I've seen for kids, this is the BEST. This DVD is exactly what we have wanted for our family for almost three years now, since we found out our son is deaf and decided to raise him bilingually. The only complaint I have is: there aren't enough stories or DVDs in the series. More please!!!",1296777600,5,720,4.421052631578948
4131518,5,B003JYOFP0,"Has it really been 11 years since Chlo came home from preschool reciting ""Five Little Monkeys Jumping on the Bed""? I'd never heard it before and, of course, I was absolutely charmed with her rendition. I immediately got her the board book.

When Scholastic Storybook Treasures announced that FIVE LITTLE MONKEYS JUMPING ON THE BED would be released on August 24, I was thrilled. This delightful rhyme is accompanied by Manny Hernandez translating it into American Sign Language. Eileen Christelow's original illustrations are shown, and Ryland Hale provides the voice narration. The story has captions for early readers; the captions can be turned off for non-readers and those who just want to watch. Turning the sound off and the captions on provides a nice ASL lesson. The limited animation brings life to the five little monkeys and their mama, and Hernandez's signing is spirited and cheerful. I'd gladly join any children who want to watch this video again and again.

The second story, ""Little Quack"" (written by Laura Thompson, illustrated by Derek Anderson), features another mama with five babies, this time a duck and her ducklings. This time Mama wants jumping--she is encouraging her five scared babies to jump into the pond and swim. The ducklings snuggle up in the nest afraid, but one by one they join Mama in the pond. Missy Keast does the signing for ""Little Quack"" and her animated facial expressions and body language complement her ASL interpretation. Allison Karman narrates. Keast and Karman inject a little bit of suspense into the tale--will Little Quack swim?

""There's Something In My Attic,"" written and illustrated by Mercer Mayer, is the final story on Five Little Monkeys Jumping on the Bed. Keast and Kaplan again provide the storytelling. A little girl and her family move from the city to a farm; the child is scared by night sounds coming from the attic. ""It's probably mice,"" say Mom and Dad. The girl puts on her cowboy boots and hat, grabs a lasso, and proceeds to the attic to catch the nightmare and show her parents. In the attic there is a pile of toys the girl thought were missing and she realizes she has uncovered a mystery. Suddenly there are footsteps on the stairs...is it the nightmare? Yes! I won't tell you what happens next, you'll have to see the video.

Bright, breezy original music by Randy Hale provides the soundtrack for all three stories, emphasizing their tone. DVD extras include vocabulary for each story and ASL demonstration of the signs for many of the nouns and verbs. There are also mini-quizzes that test comprehension, and a presentation of the American Sign Language alphabet.

Bottom Line: Would I buy FIVE LITTLE MONKEYS JUMPING ON THE BED? Yes--the stories are fun and I am particularly in favor of children learning sign language. It's the one language that can be communicated concurrently with their native language--that's pretty cool!
