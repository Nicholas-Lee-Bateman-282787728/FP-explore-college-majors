8237301,5,B001072DGG,"This DVD contains 20 workouts.  Each workout is approximately 20 minutes long and focuses on one area of the body.  There's a warm-up to each workout.  I love this DVD.  It is a no-frills, let's-get-it-done series of workouts.  There are no complicated moves that require so much thought that I end up frustrated because the instructor is moving at such a fast pace.  If you're looking for a good old-fashioned workout that gets the job done, then this is the DVD for you.",1339632000,3,472,4.626506024096385
8237302,3,B001072DGG,"This video is divided into different sections such as arms, legs, abs, and low impact cardio. Each section has a warm-up (low impact cardio type warm up) then the segment focusing on a specific area. The workouts are old school (fun late 80s outfits!) and are from Janis' show. The quality is not great. It looks like you are watching a VHS copy of the show taped from TV. However, the workouts are good. They are challenging for a beginner, but not so difficult that you can't do them. They will definitely help you work up a sweat! Janis is a good instructor who cues well. My main complaint is that I was hoping for more of her cardio workouts on this DVD, but there are only 2. The video menu says there are 3, but one of them is really a chair workout, which I don't consider to be cardio. For what this video is, I'd say the current $13.49 price is a bit high. This would have been an excellent find if it had been $5. I really wish I could give this 3.5 stars, but I had to settle for 3.",1243555200,10,994,4.128865979381444
