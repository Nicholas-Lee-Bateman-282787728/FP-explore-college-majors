8011054,5,B0001E5UBE,"I really enjoyed all four series of ""Ultimate Force"".  It is the forerunner of the ""Strike Back"" series, both the British and American series. I personally feel like series 3 and series 4 don't need to be viewed after series 1 and 2. Personally, I think series 1 and 2 are self contained and so is series 3 and 4.  Series 3 starts with the introduction of a female trooper into SAS; however, the series doesn't really address women's issues.  Instead they chose to treat the female as if she is just one of the troopers, with a couple of exceptions.  There are a couple of times that she is chosen for specific tasks since they feel that the terrorists would not be expecting a female SAS person. Also, since she uses the same shower at the same time as the men, there is the inevitable nude shower scene. In fact they address race issues as much or more than women's issues. A black trooper named Dave is twice confronted by other people with racially discriminatory feeling: one a South African and one an American.

In general, the action in the series is unbelievably good.  In many instances it goes on continually for a long time.  They must have spent quite a bit of money on blanks, etc, so intense was the action. Of course much if not all of the dialog is intended to duplicate the dialog of a military organization.  There is little, but some, ""soul searching"" or exploration of motives: mostly in series 4.  Also, for me the intense action made the series a little different from most other action series that I have watched. This is because the action scenes are fairly continuous. Most action series seem to have breaks within the action sequences.  Most of the action sequences in this series had almost continuous gun fire for a very long time.  They reminded me of the continuous action of the Omaha Beach landing scenes in ""Saving Private Ryan"" or the holding of the bridge, in the same movie, even though the series is not like the movie.  So if you like a lot of good quality action I think you might want to view this series. However, you should be warned that by the end of series 4 you might be convinced that women should fight along side men, without women's issues every really being addressed, in the series.",1365379200,,2235,4.5049504950495045
