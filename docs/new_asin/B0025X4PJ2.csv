8351352,2,B0025X4PJ2,"Why the manufacturers don`t put more effort into recording old movies is a shame. These have very poor picture quality. They use the excuse of age as a disclaimer but a major studio will release the same film with excellent picture quality. ""Whistle Stop"" is a prime example. In the age of high definition why can`t they do a better job?  Picture quality can differ from label to label.  Sometimes I have to purchase three copies of the same movie to find one with a decent picture. Of course they are budget, but wouldn`t it be just as easy and cost effective to do it right the first time?",1263254400,5,591,4.412844036697248
