532687,3,6302990025,This movie was o.k. I gave 3 stars because it was just o.k. But in this movie the preacher Gaberil was more of hypocrite than anyone. And I believe they were playing with the Holyghost. He is not to be played with.,1314662400,,214,4.119047619047619
532688,3,6302990025,"This film provides a rare opportunity for you to get a peek into the life of suthor, James Baldwin.  If you are not an ardent reader, you will know little of this wonderful writer.  I only wish that there will be a biography on film of this man.  Until that comes along, this is the only film that I have seen that gives you an inside of his life.",1131494400,8,347,4.0
532689,5,6302990025,"John Grimes is a sensitive young teenager who bears the daily criticism of his step-father. As he endures the redicule, resentment and anger of this man, John tries to understand himself and the world he is to inherit.
  Go Tell It On The Mountain takes us on the journey of southern Black men and women as they attempt to survive in their rural south and run away to the urban north. While up  ""north"", you witness their escapism into sanctified religion, the pull of the streets on their children, the secrets in their hearts and the bitterness of unfulfilled dreams.
  Told from the perspective of John, the viewer sees a cultural change and transition in the lives of these new residents of urban America. Join in the pulsating rhythms of the sanctified store-front churches. Feel the needs of young people who want to be free but are held in bondage by the fundamentalist mindsets of their elders. What is most intriguing about the film is Gabriel, John's step-father. His life, loss, bitterness and inability to fully accept John shows what happens to a man who has no anchor.
  An outstanding cast of actors portray the characters in this great film. Even though this is an adaption of James Baldwin's work of the same name it doesn't follow the book in its entirety. We get a deeper sense of the psychological forces that shaped John's parents and their world than from the book. In fact this film enhances the book and I highly recommend its viewing.",1001894400,50,1459,4.698039215686275

532887,5,6302990025,"This has to be one of the best American Playhouse productions.  The acting and direction are top-notch and introduces us to Giancarlo Esposito and Kadeem Hardison.  What I liked most about the movie, though, is the down-to-earth, realistic portrayal of the church scenes, especially the musical renditions.  I felt as though I was truly at that particular kind of church service.  So many times in other movies where church settings are depicted with choir and congregational singing  featured, the natural aura and gravity of the situation are hijacked by heavy-handed dramatics that blatantly reduces the scene to an almost obscene caricature of itself.  But in this endeavor those scenes remain true to the tone and flow that the action has already established.",1447286400,3,764,5.221311475409836

532964,5,6302990025,"having read the JAMES BALDWIN book, knowing the talents of STAN LATHAN I had to watch the movie of course. The late
PAUL WINFIELD from WHITE DOG fame is probably one of the greatest American actors and ALFRE is stunning, CCPOUNDER
and the rest of the cast is believable and moving.
The fate of a people struggling whether in AMERICA or elsewhere and whatever there creed or breed always moves me
and more so when it is filmed with so much heart like in this movie. Wonder if JIMMY BALDWIN liked his adaptation since
he was still alive when it was filmed.",1443139200,,554,4.4411764705882355

I'm glad today's dads can tell their sons they love them, but that was not so true back in the 1930s. It is also a good film regarding the brutality that Blacks faced. With racism on the rise today it helps to see how far we've come, but we still have a long way to go to full equality.",1395273600,2,407,4.1645569620253164
