3646468,5,B001I4BQ64,"This is a great way to get the juices flowing. It is mellow, in the sense that Janet keeps most of the work close to the ground, but I still get a lot of core strength and energy from it. I'm new to yoga and I can do most of the poses and movement, but it gives me a lot to work on.  I love the vinyasa sequence, taking you through fluid waves of  child's pose, gently diving into low cobra and back up and through again.  It somehow reminds me of agentle waves lapping the beach.
I also highly recommend Janet's other DVD, RADIANT FLOW.  Both DVDs are beautifully produced and Janet is a truly great teacher.",1224547200,16,609,4.135593220338983
3646469,5,B001I4BQ64,Janet Stone's Mellow Flow is the perfect tool for a home practice. It is a creative flow of opening and strengthening poses and every time I finish the practice I feel rejuvenated and fantastic. I strongly recommend trying this dvd--whether you are new to yoga or just looking for a another style. Janet's flow is unique and energetic.,1224201600,5,335,4.793103448275862
3646470,5,B001I4BQ64,"Being new to yoga, I was looking for a yoga DVD that was was challenging, but would not overwhelm me.  ""Mellow Flow Yoga with Janet Stone"" is that DVD.  This heart based, mellow practice gently stretches the body & brings awareness to the breath while helping to reduce stress and enhance energy. After concluding this practice I AM more fully  connected to my intuitive and creative self. Practicing Mellow Flow Yoga has been an amazing experience for me and has help to deepen my Spiritual practice.",1223942400,4,501,4.8023255813953485
3646484,5,B001I4BQ64,"I was a little unsure about buying this DVD because the practice is so short (about 50 minutes), but based on my past experiences with Janet Stone I couldn't let it pass.  I'm so glad I purchased it!  It's the perfect way to start your morning in a positive mood or to unwind after a long day.  Just like her other videos the practice is very unique and fun to do.  You begin with some pulses in bridge pose, which helps activate the thighs and core.  Then you spend some time in a squat to loosen up the hips.  My favorite part is the forward fold-squat-standing stretch sequence that follows this.  There is also a side stretch-forward fold vinyasa and enjoyable hip circles in down dog and one leg standing split.  The ""mellow vinyasa"" between sequences is lovely:  down dog to plank to child's to cobra back to down dog.  When the practice is over you feel peaceful and completely at ease, mentally and physically.",1330560000,7,918,4.509090909090909
3646485,5,B001I4BQ64,"As a yoga teacher and a devoted practitioner, I have been fortunate enough to practice with many amazing teachers from all around the world. Similarly, over the years I have watched literally every single yoga DVD I could get my hands on, always looking for the same three qualities I look for in a teacher: passion, innovation, and artistry. No one embodies these qualities quite like Janet Stone.

Janet Stone is a wonder; truly one of the most radiant and inspiring teachers I have ever known. Passion? She has it and then some. Her love for yoga, and the joy that sharing the practice bring her is self-evident. Innovation? Absolutely. Janet's sequences are some of the most innovative and exciting I have ever experienced. Artistry? No question. Just watching Janet flow from pose to pose is revelatory. Join her and you begin to create art yourself in collaboration with her golden voice and superb soundtrack.

This DVD exudes all of these qualities before you even press play, as the production quality of the packaging and disc pressing is first class in every respect. Everything you experience once the video is rolling is similarly phenomenal, from the menus to the soundtrack to the words of wisdom and meditation that permeate the practice. A bargain at any price. You deserve this practice.",1316563200,5,1305,4.927272727272728
3646486,5,B001I4BQ64,"I tried both this DVD and Stone's other DVD (Radiant Flow), both are excellent.  This yoga session is easier and shorter than radiant flow, but not necessarily easy.  Mellow Flow is actually about 50-55 minutes versus the 60 minutes on the box, but that's not altogether a bad thing.  Stone throws enough intermediate stuff in this DVD to keep it interesting for most beginners.  I have practiced yoga on and off for 9 years so this was not too bad from a difficulty standpoint, but still kept my interest.  This DVD is great for a beginner with experience or an intermediate/advance yogi/yogini looking to not push themselves too hard.  If you want to be pushed try Radiant Flow it is intermediate to advanced.  I honestly would consider it more advanced than intermediate.  Buy both DVDs you cannot go wrong.",1269302400,4,810,4.776978417266187
3646487,5,B001I4BQ64,"I recently bought both of Janet's DVDs. I tried this one first. It was so lovely and heartfelt, opening me up so sweetly in the hips, the shoulders, the heart. I didn't want it to end.
It's so clear to me Janet's a mommy. After doing a long flow on the right side, she says, ""Now we have to be fair,"" to transition you to the same flow on the left. Her connection with Spirit is so obvious and so generously shared. I finished with my own Shavasana and had a hard time getting back up off the mat! I was so open and mellow, peaceful and happy.
I usually do a longer practice (this one is only 50 minutes), but this really hit the spot for when I want to do a combination of things for my morning movement and ""me"" time, or for when I have less time.
If everyone did Janet Stone yoga, there'd be peace on Earth in no time!",1247270400,7,821,4.012195121951219
3646488,5,B001I4BQ64,"i'm an absolute beginner when it comes to yoga.  This dvd is def too fast for me, but i will def keep in my collection for when i have progressed to the next level.  from the very first moment of watching this dvd i can tell it was different.  Janet is very spiritual in her teaching which is what yoga is.  not just a form of exercise but a way to yoke the body with the spirit and heart.  if you are a beginner to yoga look for something more mellow but def keep this dvd in mind for later use...it is beautiful!!",1243814400,3,515,3.9611650485436893
3646489,5,B001I4BQ64,Definitely more mellow than Radiant Flow! I would recommend it for beginners (like one year of experience). Janet is so awesome.,1237248000,2,128,5.142857142857143
3646490,5,B001I4BQ64,This yoga DVD is refreshing and inspirational.  I have many yoga DVD's and this one captures the sprit of being at a yoga studio with a experienced teacher.  Janet is wonderful and authentic.  Her practice is flowing and beautiful.  It is nice to have a DVD that is beginner friendly but challenging and interesting for an experienced practitioner.  Enjoy!,1236643200,,356,4.966101694915254
3646491,5,B001I4BQ64,"When you can't make Janet's class in person, this is the next best thing. I love doing the mellow flow in the afternoon!
The Dvd is straightforward, and instrctional, but I am finding that a whole new level of practice emerges when I do yoga alone. I am really able to concentrate, and spend time in my body. I think this is a great practice for all levels, and fits nicely into an afternoon of puttering around the house and straightening up your life!",1236556800,,453,4.404761904761905
3646492,5,B001I4BQ64,"I have been practicing yoga for over 10 years and have bought several yoga videos. I must say that this is my favorite. I find Janet to be graceful, wise, and challenging. I also love the modern set and her use of words. Her tone of voice is as enjoyable as the sequencing. I would be shocked if you didn't love her video!
Namaste.",1236470400,2,331,4.1875
3646493,5,B001I4BQ64,"I have been practicing yoga for more than 11 years and every now and then I like to change my practice to suit where ever I am emotionally, physically or spiritually.  I read about Janet Stone's new DVD from columnist Mark Morford (also a yoga master) and bought it immediately.  I love this DVD for its peacefulness, its loving kindness towards self and for its challenge to me as a long time practitioner.  I'd recommend it to any beginner too as she is so good at talking you into gently arriving in your postures and being happy with however far you can go on any day you come to your mat.",1224720000,17,593,4.324324324324325
8310430,5,B001I4BQ64,Janet is so inspiring. She's graceful in her practice. One day soon I want to go on one of her retreats.,1496966400,,104,4.0
8310431,5,B001I4BQ64,Love this video! Janet Stone is an excellent teacher. She does a great job at explaining the poses. Very unique!,1461196800,,112,4.65
8310432,2,B001I4BQ64,"she is full of herself, can't get past the personality",1434240000,,54,4.5
8310433,5,B001I4BQ64,What a beautiful class - I felt like a marshmallow at the end and can't wait to do the flow again. Great for morning and evening.,1416182400,,129,4.0
8310434,5,B001I4BQ64,"I love Janet stone yoga. Her sequences are always so unique and fluid, her voice is calming and motivating. I always feel relaxed and nimble after i do this. its mellow but you still work a sweat,  This DVD is probably best for more intermediate yogis .",1396137600,,253,4.382978723404255
8310435,5,B001I4BQ64,"Really interesting setting for the yoga workout, an old brick loft with lots of Hindu statues, flowers, and river rocks. Janet leads the small class of both men and women, each one dressed differently, a slightly different shape and height, and everyone achieved the poses differently. Very good video for men who are reluctant to do yoga as they think it is too feminine. The men in the video are very strong and athletic and masculine, and the women are that also...all quite lovely. Janet delivers excellent instructions in a voice over to the class. Fast flow...not much of a warm up. I suggest stretching and warming up before undertaking this workout.",1372032000,,657,4.875
8310436,5,B001I4BQ64,"I love her music, her voice is soothing, and its a challenging workout without feeling pressure to be a world class yogi. Love it!",1371859200,,130,4.458333333333333
8310437,4,B001I4BQ64,"Many years ago, I lost a lot of weight and I started trying to do yoga to keep in shape. I don't remember how I found it, but one of the first tapes I found was MTV Yoga. I've done yoga off an on since then and have a small collection of yoga DVDs, but none of them have ever been as good as MTV Yoga. What I liked about it was what many people like about Mellow Flow, it was just a sequence of poses and they didn't stop to explain poses or do anything instructional. It was just a flow of poses. The music was good, the set was good, and the flow of the poses was great.

For the people who think Mellow Flow is too hard, I recommend MTV Yoga. It is challenging, too, but the majority of it is more doable by a beginner.

Mellow Flow, in my opinion, still isn't as good as MTV Yoga, simply for the fact that if you are a little out of shape (like me) or not super flexible (like me), or older (like me), several of the poses are like ""pffft, yeah right.""

All that said, this video is excellent and probably moved to my number 2 spot on my list of good yoga workouts. Even though I can't do every move, I still enjoy the workout. Like MTV Yoga, the quality is great, the production is great...pretty much everything about it is good.

If I get ambitious, I might try and take the best parts of MTV Yoga and the best Parts of Mellow Flow and edit them into one DVD, cutting out the stuff that is impossible for beginners to do (Yes, after all these years, I do not consider myself to be beyond a beginner).",1359849600,4,1507,4.013333333333334
8310438,4,B001I4BQ64,"This is the most unique flow  I have ever experienced. I loved it but could not hang. Ive been doing yoga for 5 years and at this point this was too much for me. I don't know, maybe the timing was just off for me or I just don't have the strength. I would definitely rate this as an intermediate and not beginner flow. I probably got midway through before I had to call it quits. The set is unobtrusive, lighting and mood warm. I liked that there were other students at various levels so you could see slight modifications. I am excited to ease into this and attempt to master it. It is completely different than any other Yoga dvd I own.",1357516800,2,638,4.186991869918699
8310439,4,B001I4BQ64,"Though it's mellow, that doesn't mean it's easy. This routine is classic Janet Stone - meaning somewhat unconventional and interesting. It's the same crew that is on her Radient flow, on the same set, but now with everyone in black. It's not too mellow - she doesn't do any regular vinyassas or arm balancing, but you feel like you did a workout at the end. A nice alternative for days when you want something ""lighter.""",1331510400,4,420,4.613333333333333
