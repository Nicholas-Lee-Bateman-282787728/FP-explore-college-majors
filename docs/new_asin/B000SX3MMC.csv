8207065,5,B000SX3MMC,*PETTICOAT JUNCTION* was JUST ONE of my favorite childhood TV SHOW to watch. I like there funny shows:),1471651200,,103,4.777777777777778
8207066,4,B000SX3MMC,"Another reviewer has already helpfully provided the episode list, so I will not repeat that.  I just wanted to point out a few things.  First, the producers of this DVD must not have had the rights to the famous theme song. It has been replaced with a generic, bluegrass instrumental.  That doesn't sound like a big deal, but it is surprisingly weird not to hear ""and that's Uncle Joe, he's moving kind of slow at the junction. Petticoooooaaaattt Junction.""  In the Bobbie Jo and the Beatnik episode note that a young, clean-cut Dennis Hopper plays the beatnik.  These are all first season episodes, so the show and characters hadn't evolved yet.  For instance, in these episodes Bobbie Jo is portrayed as a bookworm, not the ditzy character she became.  Dog, the dog, had not yet joined the cast.  The focus was more on Kate than the girls.  It is interesting to see how different attitudes were back then.  For instance, in one episode, Kate uses her daughters' sex appeal to lure guests to the Shady Rest.  In today's PC world that would never fly.",1458345600,,1051,4.657608695652174

8207068,1,B000SX3MMC,"These are all black and white episodes from the first season, none are the trademark funny as the later episodes and the famous opening music and song either was removed or didn't exist for these. Very disappointed. Not in the seller, but in the selection of these awful episodes.",1343347200,,280,4.73469387755102
