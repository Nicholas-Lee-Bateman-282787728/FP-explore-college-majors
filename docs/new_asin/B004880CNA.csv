8572096,2,B004880CNA,"Well, both DVD's have Karting content. That is the positive. The negative is they are not a documentary or action video. They lean towards the cheap 80's style action video converted from VHS than anything else (cheap-porno music included). Look for the ""Oversteer"" DVD if you want something that looks like it was made in the last decade.",1293494400,,339,4.862068965517241
