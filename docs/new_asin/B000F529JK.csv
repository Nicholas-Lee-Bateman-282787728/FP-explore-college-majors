8117601,5,B000F529JK,"Playing on the universal fear of dentists, Gabriele Salvatores's DENTI revolves around Antonio (Sergio Rubini). Burdened with an unruly set of choppers, Antonio feels that teeth carry cosmic importance.  After a fight with his girlfriend, Mara (Anita Caprioli) about her possible romantic involvement with her dentist, Luca (Tom Novembre), Antonio begins to experience strong memories when his tongue hits a freshly damaged tooth.

  ""What are my teeth hiding?""  ""Is there a stomatological connection to memory?""  These are the questions Antonio asks himself as he searches for the truth hidden among his teeth.  He helps find some of these via Dr. Cagnano (Paolo Villaggio)--a rather unconventional dentist--and from memories of his saintly mother (Anouk Grinberg) and oversexed uncle (Fabrizio Bentivoglio).

  When hearing the premise of DENTI, I was afraid that it might be comparable to Manny Coto's DR. GIGGLES (1992) or reminiscent of the dentistry torture of John Schlesinger's MARATHON MAN.  Instead, DENTI is a stylishly shot and wonderfully paced tale of prognathism, love, family, and memory.",1149120000,,1104,5.590361445783133
