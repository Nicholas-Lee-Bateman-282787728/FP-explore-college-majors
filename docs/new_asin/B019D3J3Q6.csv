8744779,3,B019D3J3Q6,"A little truth in advertising: The upper left hand corner of the dvd cover says ""Deadlier than Ilsa"".  Ah, nope!  Helga, She Wolf of Stilberg is almost a pussycat compared to Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS.  Helga is a similar authoritarian figure as Ilsa, but her control is limited to the oversight of about a dozen female political prisoners in some fictional Latin/South American country.  Whereas Ilsa wantonly seduces and tortures the men in her WWII p.o.w. camp and brutalizes the women with strange ""scientific"" experiments as well as forcing them to ""service"" the local SS troops, outrageous physical punishment and brutality is more the exception than the rule in Helga.  There are a couple of whippings, some bondage, some implicit forced sex scenes and maybe one ultimate death of a prisoner at the hands of the guards (before the you-know-what hits the fan right at the end), but Helga is more or less a rather restrained overseer.  Regardless of her sneers and threats, her usual punishments typically consist of increased work duties (mostly policing up certain areas along the main roads).  The female prisoners fear that they might attract Helga's attention because then .... well ... then Helga starts being nice to them and allows them a much nicer living environment.

Ah yeah, that's one of the plot contradictions that make this film unexpectedly funny or at least leaving you wondering what the heck is going on.  For all her mean reputation, Helga comes across as a a lonely female who wants nothing more than to be truly loved.  A local soldier will do, but she really wants that special connection with one of the female prisoners.  When she thinks she has it, she's happy and content.  but after she finds she's been used, she's heartbroken (after all, why can't a dominating sadist find true love with one of her helpless, tormented prisoners?) and that reveals Helga Unleashed .... which, apparently, means more work duties for the prisoners.  It's inhibited story writing like this that will leave the discerning lover of 70's WWII sexploitation style genre shaking their heads at this movie, as if there had been a deliberate effort to create a ""kinder, gentler"" Ilsa-themed story which backs away from the crazy violence of the original.

Oh, it's got the beautiful but cruel female overseer and the requisite collection of females who will be nude and degraded throughout the film, but for those expecting the extreme shock inducing behavior found in Ilsa, Helga will leave you disappointed.

Add to all this some very poor plot lines: why exactly is the doctor character needed?  At all?  When the two females decide to escape toward the end of the movie, why is it necessary to seduce this doctor and steal his keys?  Why?  The only thing the doctor kept under lock was his badly hidden horde of liquor.  And .... And ... And .... oh never mind!  I don't want to spoil everything for you.  So forget all about the one prisoner who gets out of and goes back to bed completely naked except for the pair of high-heel party shoes with ankle straps.  And that on work duty all women wear work clothes that look suspiciously like trench coats and...

Oh yeah!  No spoilers!  :-P

I'd recommend this only to real fans of women in prison movies.  For those looking for another Ilsa (either ""she wolf of the ss"" or ""harem keeper of the oil sheiks"") this movie will not meet your expectations. Still it has its quota of pretty female nudes in stressful situations and it is fun to watch for all the plot holes you could drive a truck through.

With that in mind, this is an entertaining movie if accompanied by much beer and bowls of popcorn.",1483747200,8,3661,4.7484177215189876

8744784,4,B019D3J3Q6,"Set in South America, HELGA, SHE WOLF OF STILBERG follows the exploits of Helga (Malisa Longo) is the sole female adviser to the President of a small country. Tired of her interference, the President promotes her to being the warden of Stilberg Prison. This particular prison houses only female prisoners who are considered to be political liabilities. Once in charge, she takes advantage of the women who turn down her advances. Then she meets Elizabeth (Patrizia Gori) who appears to be following her orders. The reality is that she's the daughter of the rebel leader and she plans to break out and lead her father to the camp so he can destroy it along with Helga's evil ways.

If you're seeking out this film then you'll most likely recognize the name Eurocine. They were responsible for producing handfuls of the Nazisploitation films from the 70's. HELGA, SHE WOLF OF STILBERG (aka GIRL SLAVES, BLOODY CAMP, and several other titles) is another one of their gems starring the lovely Malisa Longo who many may recognize from the films of Tinto Brass. It's sort of unfair to give this film a standard review, it has to viewed in a certain mindset in order to enjoy. This is essentially another Women In Prison (WIP) flick so as long as the elements are there and you know what you're getting, then you really can't go wrong. So lets go over the checklist and see if this is a winner. Is there an evil warden: YES. We're good there. Is there an escape plan? Of course there is. Are the guards stripping the girls down and forcing them into sex? Sure thing. Does the camera shy away from these ladies when they're stripped down? They most certainly do not. In fact, it almost seemed like the wardrobe department forgot most of the wardrobe.  So, if you're seeking out this film, I know you're seeking it out for a particular reason. If you want to know if it delivers what you're expecting then the answer is yes. It's all there, while it may not be up to ILSA, SHE WOLF OF THE SS standards, the goods are here and that's really all we're asking for.",1465862400,18,2052,4.558265582655826
