When he runs for political office, his enemies play on his temper and contempt and manage to get him exiled. Bitter, he joins the other side and brings Rome to her knees before his mother successfully intervenes. The other side is pissed and turns on him, leading to his death.

I thought the actor who played Coriolanus was very good. He was believable with a raspy voice and wiry frame and volcanic temper. He also delivered a sympathetic portrayal of someone who, although arrogant, spoke his mind without guile -- clearly not a silver-tongued politician. The moment when he wept in front of his mother was moving. Shakespeare sets it up so you look down on the duplicitous tribunes, Sicinius and Junius, and the fickle plebes -- there's a real contempt for democracy in this play.

The play reminded me in a few ways of The Tragedy of Julius Caesar. Both plays show people jealous of someone who outshines everyone else. Also, the mob of citizens are an unthinking herd.

As for this production, I noted that there were many scenes and lines omitted. The director also opted to change the death scene at the end so that it was only Aufidius who killed him and not the Corioli mob. I'm not sure what this is called in theatre -  an event that's stripped down to a minimum like, for example, a whole battle reduced to three men. To one experiencing the play for the first time as I did, it was confusing to see Coriolanus stabbed by Aufidius in this way. I wondered if a more faithful staging of this scene would've worked better.

The director also showed Aufidius' homoerotic feelings towards Coriolanus in an obvious physical way. I disagreed with this decision and felt there was no need to underline it so blatantly.",1514678400,,1866,4.642424242424243
8545309,2,B009YMWAAI,"I realize the dvds in this series vary in quality, but this is not one of the better ones.  The main cast includes well known and highly regarded actors but somehow they can't seem to make this play work.  These plays are supposed to be complete, but I found bits omitted.  The parts they cut left the action just hanging. I also was not keen on the costuming.  I would not recommend this.",1512000000,,389,4.287671232876712
