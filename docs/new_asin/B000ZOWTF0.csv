3043090,3,B000ZOWTF0,"Having grown up in Rhode Island and spending many hours at Rocky Point in my youth, I was excited when You Must Be This Tall debuted.  I had never known very much about the park's history and the opportunity to learn more about this slapdash amusement park (at least that's how it was by time I attended it during the 1980s) was a draw for me.  The documentary starts out excellent, recounting the early history of the park using old photographs and paintings.  For about 15 minutes or so the film is terrific.  Then, for reasons unknown, the director allows his promising film to fall apart.  The central problem is that he abandons linear storytelling and instead presents the park in a series of seemingly random bits of footage without any sense of the time period we are viewing.  The film jumps back and forth through the decades and we are left to figure out the years by cobbling together visual information through the way people dressed.  The director also loses a terrific opportunity to create a story culminating in the eventual destruction of the park.  Instead we see the park being destroyed throughout the documentary without much exposition.  Little time is given to explaining why the park eventually closed.  Also, interviews of former employees that are meant to be nostalgic or humorous lead you to believe that the people who ran the park were a bit rough around the edges.  One former employee, for example, recounts a famous encounter with a Kennedy, which is initially amusing but is ultimately embarrassing as the man continues to curse throughout his account.  These are the people that ran the rides at Rocky Point?  Finally, isn't there better surviving footage of the park's commercials?  During the 1980s commercials for Rocky Point ran on television virtually non-stop.  However the footage ultimately utilized in the documentary is grainy and is clearly taken off a VHS tape.  You Must Be This Tall is a missed opportunity to tell the real story of Rocky Point.  Instead we get some random nostalgic footage without a time stamp causing confusion to the viewer.  Don't get me wrong; it was fun to see footage of the park in its heyday, however sloppy editing ultimately makes You Must Be This Tall a disappointing account of an only okay amusement park.  I can't imagine this appealing to anyone outside of Rhode Island.",1197244800,8,2354,4.84
3043091,5,B000ZOWTF0,"I just had to give this five stars.  Four would have been adequate but I added one for nostalgia.  I grew up in Providence and though I left almost 25 years ago, the memories of Rocky Point came flooding back as if I was there only yesterday.  The movie is well done and will appeal to Rhode Islanders lucky enough to have been around when the park was still in service or to anyone interested in the history of amusement parks in America.

I was about eight the first time the old man took us to Rocky Point (1973).  My late father had a general loathing for a) anything with crowds and b) traffic!  Generally, if something we wanted to do was not within walking distance in our neighborhood (Silver Lake) we just didn't get to do it.  Disney?  Hell...that was for rich kids (or so Dad said).  But, for the next few years he kept his promise and took us once a season, usually at the end of the school year.

It was adolescence when Rocky Point became a more common destination.  Starting with (I think) 7th grade when most of us were tall enough for all the rides and my Dad didn't have to go!  As we became teenagers Rocky Point became a place to take our girlfriends (or find a new one!). I mean, who has not ""made out"" in the House of Horrors?  Show of hands?  The concerts were great.  I saw Flock of Seagulls, the Fixx, and local bands such as the Probers and MX.  It was not a weekly destination, usually just several times a season and many 4th of Julys.  Downtown Providence was a lively place at night and weekends--Lupos, The Living Room, Joann's Silver Spoon Diner; I just didn't get out of it too often.  We assumed Rocky Point was always going to be there, despite the long heard rumors of money troubles.  Whenever I went for a visit the park was always booming.

The interviews were generally OK.  Some of the old employees had some good stories to tell.  The sight of a toupee-less Buddy Cianci was an extra bonus.

I was sorry when I heard it had closed.  I was living overseas and it became one less destination that I always intended to revisit but would never get the chance.  I would have liked the movie to have touched on the topic of the park's financial collapse.  Seeing the rides being sold off on a cold wet day was surreal...and sad.  Seeing the park afterwards, just before demolition, was even sadder.  The bonus extras are very good.  There are some commercials, the Rocky Point jingle, and a video that new employees of the park had to watch upon being hired.  It was a hoot.  Don't forget the clam cakes (eat them fast before they cool and the grease hardens!!!!).

I don't think David Bettencourt set out to win an Emmy when he came up with this idea.  He wanted to tell a story that Rhode Islanders could identify with and in that he was fully successful. Generally, I found there was an adequate enough time line.  The grainy quality of (some of the) the park video was very reminiscent in a nostalgic way of the family videos shot back when it was ""Rhode Island's Number One Destination!""

There are a lot of interviews with former employees, park visitors and local personalities who express their fondest memories of the park. I would have liked to have seen a more historical perspective on Rocky Point and what actually brought it down. I actually enjoyed Disc 2 better.

The jingles, the rides, the chowder and clamcakes..it really is a shame the park had to close. If it were still open today, I know for sure we would still be going there. We really do wish that Rhode Island would bring it back all fresh and new. There are no amusement parks of any kind in this state. If we had another park like Rocky Point I think it would do very well today...For those of you who haven't seen this movie, buy it.

3043095,5,B000ZOWTF0,"Have you ever wondered what it would be like to turn back time, to recapture your favorite childhood memories?  Well, if you grew up in New England - heck, if you ever visited any traditional amusement park as a kid - this movie can't be missed.  For almost 150 years, Rocky Point was the playground for millions of us.  And this movie takes us on one last wild ride, back to the days of clamcakes & chowder, end-of-school year outings, and just plain old ""Amusement Park Fun in the Rhode Island Sun!""

It's all here, from the humble beginnings as a picnic park located on picturesque Narrangansett Bay to it's heyday as one of New England's premier amusement parks.  You can see that one of a kind view again from the World's Largest Shore Dinner Hall.  You'll ride the rides, from early Merry Go Rounds to the Million Dollar Flume Ride, from the first wooden  Wildcat coaster to the even scarier Wildcat coaster made of steel.  And all three diving boards are now open in that salt water swimming pool's diving tower.  You'll also hear from everyone who hasn't stopped talking about Rocky Point since it closed in 1995.  And what stories ...

Don't miss the DVD extras and ""re-enactments"" in Disc 2, along with some crazy footage from the cutting room floor!

Do you wish that amusement parks involved more than hour-long lines and $50 admission prices? Remember when you didn't need a tram to reach the front gate, and rides took ""tickets!"" Then this 2-disc set is for anyone who wants to get in that family car again with the windows down, and head out to that magical place you thought was gone forever.  Remember, the clamcakes and chowder are still ""all you can eat"" and you can ride all the rides if you ""P.O.P""!  Make it a point - to see Rocky Point.",1205971200,2,1759,4.525316455696203

The historical accounts of presidents visiting the park, Babe Ruth playing baseball on the grounds and the history of the park from opening day to the last day of demolition are riveting and would be enjoyed by residents of any state just as well as Rhode Islanders.

I'm also an owner of the DVD and can tell you that the bonus features are worth the selling price alone! You will not laugh at anything harder than the 'Historical Reenactments' or the interviews that were left on the cutting room floor!

3043100,5,B000ZOWTF0,"The DVD release of ""You Must Be This Tall"" The Rocky Point Movie is a funny, touching, sad and historical documentary regarding the longest running amusement park in Rhode Island's history.  Although the park is now gone, this film brought back many memories from when I was a kid, as well as filled in the park's history that I never knew about.

There are many interviews with the people who worked at the shore dining hall, the ride operators, park management, midway games and the people who spent their summers there.  They even have interviews with people who got engaged at the park.  It is intercut with footage of the park as it stood a year or two ago, before the last of the park was demolished.  They also have footage of the auction as the rides were unceremoniously sold off on a cold rainy day.  The filmmakers even went through the trouble to find the rides that are still in use throughout the world.

This is a great way to preserve memories that many New Englanders shared over the past 100 years.  Just like Rhode Island, it's quirky, unusual, funny and touching and rather than whitewash it's history, it's presented warts and all. The original sountrack keeps the film upbeat and moving along. It's a great film made by the people who grew up in the park.  To sum up, it is wicked awesome!",1197331200,5,1311,4.54468085106383
