8179098,5,B000NKH88E,"Is Alison going crazy and doing unusual and dangerous things, or is there a conspiracy? This is a well-done Gaslight-type thriller. Suspenseful and engaging from the action-filled opening scene. Acting is superb, and the plot twists entertaining. As a bonus, there are snippets of humor throughout. Great movie. Must see viewing.",1514246400,,329,5.470588235294118
