8364721,5,B002D2Y9CI,This is a Region 4 disk.  No problem.  I have a multi region player.  Arrived quickly in perfect condition.,1275782400,,107,4.526315789473684
8364722,5,B002D2Y9CI,"Continuing a ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Third-Man-Out/dp/B000FZEU1K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Third Man Out</a>"" line, brave detective underwent a string of mortally-dangerous encounters to secure surprising three million dollar donation his partner-a social worker was miraculously given a humanistic youth program to run.

It is a good movie if even not embedding same gender affairs issues, of which emphasising a social/professional ""normality"" of gay professionals is the most.",1275177600,,527,7.5
8364723,5,B002D2Y9CI,"I didn't realize that Here! TV cancelled this excellent series until I visited Chad Allen's website.  I know Ron Oliver, the producer, has two finished scripts and was ready to proceed until Here! TV pulled the plug.  This series is good enough to be on Showtime or HBO.
And, to add insult to injury, only Australia has been able to release a full DVD of ""Ice Blues"".  I also wrote Here! TV and got a lame response.
If anyone hears of the DVD of ""Ice Blues"" being released in the USA or of any news of the series resuming, please let us know!!!",1270252800,,544,4.262135922330097
8364724,5,B002D2Y9CI,"Loved this last story in the Donald Strachey series. Why is excellent series has been cancelled by Here! tv I don't know. Also a mystery is why this DVD is not available any where else other than Australia (region 4) Thankfully Amazon have it available through one of its out lets and I highly recommend it. Great story, acting and production. Get it now before copies run out.",1269993600,,377,4.5588235294117645

8364726,5,B002D2Y9CI,I love Chad Allen in this.  I have watched it several times and it is great.  Received it on time and in excellent condition.,1260835200,2,125,4.166666666666667
8364727,5,B002D2Y9CI,"I can't wait for ""Ice Blues"" to come out. I have all the Donald Strachey Mysteries and they are all great.

In other words they aren't telling.  I don't understand why it's taking so long to release.",1256169600,8,851,4.458064516129032
8364728,5,B002D2Y9CI,"I enjoyed ""Ice-Blues"" on ""here-tv"" many months ago, not long after ""On the Other Hand Death."" Why one is on DVD already, whereas the other is not, is a surprise. I hope they release Ice Blues soon, to add to my Donald Strachey collection.",1247529600,13,238,4.431818181818182
8364729,5,B002D2Y9CI,"I've seen the trailer for ""Ice Blues"" on the DVD for ""On The Other Hand, Death"". Judging from the trailer, it looks like another terrific Donald Strachey mystery.
When will this movie be available on USA format? Please don't deny us fans of more Strachey!",1247443200,16,255,4.688888888888889
