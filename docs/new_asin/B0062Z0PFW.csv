4934086,3,B0062Z0PFW,Some of it is a bit old and creaky but there are some fine moments in it there is no director credited for the film,1391990400,2,115,3.64
4934087,3,B0062Z0PFW,"Hollywood Party(released June/34)stars,among others,Jimmy Durante,Stan Laurel,Oliver Hardy,Jack Pearl,Polly Moran,Charles Butterworth,Eddie Quillan,June Clyde,Mickey Mouse (Voiced by Walt Disney),
Lupe Vlez and George Givot. The latter was to appear later in Hollywood Cavalcade in the silent portion as the villain,with Faye and Keaton. This film is a mixed bag of goodies. It does have some catchy numbers,the two best being its title song(which keeps cropping up in my head when I least expect it.....grrrrrr) and I've had my Moments. It is often billed as a Laurel and Hardy picture but The Boys were added later to give the film the lift it needed. I cannot imagine this film without them as they are the real highlight. Their eventual gag sequence with Lupe Velez with the eggs is the essence of pure and unadulterated comedy at its very finest. It should be taught in every school that has courses on film humour. Ted Healy appears with The Three Stooges,who would soon,thankfully ditch him and pursue their own path. Charles Butterworth does his usual mixed up/absent mindedness routine,and of course the picture's lynch pin is the veteran Jimmy Durante. He mugs his way through the whole picture but is at his best when he sings. The ""comedic"" material he is given isn't worth much. The whole picture's story is about a party given at Durante's place. In the end we see it was all a dream,kind of a cheat considering you don't know where or when he started dreaming. Also in the film is the Technicolour sequence of Disney's animation,the Hot Chocolate Soldiers. It is delightful and the colours are very good looking. I had never seen the sequence in colour before,even though I have seen the film countless times.
Unfortunately,like many of these singing and dancing extravaganzas of the period,there is just far too much of it,such as the overly long and coy number where Durante introduces the big game hunter just returned from Africa with the lions he wants to buy. Also some routines fall flat,such as Moran being seduced by Givot. This DVD has the trailer and an audio portion of the songs and alternates.
All in all,while noteworthy because of the inclusion of Laurel and Hardy with their famous Velez sequence,Hollywood Party is otherwise a ponderous mixed bag of nuts affair,that even in this 68 minute version,tests one's patience. It was not a critical or financial success in its day,and time hasn't been forgiving either.",1390694400,7,2445,5.0395061728395065
4934088,4,B0062Z0PFW,"This 1934 pre-Code delightfully demented cinematic confection features Jimmy Durante as a screen Tarzan who among other things goes through successive reincarnations as a butterfly, Adam, and Paul Revere's horse, while trying to save his film career by buying lions from Baron Munchausen, Laurel and Hardy getting into an egg fight with Lupe Velez, who is wearing a dress so daring it would be hard to get away with even today, and Mickey Mouse introducing a mini-epic cartoon about a war between Chocolate Soldiers and Gingerbread Men.  Well, I warned you it was weird.  Also included are some Busby Berkley-like elaborately camp production numbers and a Fred-and-Ginger-like young couple dancing their way into love.  In short, one of the great neglected early talkies, and sort of a perhaps unintentionally surrealist minor classic.  Cinematography by James Wong Howe adds a touch of class.  The Warner Archive DVD is of good quality, though it seems the original print isn't very pristine.",1377129600,10,993,5.220125786163522
4934089,5,B0062Z0PFW,"Jimmy Durante decides to have a Hollywood Party and his guests,movie stars and assorted characters(Including Mickey Mouse)show up.
Lupe Valez,Robert Young,Polly Moran,Charles Butterworth,Jack Healy,The Three Stooges,etc are all there.
Unwanted guests,Laurel and Hardy show up and become a major pest to the other guests.(Very Funny scene when Stan,Ollie,and Lupe have a free for all at the bar)
Jimmy,of course,steals the show as movie star,Schnazan(Tarzan,eat your heart out)
Note The Mickey Mouse and Disney cartoon Red Hot Chocolate Soildiers had been cut and lost for years. Now,its been restored. According to a Laurel and Hardy book there was a scene with The Three Little Pigs and the Big Bad Wolf,but to my knowledge its still lost. Oh,well. Its not a perfect world.
Great songs and a very funny All Star Film.
Note Yet another funny scene with Jimmy VS Mickey.(Who will win????Watch it and see)",1327104000,11,903,5.277777777777778
4934090,5,B0062Z0PFW,a long awaited brilliant compilation of the early years of comedy. Would highly recommend this dvd most of the compilation brings back memories of a childhood where everything seemed simple and you were back in those early days of comedy,1326412800,5,237,4.95
8491553,5,B0062Z0PFW,This movie is sick/crazy emblematic of pre-code all-star lunacy. A memorable piece of wild Hollywood history.,1523318400,,109,5.875
8491554,5,B0062Z0PFW,"Who says people didn't have a good time in the 1930s? Jimmy Durante, during his crazier days, he got a little more sophisticated in his late 1940s films, but here, he is untamable. Especially since he's dealing with untamed lions. Durante's Tarzan referenced Shnarzan films (Shnarzan, shnoz, nose) has given viewers the idea that he's using lions too tame. His rival Liondora comes to his wild big mansion party (who masquerades as the Grand Royal Duke of something something, I can't remember) to try and steal the new feirce lions, which have been shipped to Shnarzan so he can improve his films and reputation. He has them park the lions right outside his house during the party to show all his friends the kind of lions he'll be using now.

The party itself is pretty wild, lots of beautiful women dancing, drinking. I liked some original angles used here such as a big wall with platforms for the band instruments, some original dance moves such as couples dance stepping over tables in neat way, beauties dancing kinky, and a section of 4 pianists playing down a line (and who was that be-bop kid singing at the last piano? he looked like a total ladies magnet).  Three great songs during the party, the title song ""Hollywood party"" (goin a mile a minute, nobody sleeps tonight), ""Feelin high"", and ""I have my moments"" sung once between a young dancing couple, and again a little later from the mother of the girl of that couple while with Durante while playing piano very well.

There was some truely funny comical pieces here. Look out for while Durante and his ex Maria Lupez fighting on the phone, Lupez takes a photo of smiling Durante, throws it on the floor and steps on it hard, giving the photo'd Durante a black eye. Hilarious. Then a great scene between Lupez and Laurel and Hardy having a fight with raw eggs. Then, there's a very iffier than usual, kinda creepy Disney cartoon ""Hot Chocolate soldiers"" at war, right after the cartoon intro with Mickey Mouse, who also does an uncanny visual impression of Durante. There's one other visual impression of Durante with a horse, leading up to a joke about it near the end of this great film. There's also a twist I will not share here.",1508716800,,2200,4.650385604113111
8491555,4,B0062Z0PFW,"Yes, this movie is a mess. Apparently there were eight different directors, the plot makes no sense (it's really just a bunch of skits and songs), the critics hated it, and some of the best parts were cut before release. Nevertheless.... we enjoyed it. Several great Rodgers and Hart songs, including the title song, which is earworm material. A chance to see a bunch of early film character actors and vaudevillians: Jimmy Durante in his prime, Mickey Mouse, Laurel and Hardy meet Lupe Velez, the ""Mexican Spitfire,"" Charles Butterworth (who later inspired the voice of Captain Crunch) plays a naive billionaire. And there's a surprise Technicolor segment. We're glad we watched this. Get up, get out, get in it!",1485648000,,713,5.0

8491558,5,B0062Z0PFW,"This film is a wild ride, with many wonderful performers doing bits: Laurel and Hardy with Lupe Velez. Her sort of clothed gown is a sight to see. Also, Jimmy Durante as ""Schnarzan, King of the Jungle""  is fun to see. Even if you aren't a hardcore old film buff, this is glamour drenched slightly pre-Code enjoyment.",1460332800,2,316,4.543859649122807
8491559,4,B0062Z0PFW,"A VERY WEIRD MOVIE FROM 1934, BUT WAS WORTH WATCHING FOR ME AT LEAST BECAUSE OF THE VERY SHORT TED HEALY AND HIS STOOGES BIT AND ALSO FOR THE LAUREL AND HARDY GAGS TOWARDS THE END. THE MICKEY MOUSE BIT WAS INTERESTING BUT THE DISNEY CARTOON REALLY DATED, AS WAS THE JIMMY DURANTE AND OTHER SEGMENTS. SOME OF THE MUSICAL NUMBERS WERE INTERESTING AS IT WAS PRE-CODE  AND THE BUSBY-LIKE FORMATIONS OF WOMEN SINGING RATHER TRIPPY.",1456012800,,426,4.605263157894737
