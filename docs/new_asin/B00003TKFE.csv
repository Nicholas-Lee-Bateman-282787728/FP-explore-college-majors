7919491,5,B00003TKFE,"Wildside is a series that starts kind of slow. While there's some stuff to praise in the first episode (the bizarre opening sequence, the expanded supporting cast, the characterizations), the plot itself is so-so. Ditto for the second episode. The third episode, ""Crimean of the Century"" starts to aim for the bizarre mix that they would eventually achieve, a kind of Brisco County/Wild Wild West ambience. The fourth episode, with the death of a character's girlfriend Melissa, is where the show really takes off. Howard Rollins Jr. demonstrates why he used to be considered a major star, and why Meg Ryan became one. Even William Smith does surprisingly well for anyone familiar with the type of movie and performance he usually gets stuck with. ""Buffalo Who?"", the fifth episode, is almost as good, with Varges suffering a crisis of confidence while the team takes on a fake Buffalo Bill travelling show that is almost as good as they are. And the final episode, the appropriately named ""Until the Fat Lady Sings"", starts with another quirky opening (ballerinas, monkeys, gunfighters) and has some fun with what they obviously knew was the last episode (catch the end dialogue). Overall, Wildside starts slow, but it was clear that the folks on the show were having a fun time. It's a weird mix of a more traditional Western, the goofier fantasy Westerns like Wild Wild West and Brisco County, and the more characterization-driven ensemble series of the 80's.",997747200,,1462,4.995901639344262
7919492,5,B00003TKFE,"When I first saw Tom Greene talking about his show Wildside on CNN, I was jumping up and down, since it was the first time in God knows how long that a western was coming back on television. Even with the video camera  shooting Greene on the set, I could see that this wasn't going to be any  ordinary western series. The costumes, sets, even the chose of horses and  props were unusual, and very authentic (I teach early American history). My  only concern was that Greene was so young that I worried if the show itself  would have the heart and sense of history that is so needed to make it  work. After viewing the first hour, I had was not only worry-less, but  overjoyed. I notice that there are many other reviews from viewers who are  much more articulate than I could ever be, praising this series, and these  tapes for sale. So let me just say that if you've come this far to read  this review, I can not stress hard enough that if you ever buy ANY video of  ANY show on sale here... this is the one. How many times have you bought a  CD or a Video only to listen to it once, or watch it once, and then look  around sheepishly to see if anyone is watching, since you realize you've  been suckered, and you'll never watch or listen to it again? Well this  time, your money (very reasonable for six hours of film!) will be very well  spent. You will find yourself watching WILDSIDE over and over, finding more  and more layers of character, plot, humor and action and symbolism each  time you watch it. Make sure, by the way, to watch the episodes in order,  since even though they are not serialized there is a real progression of  plot and character, especially with the regulars. Oh, if only this could  have stayed on the air as long as so many over-rated shows... think of the  heights it would have achieved! Anyway, please read on to the other reviews  for more detail, and in the meantime... buy this one! Really! And if  nothing else, for the women, go gaga over J. Eddie Peck (if you're young,  teens and 20's), and John DiAquino and William Smith (if you are more in  the 30-something crowd); and for us guys, of all ages, there's Meg Ryan at  her best, and a sweet redhead (whose name escapes me), as the most sexy  ""girl next door"" undertaker you've ever met (and tell me, how many girl  next door undertakers do you know! ). Wildside is that kind of show. And as  ""Annie Oakley"" says in Wildside: ""there's nothing I like more than to see a  man with a gun in his hand and two balls in the air!"". Bravo Tom Greene for  giving us Wildside, and Bravo Disney for making it, and bringing it back in  this neat-o box set! I'm buying a bunch to send to friends!",958435200,13,2675,4.275449101796407
7919493,5,B00003TKFE,"If you love Westerns, Comedies, Love Stories, and Stick to your seat action then you definitely MUST see this set of videos. I've been waiting years to get this set....It's truly ashamed that the show was so short  lived. I GIVE THESE GREAT STARS A THUMBS UP!  I Love Them!

7919494,5,B00003TKFE,"Tom Greene's ""Wildside"" totally takes its place as not only one of the top ten best Westerns of all times... but as one of the all time classics... a top ten in ANY category!  I talk about Wildside as if it were a feature  film, since when I first saw it on TV as a Mini-Series, I was totally taken  by the depth of emotion, the smart dialogue, quirky, totally original  characters, the humor, and best of all, the production values. I kept  forgetting when talking to people about Wildside, that I didn't see it on  the big screen... since everything about the six hours of delightful  entertainment is larger than life... and so very cinematic. From the very  first scene, all done without dialogue were ""Hatchet's"" gang blow up a safe  at a bank... and show how totally mean they really are (you just have to  watch what they do to the little boy's goldfish!), you know you're watching  an intelligent, well-crafted piece of work that knows when to go for the  laughs, when to go for the heart, and when to go for the throat! Many of  the actors went on to superstardom... like Meg Ryan, and Howard Rollins and  James Cromwell to name just a few that I remember, but honestly I don't  think I've ever seen any of them do better work than right here. Especially  Meg. There are also just great classic actors, like William Smith (playing  a really wonderful good guy, which I don't think he's ever done then or  since... and it's amazing how much he reminds me of ""Hipshot Percussion""  from the old ""Rick O'Shay"" western cartoon strip!) and Buck Taylor and  Geoffrey Lewis, and that Indian from ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest""...  and many great faces that you've seen now and then... all of them showing  off the kinds of characterizations and acting ability that you just don't  see in TV. I guess because they are all true hero's... with 3D backstories,  and motivations that make everything they do totally understandable. One of  the best of all the characters is played by actress Robin Hoff, who I  haven't seen before or since, in one of the most brilliant parts I've ever  seen on TV... playing the town's undertaker as if she was the head of the  Varsity High School Cheerleading Squad! Total inspiration! And her love  scenes in her funeral parlor with the sexy gaucho, played by John DiAquino,  are pure genius! Anyone who has ideas of being an actor, a writer or a  director should study Wildside... it doesn't get any better. Why this was  only a Mini-Series is anyone's guess. I could see it on the air for as long  as, let's say Gunsmoke or Bonanza. One other point... you don't have to be  a western fan to love this show. Though in my opinion it's the most  successful and faithful western every put on the small screen, it is more  about people and situations than about guns and horses. There is one  episode in which Howard Rollins is about to propose to the  love-of-his-life, only to discover the next morning that she has died, and  therefore so shocked with grief that he can not accept the fact that it was  ""natural causes"", and instead goes off on an almost suicidal search for  ""the killer"" (not realizing that the ""killer"" is simply life's fate). If  ever there was a more magnificent tone-poem about love and grief and  forgiveness and acceptance... I can't find it. The scene with Howard and  Meg Ryan, where she tries to explain the realities of life to him is by far  the most brilliant acted, directed and written moments of truth you will  ever experience. And if you're not a babbling puddle of tears with a lump  in your throat the size of Monument Valley at the end of that episode,  where Howard says good-bye to his dead love, talking to the trees and  stars... then you must be dead yourself! Am I going overboard with my  praise? I don't think so. See for yourself. The test of a classic is one  that once you start looking at it, you can't stop watching, and even if you  have it on video, even if you've just seen it, if your ""flipping around the  TV, and it's on again, you sit and watch it, and can't STOP watching it  (i.e.: ""The Godfather I & 2). Wildside is such a piece. And once you've  experienced it, you'll find that the characters all stay with you like  great old friends (I espeically LOVE legendary wrestler Terry Funk as one  of the ""Wildside"" five! Tell me if you've ever seen such a  huggable teddy bear!)Special note should be paid also to the attention to  detail and close-up work. And very special attention should be made to the  art direction and to Ozzie Smith's camera work. Watch it and tell me when  you've seen anything this good! Who ever re-packaged this should be  commended, since it's been out of print for years. And these tapes are mint  condition, so they obviously took the care to go back to the original  negatives. My only complaint has to do with the packaging. It's a small  thing, but they've put the opening of the three tapes (two episodes on each  tape) on the bottom, not the side like other box sets, so when you pick up  the box, they fall out! Someone wasn't thinking. Perhaps it was the same  person who got the credits wrong on the box (though they are fine on the  tapes themselves). But those are small complaints when you realize that  they are back again for all to see!",958176000,,5275,4.48
7919495,5,B00003TKFE,"Wildside was the best, most lavishly produced,  short-lived TV series ever to be used as an ABC  sacrifice to the NBC Thursday night juggernaut which in 1985 was Cosby (doing battle with CBS's Magnum P.I.)  This 3-box set  contains all six action-filled, colorful  episodes.  I spent a fortune on  internet auctions painfully acquiring the six one-episode tapes released  back in the 80's.  Then my cousin found and bought this set on Amazon.  And  this set has better quality!  The series had the production values of  top-notch western movies including impressive cinematography and stuntwork.  See Meg Ryan just before she became a superstar.  See  William Smith 20  years after he costarred in Laredo in a more mature role in this much  better Western.  If you like westerns, you'll like Wildside.",952300800,3,801,5.069767441860465
7919496,5,B00003TKFE,"One of the all time great classics of a Western. Not just for TV, but for movies as well. The makers of this delight obviously not only understand what makes for great entertainment, but also obviously truly love the time  and place they are creating. And these days... that's VERY rare. For anyone  who loves the classic western genre, or just loves great characters,  storytelling and wonderfully unconventional adventure sagas..., Wildside is  for you! It also has great humor and great heart. The coming of age scene  in which old-time Brodie (William Smith), ""teaches"" his son the great  lesson of life with his six-gun in a cold barn has to be one of the great  moments on film. What a joy! Likewise the perfect scene of sexy gaucho,  Varges giving the world's first ""city slicker"" the most amazing lesson in  ""gun control"" you'll ever see! Likewise Varges' lovescenes with what has to  be one of the most hysterically original characters EVER in a western...  Miss Alice Freeze, a cheerleader-type undertaker, are a total delight. The  other woman in the video... one of the main characters in fact, is none  other than superstar Meg Ryan. I believe this is her first real project  before she became an international star. She is used to beautiful effect in  Wildside, and in several scenes, especially with equally as amazing Howard  Rollins, she shows a talent, that frankly I haven't seen utilized since.  Meg has fallen into that ""Anyone Meets Sally"" kind of movies, and as  desirable as she is, I don't think her talents have been so totally  utiltilized as well as right here in her first production! Being that this  was a Mini-Series, I doubt that they had the budgets of such big disasters  as ""Wyatt Earp"" or ""Silverado""... however the  production quality is far above those mega-budget misguided bombs. Somehow  I keep thinking of the classic western features of the 1950's, and  especially of the ""Spaghetti Westerns"", especially ""Once Upon A Time In The  West"" (which I'm sure the very first scene in Wildside is purposely making  a great tribute to), and ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly"". What makes  ""Wildside"" such a classic in my humble opinion is that, as I said, it  understands what makes not only westerns great, but great movies in  general... that is... movies with a strong story, and characters you care  about.  Lots of other soon-to-be great stars, including Oscar Nominated  James Cromwell (in a terrific role as a fake Buffalo Bill) are peppered  throughout, and in fact, the casting down to the smallest bit parts is  flawless.  I must warn you... the excellent production values, and  well-defined characters will get under your skin, and you'll want more! Why  there aren't any more of this ""jewel of the west"" is one of the great  mysteries of life! I just thank Disney for putting this out in a terrific  box set and at a great price (originally, they were selling this for over  forty dollars PER TAPE, and that was SIX tapes, not three then... so this  truly is a great bargin!).",952128000,,3023,4.7810077519379846

7919499,5,B00003TKFE,"Wildside is a winner on all fronts. A must have video for anyone who loves Mom, Apple Pie and guys who say lines like: ""Do me a favor, even up my notches!"". I'm always amazed how dumb people are. It seems that Hollywood  always picks the wrong people to do a western, and then when they muck it  up, everyone yells and screams and says : ""you see, no one wants to see a  western!"". It's not that they don't want to see a western... they don't  want to see a fake and/or BAD western! But when it's done right, when there  is a single vision, when the people involved obviously live and breath the  classic western, then sparks fly and great art, if not downright perfect  entertainment is born! Look at Dances With Wolves, or The Unforgiven and  you'll know what I mean. The same is true of this Mini-Series, Wildside.  Not since Sergio Leone himself (which this video obviously tips its hat and  gives great homage to), has anyone defined the west so perfectly, so  authentically, and with such skill and most important love. Brilliantly  shot, Wildside is a feast for the eyes, as well as for the mind and soul.  The dialogue throughout has that poetic breeziness, which, only those that  truly understand the western will understand. It is, after all, the  American Icon, a time and place that personified, more than anything,  American's brash, fresh, optimistic sense of right against wrong, of all  man's ability to succeed if they are righteous and work hard. Of  large-than-life heroes, who seem to be blessed, if not born with a  determination to make good the concept that all men are created equal, that  we all have the right, if not the privilege of life, liberty and the  pursuit of happiness. Maybe I'm going a bit overboard, but these qualities  are what make great American Art, and make the western great. And what make  this truly wonderful video great! From the quirky (renegade British Crimean  Horsemen travel to America to intimate settlers out of their oil rights),  to the sublime (a heartfelt, bittersweet and mature themed piece about the  serendipity of death); Wildside delivers. The level of acting is  staggering, especially from the very young Meg Ryan, and Howard Rollins,  and from the legendary William Smith (the great character actor from Rich  Man, Poor Man, the Clint Eastwood Movies, and a trillion other places...  and not to be confused with Will Smith of the Wild Wild West disaster), to  Wrestling Legend Terry Funk, to a whole plethora of guest stars. Take extra  care to watch the attention to detail, especially in the close-ups, and the  fact that although there are more than enough explosions and shoot-outs to  satisfy any action-adventure seeker, the violence is cleverly subdued. This  is not about violence. What seems to permeate through the entire  Mini-Series is a true love of the triumph of the human spirit. Not to  mention great amounts of humor! You like these people. You love having them  in your living room. You trust them, and you respect them. And God... how  rare is that these days?",952041600,,3051,4.75
7919500,5,B00003TKFE,"Any Mini-Series that has a lovable undertaker, who looks like a red-head Ally McBeal and has lines like ""Dying's not so bad... it's better than a sharp stick in the eye!""... is a Mini-Series worth owning! I knew nothing  about Wildside, until I was looking around for older Meg Ryan videos and  came across this. I bought it (you can't go wrong... six hours for about  thirty dollars), and ended up spending the entire day watching and  rewatching them. I'll be honest with you. I've never been a great fan of  westerns, but I LOVE this! You will laugh, cry, cheer, boo and hiss, and  jump up and down like a little kid on a ""horsy"". Now when did a film do  THAT for you! I have no idea where this came from, but since Meg looks  SOOOO young, it's obviously been a while ago, but I'm thankful it's come  out on video. If the creator and producer of this series, Tom Greene is  reading this... thank you, thank you, thank you! As for everyone else, buy  this... it's a million times better than going to Disneyland (Disney made  this, by the way), a lot cheaper, and you can re-visit it at all hours of  the day or night (and don't think I haven't!",952041600,,1147,4.303738317757009
