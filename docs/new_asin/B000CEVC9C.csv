8098553,3,B000CEVC9C,"If you own the first two volumes of this great TV series, you already have four out of the six episodes on this disc.  For some reason, the manufacturer decided to duplicate episodes instead of providing all new ones, different than those on volumes one and two.

A big disappointment, as I love this series and I was looking fwd to new episodes.  Only buy if you must have the two episodes that are different.  It's not terribly expensive.  If you don't have the first two volumes, then this is a nice little collection.",1357430400,4,521,4.5
8098554,5,B000CEVC9C,"This is such a fun old series of early television, I remember it as a child and was delighted when I found the DVD's.  One thing I have learned when buying these old TV series it's important to have the titles of episodes.  There's many different versions on the market and duplicates are far too easy to buy.  Bob plays both himself and Grandpa and Grandpa is a HOOT!  I'm sorry this is all there is, I would buy more if available.

Volume 3 Episodes:
Bob's Forgotten Fiance
Bob Goes to the Moon
Bob and Schultzy Reunite
Bob Retrenches
Grandpa's Old Buddy",1297468800,8,556,4.411764705882353
