6015780,5,B00FNPQW5Y,We love Henry and his whole Hugglemonster family! Great show that really grabs my sons attention. Henry Hugglemonster allows me to get things done around the house.,1389916800,,164,5.111111111111111
6015781,5,B00FNPQW5Y,"My kids have loved this show since it aired on Disney Jr so they were thrilled to watch Henry Hugglemonster: Meet the Hugglemonster on DVD. Its one of my magic shows as I call them. If I need to get something done and want to make sure my kids are glued to the TV, this is a show I put on!

Henry Hugglemonster and his adorable monster family and friends give monsters a good name! This was something we really needed at a time where my kids started to think there were monsters in their room at night. Now they have a friendly view of monsters instead of a  scary one and it took the stigma out of scary right out of the word monster in our house!

This DVD has six of the original episodes so even though my kids had seen most of them on TV multiple times, they still want to watch the DVD over and over and over and. There is also a bonus episode that they hadnt seen and loved.

As a fun little bonus, this comes with iron on decals. Weve actually never used them before so this was a fun little thing to do with them that was new and different and they thought was the coolest thing ever!

At just over two hours, my kids can watch this whole DVD and it buys me enough time to get things done distraction free. Or if its bedtime and they get one last show, I can just select one episode from the menu instead of playing all.

Disney Jr is a name I trust and my kids are allowed to watch anything on this channel and I don't have to worry about sitting and watching with them every time. Henry Hugglemonster is another smash hit and this DVD is sure to be as well.",1389052800,7,1568,4.041935483870968
