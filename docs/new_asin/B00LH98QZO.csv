6487454,1,B00LH98QZO,Terrible movie,1413590400,2,14,6.5
6487455,1,B00LH98QZO,"0 stars, this movie is one of the worst I've seen in a long time. We start off with a woman about to get raped but the guy hears something in the bushes & attacked by a wolf. Not graphic & when you see the wolf's point of view, it's red. The credit starts & it's a rip off of the Halloween theme. We get almost a half hour of a girl moving into home while she fells in love with an escaped convict. The caretaker, who may be related to her or not, not well explained tries to advance himself on her. If you have not falling asleep by now & I did, the werewolf attacks the escaped convict just to remind you that this is suppose to be a horror film. I fell asleep from sheer boredom but didn't really miss much as the ending made me groan. This movie sucks, cover art is awesome, but avoid it all cost. If someone tries to give you for free, avoid at all cost, this film sucks beyond belief.",1413504000,4,890,3.977653631284916
6487456,5,B00LH98QZO,This movie is dope af! I loved it. Low budget but still really enjoyable. Very 80s throwback,1413331200,,92,4.470588235294118

6487458,2,B00LH98QZO,"I wish Hollywood would get back on the werewolf train and start making more movies in the genre.  Seems like all of the studios are concerned more with vampires and zombies at the moment.  And while I suppose thats not a bad thing at all from a horror standpoint, filmmakers still need to show some love to the furry, carnivorous flesh-rippers that tore into our hearts in a big way back in the 80s.  As a result of this neglect from big name studios, independent filmmakers have had to take point on bringing us fans lycanthropic goodness.  Unfortunately, theres not much goodness at all to be found with WEREWOLF RISING, the latest film from director BC Furtney.

I really wanted to like this movie, especially because much of it was shot in Arkansas (only about three and a half hours from where I live).  Our state is filled with woodlands and mountains, therefore it makes the perfect backdrop for a werewolf tale to unfold.  Sadly, the beautiful scenery is the only positive aspect of this film.

WEREWOLF RISING is a low-budget film, and it looks like it in every detail.  While this is certainly forgivable in movies where good acting and a solid plot overshadow the budget, neither applies here.  As a result, the film looks cheap and suffers drastically because of it.

The film is shot in a decent manner, although the lighting could have been better in a few of the nighttime scenes.  The sets are very simple, which is not necessarily a bad thinghowever a little more emphasis on eye-pleasing backdrops would have been nice.  For example, the house in which Emma resides looks like nothing more than a converted doublewide, and the place conveys a sense of dreariness that is almost depressing.

The acting in WEREWOLF RISING leaves a lot to be desired, although a singular beacon of excellence shines through whenever Bill Oberst Jr. is onscreen.  Ive enjoyed Oberst Jr. in every role hes played, and he doesnt disappoint here.  Regrettably, hes only in the film for about 10 minutes.  The rest of the cast needs to go back to acting school.  They deliver their lines as if reading them for the first time.

The story is supposed to be pretty straightforward, but it never really comes together or goes anywhere.  Theres a lot of drama that is supposed to fill the gaps in between the horror, however it quickly becomes stale and moldy.  I actually found myself wanting the characters to get killed off so I didn't have to deal with their emotional baggage anymore.

The special effects are the final nail in the coffin for this film.  I was willing to let several of the flaws slide if the werewolf effects were wicked; after all, I always love seeing practical special effects instead of digital.  But I was disappointed once again.  Theres no makeup involved, just costumes.  They are not frightening at all, and they look like nothing more than a guy in a hairy suit.  The facial features of these so-called wolves look more like vampire bats than anything, especially when you take into account the long, bat-like ears.

I cannot, in good conscience, recommend WEREWOLF RISING, unless you are looking for a movie to laugh at.  I had high hopes for this one, especially since Bill Oberst Jr. was involved, but the film simply falls way below the mark.  It hits store shelves today if you want to give it a look.",1413244800,11,3329,4.679862306368331
6487459,1,B00LH98QZO,"Emma (Melissa Carnell) returns to her childhood home sober after 12-20 years. Here she finds Wayne (Brian Barry) who reads his lines worse than she does. She also meets escaped convict and Wayne's nephew Johnny Lee (Matt Copko) who sleeps in an abandoned church. Wayne uses lines like, ""You're beautiful. People find that attractive."" Emma also has bad dreams which didn't tie in too well.

This is a low budget film with few characters and less actors. The sound was uneven and very poor inside the truck cab. And what was that crawl on the floor thing Emma did with the convex (?) lens. The film is rather boring.

Writer, producer, make-up artist and actor Irena Murphy attempted to save the film by showing us her hooters. Man in werewolf suit with rubber mask didn't make it.

This movie is not scary. The characters are two-dimensional and the story was totally formulaic.  The best werewolf movies for me have always been those involving a misfortune soul who receives the curse.  When I watch a movie and don't care who lives or dies, I feel I have wasted my time.

The soundtrack (all four notes) is overpowering and exhaustive.  I could forgive the acting and even the Halloween store werewolf outfit if there was a story worthy of it. Alas the plot was too weak and riddled with holes. The entire project lacked any feel of passion of an indie film or other low budget offerings. I gave 2 stars for the simple fact that it took effort to bring this from mind to paper and then to film.",1434067200,,588,4.288288288288288

6487474,5,B00LH98QZO,"I think all these one-star reviews indicate what petulant, impatient, mall-rat mentalities so much of our society has become.  This is a low-budget film, and it shows.  It also is a movie that covers absolutely no new territory, artistic or otherwise.  The Werewolf suit is obviously just that, but it looks good for what it is.  Although it would have been more effective if seen only briefly or in bad lighting, I'm sure that would have raised another complaint.  The story unfolds at a decent pace, but the basic plot is one we've all seen over and over again. The acting is decent; there just aren't any roles for an actor to really sink their teeth into.  This is strictly a by-the-numbers werewolf flick, and it's OK if you are a fan of werewolves.  If not, then it is a waste of time.  The main sin this movie commits is that it's just good enough to avoid being unintentionally funny, but not good enough to be memorable. Though barely a 3 star flick, I'll give it a 5 just to offset a couple of the unjust one star reviews here.",1427587200,8,1037,4.421052631578948

6487479,1,B00LH98QZO,"SPOILER ALERT (so you don't have to watch this awful flick)  Young Twit with unresolved drug issues moves back to home to family mountain cabin.  Older, fat, Caretaker with a latent pedophilia tendency falls into lust, naturally.  There are 2 escaped convicts in the area.  Twit falls into lust with the younger who has a family connection with the Caretaker.  Meanwhile, the Caretaker (with the IQ of 3 snails and a rock) puts the moves on Twit.  The older convict attacks the younger convict turning him into you know what.  The Twit, being a Twit, doesn't realize potential implications of the attack and tries to care for the wounded young convict who eventually runs off into the woods.  The older of the convicts (also lusting after Twit) appears on the scene.  Confrontation ensues between all characters at night, naturally.  Fat Caretaker shoots and kills younger convict and wounds Twit and older convict. (No silver bullets here or any mention of needing them)  Naturally, Caretaker also is killed. Twit runs into woods pursued by lusting, older convict.  Twit comes upon a woman (waiting in a red robe by a campfire.)  This chicks libido is off the scale lusting for older ugly convict.  (Who Knew?)  Convict kills lusting chick and then goes after Twit.  Apparently Twit also has werewolf blood in her veins (surprise) and she gets revenge on older convict.

If anything, it's the perfect movie to watch with a bunch of friends or when alcohol is involved, because there are plenty of WTF moments that'll provide some laughs.
