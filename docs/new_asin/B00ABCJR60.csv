5408874,5,B00ABCJR60,I stumbled across this documentary by accident. I wish I could show it to the world! There is a reason why piracy is happening in Somalia and this documentary does a magnificent job of explaining why. This is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen. Please watch ASAP!,1359331200,6,275,4.52
5408875,5,B00ABCJR60,"I was lucky enough to see this movie at a film festival, and -- woah.  It's one of the most exciting documentaries I've every seen... I walked away reminded that truth is always stranger than fiction.",1359331200,,200,4.555555555555555
5408876,5,B00ABCJR60,"I saw this Documentary in the Theaters in NY  and loved it. Unlike the fictional renditions of piracy in Hollywood movies or the sensationalizing of Somali Piracy by the press - this documentary takes you on a REAL ship, held by REAL pirates in Somalia.",1359331200,5,253,4.622222222222222

8549771,5,B00ABCJR60,"What an incredible documentary.  So many perspectives. I've seen hundreds of documentaries in my life, and my gut tells me this is in the top 20.

It's a shame an independent fictional movie (A Hijacking) about Somali piracy has more reviews than Stolen Seas,  and of course a shame the big budget Hollywood movie - Captain Philips - has gotten more attention, yet so few people watch documentaries like this.

An interesting intersection/contrast in this doc is the fact that Denmark, country of origin, for the ship operator/owner, shows up as the #1 least corrupt nation (Most honest) in the world per Transparency Int'l and Somalia, shows up at the bottom. An irony in this observation for me is that the ship CEC Future, is/was registered in the Bahamas to most likely ""avoid some Danish laws / restrictions."" Without knowing further details, that seems kind of 'corrupt' to me.

Another irony, which I don't know if it was intentional or not, was the interview with the wife of a Filipino held hostage on another ship. She's of course sad, yet at the same time keeps some beautiful birds captive in a little cage at home. Birds don't equal humans, but it's the idea...

This documentary is full of ironies from government, military,  to private enterprise. Hypocrisy all around when it comes to money/power. Until that fundamental part of huMAN nature is solved, the tragedy of Somalia and all things related will continue. The last irony I mention is that the solution to human hypocrisy is rooted in a way of thinking that is central to Denmark...but that is another story for another time.

Note: To producers/authors, I had my library system order this, they ended up ordering 4 copies.",1429574400,,1696,4.844290657439446
8549772,5,B00ABCJR60,Well-researched and well-paced. The documentary tells an important story about the lives of contemporary pirates and their victims. It's compelling because the story is true. Expert commentaries add to the authencity.,1388793600,,217,6.032258064516129
8549773,5,B00ABCJR60,"Stolen seas was able to get every side of the story in one picture. It enables the viewer to observe the POV of the hijackers, their country, then the POV of the mediator, the point of view of the company involved, third parties(experts in history and in piracy from around the world) and last but not least It involves the viewer emotionally in the story.",1382832000,3,356,4.492307692307692
8549774,5,B00ABCJR60,"This documentary examines the background and immediate causes of piracy of the Horn of Africa in the second decade of the 21st century. The format is a chronicling of the on-going and difficult negotiations involved in several notorious cases of brigandage in this part of the world. What the filmmaker Payne discovers in making this film is that this whole geopolitical drama really comes down to a matter of economics. For the past ten years or so, Somalian pirates have seized numerous oil tankers, cargo ships, and yachts in an effort to extort millions of dollars in ransoms. To achieve a balanced view of this very agravating situation that is apparently adding to the geopolitical tension in the region, the filmmaker connected with a number of the big players to hear their version of events. What he learned might surprise you as to the true nature of this issue? The ship owners back in Denmark, the Somalian pirates, the unfortunate tourists, the taxpayer and the warlords all have interesting tales to relate which, when pieced together, offer a somewhat different perspective than the one the western media is pushing: that the pirates are evil terrorists who should be brought to justice at any cost. One, shipowners have factored into their operating equation the cost-benefits of doing business with the `pirates'. Most of their ships sail under a flag of convenience which allows them to hire cheap labour to man them, so no big loss here. Two, the Somalians have been forced into adopting this way of life because fishing is no longer a viable livelihood. Since money is so desperately short in these coastal communities, piracy looks like a viable economic alternative, reaping over sixty million over the last while. The Al Qaeda connection does not seem to play a dominant role sofar in the operations. Arresting these pirates and putting them on trial doesn't seem to mitigate the problem. Three, the nations of the world have started to fight back by bringing in their navies to patrol the area and keep the pirates at bay. That strategy, according to Payne, is hardly cost effective, given the billions of dollars required to maintain a continuing presence there. In conclusion, perhaps the time has come for western nations to look at ways of going back into Somalia and helping the people get back to their traditional ways of life. To pull that off might, once again, not be economically smart because of the potentially enormous costs involved in a wholesale invasion of a very lawless country. So until the commerce of the world is truly threatened, maybe the status quo should be maintained. I noticed David Cameron, at the latest G-8 conference, calling for a ban on yielding to ransom and recovery demands.",1373241600,5,2738,4.928571428571429

8549776,5,B00ABCJR60,"Stolen Seas delivers all the excitement conjured up by the word ""pirate"" without displaying any of the childish pageantry that typifies the world of  fictional pirates. The life of a pirate, the life of dealing with pirates, and the experience of being taken by pirates (and hoping for the release of loved ones taken by pirates) are presented as sobering, agonizing, and unpredictable. From Denmark to Somaliland to Estonia to the Philippines, the film presents a real life intertwining of seemingly unrelated environments and existences  la Babel. It makes the point that piracy can neither be valorized nor treated as sheer predatory lawlessness, but rather is an inevitable response to the disregard and exploitation to which parts of the inhabited world are subjected. I don't want to go into more detail--watching as the film gradually pieces together these dynamic layers of history and geo-politics is quite exhilarating. Highly recommend!",1363219200,,947,5.348993288590604
8549777,5,B00ABCJR60,"Simply, I loved this movie.  The director does a great job of weaving a narrative (the negotiations surrounding the CEC Future) into the larger story of Piracy in the modern age.  He makes no excuses for the pirates nor the shipping industry or the first world.  It is a shared problem without a clear solution.  It is beautifully shot and wonderfully told.  I highly recommend.",1363046400,2,378,4.753846153846154
8549778,5,B00ABCJR60,"This is a great film that shows the real story behind piracy in Somalia. It's not what you'd think, and you'll learn a lot. THe filmmaker manages to film this in a way that is absolutely thrilling as well. He got amazing access and the story is incredibly compelling.",1361923200,2,267,4.469387755102041
8549779,5,B00ABCJR60,"This is an incredible film. The future of documentary filmmaking. The most multi-faceted, nuanced storytelling that tackles the issue from all sides. Each revelation leads to further revelations leaving you thinking about how interconected everythhing is. Besides interviews, the film contains documentary footage of actual pirates holding a ship hostage as well as an amazing shot of millions of dollars being dropped into the sea.",1359331200,2,432,5.661538461538462
