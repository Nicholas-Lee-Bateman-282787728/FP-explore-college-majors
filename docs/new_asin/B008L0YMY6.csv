$10,000 on the set up i could of gone myself but next time so if you see me rambling i really enjoy these programmes

5169003,4,B008L0YMY6,"Love the Smoky Mountains so I am letting you know up front I am going to be biased.  There is a dearth of high quality video of the Smokies out there so I jumped on this when available.  Overall the presentation is fine but could have been better with more shots of the actual mountains instead of ""Ranger Bob"" lifting logs looking for bugs.  The more educational material was good but I was hoping for more views of the beautiful mountains as well as some of the beautiful fall color the Smokies are famous for.

For the price is really is hard to complain however.  If you love the Smokies it's a no brainer.  If you have only a casual interest then you probably should knock a star or perhaps two off my rating.

Again, I love me some Smoky Mountains so I am just glad to finally have some HD material on the subject.",1358380800,14,820,4.251612903225807
5169004,1,B008L0YMY6,"This was a total waste of money. Poor production, inaccurate discriptions and a total lack of respect in regards to correct pronunciation of ""Appalachia"". It's app a latch a, not app a lay shun!",1357776000,,194,4.735294117647059
5169005,4,B008L0YMY6,"This is one of the most beautiful places on earth, and we are fortunate to have it as a National Park. I have been there several times and the film goes a good job of sharing the parks beauty. I would have preferred that more time was spent on shots of the mountains and streams and less time on the bugs and scientific parts.",1355961600,7,326,4.109375

5169007,5,B008L0YMY6,"Very well presented, good history information, photography is great.  I have all the National Parks Exploratin DVDs (8 to date), all are very good.  One problem: They leave you wanting more.
I'll continue to purchase and enjoy these.  Some (Everglases, Smoky Mountains) cover a park (and area) that don't get the coverage of the big parks.",1348358400,10,339,5.017857142857143

5169009,1,B008L0YMY6,"This blu-ray claims to be ""Virtual Tour"" but you'll only see interviews with Park Rangers, Biologists, and Pseudo Native Americans. You'll also see a second or two of video taken from an airplane. What you won't get is a tour of ""Over 500,00 acres of Breath-Taking Beauty"". Perhaps a cabin or two and a cemetary but no Grand Vistas. You'll see a salamander and some leaves but no beautiful sunrises or sunsets.

I take two photography based camping trips per year (Spring $ Fall) to the Smoky Mountains and was hoping to discover something in the video. My only discovery was that I had wasted my money.",1440892800,,603,4.635514018691588

5169019,2,B008L0YMY6,"I love the Smoky Mountains and I've been many times.  This video shows a lot of the beautiful landscape of the Smoky Mountains, but the photography and video-making is very amateur.  Many of the shots are overexposed and a lot of shaky camera, jerky zooms, incorrect lens, and graininess.  The narrator is difficult to understand at times and the video is way too long!  It's mostly a bunch of nature shots cut together.  It doesn't seem like the filmmakers had any real plan when they shot it.  It definitely isn't something you'd see on National Geographic or the History Channel.

On a positive note, the music is good and the video is relaxing.",1401321600,,648,4.68141592920354
5169020,5,B008L0YMY6,"Very nice picture quality. I recommend to anyone interested in national parks, like the Smoky's. I wanted a starting point for my future trip and this was a nice starting point.",1395100800,,177,4.741935483870968
5169021,5,B008L0YMY6,"Howdy;

If you don't include ""Eagle's View"" in the count, but as a guide, than this is the second in the series.  The first in the series is ""Acadia National Park"" and will be released on September 10, 2013.

This series is a great addition to any travel collection.  The video is clear, sharp and bright.  Shot in HD.  The narration is by Alphonse Keasley and is interesting and informative.  The music is by David Arkenstone which is ideal for this series.

The running time on this title is 76 minutes.

Hope this helps out.  Can't wait for 9/10/13 and the release of ""Acadia"" and ""Death Valley"".

5169022,3,B008L0YMY6,"This feature has some great shots of flora & fauna of the park. Unfortunately, these great shots seem to get recycled over and over again. While the music is nice, the narration is stilted and dull at times. There is some historical information presented, but as others have mentioned, we need to see more of the park than a ranger turning over logs. There is almost no information on the beautiful byway, just a few shots of cars lined up. The most interesting part to me was the author featured who showed some of the nice views from differing hikes. While filmed in high definition, this comes out as rather amateurish. PBS, History and Discovery do this far better. There is a reason the price is so low, so is the content quality. Just Okay.",1366502400,10,746,4.533333333333333
5169023,3,B008L0YMY6,"For the low price, this title is a great value. It's hard to argue with such a low price for a documentary about one of the country's most beautiful areas.

It's that value that makes this disc worth buying. If it were more expensive, I would say that there are better ways to spend your money. But since it's so cheap, I recommend picking it up and enjoying the scenery!",1366156800,3,371,4.3
5169024,5,B008L0YMY6,This is a must watch video about the Great Smoky Mountains.  This park is one of the few that you don't have to pay anything to enter or enjoy.  The video gives a great overview of the park.,1365033600,2,190,3.973684210526316

5169026,3,B008L0YMY6,"I thought I'd see more. The photography did not show a lot of the mountains.  When the Geologists, etc were interviewed, they talked and more was shown on the ground in the woods.
I did not see many people around with binoculars and cameras.  I've seen many Mountains and would have liked to have seen more photos, etc of the mountains and more color and beauty.

8528776,2,B008L0YMY6,"I agree with other reviews:  The documentary is dull.  I watched it once and donated it to Goodwill.

Pros:
- The ground-based videography is decent hi-def quality

Cons:
- All ground-based videography, if not shot from a tripod, is unstabilized and shaky, which makes the video seem amateurish.
- The helicopter-based videography is unstabilized.  Some video has a recognizable shudder in it.  Other helicopter-based video is quite shaky.
- The narrator could put a sugar-hyped kid to sleep.
- The narration is weird.  Long spans with no narration--just background music--and then the narrator pops in randomly.  ""Stilted"" and ""uneven"" are good descriptors.
- As the documentary talks about different topics--such as the geology of the park--the video is basically just wide panning shots.  The videography doesn't particularly focus on the given subject.",1522195200,,856,5.424242424242424
8528777,3,B008L0YMY6,"Interesting.  I have been to Asheville, NC, Skyline Drive and Caverns and a few other places near these magnificent mountains including Monticello. I have ridden in a car over them and drove part way once myself.  I only watched about half of this so far and it seems there is less variety then the places out west like Yosemite and Sequoia National Park.  One gets tired or repeated shots of beautiful light filtering through a canopy of green foliage and hearing how wonderful that is.  I was hoping to find places worth visiting that I have missed.  If I do I will be back to update this and maybe add a star.",1490832000,,612,4.428571428571429
