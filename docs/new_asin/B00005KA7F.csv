1618158,1,B00005KA7F,"The basic premise here is that an old circle of three high school friends is seperated when one of them (Jason Biggs) is torn away by a beautiful, yet demanding love of his life (Amanda Peet).  His two friends (Steve Zahn and Jack Black) do whatever is necessary to win back their old buddy, which twists and turns into silly acts of desperation.
My problem with this movie is that it uses uncreative extremes to get laughs.  For example, Zahn and Black's characters dig up the corpse of a young girl, then drive it off a cliff in Peet's car so it'll seem she is dead.  Now, I could see this being funny in a Mel Brooks film or something along the lines of slapstick, but here it just doesn't work.  All of the situations lack any sort of comical inspiration, thanks to a bad script and what seems like an undecisive director.
This also has the usual annoyingly simple and unfunny protagonist character with the strange and unusual friends.  The only problem is the normally funny friends are just annoying.  Jack Black's talent is completely wasted and he didn't get one laugh out of me.  Jason Biggs was good in ""American Pie,"" but since then he's fell flat.  His oogly-eyed character is annoying from the start and not brought to life at all.  Peet is gorgeous and actually does a sufficiant job with her character, who is stereotypical at best.  Zahn is the same character he's been from all his other films, except less funny.
To put it straight:  it's not funny, it's not creative, it's not inspiring, it's just not worth it.  Another on the long line of dwindled comedies inspired by the type of humor Adam Sandler is made famour for.",981763200,3,1641,4.54421768707483

No, the film is not a biography about his life, but one might think it is. His role, similar to what his actual life off screen might be a mirroring image of, is an overly enthusiastic post high school mascot alcoholic, recently fired from Subway, who is a wannabe musician in a Neil Diamond tribute band, a closet homosexual and doesn't realize it yet. His true identity or not, his role creates some serious laughs, and is played to perfection to fulfill and tripod of friendship, who will go to catastrophic lengths to stay best buds forever. The ""walkie talkie"" scene must be rewound several times and watched over and over again. A film with comedy ahead of it's time and truly an underrated movie.",1432944000,,826,4.587837837837838

And you'll be laughing throughout most of the movie!!!

Not a bad choice for a date night movie, if you're looking for comedy, but not a romantic comedy.

1618399,2,B00005KA7F,"Some films are just dumb and no matter how many gags they attempt to pull off they just can't seem to transcend dumb and become funny.  `Saving Silverman' is one of those kinds of films.  Whether you are watching the tamer PG-13 theatrical version or the raunchier R rated release, `Saving Silverman' doesn't know how to balance out the funny with the dumb to present something palatable.  The plot (which revolves around a sad sack searching for love in the wrong places) has been done and redone much better than here, and while Amanda Peet is a bombshell of epic proportions and actually understands humor far better than the film's main comedians (she completely steals every scene away from Jack Black and Steve Zahn), even she can't save this movie from the depths of stupidity.  Her presence is a welcome one though, and I admit to having watched solely for her in the end.  I've never really cared for Jason Biggs as an actor (not surprising to me that his career all but vanished into thin air) and so he was not a draw and he didn't disappoint since I didn't expect much (talk about another pigeonholed actor who regurgitates the same character for every film).  In the end there isn't much saving going on here, and while it certainly isn't without a few redeeming factors (Peet alone saves this from becoming a debacle of `Stealing Harvard' sized proportions) there really isn't much at all to get excited over.  It's just another one of those redundant excuses to milk teenagers of their parent's money.  How dare they compare this to `There's Something About Mary'!

1618401,5,B00005KA7F,"There's a reason why this movie continually resurfaces on television through the years.  It's a comic masterpiece.  The amazing thing is that the professional movie critics, as witnessed on rottentomatoes, rated the movie so poorly when it first came out.  Read Roger Eberts review as an example.

A movie gets to create its own universe.  In Saving Silverman, that universe contains a tongue-in-cheek possibility of violence which, due to the incompetence of the characters, is never really going to happen.  The girl gets kidnapped.  She's threatened with being shot.  She's not at all scared, and the characters aren't capable of pulling it off.  To call the movie mean spirited based on such scenes shows a lack of understanding of movie universes.  Okay, a football ref does get impaled.  Yet it's one of the funniest scenes of the movie because of the movie universe in which it occurs.

Another great example of violence turned topsy turvy for humorous effect.  The Amanda Peet character is dunking Jack Black's character in the toilet when the Steve Zahn character shocks her with a cattle prod or something.  We then get a toilet-eye's view of Jack Black's character churning up the toilet like an egg beater from the electrical charge.  Now that's funny.

Neal Diamond's role has been criticized, but it's an integral part of the masterpiece.  Participation in a Neal Diamond tribute band defines our male characters as losers.  Neal is making fun of himself.  That's funny!  His dialogues are riddled with cliches from his song lyrics:  ""Love on the rocks, ain't no surprise.""  ""Come on, Neal, turn on your heart light.""  That's funny!

And like any masterpiece, this one holds up over multiple viewings.

Hopefully those professional critics will some day admit their monumental error.",1296518400,3,1797,5.071917808219178

1618425,4,B00005KA7F,"Called ""Evil Woman"" on Region 2 in the UK and Europe, ""Saving Silverman"" is the kind of nerdy boy/girl gigglefest the Hollywood machine churns out for the Multiplex/Farrelly Brothers marketplace. So why should you bother? Because it's so much better than that! It really is!

From start to finish - this is consistently funny with 4 great leads working with genuinely witty one-liners and ball-breakingly funny scenes. The three boys all went on to be huge of course, and Amanda Peet has some fantastic lines as the controlling monster girl from Hell (including the title of this review). Throw in Neil Diamond in a fab cameo and you have a comedic peach that seems to have slipped through the net.

When I think of the number of films that I'm told are funny as opposed to this one that actually is - I wonder why it's gone unnoticed - or why someone decided to give it such a crap name and sleeve - especially here in the UK - both guaranteed to make you ignore it.

Hire it - or buy it for cheap - it's great fun. I highly recommend it as a wet-afternoon pick-me-up.

Jack Black is my new favorite guy to watch in comedies. I love him in Shallow Hal also.

Amanda Peet is excellent as the ""evil woman."" The way she keeps outwitting Black and Kahn is so fun to watch.

The weak links are Jason Biggs and Amanda Wheeler. I remember Biggs from when he was on the soap opera As The World Turns. He couldn't act then either, but at least he's bearable here. Amanda Wheeler's character is just too sweet to be interesting; but, I understand it was necessary considering she was about to become a nun.

The events of Saving Silverman could never happen in real life: two Neil Diamond fanatics kidnap their best friends' girlfriend and try to hook him up with an ex all because she is controlling and mean? Nope. Would never happen.",1156896000,,983,4.4748603351955305

This movie was recommended to me by my great friend Bobby Asslong, who's recommendations are usually quite odd, and contrived, but this time, he hit the mark right on!

Jack Black and Steve Zahn are absolutely hilarious, and Jason Biggs plays the straight one, in the title role.  I personally didn't think Jason did as good a job as he could have done, but that's just my opinion.  I personally don't care for Jason's acting.

The set-ups in this movie are priceless, and I actually really got turned on by Amanda Peet, when she was working to get un-handcuffed by the Steve Zahn character.  Friggin awesome!

Watching this movie reminds me of a very good friend of mine, named Ronald Freidman.  He is actually more P  WHIPPED than the Jason Biggs character in this movie!  His wife, Jacquelina,  rides him HARD and puts him away WET every singly day of the week, as she gambles away her savings at a nearby Indian Casino, 3 and 4 times per week.  I actually saw her slap him with a lot of force at a recent party.  What a lousy life she makes for him!  I think my boy Bobby A and I should make a movie called:  Saving Freidman!

1618454,4,B00005KA7F,"Whether it's watching network news or playin' ""Pull My Finger,"" it doesn't take much to make me laugh.  More importantly, hit me between the eyes with ribald, sophomoric humor--humor as meaningful as a clown reading Shakespeare--and I'm good to go.  Don't give me Woody Allen; give me Cheech & Chong and a box of pizza rolls.

Which is why SAVING SILVERMAN floats my boat.  This flick has a stupid story (a triumvirate of buds torn apart by the girlfriend from Hades, and the steps taken by the two friends on the outside looking in to bust up the romance), over-the-top antics, goofy shtick, and a healthy dose of cornball.  But it's darn funny, and as unpretentious as a mongrel using a fire hydrant.  This movie reminds me of the best way to ride a rollercoaster:  just let go and have fun.

Jason Biggs is okay as the nerdy and whipped friend who must be ""saved"" (probably not much of an acting stretch for him), yet Steve Zahn and Jack Black are superb as the two mentally-challenged buds doing the saving.  These guys make a great comedic team; they ought to hook up again in another movie.  But as good as Zahn and Black are, Amanda Peet steals the show as the straight-faced, ball-busting girlfriend who won't give up her man under any circumstances (and some circumstances in this film are considerable).  As mentioned above, SAVING SILVERMAN doesn't garner any blueblood points, but it serves up blue collar humor in spades.

The critics may have thought this film sucked, but in my opinion, this is definitely a hilarious film, and is destined to become a cult classic soon. I prefer the PG-13 rated version of the film, because the added Subway scene didn't add anything to the film. If anything, the R rated cut took away one of my favorite lines in the movie: ""Die, replacement friends!"" and replaced it with, ""F--- you, replacement friends!"".

Now they must try and undo what they themselves helped set up.  Along the way, they get into all sorts of trouble resulting in a great comedy!

Jason Biggs, Jack Black, Amanda Peet and Amanda Detmer (both of whom are ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS!!!), and the rest of the cast, have outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!

On the negative side, the Neil Diamond element, with the singer himself appearing in the film, was a poor choice; not that interesting and not that funny.

Saving Silverman is simple enough, nevertheless, it is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs.

Strongly recommended for an evening's entertainment along with Road Trip, Old School, the Girl Next Door and of course (!!!) the American Pie trilogy.",1106352000,6,1150,4.836734693877551

The formula is usually simple, funny plot, sophormoric humor to drive the plot, and characters that most people seem able to identify on some level, either personally or associating them with an annoying socially challenged friend.  Of course, having Jack Black in the credits usually helps.

I've enjoyed films such as Old School, Road Trip, the first two installments of American Pie, Van Wilder, Orange County, et cetera.  I would give these films 4 and 5 star ratings as they set out to do what we expect.  Saving Silverman is hardly worth the $11 I spent purchasing it at the mall.  Brief moments that illicited a chuckle, complete failure to generate a laughing response or any real interest in the story.

At least I found some of Amanda Peet's outfits to be interesting, and in this R-rated version of the film there is some gratuitous nudity, which add some value, alas, it's not enough to save this film.",1105401600,,1000,4.847058823529411

I've actually run across a few movie fans that ask about that. 'Saving Silverman', in my opinion has to be one of the better comedy movies of 2001. Please ignore all them fancy-shmancy big-time critic reviews. This flick rocks!! In a sense, the three main characters are sort of like a modern day Three Stooges, set in a movie version of the old 'Woman Haters' short. Anyone remember that short? Darren Silverman (Jason Biggs) would be Larry, J. D. McNugent (Jack Black) would be Curly and Wayne (Steve Zahn) would be Moe. Oh, yeah Judith, the worldly / tough women to outwit (Amanda Peet) would be Daisy Mae. I've literally watched this movie at least a dozen times in the last year. My favorite scenes are:the three guy's major obsession with Neil Diamond (who appears late in the film) when Judith visits their home, insisting that the Neil Diamond concert setlist that's actually framed in their living room that it's simply a photocopy, when Judith falsely befriends J.D. (Jack Black) in their basement that he's really gay because he's never had a girlfriend and of course the wedding scene. Just overall, a great movie. Recommended.",1104451200,5,1324,4.888888888888889

Wayne and J.D. hook Darren up with her and right off everything goes wrong for the friendship. Judith is a controlling psychiatrist who takes advantage of Darren and gets everything she wants. She controls what he eats, when he hangs with his friends and even torches his Neil Diamond album collection. It becomes J.D. and Wayne's mission to save their fried at all costs, even kidnapping Judith and faking her death.

This movie gets quite a bit of bad reviews on Amazon so I take it not everybody finds this movie as hilarious as I do. Sure, it is one of those teen comedies you have seen a million times but there is plenty to laugh at here, especially with Jack Black as J.D. It becomes a battle for Darren between Judith and Wayne/J.D. that cracks me up everytime. The things Darren has to go through(like agreeing to take Judith's last name when they get married) and Jack Black's dialogue are worth at least deeing this movie. Dont take it too seriously or else you probably won't finish the movie. The build-up towards the end involves Sandy coming back(but soon becoming a nun) and Darren is left to choose between love he knows is real and love he thinks is real.

First of all, you never really get the feeling that the friendship between these three friends is really very strong.  So when they start kidnapping and planning murder, you don't really understand why they're going to all the trouble.  Another thing is the obsession with Neil Diamond.  It's never really funny and it just falls flat.  Third, the chemistry between the supposed romantic interests is terrible.

1618580,5,B00005KA7F,"With all the 20 something comedies out there to choose from, Saving Silverman is a laugh riot from beginning to end to beat all the others.

Darren Silverman, played by Jason Biggs of American Pie fame, is adorable here as a sensitive guy who believes his one and only love Sandy (Amanda Detmer)was the answer until she went off and joined the family freak show at the circus.  Darren has two best friends.  There is Wayne the exterminator known as ""Cowboy Wayne"", in a really likeable role played by Steve Zahn.  Then there is JD, the slovenly Jack Black more recently known as Shallow Hal.  The three have been friends since public school, and even formed a Neil Diamond cover band as a tribute to their hero.  In fact, the cameo appearances of Neil Diamond himself are wonderfully peppered all over the film, which is something you don't see too often.

All is well until Darren gets depressed that his heartlight will never be turned on again after being rejected by a mime-dating girl post concert.  While sitting at a bar, JD and Wayne spy Judith (Amanda Peet) sauntering into the bar. After rejecting Waynes approach Darren is forced to say hello by Wayne who lies and tells Darren that Judith wants to meet him.  After being rejected also, Judith changes her mind when a far more repulsive male tries to pick her up.  They start to date, and Judith takes over everything about Darren, even the shape of his behind!

Amanda Peet plays this role superbly as the cold and calculating control freak who takes over Darrens life.  He is the puppet, and she, the puppet master as she tells Wayne and JD who try to reason her away from Darren.  After all, they are losing their best friend, AND THE BAND!  Yes, no more Neil for Darren, and no more Wayne or JD as Judith tries to see to it.

After seeing their friend slipping away, Wayne gets the idea to Kidnap Judith and fake her death to get Darren back to normal, and maybe fix him up with Sandy who they try to reunite him with his one and only true love.  How does this all go?  For a truly hilarious non-stop entertaining film, you need to watch for yourself.

This is a superb ensemble cast and they work perfectly together.  The dialogue is sharp and witty, and the slapstick foibles are side-splittingly funny.  Amanda Peet cannnot be beat as the Martial Arts expert girlfriend from hell, Zahn as Wayne and Black as JD make a great team in their united effort to ""save"" Darren from his current brainwashed by female oblivion.  Perhaps my favorite character is the Coach, played by R. Lee Ermey who I have a feeling, was NOT acting and playing himself!

Just a wonderful mixture of Stun guns, chains, nuns who pump iron, a brand new use for mail, and a real chemistry between Peet and Zahn in a surpsrisingly sexy but unfortunately fleeting scene where a chained Judith is being fed by Zahn, leading to some unrequited passion that leaves you wanting more.

All these fine comic moments,  make Saving Silverman one of the finest comedies that I have enjoyed more than any I have seen in a long time.  Don't miss it.",1058745600,7,3074,4.535390199637024

1618583,4,B00005KA7F,"This was an amiable and not that repulsive comedy about two friends who try to save one of their own from marriage.  JD (Jack Black) and Wayne (Steve Zahn) have nothing against marriage, but their bud Silverman (Jason Biggs) is to be hitched to the beautiful and evil Judith Fessbeggler (Amanda Peet).  Judith (don't call her Judy) is an intelligent and ascerbic psychologist and a major control freak.  Though once lusting after powerful and assertive men (I won't spoil the scene which changed her tune) Amanda sets her sights on men she can dominate - and Silverman is like a hand-puppet to her.  When Judith and Silverman decide to hitch (he'll take her name) she moves to quickly cut him off from Wayne and JD - losers who've progressed little since high-school (Wayne is works in pest control, though JD seems to be barely employed and spends most of the day noshing cheetos on the oversized dump they share; because Silverman is the least repulsive of the three of them, he is like their link to the outside world, and the only one willing to sing well for their horrible band).  When they by chance run into Sandy Percus (Amanda Detmer), Silverman's high-school sweetheart, they hatch a plan to secretly secrete Judith and replace her in Silverman's affections with the sweet Sandy.  Time is running out though - with Sandy in line to become a nun.  Meanwhile, hidden away in JD and Wayne's basement, Judith manages to be all too able to turn the tables on her captors - proving to be worse than JD and Wayne's assessment of her as Darth Vader (with a better body).
This was a raucous comedy, but not that hysterical and not anywhere near as offensive as it makes itself out.  Amanda Peet is excellent as the evil Judith while Steve Zahn and Jack Black are priceless as the losers Wayne and JD.  The flick even tosses in R. Lee Ermy as a cheerfully psychotic high-school coach (I'm only learning now how busy he's been since Vincent D'onofrio killed him in ""Full Metal Jacket"") and Neil Diamond as...himself.  If the flick fails at anything, it fails to prove how smart it could be despite its raucosness (like ""Something About Mary"" which was a grossout with no shortage of surprises).  The flick builds up the relationship between Sandy and Silverman, but it's lame.  There's also a brimming relationship between Wayne and Judith, but that doesn't rise above the running gag of the flick until the last few minutes.

The two clowns pull all kinds of outrageous stunts and schemes to get the couple to split up, but it is done in a style that makes ""There's Something About Mary"" appear to be Shakespeare in comparison.

This movie is extremely hilarious.  I give Jack Black and the others 5 stars in their performance. The story line is pathetic, but the actors humor and improves totally make up for everything else.

Two morons are afraid their best friend is engaged to a psychotic harpy who wants nothing more than to treat him like a puppet...and they're right. The funny thing is, they decide that it'd be best to kidnap her, fake her death, and hook him up witha girl he had a crush on in high school who is currently in the process of becoming a nun.  Like I said, stupid. BUT, its funny. I laughed...at this one.  This movie definately isn't for everyone, but if you liked movies such as ""Dude, Where's my Car?"" (probably the dumbest of the dumb), ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"" (very dumb when ya get right down to it, but at the same time smarter than most...does that make sense?) or ""Schindler's List"" (okay, so that last one doesn't really belong with those others, but I couldn't think of any other stupid movies, so I thought I'd switch things up a little bit and put in a really good movie for the helluva it), then you'll love Saving Silverman!",1015545600,2,1112,4.367149758454106

I moved to England before it came out in theatres, so I had to wait until last Nov when I was home visiting my family.

What a let down!  This is one of those situations where they showed all the funny bits in the preview.  This movie couldn't be more not funny if it tried.  It's saddens me cause I really like all the actors in it.  Don't waste your time or money because this movie is awful.

1618677,1,B00005KA7F,"If there is a genuinely funny moment in ""Saving Silverman,"" it is buried so deep that one would need to conduct a full-scale archaeological dig to ferret it out.  Not content with merely embarrassing its likable, youthful cast - Jason Biggs, Steve Zahn, Jack Black and Amanda Peet among others - the film finds it necessary to humiliate Neil Diamond as well, since the story revolves around a trio of boyhood chums so socially backward that they think it's ""cool"" to play in a band that covers old Diamond standards while decked out in early-70's regalia.  Diamond, for reasons unbeknownst to the rest of us, shows up in the film's later stretches to make a complete and utter fool of himself.
Not that the rest of the cast fares much better.  The plot is basically a hodgepodge of laboriously contrived comic situations strung together in a haphazard fashion, with each one falling flatter than the one that came before.  Neither the verbal nor the physical humor works in the slightest.  R. Lee Ermey, as the boys' psychotic coach, offers promise early on that his character will actually manage to elicit some laughs from the viewer, but he is soon reduced to the kind of over-the-top buffoonish caricature that kills all hope of comic effectiveness.  And so it goes with the rest of the film.  Director Dennis Dugan simply lacks the kind of discipline necessary to keep this sort of manic comedy under control - and writers Greg DePaul and Hank Nelken have given him precious little of quality to work with.
Put bluntly, ""Saving Silverman"" is one of the worst, most utterly painful movie comedies to come along in many years.",1012867200,6,1629,4.775800711743773

My friend Mike pointed out once that a comedy is supposed to make you laugh almost constantly throughout, and I laughed almost constantly for the first two-thirds of the movie, then the movie lost some of its momentum. Most so-called comedies (per my friend Mike again) are lucky enough to make you laugh twice or three times throughout their entire hour and a half.

Jack Black (High Fidelity) is usually a funny actor but he is handicapped by some of the worst dialogue material in his career. The movie's lone shining moment was the performance of Amanda Peet...her facial expressions and icy dialogue were perfect for her role.

They hook up and it soon becomes apparent that she is a psycho and treats Darren horribly. Wayne and JD can't stand seeing Darren so miserable, so they take it upon themselves to save him. They do anything and everything they can to break up Darren and Judith.
My Opinion:  The trailer looked so promising and Jack Black was so great in High Fidelity that I really had high hopes for Saving Silverman. They were completely dashed by the stupidity of the movie. The basic premise is fine, two geeks saving a third from a psycho ..., but all the ""funny"" scenes and situations that they came up with for SS are just weak and stupid. All the best parts were shown in the trailer as is the current trend with movies lately. This could have been a good comedy on par with Something About Mary and Meet the Parents, one that appealed to both people who like stupid movies and people with brains. But they kept it stupid and those with brains are the ones who will have to suffer unless of course they heed the warning: To Heck With Silverman, Save Yourself!!

""Joe Dirt"" pretty much got some of the worst reviews from critics all around, and ""Nutty Professor 2"" also wasn't a favorite as well.  Well, there was one funny film that critics hated, but I thought was outrageous and hysterical.  That movie would be ""Saving Silverman"".
Meet Darren Silverman; a lonely, and desperate romantic who never catches a break when it comes to women.  His one and only true love Sandy had moved away a long time ago, and since then he has feared that he will be alone forever.  The only thing he has are his two best buddies, Wayne and J.D., who are more than hopeless geeks.  Everything changes when Darren meets Judith; a cold-hearted woman who wants to prey on a man she can control.  Soon, the two start to go out, and Judith demands that Darren shall no longer be associated with J.D. and Wayne.
Well, the two friends are not going to surrender and see their pal, Darren, throw his life away so he can be controlled by a psychotic woman who J.D. refers to her as ""Hannibal Lecture"".  They decide to kidnap Judith so they can have their buddy back.  And that's when all of the laughs and chaos starts to come at you like an out of control train.

Many reviewers elsewhere have derided its lack of character development, its ""cruelty"", its appeal to the lowest common denominator etc etc.  Well pleeeease! Could these people get a life!
The plot, such as it is, has been well ventilated by now.  Three life long buddies; losers all.  Enter scheming, manipulative seductress who steals Silverman away.  Cue the ridiculously inept attempts by his friends to ""save him"".  Neil Diamond (who better?) saves the day.
Given this scenario, who needs or expects character development or sophisticated humour.  This film has a ludicrous plot, and it succeeds or fails on its commitment to its essential silliness.
Judged on these criteria, Saving Silverman is hilarious.  Jack Black and Steve Zahn are modern day incarnations of the old Three Stooges.  Every thing they do or say is invested with a physicality and natural comic timing that is unrivalled.  Peet is beautiful and really gets into the part of the unmitigated bitch.

Jason Biggs had his second consecutive bad role in this one and Amanda Peat didn't have a good role either.
