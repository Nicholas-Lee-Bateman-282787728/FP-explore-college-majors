It begins with ships in a port. London Bridge is in one background scene. Children see an object floating in the bay and throw stones at it. Its a dead man in a bag. Watch one man grab an item from another mans jacket! The automobile says the early twentieth century. [Note the dubbing of voices, the lips do not match the words.] Outside a man calls for help! Dr. Watson left his bag in his car. Holmes appears, then reads the shipping column. Moriarity is interested in ships from Benghazi. The Times has useful information. Theres another man outside. Jenkins says one word then dies! The Police Inspector lectures Holmes on the need for proper legal procedure. Watson deciphers Jenkins last words. The Hare and the Eagle is a public house.

Young woman talk to customers so they order drinks. Dr. Watson offers help to a bar girl. We learn about the man who fell overboard. You can listen to a conversation from a chimney top (as long as you are quiet). What does Moriarity want? A card catalog keeps track of newspaper volumes. They report on a missing treasure. In a country estate Peter Blackburn fires his shotgun. What is he afraid of? He trusts no one. A man with a gun cuts a glass window to enter a house. There is a struggle, then we hear gun shots. A dog barks in the night. A telephone call summons the police. What is buried in the lawn? The police will block all the roads. Sherlock deduced what happened. Will the wrong man be accused? The Inspector finds buried clothes (no moat). [No blood spatter evidence?] The hands of a dead man identify him as a working man. Will Mrs. Blackburn tell what really happened? They go to a secret room, Peter is dead! They find the letters MOR. Who has that valuable jewelry case with Cleopatras Necklace?

We see automobiles from the early 20th century on the streets. There is a slight accident with Dr. Watsons car. A diversion? A disguised Holmes visits a large house using a key. It has antique treasures. Is it guarded? Yes! Homes acquires that jewel case and departs. Moriarity returns to his house and discovers the intrusion. The Times reports the found necklace. Moriarity has a penalty for failure. He visits the police, then offers a police search of his home, then leaves. Later Holmes gets an offer for a deal; it is refused. A whistle causes those men to flee. There is a scene in the Hare and Eagle. Moriaritys chauffeur seeks two men for a job. He sees one man and offers him a job. Can that necklace be stolen from police custody? We see how this is accomplished, and foiled by Sherlock Holmes. People gather at that auction house. Where is that jewelry case? A postman delivers it! Is it authentic? Professor Moriarity validates it. Alls well that ends well. Homes tells about a gang of jewel thieves who were caught. And what of Moriarity? Come along Watson, we have work to do. [Why does Moriarity escape? To provide his reappearance in a sequel.]

This story was filmed by a German movie company. The screenplay was written by Curt Siodmak, famous for many of the Hollywood Horror movies in the 1930s and 1940s. He invented many of the details of the legends (garlic against vampires, silver bullets against werewolves). You will recognize parts from the many Sherlock Holmes stories in this movie: the stolen treasure (The Sign of the Four), the murdered man without a face (The Valley of Fear). Aside from the TV episodes produced in 1950s France with Ronald Howard, it is unusual to see a Sherlock Holmes movie made outside of England. Note the different in culture (the scenes in the public house).",1418083200,,3655,4.609831029185868
