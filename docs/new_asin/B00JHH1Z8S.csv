6358390,3,B00JHH1Z8S,"1.) 2 out of 3 Falls WWE Tag Team Championship Match: The Usos (c) vs Luke Harper and Erick Rowan
Awesome match, the first two falls were okay. But the last fall was just all over the place. So many near falls, and both teams looked great. 4/5

2.) Divas Championship: AJ Lee vs. Paige
This was a okay match, but it could of have been way better. There match hopefully at summerslam will be better. 2/5

3.) Jack Swagger vs. Rusev
This was a good match not great, but it was booked well. This is a good storyline. 3/5

4.) Seth Rollins vs. Dean Ambrose
I'm glad this match didn't happen, it was cool stuff backstage. People now want to see this match more. N/A

5. Chris Jericho vs. Bray Wyatt
This was a good match, but I could of been way better. Jericho going over was the right decision. 3/5

6. I.C Title Battle Royal
This was a fun battle royal, kofi had his spots. Miz winning was right. 3/5

7. Fatal 4 Way for WWE World Title: John Cena vs. Roman Reigns vs. Randy Orton vs. Kane
Good match, but we all knew who was going to win. The ending got really exciting. 3/5

Overall Show: This was fun show, but some things could have been better. Awesome opener and fun battle royal.",1405900800,,1184,4.212389380530974
6358391,3,B00JHH1Z8S,"The Tag Team title match (2/3 Falls) between The Usos(Jimmy & Jey) against Luke Harper & Erick Rowan was a awesome back-and-forth,hard-hitting bout. The Divas title match between AJ Lee & Paige was not great but good. The Jack Swagger-Rusev match was slow but solid. The Chris Jericho-Bray Wyatt match was disappointing considering who was in said bout. It was slow and the crowd had a hard time getting into it. The 20 man battle royal for the Intercontinental title was entertaining and fun mainly because Kofi Kingston's stunts with a twist ending to boot. The 4 way WWE Worlds title match(John Cena vs Randy Orton vs Kane vs Roman Reigns) was also not great but pretty good. I give this PPV a 6 out of 10. PS The Seth Rollins-Dean Ambrose match never happened because Dean attacked Seth before the bout and got kicked out of the arena by COO Triple H.",1405900800,2,855,4.594771241830065

6358393,4,B00JHH1Z8S,"1.) 2 out of 3 Falls WWE Tag Team Championship Match: The Usos (c) vs Luke Harper and Erick Rowan

Amazing opener from these two teams and a 2/3 Falls match nonetheless! A nice variety of moves displayed from both teams in this match with a lot of back and forth action that the match looked to be in both teams' favor on several occasions. Harper and Rowan get the first fall and The Usos get the next 2 to retain their titles. If you're a fan who longs for old school, exhilarating Tag Team action, you'll love this match. The Usos and Harper and Rowan are 2 of the best teams to happen to the modern Tag Team division

2.) Diva's Championship Match: Paige vs AJ Lee (c)

The storyline between these 2 has been great so far. Paige beats AJ the night after Wrestlemania for the title and then AJ returns a month before and defeats Paige to win back the title, doing an unofficial double turn in the process with AJ turning face and Paige supposedly going heel or at least tweener. And finally both of these fine ladies got a decent amount of time to show off. Paige stays in control on AJ in the beginning, wearing her down with submissions. Things get interesting near the end and AJ sneaks in a Shining Wizard to retain the title and escape with the title. It wasn't as great as it could've been but it was decent. Looking forward to seeing this story develop more

3.) Rusev w/Lana vs Jack Swagger w/Zeb Colter

Decent paced match here. The build-up between Rusev and Swagger was great but the match overall could've been a bit better. Rusev gets the win via countout to continue the feud as well as maintain Swagger's credibility as a babyface. This feud has potential to be a good one. Swagger and Rusev will need to work a bit more though for it to truly live up to it's expectation

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

4.) Seth Rollins vs Dean Ambrose

This match never happened after Ambrose attacked Rollins backstage and Triple H ordered Ambrose out of the arena. Rollins comes to the ring and demands them to announce him as the winner via forfeit. This leads to Ambrose sneaking back in the arena and attacking Rollins, leading to an amazing pier 6 brawl between the 2. It's unfortunate that fans were robbed out of what could've been match of the night. Hopefully a Street Fight or Steel Cage match at SummerSlam makes up for it

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

5.) Bray Wyatt vs Chris Jericho

If you watched their match they had on NXT in 2013, then you already know that this match was going to be a classic. And no doubt it was. Bray and Jericho mesh well together in the ring and they gave a great technical, showman performance. Jericho looked very impressive for his first PPV match in almost a year. Jericho is one of those people who could stop wrestling for 6 years, come back, and have no ring rust. Jericho gets the win with a Codebreaker on Bray. Great match with great in-ring psychology from 2 of the best, currently in the business

6.) Intercontinental Championship Battle Royal

The favorites for this match were obviously Sheamus, Dolph Ziggler, and Cesaro. Like most battle royals, it was really chaotic with a lot of the highly unlikely participants getting eliminated early in the match. There were some pretty fun and exciting spots throughout such as Kofi using Big E as a lift to get back in the ring. The most shocking part of the match had to probably be Heath Slater single handedly eliminating Cesaro. Ziggler last eliminates Sheamus and everyone, including myself suddenly thought he won. Then WWE pulled a troll and Miz (who was never eliminated) sneaks back in the ring and throws Ziggler over the top rope to win the Intercontinental Championship. Fun match to watch!

7.) Fatal 4 Way WWE World Heavyweight Championship Match: Randy Orton vs Kane vs Roman Reigns vs John Cena (c)

At first this match sounded like it'd be pretty awesome, considering that WWE doesn't really do anything but 1 on 1 matches for the World Title anymore. But the match said otherwise. While my pick was Kane, it was so blatantly obvious that John Cena would retain the championship. Considering that Reigns and Cena were the only 2 WWE bothered to make look strong going into this PPV, one of them was bound to win the title. Nearing the end of the match, it just becomes a signature/finisher fest, with each competitor hitting their signature and finisher on the other. In the end, Cena hits the AA on Orton onto Kane to retain the titles. This match would've been more fun to watch had all 4 men been booked strong in this feud but unfortunately it was relegated to being about Cena and Reigns while Orton just sat on the side and Kane looked like the underdog, as usual these days

Overall: Not a bad Battleground PPV this year. Head and shoulders better than 2013's Battleground. Every match had a great amount of build-up going into the PPV. Most of the matches weren't as good as they could've been, but I believe that's only to lead the way for even better rematches at SummerSlam. Battleground was by no means bad and anyone who says it is, is exaggerating. It comes off more as decent and allows for more build-up to lead to the next PPV. I'd give Battleground a chance to see some semi-good wrestling matches.",1405814400,5,5795,5.14468085106383

BATTLEGROUND

1.[TAG TITLE 2 OUT OF 3 FALLS]THE USOS VS LUKE HARPER AND ERICK ROWAN-I have really been enjoying the feud these two teams have been involved in. the action is great as it starts out but the Wyatts control most of it. This leads to the The Wyatts getting the first win by pin fall. The second fall happens not to long after with The Usos evening the score. From there the match just turns into a back and forth affair with great spots and great straight up wrestling. The match is very dramatic and there are plenty of near falls. The Usos end up retaining the titles in a hard fought battle. I will go on and say this is a classic, great opening match.

2.[DIVAS TITLE]AJ VS PAIGE-the second match on the PPV was for the Divas title. Now this was a good match but there were a few botched spots. Still it was a good match over all with AJ retaining the title in a nice back and forth match.

3. JACK SWAGGER VS RUSEV-I liked this match although I know some who didn't enjoy it as much. Rusev has been destroying people and Swagger comes in and brings the fight to him. Good back and forth match with each person controlling a portion. It looked as though Swagger was on his way to victory but he ends up counted out. Good match over all.

It was here that a match between Seth Rollins and Dean Ambrose was supposed to happen. But because of earlier events the match does not take place a brawl does break out between the two.

4. BRAY WYATT VS CHRIS JERICHO-one of the best matches on the card much like the other match involving Wyatts. These two work extremely well together and give us a great paced back and forth action filled affair. This is an excellent match in which it looks as if Bray has the match won when a codebreaker ends all of that. Y2J gets the win in a great match.

5.[I-C TITLE BATTLE ROYAL]-Bad News Barrett got injured so the Intercontinental Championship got put up for grabs in this battle royal. Anyway I love battle royals and have yet to see one that I didn't like [that I can remember] and this match is no exception. The action is everywhere as one would expect with great moments and eliminations. As others have pointed out there is the Cesaro elimination by Heath Slater who I think should have won the match and the title to be honest. Then of course there is Kofi staying in after jumping off of the ring, I think that should have been saved for the Royal Rumble personally. Still when The Miz ended up winning it I was with it, I am a fan of his so it was cool.

6.[WWE TITLE FATAL 4 WAY]JOHN CENA VS KANE VS RANDY ORTON VS ROMAN REIGNS-these fatal four ways are usually very fun so I had a feeling going in that it would be a good match. Things start strong for The Authority as Kane and Orton work well together taking it to the two faces. But after a while the team work breaks down and Reigns starts to look unstoppable. That of course leads into a big finish in which Cena retains his title. This was a good match over all that had some highlights. Personally I enjoyed it.

BONUS

1. ADAM ROSE VS FANDANGO-this match was all about Fandangos former ladies now being with Rose. This is a very short match that basically plays up what I previously mentioned. Entertaining enough and ok for the pre show.

2. NAOMI VS CAMERON-this match was all about former friends going at it which is a shame because I always loved watching them dance together. Still this was a pretty good match between the two with Cameron coming out on top.

For other special features we get post match interviews with The Usos, John Cena, and The Miz [his interview is funny]. That was all the title winners indeed. Over all this was a really good event full of fun matches.",1410480000,,3707,4.311781609195402

8650919,3,B00JHH1Z8S,"It should be noted that Dean Ambrose was scheduled to face his former Shield teammate Seth Rollins however the match was cancelled by Triple H after Ambrose was thrown out of the building for attacking Rollins during an interview setting up a series of events throughout the night where Ambrose & Rollins where brawling with each other at throughout the night around ringside & even outside of the arena.

2 Out Of 3 Falls Match: Tag Team Champions Usos vs. Wyatt Family - The Wyatts were able to get the first string of momentum when they were able to knock one of the Usos off balance & keep him grounded heavily working over the head before the Usos were able to start to using their momentum against them & going ""Uso Crazy"" with their aerial assault onto both members in & outside of the ring along with the Wyatt's showing some aerial ability of their own as both men traded momentum with both teams either countering each other's or delivering the same offense against each other with each time coming closer to winning the match after each pin attempt to the point where you saw the disbelief on their faces after the near fall and sequences of hitting hitting one big move after another. J.B.L. said it best, ""Someone call the sheriff, they just stole the show"" as this was an unbelievable high quality tag team encounter between both teams.

Divas Champion A.J. Lee vs. Paige - Both women started off very respectable with a handshake & clean with both getting early near falls on each other before Paige was able to take control working over A.J. in the corner & the ropes along with hitting some big moves like a sunset flip powerbomb while encouraging her to ""Come On A.J.!"" as A.J. was able to get in some offense but not truly build momentum as Paige was able to keep taking back control or counter her offense as it was a case of the match coming down to one woman being able to catch the other off guard. This was the best offensive exhibition I've seen Paige in since her debut but the match itself was more about continuing the story of this being a ""friendly rivalry"" with both women having their timing off at points.

Jack Swagger vs. Rusev - It should be noted that Lana gave her usual pro-Putin promo before the match but caused a bit of controversy & negative attention due to the bad timing of ""recent events"" as both men started fighting before the bell with Rusev relying on his power & grounding him with various nerve holds while Swagger got fired up by Zeb mounting a comeback with his own power offense along with focusing on the anklelock repeatably regardless of where they were in or outside of the ring. This was a solid match between both men.

Chris Jericho vs. Bray Wyatt - Both men went back & forth early slugging it out & choking each other on the ropes with a distraction worked in Bray's favor only to shortly work against him as they continued to trade momentum with each having a counter to the other's offense before one man getting knocked into the cameraman on the outside allowed room to build a series of momentum using impactful moves in the ring & on the apron resulting in a match that was evenly matched & competitive from start to finish.

Intercontinental Championship Battle Royal - Bad News Barrett made it clear that he had some ""bad news"" to give to the winner before the match as the various highlights include everyone targeting who they felt was the biggest threat, Dolph Ziggler's heavy amount of close calls, Kofi Kingston continuing his highlight reel of avoiding elimination, the strength of Cesaro, an ""Undertaker/Maven"" moment in regards to the most surprising elimination of the match, Sheamus hard fight to unify his U.S. Title, and when it got down to the ""final"" two.

WWE Champion John Cena vs. Roman Reigns vs. Randy Orton vs. Kane - This match started off with a bang as you saw brawling inside & outside of the ring with a body going into the ringside steps in the opening seconds as the match was non-stop action with various highlights such as if The Authority was on the same page, the obvious building tension between two of the competitors throughout the entire match before finally facing off, all four men at various points breaking up pins & trying to steal wins, a series of submissions that started off with a hold made famous from ""Calgary (drama pause) Alberta Canada"" and ended with one man preventing an opponent from tapping out, moments of various superstars domination over two or all three at the same time including one man putting another through the barricade & breaking a death grip that nobody previously has. This was a fun match full of non-stop action.

(Preshow) Adam Rose vs. Fandango - Adam Rose came out with both of Fandango's ex-girlfriends in Layla & Summer Rae in a quick match that was only here to continue the story between Fandango & the girls who were distractions for Fandango throughout the entire match.

(Preshow) Naomi vs. Cameron - The Funkadactyles finally fight each other one on one as Naomi came out ready to fight only for Cameron to attack when the referee was trying to back her away working over on the floor & stretching in the ring with a surfboard only for Naomi to come back beating her down inside & outside of the ring. This match was OK but I'll give them credit in that it did come off as two women fighting who had a grudge.

This was one of those events where no major developments happened with some results being very predictable so your not missing anything from that standpoint but did give us matches ranging from good to excellent (Tag Title Match) so it's an event I would check out if you either have a few bucks to spare.",1406505600,,5671,4.573818897637795
