5145896,5,B008ADHLEM,"`Wild is the Wind' was an unexpected delight for me.  I really wasn't sure what I was going to get.  I'm not entirely familiar with Anna Magnani as an actress, and while I have really liked Anthony Quinn I never truly got into his work.  That, and the fact that this is somewhat of a Western had me standoffish to say the least, but I wanted to see it for the mere fact that both Magnani and Quinn were up for Oscars in 1957, and their performances have been raved on every film site I frequent.

I love this movie.

Powerful in its sheer subtlety, `Wild is the Wind' tells the story about the conflicting worlds of two people drawn together by tragedy and convenience and the inability to compromise.  Gino is a widower who is still grieving the loss of his wife.  In an attempt to find a slice of normalcy and just move forward with his life, he marries his late wife's sister, Giola.  Giola is a very spirited woman who just wants to find someone who loves her deeply, but her persona is sharply contrasted by that of Gino, who is controlling and regimented and rough around his edges.  They clash, routinely, and their relationship begins to spiral further out as Giola catches the eye of Gino's ranch hand Bene.  Bene happens to be very close to Gino and is assumed to marry Gino's daughter Angie one day, but Bene has fallen in love with Giola and Giola with him.

With depth and restraint, Cukor directs this beautiful story with so much heart and authenticity.  The intricacies of marriage are given a sharp underlining as Cukor uncovers so many details that make this story in particular so engaging.  These two people are so different in their approach to life and love that they can't help but butt-heads but as Giola notes herself, the intentions are good.  They just don't understand one another, and sadly they are unwilling to meet each other half way.  I particularly loved the film's conclusion because, for me, it highlighted the beauty of love and companionship by allowing these two opposites to grasp the culpability that they themselves must account for, without devastating the core of the film in the process.

The performances by Magnani and Quinn are epic in themselves and really convey so much inner emotion and prove to be highlights of acting.  Magnani in particular is outstanding, and the complexity she brings to her character's emotional troubles is sensational.  Quinn dwells in his character with such bridled intensity and then explodes in his confrontation scene with dynamic energy.

For me, this is one of the best films of 1957, the same year that sported some true stunners.  It is an unexpected triumph, one that many may pass over with a mere shrug, but it should be seen.  Sadly, it's a hard film to get a hold of, but if you can snatch it up then I urge you to do so!",1346284800,9,2813,4.574850299401198
5145897,5,B008ADHLEM,"I had been looking for a video or DVD of the movie ""Wild is the Wind"" for years, and finally found it being offered here by seller ""cartagiron"" here on Amazon.  If you are an Anna Magnani fan, you must have this movie!  Her performance is electric.  Anna, Anthony Quinn & Anthony Franciose are all cast quite well.  Movies like this aren't made anymore.

My order arrived immediately after it was placed.  This seller also offers a large selection of foreign movies I'd never heard of.  If there is a movie you are having a hard time locating a movie classic, I suggest you look here. Great customer service- cartagiron! Thank you.",1342569600,7,631,4.580357142857143

5145905,5,B008ADHLEM,"I didn't know anything about this film and it turned out to be a very pleasant surprise. Anna Magnani is great, plays the part perfectly.

5145913,5,B008ADHLEM,"Anna Magnani (Giola) and Anthony Quinn (Gino) give a master class in acting in this film. Even if one does not thoroughly enjoy the plot, which is interesting in its complexity just watching Magnani & Quinn explore their characters with practiced finesse is well worth the price of a ticket. Quinn lost his Italian wife, marries her sister, (Magnani) and brings her to his ranch in Nevada. Exasperated, discouraged, & confused by Ginos entrenchment in his past, Giola turns to Ginos son, Bene (Anthony Francisoa). IMO: to elaborate would be to spoil your viewing experience. Enjoy your acting class!",1439683200,2,599,5.0606060606060606

5145916,5,B008ADHLEM,"Anna Magnani, there has never been such an actress. She lives the role of the total woman, Joanna, who marries her sister's widow and fights to keep her idenity in the process. The wealthy husband cannot release the memory of his deceased wife to allow the new wife into his heart. He looks upon the new wife as a replacement for his beloved first wife who lies buried on his land. Through circumstances of loneliness and need to be loved the new wife falls in love with the wealthy rancher's assistant. I found this film to be a wonderful love story of a wild Joanna, who wants to be loved and live life to the fullest. In the end, all fares well when the wealthy rancher realizes he loves his new wife and they vow to make the marriage work. I absolutely loved this movie and Anna Magnani is the movie. Other cast members are fine actors and complement her and make this a film not to be forgotten.",1430956800,,900,4.331360946745562

5145922,5,B008ADHLEM,"I saw Anna Magnani in the film of Tennessee Williams' ""The Rose Tattoo"".  I wanted to see more of her and found this 1957 film  directed by George Cukor, ""Wild is the Wind"". The film also stars Anthony Quinn.

This black and white film is set in rural Nevada in the 1950s.  Magnani plays a young Italian woman, Gioia, who has come to America to marry Gino, the widower of her sister.  Gino has become a prosperous rancher since the death of his wife. He is basically kind but thinks money buys everything. He still is in love with his first wife and unmercifully and tactlessly compares Gioia to her.  It makes for a stormy relationship, developed in the film.

Magnani's sultry, passionate, hot-blooded portrayal of Gioia is the main attraction of  this movie. Her acting is naturalistic, moving and convincing.  The film critic Robin Wood though ""Wild in the Wind"" Magnani's best film, surpassing even the Williams' films of ""The Rose Tattoo""  and ""The Fugitive Kind"". Magnani was nominated for an Academy Award for best actress and received the Berlin Festival Silver Bear Award for Best Actress.  Quinn also received an Academy Award nomination for his portrayal of Gino. Johnny Mathis sings the Academy Award winning title song, and Magnani herself sings an Italian folk song during a raucous birthday party.

The scenery, music and performance by Quinn make ""Wild in the Wind"" worth seeing, but it is Anna Magnani who makes the film special. I was pleased to have the opportunity to learn about and watch this film, which I didn't know before, here on Amazon.

As usual Anna Magnani is wonderful. She is a very expressive actress. This movie is about forbidden love.
I really liked this movie, it is worth seeing. Enjoy
Johnny Mathis sang theme songs for quite a few movies and this is one of them. Listen to him sing the theme at the beginning of the movie.",1399507200,,454,4.416666666666667
5145931,5,B008ADHLEM,Anna Magnani is probably the greatest film actor of the 20th Century. The story a genre Hollywood melodrama is made memorable by Magnani's talent.

5145932,5,B008ADHLEM,"Completely ""breathtaking"": with totally ""out-of-the-ballpark"" performances, writing, cinematography, directing: this is a TOTALLY MUST-SEE for devoted film-buffs (and these days, who isn't?).  So, considering all this, I have to ask: WHY OH WHY is this film so ""obscure""?  We were SO LUCKY to ""stumble"" on it thru Amazon Prime ""streaming"", and I must say: THANK YOU AMAZON for making available the BEST film I've ever seen!

And speaking of ""scene"" (no pun intended) the best of all time has to be the beautiful ""song & dance"" during the birthday party.

Greece had its Irene Pappas; Britain has its Maggie Smith, Judie Dench and Vanessa Redgrave; and Italy, Sophia Loren, Giullietta Masina, and Anna Magnani. And greatest among these is Anna Magnani!!!  Every line she utters is as if its origin is with her.  She enters the film as a frightened, out of place, mail order bride, knowing only a few words of English.  She struggles to adapt to a strange environment and a husband who is passionate,albeit boorish, who has taken her in the belief that she can be the carbon copy of his deceased wife.  His idea of giving is by giving things rather than the love she seeks.  He sees her as a possession, not as a wife or partner.  It is inappropriate to comment further on the plot, less it be spoiled for those reading this review; however, suffice it to say that the film ends with a realistic outcome acted by two of the finest performers ever to appear on the screen.",1374537600,12,985,4.531073446327683
