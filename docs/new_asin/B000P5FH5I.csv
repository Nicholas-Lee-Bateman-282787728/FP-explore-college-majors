2810538,5,B000P5FH5I,"When I received this DVD it was not wrapped in plastic. It made me wonder if it was a pirate DVD.  It seems to work Ok, but I was a little curious how it got sent out without being sealed.",1300320000,,188,3.7
2810539,4,B000P5FH5I,"good for the car etc, but i noticed most of the episodes on this dvd are on tv.  we dvr the tv show so we don't have to buy a huge collection of dvds, if she wants dora, we just play an episode we have on the dvr.  but this is good for her portable dvd, or the car....but don't expect a new adventure if your little one watches dora on Nick Jr.  Same old thing on the TV",1259625600,4,370,3.6582278481012658
2810540,5,B000P5FH5I,I purchased this video about one month ago. The video quality is very good and my kids love it. I would recommend this video to anyone whos kids are into Dora.,1201478400,4,159,4.161290322580645

WE ALL SCREAM FOR ICE CREAM: The ice cream truck has sped off, but Dora and Boots really want some ice cream! Help them on their delicious adventure to Coney Island.

MIXED-UP SEASONS: Dora and Boots love the beach in summer, but someone doesn't - snowman! Help Dora and Boots fix all four mixed-up seasons!

BEACHES: Dora and Boots need to cross crab-infested sand dunes and broken boardwalk to find Boots's floatie so he can swim in the ocean! Will you help?",1190764800,38,625,4.464912280701754
2810542,3,B000P5FH5I,"My one year old daughter loves Dora.  I can even go far out and say...my husband and I love Dora too.  Some parts are really funny and we can't help but laugh.  But this Dora was a disappointment.  The animation isn't that great and the story lines are tacky.  The episode with the Seasons was great I have to say.

Go buy the Dora Mermaids that was released Sept 25th...this is excellent.  Teaches kids about keeping their environment clean.

Another great teaching dvd guide is Fraggle Rock.  Season 1 is better than Season 2.  Great learning aid.",1190764800,3,549,4.56701030927835
