8324316,5,B000GAKMAW,"History is very much of interest to me as try to become more acquainted with pieces of history that I am not familiar.  It seems as time passes, what I have learned in the past has become fuzzy.  I like having references that I can restore sections of history that I should have remembered from my time in school.  Thanks for making this section of history available.",1398643200,,367,4.447761194029851
