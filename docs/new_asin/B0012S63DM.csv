8247619,3,B0012S63DM,"This is a Signal Corp training film.  It won't teach you Morse Code, but it will clue you in to the proper way to send with a hand key.  The instructor emphasizes adding ""swing"" to your cadence.  You'll also see the biggest Morse code hand key ever!  Very entertaining if you are a code fan.",1229558400,5,291,4.236363636363636
