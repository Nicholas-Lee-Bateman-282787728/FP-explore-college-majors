8163677,5,1928706266,"This is a very important film.  It's all about how a meditation practice can transform the entire atmosphere of a hugh, dangerous prison from the inside out.  A must-see for all meditators, prisoners and prison administrators.

I would also highly recommend it for any person incarcerated on international drug trafficking charges.  It is very sobering that people in India are arrested and wait in prison for 5 years to be tried for crimes that have a maximum sentence of only 2 years!",1397433600,,486,4.890243902439025
8163678,5,1928706266,"I attended my first 10-day Vipassana course taught by S.N. Goenka in the fall of 1991. On day 4 an ulcer I'd had for 20 years completely dissolved in about an hour; never to return. As the theme of the movie states, ""We're all  prisoners of our own mind"". This documentary makes this truth very clear, but as the prisoners in Tihar Prison come out of suffering, they take us deeper and teach us, that if they can calm their mind, and no longer be prisoners of their mind's constant chatter, there is hope and liberation awaiting all of us who are willing to work for it. Highly recommended!",1376092800,,590,4.412844036697248
8163679,5,1928706266,"this is an amazing documentary - however instead of paying the 99$ this dishonest reseller is asking for,  you can go to the pariyatti org bookstore and buy it for 5$.

i think this reseller needs to do a bit of vipassana to get in touch with his consciousness-  obviously they didn't watch the movie.",1307318400,9,301,4.4363636363636365
8163680,4,1928706266,"The story of how bringing meditation to India's largest prison
helped turn life around for many of it's inmates.  Hopeful, positive,
encouraging, and always interesting, I did enjoy it. I just wish it
hadn't tried to make it look so simple and easy.

As a practitioner of Vipassana meditation for many years, I know that
real change takes work and time, and sometimes the film
makes it feel a bit too much like a quick 'miracle cure'.

But it's wonderful to see a film about prison and reform that offers
real hope and new thinking, and it's well worth seeing if you have any interest
in any of the subject elements.",1301529600,7,616,4.531531531531532
8163681,5,1928706266,"This is a powerful and moving fifty-minute documentary about the transformation of India's largest prison when Vipassana meditation courses were introduced for prison staff and inmates in the 1990s. The film won awards from the San Francisco International Film Festival and the U.S. National Council on Crime and Delinquency.

It's also available on DVD (and in Spanish, French, and Mandarin) from a Buddhist bookstore called Pariyatti.",1180742400,10,436,5.606060606060606
8163682,4,1928706266,"A woman in India realized that containers of punishment do /not/ heal ones we are going to put back into our community, and that this could be changed, and that she was determined to /make/ that shift begin.

( I may have a couple of details wrong, it's been years since I saw it, but my memory's usually rather correct )

In the large prison where the program was introduced, a few chose to try this silent breathing-meditation, instead of being in the general-aggravation population.

I think the rules were that food would be brought-in ( so no-one would have to speak to coordinate food-preparation ), to help with the focus for the ones in the separate group.

One of the guys in the prison was, I think, English, and his interview is significant through the film. . .

Later, /only/ ones who have been in the program are allowed to volunteer for the ones /in/ the program. . .

The film shows how peace, from within, /real/ peace, can be grown among ones who are ""doing time"", and makes obvious that the /results/ of this are that a healthier human-being is released into our community, than the *beating-on* ""doing time"" that authority-assumption prefers.

Please note that I consider it sane to focus on the end-result ( re-integration ) rather-than to throw-away community re-integration in order to enforce a beating-on mode of punishment: segregation & deprivation of diversion & time & no-self-determination & possibly-life are enough.

Unlike many films about incarceration, it doesn't glorify authority-enforcement, it shows peace to be living-worth.",1178064000,3,1564,4.9655172413793105
