8051214,3,B0007TFIIS,"""Chill Out to the Music of Pink Floyd"" is an experience with benefits and drawbacks. The potential drawbacks are apparent. First, the unobservant consumer may miss that this DVD is entitled ""Chill Out to the Music of Pink Floyd"" rather than ""Chill Out to Pink Floyd."" This is because Pink Floyd does not perform on this -rather groups like Mostly Autumn, Barratt, Cirrus Minor and Crazy Diamond play the music of the Floyd. Second, the graphics are mediocre. David Rogers' animation is remarkably similar to those found in Windows Media Player. While most Floydians will be unable to move beyond these issues, I'd like to offer a balanced review. While the graphics may fit the mood of each song, they are weak by today's standards. For this reason, it may be best to just turn off the TV and enjoy the music. This works very well considering the beautifully separated surround sound audio editing. Compared to the graphics, the issue of the quality of music is far more complicated. I've always believed that a great tribute pays homage to the parent while simultaneously making a fresh interpretation. Unfortunately, most tributes phonographically copy the original band or fall embarrassingly short in the attempt. Here, most interpretations are painfully faithful. While the ones that stray a little from the original tend to be the most interesting, most tunes are performed very well. Depending on the listener, this sonic reproduction will be an asset or defect. Related to the issue of the quality of music is the song choice. The song choice is stellar. ""Chill Out to the Music of Pink Floyd"" doesn't play the same old post 1973 songs that we've all heard a million times on FM radio; rather it explores Floyd's earlier discography. 'Echoes,' 'Fat Old Sun,' 'Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun,' 'Atom Heart Mother' and 'Julia Dream' are performed. To give balance, 'Shine on You Crazy Diamond,' and 'Breathe' are also enjoyed. Typical listeners who don't know that Pink Floyd even released any albums before ""Dark Side of the Moon,"" will surely resent the setlist. Most viewers of this DVD will probably feel betrayed by false advertising, turned off by the graphics and disappointed with the music. That written, there is merit for those with an open mind and appreciation of Pink Floyd cover projects.",1184716800,2,2320,4.9512820512820515
8051215,1,B0007TFIIS,"Well, OK. We've all been duped by the title, including myself. I was pretty upset when I bought it and watched it. The music, although nice covers by other musicians, is not authentic Pink Floyd. That was seriously disappointing. However, since I own many Pink Floyd CDs, I had the idea of making a new CD with the songs on the playlist of the DVD in the same order. So now whenever I play the DVD, I simply watch it, but listen to the CD instead with the real Pink Floyd music. You just need to start both the CD and the DVD sort of at the same time and ... enjoy.",1164844800,2,565,4.053571428571429
8051216,1,B0007TFIIS,"I got this DVD as a gift.

Let me quote the back of the case for you:

""...interpretations of the music of PINK FLOYD performed by Mostly Autumn, Crazy Diamond, Cirrus Minor and Barratt.""

What the hell is that supposed to mean? Right on the cover it says MUSIC OF PINK FLOYD, but it sells you ripped off stuff from some guys that try to replicate Pink Floyd. Cheap marketing ploy.

Though the music sounds nice, if you're an extremely avid Pink Floyd fan like me, you'll find it annoying when the solos go astray from traditional Gilmour style, and when the lyrics are sometimes even absent.

Save your money. Get something authentic instead.",1145145600,3,643,4.605263157894737
8051217,1,B0007TFIIS,If you want to save yourself money just listen to pink floyd using either itunes or windows media player visuliser. gives the same effect! The music 'interpretations' are nothing special either. In all an all round dissapointment!,1133136000,5,230,5.243243243243243
8051218,4,B0007TFIIS,"Chill out is an appropriate title - I watched it last night and it put me right to sleep.  The animations reminded me of what you would see in Windows Media player, say, Battery Random (if you have ever watched that while listening to music). The first song, Echoes, made me think of Pink Floyd's own version as shown in ""Pink Floyd Live In Pompeii"", which set a tough standard to beat. If you have doubts, why not rent the DVD from Netflix first to see how you like it. I often do this, just yesterday for example, I ordered ""What The Bleep Do We Know?"" from Amazon after previewing it from Netflix. But I digress. If you like Pink Floyd's music, and want to really relax, this DVD will probably do it for you.",1118361600,7,711,4.266666666666667
