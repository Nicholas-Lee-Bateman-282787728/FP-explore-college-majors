Due to the limited time available in a TV documentary one must view many of the docs on Ruby Ridge to see all the footage and criminal actions that were perpetrated.
The American sheepeople should have descended on Washington DC (District of Criminals) after WACO. We did nothing, just look at the fix we are in today with the military controlling our local police, home land security in place to contain us, not keep the illegals out.
