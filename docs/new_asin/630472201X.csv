The Yankees had won with Mariano Rivera as rhe set-up man and John Wettland as the closer.  In 1997 Rivera took over the closer role and started to show signs of how great a closer he would become.  But in the final game with the Yanks ahead and Rivera in to close it out Sandy Alomar Jr. hit the game winning home run.

With Alomar and Thome and the tough hurdle to get to the series Cleveland looked like a sure thing ro win it.  But hear can the Marlins a team with money that had bought star players like Pudge Rodriguez.  They squeaked by their National League opponents and stuck it out with Cleveland until in the final game Edgar Renteria's dramatic home run pulled out the first World Championship for a Florida team.  This was a very exciting series with a very dramatic seventh game.  At the end of the season, the Marlin owner sold, traded away or lost to free agency the players that had been the core of their success.  So the record of the Marlins plummeted and it too several years to rebuild.  But in 2003 they were back in the Series and their new star Josh Beckett pitched them to a victory over the vaunted Yankees.",1207785600,36,1313,4.451882845188284

7876642,5,630472201X,"This is a very exciting video.  This video is so exciting that it makes you feel that you're watching the 1997 World Series all over again.  This video brought back the excitement that I felt when Renteria drove in that winning run in the 11th inning that made the Marlins world champions.  If you want to feel that excitement and exhilaration that you felt in 1997, I suggest you buy this video.  It is by far, the greatest baseball video I have ever seen!!!!",1006992000,2,460,4.440476190476191
