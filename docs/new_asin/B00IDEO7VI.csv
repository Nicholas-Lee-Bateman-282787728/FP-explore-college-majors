8641270,1,B00IDEO7VI,"I saw the video ""Sugar"" on iTunes , I thought he would be a romantic but up to date! The songs had dirty words and too much like the ones already out! We feel that he would gain more of an audience all ages
By using song of love not wild and crazy! We wish we could return the DVD as we did not get to hear his other songs on the DVD ! ""Song and action on video SUGAR"" was by far 5*********stars ! DVD yuck",1489017600,,406,3.67816091954023
