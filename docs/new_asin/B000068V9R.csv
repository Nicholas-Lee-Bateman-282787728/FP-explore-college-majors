1727493,5,B000068V9R,"I can't tell you how many times I've been looking over inferior Sci-Fi shows in the DVD section of the local movie store like Space 1999 and Stargate and wondered ""Why the h*** hasn't someone in marketing realized The Outer Limits should be on DVD? Finally!
I haven't reviewed this set yet, but it sounds like it only contains Season 1 of the show. Although this would leave out several great episodes like ""Soldier"" and ""Demon With a Glass Hand,"" it will contain about 10 gems. My personal favorites are ""Nightmare,"" about war games taken to the extreme; ""Fun and Games,"" a nice take on F. Brown's Arena short story; ""The Man Who Was Never Born,"" the true source of inspiration for the Terminator series; and ""The Architects of Fear,"" an attempt by scientists to create a common menace to unite mankind with tragic results.",1024358400,,824,4.689655172413793
1727494,5,B000068V9R,"The genius of this show was that it used the works of authors that are now universally recognized as the pillars of the Golden Age of science fiction. I'm sure I'm one of legions of tail-end Boomers that got their first introduction to SF from this show; I'm also sure it was the first step on the path to being an engineer working in aerospace and robotics. While other kids were out partying and getting in trouble weekend nights I was parked in front of the tube with a snack geeking out to the Limits. Props to Twilight Zone, of course, but the Limits? Fugeddaboutit... It's on the SF channel on a weekend night where I am; the other night the 9-year-old son of a friend stared raptly while I recited the entire spiel beginning with the white oscilloscope dot and the solemnly intoned ""There is nothing wrong with your televison set..."". Black and white, dim lighting, plywood sets with old cast-off instrumentation, rheostats, gauges with needles - incredibly camp now but man, it got the job done. Were I a professor at a film school I would use this DVD to demonstrate minimalist theory: the idea that a little goes a long way if you do not underestimate the imagination of your audience.",1024185600,2,1195,4.588785046728972

Although the producers lost most of their gray hair trying to overcome tightwad budget constraints, this series is the perfect companion and compliment to the less deadly and dreadful Twilight Zone.  Not quite the classic Rod Serling touch, but much more relevant to today's doomsday world.  Have fun, it may be you last chance to enjoy it as science fiction!",1024012800,,480,4.901234567901234
1727496,5,B000068V9R,"Although they didn't have the greatest special effects the stories presented in this show still have an impact today. My personal favorite is ""The Hundred Days of the Dragon"" I've been waiting FOREVER for this show to come to DVD. I just hope that the quality is good and that it has some actual bonus Material. I'd like to see the original TV spots for this show. The new series produced by showtime [is very bad]. This is the only outer limits worth viewing. But all in all I'm glad it's coming on DVD. Now if only they would release the DVD's of the original Star Wars trilogy...",1023753600,,582,4.398148148148148
1727497,5,B000068V9R,"While I can't say I've seen this DVD of The Outer Limits (obviously, since it's not released yet!) I can still take the time to write a review of the series, as I collected the entire 49 episodes (both seasons) on Beta many years ago. For anyone who mistakes this groundbreaking 60's series for the abysmal dreck presented in the new, updated version that started on Showtime and currently resides on Sci-Fi, well, do yourself a favor and check this DVD set out. While many have compared the show to the Twilight Zone, The Outer Limits was ultimately a much darker, scarier and deadly serious version of that show, and at an hour per episode, was like a series of mini-movies. The fact that the great cinematographer Conrad Hall (he of ""American Beauty"" fame) shot most of this series, in weird, darkened lighting and odd camera angles, using the inherent black-and-white to its greatest effect, itself raises this show to the level of motion picture-style entertainment; a show that Stephen King himself called 'the greatest show of its kind ever of television'. Like the T-Zone, the Limits also featured many of the best up-and-coming TV and movie stars of the time, including Robert Duvall, James Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, Cliff Robertson, Donald Pleasance and many more. 40 years after its debut, and these episodes show more imagination than any horror or sci-fi anthology I've seen since. I mean, really! A teacher from another planet who comes to Earth in lightning bolts, to instruct the highest-achieving students how to use a weather-changing machine to help destroy the world....Shatner, as an astronaut whose encounter with an alien while in space causes him to be unable to stay warm....aliens who transport an entire neighborhood up to their planet to experiment with the possibility of colonizing Earth.....a soldier from the future who comes back in time in search of his enemy (The Terminator, anyone??) - the shows were not just brilliant science-fiction, but just plain WEIRD, and certainly far ahead of their time.  Sure, some episodes come up short (like some of those hokey Twilight Zones), and anyone expecting anything more than rudimentary special effects might be disappointed,  but most of the shows remain a standard of the genre to which few, if any, have since met.",1023494400,15,2293,5.0
1727518,5,B000068V9R,this is the third and final volume of the full series. you won't find a better anthology science fiction series anywhere. very special for those nostalgic for the heyday of burgeoning scientific marvels of the 1960s. the updated remake of color versions of the 1990s doesnt hold a candle to these.,1496966400,,297,4.8431372549019605

1727520,5,B000068V9R,"I was about 10 when this show debuted, but I still managed to sneak out to our TV in the living room or at a friends house on overnight sleepovers to watch quite a few of the episodes.  I didn't see his name in any of the credits, but I think there was one with William Shatner also.  These shows scared me and fascinated me all at once so I watched a lot of the episodes with my fingers near my eyes so I could cover them quickly when it got too scary.  As I said I was 10.  I'm buying at least the first season maybe the second season too.  This show was a huge step above the Frankenstein and Dracula stories of the day.  As good, but a bit more frightening than Twilight Zone.  I Loved that program also. I was addicted to these shows even though at the time I didn't really look forward to sleeping alone after watching them.  So.. This recommendation is made by a scardy-cat who really loved the weird and unexplainable creatures and now well known and wonderful actors that presented their individual talents each week-end and kept us sleeping with the covers pulled over our heads for two wonderful years.  I will say the writing was as good as Star Trek TOS my all time favorite series. As I said I was 10 with outer limits, a bit older for Star Trek so consider the age differences, but I am still a huge fan of all three of these series and I have grand kids now.  Check it out if you admire really good story writing and acting.  The only other good TV of this genre at the time was the Alfred Hitchcock hour.  All splendid fun. I have always been a serious TV watcher, so I've pretty much seen all the really good television as well as the rediculously bad.  Today I am an avid reader and fiction writer.  I still love to watch a well put together story even if I have to write my own.  I really enjoy good television, so these days I have more time for writing, since there are so few enjoyable fictional programs available, if you get my drift?  I think we have now watched the twenty-four hour news cycles until we have nearly lost all sanity. I hope my opinion helps you in making up your mind to step into the ""Outer Limits"".",1496361600,,2143,4.202933985330073

On a very small budget, they did a decent job with special effects, with what they had to work with back then. Top rate actors, and good scripts. When watching these shows, you come to realize how much of the shows success is also the brilliant use of the music cues in each scene. Dominic Frontiere composed the music score and cues. It is an anthology show, with different stars every week. I was a little young to probably have watched it when it first came out, but watched it in reruns a few years later. I still enjoy it today. This first season was great, but unfortunately the series creator, Leslie Stevens, and the producer, Joseph Sefano, left the show after the first season. Dominic Frontiere left too. Without these great talents, the show faded fast, and the second season, only lasted for seventeen episodes.

1727628,3,B000068V9R,"I wasn't alive when these shows were originally aired. I grew up watching a lot of older black and white TV sitcoms in syndication, but had never seen this show. As a fan of the Twilight Zone series, I had heard about this series.

I found this set on sale for about $10 (mine has a different cover as well). I watched a number of episodes and felt happy enough with my purchase. I went back and purchased Volumes 2 and 3, also for about $10 each. Personally, I would not want to pay more for these. At $10, I could recommend it to anyone who's seen the show or who is a fan or who is just curious like I was. At the full price, I could only recommend them to true fans.

As I understand it, the original series ran for only 2 years, and the first season was stronger. These have all been previously released to DVD, at a higher price but with better packaging. These are double sided discs which can get scratched in their cases. For this DVD release, season one was split in half, to create Volumes 1 and 2. Volume 3 is season 2, which although weaker, has some ""classic"" episodes as well (according to the fans).

There are many episodes on each set, and some are decent and some are terrible. They're like mini sci-fi B-movies with laughable effects. However, some of the plots are good, you just have to use your imagination when watching these. I think the shows would have been better if they were only half hour in length; the Twilight Zone series (which is far superior) also had its weakest season when it changed from half hour to full hour shows.

If you're not sure, maybe just buy Volume 1 (on sale). If you like that, you can then go for Volume 2. Save Volume 3 for last, if you want it.",1456617600,,1702,4.243827160493828

Yes, they are very spooky, and unsettling.  Several that I remembered seeing originally have on this viewing raised goosebumps and on one tingling from upper back to shins and literally raising hair.  I am astonished how good these are.  The thought has occurred several times that this series might have been one of the very best I have ever seen.  The writing, camera work, lighting and above all the music is all astonishingly good..creating an atmosphere of dark foreboding that puts many of the most touted. big budget films I have seen over the last twenty years to shame.  Actors getting their first work here seem to me to be giving performances beyond what I remember from them later in their careers.  David Mc Callum, Martin Landau..even Robert Culp who I never thought was that great are superb here.

There are classic stories abounding in this series, with a plethora of present and future actors from the Entertainment industry. I find individual episodes well worth the cost! Of course, no comparison can truly be made to the Alien series or any modern day science fiction; rather, if you watched this in its day it was cutting edge, along with The Twilight Zone.  Very nice to see this again after over 50 years since seeing some episodes; the Outer Limits and space shots from Canaveral, those were outstanding memories of the early sixties!

1727798,5,B000068V9R,"It's like stepping back in time.  Granted by today's standards, the special effects were well, not good.  But at the time, when television was still very ""young"" (and so was I), these episodes sent chills down my spine.  My favorites were those that showed aliens and/or creatures.  I think it helped that I grew up in the cold war era when the threat of attack was very real (think Cuban Missile Crisis) and when Civil Defense drills were something we practiced at school and when sightings/reportings of UFOs seemed to occur very frequently.  It brings to mind John G. Fuller's book, 'The Exeter Incident' which I read in jr. high.  The possibility of seeing a UFO or its occupants seemed possible.
As with any good commercial TV show/movie, they were successful because they appealed to many viewers.  TV shows like this and 'The Twilight Zone' were scripted by writers and produced by talented people who understood the American psyche.
This DVD series is successful to me now because it transports me back in time (something most of us like to do at some point in our life) and puts me on the floor in front of the old black & white TV set with a bowl of popcorn.  From my perspective, this series of 'The Outer Limits - Season 1' is a delight.  The only things missing are the commercial segments.  DID I JUST WRITE THAT?  I wish they could have included those as a ""bonus"".
And for those who might be wondering, so far I've had no issues while playing them on my simple DVD player.",1392854400,,1488,4.535580524344569

1727819,4,B000068V9R,"It's always good to find something that is intelligent on television--even when we have to go back a few years.  From 1963-1965 we had ""The Outer Limits"", a one hour voyage to unknown and disturbing things.  We would get a different story every week, with interesting actors, great special effects, and usually an engrossing story.  There were many good episodes, including ""Galaxy Being"" with Cliff Robertson; ""The Architects of Fear"" with Robert Culp; ""The Man With the Power"" with Donald Pleasance; and ""The Man Who Was Never Born"" with Martin Landau.  These were all in the first season!  The great thing for me about these episodes was the interaction between the main characters.  Despite the monsters which you might expect from a science fiction show, the episodes were often love stories in the sense that a couple faced a problem,, and usually it brought them closer together.  The series didn't hesitate to point the finger at technology or government run amok.  Filmed in the b&w common to the era, the show may seem ancient to some young viewers, but is definitely worth at least a look--and maybe more.than one.",1379635200,4,1125,4.915343915343915
1727820,4,B000068V9R,"September 16 2013 marks the 50th anniversary of the debut of ""The Outer Limits"" on TV. It is certainly one of the best science fiction series to ever appear on television even with its brief two year run. OL was creative and innovative and would go on to produce not only some of the best episodes in television history but some of the best monsters and creatures as well. The Zantis from ""The Zanti Misfits"" is one of the best examples. In fact a few years ago TV Guide rated that episode of ""Outer Limits"" 98th in their list of the 100 greatest episodes in the history of Television. OL was an anthology series meaning it had a different story and characters every week. During the late '50s to early '60s anthology shows were popular with the TV schedules having such series as ""Outer Limits"", ""Twilight Zone"", ""One Step Beyond"", ""Thriller"" and a few others. Many people in fact compare OL with being in common with TZ which I don't agree with. I always felt they were two entirely different programs. ""Outer Limits"" was far more science fiction to me while ""Twilight Zone"" did have certainly some sci-fi to it but had other elements to its stories as well, like fantasy for example, that made it different. The one thing both series certainly had in common was the ability to play on the imagination of the viewer as they watched the programs.

Of the two seasons of ""Outer Limits"" the first I feel is the best. Not that the second season was bad but that most of the best shows were from the first. Along with the ""Zanti Misfits"" there was ""The Galaxy Being"" (the debut episode), ""The Architects of Fear"", ""The Bellero Shield"", ""It Crawled Out Of The Woodwork"", ""Second Chance"" and ""Production And Decay Of Strange Particles"" (starring a young Leonard Nimoy a couple of years before he would become famous as a Vulcan) that I think rate among the best. Since it only lasted two seasons there are only 49 episodes of ""The Outer Limits"" with 32 of those episodes appearing in the first season. For anyone though who is a fan of the show you need to get both seasons (or at least the first one) to add to your video collection. For anyone who is a fan of sci-fi but have never seen ""Outer Limits"" then you need to get this collection and enjoy some of the very best sci-fi to ever appear on TV.",1379289600,,2296,4.466666666666667

1727840,5,B000068V9R,"The aura of the series condensed into one, the third to be exact, episode.  The TV series ""The Outer Limits"" in name was a sort of ""shot over the bough"" as it promised to control the visuals, and thus the mind, of the viewer transporting one to some far-fetched place which would be challenging as well as, likely, harrowing. As far as ominous intros ""The Outer Limits"" may never be outdone! By creating a polar-opposite reality which the viewer would have a connection, after all those who it depicted started out just as normal as the viewer, it created great tension and fear.  That tension and fear was the meat and potatoes of the series.  No episode may be darker, and thus more fearful, than ""The Architects of Fear""

The Architects of Fear spins a tale of a cabal of concerned scientists whose goal of achieving a non-nuclear peaceful world by means of the creation of a menacing alien - an alien that would scare the whole planet in turn uniting all of the splintered world in a common goal of survival.  They do so by uniting the DNA of some kind of supposed other worldly creature and one of themselves (they drew straws sort of).  If art mimics reality, then go forward 20+years to a Ronald Regan speech where he referenced the fact if the world was suddenly faced with an alien menace even Russia would join in with The United State's common purpose where all former differences would be trivial.  Also, presently, those who study ""so-called alien abductions"" sight the oft stated purpose of the aliens is for earth to unite in peaceful nuclear-free harmony.  Then remember this was a 1963 show...This episode casts a long shadow indeed.

Thus, ""The Architects of Fear"" is a pivotal highly recommended episode.  The directors are guilty of pushing the story into a few poor special effects its true, but these must be overlooked as the story itself is fraught with dark fears causing grave consequences. Robert Culp stars as the physicist turned monster from outer space providing a juxtaposition from handsome to gruesome. True the monster ""get-up"" is crude, but it has some features that hint at a hellish origin which hit hard.  Just imagine being young and impressionable in the much more naive time-frame of pre November 22nd 1963.  This episode particularly grabbed the youth of the day by the throat...come to think of it the implied warning still does.",1360886400,,2373,4.760975609756097

The Outer Limits Season 1, Ep. 20 ""The Bellero Shield""
This episode stuck in my memory more than most. It is shadowy dark and deadly serious. The lines of script are well written and delivered by the actors with great intensity.

1727846,5,B000068V9R,"I ordered this volumne 3 as used. The outer carton is in excellent shape and the discs all look in excellent shape as well. The inner cases that the dvds are in are fine. The center hub where the dvds are attached are fine and dvds were held in place when I opened cases. I have Volume 1 also, which is the first half of season one. I have not purchased volume 2 yet, and after doing some researching, I have found that volume 2 is the second half of season one. This volume 3, is the complete season two. Based on some other commenters on amazon, but with other volumes, there are positive and negitive comments. This volume 3, being the complete season two, has some really good episodes in it. I saw a lot of these back in the 60's as a child,so I don't remember most of it, but that's ok. Some people on other posts, feel like season one is the best,because of certain directors and others involved. To me,these are just as good. It's all science-fiction,so why some people would base a certain season as to how good or bad it is because of a certain director, is rather silly to me. A prime example:Steven Spielberg directed the original Jaws movie. Another dude named Jeannot Szwarc directed Jaws 2. The second movie was just as good, but on a different level than the first one. Same with these seasons; nothing will ever beat the original of anything, especially if certain people leave the production staff. But it is still good in its' own right, and I am glad I bought them. I will be getting volume 2 of season one as soon I am able. For any sci-fi buff, this is good stuff. I have never seen the re make of this show,but I know it won't be as good, and there is probably cussing and maybe even some nudity,which I do not care for either. 60's sci-fi had its' cheesy elements, but technolgy wasn't near as advanced as it is today; and frankly I like the cheese. Simplicity is much better than a bunch of blue and green screens and everything becoming computer generated these days. That to me folks,is not movies nor tv shows.

1727869,4,B000068V9R,"I watched this stuff when I was five years old, and remember it quite well. The atmosphere was something that sucked me in, in black-and-white, on my old RCA portable in my mom's bedroom. And as an adult, I can see the flaws in it but embrace it, for the most part, just the same. It holds me in a way other shows from that time did not. For example, The Twilight Zone. I can't stand to watch The Twilight Zone, then or now---it's too stupid to me, just a lot of sexist implausibility---but the monsters of the first season of The Outer Limits always get me. (I agree that the truncated second season of The Outer Limits wasn't so hot. Why? Lack of monsters.)

There are certain classic episodes that have been agreed upon (Soldier, The Man with the Glass Hand, The Galaxy Being, etc.), and they are quite wonderful, if not close to flawless. But, like most things, the majority of offerings is not up to that standard. Given that, if you can look upon these with an eye for 1950s TV values (and yes, I know this series was from 1964-1965, but at that time in the 60s, 50s values still prevailed), you will find much to enjoy and learn from. The clothing, the furniture, the modulations of the voices when people spoke endearments to each other, the expressions, the yearnings of people---these are things that were familiar and even a type of social code at the time, and if you allow yourself to embrace an earlier, softer-edged era, you will find them familiar too. And it won't hurt you to learn additional social codes that predated you.

This show was delivered at a time just before color become a big thing on TV (most people still didn't own color sets, so there was no point in broadcasting a color signal for most shows). It was also just before the entire Youthquake of the mid60s, spurred forth by the arrival of the Beatles and then the endless outpouring of teen entertainment that followed, and the army of teenage minds that became hungry for input, courtesy of the Baby Boom kids blooming into a seemingly endless supply of vibrant teenagers. These shows depict the post-war fascination with space, electrical gizmos, psychology, genetics, man's role on the planet, the beginning of a sense of responsibility for where we were going, and by the way, weren't we going too fast? Might we be losing the best of humanity in a sense of hurtling progress and rushing toward the achievement of every desire, courtesy of science?

This was the classic moral dilemma put forth by the post-war prosperity---you could have it all---for a price. But even for the average person, if you pay on time---by credit---you could get it somehow. And get it we did! In unprecedented volume. Trade in your car every year for the latest model. And let's build more atomic plants! Endless power, no pollution! It's a miracle.  And replace that bolt-down, deco-styled seven-year-old washing machine for a streamlined turquoise one---it's the latest thing. And an electric frying pan. And a dishwasher. And a clothes dryer, more convenience for mom! More electric gizmos, more, more. And get a second car for the wife, and a phone for every room, the latest thing, a princess phone for your 13-year-old girl, and a second TV in the basement rec room for the kids...

So, moving forward now, into the 1960s, limping and shaking a little from all the product consumption and the frenzy of competition for getting more objects, more toys. We now have endless consumer desire. Endless human need for progress, and more, more, more. But...where would it all lead? What does it mean for people? Will we lose who we are, the best of who we are? Is it worth holding on to something that may seem outdated, but is, in fact, vital for remaining human?

This kind of thought had been put forth on Science Fiction radio dramas during the 50s, and had lived in the short stories and books of many science fiction writers of the time, from the 1930s on---what were we turning into---were we ready for the future?---but in 1963-1964, a time when The Dream might be souring a bit, all of us a bit dog-eared from all that buying and cold-war tension, The Outer Limits made these ideas visual flesh for the masses in a way that the movies could not. You didn't even have to leave your living room to encounter new ideas, entertainingly offered. And you didn't have the, um, distractions of the Drive-In to contend with. It was just you and the TV...

Yes, there is a lot of corny stuff in these episodes. A lot of sexist stuff. That is much of who we were and how we did things. But it is the beginning of much of who we are today, so examine it without as much critique as to the story line. Look at the people. Even the silly ones probably have something to offer the adventuring mind, seeking to understand ""What Were We Thinking About In 1963?"" Well, some of us were thinking about these shows, and some of us were even inspired by them. This show, if we adventured to watch it, took us by the hand and led us to a day when the idea of space would become a commonplace notion, attainable by actual people. And remember, the moonshot was only a few years away...

Social value? This show did its small best to break through our naive ideas about the future, and even about the conditions of the day. It tried to get through to our higher minds and make us think---while being entertained.

It was a transition to a more sophisticated way of thinking about science and the future and space, done in a way anybody could understand, and it was there to entertain us as well...enjoy it on more than one level, is what I am telling you. Try hard. See it as a social artifact, and ponder that. It's worth it.

I'm really happy these shows are available.",1284854400,,5724,4.553935860058309
1727870,4,B000068V9R,"And not nearly as good as the first season. I'm not the least bit sure why, but the second season of the Outer Limits was nowhere as near as good as the first. Nothing in this season compares with such a truly creepy show as The Production of Strange Particles or Do Not Open Until Doomsday-- but, these shows are still the original Outer Limits and are still worth watching.

I started taping these shows from the This network, but being reasonably priced, it's worth the money to get this season on DVD despite the shortage of good firstseason-like shows. At least we get these shows in good quality audio and video; two things we just can't get from taping off of the Tv set even with the new HD broadcasting.

Once again, I had no problems whatsoever and am very happy with it. The packaging could be better and I do not like two-sided flipper discs, so I'm once again giving this 4 stars.

It's commonly stated that the second season of the original Outer Limits was not as good as the first season, and I agree. I'm talking about the quality of the scripts mostly, not anything to do with the DVD package. It is still a classic and thought-provoking show, however. The 4-star rating is taking everything into consideration. I deducted a single star for the flipper discs, but the fact that the price is so low more than makes up for the poor packaging, IMO. If you're like me, low price ranks way up there on the list of reasons why I will purchase certain DVDs, and having bought Volume 3 for around 12 bucks (less than the price of a couple of meal deals at McDonald's), this was another major bargain. It is unfortunate that some folks received defective discs, but I did not, and this review is obviously based on my experience. It does not take any others' into account, nor should it, IMO.

1727888,4,B000068V9R,"There's something about the original Outer Limits series that can never quite be captured by science fiction producers of the 21st century, as if a rare window were opened during an odd little era in the 20th century, a window to the unknown that can never be opened again. Why was the Outer Limits canceled during its second season? There's no way anyone who lived during that time and saw the series will agree that it had anything to do with low ratings. No, it wasn't low ratings that killled the original Outer Limits series, so what was it?

  Call me a conspiracy theorist, but I think its possible they were getting too close to the truth about some things, maybe too close for any semblance of comfort, such that the mighty authoritarian keepers of the zoo known as human civilization might have decided to put a lid on it before it went any further. But that's just my theory, for what it's worth.

  That note aside, Season Two may not have had anything quite like Season One's ""The Galaxy Being"", ""The Sixth Finger"", ""The Man Who Never Was"", or ""Controlled Experiment"", but it's ability to explore the boundaries of human speculation continued quite well, by delving into some equally odd and mysterious subjects, such as the far-future post-nuclear wastelands in ""Soldier"", the realm of an intelligent two-dimensional being accidentally caught in the 3-dimensional world of humans (Behold, Eck!), human scientific experimentation with organic and synthetic mind-enhancing drugs (Expanding Human), an experiment to create a planetary microcosm of life similar to primeval Earth (Wolf 359), a speculative projection upon the possibility of how premonitions may occur during a sudden snap-shot stop-action upon reality (The Premonition), and a close encounter with an alien probe by humans lost in a storm at sea (The Probe).

  All ten other episodes are equally entertaining, in the atmosphere of unknown mystery that exists now in a long forgotten era, somewhere quite beyond the dog-eat-dog rat-race known all too well by the vast majority of humans. I was a bit disappointed by the typical 50s outer-space attitude of ""The Invisible Enemy"", but i suppose that's because I've been spoiled by Star Trek. While old space-ships in retro series suffer the wear and tear of future upgrades, other areas of science-fiction weather the changes fairly well. ""Soldier"" still does well, despite the rather ancient looking armor that the future soldier was wearing. ""Behold, Eck!"" would have no problem in any era, as would ""Expanding Human"", or ""Keeper of the Purple Twilight"", etc...

  The concept of ""The Inheritors"" still does well, up until the point at which we see the space-ship, which seems like a big project that was scaled down to a low-budget, unfortunately, which might also explain why the series didn't quite complete its second season. ""I, Robot"" really isn't all that bad, despite the early concept of a mechanical man, since after all, the idea of a robot has always been evolving and an early version might just have been created during that era.

  I can't quite decide which are my favorites, since I enjoy them all so much, but I suppose ""The Premonition"" ranks highest, as I've always been fascinated by the concept of time and how the human consciousness relates to it through reality. I also really enjoyed ""Behold, EcK!"", because the concept of an intelligent 2-dimensional being is also quite fascinating. ""Wolf 359"" was also one of the most unique sci-fi concepts I've ever seen in any sci-fi series and the strange creature that evolved out of the experimental culture was truly an epitome of mystery in the unknown.

  All I can say is, despite some of the earlier bad reports about this package, I have no problems with it. All the Dvds are working quite well, no flaws on any of them. I was slightly confused by some errors in the packaging details, but that has no effect upon the condition of the discs, which appear to be fine. My tiny bit of advice about future improvements with this package would simply be to include a play-all function on the discs, if they are ever reformatted. I love sci-fi serial Dvds with the ""play-all"" option, because I can just let them all play through the afternoon or night without having to reset them. It makes sci-fi ""marathons"" so much easier that way. I love science-fiction marathons on a long weekend.

  Finally, I'd like to thank the other reviewers for the warnings about this product. Luckily, I purchased the entire first season in one box set during a local 2-for-1 sale on Dvds, so I didn't bother with the volumes and rather than purchase season 2 in the box-set, I did a careful study of each package deal and thanks to the warnings, realized it was safer to go with Volume 3, rather than the season 2 box-set.",1203033600,6,4799,4.856617647058823

There are incongruencies in the character's actions and it appeared to me as though a half an hour story was stretched to meet the needed hour slot. This was a short-short story that had to be elongated to fit into the series. I loved the appearence of a very young 'Dick' Dawson i.e. Richard Dawson of 'Hogan's Heroes' and 'Family Feud' fame.

1727894,3,B000068V9R,"We get the complete second season of the series this time without the booklet of credits for the show. The second season of ""The Outer Limits"" is memorable for all of four classic episodes--Harlan Ellison's ""Soldier"" & ""Demon with a Glass Hand"" and the two part ""The Inheritors"" featuring Robert Duvall. There are also a number of episodes that, if they fall short, are still impressive including the creepy, ""Counterweight"", ""The Premonition"", ""Wolf 359"" (which is referenced in the Borg ""Star Trek"" episodes from the third and fourth season)and ""Cold Hands, Warm Heart"". Leonard Nimoy appears in ""I,Robot"" a story that could have come from one of Asimov's Robot stories (except it's not quite as good as Asimov's).

The bad news is that these are the same discs repackaged. We don't get any extras (there was a terrific series of interviews produced when the show aired on TNT featuring some of the stars discussing the episodes they appeared in that would have cost a pittance to license. Fox (which is distributing all MGM/UA titles now) has elected to repackage some of MGM/UA's older TV shows and movies to collect their distribution fee. This is one of them.

It could have been put on an additional DVD-9 disc without much effort)and even the nice looking booklet from the previous set is missing. We do, however, get a synposis of each episode and the original airdate listed on the back of these slimline holders. Strangely enough, though, we only get it for ONE disc of each set totally totally ignoring the third disc of the set. So much for quality control maybe the Control Voice should have paid them a visit. A commentary track (William Shatner, Robert Culp, Robert Duvall and some of the other cast members are still alive as of this writing)would have been nice.

Heck even the nicely designed menu screen is carried over from the other edition.

The rest of the episodes are predominatly badly written junk demonstrating that after Joe Stefano (""Psycho"" and writer of some of the best episodes from season one)and Leslie Stevens (creator and writer of a number of terrific episodes as well)left the series, the show became an ordinary TV show.

It's a pity because although the second season was weak, this classic series did deserve better. There are some classic episodes but the shorter second season (it was cancelled mid-way through the season)had more duds than the first.

The real reason to get this set is because it is the entire second season at a less expense price than the original release. The lower cost may justify purchasing this set compared to the original considering how few good episodes were produced during season two. Series creator Leslie Stevens and series writer/producer/guiding light Joseph Stefano were both MIA during the second year of the show. Stefano wrote, co-wrote or provided stories for 10 episodes (over 1/3)of the first season episodes and Stevens was a steady presence writing three of the best episodes of the first season. Their presence is sorely missed. A pity that Ellison didn't write more than two episodes because his episodes along with ""The Inheritors"" are among the best in season two.

It has stories of profound insite tugging on both emotions and sentiments.  I can't think of a better way of telling or presenting short stories of pure science ficton than this.-Twilight Zone is of a different format all together-scocial science in reverse.  Most actors are well known today and guest stars appeared regularly to gain the believablity it deserved.  Such actors as David Macallum, Martin Landau, and Robert Culp as well as the depute appearenc of Sally Kellerman make these stories and characters outlast Time.  Dominic Frontire's music is fantastic, depicting the theme's grim, yet grandeous vastness of space and the future to more minor subtile themes of the dim and vagueness of the eerie odd and alienly conventional behaviors of the future on a more day to day level. No odvious over the top stuff like today. No one noticed that Obit's court room had automatic sliding doors for example.  Of course the New Outer Limits(1990's series) is just as good, sometimes even better, a rarity in a sci fi rehash the 90's sci fi sucking flies otherwise.",1187481600,2,1318,4.831111111111111

1727902,5,B000068V9R,"My friend Oronzo, who has magnificent taste in just about everything, has revived my interest in bad science fiction TV of late. Most of these are things I knew about from my childhood, but never thought of watching as an adult. Watching them now, I realize that these things are actually insanely great. It isn't that I'm just waxing nostalgic about my youth. Much of it I had only seen a couple of episodes of. And many things I used to watch and enjoy are now only watchable for nostalgic purposes.

Example of the latter category: Space 1999. Boy, I really loved that show. Golly, but it is intensely dumb. Evil nuclear waste blows up and sends the moon, with moonbase, through the cosmos to have space adventures. Featuring Martin Landau as .... Disco Space Jew! Quick, Alan; shoot the alien with the Bagel Ray gun, and get that schwartze Kano to go fix my neurotic computer! Oy Vey! Oy guvalt! The first season can be watched. Sort of. While drinking heavily. The second season, with the super space chick with the braided eyebrows is so bad, it makes me weep to think about it. I have them all on video, of course. I use them to torture attractive females who displease me. I still admit to a mighty fondness for the bombastic first bar or two of the Space 1999 theme song before it gets all disco on ya. I also am pretty sure Barbara Bain's high cheekbones and plentiful shebrew curvature ruined me for life on shiksas. Who says TV doesn't influence children?

But some of the other bad science fiction shows are different. Best of all of them is The Outer Limits. Better than Star Trek. Better than the Twilight Zone, which it was originally sort of based on. Considering how short a time it lasted (a mere two seasons; though really only the first one counts), it is probably even better than the mighty Dr. Who.

There is actually nothing bad about any of these shows, other than the dumb bug eyed monsters they had to jazz up with some bubble wrap and masking tape. If you can't get past that, you're a boorish idiot anyway; CGI effects look just as bad. The stories are just magnificent. Unlike anything else I've seen on television, they have character development, plot, a moral point, an insanely great idea or two, humanity and atmosphere. Of course, the atmosphere is all deep cold war pitch black dark. Even the black and white cinematography is amazingly great. It gives the early transistor era jet age of technology feel like nothing else, except maybe working in an antiquated jet age synchrotron. The programs also generally show a greater appreciation for the tragic nature of humanity and life in general than most things that aren't the ancient Greeks or Shakespeare. Which is to my mind a sign of great art, rather than the standard pie-faced americano optimism that gets into most teevee and makes it dumb.

The team who put this together were real artists. They were also deep thinkers. They understood the human condition, and they understood the politics and current events at a level beyond anything we see today on television, in movies, in newspapers; pretty much anywhere. They had really talented actors; I daresay, they actually found a lot of really talented actors who later went on to do good work elsewhere. Martin Sheen, William Shatner, Martin Landau, Ed Asner, Robert Culp, Shirley Knight, Bruce Dern, David McCallum, Barry Morse, Donald Pleasance, Robert Duvall, Cliff Robertson...

And, really, the entire series was pretty much written by two guys. Two insanely talented guys. One of them, Joseph Stefano, co-wrote Psycho with Hitchcock. The other one, Leslie Stevens, went on to make a cool B-movie in Esperanto called ""Incubus"" starring William Shatner, and one of my heroes, Anton LaVey. Some day in the distant future, when there are as many television shows as there are novels, and when the television program is as dead an art form as sculpture is today, they will need some kind of serious intellectual thinking person (as opposed to the type of nitwit who today goes into the field of television criticism, because they are too dumb to do anything else) to sort out all the magnificent things these guys did in the Outer Limits, and give it some serious grounding in the historical and sociopolitical background of the day. In all seriousness; it's deep enough to go over the way people analyze literature. It's certainly more worthy of study than rubbish like Star Wars or the Matrix movies.

These were so different than Ozzie and Harriet, Leave It To Beaver, Hazel, The Patty Duke Show, etc., shows some consider ""corny"" & predictable family shows.

The scientific sophistication of the writing is most charitably described as absent. Some of the scenes made me laugh out loud yet made me realize the anxiety society had over seeing a nuclear superpower launch a satellite into space. The ""atom bomb"" is mentioned frequently.

The Government is powerful and mysterious and acting in the Best Interest of its people even if a few citizens must suffer or perish.

Scientists tend towards emotional simplicity while viewing the world in rational and objective terms.

Women submit to men in a variety of ways despite their scientific status.

The producer, Joseph Stefano, seems to have had some form of a shoe fetish. The women are always in heels, even in outer space and on the moon!

The low production budget had good and bad points:

  There are some rather crude special effects and some special effects are omitted and described in the dialog as we watched the horrified actors.

  The underwater gear works just as well in outer space.

  We can spot occaisional monster recycling among episodes.

  A careful viewer will see walls shake when doors are shut revealing a set that was hastily assembled.

  For me, the worst part is the sound effects which never changed from show to show.

  Most devices are rows of dials. The close-up of the hand turning the same dial gets monotonous.

  Smoking was an act of sophistication and elegance.

  Mom wore a dress all day, even to cook and clean and Dad wears a jacket at dinner.

  In general, the cinematography was of very high quality. The closeups crisp and sharp. Some times I think I would rather watch a high-quality black and white movie than one made with a digital color camera.

  The lighting was brilliant. The use of shadows is very appealing. Black voids is used to represent fear, danger, emptiness.

  The lack of special effects seemed to bring more attention to the story and the acting.

  Can any of us ever forget the voice-over at the beginning of the show?

After watching these episodes I see why the series died in the second season. While there were some brilliant episodes, the writing in general was not very good. As for science fiction, it was more of a soap opera with a science theme.

Many people are complaining about the packaging of this release, but I could live with that (we have no other choice!).  But the only drawback to this series is that the episodes were an hour long (45-50 minutes without commercials).  The bad thing about this is that many of the episodes seem to drag on.  I hate to bring up The Twilight Zone again, but it was the example of a good scifi anthology--show the characters, show the dilemma, close the story with a twist ending--all in 30 minutes.  The Twilight Zone went to hour-long episodes in its fourth season, but they too dragged on and it was proven that less is better.  The Twilight Zone then went back to 30-minute episodes for its fifth season.  I just think that many of the Outer Limits episodes could have been cut down to 30 minutes and still had great quality.

However, don't let this one criticism deny the fact that The Outer Limits was a wonderful show.  It had a nice visual B-movie quality to it with A-movie writing and delivery.

I find that the black & white images add a sense of drama. The poor special effects would have been even more apparent if it had been filmed in color.

Overall I enjoyed watching these old episodes - but I must agree with some of the other reviews, that a few episodes were unwatchable.

Many of the stories are good, but the story development suffers in order to fit the 1-hour format. Having said that, I think the series pushed the envelope on what was considered acceptable subject matter in the early 60's.

Overall, I would say that if you enjoyed the original series when you were young, it will probably be worth purchasing this collection. If you've never seen it before, rent it first before buying.",1162684800,4,870,4.459119496855346

GOOD:

You can watch all those great Outer Limits shows that fans have come to love over the years.

Also, each season's packaging contains a helpful guide that describes each episode and the date that it aired.

The audio/video is acceptable (TV series back in the 60's didn't include stereo sound)!

BAD:

Lousy packaging--the disks are hard to remove as they have the ""push here"" center button with the ""lift here"" finger indent. But, it takes lots of pushing and lifting to remove them. Probably because of this, Disk 1 in my Season 1 box developed a crack in the disk starting at the spindle hole. It hasn't spread to the media portion of the disk YET!  I emailed MGM asking for a replacement disk but they replied that Sony now handles this product.  When I asked Sony for assistance, they told me they couldn't help me.  At the bottom of their email, they had the nerve to say that they hoped I would buy their product in the future!  Yea, right!

No supplemental material is included about the series. An Outer Limits Marathon on TV several years ago included interviews with the producer along with some of the writers and stars. It was most interesting and something like this could have been added to these disks.

Double-sided disks not labeled clearly. If you look (very closely) at each one, there's a volume number followed by several other numbers, then a tiny ""A"" or ""B."" The list of titles in each set, however, doesn't tell you which shows are on which side.  How about a clearly marked, ""Side A"" or ""Side 1"" as my other double-sided disks have? As a result, I sometimes need to check the index, remove the disk, flip to the other side, and reinsert it to see my chosen episode--most irritating.

Any good fiction makes the story being presented engaging & believable.  Good Sci-fi must make the unbelievable believable.  With the exception of the ""Man Who was Never Born"" the first 8 episodes I sat through (or really endured) were barely watchable with holes in the logic that a planet could easily pass through.

1727942,5,B000068V9R,"One can dismiss The Outer Limits as pulp and the lesser cousin to Rod Serling's Twilight Zone, but the series really showcases some of the best writing in science fiction.

Consider, for example, Harlan Ellison's ""Soldier"" and ""Demon with a Glass Hand,"" all stellar examples of science fiction's Golden Age. The Outer Limits successfully blended science fiction and Gothic horror into literate teleplays contrary to the typical, bland weeknight fare aired in 1963.

Yes, the SFX and monster costumes were crude, cheap and somewhat laughable today in the wake of today's slick CGI, Industrial Light & Magic and George Lucas. What Rod Serling was to the Twilight Zone, producer and writer Joseph Stefano and Leslie Stevens were to the Outer Limits.

The strength of The Outer Limits came from the imagination with the monsters, or ""bears"" as Stefano called them, who occupied the deep recesses of our dreams and our nightmares.  The first season, represented in this set, is generally considered the stronger of the two.  In addition to the actors who were then guest stars in the series would later become, quite literally, household names (Martin Landau, Warren Oates, Cliff Robertson, Donald Pleasance, Robert Culp, Martin Sheen.) The series is really the genesis of science fiction and fantasy successfully blended together that has not only withstood the harsh test of time, but infused TV with a great adventure.

Many episodes of the first season deserve repeated viewing: ""The Architects of Fear,"" ""A Hundred Days of the Dragon,"" (a Cold War thriller, rather than a sci-fi tale--similar to John Frankenheimer's ""Seconds""), ""A Feasibility Study,"" and several others all presented in glorious black & white!",1149033600,3,1711,5.226277372262774

The video transfer to disc is flawless, with the image looking as though it's from a master print (most likely is).  A minor gripe is that they might have done a little more processing on the soundtrack, as the audio on one or two episodes was a little low and somewhat distorted.  However, with today's home theater/stereo systems, minor boosts in volume and treble should solve this small problem.  Overall it's an excellent item, bringing back fond memeories of the series which I enjoyed very much as a teenager.  The liner notes with episode summaries were well done.

However, aren't those copies a bit fuzzy? Finally, the ultimate version has arrived. OUTER LIMITS is one of those series that gets better with age. As children, we could not appreciate the marvelous score, lighting, moody atmosphere and intelligent scripts.  We just wanted to see the monster.  Watching these episodes now, the monster is not as important, and of course, technically is not as impressive.
But let's forgive this 1963-1965 anthology series its shortcomings. The low budgets and tight schedules made the creators use their imagination and bring us a world truly magical.  We have a man traveling through time, another trying to scare earth into behaving by impersonating an alien, alien forces inhabiting inanimate objects, and many other stories that don't depend entirely on effects, they are simply fascinating stories.
Creator Joe Stephano admits the network wanted a monster each week, to attract a core audience of youngsters. How clever of him to inject some class into a series that lasted only 49 episodes due to network ignorance, but has been shown over 40
years due to the genius of Stephano and producer Leslie Stevens.

1727977,1,B000068V9R,"I received this series set from a friend who thought my love of The Twilight Zone would make it a good gift.  I had never seen Outer Limits before, but was anxious to experience this show I continually heard referred to as groundbreaking and highly imaginative.  I know this is heresy, but I found it neither.
Here are my three major reasons why:
1.  Each episode starts with a teaser-type prologue that immediately shows some of the most shocking or interesting scenes.  This destroys the mystery of the show to follow as we've already seen the hideous monster or know the twist.  I just wound up fast-forwarding through them.
2.  The episodes are padded.  Almost all of them would be much more powerful if they were 30 minutes instead of hour-long episodes.  Many feature scenes of the most mundane `action' repeated over and over again (scientists at control panels, cars driving down roads, etc.).  Others feature characters endlessly talking about ramifications when what we really want to see is what's happening to the hapless victim.  If these extraneous scenes were cut out, I could see myself enjoying them much more.
3.  The show is too moralistic.  Too many episodes revolve around man's cruelty and our needing to learn to live in peace with one another.  It's a great theme to explore, but when most of the 32-episode season deals with it, it gets tiring and worse, preachy.  I realize The Twilight Zone fell into this trap too, but I find it telling that some of TWZ most memorable episodes are ones about supernatural circumstances and our reactions to them.
The series is best at creating an uneasy mood - a feeling that anything can happen.  The lighting was something I marveled at in almost every episode.  My gazing was made all the easier by the crisp and clear transfer which delivers a black and white that rarely devolves into the dreaded gray and washed out look of some older films.  My only qualm with the DVD presentation would be the decision to not include any bonus material at all.  Series sets demand at least a documentary on the shows creation.  Although I wouldn't recommend this series to the uninitiated, it's sure to please long-time fans.",1077235200,26,2179,4.762666666666667
1727978,4,B000068V9R,"This 32-episode, 4-disc set collects the entire first season of the seminal Leslie Stevens-Joseph Stephano science fiction series of the early Sixties.

Unlike the often lyrical, soft-focus mysticism of its competitor, 'The Twilight Zone,' the equally moralistic 'The Outer Limits' ostensibly bolstered the pivotal role rationality and the scientific method play in man's attempt to grasp, understand, and control the universe. On closer examination, however, the real theme of the series--man's paralyzing anxiety when faced with the failure of reason and the disturbing limitations of science--becomes painfully evident.

Despite its constant stream of thoughtful committees, square-jawed scientists, orderly laboratories, and progressive hardware, the shadowy, cynical world of 'The Outer Limits' is one even more aggressively haunted by the pettiness of human nature and the presence of the daimonic than that of Rod Serling's more popular series.

Viewers should keep in mind that writer, producer, and overall key player Joseph Stephano wrote the screenplay for Alfred Hitchcock's 'Psycho' (1960), one of the pivotal American films of the 20th Century.

A field day for students of popular culture, the included episodes offer a time capsule bloated with influential ideas and creative talent that have subsequently enjoyed a significant impact in a wide variety of mediums.

The never-bettered first episode, ""The Galaxy Being,"" would have delighted the Surrealists; ""The Architects of Fear"" utilizes an idea that Alan Moore would adopt 25 years later for 'The Watchmen' (1986); and ""The Man with the Power"" may have inspired Stan Lee's and Jack Kirby's creation of Magneto, a comic book villain still gaining popularity 30 years after his debut.

""100 Days of the Dragon"" combines 'The Manchurian Candidate' (1962) with 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' (1956), while the series' grimmest hour, ""Corpus Earthling,"" looked visually back on 'The Invisible Invaders' (1959) and 'Carnival of Souls' (1962) and forward to 'Night Of The Living Dead' (1968).

""Don't Open Until Doomsday"" combines a hatbox-sized spaceship and a cyclopean alien invader with Billy Wilder's 'Sunset Boulevard' (1951).

The fanciful special effects in ""Moonstone"" and ""The Bellero Shield"" occasionally recall George Melies' groundbreaking ""A Trip To The Moon' (1902).

The giant ants of 'Them!' (1954) are reduced to 12 inches, given peevish clown's faces, and set upon murderous sociopath Bruce Dern in the existential camp classic ""The Zanti Misfits.""

""ZZZZZ"" reverses the human-into-insect formula of 'The Fly' (1958) and 'The Wasp Woman' (1959), and unlike feline Irena Dubrovna in 'The Cat People' (1942), the episode's queen bee-turned-woman gleefully indulges her murderous sexuality.  ""The Guests"" blends 'the old dark house' genre with an erudite, attic-dwelling space monster that resembles a cross between an enormous clutching grouper and reproductive organs of the female sperm whale. After a forcible first encounter in the dark, the defiant young hero is asked, ""Did you submit to it?""

Both ""It Crawled Out of the Woodwork"" and ""Production And Decay of Strange Particles"" further develop the nuclear horror of 'Kiss Me Deadly' (1955), while ""O.B.I.T."" brilliantly predicts today's world of mass surveillance and evaporating privacy.

The courageous fairytale bride of ""The Man Who Had Never Been Born"" recalls dauntless heroine Janet of the British folk ballad 'Tam Lin,' and ""The Borderland"" is hard evidence that some of the most dramatic and fully realized segments of the program were monster-free.

""The Children of Spider County"" centers around an extended homosexual metaphor: five young men of mysterious paternity, ""exceptional looks and intellect,"" and ""magnificent special natures"" are reminded that ""different is not necessarily abnormal,"" even if the ""witch boys"" spend their nights ""walking in moon-lit meadows"" by themselves. Sidelong, up and down glances at the handsome protagonist by ostensibly suspicious policemen punctuate the proceedings.

Additionally, power-mad housewife Sally Kellerman and sinister housekeeper Chita Rivera appear to enjoy a lesbian relationship in  ""The Bellero Shield.""

Government complexes that hum ominously in the night, lax security, sterile desert landscapes, guilt-haunted personalities, prisoner-exchange programs, nighttime electrical storms, and shrewish wives are some of the series' reoccurring motifs.

Psychological jargon abounds: a psychiatrist named 'Sigmund' features in ""The Man with the Power,"" which was clearly influenced by 1956's 'Forbidden Planet,' while a doctor in ""Corpus Earthly"" asks a question that adequately speaks for the series as a whole: ""Do you know anything about paranoia?""

""ZZZZZ,"" still bizarre and unsettling by today's standards, buzzes with overheated Freudian Family Romance.

Interestingly, almost every episode offers a second, nonscientific plot element that occasionally acts as an alternative explanation for events: ""The Architects of Fear"" combines radical plastic surgery with sympathetic intuition, for example, and the Mexican peasants of ""Corpus Earthly"" suggest that demonic possession, not alien invasion, may be responsible for the chaos that occurs.

""The Galaxy Being"" mixes a heady discussion of pantheism with teleportation, and ""The Borderland"" juxtaposes physics with Victorian spiritualism.

Not all of the episodes are equal in quality:

Overacting ruins ""Nightmare,"" and ""The Children of Spider County,"" ""Second Chance,"" ""The Mutant,"" and ""Fun And Games"" lack enough polish and plot development for fifty-minute segments.

MGM has decided to do the first 32 episodes on 4 disks, making each disk double-sided.  While not a problem in itself, the label for each disk is reduced to the small 6-point type around the inside hub, and you will spend much time squinting to see what disk it is, much less what side.  Add to this the fact that none of the episode lists (either on the package or insert booklet) tells you which side of a disk a particular episode is on, and you're bound to have needless frustration trying to find a particular episode without a major search.  MGM has produced a substandard product with this presentation.

1727981,4,B000068V9R,"The original 1960s version of THE OUTER LIMITS is arguably one of the best science-fiction series ever created for television.  The writing was fresh, innovative, and literate, and episode plots were often inspired by the real-life scientific and social issues of the day.  True, the show's limited budget sometimes resulted in cheesy special effects, but the producers and their crews worked hard to ensure that the stories were of the highest quality.  Even though the series lasted only two seasons, the intelligence and overall quality of the program have helped it to remain an influential sci-fi favorite for more than 40 years.
This set of DVDs contains the entire first season of THE OUTER LIMITS, which originally aired during the 1963-1964 TV season.  Many fans and critics regard this to be the best of the two seasons, but that is highly debated by fans and critics who feel the second season to be superior.  Whatever the case may be, there are definitely some standout episodes in Season One.  Some of those include:
""The Zanti Misfits"" is a story that addresses, among other things, the issues of overcrowded prisons and capital punishment. When Earth agrees to incarcerate criminals from the planet Zanti, the Earthlings learn that they aren't quite prepared to deal with the gangsters, racketeers, and murderers from another planet. (This remains to this day one of the most popular episodes  among the show's ardent fans.)
In ""The Man Who Was Never Born,"" an 20th-century astronaut inadvertently  travels through a time-warp to Earth's future, where he learns that the human race is doomed to extinction as the result of a biological experiment designed by a 20th-century scientist.  When the astronaut and one of the last members of the human race decide to return to the 20th century and prevent the disaster, they learn that toying with history and destiny comes with a high price.
In ""The Architects of Fear,"" a group of the world's great thinkers decide that the only way to unite Earth's warring nations is to give them a common non-terrestrial enemy to battle--so they cook one up in the laboratory.
A myriad of actors and actresses who would later go on to become big stars appeared in various first-season episodes.  This estimable group includes Cliff Robertson, Robert Culp, Donald Pleasence, David McCallum, Martin Landau, Sally Kellerman, Martin Sheen, Edward Asner, Bruce Dern, Dabney Coleman, Carroll O'Connor, Richard Dawson, Russell Johnson, Marion Ross, Leonard Nimoy, Robert Duvall, Vera Miles, and Barbara Rush.  The producer during this first season was Joseph Stefano, probably better known to non-genre fans as the screenwriter who adapted Robert Bloch's novel to the big screen for Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO.
There have been alot of complaints circulating regarding the picture quality of this DVD set, and it is true that there seems to have been little, if any, work done in the digital restoration of these wonderful sci-fi teleplays.  This is unfortunate, because some of the episodes do show minor amounts of scratches, spots, and other wear artifacts.  However, these are DVDs, so the picture quality is still quite acceptable and does not include any of the tape-noise artifacts or signs of tape wear that consumers suffered through with the previously released VHS editions.
All in all, Season One of THE OUTER LIMITS makes a fine addition to the DVD collection of any science fiction fan.
(NOTE: The four-star rating does take the non-restored picture quality into account, as well as the fact that the DVDs do not offer any special features or extras. Otherwise, this DVD set would earn a five-star rating.)",1068422400,14,3659,5.09866220735786

A beautiful transfer with crisp sound makes these still unsettling episodes a pleasure to watch. That they can still be watched at all after 40 years is a tribute to the creative forces behind the series, Joseph Stefano and the late Leslie Stevens. Guided by their vision, The Outer Limits scared a generation of nascent television watchers and became an icon of the 60s. (I can still remember being sent to bed about half way through THE ZANTI MISFITS because it frightened me!)Like any anthology, the quality of the stories was variable, but episodes such as THE 100 DAYS OF THE DRAGON, THE ARCHITECTS OF FEAR (my vote for the best episode)and A FEASIBILITY STUDY more than made up for weaker offerings such as TOURIST ATTRACTION. Over the years, I've watched the Outer Limits many times, and each viewing is always a fresh new experience. To be sure the special effects are dated and on the surface, the LOOK of the series is firmly rooted in the mid 1960s, but the feel of The Outer Limits and the polemic of the series remains vibrant and relevant.

Hopefully, anyone who does experience a flaw will be able to get a full refund, or exchange from wherever they bought it.
Is this set worth buying?  YES!  A few years ago, this series was out in two volumes on Laserdisc (a dying format now, I realize) for about 100 dollars each.  This is true.  On video, each episode was available ... (and still may be available).  But think of the savings when you buy the entire season on [DVD!!!]  You get 32 ONE HOUR episodes (50 minutes each without commercials.  They did have less commercial interruptions back then.) ...  This is one of the all-time greatest deals ever.
The show itself is excellent, and out of 32 episodes, there were only about 5 or 6 that I found were less than stellar.  The others were fantastic.
Major standouts are: ""The Galaxy Being"", ""100 Days of the Dragon"", ""The Invisibles"", ""Nightmare"", and ""The Chameleon"" but many more are just as great.
For those people that would rather be watching Twilight Zone remember this, Twilight Zone tried the one hour format, but after 6 episodes returned to the 1/2 hour format for the rest of its run.  The Outer limits did nothing BUT Hour long episodes in its two years, and I for one find both series near the very top of my favorite science fiction programs on television.

It was definitetly one of the most intriguing and fully entertaining TV shows ever produced and aired during their era...and this collection fully reestablishes the IMPACT the series had on sci-fi and horror film fans. I've played the dvd set on all three of my dvd players(two cheapies!)-TV-Stereo reciever combos; etc, also on my PC,and encountered absolutely NO PROBLEMS whatsoever during the playbacks. This collection, along with the AVENGERS original TV Series dvd collection both bring back memories and flashback me to my childhood. Both in Classic BLACK & WHITE, perfectly remastered in all their original legendary small screen glory! Now I'm remembering WHERE I saw alot of those eerie monsters and aliens I'd recall every now and then since my childhood. They don't make Sci-fi films like this anymore...everything is so generic and predictably produced run of the mill now.

1727987,5,B000068V9R,"With talents like Joseph Stephano and Leslie Stephens as producers, some of the best Sci-Fi Writers and a lot of talented 60's actors and even actors that went on to great fame like Robert Culp, David McCallum, Sally Kellerman, Robert Duvall and Martin Landau, this was one of the first quality Sci-Fi series.
Twilight Zone was out there, but at times it was not really pure Sci-Fi, often more mysterious and horror, Thriller hosted by Boris Karloff (PLEASE PUT THESE OUT on DVD) were pure horror and the long running Alfred Hitchcock Present was straight mystery, so SCI-FI fans were captivated from the opening line with that mysterious voice telling you your telly has been taken over for the next 60 minutes.  The acting was top notch, the writing literate and thought provoking, and you will even see many of the episodes were later cannibalised later to make movies, such as SOLDIER with Michael Anshara, repackaged in the 80's as The Terminator.  To think you get 32 original episodes on 4 double-sided discs is just amazing.
There are a few puppies in the series...In the second year of the series Stephano played a less controlling interest.  He believed in thoughty mind twisting Sci-Fi, while Stevens wanted the monster of the week, so some monsters did get a little Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea-ish (Think they even shared a couple with monster doing double time!).  But all in this in one super buy is a must for all those Baby Boomers that would once more would like their telly taken over.
Warning to those who have not seen the series, these are vintage, high quality Black & White episodes.  I think it adds to the spookiness as they could film in lower light, creating those sinister shadows.",1048377600,86,1713,4.73489932885906
1727988,3,B000068V9R,"After receiving The Outer Limits a couple of weeks ago I started watching it in earnest, fearing that some of the disks might be faulty after reading some of the other reviews.
Although one of the disks had a scratch, it played without a problem.  Out of all 32 episodes (thats over 27 hours), one episode jumped for a single second and another jumped during the opening credits.
I would agree with others that the packaging, although VERY compact, could result in the disks getting scratched.  I would advise anyone upon receiving this box set to put a couple of sheets of paper into the case to prevent the disks from touching.
Although I had to turn the sound up a bit, the quality of both the sound and picture was good.
If anyone is thinking of buying this box set because they remember the show to be great...don't.  Some of the episodes are great.  Some are boring and slow.  Most are average.
There are a number of episodes here that I wouldn't be in any rush to watch again.  Having said that, I did enjoy watching them all.  Even the slow episodes had some scenes that would merit a second viewing.  I would also advise anyone watching to read The Outer Limits Companion at the same time.  Its great for getting some background material on the production of the show, such as problems with the censors and just what the producers wanted to say.
If you are about to start watching The Outer Limits, I would recommend that you look at the sets used in individual episodes.  Its amazing how many times the same staircase or corridor turns up.  Look at the staircase in The Special One and The Guests; its the same one.
The vehicles are another thing to look out for.  Most are very dusty.  Just where did they store them?",1047859200,4,1728,4.464968152866242

Each week I would be eager to tune in to hear the control voice to see what monsterous creature was lurking on The Outer Limits.  Since recently purchasing this DVD, it was refreshing to see these classic episodes and even those I had missed during its original run.  The picture quality is clear and crisp, with the sound being superb like the series was produced within a last few months.

Each disk is double sided and has 4 or more episodes on each side. I've spent several hours watching them already.
My low (below average) rating comes from the packaging. MGM must have thought, ""Just how many DVD's can we cram into one small box?"" Because of the way it's set up, the ""buttons"" that hold the DVD in the case rub against the other disks and -will- scratch them. And since the disks are 2X sided, you will loose episodes, if your able to play them at all. I had to return mine 3 times to get a working set, and only then because the store was cool enough to piece together a working set of my other returns.
If your lucky enough to get a complete, unscratched set, you better have some spare cases around to make sure they stay that way!

1727992,5,B000068V9R,"In my opinion, one of the best, if not the best, Sci-Fi series ever to hit the tube.
Those brought up on contemporary Sci-Fi/Horror, with it's ever-more incredible special effects, will watch Outer Limits, with it's black&white primitive, even campy effects, for about 5 minutes before turning it off. But they will be missing something.
These episodes are what I call ""intellectual morality plays""; dealing with very deep and fundamental issues of science, technology, the nature of life and existence, human
emotion, our place in the Universe, etc. Contemporary Sci-Fi/Horror is (for the most part) very shallow and dissapointing, relying too much on effects only. Comparing Outer Limits to
current works is akin to comparing a good Alfred Hitchcock movie (like ""Psycho"") to an '80's teen-slasher.
Outer Limits had some of the weirdest soundtracks you ever heard; I purchased the soundtrack audio CD as well and, having ripped the tracks to MP3 and WAV, have found them very well
suited to some of my home-grown fractal animations.
Created on a shoestring budget; most episodes were made in 2-3 days. This, along with genuinely scary monsters (despite the primitive effects), and some serious themes and concepts, makes this series an immortal classic in my opinion.
I of course didn't catch the original runs, but to the syndicated re-runs I owe some of the most delightful nightmares and sleepless nights of my (very early) childhood.
No, I will not ""grade"" any of the episodes. Sufficient to say that some are excellent, some are a bit lame, and most are in-between. But all good. (The modern '80's re-incarnation
of the series is a sad dissapointment). If you have never seen the originals, and you are a fan of (the better) '50's and '60's ""B movies"", you really should check it out.
I have most of the collection on VHS. I purchased the first season quad DVD set and look foreward to the second season DVD. I must make a note about the DVD however. Some of the episodes do not play well. There is skipping and distortion. I get this all the time on movie DVD rentals, and it is usually corrected by a good (carefull) cleaning. I am unable to fix the Outer Limits DVD, however, the ""flawed"" episodes play fine on my computer!
Clearly, Amazon is not at fault for this. It may be a production error (getting that old stuff in digital format) or maybe I just have a ""lemon"". Be advised.",1043971200,3,2390,4.803398058252427

Anyways, I too, was scared Sh**less by this TV show as a kid although I only saw it in the late sixties as a re-run, here in Canada. It has left memories in my mind I could never forget.
It was a real pleasure to hear the Control Voice again. Still today, that humming at the beginning of the show continue to have something scary and disturbing...
This set is DEFINITELY worth buying. Just hope MGM will release the second season.
As for thechnical problems, I have to say that this release is PERFECT. The image has been beautifully restored (to crystal clear clarity)and the sound is as good as could be.

that whoever was in charge of the sound mix was perhaps doing this unpurpose out of personal tatse. The sound mix is over filtered, occaisionally muddy but the real crime is the near loss of the wonderful background music that was very much a trademark of this old series.

  These Outer Limits episodes are from that period. How many kids were inspired by them, and later became scientists or engineers? ""The Borderland"" and ""Production & Decay of Strange Particles"" did it for me.

1728009,4,B000068V9R,"Long before Terminator and The Matrix, before Blade Runner, Altered States and Scanners, before The Andromeda Strain and Planet of the Apes, and even before the original Star Trek and Lost in Space and just nine years after Forrest J. Ackerman coined the term ""scifi"", there was this high pitched whine emerging from our bulbous Zeniths and RCA console TVs accompanied by a pulsating oscilloscope signal, a rolling test pattern and a blurry moon image sharpening to ""crystal clarity"", and a calm ""control voice"" assuring us there was nothing wrong with the tube. All we needed to do was sit quietly and safely observe the mind-bending adventures of time travelers, aliens both benevolent and oppressive, genetically evolved mutants, and ordinary men confronted with the responsibility of more power than they had any business trying to control.
The series The Outer Limits heralded the dawning of an extraordinary decade, reflected deeply and darkly on the Human Condition thus far, and gave us normally sheltered evening viewers the chance to entertain our early sixties innocent dark ponderings within the safety of our homes. Actually, this show scared the hell out of me as a 9-year old kid who built monster models and played with tape recorders, and I generally had to listen to it from the next room and ask my parents what was happening.
Flash forward to the future, or rather the present. This generous DVD set of, essentially, 32 short stories from one of the only series of that time which had SOMETHING TO SAY, gives us grown-up kids a chance to view these fantastic, visceral tales with some objectivity ...... and in many cases, the messages these pioneers of early cathode literature strove to put across still ring with what can only be described as a ""classic freshness"". Some seem bogged down and overly padded (""Children of Spider County"" is mostly about getting chased through the woods), others exhibit an almost painful economy (""A Feasibility Study"" makes one wish they'd gotten to know the characters more); like any considerable collection of short stories, you get a wide variety of stronger and weaker examples.
If you are a film buff, there is a whole other perspective: I can so see how the works of Spielberg, Cronenberg, Lynch, Gilliam, Zemeckis, Burton and many others must have been influenced by this weekly voyage to the brink. Dominick Frontiere's music scoring reminds me a lot of Howard Shore's work for David Cronenberg, and holds a permanent place in my incessant mental radio.
It is unfortunate that many people seem to have had technical problems with this release. I decided it was worth the chance, and so far have not experienced any such disruptions or poor quality on the episodes I've viewed, though I keep non-static tissue in the packaging to keep the discs from contacting each other when in storage (a little Solo-tip for ya there). Others have complained that you can't tell which side of which disc to put on to view choice episodes; just look closely at the small printing around the hub and you will see ""Volume#"" followed by a 7-digit number, the disc number, and side A or B.  So maybe you get a little eye strain .....
These minor issues aside, this collection of the original ""Outer Limits"" is a treasured addition to this viewer's library, one guaranteed to endure. I gave the new series at least two episodes' chance to hook me ...... I couldn't even begin to get interested in the slicked-up, digitized approach to the show I see on every other series these days. It made me wish there WAS something wrong with my ""television set"". Something about the dark, grainy, blurry grayscale world of early TV just worked somehow more closely with the energy of these tales ..... not to mention the underlying paranoia and anxiety awakening us suburban Americans from our squeaky-clean innocence of the time. These apprehensive awakenings needed a voice, a public forum. And for many of us, The Outer Limits was that forum. Time and repeated viewings will prove this dramatic, quirky and provocative series to be one of the more (if not only) important and influential contributions such a severely compromised medium as commercial television may have made to our culture.
It's inspiring to see TV get away with this sort of thing once in awhile. I'm still waiting for the next time, when the Control Voice calls to us once more.",1041638400,,4383,4.8990578734858685

The first season stories generally had a ""monster of the week"" storyline that was often set in the present or future. The series itself is a lot of fun to watch. The ""monsters"" probably wouldn't frighten even the smallest of children today so the whole family can watch the show. My teenagers get a kick out of seeing the ""fake monsters"". But that's part of the fun.

I had the same problem when I returned it and exchanged it for a new set. But the third time was a charm. I had no more skipping or problems. The only reason I don't give this review 5 stars is because of the poor quality of the disks. That's a shame because this series deserves better treatment.

1728032,4,B000068V9R,"When the original 1960's tv series ""The Outer Limits"" premiered (9/63).  We were in the middle of cold war, presidential assasination, space exploration & Vietnam.  Bottomline we were very paranoid and open to any ideas that could possibly answer our questions.
This innovated tv series provided many immediate feedings of the endless possibilties in the direction the United States and the world was going.
""The Outer Limits"" is a flashback into the worlds mind of 1963 - 65.  This double layer / double sided 4 DVD set provides us 32 - 50 minute episodes in chronological order of their original tv broadcast.  No extras or commentary are provided.
Again, this is alot of 1960's scifi drama.  Only the true hardcore series fan could endure this amount of ""The Outer Limits"" .  There are some outstanding episodes such as; ""The Hundred Days of the Dragon"" - A foreign agent whose features are transformed by a serum to allow him to become anyone including the President of the United States.  ""The Architects of Fear"" -  A U.S. scientist medically is altered to become an Alien to force the world to unite to defend itself against invading aliens.  ""Nightmare"" - Aliens assist our government in conditioning our military against POW torturing.  ""The Zanti Misfits"" - Alien prisoners are sent to earth as an invading force because they cannot kill their own, but we can!  ""Second Chance"" - 7 passengers on an amusement park flying saucer ride take a real journey into space to help avert a galactic catastrophe!
This a definite rental for a taste of this scifi experience.  27 plus hours is alot of time to spend trying to discover which episode to enjoy.  The set does come with a nice booklet providing nice information about each episode.  This saves time and lets you focus on your specific interests.
Outstanding Full Screen digitally remastered picture & sound.
I recommend this for a rental first, before buying because there are alot of episodes which can be overlooked and forgotten.  If you are a diehard fan this is for you.  Enjoy.",1036713600,14,2043,4.844380403458214

They had all the time in the world to create a top of the line product, but seem to have put little thought and effort into this collection.  Tis' a pity.

1728034,3,B000068V9R,"Often, when I was a child, I watched The Outer Limits when I was supposed to be asleep, taking care that my dad did not see me peering at it from the top of the stairs while he watched it on the Zenith vacuum tube black-and-white TV set. When that control voice told me to sit quietly, I did - I was too afraid not to. Though the monsters caused me to have a few nightmares, I was fascinated by the electronic equipment shown in the episodes of the series, and I was fascinated by television itself, which seemed miraculous to me - pictures and sound out of thin air, you know. Now, I have designed and built custom electronic hardware and systems most of my life, and I am an amateur recording engineer, inspired by all the marvelous things I saw (or thought I was seeing) all those years ago while watching The Outer Limits. If you love classic science fiction with a point, The Outer Limits original series should definitely be in your collection.
Prior to its release, I sent at least five earnest requests to MGM trying to convince them to publish the series on DVD. When I heard they were going to do so, I immediately pre-ordered it. Unfortunately, I think the folks at MGM may not understand the audience for this DVD product. I wanted the series on DVD so it would be as close to a perfect recording as possible. The disk set I purchased is not. I have seen severe problems in one episode rendering the recording useless (No, it is not scratched - Duh). Two different DVD players, one of which is new and quite expensive, were unable to play this episode properly. Another episode has continuous audio problems that sound like severe digital saturation, or clipping. My MGM VHS tape of this episode does not have this problem. I am hoping that MGM will re-think their approach to this product, so here goes. Dear MGM - I will be happy to pay four times the asking price to get all of the episodes of the series recorded carefully and properly with a significantly lower digital compression ratio. Please re-release the entire series in a special 2-episodes-per-disk edition for serious collectors. (Contact me - I'll help you do the collector's edition mastering and/or QC free of charge.)

1728057,5,B000068V9R,"ABC execs, who had probably bitten on the TOL concept because of The Twilight Zone's popularity, very shortly ""understood"" that The Outer Limits' gimmick and ticket to popularity was a new scary monster every week. The series' masterminds, Leslie Stevens and Joseph Stafano, were basically under orders, if they wanted their ambitious little anthology series underwritten by the network, to accomodate a parade of latex appliance monstrosities to please the network. Thus, thoughtful speculative drama was retrofitted with ghastly monsters. Sometimes it seems unforced, sometimes the tail wags the dog; there are episodes one can't imagine existing outside the pretext to show a cool monster creation.
By sheer numbers, this is how a lot of casual fans have remembered the series, as a place of '50s low budget style monsters. This is understandable, because many of them were children when it was first on, and they would not have been attuned to anything beyond the monsters. But one of the problems with embracing it as merely a monster show is that, factoring in the standards of today's SFX, the series would soon be forgotten if that is all it had going for it. Lucky for us, David Schow's book The Outer Limits Companion makes a convincing case for the adult depth and breadth of the show. The show will live on, appreciated in a new way by the ones who saw it the first time without being able to penetrate the surface, and by a new audience which will understand, thanks in no small part to Schow's fine book, the full dimension of the series.
There are some of my favorite ""serious"" episodes here: The Bellero Shield (a fantastic episode-- with a moment of real horror, btw-- inspired by Macbeth); The Man Who Was Never Born (a high concept SciFi drama which could, along with Soldier, have provided the core inspiration for the original Terminator film); Don't Open Till Doomsday (that takes an odd-looking alien, and proceeds to tell a haunting gothic tale of repressed ids that could have come from Wm. Faulkner's pen); The Architects of Fear (a broad, altruistic plan to promote peace between the all peoples of earth inadvertently crushes one specific couple's lives and love in this, one of the series' high tragedies).
I, for one, am completely delighted this series is surfacing again in DVD. Let's hope it is received by new viewers as something other than that which it really never was, as conceived by Stefano and Stevens: a low-budget SFX monster show. Far from being just a show for children, TOL stands as one of the most thoughtful shows of the weighted-toward-drama early '60s, a time not long before TV retooled into an exclusive venue for sitcoms.",1035590400,6,2676,4.89647577092511
1728058,1,B000068V9R,"everyone has heard of the original outer limits....i had no idea it was because of how bad it was....i bought the 12 episodes of the new series and loved every episode, plus i have never seen an episode of the original ""TWILIGHT ZONE"" that i did not like. So not being totally familiar with the original series of the outer limits (other than an occasional episode from when i was younger) i said to myself ""HOW CAN I GO WRONG?"" well i found out ....BIG TIME! i literally had to force myself to watch the whole first disc...and then scimming through other episodes to see rocks conspiring to take over the planet,dust balls turning into energy with attitude...i had to say enough! the original series and the new series are like night and day. they differ in almost every way you can imagine.
  while watching the original series i could almost imagine the president of whatever studio walking into a meeting  of some of his soap opera writers and saying ""WELL BOYS TWILIGHT ZONE IS BEATING US IN THE RATINGS SO STARTING TOMORROW YOUR ALL SCI-FI WRITERS"" and then hearing the befuddled cries and whispers.....""but i failed science"".
  while i can't see this appealing to anyone the episodes are well acted ...poorly written, but well acted. this is sci-fi for the star wars crowd(not a recommendation) not the star trek or star gate crowd. it is basically a soap opera in a science setting (i use science very loosly).
  it borders on ridiculous and unplausable.every episode was a chore to watch...i can't believe TWILIGHT ZONE did in a half hour with next to no special effects what these writers could not with an extra 15 minutes and obviously bigger budget.
it is easy to see why this was a short lived program. what was it 49 episodes total....thats 48and a 1/2 too many.
the only good thing i can think about this show is that it spawned a worthy successor.....stay away at all costs stay away.",1035072000,2,1901,4.6398809523809526
1728059,4,B000068V9R,"Let me start by debunking some of the problems with the quality of this presentation. I've had NO episodes out of the first dozen that have had audio drop-outs or out of synch voices. I think it could be likely there are bad batches of these floating around, but I didn't get one, maybe you won't either. As far as disc's that scratch too easily, thats also untrue, if you take care of what you buy, you're safe. My set came with a handsome pamphlet outlining each show, I thought I had read this show came with NO packaging, again, untrue.
Now...
THE BREAKDOWN
I have to say for what I paid for this on an auction site and what I got are staggering contradictions. 30 hours of some great sci-fi for ten dollars more than the hours? Amazing. I must say however that the quality of writing and performances vary wildly from show to show. It may anger some to know that I think the Twilight Zone is a much better show overall. The Outer Limits OFTEN is as good but the problem is casting and script just aren't as consistant. A show like Soldier is so engaging while a show like Fun and Games is almost unwatchable, tedious, and pointless. I just didn't find that in TZ. In TOL's defense it really seems to be a ""different"" show than TZ, going more for 50's B-movie type of thrills than genuine 60's movies type of chills.
WHOSE WHO?
This show is almost Star Trek reborn, we all know William Shatner is here (not on this set though), Leonard Nimoy, and James Doohan but how about Apollo? Yep from Who Mourns for Adonis, and in the same episode is Malena Moreau from the Mirror, Mirror episode. Dr. Crater from The Man Trap shows up in The Boarderlands (<--a very good ep), Sally ""The Walking Freezer Unit"" Kellerman from Where No Man Has Gone Before is in The Human Factor, and the Klingon from Day of the Dove is of coarse in Soldier (not on this set though). And I have only watched the first dozen or so!
In closing I must say I am thrilled and almost honored to own this. I was born 4 years after this show was made but saw and was glued to reruns in what had to be the early '70's. This show is part of my own ""family"" history in a way and has always been like family (to me anyway). I am glad they didn't pull a ""Paramount"" and release 2 episode discs like they pulled with Star Trek. My house is over-run with ST episode discs! They are like Tribbles! What is contained on this OL's boxset is what I have in 16 Volumes of Star Trek at 5 times the price, which is just awesome (shame on you Paramount).

1728061,5,B000068V9R,"The Outer Limits always demanded far more from its viewrs than similar series (e.g., Twilight Zone or the horrible Night Gallery). Part of the reason was that the network alowed nothing near the requested budget since theyt consider the series too offbeat.  The second season season suffered from even further reductions in production costs.  This goes a long way to explaining the cheesy costumes which is the only fault in the series.  The benefit though was scripts that demanded active viewer involvement as contrasted to passive involvement where the effects tell the story.  If this is understood the dreadful makeup of some of the aliens become inconsequential and easy to ignore while the absorbing dialogue drives the plot far better than effects ever could.
As the the DVDs themselves...I've noticed a number of complaints about video or audio quality or both.  My sense is this a function of the player since on my player (Pioneer) the transfer is crystallibne and the audio is flawless.
One comment though is that the episodes consistently were filmed with odd lighting.  Not the high contrast of film noir but a disturbing ""shawdowness"" that was apparent even in bright daylit scenes.  I never understood how this was accomplished though it lent an eerir atmosphere that even full sun could not dissipate.  Perhaps this is what some of the reviewers are complaining about in the video transfer.  I have seen episodes on television and they all share this atmosphere.

1728083,5,B000068V9R,"I was a 13-year-old ZONE fan back when TOL hit the air, and saw this series back then as a definite second-place; the rubber-suit monsters were tres goofy, and the plotlines had logic holes so gaping that even a kid could detect them, hidden within TOL's huge weekly mound of pseudoscientific b.s. But I never missed an ep, just like the ZONE.
This release of TOL's first season looks a lot better than my memories of the show. The DVD transfer is crisp in most places, and where it isn't [as in shots that are supposed to be in deep space], it may well reflect the original composites -- this one was done on the cheap. What is still impressive over a forty-year span is the fabulous black & white photography on shoots that only lasted a few days, with inventive camera work and lighting that's as good as it gets on the fly. Also some heartfelt if sometimes histrionic performances from big names like Martin Landau, David McCallum, Donald Pleasance, Cliff Robertson, Robert Culp, Carroll O'Connor, Martin Sheen, Robert Duvall, and many more.
But the main revelation in 2002 is about those rubber suits. In more TOL eps than I recalled, the goofy beast is simply the headline; in those days you showed the monster in a cold opening, a short clip from the show you're about to see that acts like a splash panel in the comics. With 50-odd minutes per ep, TOL was able to take the time to develop characters and give you the boogeyman deeply in context with human beings. The prime example of this is ""The Architects of Fear,"" in which a bunch of suits decide to turn Robert Culp into an alien. You don't see the monster costume [which was so outre at the time that some station managers actually censored its scenes because they felt it would be too disturbing!] till the last few moments. The teleplay is about the *process*, and what it means to Culp's humanity. This m.o. is repeated again and again [of course, it's also much cheaper to shoot scenes of two folks talking, once you have the kids salivating over the incipient monster]. There's much more depth to the stories than I remember.
The creepy ant-convicts, David McCallum with a big brain, the buzzing space guy who talks over the video monitor [yep, the cheesy rubber suits did have a certain effect], they're all here, plus lots more that you don't remember. We have to wait till the second season [c'mon, MGM!] for TOL's finest [literal] hour, Harlan Ellison's ""Demon with a Glass Hand,"" but Leslie Stevens and Joseph Stefano were on fire here, and you get to watch them play.
One side note:
If you're at all interested in the original TOL, this thing is an incredible bargain. You get 32 50/51-minute eps [t.r.t. is 27:22:00 -- that's 27 *hours*] on four double-sided DVDs. Eight eps per flip-over disk. So answer me: *why are the ZONEs doled out on chintzy two-hour, four-ep disks*? Hey, whoever owns the ZONE: give us a big box release, season by season, perfectly ordered by broadcast date and crammed full like this one is. You will get some takers.",1032134400,,3021,4.617100371747212

I will put up ""Architects of Fear"" against any hour of programming on any network for sheer power.
BUT - that said, I've been through TWO sets of DVDs. The second is an inprovement over the first (where my Disc 1 had the same program on both sides of the disc), but both sets still suffer from poor audio synchronization. Just as an experiment, as soon as I noticed the bad synch, I stopped the DVD, then restarted it. Voila! It was synched! Why this should work is beyond me, unless there's a compression-induced problem with the audio track. But I imagine a lower-cost DVD player may ALWAYS have this problem.
Really - I like having the 32 episodes at a bargain price, but I wonder how many people will be upset over ""unplayable"" DVDs, and make the possibility of a Season 2 set negligible?

Well, since many others have commented about the program material I'll try focus on some of the technical aspects - after all the story lines do speak for themselves.
I'm happy to report the video encoding and compression on this set is excellent.  I watched and listened to the series on an AC3 equipped home theatre system.  The source deck was a JVC XV-S40BK DVD player which fed S-video and digital audio (optical) outputs to a JVC Audio/Video receiver and ultimately a 36"" Toshiba monitor.  Throughout playback I detected no residual video artifacts and was very pleased with the quality of the full screen picture composition.  There were absolutely no glitches in playback which I found to be most unusual given the amount of material on each DVD.
The audio playback was okay considering the age of the series, however there was some evidence of background audio compression pumping.  The production's audio limitations weren't severe enough to disturb one's listening enjoyment of the program material.
One aggravation was the difficulty in identifying which side of the DVD one was looking at since the discs are double sided and the inner ring print is so small.  Unless one has super eyesight the chances of selecting the right program set are 50/50.
All things considered the producer's have done a remarkable job with this release.  I love my set and am anxiously awaiting future releases!",1032048000,5,1554,4.915708812260537
1728107,5,B000068V9R,"I was overjoyed to learn that The Outer Limits was to join the ranks of classic TV shows currently receiving the DVD treatment, and even more enthusiastic to learn that MGM would release the set using a season format based on broadcast order. It is one of the great follies of the budding DVD age that The Twilight Zone has not received similar treatment by utilizing the storage capacity features of DVD. To say that the release of Rod Serling's sci-fi/fantasy masterpiece on DVD was done in a cumbersome, illogical fashion would be quite an understatement. Luckily, The Outer Limits avoids this travesty by offering the public a set encompassing the entire first season in original broadcast order. Despite frequent comparisons, I've always felt that The Outer Limits and The Twilight Zone were completely different types of shows. While the Twilight Zone asked viewers to imagine human beings visiting other planets, The Outer Limits required the viewer to imagine that these humans were already intricately involved in governmental plots with the planet's inhabitants designed to understand the behavioral patterns inherent in earth soldiers amidst planetary wars. The thematic structure of OL always asked more of the viewer than Zone did, in my opinion. Just a few thoughts to add regarding this box set, in light of the many well written Outer Limits reviews already present on amazon.com- I found the audio and visual dvd transfer to be very good, with a few minor exceptions/complaints. I felt that certain episodes displayed quite a bit of graininess in some scenes as well as noticeable light infraction during scenes utilizing deep darks, such as outer space scenes. Most notably were most of the scenes in ""The Man Who Was Never Born"", starring Martin Landau. For instance, during the scene in which the mutated Andro shows the space traveler the great library at the beginning of the episode, I observed the darkness of the library doors to be quite grainy and ""off-black"". I noticed quite a bit of grain present in much of the episode's other scenes involving dark backgrounds as well. Other episodes that I noticed this problem with included The Zanti Misfits (close-up ant scenes were very grainy), Nightmare (most of the very dark scenes were grainy) and Second Chance (scene where Empyrian is tackled to the floor by irate passenger was very grainy). I have videotaped episodes from the series when they aired on TNT Monster Vision back in the early 90s. After comparing the DVD to these VHS shows (which were showing their age), I concluded that this graininess was not present on the video taped shows. In fact, I would venture to guess that the overall visual quality of the show is slightly better on 1960s episodes currently being aired on the scifi channel than on the DVD set. To many viewers this graininess may be considered very minor, however, I was able to notice it without too much scrutiny. Other than these minor complaints, the visual transfer is quite good. Regarding the potential for the release of the 2nd season (which has not been confirmed by MGM yet), I think this future release is implied by the 1st season set, which is labeled ""Volume 1"". It would not make sense to indicate a volume number on the first season set if a subsequent edition was not in the works. Also, I do not think that MGM could have fit any bonus material into this set, considering the number of episodes presented here on a mere 4 discs. Hopefully, MFG will take advantage of the 17-episode second season by releasing bonus material in that set. One last comment- I noticed that another reviewer mentioned the first season soundtrack, which is available via CD on GNP/Crescendo records. I highly recommend this soundtrack to any Outer Limits fan who has found themselves enthralled by the exceptional orchestral work of Domonic Frontiere. Much like Bernard Herrmann's work for The Twilight Zone acted as an inseparable and essential aspect which made the show work, Frontiere's musical contributions to The Outer Limits were just as important as anything done by Leslie Stevens or Joe Stefano.",1031875200,4,4112,4.952243125904486
1728108,5,B000068V9R,"The Outer Limits was one of my favorite shows as a kid- so receiving this boxed set in the mail yesterday was a real thrill. I was wondering beforehand if the anticipation I had experienced would be worth the wait. Well, I was not disappointed! As I sat down to watch the opening episode, I got goose bumps all over again as I saw the the blank screen give way to the waves and test pattern and buzzing frequency sound. THE VOICE announced (with great authority), that ""We will control all that you see and hear!"" The music soundtrack was just as impressive and forbidding as I remember it being in 1963. The glorious black and white picture came through with crystal clarity. I then sat back and enjoyed a tale well told.
I would highly recommend this set to anyone who enjoys top-notch TV entertainment-as well as anyone who is considering buying the ""new"" Outer Limits shows on disc. Check out this set FIRST, so you can see how sci-fi should really be done (at least on the small screen). You will not be disappointed!
This boxed set now sits in the RESERVED section of my DVD shelf- that area which is set apart for shows such as ""The Prisoner"", certain Hitchcock movies, and Criterion Collection films.

1728110,5,B000068V9R,"It's 1963. Imagine a family gathered around a television set in their kitchen. Now imagine a 4 year old watching the show from behind the corner of the living room. This 4 year old bravely tries to watch this unusual, thought provokingly original science fiction television show. That kid would be me and the show would be The Outer Limits.
Although I'd prefer to see both volumes available at once, this is a great place to start enjoying this highly influential series. Even without season two's best episodes (Demon with a Glass Hand is the most notable), the first season is, for the most part, first rate. The series creator the late Leslie Stevens (who wrote and directed a lot of great and not-so-great television)and writer/producer Joseph Stefano (Psycho) managed to produce 32 high quality episodes with writers such as Stefano, Anthony Wilson (The Man Who Was Never Born)and Jerome Ross (The Man With THe Power). Amazingly, Stefano wrote or co-wrote 8 or 9 of the first season episodes (two of which areThe Bellero Shield and A Feasibility Study and among the best as well)
Featuring Academy Award winning actors Martin Landau, Robert Duvall and talented performers such ; Donald Pleasance Barry Morse, Carrol O'Conner,Edward Asner, Sally Kellerman, Leonard Nimoy, Vera Miles and David McCallum, the acting was always top notch even if the script or direction wasn't quite all there. For a talented up and coming performer, The Outer Limits was the series to be seen on.
The optical effects are pretty primiative but were pretty high tech for television in 1963-4. Every episode has a memorable ""bear"" (as Joe Stefano and Leslie Stevens referred to the aliens in the show)that would either turn out to be realy nasty, misunderstood or a combination of both. Among the 5 star programs that hold up well today are : The Galaxy Being (with Cliff Robertson); The Man With THe Power; The Man Who Was Never Born; The Borderland; The Mice; The Chameleon (written by Robert Towne the writer of Chinatown)and The Forms of Things Unknown.
There are a number of others as well. While a couple have grown creaky with age (The 100 Days of the Dragon and the highly regarded The Zanti Misfits), they're still enjoyable and entertaining.
All 32 episodes are packed on 4 discs (two sides 4 episodes each side)and the packaging comes with a booklet with a synposis of the plot, credits and airdate. MGM has done a high class job on this DVD set. My only complaints are the lack of commentaries. Martin Landau (who appears in two episodes), Robert Culp and Joseph Stefano could have provided interesting commentary or at the very least insights on the durability of the show. Even a documentary retrospective would have been interesting. Perhaps that will come with the second batch of shows.",1031702400,7,2785,4.8900634249471455

This is the way ALL tv series on DVD should be released: Season at a time, and in the original broadcast order. Why couldn't they have released The Twilight Zone in this manner instead of only putting 3 - 4 episodes on a disc, and at RANDOM order, for [price range]a pop? The only way this boxed set could have been better is if the audio had been remastered into some type of ""stereo"" or ""simulated-stereo"" sound. The set retains the original mono audio track. Other than that, it is superb. There are 4 DVDs in this set and each disc is double-sided with 4 episodes on each side. I've only made it through the first 4 episodes and already I am looking forward to the second season release on DVD! By the way, there are 32 episodes in this boxed set. You'd expect the set to be 32 hours long then, right? WRONG! Just to show you how much time is ""wasted"" with commercials, the entire set runs at 27 hrs and 22 minutes long! That's a little less than FIVE HOURS worth of commercial time - and this is an early 60's TV show! Just imagine how much the commercial time would be if the show was new! At any rate, I would highly recommend buying this. It's worth every dollar!

  What is coming out on DVD is the entire FIRST season of the Outer Limits. Back in the good old days they actually produced 32 episodes per year.

Since then, occasional glimpses into that stark black and white world peopled with stars and monsters and questions and answers, both disturbing and tempting all at the same time.
A few years back, I began to collect the VHS releases, then the LaserDisc set, but it was prohibitively expensive at the time.  Now grubbing around on Ebay and occasionally landing a deal.
When I found out this series was going to be available on DVD, I dove in and ordered it.  To settle the debate over the content here is what I know:
There are a total of 1642 minutes of running time, now with 32 episodes in the set, that means 51 minutes and 31 seconds per episode, which figures, minusing out commercial slots.  There are 4 discs, double sided of course, so each side holds 8 episodes.  They are all there folks.  Now as to the number 32..yes there are more episodes, but these are the original 32 that were produced before plot disputes and directional differences forced a change in producers, resulting in less intersting episodes (in my opinion).

The show was well acted and scripted. Even the lesser shows like ""Behold Eck"" are enjoyable. The control voice of Vic Perrin says it all. ""You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to The Outer Limits!""",1025913600,,517,4.5
1728131,5,B000068V9R,"Executive producer Leslie Stevens created a show absolutely unique in the annals of television history, when he came up more than a third of a century ago with The Outer Limits.  The vast majority of its episodes concerned alien abduction, which wasn't popularly discussed for about another two decades.  Those few stories that didn't deal with that subject dealt instead with first contact scenarios, and did so in highly intelligent and mature fashion.  Stevens was himself a second generation military intelligence man, whose father was an MIT graduate admiral and the inventor of airplane arresting gear on aircraft carriers, begging the question of how many of Outer Limits' stories were derived from actual intelligence files on the UFO subject.
The scripts are all highly literate, and genuinely poetic.  The guest stars, almost all at that time virtual unknowns, include a roster of now-famous names:  Cliff Robertson, Robert Culp, David McCallum, Robert Duvall, Carroll O'Connor, William Shatner, Martin Sheen, Leonard Nimoy, Bruce Dern, Gloria Grahame, and Sally Kellerman, to name but a few.  Famous early film star Miriam Hopkins even lent her presence to ""Don't Open Till Doomsday,"" as a woman gone mad in lifelong service to an evil alien abductor.  Even the lesser entries spotlighted unique talents in fabulous performances, such as Joanna Frank in the role of a psychopathic invader attempting to create a hybrid human species with her own kind in ""Zzzzz,"" and Richard Ney  -  later famous for his own financial show, The Ney Report, on CNN  -  as an alien tutor of gifted Earth children, toward the purpose of serving as an invasion vanguard, in ""The Special One.""
Outer Limits served as a springboard in high places:  Harvard's drama department once performed the semi-prophetic OL script ""O.B.I.T.,"" about paranoiac government self-monitoring and spying, and Ronald Reagan twice used OL plots and phrases in his speeches, the ""anti-weapon"" of ""The Bellero Shield"" being his own term for the SDI Star Wars defense shield, and his proposition for extraterrestrial invaders uniting the U.S. and U.S.S.R. being the subject of ""The Architects of Fear.""
Aside from all these fascinating observations, the show itself  -  simply as a production  -  was superior.  OL's moody, stark black and white cinematography is now legendary.  The music scores, from Dominic Frontiere's and Harry Lubin's majestic opening theme strains to Robert Van Eps's unsettling melodramatic chords, was so effective that it was recycled in part by at least two other T.V. series  -  The Rat Patrol and The Invaders  -  and a small handful of now lesser-known horror movies.
This is a series simply not to be missed by any genuine student of sci-fi or horror cinema, or those more interested in intelligently examining the serious real-life questions of extraterrestrial contact.",1025395200,5,2868,5.229759299781182

7964824,5,B000068V9R,"In my adolescent years, we were devoted to two great science fiction tv shows, Twilight Zone and Outer Limits. (No, TZ wasn't purely sci-fi the way OL was, but let's not quibble. Rod did a lot of sci-fi.) One measure of how great they were is all the imitations they've spawned over the 50-odd years since, right up through Dark Mirror and Electric Dreams. Another measure is that none of the imitators has ever been as good. I'm with the TZ fanatics who argue it's still the best tv show ever, but I'm also a huge fan of OL. Yeah, the production values were chintzy, the effects rarely special, the creature outfits usually on a Halloween costume level. But we didn't care about that. The stories were good to great, and asked the kinds of Big Questions the best sci-fi used to ask in those pre-Star Wars dumbing-down days. The atmosphere of ""awe and mystery"" was very well maintained. The acting was generally very good, with a number of TZ crossovers like Robert Duvall, Warren Oates, Cliff Robertson. The music was in its own way as great as TZ's. There's no question that the best episodes are still some of the best tv sci-fi ever. And who can resist the Zanti Misfits?",1520467200,,1175,4.547169811320755

7964826,5,B000068V9R,"This was an installment in the series ""Outer Limits"" that has stayed in my memory since the 1960s! It is about a group of people who cannot leave the confines of an old house and its immediate surrounding property. The hero is a hitch hiker who becomes enamored of a dainty, wistful young woman living in the house. He convinces her to step past a gate in the back yard and she immediately turns into a skeleton, then to dust, then blows away in the wind. I always identified with that woman and have never forgotten her or the story. I was so pleased to find the entire installment on amazon! This was truly a blast from the past!",1508803200,,631,4.310924369747899
7964827,5,B000068V9R,"The episode called O.B.I.T. is more appropriate today then it was back then.  No monsters in this one, no weird plants, no visits to other planets, just ourselves and what we think about each other and do about it.",1508112000,,214,4.487179487179487
