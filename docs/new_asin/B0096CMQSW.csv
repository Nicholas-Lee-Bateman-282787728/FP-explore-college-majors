8536587,5,B0096CMQSW,"Learning to walk in stilettos can be a challenge all its own, but dancing in them? Stilettos are lovely, sexy and feminine, and every girl deserves a pair. Dusting off the beautiful pair of stilettos I purchased a year ago, I decided I would do more than look at them. Here I was I was in a pair of ""stilts"" and hoping for the best.

This dance program is led by Dana Foglia,a star choreographer who has worked with big name stars such as Beyonce, Janet Jackson, Rihanna.

The root menu features a warm up, and 4 combinations, a combinations practice, and a combinations performance.

The warm up features head and shoulder rolls, torso rotations, lower body isolations forward bends, followed by a section for strengthening the ankles with releves and plies, very helpful since stilettos require a weight shift to the balls of the feet. This is relatively easy conditioning section but important for strengthening before dancing in stilettos.

Combination 1 begins with the lovely trio demonstrating a high heel walking technique. Time to put on the stilettos,this is definitely fun and feminine, easy to learn. This section is a series of traveling steps described as slow walks and fast walks to trendy music. Dana defines hand placement, slinky hip rolls, lovely hand gestures to frame the body, and using the correct form for the feet.
Combination 2. A sexy dance, all about staccato movement/quick range of motion, deep torso rotations, and upper body contractions.
Combination 3.  Challenging as it incorporates dramatic floor work and very deep, full body undulations.
Combination 4. Slinky, sexy combination yet somewhat repetitious movement from the above combinations.

The combinations practice places all dance sequences together which evolve into 4 dramatic music video style choreography.

This is a follow along program. It does not elaborate in-depth technique on form or movement. All together it is fun to watch, learn, and to use in club dancing, all in beautiful stilettos.",1381536000,6,1994,5.116923076923077
