4904115,5,B005Y2HXAY,I'm so glad I was finally able to see this gem. The scene in the men's locker room is off the sexy charts!,1364342400,,106,3.652173913043478
4904116,4,B005Y2HXAY,"But overall, I wouldn't really consider it a gay movie.  More a movie about relationships.  Someone was having sex with a man and a women.  He just didn't realize they were married to each other.  He does find out and somehow they all get along.  It happens, but not my kind of movie.  Still it was well done.",1360886400,2,309,4.241379310344827

4904120,5,B005Y2HXAY,"What a cheerful honest and clever movie. If a ""mnage a trois"" will make everybody happy, why not? That's the conclusion of the movie but there's more to it of course. It's about the freedom of exploring your desires without guilt even if you we're not aware of them five minutes ago, it's about life being short, fragile and shifting. At the end of the movie, the smile on my face lasted for a long while...",1349568000,4,407,4.368421052631579
4904121,5,B005Y2HXAY,"I hardly know where to start in saying how great this movie is, because it is so wonderful in so many ways.

For one, it has single-handedly redeemed the entire concept of German comedy for me. I must have watched at least a dozen German comedies and been so thoroughly bewildered by them all that I came to the conclusion that for me the words ""German"" and ""funny"" simply could not coexist in the same sentence unless the word ""not"" was in there too. This fantastic movie has blown that idea out of the water forever.

But this movie is far more than subtly but very funny; it is also a story of three likable, ordinary people who wander almost by accident into an unconventional but very satisfying (for them and for the audience) arrangement in which everybody wins and nobody loses.

The remaining mystery for me is why people feel obliged to judge other people's behavior when that behavior is not hurting anyone, and when the people they are judging are not even real people but characters in a movie. What tiny, empty lives they must lead. God help the people those viewers actually know in real life; I'd hate to be deluded into thinking they were my friends.",1334102400,8,1167,4.5476190476190474
4904122,5,B005Y2HXAY,"Writer/director Tom Twyker (Run Lola Run, Perfume, Heaven, The International. Paris, je t'aime) is proving to be one of the most fearless and creative talents in film today. He knows how to create strange stories that take us by surprise, present them with excellent actors, selects and composes musical scores that are as perfect as any being created, introduces just enough philosophy and scientific investigation into timely topics to challenge our brains, and tops it off with inventive photography - superimposing split screens that enhance not only the progress of the story but also allow the presentation of brief glimpses of `dangerous' ideas that stirs the cauldron to boiling.

3 is a fascinating tale. Simon (Sebastian Schipper) is an artistic architect who works with sculptors to bring their art into being. He is in a longterm relationship with Hanna (Sophie Rois) who is a television journalist cum scientist who is widely popular in their hometown of Berlin. Simon and Hanna are in their forties and deeply in love. Simon is informed that his mother has advanced pancreatic carcinoma and when his mother attempts suicide with an overdose and fails, she is brain dead, supported on machines. Simon stays at her bedside while Hanna continues her line of investigation about new stem cell theories, attending lectures by the handsome Adam (Devid Striesow) - a married man with children who leads a separate life of clandestine but shortlived gay affairs. Simon's mother dies and Simon is diagnosed with testicular carcinoma, undergoes an orchiectomy and begins chemotherapy, losing his hair in the process. All of this he shares with Hanna: the two decide they probably should marry and Hanna wants children while Simon thinks world timing is poor for starting a family (he is also aware of the fact that his operation and chemotherapy may represent the end of his sexuality and fertility).

Though devoted to Simon, Hanna is attracted to Adam and finds ways to be near him. Soon they are in a physical love affair. Simon recovers his disease by swimming in a beautiful Berlin gym where he quite incidentally meets Adam, shares his operation with the stranger in the locker room, and Adam proceeds to demonstrate that Simon is indeed not impotent! Simon has new feelings aroused, and he and Adam begin a love affair. Hanna and Simon get married but still each of them has feelings for Adam. When Hanna discovers she is pregnant the story spins to its conclusion and the triptych of the title is established.

This film is subtle but frank, explores sexuality in an open and honest way exploring themes relevant to our time: the biological and the ethical side of human life, the determinist way of viewing our sexuality and gender, the ways in which we define our selves in a time with shifting mores, the chance of love in a society with few if any boundaries. Love affairs as demonstrated between Hanna and Simon, Hanna and Adam, and Simon and Adam are treated equally and sensitively.

The three primary actors are excellent as is the entire cast. The cinematography and film manipulation by Frank Griebe (with Twyker) and the musical score Reinhold Heil, Johnny Klimek, Gabriel Isaac Mounsey, and Tom Tykwer (with a little help from Debussy and others!) is splendid. This is a first class film and deserves the attention of a very wide audience. It is likely to be one of those films that grows in stature with the passage of time.

4904123,4,B005Y2HXAY,".....strangely philosophical and sometimes wondrous take on the Lives & Loves of men and women in today's world.  BUT, hold on a sec...hasn't the behavior we are being shown likely EVER been so....even in humankind's earliest days, in the dark protectiveness of caves?  Well, whether that is the case or not...now and today, a most perceptive Director of Film (Tom Tykwer) is giving us a stripped bare view into the lives of 2 Men and 1 Woman....the ""3"" who make up this proverbial TRIANGLE.  So, you need only sit back...relax...then watch and see:  ....Their discovery, first, of love with one another----then, finally, a loving-union of the ""3"".

I cannot tell you that the Male-Female Hook-up (can we call it ""illicit"") being shown us is any differently played out than in 100s of movie stories which have come before.  BUT...on the other hand, and strikingly so, it is in the Male / Male ""Connection"" where you will find the Difference in this film.  In a mainstream production such as this, rarely will you ever see shown Physically Realistic (and Tender) lovemaking between 2 men....being presented in such a forthright manner.  Devid Striesow (""Adam"") and Sebastian Schipper (""Simon"") absolutely ""ZING"" in their scenes together.  The word, Hot, does not describe it; though if written as HOT, perhaps it begins to do so.  (WORD OF ADVICE:  Director Tykwer's use of ""split screen"" techniques throughout, sometimes showing 4 to 6 activities occuring in one scene/shot, makes some of the ""HOT actions"" a bit difficult to follow and fully enjoy.  Better you watch on video....rather than in the theater.)

As to the movie's performers and their abilites, these ""3"" actors are highly competent and experienced (extensive film histories)....though perhaps not being in the paparazzi-pursued, top tier of German celebs.  YET, what they truly are is BELIEVABLE....bringing you to a point of SUDDENLY realizing their characters' origin:  ....Perhaps from Earth's First Garden----but here we are being given a ""Hanna""...a ""Simon""....and, most especially, ""The Enticer"".  So...this Enticer; what can be said about him?  Maybe just this, Reader Mine:  ....When your self-image is at its lowest...and your need to be desired is at its highest, just stop and look around you.  HE's out there, close by....waiting, waiting to enfold you in Tenderness and Excitement.  Waiting to make the rest of your life its very Happiest.

I'll say Goodbye to you now...upon leaving this Garden of ""3"".  And concede that this story may, perhaps, contain instances of possibly over-dramatized familial and midlife crises---not to mention startling images of a male medical procedure.  Nevertheless, this is a work which I will be re-watching on a somewhat regular basis---concentrating on the Male / Male action, of course.  (Uh..oh).

PS:  For those interested, see the excellent Devid Striesow in the very good and ""gay-tinged"" 2004 film production:  ""BEFORE THE FALL"".  That is, IF you can find it available as a rental; used DVD copies are going for a high price.  Oh, and for something very ""different""...but very well done (in a ""straight"" love story mode), try Tykwer's 2002 ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heaven/dp/B004SUDQBS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heaven</a>"" (Cate Blanchett).  You, likely, will not be sorry.

PPS:  Don't forget about signing up for ""DVD Release Notification"", here at Amazon.com....if you are interested in viewing 2011's, perhaps, most celebrated gay-themed releases:  ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Weekend-Blu-ray/dp/B005WIE2R2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Weekend [Blu-ray</a>]"".  GOOD TIP:  If you own an All-Regions DVD Player, this release will become available on March 19, 2012, at Amazon.com United Kingdom (click Link at bottom of this page).",1329264000,14,3842,5.611111111111111
4904124,5,B005Y2HXAY,"I was very excited and thankful to this film's director, Tom Tykwer, for surprising me again. Like the characters in his movie, as a film buff I was also getting bored with the choices available both in commercial and arthouse cinemas around, until I saw ""3"" (a.k.a. ""Drei"", three in German). I left the cinema in a state of grace after seeing this well acted, beautifully written, bold, inquisitive, provocative film, as it deals with assumptions on people's sexuality and the labels we like to give ourselves, our need to categorize behaviour and sexual identity and it does it in a very thorough, honest way. It's a brave film, not afraid to go deep into its subject and to expose its characters, but whilst doing it, it's not at the same time some intelectual, cold, moral lesson. Much the opposite, if anything, it's against hypocritical false morality or simply standard dramas on how badly adultery can end as seen in examples like ""Fatal Attraction"", 'Unfaithful"" and ""Indecent Proposal"", all of which scary and simplistic morality tales on how one shouldn't even contemplate a look at sex outside marriage, let alone involving homosexuality.
Speaking of which, this film also takes a fresh look on sexual drives and sees the adventure with the same sex not as a life altering, sexual identity changing experience, after which you are officially gay, but as a natural curiosity satisfaction, one that is handled without feelings of guilt or macho crisis; dealt with naturality. Sex here is seen as a tool for pleasure, not as something which says who you are, but simply what you can do.
But the film's subject matter is not delivered in a heavy, preachy way; it's shot and edited in a fun, exciting way, so the whole thought brainstorm is great to look at and listen to, by the way music is used on the film, also a collaboration created between Tom Tykwer and 3 other musicians. They did a great job and used David Bowie's ""Space Oddity"" in the soundtrack to great effect.
Great, exilarating movie. Bravo, Mr. Tom Tykwer, and thank you!",1325635200,31,2046,4.798866855524079

4904131,4,B005Y2HXAY,At first I wanted to root for the dissolution of the breeder marriage and the rise of the same-sex partnership. I fully expected the more conventional denouement for a film of this type. But was I ever surprised! Nothing conventional about this film. I would give away the ending except to say that it is a happy ending and yet completely out of the box. Worth your time to watch.,1380499200,,380,4.442857142857143

8489010,5,B005Y2HXAY,"I love this film. Well written, authentic and open, emotional, and ultimately hopeful.

I've watched the entire film a few times, some individual scenes more than that. All three of the leads communicate their character's emotions and thoughts in both words and looks. When you know someone well, words aren't always necessary and often insufficient. On the flip side, in meeting someone new, words often don't present themselves, while actions are just as good at posing questions and taking chances.

Serious life subjects are examined, both emotional and physical. They're connected, obviously, especially when one makes you realize how important the other is.

Life is short. Don't shortchange yourself, go for it. Especially if it means getting and sharing the love and support you want.",1506211200,2,792,5.32

8489014,4,B005Y2HXAY,"""3"" was really very good.  It wasn't what I expected ... at all, and I didn't expect it to be as good as it turned out to be.  It was very artsy!  I really liked some of the artsy scenes in it, that was kind of a throwback to old film days.  Also, there was a solid story there.  One actually gets into the story, which had moments of sadness, profound sadness actually - and moments of hot action - both heterosexually and homosexually.  I can't say that the characters were necessarily ""attractive"" - in a Hollywood glamour sense - but maybe that's what helped to make it as good as it was, the characters didn't look like two Ken dolls and a Barbie, and quite frankly, they didn't act that way either.  There are very few of these gay themed ""Strand Releasing"" type movies that I'd watch again, ""Strapped"" is one, ""Eyes Wide Open"", ""Out In The Dark"", ""The Bubble"" and ""Free Fall"" to name a few are films that left enough of an impression on me that I'd watch them again. I will add ""3"" to that list.",1434844800,,1002,4.242105263157895
8489015,5,B005Y2HXAY,"One of my all time favorite movies. Watched this on a whim and was pleasantly surprised.
