8251628,5,B0013KSVCA,"This is my first attempt to build a twin core Pentium computer. As a novice, this video was very helpful in building my new home station.

It was basic, which is what I needed. I think it would be too slow for computer person; but for someone without any in-depth knowledge - perfect!",1259798400,,284,4.3584905660377355
8251629,1,B0013KSVCA,"If you know nothing about building computers or Linux this will not help you understand either one...you can build the computer they build (but you won't understand any better) and that's about it.  If you know ANYTHING about computers this is too basic for you.  Basically 2 guys recording themselves putting together a computer.  They leave out a lot of key material and helpful hints and the recording is very choppy.  This is not worth having if it were free.  I have 3 books on computers and the oldest of them is more helpful.  Don't buy it, it's two guys who figured they could make some money without working.  And I guess they did...a real shame.

The people selling this dvd are leaving reviews of their products (all 5 star-go figure), I think you should know this as it is shady and skews the buyer reviews.  I repeat with vehemence...This dvd is JUNK!  The sellers were posting to my post, but erased their posts when I pointed out that they were the supplier.  Don't trust them.

Buy ""Building the Perfect PC, Second Edition"" or a newer edition if it's available...at least they have a website available to stay current with changing technology.",1255478400,,1175,4.705882352941177
8251630,4,B0013KSVCA,"This video is not a professional grade training video, it is a step above a home video of a guy putting together all the major components of a computer.  For about 10 bucks plus shipping, it is well worth the purchase and it gives you a good sense of what it takes to build your own system.  I bought this video along with ""Built it, fix it, own it"" by Paul McFedies, which in my opinion, is the best book out there for building a PC.",1248048000,,434,4.034883720930233
