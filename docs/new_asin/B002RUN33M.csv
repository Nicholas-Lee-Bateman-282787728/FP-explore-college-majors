Several schools are changing things, firing the corporate caterers. Our kids deserve real food and caring parents who will make sure they get it.",1525046400,,303,4.735849056603773
8378878,5,B002RUN33M,Awesome and so much knowledge! I used to work for the school lunch program and after that  I never allowed my kids to eat on the cafeteria. They have been brown bagging since the 6th grade. It's expensive for us. But we do it.,1472256000,,226,4.136363636363637

8378880,5,B002RUN33M,Very Informative on helping to change what is offered to our children in schools. I suggest this movie to anyone who is interested in making a change in his or her community.,1396224000,,174,4.46875
8378881,5,B002RUN33M,"I attended the Green Schools National COnference in West Palm Beach, FL in February 2013. This film was screened there and a forum for participants to ask the two moms questions was opened after the film. I missed this particular seminar, so I wanted to watch it at home. SO GLAD that I did. If you want to team up with parents to CHANGE school lunches in your local area, this film is an EXCELLENT resource! They outline the steps to take, the roadblocks you will likely encounter and ways to work WITH the local schools and local businesses to persevere! Simple yet eloquent. Definitely worth your time & money.",1366329600,,613,4.581818181818182
8378882,5,B002RUN33M,Worth looking at and then you will be angry with the information your learn. Well worth it!! Let's do something to change this!,1348617600,,127,4.565217391304348
8378883,1,B002RUN33M,What a yawner! I expected some useful information about school lunches. All this film does is advise viewers about forming committees and taking action. And the film is not even well made. It really looks like a collage of scenes put together. Skip it.,1341532800,2,252,4.75
