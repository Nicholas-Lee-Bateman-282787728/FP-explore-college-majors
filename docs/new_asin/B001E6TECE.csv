3546675,1,B001E6TECE,was not a movie as I thought only 27 minutes long still looking for a movie of the monkeys paw,1394496000,,94,3.75
3546676,4,B001E6TECE,"Certainly a big improvement on the long-winded 1948 black-and-white movie starring Megs Jenkins.  This color version sticks closely to the theme of the original short story but adds a few bells and whistles.  For example we see in the final segment the awesome consequences for the unfortunate ""wisher"" of ordering someone brought back to life who is then almost immediately consigned back to the grave.  The atmospherics and music are first-rate and the flashbacks to India are convincingly portrayed.  Personally I still think there is scope for a full-length feature film on this subject with more gruesome examples of what happens to those who meddle with fate.",1376611200,2,665,5.186915887850467
3546677,5,B001E6TECE,"This is quite a treat.  Great effects and cinematography and the acting is really quite good.  Very epic and Tim Burton-esque. Not sure about the other comment on it being antiquated, unless she meant to review an older version.  This is obviously newer with the cg effects that help give a spooktacular atmosphere.  Being a fan of the short story, I was nicely surprised how faithful it is and how dramatic it took it.  Definitely a good watch and a great piece to share with those just discovering the short story.",1342656000,7,516,4.626373626373627
3546678,1,B001E6TECE,"I am sorry I purchased this product.  It was short...I guess I didn't realize when I purchased it.  I purchased it based upon another review, but was so very disappointed.  It was so antiquated that my students didn't get much out of it.",1339977600,,237,4.465116279069767
3546679,4,B001E6TECE,"great movie, only short just 25 min...I remember the old black and white movie..both are very scary ....this remake done well...",1332115200,6,128,5.142857142857143
3546680,5,B001E6TECE,I saw this film at a Horror Film festival in Los Angeles and it was a big hit!  Really good production value for a low-budget independent film and a haunting interpretation of a time honored classic!  The strength of the film is it's collection of solid performances.  Watch indie actor Josh Burns as he gives a really good performance as the husband.  What would YOU wish for with the Monkey's Paw?  Be careful... YOU JUST MIGHT GET IT!!!,1319241600,10,439,4.576923076923077
3546681,1,B001E6TECE,"The quality of this DVD is extremely low to the point that it is extremely difficult to understand. Unfortunately, this DVD is the only one available so the viewer has no choice. As a high school English teacher, I like to supplement reading literature with a movie adaptation. This movie follows the story line closely, but the pleasure of the viewing experience is greatly diminished because the sound is so difficult to understand and the overall cinematography is really bad.",1318377600,2,479,5.0
3546682,1,B001E6TECE,"Having seen the old black and white version of the story, I was eager to see the DVD.  I only had a few days to order it since the end of the school year loomed ahead of me, so I ordered it on Amazon.com and paid for special one-day shipping.  Since I teach Freshman and eighth grade English, I like to show movies that back up the literature we're reading.  Imagine my disappointment when I showed this video.  Not only were the images blurry, but the sound was garbled!  My students could barely understand the dialogue.  I tried the DVD in another player with the same results.  I certainly hope that Amazon.com refunds my purchase.  This is the FIRST time I have ever had a problem with ANYTHING I've ordered from Amazon.com.  I was disappointed and embarrassed that the movie was so poorly produced.",1306281600,2,804,4.527777777777778
3546683,5,B001E6TECE,"This is very true to the story, and as a Teacher, after teaching the story, this was a nice way to wrap it up.",1289520000,,110,3.625
3546684,4,B001E6TECE,This DVD does go along with our textbook story used in our English class. The students said it also helped them to visualize the story much better. They especially enjoyed the DVD being shown immediately before Halloween. The time frame of the DVD works well in our 42 minute class leaving enough time for a brief introduction and necessary closure.,1259280000,16,349,4.833333333333333

8296836,5,B001E6TECE,This was great for a low budget film. I read the book a few months ago and this adaptation didn't disappoint.,1461283200,,109,4.238095238095238
