7836122,5,6303020151,I grew up a Braves fan and will die a Braves fan...but the 1991 Braves will probably always be my favorite team. This is a must have for any Braves fan as it shows the ups and downs of the 1991 season with the Atlanta Braves eventually going from last place to first place in the old National League West and earning a trip to the 1991 World Series. I just wished they offered this in DVD.,1342310400,,389,4.064935064935065
7836123,5,6303020151,"1991 was the most magnificent year of baseball I've ever seen. Braves fans felt the rush of exhilaration as their also-ran baseball team was in a pennant race. The Braves made up a nine game deficit at the All-Star break, a two game deficit with six to play, and a 3-2 games deficit to the Pirates in the NLCS - to go to the World Series. In the ultimate irony, they lost when having a 3-2 lead heading back to Minnesota.
You get a rush just watching the video. The only mild criticism is that a few stories were not covered in the depth that showed on later Braves videos. But this is where it all started and worth having whether or not you are a Braves fans.",1063843200,,661,4.171875
7836124,5,6303020151,"This video covers the magical 1991 Atlanta Braves' season and shows the good and bad times. From slumps to streaks, injuries to comebacks, it's all here. If you want to see the Braves' perhaps at their best, get this video today!",998784000,,229,4.609756097560975
