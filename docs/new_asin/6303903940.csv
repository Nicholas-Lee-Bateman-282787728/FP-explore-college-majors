7854441,5,6303903940,"bought this for my mother in law who's VHS finally stripped out.  She loves this little gem and plays it for background music (and scenery) when she has tea parties and Bible studies.  The only downfall she has noticed...is that she tears up each time she plays it!
It was the perfect Mother's Day gift!",1464134400,,303,4.490909090909091
