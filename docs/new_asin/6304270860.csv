 The history of Texas is a powerful story,though somewhat confusing when what you know about the Mexico-Texas history has been learned a bit at a time. However; James Michener does a teriffic job of tying this history and all the characters,dates,locations,cultures ,battles,etc,together into a story that is easy to follow as well as great entertainment.
 Texas is a state like no other,and the reason it is so individualistic and proud becomes very clear in this movie.
 Michener's novels are always epic and since they are long and in detail;I find I sometimes get a bit lost in them ;especially when I take a long time reading through one. However, watching this movie ,all at one sitting,greatly increases the the knowledge one gets about the history of Texas.
 I remember,from my school dasys that the general wisdom was that one got much more from ""reading the book rather than watching a movie"" about the same thing. I never really agreed with that thinking,and this movie convinced me once again.",1421193600,,1239,4.830188679245283
8561444,4,6304270860,"This was an interesting video of Big Bend as it focused on hiking  one of the less traveled trails. The video involves two hikers on a overnight trip into the Chisos Mountains to Blue Creek and down to the Ross Maxwell Drive. A good, short and entertaining video that explains how to enjoy and survive the Big Bend environment.",996883200,2,327,4.5423728813559325
