6808863,5,B00PIVKAZG,"Esther was a brave woman who believed in God. She was a Hebrew married to the King who was not Hebrew. She believed God would save her people but there came a time when she had to speak to her husband, the King, in order to intervene and save her people from further persecution.

It is a story worth watching. The movie shows the many challenges the people faced just in day to day life. It shows deception by those who were supposed to be closest to the King. It also illustrates the fact that God worked through Esther. He gave her the courage to do what she had to do even though she could have been executed.

The DVD makes the story of Esther come to life. The actors present the emotions of their characters well. You will see strength and perseverance in the people in their beliefs.

There are four Bible stories on this DVD: THE STORY OF MOSES, THE STORY OF ESTHER, JOSHUA AND JERICHO, ABRAHAM'S SACRIFICE
