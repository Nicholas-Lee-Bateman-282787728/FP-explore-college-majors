8665832,5,B00LH42J34,"Actually a pretty interesting 1972 TVseries based on TVmovie ""Sweet, Sweet Rachel""(1971) about a university psychic researcher who investigates psychic mysteries. Unfortunately the series was bought by the producer of NIGHT GALLERY who butchered the 50 minute episodes into short segments to add to NIGHT GALLERY in syndication. It was a lose-lose situation for the audience who wanted NIGHT GALLERY but randomly got incomprehensible psychic detective episodes. With streaming online video, AMAZON added NIGHT GALLERY to their inventory with several complete 50 minutes SIXTH SENSE episodes. Not sure why they didn't distinguish SIXTH as it's own series, or offer all 25 episodes.
Now the entire series is finally available. However, the dvds being from France means they are in PAL format, but at least seem to be region-free. Four episodes have French text for the opening series title card and episode name, so the video is slightly altered for that moment, but essentially are complete.",1512172800,,990,5.393548387096774
