4598556,5,B0058ILL2K,"The film left me absolutely speechless, I even let the credits run out before I could bring myself to turn it off. This is a story of friendship, love, courage, and life itself. It is both crushingly heart-breaking and infinitely hopeful.. The actors' performance is fantastic. All of them did quite an amazing job. Benedict Cumberbatch's work is especially stunning. It can easily be his best act so far. An actor with a bigger name at the time would have gotten an Oscar for the performance, no doubt.
The film is a real gem, give it the full attention it deserves. And please don't miss James Vincent McMorrow's song that plays during the end credits!",1349913600,,654,4.695652173913044

4598560,5,B0058ILL2K,"This is an absolutely fantastic film. It's beautiful and simple as it follows four friends as they say goodbye. It isn't very often I find a movie that is both heart-warming and heart-breaking simultaneously, but this one is. It's truely believable throughout both playfullness and tears. Highly recommended.",1336348800,25,308,5.4375

4598562,5,B0058ILL2K,"The affection afforded this British movie by other UK reviewers is absolutely on the money - ""Third Star"" is a superbly realised little film with a huge beating heart. I was very moved...

The story goes like this - James' lifelong but hapless pals decide that one last adventure will be a hoot and morale booster for their mate who is dying from an incurable disease. So they drag his three-wheeler chair loaded up with tents, drug suplies and a potted tree they will plant at journey's end - across fields, forest and coastal terrain. Their destination is Barafundle Bay - a stunning, secluded inlet in Wales that James adores. And you can see it in James' face too. He thinks that if he can just get there 'intact' - everything will be all right somehow. But of course nothing goes to plan and despite the odd belly-laugh along the way, the journey tests their friendship and loyalties to the absolute limit...

First up - praise has to go to HATTIE DALTON for her warmth and steady Direction in what could have been awfully cheesy material that's been done to bits too many times before. She's given this buddy-buddy story a lightness of touch that feels real and isn't forced. In fact, the constant wit and pranks reflect just how guys are when they're in real emotional turmoil - downright childish even. Kudos should also go to the four male leads who had to gel together convincingly, muck in on the arduous trek and physically brave the coastal weather - none of which can have been easy - or in the case of the freezing Irish sea - deeply unpleasant. And when the reality of their friend's terminal illness slowly begins to kick in and intrude on their 'fun' - they're skills as good actors make you 'feel' the heaviness of what their characters are all trying to block out.

Principal lead Benedict Cumberbatch has many fans - and on the strength of his acting chops both here and on ""Sherlock"" (the UK TV series) - it's easy to see why. His James is a demanding lead-role - a frustrated 29-year old who is being eaten-alive by cancer. His longing to live - to have more time - to realise at least some of his dreams - are always at the surface - and you ache for him as he slips in and out of a morphine-induced stupor that is numbing his escalating physical agony. As well as the pain - James has to also contend with his squabbling, tetchy pals - who are trying to be cool about it all but are freaked out inside and increasingly awkward with his now impending loss.

His fellow travellers consist of Adam Robertson as the witty and yet dependable Bill, Tom Burke as the needy but sincere Davy and JJ Feild as the handsome devil-may-care Miles (surely a new Jude Law in the making). They will even encounter Hugh Bonneville (of Downton Abbey fame) as a nutty Beachcomber looking for rare Star Wars toys. The dialogue is playful, smart and confrontational when it's needed. And then they're faced with the ultimate true-friendship decision - but can any or all of them - actually go through with it? Even with this much sadness at its core and end, ""Third Star"" remains hopeful - a sign of a great film rather than just a good one.

EXTRAS include a brief 'Making Of' and two shorts by Hattie Dalton called ""The Banker"" and ""One Of Those Days"". The only real let down for me is that it's on DVD only - and not BLU RAY - where all that great camera work would surely shine even more.

There are moments in ""Third Star"" when you genuinely ache for James' loss - when you hurt at the arbitrary cruelty of life - snubbing out one person, but letting another live.  This is a very good movie - one that celebrates life and makes you think about it too.

Put it high on your rental/to buy list...",1322092800,121,3703,4.435294117647059

While it's unassuming at first with a semi-slow pace, once you finally get into the meat of the characters and witness their friendship it draws you in (and inevitably sucker punches you in the face). Benedict Cumberbatch gives an incredibly performance, naturally, and the rest of the cast follows suit. I really can't express how much I love this movie. Worth a watch.

4598577,4,B0058ILL2K,"Sad but really not unexpected. Benedict Cumberbatch is amazing, as always, but it's his costars JJ Feild, Tom Burke and Adam Robertson who steal the show. Sickness doesn't just happen to you, it infects the people around you. This movie highlights that fact, not only showing the illness and tragedy of Benedict's character, but revealing the side effects it has on his loved ones as well. Camera work is a bit dodgy at times, I'm sure to make you feel as if you're there and ""in the moment"". All it did was give me a bit of a headache. Also, the story was a but more slow paced than I would have imagined. Honestly, it's just a sad movie. Still, worth watching for the SUPREME acting alone. Four main actors were brilliant. **Shout out to JJ Feild for that last scene. (When you watch the movie, you'll know the one I mean.)",1470614400,6,825,4.434210526315789
4598578,5,B0058ILL2K,"Personally, I thought this was brilliant. Those who could see it only it as a terrible, self-centered waste of a life...have you seen or know of anyone who died of a illness in terrible pain, because I have and it is heart-wrenching. I have held loved ones in my arms as they died. That James chose to take his life in this manner rather than have it end probably in a hospital setting, either wracked with pain or kept totally unconscious, was a brave decision. IMO. And of course, that's my opinion. Honestly,I could see myself doing the same....and I DO believe in God...in a God that isn't adamant that that I suffer it out to the end. Someone mentioned earlier how we put our suffering pets to rest when the situation is hopeless and we cannot bear to watch them in agony, yet it's okay for humans to suffer terribly? Great performances by all. And another reason Benedict Cumberbatch has worked his way to the top of my ""favorite actors"" list.",1470528000,4,949,4.523255813953488

4598638,5,B0058ILL2K,"Life's a bitch and then you die. That is the nucleus of this rich, moving, sincere and deeply heartfelt film. I bought this because, like our central character James (Benedict Cumberbatch) I love Barafundle Bay. How many other lovers of Pembrokeshire will have done 'Stackpole Quay to Barafundle Bay' - a classic Welsh coastal walk? And if you have done that, you will love and rcognise everything and everywhere in this sweet, moving film.
This is a mature, insightful film for mature insightful people, people who know that to laugh you have to cry and vice versa. And boy, does this film make you laugh and cry. This is not, as some reviewers have moaned, a film about character development  and story arc. It is simply a film that turns a documentary style eye on the last few days of one young man's lif and how it transforms him and his closest friends through the jokes the pain and the tears.
You will cry at this film, and if you don't then you need a new heart. Pain is part of life, says Third Star, and this is how you cope with it and get through it and come out the other side. Or not. It is a film of love and pain and effort and hope. Dare to watch it and be blessed. Not just because you may be a Cumberbatch fan, but because it is a rare little jewel of a film that shows life to be a precious and sharing experience, whatever that life may hold.
Great performances from all four leads, Tom Burke making the most of the quietly responsible Davy, JJ Feild acting with a depth rarely allowed such a handsome and stylish actor as Miles,and the heart and inspiration of the film the powerful, delicate and touching genius that is Benedict Cumberbatch. Dying prematurely from cancer, racked with pain, raging against the dying of his light, loving his friends and asking them for one final effort on his behalf,this acting powerhouse grabs you by the throat and does not let go. Even after the film is over and you have dried your tears, the beauty and the brilliance of this film will hold you to it's heart for a long, long time. Glory be to this delightful little film. Only UK independent film makers can produce joys like this!",1443398400,2,2145,4.430379746835443

To say I'm flat-out, wrapped in a comforter bawling my eyes out is not even close - I'm literally excreting alarming volumes of vital nutrients out of my tear ducts across a rather wide swath of my apartment. People could plant crops in my flood-planes. Snot. Poreth. Over. Salt water is RISING to the gunwales. And my body feels like a molted cicada remnant, a raisin, an absolute crust. Dude, I'm actually sitting here in my own pool of pathos wondering if someone could order me a saline IV drip stat.

Ahhh... jeesh, if I can ""cleave (through) the brine"" of my own bodily fluids for a sec, I'd like to say three things:

1. What freaking rock have I been under these past 4 years that I've missed this movie?!

2. Every single person who, in any nano-micro-infinitesimal way, contributed to the effort of making this film and getting it out into the world, deserves not just an Oscar, but all of them. All the Oscars, from all time. Actors, directors, writers, cinematographers, key grips, caterers, interns, assistants from around the world, from all actual past and all compossible futures, should just box up any and all of their awards, right now, and ship them off to wherever ""Third Star"" peoples are, everywhere.

3. I have a new mantra. LIFE is what ""is actually happening. And it Hurts. And it's aMaZiNg.""

Actually, one more thing...

4. Tom Burke, between Athos on Musketeers and Davy in Third Star, dude you are an acting Titan. Comedy? Check. Drama? Check. Swashbuckling? Check. Heart-wrenching? Check. Exceptionally good use of facial hair? Check. Lightning in a bottle; you're onto something. You keep doing you.

4598737,5,B0058ILL2K,"This film is exquisitely written, by Vaughan Sivell. I appreciate strong narrative, and ""Third Star"" delivers in spades.

I immensely relate to the film. During a tumultuous move to an arctic environment, a huge lump popped out of my neck. This, after a back injury from falling on ice (which still limits me). Weak, ill, and losing weight, I had no idea what was going on with my health. Even my insurance got lost in transition due to bureaucratic incompetence. Turns out I had a fast growing tumor, and by the time I could finally have surgery arranged, it was the size of a golf ball. I lived with months of struggle, not knowing if the thing was malignant or not. This time it was not, but can it can recur and then be cancerous.

Benedict Cumberbatch is simply superb as James, terminally ill, who knows he won't live past his 29th birthday. He sets off on a mystical visit to  Barafundle Bay, on the Pembrokeshire coast with his three best friends, Davy, Bill and Miles. Hugh Bonneville does an exquisite turn as a beach nutter, can't be missed! There are moments of poetry, as in the opening scene with the ocean flowing backwards, and in James' dream with the tunnel of light. There is a grim humor that I can relate to, having walked the shores of a wintery sea, on a lonely boardwalk along the ice. ""The Third Star"" shows the anger of living with death, the searing honesty when one feels that there is no time to lie about anything - the sharp edge of reality. Death can be a vivid, an immensely alive time as well, pathos, pain, forgiveness, and love all searingly brought to life in this film.",1406073600,2,1607,4.477815699658703

The fact it may be conventional and predictable only matters if it is so 'by the book' i.e. told the same way it has always been done with no sense that this story the way it is told could only be relevant in this way at this point in history.

#1 NO PLOT
#2 MAJOR CUSSING IN IT
#3 AND NOT A VERY GOOD ENDING

I watched this movie with my sister and we were both so pumped! Like, ""It has BENEDICT CUMBERPATCH IN IT! WHAT COULD BE WRONG WITH THIS MOVIE???"" We were both UTTERLY dissapointed.... I mean, the acting was GREAT! The cast was incredibly well thought out, but like i said before, the movie had NO plot and well, just too much cussing for my comfort. I thought Benedict was AMAZING in this movie, being I could never possibly NOT love him, but COME ON, BENEDICT! Your way better than this!

Also, I don't want to spoil the movie if you want to watch it, but ill just say the ending will NOT be practical as he has cancer(That is not a spoiler cause they point that out in the opening of the movie)
I think that the movie would be GREAT if they removed the swear words and added some more depth and meaning to the story.... But let me tell you, I DELETED it afterwards.....

All in all, This was totally not a movie to watch as a family. Also, as there is no rating, i think this would probably be rated PG-13.. But Benedict was good in this movie<3",1404259200,,1156,4.079295154185022

4598766,2,B0058ILL2K,"So I bought this movie because I recently discovered JJ Feild and was curious about his work. I found this movie, saw the great reviews, and thought this movie had so much potential based on its description, but it reminded once again why some movies are independents (they are not very good). Benedict Cumberbatch's character was the only one I felt that had real resolution when the movie was over and most people are going to know what that resolution is before the movie even starts. Yes, it's possible that could be the point (life is messy after all), but it made me mad that I just sat through all the crap the guys talked about because who knows if their lives were ever going to change or if they were going to be the same sad, pathetic people they were to begin with. And to me that should be the point. It was a pretty significant trip the men took with the potential to have profound long-term impacts, but the movie ends before we ever know if that happens. And because we never get that vision, I found myself not really caring about the characters at the end. We certainly understand that they are friends and there are some good scenes showing that, but there definitely was some lacking in the character development department. I really wanted to like this because you rarely get a buddy movie with men that doesn't involve crude humor, sex, violence, or some stupid gimmick, and I was interested to see how this group of men would talk or not talk to each other about serious life events, but I just felt so cheated at the end of this one that I felt like I wasted my time because the characters on there own were not developed enough to make them individually likeable. So in the end, I found myself liking a few specific scenes (including the one with Hugh Bonneville, and a highly charged thought-provoking one near the end) and the scenery more than anything else. The movie has a good concept, but unfortunately the execution is lacking.

This is the real tragedy: that his life was not considered worth continuing. Consider all he could have done, even with mere months of life. What beautiful things could he have accomplished...what unfinished purpose did he possess?

The fact that our society is moving towards the de-valuation of life and its purpose is deeply concerning. I value movies like this in the emotions and considerations they invoke. And I value the fact that the audience is allowed to think for themselves about the choices taken.

The ensemble is very strong and I find it difficult to admit that Cumberbatch's performance is my favorite. Every choice he made in playing this character was a smart one and ultimately led to my sobbing at the end of the movie. Honestly, there needs to be more films like this one where the story and emotions are held at a higher state of importance than special effects, sex, or violence.

4598786,5,B0058ILL2K,"There's nothing like a cancer film to bring down your mood. Thankfully Third Star isn't all overwhelming gloom and sadness. There is a joyous atmosphere sprinkled throughout that leaves you lighthearted and smiling, before the depressing bits come along and ensnare you. This is a simple tale of four good longtime friends, taking one final journey together.

James, played by a superb Benedict Cumberbatch is suffering from terminal cancer, but wishes for one last visit to his favorite seaside spot. His friends accompany him, helping him, aiding him and supporting him in any way they can. He is only 29 and there's a bitterness about him that can't be helped, given his situation. But he clearly loves his friends, no matter how many ups and downs they've been through. They are all pranksters at heart and the film really does a fine job balancing their raucous nature with the precarious situation they've found themselves in.

The film is shot beautifully and the scenery is lovely to look at, the musical score subtle and fitting. The rest of the small cast does a wonderful job as well and that's really what keeps this film afloat. Their friendship is enduring, no matter what's happened or what will inevitably happen.

James' fragility is heartbreaking to witness, his resolve is strong though and when they finally reach their destination, it seems all worth it. The final fifteen minutes of the film is achingly painful, like a fist clenching onto your heart. It left me a weepy mess.

This is actually a hard film to review. Does anyone actually LIKE watching someone suffer through an incurable illness for an hour and a half? You can't help but think of everyone you've ever known with a similar situation. It's not fair. It's just like one character says in the film: ""It's just really, really, really, really unlucky.""

I'm glad I watched Third Star, but I can't picture a repeat viewing. I don't think my heart can take it again...",1399593600,,1951,4.846846846846847

It made me both laugh and cry, and it was possibly one of Benedict Cumberbatch's most outstanding performances. Props to the director, Hattie Dalton, who did such an excellent job with such a challenging and done-a lot-before type of storyline.
I Honestly thought it was one of the best films I've ever seen, no, not just because of Benedict Cumberbatch's (Who I adore) phenomenal portrayal of James, a 29 year-old with cancer who knows he won't make it to see thirty and is longing to live, but because of the strong themes of loyalty, friendship, courage, and love. The story of the film was absolutely brilliant, though at times compromising, but it was extremely well done, thoughtful, and beautiful. The entire film has brilliant dialogue - it's spirited, bold, and even antagonistic at times. Even with the grief throughout and at the ending, Third Star is a film that needs to be watched.
I highly suggest that anybody watch this, it'll make you laugh, and it'll make you cry, but most of all, it'll make you recognise one of the true beauties of the human life -- the power of friendship.",1399248000,2,1171,4.773399014778325

It's quite awesome that someone so young can portray the spectrum of feelings and emotions that his character displays, but Benedict has a rare gift - an enormous talent.  His eyes twinkle and his smile makes your heart melt. He can be sinister, mean, angry, harsh, gentle, sweet, and most of all, humble and charming.

I absolutely enjoy Benedict Cumberbatch, but this movie made me so sad.  There were some light and comical spots, but for the most part, I cried...especially the ending.  Maybe it is because I am a cancer survivor and had such severe pain my leg, that I could more than relate to the character and the pain he was dealing with. I am blessed because I have been able to beat it and kick cancer's butt, but I cannot give this movie a high rating for story because it was simply too painfully emotional for me, however, I do think the acting was really good.

It was the personalities of the characters dealing with the situation that keep me intrigued. It's kind of a tear jerker, I mean how does one enjoy a movie about friends dealing with death.

4598825,2,B0058ILL2K,"This is almost a good movie, but there are several elements that I think prevented it from actually being one (and I'll try to leave out spoilers):

* Pacing that doesn't let you get immersed in the story. They could have cut out the first twenty minutes and several scenes and shots throughout.

* Conflict that rings false. There are several instances throughout the film where we're set up for a tense situation that's not timed right or that just isn't believable. If you've ever said to yourself while watching a movie, ""Oh, they can't kill him off yet!"" you'll know what I mean here.

* Metaphors that sledgehammer you instead of subtly contributing to the story. In one instance, a mischievous boy wearing angel wings makes off with a timepiece and throws it in the sea. There's at least a couple references to 'the boy who never grew up' as well.

* Characters that aren't sympathetic. It's not just they say or do unlikeable things, but their motivation isn't always clear or even subtly implied. It's sometimes even hard to feel a connection to the main character, James.

This movie wants you to care about it because James has terminal cancer. But it hasn't provided enough enough context about James' primary relationships, both friends and family, to carry a two hour film about what his loss will mean. There's a joking reference in this film to ""Brokeback Mountain,"" but I would actually recommend that movie over this one if you're looking for a film featuring a male relationship that reveals the deep, complex layers of humanity and emotion. And if you're looking for a Benedict Cumberbatch movie that's a strong character study but that leaves you thinking rather than bludgeoned, try ""Wrecked.""",1395187200,3,1715,4.839590443686006

Normally, I like my entertainment on the fluffy side, but the reviews of this movie and being a fan of Benedict Cumberbatch, I was encouraged to move out of my comfort zone. Though I genuinely enjoyed it, I am not going to say it was an easy movie to finish. In fact, I had to watch it in three segments. There were scenes that left me so emotionally spent, and I had to stop and start later. The story was very well-written. I really felt I was looking through a window of this secret society of men dealing with big issues about life, death, love, friendship, failure and unfulfilled promise. I was both surprised by the depth of love that these four men have for each other (accompanying a dying friend on a quixotic adventure) and amused by their often childish behavior (looking for short cuts, losing everything in sight). The moments of lightness and humor in the movie balanced the achingly sad central story. The acting was tremendous. I felt the weight of the characters' endeavor on my shoulders as I watched. I cried along with them as the enormity of the inevitable settles on each of them. I don't think I can bear to see it again, but I am glad I made it through to the end.

NO spoilers here....you know within the first couple of minutes of this film that he is terminally ill.  Please don't think this is a downer movie.  It has some hilarious moments.  I would rather say it is a love story among friends, and what is important in the end.  Have a big box of tissues and enjoy a movie that may very well stay in your mind for awhile.

You really have to be in a ""good place"" mentally before you embark on this journey with this wonderful ensemble cast.  Benedict Cumberbatch was absolutely superb in this movie and I'm glad that I stumbled across it on Amazon Instant Video.  I wish that this movie had been advertised in the states.  There is so much more versatility to this actor than the BBC production of Sherlock.  (Sherlock is great...not knocking it, but you totally forget about Sherlock when you watch this movie.)

It is far better than 95% of movies out there and the Wales Council should be applauded for funding this and the cast and crew for taking it on.

Reminded me of American film Dying Young--better quality than Dying Young but with a similarly melodramatic and one-dimensional story. I think most people have been touched by cancer and will not find that the mere subject of terminal illness is sufficient to carry a film. There wasn't much substance. Perhaps if I were male I would have found the friendship aspect compelling, but it, too, seemed fairly flat. Also all the main characters' lives and their relationships are pretty depressing. I would have stopped watching early on except that I love Hugh Bonneville and from the way he's credited in the description I thought he'd have a significant role and I was hoping for more of him. Alas, he has only a cameo, and although it was a great role and his scene was the highlight of the film IMHO, I wish I had spent my time on something else.",1388880000,,1009,4.804597701149425

I either got used to it or they started speaking more clearly after a short while, but it was hard to decipher what was being said for the first little while.

I absolutely loved this movie, and I can honestly say that it was the best movie I have seen in a long time.

So James sets out for a journey to Barafundle Bay in Pembrokeshire, Wales, together with three of his best friends Davy (Tom Burke), Miles (J. J. Field) and Bill (Adam Robertson). And there is one thing that James has to do at this beautiful place.

Directed by Hattie Dalton (her debut) and written by Vaughan Sivell (his first work as a screenwriter), ""Third Star"" - reference to ""Peter Pan"" - benefits from the beautiful locations and the strong performances from the cast, especially Benedict Cumberbatch, (better known as ""Sherlock"") who here literally becomes the ailing character.

The story itself is rather predictable. The main four characters are all credible, but some episodes involving eccentric characters the travelers encounter on the road seem prolonged. Still, the film successfully builds up the emotion towards the end that is full of impact.",1384214400,2,975,5.243589743589744

Hence my rating.  The zeitgeist seems to be moving towards assisted suicide, but current medicine can control pain especially for the dying. If the movie were based on a true story, I wonder what impact James' death would have on his companions or his family, especially when they are faced with their own deaths.

The movie seemed slow moving and I found myself checking how much longer.  The anger expressed by the main character was welcome relief. However his only resolution for his anger was to control the great inevitable.",1382572800,,696,4.823529411764706

Out of all of them, I was most impressed with Third Star. I was brought to tears several times through the course of the movie, and there is something very real and poignant about this picture, most especially the ending, which I won't spoil. This movie operates on several levels, both stimulating our emotions and delving into the deeper questions of love, friendship, life and death.

Beautiful. I think out of everything I've seen, I'd consider this one of Benedict's masterpeices. Definitely worth watching, and owning.",1382486400,,735,4.919354838709677
4598898,5,B0058ILL2K,"Watched Third Star a couple weeks ago, but it took me that long to actually sit down and write a review. I had to let some time pass and wait until the raw emotions this film provokes settle down a bit. I can say this  its one of the best movies I have seen this year, but I will admit that not everyone will like it.

Basically, if you are looking for a an easy, switch your brain off and laugh out loud movie , walk away. Third Star is anything but easy, though it has some funny moments. If you are looking for two hours of eye popping non-stop action, chose something else to watch. But if you want a movie that grabs you and takes you on an emotional roller coaster, a movie that makes you laugh and cry and hurt with its characters, a movie that leaves you with many things to think about once its over  by all means, buy Third Star.

The main premise is common enough: four childhood friends  James (Benedict Cumberbatch), Davy (Tom Burke), Bill (Adam Robertson) and Miles (JJ Feild) embark on a road trip to Jamess favorite place on Earth  Barafundle Bay in Pembrokeshire, Wales. But this is where this trip differs from countless other road trip movies. James is terminally ill with cancer and his friends decided to organize this trip as their last adventure together. This is not a spoiler. In fact the movie starts with James saying I am 29 today. I won't be 30.

So this movie is a road trip, yes, but one that is also a goodbye   goodbye to a friend, to childhood memories, to dreams not fulfilled and paths not taken. And while all four of the protagonists do their best to ignore the elephant in the room (James sickness), they will have to face it eventually, as they will have to face their own shortcomings and lost dreams.

It is hard to describe this movie. Yes it is sad and the ending is hearth-wrenching and had me really crying, which not a lot of movies do. But you know what? Its also filled with beauty and subtle humor and you can really see how much those four care about each other.

To me, this is what this movie is about  love. Those four friends really love each other and they genuinely care about James or they would never be able to make the decision they made at the end of the movie. And they all love life and see the beauty in the little things around them.

All four actors gave exceptional performances for Third Star. Nothing is overplayed or heavy-handed. I believe them when I watch them interact on screen. I forget that its Benedict Cumberbatch and JJ Feild, instead I only see James and Miles. That is the highest praise you can give an actor.

But most importantly for me at least, this movie made me think. We all have dreams and things we want to do eventually, one day, when we have time. And after a while, like James says, all those daydreams become fantasies rather than possibilities. Well what if there is no more time? What if the next day is your last one? What would you see when you look back at your life? What happened to all those possibilities and dreams?

This movie made me think about what I really want to do with my life. And you know what? I don't want my dreams to become mere fantasies. I want to fulfill them, even if it will be hard work. So for this realization I must thank director Hattie Dalton and Western Edge Pictures and the main actors.

And for those who want to spend two hours with a good movie that makes you sympathize with its characters and think about life and death, watch Third Star. Its available for download from Amazon or on ITunes.",1382486400,25,3532,4.328787878787879

I have seen some people complain that it is slow and boring because the friends talk a lot, but that is the point of the movie. Their relationships to one another, how one of them hadn't been around for years, and the ways their lives differ is kind of the point. Life is obviously a big theme in this movie, but it approaches it differently than in most terminally ill movies, in a way that is offensive but at the same time true for the average person.

This is the kind of movie that really moves you, but I doubt it is one you watch over and over again.

I had no idea before watching this movie, other than Benedict Cumberland was in it, whom I have seen in many other British films and he is excellent, whether using humor, or in this case suffering.

The movie starts on his birthday, and he knows he won't live to see 30. Right off the bat you know it's going to be sad. He and his three closest friends decide they will take him to this beach he loves, and try to make it into a fun trip. There is a lot of male bonding, some conflict, and some terrible scenes of Jim (the character) dealing with his pain (he takes morphine and other meds to control his pain).

I was worried of seeing yet-another-tragic-cancer movie, but this one is neither boring nor repeating old cliches. This movie deserves it's five stars!

And yes, Cumberbatch in the lead is doing a fantastic job, of course. If you like him in BBC's Sherlock and are considering watching this just for the actor and can stomach watching a movie like this, this is a must-see for sure.",1377648000,,663,4.765217391304348

The story is bittersweet, building slowly in the tension of reality finally truly setting in, both in one friend's predicament and finally in their own lives.  As one character says, the men have finally reached the day when the dreams one had of one's life become more like fantasies than possibilities.  And also in the things unsaid for years that finally come out.  There can be no real happy ending, and you can feel their fear at a friendship lost and the heavy burden and gladness it will mark on them.",1377043200,,618,4.63302752293578

In order to help him he takes his three longest and dearest friends to help him. They are Davey, Miles and Bill and they have made a special wheel chair to get him to the stunning Welsh coast line of Barafundle Bay.

He needs his medication which he taking in higher dosage to deal with the pain, but on the way he is determined to make the most of his trip. They have a long trip ahead of them and he wants it to be just them, no mobile phones etc. As there progress continues events conspire to throw up all manner of issues from the past and even some from the future and cracks in the friendships soon appear which they are forced to deal with.

Life is a journey and the metaphor here is obvious. For the viewer to care the characters have to be both believable and likeable, and to a great extent they manage to achieve this; despite some very juvenile pranks along the way. The cast put in some commendable performances and the scenery and framing of the shots is all excellent. It deals with the issues around death but also that of a life lived well and how one judges it. I found it to be compelling, moving and a rewarding watch. Made by the BBC in association with the Welsh Film Board this is what the BBC do best, a great drama. Well made, acted and makes you think - recommended",1376265600,,1463,4.258992805755396

Although the underlying circumstances that brought the characters together is a somber one, there was a happy overlay of great friendship, close ties and unbreakable bonds.

I imagine that it is always hard to keep a story about such a tough subject (cancer) from becoming maudlin and drowning the audience in sorrow, but this had, along with its solid core of real, down-to-earth bonds of friendship between the four men, some genuinely funny moments.

I was left marveling at the beauty that love and friendship bring to even the ugliest, most devastating experiences in life. In fact I found myself laughing out loud far more often than crying. Through this final sojourn these friends gave James joy and laughter to the end and as he himself says, ""there is no tragedy in that"".

I will say that Benedict is *gorgeous* in this movie-- he plays a young man tragically dying of cancer, and he's convincing in his portrayal of the physical problems his character deals with-- fatigue, debility, severe pain, dependence on pain meds, as well as the expected emotional problems of fear, despair and ruthlessly facing his own demise.",1354147200,3,751,5.016
