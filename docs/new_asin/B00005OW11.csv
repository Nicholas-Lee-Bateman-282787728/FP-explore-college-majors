7949259,4,B00005OW11,"This DVD should, in fact, be called KOTC Greatest Fights.  It is not, as the title would imply, a collection of great knockouts.  Rather, it is a set of 11 fights from King of the Cage events that they considered to be their ""greatest hits"".  Some of the fights are good, but there are actually only a couple of knockouts on the DVD, just so that no one is thrown off by the title.

KOTC was a fairly big deal in the world of MMA and many now household names got their start in the yellow-matted octagon.  On this DVD, mother-flippin' Don ""The Dragon"" Wilson does pre-fight interviews and fight commentary. There is also commentary from Eddie Bravo (who now lends his commentary to the UFC), Ricco Rodriguez and Ken Shamrock.

The fights are pretty entertaining.  Ricco Rodriguez dominates MMA veteran Travis Fulton and Vernon ""Tiger"" White demolishes Todd Medina very quickly. Marvin Eastman takes on Quinton Jackson in his KOTC debut. Jackson would go on to ""fame"" in Pride Fighting, while Easatman, who won this fight, went on to get his forehead split open by Vitor Belfort. Duane Ludwig gives perhaps the best fighting performance on this DVD.  Ludwig totally picks his opponent apart. Strikes to all areas of the body - it is truly a devastating beating. Fabiano Iha quickly submits his opponent and Jerry Bohlander makes his MMA comeback. He had taken a 2-year break from the UFC and he comes out and immediately gets rocked. He composes himself and eventually submits his opponent.  Pete Williams has the quickest KO of the DVD. His fight literally lasts 3 seconds.

There is some good action and this DVD gives you a chance to see some current MMA stars and standouts in their earlier fighting days.  It's a good DVD to add to your MMA collection.",1147132800,2,1756,4.687296416938111
7949260,5,B00005OW11,"Great dvd, it shows some new talent coming up in the ranks of MMA, before they went to the ufc, and pride. They put together great matches, and put a great show. A must have dvd for any collection.",1042416000,,197,4.076923076923077
7949261,2,B00005OW11,"i bought this tape because i thought it was going to be a ""best of"" king of the cage but instead it seems to be a ""fastest knockout"" tape.  this was my first kotc tape but i have seen many pride and ufcs and compared to those, this was not very entertaining.
my biggest issue with this tape is the short length of the fights.  there are prefight interviews of both parties (""i'm gonna win because i train really hard""), intros, post fight interviews, replays (tip: kotc guys, i can rewind!).  this makes the bulk of the tape.  i think there were at least three fights that ended before the 10 sec mark.  there are 11 fights total, none i would want to watch a 2nd time.  i think 2 go to decision, many quick KOs after long buildups.
another thing i disliked was the transitions between each fight.  they show this juiced up looking body builder flexing his arms.  why?  i don't know one mma fighter that looks like that.  it gave the tape a wwf feel.
announcing was good, don the dragon and various other people.  best fight goes to ricco rodriguez vs travis fulton, but that was still too short for my liking.
this is not the tape i would give to a friend to introduce them to mma.",1009843200,,1182,4.2792792792792795
