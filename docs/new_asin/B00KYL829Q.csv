8662675,5,B00KYL829Q,"I found this documentary to be a very beautiful, thought provoking and moving film. It really stirred my intellectual and emotional abilities... and not to say the least my motivation in life.... The film starts off with a quest for a lost civilization back in the the country of Romania, in the Carpathian Mountains where there is on top of a mountain a rock formation that somehow resembles the Egyptian Sphinx. Filmmaker Oana Ghiocel (she was born in Romania) goes back to investigate, and calls upon in her search Boston University Professor and renowned geologist Dr. Robert Schoch - he joins the quest. The film becomes truly an exploration of beautiful on sites flowered with intellectual meditation and a lot of philosophical inquiry (about our deep past, our human origins, societies, etc.)
I find this film to be very important especially in the times we live today - a real breakthrough of knowledge and ideas... It will certainly make you think and make you wonder on a much different and deeper level that most documentaries. In a sense it is a film that criticizes very much this day and age, war on terror, conflicts, materialistic society, etc. But it does it in such a wonderful way...
The bonus features are truly marvelous as well and I found myself watching them more than once. They really add to this puzzle.
In the end this film is a very deeply moving an deeply affecting film. One unlikely to be forgotten too soon......",1448064000,,1445,4.784

Unfortunately, as with most of this type of presentation, the narrators are sometimes very dramatic and present some unproven data as a fact. Generally well presented but accept the info with some reservation.",1431388800,2,256,5.2682926829268295
