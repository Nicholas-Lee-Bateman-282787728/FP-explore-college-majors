4428703,5,B004M7FBQ0,"What Blue Velvet is to the detective genre, Amer is to the giallo.  Amer takes all of the tropes, both visual and aural, of the giallo and condenses them down into pure abstraction.  It is probably best enjoyed as three separate short films, each about a distinct time in the protagonist's (Ana) life:

The first (and in my opinon, best) segment is seen through the eyes of the child (maybe six years old?) Ana observing the adults of her world dealing with the death of their elderly patriarch.  The mood is gothic and fairy-tale like, with unnaturally saturated colors and dream-like juxtapositions.

The second segment follows the now teenage protagonist on a trip into town with her mother to perform errands.  The style of shooting (and sound design) turn this mundane task into a sensual awakening, and a growing awareness of the power of  Ana's sexual allure.  The atmosphere is distinctly different from the first segment, set in summer at a sea-side town in France (I'm assuming).  A lot of reviewers found this transition too jarring to recover from, but again, look at this as three movies and it won't bother you.

The third segment is a return to the gothic house of the first segment, now run down and abandoned.  The protagonist is now mature, in her 30's, and appears to be trying to reconcile her feelings about the place.  This is the most classically ""giallo"" of all the sections, as she is apparently stalked by a black-gloved killer with a straight razor.

There is little dialog in the first segment, and virutally none of any significance in the second and third.  A narrative is present, is not all that cryptic if you pay attention, but really is a background element to the atmosphere.  And what an atmosphere Amer creates!  Tight close-ups predominate, coupled with sonic ""close-ups"" creating an immersive microcosm of Ana's perceptions.  The style is consistent throughout, but subtly shifts in its focus with the protagonist's age.  The directors demonstrate an absolute mastery of image and sound design, shooting on anamorphic 16mm film with a high quality transfer (just the right amount of grain).  The sound mix is incredible, best listened to on headphones (it'll make the hairs stand up on your neck!).  The music is all lifted from obscure giallo of the 70's, including a piece by Ennio Morricone.

The disc includes the entire oeuvre of short films by these directors, charting a straight line to this stunning first feature.  My favorite was a lazy day at a cafe shot with the intensity of a Spaghetti Western.

Highly recommended for lovers of both Arthouse and Grindhouse cinema.",1350777600,9,2620,4.891156462585034
4428704,2,B004M7FBQ0,"I'm an avid collector of giallos and was looking forward to this movie with great anticipation. It seemed like those who reviewed it from film festival screenings were hailing it as an 'authentic' giallo that was a flawless return to that particular style of movie making.
Well, AMER is a very difficult movie to critique properly because it is actually a unique 'movie' which doesn't adhere to a coherent narrative. While it is beautiful to look at there is no way to know exactly what is going on. It's much more 'David Lynch' than 'Dario Argento'. While it's certainly steeped in the stylistic flourishes of 70s giallos it's more like 'giallo fantasia' than a giallo proper; a flashy cinematic love letter to the stylistic staples of the genre, without the engaging mystery. There is very little dialog whatsoever. There is also only one really violent murder in the movie and it happens to a man (were the filmmakers afraid to glamorously depict the giallo's trademark misogyny?)
While the opening scenes are compelling (heavily emphasized in the trailers), the rest of the movie unfortunately is not as consistent or engaging and the finale is sorely lacking. Another crucial element of giallos is the music. With the exception of the main theme song most of AMER's soundtrack is comprised of tracks directly lifted from the soundtracks several 70s giallos! Some giallo purists will no doubt find this unforgivable.
Overall AMER is a beautiful collection of images which is unfortunately hampered by a constantly profound approach to ANYTHING & EVERYTHING! Even the most mundane things are emphasized with menacing close-ups (forearm hairs, ears, etc). I'm even a fan of David Lynch's films but AMER seems to have been directed by someone only obsessed with Lynch's uncanny eye for the bizarre, while overlooking his brilliant inclusion of profound meanings. AMER is much too obsessed with nonsensical whims to allow a compelling story to develop. It's more of a flashy experimental indie film than an authentic portrayal of the sublime sophistication in a great giallo. As long as you know what you're getting into you might really enjoy this gorgeous, initially compelling, ultimately senseless oddity. Unfortunately I was expecting to see a great giallo.",1350432000,5,2262,5.132791327913279
4428705,2,B004M7FBQ0,"The last 20 minutes of this film were outstanding! The sequence of colorful events that play out in the last portion of this film were captivating, and will forever stay with me as I continue through my film watching and film making career. Now, I have to ask myself, do 20 minutes of spectacular screen time pay penance for 70 minutes of my life that I will never be given back?  Since life is short, no.
This film is visually arresting and strikes elements of originality with its color play, but as a whole the movie is completely devoid of any redeeming or entertaining factors.  There are several impressive shots, and from a technical standpoint it is an achievement, in fact it is a marvel.  The color saturation and the fevered dream quality remind me of the best ""giallo"" has to offer, but it is missing some semblance of a story.  Now, before I hear from the peanut gallery, yes, I am aware that ""giallo"" story lines were thin at best, but they still provided a structure, a narrative, and even an anchor point for the audience.  Without the story (as proven here) the random camera flashes do nothing but tease at what could have been.
Overall, I chalk this up to an attempt to create art-house fare from the ""giallo"" sub-genre of horror. It can be done, such as ""The Skin I Live In"", but these filmmakers did nothing but make an incoherent mess.  Do yourself a favor, watch the last 20 minutes, as a short film, it would have been rather impressive.",1333584000,4,1461,4.515151515151516
4428706,3,B004M7FBQ0,"[AMER - 2008 - Directed by Helene Cattet and Bruno Forzani - Widescreen] Visually arresting, well-realized and executed, hypnotic, haunting and delirious, this film is one that deserves to be loved, hated or a little of both. And deservedly so, and here's why.

European cinema basically broke tradition and thumbed its nose at narrative style so essential to American film by the late 60's (and, truth be told, we weren't doing it well any longer either, so the calibrating tools utilized to judge these films needed adjustment), creating something that made you feel rather than think when it came to absorbing and digesting your cinematic Wheaties, and we are eternally indebted to them for this breakthrough, like it or not. It opened far more many doors than it closed, that's for certain. And the Giallo genre benefitted greatly from this invention, and this film is indeed a wonderful, dizzying homage to the heyday of the enigmatic, hyper-erotic, slightly schizophrenic if not sometimes incoherent styling associated with the giallo film. The first and second 'movements' of the film are absolutely captivating to succumb to. Like a collision of Bava, Argento and Martino, it revels in the artistry of these masters yet manages to add something as well. The second act wasn't nearly as absorbing, and didn't necessarily 'fit' with the others, at least thematically, having little to do with the giallo or rest of the film except to show the viewer a midpoint in the development of the main character, and blew the continuity of the entire film. Once interest is lost, it's rarely regained. But it does finally restore its focus to conclude on a positive note (unless you're the protagonist), leaving one with mixed feelings about the entire affair. At least it did for me.

It's one thing to do away with narrative and still have a cohesive whole, but when you also delete almost all dialogue and plot at the same time, you're left with a giallo-based video-coma for the MTV generation - a series of hyper-edits and allusions to a story that's never satisfactorily explained or developed past a first or second draft. I was interested enough to watch it a second time, but the gaps present were still there. The directors are certainly skilled and talented in the craft of cinema-making; now if they could only find a screenwriter they'd be a triple-threat to transgressive cinema. It's one of those flicks that makes as much sense with the sound off as it does on, though the audio is exciting and engaging as sounds are heightened, exaggerated and stretched for maximum impact. You'll never look at a comb without hearing the sound employed here for the rest of your life. But there's much here to be praised as well as chastised, so don't get me wrong. After two screenings, I'm still somewhat ambivalent about this one, and that's not all bad now, is it?

In my opinion, four of the five shorts included on this disc are at least as good as the feature itself, so it's understandable that the filmmakers are to be reckoned with somewhere down the pike - if this is their first full-length hatchling, I can't wait for their maturation. Ardent fans of the giallo will want to check into this madness, but others will claw at their skin like meth addicts while watching, so govern yourself accordingly.

If you want something darkly experimental and abnormal, grab it tightly and hold on. If you want traditional, don't trespass this road - it'll kill ya for sure. 3 1/2 stars.",1326412800,2,3486,4.843959731543624

4428708,5,B004M7FBQ0,"AMER [2009]

Film: This piece of art is worth to be watched more than once. Its style is a unique homage to the giallo cinema and it creates the perfect synthesis of picture, sound and (the typical minimalized) plot. The first part appears to be quite disturbing and extraordinarily intense, ending in a hypnotic and confusing climax. After this glimpse at the seemingly traumatizing events in the life of a young girl part two is slowly paced but cleverly focusing on the erupting sexuality of the teenage girl. Part tree is uniting these topics letting the audience witness the return of the now adult character to her former home. The confrontation of childhood trauma which obviously resulted in disturbed sexuality and oppressed psychosis is inevitable when she spends the night at her families' estate. One comb, a chain, tight leather gloves and a razor knife in deep red create a circle of symbols around the escape from a mysterious killer, the ramifications of manifested childhood trauma, shifting perception, sexual perversion and not at least the voyeurism of the audience.

Blu-ray: AMER is presented on a single-layered disc and comes with a poster and two possible covers for the blu-ray case. Instead of a booklet we get much information about the film printed on the back of the poster. The disc includes four short films as bonus content. The picture is framed in 2,35:1 and provides a very good presentation of a visually impressive movie. Now and then there is some minor noise but all in all the intention of the filmmakers seems to be reflected perfectly well. It is sharp, colorful and offers deep blacks. The original French track is presented in DTS-Master-5.1 and is very much satisfying. The creepy atmosphere and the songs sound crystal clear. The English subtitles are optional and placed within the picture and not in the black bars (but there are only about ten sentences of dialog anyway). Be aware that the disc is locked to Region B.

For fans of the giallo classics or modern, creative filmmaking this comes highly recommended.",1300060800,3,2063,4.939481268011527

8435595,3,B004M7FBQ0,"Bruno Forzani admits Tenebrae as the main inspiration for this movie having seen it 17 times and as a self confessed Giallo  fan. There is a lot in the film that owes a great deal to Dario Argento and the infamous Italian exploitation style of 1970s and 1980s cinema, but Amer unfortunately fails to tick all of the boxes even for Giallo fanatics.
For the uninitiated, Argento films have certain trademarks: murder, pedestrian police work, clunky dialogue, all wrapped up in a delightful mix of High Art and Ham. The sets are sophisticated and stylish, the women gorgeous, in peril and as mad as march hares. The men just as barking, but the experience of Argento features is quite different to that Amer evokes.
With a definitive three act structure following the sensual life of a girl, adolescent, and then woman, Amer has little or no dialogue, which makes this film hard work, albeit fascinating. What the directors have done here is take all of the stylings of Argento  but missed the elements that give Darios work heart and charm  the sense of unapologetic amateurism in delivery  especially of the acting and plot, if not in the camerawork. Amer by contrast is far too self-conscious to evoke the same kin d of response in an audience. The first act of the film is by far the best and most effecting with the child Ana interacting with the corpse of a dead father whose spirit is trapped in a silver locket, whilst escaping the menace of a black lace veiled woman. The sound effects are brilliant as is the performance of the young Ana, played by Charlotte Eugene Guibeaud, and this delivers  a fairy tale quality that makes it stand out from the following two acts that re although visually stunning  induce impatience and bewilderment.
The adolescent and adult Ana seem to spend most of their time pouting in red lipstick, gazing into space enigmatically both fearing and feeling sensual experience. Both females look as though they are bordering hysteria and/or orgasm with no given backstory or reasoning and there appears to be no plot whatsoever with sequential dream sequencing mapping the development as substitute. In one sequence, the grown Ana gets into a cab and states the address in one of the few lines of dialogue only then to be seduced by the breeze to the effect of it tearing the seams of her dress apart. This is reminiscent of some of Brian De Palmas work  especially Dressed to Kill with Angie Dickenson consistently in the same mental state as the adult Ana especially. There are endless shots of erect nipples under cloth, purposely making the film a celluloid version of a 1970s Penthouse. This is fair, but gets a shade tiresome.
The use of insects against skin is interesting and very Daliesque and the close ups are impressive that owe as much to Un Chien Andolou and Brunel as they do to Argento.  The film was shot in Menton  the last stop of the French Riviera before the Italian Riviera, a lovely and scenic part of the world: the house that features in the last act was purposely chosen by Bruno as it was here the young man grew up and the mansion in question held nostalgic importance for the director. This comes across in the entire film: it is an act of love on the part of the film makers and should be seen as such without looking at it as a pure homage film. Giallo  the Argento movie in a modern context is far better as a gauging point for the genre than Amer  but it is deeply satisfying that the Giallo genre has been taken on board and is being served to us by young film makers of the next generation. For this reason, no doubt, Tarantino thought Amer one of the top twenty films of 2010. The DVD is out on 31st Jan.",1434499200,4,3673,4.566869300911854
8435596,5,B004M7FBQ0,"Wrapping alienation, repression, and rebellion in a maelstrom of gorgeous photography that would garner praise from Mario Bava and a soundtrack culled from the finest composers of giallo all'Italiana, Cattet and Forzani have presented us with a praiseworthy package of eye and ear candy.  Employing the familiar tropes of giallo cinema and adding their own twenty-first century flourishes, the film makers pay homage to the genre and respect the fact a large portion of the film's audience was born well after the demise of this specialized segment of Italian cinema. To express it more succinctly, this is a re-interpretation of giallo, not a carbon copy.  The video/audio transfers for both the dvd and blu-ray disc (I have both) are, in my opinion,excellent.  I am equally impressed with the inclusion of the film makers' short films, which exhibit their emerging cinematic skills.  I wore old school headphones while viewing Amer and found it to be ninety minutes of pure enjoyment.  Highly recommended.",1426982400,,1007,5.229813664596273
8435597,3,B004M7FBQ0,"(Contains mild spoilers) ""Amer"" has cinematically clever visuals, but in the end it turns into a too long exposition of the possible consequences of sexual repression among the Belgian rural bourgeoisie. As seen through a little girl's eyes, the first part dedicated to the childhood of a woman called Ana, is a fascinating tale filled with horror images that illustrate the child's fears: in the way horror films touch our most private emotions and evoke our childhood interpretations of reality, these images correspond to that phase in Ana's growth. The second part is perhaps the most erotic of the three phases in Anas life, starting with the transition to adolescence, filled with visions of soft skin, pubic hair and a most curious ant that comes out of her belly button. This section is treated as a sunny melodrama of the aging Italian mother's jealousy of her pretty daughter, as young Ana attracts all the males' attention, while mamma dyes her hair in the local beauty parlor, and frustrates the girl's awkward attempts to connect with boys. For the third section, it is interesting that -in these days of shaven, tattooed males- the directors decided to illustrate the transition to adulthood with downy hairs, fuzzy male arms, as in the sequence in the train, where adult Ana is surrounded by male passengers. But this third part is inevitably the less attractive, for this time all the hallucinations are but the tired expression of Ana's repression. She has apparently let life and fulfilment pass her by, so her return to the sumptuous and beautiful villa by the sea, where she grew up, inexorably leads to tragedy. An unusual drama, intelligently told, but I would have been grateful for a shorter running time, especially in this third sad section.",1425081600,,1767,4.972972972972973

It's fine to have the story unfold in a deliberately slow manner, but as an audience member I should at least be able to care enough about what's going on to make an effort of understanding it.",1407456000,,440,4.653846153846154
8435601,5,B004M7FBQ0,"Many have tried and a few have come close to harnessing the kind of alternating current a romantic male-female directing-writing team couple can generate: Debra Hill and John Carpenter came as close as anyone with Halloween (1978) but every film has to get up from the table and go pick a bathroom sooner or later. No film has made it all the way past the border of gender and to the boundary of the split subject, smashing through the wall between the bathroom doors and finding its own special hidden alcove. Amer isn't male gaze or the female gaze but both gazes sliced up in long celluloid pupil Laura Mars strips and arranged in surrealist-giallo eye close-up layers to form something as new as neither, as referential as Tarantino and transgressive as Argento without relying on anything so paltry as meaning, story, narrative, coherence or logic... or even cheap shocks. The Belgian male-female director-writer-editor team of (real life lovers) H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Cattet and Bruno Forzani seems mirrored in the zig-zag rhythm of the shots - one step into giallo narrative (he's Italian), one step back along fractured dream abstracted surrealism (she's French), each refracting and reflecting the predecessor - move, countermove and so no show is ever clear OR unclear. Everything resists a concrete interpretation but beguiles us into wanting one, using our craving for story for its own purposes: it doesn't charge ahead like a boy with an Uzi and climax or dissolve into curios like a girl with a flower, yet if you don't dismiss it all as girly stuff or misogynist or waste time trying to know what's going on, if you just ride with it, but remain alert and enthralled and ideally high on lack of sleep and Jung and art and Robitussin, then there it is, in its sublime perfection, the mind--both halves--inner and outer, conscious ego and unconscious animus locking into place while busting open at the same time. The unconscious's language signifiers become reshuffled, the normal narrative progression cracked open like a nut, the inside goodness free falling in slow motion and for a moment you and the unconscious and the images onscreen are all one - the barrier of screen and speaker between you has evaporated.",1401235200,4,2230,4.981233243967829
