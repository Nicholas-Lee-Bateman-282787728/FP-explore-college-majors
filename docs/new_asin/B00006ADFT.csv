1738087,5,B00006ADFT,"It's hysterical. If you like sometimes rude but not crude humor, this is the movie for you. I don't really know what else to say about this movie other than BUY IT! If you're not sure about it, rent it. You have to see this. DVD's are so much better than VHS tapes, you get special features, behinds the scenes and interactive menus. This is my favorite DVD.",1030838400,3,358,4.279411764705882
1738088,4,B00006ADFT,"well, there's definitely nothing new about the story line. it's basically an amalgam of other successful college films plus drag movies... hmm... even one of them looks like he came in from the set of ""to wong foo, thanks for eveything, julie newmar""! the good and the bad sides are most stereotypical, especially the nasty ones are rather 2-dimensional. but then, in real life college kids *can* be 2-dimensional!
that said, this film is an absolute gem! it's funny like hell and heck, totally wacky. i find it endearing coz the jokes aren't necessarily obvious. you have to keep your eyes peeled or you might miss something totally hilarious! my cousin and i kept laughing through out, much to the consternation of the other movie-goers... i can't help it if they didn't get the jokes, can i? the boys are quite cute as girls too... 'adina' has a top butt if you ask me, and 'daisy' is sooo sweet! of course, the fact that they *are* big and tall kinda makes it unbelievable how the others can't see through the disguise.
the script has it moments, especially interactions between the boys when they are in DOG... and when they went shopping! hah!
it's funny... but leave your brain on hold. this is strictly good, wacky fun!",1027987200,5,1227,4.685185185185185

1738107,5,B00006ADFT,"This movie is hilarious! It's obviously not child appropriate and I personally would not let a teenager watch it with me because there are scenes in which dildos are being used as ammo in a giant sling shot, as well as a scene depicting a dildo fight. The name of the fraternity in the movie is also KOK...so it's a good watch for adults only.

1738316,3,B00006ADFT,"While the laughs aren't huge, they are there, and while you won't be laughing every time you watch it (assuming that you watch it more than once), the first time will deliver a slew of mildly entertaining takes on rather uninspired gags (yes, we've seen almost all of these gags before, done better I might add) and yet, there is something about `Sorority Boys' that makes it enjoyable.  Maybe it's because the film feels so wrong that it works, but I can't help but admit that this is semi-enjoyable and definitely NOT the worst way to waste an afternoon.  Some of the gags are preposterous, and the `let's learn a lesson' ending is totally wasted on the remainder of the film (let's be honest, this film wasn't made to `make a difference') but the overall effect of the film is one of enjoyment.  Harland Williams is hilariously dim-witted and Heather Matarazzo is pretty hot, even as a nerd.  The love story that develops between Matarazzo and Barry Watson is unrealistic (this whole film is unrealistic, but what else did you expect) but it's expected and so you can't fault it too much (guys and girls cannot coexist without `something' blossoming).  Alas, it's a guilty pleasure but one that is worth indulging in at least once.  That football scene is pretty great, and Williams' Wookie impression will certainly steel a chuckle or two.",1318809600,,1343,4.767241379310345
1738317,5,B00006ADFT,"I just saw this movie this month it has been out for years. I saw a glimps of it on TV and couldn't stop laughing. Michael Rosenbaum seems to steal the whole show for me. His facial expressions speaks volumes for a comedien (He is like a male Carol Burnett). Also I thought he looked the best as a women very convincing, quirky,and adorable. I ended up buying the movie for my collection. When I saw the whole film from beginning to end. I couldn't stop laughing and realize this movie is a gem.
Great storyline, acting, casting. It just made me happy remembering the crazy expressions of Michael Rosenbaum. He is a wonderful actor. I have my radar out for any of his works now. The director,stunt coordinator, assistant director, makeup artist all did a wonderful job. You can tell everyone who was associated with the making of this film really had a good time and it definetly shows in the movie. I wish they made a sequel to this movie or even turned it into a sitcom for TV with these three actors starring in it. It would be so refreshing to watch and a lot better then these predictable comedies you see year after year, season after season. Unfortunetly I know main stream Americans would be offended. Oh well it will at least be forever be a classic movie for anyone who has an opened mind and loves to laugh.

Michael Rosenbaum your great comedian and wonderful actor!",1316649600,2,1378,4.49003984063745

1738320,3,B00006ADFT,"I many ways, Sorority Girls comes across as a successor to Animal House. It's got its own humor, but of course isn't as funny as the classic. There are some times when the characters just seem too dumb (like the blonde girl and guy disguised as a girl taking a shower - as if she wouldn't notice something odd...). Nonetheless, it is funny and might be worth checking out if you liked Animal House.",1279411200,,398,4.391891891891892
1738321,3,B00006ADFT,"For me, each genre of film has its own rating scale, so when I see a film like this ""teen school romance comedy"", I already know how it's going to begin and end. 'Sorority Boys' will not win points for originality, but the cast's enthusiasm more than makes up for it. Harland Williams is just funny to look at and while the film loses steam halfway through, it is very funny for the first hour and finishes the way we expect it to.

This teenage ""coming of age"" movie makes use of all the expected components of life on a college campus; all-night parties, lots of beer and grass, hot and loose young women and a storyline sprinkled with just enough hints of a redeeming subplot to make the audience feel like they're watching something meaningful.

Add to the mix three frat guys dressed up like girls who receive a rude awakening when they experience how the ""other half"" live and you've got `Sorority Boys' in a nutshell.

I'll admit it, I was skeptical when my good friend invited me over to watch Sorority Boys, a gender-bending, bathroom humor-filled college comedy about three frat boys who dress up as girls join the D.O.G. House to clear their names within their fraternity, the K.O.Ks. (Yes, all the humor is just that dreadful). It just didn't sound like ""my kind of movie.""

What ensues, however, as the guys continue their plan, is ample hilarity as these former K.O.Ks learn what it's like to be on the receiving end, teach the D.O.G. girls a little lesson in confidence (""Haven't you read the stories about SPORTS and SELF ESTEEM??""), and bring down the evil, puffy-haired president of the K.O.K. house.

Don't watch it alone (it's a great dumb movie night movie), and don't expect it to be deep. Funnier than American Pie, but just as crude.

1738362,3,B00006ADFT,"This comedy is nothing new to those of you who've seen the onslaught of teen, campy, sex-filled comedies.  I will say thought that despite all that, this film is still good for a few laughs, none of which are forced, and it's a nice deversion to a rainy afternoon.  Barry Watson, Harland Williams & Michael Rosenbaum play three alumni in the KOK house, a franernity who specializes of getting high and humiliating college girls.  Heather Matarazzo plays the leader of the DOG house, a fraternity filled with the 'ugly' girls that are fighting for woman rights.  When are three male sexist's get tossed out of the KOK house after being accused of stealing money they are forced to join the DOG house, posing as girls, in order to retreave a video tape from the KOK house that proves their innocence.  Neather of the boys look like women in drag but the fact that they don't is what makes it so funny.  While no where near as funny as 'White Chicks' it still, as I mentioned, delivers some honest laughs.  The first half of the film is a bit redundant for we've all seen the college comedy when the guys act like pigs and sleep with girl after girl...so it's not until they get dragged out that the film delivers for me.  The romance that forms between Barry Watson's character and Heather Matarazzo (who by the way is NO UGLY GIRL) is ammusing and the DOG circle scene when they tell something about themselves is hilarious.  Personally I feel that Harland Williams delivers the most laughs for many reasons, the most notable being how absolutly hidious he is in drag (or out for that matter) but with that mop of red locks he takes the cake for most humorus to look at.  This film won't inspire you and it won't make your favorite funny movies list, but it will make you chuckle, at least a little bit...(and I'll mention that the voice of the leader of the KOK house is so incredibly annoying that it's funny...really funny!)",1151884800,,1926,4.540462427745664
1738363,4,B00006ADFT,"Well, I first heard about this film while searching for a smallville season boxset and clicked on the link to films Michael Rosenbaum had starred in and thought it looked funny. (Also I am curoius as to why Rosenbaum seems to like dressing up as women as I recently discovered he also wore women's clothes in Sweet November! I think he must have a fetish! LOL) So when I was at my local DVD rental shop I decided to see if it was worth a look... well it was! I was literally rolling about the floor laughing my head off! In short it's about 3 guys who get kicked out of their house and the only way to get back in is to join the D.O.G house by dressing as women.  For ones who say it's sexist it isn't! I actually found that it taught a lesson to males out there to be much nicer to women and respect them but this film does it in a funny way which is good! I especially thought Michael Rosenbaum was very convincing as a women and infact found it hard to take him seriously as Lex when I next watched Smallville. Sure this film is full of crude male jokes but that's what makes this film so hilarious, I loved every minute of this fun, silly comedy that will have tears rolling down your cheeks! The fact that the boys realise they have been soo cruel and nasty to these poor 'ugly' girls is a good lesson for such males that take that attitude of 'judging a book by it's cover.' The boys then change their attitudes when they are subjected to the same torture as these girls and basically they see how it feels to be treated like that and don't like it, so they decide to start over and treat them with respect! It's a must see for Smallville fans who like Michael Rosenbaum as it is simply ridiculously funny.

1738365,3,B00006ADFT,"Ok, Sorority Boys isn't going to be studied by film students probably ever. Sure, the film isn't exactly original in the story or what it's trying to say. Still, it's a funny movie, if you don't expect greatness.

The only real thing to do is to talk about the people in the movie. It's been said by others that Heather Matarazzo shouldn't be cast as an ugly girl, which is highly true. As a matter of fact, none of the girls in the D.O.G. house would ever be considered ugly. Still, the actresses, in the main speaking roles, manage to make the most that they can and can speak to anyone who has suffered the cruelty of being considered ugly. The less said of the fraternity brothers the better, though I must say that the voice of the president is really, really irritating. As for the the three main guys/girls, they're all likeable. Harland Williams is probably the least funny of the main three, but this probably stems from the fact that he has to play the guy who's been in college forever role and he's stuck with a really hideous wig. Barry Watson is probably the least likeable because he doesn't seem as fixated on women, especially women as objects. Still, he isn't the funniest person in the movie. That title has to go to Michael Rosenbaum. As Adam/Adina, Rosenbaum shows considerable comedic skills and personally is the one guy who manages to look fairly close to a girl.

I do have one problem with the movie. I dislike the way that Women Studies courses are shown in the movie. They aren't just for women and they aren't sexist, like the one shown in the movie. As a matter of fact, the class undermines to some extent the positive women message.

So, it isn't Citizen Kane. It is a good way to spend an afternoon or evening. It's guaranteed to get a few chuckles out of you.",1126828800,3,1793,4.460365853658536

1738369,3,B00006ADFT,"The plot of Sorority Boys can best be summed up as: Animal House meets Revenge Of The Nerds meets Tootsie, plus lashings of American Pie thrown in for good measure.

In an unnamed university campus somewhere in America, there is a fraternity called Kappa Omicron Kappa (""KOK"" - yes, we all get the joke) filled with rejects from Animal House. They hold wild parties where they invite the beautiful girls from the Tri Pi sorority. Any girl caught sleeping with stud jock Adam (Michael Rosenbaum) gets to do the Walk Of Shame the next day where she gets jeered by frat brothers lining up on the corridor outside Adam's room and her photograph taken for posterity. Ugly girls are not allowed, and there are special teams of ""dog catchers"" to roust them out.

Needless to say, all is not well. Adam and his roommates Dave (Barry Watson) - the ""smart"" one - and Doofer (Harland Williams) - the big and dumb one - are accused of pilfering the frat funds and are expelled from KOK by the snivelling president Spence (Brad Beyer) - who has a weird voice and pompadour hairstyle to give us a hint that he's going to be the bad guy.

The boys are in trouble, for if they don't belong in the fraternity, then they won't be able to attend the annual Cocktail Cruise where they get to mingle with ex-frat members (in most cases their parents) who have graduated and have since become industry power figures. And if they don't attend the cruise they won't have the opportunity to secure plum jobs using the Old Boys Network and they may be doomed to live lives of obscurity and poverty!

In desperation, they dress up as girls to sneak back into the fraternity in order to retrieve a video tape which may hold crucial evidence that demonstrates their innocence and identify the real culprit who have stolen the money. Needless to say, they get nabbed by the dog catchers and deposited in front of the Delta Omicron Gamma sorority (""DOG"" - yawn).

DOG contains the female equivalents of nerds and geeks - ugly girls, big girls, girls with loud annoying voices, ethnic girls, ... The president of DOG, Leah (Melissa Sagemiller), takes pity on them and invites them to pledge with the sorority. At first they refuse, but then when they found out they get free lodging and food ...

 The rest of the film are full of jokes involving the guys trying to act as women and survive on campus, bonding with the girls in the sorority, discovering their feminine sides, and finding out that life is not so easy if you are a DOG. All the degrading things they did to DOGs are now being done to them, especially when a young KOK takes a fancy to ""Adina"" (Adam) and we know that eventually Adam will have to experience the Walk of Shame!

I liked the premise of the boys discovering their female sides and what life is like for the other sex, and the film certainly had a lot of opportunity to explore some interesting issues. But no, the filmmakers have decided to go for the lowest common denominator and exploited just about every clich in the genre. In the end, we get something that is tedious and disappointing rather than something original and witty.

What would have made the film really interesting is if at least one of the boys discovers that he prefers living as a woman (preferably all three), and then the rest of the film could explore how this affects their relationships with each other and the other characters. We certainly come tantalisingly close - one of the boys is on the verge of entering into a lesbian relationship, another has the opportunity to experience a relationship with a man, and the third discovers the the joys of sisterhood bonding. But just as things become interesting, the film backs down and we're all back in Kansas. Oh well ...",1105315200,3,3744,4.576119402985075

Now I own the DVD, and I can't count the number of times I've seen it.  No, it's not an original concept, and no, it's not Animal House.  I don't think they're really trying to be another Animal House, though, even if they give quite a few nods to that movie.

What this movie is, is something light and comedic that you can sit back and enjoy.  The comedy is crude at times but well done, from the play on relationships to a dildo fencing match.

As I said, you'll either love it or hate it.  If you're the type of person who has to think about any movie you see, you should probably move on to a movie that takes itself more seriously, because this one does nothing of the sort.  If you're looking for Animal House, try searching under ""Animal House"".  Just a suggestion.

Beyond the mere comedy of the movie, they do actually have some messages hidden underneath, and we're not talking boxers or briefs.  It's a common theme about gender perceptions, peer pressure and self-esteem.  So maybe there's something to think about after all.",1100044800,6,1163,4.378504672897196
1738371,1,B00006ADFT,"The makers of this drivel owe me $8.75. That's the money (and two hours) I wasted on Sorority Boys after reading a positive review of the movie. No, I wasn't expecting ""The Age of Innocence"" from this film, but there have been some ""guys in drag"" classics over the years and I thought maybe this might be fun. This movie is incredibly bad, I don't know where to begin. It's embarrassingly bad. Frankly, it's downright STUPID.

This is a Hollywood movie, so it must have had a decent budget. But being creative with money was obviously beyond the director and producers' grasp. The three actors in drag are so badly made up with cheap wigs and unbelievable costumes that you'd have to be a complete imbecile to think that they were actually women!!! I've seen community theaters do a better job than this. And all the characters in this movie believe that they are women; are they blind! Is it a star trek time flux! After all, the movie does take place at a college as opposed to an insane assylum.

OK, so realism isn't one of this movie's fortes! I'm still flabbergasted that ladies who have commented on this movie didn't find the cheap comic exploitation of women (wet tee shirts, ugly girls referred to as dogs, girls with facial hair etc. etc.) in the film appalling!

It's equally distressing to have to sit through the film's sleazy working of an audience's assumed homophobia. I wonder how many viewers stayed to the end of the credits for the big surprise cannibalism scene!!!!. Funny! No. Stupid! Yes!

This movie might have made a pleasant diversion with a better script and a better director. There's nothing wrong with the premise. The talented actors who play the lead roles must have had some inkling of how degrading the entire movie really is.

What's really depressing, is that many of our teenagers in the USA actually find this movie a worthwhile entertainment.

1738392,2,B00006ADFT,"I remember this movie being heavily marketed on TV when it was released in the theatre.  Sadly you can hype it all you want but a turkey is still a turkey.  Some boys get unfairly kicked out of a fraternity and take refuge in a sorority across the road while they plot how to obtain the evidence that would clear their name and reputations.  Along the way they alternately fall in love, bond with the ""ugly"" sorority and expose their fraternity brothers for being the date-raping morons we all new they were at the start.
This movie has a few good set pieces and scenes, but ultimately we've come to expect a lot more from the teen movie these days on the back of such seminal films as American Pie and Road Trip.  This movie is sadly nowhere near in the league of those two.  The actors lack charisma, the plot drags and lacks sparkle, and the whole concept is so widely outside the realms of possibility it just irritates.
The scariest things about this movie though are its social commentary undercurrents.  Get this, the ""feminist"" sorority is full of ugly militant lesbian chicks who secretly despise themselves and each other and only come to believe in themselves by beating the ""beautiful sorority"" at Football.  They seek validation for themselves by attracting frankly lame frat boys and are heartbroken when this does not materialize, ostensibly because of the fact they're all fairly ugly and badly dressed.  Except of course the girl that the lead male character falls for who is actually pretty hot - once she takes off her glasses.

For instance, what are the chances that only one girl would ever walk in on Dave in the shower and that she would be all but blind?  Even then, I think she would notice that there is something ""extra"" there that shouldn't be or that ""she"" is missing something else.  And what about the other two guys?  Do they never take showers there?  Also, the whole thing with the dildo fight was kinda silly.  I doubt Leah would just keep them in a basket in full view--I would think she would get rid of them.

Three fraternity brothers are terminated from their house due to theft suspicions.  To prove their innocence, they must find the videotape.  The only way they can sneak into the house is to pose as women.  When karma kicks them in the a**, they realize the truths of their past behavior, especially toward women.  Many twists and turns build the story's theme as the three men struggle to keep their identities a secret from their new sorority.
Most of ""Sorority Boys"" may sound unrealistic to most people due to its provocative theme.  Its humor makes up for everything.  No dull moment was released in this film.  The producers and the writers know how to keep the audience's eyes wide open to the film.  Throughout, it teaches all of the stereotypes made against women and frat men.  Some may call this education an eyeopener, some may just call it unusual humor.  Either way, the audience will continue laughing from beginning to end.

1738398,2,B00006ADFT,"You know the formula, don't you?  Some losers get into trouble (need money, are going to be kicked out of school, want to get chicks/guys), so they design some hairbrained scheme to solve their problems.  Gross-out humor ensues as losers struggle through what turned out to be an awful plan, and they begin to realize that they've misjudged something all along.  Then they have some kind of contest or game to finally win their prize (whatever that may be) and learn a valuable lesson in the end.
We have seen this SO many times (just think about comedies like Van Wilder, Road Trip, Old School, etc).  That doesn't necessarily mean that we should not watch these movies.  Sometimes it's fun to watch a mindless movie so we don't have to think.  Sorority Boys is the opportunity to do just that.
Here's what qualifies in the formula for this movie.  1. The Trouble:  Three frat brothers of Kappa Omicron Kappa (Barry Watson, Michael Rosenbaum, Harland Williams) get kicked out of their house after they were suspected of stealing fundraiser money.  They must get proof that they were set up by the annoying fraternity president.  2. The Hairbrained Scheme: Dress up in drag and join an unpopular sorority called Delta Omicron Gamma (DOG...get it?).  3. Gross-out Humor:  Projectile sex toys, fake boobs, liaisons with unsuspecting frat boys, etc.  4. Realization:  These ""ugly"" girls they used to make fun of are not as ugly or as repulsive as they thought.  5. Game to win prize:  Touch football contest with snobby Tri Pi sorority.  6. Valuable Lesson:  People cannot be judged by their looks.
There are a few funny moments in this film, I won't deny that.  But I can't really say this was an original effort.  It also bothers me that this R-rated sex romp may have been targeted toward a younger audience with the casting of Watson, star of the popular squeaky-clean WB series 7th Heaven.  It does get quite raunchy in a few spots.
While I think someone could enjoy Sorority Boys if they suspend their disbelief for about an hour and a half (because, let's face it, there is no WAY these men would pass for women in reality), I do feel that this gross-out genre itself is getting tired.  I think writers need to discover new ways to make us laugh, and stop recycling the same thing.",1055376000,2,2285,4.688442211055277
1738399,3,B00006ADFT,"When I first heard of this movie I thought, NO WAY! Deciding to give it a chance was a right move. It was crude and funny through out. I'm sure it offended some. However, I dug it. And I did notice the film throws in a positive message. After being framed for stealing the frat house cash, three dudes turn to drag in order to get back in and prove their innocence. In doing so they must get their hands on a vhs tape that will indeed set things  straight. The promise is a shue-in for setting things up for a comedy with good laughs. Just about every scene provides a belly laugh, chuckle or smile. So for some alternative American pie, have a slice of ""Sorority Boys"".",1053907200,,670,4.234375
1738400,1,B00006ADFT,"Sorority Boys (Wallace Wolodarsky, 2002)
Every once in a while, American film snobs wonder why every other country on the planet from Japan to Togo whips [us] at Cannes every year. Ladies and gentlemen, I offer you prosecution exhibit A, Sorority Boys. First, why Wallace Wolodarsky was given a camera again after the farce that was Coldblooded is utterly beyond me (the only saving grace is that Hollywod took seven years to green-light him again after that debacle). Second, I don't care how good Melissa Sagemiller looks (and she looks even better here than she did in the awful Soul Survivors), she can't save a film on sex appeal alone. Third, when your talent pool's three male leads are veterans of such classic cinematic fare as Co-ed Call Girl (Barry Watson), Urban Legend (Michael Rosenbaum), and Freddy Got Fingered (Harland Williams), you know you're not going to be producing the next Citizen Kane. (As a side note, pity poor Heather Matarazzo, whose career is taking the Keanu Reeves track: start out in some of the most critically-acclaimed films of the decade, make a few mindless comedies, and spend more than a decade trying to repair the damage done. Matarazzo has a slight chance with the potentially fine film 10029, coming out next year... if anyone ever sees it.)
Then add a classic plot. In this case, three losers (Watson, Rosenbaum, Williams) are unable to join their fraternity of choice, despite one's father being an alumnus. So, instead, in order to get revenge, they cross-dress and join a rival sorority. With the expected results. Very expected, in fact. Not a joke here that we haven't already heard a hundred times or so in other films (though admittedly, a few of them still get laughs). Not a plot twist left untied. Not a trick left unpaid. You name it, if it's a clich about bad teen comedy, it applies.
The one redeeming feature of this movie isn't in the movie at all, actually. One of the extras on the DVD is a montage of behind-the-scenes shots filmed form the points of view of the director, makeup artist, etc. using portable fiber-optic cameras. Now THIS is a load of fun. Far more than the film itself, actually, and the directors of other, better things would do well to take note. (Wouldn't you have loved to see some special effects from, say, The Terminator or The Abyss through the eyes of Jim Cameron's special effects guy?)
I don't think ""avoid like the plague"" is strong enough, It's not as mind-numbingly awful as American Pie, but it's close. * ",1047254400,2,2503,4.767281105990784
1738419,4,B00006ADFT,"After seeing the preview for this movie, I had no intention of ever seeing it.  Never.  It looked stupid and unfunny.  Well, suffice it to say that I ended up watching this movie and to be perfectly honest...it wasn't that bad.
The premise has been reported in other reviews, but I'll briefly mention it.  Three fraternity guys are kicked out of their fraternity under suspicion of stealing the money from the event planning fund.  They suspect the fraternity president.  They dress up as women to try to sneak into the house and find the evidence of the theft, but since they are so ugly they are ejected from the house and end up on the lawn of the neighboring sorority house: D.O.G., a house of social rejects.  In order to have a better opportunity to learn the truth, they pledge D.O.G. (they were invited in by the sorority president).  The rest of the movie deals with the three guys living as women in a house of the campus rejects.  Naturally they grow up a little and see things in a different light.
The movie sounded like it was going to be very dumb and not funny at all.  I was wrong.  The movie is kind of dumb, but it is very funny.  While this movie will never win an award, if you are looking for a nice popcorn flick to take your mind off of serious matters....this is the one for you.",1045008000,,1304,4.3429752066115705
1738420,4,B00006ADFT,"Sorority Boys is funny just on the basis that the 3 Sorority Boys are seriously the most unconvincing girls I've ever seen. Yes, even worse than Dennis Rodman when he wore that wedding dress.
It's about 3 guys who are in charge of the Treasury of their Frat (KOK) and because of a jealous house speaker, the money comes up missing and the 3 guys are kicked out of the frat until they can find where the money went. They're first plan is to sneak into their frat house during a party and they dress up as girls to try to accomplish that but are foiled as they are kicked out and left outside the doorstep of the FOG sorority, a sorority of ""outcast"" girls, who take in the guys thinking they are plus size girls.
I went into this movie thinking it was going to stink but it turned out to be really funny. Trust me the 3 guys dressed as the girls are pretty funny plus there's just some really outlandishly funny scenes in this one. Some of the humor is cheap ... jokes but it's still funny.
This is a pretty good buy because it'll keep you laughing the whole way through, especially when the girls are playing football and of course, when the DOG girls are partying in their house doing some normal college drug use. Again, funny movie and if you're still looking for laughs, check out AMERICAN PIE 2.",1039132800,,1300,4.310204081632653
1738421,1,B00006ADFT,"I just reviewed ""The New Guy"", and lamented about how bad teen movies still were. Now graduating to the college level, I find a movie that's much, much worse. If ""The New Guy"", who's lead character is more charismatic than anything in this movie gets one star, where is there to go when you find this one?
I don't have a problem with gross-out or infantile humor. Chris Rock does it well, and even Dice Clay knows what buttons to push to cut through our civilized defenses. In the movies, when Mel Gibson leaves a condom tree on Danny Glover's desk, it works because the absurdity is presented in contrast to an otherwise sane world.
That's not the case in this movie, where EVERYBODY seems stupid. I know we are expected to cut some slack when Dustin Hoffman and Babs Streisand don't really look like the opposite sex in their movies. But this movie doesn't even try to do a good job of disguising them. They just plop on bad wigs and [bad] clothes, and that's it. When the ladies also occasionally need a shave, it shows how much the filmmakers care about a good product.
Which leaves the other actors, who are saddled with wooden stupidity to begin with, with a tougher job. They now have to pretend that these creatures with broad shoulders, prominent Adam's apples, and five-o'clock shadows are perfectly acceptable in a women's shower, can be accepted in a sorority, and are material to be hit on.
Oh yes, it does have nudity, which I suppose is the draw for a lot of people. If this is the case, spend a few minutes on the Internet, get it out of your system, and then get a better movie. I suppose a good one can be made using this story line, but this one is just bad from every aspect of filmmaking.",1039046400,2,1709,4.428571428571429
1738422,4,B00006ADFT,"I don't know if there's a guy out there who would like this movie.  Lord knows I never even dreamed of running it for hubby.  But on a very stressed out day for me, where my brain was overexhausted by work on this computer, I must confess this film did the trick.  I enjoyed and laughed at this slight confection of three frat guys who are forced to pledge the girl's sorority on campus which houses all the ""dog"" girls. The 3 of them are members of the biggest hell raising frat on campus but they must lurk undercover while being suspected of stealing the frat's cruise fund.  The reason this works is that the 3 lead guys are surprisingly likable and cute, whether in drag or out. The one who was the worst with the ladies has one of his own frat brothers pursue him as a woman and it is very funny when he walks the frat's Hall of Shame. He slugs a few of those same brothers (as a woman) and that is a great moment.  All in all, a fun diversion.

The Sorority Boys videotape I rented at Hollywood Video was censored.

As the movie started I figured I'd last about 15 min. because it looked to be so awful.  But it grew on me and I got into it, and before I knew it I was laughing and enjoying it.  It's the type of movie that is brain candy.  It's simple and obvious jokes.  But the reason it works is because of the characters in it, that's what hooked me.  The bottom line is they're funny.

1738425,3,B00006ADFT,"Sorority Boys is a movie that we've seen done a dozen different ways over the years - - and yet, it is a fresh retelling of the tale.  Hilariously so.
In a very brief nutshell, the plot is this:  When three of the most popular brothers of the fraternity KOK (get it? - it's very lame, but let it alone), are accused of stealing all the money required to throw a huge shindig, they are thrown out of the fraternity.  In a half-baked attempt to retrieve a video tape that shows the real culprit, the three dress as girls and try to infiltrate the KOK frat house.  They fail and are somehow invited to join the DOG sorority (lame again, but leave it alone) where they will plan their revenge on their frat.
First of all, this movie shares no ground with reality.  Just know that going in and you will have a heck of a good time watching this movie.  It is part ""Animal House,"" part ""What's Love Got to Do with It?,"" and part ""Some Like it Hot.""  Of the three boys who go in drag, Barry Watson (of TV's 7th Heaven) is the only one who might remotely be convincing as a girl.  It seems that no real concerted attempt was made to disguise or cover up the boys' dark beard traces.  It is almost a wink to the audience that we are watching camp and that the whole film is for fun.  Indeed, the other characters never seem to notice the beards or the adam's apples present in the boys.  We are even supposed to believe that one of the boys continually showers with a near sighted sorority sister without the girl ever discovering what is really ""poking her in the bottom.""  The actors seem to have a lot of fun with their ""female"" selves and play their parts deftly.  It is quite funny to watch one of the characters fuss over his perceived ""fat *ss,"" while Watson knowingly admits he makes a beautiful woman.  You would think that a film of this caliber would have shown its best scenes in the trailers, but that is not the case here.
This movie is absolutely hilarious in many instances and is also ridiculously silly throughout.  The filmmakers knew this when they made it.  The actors knew it when they were making it.  Well, then, the audience should know that when they view it.  It is a fun movie!
The nod to ""Animal House"" is apparent to someone as old as I am in that two of the actors from that film are prominently featured in cameo roles:  the Dean of Students from Animal House plays a lascivious old man in this film; and Niedermieir from Animal House appears as the ""go to"" man for Barry Watson's character in his search for employment after he graduates.
The one big misfire in this film is the fact that Watson's character's job acceptance and his later revealing his alter ego are never tied together.  Somehow it seems one should have had something to do with the other.
But this film isn't about a deep plot.  It's a film with an actual plot that was created as a vehicle for some immensely entertaining schtick and some more than decent acting and comedy.
