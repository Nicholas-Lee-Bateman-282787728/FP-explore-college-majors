4236384,5,B003ZW7XB4,"Cant wait to try all the patinas showed on the DVD. What a great variety with so many tips on how to get them done right the first time.

I hanve now tried several. Sure worked like it was supposed to and found some other new patinas along the way. Bottom line is - don't be afraid to try new ways, but be sure your metal it CLEAN!",1350604800,,331,3.8676470588235294
4236385,4,B003ZW7XB4,"Arrived in good shape.  Information on disc for Patina's on metal were everything i hoped they wouold be.  Easy to understand, and follow.  But, Tim McC. is always
really good.",1343692800,,176,4.8
4236386,4,B003ZW7XB4,"Having used Tim McCreight's patina recipes from his book The Complete Metalsmith it was great to see him putting them into practice himself. Even though I have tried most of his methods I still learned a great deal from the DVD. A coupleof criticisms are that we didn't really need to see him draw all those lines on the silver with the black pen - just a couple would have been sufficient, and I was a little alarmed at his cavalier approach to the ammonia fumes - it is not good to inhale and it probably would have been better to do it in front of an open window or outside. Even though this is easily obtained from the supermarket it should still be regarded with respect.",1341014400,5,676,4.330708661417323
4236387,2,B003ZW7XB4,"Try to buy a book, get a CD. The picture show is a book, but I got a CD. What I can say?",1326153600,3,88,2.869565217391304
4236388,4,B003ZW7XB4,A good overview of use common household items to easily create patinas for metal and how to apply them complete with helpful illustrations.,1326067200,4,139,5.086956521739131
4236389,5,B003ZW7XB4,"I usually don't have the patience to watch instructional videos but this one is so well done, I didn't mind at all.  Tim McCreight is an excellent teacher and makes the experience interesting and enjoyable.  He keeps things moving so I didn't feel bored or impatient with the pace of the video.  The recipes he demonstrates had me itching to try some of the patinas right away.  He clearly shows the method and the equipment needed, explains the process and the ingredients, shows examples of metals in various stages of patina layers, and gives tips as to how to purchase  materials and equipment that can be used.  Overall, unless you already have a good knowledge of patinas, this is a video well worth watching.",1296086400,12,715,4.725806451612903
4236390,5,B003ZW7XB4,"I love patinas on metals and Tim McCreight has made a DVD that I've been waiting for for years. This type of information hasn't really been available all in one place, and Tim has put it all together for us, just like he did in ""Complete Metalsmith."" McCreight has a way of finding a need and filling it. The DVD is very accessible and should be in every studio.",1285372800,24,362,4.260869565217392
4236391,4,B003ZW7XB4,"Let me say right out and up front that I'm a big fan of Tim's books and dvd's. He has some of the best books on the subjects of metalsmithing. That said this DVD is going to be another cornerstone in metalsmithing. Whether you are into jewelry, small sculpture, large sculpture or other metal folding, shaping work that requires patina's. Or just if you are interested in patina's or patination of your work. This is a great beginners,basic teaching aid.

It is just what it says on the title and sub title. This uses readily available kitchen chemicals, and household products. He does digress into a few store bought liquid solutions such as gun blue and Jax brand green patina liquid.

What is great about the DVD are the high production standards, as far as sound, and picture quality are. You can see everything, hear everything and there are plenty of closeups of the finished patinas. Along with the formulas of the patina mixes on screen.

Divided into chapters from what equipment you need, safety and the basic use of the materials. To the assorted patina's he covers along with cold, hot, brush, spray, fume and buried application. To wax and other sealers and protectors (Rattle can type)

It is in his laid back, relaxed style he covers some things that could be called patination outside the box. When he is talking about the use of resists, and coffee grounds in a buried patina.

There are printable pages of instructions (PDF) format along with the video content.

Make no mistake this isn't a chemistry course, or a course in using the more exotic chemicals to create repeatable patina's on hundreds of duplicate pieces. It is a basic, small scale patina's that can be scaled up for larger work. Using safe (which is a realitive term when talking about vinegar, table salt, ammonia and copper sulphate) solutions found around the home.

If you are unsure about some of the other materials for patina's for silver,brass, copper, and bronze. With a little practice and experimentation. I think you will be happy with this DVD and the results.",1283817600,46,2058,4.780281690140845
