Not as good a book as I was expecting, however, still managed to stimulate discussion about how come there wasn't any electricity - therefore no computers, light, ipods, etc. Grandaughter (9) and grandson (4) did not return to this book as much as others in the series of ""What was it like when ..... "". However, it was still a learning event in a fun way.",1320451200,3,441,4.45679012345679

8383992,5,B002Y06VIO,"So You Want to Be President? is another absolutely spectacular release in the Scholastic Storybook Treasures series of DVDs which gather groups of animated children's book adaptations together on disc. This topically focused collection focuses upon American politics: the history of her past presidents, a modern look at Capitol Hill, a little girl's presidential aspirations, and one woman's journey towards voting equality.

""So You Want to be President"" (26 minutes) is based upon the heavily awarded and well-loved children's picture book of the same title by Judith St. George. The playful use of illustrator David Small's caricatures, kid-friendly facts about past presidents, and a heaping dose of humor along with presidential trivia make this animated version an even bigger hit (if possible) than the book! Based on the 2000 edition of this title (there is an updated 2004 picture book available), this short film ends with George W. Bush's controversial election (Election 2000).

""My Senator and Me: A Dog's-Eye View of Washington, D.C."" (26 minutes) is written Senator Edward M. Kennedy and follows him through his daily rounds through the eyes of his loyal and affable Portuguese water dog. Splash's playful perspective makes learning about the process of approving bills easy to understand and follow for young children.

""Madam President"" (9 minutes and my six-year-old's favorite) follows a young girl's slightly megalomaniac aspirations to the presidency while ""I Can Do That! Esther Morris Gets Women the Vote"" (16 minutes) follows the true-life story of Esther Morris and her journey towards political equality for women the state of Wyoming.

The optional read-along sub-titling highlights each word as it is narrated, providing an English-rich environment for aspiring young readers. Bonuses include an interview with Lane Smith, author and illustrator of Madam President, and ""Meet Senator Edward M. Kennedy and Splash"" where young viewers get to see the senator and his loyal dog in live action rather than animation. A presidential timeline and simple discussion questions (very brief) are also included. The total running time of the four featured titles is approximately 73 minutes plus bonus features.

This high-interest title is a wonderful choice for some lighthearted relief in the midst of memorizing the names of all the presidents, in celebration of President's Day, as an adjunct to learning about the political process, or just for plain enjoyment! Now for an interesting admission - we're Canadians, but we love So You Want to Be President. Regardless of your nationality, exposing children to the ins and outs and major faces of American politics will serve them well. Best of all, my children love this disc and ask for it regularly.",1269907200,9,2773,5.35091743119266
