6389152,3,B00JR8240A,"Die-hard fans of vintage British science-fiction and horror will enjoy this low-budget yarn. There's a great cast including Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing (not seen enough, though) and Patrick Allen, the king of voiceovers who sadly died recently. It's all pretty silly, but entertaining. The director is the great Terence Fisher.",1164067200,3,330,5.62

6389158,5,B00JR8240A,"The Blu-ray price seemed a little high here, so I went to the Amazon UK site.  Even with shipping, I saved about $21.

I have an Oppo ""multi-region DVD / Blu-ruy player which plays this movie fine.

This is a great science fiction movie.  Like most British sci-fi, it is low on special effects, but good on a story and drama.

 If you think you have seen all science fiction there is to see, try this Blu-ray movie, you will probably like it.",1434499200,4,442,4.265060240963855
6389159,5,B00JR8240A,"In NIGHT OF THE BIG HEAT (ISLAND OF THE BURNING DAMNED), the small island of Fara has a problem. Somehow, while everywhere around it is experiencing the winter cold, Fara is in the middle of a heat wave! Visiting scientist, Godfrey Hanson (Christopher Lee)  suspects something other than a meteorological anomaly is behind the scorching temperatures. He believes that an alien invasion is under way. It seems that telephones and televisions are acting wonky as well, even exploding! Residents are also noticing a strange squealing sound. When mysterious deaths start occurring, Hanson's theory may be the only answer. Can he stop the onslaught before everyone is reduced to cinders? NOTBH is a sci-fi thriller from 1967. It has both Lee and Peter Cushing  -in a smaller role- as Dr. Vernon Stone. There's also a soap opera-like subplot about an author (Patrick Allen), his wife (Sarah Lawson), and his mistress (Jane Merrow). This adds a bit of spice to the story-line. Intriguing all the way through to the flaming finale, this film deserves to be far better known. Extra points for the cool, globular aliens! Highly recommended...",1425340800,14,1132,5.080645161290323
6389160,5,B00JR8240A,"This Odeon Blu-ray presentation is the best I've ever seen for this title!  While not perfect, as there is some print fading and other minor defects, this is 100 times more watchable than the bootlegs and TV prints floating around.  The story itself is full of holes but the performances are quite good and it holds your interest.

The extras include a trailer and a 20 minutes profile of Christopher Lee, taken from Odeon's British Legends Of Stage and Screen.  Get this disc as cheaply as you can, but as a genre fan, you'll want to own this one.

Oh, and it's also region free.",1415577600,9,580,4.485714285714286
6389161,3,B00JR8240A,"This reviews the newly available British Blu-ray. It is 1080i. What the advantage is to the distributor will require someone better versed in the technical aspects than me. It is also zone free, which my Pioneer player promptly ignored, making me run it on my Oppo which runs anything, probably including 8mm to 50 caliber. While this is not reference quality it is leaps and bounds better than this material has ever looked. What is frustrating is producer Gordon trying to re-make this film once too often and turning it into a sub-par Dr. Who episode. With Peter Cushing, who was a joy to watch by expertly pretending he wasn't being watched, and Jane Merrow, who gave this film it's title despite the screenplay and story line.",1407110400,6,731,4.7637795275590555

8653475,2,B00JR8240A,"All though there are some good actors in this movie, the plot is somewhat thin. the real problem is the director and the play of action. A bit stiff, an unreal feel about it, and not having the quality (story line/acting)that say a Hammer production would have. All in all it is not a truly terrible film, yet if you are thinking it will have the same quality that a hammer film would have, you will be disappointed. However if you like the poor B movies that Elvira Mistress of the dark plays then this movie will work for you.",1529193600,,528,4.29
8653476,5,B00JR8240A,"Were having a heatwave, a tropical heatwave.  The temperature is rising, it isn't surprisingwell, actually it is, because its the middle of winter everywhere except on the small island of Fara, just off the English coast.  While everyone else is dealing with snow, these islanders are sweltering in the heat.  To make matters worse, they are finding people and animals burnt to a crisp.  And then theres a high-pitched whirring noise that no one can identify.  But it appears to be connected to the dead animals and dead people.  Only one person on the island is willing to suggest that it might be caused byaliens.  Will everyone end up a crispy critter before they stumble upon a plan to stop the hidden menace?

What a fabulous find, I had no idea this movie existed.  I loved everything about it but for the abrupt end.  This definitely goes into my Christopher Lee & Peter Cushing horror collection.",1529020800,,904,4.737179487179487

8653478,3,B00JR8240A,"I bought this because I liked Island of Terror so much. The story is similar, and like Island of Terror, it stars Peter Cushing. Not only is he in it, but so is Christopher Lee. It's not as good as IOT though. The monsters don't show up until way later in the film, and they're not as impressive. It looks like it was shot on the cheap, since the cast is smaller, although actress Jane Merrow is great",1525910400,,401,4.153846153846154

8653480,5,B00JR8240A,"As a teen I saw this as ""Night of the Big Heat"" on a late night horror film, when TV had those. As a fan of Hammer Films this film is very similar being directed by Terence Fisher and having Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing as major characters, although the starring roles go to Patrick Allen and Jane Merrow. This is a very '60s, very British horror film and you are either a fan of these films or you're not. I am and enjoy the movie.",1522022400,,434,4.117647058823529

8653482,4,B00JR8240A,"This is a good quality classic B grade sci-fi movie from 1967.  Somehow I had never seen it before.  There is not a lot of action, and not a lot of budget, but the characters develop and the plot thickens to an eerie, yet somewhat dated climax.  The characters are quite colorful and a bit over the top.  The special effects are kept to a minimum, which holds some realism for a film on a tight budget. After watching I couldn't help but think of how deadly the lack of instant communication can be. This film is a good reminder of how cell phones have improved life on earth.",1515888000,2,576,4.256880733944954
8653483,4,B00JR8240A,More a sci-fi movie than a horror film to me. ( Spoiler )About an extreme heat wave caused by sun creatures from another planet.,1515801600,,128,4.375
8653484,5,B00JR8240A,"One of the best of the British sci-fi/horror films, this seldom celebrated gem from director Terence Fisher and the remarkable British filmmaking crew is well worth repeated viewings., It features typically impressive performances from Christopher Lee (as the stand-offish scientist determined to find out the cause of rising temperatures on the island) and Peter Cushing.(in a smaller role as the local doctor). Unlike the highly similar ""Island of Terror,"" its monsters/aliens are wisely kept in shadow for most of the movie and then revealed to be quite menacing indeed. In ""Terror,"" the creatures look like a cross between a tortoise and a carpet sweeper. Also known as ""Island of the Big Heat,"" this atmospheric thriller features fine performances all around and a believable romantic sub-plot about a seductress (Jane Merrow) who tempts a married man (Patrick Allen)' These scenes add extra heat and humanity to the story. The result is a fine movie that fits in perfectly with my favorite Hammer and Amicus thrillers. I hope it gives you equal pleasure.",1515542400,7,1060,5.204678362573099
