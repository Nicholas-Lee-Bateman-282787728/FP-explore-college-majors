8190564,1,6305885214,"If your looking for something that the cover suggests then don't purchase this dvd. No extras, the quality is not the best as it keeps stopping on the one I purchased. There is no point to watching this piece of garbage, if you like a movie with no dialog then this is the one for you. The cover does nothing for what is inside, what is suggested on the cover does not take place on playing. This should be avoided at all costs.",1037923200,23,428,4.168674698795181
