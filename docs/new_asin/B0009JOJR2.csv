8061994,5,B0009JOJR2,"My gosh, this tape was made 26 years ago, WAY before amazon.com existed.  For that reason alone it really is something worth seeing.

This 25 minute advertisement brings back so much nostalgia.  Some of the rides it features (like 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea) have been torn down and replaced, so whatever memories you can find of these particular rides you hang onto for dear life.

This video showed me that Disney World has a bunch of hotels.  Before I only knew of the one the monorail goes through, but there are quite a few others, including tree-house ones.  MAN it must cost a lot of money to stay in those things.

The only drawback to this video is it was made before other theme parks like MGM Studios, EPCOT Center, and Blizzard Beach were made.  Discovery Island and River Country are featured however.

The quality of the tape I own has diminished over the years unfortunately.  Heck, the thing is so old it's turned yellow inside.  I'm amazed it plays at all.

To conclude my review, if you love Disney World and the year 1980, man, this tape will make your day.",1158883200,2,1078,4.528497409326425
