7888078,3,6305337802,"This DVD was very informative about Charles Barkley life even prior to the NBA.  I guess I expected more clips of the NBA basketball games and especially when they won the championship.  If you are interested in learning about his life, when he began his basketball career in from high school to NBA, this is a good DVD.  If you are only interested in his NBA career and want to see some of the more exciting games, you need to get a different DVD.",1265328000,2,448,4.309523809523809
7888079,5,6305337802,This video shows the importance of a good coach to get the most out of a player. It also highlights the importance of having quality players around a good player. Sir Charles is honest in this video and that is refreshing.,1265328000,,222,4.439024390243903
7888080,5,6305337802,props always to Sir Charles. Charles Barkley was one of the Greatest Basketball players ever and off the court he always had a quote and spoke his mind and still does. He is great on TNT with Ernie Johnson and Kenny  the Jet Smith. Charles Barkley was a under-sized small forward but he played like a giant as this collection highlights. the Man is a Winner to me and he had Game.,1194739200,,380,4.277777777777778
7888081,3,6305337802,"This DVD is about 45 minutes long.  It shows highlights from Charles early days as a high schooler through to his college years and later onto his NBA days with the 76s and the Suns.  There are some great highlights and interviews with Charles and other NBA greats.  The majority of the DVD is taken up with the Suns battles with Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls.

The DVD falls short in length and content.  It misses Charles' days with the Rockets and his quest for a championship.",1124668800,5,487,4.488636363636363

7888083,5,6305337802,"This is a great bio of Charles Barkley, at his best and worst. I usually fast fwd to when he FINALLY CAME BACK TO THE VALLEY!. It has some great  highlights of that memorable year back in 93. DAMN THAT PAXSON! Anyway this  movie kicks ass, and shows CB at his best, not lugging up and down the  court for those Rockets. This was when Barkely could actually dunk, and  drive by helpess jabroni's.  CB = GREATEST PF in LEAGUE EVER! When he was  healthy he would kick Malone's behind all day long.
GO SUNS!  DAMN  BLAZERS JUST GOT DAVIS FOR O'NEAL.",967680000,2,545,4.2745098039215685
