6389163,4,B00JRB00RG,"After watching some really bad war films, you know, the ones with Eric Roberts in them, I was relieved to watch this film and perhaps over rated it by comparison.

The film opens up questioning our cause in Afghanistan, a person who wants to do something to change the world, and ends with a positive answer. After a Marine Sargent gets his leg shot off, Corporal Merrimette (Josh Kelly) is given a field promotion and has to take much needed supplies to a unit and cross through Taliban territory. He reluctantly accepts the position having a pregnant wife at home and no desire to re-enlist. In fact his commander (Stephen Lang) asked him if he had submitted his letter of resignation yet, which caught me off guard, because having been in the service, enlisted people did not submit letters of resignation, only officers.

They take a truck convey, because an air drop would have made the film too short and besides there is a dust storm that we never see. Along the way, they run into difficulty causing Merimette to make those ""world changing"" decisions.

The characters are introduced by name, rank, and place of origin. Character build up happens with the fun military banter, which normally concerns sex and me having to Google ""Queen Christina."" Seriously? The acting was fair, the plot needed tightening up. For instance, one time when they were on foot they killed some Taliban with vehicles, but opted to proceed on foot. Not the decision I would have made, but then again I was never a Hollywood Marine.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex. Early gratuitous male nudity.",1407628800,5,1579,4.794117647058823
6389164,5,B00JRB00RG,"In regards to the reviewer below, number one, MARPAT (Marine's uniform) & the Army ACU's have the same pattern, except that the color scheme is a little different. MARPAT, has a light desert greenish color, while the army ACU's have a green & gray color, it also has velcro & that sticks out like a baggy pocket for unit patches & tabs. You know nothing about the military's standard issued uniforms at all. And as you can see the picture with the three men were filtered in different quality which usually changes the color quite a bit. Photoshop logic.",1407196800,7,554,4.606060606060606
6389165,1,B00JRB00RG,"I don't usually write any reviews until I have seen a movie first and even when I do, I usually save reviews for something I extremely like or hate.  In this case the whole premise of this movie insults me.  The original Jarhead is based on the real life story of Anthony Swafford who wrote a very good memoir book by the same name of the movie.  The word Jarhead is a derogatory name for Marines which if you are not a Marine, you probably would get punched in the face if you called a  Marine a Jarhead to his face.  Keep in mind the 2 things I mentioned Swafford and Marines.  Swafford left the service after the first gulf war and didn't reenlist (as seen in the first movie) and the guys in the picture are wearing army uniforms and the description reads that this is taking place during Operation Enduring Freedom.  I find this insulting both as a fan of the original movie and a Marine.  Know that this movie must suck as they had to name it after a completely unrelated movie.  (Oh and let's not forget, none of the original cast is in this movie, which is is expected, since it has nothing to do with the original movie).",1399593600,52,1130,4.267605633802817

6389168,4,B00JRB00RG,"If you like your war movies plausible and realistic this is not the movie for you. Nothing in this movie is really plausible. There's all kinds of obvious things going on that just can't happen. However the action starts pretty early in the movie and it just doesn't stop. It's not especially plausible either but it's done well enough that I wasn't as offended as I might have been buy all the goofy goings-on. Ostensibly the movie tells the story of a squad of Supply Marines who somehow end up trying to save some woman who is going to save Afghanistan from itself. But really it's just a vehicle for a lot of shooting and explosions and it does that part of it pretty well if not especially plausible.

It is nowhere near as good as Jarhead but Jarhead is more of a thinking movie rather than just Mindless shooting and explosions.",1497398400,,835,4.493421052631579

6389312,1,B00JRB00RG,"Wow. Just wow.

First off, this movie has nothing to do with old Anthony's Novel, so don't try figuring out why they named it such.

As a veteran, this movie is quite literally offensive. It's the most unrealistic thing imaginable. Completely fictitious, and they made Afghanistan without a doubt, Victorville California.

Synopsis:

A (transportation?) Platoon armed with Browning 1919s, in which corporals answer directory to Majors, goes off to do something or another, and run into a very weak sauce section of SEALs. They shoot some people with missiles that come out of M203s, go on full out WW1 assualts sans weapons, shoot millions of Mujahideen, (who surprisingly not one is wearing a Pakal, you know the national hat of afghan. But instead shamaghs, like this is the middle east). And lead the most lethal coed rescue force imaginable, who out survive tier one operators, to rescue an afghan woman, who I'm pretty sure is latina, so that she may deliver some sort of speech to the president.

. . . .you know, since that's important and all.

Anywho, I'm drinking while typing this, but anyway, long story short, this is the movie:

Take contents out of garbage can in kitchen.

Place contents in microwave.

Place on ""high"" setting for 4 minutes.

Remove hot garbage.

Place in Jarhead 2 DVD case.

So there's that. The best part of the movie is when the convoy takes some 12.7 cal into the roof of the 5 ton from a ridge, and the Marines who are being shot start twerking.

Hot garbage, people. Watch it, but watch it for drunkened giggles.

On top of that the dialogue was horrible, all the immature (and not funny) sexual jokes made me feel like I was listening to a bunch of 12 year old boys.

6389341,3,B00JRB00RG,"If I rate it ""OK"", I guess the next question is, ""Compared to What?""  If you are expecting a good documentary about the Marines in Afghanistan, as other reviewers have pointed out this would not be it.  Compared to Jarhead?  I KNOW I watched Jarhead--yet I don't remember A THING about it, so I can't make that comparison either.  As this film notes, at the time it was released we've been fighting (to various degrees) in Afghanistan for THIRTEEN YEARS now, and the original Jarhead came out in 2006, so 8 years later I think at least 2 way better stories drove that one completely out of my memory: ""No Easy Day"", and ""Sole Survivor"".  This film can't even claim that it's ""based on"" a true event--the plot is fictional, although I think at least some of the feel of being a US soldier in Afghanistan may come through.  Some things are also just dumb, like reference to being ""way out of the Green Zone""--uh yeah--like that was a different COUNTRY?  And others are really trite, like ""It's awfully quiet.  I don't like it.""

Stuff that struck me as at least partially realistic: suspicions about the Afghan military ""partners"" by US troops; the usual vulgarities exchanged by grunts talking to each other; the heat [actually nothing on film would really portray the heat, but there's some attempt]; the dry, dusty and rocky terrain, and the uncertainty of traveling by road outside Kabul.  And the strain it puts on families when troops repeatedly deploy, and that not everyone does want to re-deploy, and the questions Marines must sometimes ask themselves about whether, in the end, this long struggle will change very much about Afghanistan whenever it ends.  And that for those who have fought in a war..any war...it never really ends.  It lives on in their memories, along with the memories of close friends who didn't return, for the rest of their lives, whether they make a career out of military service or only serve the minimum and return home.

In the end there never is A STORY about a war.  There are as many stories as there are lives touched by it, at the very least.  If I rate this as ""OK"" I guess it's because I've seen far better war films....but then, I've also seen worse.",1418083200,3,2195,4.635658914728682

If I can save one poor unsuspecting person from watching this who, like me, might make the mistake of thinking this movie is anything like the first Jarhead, then my time will have been well spent. The only thing that resembles the first movie is the name. One might think the lack of budget, poor acting or cliched characters would have bothered me the most but it was the little things that killed me. For example, after a couple days of fighting behind Taliban enemy lines,
crawling through the desert and Afghan country side, being thrown by explosions,
having fellow Marines blasted to pieces within feet of them, etc, etc. The final scene shows some of the main characters walking - their crisp fatigues, radios and rifles clean like they just came out of, well, a prop closet. Horrible, awful, terribleness.",1411171200,19,922,4.697530864197531

They went so far away from the point of the first Jarhead, it's a slap in the face to the United States Marine Corps to be honest. This movie needs to be banned from public sales and viewings in general. Anyone who made a paycheck from this movie needs to immediately donate that money to a recognized military charity.

It's not the worst military movie ever or even the worst war movie I've ever seen; but, it is nothing you want to see.

Willing suspension of disbelief is something any work of fiction needs to accomplish; however, this movie failed miserably at that task. Every time I tried to get into the movie or suspend my disbelief--which is not how it's supposed to work--the movie did something else to jar me into saying: ""WTF!!"" The uniforms were so wrong in so many ways it's embarrassing. The banter was dopey, the premise beyond unbelievable, the tactics stupid, and the acting and dialog were so hammy the movie should have come with mustard and a side of coleslaw.",1410307200,3,853,4.291925465838509

6389383,2,B00JRB00RG,"I just finished ""Jarhead"" recently and am currently watching ""The Pacific"" series. Both are good enough to watch and not really a waste of entertainment time, but not great. Blackhawk Down is very good I think...I read all of your reviews for this movie and it made me think I did not want to watch this, but I am going to watch it anyway and I will post my updates here...I'm not a Marine nor was I ever in the US Armed forces, but I think I might have similar criticisms of Jarhead and other movies; they were still enjoyable to watch though. For the life of me, I do not understand the battle field tactics they have shown in The Pacific, especially the beach scenes. You might as well just walk in to a hail of bullets with no gun from what I am seeing there...so maybe your criticisms on reality are good ones.

UPDATE: Finished Watching Movie
I will not go into everything about this movie...and I think the previous reviews colored my thinking to look for some things in the movie. Overall, I enjoyed the action in the movie...but I thought the premise was very very dumb. Do we really let our marines die to get a human rights activist to a speech? To gain positive outcomes for POTUS himself and fore his party? I was a little disgusted by that...seemingly *NOT* a very worthy cause.

The first action setting...in the 360-deg theater where they stop and are surrounded with one 50 cal to survey 360 degree of 200' ledges is inane. I would hope that no mission commander would ever stop ina setting like that for a potential bomb threat...and WAIT TWO HOURS!!! Back outta there and wait it out or re-prioritize. Talk about a ""bird in the oven"". Very reminiscent of Clear and Present Danger when the convoy pulls into the alley and is assaulted by RPGs....only they were politicians...they don't know better.

The ""camp"" dialogue between the gal marine and the guys could have been left out.

Overall, the marines in this movie at times looked to have no training or were possibly asleep during the 13 week stint at PI or MCRD. Questionable decisions.

Ok, so that was a lot of over analysis, I admit that...but for those wanting realistic combat, it is probably not here imho. And, it denigrates the movie and the publics view of marines (not mine) due to the poor decision making and gratuitous mission they are on....would we really do this type of thing?

I want to thank all of our marines for serving our country and all the other armed forces...I understand this movie does not depict your abilities and services. It is very obviously made solely for entertainment.

I think 2 or 2.5 /5 is reasonable since it is still a marginally entertaining escape from work, honeydoos, etc.",1410048000,3,2693,4.574688796680498
6389384,5,B00JRB00RG,"I think this sequel is better than the first. It is extremely accurate in its coverage of what our troops are being ""attacked"" by while on overseas deployment. The film is set in Afghanistan, but could be anywhere our troops are engaged.

I didn't get the truck they had either, as it looked like some old National Guard job they'd be towing around the range for target practice. I know the some guy's were upset about this depiction of their beloved Marine Corps, but what do you expect it's made in Hollywood. A favorite part was when that Arabian Princess was screaming for help when the insurgents were going to whack her.

Even though he isn't sure how much longer he will stay enlisted he picks his unit and they head out on a mission to resupply an outpost through Taliban controlled territory. Along the way they come upon what is left of a SEAL team and an Afghan woman whom they were extracting. When things go from bad to worse the mission becomes protecting this woman for reasons unknown to the marines. Like many of you when I saw Jarhead 2 my first thought was, oh no, not another direct to video sequel. There have been a ton of these and none have been good. Behind Enemy Lines is on their 4th one, Death Race has 3, Joy Ride has 3...the list goes on and on. Sitting down to watch this I had very low expectations. I don't often get surprised by movies but this one did. I was really shocked at how good this one was and I really enjoyed it. On the other hand though this is nothing like the original at all. The original dealt with the mental aspect of going through training and heading to a place they don't want to be and having nothing to do. This one is more of a straight action/war movie, and this was actually one of the better war movies that have come out recently. Overall, a movie that was much better then I was expecting and I ended up really liking it. I surprisingly give this a B+.",1408233600,2,1366,4.237547892720307

(2) in this beautiful land teeming with thugs roaming around on technicals our marines in broad daylight walk into the fort of the enemy as if it were the champs elysee. seriously? ok, it's prayertime, but still. it's never that prayertime in a war zone. (3) an absolute disgusting blunder, after a female marine heroically fights through the whole movie and is one of the 2 surviving soldiers, the narrator says something like, we are marines. we are professional fighting MAN. and during the narration, you see them, among them the female marine, walk away disappearing in the sun. was perhaps supposed to be poetic or dramatic but instead turns out to be absolutely disgraceful. i don't know, have they changed the whole production crew halfway through the movie, or what? really disappointing the way this movie de-developed, regressed, or i don't know what, really very very disappointing",1532563200,,1270,4.967136150234742
