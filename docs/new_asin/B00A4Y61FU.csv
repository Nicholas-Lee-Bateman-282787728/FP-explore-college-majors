8546761,5,B00A4Y61FU,"I have been collecting these DVDs for some time. I kinda wish they were a box set, but such is life. Anyway, these are some of the first episodes of Season Two. There are some pretty funny moments, such as when Jon thinks he's allergic to Garfield, Garfield gives a little payback to Jon and his brother Doc Boy after they pull a trick on him, and so forth. I was a bit skeptical about this show at first, because I was brought up with Garfield and Friends. But I got used to it. Anyone can watch these shows and take something away from them, a bit of humor, a lesson, and general entertainment. I recommend these to any Garfield and/or Odie fan.",1367366400,,647,4.2682926829268295
8546762,5,B00A4Y61FU,"I just finished watching this disc today, and, let me tell you, it blew me away! The CGI animation, paired with the writing, is absolutely superb! The only thing I'm not too sure about is Frank Welker's attempt to re-create the late, great Lorenzo Music's Garfield voice, but, that's a given - other than that, this DVD ROCKS!",1365552000,,326,4.637931034482759
8546763,4,B00A4Y61FU,"I have never seen the Garfield Show but I grew up reading the comic strip so I was curious as to how the characters would translate to a show. This DVD includes six episodes that have a spring theme and originally aired on The Cartoon Network.

The characters looked exactly as I'd pictured and the graphics are amazing and exceeded my expectations! The one thing I felt like didn't line up was Garfield's voice. I'm not sure exactly what I was expecting but when he opened his mouth to speak for the first time, the sound was not at all what I had anticipated. I got used to it after a few episodes and it grew on me so now that's what I'll expect his voice to sound like.

My kids and I watched this together and my kids were immediately laughing at Garfield and his antics. My daughter loved Odie because she is obsessed with dogs so he quickly became her favorite character. I actually related to Jon and his frustration with his animals because I experience a lot of the same things with my kids! Being a mother and a pet owner are not so different. There are constant situations and silliness that arise.

We all really enjoyed the Garfield Spring Fun Collection Show and appreciated having something new and fresh to watch unlike any other shows out there. I love that this beloved comic strip has been brought to life!",1361404800,,1326,4.448559670781893
8546764,5,B00A4Y61FU,"I know that thing is the Garfield comic strips, so you can probably guess that I was quite excited about seeing that there is a Garfield cartoon show  that I had never seen in the past. Are you watching this DVD I have to say that I was impressed with the overall nature of the DVD itself. The writing for the DVD was quite humorous and the artistry itself was also quite impressive. Just like in the comic strips in this DVD you will see Garfield and Odie getting into a number of crazy situations shall make you laugh out loud. If you are already a Garfield fan this is a serious it definitely should check out. If you are a pet lover and enjoy humor and never heard of Garfield, and only now can you see him in the Sunday paper, but you can also see him in a great DVD set!
