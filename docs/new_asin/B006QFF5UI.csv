8503009,3,B006QFF5UI,"For learning pole dancing this video leaves much to be desired.  It is very short and only demonstrates 3-4 pole tricks.

Pros: The warm up is great.  It's hard, but fun.  The few pole tricks she demonstrates are explained well.

Cons: During the warm up she is wearing flowy pants, so you can't see if she is standing on her toes or not.  Plus I agree with other comments... she doesn't speak so you never know if she has gone onto the next move. Not enough dancing, and def not enough pole tricks.  Way too short for the price.

Overall, I wouldn't recommend this video.  I have only used it a handful of times and when I did it was only for the warm-up",1430697600,,655,4.217741935483871
8503010,1,B006QFF5UI,"I had pole dance classes before, and i consider my self a Intermediate level 1. I moved and there is no pole studio close to me now, so i wanted to keep working on my skills. First of all im disappointed in this because I would almost consider this a beginner, not really but especially the first couple moves, there is 1 floor to pole move and then the second thing on this dvd is how to climb...I'm sorry, I learned that in my first class!!
Then it gets a lil more difficult, but nothing new, she does not explain good at all!!, she doesnt say what your points of contact are and doesnt explain at all what not to do, that way u can get really hurt. Besides she her armpit is covered on the leg hangs... which is a point of contact, which is fine for a pro like her, but not for someone who is just learning all this...
Then the best thing is: one of the moves is the butterfly. then two moves later the side split on the pole... she is literally saying ""get in the EXTENDED butterfly"", which she didn't teach, to get in this move. The extra is wothless as she does alot of moves she doesnt explain in the dvd. The only good thing i can say about is, that the warm up is pretty long and warms up your whole body...but thats not why i bought this dvd.
So please just use youtube, theres tons of tutorials, which are way better then this.",1426809600,5,1338,4.1106870229007635

I love love pole dance!
Thanks Felix",1401148800,,127,4.565217391304348
8503014,4,B006QFF5UI,I like the video. The warmup is basically a workout all in itself. I do not like that the dvd description does not include what kind of moves you will learn. I go to apole studip near my house and at this studio I am considered a beginner. So when I purchased the intermediate I expected a lot of the moves to be ones I don't know or at least would take me a long time to master. Out of all the moves I think there are only 2-3 that I have never done before. I would have ordered the Advanced if I would have known this.,1385942400,2,520,3.869158878504673
8503015,5,B006QFF5UI,"excellent! easy to follow, very professional fits perfect if you have an intermediate level, you work every single muscle in your body!",1382745600,,135,5.181818181818182
8503016,5,B006QFF5UI,Amazing video. Some tricks are hard but I am still working on them. she breaks down over 20 tricks 2 or 3x the video goes fast but it shows all the moves in slow motion. I have purchased disc 2 and 5. the other dics i assume are tooo hard,1365033600,,238,3.78
8503017,5,B006QFF5UI,"The Intermediate DVD includes a warm-up that is somewhere around 20-ish minutes long.  Just the warm-up is kind of intense at times.  It does the job for sure.  Felix uses a bunch of dynamic stretches (e.g. hip swivels, body rolls).  There's some pretty heavy ab work.  I can't keep up with Felix on the ab stuff, but I do what I can. Something that is unique is that Felix doesn't talk during the warm-up.  However, it is still easy to follow. I see the no talking thing as a plus, because you have the option of muting the DVD and playing your own music without missing anything. As far as the actual moves, I think I picked an appropriate level DVD to offer me a challenge.  It starts with a couple spins, then progresses to head stand, hand stand, basic invert, and other inverted moves. Everything is divided into chapters on the DVD menu, so you can skip around easily if you want.  There's also a little ""extras"" section.  During the moves, Felix talks you through everything step by step and then shows you how to do the move about three times.  She shows you things to avoid and tips to make the moves more stylized.",1330560000,5,1125,4.41747572815534
