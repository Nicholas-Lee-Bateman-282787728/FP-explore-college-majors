5848386,1,B00DR4XE4U,Buyer BEWARE!!!! These dvd's do not play in DVD players for Americans.,1462665600,12,70,4.916666666666667
5848387,4,B00DR4XE4U,"Danielle Steel movies are like fine American cheese.  You don't want to admit how much you like it, but it's just so delicious!  Unfortunately, I could not get these to work in my player even though it was a multi regional player and should have played them.  Doesn't change the fact that this is a great collection, and if you are successful at getting them to play, you are a video goddess.  The retailer was very easy to deal with and accepted the return, I opted for an Amazon credit since half my paychecks seem to be spent here anyway, and as soon as the package was scanned at the UPS store, the credit was in my account.  I would not hesitate to do business with them again.  Thank You!",1459814400,5,694,4.3
