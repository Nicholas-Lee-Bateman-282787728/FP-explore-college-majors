2258062,5,B0008ENIG6,"This is a collection of the 1st 5 pride events. If your in anyway interested in mma you should atleast give this set a loook,since it conatins fights from a great number of legends of mma  eg:kimo,dansevern,mark kerr,igor vovachyn,sakuraba etc. I won't fool you there are some corny fights in there and some BORING ones case in point the most boring mma fight I have EVER seen kimo vs Dan severn the japanese fighters except shoji and Sakuraba put on the worst display of mma fighting.. they jus laid there trying 2 get a draw against whoever they fought. Hugo  Duarte well this guy is a nut and jus stalled Mark Kerr into a mostly boring and bizarre fight in pride 4 what a wonder he never won ANYTHING in pride .
But umm the video seems to be dub commentated by bas rutten and that other guy it's kinda obvious when u hear rutten talkin...and the see him at the same time in kerr's corner while he's calling the fight",1143158400,2,919,4.368421052631579
2258063,5,B0008ENIG6,"That is not the only reason to get the set, but while there are many on Rickson's bandwagon with his 400+ ""wins,"" he still shows us all that he is very scary on the ground.  Poor Takada never had a chance.

This set should have been called ""The Kazushi Sakuraba Legacy"" because it is in PRIDE's 2 - 5 that he begins his path to legendary status.  He outgrapples Carlos Newton in an amazing display by both fighters and his pure, complete and total destruction of Vitor Belfort is awsome and has you laughing while you watch Vitor ""escaping"" to the ground.

There are many great fights here, and Sakuraba is not the only contributor to the events.  Let's not forget Carlos Newton, Gary Goodridge, Shoji, Vernon White, Igor Vov, Mark Kerr and Otsaka.

Great set that is a must have.  I wish the UFC would do the same thing and I also hope that pride keeps releasing these non-stop so we can eventually own them all for a resonable price.",1126828800,4,935,4.432748538011696
2258064,3,B0008ENIG6,"Having watched a lot of MMA events, I though it would be neat to watch the early fights of Pride.  There are some good matches spread across the five discs, however there are some extremely boring fights in this collection.  The early events were 'win or draw' outcomes, with no scoring by judges, so managing to survive 3-5 ten minute rounds was enough to earn a draw. There are some real mismatches (e.g. middle weights against 600+ pounders) and some very technical matches that will only interest the hardcore fan.  Overall, its worth the price, if only to hear Bas Rutten and Stephen Quadros complaining about some of the bouts (commentators have gotten better over the years). Buy it, but don't be afraid to fast forward through some of the fights.",1125705600,6,754,4.740458015267175

2258067,4,B0008ENIG6,"For the price this set is a great deal!  I am an avid martial artist and love to watch MMA, and this set has some great fights.  Sakuraba vs Newton is one of the most technical I have ever seen.  If you want alot for the money you spend buy this set.  It does not have alot of the fireworks and introductions that are now common of PFC now, and the fight announcers have become better over the years, but most of the fights are worth it.  Be warned, as good as most of the fights are some of the fights are very slow Kemo vs Sevran is a waste of time.  This set also has the introductions of some the first time fights from MMA superstars like my personnal favorite Sakuraba.  The Gracie family has a very strong showing in this set, and there is a great demonstration included on one of the disks.",1121731200,,798,4.109677419354838
2258068,5,B0008ENIG6,"'Pride:  Legacy' is a five disc set chronicling the first five Pride Fighting Championship events.  Each event runs from two to three hours long, so for the low price of this set there's no reason you shouldn't already own it.

Pride FC at its beginning is a bit different from the Pride we know today.  During the first four events, each match has at least 3 ten-minute rounds, no restarts, and no judges.  By Pride 5, there were just 2 ten-minute rounds per match and they had instituted restarts and a judging system.  Due to these original rules, there are some occasionally slow matches.  But even so, there are some absolute gems here in this set.

Pride, from its inception, stocked their cards with some of the best fighters of the day.  I'd say in 90% of the matches, you will know at least one of the fighters.  Some of them included here are:  Mark Kerr, Carlos Newton, Mark Coleman, Gary Goodridge, just about the entire Gracie family, Vernon White, Igor Vovchancyn, Vitor Belfort, and a lot more.

But the best thing about this set is that you get a good introduction to some fantastic Japanese fighters.  Namely Kazushi Sakuraba, probably one of the best(or the single best, in my opinion)and most exciting MMA fighters of all time.  You also get to see the early matches of both Akira Shoji and Daijiro Matsui, and you'll quickly see why they are such crowd favorites.

Definitely the best matches in the first 5 Pride events are the Sakuraba fights.  He takes on Carlos Newton in an amazingly technical match, has another classic against Vernon White, and he absolutely dismantles Vitor Belfort.  He fights on 4 of the 5 cards and all of his fights are amazing.  The other major gem here is the Shoji/Matsui match-up.  I don't think there are any MMA fighters alive that have more energy and heart than these two guys and they put on an awesome show.

All in all, 'Pride:  Legacy' is absolutely worth its meager price tag.  Actually, I would've paid twice as much for it.  As I said, a few matches due to the old Pride rules get a bit boring, but for the most part all of the events have great matches.  If you are a MMA fan, then this is a must-have.  Or if you are just getting started, this is a great introduction.",1117843200,18,2234,4.511221945137157
2258089,5,B0008ENIG6,"It's Pride. If you are an MMA fan, you'll like Pride. All of the Pride Fighting Legacy series is great and I would recommend it to any fight fan.",1265155200,,145,4.0344827586206895
2258090,3,B0008ENIG6,"The first half dozen Pride events are basically one step above the original UFC's... Very far from what MMA is today. Slow action, questionable athletes, freakshow matchups, archaic rules, etc. Simply from a historical perspective these events are interesting, but don't expect to be blown away, or even entertained by most of the fights.

They are old and that is to be expected, so I gave them 3 stars, but if you're looking for some entertaining fights, these DVD's are more like 1 or 2 stars.",1220486400,,496,4.767441860465116
2258091,4,B0008ENIG6,"If you like mixed martial arts you will like these box sets. Even if you don't like half of the fights, for the money you're paying for these sets its still worth it.

Why wouldn't you want to see Anderson Silva in his pre-UFC days? Rampage Jackson vs. Kevin Randleman? Come on, who wouldn't want to see that fight? Don't forget about Dan Henderson, Mirko Cro Cop, and Heath Herring, just to name a few of the fighters featured in this set. And you get to see Fedor fight the current UFC Heavyweight champ Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira (Pride 25). That's probably worth the $25 bucks, alone.

Pride FC is no more. Unfortunately, its unique rules went with it. These disks are the last remnant of knees, soccer kicks, and stomps to the head of a downed opponent in MMA. The ring isn't as good as the cage for MMA, and not being able to elbow your opponent in the face sometimes makes for slow ground matches, but for the most part its refreshing to see MMA fights with slightly different rules than the current universally adopted UFC rules.

These collections might be a little too much for the casual MMA fan, but if you want to research current fighters, learn more about MMA, or simply want to see a lot of good fights, buy these disks.",1217289600,,1234,4.451327433628318

As expected of Pride a lot of great action along with a few explosive knockouts, such as Randleman/Jackson. A few vets show their wear & tear. Most notably Mark Kerr. His physique has really changed, and for the worst. Cro Cop is quite a force. All in all a great set to compliment your Pride DVD collection.",1205625600,23,2046,5.338509316770186

2258096,3,B0008ENIG6,"The early years of Pride were an odd contrast to the no-holds barred, bar room brawling nature of the early UFCs. The upstart Japanese orginization was able to attract alot of the sport's early legends, but mismatches were frequent. Unlike those Early UFC events which still hold much entertianment value as a result of their brutal and primitive nature, many of these matches were between skilled fighters who had yet to fully develop: as a result some matches ended up being stalemates in which both fighters had too much respect for one another and lacked the experience to mount a meaningful offense. A particuarly bad example of this is the match between Dan Sevren and Kimo, which was so attrociously boring that the ever respectful Japanese crowd began booing, something I have yet to see since.

Yet in alongside of these lackluster fights are many classics. Perhaps no two fighters shone as bright in early Pride as Mark Kerr and Kazushi Sakuraba. Kerr is now remembered as a cautionary tale of the sport; an incredibly promising fighter who fell victim to personal insecurities and an addiction to pain killers. None of those problems are apparent in his fights here, as he displays the dominance that earned him the nickname ""The Smashing Machine"" to, at times, an almost disturbing degree. On the flipside of Kerr's brutal style is Sakuraba, who later became a legend by defeating four Gracies including Royce. He was just starting his career but already showed the tremendous amount of skill and showmanship that would win him the hearts of fans all over the world. His bout with Carlos Newton is a wonder to watch and stands as one of the most entertianing and impressive displays of grappling in MMA history.

The collection isn't just about Kerr and Sakuraba though. Fighters like Rickson Gracie and Igor Vovchanchyn have impressive displays here, as well as other impressive matches. While it isn't as strong as later Pride events, it remains a must see for true MMA fans.",1162512000,7,1989,4.899109792284866
2258097,2,B0008ENIG6,"I have to admit that it took me a long time to become a Pride FC fan. When I heard of another MMA event outside of the UFC I was very excited... until I actually watched. These early Pride events are in almost every way boring to an extreme seldom seen outside of soccer. There are a couple (literally a couple) of good fights on this collection, but overall this really isn't worth the time or money unless you are a hardcore collector looking for a piece of MMA history. Pride really has come a very long way. If you are used to seeing current Pride events and have not been exposed to these first events, you will more than likely have little to no interest in this collection. Save your time and money for the later Pride events.",1154476800,,733,4.280575539568345
2258098,4,B0008ENIG6,"This DVD set covers the first 5 Pride events. Pride Fighting hit the mainstream several years after the UFC had already begun spurring interest in the sport of mixed martial arts, so Pride Fighting received immediate recognition, especially in Japan, where the events are held.

Many veterans of the UFC make appearances at these events and on this collection. We get to witness a fight between Kimo and Dan ""The Beast"" Severn, Gary ""Big Daddy"" Goodridge, the Gracie brothers (especially Rickson), Marco Ruas, Carlos Newton, Sakuraba, etc... Mark ""The Specimen"" Kerr debuts in Pride 2 and makes quite a splash in the sport. Vitor Belfort also takes on Sakuraba in Pride 5. This comes after Belfort is beaten in the UFC by Randy Couture, so it would appear he would be fighting with vengeance, yet Sakuraba picks him apart. Belfort appears to all but give up during the fight. He breaks down in an embarassing performance. Mark Coleman also debuts in Pride 5. He, too, was coming off of some losses in the UFC. He is stopped with a submission in a shocking loss to Takada.

Pride Fighting, especially in its early years, does not seem to be quite as exciting or quite as large a production as the UFC, but there is a lot of fighting history to be witnessed on these DVDs. Pride Fighting is going strong today and this collection marks its' genesis. I recommend it to any fan of MMA. There is also commentary by Pancrase legend Bas Rutton, which is an added bonus.

8055760,4,B0008ENIG6,"PRIDE FIGHTING LEGACY VOLUME 5 is a five-disc DVD set from the ""early years"" of the promotion. It contains no less than five Pride cards which were held between the years 2002 - 2004, when the ""second generation"" of MMA fighters (guys like Don Frye, Kevin Randleman, Guy Mezger, Mark Kerr, Carlos Newton and Mark Coleman) were giving way to the third (Fedor Emilianenko, Alistair Overeem, Mirko Cro Cop, Dan Henderson, the Nogiuera brothers,  Anderson Silva, etc.) It also was the midpoint of Wandelei Silva's reign of terror over the world's middleweights.  If you want to see the Pride organization when it had a lock on most of the world's best fighters, you could do worse than buying this set.

I've reviewed all these cards individually, but here's a superfast breakdown of what you get:

PRIDE 24: COLD FURY (189 min). Includes fights with the Noguiera brothers, the Overeem brothers, and Dan Henderson. Too many dull fights on this show. Three stars.

PRIDE 25: BODY BLOW (196 min). Includes Fedor Emilianenko, Rampage Jackson, Kazushi Sakuraba, Dan Henderson, Anderson Silva, and the Nogueria brothers. A very good card, borderline great, loaded with mega-talent. Four stars.

PRIDE 26: BAD TO THE BONE (170 min). Includes Fedor, Cro Cop, Mark Coleman, Don Frye, Rampage Jackson, Alistair Overeem and Anderson Silva. A terrific card packed with legendary fighters at the top of their games. Five stars.

PRIDE 27: INFERNO (184 min). Includes Cro Cop, Heath Herring, Sergei Kharitonov, Igor Volvchanchyn, Ninja Rua. An okay card with a lot of freak occurrances and injuries. Three stars.

PRIDE 28: HIGH OCTANE (205 min). Includes Wandelai Silva, Rampage Jackson, Cro Cop, Josh Barnett, Aleksander Emilianenko, Alistair Overeem, Ricardo Arona, Dan Henderson and Heath Herring. Two more freak injuries prevent this from being a classic, but it's still very, very good. Four stars.

All the discs come with varying special features, sometimes including extra bouts or featurettes. The commentary, often extremely funny, is done by Bas Rutten and either Stephen Quadros or Mauro Renallo.

PS - HOW TO AVOID SPOILERS:

The cards on this volume are chronological but not contiguous; for example, between Pride 27 and Pride 28 the promotion held no less than seven other events in the Grand Prix, Bushido and Shockwave series. So, if you put 28 in right after watching 27, the commentators may reveal the outcomes of various fights from these other shows and spoil them for you. Note as well that if you don't like spoilers, just press ""Play"" when the menu comes up after you load a disc. If you go to ""Select A Fight"" you'll soon notice that all the winners are listed on one side of the screen and all the losers on the other.",1322956800,,2730,4.964912280701754

While I can't possibly say I wasn't satisfied with a very good history lesson, I am a hardcore fan and can stand some of the slower matches. For those looking for a lot of stand-up brawls: while this set has a few (Branko Cikatic vs. Ralph White is an obvious one), it's mostly grappling. That said, the first two Sakuraba fights (against UFC vets Vernon White and Carlos Newton) are probably my two favorite fights as a grappling fan. The set is about half amazing and half praying for the end (I'm looking at you, Dan Severn vs. Kimo!).
