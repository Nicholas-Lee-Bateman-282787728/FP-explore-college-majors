The audio mix is great, the video is captivating, and the band is just fantastic (that is REALLY what I think)... oh by the way, it comes with both DVD and CD versions.  It is a full-length concert performance culled from two nights at the same venue, but it sounds like one night.  The audio is seamless and feels like one show.

I thrilled, I laughed, I cried, and I despaired:  this particular lineup toured itself to death and self-destructed some months later.  So don't fall in love.  But you probably will.  Even Snowy Shaw felt moved to remark onstage ""probably the best lineup ever!""  Watching this troupe drove me mad with love and sick with envy.

For you picky video nuts out there:  This is standard definition of course (it's a regular DVD) and the video is not as pristine-looking as higher-budget productions, but that's only noticeable because of the high-definition TVs most of us are watching these days.  The camera work and editing are actually about as good as most concert films, and my only real complaint would be that like most movies these days they cut video too frequently (to the novice reader:  don't worry, the audio is fully intact and seamless and wonderful), which has been the style for most action films and concert films throughout the 2000's.  [Whether it's a war movie, a Star Wars film or Iron Maiden concert video, it's constantly cut, cut, cut, never letting you really watch anything.  Where is Stanley Kubrick when we need him?  Oh, right.  He's dead.  But I digress.]

So... yeah, to say anything negative about this release, I had to criticize the pacing of the video editing!  That should tell you how great the concert is.  And I still couldn't take my eyes off the screen.  But as much fun as it is to watch, I recommend you listen to it at least once without video, to hear what you missed while boggling at the stage production.

Live performance doesn't get any better than this.",1493596800,,2030,4.608938547486034
