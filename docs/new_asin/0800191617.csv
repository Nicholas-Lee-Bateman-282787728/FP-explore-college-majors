168586,5,0800191617,"I have only seen it twice in New York at SONY IMAX and I wished I could have it in 3D on DVD ... but I guess I will still have to wait for that.
Although a tv-screen can't display all the great - and I mean: GREAT - impressions that you can get from the IMAX screen I guess with a good sound-system at home you can at least experience the greatness of the movie that so much reflects the image of New York.
Along with the 3-D stills it's more than today's New York sight-seeing but also a splendid look into the past, when the city was still growing.
So please dear producers: make it available on DVD in 3D as well as 2D.",1021680000,19,622,3.9444444444444446
168587,5,0800191617,"This was a wonderful introduction to IMAX films, and the first film I saw on my first visit to New York (and the USA) in 1999. I could empathise so easily with the boy as he saw so many new and wonderful aspects of the city, and it also gave a sense of the history of European immigrants to the New World in byegone days. I visited many of the sites shown in the film during the following two weeks, which the film had helped me to recognise in advance. The film itself was awesome in its scale and the sound track was first class. However, I sincerely doubt that this is material for the small screen, for the very reasons I have given previously, although I recommend it heartily as a theatre experience.",999820800,8,706,4.276119402985074
168588,3,0800191617,"I saw the movie today. It is OK in the regular format, didn't see it in IMAX. I thought the soundtrack was the best thing I have heard in years. It was so mood setting I have those songs going through my head all the time.  I don't know which was done first, the movie or the soundtrack, but the two  don't seem to fit together as one. The moods of the two don't interact with  one another. The movie is only 51 minutes long. The concept is cute, and  i'm sure they saved a ton of money on payroll with no recognizable names in  this one. But it was an interesting view of New York through the eyes of a  young boy.",945129600,5,615,3.959349593495935
168589,5,0800191617,"For starters, the movie is meant to be an IMAX 3D movie. Although it is great without the 3D, it is MUCH better in 3D.

168590,5,0800191617,"October 2013 Update:

I was just looking through IMAX blu-ray and IMAX 3D blu-rays on Amazon.  Most of them are lucky to get 3 stars due to bad narration, or bad looking transfer, or bad editing, or bad directing, etc...  So why is it that this one 5 Star 3D IMAX Film has never even been on DVD???  THIS IS ONE OF THE ALL TIME BEST IMAX FILMS EVER MADE!!!  It deserves the 3D blu-ray treatment for sure.

Original Review:

Not only astounded by the realism of the 3D in the IMAX Theaters I've seen this remarkable film in (yes, more than once). But the story is just overwhelmingly heart grabbing. It throws you into the world of a boy who is making a journey that most people only dream of.

The 3D quality is nothing like that seen in the cheesy films in the past. The 3D in an IMAX film- Especially Across The Sea Of Time - is almost exactly like being on a Holodeck!!! I am not exaggerating. The new technology is almost perfect. The only thing left, is to make electronic goggles so lightweight and large that you don't know they are on your head. (2012 Update: Good Digital Projectors have made accurate projection possible with inexpensive 3D glasses.)

I loved this movie. The story is so strong, that I'm sure it would also be enjoyable on HDTV in 3D. But if you EVER have a chance to see it in an IMAX Theater. DO NOT MISS THE CHANCE! It was THE BEST thing I did on my first trip to New York! And that's really saying a lot. It had to compete with The Statue of Liberty, The Empire State Building, and Rita Ford's Large Antique Music Box Store - which I had been looking forward to seeing for over 20 years!

You won't be disappointed.",921542400,6,1646,4.263665594855305

7792924,5,0800191617,"Well, almost all 3D TV owners at least, as many don't know this as they have not seen this great movie the way it was intended to. That is NOT by watching a VHS tape in flat format! Even watching it this way it will be a nice movie, but it is unbelievable that we still can't buy it on 3D blu-ray yet.
Strange, as Sony takes the risk of making the HMZT series of Head Mounted Displays which is a niche market, only for 3D addicts like me due to discomfort as they are heavy (but what a great view!).
On the other hand it is Sony that made this 3D Imax movie, and they seem to refuse to issue it on 3D blu-ray.
On top of that a Sony official declared 3D TV sort of dead about a year ago.
Is it a wonder 3D is not the sales success the industry has hoped for? Many of the best 3D movies we still can't buy on 3D blu-ray and some just recently. Lets hope this situation will change soon and more people will enjoy this movie the way I did at the first London Imax Theatre, at that time at Trocadero.

7792925,5,0800191617,"Although I have never seen this movie on video, I clearly remember being ""wowed"" by it years ago upon seeing it on the IMax screen (in 3D) at Navy Pier in Chicago where I lived for many years. The film was a very well-produced short movie based on IMax's need to screen titles several times a day. The musical soundtrack was another standout in my memory with a lovely score by John Barry (which I do have on CD.)

I can only assume that this title must be tied up in litigation somehow or it's copyright has not been released, to keep it off the market for so long. I know it would be a great seller for the Bluray 3D series that have previously been released by IMax. I'll be in line to purchase it when I learn of it's release.",1388880000,,730,4.140845070422535

I've been waiting for it to be available on DVD, but finally gave up and bought the VHS. It did not disappoint. If you like Lifetime and the Hallmark channel, this is just your thing.

7792930,5,0800191617,"""Across The Sea Of Time"" was an uncompromisingly spectacular and entertaining 3D experience in the IMAX theatre - for the many good reasons expressed in the earlier reviews here. Since we are currently seeing several genuine ""Blu-Ray 3D"" releases from IMAX, I am hoping that this film will be also be released in that format.

This is a grand scale IMAX 3D mini-epic blending state of the art monochrome 3D
still photography from 1916, with stunning full-colour 3D motion and surround sound from 1995.

The story is obviously contrived to make optimum use of the archival material: a young Russian boy, Tomas Minton, travels ""blind"" (i.e. in a room with no view) by ship to New York, and jumps ship to search for a relative who emigrated early in the century. That man had found paid work as a specialist 3D photographer and had sent home a viewer and a set of his slides which showed any aspects of 1916 New York life.

Tomas routinely refers to this collection of pictures as he wanders the city trying to find recognisable landmarks in the modern skyline.

I couldn't personally recall but am advised, via an IMDB contributor, that The World Trade Centre ""features quite prominently in at least two scenes in the movie. A jolt to bring us back to modern times hey!""

The 1916 images are extraordinarily detailed, fully justifying the IMAX big screen and we see a lot more than just the facade of skyscrapers, or the tinsel of Broadway. I am never likely to see New York in person, so I was impressed by all of the visuals.

Director Stephen Low takes advantage of opportunities to push people's 3D response buttons, but it's not done excessively. The overall impact is of a very big city, with a personal history of endurance in the face of hardship, and with many elements of true beauty in its landscape and architecture.

There's a rather natty but very unlikely happy ending, instead of the most likely event of Tomas being grabbed by Immigration and thrown on the first plane back to Russia (proving that this really is a work of fiction).",1289606400,4,2047,4.685236768802229

A young Russian boy, Thomas Minton, travels to New York as a passenger on a Russian freighter. Close to Ellis Island he gets off and thus starts his journey to America the same way as all immigrants in former times. Thomas is searching for the family of one of his ancestors, who had emigrated decades ago, but once sent a letter home together with a sample of his new profession: 3D-Photography. The boy follows his relative's traces by counter-checking the old 3D-Photographs of New York (using an antique viewer) with the same places and how they look today. This way, the audience gets to see the Big Apple in former times as well as today. Written by Julian Reischl [...]

If you are outside of the USA Pal area, be advised that you would have to convert this to your regional format - or have a multi-format vhs player.",1252368000,2,964,4.528735632183908
7792932,5,0800191617,"New York born and bred, I have a soft spot for any movie that tenderly portrays the journey of our ancestors through Ellis Island.  This film is touching in its telling of the story of a little boy who stows away on a ship to New York City to find his distant relative.  Armed only with a torn back pack and tattered old photos from the early 1900's, he travels through the city, wide-eyed and in wonder of all the beauty the city has to offer.  From the simple pleasures of eating a real New York hot dog, to walking the boardwalk on Coney Island, there is something for everyone in this touching tale.  Lots of authentic filming in New York brings the story to life, and the pre September 11th shots of Downtown Manhattan and the World Trade Center are profound.  If you had the chance to see this wonderful film in IMAX 3-D many years ago, you were treated to something even more spectacular.  The soundtrack is not to be missed ~ just perfect to accompany this movie.  Enjoy!",1159056000,4,979,4.375690607734807
