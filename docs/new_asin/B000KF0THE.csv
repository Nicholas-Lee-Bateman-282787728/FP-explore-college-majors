I first saw Anna Tsuchiya in movies. I have not seen many actors or actresses that transitioned into a strong music career. I was pleasantly surprised with Anna. This is a great concert from Anna's earlier rock days, and musically, Anna is supported by an outstanding band. The music has a full dual-guitar sound supported by a very solid rhythm section featuring melodic bass lines and an artistic, energetic drum foundation.
