538863,5,6303018025,"Mario Lanza created, arguably, his best singing characterization in ""Serenade"" as a vinyard worker becoming an opera singer.  He goes in & out of his mind with obsession over Joan Fontaine, his sponsor.  Sarita Montiel, the actress who worked in many Mexican films was a vision & had a great scene with Joan toward the end.  She also is the one who saves Lanza's from both physical & artistic extinction.  Vincent Price plays a good guy journalist, while Vince Edwards plays a boxer & love interest (therefore Mario's rival) of Joan's.  This means that Lanza was just a passing fancy for her.  His obsession causes the initial downfall of his career as he walks out of a performance of Verdi's ""Otello"" in progress, leaving Licia Albanese as Desdemona in an awkward lurch.  The VHS tape (not yet transferred to DVD) is in excellent condition.",1276041600,,842,4.805555555555555
538864,5,6303018025,"Some might say that Mario Lanza was overweight and not in his best voice for this Movie, but that would be judging him by those factors alone. This in my opinion ironically is Lanza's best Movie ever! Serenade is a very dramatic Movie with great performances from the likes of Joan Fontaine and in particular Sarita Montiel who really makes this Picture. Add this to the beautiful colourful backdrops and a haunting and dramatic score in the use of 'Serenade', and what you have is a cocktail for a fabulous Movie! For a two hour Film this could have been 'over-long' but in fact the two hours fly by as the whole is so absorbing.

This lush Masterpiece from 1956 is so under-rated as to never have been released on either Video or DVD in the United Kingdom - and only on Video for a limited period in the USA. If you want to own this Movie you're going to have to be patient and hunt madly, but it will be well worth the time spent! And for those who've already seen it, they will want to own it also, and so you'll have some pretty stiff competition in obtaining one of those scarce copies! If you haven't seen it, then book yourself a night in when it is next shown on TV for a great piece of entertainment, and have the chocolates and wine at the ready for a good quality night's viewing!

This is a superb production - oh, and don't forget the tissues!

538866,5,6303018025,"""Serenade,"" is an excellent, and not shown much.  Mario Lanza's
story is more sad in this one with more obstackles, such as trying to forget a woman he loved. Sara Montiel is excellent in it and beautiful as his wife.  It is romantic but has moment of sadness as well.  It's one the the best films to chowcase Mario's acting abilities.",1052006400,8,335,4.459016393442623
538867,5,6303018025,"Supurb acting and a great musical score make ""Serenade"" an easy favorite of Lanza and Opera fans alike. Another movie that will merit repeat watchs not only for the story line but especially for the musical score. What a great talent!

538868,5,6303018025,"I was mightily impressed with Lanza's vocal performance in this movie, and agreeably surprised by his (often) fine acting. He's no Olivier, and as Derek McGovern says in his review, he needed to reined in by the director at times, but in his best moments he is totally believable, and often moving.
But what grabbed me was his singing. If you can overlook the awful singing during the opening credits, almost everything from La Danza on is fantastic. What an assortment of vocal goodies! The Otello scenes took my breath away. I was simply astonished at the end of the monolog, and I don't believe this aria will ever be sung better. The same goes for Amor Ti Vieta (beautifully filmed), Torna A Surriento and the Lamento Di Federico. Just about the only aria he doesn't quite pull off (surprisingly) is Nessun Dorma. In this one, he's pushing too much for my liking, and I, too, would have liked a retake. After all, Lanza had the perfect voice for this aria.
The co-stars in the movie are great, especially Sarita Montiel and Vincent Price. I read somewhere that Vincent Price was enormously impressed by Lanza's singing, and that's quite a compliment from someone who had heard all the opera greats.
Serenade is a true melodrama, and a greatly underrated film.",1015113600,24,1263,4.745454545454545
538869,5,6303018025,"After a four-year absence from the silver screen, Mario Lanza gave his finest dramatic performance as a singer haunted by a woman from his past. He strides among the sunny Mexican landscape in all of his photogenic olive-skinned glory, ill one minute, working in the fields and back singing the next.
 His renderings of Schubert's ""Ave Maria"", ""Nessun Dorma"", and ""O Paradiso"", and the title song are heavenly.
 Inevitably, with 1950s censorship codes firmly in place, James Cain's steamy novel had to be toned down. To this end, the equally photogenic Sara Montiel becomes a bullfighter's daughter rather than a prostitute, and an appropriately respctable and submissive wife to Lanza. She is helpful in furthering her husband's career interests and helping him put the past behind him.
 But the past catches up with him, and Joan Fontaine's cold aristocratic anti-heroine, who derides in building people up and then destroying them, traps the young couple in her clutches once more with near-tragic results. Fontaine's role is comparable to that of Glenn Close's in ""Dangerous Liasons"", but less graphic. Vincent Price is his usual elegantly sinister movie personna as one of Lanza's benefactors.
 Those of us born after Lanza's untimely death can only wonder what his acting skills might be like now if they were free of the stilted, superficial, and rather corny constraints of the'50s. But this is as good as he gets, and his singing, although more somber than ever, is free of such constraints and as majestic as ever. As was observed in 1956, he was ""still in possession of that God-given High C"", which literally and figuratively, is the triumphant note on which this film ends.",1001894400,21,1686,5.053956834532374
538870,5,6303018025,"Serenade is far and away Mario Lanza's most interesting movie, and has a great deal more going for it than Time Magazine and other habitual Lanza-knockers would care to admit. While undeniably flawed, Serenade contains moments of greatness that redeem its shortcomings, and successive viewings only enhance one's appreciation of this underrated work.

Most people would nominate The Great Caruso as Lanza's best movie, and certainly it's a much more consistent film than Serenade. The Great Caruso also takes far fewer risks, featuring a ""safe"" choice of familiar operatic standards, and a screenplay that is little more than a series of entertaining vignettes. There is no real dramatic pulse to The Great Caruso at all, with a clichd script that leaves Lanza few opportunities to flex his acting muscles. On the positive side, the tenor is in exceptionally beautiful voice, and it is this combination of gorgeous vocalism and undeniable charisma that holds the whole thing together so well.

While The Great Caruso would probably be most Lanza aficionados' first choice as an introduction to the tenor, Serenade has so much more meat on its bones that it invariably makes the stronger impression, warts and all.

""I didn't know Lanza could act!"" was one friend's response to this movie. And the tenor's acting is one of the big surprises in Serenade. For aside from some superb singing, Lanza succeeds more often than not in a performance that should have been a revelation to moviegoers at the time, accustomed as they were to the tenor's fluffier cinematic vehicles. Not that he was given much credit for his efforts, with some critics preferring to comment on his appearance rather than acknowledge any real acting potential. ""He looks like a colossal ravioli set on toothpicks,"" sneered Time Magazine in a typically mean-spirited and inaccurate review.

To be objective, Lanza's acting does veer towards hamminess at times - a fault which director Anthony Mann should have corrected - but there are many scenes in which he is highly effective. These include those with supporting actor Vincent Price in the role of Lanza's acid-tongued impresario. Interestingly enough, in the novel it is Price's character with whom the singer falls in love initially. In adapting Serenade for the screen, the scenarists retained the implication that Price's character is gay, but transferred the object of Lanza's desire to his wealthy sponsor Kendall Hale, played by Joan Fontaine.

Miss Fontaine would not have been my first choice for the role. Although she oozes vindictiveness, there is little chemistry between her and Lanza - a vital aspect if one is to believe that the tenor is hopelessly infatuated with her. She should positively exude sexual power (a la Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct), but instead she merely seems conniving.

The highlight of the film, both vocally and visually, is the Otello Act III Monologue (Dio! Mi Potevi Scagliar) scene. Superbly filmed with one exception (an unnecessary - and clumsily inserted - ""E` la!"" from the performer playing Iago), we see the skyscrapers first as the orchestra roars the thunderous opening bars of the Monologue, followed by a sweeping shot inside the opera house that pans from an opened score of Otello to the stage itself, where Lanza is rehearsing Verdi's sublime aria. Everything is superb about his acting and singing here, as he adroitly conveys Otello's inner turmoil, ranging from a resigned weariness to maniacal joy, and concluding with a stunning ""O GIOIA!"" that must have left cinemagoers dumbstruck by its brilliance. It is an extraordinary scene, and a poignant reminder of what the tenor could have done with the role on stage. ""Mr. Lanza never was in better voice,"" A.H. Weiler of The New York Times would later observe, and Mario's rendition of the Otello Monologue is arguably his greatest operatic achievement. As the critic John Cargher once remarked, the Otello Monologue alone would ""assure Lanza of immortality.""

Also appearing in the film is the fiery Sarita Montiel in the role of Juana, sanitized here as a famous bullfighter's daughter rather than as the novel's common prostitute.

Montiel is excellent in almost every scene, and restores much of the storyline's credibility. The same cannot be said of Lanza's performance, however, which is frankly uneven in several of the key Mexican scenes between himself and Montiel. Quite possibly he was unsure of himself in the initial stages of filming, but whatever the reason a retake should definitely have been made of the confrontation scene in which Montiel passionately tells him: ""You lived through the fever, but your heart is dead!"" Clearly nervous here, he overacts - a great pity given the spectacular location filming (in San Miguel de Allende) and atmospheric mood in this scene.

Lanza's Ave Maria redeems everything, however. Looking pale and very overweight, he enters a church where Sarita Montiel is quietly praying. Speaking (conveniently!) in English, her words visibly affect Lanza, and in a very subtle piece of acting, he kneels before the altar and quietly begins Schubert's famous hymn. This is the first time that Montiel's character has heard Lanza sing, and her reaction is beautifully captured. Most impressive of all is the way Lanza looks at her at the conclusion of the piece, breaking her heart (and ours) with his simple dignity and sweetness. It is a magical moment that never fails to move me.

But enough of the plot. I hope I have whetted prospective viewers' appetites for this much-overlooked musical melodrama. Let me end by saying that Serenade is certainly deserving of rediscovery, and that vocally, at least, it is in a class of its own.",998265600,56,5711,5.098395721925134

538872,4,6303018025,"After a hiatus of four years, which followed a stormy relationship with MGM studios, the talented film and radio tenor Mario Lanza made this 1955 come-back film for Warner Bros. Based on the steamy James Cain story, it  was cleaned up for 1950's movie tastes and turned into a Lanza vehicle.  Changing the story line to a talented singer who is ruined by one women and  redeemed by another, Lanza gave the most dramatic screen performance of his  seven films.  The musical score was just as heavy.  Aside from the title  song by Cahn & Brodsky, which is certainly dramatic enough (and sung no  less than three times!) the music includes the same team's My Destiny, the  Italian favorites La danza and Torna Sorriento, and operatic selctions from  La Boheme, Fedora, L'Africana, L'Arlesiana, Il Trovatore, Der  Rosenkavalier, Turandot and Otello.  Co-stars include Joan Fontaine, Sarita  Montiel, Harry Bellaver, and Vincent Price as an suave, sarcastic,  sophisticated booking agent; he's really good in the role! Also worth  hearing are sopranos Licia Albanese and Jean Fenn. The Mexican scenary is  colorful, and Anthony Mann directs with a sure hand. Lanza's personal  appearance, as usual, varies, and his hairdo is really ""far-out,  man!"": not even Elvis had a pompadour like this! but I think the movie  holds up well for being a controversial novel that was turned into a  musical vehicle for a star tenor of his day.  Lanza is always worth a  listen, and you'll get some over the top acting here from all, as well.  Recommended.",958435200,13,1536,4.9372549019607845

""Serenade"" was a chance for Mario Lanza to show that his style of acting had matured to take on a complex role.  Most importantly, the movie exhibited his operatic skill with the same power and freshness of his previous work.  The film is splendid.  It has fine acting, a good plot and, most of all, the greatest tenor and singer of all time.  See the movie for him, first and foremost.

Mario Lanza was the most versatile performer who ever walked on a stage. He could sing opera like the most amazing tenors. He was a master at ""crossing over"" from lyric opera to popular singing. As a result, he was a top recording artist and concert performer. In the ""Great Caruso"" he also showed he could be a global movie sensation. The movie about the amazing Neapolitan tenor actually was about Mario Lanza. It turned the Great Caruso into the Great Lanza. He exhibited all of his superlative qualities.

His movies inspired me to write my recent book about Mario Lanza: ""A Kid from Philadelphia, Mario Lanza, the Voice of the Poets."" It is not a biography. There have been several excellent bios about him. This is a book from a fan. It exhibits his qualities, talents, passion and love for his art. I wanted it to be a ""page turner"" that would be impossible to put down as you listen to the magnificent voice of Mario Lanza.  Read the book and listen to him sing.  It will be a memorable event.

Anyone who loves Lanza the movie star, the tenor, the popular singer and the human being who did so much in such a short time will love ""Serenade.""",1381536000,,1775,4.986440677966102

But he masters the complex role - critics are wrong not to have praised this mature and serious film - and Monteil, the Mexican actress does a superb job in believable love and obsession.

539095,4,6303018025,"After waiting too long for the DVD release of this great film, I am quite disappointed with Warner for including it in its made-to-order DVD-R Archive Collection. It is also outrageous that they are trying to pass it as a ""remastered edition"" when it is NOT. No restoration and no remastering were involved. My dreams of a restored edition with enhanced audio and lots of extras have been totally shattered. The price is also quite high for a no frills product such as this. Maybe they'll come up with a better (de-luxe) edition in a couple of years to continue the shameful practice of digging into consumer's pockets several times with the same product.

After clarifying the mediocre aspects of this DVD I will go into the positive.  ""Serenade"" is a great film in the sense that it is pure entertainment and will keep the viewer interested from beginning to end. Don't expect an honest rendering of the James M. Cain novel on which it was supposedly based.  It also helps if you like opera and bel canto since it contains excerpts from some of the greatest operas as wells as classic favorites such as Torna a Surriento and Ave Mara. Mario Lanza is in top form vocally with moments that are truly amazing.  In my opinion he was never more effective in films. Listening to his marvelous voice and the passion he adds to every musical performance in ""Serenade"" is an unforgettable satisfying experience. His acting in this film is brilliant at times but has some embarrassing moments as well. Director Anthony Mann should have done some fine-tuning in that department. (Mann was at his best directing westerns)

However the acting of the supporting cast is simply superb especially Sarita Montiel, as the woman who saves Lanza from destruction, and Vincent Price as a classy promoter with a sharp tongue. Joan Fontaine just adds a lot of Hollywood glamour as the cold-hearted socialite wearing elegant gowns and jewelry even in the intimacy of her apartment! ""Serenade"" also features some beautiful locations in California's wine country and Mexico's San Miguel Allende.
