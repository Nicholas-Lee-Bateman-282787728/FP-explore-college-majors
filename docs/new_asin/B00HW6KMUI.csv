8636841,5,B00HW6KMUI,"My 4th grade students were totally captivated watching this movie. (We watched it in two segments.) They were in awe at how difficult it was for these children to get to school, yet how important it was for them to get an education. They also gained a new sense of appreciation for how easy it is for American kids to get to school-walk or ride the bus. Some of them said they felt ""guilty"" for whining about having to go to school.",1435622400,6,432,4.280487804878049
