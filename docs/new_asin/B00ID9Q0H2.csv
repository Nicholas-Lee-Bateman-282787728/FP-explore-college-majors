6259449,5,B00ID9Q0H2,"Before Gurren Lagann, before Neon Evangelion, before Gundam, before Reideen, there was Japan's original weapon of mass destruction, Mazinger Z!  And before Dr. Hell and Baron Ashura had their mechanical monster army destroying Tokyo from ""Mazinkaiser,"" over 40 years later, how it ALL  began (including the mecha genre), the U.S. release is finally here!

""ROCKET PUNCH!"" - In early 1970, Go Nagai, the second Japanese Manga artist after Osamu Tezuka, mastered the robot illustration based on Astro Boy, and created the first giant super robot to be driven by a human being called, ""Mazinger Zeto,"" was published in October of 1972.  Within a year later, Nagai's Mazinger manga became a huge success as Astro Boy's and Gigantor/Tetseujin's popularity began to fade, Nagai applied Mazin to anime format and the super robot/mecha genre was born.
*Mazinger's fist and forearm can launch against or hit an enemy target from a distance.

Rocket Punch Power Ups (in later episodes);
""IRON CUTTERS!"" - A pair of axe-like blades extends from Mazinger's forearms to cut enemies.

""REINFORCED ROCKET PUNCH!"" - The right fist and forearm is reinforced with a super alloy with a gold colored spike armlet.

""DRILL MISSILE!"" - When Rocket Punches are flipping the forearms up from Mazinger's elbows, spiked missiles are fired at his enemies.

""SPINNING ROCKET PUNCH!"" - Mazinger's most powerful attack when rotating his arms very fast, he launches his Rocket Punches. Making his attack faster and more powerful than a normal Rocket Punch.

""PHOTON BEAM!"" - Based on the manga, Dr. Kabuto secretly built a giant super robot called Mazinger Z.  Powered by photon energy harnessed from the Photon Institute, equipped with an array of destructive weapons, Mazin's body is Super-Alloy Z (from a new element discovered with his assistant, Dr. Yumi, called ""Japanium,"") arranged for his grandsons, Kouji and Shiro to defend against Dr. Hell, his lieutenant, Baron Ashura, Iron Masks and their mechanical monsters. Kouji became the first of several teenage manga-anime characters to pilot a super robot before similar military style storylines for Amuro Ray of the original mobile suit Gundam and Hikaru Ichijyo of Super Dimensional Fortress Macross.  Among friends and allies, Dr. Yumi, his robot technicians, a giant research robot his daughter, Yumi Sayaka, pilots called Aphrodite A who intentionally assists Kouji in nearly every incident with Mazinger Z while working alongside her father.  And Boss Berot (with two of his motorcycle buddies) who bullies his way with Kouji and became the first manga-anime character to build and name his own DIY robot out of junk and scrap parts, after himself for comic relief.
*Two powerful laser beams of energy can fire from Mazinger's eyes.

""RUST HURRICANE!"" - After Tezuka's Astro Boy, the success of Mazinger Z widen the popularity of manga and anime worldwide before other super robots followed suit, Mazinger Z merchandise turned up in stores; toy figures, posters, apparrel, etc. as Nagai continued Mazin in sequels and spin-offs after the original series' end with Great Mazinger, UFO Grendizer, anime crossover films (with Devilman, Great Mazinger, Grendizer and Getter Robo G in Nagai's super robot universe), Mazinkaiser, Mazinkaiser SKL and Shin Mazinger Z anime series.
*From Mazinger's mouth, a whirlwind of rusting particles casts out making enemy robots rust rapidly and blown away.

""MISSILE PUNCH!"" - Gundam creator, Yoshiyuki Tomino, recently stated he respects the popularity of  the super robots but in contrast to Gundam he added, ""The super robots are cartoonish from Gundam's reality based world."" When I rediscovered Mazinger Z, there is a good percentage of reality in this series with funny but true comedy. Kouji is licensed to drive a motorcycle and a car but not for piloting a flying hovercraft (Pilder) and/or a giant super robot from the first episode, his historic hover docking Pilder on Mazinger's head when he didn't know how to activate docking thrusters and began button mashing the robot's controls (most not labelled except some with single digits and letters) while Gundam's Amuro, easily found the pilot's manual and quickly learned it's operations. Manga and anime experts claim Kouji's historic moment with Mazinger as an ""early stage of transforming."" Transforming is metamorphing as seen in Getter Robo. Gaiking, Daimos and other super robot transforming combiners.  Contrary to them Pilder only folds her wings and docks on Mazinger's head like a space capsule does to a lunar module and the robot activaties.
*The abdominal portion opens, and a big missile launches against his enemies.

""BREAST FIRE!"" - Golden-age anime fans waited a long time for this series' original Japanese release years after Spanish, Mexico, Hong Kong import and bootlegged versions.  Some are disappointed this version does not have Englsh translated dialogue.  Unfortunately, the ONLY English language dubbed version is TranZor Z by Three B. Productions from 1985.  TranZor of Mazinger Z, was re-editted for American television viewers due to the edginess in the OJ series consisting 92 episodes, the TranZor set only has 65 of them.  And the characters' names were also changed.
*From Mazinger's red chest plates, a powerful heat beam is fired at his enemies, burning or melting them.",1410652800,,5336,5.283687943262412
6259450,5,B00ID9Q0H2,"I'm extremely happy and very please to have this series in my hands, Mazinger Z was one of the shows i used to watch here in Puerto Rico when i was a kid (it was also my first anime to ever see) which he was quite popular here as well in all hispanic and around the world (still he is). When i heard that Discotek Media manage to get the license to release Mazinger Z in its original Japanese version my hype meter broke, heck i thought that no one would ever bring him so big kudos to Discotek media for doing something that no one would even dare to do for the U.S.A.

The story is about a young boy name Koji Kabuto(main hero and pilot of Mazinger Z) with his little brother Shiro discovering this robot that his Grandfather Prof. Juzo Kabuto built naming it Mazinger Z but sadly Prof. Kabuto is killed by Baron Ashura who is one of Dr. Hell's henchmen.  Mazinger Z was built to fight Dr. Hell who is bent on world conquest with giant Mechanical Beats which he creates using an ancient technology from an ancient civilization that was  found on an island know as Bardos Island. It was discovered years ago in an expedition with different scientist (Prof. Juzo Kabuto included) and archaeologist around the world which where all guided by Dr. Hell himself. Suddenly Dr. Hell betrays the expedition team which he reveals his true nature and plans of world domination and proceeds to kill the expedition team. However, Prof. Kabuto manage to escape from the onslaught and heads to Japan where he creates the Photon Research Lab where he discovers the Japanium ore locate at the base of Mount Fuji and creates the Super alloy Z and Photon Energy.

He retires from the Photon Research Lab and leaves it in the hands of his successor Prof. Yumi. Prof. Kabuto gives Mazinger Z to his Grandson Koji to pilot it and fight Dr. Hell to stop him on his track for world domination. Along the way Koji will meet friends like Sayaka Yumi( daughter of Prof. Yumi) and here robot Aphrodite A (created in the Photon Power Lab as a symbol of world peace) as well his friendly rivals like Boss.

now to the actual disc and such.

This series is the actual original one, this is not the horrendous heavy edited version know as Tranzor Z which they made combine footages of 2 series which one is Mazinger Z (the one here) and Great Mazinger(his sequel).

-The box art: on the front is very nice and clean, its base pretty much of those use on the actual Japanese dvd/ blue ray versions. At the back of the box it tells you the story about the show  with a couple of pics although its not as clean as the front of the box mind you, but it does its job.

- The first Mazinger volume is compose of 6 DVD with a total of 46 episodes, all disc has the same image cover which is simple but each one tells you the numbers of the episodes on each disc.

- the Menu looks very nice and pretty much straight forward showing the title of the episodes which you can select any, the Play all option and the Subtitle option are available as well.

- Video Quality: the videos look very clean for such an old show which im very impress with. mind you that the animation is old so seen it this clean is extremely impressive to be honest.

- Audio Quality: it sounds very crisp and clean with no sound grain like sometimes happens in the VHS years ago.

- Subtitles: there is only one option which is English Subs and i have to say they did a pretty good job with which is fateful to the actual series with names and everything, unlike other places that makes them very stupid and ridiculous (Giant Omnipotent Iron Knight....WTF?!?!).

- Dubs: There is no dubbing of any kind, only the Japaneses Language which is kinda sad but understandable for the licensing issues plus it would be more expensive. but it would have been awesome to hear it in all the languages of the world(except for the Tranzor Z one since they heavy butchered and edited the series to much, however there was a Hawaiian version that was much more true to the show.).

- Extra: im afraid there aren't any extra to see so don't expect any of it.

Conclusion:

I give Kudos to Discotek Media for bringing this show, I never though that someone would be able to bring this series to the Americas at all. Do note that although this volume only brought 46 episodes, the series itself has 92 episodes in total. The other half is gonna be release this December (accordingly to Discotek Media's facebook) so im looking forward on getting it and complete the Mazinger Z saga story and hoping they will be able to bring its sequels (Great Mazinger and UFO Robo Grendizer). Granted that while in the Extra department is laking as well the language dubbing options im still very happy to have this.

Do i recommended? yes i do recommend it for everyone to see.",1410566400,16,4784,4.410896708286039

6259454,5,B00ID9Q0H2,"I wasn't too sure what to expect from this, but I like it! The video is nice and crisp, showing off the artwork of the hand-drawn animation nicely on a modern TV. The audio sounds just as you'd expect for an old anime.

Subtitles are optional. Next episode previews are included.

Packaging does the job, if I was going to nitpick I'd wish they'd have used different pictures for each disc, but oh well.

The back of the box only lists region 1, but it works in my PS3 so I suppose that means it is region 4 too.

Looking forward to part 2!",1399766400,5,540,4.163461538461538
6259455,5,B00ID9Q0H2,"After all these years, we finally get a chance  to see this series in  commercial release!!  One of the kings of the Giant robot anime saga has a release on DVD!!  These DVDS are release Japanese language with English subtitles!  These  are original US release from the 1970's.  They originally aired 1976 on  UHF, KWHY-TV, Channel 22.  With snow, on a black & white TV screen, (due to bad reception, a regular TV antenna, and a TV station 100 miles away) I was able to watch these shows 6 O'clock Sundays nights.  What a delight it is to finally get these on DVD for the first time and in full color too!!

ENJOY!!",1399248000,9,615,4.353982300884955
6259456,2,B00ID9Q0H2,"I preordered the DVD reasonably assuming a couple of details from the description. Mainly the language...which on it's release date it stated just English. Just English, not Japanese with English subtitles, and not even just Japanese and English. I may have assumed it was just referring to subtitles had there not being a couple dubs of the series that actually exist. The only other detail that was off on the description was that there are 6 Discs, but can't see anyone being frustrated about that detail.

What you will be getting is a DVD case with 6 DVDs in it. Each one has episodes from the classic anime Mazinger Z with your options of subtitles or no subtitles. The quality looks great and is a big step up from anything you'll find online.",1398816000,4,750,4.639097744360902

8641176,4,B00ID9Q0H2,"Great classic series based on Go Nagai's manga and along with Vol. 2 it is a must own for his fans/giant robot fans. Like most older anime, it is essentially ""villain of the week"" battles and gets repetitive but the strange atmosphere, great character design, and music make up for the monotony. Early on there are references to Kabuto still not knowing how to operate Mazinger Z but after a few episodes there isn't really a major ongoing story (ie- you could watch most of these in any order and not miss anything). Great for just watching one or two episodes at a time, not really for binging a dozen episodes or more.

As for the packaging of this set, I had to return it twice because the case seems cheap and discs were loose and damaged inside. Since Amazon ships these in a bubble envelope, for my 3rd attempt to get this set i paid $10 more from a reputable anime site that always ships in a box! Even the copy I own now, the discs will just fall out while sitting on the shelf! I have to look around and see if there are higher quality case options that are the same size.

The video quality is good but is interlaced, so if you don't have a player that de-interlaces it might look worse. No extras at all.

In the end, I highly recommend to all Nagai fans and classic anime, or giant robot anime fans! Let's hope more classic unreleased Nagai is coming next!",1516579200,,1369,4.319066147859922

8641179,5,B00ID9Q0H2,"I've written a full review here: http://www.fandompost.com/2014/08/23/mazinger-z-tv-series-part-1-anime-dvd-review/ but left some points below:

Audio:
The only audio present here is Japanese Dolby stereo 2.0 and it sounds pretty good without any noticeable distortions.

Video:
This series was originally broadcast in 1972, and looks good here. The cel animation holds up fine and colors are vibrant and steady. The nuances of old-school sketch-line animation are still fun to watch. The subtitles are colored and detailed appropriately, which makes them easy to read as needed.

In Summary:

Mazinger Z is a lot of fun from an historical perspective in knowing what entertained Japanese children and influenced them (and eventually us) to enjoy the prospect of huge hunks of humanoid metal beating the hell out of each other. The heroic super-robot genre has largely died off now in more recent years outside of revivals such as some Getter Robo shows, Gaogaigar, Gurren Lagann and Go Nagais Koji Kabuto coming back for Mazinkaiser and Shin Mazinger Z-Hen. It wasn't meant for deep philosophical discussion like Evangelion or to inspire political debates the way much of Mobile Suit Gundam has over the years. Mazinger Z has a recyclable plot with many variations that lasted for close to two years broadcast time, and influenced anime companies to create even more works around this theme for many years.",1450742400,,1407,5.381818181818182

8641182,5,B00ID9Q0H2,"Outstanding old school Super Robot anime from 1972 - still entirely watchable, and in some ways better than much of what's come since in this genre of anime.

Quick info of relevance -

*Comes packaged in a six disc plastic DVD case, it's a cheap one, but still better than what might have been.

*The series is colour, and presented in a 4:3 aspect ratio - excellent picture quality, impressive actually.

*Japanese audio (only) with a quality English sub - which is perfect as far as I'm concerned.

*The DVD's appear to be region free, as they work just fine in my Region 4 DVD player.

A must own series for any self-respecting Giant Robot anime fan, and not just because it's a ""classic"" - it's still good.
