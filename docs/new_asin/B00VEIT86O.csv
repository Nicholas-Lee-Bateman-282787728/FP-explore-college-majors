7087759,4,B00VEIT86O,"Taking the viewpoint of 3 women during the Great Jewish rebellion against Rome war was amazing.  When woman were considered property to have them as the main viewpoint is just inspiring.  They say that Masada symbolizes the will and determination of the Jewish people to live free in their own land, I truly got that same impression from this movie.  The way the people didn't understand how plants and everyday items could be used to cure people of illnesses, they called them witches just because they didn't understand.  I can't wait to get this so I won't have to deal with all the commercials they put in for the TV premier.  They could have made the movie longer and had a bit more details about the beginning of the Great Jewish rebellion on Rome when Masada was first taken over by Rome and then taken back by the zealots.  Because of this movie, Masada is now on my bucket list of places to visit before I die.",1428019200,21,919,4.473053892215569
7087760,5,B00VEIT86O,"The Dove keepers was excellent the struggles of women to survive in a man's world and the Jewish people at the hands of Rome told a sad story of faith, loss love, family, and children. Everyone involved should be proud of the amazing final results. Being a fan of Cote de Pablo made it even better for me.",1427932800,27,305,4.275862068965517
7087761,4,B00VEIT86O,"Perhaps one of reviewer missed all the ""begats"" in the Old Testament. Indiscriminate-war inevitably generates indiscriminate sex. Granted, a well written book often provides more depth and detail than a motion picture, but the characters were not all black and white. This movie was excellent in its portrayal of the multidimensional aspects of the major characters on both sides. Flavius Josephus, a Jew born and raised in Jerusalem, is the only historian to provide a detailed account of the Great Jewish Revolt and the only person who recorded what happened on Masada. We very much appreciated this aspect of the telling of the Siege of Masada. We would rate the film a 4 or 5 star production, and will probably buy the DVD version when the prices settle down a little.",1427846400,37,772,4.900763358778626

7087763,2,B00VEIT86O,"I really wanted to like this movie...it was about Masada which I find fascinating and it was told from the viewpoint of 3 women.  Instead of the emotions and the struggles of women faced with horrendous decisions, while still trying to have day to day lives, the mini series gave us gratuitous sex, and adultery...constantly, without balance.  When it could have made these women so much more, the producers chose to pander to sex, repeatedly for what I can only guess were ratings. I mean, really, having sex in the aquaduct that supplied the public drinking water?  The producers cheapened the lives of the true women of Masada and frankly made the move cheap.  The concept of having the surviving women tell their story to another Jew, who had chosen to survive among the Romans, was a novel concept and held promise.....a promise unfulfilled.",1427846400,28,846,4.854166666666667

7087767,5,B00VEIT86O,"great movie, even though it is a fictional account of what transpired to the hundreds of Jews that were trapped on Masada, it is believable. The only other ""witness"" to the tragedy of Masada is Josephus. He is credited as being the only 1st century historian. However, some of his writings have been challenged by other historians. Josephus' writings on the Fall of Masada are found in his ""Antiquities of the Jews."" We do know that Rome attacked Israel in the 1st Century A,D. Many of the Jews fled to their ancient city of Jerusalem. It is believed that as many as one million people were at .Jerusalem. Rome built siege mounds around the city. In 70 A.D.Roman soldiers finally broke into the City and slaughtered everyone in and around the City of Jerusalem. Rome didn't like anyone who opposed them, even though Rome had conquered Israel for at least 100 years prior to this. Israel had tried unsuccessfully to overthrow Rome's rule several times. Rome decided to make an example of Israel, so that other colonies wouldn't try to revolt. Some sources state that Rome crucified thousands of people on the roads leading to Jerusalem. In 71 A.D. Rome returned and plowed Jerusalem and areas around it with salt, so that no crops would grow there. This fulfilled Biblical prophecy as God had repeatedly warned Israel about their apostasy and that He would scatter them all over the Earth. However, God promised Israel that one day He would return the Jewish people to Israel. On May 15, 1948, God fulfilled His promise as Israel was once again a nation. Once the Jews returned to Israel, God promised that they would never have to leave Israel again. In 2000-2,500 B.C. God made a promise to Abraham that his descendants would inherit the Promised Land thru his descendants- Issac and Jacob. Today, the Muslims claim Israel as they claim that Abraham's son through Hagar, his maidservant is the rightful heir. Yet, God was quite specific. "" Through Issac shall your seed be numbered."" Abraham fathered Issac through his wife Sarah. Today, we are still seeing the largest family feud in history.play out. Almighty God who declared that ""I will bless those that bless you and curse those that curse you.""",1491609600,4,2202,4.812664907651715

7087780,5,B00VEIT86O,"I really enjoyed this dramatized mini series about the story of the historic Masada tragedy.  I am a loyal NCIS fan that has missed the Ziva character played by Cote DePablo, so it was nice to see her commendable performance in a movie.  As with most made for TV dramatizations, the historic facts were not always accurately presented  (the movie ""MASADA"" with Peter O'Toole is more accurate), but there were enough positive aspects to make this worth viewing, and I will definitely be watching it again periodically in the future.  I will say that I really enjoyed the scenes when the Hebrew blessing was sung in Hebrew as it should be.",1472688000,5,637,4.711711711711712

This movie is a farce of fornication, sorcery and BS feminism - anyone who knows anything about the history and culture of the people know how ridiculous this storyline is.

7087791,1,B00VEIT86O,"For fans of history,  this story is a joke. Its more about illicit love affairs and adultery than history. The story of Jews escaping the Romans after the destruction of Jerusalem is overshadowed by scenes of forbidden  love affairs and lust.. Mysticism plays a big role also. After the scene where the Moabite 'witch' calls down rain from heaven after being surrounded by Jewish women condemning her for adultery, I turned the movie off. Roma Downey is an obvious New Age adherent and this movie displays it at every turn. My Christian faith is rooted in the values and morals of the Jewish faith. Remember Moses and the ten commandments? Remember  commandment #7 is do not commit adultery? Or how about #2...no graven images. Instead this movie celebrates adultery and incantations while  the Jewish faith and desire for freedom from slavery by Rome is barely noted. Its a stupid move and I want my money back.",1460937600,4,912,4.826923076923077

The movie is entertaining but certainly not historically factual.  Note; you may want to shop around for best pricing.  Usually Amazon is hands down the cheapest but not in this case.

7087806,1,B00VEIT86O,"In ""The Dovekeepers,"" way more emphasis was made in creating a sexy tear-jerk story than providing any message on what really happened in Masada.  If creating a ""sexy"" story was what Roma intended, she probably succeeded.  It is such a shame that Dovekeepers follows AD so quickly because what happens is that when viewers go on to watch ""The Bible"" and ""AD,"" they wonder if (just like The Dovekeepers) are these also simply ""made for TV Miniseries""  with just a created story and not a message?  So very sad that ""The Bible"" and ""AD"" were followed up by The Dovekeepers that probably works to dilute the credibility and serious message of ""The Bible"" and ""AD""",1443916800,2,660,4.71304347826087

7087808,4,B00VEIT86O,"The Dovekeepers presents a slightly different view of the Siege of  Masada.  It is told from a women point of view.  Several women are tied together through family ties and friendship.  Cote de Pablo is the lead character  Shirah, Rachel Brosnahan is Yale, Shirah niece and Kathryn Prescott is  Aziza is Shirah daughter.  Many of the Characters are based on real historical people.  The only person to write about Masada is Flavious Josephus, who is interview Shirah and Yale, who tell him the story of Masada through flashbacks.  Much of the historical story happened and some is made up.  The story is very well told, but there is more romance than action.  One of the comments I read called it lust in the dust and that is fairly accurate.  I never read the book so I don't know how faithful the program is the book so I can't make a proper comparison.

7087812,3,B00VEIT86O,"The acting in this movie was phenomenal.  The cinematography was excellent.  What I am disappointed with is the story line of the author/producers (I have not read the book).  Historical records of the Masada incident indicate that only two women (one who was ""ancient"") and five children had survived.  There is nothing that states an adulterous affair took place between either woman and Eleazar.  My 10 year old granddaughter watched this movie with me and was questioning the sex scenes of the two female leads and their lovers.  While these scenes were mild in comparison to mainstream media, I believe it still went too far for a movie by Christian producers.  While they may have felt this would allow it to reach more people, we are called to be in the world but not of the world.  I am disappointed that Roma Downey and Mark Burnett would put their stamp on this movie.",1440288000,2,878,4.69281045751634

Yes, there were adulterous people, not just women, but also men.  But, this movie portrays it as normal, rather than the sinful lifestyle that needs the Lord's forgiveness.  I will not be buying this movie, nor will I recommend it.  The Jewish people were typically NOT the immoral people portrayed in this.  They were God-fearing and God-respecting.  And premarital and adulterous sex were highly frowned upon, to the point where the participants were stoned to death, if they were caught.  Most of what I watched did NOT keep with the Jewish traditions at the time.

7087833,4,B00VEIT86O,"I watched the whole thing. It had some good and some not so good so I gave it an above average rating, because on the whole it was better than average. Not great, but worth watching.

I was not especially fond of the portrayal of the three central females characters as little more than whores.

I thought the portrayal of the Jewish nut cases that thought they could hide from Rome at Masada did not show them quite as nutty as they probably really were.

OTOH, it is a TV movie, and neither TV nor movies are known for portraying historical events in an accurate way, so what you end up with is mostly fiction and movie fantasy. In this case, there is probably no way to know what truly happened at Masada. Historians are paid to write history after the fact and generally write it the way their patrons want it done.

It was good for a few hours of entertainment. I pretty much only watched it because my wife liked the role of Ziva Cote de Pablo played on NCIS.
