8049625,3,B0007OP1W6,"Specifically, regarding Alpha's Bells of San Fernando. The source print is fair to good with a few sporadic missing frames. Some scenes are soft and others are crisp. The soundtrack is good. Better-than-usual Alpha release.

San Fernando is a town in Paradise Valley which of course must have been the San Fernando Valley section of Los Angeles long before the gringos arrived. Juan Mendoza and his henchmen are holding the residents as prisoners.

Michael O'Brien from Ireland, is hanging out in Paradise Valley and has fallen in love with Maria Garcia, daughter of the local blacksmith. Michael stands up to Mendoza and then plots his overthrow. You can deduce the ending.

This is not a cowboy nor western-themed film but rather an historical drama with a cliche love story. Entertaining but not worth more than five dollars and really worth just one dollar. Unfortunately, the dollar store mavens have not released this, so Alpha is your low-price leader.",1172707200,,959,5.056962025316456
