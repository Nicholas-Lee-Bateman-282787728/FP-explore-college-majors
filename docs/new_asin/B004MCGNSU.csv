4429834,5,B004MCGNSU,"I am a big fan of this show.  It really combines my love of ancient civilization and culture with the love of aliens!  The first thing people need to understand, of course, is this show is what I like to call a Historical Theory... What I mean is that it takes historical accuracies and forms a theory around them.  This theory is called the ""Ancient Astronaut"" Theory.  Season 2 picks up where season 1 left off and begins to break down the ""Ancient Astronaut"" theory into 10 episodes.  Each episode deals with a certain overall mystery that mainstream archeology and science perhaps has left open to debate.

Season 2 will take you to underground temples, unexplained technology, documented alien contacts(!), explore the concept of angels, visit massive structures that seem super-human to have erected and even challenge our own understanding of World War II.

Do we truly understand our ancient history and civilizations?  Do we know enough about them to make ""conclusions"" about people's way of life back then, or how things were built? This show aims to show you the alternative views on how ancient history could have been, straying from the main stream popular view.  Many main stream views are nothing more than THEORY themselves.  There is not enough concrete evidence that supports any one theory. The same could be said about Ancient Alien theories as well. As far fetched as some of the theories this show brings to the table might sound, there is that possibility of it being plausible

** OVERALL **
If you have never seen Ancient Aliens then I suggest you start with Season 1 or perhaps even try to catch it on the History Channel.  This way you get one or two episodes in to see if you will like the series or not before spending your $$$.  Overall, Ancient Aliens might bring some pretty far fetched theories to the table but in all honesty how far fetched are they? This is nothing more than questioning the validity of ancient knowledge we know of today.  While the theory of ""Aliens"" is a pretty extreme, the show brings up some fascinating points that does plant the seed of doubt in modern understanding of ancient civilization.

*NOTE: Season 2 consists of 3 disks and a run time of 7 hrs 50minutes (average of 47mins per episode, 10 episodes)",1300320000,22,2268,4.735368956743002
4429835,1,B004MCGNSU,Another season rife with nothing but speculations and the opinions of writers seeking to make a living out of unproven story-telling and sensationalism.,1299542400,14,152,5.6521739130434785
4429836,5,B004MCGNSU,"Season 2, Ancient Aliens is a fantastic study into the unexplained. It is very well documented and presented. It scares alot of people who simply write it off as unbelievable. Some of the info here will be redundant, but hardly boring. If you were to ever start to check out the facts as they are presented, you will find that there's something here, and very mysterious. There is way too many ""Coincidents"" to write this off. Once you start going down this road of study, you'll find that you keep going, if you're an objective person.

This Season 2 consists of 3 DVD's, and 10 hrs of Information. (each show is one hour) If you've ever investigated into this type of information, you'd find that the government covers almost all of this stuff up. I don't know if Bob Lazar will be mentioned in this set, (haven't seen the entire series yet) but his tale is fascinating. And the same government who can make a person disappear, (witness protection) has made his list of credentials disappear.

Unless you are Subjective, you will really enjoy this series!

The Series (season 2) consists of:  Mysterious Places
  Gods & Aliens
  Underwater Worlds
  Underground Aliens
  Aliens & the third Reich
  Alien Tech
  Angels & Aliens
  Unexplained Structures
  Alien Devastations

4429859,4,B004MCGNSU,"Just finished watching ""Ancient Aliens - Season Two"" released by the History Channel.
Now I must admit that I don't take this series seriously.  ""In Search Of"" did a far better job at being an inquisitive documentary style program; but ""Ancient Aliens"" is highly entertaining even as it finds new ways to spin new takes on old ideas - even if those ideas are as outdated as the end of the world that some thought the Mayan Calendar predicted.
The episode on aliens and the Third Reich was highly entertaining - especially if you take into account that if Hitler's Germany did have alien help that they still lost the war.  Guess would be world rulers should always think twice before accepting help from beyond the  Solar System.
Still, ""Ancient Aliens - Season Two"" is fun to watch and there are worse ways to spend time.
Recommended.

4429913,4,B004MCGNSU,"I found all the Ancient Aliens series a stretch of belief. The producers use so-called ""facts"" very loosely and bend others to suit their agenda. In one episode for example one of the presenters ""reminds"" us about the Apollo space mission where the Apollo craft crashed into the moon. He was trying to prove that the moon had been and ""probably still was"" being used by aliens as a forward base to watch the Earth. He said it was his opinion that the moon was hollow and the Apollo space craft crashing ""proved"" that it was because after the crash, the moon ""rang like a bell for two hours afterwards"". Trouble is, I was around when the Apollo missions were going up, and I know that no Apollo crashed into or on the moon.
  At other places, the various presenters quote different literature to ""prove"" a point. They quote parts of the Bible extensively. In Season 4, one presenter says the Hebrew Prophet Jeremiah was speaking with some people in Jerusalem and he became hungry so he sent a young boy by the name of Abimelech out to the fields outside the walls to pick some fresh figs. Abimelech went and came back with the figs, but found that everyone he knew was gone and forty years had gone by. The presenter said the was ""proof"" that aliens were using ""space/time travel. Now I do not know what the presenter was using as a Holy Bible, but I looked, and that incident did not happen. At least, not in my Bible.
  The series is interesting in places and overall quite entertaining - as long as you totally suspend your reality - just look at it for entertainment and it is funny.",1399939200,,1586,4.439862542955327
4429914,5,B004MCGNSU,"I really apreciate the purchase, it matches perfectly my expectations about the product, the shipment was fast, I received just in a while, price was good so I'm very satisfied with this purchase!",1398384000,,196,4.96969696969697
4429915,4,B004MCGNSU,"So if you are familiar with the Ancient Aliens series, Season 2 will be familiar to you.  I have not seen all the episodes in this set yet, actually only the first six, but so far I believe this season is a little more exciting and interesting then the first and the first was pretty good so that's saying something.  If you liked Season 1 then I certainly recommend Season 2.

So why 4/5 stars?  Well, like the first season, there is a bit of repetion in this season as well.  It seems to be an aspect of the production team - this deliberate repeating of the same idea/theme/concept.  Its a touch annoying to me - others may find it less so or more so - but overall its not enough to detract from the series - yet. (I hear rumors it gets worse in later seasons).

So far I only own Season 1 and 2.  After I complete Season 2 I will assess its impact and then read reviews on Season 3 to decide if I should purchase that or not.  Note: I may or may not adjust this review after completing this Season.",1398297600,,1002,4.097435897435897

That way we can easily go back and view any shows we may have missed, or watch the shows that caught our interest.  I can watch the episodes more than once because there is so much information and very good theories that make a lot of sense. What the neatest thing is... there are NO COMMERCIALS! So we have uninterrupted shows! Love it! Highly recommend to anyone who is intrigued by ""unanswered"" mysteries... this offers other possibilities and viewpoints!  These episodes are fun to watch!  And even if you don't believe in ""aliens"", it will get you thinking more and more of what is out there, or what could be out there. Makes one think about some things, such as ""Are we really alone..."".  It makes one questions their beliefs, it questions the bible, it questions religion and at the same time it explains a lot of things that are questioned (something like big bang theory vs creation vs evolution).  Makes one broaden their ""thinking"" horizons, yet doesn't tell one they have to change what they themselves believe.

4429932,5,B004MCGNSU,"Some people will find the fact that extraterrestrials visited the earth in the past and gave humankind technology, religion and culture a bit discomfiting.  However, it is a fascinating theory that can't be overlooked.  After all, the show does ask some pretty open ended questions.  There are things that have been lost to time and history, there are a lot of cultures that mainstream science, geology and archaeologists claim have no knowledge of each other, yet they  have very similar ideas in regards to religion, architecture, and legends.  There are even some mainstream archaeologists out there who admit that extra terrestrials are probably a better explanation than any, but they'll never publicly admit to it.  This is a  show that will be enjoyed by people who loved Erich Von Daniken's ""Chariots of the Gods"" book series (he makes cameo appearances in most of the episodes from time to time), and older shows like ""In Search Of"" and ""Ripley's Believe It Or Not"" (The Jack Palance version), and anyone who has an open mind.  And not only that, but it has Giorgio A. Tsoukalos, that guy with the famously fluffy coif...that Einsteinesque hair of his will grab your attention and then you realize you have learned something.  He is probably the most popular panelist on the whole show,but everyone else who has contributed to it have some thought provoking things to say as well.

Von Danikin  peaked my interest with his first book and with  all the other books after that one.  I would suggest AA to anyone with a belief in UFO's and possible visits over the many centuries (or millions of years) of the past.  I am not one to spend time with religious matters, but if the Church I attended as a child had recognized the realities of the past, I would have likely become somewhat more of a believer.  The idea that the world began a little over 2000 years ago is absurd.  Even the Bible has an Old Testament.

There why, is Aliens! and I believe that is an ok answer! It is exceptionally interesting how they produce information about our ancient ancestors which I love! I think it is fabulous how intricate and intelligent our ancestors are! Is there anything to say for a fact that there is Aliens? no there is not but there is a lot of mysterious remnants left by previous humans that seems, un-explainable. It is all logical and has an answer, we just do not know it. I think to say Aliens gave them the knowledge is an insult to them and disrespectful.

I have been reading up in different places on ancients and the like. There is one common denominator with Aliens. Humans fear them and answer to them. The Aliens seem to get mentioned or interpreted as inter dimensional beings. Now days they are commonly witnessed in Unidentified Flying Objects. The witnesses are not a society or culture as once was but more so individuals and still, The tell tale of fear is instilled. I dunno what is going on but by the looks of things these beings are not from Space. Witnesses are paralysed when they see them. I have heard of this paralysis before, occurring to the sober.

It will steer you further to hit the internet and check out Prodject Camelot with Kerry Cassisdy's interviews with high ranking whistleblowers; then onto Educating Humanity with constant updates; then to Exopolitics for a rude awakening about the false flags performed by our government. After about 2 months, you will be fully aware of what's really going on and when certain things start happening down the road, you'll already be one step ahead and ready.

Even worse the people involved  simply lie about their supposed proof. Not stretch the truth, not speculate, out and out lie. I've never watched such utter nonsense before from a channel that is supposed to be about History, ugh. It's infuriating to me that people buy into this bunk. Especially when people have figured out how many of the ancients actually built their temples, etc. For example the Egyptians cut blocks of granite using toothless saws & sand as the cutting abrasive instead of teeth on the saw. No lasers were used, no aliens with secret technology were consulted. Not a real scientist is interviewed either, one guy had a PHD in extraterrestrial investigation or some such foolishness. Probably from a University he invented too. NONE of the claims of ancient peoples being visited by aliens are backed up with anything approaching facts either. The best argument is ""there's no way the ancient peruvians could have done this. The only explanation is that aliens were involved."" Um no, for examples concerning the Nazca lines the culture of the people who built the lines is ignored. Instead you have ignorant jerks from elsewhere claiming the lines are guide lines for spacecraft landings and that the top of the mountain has been sheared off. No, the mountain is a plateau. And what aliens would need miles long runways or guides when they can easily traverse interstellar space? Their proof consist of that they look like runways, they must be runways! Yay! In actuality the lines are about religion involving the desire for water and crops, not aliens. Erick Van Danniken makes the idiotic claim that the space craft made the lines when they landed. UGGGHHH!!! He contradicts himself on this point as well. If you want to see a complete debunking of this garbage, go to YouTube and search for Ancient Aliens Debunked. Seriously, the truth is SO much more interesting than this drivel. Don't be a sucker, don't be a tool, don't buy this crap. The truth is so much more interesting.",1352505600,2,2158,4.880108991825613

4429981,5,B004MCGNSU,"After seeing ANGELS AND ALIENS, it's become clearer that ancient mysteries are solved with what we have received from The Urantia Book. In fact regarding the Fallen Angels is written:

""PAPER 53 - THE LUCIFER REBELLION

Lucifer was a brilliant primary Lanonandek Son of Nebadon. He had experienced service in many systems, had been a high counselor of his group, and was distinguished for wisdom, sagacity, and efficiency. Lucifer was number 37 of his order, and when commissioned by the Melchizedeks, he was designated as one of the one hundred most able and brilliant personalities in more than seven hundred thousand of his kind. From such a magnificent beginning, through evil and error, he embraced sin and now is numbered as one of three System Sovereigns in Nebadon who have succumbed to the urge of self and surrendered to the sophistry of spurious personal liberty--rejection of universe allegiance and disregard of fraternal obligations, blindness to cosmic relationships.

In the universe of Nebadon, the domain of Christ Michael, there are ten thousand systems of inhabited worlds. In all the history of Lanonandek Sons, in all their work throughout these thousands of systems and at the universe headquarters, only three System Sovereigns have ever been found in contempt of the government of the Creator Son.""

So here we have that in fact, in ancient times we were visited by extraterrestrials, and that there are millions of inhabited worlds, but certainly the story written in Urantia Book is quite different from that one of History Channel and the theorists of the extraterrestrial hypothesis, and one point is that our combustion bodies cannot travel at such velocities necessary for space travel, something we know too from the scientific point of view.

On the other hand the ""fallen angel"" that was our sovereign in the ancient past and who participated in the Lucifer Rebellion is still around here, quite interested in such theories such as the ""extraterrestrial hypothesis"" as presented in this DVD, as his life feeds from our own confusion.

Well just want to share another interesting story from The Urantia Book that might be interesting for ""mating"" God & Aliens:

5. ADAMSON AND RATTA
Having delineated the Nodite antecedents of the ancestry of the secondary midwayers, this narrative should now give consideration to the Adamic half of their ancestry, for the secondary midwayers are also the grandchildren of Adamson, the first-born of the violet race of Urantia.

Adamson was among that group of the children of Adam and Eve who elected to remain on earth with their father and mother. Now this eldest son of Adam had often heard from Van and Amadon the story of their highland home in the north, and sometime after the establishment of the second garden he determined to go in search of this land of his youthful dreams.

Adamson was 120 years old at this time and had been the father of thirty-two pure-line children of the first garden. He wanted to remain with his parents and assist them in upbuilding the second garden, but he was greatly disturbed by the loss of his mate and their children, who had all elected to go to Edentia along with those other Adamic children who chose to become wards of the Most Highs.

Adamson would not desert his parents on Urantia, he was disinclined to flee from hardship or danger, but he found the associations of the second garden far from satisfying. He did much to forward the early activities of defense and construction but decided to leave for the north at the earliest opportunity. And though his departure was wholly pleasant, Adam and Eve were much grieved to lose their eldest son, to have him go out into a strange and hostile world, as they feared, never to return.

A company of twenty-seven followed Adamson northward in quest of these people of his childhood fantasies. In a little over three years Adamson's party actually found the object of their adventure, and among these people he discovered a wonderful and beautiful woman, twenty years old, who claimed to be the last pure-line descendant of the Prince's staff. This woman, Ratta, said that her ancestors were all descendants of two of the fallen staff of the Prince. She was the last of her race, having no living brothers or sisters. She had about decided not to mate, had about made up her mind to die without issue, but she lost her heart to the majestic Adamson. And when she heard the story of Eden, how the predictions of Van and Amadon had really come to pass, and as she listened to the recital of the Garden default, she was encompassed with but a single thought--to marry this son and heir of Adam. And quickly the idea grew upon Adamson. In a little more than three months they were married.

Adamson and Ratta had a family of sixty-seven children. They gave origin to a great line of the world's leadership, but they did something more. It should be remembered that both of these beings were really superhuman. Every fourth child born to them was of a unique order. It was often invisible. Never in the world's history had such a thing occurred. Ratta was greatly perturbed--even superstitious--but Adamson well knew of the existence of the primary midwayers, and he concluded that something similar was transpiring before his eyes. When the second strangely behaving offspring arrived, he decided to mate them, since one was male and the other female, and this is the origin of the secondary order of midwayers. Within one hundred years, before this phenomenon ceased, almost two thousand were brought into being.

Pseudoscience is a claim or belief that lacks supporting evidence, cannot be reliably tested, or is otherwise unprovable.  By that definition the ancient astronaut theory is pseudoscience, but so is modern sciences' interpretation of ancient civilizations.  The Ancient Aliens series simply demonstrates that mainstream history, what you're taught in school, lacks supporting evidence, cannot be reliably tested, and is indeed not always proven.  It's easy to call something pseudoscience when you're allowed to throw out any and all data that isn't rooted in the western philosophy.  Western science basically says, religion is wrong, the bible is wrong, ancient texts are wrong, Native Americans are wrong, and any idea, claim or artifact that doesn't match the current status quo is wrong.  Some of the archaeology you see in this documentary you have never seen before, never heard of before, because mainstream science cannot explain it.  The series really grinds on the fact that western science is extremely derogatory towards the history and folklore of Native cultures around the world as if these ancient stories are pure fantasy.  Although some of the evidence in the series is quite frankly outlandish, the vast majority of the information is put together very well and explained in rather simple terms.

The series explores ancient sites and monuments that I've never even heard of before, historical documents that are jaw dropping I've never seen before, and I'm a professional archaeologist!  Like the ""portal"" at Huya Marka Peru, the Hans Glaser woodcut, the underwater Japanese pyramid, and many many more.  For Example, Lovelock Cave in NV, I never knew that side of the story before, and to think the artifacts are not allowed on display at the museum and archaeologists are unwilling to study the remains further or even acknowledge what was actually found by university excavations. Fascinating!  My conclusion, as an experienced archaeologist: large portions of the ancient alien theory, regarding ancient contact with and literal creation of man, cannot be disproven.  If you believe what the ancient texts and folklore say then it most certainly is true.  But, if you're a college student looking to earn a good grade, then you best disregard these documentaries entirely.",1331251200,10,2400,5.348404255319149

This is pseudo-science but it's quite entertaining. Some of the theorists are downright sensible, and even the loony ones (including the Elvis of the aliens-have-walked-among-us crowd, Erich von Daniken) are entertainingly illogical they clearly are well-meaning (except perhaps for convicted fraudster EvD) and earnest in their beliefs. But, oh dear, do they make leaps of logic. It's very clear that many of the things posited to be ""evidence"" of past alien visitation defy the explanations proffered, given our current knowledge of history and past cultures. If you're a believer, you can sit back and enjoy confirmation of your views and bask in the glow of like minded opinion.

The research involved in providing data spanning thousands of years is first-rate.  Similar connections in ""evidence"" separated by several centuries, presented to the audience with logical hypothesis is quite fascinating.

This series will sometimes be ""reaching"" for explainations, but it truly does provide a fresh perspective.  Many religious followers will insert ""God's Will"" for unexplained events rather than accept the possibility that what they know to be God is actually an extraterrestrial being from a far advanced civilization.

There will always be sceptics, and as history proves, science will often take a back seat to political & religious ideals.  Galileo will agree with that.

4430026,5,B004MCGNSU,"This is an amazing series.  It questions nearly everything we thought we knew about ancient civilizations.  Those who view it with an open mind will learn that almost everything we have been taught has been skewed or may be outright lies about the construct of history as we know it.

Clearly, the questions raised in both of these eye-opening seasons make an incredible argument that every civilization in the ancient world which has left any known remnants, was created by use of technology far beyond the technical means of those civilizations as we have been taught.  When you look at immense neolithic structures which called for raising huge, precisely-cut stone slabs weighing hundreds of tons in some cases, you can not rationally hold on to simple-minded ideas of them being cut by hard stone against softer stone, you know we've been lied to.  When you hear the canned explanations of these gargantuan pieces being raised by wooden levers and rolled to their places on logs placed like rollers, hundreds of thousands of them in some cases, you know fantasy has been presented as truth in history.

Structures such as the pyramids in Egypt and elsewhere, engineered to such precision that today's best stone masons can't come close just crumble everything we've been told.  This, and another series called The Pyramid Code make cases for the pyramids being constructed as resonating generators for energy such as microwaves that could have powered huge prehistoric ""space stations.""  No mummies have ever been found in them and there is no evidence they were ever constructed as tombs.  They even make a cogent case for the King's Chamber in the Great Pyramid being used as a type of resonator.  Mathmatically and architecturally, this could actually make sense.

When you look at art all over the earth from ""primitive"" cultures, astronaughts or spaceman types of images abound.  I have seen rock art in Utah and Colorado that makes ""Kachinas"" appear to be no less than representations of ancient visitors.

Every hour of both seasons is worth watching multiple times if you want to really think about our cultural and even evolutionary history.  Just ponder the concept that hominids as a human-like species have been around for 300,000 year, and yet, in the past few thousand years, our brains have more than tripled in size.  It's the questions that are raised that make you question what you think or thought you knew.  If you are not bound by subjective dogma and fundamentalism, if you really want to understand who we are and how we came to be here in our current world with our science, knowledge, and abilities technologically that have come to us in the last hundred or so years, every paradigm you have ever known will be rocked.

Yes there are far-fetched ideas that really have no substantiation, but they still question ideas that really don't hold up as we have been told.

Question everything. Question the questions that are raised in this series, but if you have an open mind, I guarantee that if you do, almost everything you have been told about our technological past will crumble in the light of reason.

If you still doubt, and use arguments such as these questions lacking ""scientific proof"" I simply challenge you to offer empirical evidence that in any way disproves 90 to 95% of what is presented.

We have to go beyond what we are allowed to know.  There is so much more out there than we have been told, and so much that we have been told is simply lies, constructed to control and disinform us.

4430027,5,B004MCGNSU,"This is a most interesting series, but I believe is better seen AFTER you watch Season I.  Season I is shorter (fewer episodes) but is a great primer for Season 2.

Some of the information covered in Season I will be covered again in Season II, but not all, and there is so much information in both sets that by the time you get to Season II, rementioning it only serves as a great reminder. It's next to impossible to remember all the info presented. So . . Season I shouldn't be missed. Also, some of the presenters from Season I are not in Season II - although both sets include many different presenters.

Personally, I felt there was more time taken to produce Season I than II -- sort of like Season II was rushed into production. NONETHELESS -- this is such a great series that my husband and I have already starting watching it all over again, starting from Season I from the start. What's been most helpful to us is to take a few notes during the episodes, then spending time on the Internet reading more about the different sites and info presented.  Now, going through it again, we have a better background and can more easily understand the bigger context of what they are presenting.

4430029,3,B004MCGNSU,"First, allow me to say that I thoroughly enjoyed watching this series; for those interested in the unexplained mysteries of the ancient world, this is a must watch, but definitely bone-up on more ""academic"" explanations (i.e. other documentaries, books, wikipedia) of these phenomenon so that you have a basis of comparison for ""ancient astronaut theory."" (A quick caveat: I feel that lumping together the many thinkers and hypotheses that comprise ""ancient astronaut theory"" is problematic, in that there are in fact many nuanced and varied theories about ""ancient astronauts,"" but this oversimplifaction is largely the fault of the makers of the series. I will expand my critique of the film-makers in a moment). As an aspiring academic, I operate under the assumption that ancient texts are open for interpretation, and given that much of our ""common wisdom"" is based on modern interpretations of ancient metaphors, symbolism, allegory, etc, I was very interested to learn more about theories not covered in ""Introduction to World Civilizations."" However, despite high entertainment value, this series fell short for me, due largely to the incoherent representations of ""ancient astronaut theory.""

My main critiques with the series are:

1. Organized around events and phenomena, which resulted in a hodge-podge of different ideas and theories pertaining to one small subject at a time, leaving a disconnected mess of logic (however craftfully arranged and edited). It would have been better--and frankly more worthy of the History Channel--if they would have dedicated some time to individual theorists, who would propose their own ideas so that the viewer could understand the many DIFFERENT hypotheses about ancient astronauts. This disconnectedness really damaged the series' credibility.

2. Relatedly, the series moved too fast, and very little was satisfactorily resolved, or even discussed in great enough detail to get a handle on the viability of the evidence. For a critical (and serious) thinker, this is immensly frustrating, in that the show simply moves forward assuming the preceding evidence is true, when it is often very questionable. This also damages the credibility of the series, in that entire webs of speculation (including many compelling points, I admit) are easily discredited since they are founded on faulty, illogical claims.

3. An apparent lack of experts and/or quality interviewees damaged the credibility of the series. Though they were able to find some good interviewees (a few Phds, writers, independent researchers), over-reliance on under-credible people, like science fiction writers, owners of tourist attractions, and one particularly irritating, ""I believe everything and talk really slow to make it sound dramatic""  interviewee made me question the validity not of the theories this series discusses but rather the willingness of many credible thinkers to participate in the making of this series.

That all being said, I'm aware my objections are nit-picky, but as an educator and a citizen that appreciates coherent information and wants to see more critical thought in the world, it's disappointing that the makers of the series didn't take these things into consideration and make a much more credible documentary. But really, it was pretty good, but a little bit frustrating at times.",1308614400,17,3339,5.461240310077519
4430030,5,B004MCGNSU,"Great series that brings both the bible and evolution together.  It is funny when both sides are right and they just want to argue over semantics.  If you are critical of this theory you are a brainwashed idiot.  The proof is substantial and in some cases very obvious that there was an advanced civilization here in the past and is probably guiding us along to this day.  It all makes perfect sense when you compile all the information.  Evolution is fine until you get to homo sapien sapien then what, quick change in 10,000 years?  And if you take the bible literally with connotations of the supernatural and faith...you are a brainwashed drone incapable of understanding such things.",1308096000,,688,4.788135593220339

Like most of other History series, I can heartily recommend AA - S2 to anyone. Factual, exciting and more than a little scary!",1307577600,45,343,4.276923076923077
4430033,5,B004MCGNSU,"A great, thought provoking show.

This show explains how events may have unfolded in this distant past.

It is a journey to discover what explains many, if not all, of the human species' ancient religious texts.

/

Viewers are treated to the realistic and scientific interpretation of religious texts, instead of being subjected to the ridiculous, hilarious, childish and moronic, literal interpretation of the texts.

(That assume magic and super-powers are possible, that Angels exist, and that there's an invisible man in the sky who can see everything you do every minute of every day and has a list of 10 things he does not want you to do, etc).

/

Gods are not possible in reality.

Extraterrestrials are.

Therefore, this is definitely the leading theory to explain the origins of religious texts, why they were written - and what they are describing to the reader.

/

Whereas religions will do everything possible to stop you using your brain,  Ancient Aliens does everything it can to make you do the opposite.

The show promotes free-thinking, alternate theories, and intellectualism.

This show also provides a rough education into the ancient past, and ancient landmarks.

/

If many religious texts do describe real events, then they are describing extraterrestrials.

""Those who came down from the sky""

There you have it in one sentence.

There are no Gods.  Only extraterrestrials.",1306972800,8,1400,5.083700440528634
4430034,1,B004MCGNSU,"More deception from the serpents' mouth! The underlying goal of this series, and like the previous, is to continue (of course) the agenda of trying to undermine the Holy Scriptures. This is not the only agenda in the mainstream doing this, of of course, but BEWARE of their adding and removing from the Bible to accommodate their ""Aliens"" views, which is nothing but the fallen angels the Bible briefly points-out.",1305676800,10,414,4.928571428571429
4430035,5,B004MCGNSU,I've been watching this series for a while and also bought season 1.  I couldn't stop watching and I can understand fearful people saying this is not proof since they might want to make this alien reality go away with their denial.  Forget the fearful hollywood movies and the government cover-ups which are the seeds in your mind that make all of this fearful.  Why would aliens want the negative for us rather than the positive?  They would have blown us up a long time ago if that was their intention.,1304985600,3,504,4.5054945054945055
4430036,5,B004MCGNSU,"Ancient Aliens is one of the hottest new shows around as it explores a different view of ancient history. This history is basically interpreting gods as extraterrestrials, after all every god in major ancient mythologies from Zeus, Krishna, all the way to the Bible's god. The question is: Were these flying chariots really ufo's seen by technologically unadvanced people and thought to be gods? I believe this is the case.

Instead of being an hour and a half as season 1 was of Ancient Aliens, each episode is now about 50 minutes, but each time I still can't help but smile as the evidence is piled on so much that skeptics really don't have a leg to stand on.
