2205049,5,B00078FAKK,"Anthony Hamilton's live show according to his new companion DVD to his debut album, ""Comin' From Where I'm From"" is a wonderful gem for any listener to dance, listen, reflect, and ultimately relate. Every segment of this album beginning with his journey from start to finish is flawless. With the moving aura of a young Donny Hathaway and sincere lyrical content equally as gripping as the great Bill Withers, Hamilton's story from his perspective is not only believable but highly motivating. It was great to know that growing up in Charlotte, NC, he participated in numerous talent shows, actually lived through poverty and finally got his break when Jermaine Dupri signed him to So So Def Entertainment. The soul artist's chronicle gets deeper when we meet his mother in the ""Mama Knew Love"" scene. Also, another standout performance is the interpretation of the song ""I Tried,"" which embodies a resung gospel element from one of his many influences, Joe Ligon of the Mighty Clouds of Joy. He inherits Ligon's compelling rifts when he sings, ""I been in the storm too long,"" equating a lost love to an horrific affair with the rain. Vivid and real. Overall, this DVD is a winner. I look forward to seeing and hearing more from Anthony Hamilton, his powerhouse band spearheaded by musical director, David Balfour, and for Mr. Hamilton, continue to win hearts by staying true to the values that make this debut work a southern masterpiece. SANG BOY!!!",1123632000,10,1451,4.926530612244898

2205051,4,B00078FAKK,"when first hearing about this, i thought it would be a live cd. after seeing this brother perform in person, i couldn't wait to get at this. Anthony Hamilton gives off a lot of energy when performing. so what a surprise i got when this turned out to be a Live DVD.....on the DVD, a live performance (in Atlanta)is intertwined with clips of Anthony visiting his hometown of Charlotte, NC. the live performance is hot, again Anthony Hamilton lays his soul out during the performance. but its the glimpse into the personal life of Anthony that makes this DVD more entertaining....we get to meet Anthony's parents, childhood friends and hear stories as he struggled to get his music off the ground. for example, i didn't know that Anthony had been signed to FOUR major label deals before releasing Comin' From Where Im From....

the bonus cd is kewl....the live versions of Charlene and Comin' From Where I'm From are NOT the versions on the live DVD...but are still hot!!

the only thing stoppin me from making this DVD a 5 star joint is that the flashbacks should have been seprate from the concert footage. it slowed the enjoyment of the concert to me....I also thought a live cd to go along with the DVD would have been nice as well. but i still enjoyed it.

Having roots from NC I was proud as I watched how despite his fame, Anthony never forgot family and home... the scene with his mom and the other ladies in the dry cleaners just showed his true self...somebody who just loves what they do and would honor a request just to make someone else feel good. Honestly, this whole dvd made me feel good.
