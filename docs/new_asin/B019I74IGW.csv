This one was good but not great. Beautiful scenery, poignant images of the indigent. Good acting from the lead. Bruno, the son, was a treat to watch and intriguing to look at. Story was suspenseful but the ending was a let down.",1461024000,2,304,4.169491525423729

7575872,4,B019I74IGW,"Great visuals, the architecture of the city is beautifully shown, smooth cinematic camera moves and wonderful compositions.  Awesome performances especially from the boy whose expressive face broke my heart a couple of times.  Not a particularly strong narrative structure, but I didn't expect that since the film is an example of neo-realism.  Overall, a very good film though perhaps not the masterpiece some people call it.
The strong simple premise, the search for a stolen bike the main character needs in order to make a living, holds up wonderfully. It's not just a possession, it's a crucial instrument he needs so he can feed his family.  Though this is a serious film, it was the inspiration for the basic plot of Pee Wee's Big Adventure.  The  reason I watched it was because I read it was one of Mel Brook's favorite films.",1473033600,,835,4.845070422535211

7575875,1,B019I74IGW,"My wife had to watch this movie for a film class. We barely made it through this movie. The end was so anticlimactic we thought maybe we missed some of it, but no that is how bad it was.",1469836800,,186,3.7948717948717947
7575876,5,B019I74IGW,This is an all time great with a cast made up of ordinary people and not 'stars'. De Sicaa's masterpiece for world cinema.,1469232000,,122,4.3478260869565215
7575877,5,B019I74IGW,"One of the best-known of all the Italian neo-realist thrillers emerging out of the Second World War and beyond, LADRI DI BICICLETTE has a straightforward plot of Ricci, a working-class man (Lamberto Maggiorani) who finds a job as a bill-poster, buys a bicycle and embarks on his task. On his first day the bicycle is stolen, and together with son Bruno (Enzo Staiola), he spends the rest of the film unsuccessfully trying to find it.

The simple plot cannot describe the experience of watching Vittorio de Sica's film, whose unforgettable black-and-white photography (by Carlo Montuori) captures a postwar Italy trying to re-establish itself in the wake of a catastrophic war (as signaled by the tower- blocks dotted across the landscape), yet simultaneously experiencing chronic problems of poverty and unemployment. Ricci has to join the daily queue of men hoping for a job from an unscrupulous clerk (Gino Saltamerenda), with no real prospect of permanent positions. As he visits the bill-posting office to receive the posters, the camera focuses on the clerks, who seem to be dealing with piles of paperwork to little or no effect. They are not actually producing anything, but simply working for the sake of working, to avoid Ricci's fate. The same also applies to the officers in the police station, who choose to spend time on clerical duties rather than actively trying to catch criminals.

Ricci lives in a cramped couple of rooms with his wife (Lianella Carell) and their young baby. Once again de Sica captures the almost daily sufferings they experience: Maria has to put meals on the table on very little money, while having to cope with the chores of washing, ironing and child-rearing in one room, relying totally on any income Ricci can bring in.

This explains Ricci's mental sufferings, once his bicycle has been stolen by a petty thief (Vittorio Antonucci). The film is full of tracking sequences as he walks along peopled streets, devoid of cars, his face framed in close-up as he makes his futile attempts to find it. Bruno tags along behind him, experiencing equal sufferings, especially in a high-class pizza restaurant where his raggedy clothes are contrasted with those of a high-class child sitting behind him, savoring the delights of a calzone and staring loftily at Bruno.

Eventually matters come to a heartbreaking climax where the hitherto morally impeccable Ricci is forced into a criminal act. The resultant shame, as he is surrounded by a crowd of indignant bystanders, proves too much for Bruno, as he walks away, his face filled with tears, with his father desperately trying and failing to console him. Once Ricci had been a person to look up to; for Bruno his father is now nothing more than a common felon. Yet we realize that this is not Ricci's fault; it is something that he was forced into by adverse circumstances.

Only eighty minutes in length - on the DVD release - LADRI DI BICILIETTE is so powerful in terms of visual impact that it demands the viewer's attention. It is quite deservedly one of the established classics of world cinema.",1468713600,2,3086,4.94980694980695
7575878,4,B019I74IGW,"Good movie about this family man trying to get a job in post war Rome and having his bicycle stolen.  Nothing overly dramatic, but a good movie.",1468540800,,144,4.333333333333333
7575879,4,B019I74IGW,Good copy of an old film.  Then ending left me wanting.  Didn't like the ending.,1468368000,,80,4.266666666666667
7575880,4,B019I74IGW,"It was interesting to view this old, black and white movie.  Language in Italian, but the closed captioning was good.  Probably not for everyone, but it held my interest. Filmed in what appears to be a real town with real people, this film is a quiet departure from the movies of today.",1467417600,2,286,4.480769230769231
7575881,5,B019I74IGW,"Best marks for production, directing and acting. A superb motion picture but as the Era requires, all together depressing.",1467244800,,122,5.473684210526316
7575882,5,B019I74IGW,"During postwar Italy a man seeks a job with great desperation and dire need, to support his family. When he finds one, he needs a bicycle to keep it. In one of those great subtle moments of this fantastic movie, his wife finds the resources to buy him one. Then in a split moment, the bicycle is stolen. The film has an incredible human voice projected into stunning scenes. Arthur Miller, said it best; Its as if the soul of man had been filmed. In my words; the soul of the creator of this film, reached out with spiritual abandon.",1466467200,,533,4.34
7575883,5,B019I74IGW,One of the best films of all time. Restoration and extras are invaluable.,1462924800,,73,4.6923076923076925
7575884,5,B019I74IGW,"Bought this blindly based upon suggestions from Home Theater Forum members.  I went into this film with high expectations.  It did not disappoint.

Very enjoyable film.  I think what I most enjoyed about BICYCLE THIEVES was that nothing in this film seemed like it was being acted -- from the actors themselves to everything that was going on in the background.  It was a great little story that brought out the hardships of being able to obtain a job during an era filled with poverty, and once employment is obtained, the grief of losing the most valued possession in your life.

Most of the film is dominated with searching....whether it be for a bicycle or an old man.  While the search becomes a tedious focal point of the film, it's interesting to watch the characters involved, particularly the lead character's son, Bruno.

The Blu-ray transfer is immaculate, as you would expect from Criterion.  The only flaws I see in the print are the scene transitions which look rough, but certainly not a problem to the point where it takes the viewer away from immersion of the story.

A great film?  No.  Worthy of a purchase?  Absolutely, if you can get it during a Criterion sale.  I would have preferred to pay $20 for this instead of $28.  Still, consider me to be a happy camper.",1462924800,8,1284,4.644444444444445

8745331,2,B019I74IGW,"From reviews on every movie critic website, this movie is praised for many reasons. I can see that this movie would have been ground-breaking in the 40s and so deserves praise for it's time. For avid movie historians, I'm sure it is interesting. I found the plight of post WWII Italians, and the scenery of the time, interesting. We enjoyed the actor who played Bruno. Past that, my husband and I found the movie dull, and I would have opted out of watching it.",1507420800,,461,4.5

It was very tough to see how desolate and bomb crumbled that Rome and its people had become as part of that war.

I'm am grateful for this wonderful and enlightening, though somewhat depressing, historical look.",1479168000,3,306,4.527272727272727
