545971,3,6303046495,"Like many of the 50's horror sci-fi films this one is ""done in"" by silliness and cheap production. The premise is interesting but, the results are unintentionally funny at times. I read a review on this film from someone who stated that Hollywood needs to remake pictures like this instead of really good films. I think he or she has a valid point. These films would be welcome to remakes with so much room for improvement. This film is one of five on volume 2 of The Ultimate Sci-Fi classic collection. The DVD transfer is very good. I would not hesitate to buy this set as the first set is OOP already and fetching a hefty sum on the secondary market.",1192665600,,653,4.404958677685951
545972,5,6303046495,"those of us who grew up watching these grade-b horror flicks from the 50's can appreciate this one for its uniqueness,  and really not so bad acting.  it does have some social commentary,  and the exotic locale--whether stock footage or not--lends a great deal of creepiness to the whole experience.  no, folks,  it aint gone with the wind,  but for a grade-b horror flick from 1960,  it is one of the very best----ever!!!",1164585600,3,422,4.698630136986301
545973,1,6303046495,"ANY movie that has a scene with a guy making out with a grandma should be banned.  Gross.

The whole movie is disgusting in general.  It's about a woman who discovers a cure for old age in Africa.  But the cure only lasts for a day, and it must be mixed with the juice of a freshly killed person for it to work at all.  So for the woman to stay alive and young, she must continually kill, and THAT'S why she's called the leech woman.  She leeches off of others to retain her youth.  It's actually a good plot, but the movie is so disgusting I have a hard time watching it.

I've seen plenty of movies worse than this one, but I haven't seen many grosser than this.",1156464000,,664,4.053846153846154
545974,2,6303046495,"The MST3K episode was great, as we all know, but the movie itself is actually (and I don't say this often) not too bad. It does have some good messages, but doesn't make full use of them.
The idea that society finds middle aged women to be hateful and deserving of death because of their lack of beauty is a good observation, but the movie also seems to support this idea by making the titular Leech Woman a villain, along with Mala, who also attains youth through killing. Old women are evil, as Mike says at the very end.
I thought that Coleen Gray was quite good in her middle-aged role, she brought a real heaviness to her role. Rare in an MST3K movie, I actually enjoy her performance up till the point when she gets young. After that she loses something. She becomes a different character, just as Mala does, somebody less compelling. I didn't like Ms. Gray at all in Phantom Planet, for the same reason. She doesn't make a good temptress. Perhaps she tries too hard. But she seems very natural in her role here as a very lonely and self-loathing middle aged wife whose husband never loved her.",1083024000,4,1100,4.4504950495049505
545975,3,6303046495,"You have to realize that movies like ""The Leech Woman"" and ""The Wasp Woman"" were not meant to be taken seriously since they were made mainly for the Drive-in-circuit.  The wasp mask Susan Cabot had to wear, in 1959, was tight and fitted to the back of her neck with glue.  During the climax she was really hurt when Zinthrop throws the ""break-away"" acid jar at her face. The acid smoke-effects nearly suffocated her because there was no open mouth area, just two little holes in the nose area. When she fell out the window she had to enlist the men who caught her to help take off the mask and as a result, took off a bit of neck skin as well!  So, the mask was not a bad mask since it was so form fitting, like a second skin, and very painful!",1056931200,2,744,4.152777777777778
545976,3,6303046495,"Instead of remaking good movies, Hollywood really needs to take B-movies that are filled with great ideas but fail to live up to their potential because of time and money.  There's just a goldmine of movies out there waiting to be tapped, and THE LEECH WOMAN is one such movie.  Think about it.  With the advent of the usually anorexic supermodels, this movie seems to apply to our society now more than ever.  LEECH WOMAN could've made for some dead-on social commentary, and to a certain extent, it does.  All of the characters, however, become completely unlikable, taking away from its impact.  Instead, the message comes out as ""Everyone is a scumbag or psychotic.""  The relationships between the two couples (doctor and Leech Woman, their layer and his girlfriend) aren't fleshed out enough, so you don't really see how the two women are driven to violence.  I mean, it's easy enough when you see how they are treated to sympathize with them, but their reactions are too extreme and absolutely unnecessary, which makes them look psychotic.  And of course, all of the men in this movie are scumbags.  The movie does hit the right beats on occasion, and it certainly is memorable (e.g., the pineal ring).  In short, a great premise turned into a depressing movie due to missed potential and likable characters made so unlikable then given pretty terrible fates.",1055980800,6,1365,4.865800865800866
545977,5,6303046495,"With a title like this, what would you expect? Please don't take it too seriously. It's just a real good ""B"" melodrama typical of the l950's. A rejuvenation secret prompts a desperate quest into darkest Africa to find a bizarre youth serum and something else...The realities and hurt of a bitter love story and the perils and unfairness of aging are presented in an entertaining few minutes. The old African lady, played to the hilt by Estelle Hemley,declares, ""You are the one in my dreams of blood."" And she delivers under the most horrendous circumstances. Take it for the fun of it. The star, Colleen Gray, is exceptionally good in a most unattractive and beautiful role, and this fine veteran actress delivers it with sympathy and great energy. No small feat. All women should cheer; there is substance here.",1011052800,16,813,4.856115107913669

7836068,4,6303046495,"Its a misery getting old.  For reasons never fully explained, an old woman (Estelle Hemsley as Malla) travels to America to tease an endocrinologist (Phillip Terry as Dr. Talbot) with the secret of eternal youth.  A secret she has no intention of giving out.  Just the same, the bad doctor and his despondent wife (Coleen Gray as June) travel to Africa in hot pursuit of the old woman.  When they find her they get more than they bargained for as no one is happy to see them.  For a hoot, Malla makes old June young and attractive for awhile, with the promise shell be killed later, enjoy!  June and her wily guide put TNT to good use then get lost in the jungle.  Sadly, morning brings with it a bad case of old and uglier and the sneaky guide has the secret stuff to make June pretty again, however fleeting.  If it wasn't for a well placed patch of quicksand this movie would have been over sooner rather than later.  But.  The guide doesnt barter well and June reaches America as a whole new woman.  Suddenly, her lawyer (Grant Williams as Neil Foster) is looking mighty fine.  So what if hes engaged to Sally (Gloria Talbot), a minor setback at best.  Theres just one teensy little problem with the beauty treatment, part of the ingredients is provided from the pineal gland of men, mixed with orchid pollen.  And.  Theres one minor drawback to this, it kills the unsuspecting donor.  Then what do you do when the bodies start to pile up.  Its not as if theres a take-out service for that sort of thing.

Yes, its a silly premise.  No, it doesnt make sense.  But it is unintentionally funny and therefore highly entertaining.",1496880000,,1630,4.498293515358362

7836071,2,6303046495,"The Leech Woman, 1959 film

An old woman visits an endocrinologist; she is his wife and drinks a lot. They argue. Then a very old woman enters this doctors office. Can she be over 140 years old? She offers her story to Dr. Paul Talbot. She has a drug that keeps her alive and young. She demonstrates the effects! Drinking affects Mrs. Talbots looks and personality. Dr. Talbot wants June to come with him to Africa and search for this wonder drug. But these natives hate Europeans. Paul hires a guide. They will try to catch up to that old woman. June and Paul continue their conflicts. June runs off into the jungle, alone. Will a lion get her? A good guy with a gun saves her. Later they meet Malla. She tells them the secret: pollen from an orchid is the drug.

Malla tells about the fate of the old woman. She takes that drug and turns into a young woman! But it needs the life of a man. June is offered the drug, but she must chose the sacrificial man. It is Paul. The guide takes sticks of dynamite when he goes to retrieve a gold necklace. June looks twenty years younger! Will it last long? Explosions allow them to escape! Crocodiles prevent them from crossing the river; they must travel north by land. The next morning June has aged again. The story continues back in the states. June finds another man (he was after her jewelry). Police detectives arrive to question June about the murder of that con man. June runs upstairs for another dose of that drug. But it doesnt work as before! The police break down the door to find a very old and dead woman.

This seems like a variation on those vampire movies where a supernatural being must find victims to extend his life. This story uses science as a means to rejuvenate a woman, but it cant be repeated forever. Was it meant as a symbol for a system where some are exploited to benefit others? This low-budget movie is worth watching once, if you have the time. Leeches were once used to rid a body of blood as a cure for sickness (the humoral theory). In some cases they are used to remove excess blood from damaged tissue. The name Talbot and an orchid as a cure came from some old werewolf films form the 1930's.",1466294400,,2176,4.367901234567901

7836075,3,6303046495,"I actually watch this on DVD as part of a set. They must have remasterd the film as it is not scratchy or blurry. Parts of the film are really steamy in more ways than one.

Dr. Paul Talbot (Phillip Terry) is working on an anti-aging formula. On the side he wants to dump his older aging wife (Coleen Gray.) That is until he needs her to help with his experiment.

We get an African experience of the jungle Jim type. Wild animals, lots of dancing, and many secrets. Looks like they may become native-chow.

By the way Gloria Talbott plays doctor's assistant. You cannot miss her from 26 films and 81 T.V. appearances. I remember her best in ""Perry Mason"" (1957 TV series).

7836076,5,6303046495,"This highly under-rated film is one of my old favorites, an item which turned up on TV horror host shows in the 1970s.  It's interesting for several reasons:

""The Leech Woman"" was absolutely the last of the horror films of old Universal or Universal-International.  After a string of popular '50s films like ""Creature From the Black Lagoon,"" ""This Island Earth"" and many others, the sci-fi/horror cycle was perceived as over by 1960.

The film features an outstanding performance by Colleen Gray, who was an ingenue in the 1940s and continued acting into the 1970s.  Ms. Gray was expert and playing either sympathetic or bitchy types and she combines both aspects in her role here.  Another 1940s veteran, Phillip Terry (Joan Crawford's ex), plays her rotten, heartless hubby.  Few actors can pull this off without being either scary or laughable.  Gray and Terry's hilariously mean-spirited scenes together are clearly played for tongue in cheek fun and both skillfully avoid overdoing it.

Estelle Hemsley as ""Old Malla"", Gloria Talbott as the nurse and Grant Williams as the lawyer each turn in excellent performances as well.  There are other pleasures, including scenes filmed in a gorgeous and rare 1958/59 Chrysler convertible.

High point: Artificially aged June must make herself young and gorgeous again for her big date with her lawyer boyfriend.  Needing a pineal donor, she puts on her best furs & jewels, then goes slumming in search of a gigolo.  She finds one (Arthur Batanides) and goes for a drive with him, knowing he'll try to rob her or worse.  Their dialogue, as he ogles her expensive accessories and prepares to kill her, is absolutely priceless.

The charcoal cinematography is clear and rich, the music is good and the plot, though grim, is interesting and original.  The special effects makeup for ""aging"" June are quite good and when I first saw the film as a child I gasped at the big reveal of just how much June had aged...just as the producers intended.

Highly recommended for lovers of offbeat vintage sci fi and horror; or lovers of attractive hairstyles, clothes and cars.  Two thumbs up.",1318291200,4,2125,4.971671388101983
