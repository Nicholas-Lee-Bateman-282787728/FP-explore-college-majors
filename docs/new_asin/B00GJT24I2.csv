8623872,3,B00GJT24I2,"Among the volumes of action movie packages released in the last several years, this is one of the more eclectic. Chuck Norris and Steven Seagal are regular names in these compilations but how the heck that fifth one ended up in there is anyone's guess.

The three Norris features share the common theme of Chuck playing a mentor to younger costars: he teaches Eddie Cibrian to be a soldier and kill mobsters in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Logan-s-War-Bound-by-Honor/dp/B001GM6C4Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Logan's War: Bound by Honor</a>&nbsp;and then teaches both&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dylan-Neal/dp/B0001Z3TSO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dylan Neal</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Judson-Mills/dp/B00025I6ZY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Judson Mills</a>&nbsp;(both playing the same character) to be a secret agent-y ""President's man."" He's more of supporting character in that first one, but in all movies he still shows up his younger comrades with the better fight scenes, albeit in limited numbers. Among these three, ""A Line in the Sand"" is definitely the best.

Steven Seagal is both a different style and generation of action hero, but his&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Driven-to-Kill/dp/B001VFM0YC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Driven to Kill</a>&nbsp;still fits in the package. Younger than Norris by twelve years, Seagal actually comes across as older than him but nonetheless delivers a surprisingly good action outing. While Chuck blatantly played to American patriotism, Steven assumes the role of a Russian ex-gangster taking on the mafiosos who attacked his family. Both the fistfights and shootouts are brutal and satisfying, and the ample Russian dialogue gives the film a unique tone.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/L-A-Street-Fighters/dp/B00005QJJR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">L.A. Street Fighters</a>&nbsp;is the inharmonious final ingredient to the package, though it's not all bad as a movie. Noticeably older and cheaper than the other films, it nonetheless features a supergroup of martial arts stars, including Philip Rhee, James Lew, Bill Wallace, and Jun Chong (forty years old at the time and playing a high schooler). At best, the fight scenes are very good and much more athletic than anything Norris or Seagal offer, but the shadowy production values and uncoordinated storyline make for a movie that just not very compelling.

If taken for face value as a random jumble of action movies from different eras, this one's pretty good. However, there's no guarantee that Chuck Norris fans are going to be fans of Steven Seagal and LASF seems like it belongs in a different collection altogether. I don't recommend this one over many other sets.",1395273600,,2908,6.644736842105263
