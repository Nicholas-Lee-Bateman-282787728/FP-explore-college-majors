8517005,4,B007I1Q4RC,"Bring out complete seasons of this series and you will get my money, but I will not be nickel and dimed to death just to own something that you want to spoon feed to the public so you can make more money.  NOT RECOMMENDED until entire season sets are available.

Updated 03/24/13:  Hey, what do you know.  Someone listened for a change.  The complete season 2 of this series is available April 23.  I will be buying it and I have adjusted my review rating accordingly because I very much like this series.",1359676800,5,505,4.376344086021505
8517006,3,B007I1Q4RC,"two problems:
1 - you can't get all of season 2 on one disc yet, so each volume only has 6 episodes, and only 2 volumes available (as of 12/12)
2 - Season 2, IMHO, is not as good as 1.  We miss the adventures in the search for the Makluan (sp?) rings.  This season has a completely different feel.  It's not that it's bad, it's just missing a particular element of fun that we were enjoying in Season 1.

Also, our kids are on the younger side (K/1st grade) and Season 2 is ""older,"" more scary stuff, more intense action, situations they don't really get, etc.  The bad guy action is much more pronounced.  We severely limit their watch time of this.",1357603200,3,650,4.2439024390243905
8517007,5,B007I1Q4RC,Hey I like it and that's all your going to get unless you have to put in more words which is rediculous!,1353888000,,104,3.772727272727273
8517008,5,B007I1Q4RC,"I love this series almost as much as I love the character of Iron Man. I have been a fan of this series since it began and a fan of the comic even further back than this! The series brings some of the best of the comics together in one place. The series is high paced, action packed, and will keep you on the edge of your seat and definitely engaged throughout all of the episodes, or at least it did for me! For the true fan, you will find some differences in this series than just in the comics, but for me that was ok, as it still brought to the screen a great character with great plot, action and artistry!",1339113600,,611,4.016393442622951
8517009,2,B007I1Q4RC,I just rewatched the first season on netflix. Just rent on netflix type of service till they supply a completed season box set for a reasonable price. I didn't realize there was a second season produced. But I really enjoyed the series so far. The fullscreen option is dated and unnecessary for something originally produced in widescreen.,1337990400,6,339,4.964912280701754
