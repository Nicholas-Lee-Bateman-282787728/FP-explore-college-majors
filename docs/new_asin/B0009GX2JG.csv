2290074,3,B0009GX2JG,"Floor Elevators? I know it is always debateable as to who coined the term psychedelic and who was the first ""psychedelic"" band. I don't know for sure. History is fickle at best in this area, but I do think that in any psychedelic movie the Elevators should certainly at least be mentioned, as well as some other bands of the era...but it is always the Grateful Dead, Big Brother, Quicksilver, and the San Francisco bands that are mentioned. Don't get me wrong. They belong there and I still enjoy their music--especially Quicksilver's--but where are Roky Erikson and the Thirteenth Floor Elevators?",1142380800,8,598,4.930693069306931
2290075,4,B0009GX2JG,"This DVD explored the history of the Red Dog Saloon. It is a documentary of the origins of the Haight-Ashbury cultural scene, not early footages of the rock bands. It never was marketed as such. ""Featuring music by ..."", not ""full concert footage by ...."" If you want a Grateful Dead show, buy one. There are plenty. This DVD doesn't claim to be one, so if you thought it was when you bought it, you need to read to more carefully next time.

As a documentary, it features interviews with the owners, bartenders, cook, et al., all the people who made the Saloon, and eventually the Haight. All insightful and entertaining.

Of course the Charlatans figured an important part of the DVD; they were an important part of the Saloon and its history. Not the Dead. Not Quicksilver. Not the Airplane.

It dragged toward the end, and I could have done without the current music performances, and would have prefered more

of the personal videos and photographs (if there were anymore), and more about the 2nd and 3rd tiered groups.

A fascinating documentary it is (for those interested in the history of the San Francisco rock scene). A video full of early performances it's not.",1140652800,34,1173,4.702439024390244
2290076,3,B0009GX2JG,"This was very interesting from a historical perspective of the psychedelic movement in San Francisco, and how the original Family Dog started.  Great clips of some of the favorite old bands of the era, but I would have liked more.  Some of the interviews seemed long and rambling without much insight, just a lot of reminiscing about people that may not have been included in the film.  All in all, worthwhile watching for anyone interested in the history of these exciting, definitive times.",1140393600,6,492,4.903614457831325
2290077,1,B0009GX2JG,I was stunned to see how little footage of any of the bands there was on this DVD especially after the description touted them so much. It's an ok documentary of that time but the way it is being marketed borders on misrepresentation. If you want to see or hear these bands go elsewhere. Very disappointing.,1129334400,36,307,4.5
2290078,1,B0009GX2JG,"I got this thinking I was going to see some early footage of the Grateful Dead, wrong got 30 seconds of background music. This was made only for the folks who worked at the Red dog and dropped acid there. I was not impressed with this. That worthless left wing propaganda rag called the rolling stone said it was great, save your money, get a Grateful Dead CD. This was a real bore.

2290079,1,B0009GX2JG,"I watched this DVD waiting to see the Dead and Quicksilver to show up and guess what?-they're not in it!  To even attempt to tie this DVD to the music scene in SF is outrageous.  So if you want to start a bar out in the country and get one band to play there, buy this.  If you want to see the DEAD-get their DVD, if you want to see QMS-get John Cippolina's tape, JA-get their DVD, etc.  But don't buy this one.  I watched the SF genre develop and kept hearing about THE CHARLATANS and couldn't understand why they didn't ""break out"" nationally.  This tells me why.  They just were not good.  If you want to ""hear"" the true spirit of SF, buy the first MOBY GRAPE album (CD).  It has all you need to hear.",1125964800,48,704,4.08029197080292
2290080,4,B0009GX2JG,"""Rockin' at the Red Dog"" is a well made documentary on the beginnings of the San Francisco psychedelic music/art scene that would eventually sweep the country (and the world) and have repercussions lasting for decades. The interviews with those involved are entertaining and insightful. However, I did have some small qualms; the packaging would lead one to believe that there is a lot of Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane, etc. in the film when they are only mentioned briefly and there are no live performances by those bands. This is primarily about the Charlatans, a seminal SF band, and there isn't really much footage of them in existence to show. It would have been nice to have seen them playing live in their (very short) heyday, as well as some of the other SF garage bands briefly glimpsed in the film. Still, I recommend ""Rockin"" to those interested in rock history/evolution. Deadheads looking for concert footage will be disappointed.",1124668800,15,948,5.006329113924051
2290081,5,B0009GX2JG,"Before viewing this documentary, I knew nothing about psychedelic rock much less The Grateful Dead. It's truly insightful as to how it all began. The bands are great and the stories are even better.

Because of this documentary, I've started my collection of music from these ground-breaking bands!!",1120608000,9,299,5.229166666666667
2290082,5,B0009GX2JG,"Everything came together after a 6 hour game of ""Risk"": the ""Red Dog"" and a lot more was born. This great documentary allows the folks who were responsible, Ellen Harmon, Luria Castell, Lynne Hughes, Dan Hicks, Peter Albin, and many, many more, to tell the wonderful story of the time and place where rock bands and concerts, light shows, dancing, and rock posters all came together. These folks were pioneers and created something altogether new and necessary for the world in which they lived in 1965. Watch this and think about a time when creativity exploded in art, light, and sound before it became commodified and turned into stadium shows and collectibles.  It is GREAT to see and hear this history from the people who were there.  If you've read or watched any histories of ""The summer of love"" or the Haight-Ashbury or San Francisco acid rock, you'll appreciate hearing these stories from those who created them. This is oral history at its best (not a rock video!)",1278201600,,975,4.7976190476190474
2290083,5,B0009GX2JG,"This is indeed the best documentary on the '60s for those interested in the burgeoning psychedelic era in America. See my full review online at Floydian Slips, [...]",1245974400,,165,4.928571428571429
2290084,5,B0009GX2JG,"Dont buy this DVD anticipating alot of footage of the bands.  (A night at the family dog or the Grateful Dead movie might be a better choice)  If you'd like to get an inside glimpse of the San Francisco sound then this dvd is the one to buy.  The background of this type of music is unmatched.  They mainly focus on the Charaltans but they talk about all of them that took part in making this movement happen.  There are many individualists, some musicians, artists and promoters that are interviewed.
I rate it 5 stars based on actual footage and photos that took place back in the day.  One of the better rockumentaries Ive ever seen!",1230940800,,636,4.439655172413793
2290085,5,B0009GX2JG,"I'm sure this will be an unpopular review, but watch the DVD for the LACK of Greatful Dead content. The San Francisco scene was much more than the Dead...most folks seem to have forgotten that.",1224633600,,193,4.542857142857143
2290086,5,B0009GX2JG,"Not having seen this video yet, I must still say this: To appreciate this DVD, you must understand that there is VERY LITTLE original footage of ANY SF bands from this period. The heyday of the Red Dog Saloon in Virginia City, particularly related to The Charlatans, was '65/'66. We didn't have video cameras back then, for crying out loud! ANY surviving footage is to be treasured, now! If it wasn't for Monterey, there'd be next to nothing of the early days of bands like JA or Big Brother, either. BUY IT WHEN YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY! The Charlatans were different ... not the best, but they, like so many, were plowing new ground, and that alone is to be appreciated ...",1203206400,4,675,4.540983606557377
2290087,5,B0009GX2JG,"Thanks to these excellent dvd, the pieces missing from my puzzle of how the San Francisco sound and psychedelic music formed have been put into place, and the picture is clear to me now. The dvd was quite entertaining and engrossing, and it was nice to see that so many of those pioneers of that scene are still around today. I had never heard any music by the Charlatans until watching this dvd, and now i want to hear more! The question left for me now is, who influenced who? Were the Charlatans the main influence on the development of the Grateful Dead's, or Quicksilver Messenger's Service music, or did all have an influence on each other?
Rockin' At The Red Dog has , after one viewing, become an integral part of my music video collection.",1185926400,3,748,4.507352941176471
2290088,5,B0009GX2JG,"This DVD says it all--the history, the music of the era, the culture of the 60s San Franciso-Virginia City, NV scene that helped to create it..amazing Charlatans.  This DVD is a documentary that digs deep into the origins of the 1960s Haight-Ashbury counterculture. This is a story of Beatniks transforming into countercultural artists and the culture that develops out of a Virginia City, Nevada saloon. This DVD features Big Brother and the Holding Company when the group first began, as well as The charlatans, and more. These artists and individualists created a new culture and a new prototype society on the streets and in the Red Dog Saloon. You will not be disappointed by this amazing and highly informative film.",1170633600,5,722,5.016666666666667
2290089,5,B0009GX2JG,"I gave this DVD every star available.  It is solidly produced and presents a robust explication of a Movement which is taken for granted now, but was, lest we forget, ephemeral and wildly improbable in the extreme.  Yet it happened.  Chaos theory spins a tale of the ""butterfly effect"" which can eventually power a hurricane on the other side of the Earth.  How did the long hair of the Hippie's actually come about?  Were Hippies ""slobs"", ""bums"", ""idiots""?  No, they were perfectionists, actually, as any Grateful Dead roadie could endlessly testify.  The accessability of the story is perhaps too clear and immediate for viewers to credit on first viewing.  This film will get under your skin.  It is neglected, discounted anthropology.  It is important.",1170115200,8,756,5.024193548387097
2290090,5,B0009GX2JG,"I have to agree with some aspects of the negative reviews found here: Yes, if you're looking for stories revolving around the popular bands of the area, don't buy it. Actually, only buy this, if you heard or read of the Red Dog Saloon before. Because then it's safe to assume that you are really familiar with the development of the music scene in San Francisco in the 60s. Because then you don't have to rely on this DVD to learn who the Grateful Dead or Jefferson Airplane were.

If the Red Dog Saloon does ring a bell, buy this DVD. Buy it, because it contains the only known footage of the Charlatans, the real pioneers. True: If you listen to their sound you would never guess that they were the spearhead of the music scene back in 64 and 65. But that's not the point. This DVD basically explains why the Charlatans worked as a band, as an image and as a visual focus point that drew people because it was way cool.

Also to be seen on DVD: Excerpts of the Red Dog Reunion concert back in the early 90s with the Charlatans and Big Brother And The Holding Company. Lynne Hughes is there, too. The background of the Light Machine is explained. Interviews with people from the scene less famous than the typical names associated with it. Oh yes, and music. Music that is virtually forgotten by most of us today but still belongs and is easily identified as part of the dawn of psychedelic rock.

The bottom line: Great if not fantastic DVD for people interested in the background of the music scene. It concentrates on the Red Dog and leaves therefore little room for the more famous bands of the area. But that was not the intention. The DVD is a joy to watch. It is great to listen to the interviews. I will treasure this DVD.",1169337600,23,1731,4.369565217391305
2290091,5,B0009GX2JG,"I consider this an essential documentary of the sixties music scene. It's a story that might well be lost without this film.

If you're expecting a Grateful Dead video, like all the other videos from this company, then don't bother buying this one.

I'm really quite shocked by the one star reviews of this fascinating video. I guess either you get it or you don't.

Rockin' at the Red Dog isn't boring - it's hip, man, you dig?",1145145600,28,428,4.461538461538462

8060436,5,B0009GX2JG,I know folks who were at (& played) the Red Dog Saloon. I wish I had been old enough to have been there. This fills me in on all the folks I heard about over the years. It even has footage of the early Charlatans playing. Luria Castell is still a dream. She is dearly missed. Keepa Rockin'! I would order again from these folks!

8060439,5,B0009GX2JG,"great documentary. I spent my summers in Virginia city, and remember all the excitement and strangeness surrounding the red dog saloon. this was the beginning of the whole hippie thing, and all those great bands that came from that era. this video. tells that early story so well. buy it and share it. teach history with it. well worth the money.",1419552000,,346,4.688524590163935

8060441,5,B0009GX2JG,"Fascinating documentary about the birth of Psychedelic Rock at the Red Dog in Nevada and in San Francisco. The Charlatans, Jefferson Airplane, etc. took a huge risk and changed the face of music.",1402012800,,195,4.9393939393939394
8060442,4,B0009GX2JG,I was amazed at the number of key players they interviewed and it was put together very well. If you are into the hippie concert scene in North America you should see where it really all got started.,1364342400,,199,4.2631578947368425
8060443,3,B0009GX2JG,"Duration is 91 minutes, I wanted to first mention that this isn't a music DVD that I would watch all the time - however it is a decent title that I would dig out from time and again to view. 'Rockin' At The Red Dog' DVD is aimed to showcase the late '60's psychedelic era - as it was in San Francisco. Quite an interesting line-up I have to admit - like for example Quicksilver Messenger Service, the pre-Janis Joplin line-up of Big Brother & The Holding Company, the Grateful Dead, the folk rockers the Charlatans as well as some lesser-known artists from that time  such as Final Solutions, the somewhat eccentric Dan Hicks (who notably plays country, rock and some swing) and Lynn Hughes. Do keep in mind that this isn't a concert DVD, it's documentary (there's a difference). A fairly decent one at that.",1314662400,,808,4.534246575342466
