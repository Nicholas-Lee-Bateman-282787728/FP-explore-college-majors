8323132,4,B001N3R8XA,"As someone who has guided trekking and climbing expeditions in the Himalayas for 20 years, I would recommend the Khumbu Valley Blues DVD to anyone considering a visit to this region of Nepal.
The DVD gives an excellent overview of trekking in the Khumbu, Gokyo, and Imja Valleys, and the animated 3-D maps illustrate the geography of the trekking routes quite effectively.
Khumbu Valley Blues is not a high financed, professionally produced film, yet it's an entertaining program that provides a good feel for the Himalayan trekking experience.

8323133,1,B001N3R8XA,"Amateur video, shot by some old geezers with a camera during their trip to Everest Base Camp.  They had no source of electricity to recharge their camera, hence the actual footage of the trip is reduced to 2 minute segments, generally of them talking inside a small tent.  They had no special lenses or expertise so the beauty of the Himalayas, or any professional footage of the mountains or nature for that matter was totally lacking.  A complete waste of time.  I've made this trip myself and was looking forward to reliving some of the experience, and was bitterly disappointed with this ripoff.  This is an amateur production, completely home made with one camera, too much talking in a tent and practically no visual splendor.  Save your money.",1241913600,,750,4.8203125
