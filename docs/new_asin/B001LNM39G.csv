8318836,5,B001LNM39G,"Judith Vimala Anderson has created an artistic way to demonstrate yoga and other exercises that when combined in her flowing program, will confer to the user a better fitness level, including improved balance, coordination, and flexibility. Her settings are beautiful spots in Hawaii and the Florida Keys, and she has a nicely coordinated sound track of various musical influences that compliment the sets of exercises and yoga asanas she has strung together into a comprehensive workout that encompasses total body involvement. Judith demonstrates almost all of the workout for her audience, and her fitness level is not only obvious, but quite pleasing to watch. This is a very low-impact set, but going thru the entire workout as shown will require some effort for even the fittest of participants. I had to take a few breaks to get all the way thru, and I am experienced with Hatha Yoga and in fairly good shape. The DVD has a lot of pretty scenery, including Judith, and the music flows nicely with the demonstrations. There is a lovely photo collage at the end of the tape that gives opportunity for relaxation and warm-down at the conclusion of the set. I have tried many yoga demos and video exercise programs, but ""I~Change"" is unique, artistic, and will work wonders for anyone who gives it some time and effort.",1230249600,,1322,4.90625
8318837,5,B001LNM39G,"I was inspired by this CD to finally commit to a consistent yoga practice! Judith Vimala Anderson is a centered, playful, physically strong, and fluid guide who takes us on a calming yet powerful journey through magical tropical landscapes accompanied by enchanting sounds. Love that she invited a variety of people to demonstrate the facial exercises, as well as many musicians to accompany her. I feel definitely calmer and stronger after each session.",1228435200,,454,5.232876712328767

8318839,5,B001LNM39G,"A sumptuous yoga feast for the eyes, ears, body & soul.  It's inspiring and easy to follow; both husband and I were on the floor within minutes (couldn't resist), following the moves as we visited the beautiful scenery of Key West and the sounds of Hawaii.  We have not been yoga practioners before, but we liked doing this.",1227312000,,324,4.568965517241379

I've seen a lot of yoga dvd's; this one is the best that I have experienced. It is beautifully put together with just the right music and fabulous locations. The instructor offers plenty of time for the practitioner to breath in deeply with each exercise. For a fruitful yoga experience, this is the one!",1227139200,,508,6.815384615384615
