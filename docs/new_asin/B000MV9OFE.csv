8172902,4,B000MV9OFE,"This movie is similar in theme ( no accident, I am sure) to Letter to 3 Wives.  This time, 3 men are each left a letter by a dead friend implying he has had  an affair with each of their wives. This leads to comic complications as each man remembers incidents with his wife and the man in question.  It's a lower budget production, with good actors (although not of the star caliber of ""Wives"") and a reasonably good script. It certainly sets double standards for the sexes, especially the Ruth Warwick episode concerning how the wife is expected react to a cheating husband as opposed to his reactions to the suggestion his wife might have been cheating too.  Eve Arden and Howard da Silva are very good in the (imitation) Paul Douglas/Linda Darnell parts. Emelyn Williams never did much work,  that I know of, in American films and appears here as the dead playboy which was also interesting to see.  I have only known him as a writer and an older character actor prior to this. All in all, I would say this is an interesting comparison and a pleasant way to spend 90 minutes if your expectations are not too high.  Well worth the 7.95 it costs!  The print and sound were of reasonably good quality as well.",1243728000,13,1209,4.463636363636364
