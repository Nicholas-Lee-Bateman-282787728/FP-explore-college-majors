8571878,2,B00BO82H5S,"Whatever the writer/director was trying to convey here, I just didn't get it. I think the camera work (in a very challenging environment) was probably the best part of the movie. Forget plot, forget closure at the ending.",1490054400,,221,4.842105263157895
8571879,3,B00BO82H5S,The cover to the movie is misleading... It's obviously not dark....  the title elusively hides what the movie is about... women in the jungle that dominate men...,1410393600,,162,5.0
8571880,5,B00BO82H5S,"The film unfolds in the Amazon jungle where the protagonist while looking for adventure is enslaved by a group of indigenous women.  As he tries to scape, it turns challengeable and painful for him and others. Most of the movie unfolds in a dream-like order that will keep you wondering what is real and what is not.

What I love the most, is the surprised twist at the end and the sceneries of the jungle.",1392940800,,406,4.4
8571881,4,B00BO82H5S,"In this film the psyche of manhood is exposed to some extremes. Put into the wilds of the jungle, surrounded by ""family"" he has not met before, a man finds himself adrift, lonely and seeking companionship and adventure. Of course, like so many macho men, this man seeks out women. Little does he know, vulnerability is exactly what can make a man or woman fall. This film has one of the most actual dream-like sequences in a movie I've seen lately.  Figuring out what is reality and what isn't is part of the fun. His perceived reality is not your typical Hollywood stereotype story. I don't want to give anything away that isn't obvious, but let's just say that you will find yourself immersed and lost in the mind of this troubled hunk of testosterone. I recommend this film for the artistically adventurous.",1392249600,,810,4.664335664335664
8571882,4,B00BO82H5S,"I read a few reviews before I purchased this product, so I was pretty sure that I would find it interesting. It got off to a pretty slow start, and by the time they reached the jungle, I had already developed a strong dislike for the protagonist that lasted through the entire movie. No heroes here. This is no salacious teaser about Amazon women. These women are savage and have developed a kingdom in the jungle that is not for the faint-hearted-- kind of an ""Apocalypse Now"" with a tribe of women calling the shots. I didn't much like the ending. It felt like a cop-out-- like the writers couldn't live with the monsters they created.",1382486400,,637,4.5
