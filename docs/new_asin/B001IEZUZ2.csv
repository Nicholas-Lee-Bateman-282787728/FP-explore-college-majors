But it's the content that matters, and VRBNO is, IMHO, Vic and Bob at their best. Surreal, hilarious, unique. Sure, it is kinda a love it or loath it style of show, but the heck with the haters. Find some clips on YouTube or whatever and check for yourself.

I thought VRBNO lasted more than two seasons, but I may have been wrong. In any case, this collection of series one and two is really nice in terms of technical quality, restoration, et al. Nothing much to mention by way of extras or whatever, but there again, with material this solid, who needs commentary?

Enjoy!",1285113600,,680,4.512195121951219
