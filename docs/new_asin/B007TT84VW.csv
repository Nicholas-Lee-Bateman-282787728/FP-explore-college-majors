8521811,1,B007TT84VW,"Returned this item.  No mention was  made of the fact that the DVD could not be played in
the United States.  Alas, I think I will never find a DVD of ""So Long At The Fair.""  It needs
to be in English and playable on U.S. equipment.  I think it should be a requirement for all
DVDs sold on Amazon to clearly list the play area.",1344816000,14,327,3.893939393939394
