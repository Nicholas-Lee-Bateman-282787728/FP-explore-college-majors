8587227,5,B000A6J42O,"A wonderful biography of Polar Bear Scientists saving the life of twin Polar Bear Cubs deserted by their own mother.  The staff fed and  even slept with the cubs till they reached maturity. The staff eventually found the right food for these cubs without their mother's milk and nurturing.  The staff taught these cubs how to swim and many other functions.  When they became older - Klondike and Snow had to be placed in a Zoo when they matured and one of the Scientists - after a long time - went to the zoo where Klondike and Snow were and the Polar Cub - who is now an adult Polar Bear that he had nurtured and brought up - recognised him and came to the spot that he was standing - in front of the cage.
Parents - please buy this for your children - In this world of violence etc. our children need to know the grace of nature loving people who care about animals
