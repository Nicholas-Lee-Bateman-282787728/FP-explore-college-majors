1220954,1,B00000IBPE,"Terribly wrong, wrong, wrong. The most horrible image of Gwenevere to ever be filmed.",1136246400,3,85,5.142857142857143
1220955,1,B00000IBPE,"I watched this movie having read that it was based on Persia Woolley's Guinevere trilogy.  The books were entertaining--not my favorite Arthurian story, but decent.  I have no idea what happened between the writing of the screen adaptation and actual filming, but the book is unrecognizable except for the basic facts: Guinevere marries Arthur, loves Lancelot, etc.  I've seen all of the main actors in other things so I know they can act, but this movie gave them so little to work with I'm not surprised by the wooden faces they have in most scenes.  The costumes were terrible--a previous reviewer was right, I've seen better at a RenFaire.  Cheryl Lee's short hair WAS distracting.

It's a shame that one of the few (maybe only) movies centered around Guinevere had to be so bad.  Watch it if you're curious to see how bad for yourself, but remember you'll be giving up ninety-three minutes of your life to do it.",1124755200,7,917,4.729559748427673
1220956,3,B00000IBPE,Noah Wyle is about the only one in this movie that can act. The movie itself is so-so as the story plods along on the predictable trail of the constantly retold. Watch it for Wyle's acting - his great sense of facial drama. The guy knows how to act for the camera. Then donate the DVD to the library. Once is enough.,1109721600,4,316,4.112903225806452
1220957,1,B00000IBPE,"I'm a sucker for retellings of the King Arthur legend; I've read or watched as many of them as I could, from The Mists of Avalon (great book, lousy movie) to the film Excalibur to the musical Camelot to real oddities like John Steinbeck's abortive attempt to modernize the tale and Monty Python's zany parody of it.  Guinevere is thus far the most horrible, uninteresting, slow-paced, poorly acted, poorly scripted, ill-conceived and pointless version I've come across.  I liked Sheryl Lee in Twin Peaks and Noah Wylie in ER, but here they are as wooden as Merlin's staff.  In their defense the writing is appalling and plotting inane, but they and the entire supporting cast take this gorgeous, emotionally complex myth and turn it to frozen muck.  It's hard to have a romantic triangle when one of the characters hardly appears--Arthur is little more than a bit part in this film.  Almost nothing of the original is retained--none of Arthur's knights appear as characters and the quest for the Holy Grail is completely omitted.  The climax of the film is not the ferocious battle in which Arthur is killed by his illegitimate son; that never occurs in this travesty--Guinevere and Arthur live happily ever after and Lancelot simply goes away.  No, the climax occurs when Guinevere tells the 5 rebel kings that they ought to give up Arthur and be part of Britian because it's the way to insure the future of the country, and shucks, they all agree and drop their weapons--I'm not kidding.  I'd like to say SOMETHING good about this movie, but I can't even complement the hair-styles!  Avoid this at all costs, no matter how devout an Arthurian you may be.",1094256000,14,1656,4.782456140350877
1220958,5,B00000IBPE,"As an Asian, I have to admit that I knew barely nothing about Arthurian legend. And this "" Guinevere "" story could be way off traditional. The whole story puzzles me. It's the major flaw. How come  Morgan LeFay adopted Lancelot and be the mentor of Guin? Later she commit  incest with her half brother, Arthur. In great torment Guin gave birth to a  baby, then send her away, to keep her from Morgan's witch power. ( And  revenge Arthur, maybe? ). Where's the baby girl? Certainly Merlin has  mention of her, once. And all the people seems to forget such a tragedy had  ever happened?  Arthur is a coward, even not qualify to be a man.  Morgan  can never dominate Lancelot's will, he's a freeman of his own. Guin was  never a feminist as she claimed herself to be. She should follow her heart,  never ranaway from Lancelot at first place. ( She's pretty young, not ready  for accept a man, yet? ). Nobility heart is more important than nobility  birth. Lancelot watch over her through an unhappily marriage. Neglect the  fact that she has gave birth of another man's child.  Always waiting for  her to turn back. Arthur sent Lancelot to fight a unwinning battle, wish  him never return, so menacing evil. When two lovers finally meet again,  Guin ask Lancelot to rescue Arthur from tyrant. Gave up the great  opportunity to runaway with him. Always give, ask for no reward. What a  Valentine! He answers her plea, to save Arthur and disappear from her life,  forever. A sentimental lament. She never deserves a noble-minded man like  Lancelot. Somehow Sheryl Lee wasn't quite right as the heroine. ( I can't  tell where went wrong? ). At least she's not a good match for Noah Wyle.  That's how I felt.
I rate it 5 stars though actually it's not perfect,  compare with those thought-provoking, life-inspiring films. Quite  magnificent as a TV-Movie. A beautiful castle above in the middle of a  lake. Morning fog in the woods. The grand scenery of Lithuania. Make you  really crave for go back to medieval age, to live through that time. And  the romantic ancient Celtic music, so breathtaking, enthralling chanting.  How come Johnny Harris never release a soundtrack? You can also see cute  Noah Wyle, while he was a newcomer, in his early twenties. Though he's only  a supporting role, shining gem of the whole film.  ( I wasn't his fan,  till I watch this). All in all, It's charming and irresistible, a dream  worth to buy.",946857600,15,2426,4.6415094339622645
1220959,5,B00000IBPE,"It definatly isn't the traditional tale.  It takes quite a few little liberties some of the characters and their relations (nothing a non-obssesed Arthur fan would notice).  It's a beginning story (tells about  the establishment of his kingdom, not his reign and end).  Unfortunatly  Arthur's wonderfuly simple wisdom, royal knowledge and extreme goodness of  character are sacraficed to give Guinevere more of the spotlight (and the  credit for the kingdom).  Another thing that was lost was the beautiful  chemistry, tension and thrill of the incredible Lancelot-Guinevere-Arthur  love triangle.  That would probalbly be my greatest chritism.  But it is  Arthur story (and therefore practically impossible to ruin).  And it's also  nice to get a good look at Guinevere.  I always enjoy hearing the story  from her persepective.  Lee's acting was rather weak, but Flannery and  Whyle were superb.  Take a look.",946080000,17,911,5.371428571428571
1221000,3,B00000IBPE,"The idea of the Camelot story from the female perspective isn't new.  It has been successfully done in books (The Mists of Avalon & the Mary Stewart books).

This movie failed because it didn't go far enough.  The Merlin character is downright creepy and I found the hairstyles to be off-putting.  Why does Guin have short hair?

This movie fails because they spent more budget on scenery and not enough on the length and content of the film.  This was a made for TV movie and it feels like a soap opera.",1415923200,3,504,4.423913043478261
1221001,5,B00000IBPE,MOST ENJOYABLE.  GREAT ACTING.  LOVELY STORY.,1414540800,,45,6.333333333333333
1221002,2,B00000IBPE,"The idea of a queen trying to promote peace and prosperity, thus setting the foundations for a prosperous Britian, is a great one.  This movie does not do justice to this concept.  It is flat, uninteresting and boring in parts.  The actors, except Pleasance, appeared listless and unconvincing.",1406160000,2,294,5.083333333333333
1221003,1,B00000IBPE,"Dated and lifeless performances.  I don't usually compare movies to their books, but this one missed the mark completely.  Read the book instead of wasting you time watching this dated and tired movie.",1400803200,,201,5.0606060606060606
1221004,2,B00000IBPE,Camelot from a female perspective sounded intriguing but I found it unsatisfying and very slow moving.  Either they left out the critical details in various spots or maybe I nodded off and missed them.,1390348800,,201,4.911764705882353
1221005,2,B00000IBPE,"Low budget, poor acting boring movie.  Very glad I didn't have to pay for this at a theater or as a rental.",1379548800,,107,3.8636363636363638
1221006,3,B00000IBPE,Fairly decent movie good for a rainy day with nothing else to watch.  Very budget minded as costumes has no imagination and action scenes were not very exciting.  Heroine cute not believable with such short hair.,1378598400,2,212,4.861111111111111
1221007,4,B00000IBPE,"Sheryl Lee is a shamefully under-appreciated actor - her work in ""Twin Peaks; Fire Walk With Me"" was absolutely stunning.  Her work here, in this witchy retelling of the Arthurian Legend, is quite wonderful as well; powerful, Shakespearean in its approach. The Irish actress, Brid Brennan, is very scary as Morgan, high priestess of the Britons, Arthur's half-sister and sworn enemy.  This is a well-made movie, quite absorbing.  Fans of the legend, or of historical drama in general, should find this film enjoyable.  Me, I'm a stone Sheryl Lee fan, and this is excellent work.  There's so little of Sheryl available that I was delighted to find ""Guinevere.""",1350000000,,659,5.064814814814815
1221008,3,B00000IBPE,"I got this movie for one penny plus shipping.  So I can't complain,  but,  I can critique.  The script and dialogue are ""stodgy"".  Although it took the chaaracter Guinevere in a new direction.  The writers and director fell way short of anything that might be considered as clever.  Filmed in the early 90's and released a decade or so later.  Noah Wyle actually looked like the teen character he was playing in the opening scenes.
If you appreciate this genra and don't mind the author taking liberties with the story line..  Then it well worth the cost of shipping.  If you are looking for entertainment ...I would recommend against spending much beyond what I did.",1349568000,,667,4.721739130434782
1221009,1,B00000IBPE,"The acting is very bad. The characters are completely unbelievable. The battle scene choreography is grade school theater-level and the story is uninspiring. Overall, I couldn't wait to finish it and turn it off. I didn't care what happend to the characters, they were that poorly portrayed. Don't buy this - it is a total waste of time. My copy is going into the yard sale bin.",1337644800,2,378,4.656716417910448
7910131,3,B00000IBPE,"A made for TV movie with low production values.  I am not familiar with the source material, but it's quite a different take on the story than anything else I've seen/read (including Excalibur, The Mists of Avalon, and The Once and Future King).  In this iteration Guinevere and Lancelot have known each other since childhood, (I enjoyed their story), and the marriage between Arthur and Guinevere is seen as a business arrangement from the beginning.  This iteration of the story is also decidedly non-magical; magic is mentioned but what little is seen is quite neutered, and Merlin comes across as an impotent old man on the sidelines.",1523318400,,638,4.94392523364486
7910132,3,B00000IBPE,It was an interesting movie - and if you knew nothing about King Arthur and Guinevere it would be fine.  But all the events in this movie were taken completely out of order or left out completely.,1518393600,,196,4.297297297297297
7910133,1,B00000IBPE,"inaccurate and over dramatic

It has some interesting ideas, and takes liberties everywhere, though it would have been nice if some of the illustrations in this story were true it is not at all based on anything we know of the Arthurian legions.
The story is ok but acting and everything else leaves much to be desired.",1486080000,,319,4.5964912280701755
7910134,5,B00000IBPE,"This was a wonderful love story. A woman torn between 2 men. She truly loves Lancelot but for the sake of her country's peace she must stay with King Arthur. I had a sense that this was meant to be a two-parter with Lancelot returning and the tradition love/sex affair commences that most Guinevere/Lancelot tales have. At least that's the feeling I am getting from this movie. That would have made this movie all the more satisfying. Also, Morgan's son, Mordred and his revenge against King Arthur as in other King Arthur tales would have added to this story.",1474502400,,560,4.666666666666667
7910135,5,B00000IBPE,"This is a beautiful approach to the legend.  I found this movie after reading the series of Persia Woolley's novels that are the basis for the movie.  If you love the storyline, the books are definitely your next step.",1464048000,,218,4.564102564102564
7910136,4,B00000IBPE,Interesting version of the story of Guinevere.,1449705600,,46,5.714285714285714
7910137,4,B00000IBPE,"I thought it was good--different than what I was expecting.  I think I prefer the ""Camelot"" version, but this one was still entertaining.",1446508800,,137,4.956521739130435
7910138,3,B00000IBPE,"An interesting melange of the Arthurian Legend in the name of a feminist bend. I appreciate the feminist bend, but the movie is confused albeit educational.",1446336000,,156,5.038461538461538
7910139,2,B00000IBPE,"A bottom-budget TV production that looks more a ""Star Trek"" holodeck recreation of dark ages England than the real thing, ""Guinevere"" (1994) attempts to tell the Arthurian legend from a female perspective, but just dies on the screen. Check out the lavishly produced TNT miniseries ""The Mists of Avalon"" (based on the Marion Zimmer book) if you want a good feminist take on the myth. This one is decidedly minor league.

Sheryl Lee (""Twin Peaks,"" TNT's ""David"" miniseries) is a decent choice to play Guinevere, caught between King Arthur and Lancelot, but she's under-served here by a high school theater approach to the material. Likewise, Noah Wyle (""The Librarian"") as Lancelot and Sean Patrick Flanery (""Boondock Saints"") seem like intriguing choices for their roles, but trust me: It looks much better on paper than in the finished product, where they act more like walk-ons from ""Dawson's Creek"" than medieval knights. Even the reliably wacky Donald Pleasance as Merlin, who is presented here in the inexplicable dual role of Catholic bishop and pagan wizard, falls completely flat. The incoherent plot builds to a climax of such utter inanity that one marvels this movie got made at all.

There are no special features on this disc, sold for $2 in a cardboard sleeve rather than box. I've seen many of the most recent film and TV-movie versions of the Arthurian cycle: ""Excalibur,"" ""First Knight,"" ""The Mists of Avalon,"" ""Merlin,"" ""King Arthur,"" ""The Last Legion,"" and even ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail."" But this film is the absolute worst: Watch it only if you're a purist who feels the need to see every version of this story on film, or for the shock value of seeing a decent cast do this material very badly.",1430524800,,1724,4.9006849315068495
7910140,5,B00000IBPE,"A nice movie to watch, to get the King Arthur story from a woman's view point, Guinevere.",1418428800,,89,4.294117647058823
