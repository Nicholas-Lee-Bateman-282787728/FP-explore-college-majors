7832584,2,6302961661,"The seller advertised this as the version narrated by Sterling Holloway(the original voice actor for Winnie the Pooh), but this version is narrated by the Disney character Ludwig Von Drake(voice actor Paul Frees). I would not have purchased this item if I would have known that this was not the Sterling Holloway version. The narrator's voice acting and script makes a big difference for the viewer. I am very disappointed with this product.",1316736000,12,441,5.054794520547945
7832585,2,6302961661,"I watched this as a kid, and I wanted to share it with my children. But the narrator on this version is AWFUL to listen to!  He has a thick accent and is difficult for me to understand, let alone my children.  I think I am going to keep looking for the version with better narration. Other than that, the story is the same.",1233619200,3,323,4.03125
7832586,5,6302961661,"When I was very young I loved this and I still do. Mickey, Donald and Goofy live in Hapy Valley, near the babbling brook, until the magic singing golden harp is stolen by the giant. They must climb the magic beanstalk and retrieve it in order to save Happy Valley. Lovely music and animation with classic Disney characters.",1123027200,3,323,4.586206896551724
7832587,5,6302961661,"""Mickey and the Beanstalk"" is one of those rare Disney shorts that has the feel and look of one of the studio's feature length animated works, mainly because it was originally part of the 1947 grab-bag feature ""Fun and Fancy Free.""  Donald and Goofy get as much screen time as Mickey in this amusing revision of the tale of Jack.  The best sequence is when the magic beanstalk starts growing at night and the animators also do a nice job of making the giant look, uh, gigantic!  One of the best Disney ""mini-classics,"" and a treat for parents as well as kids.",989452800,10,559,4.46078431372549
7832588,1,6302961661,I should have bought something else.  I bought it for my two-year old and he quickly lost interest.  I also bought it for me and I quickly lost interest.,973123200,,153,4.241379310344827
