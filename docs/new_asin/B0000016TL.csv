1175132,5,B0000016TL,"The essentials of the story - a mistreated girl with a kind heart, and kind hearts are rewarded by marrying handsome princes. Angelina is unlike most of Rossini's other comedic heroines; she is not in the mold of the feisty, strong-willed women like those found in 'Il Turco in Italia' and 'L'italiana in Algeri' . Angelina  doesn't have a significant aria until the act II finale, a vocal-fireworks spectacular that she shares with most of the principals and the chorus.
La Cenerentola is very much an ensemble work, with Don Magnifico getting three plum arias and the lead tenor Ramiro only getting one significant piece of solo work.
This 1988 Salzburg live production is more down to earth than the 1980 Ponnelle film, based on a 1974 La Scala production. Director Michael Hampe follows Rossini's intentions and makes this a morality tale emphasizing various aspects of the human condition. Angelina is sweet natured and sadly resigned to her plight, the stepsisters are not ugly caricatures, but two vain and selfish women, and there's no attempt to add a comic luster to Don Magnifico. In this production, Magnifico hopes to better his lot in life by finding rich husbands for his daughters.
The music sparkles under Chailly's direction, and the singing is in good hands, the acting is credible, and Hampe's direction is straightforward and unaffected.  One of the visual highlights of this staging is the deft handling of the storm scene in act II. Shown largely in silhouette, Don Ramiro is riding in a horse-drawn coach, Dandini holding on for dear life as they hurry through a nighttime storm. The wind is blowing, the coach is bouncing, the horse is galloping, hats blow off--it's great theatre!
Ann Murray is credible as poor Cinderella with her slightly austere demeanour and wonderful vocal acting. The comic relief is the prince's manservant, Dandini, who gets to play Prince for a Day by switching identities with the real prince, Ramiro. Gino Quilico does not approach the role of Dandini as comic buffoon, but rather as a spritely young man who would like to better his station in life and who savors every minute of being the prince. If his duet with Berry's Don NMagnifico 'Un segreto importanza' isn't at all buffo, it is the director's requirement.
Francisco Araiza acts brilliantly in this live performance, showing the proper amount of mild irritation when Dandini oversteps his bounds, and is appropriately comic and authoritative as the Prince looking for someone to love him for himself and not for his title.
Angela Denning and Daphne Evangelatos walk a fine line playing the stepsisters to show us the vanity without becoming objectionable. If they are callous towards Angelina, it's not because they're mean--just two self-absorbed women more interested in themselves than in other people. The only characterization was inadequate was Walter Berry's Don Magnifico. Berry doesn't have the right kind of comic swagger to make Don Magnifico likeable, and his singing is on the dry side throughout.
The other ultra-fine DVD of this work available is of course the  film (directed and designed by Jean-Pierre Ponnelle) with Frederica von Stade, Francisco Araiza, Paolo Montarsolo, and Claudio Desderi. The Ponnelle film was based on the 1974 La Scala stage production. Von Stade's Angelina is similar to Ann Murray's--sweet and unaffected and clearly smitten with the disguised Prince. Araiza's Ramiro is a bit more nuanced in the film than on the stage at Salzburg, and Montarsolo's Don Magnifico is a lot more likeable than Walter Berry's is. Montarsolo looks like an impoverished nobleman, whereas Berry's characterization lacks sophistication. Claudio Desderi is more comedic than Quilico. While Quilico has charm, he has not got the devilish cunning of a Simone Alberghini in the 21st Glyndebourne and MET productions.
On the whole, a top-notch live version of Rossini's comic masterpiece that tops the Houston (Brian Large), Glyndebourne, Liceu and MET productions.",1355356800,4,3996,5.154083204930663
1175133,3,B0000016TL,"This seemed a first class production of the opera (though the conducting could have been a bit more animated, I thought.) Good staging, unexceptionable period costumes, plausible attractive singers: everything one would want. However, there was the usual annoyance of clever camerawork, which fragmented the fine staging, and showed the illusory nature of the stage finery. The real problem is the chintzy production from KULTUR, which had only English subtitles (as though no one on earth read, or was, Italian). Likewise the sound and picture quality was poor, as usual for Kultur.",1295654400,2,583,5.3478260869565215
1175134,4,B0000016TL,"In reality, half a dozen of reviews, some quite lenghty, have been written for this production. You will find them by checking the Australian production of Cinderella of 1987 whose DVD came out in 2009 also. Note that the first part of the EDITORIAL REVIEWS of Cinderella is about the production of the Vienna Phil. Orch. and not the Elizabethan Sydney Orchestra's. The second part is ok.
I have not seen the 2009 DVD, only the 2001 which I found wonderful. Also, I was surprised by Don Magnifico's brutality toward his sweet step-daughter and completely disgusted by the gross errors in the French subtitles where ""cour"" and ""sour"" were supposed to mean ""coeur"" and ""soeur"".",1264723200,,675,4.878260869565217
1175135,4,B0000016TL,"This Cenerentola is very real. The tale is of a woman scorned by the Don and his two miserable daughters. This interpretation is beautifully acted by Ann Murray who reaches the depths of her soul to forgive those who mistreated her with sometimes harsh scorn and always as a non-entity. Angelina(Cinderella) plays the scorned maid with great apathy and as Cinderella is elegant and just.
She sings beautifully. The Prince (Francisco Araiza, at first portrays the valet, acts superbly and sings with his tuneful Rossinian tempos; very enjoyable. Dandini,played by Gino Quilico, the Prince's valet, though initially enters as the prince on his galloping horse, has the flair and comic sense as he plays the foil to the Don's daughters. Then there is Don Magnifico, portrayed by Walter Berry; he plays the foppish, superficial household figure, hoping to procure a ""standing"" with the Prince so the Prince may marry  one of his two daughters, Clorinda and Tisbe. When confronting Cinderella, he is outwardly cruel and has a scary edginess......verbal cruelty. Alidoro, Wolfgang Schone, plays the beggar aided by Cinderella; the mentor to the Prince; the wise sage who gives hope to Cinderella. Riccardo Chailly masterfully conducts the Vienna forces and keeps the opera moving. The singing is what you will remember. The ensemble will not be forgotten.

1175136,4,B0000016TL,"Beautiful production, wonderful singing from marvellous singers. But it was certainly some 20 years ago when staged.",1256256000,,116,5.882352941176471
1175137,4,B0000016TL,"This is an excellent Cenerentola, not perfect but excellent none the less. Let me go through the singers one by one.

Araiza was one of the world'd best in this sort of role at this period in his career. He has at least three versions on disk. He has beauty of voice, range, color and muscianship.

He has always been criticized for over separating the notes in the passage work. Some hear this as aspirations. He does sing all the notes but some people think he cheats by injecting the little breaths. Bartoli (a Cinderella) is also sometimes criticized for aspirations.

Personally I think its a valid artistic choice. It certainly isn't easier to sing that way. In fact it takes more breath and support to articulate each note even with an aspirate. It certainly is superior to smearing.

Araiza is vastly better than Matteuezzi on the Bartoli CD. I'm very fond of Ugo Benelli in this role but Araiza has much more voice. Gimenez also has less voice and its not as pretty either. My favorite Ramiro is probably Rockwell Blake from the early NY City Opera performance in English. At that time his voice was still beautiful, he was handsom, a super actor, and he interpolated notes above high C.

Ariaza is not very good looking. He acts well enough but he is not very credible as a romantic lover.

Ann Murray is adequate without ever being more. She is also not that attractive. She looks tired. She is not ever bad but she is the least effective of the many fine recorded Cenerentolas. Those include: Bartoli, Baltsa, Larmore, Von Stade, Berganza, etc.

There are three bass parts in Cenerentola: Dandini, Alidoro and Don Magnifico. Many Rossini specialists sing all three bass parts. Simone Alaimo and Alesandro Corbelli on other recordings will sing Dandini as well as Magnifico or Alidoro.

The Dandini here is Gino Quilico and he's wonderful. He's actually funny and dashing and sings very well indeed. Only Alan Titus is his equal on recordings.

Walter Berry is an unusual choice for Magnifico. He is quite nasty and brutal. The original Grimm Brothers tale is very dark and Berry brings some of that out. Often this part is done as a clown which robs the drama of the danger needed for the clemency in the final scene to have some point.

The Alidoro - Schone - on this recording is more of a baritone or bass-baritone rather than the low bass usually heard. On one of the CDs the Alidoro is Ugo Trama with his deep, black voice. of course the trade-off is that Trama can't really sing the notes. Schone gets to do almost all of the great aria ""La Del Ceil"" and he does a superb job with it. Rossini wrote Cenerentola in only three weeks. He originally gave Alidoro a simpler aria ""Vasto Theatro"". Later he composed the long and very difficult ""La Del Ceil"". Most productions cut it because so few basses can sing it. It's good to hear it here. Schone is a bit better than John Del Carlo and not quite as good as Michele Pertusi.

The ugly step sisters are good if not outstanding. No one can match Gianna Rolandi on the NY City recording if only because she gets a huge solo aria not heard elsewhere.

The production is very fine. A nearly monotone unitary set is used throughout. It sounds dull but is in fact elegant. Dandini's entrance is very effective with him sliding in on a big wooden horse.

Cenerentola is best comic opera. Everyone should have at least one recording. This is a good one. Recommended.",1139270400,6,3423,4.582651391162029
1175138,2,B0000016TL,This is a good production of the opera but unfortunately the video quality is poor. Many of the R.M. Arts releases seem to have poor video quality and if I had know it was an R.M. Arts production I wouldn't have bought it.,1062633600,6,222,4.186046511627907
1175139,5,B0000016TL,"This is the story of Cinderella with a different twist. A Step father vs a Stepmother. Don Magnifico played by Walter Berry and his two warring daughters/siblings Clorinda And Tisbe. A pair of bracelets rather than glass slippers. Finally, the Prince's tutor, Alidoro, posing as a beggar to whom Cinderella gives bread. Alidoro will become Ciderella's angel and advocate. No Fairy Godmother here. Dandini, the counterfeit Prince played by Gino Quilico is a pure delight, pulling of the deception in brilliant fashion. Francisco Araiza as the real Prince whom I have seen in other Opera's is of magnificent tenor voice along with superb acting. Ann Murray as Cinderella is incomparable, wow what a performance, convincing, heartfelt and purley delightfull in every respect. The themes of forgiveness and respect hit home. Certainly a Five Star rating at Amazon. Com, but a 10 out 10 for performance, visual scenery and the Vienna Philharmonic.

Especially tenor Francisco Araiza, which I have seen in different operas, shows in here all his excellence by acting and singing so magnificent and beautifully, accomplishing the character he plays as The Prince.

7901954,3,B0000016TL,"Chailly conducts Salzberg Festival  Vienna St Op Or & Vienna Phil.
The reviews here are for every production of this Rossini Opera so quite unreliable.
This is truly Buffa, an operetta, light and frothy like Gilbert & Sullivan. But his dreary production is icy in the best drab uninteresting style of one color wash Neil Gaimon. The palette du couleurs = paynes grey, hard white, umber/cream. There is frigid kind of burnt umber for the browns. The hardness and icy wash of cold gray covers everything. It dampens the set. The staging is quite rigid. To some degree the sisters are in best voice for this live performance.
Set is constrained with only one level.
The supernatural lighning storm, an integral part of this story, lights a mechanical horse carriage(blk mais non). The other effect is another frozen horse (white) statue arriving with the prince.
The operetta features multiple rounds & then increased speed with repetition, usually utilized to comic effect. Here it fall completely flat. The thrust is really to be had from the pit,but here Chailly also must have received some bad news that day because the orchestra just doesn't deliver. Whatever this operetta may lack in great musical score it still exudes an effervescent (music of the people) sparkle,however this performance's musicality is practically nonexistent.
The primaries all give very lackluster performance and are not up to the kind of bouncing from note to note & trills expected. The lack of body language is also apparent and makes for ultra lifeless dull performance. Perhaps they all overate beforehand or had to stand around too lang all day for camera work, in any case it fizzled. This particular performance was a poor choice to immortalize for posterity. It is a good example of what looks & sounds like a 'very bad night' in theater talk. The sort when you and the audience know it is a no go.
This Rossini classic is on other DVD's. Some are very good in one aspect or another. None are as dreary as this one. For sheer humor and buoyancy it is hard to beat the Bartoli. The extreme lightness of the music suggests Angeline could be a Jeanette MacDonald or Lily Pons, not a mezz at all.",1467158400,,2180,4.797872340425532

7901959,4,B0000016TL,"... is that, though the Bel Canto of Ann Murray is plenty Bello, this 1988 Cenerentola DVD from the Salzburg Festival is nowhere near as satisfactory as the DVD of the 1981 production at La Scala with Frederica von Stade in the title role. The two productions had a lot in common. Both were ""traditional"" stagings, well costumed, no heavy-thumbed directorial modernizations. Murray and von Stade were both at the peak of their vocal careers, while the role of Don Ramiro was sung magnificently on both stages by Francisco Araiza. Otherwise, the La Scala DVD is superior across the board, from conducting to camerawork. Remember that this IS a DVD, though filmed at a live performance! Sound recording quality is paramount; the singers and orchestra on the La Scala DVD are well balanced and integrated, but the sound on this Salzburg DVD is uneven, fading in and out, and of very low fidelity. The TV video is hardly up to the standards of our HDTV era. That isn't a failing which ruins the viewing experience, but the thin acoustic is a bummer.

Riccardo Chailly's conducting of the Vienna Philharmonic at Salzburg is cautious to the point of coyness. The overture sounds strangely subdued and the flow from recitativo to aria is tentative throughout. At La Scala, Claudio Abbado gave his audience what Rossini-lovers want: headlong exuberance and lyrical sprightliness.

It's hard to compare the vocal artistry of the singers in secondary roles from these two DVDs, given how different the sound-recording quality is. Their acting is a different matter.  Gino Quilico sings Dandini quite handsomely, but in fact he's too handsome for the role, which is intended to be comic. Other reviewers have suggested that the haughty stepsisters Tisbe and Clorinda are not supposed to be comic caricatures. Hmmm. I can't imagine why not. This staging, to my mind, is rather glum and moralistic at times. The rapid-patter ensembles don't have the verve Rossini demands, and some of them are raggedy in relation to the orchestra.

Sets? Jean-Pierre Ponnelle is often ""over the top"" for me, but his sets for the La Scala filming, based on sets he'd designed a decade earlier, are excellent both visually and as context for the acting. The sets for the Salzburg production are stiff, too symmetrical, hard to move through, boring. Likewise the stage movement tends to be blocky.

Had I attended this Cenerentola in the Kleines Festspielhaus at the Salzburg Festival, I'm sure I'd have been wildly enthusiastic. La Cenerentola, like most of Rossini's operas, is well worth hearing and seeing live as often as possible. But let me say it again: This is a DVD! I can't imagine why anyone would play it more than once when the more satisfying Abbado/von Stade filming is available.",1359590400,6,2764,4.961123110151188
7901960,5,B0000016TL,"Yes, I have to agree that this 1988 Salzburg production, directed expertly by Viller and performed wonderfully by the entire ensemble under Chailly, is the best La Cenerentola live DVD to-date.
The cast is good, even if not the biggest names.  You would have to 'find out' who they are these days, with perhaps the exception of Ann Murray, who sings the titlerole to great level of musical and dramatic artistry (I like her more than Frederica von Stade), if not outright beating Garanca or Didonato, the two current great Angelinas.
However, it is the 'supporting cast' of Ramiro, Dandini, Clothile and Tisbe as well as Don Magnifico that make this live performance better than any other -
today's almost unknown tenor Francisco Araiza is an even more burnished Don Ramiro than for Abbado in the Ponnelle film 8 years ago (1980). He contrasts well with Gino Quilico's Dandini - Dandini being even more 'princely' outwardly than Ramiro (as accords with the original score), but this Prince has an air of inner authority that Dandini lacks, and this is why Araiza's portrayal is spot on in this performance.
The two sisters are also worthy of mention.  Both are sophisticated yet shallow, good looking yet unkind (who says that the sisters of Angelina are ugly?)
Ann Murray is a very convincing Angelina - she is appropriately austere and mild, yet owning an understated elegance.  Almost as convincing as Elina Garanca in the MET version.
The sets are simply terrific - the best, even if compared to Ponnelle's luxurious film, and the theatrical effect of Ramiro's ride in the storm is stunning - Quilico's Dandini actually falling to the ground with the wild jerks, and Araiza's Ramiro bumped so convincingly in his 'seat'!
Visually, this La Cenerentola is the BEST period production with the Vienna 1994 production of Cosi fan tutte (Muti/Schade/Skovhus/Frittoli/Kirchschlager). Absolutely stunning sets and costumes, no quibble.  We Asians simply love these!",1357689600,6,1961,5.080745341614906
7901961,5,B0000016TL,"Having seen the DiDonato and von Stade DVD productions too, I have no hesitation in proclaiming this my runaway favorite for four reasons: (1) The stage production is saturated with ancien regime consciousness, beginning right at the start when Don Magnifico makes his first appearance.  The daughters treat him with respect and as an authority to be deferred to --- a reigning paterfamilias.  This sets the tone for the opera and signals that status and social class distinctions are in everyone's blood and are of the utmost importance.  This is consistent throughout the production and gives a vital reality to all the snobberies and nose-in-the-air disdain of the two sisters in their treatment of Cinderella and their horror when the ""valet"" (the disguised prince) is proposed as a consolation prize to the loser.  In the other two productions, the father is mainly regarded as a schemer who just happens to be older.  And the supreme importance of the breaking of the class barrier so emphasized by Chailly/Viller is reduced in the other productions to just getting rich and having servants to order around, which is a very different thing.  (2) The stage direction attains the rare heights of a remarkably expressive spatial placement of the six singers that weaves their voices, emotions and gestures into a true aesthetic ensemble with all six singers on camera at once, reacting to one another, rather the camera flitting between three duos, one after the other, with each keeping their separate spaces in a kind of isolation.  Chailly/Villers achieve a true unity where the musical and emotional totality is immensely more than the sum of its parts.  And the ""ancien regime"" worship of social class (granted this is a carryover from the previous century) confers a transcendent meaning to all the interactions, strengthening their cohesion and power.  (When Cinderella arrives at the ball, the royal context is as important as she is.)  This palpable wide social class gap between the impoverished baron & the prince is lacking in the other two productions and their musical fabrics are attenuated.  (3) Chaiily/Villers ravishingly handsome Dandini is blazing with star power and gives the proper bouyant ""lift"" that carries the entire production along, visually and vocally.  We deeply feel his absence in the other two productions.  (4) And Chailly's crisp directing and unerring tempo provides a peerless crown for it all.",1357603200,3,2436,5.152284263959391
