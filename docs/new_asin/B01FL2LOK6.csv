The second target cannot at this time be verified.  However, it is interesting to speculate.  I've been following his work on the Youtube channel Farsight.  His viewing of the Florida shootings is unbelievable; That is in the Time Cross section.  He has a multitude of free remote viewing sessions to see if you're interested enough to buy this one.

They produced this video to be entertaining, not just someone standing at a chalkboard.  I really don't get the comments about this isn't real remote viewing. I think he's been doing this for 30 years.  He was trained by one of the foremost experts in the field for 15 years.  Believe in remote viewing or don't believe in it.  The evidence is compelling.  I think everyone should try it for themselves.  If you enjoy watching Dick Allgire remote view, then you should enjoy this video.  I enjoy watching remote viewing more than this particular subject. His movie, ""The God Particle,"" was one of the most fascinating videos I have ever seen on the subject.  Unfortunately, it is no longer available.",1502496000,,1191,4.845771144278607
8761051,1,B01FL2LOK6,"What nonsense. Can not believe that I wasted time watching yet another tired script copied from countless imaginative renditions of a double sacrificed in the place of Hitler. An advanced remote viewer knows how to navigate the imaginative process whereas the novice as you see here falls victim to it. Why would anyone invest in a production like this? This does not make remote viewing look legitimate.

In fact, there are at least two professional viewers that have completed blind sessions of Hitler's final moments and they all show that he died at his bunker. These viewers have years of experience with encyclopedic knowledge of psychic functioning. Once more, the evidence supports what is commonly accepted by rationale and convention as per the investigative interest immediately following the WWII defeat of Germany by Allied Forces.",1489449600,,844,5.2518518518518515

8761054,3,B01FL2LOK6,"This is a much better piece than the previous ""Hitler the mass murderer"" catastrophic failure produced by Courtney. He is on the front piece too but fortunately doesnt have much say in the actual clip. Basically the session with Dick as operational viewer is very balanced and points in the same direction recently published books about Hitler's escape to Argentina do, largely supporting the stance that one of his doubles did die in the ""bunker"". So far so good, and not really surprising as for the ""initiate"" this was quite certain even before these books where published. There are a lot of German sources, official documents in the Bundesarchiv in Berlin as well as personal interviews, that support it ,so for an German speaking well informed person nothing new is revealed. Overall it only gets 3 stars for lack of a secondary viewer who would make the result more stable (if corroborating results where obtained, usually Daz Smith fills that position) as well as the overarching question: why the obsession with a person long dead, and IF you must look at that time and that place there are much more important questions to find out about, e.g. who really started WW2 and why and whats up with that Auschwitz story? This delving into a personal celebrity storyline is mostly only entertaining, but entirely worthless in any truth-finding aspect with regards to these extremely important years of mostly lied-about history.",1463443200,4,1431,4.99163179916318
