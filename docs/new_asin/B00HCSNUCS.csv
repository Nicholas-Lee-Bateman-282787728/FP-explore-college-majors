8631557,5,B00HCSNUCS,"For everyone who thinks good conversation is a thing of the past, take heart.  Talks About Nothing puts together people with diverse backgrounds, starting with perhaps a thread of shared experience.  These conversations develop and grow into discussions encompassing a wealth of ideas.  There is such courage expressed in the conversation between photographer John Dugdale  and neurologist Oliver Sacks.  Their starting point is sharing their individual loss of physical vision and how that impacts their work and lives.  What is surprising is the humor and inventiveness that both men express, making those of us who listen to the conversation feel not pity for their loss, but a curiosity in their new way of ""seeing,""  That is just one of ten amazing conversations in this DVD set.  Accompanying the discs is a wonderful introductory booklet with the history and timeline of ""zero.""  As the product description notes, this was designed as a web broadcast, so there are some technical glitches.  These are minor, and do not impact the overall quality of content.",1392681600,5,1064,5.169590643274854
