7987159,5,B00008V611,"Luca Ronconi's fascinating production of ""Tosca"" was filmed at the Teatro alla Scala in 2000.  Riccardo Muti conducts a new edition with indisputable, thrilling mastery.  The cast is led by Maria Guleghina, Salvatore Licitra, and Leo Nucci.

Margherita Palli's sets are brilliant:  Somewhat abstract versions of the real-life locales, which blend into each other, and each Act is more chaotic than the last.  Ronconi's production is a refreshing change from the usual, puerile conception of this most theatrical of operas.

Guleghina's Floria Tosca is sympathetic, with a beautiful voice devoid of a real chest register.  Her voice is so mellifluous she is not able to point and ""read"" the lines in the memorable fashion of the sopranos mentioned below.  Licitra is a passionate, boyish Mario Cavaradossi; his early death at the age of forty-three was a tragedy for the Fine Arts.  The veteran Nucci is a highly-effective Baron Scarpia.  While his facial expressions can be distracting in other operas, as the sadistic Baron he is ideal.  Among the smaller roles, Giovanni Battista Parodi is a magnificent Cesare Angelotti.

Elsewhere, among studio recordings of Puccini's beloved work, the 1980 set led by James Levine is arguably the greatest of its many rivals.  Renata Scotto is the most musical and passionate of Toscas, and here she was at her artistic zenith.  Plcido Domingo is, of course, a top-flight Cavaradossi, and Renato Bruson is a precise Scarpia.

Magda Olivero never recorded ""Tosca"" in the studio, but is, in many ways, the greatest of all interpreters of the part.  She first assumed the role in an RAI Concert Version, in 1957, opposite Eugenio Fernandi and Scipio Colombo, and it was published on Compact Discs by Opera Depot (with the assistance of the present writer).  Mme Olivero here sings the score come scritto, to great effect.  She is supremely intense and moving, the greatest of verismo sopranos.  Fernandi (Calf in the EMI recording of ""Turandot"" from three months earlier, with Maria Callas and Dame Elisabeth Schwarzkopf) is a fine, lyrical Mario, and Colombo is one of the greatest recorded Scarpias, malevolent yet not given to shouting pitches in the manner of more famous exponents of the role.

In 1960, RAI made a film (once distributed by the Bel Canto Society) of Mme Olivero in ""Tosca,"" directed by Mario Lanfranchi, erstwhile husband of Anna Moffo.  Here we can see how her entire physique mirrored the music, her arms deployed as that of a great ballerina.  In 1979, she sang her last series of this opera, for the Metropolitan Opera on tour, at the age of sixty-nine.  The performance in Dallas (at which the author was present) was recorded.  Alongside Luciano Pavarotti and Cornell MacNeil (one of the great Scarpias), her voice, now rather small and dry, was nevertheless pure expression.  The acuti were terrifically exciting and the famous parlando effects were tremendous.

Callas was wasted in verismo, as her dominion was in the bel canto works of Rossini, Bellini, and Donizetti.  That said, her famous Tosca is best experienced through her preserved television debut of 1956, when the Metropolitan Opera produced an abridged Act II on ""The Ed Sullivan Show,"" with George London as the Baron and Dino Yannopoulos as stage director.  The brilliant genius Dimitri Mitropoulos conducted.  Without the fussy naturalism foisted on her later by Franco Zeffirelli, Mme Callas is seen here in all her hierarchic, stylized beauty.

Galina Vishnevskaya, on the 1976 set on Deutsche Grammophon (conducted by Mstislav Rostropovich), is the most tempestuous of Floria Toscas.  With a Slavic voice devoid of conventional notions of beauty, she is overwhelming.  Her murder of the Baron (well sung by Matteo Manuguerra) sounds like the real thing.

Another great singing-actress, Anja Silja, recorded excerpts of the opera in German translation in 1966, when Decca was taping an Italian-language version with another soprano.  Recorded in Rome (where the argument occurs), this may be the most unusual recording ever made of ""Tosca."" First, the translation gives the opera a very different quality, and with Mme Silja it acquires an almost Expressionistic flavor. The ""white-flame"" quality of her unique voice is well on display here.  Accompanying her are James King and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau (a demonic Baron).  Piero de Palma is the classic Spoletta, in what may have been his only recording in German.

The only time Mme Silja performed ""Tosca"" on-stage was, nevertheless, in 1975, in Frankfurt, in Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's Italian-language production.  Opera Depot released the audio version, and it is almost unbearably exciting, even with the diva's voice being neither pretty or Italianate.  The conducting of the underrated Klauspeter Seibel is first-rate.

In 2000, Roberto Alagna participated in a film (with Ruggero Raimondi as Scarpia) of ""Tosca,"" conducted by Sir Antonio Pappano.  M.Alagna is a revelation as Mario, as actor and singer.

MacNeil, as noted earlier, is one of the great Scarpias, and his grand conception is perhaps best experienced in the 1978 DVD from the Met, with Shirley Verrett as the prima donna.  An additional treat in this production (staged by Tito Gobbi) is the presence of Robert Sapolsky as an exceptional Shepherd Boy.

Regarding the role of the police agent, Spoletta, Anthony Laciura is a delight in the Met's telecast from 1985, in Zeffirelli's bloated production.  In that company's 2009 version is found the marvelous Paul Plishka as the most engaging Sacristan.

Two singing-actresses admired by the composer left interesting fragments of their interpretations of the diva with the Second Act aria, Lina Cavalieri (1910) and Gilda Dalla Rizza (circa 1928).  How sad that subsequent sopranos remarkable in the role did not leave commercial recordings of the work:  Herva Nelli, Marisa Galvany (whom the present writer saw in the part at the New York City Opera, opposite Harry Theyard), Karan Armstrong, and Natalia Rom.",1501718400,,6013,5.221063607924922
7987160,3,B00008V611,"The singing by the principles is marvelous.  However, the acting leaves much to be desired, especially by Licitra who sings a great deal with his eyes closed and seemingly detached from the moment.  This greatly detracts from an otherwise very good performance.",1367539200,2,261,5.190476190476191
7987161,4,B00008V611,"I won't lie and claim this is the greatest Tosca ever filmed, but it isn't bad either. Riccardo Muti gets wonderful sound with the Teatro alla Scala orchestra. The costuming and scenery look very appropriate. In Scarpia's first scene, the sacristan, minor and major church officials, and the smoking incense will help you feel you're there inside a Napoleonic cathedral. Some may object to what has been called an asymmetrical stage, but the scenery in the cathedral and again in Scarpia's office is luxurious, dark and heavy, as many prefer it to be. The asymmetrical stage perhaps keeps the set from looking boxlike, so I don't really object to it.

I've always believed that for Tosca to succeed, it requires a Scarpia who oozes evil. Leo Nucci sings and acts well, but at least for me he wasn't as evil as I'd have preferred. Perhaps it would be better to describe him as cold and calculating.  Similarly, Salvatore Licitra (Cavaradossi) sings well, but his acting is not convincing. Maria Guleghina, as Tosca, sings and acts very well, but somehow I could never feel the essential love between Tosca and Cavaradossi.

Maybe we've all been spoiled by passionate Toscas like Hildegard Behrens and wicked, leering Scarpias like Cornell MacNeil. This is a very good production of Tosca. It just falls short of great",1267315200,2,1316,4.918918918918919
7987162,1,B00008V611,"Guleghina usually makes anything look good, but this time she had to suffer the worst sets and the worst stage direction I've ever seen in my life. The annoying skewed sets brought to mind a bad hangover, bent glasses, or my worst migraine. I found myself unable to ignore the tenor's exclusive attention  to the promptor's box, and in spite of the nice voice and a passionate

situation,""Cavaradossi"" never connected with ""Tosca"".  (I longed for  Tosca to sing ""hey, I'm over here"" while the prompter's box was being adored; learning one's role is a minimal requirement for praiseworthy performance, and even Pavorati was bad about that.)  Finally, the last scene-a ridiculously long flight of stairs for Tosca to climb, with skirt hitched up and audience wondering if she would make it, to end the worst version of Tosca I've ever seen. Bummer.",1112832000,13,846,4.929577464788732
7987163,5,B00008V611,"No matter what the naysayers have said, I absolutely loooved this performance. First of all let me say that the production was amazing. The sets are very grand in the Roman tradition. Luca Ronconi's abstract sets are brilliant and mirror the internal conflicts of the three principles. In addition, operatic productions tend to amount to little more than banal fare when interpreted in the same traditional way all the time. It is so refreshing to have different fresh voiced singers for these demanding roles. It is such a wonderful change to see a production without Domingo in it. Though talented, he's never been a particular favorite of mine. His voice always sounds tired, worn, and under pressure. I'm frankly tired of seeing him, he's in everything!!!! Salvatore Licitra sings Cavaradossi with simply brilliant tone, and phenomenal acting. The Scarpia of Leo Nucci is probably the most sadistic and terrifying portrayal I have seen since Tito Gobbi and Ruggiero Raimondi. His facial expressions are unbelievable!!!!! Finally, we have the Tosca of the formidable dramatic soprano Maria Guleghina, who simply shines in this role. She is the only current Tosca alongside Angela Gheorghiu and Daniela Dessi who is totally convincing vocally, physically, and dramatically. I believe Tosca requires both power and beauty. It is not enough just to have authoritative high notes, but also lush vocalism. Tosca cannot be done full justice by a soprano who squawks and screeches her way through the role. Guleghina's voice is simply gorgeous and full bodied like a finely aged wine. Her acting is well thought out and tightly controlled so that she doesn't portray Tosca as a selfish monster like so many singers do, but a decent human being beneath all the surface grandeur. Her Vissi D'arte is infused not only with power, but with an emotional pull that comes from the gut. Muti and the La Scala forces are equally brilliant!!!!!!Do yourself a favor and check out the Tosca of Daniela Dessi now on DVD, a first class artist with a hint of Callas thrown in for good measure!!!",1100217600,29,2076,5.0202898550724635
