2682136,5,B000K2JU36,All I want to know is when is this movie comming to DVD ?,1157155200,,57,3.142857142857143
2682137,4,B000K2JU36,"A crazy but tightly-knit family is the plot for this screwball comedy. Billie Burke plays the eccentric mother, one of her most popular characters. She is constantly transforming begging tramps from her doorstep into butlers and cheauffers. In this case, it is Brian Aherne, a sophisticated man who isn't really a tramp at all. Constance Bennett is the beautiful oldest daughter who begins to have feelings for the new cheauffer despite dating another man. Bonita Granville plays the annoying younger sister quite well and rounds out the cast.

This film feels very similar to My Man Godfrey, and in fact, some of the bits of the film are even better than the beloved classic. It is very funny, especially the telephone scenes and the grand finale.

This particular version is not perfect. The sound quality isn't great; one has to turn up the volume quite a bit to hear the movie. Also, the picture has artifacts and is fuzzy due to years of neglect. However, it is still highly watchable and is expected of a film without a formal release.",1157068800,,1041,4.777777777777778
2682138,5,B000K2JU36,"This has to be one of the funniest forgotten movies.  The sets and costumes are fabulous and the cast works extremely well together.  The family dogs are two great danes named ""Get Off the Rug"" and ""You Too.""  Since I don't want to spoil the ending let me just say that the portion that involves getting water and ammonia from the kitchen through a swinging door is one of the funniest scenes ever.  I've seen it many times and still laugh!",1153267200,,440,4.395061728395062

2682140,3,B000K2JU36,"The true star of this film is the doozy....the car. The car is a Duesenberg and they put it in as many scenes as possible. I don't blame'em. It's a cool car. The movie however is not as good. The story isn't bad but the simple facts they screwed up is tough to get over. The main character, the bum who comes to the door, suddenly decides to pretend to be the bum he is mistaken for and not the distinguished writer he really is. Why would he do this? That alone turned me off. Next, his speech and look was not what it should have been. I could go on. This movie was highly recommended to me but....",1495152000,,600,4.050420168067227

2682145,4,B000K2JU36,"It must first be said that the DVD is avalable through an independent company using old stock, therefore the copy is variable. No matter.
The cast alone make the film worth reviving. Brian Aherne and Constance Bennett are two delightful but underrated stars of the black and white era and they have great rapport. Alan Mowbray, Patsy Kelly, Ann Dvorak,Bonita Granville and others are all stalwart support actors I remember from decades ago, but the star here is Clarence Kolb as the father. His drunk scene is a tour de force whilst in the final fiasco he takes some genuine and possibly painful tumbles. The film starts with one or two fussy and unfunny scenes but picks up with the arrival of Brian Aherne. There are two great danes which earn their keep by their names alone, 'Get off the rug' and 'You too'. A pleasure to have a film where the humour doesn't depend on filthy language.",1484524800,,889,4.632911392405063

2682147,5,B000K2JU36,"Campy over-acting of early romance comedies but, still, a really cute movie. The mansion is disproportionate with gigantic rooms on the inside for what you see on the outside. I'm telling you this because this movie was not made yesterday, it was made in 1938. The actors have great off-camera personal history and worth learning about. It is my first Constance Bennet movie but I think I've seen her and her 2"" eyelashes in old Classic Bugs Bunny Cartoons. Brian Aherne is so handsome -- a perfect combo of Cary Grant and Errol Flynn, one of the best looking actors of all time. Yes, that's Glenda-the-Good-Witch, Billie Burke as the dingy mom. The servants are interesting, too. The snooty butler, played by British Alan Mowbray, was typecast in a long career of playing British butlers. Patsy Kelly, one of the maids, acted in many comedic roles and she does have some great lines in this movie. Off camera, she had an interesting life.

I liked this movie. I watched it several times after I got it but, I'll confess, it was to look at Brian Aherne ... over and over again.

BTW, this was an Academy Award nominated movie, five nominations.",1482019200,3,1144,4.686567164179104

2682151,5,B000K2JU36,"This is a delightful, but largely forgotten and overlooked, 1930s screwball comedy. For me, one of the best. Grapevine Video has probably done the best they could with the quality of their source material, although TCM shows a much better print. But it should be pointed out that this product is a DVD-R. I didn't find that information anywhere in the listing.
Update: I have since ordered the version from Nostalgia Family. It actually has excellent image quality, and I recommend it highly. It's also a DVD-R, which isn't specified in the listings. For some reason, the Nostalgia Family name only appears in Amazon's product specifications, but not on the disc or case. I'll still wait and hope for a high quality factory pressed version but, in the meantime, the Nostalgia Family version will do very nicely.",1463443200,3,811,4.927007299270073
2682152,4,B000K2JU36,"This is a great and very funny movie, but it was made so by the following actors. The actors in question are Constance Bennett, Brian Aherne, Billie Burk, Clarence Kolb and two who were not given top billing Bonita Granville ( Nancy Drew), and Willie Best. This is a 94 minute blast. It is all action with no down time and I love this type movie. Get this one and enjoy 94  minutes of pure fun.",1456876800,,394,4.184210526315789

 This was one of the FUNNIEST movies I've seen in a very long time. I laughed out loud, not a ""chuckle"", not a ""giggle"" but an all out, wipe the tears from laughing so hard guffaw! It was great!!
I've always seen Clarence Kolb in other movies as, ""the hard"" guy or shyster but in his part as the father of this family of loons, I'm thinkin' he was the head loon. There was one scene where he showed off physical humor that I've never seen in him in other movies and what was MORE surprising was he could do it at his age!
This is INDEED a hidden comedic treasure! Truly a ""MUST HAVE"" in anyone's personal classic library.

2682174,5,B000K2JU36,"Great ensemble acting. A typical screwball comedy from the late 30's, well-written, full of gags and one-liners that keep you laughing throughout. The copy is not in pristine condition but I am grateful I have been able to see it. Films such as this, as good as this one is, are hard to come by. For me, this is a great example of ensemble acting. Virtually all performers give their best here: Clarence Kolb, Billie Burke, Alan Mowbray, Marjorie Rambeau, Bonita Granville, Brian Aherne and Constance Bennett are simply delightful, a treasure trove of unique talents brought together in a sort of miraculous piece of casting.",1415404800,,625,4.90566037735849

Brian Aherne, an almost forgotten star of the Golden Age, was at the peak of his beauty and talent. Constance Bennett was never lovelier or funnier. If you are a lover of screwball, this is seminal!

Some have said that it is a MY MAN GODFREY copy, but it isn't. Forgotten men, tramps, or hobos were a common theme in all aspects of post-depression/ dust bowl art and literature.",1414886400,,521,4.427083333333333

I highly recommend the movie as a fun and family friendly film. I know my brother would never watch it, he won't watch anything not in color! His loss!

  The issue that kept it from being an out of the park home run was the quality of the video. It had some parts where the picture was degraded and certainly wasn't from the same transfer as on TCM. While I wish the quality was better I do realize this movie was made in the early 30s and there are probably some unrestored and less than perfect reels left.

2682195,4,B000K2JU36,"I first saw this 1938 black and white movie on Turner Classic Movies and enjoyed it so much that  I decided to buy my own DVD.  The only drawback is disappointment that the clarity quality of my DVD does not match what I saw on TCM.

This is a lighthearted comedy, where each cast member is perfect for his or her role.

Billie Burke, of Wizard of Oz Good Witch fame, plays a dizzy wife/mother who has a habit of hiring hobos who then rob the house and disappear. Alan Mowbray plays the butler who has a suitable histrionic response when he finds that the latest miscreant has made off with the household's silverware and he has to serve breakfast using kitchen utensils in place of cutlery.  His 'perfect butler' reaction to all the craziness going on around him is what makes the film so enjoyable

Constance Bennett plays the glamorous daughter who tries to kick out the next man (Brian Aherne) to knock on the door, mistaking him for yet another hobo.  He, however, just wants to use the phone but dizzy mother hires him as the family chauffeur.  Handsome Aherne soon wins the heart of Bennett, who tries her best not to let him know.

Clarence Kolb is the irascible father, at his most endearing when returning home in the early hours drunk as a skunk. Kolb has my respect for being able to stagger backwards down some stairs without breaking his neck.

The mischievous teenager is played by Bonita Granville - a role rather beneath her talents - but played well, as she did everything in her career.

My favorite characters are the two gorgeous and friendly Great Danes, Get off the Rug and You Too.

This movie reminds me of 'You Can't Take it with You,' which also has a family full of unique, quirky characters, although a movie with perhaps more substance than 'Merrily.'  Nonetheless, if you want to relax for 90 minutes and have a good laugh or two, 'Merrily We Live' will fill the bill.",1368489600,2,1899,4.517543859649122

Alas, I soon frgot the name of it and so it was lost to me for many years until I happened to see it on TCM.  It's been called part of the screwball comedy genre, but I still think it's in a class of it's own.  Of course it's sheer silliness but I delight in it over and over again.  Billie Burke is fabulous.  For all those years it was lost to me all I could remember about it was that the family's dogs were named ""Get Off The Rug!"" and ""You, Too!""

It is a lighthearted comedy/romance, with a fun cast, & the overall production of this film is good enough that I am willing to give it a 4 star rating.
  If you are a collector, I would buy this version, at least until a properly re-mastered version is available.
  That being said,(you really have to be a fan of these actors, and this type of story), it is easy to get involved enough that the focus problem becomes unimportant as the story progresses.
 Typical 1930's screwball sometimes compared to My Man Godfrey, probably because the general story has to do with a supposed tramp (Brian Aherne), going to live in a very wealthy household, full of nit-wit family members including Constance Bennett & Billie Burke.

2682205,5,B000K2JU36,"A lighthearted comedy, with some screwball eccentricities, and great one-liners' (`Darling, my mother always said children should be seen and not heard'....`Yes but your mother was smarter than my mother'). A family that *thinks* the new visitor to their door is a tramp, who the mother takes in and gives the job of chauffeur much to the chagrin of the rest of the family. The tramp is not really a tramp at all, but plays along purely for the enjoyment of watching the antics of this eccentric family and because he has taken a liking to the eldest daughter.
I first saw this movie when I was 13, I stayed up all night to record it to VHS off the TV when it played at 1 AM. Since then I have been searching forever for this movie on DVD, so happy to have finally found it! BUT, what a disappointment that one of the best scenes is CUT OUT! There are a handful of scenes where someone is on the telephone, but *the* scene I am referring to is the one where just about everyone in the house is on the main home line at the same time and the conversation is hilarious. I don't want to keep buying different copies of this movie to simply find the one that is uncut, but I did notice that the copy on Amazon states it is 90 minutes run time, whereas other online retailers have it listed as 95 minutes run time....is that the missing telephone scene I wonder?",1319241600,3,1357,4.284046692607004
2682206,3,B000K2JU36,"This DVD version is definitely not restored. I had to crank the volume to hear the audio and the picture is grainy. Another thing--and I don't know the proper term--is that the background ""jumps."" It is like the film is two-layered, with things in the foreground steady, while things in the background, like curtains on windows, jerk and jump. If anyone is familiar with a term for this effect--and I've seen it on other poor DVD transfers of classic movies--please let me know.

The movie studio ID is missing from the front of the picture, like a bootleg copy. I see the ""MGM"" logo in the fine print with the copyright. Was MGM the studio that produced this? Above the movie title is ""Favorite Films."" I've never heard of that company. Can anyone enlighten me with some background?

Everybody in the film (with the exception of the wonderful Billie Burke) seemed to be trying too hard to be light and charming, it just became grating.  A ""My Man Godfrey"" wannabe, it's the type of farce I find most annoying.  Everything could be straightened out in two seconds if anyone would listen to a one line explanation of the central misunderstanding.  Even in froth like this, I like a little more complication.

Situations seemed forced but if the people in it appeal to you, it's innocuous enough.  Bonita Granville's type I also found very annoying (the obnoxious teenager constantly stirring the pot) but I loved Alan Mowbray's butler, bags packed and ready to go. . . and go. . .and go!  I sometimes think he appeared in every film ever made!  LOL

It's not bad, just not great and probably most appreciated by those who love the stars involved and don't mind the total lack of sense.",1313107200,,1094,4.6217616580310885

Suffice it to say, it's very similar to (and I doubt it's an accident) My Man Godfrey, and, although it comes close, not quite as good.  If you have never seen Godfrey, you should check that one out too.  However what is here is wonderful.  The cast, the sets, the wonderful almost throw-away moments, ie: the family struggling to eat breakfast with kitchen utensils after the butler has made off with the silver, and my favorite, father after a drunken night with his friends attempting to maneuver his way up the stairs to his room.

2682209,4,B000K2JU36,"I liked Merrily We Live for a film that's simply entertaining and humorous.  The plot isn't anything great, but luckily there are enough funny situations played out by interesting characters to make this worth while, provided you aren't seeking a movie with a strong storyline.  (For the record, there is a plot, but some turn of events are rather silly...then again, it is a comedy.)  For simple entertainment, it's pretty good.  Constance Bennett gives a strong performance but has to share the screen with too many other side characters, so we don't get to see her as much as we'd like.  It's always great to see Billie Burke, and she plays her usual funny self.  Bonita Granville wins the award for the cuteness factor in this film.  Too many characters to mention in a brief review like this.  Audio and video quality are good in my version.  Overall, even though I thought the plot could be thought out a bit more, made a bit more clever, I still rate this positively as a result of good acting and funny, cute situations.",1297641600,,1028,4.6353591160221

- Rawlins: ""Not yet. Only got here this morning.""

Rarely shown and not much known, 1938's MERRILY WE LIVE will for sure slap you upside the funny bone. That is, if you ever get a chance to watch it. This screwball comedy reunites producer Hal Roach with Constance Bennett, Billie Burke, and director Norman Z. McLeod, who all worked on the very successful TOPPER the year before. MERRILY WE LIVE was pooh-poohed mightily by the critics and the snooty ones for too closely echoing MY MAN GODFREY's premise. But so what? Yes, leading man Brian Aherne, in his polish and wit, is sort of a younger carbon copy of William Powell and Constance Bennett a more grounded version of Carole Lombard. MERRILY WE LIVE sparkles on the strength of its witty script and fine performances.

This is a wealthy but pretty kooky family, the Kilbournes, and none more loopy than Mrs. Kilbourne. In her own fashion, Mrs. Kilbourne (Billie Burke) is on a mission to reform society's lawless and seedy downtrodden. As such, she tends to take on ex-cons and vagabonds as family servants. It's an uphill struggle, though, as exemplified by her last hire, who's already scampered with the family silver (and the butler's shoes and socks). You'd think she'd have learned her lesson, but, not too long after, at the doorstep comes unkempt - but charming - writer Wade Rawlins (Brian Aherne), who'd just had his car break down (then it rolled down a hill). Merely wanting to use the telephone, the bemused Rawlins is mistaken for a tramp by Mrs. Kilbourne and is promptly hired on as the new driver. Rawlins decides to stick around and it's not too long before this sensible ""forgotten man"" (what bums used to be called during the Depression) begins to make an impact on the household...and especially on the gorgeous but icy Geraldine, or 'Jerry', Kilbourne (Constance Bennett).

MERRILY WE LIVE may be a hidden gem, but it's one of those films which is simply non-stop funny. Two of the most hilarious bits: Rawlins tries to assist a just arrived and very inebriated Mr. Kilbourne, who staggers up one stairway only to reel his way down the other stairway (and backwards!). Then there's that oh-so-manic, gut-busting kitchen sequence near the film's end (trust me, you will crack up!).

Constance Bennett and Brian Aherne are fabulous as the romantic leads. Both ooze sophistication and wit and are very likable, with Aherne nearly rivaling Powell in the wry and urbane department. Billie Burke as the fluttery mother was good enough to be nominated for Best Supporting Actress, although she didn't win. S'okay, though, as she would be immortalized the next year as Glinda the Good in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wizard-of-Oz-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B000ADS63K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wizard of Oz (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>. There's a sighting of Bonita Granville as Jerry's high-spirited younger sister, who owns two Great Danes with awesome names, ""Get Off the Rug"" and ""You Too"". Bonita would go on to star as teen detective Nancy Drew in four pictures. Meanwhile, Alan Mowbray makes me smile as the butler who constantly threatens to quit at the smallest slight.

I love, friggin' love, old films. And, by old films, I don't mean stuff that came out in the 1980s. I'm so grateful Turner Classic Movies is still going strong on cable (TCM is where I caught this film). MERRILY WE LIVE is an appealing, if not so celebrated, representative of the wonderful screwball comedy genre. And more people should see it. You should see it.",1209600000,13,3652,5.1003344481605355
2682215,5,B000K2JU36,"I recently saw this movie on cable TV.  I don't remember much
of it.....but reading the other reviews here has made me recall
a bit more than I had before starting this review.  Yes...Brian
Aheren was great as the novelist mistaken for a servant....and
was that really Bonita Granville as the peppy daughter of the
houswe?  (Loved her as Nancy Drew in other old films....anyone
know what has happened to her?)

Oh!  For the days when even upper-middle class people could
afford a bevy of servants!  Abd eveb lower-middle class people
had at least one servant!  (Sigh!)

The one thing I DO remember from this movie is the KITCHEN SET!
The set designer in the film deserves(d) an Oscar for sure --
though I don't know if they had them then.  Large, inviting,
airy, flooded with light and conveniences!  Yards and yards of
shelf space!  And the laundry is in it's own little room, right
off the kitchen!  I have seen few, if any, ""modern"" kitchens
which can compare!  If I ever get very, very rich, THIS kitchen
will certainly be amongst the ideas I will use to build mine!

If for nothing else, see this film for the kitchen set, alone!
You can get some (even if not all) ideas for your own kitchen from
it!

I've got to look up the name of that set designer -- if I can find
it.  He or she was a genuis, with designs decades and decades ahead
of the time this movie was made!",1193270400,5,1374,4.371541501976284

2682218,5,B000K2JU36,"This delightful and zany film from MGM is one of the great forgotten examples of screwball comedy. An amazing cast and fine direction from Norman Z. McLeod make this little-known film a real gem.

Constance Bennett may have shortened her own career by being difficult to work with but shows here why her swanky sophistication, touched with sweetness, made her such a huge and sought after star during the 1930's. Young Bonita Granville, always a favorite, also gets to shine as her younger sister.

Bille Burke gives another in a long string of delightful performances as their daffy mom who has a penchant for taking in tramps in an effort to reform them. Brian Aherne as her latest project and Alan Mowbray as their put-upon butler would steal any other film but everyone else is so good here that their topflight antics blend right in. Add a great song from Phil Charig and Arthur Quenzer and you have a screwball masterpiece.

Brian Aherne is novelist Wade Rawlins. When the car he rented gives out and then goes over the side of a mountain he stumbles upon the Kilborne mansion only to use the phone but is soon drafted by Emily Kilborne (Billie Burke) to be her latest project, much to the consternation of the entire family, especially the butler, Grosvener (Alan Mowbray). An exasperated Rawlins (Aherne) soon gives up trying to use the phone and plays along.

Soon all the sevants love him and young Marion (Bonita Granville), who sells info to the rest of the family for two bits a pop, has a huge crush. But it may be real love for swanky Geraldine, who slowly warms to the charms of the tramp who cleans up nice. Bennett is sweet and fabulous here and looks as good as she plays in outfits by Irene. Her scene pretending to lose her key so Rawlins will help her through the window will have you smiling.

When a senator's young daughter named Minerva (Ann Dvorak) takes a shine to the Kilborne's new ""guest"" Geraldine gets jealous and plays domestic by making fudge with pickles in an attempt to seem more desirable. There is a hilarious scene as Rawlins trades crazy gestures with a smitten Granville standing behind Geraldine, who just looks confused and somewhat amused.

Screwball also had charm, and this one has it in droves. Only in a screwball comedy would someone who's just had a pail of water splashed in their face jump into the arms of the perpetrator and respond with: ""I knew you loved me!"" This is a wonderful film that is light and delightful and a splendid time capsule of this genre of film during the 1930's. They don't make films like this anymore and they don't build 'em like Bennett anymore either. Film fans don't want to miss this one!",1173571200,36,2673,4.628691983122363
