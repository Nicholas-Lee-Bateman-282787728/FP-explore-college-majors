4953029,4,B0064RCDPI,"I like this series, but enjoy it more in small doses, ie 1-2 episodes per sitting. Joan is always sharp and fun, however the series also shows very personal and touching interactions within their family group (incl friends and staff).",1335916800,,234,4.875
4953030,5,B0064RCDPI,"This entire season will have you laughing your butt off. Joan Rivers is a true and one and only entertainment icon. Her sharp wit and slick sense of humor is truly one of a kind. Her and daughter Melissa along with grandson Cooper embark on a wild ride throughout the whole show... So glad that slimy grease ball Jason is not on the rest of Season 2. He is super gross, annoying and a waste of air. Otherwise this is for any true fan of comedy/reality/JOAN RIVERS!!!",1331337600,9,466,4.367816091954023
4953031,5,B0064RCDPI,"My guess is you either LOVE Joan Rivers (as I do) or you don't......So If you are not a Rivers fan This will only annoy you, HOWEVER for those that are fans, you will LOVE LOVE LOVE this Dvd! Joan is still as funny as ever and I have really come to like and respect her daughter Melissa through this show as well. I am not totally sure how ""Un Scripted"" this all is, but who cares it's funny!!!!!!!!!!!",1329609600,6,402,4.10126582278481
4953032,4,B0064RCDPI,"How many times have you been forced to watch videos of someone's annoying kid  because the parent finds their child so fascinating but they're only fascinating to the parent?  Well that is my take on Joan Rivers view of her daughter, Melissa.

I am a Joan Rivers fan.  I respect the longevity of her career and believe her to be a bright and talented comedienne and businesswoman.  What I do have a problem with is the foisting of Melissa Rivers on the general public.  I do understand that many celebs spawn children who go on to become celebs in their own right and some of them actually have genuine talent or something the general public wants to see but for the life of me, I don't understand why Joan has insisted for years in trying to make Melissa an on screen personality. Melissa, who seems to be an intelligent and well educated person just does not belong in front of the camera.  It's cool that Mom gives her producing jobs and has included her in her fashion critiquing shows but honestly would Melissa be anywhere in the entertainment biz as a personality if not for her Mom?  I've never seen a celebrity Mom who has gone through such lenghths to make her daughter into something she is not.  With that said, it's an enjoyable show even with Melissa.",1328659200,5,1265,4.5131578947368425

4953036,5,B0064RCDPI,"the only reason i would watch this is because of the Iconic Joan Rivers, although when she was alive she would not consider herself an icon or brilliant but she is.  She might not be a successful actress as she would have like to but her true genius is being witty-cally Funny.  Nonetheless she is also a very sensitive person and you will feel for her any minute!! GOD SHE WILL BE TRULY MISSED!!",1411516800,,396,4.337837837837838

4953043,5,B0064RCDPI,"I really hope the complete series is released soon now that the late great Joan has passed.
The show is really funny and though it's a bit scripted there are many real moments and Joan is hilliarious as always.
I'm sad that not only Joan is gone but there won't be anymore sweet funny moments between she and Melissa.
Their chemistry just worked so well and now it brings tears to my eyes. RIP Lady Joan",1402531200,,403,4.315789473684211
4953044,5,B0064RCDPI,Joan a hoot as always. Never looses that Hugh comic sometimes down & dirty moth of hers. But she is great with her grandson cooper. She is one heck of a grandma. Watch her interact with him. You see a whole different Joan.,1388880000,,222,4.186046511627907
4953045,5,B0064RCDPI,"my mother and i watch this show together. we can relate to it a lot.  each episode is memorable and priceless. if you ask my mom and I which episode we favored it would have to be the one where ""joan looks for love""- the Jerome scene is the best. joan ends up riding a motorcycle with peter tilden's doing. my mom and i laugh in admiration so much because it reminds us of our dear aunt phil (who died at age 96 a few years ago) who loved to ride as a passenger on her family member's motorcycle while sipping some flavored brandy no less. yet, that in itself might be a story for another day.:) in any event, even though joan is much younger than aunt phil, the spunky spirit still remains the same. yolo!! (you only live once.) WE LOVE YOU JOAN AND MELISSA!!! purchase and enjoy!!",1385078400,4,782,4.213333333333333
4953046,5,B0064RCDPI,"who doesn't love Joan Rivers?
really funny, yes some crazy stuff staged for entertainment in this reality series, but all the more to love her outrageousness and obsession to entertain us!",1374451200,2,188,5.096774193548387
4953047,5,B0064RCDPI,"I loove this show. I HAD to have it on DVD. As usual Joan is hilarious!
Season 2 DVD... Where is it?! WHERE IS SEASON 2 on DVD ?!?!?!?!!!!!!!!!",1369699200,,143,3.9655172413793105
4953048,5,B0064RCDPI,"I Love the dynamics between this mother and daughter. They may fight and bicker over just about everything, but in the end you know that they are always there for one another. It is a very enjoyable show.",1366848000,4,204,4.394736842105263
4953049,5,B0064RCDPI,"Although I was never really a Joan Rivers fan, I am taking a renewed interest since this show began.  Joan is hilarious and Melissa is a witty, patient, indulging daughter.  Keep going, ladies!",1366243200,2,193,4.818181818181818
4953050,5,B0064RCDPI,"Very funny - there is only one Joan Rivers and if you like her humor - this series is for you.  Melissa is a good straight man, but in no way in her Mom's league.",1359849600,2,162,3.6285714285714286
4953051,5,B0064RCDPI,"I have been watching Joan Rivers for several years. I love this series and looking forward to watching the next season, which I will purchase as well when it comes out in DVD.",1358899200,2,175,4.333333333333333
4953052,5,B0064RCDPI,"This is probably my all time favorite series. A friend introduced me and I love, love, love it!! I laugh, I cry, I blush!!",1358035200,2,122,4.125
8492828,5,B0064RCDPI,"I feel such sadness when I watch these episodes again. I was a fan of the show when it ran and before Joan's untimely and unnecessary passing. If not for alleged malpractice, Joan would likely be here today, still filming with Melissa. But at least we have the four full seasons she gave us. I'm also sad that I never got to meet her, even though I live just a few blocks from her NY apartment location. Believe me, I always looked for her when out and about.

Joan was a genius. She was funny, generous to every person in her life and honest while pushing boundaries that opened doors for so many women coming up behind her.  This show is a perfect example of Joan's genius. To me, this seems partially scripted and partially improved based on specific situations. There is a touching moment in one of the earlier episodes where Joan takes her grandson to the beach saying how important it was for her to create memories for him. That made me tear up watching it now.

Joan's passing was such a tragedy because it didn't need to be. For an 80-year-old, she was younger than people half her age in every way. She had a lot of pride in her work, in her appearance and she helped so many people (if you haven't seen Joan: A Piece of Work, you should). Joan was grateful for everything in her life despite having suffered a good amount of personal tragedy over the years. I think this is what I loved about her more than anything else.

Part of the fun of this show's fun is in trying to figure out what's scripted and what's not. For example, Melissa has a big, beautiful Malibu House, yet Joan is sent to a small basement guest room. That I'm sure was staged because there had to be a nicer room in the house for her mother and she certainly would have thought about her mom visiting and would have planned for this. Also, when Joan gives away Melissa's ugly furniture, that also had to be fake because Melissa's furniture was so un-Melissa if you compare with the style in the rest of the house.

But the partial scripting is part of the genius of Joan and the situations presented are really really funny. So, if you've never seen an episode of this show, please try to see some of it. I guarantee you'll want to see the entire series.

Recommend.",1477612800,2,2248,4.366028708133971
8492829,5,B0064RCDPI,Such a wonderful show. Joan is such a delight. Can't wait for season two.,1469923200,,73,4.285714285714286

8492835,5,B0064RCDPI,"I adored Joan before, but had never watched her show until after she passed.  This is my go-to for many, many laughs!  It's warm, it's beautiful, you will laugh, and you will cry.  A must see!",1419811200,,192,4.277777777777778
8492836,5,B0064RCDPI,"Joan was truly unique and a real jem. Yes, she could be crude but I loved it when she said ""I actually say what other people are only thinking."" I miss her and always will. God bless Melissa and Cooper and their business staff. This cd is full of laughs....and that is what Joan wanted...for everyone to get past her death and laugh again. She left behind a legacy of love and laughter.",1419292800,3,386,4.301369863013699
8492837,5,B0064RCDPI,"Firstly, it is so much bittersweet fun to see Joan alive and well..and funny as hell!!  I miss her more than I could possibly imagine ever missing somebody I never met; any other celebrity dies and not so terrible to me, with her, I cry each day.  However it is such a pleasure watching this reality show which I never knew existed until AFTER Joan's (probably unwarranted) demise.  She was so full of life and told Melissa when she dies nobody will say not so young but really eighty one on her is truly youthful!  She's fantastic and doing at least five things at once and suddenly she is not with us.  THE REALITY SHOW TRULY TRULY ROCKS!  It absolutely kicks ass and Joan is the heartbeat behind everything and by that I mean while everybody else is great without Joan this show wouldn't be the success that it is; Joan breathes life into everything, she is of course funny beyond words however she is also a sweetheart.  She so obviously adores her daughter,, Melissa, and has a beautiful bonding as well with her grandson, Cooper and they, her.  Joan has always wanted to be regarded as an actress and taken seriously that way. She is!  Because this reality show runs like it is totally real yet I know Joan and since her death I have studied and watched everything on her and she is a perfectionist; when she went on a talk show she knew precisely the whole layout of what she'd say and tell the host what they should please ask so by the same token I have to believe in all probability that she knew Melissa's boyfriend was living there and just about everything else about to happen.  This is what you call scripted but you'd never know it to watch it; you'd only believe it knowing Joan.  She does not leave anything to chance in her career and I only wish she was as precise with her own procedures; that last one should have been done in a hospital and I do not blame Melissa for suing so she can get to the bottom of everything.  Joan died leaving behind a massive string of broken hearts first and foremost with her own private family and friends and beyond that with celebrities and fans; everyone the whole wide world over.  She kept it under wraps how truly kind and generous she has been through her lifetime to so many.  Of course, I will never know for sure if this is scripted or not but if it is it doesn't matter; it has that genuine feeling of spontaneity and beyond that it is absolutely hilarious and a blast to still be able in some wondrous way to spend time with Joan who in many cases does in fact know best!  HUGELY RECOMMENDED!",1414886400,,2558,4.367088607594937
