208217,5,6162251012,"I have seen this on MNet (All things Asian coooooooool!) Anyway, I have travelled abroad a bit and I enjoy the cultural things that shine through this series. Folks from the U.S. may not get some of the references (even though there are subtitles) or really appreciate it, but this is a very charming series. I'm older than their target audience, but nevertheless I bought this and the companion soundtrack w/photo book (all text in Korean) and love it. it is so refreshing over the garbage that American TV now produces.

Enjoy!",1391385600,7,529,4.75
208218,4,6162251012,"This is about an extremely introverted girl, Go Dok Mi, who locks herself away in her apartment from the rest of the world. Scarred from her past she is afraid to venture out and socialize. However a young man, Enrique Geum, comes into her life after he catches her spying on his relative (who lives in the apartment across from hers) with binoculars. Enrique is a quirky, cheerful, outgoing, yet childish guy. After many attempts to get Go Dok Mi out of the apartment, little by little he's able to get her to come out of her shell. All the while both of them are falling for each other. But this isn't just a romantic comedy about these two. She also has a bunch of flower boy neighbors with their own quirks and problems, as well as some classmates from her past show up making things even more crazy.

This is a light, heartfelt, romantic comedy. It's creative, but slow-paced. It's a great show to watch, especially for introverts like me. I could definitely relate to Go Dok Mi. I laughed and cried through this show.",1390176000,2,1023,4.5

208221,5,6162251012,I love Park Shin Hye and she was really good in FBND.  Great chemistry and a lot of faces I recognized from other dramas.  An original plot for a drama and it was a good combination of humorous and dramatic - those are my favorites.  It is a drama you should not miss!,1384300800,2,268,4.018867924528302
208222,5,6162251012,"I absolutely love Flower Boys Next Door.  The characters, the storyline, the actors.  It's funny, sad, heartbreaking and romantic.  It makes you want to yell at the TV.  It makes you need some tissues at various points.  I love it when a show makes me laugh out loud, shake my fingers at the evil characters, tear up at the sad parts and get all warm and fuzzy during the romantic parts.

I'm now a big fan of Yoon Shi Yoon.  Check him out in Baker King Kim Tak Gu and I Am A Flower Too.  Awesome performances, script and overall excellent series.

I didn't like the fact that the recording that I got was ripped from TVN.  I could tell because the TVN logo was on the screen.  Along with a ""2013 Happy New Year"" bug!  (""bug"" is what they call the logos, etc. that proliferate your tv viewing area) It also had the scrolling news tape at the bottom to annoy me.  Some of the subtitles were so large they literally covered the bottom half of the screen.  I will try to locate this again sometime and hopefully it will be a clean recording.  Although that will mean it will cost a small fortune to purchase, but it's worth it.",1377561600,4,1124,4.260663507109005
208223,5,6162251012,I really love this drama! It's become one of my favorites. This became an early birthday present for me and I was so excited that it came in less than a week that I ordered it! I really like the quality and the subs are great! I love the actors in this drama especially the leads and the couple is so cute in this drama I hope to see this paring again in a future drama. Also the ending scene in the last episode is amazing! I don't want to say more in fear of spoiling it for others!,1377216000,3,484,3.898989898989899
208224,5,6162251012,"I have been a fan of Park Shin Hye over the years and she doesn't dissappoint  in this drama either.  Yoon Shi Yoon as Errique Guem really makes the story.  His acting skills are perfect for his role.  He is boyish, seemingly immature, charming, caring and loveable. I don't want to spoil the experience by giving out all the details.  Just sit back and enjoy!",1377129600,3,360,4.476923076923077

The actors are incredible and funny; I especially love the lead characters Park Shin Hye and Yoon Shi Yoon portrayed; it's true, opposites do attract!!  This movie possesses one of the most unforgettable kissing scenes ever; EVER!! Hope to see more of the lead actors in future projects together. Enjoy.",1375401600,4,447,5.208333333333333
