3955378,5,B002N5KVA4,"Josh Blue is hilarious and i would love to see more. i can't seem to find enough of his acts. When watching ""7 more days in the tank"" you will laugh the entire time. It is great that he can take a negative(his condition) and turn it into something positive. If you enjoy comedy I definitely recommend Josh Blue.",1302566400,5,311,4.288135593220339
3955379,4,B002N5KVA4,"I saw Josh on Last Comic Standing and was fascinated at his ability to poke fun at his handycap, making the best of a bad situation. It was refreshing to see a handycapped person overcome his disability in a fashion that makes the rest of us look at them as another person. I hope we see more from this new commedian, he is truly worth watching.",1293580800,3,345,4.242424242424242
3955380,5,B002N5KVA4,This is a lot of the same material that Josh won Last Comic Standing with. Hilarious stuff and his delivery is perfect.,1256256000,5,119,4.454545454545454

3955386,2,B002N5KVA4,We love Josh Blue but this special didn't live up to his last one.  It seemed like he was making most of it up on the fly.,1415836800,,122,3.5185185185185186

3955388,1,B002N5KVA4,"Really disappointing. The quality of the DVD was poor, the focus was not sharp and the audio faded in many places. Even more disappointing was that I did not find Josh's material to be nearly as funny as when I recently watched him on a television show. I won't be watching this particular disc again.",1407369600,,301,4.490909090909091

3955390,5,B002N5KVA4,"A fantastic special by Last Comic Standing 4th season winner, Josh Blue. He delivers as well as any other great comic and disperses everything we want to say about the comedy in his symptoms of cerebral palsy. He obviously doesn't take shame in condition that he's been dealt and uses it to his full advantage by bringing joy and laughter to all who behold it. I could watch Blue perform for hours.",1388620800,,398,4.541666666666667
3955391,2,B002N5KVA4,"Material is very blue. Josh is very funny, but you cannot watch this in a family setting.  I was embarrassed  by it.",1359331200,,116,4.2272727272727275
3955392,2,B002N5KVA4,"Humor is subjective obviously, the flaws in this dvd are also.  I could not wait to get this dvd after falling in love with his humor on LCS.  This dvd falls flat.",1329436800,,163,4.0625
