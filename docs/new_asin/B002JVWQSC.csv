8371633,5,B002JVWQSC,"I so enjoyed this series and was so disappointed when it was canceled!  The stories were so real and interesting.  And I loved the characters and their own personal stories.  I will purchase this series on DVD as soon as it is available....  Christian Slater was super in his role.  If you like NCIS, or any of the CSI shows, this one is similar but with a more personal side to the story....they are not trying to solve the crime, but trying to identify the person who died.  The program brought awareness to this very sad reality of Jane/John Does.",1356998400,,550,4.45
8371634,4,B002JVWQSC,I am still trying to get the complete series. I loved the show the cast worked well together.  The use of voice overs from the dead commenting about their life good or bad was well done. This show should have never been canceled. Episode 16 brilliant. It is a series I really wish to have to see episodes missed. What worked well was each character had a motivation for solving a particular crime. As much as the TEAM wanted to find and give names and a voice to the dying; they in a lot of respects solved crimes and cold cases. There was room for this special niche on TV. ABC you made a mistake cancelling the show and could have better promoted the website nameus.gov and bring more awareness to these real life tragedies. I loved the show.,1341100800,3,744,4.35251798561151
8371635,5,B002JVWQSC,"I loved this TV series and want to buy the complete series on DVD. It was excellant. I liked the cast. The national network of volunteers to support identifying the ""Jane or Joe Doe"" and notifying family offers closure. The show demonstrated the dedication of these volunteers. Would love to see more shows on this and of this caliber, forget those goofy reality shows Bachelor, Wives of Atlanta, Mob Wives etc.",1334620800,,411,4.802816901408451
8371636,5,B002JVWQSC,"Well, the title pritty much explains my opinion. The characters are intresting and have back stories. The cases are intresting, although it makes the police seem a bit stupid because the team are always able to crack the case in a matter of days, but i think it actuly is just like reality- there are so many cases for police & detectives that people slip through the cracks.
 I like how the story is told by the victim, it gives the show more depth and sets it apart from other shows.",1333584000,,485,4.329670329670329
8371637,5,B002JVWQSC,"I really enjoyed this show. I thought it was awesome. The cast was great. Each character had their own reason for being there. The stories were compelling and the substory with his little girl who went missing was amazing.
I wanted so much more and I definitely want the DVDs to rewatch at least.",1307750400,5,296,4.5
8371638,5,B002JVWQSC,I absolutely loved this show. The cast was great. I think it was well acted very heart felt and interesting snd that this is based on a true organization. I was heartbroken that it was not renewed for another season. Christian Slater is one of my favorite actors. This is a real shame. We need more quality programs like this.,1305849600,2,326,4.45
8371639,5,B002JVWQSC,"Sorry this is off the air. It's nice to have something different to watch. No it's not a fast pace CSI or NCIS. However, it has debth and meaning. Getting to the truth about who these people were before there death. Finding closure for families who don't know if their love ones are dead or alive. I loved every episode!",1294531200,8,320,4.35
8371640,4,B002JVWQSC,"The show The Forgotten has an excellent message about a real life problem, people who are killed and are left unidentified and forgotten. The show is based on real events, and real cases(I believe the director said in an interview some of the cases in the show where actual cases).
The characters all have their own story and background that develops and is more and more revealed as the shows continue. It is different from the other crime shows because these characters are regular people with jobs and problems like any normal person. They are not experts but have the skills and the patience to understand the victim and solve the case. The Forgotten is more about the life of the John/Jane Doe(the victim) and what lead to their death. It's not all about the killer and how he/she did it, but the person left with nothing. It is a great show that keeps you guessing as to why the John/Jane Doe was killed, and it also will keep you guessing as to who killed John/Jane Doe.",1281657600,15,977,4.52542372881356
8371641,2,B002JVWQSC,"When the police run out of leads, this group of volunteers - The Forgotten Network - take over and try to identify the John and Jane Does and find out how they died. Lead by Christian Slater (who is actually pretty good in this role, I must say) the team are either the best detectives in the world or the ones in Chicago are the worst ever as they usually find out what happens fairly easily (making me wonder during every episode why the police gave up the investigation so quickly) which makes it way too unbelieveable to enjoy a majority of the time.

The characters are all pretty plain and lifeless (no pun intended) but if you can get past their boring exteriors, which thankfully doesn't take up too much of the storylines, then there are a handful of decent episodes here.

It's nothing special, I can certainly understand why this was cancelled, but if you catch any re-runs of TV then this is worth the occasional watch. otherwise, this show is best forgotten about. Stick to watching the CSI's instead.",1281052800,,1014,4.565934065934066
