8166418,4,B000M5B7CI,"My primary reason for the purchase of this product was to have an Italian DVD to use while walking on my treadmill. Before making the purchase, I reviewed all the Italian DVDs at my local library. Of the six DVDs that I was able to obtain ""Italian 101"" and ""Global Access Visual Passport Italian"" were the best. The instructional DVD contains the basics of Italian which will be useful to anyone traveling in Italy. I have given the product a four star rating because it is one of the best of the Italian DVDs on a comparison basis. Please note, I use this product solely as an adjunct to my Italian language CDs which are much more comprehensive.",1252713600,,647,4.491525423728813
8166419,1,B000M5B7CI,I was not happy with this DVD at all.  It was too short and a waste of my money.  I don't recommend it to anyone. I found Cyberitalian online and am actually learning quite a bit of Italian.,1175385600,6,190,3.973684210526316
