2248745,1,B0007XBM5W,I was very disappointed with this film.  The movie had no definite direction.  The music and the sound effects overrode the actors speaking most of the time.  There was so much background music playing that there was not enough silence to even have a remotely scary scene.  I expected much more from this movie.  I would ignore the 5 star comments on this page.  I based my interest off those comments to go see the movie.  They had to of been made up comments or people with bad taste in movies.  I feel like I wasted my money seeing this film. I think that the rest of the audience felt the same way.  There was no response to the film from the audience the entire time.  I'm just very disappointed.,1107043200,11,701,4.323076923076923
2248746,2,B0007XBM5W,"Ok, to be honest, i have not seen the movie. I did. But then there was just so many negative reviews for it so that i think i'll save my money for a rental. Well anyway, the point of this review is to tell everyone not to judge the movie based on many of the 5 star reviews on this site. If you check the background to many, this is the only review on their record. Meaning, they were probably invented just to give this movie a ratings boost because the studio or someone probably realized that EVERYONE gave this film an average of about 1 1/2. So yeah, if you look at the reviews, look at the ones with at least a paragraph of review, not just a sentence b/c those are probably the ones that have been made up. Thank you.",1107043200,5,724,4.06993006993007
2248747,1,B0007XBM5W,"I laughed, I cried, it moved me... out of the theatre. Not fast enough, sadly, to escape the inept garbage bin that is ""Alone in the Dark."" It's the sort of movie that gets relegated to discount bins for four bucks, but isn't ever purchased -- poor direction, bad acting, and a script that pushes new boundaries of silliness.

It opens with an explanation about the Abskani, an ancient civilization who apparently worshiped demons -- and were somehow destroyed by them. Fast-forward to the twenty-first century, and you find that the adage about ""those who don't learn from history) is true: Professor Hudgens (Mathew Walker) is obsessed with using Abskani artifacts, and only Edward Carnby (Christian Slater), a clone of Agent Mulder, can hope to stop him.

Carnby is haunted by nightmares that are somehow connected to those ancient demons, and by experiments that Hudgens performed years ago. He teams up with his museum-curator ex-girlfriend Aline (Tara Reid -- and no, I am not joking!) to stop Hudgens from using some ancient statue to release interdimensional aliens, who may destroy the entire human race.

It's an exhibition of wooden acting, an orgy of silly ideas, a giant steaming pile of celluloid that should have been relegated to late nights on the Sci Fi Channel. In fact, it's difficult to understand why this video game adaptation wasn't relegated to the ""Direct to Video"" bins, along with all the other bad horror flicks.

Where to begin? What bad thing about this is the worst? Let's start with Uwe Boll's direction -- it's leaden and uneven, full of slow-motion and quick cuts at all the wrong moments. Apparently nobody told Boll that alien beasties jumping out does NOT count as a shocking plot twist. At least Boll wasn't directly responsible for the script, which includes an out-of-the-blue sex scene, and Aline reading ancient scripts by memory.

The acting never becomes much better than the script or direction -- Slater and Dorff are sleepwalking through their roles. And Tara Reid manages a bit of hilarity as a scientist -- we know she's smart, because she wears glasses. It's like watching Paris Hilton pretend to be a particle physicist. How many museum curators wear pants that tight?

Uwe Boll should not direct any more movies. After the ridiculously bad creation that is ""Alone in the Dark,"" I wouldn't trust him to direct a documentary on seaweed, because he would probably botch it up. This movie deserves instant oblivion.",1106956800,130,2464,4.953995157384988
2248748,1,B0007XBM5W,"I laughed all throughout the movie, because it was that bad. I cried because I feel as though I wasted my money. I left because thank the lord I only had to endure this for 90 minutes (I would have left but I was with friends) The plot was awful, the acting was terrible, the ""effects"" were horrific. I love ""mindless entertainment"" (key word being ENTERTAINMENT) .....not ""mindless movies"". I like a good horror flick like the next person, but this was just dreck....horrible. It seemed like they just put in as many cliches as humanly possible and then just edited them together.
We had your ""mad scientist"", the ""archeologist"" (female with tons of make-up), we had the mysterious team of ""the 713"" who protects us from the things in the dark, we had our ""hero"" who was staggering about trying to remember things from his past (he of course couldn't remember anything from before he was ten) we had an orphanage (run by a nun of course!), oh...and don't forget our heros protaganist...he is the new leader of the 713 as our hero was the old one. They don't get along of course until the end of the movie. I could go on, but I feel as though I am babbling already...because this movie turned my brain to mush.
Trust me, those that are giving it decent reviews are probably 12 and snuck out of the house to see it.
I have news for you Christian Slater, this is not your ""Pulp Fiction"" where your career will be revived. If anything I will pull out my copy of Pump Up the Volume and remember the day when you were tauted as the ""next Jack Nicholson""....no doubt you will do the same.",1106956800,9,1582,4.421232876712328

Not a seat gripper all the way through and a bit predictable in parts with enough gore to please the larger crowd.  I liked Christian Slater's character and his delimma but I would have liked more info on the who, the what and the why.  The ending was too reminiscent of Resident Evil and other movies.

I laughed halfway through the movie very glad it was a rental from the library so it was free.
I DID like one thing though, Tara Reid's clothes. They didn't dress her like a you know what! the clothes were sensible yet they didn't et in the way and they weren't super short or really tight.",1437955200,,433,4.228915662650603
2248758,4,B0007XBM5W,"I find the vitriol associated with this movie puzzling.  Is it as terrible as some claim?  I've seen far worse.  Yes, it is confounding at times.  That opening explanation was redundant to say the least, offered up in writing and recited for those who didn't care to read it.  I've never quite understood the point in that.  Or maybe this is simply a case of ignorance is bliss?  I know nothing of the game this movie is based on.  I couldn't tell you if they were faithful to it or not.  I don't know who Uwe Boll is and I don't know what claim to fame Tara Reid holds.  I have no grudge in this match.  For me, this was just another horror movie with monsters.  In that regard, I like this movie.  Does that mean it isn't without problems?  Of course not.  There are some definite continuity issues in play.  This movie is filled with short scenes that are haphazard and too fleeting to register their purpose in the scheme of things.  That it deals with a conspiracy becomes obvious later rather than sooner.  There are way too many plot threads to keep track of.  To say it's disorganized doesn't fully appreciate the frenzy of images and ideas that assault the senses in a mere 96 minutes.  Uwe Boll definitely had something in mind when he made this film.  I think that if he had more time to think on it, things might have turned out better.  But he isn't solely to blame.  There were three writers and several producers.  Christian Slater (as Edward Carnby) deserves some of the blame with his starkly unflinching performance as a waxwork figure.  As the star of this epic, he should have a least made some semblance of an effort to appear lifelike.  Even so, and for all that, I still have an unerring fondness for this flightless turkey.  Every time I watch it, it grows on me.  There, I said it, I like this stupid movie.  I've liked worse.

Now supposidly this movie is based off a series of video games and if it is, any source materiel has got to be butchered like hell in this. The setting up of the bad creatures sucked, the cg wasn't great, the characters were one dimenshional (but not bad for one dimenshional), prior relationships among characters are just thrown in left and right, one of the bad guys comes out of nowhere, the ending sucked, the film wants us to think we know these characters when we don't, characters get killed off screen after being prominant for the last few minutes, the film poorly transitions between major story marks and the scene showing the layer of the creatures was a clear ripoff of event horizon.

2248772,3,B0007XBM5W,"I bought this film on Amazon for about $3 and it was worth it. I know a lot of people hate this movie and I respect their opinion, I can see why they hate the film. The film does receive a 2.3 on IMDB and is ranked in their Bottom 100 movies. I had low expectations going into the film and found myself thinking it was good, if you also have low expectations for Alone in the Dark then you might enjoy it. A couple a bad things about the film is that it is slow paced and pretty confusing film, along with Tara Reid being apart of the casting which did hurt the film. I am a fan of both Christian Slater and Stephen Dorff, so in my opinion that helped the film along with I did like the creatures designs but it is executed with bad CGI. I never played the game that it was based on so that didn't affect me from judging the film.

I do like the action scenes it does have and I didn't mind the acting with the exception of Tara Reid. I don't think Uwe Boll is the worst director ever because I have to admit I enjoyed Alone in the Dark as well as House of the Dead which was Boll's first film. Like I said,  a lot of people don't like it so it is completely up to you whether to buy the film or even just watch it. I don't think Alone in the Dark is one of the worst horror films ever made but that is just my opinion, I respect everybody else's opinion on this film.",1342051200,3,1368,3.899641577060932

Now I'd remembered that it got terrible reviews, but I said why not give it a try for lack of anything else on the tube. You know those movies that you've heard are awful, but then you watch them and they turn out to be not as bad as everyone said they were?...Well this ain't one of 'em!!!

Alone in the Dark could be one of the worst movies that I've ever tried to sit through in my life...and I'm freakin' old! Terrible acting. A broken to pieces storyline. At least a 1/2 dozen inconsistencies. Unscary. And such silly lines that they weren't even unintentionally funny.

Tara Reid and Christian Slater are so wooden and poorly directed that they seem like they were being forced against their will to show up at the set every day. Their characters are the most superficial that I've seen in a movie since...no wait....Actually their characters are the most superficial that I've seen in a movie...period.

I've heard many times that the crown for worst director in the world is Uwe Boll for taking some classic video games and turning them into garbage on the big screen. Alone in the Dark is Boll's antimasterpiece. Stay away.",1323388800,,1226,4.5636363636363635

The action sequence that opens the  movie and some of the subsequent sequences not taking into account any errors are actually decent and in my opinion not the worst in movies in general.  This is kinda a different genre you get to enjoy a little action and laugh at the funny dialogue and awkward acting at times,  so what it was not trying to win an oscar it was just trying to make you forget your dull life for a couple of hours,  and if all the hate and hostility I have seen from others directed at some one who at least accomplished making some movies (even if people do not appreciate him) more power to him,  I think it would have been easier to just hang it up and say screw you all,  but he has kept going trying to at least make movies you all can bash him for.  It kind of reminds me of two things the mystery science theater shtick with the line from Interview with the vampire where they have ""vampires pretending to be humans pretending to be vampires""  how do you know he is not just using his image to create a demand for his movies the same way people who hated Howard Stern still listened to him,  so if you hate him so much why post?  He has done more then I have in the film business and at least he got some movies made something most of you will never do, not even a bad movie so,  I think that says it all,  I think that three stars is slightly generous,  I think If I could have I would have given it 2.5 think that would have been fair,  for an action movie that fell short of the mark but still managed to make me forget my life for an hour or two.",1310083200,,2182,3.8936651583710407
2248780,1,B0007XBM5W,"Sometimes I wonder if Uwe Boll doesn't secretly have an actual sense of humor. Maybe he's not as bad as he seems to be and is actually playing an elaborate joke on the viewer. I can only hope so because otherwise the guy is nothing but a delusional narcissistic no-talent egomaniac. And God do I  love watching his movies. It's like Ed Wood with a budget. Same ridiculous plots. Same nonsensical lines. Same cliches repeated over and over. Sure, he's no Ed Wood but his films are still funny as hell. So why the one-star? Well honestly that's what it deserves. I don't think that movies should really get credit for being entertaining if they only achieve it by accident. After all, this movie isn't trying to be funny, it's trying to be gloomy and atmospheric. But boy is it fun to watch it fail!

Since the fun is in the details the plot description shall be brief. Basically, Christian Slater plays a guy who was one of twenty orphans who were experimented on. Except that he's different of course. Not that it matters. That plot point turns out to be irrelevant despite all the focus they put on it. And if you can't figure out what makes him different by the 40 minute mark then you are as stupid as Boll seems to think you are. Anyways, this experience has made him into a grim and moody man who is always monologing about how dangerous the world is yet tells his entire life's story to anyone at the turn of the hat. Can't have the audience wondering why he's so gloomy. Better explain it within about 2 minutes of meeting him. Anyways, apparently he's a paranormal investigator who never does any actual investigating in the entire film. In fact, he doesn't really do much of anything now that I think about it. He just sort of stands there and lets things happen to him. Hmm. I guess that means the plot description is over. Now onto the fun part. The random crazy bits and mysterious plot holes.

As I was watching the film I couldn't help noticing a few problems. In fact, I made a list:
1 minute 30 second long opening text. This basically tells you every secret in the movie in needlessly complicated detail. This isn't background information, it's information that the characters will be finding out as they go along. Since his target audience can't read Boll has kindly had them read aloud to us.

Christian Slater never speaks normally. Every line is dark and brooding and bad film noir knockoff-ly. He also narrates everything. EVERYTHING. Including things that you saw him do about 20 minutes before (in case you forgot already), things that he couldn't possibly know, and things that actually have no relevance to the plot or even to what's happening at that moment. Sometimes they even narrate plot points that they forgot to show.

Action scenes show up randomly with no set up and no reasoning. People just show up and attack him.

Also in action scenes is a terrible misuse of slow motion. We're not talking Zack Snyder levels, but at least when Snyder uses slomo he uses it in the right places. Or for the entire fight... Anyway, the problem with Boll is that he throws the slomo in at random. There is nothing happening that the characters should be moving in slow motion. Imagine watching someone tie their shoe in slow motion. How exciting would that be? It's just silly.

Another problem with action scenes: Several times in the middle of the scene one guy just stops and waits for the other guy to get up and see him. Just stands there and waits. The silliest example of this comes near the end when a snake thing pops out of the ground, pauses over a woman, the guys point their guns at it, the snake looks at the woman, the guys aim their guns at it, the snake finally bites the women, they immediately start shooting as the snake dives into the ground. Don't you feel so clever now?

Yet another problem with the action scenes: the sound editing is terrible. The music is just the same drum roll over and over again. They don't even add any sound effects to distract from it. It gets tiresome real fast.

Last thing about the action scene I promise. This one is a question. If you shoot a guy and he keeps running at you what do you do? If your answer is run at the guy and punch him in the face then congratulations! You're an idiot. That is of course exactly what he does.

Eerie music should go over eerie scenes. Putting eerie music on when someone's walking down the street does not make that scene eerie. Especially when absolutely nothing happens.

On the same note, having creepy camera movies and sound effects in a scene kind of implies that you're going somewhere with them. Throwing them in when he's (again) walking down the street adds nothing to the film.

This one's more of a pet peeve of mine. The Abkani civilization is described as being 10,000 years old which just another example of sloppy writing and complete lack of any research into the subject that their characters are supposed to be experts in. There was no civilization 10,000 years ago. OK, there was the town of Gbekli Tepe in Anatolia but everywhere else was just beginning agriculture. Certainly there was nothing in the Americas anywhere near that time.

The villain monologues are depressingly mundane for this type of movie. He just talks normally and doesn't laugh maniacally or sneer or anything. He also seems to have no reason to be doing any of it. He is entirely without motivation or menace. Surprising really. If there's one performance in the film that should be over the top it's this one, yet he's given nothing to do and is astonishingly low key. Odd.

The technobabble is unusually bad since this is supposed to take place nowadays.

The acting. Christian Slater's not actually doing that bad. he's sort of phoning in his performance but then the writers and director phoned in theirs so why should he care? Those long, boring monologues that make up most of his dialogue in the film were never going to work no matter how much he tried to sell them. Tara Reid gives what is one of the single worst performances ever seen on screen. She makes Denise Richards look believable as the brilliant scientific type. The rest of the acting is mediocre at best with many of the bit players either reading it utterly flat or hamming it up to the extreme.

Christian Slater's 'former' bosses provide no resistance to him whatsoever. He basically gets supplied by them with no trouble whatsoever despite getting in fights with their commander.

Those crazy camera angles. You can tell that Boll just looks at other films and goes, ""ooh that looks cool. I'm gonna put that in my next film,"" without any relevance or context. There is no originality in this film. None whatsoever. From the creature design on down.

Best scene in the film: it starts as a 'dramatic' scene in Bureau 713's headquarters when suddenly a bad romance song comes on and we switch to Christian Slater where out of the blue a girl comes in and decides to have a sex scene. I have never seen a sex scene so unnecessary or hamfistedly forced into a movie. There is no warning, it just cuts to it and then suddenly it cuts away and that's that.

Boll frequently forgets to add tension to scenes. He just puts in noises and shock sounds. Worse, he shoots them from a distance. Scary scenes are scary in part because you can't see what's coming. That's why so many horror films have close ups on the actor's faces. You can't see the threat but you know it's there. By having wide panning shots Boll just ruins any fear you might be feeling. No amount of music or screeching can make up for that.

A guy's wife dies and he just says, ""Sarah. Oh God Sarah,"" as if he's reading it out of a book. That entire plot thread made no sense incidentally.

Slater shows no emotion at killing his friend and when he repeats it to Reid she just monotones, ""you had no choice,"" and that's the end of any angst he might have had. How is this character supposed to be gloomy again? He doesn't seem to care at all.

There is a real inconsistency in the monster's portrayal. Are they men or beasts? They seem to switch between them at will. While that might have been intentional, it does raise the question of why they always face Christian Slater in human form but everybody else as monsters?

After all that boring plot exposition they decide that they needed to actually conclude the work. Since Christian Slater hasn't done anything the entire movie the Bureau just shows up and tells him that they've solved the entire thing rendering all the time we were following him completely useless. When your main characters can be removed from the plot without consequence you know you have a problem on your hands. Incidentally, the 'discovery' they make was explained to us during the opening scrawl rendering the hour between that and this an utter waste of time.

There is a very stereotypical shot of a whole army of monsters running at the camera. Anyone who's ever seen a movie trailer before knows exactly what's gonna happen. One of the monsters is gonna jump up at the camera and it will all fade to black. And indeed it does. After about 30 seconds of monsters running through the forest. Why?

Incidentally, for a film called&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alone-in-the-Dark/dp/B0007XBM5W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alone in the Dark</a>&nbsp;you get to see the monsters pretty clearly. They're not very scary since they're just a conglomeration of tired old movie monsters. They never even appear unexpectedly either except to bit players who wander off on their own. Everyone else can see them coming from a mile away.

An engraving in a cave reads ""once you've made it this far alive you're already dead."" A brilliant line. Which raises the question of who built it, who carved out the rooms, who installed the laboratory, and why are they not already dead?

A badguy points his gun at three guys who are pointing guns at him and tells them to put them down. Naturally they obey. Very obedient our heroes. And of course our villain does the old 'never kill your enemies' bit and holds them at gunpoint when he has no reason to keep them alive. Also, how'd he get down there with all those military guys and monsters in the way?

The nun running the orphanage is helping the bad guy. That's no spoiler since they reveal it in the first five minutes. What is surprising is that they never explain why. She's established as a good person so why help him? Did they forget to write that scene? Jesus.

There are plenty of problems that I skipped over because they were boring or too spoiler-heavy but those are the big ones. I'd recommend that anyone who wants to know how Uwe Boll operates (complete with quotes!) check out this site: [...]

2248781,3,B0007XBM5W,"I am at a loss to understand why so many viewers are bashing this movie so rabidly.

I looked up the reviews before watching the movie; they were so overwhelmingly negative that I almost decided to return it to Big Lots and get my $3.00 back. Yet, having never seen an Uwe Boll's creation I was curious, and thought that at only $3.00 I wouldn't lose much. Also, it was supposed to be so incredibly pathetically awful that I became eager to discover this contender for "" world's worst movie"". In that respect I was sorely disappointed: Alone in the Dark is an honest B horror picture, and certainly hardly half as bad as purported to be by so many.

Certainly it is not on par with Alien, but in such a comparison the overwhelming majority of science fiction horror films fall short. As with most horror flicks, one should not expect a masterpiece of world cinema nor an Academy Award winner. Alone in the Dark is not a masterpiece and never pretends that it could ever be one, but it is certainly not an awful movie, nor even a bad movie in this genre. It works well for what it was supposed to do: provide 96 minutes of escapism.

Unlike many reviewers, I found Alone in the Dark coherent, never lacking in continuity, easy to follow and understand (but then I never needed Dune to be explained to me by a flyer!), suspenseful, fast-paced and attention grabbing; I was never bored a second.

The flashbacks illustrate adequately all connections with the past, and they are very intriguing in themselves. The close combat scenes are fascinating and perfectly choreographed. The creatures are quite impressive and disquieting if not absolutely original; one will also notice a definite Starship Troopers' influence in the combats between creatures and 713 agents, but it doesn't spoil anything. The sets are completely satisfactory and perfectly complement the action. The special effects are flawless and well worth being replayed several times. All of which is highly laudable when one remembers that it was a very modest budget movie. The twist and turns of the story, although not always unpredictable, work sufficiently well to let one go with the flow. The ending might leave some a little bewildered or unsatisfied, but it has its own logic and I respect that. This is a movie that some time from now I will watch again with pleasure.

The extras or special features are numerous and very interesting. I will be looking for other titles by Uwe Boll. I certainly do not regret having bought Alone in the Dark and not having let myself be deterred by the negative criticism; to amateurs of unpretentious honest horror B movies I would definitely recommend it.",1301875200,2,2664,4.757575757575758
2248782,2,B0007XBM5W,"The Good -- This movie looks like some money went into it -- not much money, but the production values are high for drivel like this.

The Bad -- This movie put me to sleep about fifteen minutes in. Luckily, I've seen it before. Literally and figuratively. This movie rehashed every other monsters-from-some-other-place-are-trying-to-take-over-Earth story so much so that one could construct their own movie by just reading the synopsis on the back of the DVD box. And their movie would be better.

The Ugly -- Some movies just click on all fronts. From acting to pace, things click. Nothing clicks here. The acting is tolerable; no one stands out as being either decent or not. The direction is passable. The script is what it is. But nothing gels with the other resulting in a prime example of cinematic weakness.

But this disconnection doesn't make this movie unwatchable. Sure, I don't recommend it, but there are worse movies out there, which is all the kindness I can direct to this movie.",1299715200,,996,4.847058823529411
2248789,2,B0007XBM5W,"Uwe Boll is often called the Ed Wood of the current film industry.  Compared to the acclaimed Worst Director of All Time, I think Boll's even worse that him.  Ed Wood may not have the budget (or logic) for any of his movies, but his movies are certainly original, or at least have original elements to stand out; can you think of a movie about aliens that raise people from the dead to threaten humanity for peace, or a movie that ended with the scientist fighting an octopus that explodes?  Boll does not have that same creative and ambitious mind, he prefers to take whatever exists in the media (i.e. video games) and defecate all over it.  His first film, ""House of the Dead"", is the bottom of the barrel of awful movies: the plot and characters are dumb, the camera shots are obnoxious awful (yea, let's have every survivor have 360 effect), the action had no substance, and it makes an asinine use of video game footage for scene transitions.  It was an incoherent, immature monstrosity.

""Alone of the Dark"" isn't as bad the director's first disemBOLLment, but that's like saying a plate of excrement is better than a mountain-pile of it.  The plot was functional and it ties all the elements together (sans for the last few scenes), and at least Boll toned down the stupid camera effects for this film.  That being said, the camera effects still exist for insubstantial reasons, like the infamous monster shootout in the storage area where the camera pans and moves around like a 3D cartoon or the first-person POV during a walk in the alley when the camera makes sudden motion shifts.  I understand what the film's trying to present in those moments, but those effects aren't necessary; they're so exaggerated, they ended up losing their intended mood.  Boll makes a dubious effect to use these visual aspects for all of his movies; it's like he's trying to be Paul W.S. Anderson, but he doesn't quite understand his style.

Everything else is standard Boll badness.  The actors are phoning it in, there's a lot of dragging, the special effects barely rise above those from Sci-Fi original movies, and overall uneventful to sit through.  ""Alone in the Dark"" is a weak effort, not even the director's cut can fix it.  As far what I know about this version (besides the intended framing of 2.35 instead of 1.78), the love scene between Tara Reid and Christian Slater in the original was cut; not like there was anything going on in that love scene, so it wasn't a big loss.",1281484800,,2480,4.658256880733945
2248790,2,B0007XBM5W,"The only real entertainment you can get out of Alone in the Dark comes from reading its scathing reviews, many of which are hilarious in their no-holds-barred skewering of the film.  It's amazing to me that Tara Reid and Uwe Boll still manage to find work in the business.  Reid's puny acting skills seem to deteriorate further with every film she makes, while Boll has to be the worst ""big name"" director of the twenty-first century.  Apparently, the movie was originally intended to have an actual storyline, but Uwe Boll decided to scrap it in favor of more explosions.  I don't know how a decent actor like Christian Slater got involved with this movie or how he made it through the filming with his sanity intact, but he's pretty much the only thing this film has going for it.

This film bears little resemblance to the original trilogy of Alone in the Dark games.  I don't have any experience with the later releases in the series, but the Edward Carnby of the original game was a regular private investigator who was sent to find a piano in the house of a man who committed suicide and suddenly found himself attacked by ghostly monsters.  In the movie, he's a veritable action adventure hero with a mysterious childhood and a former career as an agent for a top secret paranormal investigation unit called Bureau 713.  The whole story is built around the discovery of a previously unknown race of American Indians called the Abskani, who disappeared quite suddenly thousands of years ago after opening up a gateway to another dimension or something and letting something really, really bad into the world.  Carnby (Christian Slater) left the bureau because all of the Abskani artifacts he found were immediately classified, thus preventing him from finding out the truth.  It turns out that this truth has a lot of personal meaning for him, as a missing chunk of his childhood can be traced back to a secret Abskani-related experiment conducted by rogue scientist Professor Hudgens (Matthew Walker).  You don't have to remember all of this now, though, because most of it is explained in an interminably long prologue at the opening of the film.  The actual movie consists mostly of badly-shot special effects featuring alien entities attacking Carnby, his archaeologist girlfriend Aline (Tara Reid), and the new commander of Bureau 713 (Stephen Dorff).

Since Uwe Boll thinks action and things that go boom are all that is needed to make a movie, you would think he would take the trouble to learn how to shoot those types of scenes.  The man doesn't even know how to use slow motion properly, and he apparently chooses his camera angles completely at random, thus ruining the whole effect of most of the action scenes.  Of course, no explosion can be big enough to absorb the plot holes in the story or the black hole of acting generated by Tara Reid.

OK, I'll admit, ""Alone in the Dark"" is not on my best films of all time list, but it's not on my worst films list, either. It may be directed by Uwe Boll, who is considered by many to be the worst director of all time, but if all of Boll's other films are like this, then Boll has been grossly underestimated, because I have seen a lot of films that are far worse than this one (for example, ""The Stepford Wives"" remake).

The script is based on a video game, which gives it that ""video game"", moving from level to level, feel that you get with a lot of films of this type (such as ""Resident Evil"" or ""Doom""), but that didn't so much put me off the film as make me want to go out and play the game. Not being a gamer, this was my first encounter with ""Alone in the Dark"", and I found the story to be interesting enough to maintain my interest for the duration of the film. The acting is uneven in quality. Christian Slater and Stephen Dorff (as another government agent) both turn in decent performances, but Tara Reid is so unconvincing as a scientist that she actually adds to the entertainment value of the film. My main criticism is that some of the battle scenes are just too long.

Hey, this is a movie with ancient civilizations and an ancient McGuffin, a government paranormal research team, and some monsters that look like Alien.  You can make a bad movie with those elements, but making that movie _boring_ on top of that is quite an achievement.  What makes ""Alone in the Dark"" even worse is that the first five minutes actually have kind of a goofy energy that is missing from the remainder of the movie.  Those first five minutes are like a promise to the audience that is broken by the rest of the film.  Even ""House of the Dead,"" Boll's previous video game movie, is entertaining as a bad movie because of its wacky energy - it keeps things moving and takes advantage, on a B-movie level, of its key story elements.  ""Alone in the Dark"" fails to do so.

Christian Slater does his best with the material he was given, and even Tara Reid manages to gamely get through her part.  The fault here is clearly in writing and direction.  The editor has to take some blame as well.

The director is an enigmatic and compassionate man who loves the games on which most of his films are based. Yes, granted: they're not epic movies, but if you just want to sit down and watch action for 90 minutes, they certainly deliver.

What I don't understand, is how people who has only seen one Uwe Boll movie, can say that the director can't make films. This year alone, Boll has six movies coming out. Surely there are people who like his work. Personally, I believe ""Postal"" is hilarious, and is the equal to ""Team America: World Police"".

Simply because ""Blood Rayne"" wasn't one of the best movies by Boll, everyone feels the right to critisize him. He's not allowed to make a less accomplished movie? Whereas, ""Out Of Sight"" by Soderbergh and ""Ready To Wear"" by Altman are considered greats? They're movies that should be labeled ""awful"".

To the people who hate Boll for the movies he makes: I love his movies, and adapting a video game to this medium IS difficult.

2248809,1,B0007XBM5W,"I laughed, I cried, it moved me... out of the theatre.

Not fast enough, sadly, to escape the inept pile of rotted debris that is ""Alone in the Dark."" Uwe Boll's adaptation of the video game is the sort of movie that usually gets relegated to discount bins for four bucks, but isn't ever purchased -- oh yes, people, it pushes new boundaries of horrendous silliness.

It opens with an explanation about the Abskani, an ancient civilization who apparently worshiped demons -- and were somehow destroyed by them. Fast-forward to the twenty-first century, and you find that the adage about ""those who don't learn from history"" is true: Professor Hudgens (Mathew Walker) is obsessed with using Abskani artifacts, and only Edward Carnby (Christian Slater), a clone of Agent Mulder, can hope to stop him.

Carnby is haunted by nightmares that are somehow connected to those ancient demons, and by experiments that Hudgens performed years ago. He teams up with his museum-curator ex-girlfriend Aline (Tara Reid -- no joke!) to stop Hudgens from using some ancient statue to release interdimensional aliens, who may destroy the entire human race.

""Alone in the Dark"" is an orgy of ridiculous idea, a steaming pile of rancid celluloid that should have been relegated to 2AM showings on the Sci Fi Channel. In fact, it's difficult to understand why this video game adaptation wasn't relegated to the ""Direct to Video"" bins, along with all the other bad F-movie horror flicks.

And where to begin? What bad aspect about this disaster is the worst?

Let's start with Uwe Boll's direction -- it's leaden and uneven, full of slow-motion and quick cuts at all the wrong moments. Apparently nobody told Boll that alien beasties jumping out does NOT count as a shocking plot twist. At least Boll wasn't directly responsible for the script, which includes a sex scene for the sake of having one, and such delightfully illogical scenes as Aline reading ancient scripts by memory.

The acting never becomes much better than the script or direction -- Slater and Dorff are sleepwalking through their roles, probably counting the seconds until they can punch out for the day. And Tara Reid manages a bit of hilarity as a scientist -- Boll lets us know she's brilliant, because she wears glasses. It's like watching Paris Hilton pretend to be a particle physicist.

After the so-bad-it's-bad trainwrecks of late, Uwe Boll's reputation as the worst filmmaker alive -- perhaps ever -- is cemented in place, to the point where he could probably ruin a nature special with wooden acting and cracked-out camerawork.

I have to say though, that if you rank this ""film"" as a comedy, then it deserves 5 stars, sadly, I'm pretty certain that Uwe Boll didn't mean it as such (though i'm sure he would say otherwise). Despite this movie being as bad as it is, I have to say that it made for one of the best movie going experiences that I have ever had, the consesus of the viewing audience was that this movie was so bad, that noone minded one bit when everyone in the theater started heckling it out loud in Mystery Science Theater fashion. The movie was fool of great moments and memorable lines like  ""don't be insane!"" and virtually every word to come out of Tara Reid's mouth, but the best part came when one of the characters called out for their lost friend Marco and literally 5 people, including myself, couldn't resist the urge to yell ""polo"" at the screen. This is one of those movies that's so unbelieveably bad that it borders on being art (if you consider taking a dump on a puppy artistic expression that is). It amazes me that there are people out there that may actually like this movie, I can't think of a single use for it, though I can honestly say that if a copy of this film were found in Sadam Huisein's palace during operation Iraqi freedom, then it certainly justifies going to war and is proof that Saddam had at least one weapon of mass distruction.",1177027200,5,1439,4.349442379182156

2248825,3,B0007XBM5W,"Christian Slater stars as Edward Carnby in ""Alone in the Dark"", an extension to the story of the ""Alone in the Dark"" series of video games. Being directed by Uwe Boll, it's not the best sci-fi action film in the world, not the best video game adaption in the world, but it's all right. Mind you, I am being a tad generous giving it three stars.

If you've seen a bit of sci-fi, you'll know that lost civilizations have a lot to answer for. The lost civilization of ""Alone in the Dark"", the Abskani, discovered a door to the world of darkness, inhabited by a race of near-invisible dinosaur-like creatures who have the ability to posess bodies of the dead with snake-like parasites inserted into the spine. Because of their meddling with the door, the Abskani are wiped out, but their artifacts remain, scattered around the world. In the present day, a secret US government organization is gathering these artifacts, and much more besides. Edward Carnby (Christian Slater) is a former member of this organization, and after being assaulted by an undead fellow is determined to get some answers. As he searches with with his anthropologist girlfriend Aline (Tara Reid) he discovers a horrible, dark secret(pun intended) from his past, and has a lot of gunfights.

I did think to myself that this would be the sort of film that Ed Wood would make if he were still alive, (the living dead, aliens, scientists, all his favourites are here) but I like Ed Wood, so I didn't mind so much, I like the B-grade atmosphere, and I didn't take this film too seriously. The film, however, takes itself very seriously, there's not one decent quip or joke to lighten the mood. Would have helped a bit.

Special features include a behind-the-scenes featurette where everyone is very excited about the film (Tara Reid tells us its the first time in her career where she gets to use a gun), a featurette about special effects and how they were made, an animatic of the ""bullet time"" sequence (where Edward shoots two bullets which pierce both a large block of ice and his bad guy target) and a couple of galleries worth of photographs.

I recommend this to fans of the video game series, though I suppose it would be an all right film to invite a few friends around and make fun of, if you're into that sort of thing.",1149552000,4,2297,4.622549019607843
2248826,1,B0007XBM5W,"The film is terrible, but you know that already. The thing is, I'm not complaining about the ridiculous costume of Tara Reid as archeologist wearing tight pants. That part I can really love. The film is based on a video game, but that' s OK with me. I love `Tomb Raiders,' its silliness and all. The real problem is that `Alone in the Dark' is no fun to watch. Some films provide us with the `so bad so good' fun; this one doesn't. All you can see is an incredibly dull Grade B horror picture that goes on more than 90 minutes without knowing where to go.

Christian Slater is a treasure hunting hero who wants to be an Indiana Jones. Well, it seems like that because his character is chased by an assassin who follows and tries to kill him. After showing the so-so stunt works including the brief car chase and kung-fu kicking, the film goes on to the next chapter without letting us know enough about the situation.

Never mind, because anyway you stop caring. There is a certain set of established rules about telling a story in moviemaking, but director Uwe Boll ignore everything. Continuity and editing? No such thing. Character and its motive? No such luck. Convincing production designs? Nothing. After the initial 15 minutes, dullness settles in. Who is the boy escaping from the institute? What is this government agency investigating the paranormal phenomena? Why open the door that leads to the forbidden world in the first place? No one in the film seems to know, not even the director.

And the action sequences are utterly thrill-free experience. The creatures are mostly cheaply done, and the soldiers shooting them look quite uncomfortable because the actors know they are only pretending to shoot. What is the point of making least exciting shooting scenes when the film is inspired by a shooting game?

One more thing, and I'm done. Three principle characters are played by Christian Slater, Tara Reid, and Stephen Dorff. Now, I want to say, ""What are they doing in this career killer?"" Someone, please, someone, send them a better script before it's too late. Isn't John Woo available now?

For most of the people `Alone in the Dark' would be instantly the worst film they have ever seen. Some may claim, understandably, that there are Ed Wood films. Ed's films are certainly cheesy and amateurish, but still his films are actually fun to see (depending on the definition of fun, of course), and its badness is somehow lovable. `Alone in the Dark' is, sadly, not even that.",1149206400,6,2493,4.735023041474655
2248827,1,B0007XBM5W,"Oh... My... God... This is quite possibly the worst turkey since Battlefield Earth detonated at the box office. Try this on for size: Christian Slater tries to be a mix between a male Lara Croft and Indiana Jones, complete with rugged leather jacket and sturdy ""adventure"" style boots. Add absolutely terrible computer-generated monsters, a completely nonsensical story and camera work that would make a second film-school student blush.

Of course, the real treat is when Tara Reid tries to be a bright scientist. That's when things get just painful. It seems like Tara's ""acting"" skills are more suitable to adult movies and possibly harebrained teen comedies (which is kinda pushing it), but a scientist..? C'mon, that's like casting Danny DeVito for the lead in a film about Lance Armstrong's life; the match is just so bad it makes you squirm in your seat rather than laugh out loud.

Of course, I shouldn't be surprised. This is the same ""director"" who blessed us with such grand hits as House of the Dead and Bloodrayne, which like this one were loosely based on old computer games. Can't somebody please stop this guy before he turns his eyes to World of Warcraft and ruins the greatest game of all time? Please?",1148083200,7,1220,4.860576923076923

Slater gives on of the best performances that I've seen him give in a rather mediocre career lately probably because Stephen Dorff gives him a excellent foil alot of the time as his rival in the vaunted Agency 713, where Carnby used to work at during the games.  And the direction of this film is done by another great European director Uwe Boll, so you won't be disappointed by the effects, cinematography, or the tightly scripted impressively suspenseful and fast paced storyline.  If you liked the Resident Evil Movies even a stitch you will love these well beyond.",1142035200,5,971,4.438202247191011

In a nutshell, they investigate ancient creatures that become unleashed and now they must learn how to close the portal so the creatures can finally go away. Not scary, not thrilling and not suspenseful. I'm glad I did not buy this movie, even previously viewed and I'm glad I only spent $4 to rent it!!! Not worth it!!!",1141171200,7,523,4.515789473684211
2248832,4,B0007XBM5W,"Carnby (Christian Slater) in a psychic investigator.  He used to work for Bureau 713 (not to be confused with the popular Bureau 13) of the FBI.  An ancient Native American tribe (the Abkane) seems to be connected with anything occult.  Carnby has just come into possession of one of their artifacts when an attempt is made on his life.

Carnby's past, the Abkane, and the natural human fear of the dark all combine to make this movie.  It has plenty of action, suspense and creepiness.  Carnby has his hands full dealing with the government, monsters, and megalomaniacs.  It all comes together in a race against time that results in a surprise ending (the scope of which was not entirely clear).

There is much talk on the disk about making the film true to the games.  Other than the name of the main character I found little resemblance to the games (the first one could be played without Carnby).  The claim is that the stories of the games make up his past but I still can't see it.  Also, Carnby is never alone in his adventures.  He has no end of help when facing the darkness but I guess they didn't want to call this A Crowd in the Dark.

So we know what this film is not.  It is not a good adaptation of the popular games.  But it is a seriously good creepy movie (other than not being specific enough right at the end).  If you like action, monsters, suspense and a good thriller, then you will probably like this film.  Just don't try to make it relate to the games.",1139875200,5,1478,4.375

The dialogue was ok good in parts and some times a little long.(especially the part when the main guy tells the little kid there are monster in real life and they can hurt you. Cheesy but different) But the action was good. Main point this is a action movie doesn't have to be based on drama, want drama go watch a chick flick. IF you want to see people get killed by monsters check out this movie. You want great dialogue go see Doctor Zhivago or Gone with Wind) Want see Tara Redid half naked see this movie. (Its a guy thing nods).

  The gun fire alone and seeing people get killed makes you happy watch this movie. This movie is based of a dark video game called alone in the dark first off the monsters attack on island some where in the Atlantic and not a gold mine. There was zombies in the game and in the movie there was alien controlled humans guess you could called them zombies so that's sprit of the game. The weapons in the movie where not like the game but again the bullet time makes up for it. Just would been nice see the double revolver from the game in the movie that christan Slater should have had. They didn't follow the game hardly but still kept with the sprit of alone in the dark to a degree. Making it a pretty good action movie over all. There was great shots at the mines with the creatures attacking the government troops and taking down the helicopters that rocked. The part with the blonde guy (head of the NSA) going back blowing the mines interesting but, I'm glad he got blow up. He ticket me off.

I have an odd fondness for bad scifi movies because it's fun to see how ridiculous the writing is and how bad the special effects are, not to mention all the no-name actors are trying to pretend like they can act.

Unfortunately this film was not fun in any way, shape or form. Christian Slater is a good actor and the movie seemed to have a halfway decent budget for the creatures, which were animated fairly well, but other than those two points this movie didn't even qualify for a ""direct to Sci-fi channel"" release. There was no fun in this movie at all. The story made no sense at all, the support actors were very stiff and none of the characters seemed to care anything about any of the other characters. At one point in the movie Christian slater mentions ""I just killed my life long friend"" in the same way you would say ""I just spilled my coffe on an onld stained pair of pants I was just about to throw away"". I guess that could sum up the entire movie. The actors didn't seem to care, the director didn't seem to care, the editors didn't seem to care, in fact the only prople who seemed to really do a halfway decent job were the animators who animated the monsters.

After watching this ""movie"" I just felt very sad for Christian Slater. His career must be completely over now. I'm depressed. Time to watch Madagascar and cheer myself up.",1132358400,6,1540,4.34375
2248845,1,B0007XBM5W,"Alone in the Dark (Uwe Boll, 2005)

Will someone in Hollywood eventually realize that Uwe Boll is utterly incapable of making a good movie? More to the point, that he's utterly incapable of making even a bad horror film? His action films are mediocre, but if you're filming horror videogames, perhaps you should look for a horror director, not an action director.

After being blindsided by the mindless-action fare that was House of the Dead, I at least managed to have an idea of what I was in store for with this schlockfest, though I did hold out some hope that a much higher-powered cast this time round would help Boll at least make a decent action film. No such luck.

Christian Slater stars as Edward Carnby, intrepid hunter of things that go bump in the night. Tara Reid is his girlfriend, Aline Cedrac, the stereotypically sexy bookworm holed up in the museum all the time (unless, of course, she's either having sex with the male lead or getting herself into some sort of danger). Stephen Dorff plays Richard Burke, a commander in the paranormal investigation team of which Carnby was recently a member. They're trying to find out what sort of odd, nasty monster is loose in the world and, of course, stop it.

Now, there's enough here to make a half-decent movie. Instead, what Boll delivers, much like he did in House of the Dead, is a mishmash, of other, better films. Those who have seen, especially, Resident Evil and Pitch Black will see a lot of similarities not just in the substance of the shots, but in the way those shots are set up. There wasn't an original thought in Boll's head the whole time he was making this movie. Even if Mastai (the writer on this project with the most experience-- his most famous script before this was for MVP: Most Valuable Primate II) had delivered a script that were actually worth anything, Boll would have found a way to screw it up.

Even though I should know better by now, I know I'm going to get sucked in again. Boll's next project, BloodRayne, scored the twin coups of getting both Michelle Rodriguez and Sir Ben Kingsley, either of whom could act rings around any ten actors in previous Boll releases. After that, he's got a Dungeon Siege adaptation coming out whose cast makes all three of the aforementioned Boll pics look like shoddy crapfests where all the actors were no-names working for half-scale. (Well, okay, House of the Dead was. But the point stands.). I know both are going to disappoint me just as terribly as this did. But, unfortunately, I keep seeing Boll movies like I keep not moving out of the country when we elect morons; they keep promising, and I keep hoping that someday they will actually deliver. Alone in the Dark fails spectacularly. *",1131408000,5,2729,4.641821946169772

2248847,1,B0007XBM5W,"Boll ruined a great gaming franchise.  That's all I can really say.

The original Alone In The Dark game was first released in 1992 and was praised for its incredibly rich plot, attention to details, and revolutionary 3D graphics at the time.  It spawned 2 more standout, and much talked about sequels.  The games took place in the 1920's and its main character was Edward Carnby, a Southern private investigator and a gentleman dressed in a dapper suit.

For years, I'd dream that a movie based off the games would some day come about.  That dream has now been shattered by Uwe Boll.

Alone in the Dark is what spawned games like Resident Evil and the Max Payne series.  Several years later, Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare - the 4th game - was released.  It was set in modern times and consisted of a completely different Edward Carnby dressed like a goth and with the hair of a rockstar going around attacking demons in a haunted house of a madman.  Needless to say, the game did poorly.

What's worse is that Uwe Boll decided to take the ideas of the revamped Alone In The Dark for his movie.  All I can say is, even the poor 4th Alone in the Dark is far superior to the movie.  The movie is just that bad.

I'm sure the movie would have been a lot better if another director was hired to make this movie.  The acting, the plot, etc. do not give the games the reward they deserve.

Don't give this movie any reward!  If you truly want to see an incredible work of art, play the original games.  They are hard to find nowadays but seem to be available second hand on amazon.",1130025600,2,1582,4.3231292517006805

2248853,1,B0007XBM5W,"In the DVD Special Features, one of the three writers credited for this disaster says that videogames are a great bases for films because videogames offer such rich characters.

NOT!

Aside from Lara Croft, I can't think of any videogame characters with any depth.  Even Lara Croft was only two-dimensional, whereas the characters in ALONE IN THE DARK, and every other videogame based movie, are barely one-dimensional.

That's one reason ALONE IN THE DARK is so BOOOOOOOORRIIING!  Cardboard non-characters that just move from level to level, pointlessly killing monsters.  (My God, how far Christian Slater has fallen since he showed so much promise in HEATHERS! -- and Tara Reid in this film was just dreadful; vapid and empty and one-dimensional and just so boring to watch and listen to).

Apart from the thin characters, ALONE IN THE DARK has no real story.  A long expository monologue fills us in on the background (things already known to game players but unknown to film viewers).  Then it's off to a pointless non-story as characters kill monsters in each new setting, just like in a video game.  No real story, or theme, or developing characterizations.

And the monsters and ""scary scenes"" are so cliche-ridden, things we've seen in so many other films.  The dark museum with an artifact/monster brought to life, which museum is suddenly then invaded by SWAT teams -- RELIC already did it.  The mountain of skulls lining the cave walls -- JEEPERS CREAPERS had it, to name just one film.

As for bloopers, you have a SWAT team leader going underground, leaving his men above ground.  Then long after he's sealed underground and loses contact, his men up above are slaughtered.  Later, still underground, he screams, ""Is this why my men are dying up there?""  Hey, how'd he know?  Is he psychic?",1126137600,16,1804,4.917218543046357

Sitting through the first twenty minutes of ""Alone In The Dark"" is tantamount to having the hairs on your arm pulled out one at a time. The movie is so incredibly convoluted, so audaciously written, and horribly conceived that you are seriously led to wonder why the studio even bothered. Christian Slater's talent was totally wasted. He plain and simply did not belong in this movie any more than Michael Caine belonged in that other trainwreck, ""Jaws: The Revenge.""

Alone In The Dark was just even worst and to me, this is the worst film of 2005 and one of the worst films of all time. The creatures look like some reject H.R. Giger creatures. The film's plot makes no sense and it's confusing. The ending of this film makes no sense and it's a ripoff from ""The Evil Dead"".

""Edward Carnby (Christian Slater) is a private investigator specializing in unexplainable supernatural phenomena. His cases delve into the dark corners of the world, searching for truth in the occult remnants of ancient civilizations. Now, the greatest mystery of his past is about to become the most dangerous case he has ever faced. With the help of his ex-girlfriend, archeologist Aline Cedrac (Tara Reid), and his bitter rival, government agent Richard Burke (Stephen Dorff), Edward is about to learn that just because you don't believe in something doesn't mean it cannot kill you!""

According to the character of Carnby, fear of the dark is what keeps us alive. Sadly, however, fear of crappy movies doesn't keep us from renting them. Despite the horrible reviews, I decided to give into the temptation of renting Alone In The Dark (I had a free rental, so I figured there couldn't be much of a loss). It was even worse than I'd expected...

For one, the creatures that are unleashed from the depths of darkness -- or whatever cliche horse feces is shoveled around in the story -- are pathetic CGI dino-beasts. Anything interesting, frightening, or even simply ""cool"" about them? Nope. Just pointless computer-generated monsters that fail at entertaining the audience in the slightest way. For two, the acting is horrendous. Seeing Tara Reid on the DVD's main credits made me roll my eyeballs, but seeing her attempt to act as an archeologist in a sci-fi action flick just made me laugh. The only half-way decent acting is given by Christian Slater, but it's still not enough to cover up for the rest. And for three, the movie is terribly boring, with few action scenes. Oh sure, a few unknown bumps here and there, some creatures flashing across the screen, and a little gore is included. But true action? Very little. The small amounts of action it did include is the reason I gave this stinker two stars. I hate to see a movie suffer, but this one deserves it.

No matter how little talent he has, and no matter how bad these movies are, he manages to keep making them. I know, he finances them all himself through some kind of bizarre German fund, but even so, his ability to keep making movies despite absolute, complete failure is one of the great mysteries of the universe.

It wouldn't be so bad except that video game developers keep giving their best properties to this guy. I really enjoyed the Alone in the Dark series of games. Even the latest one, the New Nightmare, was good for a few hours of game play. There was a good movie to be made out of Edward Carnby's adventures, but this is not it. Now Uwe Boll has gotten his hands on Bloodrayne and Hunter: the Reckoning. What's next, Silent Hill? Doom? I can only imagine the swath that this guy is going to cut through game-to-movie adaptations if he's not stopped. Someone needs to take away his line of credit, or these video game publishers need to wise up and realize that when they make a bad movie out of a game that kills the franchise, no one is interested in that title any more.

Think about it, is House of the Dead or Alone in the Dark a viable game title anymore? No way. A new House of the Dead game comes out for XBox and nobody's gonna care. The title is dead, and all because of Uwe Boll. So if any of you out there work for a game publisher, or know a game publisher, or have access to a game publisher... please warn them.

This movie itself is not even worth reviewing. I can't separate what I didn't like about this pile of dung from the rest of it. Literally, everything about it sucks.

2248866,1,B0007XBM5W,"I guess it's my fault. I actually heard how bad this movie was, and was warned from watching it, but curiosity got the better of me, so I picked it up anyway and decided to see why people ditched this movie so much. I have seen a lot of awful movies, but after watching `Alone in the Dark' I can easily say that it is the most pathetic thing that I have seen ever!

The story is about Edward Carnby, who doesn't remember his childhood, but remembers that something really bad happened to him at this orphanage as a child. Somehow, since he can see the dead sometimes, he just knows it has something to do with the Abkani (even though he doesn't tell us why), so he goes after searching for the artifacts in various continents. Another guy called Hudgens is after the artifacts too, for some other reason, I'm guessing to probably control the world or something, and he has to get it first before Carnby does. What follows later is just a lot of running in the dark, and a lot of shooting.

After watching the whole movie, I still do not understand the concept of the movie! Some of the MANY  questions that came up in my head were:

1) Where did that mad scientist, Hudgens, even get those parasites like creatures from anyway?

2) They go all the way trying to find out the missing pieces of the Abkani artifacts and in the end, they don't want to open the door (even though Carnby feels like all the answers to his life are on the other side), so what is the point of collecting it in the first place? But since the door opens anyway due to other reasons, why do they go in, when they know that they shouldn't? And they didn't even know that Hudgens was behind the operation, so it's not like they were trying to stop him from collecting the artifacts!

3) And finally, HOW does Carnby know that he has to go after the Abkani artifacts? I mean, he mentions in the beginning that his entire memory of the orphanage is erased, so how does he know the answers lie in the artifacts or that it has something to do with the Abkani in the first place?!? Ok so he can see creatures in the dark, but so can Tara Reid when it attacks her in the museum! What is going on? And let's not forget something that he mentions in the beginning of the movie ""My name is Edward Carnby, and I am here to protect you from the things that you don't believe in""...WHO is he talking to (and if it is to the audience, what does that have to do with the story??)

Apart from the senseless storyline that raises more questions than answers (and makes you feel like slapping yourself for wasting your time), the CGI of this movie is really bland and nothing new! I mean, the scene where Carnby fires the bullets on Pinkerton, we've seen that in every other James Bond intro titles, and the creatures looks just like something taken from the alien/predator films! Christian Slater didn't act so badly, but his role was bad enough to begin with. Tara Reid was simply awful! I liked her in `Josie and the Pussycats', but this is just not her. I don't even want to go through how bad the rest of the cast was, since that will probably take more than a few hundred words. Uwe Boll, PLEASE stop torturing us by showing us movies adapted from video games, because they JUST DON'T WORK!

The most extreme comment I had read against the film was booms and other gear in shot; well, where does this occur? I never saw this in the theatre, and not in the DVD. The only ""error"" that is visible in the DVD, is the wire removal sequences where the pull of the wire is left in, and the wire is gone. A trivial criticism.
The film works as a slow develop up to about 40 minutes, then  fires on all cylinders in the last half hour. So, if you get angry about the slow and detailed development of the story, then you miss the best scenes which have an awesome lovecraftian feel.
The DVD  bonuses are very good. The BEHIND THE SCENES and the FX featurettes are very good, and the commentary by Uwe Boll is very good: Tells  a lot about the movie as well as the making of the movie. Also, Uwe's opinion about the film release tactics for films around the time of release of ALONE IN THE DARK, and how they affect the run of the film ALONE IN THE DARK. It's a very good and open commentary about the film.

OVERALL: Its a fun popcorn film( which in many respects goes beyond the popcorn style of film), its exciting, and the bonuses are great DVD  fare. Very fun overall.

As the credits rolled in ""House of the Dead,"" we felt a moment of elation because we realized calling Jack Kevorkian was not necessary, that we would recover from the worst film experience many of us had witnessed in some time. Such was the experience of many viewers' regarding their first encounter with the indomitable Uwe Boll's freshman cinematic disaster. Then came ""Alone in the Dark,"" and the nightmare continued. Who among us will have the bravery to climb to the peak of the highest mountain and shriek at the top of their lungs, ""Get thee behind me, Uwe Boll?"" From the looks of it, just about everyone who has seen this disaster. No one, thankfully, pulls any punches in describing this train wreck.

Christian Slater's character Edward Carnby has a serious problem. No, it's not appearing in Uwe Boll's film, although that would certainly classify as an insurmountable difficulty. Carnby's primary problem, first elaborated on in an introductory screen scrawl that roughly equals the length of the Oxford English Dictionary, involves an ancient race of technologically advanced people called the Abracadabras...er, I mean the Aldonovas...darn, the Abskani! Yeah, that's it, the Abskani. I think. Anyway, these prehistoric yahoos accidentally opened up some portal between the world of light and the world of dark, thus allowing evil creatures that look like something H.G. Giger upchucked after a Jagermeister binge to enter our world. The Abskani died off as a result, but they left behind a bunch of artifacts scattered throughout the world that, if properly collected and utilized, will allow humanity to close the portal once again. If it's been opened in the first place, that is, which apparently occurs when some old coot named Professor Hudgens (Mathew Walker) conducts some crackpot experiment with a bunch of kids. One of these kiddies was Eddie Carnby. Now a whole bunch of years later, Carnby is trying to find out what happened to him when he was just a wee lad.

You'll forgive me if my memory starts to blank at this point, but I'll be darned if I can form a coherent narrative concerning the rest of the film. Hudgens had something to do with forming a top-secret government agency entitled Bureau 713 charged with investigating the paranormal. Carnby was once a member but has since struck out alone much to the chagrin of his former colleague Richards (Stephen Dorff). In the middle of all of this artifact gatherin' we meet Aline Cedrac (Tara Reid), a brainy archeologist and protg of Hudgens who just happened to date Carnby at some point in the past. I'd appreciate it if you stop laughing over the idea of Reid as an archeologist and keep reading the review. Thank you. Anyway, some superhuman yutz tries to kill Carnby but fails, and our hero soon turns up to engage Aline in his current quest to discover his missing past. Boll starts tossing out scene after scene of pure schlock, most of which involve highly stylized gunfights involving Carnby, Cedrac, the jackbooted thugs over at Bureau 713, and the Giger beasties. Everything is just as it seems as ""Alone in the Dark"" judders to its closing credits amidst a shriek of screeching metal and smashing glass. Will Carnby uncover his past? Will Aline Cedrac start wearing contact lenses? Will Richards quit striking macho poses? Who cares?

""Alone in the Dark"" is to film what Chernobyl is to nuclear power. Aside from a few interesting shots, primarily the beasties running through a forest and the glimpses we see of the demons' hiding place, nothing works. The cackhanded script, written by no less than three now unemployable hacks, is so full of plot holes that any attempt to explicate on them here at length is an exercise in futility. The dialogue is the equivalent of fingernails on a chalkboard, the pacing moves in fits and starts, and the acting is utterly hopeless. Tara Reid as a scientist? Strikes one, two, and three right there. Christian Slater and Stephen Dorff try to do right with a horrible script, but I think it's safe to say both men might want to reconsider their career options after appearing in this atrocity. I hear Kmart is hiring. Dorff especially is in big trouble. With ""Feardotcom"" and ""Alone in the Dark"" on his resume, he'll be lucky to qualify for welfare. Congratulations, Uwe Boll--you've managed to wreck more careers than the Hollywood blacklist.

What really frightens me about Boll is his upcoming project ""Bloodrayne."" I feel that I should go see this film in the theater. Why? Because the inevitable comparisons between this director and Ed Wood practically demand that lovers of bad cinema should sit up and pay attention. I never had the chance to see ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" on the big screen, but I do have the opportunity to see an Uwe Boll disaster at the local multiplex. One day that might mean something. Or it might keep me out of heaven. Either way, Herr Boll's formidable prowess at churning out total pap seems impervious to the outraged shrieks of the viewing public.

2248874,1,B0007XBM5W,"One of the new Hollywood trends has been adapting videogames into movies. This is not necessarily anything new, but has gotten more popular with the success of the Tomb Raider and Resident Evil films. I play video games and love the thin backstories for the interactive videogame experience. However, most of these movies should never have seen the light of day.
I knew it would be trouble when the movie opens with the longest narrated text thread I have ever witnessed. Whatever happened to the protagonist explaining the setup as part of the movie? The story opens with a decent action sequence, but the movie makes little sense.
The strange secret government task force looks ridiculous and are as ever ineffectual. They need to rely on the rogue former agent (Christian Slater) to save the day. Slater really sleepwalks through this film but who could blame him. None of the other acting is better. Tara Reid stumbles with her dialogue and Stephen Dorff could not have been more ridiculous as the leader of Section 713.
The movie ends mysteriously and open ended. Hopefully no sequel is in the making. One thing that occurred to me in reflecting on ""Alone in the Dark"" was how much it seemed like the movie was made as cutscenes for the videogame. The command center particularly evoked this suspicion.
I titled this review ""worst Videogame movie ever"" and I believe it. I've seen some bad ones too. The ""street Fighter"" film comes to mind as well as the misguided ""super Mario Brothers"". This one takes the prize.",1117929600,2,1519,4.801526717557252

2248877,4,B0007XBM5W,"So many reviewers have attacked this movie so harshly that I don't know where to begin.  The story is hard to follow; so what?  I'd rather this than something like ""Bourne Identity.""  Wasn't that also hard to follow?  At least the action in A.i.t. D is exciting and its easy to follow why it happens.

The movie has an ending - another thing a lot of movies (and books) these days don't have.  There's several parts in the movie with dialogue, meaning that the main character tells you what he knows and what he's thinking several times, including at the end.

There's plenty of things that happen in the latter half of the movie that explain things from the first half, such as how the creatures only weakness is elements... 77-80, I think if was.  And one of those is gold, which is what the ""evil"" was sealed in on the ship.

""I can't stand the heavy metal music!!!""  What heavy metal music?!  There's about 30 seconds of Mnemic's ""Ghost"" during the first scene where the humans go ballistic shooting at the creatures.  And for anyone who says that this ""heavy"" metal is terrible, why don't you try actually listening to it, rather than just hearing it, before you officially declare it ""noise.""  I found out about this movie from a Nuclear Blast magazine.  The soundtrack for this album is featured in the winter 2005 catalog.  Ghost is on the soundtrack, and the 2 songs that play during the credits of the movie are on it - Nightwish's ""Wish I Had an Angel"" and Deathstar's ""Synthetic Generation.""  Alone in the Dark contains 6 music videos - all metal, but not HEAVY metal.  They are by Mnemic, Nightwish, Kataklysm, Hypocrisy, Dimmu Borgir, and In Flames.  This ""heavy"" metal and the songs on the soundtrack barely have anything to do with the movie at all.  Most of the music in the movie is just creepy orchestrated music like you'd see in any other movie.  Its not like there's actual ""songs"" like there are in movies like Daredevil and Big Daddy.

I enjoyed watching the movie.  No joke.  And I'm not some psycho who loves evil or something.  I like good movies and don't like boring movies.  And I liked this movie.  The acting is good, the suspense is far from lacking, the visual quality for all the non-realistic features was amazing, and the story progressed at a perfect rate.  ""What story?!?!""  The story of the one failure in the experiment to merge man with creature trying to discover more about the other 19 from his orphanage - that story.  Speaking of that orphanage... the scene where Edward (the main character) discovers his orphanage and his friends discover his name on one of the beds is done just as well as scenes similar to this one in other movies.

Now for messages...  At the end of the movie, Edward talks to the viewer about how evil was released into the world once again and hasn't been sealed 10 movie-minutes earlier.  Anyone who stops and thinks for just a second can pick up the symbolism for terror and such in our world today.  And to find out what released it, look back at the symbolism from the scene on the boat where what's-his-face opened up the golden (remember when I mentioned that earlier?) box.  Sure, this message isn't as superior as the one in Big Daddy, but it ranks up there with Head of State, Memento, Life...

I don't STRONGLY recommend this movie, but it sure deserves more of a chance than what my fellow reviewers are saying it does.",1117843200,3,3402,4.557755775577558

This may be the worst movie ever made - which is a good or bad thing, depending on how you get your kicks.  The story makes no sense.  Indeed, I'm still not sure what any of these people were doing or why they were doing it - although I think it had something to do with the gateway to Hell, weird looking beastie things that don't like light (cause they're from Hell, natch), zombified kung-fu fightin' orphans (yes, really), a secret military unit named ""713,"" some ancient Native Americans called Abskani that nobody had heard of until Tara Reid showed up and (inexplicably) Christian Slater in a leather trench coat and a six shootin' pistol (yes, all of that is actually in the film).  The direction is so incredibly poor that it must be seen to be believed.  Uwe Boll is simply amazing.  He's either the worst filmaker of the past 30 years or a comedic wunderkind.  Seriously.  I would not be at all surprised if 10 years from now, Spike Jonze revealed that Uwe Boll was his alter ego and that he made these movies just to see how the American public would react - i.e., ""could people be so dumb that they would honestly enjoy this crud?""  The acting is almost insufferable.  Christian Slater as a rogue, brooding paranormal investigator (I guess that accounts for his pseudo-urban-cowboy-by-way-of-Indiana-Jones-meets-Lara-Croft get up . . . well, as much as anything CAN account for that look),  Tara Reid as his archeologist girlfriend (yes, that Tara Reid; what's really frightening is that Tara Reid as an archeologist is the most believable part of the movie - and yes, I realize that I'm talking about someone stupid enough to have their breast fall out on the red carpet and then stand there while everyone snaps pictures before going, ""hey, did my breast just fall out?""), former Baywatch extras as members of an elite squad of paranormal investigators that go around shooting things with big guns that look suspiciously like augmented paintball rifles (no bull; that's what happens).

In other words, this is bad movie hog-heaven.  If you dug Mystery Science Theatre, you'll dig this (for all the wrong reasons, of course, but you'll dig it just the same).  If you are not a fan of ""so bad it's good"" movies, stay as far away from this film as possible.

Five stars for being so unrelentingly awful.  Again, Uwe Boll is either a genius or the most insane, stupid, and just plain imcompetent filmaker ever (which, in itself, it sort of a weird form of genius - one best appreciated from afar, granted, but still . . . ).

Being dangled by red hot nipple clamps over a pit of cactus and scorpions would be less painful than sitting through this menage a trash about aliens, monsters, nefarious scientists, abducted children, a paranormal putz and Tara Reid as a museum curator. Pinch me, I must be dreaming.

Better a pinch than a slap in the face, which is what this hokey poky of a film delivers. Alone in the Dark is supposedly based on an old Atari game, one that I've never heard of. What I do remember about old Atari games was their rudimentary graphics and storylines. I doubt the film= s extended back story was even a consideration.

So in order to fill in the blanks, writers Elan Mastai, Michael Roesch, and Peter Scheerer borrow and steal from other films. Better films. Films that make you realize you= re not just watching an imitation, but a really bad imitation, like Chuck Norris doing his one man tribute to Judy Garland. I'll admit his rendition of Easter Parade had me in tears, but only because he was kicking me in the face.

That's what it felt like watching Alone in the Dark. I don= t mind dumb, stupid horror films, but I hate dumb, stupid horror films that refuse to acknowledge that fact. Alone in the Dark arrives with such a poker face its impossible to know if we= re supposed to take any of this seriously. We are, but we don= t, or more precisely, can= t. There= s no leeway in the script, direction or acting.

Government conspiracies abound (after a slavishly long opening crawl) in Alone in the Dark, which finds paranormal investigator Edward Carnby (Christian Slater) teaming up with an elite group of government agents to defeat an ancient evil. As an orphan, Edward escaped the clutches of unscrupulous government agent/scientist Lionel Hudgens (Matthew Walker), whose depraved experiments turned children into crossbred zombies. Now that Hudgens has found the final key to unlock the portal between dark and light, it's up to Edward, former lover and curator Aline Cedrac (Reid) and commando leader Burke (Stephen Dorff) to save mankind.

Yeah, that= s who I would call when ultimate evil decides to bitch slap humanity: two actors riding that direct-to-video rail and an actress best known for flashing paparazzi. Was this a casting decision or payback? Director Uwe Boll (The House of the Dead) isn=t much help, never allowing the actors to step outside of the paper-thin box or express any emotion beyond the written word. If everyone in front or behind the camera just acknowledged the obvious, Alone in the Dark would have been a hoot. Computer-generated monsters that never seem to occupy the same frame as the actors, trigger-happy commandos, a convoluted plot that makes no sense, paper doll characters, all the trappings of a goofy good time.

Following up his previous crapfest 'House Of The Dead' is this film, 'Alone In The Dark'.  And once again, he sodomizes us with one of the worst film ever put to celluloid.

Probably my favorite thing about Boll is his complete disregard for continuity or coherent story, and he desregards both in spades in 'Alone In The Dark'.  There is no thread of a plot in this film's running time.  Nothing makes any sense.  People show up randomly to places that you have no idea why they are there.

2248895,1,B0007XBM5W,"I remember reading all the horrible, horrible reviews for this film when it came out. I meant to go see how horrible it was but it was out of theatres in three weeks. The only other movie to manage that is Gigli.

When the movie came out on DVD, I bought it to see how awful it was. I couldn't think of the sheer horrorible attention that this film was getting was possible. After seeing it, I can understand.

First off, let me say that this film is not without some cool shots. There's a nice shot at the beginning that shows a bullet being fired from inside the gun, which I thought was neat. And the way the monsters in this movie die is sort of cool to look at; but it gets old after the first time you see it.

Let me start with the worst thing in this movie: Tara Reid. If bad acting was a sin, then Hell would've chucked Tara Reid right out since she's so unbelievably awful in this movie it's unthinkable. And of all the roles, she plays a curator. Now if she played a dumb, empty-headed sex toy then maybe I might be able to forgive her for how she treats her character. Apparently, Uwe Boll didn't realize that, although he did seem to think that if she took off her shirt in the movie, people would see it. He just didn't realize that making her do that in the middle of the film at the absolute wrong moment just made the movie even more hilariously bad. And is that a mexican song or something during the scene of dry humping? I couldn't tell.

Which brings me to my next complaint: Uwe Boll shows off some of the worst directing skills you'll ever see in a movie. I mean, I'd give House of the Dead an F (and I only do that for very few movies) but HotD would score at least a B compared to this screwed up piece of junk. The movie starts off with a very, very long narration that causes immediate confusion (and read by a horrible narrarator) and from there, the cuts are really, really dumb. There's this one point where Slater and Reid are looking around a building that's been destroyed and the screen blackens out. When it comes back, Slater and Reid are shotting everywhere and suddenly, an entire army has joined them. Huh?

And someone did NOT bother checking the mistakes in this movie. At one point, a team breaks through glass, but the glass breaks before they touch it. Tara Reid's earrings switch colors in the middle of one scene and after Slater walks away from a dead commrade, you can see her begin to get up.

As for the story... I was really lost. Something about an old tribe releasing darkness and someone ""opens the path"" or something and all the evil monsters pop out. It's just an excuse to have a lot of gun scenes (the technology is so advanced here that no character ever needs to reload in this film) that get, quite simply, BORING.

I've always thought that Christian Slater was a good actor who always got stuck in bad movies and this movie is no exception. He does the best he can with the script he was given, but still it is a movie based on a video game that should have stayed a video game. The acting is sub-par, the script unbelievable (which may explain the acting) and just not really an entertaining movie. So my recommendation is that you save your hard earned money (and an hour and a half of your life) for another movie.

QUICK SYNOPSIS

Edward Carnby (Christian Slater) is a paranormal investigator and ex-member of a government run paranormal response team called 713. He has recently recovered an artifact that is the key to opening a door to dark and evil world. There are powers that be that would like to get a hold of this artifact and sends his monsters to retrieve it. Ed must find a way to stay alive and keep the creatures from behind the door from coming into our world.",1116979200,,980,4.433333333333334
2248898,1,B0007XBM5W,"Now, I've seen some bad movies in my lifetime, but this one just takes the cake (right up there with Bram Stoker's ""The Mummy"").  Uwe Boll's perception of an ideal horror/action flick is putrid!

For starters, the film makes absolutely no sense at all (the best you'll get out of a storyline is the three minute read intro) & constantly jumps from scene to scene (one moment, Slater's on a plane, the next he's involved in a Taxi Cab chase/collision).  The battle sequences are downright laughable.  You'll frequently be seeing humans interacting with CGI monsters for the remainder of the film.

Come to think of it, the film doesn't have a single positive trait (except for when it ends) just a bunch of bloody-senseless action, comprised with CGI effects to supposedly live true to the game's original essence (or at least in Boll's lethargic eyes).  The film brings absolutely nothing new to the table & is simply painful to watch.

What's really baffling is how (after watching the behind-the-scenes footage) the film's producers actually thought they were crafting something phenomenal when developing the movie.  Slater himself stressed as to how much of a ""Masterpiece"" the film would expectedly turn out to be (the film was supposedly to place his ill-faded career back on the map) for he was very passionate about taking part in AITD.  Sadly, the film does nothing but add insult to injury to both his & Dorff's careers.

Avoid this film at all costs!  Only watch this film to decipher what NOT to do when making a film.  You've been warned!  It's a real shame.  AITD was one of the very first videogame series (if not the first) to construct ""Survivor Horror,"" & this is the way it's rewarded.",1116633600,2,1704,4.791095890410959

This movie adaption of ALONE IN THE DARK seemed like a mish-mash of Alien, Matrix, Invasion of Body Snatchers, Starship Troopers, a bad Zombie movie and Predator all attempted to be stirred into the same pot to magically come out a masterpiece.

2248906,1,B0007XBM5W,"This movie is about as entertaining as watching someone else play a video game, and badly.  There is the thinnest of plots, which involves little more than the characters shooting their ways through one situation after another with cool guns.

Stephan Dorff plays Burke, leader of what we are supposed to believe is some sort of elite government fighter squad organized to battle paranormal monsters.  They consist of burly men who look the part, and super-foxy women of color who don't.  They aren't very good at their jobs, either, because killing them is as easy as stepping on ants. Stephen Dorff has one one emotion in this movie, the same one he relies on in every movie:  intense.  He scowls and looks intense.  It's hard to buy because, well, he looks so short.  And he always leads them into a building via the easiest route possible:  They rapel in slow motion through skylight windows.

Tara Reid...well.  She's easy to look at, I guess, but she squeaks her lines, and we're supposed to believe that a woman THAT young has somehow managed to become assistant curator of a large museum.  (IMDB says that Reid's trademark is her deep raspy voice--DEEP?  Well, maybe she cultivated the squeak through voice lessons.) But Burke is impressed enough with her credentials as an anthropologist to let her accompany him (with Slater's character, Carnby) on a mission to Destroy All Monsters, and can't seem to wait to give her high-powered weaponry, which she uses masterfully without any training whatsoever. Yeah, government agents are always that eager to give guns to bimbos. Maybe she was a Navy SEAL before landing the gig at the museum, who knows.

There are no suprises in this movie.  It consists of one  battle after another, with no sense of rising tension or progressive complication.  The characters are interchangeable and two-dimensional, and we never really care what happens to them.

-Nothing was good about the movie.

- The over use of Slow motion in the first 25 min. of the movie.

- Terrible acting.(P.s: Christian Slater is terrible, and Terra Reid bad too.)

- Terrible Plot. It was so confusing the whole time.

2248908,1,B0007XBM5W,"""Alone in the Dark"" is without doubt one of the worst movies of 2005. It is not offensive bad, no racial remarks, no sexist points of view, just pure and simple Hollywood studio system trash. I heard a lot of people say this is a bad movie. The critics bashed it left and right, but, I'm stubborn. I never believe public opinion. I alway think people over do things. They make movies out to be worst than they actually are. Well, for once I agree with the mass majority, ""Alone in the Dark"" is a diaster. But you may ask why? I shall explain.

 There is a term used by screenwriters known as ""beat"". You may not be familiar with the term, but, trust me you know the device. A beat is that twsit that happens in a movie. It's that big action sequence or the moment when we find out the character's mother is really her sister, or it's that moment when we find out Bruce Willis is really dead. Are you starting to catch on? Screenwriters keep these scenes in so the audience won't get bored. Hollywood seems to believe that an MTV generation has a short attention span, now, maybe they (Or I should say ""we"", I'm 22) do, but the movie is just a big pile of action sequences and no story. Like clockwork every 15 minutes we get a big action scene, the movie even starts off with one. That was my first indication I was in trouble. When a movie starts off with a big action sequence it is a set-up of what to expect; all action , no plot or character development. But it's not just the action scene that bothered me. Going into a movie like this you have to expect that. But, what I didn't expect was the lousy editing, acting, dialogue and directing. The movie tries to be stylish for no reason at all. There is a scene where the camera gets inside opf a gun so we can see a bullet fly out and hit its target. Why was this done? I don't know, maybe director Uwe Boll has watched too many John Woo films. The difference is with Woo the device is used to place importance on the fight scene and create suspense, in ""Alone in the Dark"" it tries to make the movie look ""important"". It's an attempt by the director to say ""Hey look! I'm an artist!"". The movie's editing is so frantic that we can hardly keep an image in our head. Everything is going go so fast, except the time oddly enough, because it felt like this movie was 4 hours!

 And what about this cast. Granted I'm not a big fan of Christian Slater or Tara Reid or even Stephen Dorff, but, you can't be serious with this fellas. Did any of you really think this was going to turn out to be a good movie. Please tell me you were paid a large sum of money for this. And what about Tara Reid? She has been going through a slump it seems. For a while she was making headline and just as fast she has become a b-list celebrity. Reid plays Aline Cedrae an intelligent scientist. How do I know she's intelligent? Why because she wears glasses of course! That is about the only contribution she makes to this movie. The glasses and the fact that she's the only one with long hair seperate her from everyone else. She has no dialogue, and what ever she does have is no more to 1 line or 2 and what lines! All the dialogue comes off as phony. It's what I call people acting normal trying to act normal. You can't act naturally. Either you are or you aren't. The dialogue and acting reminds us of those 1940, 1950 sci-fi movies. Think along the lines of Ed Wood without the big budget. But, I shouldn't just pick on Reid. It's not only her it's everyone! They are all terrible in this this. We don't sense who any of these people are. Nothing is developed. This is a low-point for everyone involved.

 How a movie like this got made is beyond me. And people wonder why I stay away from these action pack big budget movies. From now on all I have to say it ""Did you see ""Alone in the Dark""?"" Please I'm warning you stay away from this movie. There are so many better films out there that you could watch. If you like sci-fi movies, hey, that's fine watch ""Alien"", which is kind of what the ""creatures"" look like. Just please don't waste your time on this.

 Bottom-line: Easily one of the worst movies of 2005. Terrible acting, dialogue, editing and directing. Hopefully this will be the worst movie of the year and all my other movie going experiences will be pleasureable. Here's hoping.",1115856000,2,4331,4.260340632603406

Slater's career has gone downhill over the years, pretty much by taking part in some flop projects.  Both actors sleepwalk through their roles in this latest video game to screen adaptation from director Uwe Boll, the same guy who brought us another video game adaptation, the incredibly bad House of the Dead.

  Anyhoo...I can not believe this thing got made into a movie. I thought I was watching my brother's high school senior project, but then I realized that had some production value. Sure, you have to use your imagination when watching someone jump off the roof of a house when it is suppose to be a cliff ledge, but we are talking a shoestring budget that didn't cover the cost of coke and corn nuts. This was no big budget film that made its way (unforuntatly) into theatres nation wide. But when you see Stephen Dorf in his base of operations for the first time the same thing might cross your mind. They spent all there money on beer anad pizza so all they could afford was third rate props and put them in a condemned building. Never mind the small things like, covering the walls so we can at least keep the illusion that we are in some secret base.

  My brother's movie also had a story that was interesting. It was a combination of the Goonies meet Indian Jones. Maybe Mr. Spielberg might have thought it was cute or just sued them. I dunno. The point is that there was a story there that you could follow and even enjoy. These elements were all missing from AITD. There is not a story here that you can get into or know exactly what is going on.

  I think that that the director and my brother had this in common- they were making it up as they were going along. However, my brother, remember what happened the scene before and this guy did not.

  You may not have heard of Billy Wright, Steven Jacobs, or Greg Rast, but let me tell you after you watch AITD you will wish you never heard the names Slater, Ried, or Dorf again. At least my brothers buddies were doing it for a grade so they could get out of high school. These three were doing it for a paycheck. When was the last time that you heard from Slater? Besides when he is going to prison or getting busted for something? Exactly. I would use one word in paticular to describe all three of them, but Amazon would not like it too much and  ban me for life. Give you a hint, it rhymes with ""bore.""

  I hear this guy is making another film, Maybe I should dust off the super 8 camcorder and mail it my brother. Hey, if this pinhead can do it why can't my brother? He can use his 2 kids this time around.

  Oh, and for you all that gave this thing above 2 stars- get a clue, get a life. Just because it came from a videogame that you played in the basement, nostop becasue no one would go out with you on a Friday night, is no reason to think it is the second coming of movie greatness.

  I will end this with one thing. If you have not seen this do not see it. You may be tempted to check it out at the local dollar theatre. Sure, it's just a buck. But we are talking about time from your life you will never get back. Same goes with renting it. And for the love of everything that you hold sacred and dear in this world, DO NOT BUY THE DVD. If you want to get rid of twenty dollars donate it to a charity. But, if  you do go against my advice, I am one of those people that will say ""told you so.""",1112659200,4,3272,4.046583850931677

This is probably the first time I've walked out of the theater feeling like I had just wasted an afternoon.  It's not the dollar I miss--it's the 90 minutes.

The casting was fantastic.  Tara Reid as an archeologist?  Sure.  But I'll only believe it if she wears black glasses and her hair is up.  The chemistry between Reid and Slater was also fantastic.  The sex scene barely seemed unnatural.  Seriously, why was that scene left in?  Who had that great idea?  I'm a little sad I didn't wait to see this on dvd, because I would be interested in seeing the deleted scenes.  If they left the awkward-out-of-nowhere sex scene in, what did they take out?

Probably the ""best"" part was the writing.  A lot of reviews credit the awkwardness to the actors.  Sure, they might be partly to blame, but they can only do so much with what they're given.  When there's a lot of awkwardness, the director and writers deserve some of the ""credit.""  The first scene with Tara Reid should be viewed in every writing class taught from now until the end of time.

2248924,1,B0007XBM5W,"Uwe Boll is systematically trying to ruin videogame movies, making it so that no video games will become movies. I decided to give it a chance after seeing the horribly abysmal House of the Dead due to the lower budget and the fact that the game House of the Dead had no plot, so why should the movie. However, this new movie has a bigger budget and a more capable cast. Yet the results are the same. Uwe Boll is turning into a modern day Ed Wood--except much less interesting. Hey, at least Ed Wood wore Cashmere.

Alone in the Dark marked the start of the survival horror genre in video games. While Resident Evil is often credited with it, the truth is that Alone in the Dark came first. Resident Evil just made it popular. My problem with the movie comes from the simple fact that Uwe Boll ignored everything Alone in the Dark had to offer and instead relied on a silly sleep-walking/zombie plot that involved blowing everything up in silly sparkly explosions.

Here is where Uwe Boll first went wrong. The original concept of Alone in the Dark was to be just that: ALONE in the dark. The movie would have been much more scary and intense if it were only a set group of people surviving against the horrors that lurk in the dark around them. A group of people surviving with limited ammo and only a flashlight to help them (sorta like Pitch Black) would have been immensely rewarding and a TRUTHFUL adaptation of the video game.

Instead we have a task force that seems to have radar and cameras all over the world and can have a task force to the trouble area quicker than you can say crappy movie cliche. They show up just in the nick of time at least 2-3 times in the movie, spoiling any sense of tension. The movie quickly goes from a quasi-interesting plot involving H.P. Lovecraft themes (which the game is based from) and turns into a bullets flying miasma.

On top of that, it's just plain silly. Sleep-walkers who become white-faced zombies who hiss, moan and generally act stupidly (and who also look like rejects from Uwe Boll's first video game movie House of the Dead)? Monsters who can become invisible but would rather run into the light and stay in sight so they can be shot at? Explosions that look like they belong in an episode of Power Rangers? Action that is neither interesting nor exciting? You too can have all this and $8 ripped from your hands if you go see this movie.

I think the most telling part of how ignorant Uwe Boll is of his audience comes directly from his mouth. In a recent interview with IGN, Uwe Boll states that audiences can't follow a more complicated plot than what happened in Alone in the Dark, that (quote): ""if the movie has two plots or something, if a movie gets a little complicated, then it's too much for the audience."" I think this is very telling of Uwe Boll as a director and what he believes of his intended audience. He has since decided to pick up the rights to a good 5-6 QUALITY video games. Be afraid, be very afraid.

Not that video game movies have to be oscar worthy performances, but sticking close to the source material would be nice. Stick with the game and don't support Uwe Boll's systematic destruction of video game movies. Giving it a one star is being generous.",1111104000,4,3242,4.458684654300169
2248925,4,B0007XBM5W,"Uwe Boll is ahead of the curve.  ALONE IN THE DARK's director is reinventing Hollywood on his own terms and he's not taking any prisoners.  Don't take my word for it; read the interview with LucasArts President, Jim Ward, in the March issue of Game Informer.  Ward and LucasArts are emulating Uwe's strategy.  Uwe understands that when a contemporary video game franchise sells thirty-five million copies the marketing inertia for a cinematic tie-in is enormous.  Revenue potential eclipses the current Hollywood trend to revive nostalgic comic book superheroes of the baby-boom generation.

Of course, to be successful the movie must be entertaining and ALONE IN THE DARK is!  Protagonist Edward Carnby, played by Christian Slater, must unravel the mystery of an evil parallel universe sealed by an ancient Indian tribe.  Along the way he discovers the secrets of the orphanage he was raised in as he deciphers the clues that lead him to his true identity.  Christian's performance is superb.  His subdued, laid back demeanor is a canvas for the melodramatic chaos that engulfs him.  Edward's love interest, a museum caretaker played by Tara Reid, is his constant companion, providing a steady supply of eye candy for the male audience.  Tara treats us to a competent performance without overacting.  The two stars complement each other with a believable chemistry that comes to a head during a sexual encounter that is at once intimate and sensual.  I hope this relationship will continue to develop in a future sequel.  Nothing is sexier than Tara in jeans blowing away the evil dominions!

ALONE IN THE DARK is not a perfect film.  The special effects are top tier while the gore factor is over the top.  I understand this is a subjective evaluation and that too much for some may not be enough for others.  In my opinion less is more.  Repetition diminishes the shock value of outrageous violence.  When a head is split in half the emotional impact is unnerving.  When the same head is shown a few minutes later it feels like the filmmaker wants props for doing such a good job.  Some scenes are overloaded with stroboscopic lighting that diminishes the perception of high production values, while running the risk of inducing headaches.

As I watched ALONE IN THE DARK I paid attention to audience reactions.  I was sitting near some teenage girls who were gasping, shrieking, and taking turns hiding their eyes as girlfriends encouraged each other to look.  At the same time a group of boys that had entered the theater together and were sitting directly behind me were laughing spontaneously.  Diametrically opposed reactions with a common denominator: Everyone was having fun!

Uwe Boll has his detractors, as every artist who pushes the envelope does.  However, I don't know of any films any of them have made.  I do know that some of the best actors and actresses in the business (including an Oscar winner) are clamoring to be involved in an Uwe Boll project.  Uwe's got big balls and he's not afraid to tell it like it is.  He's going to make a lot of money and entertain a lot of people along the way.  I expect big things from this filmmaker and I anticipate he will deliver and, am looking forward to BLOODRAYNE, HUNTER THE RECKONING, FAR CRY, the list goes on ...",1110585600,3,3280,4.841726618705036

I went into this film expecting a cheesy action movie, and when I came out, I was shaking my head in disbelief at what a horrible movie this was. This film makes Ed Wood's look like Scorsase's! He has no sense of direction, hell, he can't even properly adapt a video game, take House of The Dead for example. He also is adapting more video games, which I think is stupid, and damaging to the Video Game industry. Hell, He probably won't stop churning out crap. Christian Slater, what the hell happend?

2248927,1,B0007XBM5W,"Before I go through this, I want to credit Pete Hartlaub for this review. I just wanted to show this to you Amazon buyers in case you are actually considering buying this. Honesty...I will buy a month after it comes out. By then, it'll be in the $5.50 bin at Wal-Mart and it will make for a great Saturday night of laughs. Good grief. Anyways, here's Pete's review.

""Alone in the Dark"" is the best Ed Wood movie never made. It fails so miserably as both an action and horror picture that it succeeds as a comedy. It's a film so mind-blowingly horrible that it teeters on the edge of cinematic immortality.

Just how bad/good is this movie?

Perpetual Maxim cover girl Tara Reid not only plays an archaeologist, but she also utters the phrase, ""I need to study these artifacts"" and on multiple occasions saves the good guys by translating ancient American Indian scripture. No, Paris Hilton and Nicole Ritchie do not show up to perform brain surgery in ""Alone in the Dark,"" but you will fully expect to find that deleted scene on the DVD.

The movie begins with an incredibly long scroll of text explaining a backstory involving a portal to another dimension, an unspeakable evil and orphans who were used as scientific experiments. Just when you think every possible cliche has been used in the first five minutes, Christian Slater shows up as one of those orphans, who has grown up to become a loose-cannon member of a paranormal investigation team and gets thrown off the job.

From the moment Slater appears, it's clear this movie is going to be telling-your-friends-about-it-the-next-day weird.

For starters, the ""Pump up the Volume"" star dresses as if he's raided the wardrobe truck from an early 1990s Jean-Claude Van Damme movie, running through most of ""Alone in the Dark"" in a black ribbed tank top, jeans and brown leather trench coat. At least half of the actor's dialogue appears to have been written for the movie poster tagline. (""Being afraid of the dark is what keeps most of us alive!"") The rest of his lines are delivered in sporadic voice-overs, which seem to have been added in postproduction to spackle in the giant plot holes created by director Uwe Boll.

Let's talk about Boll. What the young director has created here is more of a drinking game than a movie, with scenes that are not only laughably bad but also repeat themselves.

A team of soldiers blows up a hallway full of priceless artwork. (Take a drink.) Reid uses a four-syllable science word when it's clear from her confused delivery that she has no idea what it means. (Drink.) Slater utters yet another cryptic line about his fear of the dark. (Drink.)

Seriously, Boll appears to have one goal here, and that's convincing Tim Burton to film a biopic about him. ""Alone in the Dark"" is the director's second movie based on a video game, and he has at least two more on the way. But no one could create anything this weird without someone else with an established background in bad cinema. And sure enough, the credits list screenwriter Elan Matsai, who also wrote a film called ""MVP2: Most Vertical Primate.""

This movie gets an empty chair, but it just as easily could have received a clapping guy, and probably would have if there were any acknowledgement in the production notes that the whole thing was supposed to be a joke. Add a few oral sex jokes and replace the actors with marionettes, and ""Alone in the Dark"" could end up with rave reviews as a sequel to ""Team America: World Police.""

While the movie isn't quite bad enough to be considered the ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" of the 21st century, it's not overstating matters to call ""Alone in the Dark"" this generation's ""C.H.U.D.""

Every casting decision, camera angle, special effect and sound seems created as a dare to leave the theater. The fight choreography appears to have been taken from an episode of ""Lost in Space,"" the musical score sounds as if it were composed on a 1983 Casio keyboard bought at a garage sale, and even the extras seem as if they were selected for their background incompetence.

On second thought, you probably need to see this movie for yourself. If nothing else, it's worth the bargain-matinee price to watch Slater utter the line ""There's a price to pay for bringing darkness back into the light."" (Drink.)",1110153600,11,4289,4.7026666666666666
2248928,1,B0007XBM5W,"Down right pathetic. It's safe to say that this is and I will mark it down as Stephen Dorff (Cecil B. Demented, Blade, Entropy) and Christian Slater's (Pump Up The Volume, True Romance, Heathers) worst movie they ever did. Slater is this paranormal expert who 22 years ago was part of a lab experiment in which tested on the children in an orphanage. Slater hunts down artifacts from a lost civilization...he was once part of a top elite government group that tracks down a type of creature that preys in the dark and hates the light and no I am not talking about vampires....to put it to you clearly they look like the mutated children of Godzilla. Slater teams up with ex fling/archeologist Tara Reid (Van Wilder, Urban Legend, Cruel Intentions) and his old buddy who he used to work for in the elite government group....played by Dorff. All threw out the movie we suffer from big pulsating headaches while we watch a badly scripted, sloppily directed movie with corny twists and turns in which we know who is gonna die and live. Directed by House Of The Dead director Uwe Boll and I can tell you this movie is Bolls**t. He cant direct crap. What a waste of actors and what a waste of my time. Divert this toxic waste. Why, well if you wanna suffer with action scenes with music scores of heavy metal and a corny love scene with Reid and Slater with the cheesiest music...this is your ticket.",1109894400,4,1394,4.535714285714286

Boll is a blight to the cinema and video game industries respectively. Slater proves that had he not been the son of a casting director (Mary Jo Slater), he'd be doing bad summer stock somewhere in La Jolla.

The film is great for a bad movie party, though -- the film is unintentionally a laugh riot, and prime for riffing.",1109808000,7,474,4.511627906976744
2248930,1,B0007XBM5W,"Ok, let me preface this by saying I hated House of the dead.

That being said, I can't believe I put myself through the torture of seeing this movie.  I'm not going to rehash what every other non paid reviewer said about what was wrong with Alone in the Dark.  I am going to say this though...I think if the movie studios that bankroll this directors projects want to just waste a few million dollars they should just wire the moolah to my bank account.  If I bought a billion used golf balls and went around shooting them at trees with a wrist rocket. It would be a far more productive way to spend their money than giving it to any project associated with this director.  The Ed wood references made by other reviewers are an insult to Ed Wood. Eddy was Alfred Hitchcok compared to this guy.  Maybe the fans of the genre Uwe Boll is mutilating should form an angry mob and beat him until he agrees to leave the world of cinema and become a hermit in siberia.  Anything less should not be accepted.  Seriously, don't see Alone in the Dark.  Don't see house of the dead.  Don't see ANYTHING with Uwe Bolls' name attached to it.

Slater need a new agent, he is in yet another dog of a film - he is a fairly good actor who can do alot of the physical stuff required for this movie in a convincing manner.

Halfway through all the explosions and carnage I started looking at my watch - ""GAME OVER""! The saddest thing about this debacle is that this movie had alot of potential to be good.

Speaking of love sessions: WHERE DID THE SEX SCENE COME FROM?! Tara Reid(crappy actor #1) walks in and lies down next to Christian Slater (crappy actor #2) and suddenly, they're having sex!! Sheesh! Where did that come from?! Anyways...this movie has a stupid plot, and is very confusing. It makes NO sense whatsoever. By the end of the movie, the normal people are done trying to make sense of it and just laughing their butts off. The rest walk out and give it five star ratings like the idiots they are. Not even Tara Reid's hotness could save this one. Don't even consider seeing it, you're running the risk of wasting five bucks.

2248947,1,B0007XBM5W,"Uwe Boll is systematically trying to ruin the videogame to movie path.  I decided to give it a chance after seeing the horribly abysmal House of the Dead due to the lower budget and the fact that the game House of the Dead had no plot, so why should the movie.  However, this new movie has a bigger budget and a more capable cast.  Yet the results are the same.  Uwe Boll is turning into a modern day Ed Wood--except much less interesting.  Hey, at least Ed Wood wore Cashmere.

Alone in the Dark marked the start of the survival horror genre in video games.  While Resident Evil is often credited with it, the truth is that Alone in the Dark came first.  Resident Evil just made it popular.  My problem with the movie comes from the simple fact that Uwe Boll ignored everything Alone in the Dark had to offer and instead relied on a silly sleep-walking/zombie plot that involved blowing everything up in silly sparkly explosions.

Here is where Uwe Boll first went wrong.  The original concept of Alone in the Dark was to be just that:  ALONE in the dark.  The movie would have been much more scary and intense if it were only a set group of people surviving against the horrors that lurk in the dark around them.  A group of people surviving with limited ammo and only a flashlight to help them (sorta like Pitch Black) would have been immensely rewarding and a TRUTHFUL adaptation of the video game.

Instead we have a task force that seems to have radar and cameras all over the world and can have a task force to the trouble area quicker than you can say crappy movie cliche.  They show up just in the nick of time at least 2-3 times in the movie, spoiling any sense of tension.  The movie quickly goes from a quasi-interesting plot involving H.P. Lovecraft themes (which the game is based from) and turns into a bullets flying miasma.

On top of that, it's just plain silly.  Sleep-walkers who become white-faced zombies who hiss, moan and generally act stupidly (and who also look like rejects from Uwe Boll's first video game movie House of the Dead)?  Monsters who can become invisible but would rather run into the light and stay in sight so they can be shot at?  Explosions that look like they belong in an episode of Power Rangers?  Action that is neither interesting nor exciting?  You too can have all this and $8 ripped from your hands if you go see this movie.

I think the most telling part of how ignorant Uwe Boll is of his audience comes directly from his mouth.  In a recent interview with IGN, Uwe Boll states that audiences can't follow a more complicated plot than what happened in Alone in the Dark, that (quote): ""if the movie has two plots or something, if a movie gets a little complicated, then it's too much for the audience.""  I think this is very telling of Uwe Boll as a director and what he believes of his intended audience.  He has since decided to pick up the rights to a good 5-6 QUALITY video games.  Be afraid, be very afraid.

Not that video game movies have to be oscar worthy performances, but sticking close to the source material would be nice.  Stick with the game and don't support Uwe Boll's systematic destruction of video game movies.  Giving it a one star is being generous.",1107129600,12,3225,4.452218430034129

Talon: Wow! I had hope. I had honest-to-god hope. For those who don't know, Alone in the Dark was a kick-ass survival horror game, in which you get bombarded with jump scares, free roam, battle gory monsters by crafting wicked inventions like inflammable bullets, and solving puzzles.

Pure fun.

I played it a lot when I was younger, so discovering they made a film based of it had my stomach tingling.

Joe: I warned you it was supposed to be bad. That's the point of this blog.

Talon: Then the movie started, with the longest infodump scroll in movie history.

Joe: It went on forever. I've published short stories that had fewer words. And none of it really mattered.

Talon: I knew, as I read on and on, my nostalgic memories of playing the video game were going to be crushed. This should have been done through action and dialog.

Joe: I'll vote it shouldn't have been done at all.

Talon: A headache formed behind my eyes, and the movie hadn't even started.

Now, I don't want to sound like a critic, or a jerk, I love movies: People pour their heart and souls into making them...

But if I had to read one more damn page of how Edward Carnby had psychic powers and he's a supernatural detective and he's an orphan and he used to work for Bureau 713. Gah!

So after a flashback scene which was a dream, we're with Carnby and he's narrating about his life and repeating all the things mentioned in the info-dump scroll.

Joe: Voice over narration is often used when the editor realizes, post-production, that the film doesn't make sense. I dunno if there was VO in the original script, but it didn't add to the movie at all. Nor did it help the onscreen action make sense.

Talon: Then a fun action chase scene happens, which is what I expected since this was a high-budget (twenty million dollar) action movie.

Joe: The foot chase and fight was fun, if you checked your brain at the door. But Slater is fighting a zombie dude, when the main antagonists are semi-invisible monsters. This was probably explained in the infodump scroll at the beginning, or through voiceover, but I still don't get it. There aren't any more zombie dudes in the rest of the movie, just those alien things.

Talon: Then it began to drag, and the remainder of the movie left me unfulfilled.

Joe: I actually had to stop the movie to make espresso to stay awake. Couldn't say the same about my fave Uwe Boll film, HOUSE OF THE DEAD. That was an entertaining bad movie. This one was like watching traffic pass by at 3am on a backwoods road in Wisconsin.

Acting wasn't bad. The movie looked good, except for some sketchy CGI. It had nothing to do with the videogame it was based off of, other than use the protagonist's name. I always enjoy watching Slater and Reid. He traded his Jack Nicholson impersonation for gym-time to buff up.

Talon: The movie was like a so-so omelette with no seasoning.

Here's some of the dialog my dad and I had while viewing. Try to imagine some of our phrases as catchy slogans:

""Perfect for insomniacs!

""This makes me want to cut myself and roll in salt.""

""Are you sleeping?""
""No...""
""If you weren't asleep, tell me what just happened.""
""Nothing.""
""Correct.""

""Hurts me in my pleasure center.""

""Based on a video game they've never played.""

""They went down into the hive, and then immediately tried to escape from the hive. What was the point?""

Joe: I did love that female soldier who got her head cleaved in half. That was a really decent special effect.

Talon: Then, after a brutal 90 minutes, the best death scene of all time. I ruptured a kidney laughing so hard. Let me explain.

So, Carnby and his girl (Aline Cedrac) make it out of a cave where the super crazy alien hive was located. The Commander of the 713 (Richard Burke) stays back to destroy the nest with a bomb.

In the climactic scene (the pounding music lets us know it's the climax), Richard grabs the bomb, sets the timer for five(!) seconds, arms and throws it into the hive, then dies from the explosion while trying to outrun it.

I could not stop laughing.

Maybe if he set the timer for, idk, maybe more than five seconds? He woulda had a chance to escape.

Joe: And there was no urgency. We didn't see thousands of monsters running for the exit, about to escape. They were all just chillin'. He could have set the timer for fifteen minutes, had a smoke, and walked out of there at a leisurely pace.

Talon: R.I.P Commander Richard. Killed by a five second bomb timer he set himself.

Too funny.

Even though Carnby and Cedrac had been adversarial with him for half the movie, then best buddies for the second half, they get over his death rather quick and the narrator tells us the whole city has been evacuated...

Except for that guy driving over there in the background! No joke!",1484611200,,5177,4.828798185941043

8053499,3,B0007XBM5W,"It's noted that this film is based on an Atari video game and it shows.  As soon as team enters the mad scientist's ""secret lair"" the video game aspects make themselves obvious. I even heard someone watching this film comment on this.

Basing his work on trying to obtain the knowledge of the Abskani, an ancient race which 10,000 years ago got themselves annihilated by ""forced unknown,"" a scientist heads a government-funded program experimenting on children using orphans from a Catholic orphanage.  The nun in charge knows of his intentions but does nothing to stop him, except, when the program is shut down and he takes all the children away, she has the task of reporting to the authorities that 20 children disappeared overnight from her care.  One child escapes, and--though the means aren't explained--becomes a parapsychologist, investigating supernatural/paranormal occurrences. A series of incidents alerts him to the fact that the program in which he was a part is being resurrected, and the fun (?) begins...

It's an entertaining movie, plenty of killing and destruction, but nothing new, and the ending...it isn't even an ending. Some scenes are disjointed and others just plain leave the viewer wondering. The monsters are reminiscent of the animated gargoyles in the original ""Ghostbusters,"" but what it all comes down to, is the question:  What's it all about?

Don't know if I want to watch it again to see if I can find the answer the second time around.

8053501,5,B0007XBM5W,"Alone in the Dark, despite it's reputation for being a cacophony of c-level has-beens and Ripley Scott ripoffs may in fact be the perfect film.

Now for reasons I cannot get into, I am unable to speak on the first half of this cinematic landfill of creative ideas, but at the heart of all the freshman year CGI, Christian Slater, Tara Reid, and Stephen Dorff provide plenty of exposition, scientific talk that sounds like it might be believable, and first take line deliveries that anyone can understand. Tara Reid, the perpetual party girl even into her later is there such a thing as party woman or is that just called a wino years plays our lead archaeologist (OBVIOUSLY). Whose main contribution to the plot is to remind up that these almost Xenomorphs are spoopy and dangerous, reading at one point ancient hieroglyphics that inform them that if they're down here, they're already dead. Because long dead civilizations chose to deliver any and all information in their tombs in the form of Are You Afraid of The Dark style riddles.

As for Stephen Dorff and Christian Slater, the two spend most of the film doing this wonderful impression of one another, which is a gift to the audience, because it's less personalities you have to keep track of. These 3 and countless unnamed soldiers are attacked by dozens of these reptilian-like monsters and there is a climactic and violent 20-minute fight where almost all creatures and humans kill one another. This unblinking CGI fiesta set to blank backgrounds and general Rob Zombie-esque music is a perfect slice of early 2000s aesthetic.

So our three main characters venture underground further? And find a generic ancient cave hole that apparently all the aliens spawn from, Stephen Dorff blows himself up as well as the aliens to put the threat to rest for the next probably 6 minutes.

The film ends with Slater and Reid coming back to the surface at dawn, only to find that the generic city is suddenly without people, cars abandoned on the streets, like they wandered onto the I AM LEGEND set and Uwe Boll knew how to take advantage of a free filming situation. They walk down the street, but several noises are heard. The last shot shows them in the middle of an empty road turning around to be attacked by the camera I mean Xenomorph, I MEAN ORIGINAL ALIEN CREATURE.... regardless of it being day, and the monsters are supposedly only able to function at night. 11 out of 10 stars, would definitely recommend.
