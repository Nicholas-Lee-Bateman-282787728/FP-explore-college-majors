4666802,5,B005ELVC9I,I saw this on PBS television recently and decided to buy it so I can view it again.  It is very informative!,1445385600,,108,3.909090909090909
4666803,5,B005ELVC9I,Excellent video.,1441929600,,16,7.5
4666804,4,B005ELVC9I,Too much to present in too little a time.  This was a good overall piece.  The Vatican isn't going to let anyone go so far as making a detailed DVD,1439424000,,147,3.8666666666666667
4666805,5,B005ELVC9I,It wrecks grate and locks grate,1424908800,,31,4.333333333333333

4666808,5,B005ELVC9I,Beautiful access to The Vatican.  Brought me back to that amazing place I visited with my dear Father!,1416700800,,102,4.666666666666667
4666809,5,B005ELVC9I,"Very interesting video, worth sharing. Includes a lot of history about how the vatican began, never heard about this in school",1390521600,,126,5.0476190476190474
4666810,5,B005ELVC9I,"I learned so many things I didn't know.  And I got to see where all the popes are interned . . . even my favorite, John Paul.",1387756800,,125,3.6296296296296298
4666811,5,B005ELVC9I,"Very interesting video that gives you facts about the operations of the Vatican.  The video touches on different issues about the Vatican.  It's a good source of information, especially for those Catholics that can't afford to visit the place.",1381449600,2,243,5.205128205128205
4666812,4,B005ELVC9I,I found some parts of this video very informative like the tour of the Scavi.  They tried to do too many things and some of them superfically and some like the tour of the centuries of documents that have not been viewed it seemed like they spent an inordinate amount of time on.,1380672000,,279,4.264150943396227
4666813,5,B005ELVC9I,"Fabulous footage and historical details! My only negative feeling about this documentary is that since so much of the secret Vatican areas were shown so fast sometimes, I kept hitting the pause button to have time to appreciate the eye popping grandeur!",1378339200,5,253,5.0476190476190474
4666814,5,B005ELVC9I,A treasure to have in your collectio. Historical but up close and personal views that may not be possible in a normal tour of the Vatican.,1376524800,2,138,4.346153846153846
4666815,5,B005ELVC9I,Saw the Vatican this May and did not learn all of the details about if beforehand.  Would have been nice to review this prior to the trip and tour.,1371427200,,147,4.068965517241379
4666816,5,B005ELVC9I,This DVD provides much insight into the history of the Vatican. It takes you into areas that you would not be able to access if you went there on a tour. The history is fascinating.,1370995200,3,181,4.2
4666827,5,B005ELVC9I,I worked with Guy Consolmagno at the Vatican for a short time and got to see much of what was in this program. It's a good one for those going to the Vatican or who have visited there. A breathtaking place even for an old Protestant.,1367366400,2,233,4.086956521739131
4666828,4,B005ELVC9I,I purchased this as a gift. I saw the production on TV; a family member missed it. Now she has it. It arrived right on time.,1365724800,,124,3.8076923076923075
4666829,5,B005ELVC9I,I have been completely satisfied with all my purchases.  Thanks for your good service.  Best wishes for your continued success.,1363392000,,127,5.3
4666830,5,B005ELVC9I,"WOnderful information. Was a gift for a friend. She loves it also.
Shows so many of the beaurtiful things in the Vatican that the  general public will never be able to enjoy.",1362614400,5,174,4.4375
4666831,5,B005ELVC9I,This is the first time I ordered something that I saw on the History Channel - it is great - and a good addition to anyone's personal DVD Library.,1361836800,4,146,4.068965517241379
4666832,5,B005ELVC9I,"This is an impressive, fast-paced (and entertaining) film.  It is a balanced view (in my opinion) of what is essentially the geophysical (or geopolitical)center of the Catholic Church today. Chronologically, it overlaps the DVD, ""Holy Secrets: Electing a Pope"", and goes beyond, to the present reign of Pope Benedict XVI.  It is also twice as long! Thus, it would be best utilized in viewing its sections individually (if using it in a classroom setting, as I have done). These sections are chronological in an of themselves. (So, for example, you could use the section on ""Church&State"" issues for one class session, while the section on ""Church&Science"" could be another session.)
Frankly, I think this is a ""warts-and-all"" look at the actual physical/governing center of the Church. (Just because it is not an anti-Catholic polemic doesn't mean A&E is going to the ""other"" side. Lighten up folks.)",1359936000,8,900,5.157534246575342
4666833,5,B005ELVC9I,This movie showed all the facts and secrets of the Vatican that I thought I would never known. This is the Best!,1354838400,4,112,4.136363636363637
4666834,1,B005ELVC9I,"Considering the true secrecy of the Vatican and the gravity of its secrets, it's not reasonable to expect that the Vatican was actually going to give us Secret Access, and such expectation is fully met in this film.  In reality, the Romans are powerful, invasive, and often hidden, such as in the Jesuits, and this film approaches none of these political agendas.

In the film, you'll get to see the Roman pontiff's extravagant wardrobe and jewelry, some insignificant shots of the archives, the catacombs, etc., all of which are commonly known.  What makes me suspect of the intentions of the History channel is its reference in the film to the pontiff as ""His holiness.""

If you're Roman Catholic, the film will be entertaining, at best.  If you're suspect of the Vatican's banking practices, John Paul I's assassination, the infiltration of freemasons into the Vatican, its liberal theology, yadda yadda yadda, you will probably learn one main thing from this film: what seems to be driving the dis-History Channel.",1337385600,2,1018,5.035714285714286
4666835,5,B005ELVC9I,"Highly recommend this to anyone who has wondered about the ""secrets"" held within the Vatican. In fact, this DVD is for those who have even been there!! Because many of the things that are video taped could not be seen by the average visitor! I have been there and taken the tour more than once but I never got to see where Saint Peter was buried nor his tomb! I never got to see the Vatican archives or the burial chambers of the Popes of the past. I never got to see where the Papal collection of jewelry was held or even what some of them looked like. It reaches far beyond religion. This video in short is AMAZING and educational. It is so amazing that I intend to buy multiple copies for my European friends! They, on any given weekend, can go to the Vatican to see the highlights of shown in the DVD - even if they can't go ""behind the scenes"". This DVD will impress them. The architecture, the history, the works of art, the sheer vastness of the Vatican is on display for all to see in this DVD. This video actually answered all of the questions that I ever had and then some. We all knew that the foundation of the Vatican was Peter's tomb but I never ever thought that I would be able to get a glimpse of what that looked like within my lifetime. This area is restricted to Popes and their immediate staff. This is the ultimate in terms of ""getting into"" one of the world's most hidden treasures! Ever wondered what it must be like to walk into the FEDERAL MINT just to see what goes on behind those doors? Ever wondered what it must be like to get into ANY RESTRICTED AREA just because you were curious but knew that it would not ever be possible? Well this DVD lets you into an area that you have often heard about, dreamed about, thought about and it turns out to be better than what you had in your mind's eye. One bucket list item done, 99 more to go.",1330473600,8,1865,4.197771587743732
4666836,3,B005ELVC9I,"The History Channel made good use of the ability afforded them by the Church to photograph the places and objects shown in this film.  My only objection to the film is that they wore out the word ""secret"" implying that the art objects have been nefariously concealed.  There are many secrets to those who don't bother to educate themselves.  There is nothing shown in this film that can't be seen in hundreds of coffee table picture books of the Vatican.  The History Channel is to history as the National Enquirer is to current events.  I still recommend the DVD for viewing.  I just find the lurid narration a bit corny and overdone.  Another DVD available on Amazon ""Lost Road of the Popes, Via Papale,"" costs a couple of bucks more but is far more informative on the subject of Church treasures of Rome.",1329782400,19,807,4.601398601398602

8468608,5,B005ELVC9I,"Interesting what we think we know about the Vatican ... this helps, but then no one really knows what is inside the Vatican Museum nor the actual Pope's places anyway.  I recommend this as a good starting point.",1521331200,,211,4.552631578947368
