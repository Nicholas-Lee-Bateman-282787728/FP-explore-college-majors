1798898,5,B0000714EM,"Knight is nothing but a bully and a lunatic. He's proof that you can do whatever the hell you want as long as you win and make $$$$$$$$$$$$$.

Typical America these days.

When he got fired from Indiana I had a parade down my street.",1164412800,,233,4.155555555555556
1798899,5,B0000714EM,"I thought this movie was really good in its objectivity. It neither portrays Bobby Knight as a hero nor a villain, but shows both his good qualities as well as his negative ones. It takes place during a season of the Hoosiers back in the 80s.

Now it does have scenes of Coach Knight lashing out at players. One scene at the start is very effective when he gets angry and loses his temper with Daryl Thomas, literally chewing him out in front of the team. There are other scenes in the movie when he yells at the team when they're not performing up to his expectations.

However, there are an equal number of scenes, which show his nice side. He often helps his players personally, to overcome their problems both on and off the court through guidance and advice. He raised funds to help support a former player of his (Landon Turner) after he got paralyzed. Coach Knight is also shown as a good and dedicated father to his son.

After watching ""A Season on the Brink"", one could conclude that Bobby Knight is not a bad guy, but a contraversial coach who really should learn how to harness his temper. It is possible to state your disagreement with someone without lashing out at them or putting them down.

The DVD has some good extra features such as an interview with Bobby Knight and a making-of documentary.",1110585600,4,1312,4.5
1798900,5,B0000714EM,"Brian Dennehy is amazing in this movie. he portrays the legendary coach, Bobby Knight, to perfection. This movie makes you question whether Knight was a tyrant who had very little on his mind except his own personal needs or was he the excellent coach of a true dynasty in Indiana. It takes you into the views of those around the community and shows the many sides that make up a college basketball coach. This movie is a must see for any basketball fan or any sports coach. It makes you realize alot about what may work with your teams or what not to do to try and make the team grow. I highly recommend it to those who are both Bobby Knight lovers and haters! This a an excellent version of the bestselling novel!",1041379200,,715,4.343283582089552
1798901,4,B0000714EM,"A Season on the Brink was ESPN's first orginal movie. Even though ESPN has never made a movie before this one, and though they don't air movie either. They made this movie. And like 9-11 Commertive Edition the MPAA gave this movie a rating. And this got a R rating for language. And the 9-11 movie got a PG rating. This movie was based on a book called ""A Season on the Brink a year with Bobby Knight and the Indiana Hoosiers"". I watched this movie on ESPN 2 tonight. A Season on the Brink takes place during the 1985-1986 basketball season. And that season Bobby Knight's basketball team opened its season against Norte Dame in December of 1985. Bobby Knight (Brian Dennehy) has come off a losing season and wants his team to win. They beat Norte Dame but then trouble happens one of the basketball has pictures taken for a caldendar. And when Bobby Knight sees the caldendar, it angers him a rule by the NCAA has been broken and the player (I think he was Steve Alford) got suspened for one game and that came is against Kanas in whcih Indiana loses the game. Bobby was Indiana for a long time before he was fired in 2000. ANd now he coaches basketball for Texas Tech. If you love to buy made for tv movies, this is one to get. But please remember this movie was rated R.",1038614400,3,1273,4.308333333333334

7973743,5,B0000714EM,"Brian Dennehy is outstanding in his role as Indiana Hoosiers coach Bobby Knight. Although he is very emotionally abusive and brash with his language towards his players, he only yells in order to get his players to win. This movie also shows the caring tender side of Bobby Knight to help get his team on the winning side after starting out with a crappy season",1399161600,,361,4.569230769230769

7973746,3,B0000714EM,"THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY is how one would describe Bobby Knight. Brian Dennehy gave us an excellent performance. Unfortunately ESPN ran out of money to hire actors after they got Dennehy, making this movie more akin to a one man play.

 They used actual footage of games as fillers. It was done poorly as you could tell when they were using stock film and when they were shooting the movie, especially during the second Michigan game when the film all of a sudden had a cheap digital look. This led me to believe this whole thing was filmed with a ""cheap"" $3,000 digital camera with special lenses to make it look like a major production and during the filming of the second Michigan game, they forgot the lens at the deli, and decided, ""what the heck, film it without it, no one will know the difference.""

I admit I am not a Bobby Knight fan. I believe in treating people with dignity and maturity, even ball players. In my opinion, the movie appeared to be fair to Bobby as a person, but as a coach, I thought it was more of a dis on his accomplishments.

This movie is for basketball fans only and not recommended as a date movie.",1277251200,,1141,4.342723004694836
7973747,5,B0000714EM,This is an excellent movie for the sports buff! Denehy captures the inspiration and volatility of this controversial coach. A must see for any basketball fan!,1261180800,,158,5.115384615384615
7973748,4,B0000714EM,"I saw the original airing on ESPN when I was in college...the ESPN2 censored version was just plain ridiculous.

It was entertaining, and for a minute I also got to see a side of Bobby Knight that didn't involve the 60+ FCC violations I tallied on a notepad throughout the movie.

I liked it, but I don't know enough about the Hoosiers' season in question to rate it any higher than four stars.  Overall, it wasn't bad.",1205107200,,419,4.415584415584416
