6414084,5,B00KBYIYYY,Wow what a adventure! The movie was very exciting.  Mickey and his best friend Sully are on a mission to stop pirates from taking over a submarine  and stealing the last part they needed to complete the weapon. This movie is action packed and will keep your attention . Kids will love it. So will adults.,1434672000,,304,4.410714285714286
6414085,5,B00KBYIYYY,"Excitement! Danger! The fate of the world is in the hands of two teens, can they succeed? Pirate's Code is a great action/spy film aimed at kids. None of the rude humor or other negative content in similar movies but lots of thrilling moments punctuated by bits of humor.

Pirate's Code is the second Mickey Matson adventure and picks up one year later. One of the things I really appreciated was that the main characters are all played by the same actors as the first film. Mickey starts out the movie longing for another adventure, and, boy, does he get more than he bargained for. Secrets come out and there are new villains to defeat.

Themes of family, friendship, working together, patriotism, and sacrifice are woven into a tale of derring-do that is sure to thrill young people. Hey, even parents can enjoy the adventure and the cool spy-type gear.

Great action movie entertainment for families. Got kids or grandkids? Movie night and nothing to watch? Why not pick Pirate's Code and for an evening of fun.

6414086,5,B00KBYIYYY,"About the DVD:

In this follow up to Mickey Matson and the Copperhead Treasure, Mickey Matson is at it again; this time pitted against the evil Admiral Ironsides and his gang of pirates who are intent on destroying civilization.  They're new invention, the Tesla Coil, is a weapon of mass destruction that will send an electromagnetic pulse throughout the world, destroying every electronic device in existence.  With the help of a secret organization, Mickey and his best friend Sully embark on a mission to stop the pirates from taking over a submarine and stealing the last part needed to complete their devastating weapon.  If Admiral Ironsides succeeds in his plan, civilization will be sent back to the Stone Age.  It's a race against time, and the fate of the world hangs in the balance.

My Review:

 My children absolutely love movies such as Pirate's Code. It is a great movie night movie for the whole family to sit and enjoy. Pirate's Code is an action packed adventure type movie. My 9 year old and 12 year old sat in on this movie first and then the whole family joined in. To me it was very reminiscent of the Spy Kids series. So I would recommend it to kids ages 8 and above.

 The cast members are getting better and better in movies such as these. Christopher Lloyd and Tia Carrere just to name a few. This is the second movie in the Mickey Matson series and as always the fight is on between good vs. evil. Our kiddos really enjoyed it and my husband and I loved the fact we could relax and enjoy the movie as a family without having to screen out bad language or not so good scenes. Highly recommended!

6414087,5,B00KBYIYYY,"The characters first introduced to us in Mickey Matson and The Copperhead Head Treasure are back again to help save the world from a device that would shut down all electronic devices. In Pirates Code, we meet new characters both those who fight for the Patriot team as well as those seeking to destroy devices needed in some cases to sustain life.
One of the themes taught is working as a team and not fighting solo or thinking it is easy to defeat an enemy. I was reminded of some movies recently out that show superheroes. In this adventure, we learn that character is of utmost importance. While some of the movie might seem silly, I believe it is done with purpose. The purpose being to make sure younger audiences aren't frightened and also sometimes we all just need to laugh, which brings comic relief.
Of all the action and adventure, kids of all ages will enjoy seeing the gadgets and understanding what true courage looks like in the movie. Like the fist Mickey Matson movie, Mickey is reminded again of what his grandfather taught him that doing the right thing is not always the easy thing. In fact, there are times when doing the right action can be hard such as standing up for a friend or not returning an unkind word when one is delivered to us.
I know when you visit the website you will see as I did that a third movie will be coming soon. These movies are a great addition to family libraries to be viewed repeatedly and enjoyed. Today we rely on technology for a lot of living, but nothing can match the brain God has given us. We don't have to stop thinking just because some device can think for us. In fact, as in the movie, we need to see that being able to analyze a problem and devise a solution independent of some gadget is a wise habit.
So grab both movies, pop some popcorn and enjoy good wholesome movies that entertain and teach at the same time! Have fun and invite some family or friends!",1434585600,,1923,4.404494382022472
6414088,5,B00KBYIYYY,"Pirates Code is the second movie in the film series, The Adventures of Mickey Matson. This movie features stars like Christopher Lloyd (famous for his role in playing Fester Addams in The Addams Family movies and Back to the Future), Kenton Duty (famous for starring in Disneys TV Show Shake it Up!), Frank Collision (played in Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman), Patrika Darbo (played Nancy Westley in Days of Our Lives), Derek Brandon, and Francesa Derosa. Pirate Code follows the voyage of Mickey Matson and his best friend Sully. They have been summoned again by the Secret Order of the Patriots to join the important mission of stopping the corrupted Admiral Ironsides and his pirates. Admiral Ironsides is inventing an electromagnetic pulse weapon that will wipe out of the worlds technology and cause the world to erupt in chaos.

I would recommend this awesome movie to anyone who enjoys action packed movies especially young teenagers. I haven't seen the first movie in the series but it can certainly be a standalone title. I was able to watch it and understand the film and enjoy it. I liked how the movie was clean of curse words and is very family friendly. There was only some fighting scenes but nothing was too graphic. Parents can sit back and let their children enjoy this film and not have to worry. I really liked how they have actors and actresses that the older generation will recognize while watching the film as well as some younger actors that our kids love. It had a great mix of cast members. I have always enjoying watching movies Christopher Lloyd has played in especially The Addams Family and I was excited to see he was starring in this one. I also liked the many different technology devices and I thought they did an excellent job at appearing to the younger teens. If you're looking for a new family friendly summer movie, then check out this one!",1434499200,,1875,4.73394495412844
6414089,5,B00KBYIYYY,"This is a great family movie and break from lots of violence and gore. Don't get me wrong there is some violence as in fighting but nothing vulgar or gory. This is a sequel, but we didn't feel lost not having seen the first movie. The movie features kids going on an adventure to save others and the world. My kids liked it that it was kids not much older than them that were main characters and that there were pirates! It is a movie full of adventure and action that kept us engaged throughout the movie.  My boys are 7 and 8 and really enjoyed this movie and my husband and I enjoyed it as adults. My kids have asked us to pick up the first movie Adventures of Mickey Matson & Copperhead Treasure.  It reminded me of the Spy Kids series.",1434326400,,740,4.1678321678321675
6414090,5,B00KBYIYYY,"This week, my sons and I viewed this clean family film.  It is full of fast paced adventure that will hold your attention throughout.  Many actors you will recognize from family TV shows and movies.  This DVD is also laced with humor that also holds the attention on adults.

 This is not a Christian film, but it is positive in its message and content.  I am so thankful for those actors who are willing to link to films as this, and produce material that is free from swearing, nudity, and inappropriate content.

 The action in this movie is intense at times, and would be appropriate for children 5th grade through adults.  If you are looking for a movie for your next family night, this is the movie for you!",1434153600,,713,4.465116279069767
6414091,5,B00KBYIYYY,"I watched the first Mickey Matson movie, Micky Matson and the Copperhead Treasure when it came out three years ago. Although it is more of a kid's movie, I liked it and was happy to see a second movie coming out.

 Just like the first movie, this one is completely family and kid-friendly. I thought the acting and the plot was better on this DVD, and it had a lot more special effects in it also. Derek Brandon, who plays Mickey Matson, has matured and gotten better with his acting, and he had a great performance on the movie, along with the rest of the cast.

  There is violence, but nothing too extreme: people fighting and getting hit with wrenches and other objects, and being shot with some kind of laser gun that just stuns and does not kill. There are no death scenes or anyone getting seriously injured in the movie.

  This is not a Christian movie, but it is 100% clean and free of bad language. There are good morals in the movie along with a patriotism that is missing in too many movies Hollywood produces. This is a movie to watch with your kids without fearing they will see or hear something you'd rather they not.

  I enjoyed the movie a lot. Maybe I am just immature, but it kept me on the edge of my seat and I found myself cheering the hero on, and I loved the ending. I highly recommend it. And although it is a sequel, I would say someone could watch it and not feel like they are in the dark about what is going on.",1433980800,8,1443,4.2299270072992705
6414092,4,B00KBYIYYY,"Thank you FlyBy for this review copy.
A couple of years ago, we enjoyed the first Mickey Matson movie, The Adventures of Mickey Matson and the Copperhead Treasure.  I received a review copy of Pirate's Code early this week, but I made the kids wait until Saturday night for a family movie night.  It's fun to have something to look forward to isn't it? For a change of pace, I'm going to share my children's thoughts about the movie along with their ages. Perhaps it will help you gauge whether it might be right for your family.

Amy, 13
""I thought it was a great movie. I recommend it. It was a lot better than the first, and I like the first one, too.  They had a few scenes that reminded me of a few a few movies I have watched like Percy Jackson. I recommend it and rate it 4 1/2 stars.""

Michael, 15
""Good for what it is. The acting and quality of the film was much better than the first one, but really it made no sense. All that should have happened is that they call the Navy SEALS and maybe National Guard. It also had about 1,000 cliches and did not seem to have any original content; but, still it was pretty good. I'd say three stars.
P.S. Green lasers are super corny!""

Emily, 17
""Good
-Easy for kids to watch
-Good cinematography and acting
-Creative
-Good music
-A clean comedy
Bad
-Stole most of concepts from other movies
-Music in one or two scenes was almost identical to scores in Pirates of the Caribbean
-It was like a modern day Pirates of the Caribbean rated G."" Dad

""It was a cute movie suitable for the whole family.""

Mom
It is good for the whole family. I think the target age is probably 8-14, but it would be good for any age. I listed the kids from youngest to oldest to show their different perspectives. Amy really liked it and got upset when she heard the older kids talking about it. It was a bit predictable. It did remind me of a situation in a Percy Jackson movie, but hey there's a certain formula that works.

It's a kid's action movie. A bad guy wants to take over the world. The adults can't handle the situation themselves. They call in the kids or, in some cases, the kids just get involved themselves. Either way, the kids save the day. That makes it predictable to older teens and parents, but the kids like it. So let's enjoy it! It's good clean fun. I'm all for that. There were a couple of times that I actually laughed loudly! By the way, I thought it had some great music.

I'll give it four and a half stars, too. It looses just a bit for lack of originality. It made a good movie night for us.",1433635200,,2553,4.223819301848049

6414096,3,B00KBYIYYY,I have to say that I did not know what to expect getting this movie as I am an adult. I do have to admit that anything Pirate related...I'm all over it. I was deceived by the title. Let me first say that as far as the actors go...there is only one who seemed to be trying at all and that is Derek Brandon as Mickey Matson. Every other actor should turn in his/her SAG card. Now to go back to why I went 3 stars when it is painfully obvious that I was not thrilled. This is a true KID movie. Everything is watered down and there is no real sense of danger or foreboding. Even the so-called bad guys....aren't.

It's difficult to find a movie that appeals to everyone in the family... this one should do the trick, including Mom and Dad.

This---like the first Mickey Matson movie--- is a buddy-movie with action and adventure. Mickey Matson and his best [girl] friend, Sully, are out
to save the world from Admiral Ironside's pirates. If Admiral Ironside succeeds, civilization will be sent back waaay before the Carter Administra-
tion. Can Mickey and Sully save the world before time runs out? You KNOW they will... Christopher Lloyd's in the flick!

THIS exciting sequel to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adventures-of-Mickey-Matson-Copperhead-Treasure/dp/B00CEAXE7U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adventures of Mickey Matson & Copperhead Treasure</a>, which I highly recommend, BOTH entertain without objectionable
content.  The best suited audience---speaking for myself (I'm a big [old] little kid)--- are ""children"" in the age-group 8-67.

The story-line theme stresses importance of team work. It depicts working together is important. Like I used to tell the folks in MY platoon:
""Lead; follow; or get the hell outta the way!"" (If you believe in yourself almost ANYTHING is possible; and, only ""Hang"" with people you TRUST!)

Mild [in the bloodless ROAD RUNNER cartoon style] violence throughout the movie. The pirates use ray guns to shoot with, and, also punch each
other.

If you have an action movie loving family, this movie is certainly family friendly and appropriate for even the younger ones.  My daughters found that it kept their interest and they did find it funny; although there was some eye rolling from the oldest at times.  Having said that the kids may enjoy it more than adults--as a parent, I am still a fan of any movie that we can watch together as a family--and would recommend this movie to others seeking a fun, family movie night idea.

Its difficult to find a movie that will appeal to everyone, including Mom and Dad.

Pirates Code: The Adventure of Mickey Matson is a movie filled  with adventure, action and friendship.  Mickey Matson and his best friend Sully are in a race against time to save the world from Admiral Ironside and his band of pirates.  If Admiral Ironside succeeds they are seen his plan, civilization will be sent back to the Stone Age.  Can Mickey and Sully save the world before time runs out?

Pirates Code: The Adventure of Mickey Matson is the exciting sequel to Mickey Matson and the Copperhead Treasure. It is rated  Family Friendly by Dove.org. I feel that it would be best suited for children in the 8-12 age range.  My children are 3 and 5 and I think much of the story went over their heads.  That being said, my son (the three year old) asked to watch the Pirate show again.

The show has a great message for kids.  It focuses on the importance of team work.  It shows how working together, despite our differences we can accomplish big things.  It also shows our children the importance of believing in yourself.  Mickey wavers at time in his belief in himself, but he soon discovers that if he trusts in his instincts he can succeed in any challenge before him.

There is some mild violence throughout the movie. The pirates use ray guns to shoot at the team and the characters are seen hitting and punching each other, but there is no blood or graphic language.  I felt quite comfortable allowing my kids to watch this film.
