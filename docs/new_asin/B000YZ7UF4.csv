3036731,2,B000YZ7UF4,"I'm a fan of Audioslave. This DVD delivers on most of the songs played live, especially Tom Morello's unique and tasty guitar licks. Chris Cornell's vocals were awesome as usual.

Hoewever, on two tracks, namely Be Yourself and Doesn't Remind Me, they did an amateurish job. Phil Commerford's back-up vocals on Doesn't Remind Me were horrible, and so was Chris' vocals as well. It was as if they were just jamming and trying to find their vocal key. I was cringing while listening to those two songs. The rest of the songs lived up to the expectations. Still a must buy",1232755200,2,569,4.633663366336633

8234494,5,B000YZ7UF4,"Eleven years before The Rolling Stones arrived in Cuba, Audioslave rocked the place with an amazing concert. Im so glad I finally bought this DVD (the sound quality is just fine imo), especially because it features a healthier and happier Chris Cornell during better times in his life. As much as I loved the concert, my favorite part of the dvd was definitely the documentary. As a Cuban/American girl, it was so nice to watch one of my favorite bands have fun and interact with the Cuban people. If you like Audioslave, or just love Chris Cornells music in general, then I definitely recommend adding this to your collection.",1523491200,,627,4.761467889908257

8234499,5,B000YZ7UF4,"Love it .  Audioslave is amazing, they're an awesome band full of great talent, phenomenal creativity, song writing, they don't do a bad song or performance, and I love how they show the band off stage too exploring the sights and showing their personality as individuals.  Of course, as a long time Chris Cornell fan, it was great to see him living life to the fullest, as he always seemed to do...  Miss him so.  Always will.",1512086400,,427,4.5064935064935066
