905274,4,6304579004,"This was a pretty reasonable movie story-wise for a Troma.  By reasonable I mean more dialogue than normal, and it made more sense than usual too.  Sense... well it just felt complete, and wasn't missing too much.

Now that that is done.  I really liked this one.  Not as good as Toxic I, but not too far behind.  Kaboooooooooki",1460246400,,328,4.47457627118644
905275,4,6304579004,"Not a big Troma fan, but I've seen several of their flicks over the years and this is the best. You have a hapless, but well-meaning cop thrust into an end-of-the-world battle. Aided by a beautiful Asian woman. (And, yes, you do get to see her boobs.) His blundering transformation from NYPD sergeant to Kabukiman is one long laugh fest.

I really like the heroine and the hero is competent, but not even they can save the movie. I like the episode where the hero, green as a kabuki man, turns into a clown, and is chased through the city squirting seltzer and whipped cream at the villains.

905334,4,6304579004,"I loved it.

The planets are coming into alignment and evil will soon walk the earth again, unless Kabukiman rises to stand against this ancient threat.  The chosen one has been training for twenty-five years, and just before he is to receive the spirit of Kabukiman, he is murdered.  In steps the NYPD's... well, not finest, but most typical.  The cocky police sargeant goes through some growing pains and struggles with his new gifts, and suffers a loss due to his inability to master his gifts.  Violence and hilarity ensues.

Utterly ridiculous and frivolous, which a budget that must have been at least six figures; quality special effects, plausibility, and post-production polish were left outside the door.

The script is remarkably sophisticated for a minimum budget effort.  Some of the campier aspects might not survive a better budget, but despite this there was a degree of character growth and nuance that would normally pass unnoticed in a flick like this.

I enjoyed this movie no end.  Well worth the effort.

905336,5,6304579004,"Being a Troma release, it's full screen, but it doesn't skimp out on extras.  It's apparently got two commentary tracks, one by Rick Gianasi himself (Kabukiman) and the other by director Lloyd Kaufman, along with a few featurettes, trailers, etc.

It used to cost a lot, but now it's gone down to a standard price of $5 it seems (AFTER I bought it for more than that *sigh*), but the movie is crunk, so it's definitely worth it.",1274400000,,428,4.4743589743589745
905337,5,6304579004,"If it wasn't for the horrible ending and some of the boring ""Bad Guy"" dialogue scenes, this would have been one of the best, if not the best movie ever made. Rick Gianasi's performance as Sgt. Harry Griswald and Sgt. Kabukiman are amazing... it's too bad he didn't go on to do that much afterward. The Kabukiman costume itself is so unique and original, that when added with the amazing character performance and hilarious super powers, it makes Sgt. Kabukiman one of the greatest superheroes ever created! I have to admit, there wasn't too many comedy elements in the movie that blew me away, but Gianasi's performance as a bumbling detective gave the entire film a cheesy 80's feel to it, that was funny enough.

The special effects were great! I love watching Harry's transformation into Sgt. Kabukiman, the visual effects are stunning. If this movie had been made in the early 80's, it would have been a special effects breakthrough... but considering it's a Troma movie... it's definitely a Troma breakthrough! Knowing the amount of restoration that was given to The Wizard of Oz, it's a shame Sgt. Kabukiman couldn't be given the same treatment. Although the picture quality is much better on the DVD than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sgt-Kabukiman-N-Y-P-D/dp/6304723172/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sgt. Kabukiman, N.Y.P.D.</a>when it's shown on G4, it still leaves a little more to be desired.

Although most of the movie's musical score is composed of variations of Madame Butterfly, the movie does have a very original 80's Rock Ballad, it's Sgt. Kabukiman's theme song, and it's amazing! (it's also available for free download on the troma website). At the end credits there's another song, by an Oriental band named ""Kabuki Rocks"", the song is called Onatsu Kyoran, and it's very good, so good I bought the album, Kabuki Rocks is like an Asian ""Kiss"" band, very awesome.

Lloyd Kaufman did a very great thing bringing Sgt. Kabukiman into this world. It's just a shame that the movie didn't have a larger budget (or didn't waste their budget on an admittedly cool car flip and explosion). It's my dream to see a remake of this movie, or a sequel. It definitely needs one. I'd love nothing more than to see Rick Gianasi reprise his role as well... I'd also like to know what happened to the guy, he seems to of just disappeared!

New York accents, sex, violence, an oriental superhero, the evil one, heat seeking chopsticks, 8-byte sushi, and as American as apple pie... Columbo with a dash of Jim Carry... all these things are Sgt. Kabukiman, an absolute must see movie!",1263081600,,2625,5.069444444444445
905338,5,6304579004,"who would have thought that a movie that completely makes fun of every asian stereotype would be so hysterical? one of troma's most memorable movies, sgt. kabukiman is a fun, action packed, superhero movie filled with tons of troma's famous campy attitude and gore!",1245196800,,265,5.045454545454546
905339,3,6304579004,I loved Sgt. Kabukiman in the Toxic Avenger. I was excited they had a movie about the guy and so I checked it out. All I can say is Sgt. Kabukiman is better off in the Toxic Avenger films or in the extra's on various Troma dvds. The film is not as good as other Troma films but worth watching. I think the one thing people love about it is the theme song.,1199836800,,355,3.8767123287671232
905340,4,6304579004,"have any of you people who rated this lower than 3 stars heard of the phrase. ""seen one, seen them all."" troma goes against that formula a lot.  troma is pretty good about making each of their films unique and not so much the same. well for sequels that is okay, but you people would be the ones saying ""toxie rip-off"" if this movie followed similar to that. sure, its no cheesy yet amazing gore fest such as toxie and terror firmer. it is a strange comedy movie and i like it for that. i have a feeling that the sequel will be a spectacular tromatic experience!

funny quote: (to the monkey) you better not have led us to a banana factory, or else your going to be dog food.

also, this dvd came out in 1997 and it is impressive that troma did dvds this good that early.  tons of special features folks!",1138233600,,804,4.201298701298701
905341,3,6304579004,"I gotta admit I had no idea who Sgt Kabukiman was untill I saw Toxic Avenger part 4. I'd seen him on extra features and stuff that Troma put on there DVD's, but I wasn't paying much attention to him. Once i'd seen Citizen Toxie, I rented Kabukiman to see what it was like.

Sgt. Kabukiman NYPD is no Toxic Avenger, he's a dopey cop who accidently inherets ancient powers passed down from generation to generation from oriental actors. He learns to use his powers and fu...alls in love with the girl training him. He ends up saving the day and becoming New Yorks billionth super hero.

Theres alot of the usual over the top antic by Troma, the signature moves they pull i mean.... but there very little gore in it, I was told it was gorey, it's not... either that or it WAS considered gorey 15 years ago way before the made TA4. I expected more action and voilence, but it never came.

Overall, it's nothing compared to the Toxie movies or Cannibal The musical, but it is worthy of at least a rent.",1120176000,,997,4.349462365591398
905342,5,6304579004,Troma is going to spoof themselves and make a more outrageous spoof on their own film.  It will be called Bukkakeman instead of Kabukiman.  It will be hilarious.,1093046400,,161,4.714285714285714
905422,1,6304579004,"Sgt Kabukiman is the movie that should have started a whole franchise and become a raging success... if only Lloyd kaufman didn't do it. As it happens, he was the guy that came up with the idea and made this very poor film.
I'm a big fan of Lloyd and Troma movies, and I had read Lloyd's book before seeing this film, so I got to read all about it before I saw it. In the book, he said Sgt kabukiman is the time when he couldn't decide which direction to go in. Whether to make it gory like The Toxic Avenger or make it a fun film suitable for the kids.
He did the worst thing possible, he went half and half. The film is so lackluster in violence that any gore fan will quickly become bored, but at the same time, because there are some dodgy scenes, young children cannot view this movie.
Apart from that fatal flaw, the film is just bad in every other aspect too. The best thing is the actor who plays Kabikiman, this guy deserves all the credit as he does a good performance, but everything else just makes the movie suffer. The sets are cheap, the costumes are cheap, the other actors are terrible, the story is incoherent & the continuity is even worse. Nothing seemes to make much sense.
Another major let-down is the ending. Not only is it extremely predicable and uninspired, but the special effects are of far too low a quality even for a troma movie.
All in all, give this one a miss, have a look at some of Troma's more recent films.",1041552000,5,1445,4.239130434782608

True that the quality of the video isn't great but it improves with the DVD version.  I would like it if the sound was 5:1 but I had so much fun with this movie that I didn't miss it too much.

905427,1,6304579004,"I picked this up because it was well recommended.  That was an evil joke!  Troma took a bizarre but interesting idea and transformed in into 4 hrs (feels like it) of tape which was more interesting when it was blank.  The same dumb, predictable, overused 'gags' that you've seen too many times elsewhere are poorly repeated.  There is an attempt at characterization but it never gets past 1.5 dimensions - not flat but damn close.  Special effects are minimalistic at best.  And to top it off the video starts with an introduction about how to make independent films that omits the most important part - how to find suckers to pay for this dreck.

905428,4,6304579004,"Isn't it ironic that the home video market almost killed Troma and now it is responsible for Troma's huge resurgence?  Lloyd Kaufman is not taking it for granted.  He is loading up these dvds with extras, not just trailers and triva, but this one comes with the rare animated Kabukiman cartoon!  It also has great commentary by the star Rick Gianisi, and if that's not enough may I remind you that the movie is a cult classic because it is a hilarious homage to camp classics like the Adam West Batman series.  It can't hurt that one of the female police officers wears a thin white tank top and painted on spandex jogging shorts either!!",973209600,10,638,4.521739130434782
