8352150,5,B00266PDYO,A comedy too far ahead of its time! A rundown hotel filled with wisecracking residents of all stripes.  This was so good it didn't last a full season ABC.  Starred Conchita Farrel and other great character actors.,1419552000,,213,4.72972972972973
8352151,5,B00266PDYO,"I still remember this funny, way ahead of its time, show.  Wish we could get a CD set of all the episodes.  ABC really dropped the ball when they cancelled this witty, intelligent comedy.  Please, someone check the archives for this show.",1404172800,,238,4.619047619047619
8352152,5,B00266PDYO,This show was awesome. I remember being very upset when it was taken off the air. People thought it was too racy. It was very funny and would be a shrinking violet compared to the crap on TV today.,1389225600,2,197,4.076923076923077
8352153,5,B00266PDYO,"Hot L Baltimore was way ahead of it's time.  With all of the politically correctness these days it probably could not get on TV in reruns.  Isn't this reason enough to have it on DVD?  This show was beyond funny.  The cast was brilliant and the crown jewel was
Conchata Ferrell playing a sharp tongued quick witted prostitute who we all know went on to be the maid on Two & a Half Men.  I truly would like to see this once more so hey, how about the DVD already?",1377216000,,462,4.088888888888889
8352154,5,B00266PDYO,"Hadn't thought of this sticom series for years.  Use to watch it back in the 70's, even then was delighted with the fine edge of comedy it portraid. Truly one of the classics from days gone past and when folks are finally able to watch the dvd series they'll appreciate what a jewel this old series was/is.",1361318400,3,306,4.368421052631579
8352155,5,B00266PDYO,"This was a great (short-lived) mature and very funny sit-com. I hope someone can make the season available as well as ""Best of the West"" from the same era.",1344470400,3,155,4.379310344827586
8352156,5,B00266PDYO,"Based on a wonderful off-Broadway play, this is one of the best (although short-lived)character studies in comedy ever done on TV.  Whoever creates a DVD of this series will be doing a service to all mankind!",1328313600,8,208,4.777777777777778
8352157,5,B00266PDYO,"I would love to get my hands on a DVD of this 70's TV show.  It was great!  I was a pre-teen when I watched this (I always had mature tastes), and though it was short lived I remember it as one of the most unusual and enjoyable comedies ever.  Talented cast, and interesting premise.  In addition to Conchata Ferrell, I remember Richard Masur, and of course ---James Cromwell.  Different than many other ""mega-lighting"" in-your-face-shows.  The setting and the mood drew you in.  Can't wait for this to become available.",1309564800,12,520,4.711111111111111
8352158,5,B00266PDYO,"The bossy Maid on a popular sit com with Charlie Sheen was the wise cracking Prostitute on ""Hot"" ""L"" Baltimore. Named because Hotel Baltimore ""e"" in it's sign was always out and because it was the funniest sitcom of the 70's and one of the few shows I remembered. It was Conchita, the actress playing the Wise cracking Lady in lingerie. One of the few good memories of the 70's, a cutting edge show about something no one touches today, prostitution... Rev. Mike Review",1290556800,20,469,4.595238095238095
