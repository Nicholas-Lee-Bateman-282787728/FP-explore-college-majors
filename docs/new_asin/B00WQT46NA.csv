8713947,4,B00WQT46NA,"If you are a huge AC/DC like myself you will enjoy this DVD.  This DVD is a bunch of compiled interviews from the past to the present.  I really enjoyed watching Brian Johnson in the interviews. His genuine down to earth personality really shows in these interviews.  Brian and Angus really had chemistry when they had done these interviews.  As I was watching the DVD, I really miss Brian's presence and personality.",1475884800,,417,4.75
