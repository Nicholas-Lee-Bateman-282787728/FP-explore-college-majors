6211076,5,B00HUCF420,"Everything about this show is excellent. The acting, dialogue and especially the smart, compelling editing choices keep you wanting more as we jump back and forth from 1995 to 2012 and watch the pieces fall into place and learn more about the characters. I've only seen three episodes (and episode three will be the one that hooks you for good) that I will anxiously await the final five. Great stuff for viewers who like character development and a slow burning way of revealing the story. A must see!",1391644800,4,502,4.715909090909091
6211077,5,B00HUCF420,"""Real"" and ""gritty"" seem to be an understatement for this new detective series by HBO, a unique re-telling of the serial killer plot line. It is about two detectives, played brilliantly by Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey,  being interviewed about  the twenty year old case of a sadistic and unique serial killer. That is all I will say of the plot, there have been plenty of revelations and surprises. Mconaughey is a dark and twisted loner with an almost prescient way of reading a crime scene. His acting skills are at the fore playing this man at two extremes, between now and then, he is almost unrecognizable, such is the metamorphosis. Harrelson plays the more conventional of the two, a solid family man, but we soon find out he is battling his own demons. There are plenty of great supporting characters but it is these two actors who make eerie retelling of murder in Southern Louisiana come to life. Everything is top notch in this production, making for a mult-layered true to life atmosphere. This is  a must-see for all crime drama enthusiasts.,",1391385600,20,1066,4.814207650273224
6211078,5,B00HUCF420,"INCREDIBLE.
With spectacular script and dialogs. Superb actors in state of grace (specially Mr McConaughey). Inteligent, with MANY AND VERY GOOD LITERATURE BEHIND (Borges, Houellebecq, Bukowski, etc, etc, etc).
Indispensable for everything that one that looks for something more than action in a tv show. Once again the best cinema is seen on the small screen.

6211079,5,B00HUCF420,"HBO attracts the very best writers and actors and this show meets those criteria. Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson are its stars and although both are known for being quite good on their own, they explode on the small screen when combined. They are detectives in Louisiana who are put on a serial killer case.  That case goes on for 17 years. The crimes are actually very artistic. Each victim is posed in a gruesome but artful way and is surrounded and garbed with artistic artifacts.

McConaughey plays the very smart but very weird detective whereas Harrelson plays the more run of the mill homicide detective. Physically the actors have let the makeup department do whatever they wanted with them to achieve the right looks as you have rarely seen either actor look like this.

The details in recreating this time period and milieu in Louisiana are painstakingly created.  It would not work without this attention to detail. We also shift time periods frequently and this is very well done also. Some might find this jarring at first but you quickly get used to it.

I, for one, am strapped into my chair for the remainder of the series and I would advise you to do the same.  This is a real winner of a series.

6211080,4,B00HUCF420,"Lots of kudos are written about this new series, and it deserves everyone. A dark, brooding drama that is told from two perspectives, and we don't know who is telling the real truth or if there is, indeed, a real truth.

Matthew McConaughey, who is riding a high with his Golden Globes award for best actor and Oscar nomination, plays a man like no other, and Woody Harrelson, an actor who has it made. Their combination is one of the best we have seen since, well, yes, 'Breaking Bad'. True Detective tells the story of two Louisiana State Police detectives: Rust Cohle, played by Matthew McConaughey and Martin Hart, played by Woody Harrelson, who are investigating the gruesome murder of a former prostitute.

The story moves between 1995 and 2012. Cohle and Hart find themselves being interviewed by new investigators who have a new murder very similar to the 1995 murder. These interviews reveal a great deal about both men. In-between the interviews we go with the detectives on their case in 1995. It is a creepy, awful murder, and we go with them through the bayous of Louisiana. We also meet Hart's family, and begin to learn the unsettling truth of his life, and the lies he tells. Cohle, is a thin man, ex-addict and now an alcoholic with a deeply disturbing background. Both of these men see their own truths, and, we are observing them to glean some hint of the world they inhabit. The ending wax superb, and totally fitting for the series.

This is a series that draws us in, once again. The difference in this series is that at the end of this year, it is the finish. Next year, a new story with new actors. How to flow Mc Conaughey and Harrelson, I have no idea.

Highly Recommended. prisrob 01-26-14",1390694400,,1716,4.598039215686274
6211081,5,B00HUCF420,"I heard some of the buzz around this show, not knowing anything other than that Woody Harrelson Matthew McConaughey had signed on to star and that is was some kind of cop show. Knowing that this was going to be on HBO I knew that it was probably going to be dark and edgy and that seems like a pretty spot on assessment after the first couple of episodes.

The premise is 2 cops, Martin and Rust, recounting a case that is almost 20 years old in a series of police interviews. The show is essentially narrated by the 2 actors characters as they talk about how the events unfolded in the case. You are left wondering why the police are interviewing them about it in present day. The acting by both is fantastic, they are really a great pair for a gritty detective drama. As the story progresses we learn more about the 2 detectives lies while clues lead the viewer how they ended up where they did in present day.

I was surprised to hear that these 2 relatively high profile actors signed on for a TV series, even if it was on HBO. Then I heard the series will be an anthology, essentially recast and have a new story every season. HBO has done some quality stuff in the past and hopefully future seasons will be as cast as well as this one. For now I am just going to enjoy the ride.",1390089600,21,1284,4.215447154471545
6211082,5,B00HUCF420,"True Detective Season 1 will be released on Blu-Ray and DVD June 10th.

I could go on and on about the amazing cinematography, the great pacing and editing, the set design and location shoots, or even the brilliant acting by Matthew McConaughey and his chemistry with Woody Harrelson. Instead, all I can say is that I've been waiting years for something like this. This is one part HBO's the Wire, one part David Fincher's Se7en, and one part 48 Hours Investigates. This show is very adult in nature, content and subject matter due to nudity and dead bodies and drug use.

McConaughey (Rust Cohle) and Harrleson (Martin Hart) play Louisiana detectives investigating the trail of dead left behind by a serial killer that ends up spanning 17 years. Any fan of great dramas like HBO's The Wire, AMC's Breaking Bad, and fans of slow burn shows with a very gritty and realistic portrayal of character interaction and events will love this. This is easily the best first episode of a show I think I have ever seen. And the show doesn't slow down after that, it snowballs. I didn't go into the final episode expecting all loose ends to be tied up, or for the good guys to win over the bad guys. All I expected was more intensity, edge of your seat suspense and the finale delivered. I'd be surprised to hear if people weren't satisfied with the ending of this season. The finale did a great job of bringing everything full circle, while managing to tie up most loose ends, and ending different than I expected, which is great. Even now, nearly 2 weeks after the finale I still find myself thinking about the case and about the events I witnessed unfold, that's rare.

This show is an anthology so each season will have a different cast and a different murder to be investigated. Nic Pizzolatto has written this entire 8 episode first season himself and Cary Joji Fukunaga has directed each of the 8 episodes for this season, which adds to the cohesive feel of the show. I can't recommend this show any higher. This is the kind of show one could watch a few times through and pick up on things they may have missed the first viewing. This is the must watch show of 2014. Although ""time is a flat circle"", this show is not a waste of your time. True Detective season 1 comes FULLY APPROVED.",1389830400,274,3230,4.9851576994434135

Although this series may have been billed as an adaption of Robert Chamber's classic weird novel, ""The King in Yellow,"" it isn't--some of the terms from ""The King in Yellow"" are loosely woven into the story. More of an adaption of a real case that occurred in rural Louisiana that did involve devil worship and child abuse. But the focus of the movie is not on the actual crimes, it is on the utterly fascinating characters portrayed by Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson and their investigation (and you will not recognize McConaughey as his ""present"" self compared to his ""past"" self).

This is Season 1 of the excellent, unsettling HBO crime drama True Detective where the deliberately-paced plot unfolds over eight 1-hour episodes. It stars the outstanding duo of Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey as the conflicted Detectives Rust and Cohle who are assigned an unusuall Louisiana murder case built upon a startling victim and gruesome crime scene at the beginning of the series. They are on a tight timeline and walking a tightrope where there are no easy answers. The show skillfully uses extensive scenes that flash back and flash forward showing different aspects of the case and their lives as younger and older versions of the detectives.

6211307,5,B00HUCF420,"Not often you run across a work like this acted out so well.  As far as two actors I enjoy greatly, MM and WH probably their most memorable acting jobs yet.  I think what strikes me most about this is the philosophical aspect of the characters, their lives, desires, weakness, strengths and how the world perceives them wrongly.  How sometimes you must embrace the darkness within to fight for what is good and right.  All of this is framed within the 20+ years of cult/ritual killing and the disintegration of their lives/egos.  All I can say is the play on good/bad, light/dark is completely profound.  Stability in things/people you look down upon, complete degradation in the highest moral places and the battle two very different men fight within themselves to hold back evil.  A tale of two very different people finding themselves and the meaning of life as they push back against evil.",1508716800,,893,4.7973856209150325

6211438,5,B00HUCF420,"""From the dusty mesa, her looming shadow grows
Hidden in the branches of the poison creosote
She twines her spines up slowly towards the boiling sun
And when I touched her skin, my fingers ran with blood
And rise with me forever across the silent sand
And the stars will be your eyes and the wind will be my hands""

- From ""Far From Any Road"" by The Handsome Family (which serves as the opening title sequence for True Detective, Season One)

The above opening lyrics serve as the preamble for the sinister tale that encompasses the narrative arc of the First Season of True Detective. In a cycle of eight nonlinear episodes set over a period of 12 years, True Detective Season One follows the professional and personal lives of two Louisiana state detectives (played masterfully by Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey) in their attempt to solve a gruesome ritualistic murder of a young woman whose mutilated corpse was discovered attached to a lone tree in a partially scorched sugarcane field. Their procedural work leads them to the trail of a serial murderer whose malevolence and wanton cruelty is often in plain sight yet paradoxically hidden from the hands of law enforcement. In my personal opinion, this series is a near perfect work of art: it is a macabre case study, infused with symbolism, tense character development, elegant script writing, and riveting suspense leading up to its final mythic conclusion.",1494633600,,1424,4.904564315352697

The main characters have so much depth to them they feel real.

The content might be a little disturbing at times, but i feel that adds to the authenticity of the show.

The whole thing is very re-watchable, even after you know who-done-it; this is a story with lots more going on than the crime being investigated.",1484611200,,528,4.813186813186813

6211927,4,B00HUCF420,"(haven't watched all the way through; so no spoilers here) This is a movie to see McConaughey and Harrison at their best. Great performances, great interaction between them. It is (so far) not really what I was expecting: a Silence of the Lambs or Seven kind of movie were the tension builds as the plot gets closer to the killer. This is more about the lives of the detectives. If you don't care much about the two lead actors, my guess is that you might not like this movie. For the rest of us, it is really good..",1484438400,,516,4.275510204081633

6212097,5,B00HUCF420,"Unbelievable! This really is as great as everyone says it is. What an amazing story. Gritty and hard, probably a little more than most detectives actual lives (way too many cigarettes and booze), but not so much that we can't appreciate the point. Sometimes knights in shining armor have to go through hell-fire to save the damsel. And yes, serial killers are sometimes as insane as this one was.

Despite the overwhelming male-ness of this story, there were points of true feminism. If you pay attention closely what you sometimes hear and see are lines and actions of true female empowerment. With the exception of the killer's victims, no women were victims in this show. They were strong and controlled their lives, even the ones you would not expect to. And at no time, no matter how raging mad these detectives got, they never lifted a hand to a woman in violence. But these men have codes, which of course, true warriors have, so you would expect no less. They are not, however, angels. Far from it.  But who said you had to be an angel to be a hero?

This is an INCREDIBLE season for this show and if you watch any of them, this should be it. Even the ending is profound! Loved it!",1483920000,,1189,4.49537037037037

Not only is it a ""page turner"" plot but the writing is sophisticated in all the right ways- the deep south language and culture is evident without being stupid.  McConaughey's character brought a pensive reflection on life's deeper themes, rather than to just be undone by the horror of evil men.  McConaughey and Harrelson are at their best in these roles.

IT'S A SHAME BECAUSE THEY HAVE SO MUCH TO OFFER!  but NOT WORTH CONSTANT, constant FREEZING THRU A WHOLE season of watching. Sadly giving up some good stuff to watch to avoid the aggravation.

Seeing it acted by McConnaughey and Harrelson is breathtaking. Period. The characters' mutual regard for one another's flaws and failings, while faith in one another withstands every test is truly a thing of beauty here. The plot, cast in a wretched, cynical, violent landscape where a crime is solved and all is creepy, engaging, edge of your seat stuff - but just background music really.

Distracting watching Mathew act like he is smoking on many cigarettes. No smoke is inhaled. These characters get themselves so beat up after the years it takes to catch the killer that I doubt they can make it through a second season.

The dark under tones played well with the plot, each moment keeping you at the edge of your seat, wanting/waiting to see what happens next. There is so much detail in every aspect of the show that pulling your eyes off to look at your cellphone or pet your dog is enough to make you miss out on something crucial to the next moment to come. This show demands, and dare I say, DESERVES your full and undivided attention at all times. This is one of, if not then, the best show(s) I've had the pleasure of experiencing.

6212442,5,B00HUCF420,"Beyond amazing. First, the writing is fantastic: crisp, hardbiting, realistic. Each of the main characters is drawn with nuance and clarity. Second, the acting is superb: I had no idea Woody Harrelson could act in a serious show, and he really found his part here. He deserved an Emmy. But MM is an absolute genius at acting. He is probably a little crazy (like the character), but what a mind! What a voice! And those gestures--he completely inhabited this character, and every gesture, every twitch, every nerve was attuned to it. Along with Gandolfini, Ian McShane (Deadwood) and Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad), I would put his performance in the top five all-time HBO performances. Even the villains were great: the dead girl's ex, the crazy hatchet-carrying, 666-scarred blond survivalist, and Errol, the biggest psychopath of them all, were played by excellent actors and seemed real, not buffoons. My only disappointment was with the women characters, particularly the lead, Maggie. She was nowhere near as nuanced as the two men, and the actress was only so-so. Still, the camera-work, acting, writing, and directing merit a five-star award.",1481760000,,1148,5.17741935483871

I think they're both great actors. I had no idea this show existed as I don't have cable. I signed up for 30 day free HBO trial through amazon prime and came across this. I love the spooky Louisiana setting and the twisted demonic villain(s). The sets were great as well, especially when they find the house in the end. It's so trashed, I could almost smell it.

The dialog is often witty, philosophical and interesting. The acting is excellent and the music wonderful. The director wanted to give the music director, T Bone Burnett major credit for his contribution to the show.

True Detective is one of the best, most intriguing, most well done series/films I've seen since Pulp Fiction. Everything about is top-notch: the acting, the script, the plot, the music, the cinematography, the completely accurate portrayal of backwater Louisiana (it's home for my father's side of the family) -- simply everything.
That said, this is not for those who prefer movies like Sleepless in Seattle or Legally Blonde. True Detective is dark and deep, troubled souls in a troubled world, trying to make sense of a sometimes senseless world. It's reminiscent of Cormac McCarthy's work and demands thought and attention. It's real when reality entertainment has reached a sad, sad state.
Bravo. I will watch it over and over again.",1472515200,4,889,4.973154362416107

I've traveled the antihero, blurry-line cop show circuit including The Wire and The Shield  but the magic of those shows' lead characters is that their charm or wit or talent bring them success. In this plodder, the only reason why this pair of stereotypes exists is because that's what the script says. After forty minutes, 10 minutes of exposition and half an hour of a Southern son making the same expression as I, listening to dumb nihilist ramblings I last heard in college or a hipster bar.

I won't repeat information already well-covered in other reviews. I would like to emphasize, though, that this show is very dark and has disturbing subject matter. It's tastefully done, I think, as to spare the viewer from the most graphic events that occur, by showing characters' reactions rather than blatantly putting the awful images right there on our screen. Still, the psychological impact is intense. Not for the faint of heart.

I will say that around Episode 5, I got a little overwhelmed with all the action (though VERY well done), and had I not already purchased the series (Amazon gives a nice deal on that), I may have stopped then. But it came back with full intensity after that.",1471910400,,810,5.044776119402985

Cohle's explaination of the human mind and it's ability to self delude comes pretty damn good.  As it comes pretty close to what I believe in RL, it truly stuck in my mind as one of the most coherent explainations of what's wrong with humanity and where they really went wrong.

While all the performances by the rest of the cast were very good, it's Matt Connaughey's turn as Ruston ""Rusty"" Cohle that really transforms the entire series - it's easily one of Matt's best ever performances although Woody Harrelson complements him for a great ying/yang.

The story dragged on much longer than it should have. It was not a plot-driven story so much as character-driven. So much so that I lost the thread of the plot, and by the time the mystery was resolved, I didn't really care anymore. The 2 main characters smoked, swore (constantly), and were involved in a complex love-hate relationship, which actually wasn't that interesting.

Matthew M's character was constantly going off on long strings of philosophy which I mostly found irritating and goofy, not enlightening.

6212732,5,B00HUCF420,"I love this first season of True Detective!  I have watched it through multiple times, made my friend watch it through, and finally had to purchase it for my very own, so I could watch it through whenever I wanted!
Every time I watch this show, I pick up on dialog that I missed in previous viewings.  In my opinion, that is the best part of this series.  Matthew McConaughey's dialog is so well written and his portrayal of his character is spot on believable.  There is such an interesting dynamic between the characters played by Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson.  The acting is amazing and the story is so captivating.  I bit my nails, laughed out loud, and hung on every word of every episode.
It is clear to see the time and effort put into this story by the writer.  Unfortunately, the momentum didn't carry over into the second season of True Detective, but that is fine with me.  This first season is such a fascinating story, such an interesting series, that it can be watched independently multiple times.
If for no other reason, you have to watch season of True Detective  simply for Matthew McConaughey's monologues.  His character has such a unique and realistic view on life and society and organized religion.  At first glance, it might seem harsh, but then you quickly realize that it is what makes him so amazing at what he does.  The balance between his character and Woody Harrelson's character is perfect.
There isn't a dull moment in this season.  It will pull you in and have you begging for more!",1466553600,5,1527,4.631970260223048

6212734,5,B00HUCF420,"Genuinely insightful gnostic philosophy muttered annoyingly from the passenger seat by an eternal outsider, while the bleak Southern landscape scrapes past outside the window. What a great sense of place, with an eerie emotional bottomlessness to it. This is hilariously (in my opinion) juxtaposed against Bayou Gothic ""hoodoo horror"" schlock. The real occult has chewed into the soft doll's body of tacky Hollywood ""occult"" and laid eggs in it, which hatch and spill out of monologues so deadpan you'll miss it if you're not paying attention. The narrator's terrifying perspective on reality's emptiness is the real horror here, with all the fruity murder/witchcraft scenes like a carnival ride he drifts across, the spectacle crass next to his dry and broken heart.

This sardonic, unreachable man seems isolated in such a way that you'd expect him to watch the human condition without participating in its games, but no. His talent for exposure of the rotten ultimately contaminates his partner's life, and its conventionality, denial, moral compartmentalization and convenient masculine double standards, in an act of betrayal that makes a mockery of the shell game the lesser man had been playing with himself. This is interesting, because of course the typical person is uneasy: can you trust a person who doesn't lie to themselves? You may know that guilty feeling of your bulls*** squirming away from the knives in their eyes. The perpetual pain and loneliness of seeing under everything, combined with a lack of conventional boundaries, gets you more justice than loyalty from a person who doesn't seek comfort in delusion.

The season culminates satisfyingly with a scene that finally unites the hokey with the sublime by seeming to rip a hole in the fabric of time, as if the layers upon layers of different kinds of deadness finally pull the veil off the void behind the stars. This is a show about the truth you really can't handle under the truth you think you can't handle, and something worse under that, and something worse under that: a world without either human love or God, so black that it finally inverts into agape.",1466467200,,2139,5.073863636363637

Matthew McConaughey's perforamce is even better (if you can believe it) than Dallas Buyers' Club. He lives the character, and you absolutely believe he is real.

The story is just pulls you in, tense, taut, absorbing and mesmerizing.  Harrelson and McConaughey play two very different detectives assigned to a horrific ritualistic homicide investigation, during the course of which they self destruct.  When in the investigation ends so does the partnership and the two men go their separate ways until years later they are brought in to review the case in light of a new homicide with the same MO.
The photography is stunning, right down to the opening credits.  Loved the score/music by T Bone Burnett.  Looking forward to more work by director Cary Joji Fukunaga and creator Nic Pizzzolatto.",1448668800,,776,4.930769230769231

I'm a fan of the actor, and choosing him for the role of Rust was one of the best casting decisions in history. And I like the character as such. Too bright to be a detective, and too good a man to be a detective in this world. Sad and beautiful, but true.

I can relate with his deep pessimism, another aspect that I enjoyed. I like how the philosophical pessimism combines with and is justified by the horror of the events. Rust's reasons for his pessimism and his explanations of it could have been better, but you shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth.

The script had some memorable moments in terms of portraying characters with actual insight and intelligence. Generally reasonably well done as well.

Since it's HBO, it has some silly soap opera scenes in it, but nothing particularly cringe-worthy, and it doesn't spoil the show. Maybe it even adds something to it. I don't know.

The soundtrack is adequate and rather pared down.

Mom didn't even try to play it for months, for fear (lol) of disrupting Pops' odd viewing habits. Doesn't matter. It was damaged before she got it.

6213356,5,B00HUCF420,"Pretty much what all those terrible shows like Criminal Minds should have been.

The acting is excellent, the characters actually have depth and aren't token caricatures. While they're also certainly flawed, not in the ridiculous way that most procedure dramas overdo it.

My only complain was I thought the resolution was somewhat anti-climatic for how well the show built it up. Not that I thought it was bad at all, but didn't do much to resolve the criminal conspiracies discussed though out.

A very ""smart"" drama, much of the focus is on the well built and acted characters. Not one of the silly action procedural dramas so common on TV. More implied violence/horror than cheap gore and intriguing and suspenseful. There are some great ""exciting"" scenes but it's built up much more believably and not focused on action.

Definitely not a ""family friendly"" show, but that should be expected, there are plenty of egregious sex scenes. The violence of the crime that is the focus is well done, it's not overdone for cheap thrills like seems to be the trend for shows these days. The main characters aren't unrealistic bad asses. In general a much more cerebral show than most crime dramas which helps make it seem far less ridiculous than most crime shows.

It's much closer to Hannibal than Law and Order or Criminal Minds. The personal lives of Woody Harrelson and Matthew Mcconaughey characters are well explored in the interaction with the case and job and a prime focus of the show which largely depicts actual investigative work. I appreciated the lack of cheap, super-genius analysts that have become the hallmark of lazy network writers.

I can't say much without giving anything away. It's not as much of a mystery show but does a good job of keeping the viewer intrigued and building suspense. Season one was absolutely great, the subtle and intelligently played references were especially welcomed in the show (Kierkegaard/Schopenhauer. I was almost a philosophy major) but not so overt or excessive as to confuse or annoy my friends.",1443744000,5,2048,4.956268221574344

6213361,5,B00HUCF420,"The show grabs you right from the beginning and refuses to let you go.  I'm a fan of both Matthew McConaughey & Woody Harrelson but struggled throughout the series as both play deeply flawed & troubled characters.  I found myself conflicted because it's difficult to feel an affinity and bond with either of their characters.  Following this theme of conflict, the show graphically deals with a crime case that is simultaneously disturbing and compelling.  By the time each episode ends you find yourself wanting for more.  The final climactic episode is is fitting of the buildup from the previous seven.  Highly recommended but absolutely adult themed content.",1443398400,,662,5.140186915887851

While I'm extremely pissed about its ending and you will be too I have to say its (was) the best thing out there in a WRITTING/CASTTING marriage! The very best CAST in the history of TV Casting and having said that still no actor could have made it so without that special ""thing"" this one writer does with them and together it = Brilliance!

Funny thing is I haven't even seen Season 1 (which I will now be buying after this review). I not only adore both Harrelson/McConaughey but have an idea of how brilliant they will be; with their own individual acting abilities I've seen over the years and coupled with this writers style I doubt Ill be disappointed. I don't know who they will get for Season 3 but just the writing alone will propel that cast 10 fold. I can't wait to be pissed again as you come to wish good things for the bad guy(s); for a clean tidy wrap up where everyone lives happily ever after that will never be forthcoming........which is the true beauty of the show; the dark visceral beauty of it all.

Not on Par with Breaking Bad or Twin Peaks , far from it. I bought it because i am a fan of Robert Chambers ""The King in Yellow "" but other than a few, vanishingly few remarks, said King is not around much.

6213680,5,B00HUCF420,"This is my first attempt at a  review and I am by no means an expert, but this show is riveting. Unlike traditional cop/detective shows, this series does not give you a quickie. This show is meant for a mature audience, and when I say mature, I mean an audience with some patience, not after the low-hanging fruit and instant gratification. There is a case, just not one that is easily solved, more like unraveled. Like the story itself, the show follows no pattern or sequence, just sort of unwinds from disfigurement and chaos. The acting is the best I have seen from both Woody Harrelson and Mathew Mccaughnehey. The cinematography is pure genius. The directors go out of their way to give you an on location experience that evinces the realistic scenes and imagery we have come to expect from HBO pictures. Much like the characters and plot, Southern Louisiana is a vast, untamed and sometimes ruthless setting, a perfect backdrop for the sleazy and diabolical nature of the twisted characters and their dark stories.

I have never really cared enough that a show continue to exist until now. Everything about this show is clever and brilliant, the plot, characters, cinematography and soundtrack all blend together in  perfection. I hope HBO keeps this show going. Move over Sopranos and GOT.",1438560000,2,1297,4.85972850678733

6213749,5,B00HUCF420,"We just finished watching year one of this amazing show on Netflix DVDs and I'm about to order the boxed set, less to see it again, more to watch the extras.

We've watched many serialized TV shows although not as many as most: The Killing, The Bridge, Borgen, Newsroom, House of Cards (both UK and US), State of Play (UK TV series), and many more. For those of you who might shy away from subtitles, The Bridge (Danish) is a good place to start if you enjoy crime dramas with amazing characters.

True Detective season one is in a class by itself: great story, some of the best acting we've ever seen, great directing, great production and much more. This series is in a class by itself.

I could watch Rust sitting at the table smoking, drinking beer and making little metal men for hours, McConaughey has that character so wired it's like the voodoo undercurrent of the series.

Watching Harrelson's face in the car when Rust is going off on an existential rant is incredible. Both of these actors have their characters and the space between them so wired, and do so much with so little it's simply incredible acting (and directing).

This series is a true work of art. If you haven't seen it, this DVD set is a great way to do it. If you have, I think it'll be well worth it to get the extras on the DVD set and after a while, see the entire series again.",1437696000,2,1359,4.355731225296442

6213755,4,B00HUCF420,"I liked the series....gothic, morose, semi-occult, moody etc. Two very disparate detectives try to solve the case of the serial killer. One is grounded in real life and the other in an existential mental state of mostly nonsense. They get along and eventually do not. A little to much sexual goings on and a couple of hanging threads and characters. The bar owner at near the end who shoots up the retired police man's car....This could have used some fleshing out. His appearances were measured in nano seconds and he then disappeared for good. After seventeen years or so the case is then speedily wrapped up...a little to fast and smooth but the acting, the photography, the southern feel and sound track were excellent.",1437609600,,723,4.838709677419355

From the opening pages, or scenes, we are drawn into a world as complexed as the one we suffer through, inhabited by similar horrors and, we eventually discover, similar monsters. Woody Harrelson delivers an expected solid performance, but it is Mathew McConaughey who reminds readers, or viewers, what many of us have forgotten: he is a phenomenal actor.",1436832000,,584,4.909090909090909

And I had things to do the next day but I was THAT into it. Quite impressed, intrigued and as bring more. I highly recommend watching this season of true detective. Watch the first 2 episodes then I promise you will be hooked. No lie when I say I'm picky. And I must say I have good taste.

The acting and writing is completely on another level to anything you might have seen in this genre before. Stunning, moody, atmospheric and wonderful music. The isolation and not being City centred added a special kind of intriguing magic, which I loved.

Amazingly, I did guess who the killer was; early on, only because of a true life case, with a similar MO, which happened in my area, around ten years ago.

The voodoo; pagan content, was an inspiring extra, which added to the chill factor.  And I have to point out; that; I was not disappointed that; I guessed who it was,  because there was so much else going on not to feel, in the least bit cheated. Just watching two sublime actors, at the top of their game, was enough to please, right up to the exciting end.

6214045,5,B00HUCF420,"On a fixed income and not liking Woody Harrelson, I bought this on DVD instead of BluRay.  My bad.  Maybe BluRay is better.  Look, unless you have hawk eyes, don't faff with the quality of one play over another, just WATCH THE DADGUMMED EPISODES.  Back up if you're distracted and miss something.  I watched it through twice.  THEN I thought about it.

I admit I'm stunned at what good storytelling this is, what utterly original, down to the last little tic in one's hand or facial muscle, these two lead characters are.  I expect this good from McConaughey, and will watch for and expect as good from Harrelson in future.  This may have been the best thing made to air in 2014.  I missed it when it aired, but I'm GLAD I bought, not rented, the DVD, and I'll watch it again and again, down the road.

Each ""season"" of this series is a new crime, a new teaming of detectves.  I'm watching Season 2 as it unfolds.  It too is UTTERLY original.  Don't sneer at Colin Farrel until you've seen his law man here.

I surely -- REALLY surely -- loved Season 1 and recommend it unreservedly.  That includes both the violence and the language that tend to make me twitch, though others seem not to be affected.  Look.  Just view it.  I suspect you'll like it enough to collect it.  This is not my genre, exactly, but it is SO good!",1435881600,2,1322,4.362139917695473

I also enjoyed the solid choice of music to enhance to mood and storytelling. However, what I am struggling to understand is the incredible positive buzz around this program. There are as many problems as there are positives. Highly stereotyped. Over-the-top attempt at social commentary. Predictable. And an ending that was all too concise and tidy.

The story trails a savage, ritualistic murder case spanning a timeframe of almost 20 years.
Standing front and center are two homicide detectives who will inevitably learn a thing or two about themselves before a full stop, pertaining to the case, as well as their own characters, can be achieved.
Woody Harrelson and Matthew Mcconaughey are absolutely radiant as the two detectives and the show works magic as an unadulterated love letter to the seedy underbelly that is the tradition of southern gothic.

6214165,5,B00HUCF420,"My god this show WAS TOO EPIC! I've been a fan of HBO series for quite some time. The production all the way around is nothing short of amazing. I recommend this show not only because of the star studded cast, but also for the script writing that was put really well together all the way around. Not many films/shows get the most out of their superstar actors. This show does that with every actor involved. Let me start by saying Matthew McConaughey gives maybe his best performance yet as detective Rust Cohle. Woody Harrelson does the same with his character detective Marty Hart. They both have tremendous chemistry, which in my opinion is the what made this show an instant classic. Rust Cohle plays an extremely intellectual douchebag who is far smarter than his peers. A smartass who is dedicated to his profession and is very blunt about everything i.e Dr. Gregory House. While Marty Hart plays the ""normal"" average joe detective, who also shows the emotional side of being a husband and father. While being an enforcer of the law. It has multiple scene in which it will leave you stunned. Gives you the complete experience of tracking down a serial killer and what it takes to catch one. A badass series all the way around.

6214170,1,B00HUCF420,"Some spoilers...

True Detective is a painfully dark, depressing, brutal and ugly story about very horrible and sick people doing evil things.

The two detectives, played by Harrelson and McConaughey, are bad people themselves who, in the course of the show, commit adultery, murder, kidnapping, beatings, thievery (B&Es) and perjury.  They freely break the law in supposed pursuit of the law, as well as bungle up their own case on more than one occasion, which makes them Horrible Detectives, probably a more apt title for the show.

The story wallows in the worst depravity of human behaviorrape, murder, child rape, child murder, child torture, satanic rituals, etc.  The two detectives pursuing these child and woman rapists and killers.  Unfortunately, their investigation is told in a very slow, drawn out, murky and convoluted manner with tons of distracting flashbacksmost of the show told in this annoying flashback style.

And even more unfortunate, the few culprits the detectives do apprehend (I mean kill), turn out to be nothing more than inbred hillbilly typesstock characters from crappy movies like the Wrong Turn series.

In fact, most of True Detective is derivative of other movies such as Se7en, Zodiac, The Usual Suspects, Silence of the Lambs, as well as lesser movies like Kiss the Girls and Along Came a Spider, and cheesy slasher/horror movies like Wrong Turn.

Overall, the first season is a 8 hour journey through misery, depression and darkness;  much of the story wallowing in the detectives own sad and bitter personal lives, an unwelcome and entirely unnecessary diversion from their investigation.  By the end of the show, you're hoping for some payoff, but all we got was a major let down of an ending, and I couldn't help but think:  Thats it?  That sucked.

I would never watch a second of this show again.

And truly great HBO shows I often watch time and time again, like The Sopranos, Rome and Game of Thrones.

HBO really hit skid row and wallowed in the gutter with True Detective.  This show is one of HBOs worst.",1434758400,7,2056,4.947521865889213

That being said, I was very disappointed with this series, especially since everyone I knew had spoken so highly of it.  My critiques are pretty consistent with others here.  The sex scenes were gratuitous and tiresome, the sound quality was really bad (it was so hard to understand what they were saying, and just when I would suspect it was something wrong with my television, a sound effect would come through crystal clear), and the plot just rambled.  I thought there would be greater meaning to Rust's philosophical monologues, but they just ended up falling flat.  There were SO many side plots that added nothing substantial to the overall story.  Actually, I think this story would have made a phenomenal play, but it was as if the writer had an 8-hour-long contract with HBO and then decided it had to be filled with SOMETHING to pass the time.  In contrast, the ending wraps up abruptly, with several curious details about the cult never explored or explained - the characters don't even care, it seems.  I just couldn't find this compelling: it was all over the place, too sensational in unnecessary spots, and too much ""Undergraduate Philosophy 101.""",1433721600,2,1416,4.915966386554622

The story is filled with undercurrents of menace that keep you on edge.  There is a sense of evil lurking in every corner.  The atmosphere is filled with toxic exhalations of danger.  There is a 'heart of darkness' feeling as they penetrate the swamp in search of the answer to unspeakable crimes against the innocent. In fact, 'searching' is the overwhelming theme.  Sometimes it results in moments of spectacular enlightenment. Sometimes dead ends result in heartbreaking disappointment.  But always there is the searching for an evil that must be dealt with and destroyed. Sometimes the searchers themselves become the prey on the brink of extinction. No one is safe. Nothing is sacrosanct.  This is a masterpiece permeated with an almost metaphysical sense of menace.

6214293,5,B00HUCF420,"Not too often do you come across a tv show that is compelling and has strong acting. In my review of True Detective, we will take a look into the highly acclaimed series.

In the first episode, Detectives Marty Hart and Rustin Cohle are on a case that involves a woman by the name of Dora Lange who has been mysteriously murdered. Upon further investigation, they notice her body is tied to a tree in a kneeling position with deer antlers on her head. Years later, Marty and Rust are both being questioned due to the recent killing of similar circumstances and because Detective Gilbough and Detective Papania still believe the real killer is still around.

By now, you may be wondering: ""Why is this show getting so much praise?"" Well it starts first with the actors/actresses. Matthew McConaughey is simply terrific in his role as Rustin Cohle. He is an elite thinker with a sort of worldly view on just about everything; but he is also a skilled detective. You want a straight answer from Rust Cohle well.....you better ask the right question. Woody Harrelson stars as Marty Hart and does a fantastic job. Rust and Marty may not be exactly alike(especially in terms of personality) but when they do put their heads together, the duo is unstoppable. Michelle Monaghan plays Marty's wife Maggie, while Michael Potts and Tory Kittles star as Detectives Gilbough and Papania respectively. Great Job by the cast.

I definitely enjoyed the story of the show. True Detective transitions between different years throughout the entirety of its 8 episode arc, but that only makes the show that much better. I even found myself paying close attention to clues or what a certain character said in certain epsiodes; to get a better understanding of the mystery that needs solving. Even when I thought I knew what would happen next, True Detective surprised me even further by keeping the suspense high and having a slow buildup as opposed to revealing everything at once. There are funny moments, but there were a few times too where I found myself tearing up which I credit the writers wholeheartedly. True Detective rewards viewers with the stellar acting, the wrting of Nic Pizzolatto, the film locations, and because True Detective achieves so much in its 8 episode run.

True Detective is not just one of the best shows HBO has put out, it IS one of the best series debuts I have seen. My only hope is that season 2 is just as great or even better than the first.

The gloomy backdrops and the lack of colors.
I think Harrelson and McConaughey are great actors, but I never would've thought to put them in the same show, in a crime drama no less.
Which is why I believe this series works so well.
The story is written so well, that I almost wish it would've lasted longer.
But it ends when it needs to and at times does seem to drag on in some scenes.
I'm a fan of the visual style of the show so I didn't mind at all.
The show starts off as if it will involve supernatural elements, and for the most part during the first half of the season, keeps you guessing.
I recommend this show to anyone who is a fan of cop dramas.
It's certainly a fresh take on a genre that needed it.
I'm almost upset they're making a second season but I won't write it off until I've seen it.

In fact, the bad guy and his environment weren't compelling or particularly interesting, and was only used to fill up time and resolve the plot, sort of, at the end. He didn't come across as monstrously depraved, as he should have. He came across as merely inbred and seedy. It would have been more interesting and intriguing to unpeel the bible school network and get under the oily skin of the proprietor family and their allusionary attraction to the 'dark side"" (That's right  allusion not illusion). I appreciated Woody Harrelson's character's home life. Their realized dynamics came across as too painfully and uncomfortably real and were well written. Matthew McConaghey's character was not entirely believable, even within the Usual Suspects narrative setup. Rather than being swept away with plot developments and transcendent character development, the presentation devolved into annoying ""look at me, I'm working hard at acting"".",1431907200,5,1083,5.296511627906977

6214408,5,B00HUCF420,"I probably can't add much more to what's already been written here, but from the first twang of the theme music to the last word spokenin each episode, this left me wanting more.

Often gruesome, always realistic, this series not only delves into the psychology of the killer in the case (and also whether the detectives got the wrong man) but it slowly peels away the layers of the two investigators personalities, revealing that neither is as their exteriors show them.  Both McConaughey and Harrelson are perfect as the loner-atheist iconoclast thrust into a partnership with the seemingly happily married man who believes in everything he should. After ten years, the discovery of another body killed in a style exactly like that of the murderer they apprehended brings them back together to be interrogated about the particulars of the original case. Contrasting their present positions in life and beliefs with their former ones, it's a chronicle of flawed characters searching for an even more broken one. (I really felt McConaughey's character, being the man full of esoteric knowledge,  should've reconized the symbolism of the antlers, however, but that might've ruins it as far as the length of the series.)

6214446,4,B00HUCF420,"No real plot spoilers, more just talking about the style of the show.

It is now quite a while since I first viewed Season 1 (S1) of True Detective. Perhaps I have regained enough of my composure to put something in writing, as this series, despite being mocked mercilessly by comics (on SNL?), is superbly wrought, and incredibly disturbing, with the visual imagery, writing, and acting one expects from HBO by two magnificent actors at the peak of their game, the entire production in fact is simply extraordinary in terms of the remarkable skill on display.

The competition between cable TV companies to pull something new out of the hat, to push to envelope, has perhaps never been stronger, the quality of productions never higher, and with True Detective, HBO has pulled off a masterpiece.

Firstly a note concerning what some have criticized  the level of female nudity; basically, female nudity, who drop their togs apparently at the drop of a hat for the lead actors, and are then mercilessly tossed aside.
Any male viewer who says they are not titillated (no pun intended) by the on-screen antics of voluptuous young women, well  I can only say, speaking for heterosexual men, that it would be very difficult not to find something appealing in that. Is this a grubby plot device used by the creators of the show to reel in the paying public (at least a certain percentage thereof)?

There is, to say the least, a viable argument that an imbalance applies, as only female genitalia is shown, whereas the male parts are never seen (thankfully, in my opinion anyway).

Are the shows creators trying to say something about the trajectory of certain womens lives over the course of the show? E.g. we have promiscuous but successful young law clerks, women living on the fringes in a camp of trailers as working girls, then we have women who fall victim to predators, including serial killers.

On the other hand, we have relatively two-dimensional characters played nevertheless with great aplomb by actors such as Michele Monaghan, who is always spellbinding and fierce in her interpretation of her roles.

Perhaps, with the exception of Rectify (highly recommended), I do not think I have ever viewed another show that comes to mind that captures at least the mythology concerning The South, albeit with rectify having its feet planted much more firmly on planet earth.

The question of whether we are dealing in stereotypes as opposed to realities (as someone who has always lived in a huge suburban metropolis on the other side of the World) is obviously open to question.

It is worth remembering that S1 is dealt with as a series of flashbacks. This choice of plot works incredibly well, as we are hanging on the characters retelling their version of events as and when they want to, in their own time. Both Woodys and Mathews characters are stubborn, determined, damaged men who are haunted by what they face, and reticent about revisiting what went down.

The characters of the lead males are expertly wrought. On the one hand, we have Woody as the apparently more grounded, inthis-world pragmatist; on the other hand, we have Mathews troubled character, battling mental illness, self-medicating with alcohol, not taking his meds often, but feeling that he functions better, or can exist in the world he needs to in order to chase the evils around him  that is a complexly-presented tension that causes him great suffering.

The above theme of a tortured soul is similar to the character of Wil Graham, whether in the film Red Dragon, the Michael Mann masterpiece Manhunter (with Brian Cox an easily more terrifying Hannibal Lecter), and the equally-remarkable portrayal by Hugh Dancy in the series Hannibal.

My take is that  with McConaugheys portrayal in True Detective, we have a brilliant detective who is more of an enigma than the other abovementioned characters, yet Mathews onscreen presence carries the show (I would argue) more than Woodys), although both characters are enthralling in the demonstration of how they worked together, their integrity, trust, as well as the curious dynamic that plays out between two tough men thrown together in circumstances they would rather not have to deal with, and yet knowing what the job is, they head into the darkness to deal with their fears, extricate those who can be saved, and operate with a real world experience that when dealing with something approaching pure evil, they have to have each others backs, nothing pans out nicely, so that the sequence of events as they went down has to be choreographed, if you like, to protect each other.

As a passing observation, some of the visual imagery, while highly disturbing, and completely successful, does seem to borrow from some of the more celebrated Asian cinema of the last decade or so, such as Beat Takashis Gozu (Cow Head). I won't explain exactly where that apparent reference appears in True Detective, but suffice to say it is highly disturbing.

I could go on about True Detective for quite a while longer. Suffice to say, apart from anything else, this is definitely a male-oriented buddy series albeit within nightmarish and grim scenarios, but definitely not for children or those with a faint heart.

From my perspective, I found the descent into a mystical almost transcendental experience in the final battle, like something out of Ulysses, highly effective, magnificently wrought, and yet leaving me not entirely sure what (if anything) was intended by way of a message.

Are we being presented with the version of the flashbacks that the male detectives want to present, are they reworking highly disturbing experiences into something almost mythological in parts, to allow their minds to process what they have never really come to grips with perhaps, and which continues to haunt them mercilessly?

If we think of the great Tommy Lee Jones as the Sheriff in No Country for Old Men, especially his opening words in the film where he says (roughly paraphrased):I don't want to go up against something I don't understand, and later in the film, he says I feel overmatched  well, True Detective takes that idea and opens up a whole other disturbing yet enthralling dimension to that phenomena.

I guess I am a bit uneasy about why this story (True Detective) necessarily had to take place in The South, but the choice of locations, with all the stream of characters that we encounter engenders, certainly adds greatly to the gravity and threatening feeling that is expertly achieved. By way of comparison, the Hannibal Lecter of Anthony Hopkins, mesmerizing as he was, caught inside Dr Chilterns high-security institution, was terrifying enough. Well, in True Detective, Woody and Mathews characters are chasing similarly grotesque figures who are as yet unknown, are at large, who operate in plain sight, and some of which are previously unknown to the police.

Again, taking another stag at concerns expressed by critics (some anyway) about the very deep focus on male protagonists in this show, remember it is harkening back to another time, where male detectives I suppose were more or less the norm, society was more a mans world, so to speak, than it is now, and so the two male leads (Harrelson and McConaughey) are the stars of the show and the centre of attraction in their on-screen lives.

Yes, to a great extent, we have only men presented as protagonists, on the side of either good or evil, and women in usually subservient roles (as far as I can remember), serving as casual sexual partners, fallen women, all the way to as I said the victims of serial killers. One might justifiably, as critics have, label the show as unbalanced, restricting the roles of women to wife, unattached young and manipulative, to bait for psychopaths.

I also think it instructive that in a key sequence, I think Harrelsons character helps one of the young working girls to escape the secluded and exploitative place she found herself caught in, the woman gets a job and seems to be back on the straight and narrow. If that was supposed to serve as some moral story for the benefit of those watching the show, then it was clunky, patronising and incredible simplistic as a solution. But, this is fantasy, so whoever said we had to inject too much of the reality of such womens lives into the heady mix?

In retrospect, nevertheless, there is something highly hypocritical about the way this is thematically explored. Anyone who has read on the subject of human trafficking and prostitution, women (and men) and children of both genders who find themselves in a horrible place usually if not always have been subjected to years of systematic abuse by usually a male figure. It is a complex and heartbreaking sequence or life-story for these innocents caught up in a brutal exploitative (criminal) enterprise, so there is a part of me that feels the show could have been much more realistic about what usually happens. I am not trying to paint every victim as completely powerless, but nevertheless the odds are stacked against them.

Perhaps as a non-United States of America viewer, I find such sometimes overwrought religious resolutions, appeals to supernatural influences (particularly the messy intertwining between that and what I would call troubling delusions, and genuine mental illness), well, if the creators of True Detective had pushed those themes much further, I think the result would have been faintly ridiculous (leaving aside the fact the show has already attracted perhaps more than its fair share of parodies).

It is open to question to what degree the superb acting, the great script, the outstanding production values, the gobsmackingly awesome cinematography and musical accompaniment (up there with the very best of anything HBO has ever done) enables the show to pull off some themes that, in the hands of a less able cast and crew, would perhaps never have gone to air, and even if it had been aired would have been the laughing stock of the industry.

All of which is to say, unlike the stable of other HBO productions I have watched, I did wonder whether the well-established kookiness of what Hollywood gets up to was perhaps too strongly injected into this particular show. Who knows?

Having said that, there is no getting away from the central theme of the show, which is never used for gratuitous entertainment, being the terrible violence against women and children, in particular. That can never be a no go area just in terms of exploring the depths of depravity humans sink to, as well as the people who courageously put themselves forward, going up against them in what transpires in this show as a titanic struggle - of the definitely-conflicted versus something wicked that is both not quite explainable yet must be challenged, even though the battle is never-ending.

The impression left, as to flagrant gender-stereotyping, (yes, back to that again) perhaps is irrelevant, because this is Hollywood, fiction, fantasy, entertainment.

Cable TV and entertainment is perhaps as close as we are ever going to get in terms of giving subscribers exactly what they want, which is to confront an idea, entertain us, while not preaching or lecturing. Leave that to the Media and Gender Studies programs.

While I do not necessarily think the creators can get away with the possible retort along the lines of well, the gender stereotyping got the detractors talking, so that is a good thing etc., it is a little unfair for those pushing an ideologically-pure barrow to be seeking a 50/50 split in terms of male and female leads and so forth. However, it is certainly valid for critics to question what (if any) might be the message the shows creators might be pushing, even inadvertently, about an individuals destiny and the extent to which forces rallied against them ultimately decide where they end up.

I nevertheless highly recommend this series (I have watched S1 to date) to mature viewers who can handle something that will quite definitely flip you out for a while, kicking the earth a little off its axis, get under your skin and stay there uncomfortably.

One can only hope that S2 is just as thought-provoking, uncompromising, challenging, sometimes thoroughly horrifying, the stuff of nightmares  dealing with the chasing of monsters that seem partly the stuff of legends and yet we know emerge to live in our midst every now and then.

6214479,5,B00HUCF420,"A truly compelling series. Originally envisioned as a novel by the creator, it retains the feel of a good read, full of detail. It quickly establishes a feeling of dread that never leaves you until the final chapter. Two former detectives, now estranged, are interviewed separately about a murder they investigated in 1995. As the interviews and flashbacks proceed, it becomes clear that something more is going on here. Be warned that the subject is child torture and murder. This story is anchored by two truly powerful, memorable, and multi-dimensional performances by Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson, backed up by a well-cast ensemble of seasoned performers. The locations and cinematography are first rate, a post Hurricane Andrew Louisiana landscape that helps create the feeling of hopelessness and futility. While there is violence, a lot is thankfully left to the imagination. The climax is unbearably suspenseful. Ultimately, in a curious way, the story ends up being life affirming, with a great last line.",1429228800,,1025,5.333333333333333

Excellently cast, shot, acted and directed, this 8 episode series will thrill fans of both police dramas and supernatural fiction. McConaughey gives what is probably the performance of his career as Rust Cohle, and Harrelson backs him up with the less explosive, but still interesting Martin Hart. What sold this series to me is the subtle whisper of the mystic and supernatural at its background, evoking Lovecraft and Chambers. It's an element that is never overdone, just enticingly off to the side, and is a great tribute to weird fiction in general.

6214629,5,B00HUCF420,"Whoa.  Mind blown.

This first season tells the story of two detectives- Marty Hart(Woody Harrelson) and Rustin Cohle(Matthew McConaughey) and their involvement in a 17-year long case of a serial killer in rural Louisiana.  Get ready for a ride that is both philosophical as well as dark, sometimes disturbing with lots of action, but not in any way you have seen before from any cop show.  The work itself is brilliant but when compared with CSI, NCIS or Criminal Minds, it makes all those shows laughable and entirely forgettable.

For one, it takes a more realistic look at what it is like to track a serial killer.  It does not get resolved in one episode.  It takes over 17 years which is how a lot of these cases go.  Of all the true crime novels I have read and the documentaries I have watched, this work of fiction comes closer than any I have ever seen.  Plus it is shot in 16mm film- not digital which gives it a grainier, darker look and feel.  Even the blue lights on the cop cars when Rust and Marty find themselves in a Louisiana ghetto are striking instead of ordinary or blinding.

We start off with Rust and Marty talking to two younger detectives about the case from 1995 while it is currently 2012.  Through their words as well as flash backs, we see what these two men went through to hunt a serial killer who has left a victim with her hands bound and antlers on her head.  If you have seen the TV show Hannibal, it looks similar to a typical victim on there(not sure why Hannibal uses so many victims who look so similar and are therefore forgettable).  Well in this show, you only get this first one.  From there, they go through a long sweeping journey of interviewing C.I.'s, prostitutes and drug dealers to get to the killer.  This is much closer to the anguish of real police work, but don't think for a second it is not entertaining.

Marty considers himself a Christian while Rust professes to believe that evolution made us too self-aware and the best thing mankind can do is walk hand in hand into extinction.  So yes.  Rust is quite the optimist(laughs).  Despite his dreary outlook(which given his history, is totally understandable) Rust proves to be an ace detective in many ways while Marty is the glue that keep Rust from getting fired from a state police department where Rust's ideas and methods are not looked upon with kindness or understanding.  This bond guides them through the years where we see them interact on a number of different levels in the hunt.

This is the best show I have seen since Breaking Bad and gives it a clear run for its money, hindered mainly due to it only being eight, one-hour episodes.  The dialogue and acting is superb and brace yourself.  You will not be seeing any of the pretty places in Louisiana.  Straight up down-trodden places where hope is a pipe dream.  Think of the graininess of Silence of the Lambs or the French Connection but on a rural level.

I really cannot say enough about this.  For the price, it is a steal.  If it were twice what the price is, it would still be a steal.  And if you like shows with lots of good quotes, this one has plenty.  Nothing is typical and everything is so well thought out.  I have watched every episode a number of times and I still pick up on new things.  Do yourself a favor and order this masterpiece today!",1426809600,,3334,4.466887417218543

The interplay between the two detectives is amazing -- respect offset by loathing interspersed with compassion.  What a pair!  The long philosophical ramblings are also though provoking.  I love it.

However, the performances by McConaughey, Harrelson, and everyone else are too good to miss.  I've watched this season three times already, and will probably watch it again several more times.  Every episode is as good as any full-length feature film you'll see in this genre.

Be warned, however, you will become spoiled by this 'cop drama'.  It'll be hard to go back to something like 'Law And Order' after seeing how good a show about homicide detectives can actually be.",1425686400,,571,4.895833333333333

However, as many folks have pointed out in reviews, the writers and producers seemed to loose the plot and it finally ended with the traditional bad movie magic with highly unlikely hunches, lucky guesses, CSI type computer searches on a personal laptop (the cure for solving a crime in 3 minutes), and the grand finale: The Chase Through The Abandoned Factory. Too bad, as it could have been much better if they had put some more thought into it.",1425686400,6,604,4.644859813084112

Great acting steeped in heavy atmosphere, that's the best way to describe it.  I could watch Matthew and Woody on mute and just drool over the beautiful scenery in every episode but then I'd be missing out on what I can only call the best written cop drama of the last 20+ years.  And their characters' evolution over the course of all 8 episodes did NOT go how I expected it to at all!  If you haven't given this show a try, please do.

With that said, I consider myself a seasoned crtic especially of TV show series versus movies. I remain anon., but write for yahoo and others.  This series was brilliantly done.  Of course, now a days producers are stretching the 'darkness' in plots more and more. After all, it is a detective show and I do recommemd it. If you only watched 1 or 2 episodes then stopped umsatissfied then you are fool.  And, people who complain about slowness or episodes dragging on amd on....well, welcome to TV series. They all do it to keep viewers coming back. Be patient. Acting is good and complete. Thebiggest complent i can give, that cant be said about.other series...is that EVERYTHING was brought together, in full by the last episode of entire series.  Not much was left to ponder as a viewer.  They closed out the plots and various plots withing the plots....to a point i was satisfied and content.  I felt good at the ending of it...walking away thinking wow ""what a great, real, and all encompassing story"".  After all, arn't tv shows and movies designed to make us feel?  To pull us out of our mundane daily grind and into this True Detective storyline or other shows.  This show does that more so and better than a lot of other shows.  I looked forward to watchig each and every episode!  I kept guessing what would happen and was always shocked.  I wasn't able to guess the plot Who, What, Where or When.  I.didnt want to, nor did I try because i just let the story unfold each episode as it captured my full undistracted attention.  Not all tv shows or movies accomplish this. This one did.
From the beginning thru to the end, this series and overall storyline was terrific, complete and satisfying all the way up to the very end....very last sentence made it fully, 100% complete.",1424563200,,1982,4.622857142857143

Slight spoiler: It's like I can see Rust and Marty, old and cranky, hating each other and yes, even though they would never even admit it to themselves, loving each other, after having been through everything, wheeling each other into the sunset.  Superb acting and use of Louisiana landscape.

Only one thing bothered me. The satanic cult thing is almost a cliche nowadays, even if it does exist in the real world.",1424390400,,493,4.64367816091954

Dark and complicated protagonists, compelling dialogue, and a heady mix of death and magic in the Bayou.  I was grabbed by the first episode and hooked until the end.  The show only works because of the leads - Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey.  McConaughey seems to get all the press when critics talk about this show but the series only works because of the rapport and tension established between these two characters.

By its title you know this is a ""cop show"" but this is no ordinary police tale. The characters feel like they are people you have known a long time and you care greatly for them throughout the course of this eight-episode series. Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey, their acting and chemistry are incomparable to anything else. The writing is superb and delivered with the utmost excellence from all the actors/actresses involved. I have no words for the storytelling as it is beyond great. Are you starting to get the message that this is a good show to watch? If not, just keep reading all the praise by others on Amazon to convince you. The special features on this Blu-ray are decent but I do wish the interviews and ""Inside the Episode"" segments were much longer. No big gripe though, the show itself is worth the purchase.

When you're not marveling at the way the show is shot you're literally listening to Mathew McConaughey spit nihilistic philosophy and ripping butts in quasi-pornographic ways for hours. It's not even a critical to the story and you're stuck watching him look like a homeless drug addict preach to everybody about how smart he is while he crushes beers and packs of cigarettes for all to see. Sure you'll agree with a lot but in the end you want more.
Lastly when you peel away it's beautifully artful facade you get a ho-hum cop drama with so many stereotypes you realize you've been duped. It's a sexy women with beautiful tattoos who, you guessed it, chugs cheap beer and still thinks smoking cigarettes is cool. Not much for substance is what I'm saying here folks.",1423267200,4,1021,4.677777777777778

6214961,5,B00HUCF420,"True Detective is the work of Nic Pizzolatto, a young novelist who is now a very, very well-known writer/filmmaker.  Rarely does a young crime writer suddenly find himself authoring an 8-part HBO series and doing it with such skill and self-assuredness.

True Detective concerns an investigation of a ritualized murder by two detectives, Martin Hart (Woody Harrelson) and Rust Cohle (Matthew McConaughy).  The investigation consumes 17 years.  During that time the characters grow, change and devolve.  Marty is the staid, solid family man (until he has an extramarital affair); Rust is the troubled, philosophic loner who has spent years undercover (until his spirit is lifted by the results of the 17-year investigation).  The characters are probed in depth as each partner is questioned/interrogated by `current day' detectives.  As time elapses Marty's hairline recedes as his waistband expands.  Rust's moustache becomes more and more wispy as he sips beer, cuts the cans into iconic shapes and looks progressively more wired, more addicted and, simultaneously, more cautious and more clever.

This is reminiscent of Homicide: Life on the Street, in that the homicide detectives are (to a considerable degree, certainly in Rust's case) intellectuals.  While they know how to use their weapons, they are thinkers.  They plot timelines.  They interrogate witnesses.  They look for gaps and for lies.  They think about the larger world, about the forces of light and the forces of darkness.

While Homicide was set in Baltimore to good effect (though not to the degree that it was in The Wire), True Detective is set in Louisiana.  The landscape is haunted in every conceivable way.  Images become more and more stark as the colors of the sky become bleached and leaden.  In the opening episodes it is winter and the trees are bare and even barren.  The landscape is deathly and otherworldly.  The cinematography is nothing short of stunning.

Told in eight episodes, the acting, the writing and the direction are consistently brilliant (and I do not use that word lightly).  The forces of evil are titanic and, simultaneously, banal.  The sets (particularly the sets in the final episode) are unforgettable.  The music by T Bone Burnett is haunting and dark.  This is television narrative of a very high order.

There will be a second season, but with different characters and a new story.  If the series continues at the same level as the first season it will become a landmark in the history of televised noir.  This is not to be missed.",1422403200,,2542,5.07487922705314

6215017,5,B00HUCF420,"Well, HBO have done it again. Their trademark production values, attention to detail, masterful casting and world-class writing have yet again combined to bring us an astonishing bit of TV drama.

The mood is set from the outset by the brilliant opening credits accompanied by the perfect country murder ballad (Far From Any Road by the Handsome Family) and throughout the show the music sets the tenor perfectly. The score and cinematography combine to conjure an atmosphere densely grim, grimy and oppressive, redolent with Louisiana heat and humidity as the plot flows from one run-down ramshackle backwoods hovel to another.

The initial plot folllows the present day review of an old 1995 murder case with interviews with the two main protagonists (`Rust' Cohle - Matthew McConaughey and Marty Hart - Woody Harrelson) with flashback sequences detailing the action. This engrossing format continues as the case unfolds following murder and child abduction deep into the seedy underbelly of the American Deep South. The tension and pace are deftly managed as the relationship between Rust and Marty unravels during the investigation with Rust's obsessive, almost Aspberger's-like behaviour and Marty's philandering adding personal strains to an already overbearingly tense investigation.

Both lead actors play their parts perfectly; McConaughey is absolutely astonishing while Harrelson, by no means one of our favourite actors, is actually perfectly cast, despite all of the chin-out pouting hard-face thing that he does. They both play deeply flawed, utterly plausible characters to perfection and the supporting cast dovetail perfectly with their performance.

It is hard to heap too much praise on this incredible production. On the surface it is only a TV cop-buddy show but there is so much depth and atmosphere that you're dragged into its steamy, swampy depth from the first note of the opening credits. Fantastic stuff and there's another season (although not with the same cast - this time starring Colin Farrell and Vince Vaughn) currently in production.",1421539200,,2069,5.416149068322981

This could only be better if it was a 12-15 episode series. The appeal for this series has two levels. On the surface it's an interesting serial killer story drawn out throughout the series. On another level it delves into a philosophical character study that is conducive with the existentialist/pessimistic themes of classic film noir.,1420675200,,492,5.573333333333333

6215094,5,B00HUCF420,"Emily Blunt over at BluntReview (dot) come ads: True Detective is brilliant. The writing, acting, music, cinematography. There's no one episode tie ups here kids. You get to savor the unfolding, while its ambiance infuses deep drama. Oh, you'll get a conclusion...in its own time. Meanwhile, enjoy. You may need to do the subtitles a few times for Mc's verbal deliverance, and shudder at Woody's dual moral traits (<- like real people). All of which just ads to TD's rare visceral enjoyment. The story is great, the characters resonate deeply, and have fabulously rounded stories; yeah, the actors matter very much here - their additions and choices. True Detective is scary, thrilling, humorous and one of the finest shows aired. You will not see what's coming next and there's no Scooby-Doo-like repeats that we see these days. Own this and share it with your most savvy film friends. Delightful. On a shallow chic-babe note: TD also manages the unfathomable.

6215149,4,B00HUCF420,"I watched the whole first season with my mom this past week. I am very interested in the process of criminal investigations and I enjoy watching crime thrillers. This show definitely goes beyond that. It's very dark, very tense, and very thought-provoking. Sometimes it was a difficult show to watch, there were times it unnerved me, and there were times it made me angry. At one point, I wasn't sure if I was capable of finishing the season because there were too many things that touched too close to home. I'm really glad that I watched all the way through because everything comes full circle; I really enjoyed the conclusion, and it made me appreciate previous episodes more. However, there is one thing that annoyed me: the abundance of sex and female nudity. The sex wasn't as abundant as in other TV shows I've seen, but it still had me thinking: ""Really? Another one? Can't we just get on with the story, please?"" As a girl, it's annoying to have some other girl's boob thrown in my face every time I watch TV or a movie. If I were a guy, I'd be in 7th Heaven - bus, alas, I'm not.

Now that I've had time to vent on my soap box, I'll conclude by saying that I would definitely recommend this TV series to those that enjoy dark and thought-provoking crime thrillers. I was endeared and oftentimes exasperated by the interactions between the two male leads, and I'm looking forward to season two. I hope that it will be just as good, if not better.",1420329600,2,1456,4.473684210526316
6215160,5,B00HUCF420,"There have been many excellent reviews already.  I just want to add a few additional observations:

1. True Detective is one of the finest crime dramas ever developed for TV.  It has its weaknesses but in terms of character development and storytelling it holds its own against much longer series such as The Sopranos, Breaking Bad, The Wire, The Shield, and NYPD Blue (all series I've loved and viewed multiple times).

2. True Detective improves with repeat viewing.  The dialogue is dense and covers a lot of narrative.  It is hard to absorb in the first go around.  I have watched it three times now and each viewing has revealed something I missed from an earlier take.  Also, I curiously find that the pace improves with repeat viewings.  I thought the first couple of episodes seemed slow during my initial viewing; I wasn't thoroughly hooked that time until episode three or four.  The episodes seem to go faster with each viewing which I attribute to increased understanding of the plot.

3.  Be prepared that the characters of Rust Cohle and Marty Hart will stay with  you a long time. I can't praise the acting of Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson highly enough.  They were given a great script and neither throws away a single line.  That being said, Michelle Monaghan was really dealt a short hand when it came to the role of Marty's wife.  That character is static and boring but Michelle brought as much nuance as she could to the role.

4. Some other reviewers have stated that they had a hard time understanding the dialogue.  The dialogue is dense and accents are thick at times.  My suggestion is to turn on the close caption option for your TV or streaming device.  Rather than being distracting, I think you will find this improves the comprehension of the script.

5. The ending redeems shortcomings of the other episodes.  It is fitting, believable, surprising, and has moved me to tears each time I've seen it.  So many of the negative reviews seemed to be from people who gave up on the show after only watching one episode.  Dear viewer, you may be rewarded by a truly moving story if you stick it out.",1420329600,,2134,4.659517426273458

6215234,5,B00HUCF420,"First movie review written and just for True Detective.

I gotta say I love Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, Sopranos and all the last great TV shows. But this show hits you like nothing else. It cinematography is unlike anything I have ever seen, first rate acting (Matthew steals every scene he's in), best musical + scenery intro EVER, and just an overall impeccable script. Most shows I am able to pick holes in in every episode. Not with this one. It is highly realistic and breaks the average good cop/bad guys type shows that I don't watch because they are so ridiculous.

This is the best show I have seen this year and definitely the best miniseries I have seen. Top 3 shows of all time for me. You HAVE to watch this season. I don't know how the new cast is gonna be able to compete with this amazing season. My girlfriend and I still ask each other questions about the show.

If you have not seen this yet, do so now. This is a keeper and one to return to for the scenes you might have not really watched.
I know it was on television, but it reminded me of a show I saw called HOME in London. Sir John Gieguld (sp) and another Award winning actor on stage with one other person the entire time. You were breathless when you left the theatre.
I believe this show on television was of the same caliber and that is now NOT impossible to do. This duo was groundbreaking for a medium that has been bringing us reality and ridiculous programs for too long now.  Thank you all.",1419638400,,865,4.236363636363636

6215353,4,B00HUCF420,"The acting is marvelous.  The story of rape and ritual murder seems as though it is after-thought structure necessary for the author's real interest.  The philosophy/theology meme came from deep in the heart of the darkest male dormitory.  The women are like those Fashion Design paper cutouts that little girls receive as presents at Christmas - dress them any way you want, they exist to provide two-dimensional echo chambers to the deeper angst, darker struggles of the males: victims, tools of pleasure, symbols of male failure.

It is as though a Punch and Judy puppet troupe decided to put on the Texas Chain Saw Massacre I in drag.  Wow!  Something entirely new.  It's not.  Behind the make-up, behind the dark story, behind the genius of the filmed atmospherics lies Punch and Judy - who aren't bad at all.

Nic Pizzolatto - writer, creator, apparently chief spider of the web deserves both credit and encouragement.

Flaws, flaws, flaws, but still a gem.

6215377,4,B00HUCF420,"The star of this show is Matthew McConaughey's acting. It's like when a magician pulls a rabbit out of a hat. First, he'll show you the empty hat. And you know that you're at a magic show, and so you know he's bound to get the rabbit out of the hat, because that's what he's getting paid to do. But leading up to the big finish, part of you is sort of worried for said magician and you think that, really, maybe he won't be able to do it and he'll still just have an empty hat. Matthew McConaughey's acting is that hat. The show is good, so you expect he'll surprise you, but you're still holding the mild thought that he may fail.

He doesn't. I, for one, was impressed.

The first 6-7 or so episodes are really strong. The acting is very good, and the story seems well developed and is well paced.

The last few episodes feel extremely rushed, however. The ending basically comes out of nowhere. It was disappointing because of that, but I'd watch it again.",1419379200,,959,4.287292817679558
6215388,3,B00HUCF420,"Great acting by Matthew McConaughey; maybe the best of his career,  And Woody and the rest of the cast brought up the rear.  The story was too morbid because of all of the gruesome/objectionable material used in it.  Because of this I give it 3 stars instead of five. I did not enjoy seeing such terrible stuff and don't think that you would either.  Had I known about this earlier, I would not have watched this movie.  Maybe some people like this kind of stuff, but I don't think that it should be seen by anyone in a movie.",1419379200,,526,4.2727272727272725

6215544,5,B00HUCF420,"I am a rabid fan - so you will get another rhapsodic review here.  Not that there are not flaws here - HBO seems determined to showcase a certain amount of female nudity in its series - and there are moments when having Woody's character demonstrate the hypocrisy and corruption he inhabits, but the show lingers on flesh well beyond what is needed to make a point.
Having said that - what an amazing effort and result.  Name another show that attempts the level of complexity and daring this one does - and succeeds on every level.  My quick view on what works:
1. Introduces a dark and daring world view - see ""The Conspiracy Against the Human Race"" for the basis of Rust's worldview - anti-natalism, the belief that self awareness is an evolutionary mistake...weaving that viewpoint into a mainstream series seems beyond daring.
2. Search Engine referencing - It is clear that Nic Pizzolatto understands his audience and the eagerness they search for Easter eggs and hidden reference points.  Never before have I seen a series that moves those reference points into the body of the drama and out of the shadow of an aside.  Referring the ""The Yellow King"" is never explained, but the context it gives to the madness spread in these small Louisiana towns is essential.  Why doesn't the writer explain it?  He knows you will google it.
3. Soundtrack - to be expected from T-Bone Burnett, but truly a perfect score and selection of songs.
4. Visuals - the decay and vastness of the Louisiana coastline shrink the 2 men at the center of the story, oppresses them.  You can feel the swampland pressing in on our notions of permanence.
5. Violence - unlike the nudity, most of the violence feels right and appropriate - with the worst taking place off screen and therefore more terrifying.
6. Views into the past - Having the character's relate the story some years later as the literary device is highly effective - and somewhat missed at the end of the series.

The story is related in a non-linear fashion mostly to sustain interest, to keep the viewer guessing, curious about what comes next. The side story of Marty's disastrous life is practically a separate TV show. Less would have been more than enough to establish the kind of man he is. (And the fake sex is really boring. Enough already.) But mostly I fault the direction. Very long establishing shots, very long process shots of just stuff (skylines, vehicles rolling along country roads). Long close ups of our leads. Pauses in dialogue you could drive a fleet of trucks through. Prolonged scenes of heedless hedonism and brutal violence only tangentially related to the plot so they appear to have been stuck in to take up time and show the viewer the gritty reality of, uh, something.

So be warned. There is an enormous amount of dead air in these hours.",1417132800,27,1009,4.636871508379889

6215588,4,B00HUCF420,"Louisiana, 1995. A young girl's body is found tied to a tree, the victim of what appears to be a ritualistic murder. Two officers are assigned to the case: Martin Hart, a dyed-in-the-wool traditional detective who enjoys drinking and is having an affair, and Rust Cohle, a ferociously intelligent man who ponders philosophical and existentialist concepts whilst working. Over the course of seventeen years, the case is apparently solved but then re-opened again as Hart and Cohle, whose relationship suffers seismic shocks, face the possibility that they may have gotten things wrong.

True Detective is HBO's latest big-hitter series, an anthology show in which each season will be a different, self-contained story with its own locations and characters. This first season is set in Louisiana (after True Blood and Treme, HBO probably have a discount on filming there) and is focused on a very clever serial killer who knows how to make it look like he's disappeared whilst carrying on his work.

True Detective has won enormous plaudits for a number of its achievements, and I can only join the choir here. The cinematography is breathtaking, the sense of atmosphere and place vivid and the acting by everyone, but in particular Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey, is outstanding. The show's artistic ambition, using the traditional detective story framework to express thoughts and ideas about science, religion, nihilism, existentialism and corruption, is commendable. The structure of setting the story in three distinct timeframes and moving between them is also very successful, with the 1995 segment foreshadowing and the 2012 segment obliquely referencing things that happened in the 2002 segment which we then get to see unfold.

The show does have a number of problems, however. For a story that only lasts for eight hour-long episodes, the pacing often feels off. Some episodes are rammed full of incident, character development and thematic musings and are highly compelling. Others are almost bereft of substantial content until the obligatory end-of-episode cliffhanger. Or to put it another way, a show this short really shouldn't have such long periods which nothing much is going on. There is also the confusion of the show making frequent references to Robert W. Chambers's The King in Yellow (itself an inspiration for Lovecraft's Cthulu mythos) but then not making it clear that the book itself does not exist in the show's universe.

The series also hints that it may represent the end-point of what television as an art form can do, particularly on a short timescale. Rust Cohle returns to the ideas of the point of our existence in an empty universe, the struggling with the idea of an afterlife and the inescapable loneliness of being stuck inside our own skulls several times, but each time doesn't really develop them or have more to say on them. We get some great quotes out of these ruminations, but little more. This is because a TV show focused on a more traditional narrative drive simply hasn't got the time or space to delve into these ideas as well as a novel can. If this is the Golden Age of Television, True Detective hints at what might become its limiting factor.

Other complaints may be made, particularly over the thinness of the female characters and some rather completely out-of-place sex scenes (this is HBO, after all), but these complaints are to some degree born out of the premise, of the dwelling on the relationship between these two very different men (one of them old-school with misogynistic tendencies).

The first season of True Detective (****) is a rich, visually rewarding and structurally inventive story driven by outstanding performances and clever - if not developed fully - thematic ideas. There are also too many longueurs and moments of narrative stasis in a story that should really be unfolding with more verve and drive, but overall this is an impressive story. Whether Nic Pizzolatto can strike gold again with the forthcoming second season remains to be seen.",1417132800,,4037,5.099848714069592

6215623,4,B00HUCF420,"Let's begin with how outstanding the acting is, especially from Matthew McConaughey (Woody Harrelson is, well, Woody Harrelson, although that personality plays well as a sounding board for McConaughey).  But you had better be ready to stick this out for the duration because it takes all eight episodes to solve this case.  So, let's jump to the beginning three episodes which introduce the show and the characters (yup, about three hours of your time);  you'll likely want to give up at this point, for really, what IS the point?  Two detectives, both of them pretty messed up in the head, trying to work out not only their own lives (of course, not believing that they HAVE any problems) as well as a series of murders in Bayou country.  But before you stop, put on the next episode (#4) and things begin to congeal (and get better from there).  Corruption, biker gangs, cults, voodoo, it's all here...if you're willing to wait.  The true gift might be watching McConaughey as he transforms into an introspective and slow-drawl personality, his face barely moving, his Zen-like insomnia making him even more difficult to read (the writer and creator is even more so if you decide to watch the extra features with his comments).  But be warned, you WILL have to wait as this series moves like a blob of molasses, satisfying at the end but taking its time to get to you.  Dark, gothic, spooky, chilling, they are all appropriate descriptions of this series (supposedly coming back next year with an all new cast and characters) and there are some great lines such as McConaughey saying, ""Look, it's none of my business...I don't want to hear it.""  Which sort of sums up this series;  some will find it gripping around the fourth hour or so, the writing and the acting growing progressively better and luring you in.  But again, you gotta wait for it...",1416614400,3,1852,4.753125

Superb performances kept me grounded despite the film's disturbing themes and often brutal images. Think Hannibal: The Series, but unfettered by network  television's codes regarding what viewers are permitted to experience and what not.

Nic Pizzolatto is the shows creator, and he has made a huge impression on me with his creative mind of this show. I hope he continues to impress me with his creative power.

6215699,5,B00HUCF420,"Since I don't have a TV and only follow pop culture via the internet, I was able to hear about the show without having seen the trailers.  I had read discussions about it on Slate, and heard people in the office mention it, so I knew it was highly regarded; however I hadn't seen any clips of it.  I think this allowed me to watch it exactly as the author/director/screen writers intended; I saw it as they had laid out the story line, without any unintended foreshadowing or foreknowledge.

It was brilliant.

I bought the first episode on Amazon just to try it out.  I paused the first episode at about the 15 minute mark to return and buy the entire series b/c I knew I'd watch the following episodes in an orgy of TV pleasure.

I had thought that Matthew McConaughey was a bit of a light weight actor, a handsome visage hiding a lack of talent.  I could not have imagined the level of acting depth he brought to his virtuoso performances in this series.  He portrays a character of complexity, ambiguity and drive, to the point where when the plot twists, you as the viewer are unsure what to believe--the character  you've just seen or the disparaging things other character say about him.

The writing of the entire script was thrilling in the way it see-sawed through past events, recapping these events and then forward into an undefined future.  The characters, during their interviews about a crime in the past, obfuscate and redefine their true motivations, desires, and mistakes in pursuit of varying personal objectives.  The apparently upstanding and publicly moral detective is show to have deep personal failures, while the ostensible moral failure is not so bad after all.  When the wild eyed zealot swears it must be true, and you've been led to believe him, can you then side with what appears to be objective reality and say, ""yes, he's chasing ghosts.""?

Probably the best $25 bucks I've spent at anything that gave me such intense interest for 8 solid hours followed by hours of contemplative reflection.

6215755,3,B00HUCF420,"I liked the series a lot. The acting is superb, truly 5 star talent. However, I gave it only 3 stars because
1. One feels short-changed in a crime so vast and covering such a long period of time, that more of the criminal darkest elements weren't shown. For instance, I would have liked to see at least one scene with Tuttle showing up and darkly leering before putting on his animal skins.
2. They could have explained why the father was bound and imprisoned, perhaps with some flashbacks.
3. The ending was shortened with too much really good 'stuff' undone due to lack of time. For instance, what was the blue circular tornado-like spiraling light in the ceiling that mesmerized Marty before he was attacked in the underground quarters?
4. And explain more the reason for the horrific criminal activity. What was gained by those partaking, if anything?",1414972800,6,855,4.74496644295302

6215762,5,B00HUCF420,"As I finish watching True Detective again, I reflect on why this show gives me the reason and feeling to keep hitting the reply button. To get to the bare bones of the show, yes it is the same cop drama set up. So there's your answer if you want to get simple about it. You have murder, and you have a partner duo that has their problems. They will need to solve the murder and so forth but honestly, this is so much more. But what makes me give this a 5 star, and what made me actually buy this (I don't buy shows often I have maybe under ten) and keep watching it, is for the characters and plot. There is something about Rust Cohle and Marty Hart that makes me want to watch them. I enjoy this show so much to just watch this drama unfold and to watch how clever these characters are woven in the story. Whenever I start the season over again I watch with new eyes in case I missed something, since I would be so drawn to the story made me oblivious to it previously.

If you've been wondering what the hype has been about the bottom line is that you have been doing yourself a disservice if you haven't seen this yet. I'm a guy that could care less about much of the tv programming on today, I don't own cable and I don't keep up with what so many others say you should watch. I took a chance with this show.

6215797,4,B00HUCF420,"At first glance, TRUE DETECTIVE sounds like just another police procedural, with a plot that, with a few alterations, would have worked just as well on CSI or CRIMINAL MINDS, but while those shows are whodunits, TRUE DETECTIVE is much more a WhoSolvesIt.  For this crime, the detectives on the case are Rust Cohle, played by Matthew McConaughey, and Marty Hart, portrayed by Woody Harrelson, of the Louisiana State Police, who are called in to investigate the apparent ritualistic murder of a young woman in an isolated field.  It soon becomes obvious that a serial killer is on the prowl and there is much more going on than meets the eye.

But when I say TRUE DETECTIVE is a WhoSolvesIt, I mean the show is as much the story of these two detectives as it is about the search for a killer; Cohle and Hart are in 90% of the scenes, with only a few brief side trips to heighten the tension.  And we get to know these two men very well in the course of eight episodes, and learn that calling them ""difficult"" is putting it mildly.  From the get go, Rust Cohle is clearly damaged goods, years of deep undercover work and a ghastly family tragedy has left him with a dark and nihilistic world view, and in a place where the dogged work of being a detective is the only thing that gives him purpose.  On the outside, Marty Hart is a conventional family man, with a wife and two daughters, but he is one of those cops who has come to believes that the dirty job he must do, along with the savagery he witnesses, have entitled him to a few perks, like extra martial sex with a court reporter. Neither one particularly likes the other, but each in their own way, is determined to get to the truth; and as the story progresses, it becomes cleat that these two men are the only ones who will ultimately catch the killer, even if it takes 17 years and long after both of them have left the force. It won't be giving anything away to say that when the killer is finally revealed, we learn that like most serial killers, they were in plain sight all along.

In the past, I have not always been the biggest fan of McConaughey and Harrelson, but they completely won me over here in the way they committed to their characters and made them real. We truly come to understand Cohle and Hart, their failings, their regrets and their demons; they live in a world populated by monsters who leave their mark upon all who encounter them, but it is also a world where love endures in the face of terrible evil, as these two men come to understand at the end.

There are a few familiar faces in the supporting cast: Kevin Dunn, Shea Whigham, Jay O. Sanders; Michelle Monaghan is Hart's patient wife who finally has enough and detonates their marriage, while the gorgeous Alexandria Daddario is the woman with whom he cheats on her with and who doesn't take being spurned lightly. Brad Carter is effective in his scene as a prisoner in Angola possessing pertinent information.

The other great supporting character in TRUE DETECTIVE is the state of Louisiana itself, with it's lush greenery and bayous; trailer parks and little box houses; fishing communities and endless two lane blacktops going to no place in particular.  Most of the homes Cohle and Hart visit seem to be in a permanent state of decay, while off on the horizon are huge oil refineries, emblems of a wealth and power those in its midst will never touch.

All praise to creator Nic Pizzolatto and director Cory Fukunaga for putting together a show that is so much more than its parts; especially liked the way they framed the first half of the show by having the present day Cohle and Hart being interrogated about events long in the past and using it as a device to slowly peal back the layers of story and character.  T Bone Burnett contributes some excellent music that perfectly sets the mood; and that is one killer of an opening credits.  By all means see TRUE DETECTIVE on Blu Ray, it is well worth the extra money.",1414627200,,3964,4.48127600554785

6215826,2,B00HUCF420,"This series might as well have been dreamed up and directed by David Lynch, the master of madness and murk. It is shot in faded color that looks like tinted black-and-white and that's appropriate because the story itself is like tinted black-and-white. It moves at an absolutely glacial pace and consists mostly of lengthy examinations into the lives and character of the two detective protagonists as played by Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey. They are ostensibly investigating a particularly bizarre and ritualistic occult murder, but the investigation is completely secondary to these equally bizarre and somehow disturbing portraits of the men doing the investigating. Since it's an HBO production, there's plenty of profanity and at least some fairly frontal nudity.

Set in southern Louisiana, it has - in addition to the Lynch characteristics - definite Faulknerian echoes of a phosphorescently decayed South. The atmosphere is uniformly dark and depressing, and sometimes - as with McConaughey's incessant cigarette smoking and growling, muttering, slow-motion drawl - downright irritating. It is difficult, during these lengthy soliloquys, not to wonder - who cares? It's sort of the Faulkner south overlaid with echoes of David Lynch's Twin Peaks - a series of the 80's set in Colorado that also begins with the finding of a dead woman and whose stygian darkness soon spirals off into impenetrable madness. As with True Detective, the investigation of the killing not only becomes aggravatingly protracted and endlessly sidetracked with obscure-but-evil seeming asides, you can't help wondering - what's the point? That two detectives have somehow come acropper because of their investigation into a grotesque killing? I didn't stay with it long enough to find out.

Harrelson is, as always, pugnaciously dreadful with his jutting lower jaw and bone-stupid conversation, and his character in this drama is almost impossible to like. McConaughey's character, on the other hand, starts out being much the most interesting of the two, but in the lengthy character asides, he somehow degenerates from reasonably respectable and presentable into a seedy-looking bum with long, stringy hair and a wispy, disreputable-looking beard, constantly drinking beer and booze from a flask and annoyingly chain-smoking cigarettes down to the filter. Unfortunately, the lengthy asides do little to explain this dysfunctional transformation - at least not in the first two long episodes. In fact, there's no explanation of many things, but chiefly why both characters are being grilled by unidentified persons who, one is forced to assume, are from Internal Affairs. Losing patience and feeling somehow sullied by the whole affair, I dropped out after the first two episodes, so I can't really say if the series improves as it goes along, but it's opening installments are not encouraging. It seems to consist of dark weirdness for its own sake and if there's a point to any of it beyond that, I missed it.",1414368000,5,3006,5.353065539112051

  -------------  Disclaimer --------------

  B4 we go any further,,, let's just get one thing straight here  Movies, Arts & Crafts, Food, Colours and Fashion are WITHOUT question extremely subjective things altogether, period.
To come 'across' as an un-educated self-centred individual would be an extremely foolish thing to do,,, especially when attempting to express 'your views OR opinions of the Mini-Series True Detectives.
  A screening of 'such' unsurpassed brilliance should never be underestimated. As a person who sits at home for long periods of time due to a disability, I get to watch a lot of cable TV and after a while, you begin to realise that they're all the same with predictable plots and storylines, just like most horror movies.  Ahhhh enough already. There is simply no way possible of determining the outcome - not to mention all the twists and turns associated with this Mini Series. The brains behind this mixed up, twisted and very sick natured episodes Is nothing but a Sheer genius of astonishing magnitude FULL STOP. The 'shock value' factor with in this film is truly of a different kind. There is no denying the actual links of the entire series however, it's perfectly matched to the simple but oh so very effective over all nature of the story. To this very day, I'm simply Gob smacked and very haunted from the things that took place in this movie. It is on a totally different level and really 'goes that extra mile' to make the viewer/s experience uniquely one of a kind with regards to its un-folding of events, but mostly for the way in which they took place.
Strictly top shelf material as no other even comes close to eats phenomenal brilliance and excellence in the way in which it is delivered.
  The icing on the cake would have to be just how GRAPHIC this series really can be, when you least expect it to be so.
  Finally, I'm no hero but I will tell you this as a gesture of how strong my belief is that True Detective is NOT really a show for the,,, shall we say ""The Intellectually Challenged', as it's Unorthodox Make up frustrates and irritates them.
A serious contender that I score a perfect 10/10 as anything less would be nothing but an insult to the makers and produces of such an awesome and extremely different series. A definite thumbs up.",1414022400,,2325,4.72029702970297

The very end of Episode 7 was almost haunting with the murderer's, Childress, declaration that his family had been there forever as the camera angle widens and pans away to encompass the rows upon rows of above ground crypts so prevalent in early Louisiana.
However, Episode 8 seemed very rushed. The intuitive leap of  Hart's about a house color that he had barely noticed the first time. The ease with which he was able to make connections to different secure databases online defied logic. The one in-depth interview by the new detectives and then hardly any more input from them. They let Cohle and Hart just walk? If they were so sure of Cohle's potential involvement, why did they not keep him under surveillance?
I will give the last run down and confrontation full marks for nail-biting tension and drama.
But, again, the final scene where Cohle decides he has had enough of the hospital was a little illogical unless he was trying to dodge the medical bills. If he were still so injured that Hart had to half carry him, why didn't he stay in the wheelchair?",1413676800,,1329,4.703862660944206

6215898,4,B00HUCF420,"If you are holding off on watching True Detective because its just another average cop drama, you need to rethink the term average. This HBO production is not simply about the crime that Detectives Marty Hart (Woody Harrelson), and Rust Cohle (Matthew McConaughhey) are investigating. Instead, the show is about discovering who these men are, how they feel about each other and makes you wonder how on earth they ended up as partners. As you begin to watch the show, you start to build your own ideas and formulate your own opinions as to who these men are and what really drives them.
  Some will say that Hart and Cohle are your typical 90s detectives, playing good cop bad cop, and use corny jargon. However there are others that would argue that these two don't have a moral compass, that they misinterpret the law, and abuse their position. I think they are a couple of men that are determined to solve a case, during which certain circumstances bring out the worst in both men. In addition, I feel these same circumstances bring the two together to form a bond that you would not normally find in people so different. So, is the show a good murder mystery? Yes, the show does have murder, some conducted by Hart and Cohle, but ultimately the real mystery of this show is the how the paring of two men evolves into a partnership, and ultimately a friendship.",1413158400,,1363,4.604938271604938
6215899,5,B00HUCF420,"The series, True Detective is a fascinating mystery crime drama TV series that was written by Nic Pizzolatto and created in the year 2014. Its principal is built using multiple timelines, which I believe makes the story more interesting and a bit confusing at the same time. The series opens up with a story of two detectives Rust Cohle and Martin Hart who are trying to solve a mystery and hunt a serial killer in Louisiana across seventeen years. Furthermore, this won't be the only story in the show as both detectives have different craters beside their good and dark sides that make the chemistry between the two outstanding and very interesting to watch. For instance, Jeff Jensen himself writes True Detective is many things at once, then he add simply and deeply, it is a story about two men telling a story. Actually as viewer, the way that the show was built on both the crime and on Rust and Martin made the story very fascinating and impressive. However, one of the biggest down fall of the show is the starting of the show was very slow which made the first two episodes a bad hook that can make it somewhat hard to keep interest on watching another.

True Detective is a series of 8 episodes and next season will have a different story and different characters, like American Horror Story but American Horror Story has the same characters.
The main plot of True Detective is two detectives, Marty Hart and Rust Cohle, start out by investigating a murder that took place in 1995. Like any television show there is some drama and the two detectives have a falling out and are called back in in 2012 to talk about the case because a very similar case has occurred.

6215913,2,B00HUCF420,"Common sense seems to dictate that True Detective was going to be your typical crime show, and end up like the all other popular crime shows like NCIS or Law and Order. However even though it has some of the normal detective feels to it, True Detective goes far beyond all the normal detective shows. The show is an eight episode story arc that takes place in the heart of Louisiana. The story follows a rape case of a woman that was murdered and found nude, bowing down, with devilish symbols drawn on her as well as placed around the crime scene. The case is taken up by two detectives named Rust Cohle and Marty Hart played by Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson respectively. The story follows the two detectives in a twisted story line that flips back in forth from present day to when the crime took place in the 1990s. Unlike shows like SVU and NCIS where violence and rape are discussed, the language and nudity are kept minimal to the viewer.  In True Detective this is not the case, the show is full of non stop cussing, and every episode is full of some type of nudity, from prostitutes to multiple affairs. The show could have been just as effective without those moments, which I think in return would have made the storyline more bearable. In saying this if you are okay with a dark show, lots of nudity, and language, this show is good for you, otherwise I wouldnt recommend it.",1412899200,5,1397,4.47843137254902

Loved Breaking Bad, and still do, but True Detective is an entirely new experience, probably owing to the coherency of the writing and directing, and the tightness of dialogue and transitions.  Only 8 shows rather than a few years of filming demanded the script be bareboned and polished...and that is exactly what the producers deliver and the viewer receives.  Don't be surprised if you find yourself rewinding to relisten to dialogue...not because it was inaudible, but because you want to assure yourself that you did in fact hear the surprisingly deep philosophical statements coming from Kohle in particular.  Great show!  I just don't see how they can match this with next season's lineup.",1412467200,,812,5.255813953488372

The series is set in Louisiana with a haunting theme about sex crime and murder.  Truly, the piece is more of an introspect on the relationship between the two main characters but the story line is also well done.  If you have not reviewed the 'special features' on the DVD, you haven't done this work justice.  I really love to hear comments from the author and producer of such works....Pizzolatto seems wise beyond his years; very talented writer.  McConaughey must have been doing the 'Dallas Buyer's Club' around the same time, as he looks anorexic...but it works well for him in this role.",1412208000,,733,4.76984126984127

6216026,4,B00HUCF420,"This show was great, but I'm not sure if it quite lived up to the hype.  The formula is something we are all familiar with-- an every-man socialite is paired with a prickly sociopathic genius (who has a heart of gold deep down, of course) to solve a mystery together.  That's not to say that this show is some kind of Sherlock Holmes clone, but I'd be lying if I said that this bit doesn't grow tiresome after a while.

The best and worst part of the show is Matthew McConaughey.  His portrayal of Rust Cohle is acted brilliantly, but I still couldn't help but roll my eyes during some of the scenes where the dialogue sounds like the ramblings of a stoned philosophy undergrad (perhaps this was its intended effect).  The dynamic between Cohle and his partner, Martin Hart (Woody Harrelson), is complex and believable, which is one of the things that separates True Detective from being just another buddy-cop detective/murder-mystery drama.

That's not to say that True Detective should be pigeon-holed as a cop drama, or anything else-- for every cliche that this show borrows, it brings something new to the table.  It takes a while to gain momentum, but season one is only eight hours, so it's not a huge time investment.  It's definitely worth a watch if you can appreciate good television, but its darkness and moral ambiguity may be a turnoff to fans of more traditional buddy-cop/mystery kind of shows.",1411862400,,1411,4.7306122448979595

6216029,1,B00HUCF420,"The substance of the show is a series of disjointed, internally inconsistent hodgepodge of philosophasting. I detected brief references to Schopenhauer and a mention of the death of god but both have no essential relation to the narrative or the characters personal journeys. It all seems to be just sprinkled on top for theatrics and stylism. Mcconaughey's character feels like an absurd grab bag of inchoate teen machismo.

That's not the worst part of the film. The films best failure is its narrative, which is really just a shrugging free fall into posturing, bland monologues about yet more philosophasting and soap opera. We are left not knowing who exactly Errol was. We do not know what carcosa was. We do not know or even have a lead on the others in the taped gang rape. We do not even know the full reach of the cult. We don't even know what exactly the cult is or the nature of its relation to pedophilia. We do not know who the ""yellow king"" is. Worst is that mcconaughey and harrellson, after years of laboring over Rust's nagging suspicion of some master conspiracy, the obsession with which is itself never explained, just walk away from it all for no apparent reason. One was forced to reintegrate himself in the narcotics underworld that drove him insane to get clues, was hated by all his employees and loses his job over the matter. The other descends into adultery and divorce. They almost die and then that's it, bye bye to the last 17 years. This is capped by one of the blandest dark vs light platitudes and rust finally believing in heaven.

Looking back, the show seems like just a series of emotes, just pure emotionalism with no intellectual conclusion. On no, a child gang rape filmed on tape, this is horrible. Oh no, these people are suffering, or these people are just trying to get through the day with a revival. Don't say they're stupid. Oh no, Marty's daughter is a whore. oh no, rust and Marty don't like each other anymore. Oh no, rust has sex with Maggie. Yay, they shoot the junkies that were torturing children. Yay, mysterious child rapist guy dies. Yay, rust didn't really do it all. He's a good guy. Again, all we get is a revolving door of emotional satisfactions that have no intellectual basis. Theatrical, anomalous, ambiguous events that are gauged to stimulate an abrupt emotional reaction from the audience.",1411776000,28,2359,4.709443099273607

6216094,5,B00HUCF420,"If youve been trolling new cable TV and Net series, you know that HBO, Showtime, AMC, Netflix, Amazon.com, A&E, and other major leaguers have amped up the quality in terms of dramatic power, story complexity, screenwriting excellence, direction, cinematography, musical scores, and star power. With major film studios churning out the endless vomitus of comic-book summer-blockbuster cgi extravaganzas (many on offer in glorious 3D to distract from the cardboard characters, abysmal dialogue, and hackneyed storylines), the serious work of filmmaking increasing falls to practitioners of the smaller screen. HOUSE OF CARDS, ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK, THE BLACKLIST, and THE KILLING are just a few of the outstanding series on offer to the discerning audience with a thirst for quality.

A-listers headline the best of these new cable and Net series; and TRUE DETECTIVE is one of the most brilliantly conceived and executed among them. Starring Matthew McConaughey (as Rust Cohle) and Woody Harrelson (as Marty Hart), an ill-matched pair of Louisiana state police detectives trying to solve a bizarre serial killer case, creator, executive producer, and showrunner Nik Pizzolatto (who wrote all eight of the first seasons episodes), and director Cary Joji Fukunaja, have concocted an anthology series (each season will have a new storyline, setting, and cast) of spellbinding suspense, mixed with existential dread rarely ventured upon in any American cinematic work. TRUE DETECTIVE, named after a famous 1950s pulp fiction magazine, deftly combines the Southern gothic tradition of writers such as Flannery OConnor and William Faulkner with neo-noir thriller elements reminiscent of filmmakers William Friedkin (TO LIVE AND DIE IN L.A., KILLER JOE), Roman Polanski (CHINATOWN, THE APARTMENT), David Lynch (BLUE VELVET, MULHOLLAND DRIVE), and even Alfred Hitchcock (PSYCHO, THE BIRDS)blended with touches of H.P. Lovecraftian cosmic horror. The result: one of the most addictive, disquieting, and entertaining TV series to come along in a long while.

From the brilliantly conceived opening credits, with their sensually eliding montage of Southern landscapes, highways, faces, and bodies, accompanied by a gritty blues song from T Bone Burnett (Pizzolattos friend and a key player in selling the series to HBO), to each episodes chilling fade to black with its hints of horrors to come, the series draws you deeper and deeper into the fetid vapor of a Louisiana bayou (its shot in and around New Orleans). Rust and Cohle struggle over 19 years, in two parallel storylines, to unmask a madman who tortures and kills women and mounts antlers on their bodies, leaving behind Devil catchers, small wooden teepee-like structures made of twigs, near his victims.

Yes, this ground has been covered in countless serial killer suspense thrillers; and yes, the series does have some rather tiresome aspects of a police procedural drama (the original investigation in 1995 and a follow-up interrogation/investigation of the original detectives in 2014, after the murders start up again). And yes, the show has detractors, such as NEW YORKER critic Emily Nussbaum, who, in her venomous savaging of the series, castigates it as macho-driven tripe that features, in her damning diction, clichs that are:

gratingly familiar to anyone who has ever watched a new cable drama get acclaimed as a dark masterpiece: the slack-jawed teen prostitutes; the strippers gyrating in the background of police work; the flashes of nudity from the designated put-upon wifey character; and much more nudity from the occasional cameo hussy, like Martys mistress, whose rack bounces merrily through Episode 2. Dont get me wrong: I love a nice bouncy rack. And if a show has something smart to say about sex, bring it on. But, after years of watching BOARDWALK EMPIRE, RAY DONOVAN, HOUSE OF LIES, and so on, Ive turned prickly, and tired of trying to be, in the novelist Gillian Flynns useful phrase, the Cool Girl: a good sport when something smells like macho nonsense.

According to critic Nussbaum, were supposed instead to like THE FALL, another cable series featuring X-FILES veteran Jillian Anderson as a female detective trying to track down a serial killer who also murders women; a series that also features plenty of female nudity. Im watching THE KILLING as I write this, and I agree that its first-rate; but is it really morally superior because the protagonist is female? No. Its superior because its brilliantly written, superbly acted, and competently directed. Anderson is outstanding. But its BBC-based scripting and cinematography are not nearly as good as TRUE DETECTIVEs. And whether a protagonist is male or female is irrelevant. Whats relevant is whether its a powerful story with compelling charactersand powerful stories can be carried by women or men with equal aplomb.

Then there are detractors who point out that Pizzolatto is heavily influenced by gothic horror writers such as Thomas Ligatti; that Pizzolatto lifts whole passages of dialogue from Ligattis non-fiction work of nihilistic philosophy, THE CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE HUMAN RACE; that Pizzolatto borrows metaphysical horror themes from Nineteenth Century author Robert W. Chambers, whose short story collection THE KING IN YELLOW features a fictitious play which, when read, drives each reader mad. And others point out that Pizzolatto borrows from Nietzsches theory of eternal return: that we are doomed to be reincarnated to live out the same life again and again for eternity. There are also more than a few hints of Buddhism in its Hinayana, Mahayana, and Zen incarnations, with their teachings about the Void and the ego as an illusion.

But Im going to side with the loyal opposition who say that Pizzolatto has created something awesome in scope, very nearly on a par with the dramaturgy of Dostoyevsky and Shakespeareoffering us a dialectical exploration of the nature of evil, a la MACBETH or CRIME AND PUNISHMENT. In other words, Pizzolatto has given us a drama with literary power. And the diametrically opposed worldviews of the two protagonists, Rust (a cool, lucid nihilist) and Hart (a conflicted conventional man completely out of touch with his own feelings), present us with a harrowing debate about the ultimate nature of the universe and the place of evil in it. Quite frankly, who cares if Pizzolato stole from other authors? So did Shakespeare. In fact, Shakespeares corpus is based entirely on material lifted from dozens of other authorsplagiarism simply didn't exist as a concept in Elizabethan England. The point here is, where else on TV or an Internet series can you get dialogue as rich as this, where the McConaughy character Rust reveals his worldview to his partner Hart in episode one, THE LONG, BRIGHT DARK:

Rust: I think human consciousness is a tragic misstep in evolution. We became too self-aware. Nature created an aspect of Nature separate from itself. We are creatures that should not exist by natural law. We are things that labor under the illusion of having a self. This accretion of sensory experience and feeling programmed with total assurance that we are each somebody, when in fact everybody is nobody. I think the honorable thing for our species to do is deny our programming. Stop reproducing. Walk hand in hand into extinction. One last midnight. Brothers and sisters opting out of a raw deal.

This could be a speech straight out of Dostoyevskys THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV. I was reminded of the Grand Inquisitor sequence where the atheist intellectual brother Ivan tries to convince his devoutly innocent monk brother Alyosha that there is no God. What were getting between the lines of a seemingly straight-up police procedural drama is an exploration of form and voidthat timeless debate in human consciousness about whether we live in a random, chaotic, meaningless universe, or a universe created by a loving God Who nevertheless permits plenty of mayhem and madness, for reasons unknown.

For a good bit of this series, Rust seems to be the voice of Pizzolatto, a professed nihilist; but Pizzolatto is too good a writer to let things rest there. In the season finale, after a brush with death, Rust himself shifts out of his nihilistic worldview after experiencing the love of his murdered daughter while deep in a coma.

No wonder critic Emily Nussbaum was so eager to dismiss this series as macho bull***. It undoubtedly scared the s*** out of her. It presents ultimate questions in a powerful, dramatic, engaging way that suggests that no matter how deeply our heroes dig, theres always another layer of onionskin to be pealed away. Thats powerful writing and storytelling. And the questions it asks are precisely the ones that people such as Nussbaum don't dare askits too scary. And yet, despite the mind-bending metaphysical and existential flourishes, in the season finale, the case is solved in a straightforward way that leaves some mysteries unsolved, but brings the season to an effective and satisfying full stop. I say let the mysteries remain, as they do in life, and in the films of great cinematic storytellers such as David Lynch.

Yes, the series is sometimes talky and novelistic (Pizzolatto is a novelist as well as a screenwriter). But his writing is just so damn goodand his storyline is punctuated, for example, by an ultraviolent episode four climax; and the issues he explores are so timeless and important, that on balance, you get a powerful emotional catharsis that you don't usually get in any TV series.

More importantly, as one critic mentioned, the series explores the nature of storytelling itself. Storytelling in the form of investigationthat is, constructing a story which leads to truth; and storytelling in the form of religion, seen as stories told to hide the truth. The serial killer in this series is part of an obscure religious cult that fetishizes ritual murder in the service of a twisted worldview that sacrifices the innocent to elevate the megalomania of its priesthooda megalomania, Pizzolatto hints, that is also present in fundamentalist strains of traditional religions. The cult in the series has existed for centuries, sustained by a wealthy and powerful Louisiana family that figures prominently in national politics. One cant help but think of theories such as the one about the Bush clan murdering all the Kennedys, or theories about the shadowy 1% at the top of the food chain who are really calling all the shots on the world stage, and who figure prominently in the nightmares of every conspiracy theorist. Another savvy critic suggested that Rust symbolizes the meaninglessness of life in post-2008-recession/post-imperial America; and Hart symbolizes the dispossessed American middle class that is slowly sinking into oblivion.

Whichever critical spin you accept, whatever your personal worldview, this series is powerful, challenging, thought-provoking, and wickedly entertaining. And writer Pizzolatto, director Fukunaja, McConaughey, and Harrelson all deserve Emmy nominationsand will probably get them.

I cant wait to see what Pizzollato dreams up for season two, several episodes of which are to be helmed by veteran neo-noir director William Friedkin, a personal favorite of mine.

Plus, the fact it jumps around from different time frames within the story, you have to really pay attention.  The only problem, it is very violent, there are several explicit sex scenes and the language is very course.  Its not an appropriate video for children, and as much as I would like to show this to my parents, I can not.  I think the graphic violence could have been toned down and the sex scenes could have been implied, to get their message across (yes, I understand the Harrelson character being a serial cheater on his wife is central to his character, but the sex could have been done less explicitly).  I don't understand Hollywood's continuing, and increasing fascination with not just sex, but abhorrent forms of it.  It does not serve to develop the plot or the characters.

6216149,5,B00HUCF420,"HBO rattled off many shows this year that rivaled the popularity of the Game of Thrones series, which claims more awards than the rest of HBOs lineup. The shows highest contender came from the suspenseful detective show True Detectives. True Detectives follows the lives of two Louisiana detectives as they attempt to solve one of the strangest cases in their lives. This case follows the sexually driven and ritualistic murders committed by a satanically influenced serial killer that send both detectives Rust Cohle and Marty Hart to the edge of the real and the paranormal.
Rust, played by Matthew McConaughey, portrays a detective with a tortured soul who came to Louisiana after numerous years undercover as a narc in a Texas bike gang. A failed marriage following the death of his daughter leads Rust to a deeply negative, existential wreck, which affects the relationship with his partner, Marty.
 Woody Harrelson plays Marty, apparently flawless patriarch of two daughters and loving wife-that contrasts the life of his partner, Rust. However, this stability weakens when the serial killer case tries Martys ability to fight the challenges of his work life. This failure to uphold his perfect appearance leads to him relying on destructive outlets that result in pulling him away from his family and his partner rather than closer.
The series director, Cary Fukunaga, does not bring the same fame as McConaughey and Harrelson do to the series, which boosts his credentials for future projects. However, a notable contributor rises to the top of the True Detective cast list: T Bone Burnet.
T Bone Burnet, who produced the music for True Detective, also produced the fan-favorite music for O Brother Where Art Thou. The soundtrack for O Brother Where Art Thou, which sticks in the minds of any viewer, highlighted some of the greatest music of the American South. This Southern style echoes across into True Detective setting the mood for the damp, swampy conditions of Louisiana.
True Detective brings a story that strays away from the stereotype of the typical hero. Following through the episodes, your loyalty to characters moves from Rust to Marty and back as they display the flaws and strengths of their contrasting characters. Both the characters actions skirt the line of ideals about law and morality. Their struggle to find the balance--as they resort to unorthodox ideas and methods to come out on top--provides the conflict in their quest to take down a murderous serial killer. The anti-hero angle compels the viewer to find the moral obscurity within himself or herself to support the characters actions as they pursue their final factory over evil.
True Detectives provides the thrill and suspense of any detective drama TV show. However, by straying away from the knight-in-shining armor victory at the end, the viewer comes away from the episodes with the same existential questions as Rust. Reality lacks the black and white of current fiction, but True Detective helps the viewer discern the gray area between good and evil.",1410739200,,3051,5.114228456913827

6216220,4,B00HUCF420,"This was a very good show; I liked it. It isn't as good as two of my favorite shows, Hannibal and The Walking Dead, but it is still very good. I admit I only watched this because I have a crush on Matthew McConaughey, and he was just as amazing as ever, both in performance and looks, but the acting by both him and Harrelson was phenomenal. The scenery was amazing and the case itself was eerie, interesting and dark. Great. Writing was also good.

The only thing I HATED was the disgusting female nudity. Is that really necessary? All the other shows I like manage to keep it clean and still manage to be successful. It was just really gross for me and I don't think it was necessary. This is why I am wary of HBO programming.

With that being said, I will not be watching the later seasons, mostly because of lack of Matthew, but also because of my aforementioned dislikes you expect from HBO programming. BUT another thing is this particular season was so good, and the acting and writing and case itself was so good, as well as the chemistry between the actors, that I feel this show will have a hard time surpassing this season in later seasons.",1410393600,,1151,4.373831775700935

6216223,1,B00HUCF420,"Compare True Detective to the Spanish film ""Marshlands"", about girls disappearing, two detectives investigating the case through the countryside....it's gripping, classy, paced over only 2 hours. It's a 5-star production.
This series is an example of Executive Producers Employing Themselves....woefully, and taking hours to get there with abysmal lack of entertainment throughout. We watched it to see if it would get any better. It didn't.
If Harrelson and McConaghey hadn't funded the production, how would these two greatest movie mumblers get this dreadful work?
Witness a boringly mind-numbing script, lack of cohesive plot, and woefully directed acting performances of recent times by actors who have not learned to enunciate or project their voices.
Most of its content was endless musings and navelgazing-type one-sided conversation, ""interview-style"" by these two leads, monologues skirting around not actually saying anything much, whining about futility of life, avoidance of interaction between the two d's who lack engagement with each other and others, more drivel drivel drivel.
If it's a dissertation about life, it doesn't work because it's trying to be a drama story..
If it's a drama series it doesn't work because its combined with a dissertation about the lives of the two d's miserable lives, the murder investigation seems secondary to that.
Thrillers or social commentaries usually work best by being one thing or the other. This didn't work on various levels, but the actors produced it, paid themselves, and presumably profited by the experience or the income or both, in which case, pat on the back and high-fives, they'll probably feel justified to make a sequel, which usually happens. As Entertainment, it failed. But maybe they've grown as actors, we can only hope.",1410307200,,1797,5.421428571428572

6216242,2,B00HUCF420,"With all the hype, I was hopeful for a series worthy of Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey, but after four episodes it seemed simply a vehicle for McConaughy and Harrelson to show just how seriously they can take themselves.  Since ""Killer Joe"" I gained tremendous respect for McConaughy as an actor and confirmed in Dallas Buyers Club. Same with Harrelson's amazing career from ""Natural Born Killers"" through ""Flint"" and ""No Country.."" For me, by episode four they both are just tiresome. The series seems to goes out of its way to be weird for weirdness sake, without the humanity, depth or pace of ""Fargo"" or ""Breaking Bad"".

 This is a show that gives us character development of a high level and a storyline that keeps us engaged. It is a slow unfolding of the investigation into a murder that is very non-linear in the telling. Touching on a variety of philosophies about life and religion that are almost never seen in a more conventional cop show. I like how much of the dialogue are lies or half-truths and it takes a long time to see how/why this happens.

 Highly recommended if you like a story that requires your full attention. The soundtrack is near perfect with it's mix of old time gospel and modern tracks.

 My only complaint is that the audio commentary is poor. There are frequently long gaps between hearing what Pizzalato and T Bone Burnett say as the story unfolds. What is said is frequently of minimal value. Not the worst commentary tracks recorded but I hoped for better.",1409788800,,1000,4.621468926553672

6216329,5,B00HUCF420,"True Detective follows CID detectives Marty Hart (Harrelson) and Rustin Cohle (McConaughey) in 1995 as they investigate a macabre murder that turns into a hunt for evil. But, 17 years after the case was closed, a new case similar to the '95 case is opened and the two detectives help by telling their story, and how the one case affected their lives forever.

I won't go into a deep analysis, since many have done bits and pieces already, but i'll speak my voice about the overall effect.

True Detective, with just its first season, is one of the greatest television shows ever created. Whether it's through the outstanding acting of not just the leads but through some powerful supporting roles, the mind-blowing direction that puts the show on par with some of the greatest movies in cinema, or even the atmospheric score from T Bone Burnett that helps create the real tension, drama and horror depicted on-screen. Never before have I seen anything of this caliber, and I honestly have no idea how any season following the first can top the perfection that season one brought. With a mere eight episodes, one might think that's not enough, considering most HBO shows are 10-episode seasons, but honestly, it could have neither been longer nor shorter. Some scenes might have been extended by a few precious seconds, but everything about the show, about every episode, just spoke brilliance. Even though this time of show is not for everyone (it's dark, violent, disturbing and graphic), it is still some of the greatest. A must-see and a must-own; a psychological thriller that will go down in cinematic history.",1409616000,3,1615,4.890510948905109

6216363,3,B00HUCF420,"Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson team up to play true detectives in a very bleak Louisiana landscape.  Woody, amusingly enough, plays a rather traditional kind of cop with some time out for naughtiness while Matthew plays a loner, existential thinker.  They are reliving the time they worked together on a ritualistic murder case for two other cops years later. There are flashbacks - long ones - while they are narrating their recollections of the case.

As one Brown University literature professor noted: how different we are at different times of our CV.  These two actors almost play two different characters each as their older and younger selves.  Matthew's transformation is the most remarkable.  Dialogue is interesting - the series is slow moving, as it matches the pace of Louisiana in this rural area.  Would say this Season 1 is equally character-driven as plot driven.  The eight episodes allow depth of character development which is difficult to achieve in the usual 90-minute films.  If you like dark, bleak, Southern crime with great acting and dialogue, sample this.  Watch it after the kids are in bed as there is nudity, lots of violence, depraved crime scenes and abundant swearing.

We are asked to rate these on how much we enjoyed the product.  I appreciated the fine acting, setting, etc., I just found the violence, swearing and nudity too much for my taste.  I thought it detracted from the series.  But that is subjective.",1409356800,5,1458,4.995850622406639

6216376,2,B00HUCF420,"I don't believe the majority of these 5-star ratings, very suspicious. Few things in one's life truly merit a five star rating.

Two hens cackling is how I would describe the majority of this series. Referring to Matthew McConaughey as Detective Rust Cohle and Woody Harrelson as Detective Marty Hart.

The main cackling being done by McConaughey's character Cohle.  A lot and (and I mean A LOT) of his endless stupid banter of useless/pointless views of the world as believed by the character Cohle.  The series establishing that he is a smart detective with a warped view of the world, should not be dragged like molasses through a majority of the 6 of the 8 episodes.  You could have established that in 5 minutes tops.  The stupid ramblings/banter of Cohle's personal opinions goes on and on through each episode (mainly in flashbacks.)  The viewer is forced to sit through and listen to his crap. The writing for the Cohle character almost made me turn off this show countless times. Even Detective Hart was sick of listening to him as he tell us.

While Woody Harrelson as Detective Marty Hart did a lot of counter-point cackling when speaking to Detective Cohle; his own world revolved around his family and how he caused them hurt with his ways. This was probably Woody's best performance as an actor.  He even had an amazingly good wig in flashbacks.

Still the two detectives don't convince me as a viewer of any intelligence between them to solve a crime.  If this was real, I think they would both have trouble learning how to make change for a dollar.

Anyway having said all this, the crime story does seem to take a back seat to the personal lives of Detective Hart and the cackling of crap from Detective Cohle.

The crime story starts promising; a young girl murdered and tied up in the woods, but fizzles as the series starts to dwell deeply into the cacklings of the shows two main hens.

Episodes 7 & 8 finally have the two mains stars concentrating on the shows main story which is attempting to solve the crime. In these episodes (mainly episode 8) McConaughey (as Cohle) finally stops cackling and steps up to the plate as a man should and gives a good performance.  Harrelson was good throughout the series.

Nudity, sexual situation and occasional cursing throughout.

Conclusion; I give it a big thumbs down. Two much pointless, mindless cackling from McConaughey (and some from Harrelson) and a crime story that never excels nor is fully explained make this a less than mediocre series.",1409356800,11,2513,4.740229885057471

I'm not sure of a review is just to provide potential viewers with information to decide on whether to watch something or to exchange ideas with others who have seen a movie/show.  I felt like Rust's dialogue was somewhat over the top even if he is in Mensa.  The ending seemed way too feel good for such a dark movie (spoiler...especially since I understand that these characters are not coming back).

Again for me, having 8 episodes for one basic plot is like watching a quadrilogy....I don't want to watch 23 episodes to get to a resolution, but 8, 10 or 12 works.

There is not a lot of blood and guts in the show, but the topic is very dark and the depiction of the swamps/bayou of La is truly depressing.",1409097600,,961,4.365168539325842

6216442,5,B00HUCF420,"A very interesting mini-series taking place in New Orleans and Louisiana.

A recent and very disturbing crime, hardly described actually, sends two cops in today's world back into the past and a similar crime that is described with more detail, though not too much, and especially the two ex-cops who dealt with the crime at the time in 1995 or so. The crime got a solution. In fact a solution was found and the spectacular crime was not repeated but the deeper crime which was the abduction and disappearance of children was never examined in depth because of a blocking element in the family circle of the governor and one of his relative, nephew or whatever, who was a preacher and who had a whole network of religious institutions dealing with the education of children, and yet any piece of inquiry was leading that way, to these institutions, particularly one that was closed after some kind of hushed up scandal.

The two cops who dealt with that older case are both out of the police force and they become, particularly one, suspects or persons of interest for the two modern time cops.

The investigation of the two modernistic cops will lead nowhere. They actually will come across one of the people in the case but they will not know the difference between right and left (or wrong as for that) nor back and front.

The two ex-cop turned private investigators will come to a real solution this time, some kind of a closure but the solution will not be satisfactory because the political and religious establishment in New Orleans will accept you arresting in a way or another one or two of the members of the grass and roots monstrous army that practices children abduction as a sport and entertainment for further games and distractions but not higher than that.

The happy abducted children end up soliciting in New Orleans. The unhappy ones end up being live toys for some adults whose minds are so perverted that the captive will end up in small pieces but death will only ensue long, long, long after the beginning of the live slicing up and live cutting off and live extracting of this or that organ.

The mini-series remains very prudent as for graphic exposure of this violence and torture. The main interest is the effect of it onto the two cops who originally started investigating the case and will bring it so some kind of a satisfactory though partial solution. As one of the two will say: ""You can never get them all."" He should have added ""You can never get the big fish in such cases."" And you must get yourself satisfied by the fact the big fish authorizes you to take the minnows, their minnows. It is true one minnow down, ten minnows up. Volunteering in this field of human monstrosity is the most common element you can imagine.

6216459,3,B00HUCF420,"Something went wrong in episode six that sent this previously mesmerizing series into a tailspin, from which it never recovered.  We find out all the wrong things about Cohle and Marty, as Maggie gets to tell her side of the story.  The sexual tension between Cohle and Maggie was strong but the story functioned much better leaving this on the fringe.  In episode 6, it all played out to disastrous effect, leaving only two episodes to try to tie together a very complex tale.

I was beginning to think that Nick Pizzolatto had decided to extend this series for a second season, and would tell us more about Maggie's familial connections, which appeared tied into the incestuous Louisiana hamlet with its Tuttles and Childresses.  But, it seems all this Southern Gothic intrigue was just background for a cop buddy movie played out over 8 installments.  Granted, Harrelson and McConaughey made for a very engaging pair that kept my attention throughout.  However, Cohle's cosmological view had become pretty hard to swallow, even in the form of beer cans.

I didn't mind so much this being a man's story.  After all, the mini-series takes its title from pulp fiction magazines of the 30s.  Pizzolatto tried to explore the dark side, hinting at the supernatural but leaving his story grounded in the dark nature of the human beast.  He weaves his tale around child abductions in the bayou parishes of Lousiana, dating back decades, with Cohle mourning the loss of his daughter and seeking redemption by solving the case.  He reminded me a bit of Mulder from X-Files, who was forever searching for his lost young sister, but unfortunately is utterly humorless.  Marty found himself stuck with his morose partner, whether he liked it or not, but this uneasy friendship was finally put the test in episode 6, only for the two to come back together in the present day when investigators decided to reopen the case.

The story is told retrospectively in two distinct time frames, culminating in the present.  Cohle had left the force.  Marty had moved up the ranks, although he left a tattered past behind him. The two represented the opposite extremes.  From their contrasting views, a single narrative emerges that focuses on an obscure tale of a ""Yellow King,"" which will have you looking up Chambers and Lovecraft for naught.  If you want to solve this case before the end, look closely at the minor characters, in them lies the mystery behind the story.

It doesn't really matter because it seems Pizzolatto was more interested in the two personalities he established in Cohle and Marty, and how they come together to solve the case.  I have to think that pulling in two A-listers forced him to tighten his story, as he couldn't expect them to stay around for a second season.  Best just to sit back and enjoy the ride, as Woody and Matthew play well off each other, as you would expect.",1409011200,15,2887,4.791919191919192

The material isn't amazing (IMHO ""Breaking Bad"" was much better written) but it is pretty good.

Even moreso considering this release was teased by a clip of Rust's breakup with girlfriend Lori that was later pulled from the internet by HBO. The director has also made reference in interviews teasing the release about other cut scenes involving Cole, Hart, and Hart's family.

For a season that left so many questions unanswered and has so many fans wanting to know more, including only an extended sermon scene and a block of aerial Louisiana footage is almost a slap in the face.

6216490,5,B00HUCF420,The quality of this show was superb! It is like a very good movie but split into eight episodes. The story begins in 2012 with Detectives Marty Hart (Woody Harrelson) and Rust Cohle (Matthew McConaughey) being interviewed as they recall a ritualistic killing back in 1995 with similarities to a present case. Many women and children have gone missing over the years and Rust Cohle suspects the real killer was never caught. This story is very dark not only with the ghastly murders but also these two Detectives battle their own inner demons. Just like with a good page turner book I had to keep watching until the end which meant a late night. Very well done! Excellent acting too!,1408752000,,682,4.691666666666666

6216492,5,B00HUCF420,"The cinematography, the story line, the acting, the characters are ALL top notch! I like that it actually takes place over a course of 15 years(?), so it's not like other shows where the case is solved within a month or two during the course of the season. It's dark and gritty. I'd compare it a LITTLE to The Killing in its use of atmosphere and environment to create a mood and feel for the location the story takes place. In this case, it's rural Louisiana. I've heard the next season is going to be with different characters and different location, a la American Horror Story, which right there keeps me interested. The anthology type tv show has been long gone but thanks to AHS and True Detective, they're making a comeback and in a great way. Check it out!",1408752000,,763,4.457142857142857

Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey are simply brilliant in this first season of True Detective. The writing is some of the best I have ever seen on television. I put this show up there with The Wire, Breaking Bad and The Sopranos. It truly is a shame they aren't having the same actors back for the second season.

6216516,5,B00HUCF420,"True Detectives is really a great mix of great writing, outstanding performances by two gifted; actors that originally I just could not see the two of them together in anything. Matthew McConaughey's character is dark, analytical, cynical and styled. Woody Harrelson's character is lively, comical, straight forward and just a mess and doesn't see it in himself. The two characters really do not like each other..., or do they? Admiration maybe, but two characters work. The sarcasm and humor come off very natural, as if there was no script.

The cinema photography is gritty and dark; totally sets the tone for the show. HBO usually has really outstanding TV programming and True Detectives is a case in point. I look forward to each episode, although I did purchase this series; I'm pacing myself. It would be easy to over do it and watch every episode back to back..., but as they say; anything good comes in moderation.

But why in the hell does disc 1 only have 3 episodes? Same for disc 2. Disc 3 has a whopping 2 episodes and the bonus features. I'll tell you why, it's so they can charge for 3 discs instead of 1. You don't need to be a true detective to understand that blu ray can easily fit all those episodes on one disc and probably the bonus features as well. I wouldn't mind so much if it was a 2 disc set so I didn't have to get up and change the damn discs out. Only positive side is a pee break, but even then that's what pause is for.

His range as an actor has recently been highlighted; and in my opinion, cements his star with the likes of James Stewart. There is nothing typical about this series! With only eight episodes, and a brand new cast for season two, I can only lament that the producers didn't use the format of American Horror Story to recycle the cast with brand new story lines that satisfy the fan's appetite for the dynamic duo of Harrelson and McConaughey! I, for one, was left wanting more. True Detective highlights the fact that this is truly the golden age of television! I definitely recommend this show!",1408406400,,751,4.7846153846153845

The DVDs don't load right away, I had to restart four or five times to get to the episode list. The DVDs freeze and skip, and are without sound for  minutes at a time. They are terrible quality, and are full of Chinese characters at the ends of the episodes. I can't believe what a s*** product this is.

What is boring about it all is how long you have to wait for anything to happen.  The whole story moves at a snails pace because so much time is spent with two separate interviews with the two detectives.  Two FBI agents ask tons of questions about a case that happened years before.  Way too much time is spent going nowhere.

6216682,4,B00HUCF420,"The opening episodes are brilliant, particularly in terms of character study.  But, as with many in the action thriller genre, the plot imperative works counter to character.  In other words, where the emphasis falls on plot, character is diminished; where it falls on character, plot suffers, retreats into the background.  Ultimately, given the genre, plot has to dominate, and it is in the closing episodes that the series is least successful.  The final episode reinforces stigmatypes, descends into corny sensationalism, and issues in a drawn-out sentimental denouement that does nothing but restore platitudes comforting to the status quo.  The potential of this series really to operate as a lens upon the sordid corruption upon which America in reality thrives is hamstrung by the formulaic demands of an essentially conservative popular culture.",1407715200,,854,5.488549618320611

But from the opening moments of the first episode to the final moments of the last, I realized I was watching something special. Both actors deserve to win an Emmy. Both deliver incredibly high-level performances, although I Have a feeling McConaughey will win and is well deserved. And that Michelle Monaghan was not even nominated is a crime. She is equally brilliant. The story itself often times seems secondary to the performances but it is never far away.
Some won't be satisfied by the ending but it found it immensely powerful and very moving. Again, thanks to the searing performances.
It is violent but not as violent as it could have been. There are some sex scenes. The language is appropriately harsh. The characters are flawed and real. This is not a story that ties up neatly in the end. Even as it ends on an optimistic note by McConaughey's character, there is a strong feeling of uneasiness.
I can say without any doubt this is the finest 'cop' tv show I have seen, even if it is only 8 episodes. I don't care. It is mesmerizing.",1407283200,6,1138,4.638613861386139

But in some ways I thought the character that carried the story was Michelle Monaghan's Maggie. Playing the often-wronged wife, she approached it without stereotypical shrillness. I thought that in the latter episodes the plot became a bit formulaic. But overall it's an entertaining ride.",1407283200,,540,5.679012345679013

On top of all this, the mastermind villain at the end is memorable, a proper level of evil above his minions.

6216735,4,B00HUCF420,"Many others here have done a nice job of summarizing the basic story, so I won't repeat that. Instead, I will attempt to explain why I think this is a superior crime series and well worth watching. I have to admit that, when I realized that it was another serial killer drama, I was a bit put off. We have so many of these, and I have never been one to enjoy films or stories involving the horrible things that people do to one another. But this series is different, in many ways. Right from the very first shot, an indistinct close-up of a dark figure, which could have been an animal, moving through a field, at night, followed immediately by a distance shot of a huge fire in that field, I was intrigued.
The focus of the entire show is the relationship between the two Louisiana State Police detectives, Martin Hart (Harrelson) and Rustin Cohle (McConaughey). They are like oil and water; Hart is married to a beautiful woman, has a nice house and two wonderful little girls. The thin, intense, ascetic Cohle is single and lives like a monk, in a motel/apartment with no furniture. Hart is outgoing, is well-liked, on his way up in the force, is a good old ex-jock, likes to have fun and to drink and hang with the guys; Cohle has no friends, does not drink, does not even smile, and is laser-focused on his job. While you could imagine Hart having a weekend cookout of beer and brats with friends, conversely you would see Cohle spending his off-time reading police and psychology textbooks. Thus we immediately see the differences in these two men, and, in my opinion, the best scenes in the series are those with the two simply conversing with one another. The writing of the dialogue between the two men is absolutely wonderful and so revealing of their natures; I would not be surprised if some of those great lines someday become part of the film lexicon. Example: Cohle sums up his own taciturn inscrutability and depressive nature by saying that he--Cohle--""is not good at parties"". Hart's reaction is memorable: ""Hey, let me tell you something! You aren't so good outside of parties either!"" The cerebral Cohle is prone to uttering judgmental pronouncements and making esoteric, philosophical observations, or quoting obscure texts, all of which baffle and frustrate Hart, who says, ""Let's just agree on another thing, OK? Just quit saying all that weird sh*t! No one else around here thinks like that....I don't think like that!"" Later, at a bar, Hart expresses his profound disillusionment and frustration with the maddeningly obtuse Cohle by saying: ""Every time I think you've reached the limit you set the bar even higher. You are like the Michael Jordan of being a SOB!"" There is a wonderfully caustic and sarcastic conversation the two have at the revival tent, with the pragmatic and analytical Cohle ridiculing virtually the entire Southern Baptist denomination. But in the course of the series, we begin to see similarities between the two men, and they end up, back in the current day, years later, getting back together and becoming an even more effective team.

Basically their time together in the State Police is revealed to us in flashbacks, in 1995; the 'current day' interviews are intended to be seventeen years later, in 2012. McConaughey appears to have done some of his weight fluctuation miracles in this series as well. In the flashbacks to that first murder in '95, he is razor-thin and very corporate-looking. His bartender of 2012 is pony-tailed, heavier, much more world-weary, but still intense, on a mission to complete an unfinished job. Often when we have two strong actors together in a top-notch film or series, it is interesting to imagine how each would do in the opposite role. Here, it is simply impossible to see McConaughey in the Hart role, or to see Harrelson playing Cohle. I would go further and suggest that this might be The Role that McConaughey was born to play, he is that good! The current-day scenes of him in the interview, the way he smoked, drinking the large cans of Lone Star, cutting the cans and molding them into figures, that Southern drawl, the laconic delivery, the way he requested the beer, and then blew the twenty dollar bill across the table. The singular, superbly developed delivery of his lines and his body language were just amazing to watch.

HBO frequently uses actors from other HBO series in smaller roles, and they did it here. The first boss is played by Kevin Dunn, who appeared in Luck, the ill-fated, abortive horse racing series. To me he is more of an eastern, NY-type guy, but he does fine here playing a Louisiana police official (which does not necessarily mean that he is from the South!). Yet another Atlantic coast-type, urban, Italian-ish actor is Paul Ben-Victor, playing the guys' second boss, who was also in The Wire (playing a Greek gangster). But we save the best for last: the part of the revival tent preacher is played by Shea Whigham, who is so effective as Nucky's brother Eli, in the ongoing Boardwalk Empire. What Whigham does in that small role is truly wonderful. His speech, his mannerisms, his delivery of that fantastically great dialogue, are all superb.

Be sure to watch the Inside the Episode comments, after each episode, for insights from the writer and director, two young men who have talent way beyond their years.

To me, what sustains the high level of tension and interest in the series over eight episodes--besides the 'solving of the crimes', of course--is the absolutely riveting dialogue, the magnificently nuanced acting and the endlessly interesting character evolution of those two men, Hart and Cohle.
Talk about setting a high bar: due to this most auspicious of debuts, it will be very, very difficult to make Season 2 of this series the equal of Season 1.

6216737,4,B00HUCF420,"This ain't your daddy's police story.  To describe these two guys as flawed would be an understatement.  Here we have partners who are as different as it is possible to be who require a whole season to find that they work together nicely.  My only problem with this series is I was a little slow in determining what the timeline was.  I kept seeing a well kept person who suddenly is long haired, gaunt faced guy whose only interest (apparently) was drinking and quietly ranting in contrast with this well dressed very well put together cop who was determined to complete some case whose outer dimensions are unclear.  Maybe it is this unconventional aspect of the show that caused me to hurry back to see where it goes next.  Now my only question is when do we see season 2.",1407283200,,775,4.5

I felt like I needed a shower after watching it; just about as sleazy a theme as the characters portraying some of these people.  I just decided for my own personal well-being, I didn't need to watch any more.

6216848,5,B00HUCF420,"Existing somewhere in between ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Seven,"" HBO's ""True Detective"" lies unparalleled to anything aired on television by feeling cinematic. A series of eight episodes, each written and directed by the same team (Nic Pizzolatto and Cary Fukunaga), ""True Detective"" tells the sprawling, 17-year-long tale of two detectives, Rust Cohle (Matthew McConaughey) and Martin Hart (Woody Harrelson), whose lives become engrossed in apprehending an impossibly allusive, ritualistic serial killer in Louisiana.

 What elevates this mini series from say ""Criminal Minds"" or ""CSI"" is the scope of its story, scenery, and characters. For instance, the story just isn't set in Louisiana; Louisiana is one of its characters. Eventually, the only thing that becomes more haunting than the case of these murdered girls are the places they're murdered. Primarily, yes, there's one killer in this series, but Louisiana becomes sort of an accomplice: adding dread and nightmare to an atmosphere that act's like the killer's playground.

 Then there are Rust Cohle and Martin Hart. As played by McConaughey, Cohle is a highly intelligent and highly abstract individual whose past has tailored him for the macabre. ""The world needs bad men. They keep the other bad men from the door,"" he says of himself. His partnership with Hart, a full of himself hot-shot with ideas he can't quite live up to (especially when it comes to family) is one of yin and yang. While the two never quite verge on enemies, there's a clear divide between their ideologies that makes their teaming tense, humorous, and necessary for each others' soul.

 The story unfolds from interviews with the detectives and flashbacks to their investigation in '95. What once was solved becomes unsolved as similiar killings resurrect years later. Occasionally, we delve into their private lives (and when we do, Michelle Monaghan is stellar as Harrelson's wife), but mostly we delve into the minds of two men who become so interesting, we almost forget they're in the middle of hunting a serial killer. But then we're reminded, especially in the finale, that there is one and boy is he frightening to behold.

 ""True Detective"" is a dark, engrossing, and character-driven thriller drenched in existential overtones. There are episodes that rely strictly on dialogue (namely the first three), so if you're not into word-heavy drama's, it may take a while for the show to reel you in. From the fourth episode on though, ""True Detective"" is a twisting, gothic rollercoaster ride that's supremely rewarding. Put it this way: after I watched the series on HBO Go in three days, I went out and bought the DVD so that I could lend it out to friends and family who haven't seen it. A ""True Detective"" disciple right here.

This first season of True Detective was an incredible drama, superbly acted, edited and more. The only TV drama that I say has a slight edge on True Detective was The Wire.

Interestingly two of the actors from The Wire had small roles in True Detective.

and this series was nothing like I expected. From its title image, I thought it would be neo-noir: hard-bitten, cynical detectives with an edge who enjoyed giving the bad guys a run for their money. I expected organized crime.
This series was southern gothic on steroids. Matthew McConaughey continues to astonish with the depth of his newfound acting ability. He is amazing in this. And the final 5 minutes of Episode 4 was a jaw dropping feat of technique.

It is one of the most original stories ever done on TV and certainly more than deserves its nomination for an Emmy.  I hope it is possible for both Matt and Woody to jointly win the Emmy for their portrayals since they are both nominated.  It would be very difficult to separate their performances from one another.

6217002,2,B00HUCF420,"This could be an excellent show.  But when HBO signs on for a show, it seems the station's criteria for success requires gratuitous nudity and sex when none is required for the plot.  Additionally, if you enjoy seeing a show which depicts a nude woman, slaughtered and hung up crucifixion style, then perhaps you've got a stronger stomach and creepier sense of entertainment than I.  On the former note, I don't care for programs that depict women in one role, sexual accessory to the story.  On the later, anytime Hollywood successfully produces and earns accolades for shows where women are stripped nude, sexual assaulted, mercilessly slaughtered, and God knows what else, I think we, as a society, might want to reassess what we consider entertainment.  It's a shame.  The dialog is quite well written.  If the writers could have toned down the implied horrific violence towards women and found a more ""palatable"" crime to base the show around perhaps it would have hooked me. I'm not easily scared away by shocking, gritty, and violent shows.  I loved Breaking Bad, Walking Dead, Homeland, etc....but with this one, I didn't get past the second episode.

6217085,5,B00HUCF420,"I can not praise enough the creators of this TV-series.  This 8-episodes dark-crime/mystery/thriller-drama has something for everyone.
It is difficult, really difficult for me to find the right words to describe and in some way even suggest to try to see this series once you get an opportunity, but if you can--I highly advice not to hesitate, because it is totally worth anybody's time.  I was so into it, that after watching the first episode I decided to finish the entire first season in just one morning.  This dark-mystery southern gothic pulls in and it does not let go until the last episode is finished.  Honestly, I did not want this series to end--- it was that good.

I guess, the only comparison that comes to my mind is film Zodiac (2007), the trilogy of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2009), and the TV series Twin Peaks (1990) all mashed together into one.  Furthermore, what makes this series stand out from other TV series nowadays, is that it is about real people with real problems, the two main characters (played by Harrelson and McConaughey) are very real, so real that many of the viewers will probably identify with them.  The music used in this series is just perfect, it has the southern-belt feel to, it can be creepy, uplifting and anything in-between.  Also worth mentioning is the interesting concept of plot which is comprised of two layers, the story is told by both detectives in the current times (year 2012) and it is based on their most important case involving ritualistic murders of young women by a psychotic killer/killers that take place in the mid 1990's.  I do not wish to spoil this series any further, so I will not reveal anything more about the plot...I can not wait to see season two, directed by other film-directors with new cast members.  I just hope season two will live up to its original predecessor from Louisiana.  Enjoy watching this phenomenal series.",1405382400,,1913,4.7492447129909365

6217087,5,B00HUCF420,"This may have a plot spoiler? Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson are amazing in this (WAY too short!) HBO dark crime series! I caught the last two episodes on HBO and became fascinated, but couldn't quite put together the storyline. When I saw that Amazon had the whole season, I purchased it right away and settled down for a marathon. McConaughey-such a wonderful actor who has apparently finally reached his prime-plays an intensely introspective, philosophical, darkly sexy detective who is caught up by his own demons--which appear to be connected to the killing(s) he and his partner are investigating. His partner, Woody Harrelson, who has his own demons-of course-but not being as introspective as McConaughey, and being more of a jerk it appears at first He therefore manages to plod his way through life ignoring the damage he's doing and blaming others for it. They rub each other the wrong way while working together very well as they search for a serial killer no one believes exists. This causes them both great personal losses along the way. By the end of the series they've bonded over the losses they've both had, etc.. all to find this sick, depraved serial killer.  All the actors, the writing are fantastic. The storyline is tense enough to keep you on the edge of your seat. This is an intense and tight show, which I cannot wait to see next season!",1405382400,2,1375,4.826271186440678

The first time you need to watch it for the plot, the second time is when you see all the subtle connections with the depraved killers but the Louisiana politics as well.

6217138,5,B00HUCF420,"One long dark grisly detective Movie.  True Detective is like watching a mystery or suspense thriller/movie without having to wait years for the sequel.  For a TV series, I usually wait for reviews to come out to watch a show, because there are just so many nowadays.  This 8-hour TV Show/movie grips you from the first episode and makes you want to spend the whole day just watching it.  It is a story about two detectives who come together to solve a grisly seemingly ritual serial (believed to be) murder in the Bayous of Louisiana.  It spans several different timelines as we see how the particular case affects these two detectives working on the case, and in their lives as well.  So many smart lines about life in general, delivered perfectly and brilliantly by McConaughey and Harrelson.  Monsters at the end of dreams, life being a neverending circle, life not ending after death, the comparisons between lightness and darkness in people and life, family, drug abuse, cycle of family actions and reactions, cause and effect, religion, politics, poverty, etc.  The cinematography also is excellent.  My husband and I are Criminal Minds fans, and this was very reminiscent of that show, only one story is wrapped up in 8 episodes and spans the time sequence of 17 years.  I am going to have to watch it again with him.  When we finally get to see the killer's world, reminiscent of a Stephen King/or his son Joe Hill villain.

The mood of the series is constantly creepy and it makes excellent use of its locations. BUT, after the first two episodes the story starts meandering and slows down considerably, even covering a boring biker / drug dealer sub plot, until the second to last episode which is a complete information dump I would have like to unfold over the episodes before, cutting of some of the filler instead... I feel like the series' structure of unfolding over several decades was a strength (in terms of character development), but also its biggest disadvantage, as it made it necessary to push the actual solution to the case to the very end. The final episode was, again, very good, but would have been better or more rewarding if the series had built up to it in a different way.

6217165,5,B00HUCF420,"I caught most of episode #3 at a friends house (I don't have access to HBO). This was enough for me to eagerly await the DVD release.
The two characters are extremely well drawn. I found one of the main characters to be quite level-headed, and the other quite warped. I'll let you decide which is which, but my guess is you'll disagree with my choice. Both characters are remarkably flawed but given their jobs, one might expect this. It is unfortunate that, given their profession, people don't expect this from those who protect and serve. But unfortunately we think we should look up to them while ignoring law. There is a line to the affect; We are bad guys because the world needs bad guys to battle the worse guys. That is likely true to some extent, while being terribly unfortunate for those of us who think the police are there to protect them.
Blah, blah, blah.
Some didn't like the way the season ended but I think the writers left it open-ended enough to not worry. There might be many like me who only watch (the violence is just too much, like most ""cable"" shows . . . we all love to watch it while condemning it in society) in order to enjoy a thoughtful perspective never heard in cop shows, or most any other show. Heck, maybe the season ending could prompt a shift form a pessimistic/realist perspective to an optimist/realist perspective. This would be just as gritty but also have a goal and perhaps foundation that doesn't live on the edge of destruction . . . destruction for the main characters as well as the eventual implosion of the series itself.

6217170,5,B00HUCF420,"For all of the hype this show has received, I must admit to being disappointed in the opening trio of episodes.  Whilst the production values are sky high, and the casting of the two main detectives is brilliant, i am finding the show and the consequent story telling rather slow.  The plot is clever, and obviously as you progress through the season we learn what happened to the two detectives investigating the vicious murder and apparent sacrifice of local call girl, but the action and the unwinding of the plot needs to be faster.  Hollywood superstar Matthew McConaughey is brilliant in his role but i have my doubts about how convincing Woody Harrelson is as his partner.  Obviously i cant wait to find out how it all turns out but given the slow start to the season I can't award it full marks.  Unless the ending is gob-smackingly amazing, in which case I will update this review.

----------------------------------

Ok. I was wrong.  I have seen the first six episodes now and must admit to be completely wrong in my initial review.  Yes, the opening two episodes were slow but by e end of episode three, the metaphorical dam holding back the show's flood of brilliant revelations bursts and the viewer sits in front of his television completely transfixed, and finding themselves utterly overwhelmed by what is suddenly revealed.  The show simply reeks atmosphere, both orally and visually, and some of the scenes are breathtakingly beautiful, and, one must say, quintessentially American.  I still don't think Woody is right for his role, despite the fact that he is one of the executive producers!

This is one of the all time great cop shows.  It is a shame season one is so short, but there is so much to see and enjoy there is bound to be clues and hints and events that we missed the first time around.

The 2 African American interviewees seem just as bored as I am with these scenes. Stoic and disinterested, like props. The sad thing is that I'm pretty sure the 2 leads had the most fun with these scenes. To me it weakens the whole show and seems to be a way to pad the whole season with 1 murder case.

Instead what we have here is a cinematically beautiful but ponderously slow investigation of a serial killer in Louisiana.  McConaughey (Rust Cohle) and Harrleson (Martin Hart) are two antagonistic LA State Police detectives on the case.  How this all unfolds is initially through interviews conducted by two current detectives of the now private citizen Cohle and Hart.  Things plod along punctuated by gratuitous graphic scenes of nudity, sex and drug use that do little to advance the narrative.  McConaughey plays a real weirdo, the type of character he seems to be gravitating to these days and Harrleson's mysogynistic bozo will make you wish for the days when he was lovable lug Woody on cheers.  The end is creepy and suspense packed but then the wrap up is just boring and uncomfortable.

6217265,5,B00HUCF420,"What makes this series superb is the feast of startling lines performed by Matthew McConaughey:

--""The world needs bad men.  We keep the other bad men from the door.""

--""This place is like somebody's memory of a town, and the memory is fading.""

--""The newspapers are gonna be tough on you.  And prison is very, very hard on people who hurt kids.  If you get the opportunity, you should kill yourself.

Seeing McConaughey deliver these lines with deadeye sincerity is eerie.  He has created one of the most memorable and truly scary  protagonists in tv history.  (I have to laugh at the reviewers who complained it was too ""dark"" or ""depressing""-- it is a drama about homicide detectives!).

The season isn't perfect.  The beautiful female characters are flat everywhere but physically  :)  More annoying is the ending, which is a little predictable, with a made-to-order serial killer in a spooky house.

But that hardly detracts from its astonishingly great dialogue and acting.  Is there now any doubt that McConaughey is one of the finest actors of his generation?",1404691200,,1070,4.926966292134831

6217318,5,B00HUCF420,"This mini-series is truly amazing, unbelievably well written and the acting just blew me out of the water, more so than even the most decorated theatrical films. Matthew McConaughey: I have never seen him better. In fact, I simply cannot believe how amazingly he pulled off this very difficult role.

The series is very dark. It is about two detectives trying to solve a grisly murder with occult ties in 1995, but it skips forward in time to 2012 where they are each being interviewed about the case by two other cops on a current investigation that ties in with the older, supposedly solved case. What is soooo interesting about this series is that while it is a mystery, it's not really a formula mystery where the last person you suspect ""done it."" It's the journey that these two men take that is the story, and it is a character study about the two of them, mostly at odds, and they annoy each other no end, two very different men within circumstances that eventually force them to face down their worst enemy...their fears...somewhat even embodied in each other. It's that deep.

Woody Harrelson's character Marty struggles with the dark side of his job which creates in him a weakness (or many weaknesses) that make him so insecure it is as if he must fight everything, including his wonderful, beautiful wife, whom he cheats on. His behavior causes him to lose the only bright lights in his life, his wife and two daughters. He is really an awful man, prone to quick, even violent temper, but you begin to see why, and that somewhere deep inside him is good man screaming to be free.

McConaughey's character, Rust, is a complete nihilist after losing his toddler daughter to a car accident. His marriage does not survive it. He has a dark clarity of the world that has him spouting deep dark philosophies as to the meaningless of life...lines that are some of the most amazing writing...but his attitude alienates him from everyone he has ever known or those who might love him. Co-workers and his boss simply decide he's crazy. The two detective partners rub like sandpaper, like each other's bad subconscious self neither wants to look at, and yet they are rather fearless and get things done on this particularly difficult case.

Tiny spoiler: Of course the two main characters get the real guy in the end but at great cost and by the end both men have near simultaneous breakdowns (two tough crazy angry dudes reduced to tears with nothing left in the world but this dark path and this case.) The ending is amazing. I just loved this series as dark and disturbing as it was with tiny little glimmers of light in all the darkness at the end. I still cannot believe the excellence of the writing and the two actor's performances.",1404259200,7,2741,4.6570247933884295

I recently learned that the man who wrote this went to school in my current town. The music  is great and I have listened to a number of songs several times. The opening song fits like a glove. It is the story that has been told so many times and the ultimate topic of light verses dark

The character of Rust is intensely interesting. Though this is fantasy, I would like to know him. It could be that I just have bad taste in men but there are so many redeeming qualities of this character.  I think anyone who enjoys crimes will be surprised at how well this is done.

6217334,5,B00HUCF420,"Television is not dead!

""True Detective"" is the latest evidence of that.

Without a doubt, this show will be held in high regard for years for its superb execution, photography and performances, but above all, for its superb writing.

From the first verse of the theme song at the start of the first episode, to the last line in the closing scene of the finale, no word in ""True Detective"" can fairly be considered fluff or filler. These eight episodes weren't just written, they were crafted by a master storyteller (Nic Pizzolatto) and assembled by an equally talented team of artists. The words. The visuals. The music. The costumes. The locations. The makeup. All the elements required to make great television were carefully combined here to produce a show that deserves a place beside such masterpieces as ""The Sopranos"" and ""Deadwood.""

""True Detective"" is nothing like NCIS, or Law And Order, or any of the other schlock that passes for entertainment on FOX or any of the three big Cs (ABC ... NBC ... CBS). None of the clichs of TV's true-crime genre have a home in the scripts of ""True Detective."" Rather, the words, storyline and characters are all fresh and vivid and plausible.

Every scene moves the story forward without skimping on the development of character. Not a moment of screen time is wasted. Indeed, I found the script to be so rich that I'm eager to watch it again as I'm sure to pick up on details I missed the first time through.

Insensitivity, Part One
by Charles R. Swindoll

Galatians 6:2, 10

My kids pulled a fast one on me one Christmas years ago. They teamed up, pooled their vast financial resources, and bought me a little motto to set on my desk. It was more than cute . . . it was convicting. In bold, black letters it read:

DIETS ARE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE THICK AND TIRED OF IT

At first you thmile . . . then it makes you thad. Especially if you're not thick of being thick!

There's another thickness that's just as bad. We could call it an ""inner thickness."" I'm referring to insensitivity . . . being unaware, out of touch, lacking in insight, failing to pay attention. The Hebrew Scriptures occasionally mention those who are foolish and simple, as in the book of Proverbs (1:2233). The original term means ""thick, dull, sluggish."" It's the picture of mental dullness, one who is virtually blind toward others . . . failing to feel others' feelings, think others' thoughts, sense others' needs.

Professional insensitivity is painfully common. To some physicians you're case number twenty-three today . . . a body, weighing so much . . . a mouth, saying words . . . a gall bladder needing removal.

And how about insensitive teachers or speakers? Talk about painful! A block of information is dumped into your ears from their mouths. Whether it's interesting or well thought through is unimportant. The whole episode is about as memorable as changing a flat.

And have you come across an insensitive salesperson lately? You can feel the thickness. Your exasperation leads to gross impatience . . . and then, finally, confusion. You're not sure if the individual understands only Swahili . . . or is recovering from advanced lockjaw.

Perhaps the most tragic shades of insensitivity occur in the home. Between mates, to begin with. Needs in the heart of a wife long to be discovered by her husband. She hides them until an appropriate moment . . . but it never arrives. He's ""too busy."" What cursed words! ""Other things are more important."" Oh, really? Name one.

A husband wrestles with a matter down deep . . . in the ""combat zone"" of his mind. Lacking perception, the preoccupied wife drives onnever pausing, never looking into his eyes, his soul-gate, reading the signs that spell

I  A-M  H-U-R-T-I-N-G.

Insensitivity is painful. It's damaging to our relationships, and it grieves our God.

To be thick is understandable. To be thick and tired of it is commendable. To be thick and tired of it but unwilling to changeis inexcusable.

6217338,5,B00HUCF420,Creepy and spirtual. This series is highly recommended. The characters are rich and complicated. The detective work is real and thought provoking. And Louisiana is the perfect place for such a story.,1404259200,2,199,5.25

6217340,5,B00HUCF420,Best detective show ever created. Acting was superb,1404259200,,51,5.5
6217341,5,B00HUCF420,"When you've gotten spoiled to exemplary writing such as BREAKING BAD, just about everything else comes as a disappointment.  So I was pleasantly surprised - blown away, actually! - when TRUE DETECTIVE turned out to be such an unrelenting look at the dark side of the human heart - not just with regard to the monsters who commit unspeakable crimes, but with equal regard to the men who investigate those crimes and run the high risk of becoming as lost and damaged as the fiends they are determined to bring to justice.  When the line between the good guys and the bad guys is allowed to blur is when a series goes above and beyond the mundane who-dunnit scripts and takes the viewer on a journey where good and evil become more a matter of perception than comfortable certainty.

Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey seemed to actively BECOME the characters they played until TRUE DETECTIVE often felt more like watching an intimate documentary as opposed to a fictional mini-series.  Both the acting and the writing were top-notch, and if this HBO series doesn't win some Emmys, something's wrong.  The story itself involves a complex murder scene, missing women and children spanning at least 2 decades, and potential involvement of high ranking state officials.  All of this takes place in the grim habitat of the Louisiana bayous, where one never knows if the missing were taken by gators or voudon practitioners using the victims as human sacrifices.

While there is certainly intrigue and tension surrounding the crimes themselves, some of the most notable conflict is between the two main characters - Rust Cohle and Martin Hart (McConaughey and Harrelson).  Whereas Hart is more savvy and at times even defensive of the beliefs and practices of the bayou people, Cohle is one step short of a devout quantum atheist - and the tension between the two characters as a result of their divergent beliefs and backgrounds in what gives the show some of its best moments.

(Spoiler alert) Perhaps one of the most memorable scenes in the show for me was after the two detectives have killed a couple of the bad guys and rescued a young girl who had been brutally abused from the killers' compound.  Cohle says to Hart:  ""I don't want to know anything anymore. This is a world where nothing is solved. Someone once told me, 'Time is a flat circle.' Everything we've ever done or will do, we're gonna do over and over and over again. And that little boy and that little girl, they're gonna be in that room again and again and again forever.""

(End spoiler alert)

From a perspective of quantum mechanics and quantum consciousness, Cohle's horrendously dark statement is true - at least in theory.  If the universe expands and contracts, breathing in and breathing out, the theory is that we live these same lives over and over, even if billions upon billions of years apart.  So to Cohle's way of thinking as he is ""mainlining the truth of the universe"" (a conclusion he has come to in his own dark evolution), even though he has rescued the little girl in the now, she will be in that room to experience that same fate again... and again... because in another of Cohle's observations, ""Death created time to grow the things that it would kill.""

Even though the series is only 8 episodes, it felt complete and whole.  The story is concluded at the end, and the viewer isn't left wanting more - except for wanting more television to reflect this depth of writing, directing, production values and acting.  Another thing that bears mention is the music - particularly the opening theme song, performed by Brett & Rennie Sparks (The Handsome Family).  The song is eerie and haunting just through its sound, but when you dig into the lyrics, you'll find it every bit as uncompromising as the show itself.

Ultimately, TRUE DETECTIVE isn't for the squeamish or for someone just looking for yet another police procedural.  This show goes where others have TRIED to go and flailed.  The ending is no less profound than some of the unforgettable quotes by Cohle which really define the series as the darker side of darkness.

See it!  And be prepared to be haunted by the mood and flavor long after the final credits have rolled.",1404172800,2,4223,4.761316872427984
6217342,5,B00HUCF420,"This show was gripping from minute one. Non stop suspense, by the end you feel your right there with them. Character development and plot are second to none! I would highly recommend watching, and I can assure you will not be disappointed.",1404172800,,239,4.714285714285714

6217344,4,B00HUCF420,"The background effects were very impressive, shot in rural LA amidst all of the squalor and oil field activity-captures the locale very well.  Acting was good but  McConaughey's rants and seemingly incoherent ramblings seemed to be a little over the top and without end.  I did appreciate his acting as in the past roles I thought he was a lightweight-did not see him in the Dallas movie.  The last episode seemed to be rushed and racing to a conclusion but overall the series was entertaining.",1404172800,,494,4.776470588235294
6217345,5,B00HUCF420,"Whoa!! What a ride. I have to say, I was not immediately blown away by this show. When I saw the first preview for True Detectives, it was after an episode of True Blood, I was so stoked. I'm not your typical female who lusts over Matthew, and I am not a fan of his usual Rom-Com films. I do, however, think he and Woody make a phenomenal team, and Matthew definitely excels at the more dramatic roles. I couldn't wait to start this show. When it premiered, I tried SO hard to love it. I even re-watched the pilot the following day, thinking maybe I was too tired the first time. Nope. I just couldn't get into it. I gave it two episodes before I quit. Moved on to something new.

Well, I kept hearing people talk about it. Seeing Facebook posts about it. I personally have a very broad taste in television shows. I definitely find the art in everything I watch. Weird is normal.. That kind of thing. I saw a friends post saying, ""Holy S***. I have never watched anything like this. Best show ever. Awards all around..."" Blah blah blah.. I commented about how bored I was watching it, and I just couldn't get it. He told me to get through episode three, and ""buckle up"".

He was so right.

I just finished this show, June 30. It's been out for months. I regret, SO BAD, not watching it sooner. The story is so eerie, and it effects the viewer in a ""close to home"" sort of way because the case they investigate is all too familiar in the world we live in. The acting. WOW. Matthew was brilliant in Dallas Buyers Club, but this role even surpasses that. Woody is classic Woody. Sort of dumb in a sense, but his character is lovable and hysterical. The two of them together have an undeniable chemistry that I hope they bring back, if not for a second season, for another serious show or film. For the nature of this show, they had some very funny scenes together. I'm sure the friendship they portray in True Detectives is just as it is in their real life friendship. Michelle Monaghan was beautiful as ""Maggie"". They did a truly great job casting this show.

With ALLLL of that being said, I give this show two, BIG thumbs up. HBO, can you do no wrong? Great entertainment that will leave you thinking (not guessing or wondering, thankfully) when it's over. There are so many crime/investigator/cop type shows on television these days.. This one is in a league of it's own! Do it. Now. What are you waiting for?",1404172800,2,2410,4.372767857142857

If you're into shows that 'supposed to be good, so people say it's really good"", then you'll like it.

I was late in the first season when it hit me...this show is dark for the sake of being dark and isn't entertaining nor watchable, Woody does well.
McCona is horrible. Great acting? He plays a drippy character that is so over the top one dimensional. Him pouting and whispering his macabre lines doesn't mean its quality.

The show sucks.",1404086400,8,496,4.561797752808989
6217362,5,B00HUCF420,"Matthew was stunning-best acting I have ever seen from him. Nice to see him stretch his abilities. Content is a bit dark, so be aware. I enjoyed this series thoroughly, have to confess I watched multiple (many!) episodes in a row.",1404086400,,230,4.634146341463414
6217363,5,B00HUCF420,"One of the best TV series to come along in some time. The atmosphere is always dark and menacing, and it's unclear as to the direction the story is going. First-rate acting from both McConnaughey, and Harrelson holds his own. So far I've seen the first 6 episodes. My only disappointment is that the 6th disc has a glitch and skips over part of the story - I can't tell how much. Hopefully the remaining 2 discs will be okay, but I would have expected that new out-of-the-box discs would play perfectly.",1404086400,,503,4.478260869565218

6217365,2,B00HUCF420,"Woody Harrelson is excellent in his role; Mccaughnehey, is, in my opinion, the stereotypical taciturn, 'mysterious', dark crime fighter.

The characters are very well-developed and the plot proceeds very much like real life, as opposed to most which are discovered and solved within either 44 minutes or 120 minutes.  The only drawback to the series, and it's a serious one in my opinion, are the extended sex scenes.  There are two extended ones and one short one, but all are extremely graphic and also gratuitous (not necessary for the plot).  I would have given it a five but for the included perversion.",1403913600,,582,4.732673267326732
6217384,5,B00HUCF420,"I live in Louisiana, New Orleans specifically, and there is pretty much nothing else like it: It's twisting history, depth, danger, and sexuality. There is a high minded progressive ideology that is forever just one drink away from reverting to its baser, animalistic id. There are sometimes places you don't want to go, but they are necessary to find your way home. Very much like this show. I especially like the bleakness of the camera's attitude towards the Wetlands, as if they were alien landscapes; the setting for the Apocalypse. It's very easy to forget what waits just outside your door, off your doorstep, around the corner, down the way.
 I do NOT like crime dramas. They bore. This is not a crime drama. This is something else and in a league of its own. I am very much looking forward to seeing what they do next. Also, having purchased the digital season for a song, as opposed to the blu-ray set which is overpriced for only eight episodes, the streaming option is certainly the better way to go.",1403913600,2,1012,4.653631284916201

Very dark subject matter which is somehow forgivable due to the near-perfect performances and plot. Yes, it is a who-done-it, but not like you've seen before.

Something I noticed, and perhaps it's coincidental: In the next to last episode, Woody Harrelson's character (Marty), is watching TV, and we get a three-second glimpse of what he's watching in the mirror behind him. It's John Ford's The Searchers, starring John Wayne and Jeffrey Hunter (whose name is Marty). Throughout the film the two men, who do not get along, are searching for a kidnapped girl taken by Scar, a Comanche chief. In True Detective, the two men, who do not get along, are searching for the abductor of mostly kids, and they know they're looking for a man with scars.

Harrelson was very believable as a homicide cop sharing his midlife crisis with a repulsive serial murder case. His lost his self control more than once, always creditable fashion and never contrived.

There is absolutely no telling where McConaughey found his character -- partially from the Dallas Buyer's Club? Partially from  Mud? Who knows? Who cares?

Spending so much time with not-very-bright lowlifes, including these cops, wasn't in any way enlightening or enjoyable. On the plus side, I was intrigued by the plot and wanted to see the mystery solved. This series would be much better if there were more focus on action and investigation and less on portentous atmospherics and pretentious philosophizing.

6217417,5,B00HUCF420,"Movies have changed over the years. In their earliest form they depicted the hero as a rough and ready customer who was out to save the world or at least some portion of it. When censorship rules eased up we suddenly had the anti-hero, a person who was flawed to a large extent but who did the right thing in the end, sometimes unwillingly for the right reasons. It seems that these days we have a combination of the two making its way into movies. Such is the case with TRUE DETECTIVE.

TRUE DETECTIVE is a new series on HBO and has just been released on DVD. Word has it that the series will continue with a different story to tell using new characters each season. That bodes well for viewers since it allows some great actors to make their way into stories that take more than 2 hours to tell and gives them free rein to do their best. That happens here with both Woody Harrelson and Mathew McConaughey.

The duo star as Louisiana State Police detectives called in to investigate strange murder. The body of a young woman has been found tied to a tree in the middle of a field, a crown made of antlers on her head, stab wound to her body and strangled. Around the body are tripod type sculptures made of twigs giving it the appearance of a satanic ritual. While the murder forms the center piece of the series, it isn't exactly what the show is about. It's more about the two detectives investigating the murder as well as others that tie into it.

The tale unfolds jumping back and forth in time, from the initial investigation in the late 1990s to a new investigation taking place in 2012. Both Det. Marty Hart (Harrelson) and Det. Rusty Cohle are being interrogated by two current State Police detectives but we have no idea why. These two men are far different than the ones who did the initial investigation. Marty now owns a security company and Rusty, well, no one knows where he's been. As the new detectives question them and get their stories, we learn what happened. By episode five all of that changes and suddenly we're caught up and trying to find out just how much was real and why things went the way they did.

Marty is a pretty straight forward type detective. He covers the scene, looks for clues and runs the evidence with the hope of catching the killer. We get glimpses of Marty as a stand up family man who in reality has a girlfriend on the side. He loves his family and yet finds himself often arguing with his wife instead of being there for them. This is the flawed hero, a man who wants to do what is right yet continues to make mistakes that affect all around him.

Rusty handles things in a more unusual way. Prone to offering philosophic quotes and metaphysical observations on the world, he views things his own way. We get the idea that this stems from his years as an undercover agent investigating drug rings which led to usage of their product. But it's not just that. There is much more to Rusty than drugs or alcohol. His family past is troubled to say the least and the time undercover did take its toll. But Rusty is the one of the pair that truly wants to find the truth. His search for the truth is what pushes them forward in the past and in the present.

The film depicts the boys of the south as both sophisticated in some instances and backwoods yokels at other times. Neither one is condescending to the south and appears to represent the various extremes of one end to the other well. There are people that fit both of these types. The thing is discovering which ones are the truly terrible and which are honest. Don't be surprised to find that members of both classes fit both good and bad.

The thing that makes this series work though is a combination of elements that blend together to perfection. The work of both leads is fantastic with an unwrapping of layer after layer of their personalities that gives us a glimpse into who they are. Those glimpses give us a depth of character that a 2 hour film would not allow. Both actors are up to the task and turn in great performances.

The direction and storytelling are above par as well. The story unfolds in time, moving along at a snails pace but never feeling like it is. Instead it allows the story to percolate to a boil by the end episode. We get a few clues here and there that allow us to perhaps figure out the result, but never so intrusive as to harm the story being told. And in a world where there are not always black and white heroes and villains, this movie offers us a chance to see those grays come into focus to give us those two distinct colors (or lack of) when depicting the detectives and the killer. No poor victim murderer is found here. Instead there is pure evil. The way that is put together here makes for a great series.

Not having HBO this makes me look forward to their next season and its release on DVD. Perhaps it's better to watch something like this binge fashion where you get the opportunity to watch from start to finish. If you wondered, yes it does include the usual requirement for a made for pay cable series i.e. gratuitous nudity. But if you can get past that you're in for a treat when watching this, if for nothing else than the performance of both lead actors. This one is worth watching.",1403654400,,5244,4.386831275720165
6217418,5,B00HUCF420,"I loved the interplay between the two main characters especially the way that the relationship is based around a mutual loathing and tolerance for one another as partners. It was a different way of portraying the 'buddy relationship' as far as cop dramas go.
The storywriting is original and fresh the plot lines drawn from old weird fiction books and modern suburban decay.
Drugs, alcohol, prostitutes, cheating, lying, stealing ... all in a days work on this beat.
Something about this show just sucked me right in I can only beg you to give it a chance. Some of the best dramatic acting I've seen in a long time. Great soundtrack, too when you can hear the music bubbling up in the background.
Do you know Carcosa? You will soon.

update 6/27/14 - Bonus Good parts : Deleted scene with the Preacher, Conversation w/ TBone and Nic, Commentary for Episode 5 and the Making of True Detective.
Honestly, the rest of the special features (deleted scenes,  Up Close, Inside Episodes )are practically worthless in my opinion. Most are really short only a matter of minutes, one commentary is scattered and short another deleted scene is just terra firma footage. I was hoping for a lot more with only 8 episodes in the whole series and HBO charging full price for this set that doesn't even come with DVD's included. Even the Simpsons series provides storyboards and commentary for every episode. In short, buy this for the series since it is terrific not for the bonus stuff.

6217455,5,B00HUCF420,"In this strange new world where TV series are actually good enough to be considered high art, alongside literature and cinema, I was not immediately thrilled about a new cop show named 'True Detective'. Although arguably the greatest series of all time, 'The Wire', could be labelled a 'cop show', and there have been some very good police dramas through the years, why bother? Enough with the cops, already... more Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, Rome, Boardwalk Empire, The Walking Dead, The Pacific, American Horror Story-type unexpectedness. Except... the writers of True Detective knew there was still some crazy, unexpected storytelling left in the good old Homicide. It uses a multi-layered narrative technique that weaves together events surrounding a murder investigation in the mid-90's and present-day interviews of the two investigating detectives, played by Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson, conducted by two younger detectives who are interested in these past events for reasons they are unwilling to share. Both Harrelson and McConaughey give absolutely brilliant performances, but McConaughey gets the standout role with 'Rust' Cohle, a former deep-undercover agent with blood on his hands (Looking gaunt and slightly emaciated, likely related to the weight-cut he endured to play an AIDS-sufferer in 'The Dallas Buyers Club', it fits perfectly with Cohle's monk-like psychic self-flagellation, and his hollowed-out features contribute to his haunted, thousand-yard-stare -- through which he communicates the numbness, the emptiness his character has traded for the agony that would consume him if he allowed himself to feel). He also has the death of his young daughter and his failed marriage haunting him, for which he self-prescribes various opiates and benzodiazepines. He feels compelled to bombard his partner and anyone else with his own acidic brand of existential nihilism, when he's compelled to speak at all. This, of course, does not go down well with his brothers in blue, and his partner, Marty Hart (played by Harrelson), finds himself forced to defend a cop he doesn't like. Hart is a family man, with a loving wife and daughter, but keeps a girlfriend on the side, a situation threatening to blow up in his face. As the two men get deeper into their investigation of a young woman murdered in a manner that suggests pagan ritual, with Lovecraftian themes and recurring symbols, Hart begins to appreciate Cohle's gifts as a detective, and an uneasy friendship starts to develop from that, until everything goes straight to hell... It is only when the tale loops back to the present that any kind of resolution can be found. The writing, by Nic Pizzolatto, and direction, by Cary Fukunaga, is brilliant throughout the season. Unlike most shows, both men handled writing and directing duties for every episode, which likely helped make it such a clear and distinctive vision. I can only hope that next season comes close to accomplishing what this one did.",1403481600,2,2993,5.2635983263598325

6217458,4,B00HUCF420,"I didn't have many doubts that this show would be very good with the pairing of the very talented Harrelson and McConaughey as the two lead detectives in the ritualistic murder of a young woman.
The show is very dark and moody as it reveals the the killers motive and mindset behind the killings and the relationship  that develops between Rust (McConaughey) and Marty (Harrelson) as they work the case.
The show is based on a standard type of formula used for many of the cops shows out in TV Land. It starts with two polar opposite cops that are partnered up to solve a high profile case with one being a family man (Marty) and the other a loaner (Rust) that not only struggle with solving the case , but with each others ideals, beliefs, logic and so on.
This formula works quite well with these two great actors and when you add the very good writing and direction to the mix you have a winner of a show that will keep people glued to their seats watching and waiting to see what will happen next.
If you are looking for fast paced non stop action you would be better served elsewhere because this is more of a controlled or slower  paced story.
The show is kind of an experiment in that it was told in only eight episodes (more like an extended mini series) and that next season will be set in California with one or two female leads and be based on a different story that will be occult related. I must confess that when I read that next season would return without Rust and Marty that I wondered ""Why did I spend my time getting to know these characters when I wouldn't see them again""???  I fell a little betrayed or mislead.
This is a good show, but will season two be as effective/good with a different cast and storyline?  Will people return when they find out they have been duped? Will Rust and Marty ever return to finish their work? Tune in next season for the answer.
The show has a fair amount of nudity and sex scenes mixed with violence and cursing including the f...word. So its not for the kiddies.

6217474,5,B00HUCF420,"1995.  Detectives Rust Cohle (Matthew McConaughey) and Marty Hart (Woody Harrelson) are called in to investigate a murder.  A girl's body has been found in the Louisiana cane fields, bound, with heavy religious and occult overtones.  The two detectives don't necessarily get along; Cohle is a borderline suicidal nihilist, and Hart is arrogant and a hypocrite.  But the two pair together to hunt their man.  Seventeen years later, another body is found, and Cohle and Hart are forced to relive the case, and the tangled mess that was their partnership.

TRUE DETECTIVE is a truly brilliant show.  It starts with the performances: McConaughey is a stunner (this performance is among the highlight reel of his career comeback), and Harrelson slow-burns his way through his characters complexities.  Of the supporting cast, Michelle Monaghan shines as Hart's wife, and it's always nice to see Shea Whigham pop up (here as a revivalist).  But the performances wouldn't mean much if not for the script and directing--both the same for all eight episodes, which helps the story seem complete and unstilted, even as we jump back and forth between through the years.  Through it all, the setting of rural Louisiana comes through like a third leading man, helping this show cement itself in reality, even as the final couple of episodes pile the facts into a vaguely confusing bundle.  This first season of TRUE DETECTIVE (which stands on its own; I like to think of it as an eight-hour movie) may go down as a classic television experience.  Time will tell on that, but for now, it's safe to say that you aren't going to see a show this good every day.",1403308800,5,1644,4.874100719424461

6217488,3,B00HUCF420,"I would have given True Detective five stars, but it's disturbing on so many levels. The actors are beyond terrific. They are on point constantly. However, the story is not thought-provoking, it's outright horrific. The death of a young woman found in what appears to be a satanic ritual leads the series off. From there it simply gets more and more dark and depressing with the two detectives' lives falling apart as they search for the killer. Obsession becomes the byword and takes over their existence. Years later justifying their actions to two other detectives as they attempt to avoid the truth is almost painful. The ending is not really a surprise, but it's satisfying. I wouldn't say, ""Don't watch it."" But I would say to watch it with caution. And don't let children within 10 miles of it! Now...will we watch the next series of True Detective? Oh, yes. We hear it stars Denzel!

6217505,5,B00HUCF420,"This show gets it right.  I mean, on a cellular level, this show digs down and hits the culture of Southwest and Southcentral Louisiana square on the nose with a lead pipe and knocks it flat.  There is not one single false note about us, not when it describes who we are or in laying out, with the precision of a botantist dismembering a rose mallow, our sins and our virtues both.  It was simultaneously riveting and alarming to sit on my couch with my husband and feel the violence of this series in the hollow of my core.  We know these men, we know these people.  They are all archetypes we have met and lived among our whole lives.  Plot points hung upon variants in our culture that also have a commonality to the whole of human experience, such as the transmittal of teleologically unique belief systems within families, and the narrative progressed logically through events that are at the forefront of our current experiences.

If there were any jarring moments for us, it was in the fact that while this series purports to be set in the Cajun prairie and the Cajun marshes, it was actually mainly filmed around New Orleans and its environs, and we were left scratching our heads at a Golden Triangle in Texas that is apparently devoid of Vietnamese gangs (we managed to justify it to ourselves eventually).  The landscape is similar, but not entirely identical in all respects, but so close as to be virtually indistinguishable, like middle-aged identical twins who live in neighboring towns.

Additionally, Mr. Pizzolatto missed not one opportunity to expound upon any ahorrent series of events that have taken place in recent Louisiana politics, and considering the volume of poor decision making by our current political leaders, that is rather impressive.  There were many side-longs that likely zoomed past the ears of any but those intimately familiar with the more recent events in our fair state but were clearly homilies when heard by those of us with that knowledge.

None of that distracts from the fact that this series is a taut, engrossing deep dive of a story that is engrossing as hell, even if you don't know the culture that it is set in, and can be enjoyed universally.  But, yeah.  They got the surrealness of our culture just right in this one.",1403136000,2,2275,4.729113924050633

6217522,5,B00HUCF420,"A beautifully written series [ By Nic Pizollato] that manages to be  in equal parts enthralling, philosophical and character driven.

The Louisiana settings are moody and atmospheric, both in the countryside which is semitropical and isolated,  and the small  towns which look like dead relics of the near past. The corruption of the landscape mirrors the corruption that is taking place behind the scenes of  normative life which most people  believe constitutes their reality.

A ritual killing with overtones of paganism [voodun and Celtic] sets two detectives on a seventeen year  trajectory which will profoundly alter their lives and shake them to the core of their being. Martin Hart [ Harrelson] is the sort of well liked, affable family man who is grounded in tradition and community, and yet manages to jeopardize everything he values with his penchant for womanizing. Rustin Cohle [ McConaughy ] is a nihilist, divorced from human contact, who finds existence utterly devoid of meaning and believes in nothing. And yet he manages to expound on the human condition  so poetically that one immediately suspects he has suffered a great wound.

The action takes place during three different time periods and focuses as much on the men's lives and driving motivations  as the crimewhich develops in scope and involves many persons in the coastal region.

Both characters are beautifully developed and each has something profoundly different lurking below the surface of the face they present to themselves and the world, which will come to expression in the course of the series. As they wear masksso too do the villains of the storyboth literally and figuratively.

I see some reviewers have criticized the end of the story, but I found it to be spiritually profound and deeply redemptive.  I can't say enough good things about the series without spoiling it, but I couldn't stop watching and went through the episodes in two days. Incredibly well acted and highly, highly recommend.",1403049600,2,1990,5.120743034055727

This is a very complex story, with layer upon layer of detail.  It forces you to watch with a viewpoint to your own belief structure, and challenges you to reconsider your beliefs as the story unfolds.  You simply cannot ignore the depth of thought-provoking dialogue and raw emotion; I found this to be the most brilliant TV script I've ever watched.

As many have noted, all of the acting is first rate and the casting is superb.  What particularly impressed me about this series, though, were the visuals - the location selections and the use of those to compliment the surreal complexity of the thought provoking script.  For me, the visuals offered what seemed like an ultra-realistic peak at those living at the fringe and in the underbelly of civilized society.

6217567,5,B00HUCF420,"This is just one of those shows that comes along less often than it should; The cable dramas have certainly been getting better over the years, whether they are on HBO or AMC(Even NBC's 'Hannibal' is up there to me...); But this show takes something potentially average in terms of subject matter and character traits and turns it upside down, in a good way. Dark and philosophical, this show covers so much ground in it's 8 episodes(#4 is my favorite w/the housing project sequence...); you get a healthy dose of sex, odd characters, and beautiful scenery...all of which is mixed in w/something purely evil. And yes, Woody and Matthew CAN act, and this show is just one more example of how well they work in their craft, esp. when given material this. Even the opening credit sequence is amazing; it is honestly hard to find a flaw here, although I wish the last episode was a little stronger in terms of more explanation and connections to certain events and characters. But still the usual inspired writing and fantastic chemistry across the board, both in front of and in back of the camera. A very nice final confrontation sequence too, and it's done well as you are not sure how it's going to play out.

Also, the scene where Rust is interrogating the girl about her killing her baby, and then after listing a variety of reasons, tells her 'if she gets the chance she should kill herself' before walking out of the room, is pretty 'holy s***' writing and unlike anything I have heard said on any show in a long time; It is much like when he tells the 2 uncooperative men who won't give the detectives directions to a local brothel that 'they got off on the wrong foot' before Russ slams a toolbox against one of the men's heads before beating the other one down(and leaving w/very detailed directions...).

For a show that is so graphic, disturbing, and covers seemingly almost every 'immoral' activity we as a race participate in, it is equally--and to some surprisingly--rich in thought-provoking ideas and concepts about life that are both surprisingly fresh, but actually make a lot of sense at times; some of the theories actually seem to make the hardships in life a little easier to cope with, as off-kilter as they may seem at times.

I also love how the series has a little bit of a  'Bad Lieutenant' movies and a 'The Salton Sea' feel to it here and there; Russ driving while swigging cough syrup, and hallucinating as he does is what good police work is all about(and not unlike anything you would likely see in the aforementioned films...)

It make take 3 or 4 viewings to put it all together in your own way, but I suppose one of the great things about this show; There are several ways things can add up, and it's nice to have a show that gives you a little room to put your own brain to use as far as figuring out what you think is the logical or most viable explanation(s)for what you have just been though; And who knows...one of them may be right!

**MY FAVORITE WRITING EXAMPLE: When Matthew's character is talking about the death of his daughter in the interrogation room; he makes the comment(after a long and deep explanation...)that her death saved him from 'the sins of being a father'. When I heard his explanation why he feels this way and why he said what he said, it jaws most powerful; it was something i had never even thought of, and one of the most unique perspectives of anything I have seen on film. Writing like that doesn't come along too often, and there are dozens of moments in this show that will throw you for a loop, and in a good way...**

6217569,2,B00HUCF420,"The series begins with two detectives, Rust/Mcconaughey and Marty/Harrelson. Rust is a solitary nihilist while Marty is a family man and a  believing Christian. Predictably, for Hollywood types,Rust is man of unflinching integrity while Marty is a moral hypocrite with intermittent good guy moments. These two men are assigned to the ritual sex murder of a young girl in Louisiana. The local Christians are depicted as either poor, ignorant and debased or rich, corrupt, and depraved. Much of the dialogue is taken up with Rust's pompous drivel accompanied by his surreal ability to read people and get information.
Harrelson's acting in this series is terrible. He was great in comedies such as Cheers and Will and Grace as well as dramas such as The Walker. He can act-but not in this mess. You can almost see him choking back laughter when he is supposedly violently angry. Also his character is supposed to be under age 30 when the story begins and he looks over 50 which is in fact his real age. Mcconaughey is fine as Harrelson's suffering, driven partner but his talent isn't enough to cover the deficiencies of the series.
The ending is absurd as well as a philosophical cop-out given everything which has previously occurred.(I won't be more specific in order not to spoil it for those who want to invest in the series.)
The plot revolves around an interesting idea: Rust and Marty solve the original murder. Many years later similar crimes occur which leads a new team of detectives to suspect Cohle mislead Marty on the original case and that Cohle, himself, is the perpetrator. If they had just stuck with that idea without the predictable stereotypes they might have had something worthwhile

They are new partners and not exactly comfortable with the situation when they draw the murder of a woman who is staged in an apparent occult fashion in the middle of a burned cane field.  What follows is not only the details of their fifteen year investigation but also a look inside their lives.  They are both flawed.  They look at life from nearly opposite perspectives.  The mix makes for a strange partnership but very interesting viewing.  I've never seen anything on television or in film that tops this.  There is nothing formulaic here.  If you ever think you know where the story is heading, you quickly find out that you're wrong.  I can't recommend this highly enough.  Just a warning - this was an HBO series so no limitations on language, nudity or adult situations.  This is one to watch after the kids are in bed.",1402790400,,1000,4.625

The directing and cinematography is beautiful (there is a mind-blowing six minute shot at the end of episode four that is unprecedented), the storytelling is absolutely top-notch, but it is the characters and the acting that really blew me away. Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson have phenomenal chemistry together and bring Rust Cohle and Marty Hart to life like I've never seen two characters brought to life before. This show is about these two men and what they go through, separately and together, and I've never witnessed a more compelling journey played out on TV or in a movie. The blu-ray really brings out the beauty of the show, and every shot is a separate work of art. The commentaries, making-of featurette and conversations between McConaughey/Harrelson and T. Bone Burnett/Nic Pizzolatto are all worth watching and are very good inclusions to the set. The only thing that I can say I am disappointed by are the deleted scenes. I was looking forward to seeing any extra bits of these characters that I could get my hands on, and there are only two deleted scenes included, and Rust/Marty are only in the background on one and not even present in the other. But the blu-ray set is definitely worth buying despite this; this is a show I could watch over and over again and never get tired of it.

It is a masterpiece, and I would love to see more.

The dynamic pairing of McConaughey and Harrelson shows what film chemistry is all about. Harrelson has never, ever been better (and this work reminds you of just how great he can be), but McConaughey blows the roof off and, adding to his exemplary run of intense, devastating recent performances (Dallas Buyers Club, Mud, Killer Joe, etc.), he makes an easy-to-defend case for his being the greatest actor working today.

Less a serial killer thriller or police procedural than a psychological study of two broken men, True Detective adroitly mixes noir, Southern Gothic horror, drama and black comedy to come up with an original formula that is bound to be much copied, but never equalled.

You'll never get Rust Cohle out of your head though. You have been warned. The musical score is to die for, brilliantly compiled by T. Bone Burnett.",1402704000,4,1025,4.982456140350878

But this puts him at the top of the A-list for sure. Several friends highly recommended the series to me and I had to wait until it was released on DVD (okay, Amazon streaming). At first, the series took a while to pique my interest, but after the third episode, I was completely hooked. I binged watched the series over the course of 3 nights. The last 10 minutes of Episode 4 are a must watch for any sort of film or cinematography buff - it's absolutely mind-blowing. I've already re-watched that clip several times.  I was a bit put-off by the nudity, mainly because I found it completely unnecessary, but that's probably because I'm a heterosexual female and the nudity was almost all of the female variety. In the future, I do hope the series includes more female leads - while Michelle Monaghan's character was halfway interesting, she's about the only female with speaking lines.",1402617600,3,1133,4.751269035532995

character development: interesting angle and it took awhile to like it -- Going back and forth in time is an annoyingly story breaking tactic, but for this series, it is the bottom line of the story's theory: .... well I don't have the time to type it all!

i watched all 8 episodes straight up not knowing a single thing about this particular show. i just liked the title ""True"" is what got me; and both the lead actors who I know put their all out in no matter what job they have to act.

I was ready for the excellent, excelletnt, excellent filmography, photography, typography, video and computer graphic ehancements -- a GoPro on the tail light, although a little long, had me laughing. It was long enough, but then the background became obviously fake to me, so that made it too long; but I can see endless possibility with the ''Shakey-Wakey Tail Light Bulb""

Ah, the music. Well the musician is a pro in the field as well as an accomplished artist, and he's as dark, thoughtful and pensive as the writers of the film.

For me, and I will watch this many, many, many times, this was the epitome of just a terrific piece of engaging, entertaining, thoughtful, and beautiful and exquisitely done work.

6217601,4,B00HUCF420,"First off, I'd just like to say that the show itself looks and sounds absolutely amazing on Blu-Ray. I remember watching the first episode when it originally aired and thinking to myself, ""Yeah, I'm going to get this when it releases."" I'm glad I did. The visuals are first class, flawless work. Seriously, the transfer is simply perfect. The DTS-MA track is equally impressive, enveloping you in the sounds of the bayou and the thick atmosphere of rural Louisiana. I have absolutely no complaints about how they handled the audio and video of the show itself in this set. It's literally pitch perfect and I'm so impressed with it that I simply can't help but gush over it repeatedly.

With that being said, the extras kind of left me a little disappointed. Most of what's here are fluff pieces that aired on HBO already, tidbits that really just cover the episodes in a way that doesn't add much more to what you've already seen. There are small synopses for each episode, a brief making-of, an interview with T-Bone Burnett and Nic Pizzolato that didn't cover the musical aspect of the show in as much detail as I would have liked, two episode commentaries, two deleted scenes (the deleted scene that comes out of episode 8 is actually my favorite extra on this set and one that I recommend you watch; it's really nothing more than just a moody montage of scenery and music but it's the one extra on the set that captures the heart and soul of True Detective), interviews with stars Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey and that's really about it.

Again, the audio/video portion of True Detective is nothing less than phenomenal. I was hoping for something a little more concise in terms of extras. That's not to say that what's here isn't worth watching but the show was so good that it just deserved a really nice, feature packed edition that delved even deeper into the dangerous world that Nic Pizzolato and Cary Fukunaga had created and bestowed upon its unsuspecting audience.

Very much worth picking up so long as you're not expecting a true special edition.",1402531200,8,2072,4.734072022160665

First off, you will find several deleted scenes and two audio commentaries, I enjoyed the one featuring Pizzolatto and T Bone Burnett (the music coordinator)  You are also treated to a conversation between those two.

You are also given a making of - around fifteen minutes, which if you are an HBO fan, you know how they set up their featurettes, interviews, on set chatter.  Scene reviews, and come on McConaughey and Harrelson are entertaining, so they enhance everything they are involved in.  They go through scenes almost like a dissection of sorts, which is fitting.

The audio and video are stellar.  I wish there had been just a bit more background in regards to the writing etc., but I feel satisfied, you get the series and a way to enhance that initial experience.

6217608,5,B00HUCF420,"True Detective is one of those rare TV shows that actually suffers from its extremely high quality. Each episode is better than the last and about six episodes in, it looks to be one of the most dense, mosaic, and brilliant pieces of fiction to grace the mainstream small-screen. Naturally, as the closing episodes near, viewer expectation is insanely high. But in order to satisfy and match the quality of the previous episodes, the ending would have to be almost supernaturally great, something so mind-blowing and glorious that all other TV shows would look like child's play in comparison. Then the last episode hits and the audience realizes that behind all of the mythology and smoke and mirrors and red herrings, Rust Cohle and Marty Hart are living in the real world, one where stories, no matter how big or small, must come to a close. And while the narrative does come to a realistic conclusion, the finale is still suffused with the same oddball existential rants that make True Detective a true classic. The character of Rust is probably too complicated for his own good. His nihilistic outlook on life contradicts his involvement with the justice-driven police force. His pessimistic outlook on religion conflicts with the speech at the end about his daughter. It's hard to say if these are flaws in writing or just conflicting perspectives from a deeply troubled man too smart for his own good. He's someone trapped in the confines of his own genius, but like any human, he can have his frame of mind shattered by life's twisted order. Marty Hart is a perfect foil for Rust. Hart is a man driven by emotion and impulse. He is essentially Rust's only connection to reality and while he is equally flawed, he is the far more sympathetic and relatable of the two. Bravo to Nic Pizzolatto for creating these characters and the cruel world they inhabit. The finest details are fleshed out to the point that it would take multiple viewings to appreciate just how rich and intricately plotted the series is. Really, nothing but praise to Mr. Pizzolatto. Then there is the director, Cary Joji Fukunaga, who brought Nic's vision to life. He succeeds in creating the perfect atmosphere for the world the characters inhabit and he, along with DP Adam Arkapaw, shot it beautifully. While the majority of the show is rather standard fare visually, it does have it's unbelievably high moments, like the 6-minute tracking shot at the end of episode four, ranking as one of the most ambitious shots in television history. T Bone Burnett lends to the gloomy bayou atmosphere with a host of country-fried blues numbers that aren't necessarily as 'grabby' as, say, Breaking Bad's music choice, but fitting nonetheless. And saving the best for last, the performances are truly unforgettable. The Lincoln Lawyer, Killer Joe, Bernie, Mud, The Wolf of Wall Street, and most significantly, Dallas Buyers Club, have all contributed to Matthew McConaughey's unforeseen resurgence, but his work in True Detective is arguably the pinnacle of his career. He takes a character that certainly isn't easy to get a read on and completely embodies him. It's obvious he understood the highly complex role and just made it his own. Woody Harrelson, an always dependable actor with a penchant for lunatic personas, changes pace here with an everyman type character that's developed and engaging enough to keep up with the overpowering Rust. Harrelson pulls off rage better than any other emotion, but he still remains totally believable in scenes requiring more finesse and subtlety. It's a marvel that the incredibly talented cast and crew got together and made such a memorable show that will no doubt stand the test of time.

6217644,5,B00HUCF420,"I will keep my comments brief and try to avoid any spoilers that would detract from the enjoyment of others.

There are a handful of movies, shows and series that are virtuoso creations on many different levels - the first season of True Detective is one of those rare efforts.  My words may sound like hyperbole, but I believe a large portion of the viewing audience will concur with this description after watching this eight part storyline.  This is one of the most cerebral television shows I've ever experienced, yet that aspect of the show lingers with you after it's over.  While watching it, the overwhelming reaction is far more visceral.

This is not a cop show.  Solving the crime is secondary to telling the story.

The easy description is to say it's about Good and Evil, but that doesn't do justice to what you will see play out.  There is an elusive devil, but there are no saints.  Every character is deeply flawed and damaged in ways that make this series far darker and grittier than any mundane detective drama you've seen before.  Nevertheless,  you cannot avoid being pulled in to this world and starting to understand what makes each person tick.  It's a triumph of both the acting and the writing - you will care very much about these shattered lives.  I was never a fan of Harrellson or McConaughey in the past, but they were born for these roles and they inhabit their characters with a passion for nuance that is a wonder to behold.

One last point:  another reviewer mentioned the impact of the theme music and graphic intro to the show as contributing to the overall experience, and I have to agree.  The reviewer's comment that you know you're about to see something great when the intro music and imagery is perfectly matched, regardless of genre, was insightful.  True Detective's opening theme sets up the ""feel"" of the show in the same way that Dexter, Game of Thrones, Battlestar Gallactica Reimagined and The Sopranos set the stage for those series.  When a show's Producer is willing to spend as much money creating an extraordinary introduction piece as most other shows spend on an entire episode, you know that you're about to see a truly well-crafted series.",1400198400,15,2198,4.724409448818897
6217645,5,B00HUCF420,"Hands down the best drama show I've seen in a long time....very refreshing to know that there are still some writers out there who can actually write plot and characters.
Matt and Woody have done their share of crappy, for the paycheck, movies, but, all of that is forgiven by watching these two actors do what they do best.....ACT.

Best to go into this haunting story cold as I did. Just let the spooky story pull you in and wash over you.

If you liked the ""Prime Suspect"" movies, this is up there with those stories. Best watched on a cold, rainy night.

Harrelson and McConaughey were perfect together in this show.  I'm definitely bummed that they won't make another one together, (yet) but at the same time I'm a little happy because HBO won't get to run it into the ground and ruin something so good like they have done with every other series.  Harrelson and McConaughey set the standard on how this show should be so I definitely expect the new season to be just as good if not better.",1399334400,2,594,4.472222222222222

- the storytelling is very fascinating, with 2 investigations going on (one takes place in 1995, the other one 17 years after)
- actors performance : with Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson, you can expect a good acting performance. Well it's even better than what I could think. McConaughey gives a mind blowing performance..
- photography is amazingly beautiful as Louisiana reveals both it's beauty and most frightenning aspects of the bayou
- It's an anthology, so there won't be 10 deceiving seasons coming up, but new potential jewels...

Almost did not even try this.  Not a fan of Harrelson but, like McConaughey and read many positive reviews.  Really glad I watched it.  Very well done.  Jumps time constantly, but they do a good job of helping you keep your place.

Same director and director for the whole season, which really helped with the consistency.  Felt more like a really long movie.  You did not get that issue where characters change drastically between episodes.

Only quibble is the price.  $40 for 8 episodes?  Just sign up for HBO for a month and watch it On Demand for less than half of that.  This is a pre-release price.  Maybe it will get more reasonable.  Having said that, if I had to chose between paying $40 or never seeing this show, I would pay the $40.",1398038400,2,821,4.386666666666667

6217652,5,B00HUCF420,"Being a fan of both gothic literature and crime fiction and a huge admirer of Tim Willocks' and James Lee Burke's novels, principally featuring the latter's New Iberia detective, Dave Robicheaux and his sidekick, Clete Purcell, I eagerly awaited the appearance of HBO's True Detective. Basically it's a `buddy movie', or more accurately, a buddy anthology, since both its protagonists, spectacularly brought to life in this first installment, by Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson, play homicide cops for the Louisiana State Police.

Of course, since detectives work in pairs, it's hard not to make a buddy movie about cops; (one notable recent exception being `Prisoners' featuring Jake Gyllenhaal's, billy no-mates). From, Bodie and Doyle, Starsky and Hutch and Cagney and Lacey right up to the recent crop of Nordic Noir imports, The Killing and The Bridge, the crime element almost always takes backstage, slightly, to the (developing) relationship between the cops. True Detective is no exception and it is the character arc of predominantly, Woody Harrelson's, Detective Marty Hart, which provides the interest here: both cops are damaged, or at least, troubled `lost souls', more obviously so in the case of McConaughy's `Rust' Cohle, whose eccentricities are explained by the fact that `he's from Texas'. So it is that, at first, Detective Hart appears to be the well-balanced, sane, `feet on the ground' type of guy assigned a new, slightly strange, partner from out of state.  However, initially, at least, this relationship is definitely of the `love hate' variety with the love conspicuous by its absence.

SOME SPOILERS from this point!

They're sent to the scene of, what appears to be, a ritual killing and so begins the investigation of the murder of the unfortunate former prostitute, Dora Kelly Lange. And gradually, as the investigation develops we get the impression that all is not right in Marty's life and, just as there is a very dark undercurrent flowing beneath the seeming respectability of the civic life of Vermilion Parish and the wider state scene of Louisiana, so there are features of Marty's domestic and professional situations that don't bear too close a scrutiny. And, progressively, we begin to detect that the apparently most troubled of the two, Cohle, is, in fact, the one whose integrity remains intact as his partner slowly disintegrates under the pressure of being forced to confront both the unsavoury reality of his working life and the values upon which his domestic `relationships' are founded and the conflict within his soul becomes a raging war between the two sides of his personality.

Duality/duplicity is a constant thread running through the story; from, for example, Cohle's four years spent as an undercover narcotics cop among an East Texas biker gang and Hart's reprehensible antics, to those of the odious Rev. Billy Lee Tuttle and his family. Even Maggie, Hart's unfortunate wife; a victim of his `extra-curricular activities', decides to use his own methods against him, defiling herself and Cohle in the process. Added to this is the destabilizing effect on Hart of his oldest daughter's emerging sexuality signaling her eventual departure from the family home representing, once again, a breakdown of the family as a unifying principle in his life. Thus, when she is caught in the back of a car with, not one, but  two teenaged boys his instinctive reaction is to hit out  with unthinking violence because, in doing so, he somehow manages to assuage his own guilt at consorting with much younger women, and re-establish the norms of his `social/domestic order'. This partly explains the extremes of Hart's violence whenever he's confronted by his own `indescretions': it is Cohle who holds up to him a mirror from which he can't avert his gaze and which, therefore, must be smashed into non-existence.

Another main character, of course, is the mysterious perpetrator, heard (about) but rarely seen and referred to, variously, as the `Green Spaghetti Monster' and the `Yellow King' who inhabits `Carcosa', which seems to be, in the latter case, a direct reference to the late Nineteenth Century writers of `Lovecraftian' type supernatural tales, Robert W. Chambers and Ambrose Bierce, respectively. Check out the cover art from the recent `CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform' edition of Chamber's `The King in Yellow' to see what I mean.

But perhaps the most mysterious character of all is the Louisiana countryside; an often bleak, flat seemingly never-ending terrain of impenetrable bayous, swampy inlets, bald-cypresses and oak forests; a terrain that gives shelter to the monster towards which the action propels our two driven detectives, who, in seeking to end its nefarious reign, look to salvage some kind of personal and joint redemption.

The whole thing is brilliantly realized: the writing assured, the narrative multilayered, the plot complex, the dialogue rich and authentic and the acting stunning. We've been spoilt by 24, Homeland, The Killing and The Bridge etc. but this is right up there with the very best and the `icing' on this particular cake is the theme song by the Handsome Family that effortlessly evokes the alien nature of the angel-abandoned country through which, with Cohle and Hart, we fearfully tread!

6217655,1,B00HUCF420,All this garbage does is combine all the stereotypes about detectives . McConaughey has always been a bad actor and Harrelson isn't much better . Their both cardboard characters and the writing is so predictable . This is more brainless trash from HBO which is a brainless network anyway .,1397174400,17,289,4.8
6217656,5,B00HUCF420,"I want to start by saying; this show didn't hook me immediately. I am a Woody Harrelson fan and I think Matthew McConaughey might be the most underappreciated actor in the business. This series showcases these two in such an amazing way, so don't give up on this show after 1 episode. It is deep, dark, and thrilling, but it takes its time developing these characters.

This series is very unique. This is a one trick pony with this cast. Eight masterful episodes for season 1, then season 2 casts a new set of detectives with a completely new storyline. Pretty cool premise if you ask me.

Episode 1 lays the groundwork for what is to come in the series. It provides a bird's eye view of the plot and begins to develop the main cast of characters. From that point on, the action and drama builds, ultimately leading up to a very strong finale. There are so many shows nowadays that start strong and leave the fans hanging with a finale that is too cute or artsy and it is so unsatisfying (see Walking Dead Season 4 Finale as an example.) In my opinion, this show kept its potency all the way through to the very end.

I like very dark and mature rated shows. I loved shows like Dexter, Hannibal, Breaking Bad, The Walking Dead among others, but I fully realize this isn't everyone's cup of tea. The show has very dark and mature themes, some quite disturbing, so if you are easily put off by violence, gore and nudity, this is not the show for you. In fact, you might want to drop your HBO and/or Showtime membership because that is a common thread with those premium channel's television shows. If you are not put off by this (openly admitting these are the things I actually seek out in shows,) this might be a show for you.

If you can appreciate very well-written, well-acted televisions shows, you'll love True Detective. Having the benefit of watching the episodes back to back, as frequently as you want, is a benefit. There are little details that come full circle, so not having to wait a week in between will help you follow along with the story.

Couple tips when watching:

1. Be fully awake, as to not miss any important plot details.
2. Brush up on your redneck - sometimes the Southern twang is difficult to make out.
3. Turn up the volume! There are so many subtle lines in the show that resurface throughout, so you'll want to be sure you hear them.
4. Commit to watching at least the first 3 or 4 episodes before deciding on whether or not you finish the season. Trust me, you'll be happy you did. It REALLY picks up in the later episodes.

I hope this review helps someone!",1396569600,38,2593,4.423480083857442

My life doesn't revolve around when a show is on~~except for True Detective. I'm getting my name on the list here, because it won't be the same next season. Brad Pitt is considered.

I can only hope Penny Dreadful looks promising and The Knick. Course I was hoping Black Sails would be good. Very first episode 2 women go at it. I couldn't grab the remote fast enough.

It is a wholly  different story being told ...excellently. I am born and bred in the deep south and  the way the setting was established  was at once familiar and foreign to me at the same time. That is hard to do.
I  subscribe to HBO so I could watch the episodes on demand any time I wanted to I did not watch while the showed aired because I typically don't have the time to watch programs at their true airing time. The only exception to that rule was Breaking Bad. I always watched it on its air night. With anything else, I always have to make the time to watch after the fact and let me say, that since starting to watch this last night, I had to finish all 8 episodes. This show is a masterpiece.

6217659,5,B00HUCF420,"HBO is no stranger to dark, compelling and beautifully performed television. THE WIRE, DEADWOOD, ROME, THE SOPRANOS, and GAME OF THRONES are the most obvious examples of this. THE WIRE, which I still contend is the best show HBO's ever done, took the procedural cop drama that had permeated network prime-time television and turned it on its head. And that's pretty much the formula for all these great television shows. They all bend their genres from Westerns to Sword-and-Sandal Historical Epics to Mob Stories to Sword-and-Sorcery Fantasy. The latest ""genre"" that has swept television is something I refer to as The Nihilistic Morality Play; basically a show that is so entrenched in thematic and character-based darkness and just barely giving hope to its characters and, by proxy, the viewers only to snatch it away from them and us. Shows like BREAKING BAD, HANNIBAL, THE KILLING, RAY DONOVAN, THE BRIDGE, THE WALKING DEAD, and THE AMERICANS are shows that are excellent examples of this new genre. Don't get me wrong; I love most of these programs, but they are VERY dark. But HBO decided to jump in to the deepest end of this darkness with creator Nic Pizzolato's TRUE DETECTIVE, a rural drama/thriller/philosophical treatise that doesn't just exist in darkness but in most cases, is consumed by it.

The plot and the mystery of TRUE DETECTIVE's narrative are almost inconsequential when it comes to the characters the show focuses around, which are Louisiana State Police Detectives Rust Cohle (Matthew McConaughey) and Martin Hart (Woody Harrleson). We meet them at two different stages of their lives; first in 1995 when the two detectives are paired up to investigate a murder with seeming occultist ties and then in 2012, long after they've parted ways and ""solved"" the murder. While the murder investigation does generate enough suspense and drama to power two longer and more acceptable network procedurals, again, when you look at the characters of Cohle and Hart, you see the generators that power the show. You might think that The Yellow King's identity is incredibly important, but it isn't. You might think the fate of Billy Lee Tuttle is incredibly important, but again, it isn't. The mystery, like the masterful first season of David Lynch's TWIN PEAKS, isn't so much the driving force but rather a catalyzing agent that bonds the characters together.

Rust and Marty are incredibly damamged people (and in some ways, incredibly unlikable), and there is an instant and somewhat intense dislike of one another that never goes away in the early parts of their partnership. Rust lost his young daughter which caused his wife to leave as well, which has so deadened his mind to ideas of love and relationships and life in general that he purely focuses on the analytical, no matter the dark places his logic takes him. Marty is damaged also, but in a different way. He believes that his world revolves solely around him so that he can do anything he wants with little to no thought of the consequences, and this not only ruins his own life but that of his wife Maggie (Michelle Monaghan) as well. But the idea that the show does really explore is that no matter the animosity Rust and Marty share for one another, there is a brotherhood between them that their beliefs, their actions, and their dissonant personalities cannot break. It goes beyond trust, respect and love. It's as if they are two halves of the same person that when together can possibly be made whole, which is punctuated very specifically in the finale.

Another thing that breaks clean from the genre it inhabits is its glimpses at these men in two different times. Most programs that deal with time differentials tend to cheat their audience by intercutting the present with the past in order to get to the present more quickly, but Pizzolato is smart enough to know that the audience for a show like this refuses to be cheated. It allows the past and the present to build logically and organically without haste, which is something that very few shows of this type, if any, allow for.

If I had a complaint about the show, it's the treatment of the female characters; they don't necessarily seem fully fleshed-out and three dimensional, but instead seem to be more reflective of the id, ego and superego (respectively) of the two leads. They're not there just to give motivation or to be plot points either, but rather exist in the ether between the relationship of these two men. It's not so much a criticism, because the show isn't trying to examine gender roles, but rather to explore the character of who Marty and Rust are.

From a technical standpoint, the show is a dreamland of simplistic visual wizardry. Cary Joji Fukunaga, who directed all eight episodes, is a master visual storyteller. There isn't a shot or angle that seems decorative or meaningless. Of course, the one scene that still has viewers reeling and examining that displays his know-how and his pacing genius is the single-take scene at the end of Episode 4, which rivals that of the single-shot takes that made Alfonso Cuaron an Oscar winner. From a storytelling standpoint, Pizzolato, who wrote all the episodes, really knows how to pace a scene and his dialogue has a rich flow that also never really seems false. The show also has the added benefit of the legendary T-Bone Burnett being the music supervisor of this show. It adds a necessary rural flavor to the show that makes it that much more excellent.

Then, there are the performances. It's extremely likely that both Harrleson and McConaughey will be vying for Best Actor when the Emmys and Golden Globes come around in 2014. Respectively, this is each actor's best work to date. McConaughey has been slowly lifting himself out of the dregs of the rom-com hell he seemed to be consigned to, to becoming one of the great actors of our time, with his work in films like KILLER JOE, MUD, THE LINCOLN LAWYER and DALLAS BUYERS CLUB. But his work as Rust Cohle is a punctuation mark on that statement. Harrleson has been defying his initial career definition as the brainless good-ol'-boy from CHEERS since his work in films like NATURAL BORN KILLERS, WHITE MEN CAN'T JUMP, and more recently in smaller indies like RAMPART and HBO's GAME CHANGE, and while he gave excellent performances in those films, he has never given a performance that's so well-rounded and utterly immersive as his interpretation of Marty. Monaghan is also excellent, even if I personally felt that she was a little underused.

One of the things that will keep bringing people back to TRUE DETECTIVE is not necessarily the mystery, although it is a mighty one, or the plots, but the way that this show is so expertly constructed and so compelling. This is a no-brainer as far as the best new show on television, and it deserves every praise that people can heap onto it.",1396051200,43,6865,4.842419080068143
6217660,5,B00HUCF420,Amazing series!  I am a long-time HBO subscriber; I was certainly grateful of that fact when this series aired.  Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson are suberb in this and the writing is excellent.  The series is like one of those great novels that you return to again and again.  Nic Pizzolatto (writer) will have to out do himself for Season 2; I can't wait.,1395964800,2,364,4.640625
6217661,5,B00HUCF420,"Overall, I have to concur with those reviewers who agree with the Hype; this is a modern masterpiece, and if it has a weakness, it is in the relatively shallow female characters.

Other than that, everything from the stunning cast (all of 'em) to the direction, cinematography, you name it, is top drawer. This is by far one of the most atmospheric productions of any type I have ever seen. I could easily see this building into the cult status of Blade Runner and the original UK version of The Wicker Man, which may have inspired the ritual animal masks etc.

I can understand a certain amount of disappointment with the ending, in that the show did not quite unfold as complex a story as it first appeared it would. Clearly, The Yellow King reference was a tip of the hat to the 1895 pre-Lovecraftian collection of short stories by Robert W.Chambers, called The King In Yellow, with its lost city of Carcosa. There is potentially enormous depth to the background story elements and they are not fully explored by the end. Nor are there any conclusions about the child sacrifice cult.

In the Chambers saga, the lost city of Carcosa is on a planet with twin suns, which suggests an influence on Lovecraft's Great Old Ones who came from the stars. If the references were to be taken literally rather than metaphorically, this ET connection and the hinted at child sacrifice cult echoes the theme of David Icke's controversial Children of the Matrix, in which he claims that many powerful figures in the world are involved in ritual child sacrifice as part of secret societies which serve alien shape-shifting rulers. Hey, don't shoot the messenger...

Many Conspiracy theorists and even some scientists have suggested that since 98% of our 'human' DNA is non-coding or 'Junk DNA', which appears to serve no biological function, this suggests some kind of genetic engineering of Homo Erectus to produce Homo Sapiens. If any such ET cult connection was actually being hinted at in TD, it was not developed or even acknowledged in the finale. Even if we assume the metaphysical slant on the cryptic lines from certain crazy and/or drug addled freaks, the finale only offers the taking down of a hillbilly who was nailing his sister and some vague reference to the public figures going unpunished.

Yes, the story leaves a few avenues unexplored, but Life itself is always going to leave some unanswered questions, and the Mystery is what makes it so compelling.

6217664,5,B00HUCF420,"I consider this more of a 8 hour movie then a series. Because they went into this show knowing that there would only be 8 episodes and the stars would not return if the series did, it gave them a lot of freedom. It let them tell the story in such a way it could unfold slowly (but in no way boring). They didn't have to write themselves into anything they couldn't get out of or have to wrap up quickly. To see the story from 3 sides, the two main characters and the truth, is handled in such a fantastic way I couldn't wait until the next week to see what would happen next. Incredible acting by Woody Harrelson and especially Matthew McConaughey along with great directing and editing bring this well written story to a new level.

I don't want to spoil anything but I will say the ending that some are upset with, sticks with the rest of the story. It is set in the real world and in the real world, monsters and demons are just people. Evil, sick, and twisted...but just people. There are so many memorable moments and I can't wait to get the Blu-ray so I can watch it all again straight though. I would pay full price just for the series so any bonus material is just that, a bonus.

The story is slow to build, but in a good way. Kind of like the movie Drive. There is so much going on you will want to watch it as soon as you are finished. 5 stars all the way!",1395532800,13,1367,4.097014925373134

6217670,5,B00HUCF420,"This series is excellent. I was impressed with the cunning of the script and the way it kept me off guard throughout the entire series. It is a screenplay that blurs the lines between an investigation of a serial killer and the two detectives that pursue that killer over a 17 year period. The character development was exceptional which has to be attributed not only to the well written and paced script but primarily to the exceptional acting of Mathew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson. This may be McConaugheys finest role to date as the viewer tries to decipher the mind and motives of this odd character that he creates on the screen. McConaughey plays Russ Cohle, a damaged but brilliant man. He is a fascinating character for his complete pessimism, cynicism, and desire for justice.  I found his complexity to be very appealing for how can a man with such cunning and intelligence, with such a dark view of the world, believe that justice can be won?  This is why he is one of the most unique of heroes for he knows that justice is hard won and a price must be paid. Woody Harrelson plays a bit more mainstream character but as the series develops viewers see the layers peel off, revealing the depths of this character that Harrelson creates. The series revolves around a terrible crime made bizarre by demonic ritualistic overtones but it is the cleverness of actors, writers, and director to ensure that the crime is the glue that holds the character development and character conflicts together. This is not Sherlock Holmes and Mr. Watson and the constant grating of these two strong personalities against each other makes for fascinating entertainment. The unfolding crime and investigation is balanced perfectly with the amazing character development of the two men who have entered this investigation together. Cinematography and art direction are excellent in this series, in fact some of the scenes are so nasty that it makes you want to take a bath.  But make no mistake, it is adult entertainment, and involves serial murders, nude bodies, alcoholism, prostitution, political and police corruption, and drugs. This series is so well done; it is hard to imagine how it could be improved.",1394755200,6,2204,4.903485254691689
6217681,5,B00HUCF420,"There are many things to love about this show, but its best quality is its bleak but brainy weirdness. The pair of mismatched cops is a very familiar format for a mystery/action/thriller story, and this show is not immune to using numerous clich&eacute;s throughout its telling. But there is a very unique and special tone for which the story strives and nails. Between one protagonist's sour nihilism to the murders' bizarre and occult fiendishness, this series does a superb job of creating a spectacularly grim and gloomy world for this case, a version of rural Louisiana that is both kooky and spooky.

This show is exceptionally intelligent too. Heady mysticism, heavy philosophies, sinister takes on religion and self, even discussions of space-time quantum theory - there are many deep layers which permeate the procedural, and they are all a real joy to engage with and muse over. With its labyrinthine structure of flashbacks within flashbacks, and a story which unfolds across decades, this series certainly aims high with its ambitions to deliver something far more than just good guys vs. bad guys. With so many of the characters' motives and intentions murkily shaded in gray, part of the fun is unraveling for whom to cheer and how.

As an HBO program, the show fulfills its requisite amounts of violence, gore, nudity, language and sex. But as an HBO show, all of the acting and production is superb, from its wonderful score and soundtrack, to its sublime cinematography and dark visual effects. Both McConaughey and Harrelson have never been finer in their portrayals of their complex and contentious sleuths.

Based on the online reaction to the finale/aftermath of this show, I'd say the ONLY people who didn't enjoy it were the ones who thought they had outsmarted everyone by deciphering the mystery, and were then disappointed when it did not meet their expectations of how the show ""should"" have ended. If you approach ""True Detective"" with an open mind, you will indeed be deeply rewarded by its delightfully transcendent journey.

Similar, less-famous recommendations that spring to mind:
""Angel Heart"" - Supernatural detective story from the 80s.
""Prisoners"" - Dark kidnapping case with similarly somber atmosphere and gut-wrenching intensity.
""Kill Thy Neighbor"" - Insane and surreal book where YOU are placed in the midst of a maddening murder mystery.",1394755200,4,2380,5.142118863049095
6217682,5,B00HUCF420,"In my opinion this is a bit too short to be a television season; it's 8 episodes of just an under an hour each and since it tells just one story it's really more like a mini-series.  With that said, my wife and I found this title on HBO GO one night and ended up watching all of the episodes over just a couple of days.

Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey are both brilliant in bringing their characters to life.  The cinematography is absolutely beautiful and fits perfectly with the pulp detective fiction story that we get here.  Harrleson and McConaughey are cops trying to solve a case over the years, even pursuing it after they're both off the job.

The series jumps back and forth in time in order to tell the story but does so in a way that doesn't leave the viewer disjointed.  The fact that one episode follows directly on the heels of the last makes this more or less an eight hour movie.  The pacing is brilliant and nothing seems forced as the story comes together.

I would definitely recommend this series to anyone that likes gritty, pulp detective fiction.  Great story, great visuals and excellent acting.",1394755200,3,1129,4.5495049504950495
6217683,5,B00HUCF420,"Remember when Woody Harrelson was a bartender at Cheers? By the time Matthew McConaughey played the muscled tough guy para-military dragon killer in Reign of Fire he had already been in Hollywood for 10 years. And Reign of Fire was in 2002. Both of these men, fine actors, have a ton of experience. Both are excellent actors. Both have been through a lot of personal problems and bad situations. There were a few times I was wondering if I would ever see either one of them in a movie again. They went through all that and I believe it helped them make this show, True Detective, one of the best detective, cop shows I've ever seen. And I've been watching cop shows since 'book 'em Danno' on Hawaii Five-0. Kevin Bacon's 'The Following' is a ridiculous parody of law enforcement compared to this excellent drama. I know some folks out there really like The Following. I couldn't take it. Too many instances of people doing stupid things that no normal person would do. In True Detective most all of what I observed followed common sense. People doing things as real as they could. The writing and directing in True Detective was real, it made sense. This is a great show. And both actors deserve as many awards as the PC community in Hollywood can give them. So do the writers and director. And all those folks whose names scroll by so fast you usually can't read them.",1394582400,4,1369,4.5465587044534415
6217684,3,B00HUCF420,"Nobody seems to want the middle ground on this one, so, having watched the series on HBO, I'll try to stake it out:

First of all, yes, the acting was great--especially McConaughey--but the lead performances were weakened for me by the fact that neither main actor looks 17 years younger in the flashback scenes than in the ""present day"" scenes. In fact I thought McConaughey looked younger in the ""present"" than in the ""past."" And Michelle Monaghan doesn't seem to age one single day by the final episode--presumably because, however she ends up at the end of this one is how she'll have to appear throughout Season Two, and Season Three if there is one.

As far as the ""violence against women"" complaints, True Detective is guilty of them--and guilty also of violence toward men, since all the ""bad guys"" in Season One are either drug-crazed bikers, wacked evangelists, or African American drug dealers. The episode in which the drug dealers appear is so very violent that I supposed (incorrectly) that it had been written by a different writer and directed by a different director. I can't imagine why that episode was added to the mix, except as a bid to try to pull in a wider audience by pandering to the lowest common denominator. The series as a whole is rather slow-paced,atmospheric, almost poetic at times; and the characters tend to be introspective; and there are long, well-written conversations throughout. Since nothing happens in the bikers-versus-drug-dealers episode that couldn't have been handled by a more subtle plot twist, that violence is absolutely gratuitous. That episode didn't need to be there, so it shouldn't have been.

The best elements of Season One are its overall creepiness and the sustained dramatic tension: these kept me waiting for each new installment--but the ending to Season One was a big disappointment, so I wouldn't watch these episodes again or buy them on disc. The plot, in the end, remains inexplicable--unless you find ""some totally evil form of bizarre insanity"" satisfying and plausible. The opening gambit--a nude body found arranged in a creepy tableau--is never explained by anything other than this same ""evil insanity,"" and that means the nudity of that first corpse is also entirely gratuitous. Finally, most of the actual detective work in this story gets accomplished during the hiatus between the flashbacks and the present day--in other words, all of the ""true detecting"" takes place off camera--which is thoroughly disappointing to a viewer who expects an air-tight mystery. In short, this is not a series for the mystery lover; it's also not for the squeamish or prudish; and it's not for those who want a thoughtfully crafted plot. It does have some female nudity and some guns, and a passel of wacko rednecks--but those who like this series for these latter elements will probably not appreciate its slow pacing and all of the dialogue. I'd assume this series will have to pick either one audience or the other for its next season: either become more blatantly and senselessly violent and titillating, or else settle down to be more subtle and more intellectual.

Anybody willing to bet they don't choose the former?",1394496000,30,3186,5.005660377358491

All  of the characters were wonderfully cast and perfect for the roles, from the stars to the bit part players. You have NEVER seen the intensity of the drama on TV before, of that I am sure. This should rate above Dallas Buyers Club as McConaghy's best work.

The scene, set in Southern Louisana makes it all the more believable. If you have never been there, you may not get it, but if you have it will send chills down your spine. This is enchanced by the mood and demeanaor of everyone. There is simply no way to guess ""what happens next"" and it does not play to stereotypes.

""True Detective,"" IMO, sends a message to reality shows that they are fast becoming history. More authentic than reality, like a fractal image, all facets of this series have clarity and detail that you can drill-down on.

Just as striking, there are no near misses on sensitive social issues. Like ""Curb Your Enthusiasm's"" willingness to look taboo and socially-delicate topics dead in the eye, ""True Detective"" (without the laugh track) follows suit and gives us a shockingly direct view of how it is with us. The sidebars alone could be segments in themselves. No need to imagine anything; this show is imaginative.

McConaughey forces me to forget some of his earlier work and instantly leap-frogs into that small group of my favorite actors. Harrelson is right behind him. What a team!

I love Justified, Breaking Bad, Hannibal, and so many other amazing shows, but none of those struck me like True Detective. Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson both give career defining performances, backed by a dark, twisting narrative that hooks you in the first episode and doesn't let go, even after the credits of the finale roll. Everything about this show is of the highest quality. Acting, directing, production, casting, sound design; everything is as good as it gets.

True Detective follows Martin Hart (Woody Harrelson) and Rustin Cohle (Matthew McConaughey) as they investigate a grisly murder in rural Louisiana. That is all I dare give away because I will be doing you a disservice giving any more than that away. This is a show to be experienced not described.

6217689,5,B00HUCF420,"If AMC's ""The Killing"" and the movie ""Se7en"" had a baby, it would be HBO's ""True Detective.""  The series begins with the discovery of a woman's body, left in a ritualistic fashion.  We move forward in time and the two main characters are being interviewed by different detectives, motivated in part by the erratic (suspicious?) behavior of Matthew McConaughey's character. The audience becomes interested in two mysteries: who is doing the killings and what happened between these two partners that caused the falling out?

Woody Harrelson and McConaughey are an acting pair that works remarkably well.  Detective dramas usually create drama by featuring two partners with opposing personalities.  Harrelson's character is a husband and father with a wandering eye and McConaughey's character is a single man who lives in a starkly decorated apartment and a detective-philosopher.  We see these characters age and change through the series.  Michelle Monaghan (""Gone Baby Gone"") is great as Harrelson's character's wife Maggie.

Whereas ""The Killing"" was set in rainy Seattle, ""True Detective"" is set in Southern Louisiana, not far from the water, but near an industrial area.  There is heat, decay and wildness conveyed in the series.

Now that the series Season 1 has aired, some people are complaining about the ending.  I felt it was a satisfying ending, any loose ends are tied up.  I think the things that transpired in the season finale are fitting for McConaughey's character given the way we hear him think and talk through all the prior episodes.

My favorite episode is Episode 5 ""The Secret Fate of Life"" because of the way the episode is carefully constructed.  The screenplay really takes advantage of the audience's ability to know only what they see.  We are mislead, but perhaps for our benefit.  Another episode of note is Episode 4, there is an action sequence that has the viewer holding their breath.

There is a lot here in this series, a lot to rewatch in fact.  Overall, a gritty show, with some excellent story arcs.  I liked the ending, the universe gets some order back, but not without taking payment first.",1394409600,8,2135,5.031339031339031
6217690,5,B00HUCF420,"Watched the last episode of this series last night. It was one of the most intense episodes of anything I've ever seen. The ending was absolutely fabulous! Mystical! It was Redemption. I've ordered the Blu Ray edition, even though it's outrageously expensive. I've watched ever episode twice -- well, the last episode I'll be watching today for the second time.

This series has the most exalted, positive, and satisfying ending of any series I've ever seen. In fact, it was transcendent and fully redemptive. Both characters were utterly transformed and the transformations come as a profound relief, but something you could see coming in the last three episodes, but not so complete and joyful. This was a spiritual journey like none I'd ever seen before dramatized in a series. At the end, it was more than just redemption. It was revelation.

Before this, the most memorable series for TV that I've seen are the following: The BBC miniseries WAR AND PEACE with Anthony Hopkins as Pierre, A&E and BBC adaptation of Jane Austin's PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, the BBC production of I, CLAUDIUS, BOARDWALK EMPIRE, and BREAKING BAD.

6217692,5,B00HUCF420,"What an explosive of a show!!!

Besides having two of my favorite actors in one setting, True Detective will grasp ahold of you and won't let you go until the last episode.  The series had you from the opening song, the scenery of Louisiana backwoods, marshes and fields to the relationship between Woody and Matthew [total polar opposites]; what a great pairing.

Matthew with his no ""non-sense"" persona and had no shame with his bluntness and ""in your face"" honesty.  It was enough to make you want to do him harm! While Woody, well... he was pretty much your typical happy go lucky kind of guy who loved his family, had outside extra curricular activities, did his job and tried to stay behind the radar and if he did questioned something, he reserved himself - just enough not to cause a ruckus.

The back and forth flashbacks of when they were partners on the force to the present day, each episode was intense and explosive in the sense where the storyline gave you the chance to delve into the darkness with both characters.  Who was this person behind the madness?  Where were the missing?  Why didn't anyone care enough to simply, take another step forward towards the truth?

It took one man who had a knack for literally ""thinking out of the box"" to come into a town and shake things up.  Yea, he was crude, seemed uncaring, but when he wrapped his head around the case, there was no turning back -- even if it meant being hated by his co-workers, saved but one who stuck up for him and even (against his own will) believed in him and his way of doing the job.

True Detective had a chance at being one of the best seasons on television ever. It was building to this tense conclusion, this monumental season mirrored by the tense traverse to and through the demented Cacosa .... and then .... you have the ending to every suspense and horror movie you've ever seen ( sprinkled with some pretty new outlook on existence from a former MVP cynic ). The previous 7 episodes of True Detective are alive and brave, but the finale is used Dentyne (the ""hero"" Marty Hart is saved just in the nick of time, and than the other hero Russ Cohle is saved by the police who inexplicably show up). I can forgive some missteps in the middle of anything, but you can't have a poor ending - it stains everything. If the writers needed to have Rust have this big conversion towards meaning, fine, have him survive and give his soliloquy to Marty's ex-wife. This would serve to comfort her and redeem Rust to himself. There was no need for Marty to live. Marty could have been shown calling the police and therefore saving Rust's life. Instead, we have a weak willed ending, where both heroes live and roll off into the starlight, and for this I will forever be disappointed with True Detective.

Unlike American Horror Story, Season 2 will feature totally new actors (or actresses) and a new story. I love it. Hopefully it keeps up the great work.",1393200000,4,366,4.397058823529412
6217714,5,B00HUCF420,"This is an absorbing and dark crime drama on HBO that only lasts 8 episodes and will have a new cast and story next season. The writing is second to none and every supporting cast member, both small and large roles, fits just right. We all know by now that McConaughey can really act. After years and years of his talents being wasted, recent films like Mud, The Wolf of Wall Street and Dallas Buyers Club have put him on a career track that few actors ever experience. His work here on True Detective is in my mind the best thing he has ever done. Just hand him the awards and get it over with. Woody Harrelson plays a great foil to his very dark view of the world and the chemistry between the two is outstanding. The beyond beautiful Alexandra Daddario has a brief but ""revealing"" role. Sorry, just had to throw that in there. Game of Thrones is my favorite show, but now HBO has a real contender to fill that Breaking Bad void in my life.",1392768000,215,942,4.268156424581005
6217715,5,B00HUCF420,"This TV show is better than most movies I've seen.  It is an intense, addictive cop drama, that redefines cop dramas.

Set over a 12 year period (1995 through 2012), the show centers on two police offers solving a brutal crime in 1995, then helping authorities working on a similar case in 2012.

From the start of the first episode of the season, this show brings the full force of its intensity to bear.  The characters have depth, and grow.  The scripts are well written, and there directing is phenominal.  Episode 4 is particularly well directed, with a gripping 8-minute long continuous shot to close the episode.",1392681600,6,619,4.738317757009346

If the episodes (1-4) are indicative of anything, this show should have a future on the cable.

Great, grittly show.

8635883,4,B00HUCF420,"May contain spoilers but not really.

I loved it.  I should have given it 5 stars. I binge watched it and I would have binge watched if it had 20 episodes.  The problem with True Detective Season 1 was the rushing over story lines (there was just so much material), especially the end and even with that is deserves 5 stars but the end just didn't live up to the rest of the season.

First the acting.  Both Woody Harrelson and Matthew Mcconaughey are fantastic.  They are experts at their craft and it really shows.  The other supporting actors good as well but not the caliber of the stars.

I really enjoyed the way the developed the characters in the first part of the season.  Gave nice back stories and showed all the main character flaws. Then they skip forward 10 years
 and at that point I felt like they rushed to the end. As though they had X number of episodes to tell the story and that is all they had period. There were a number of story lines that were rushed and felt undeveloped.  Of course it was far better than having told the story in a movie format but still. Had they taken their time... one of the best crime dramas of all time.

BTW- I couldn't even get through 2 episodes of Season 2",1531958400,,1210,4.258771929824562
