8348037,5,B001YB2BCO,"This is the story of three young people who have grown up together in the squalor of a province in the Philip[pine.  Adong (Wil Sandetias) and Melay (Ashley Silverio) love each other.  Their friend Lorenzo aka Enzo (Ken Escudero) is secretly in love with Adong.  Adong elopes with Meley to Manila and the have a daughter.  Daddy doesn't want her with Adong.  She chooses Daddy over Adong and goes back and leaves their daughter with him.  Om order to earn money he works in a gay bath house which offers extras for those willing to pay.  Lorenzo has a fight with his abusive father (who knows that Lorenzo is gay and says so to his mother) and who is also abusive to his mother as well.  Lorenzo also leaves to Manila to make his fortune.  He however does better in porno movies and escort services.  The bathhouse also gives play performances for the guests to be able to choose who they want.  One day Adong's ""co-acter"" is unavailable and they call in Lorenzo.  It is almost a comic scene when they meet in the dressing room and you see their faces as they meet again after several years.  Lorenzo is financially better off than Adong and has Adong and his daughter move in with him and watches over them like a mother hen only Adong is too dense to realize the feelings Lorenzo has for him.  I must warn you that there is a rape scene with Adong as the victim and with multiple-attackers.  Although no rape scene is a good thing, the scene is played out well and the photography. editig and music in this scene is excellent and you can feel the terror that Adong is experiencing.  Meanwhile, Daddy dies and Melay comes back to Adong.  Lorenzo finally makes his move for Adong who still is so dense he can't get it and moves out.  Finally he realizes what's what and returns to physically bond with Lorenzo.  Lorenzo is happy.  Adong and Melay go to America. Lorenzo go home to visit his mother and then leaves. Where does he go with that smile o his face?  I give this film 5 starts as I know you will enjoy it.",1404691200,,2015,4.377358490566038
8348038,3,B001YB2BCO,A little better than a lot of the DVD'ss purchased .Quality of DVD not as bad as some of the others. Might keep and might watch it again.,1366588800,2,137,3.9285714285714284
8348039,5,B001YB2BCO,This story is exceeded my expectation. Some scenes are vivid and characters are cute. I am completely satisfied with it.,1355875200,,120,5.05
8348040,3,B001YB2BCO,"Good and Bad.  the main actors were to busy trying  to not show frontal nudity that is got in the way of the story.  i think the director (darkended ) to many of the sex scenes and it really ruined the movie.
if the actors are not willing to show nudity, then it should have been recast.  Antonio's Secret is a good example of the actors dedication to what needs to be done, to do a good movie.
again, this is ok,  but you know in real life the MEN would be showing full nudity in this situtation. again, i credit the directors choice of
actors for this flaw.
still this was worth a 3 stars for all of the other actors in the film.",1242864000,13,631,4.016
