8752282,2,B01C5OL890,"Season 1 contains episodes 0 through 12 (episodes 0, 1, and 12 are double length). Episode 0 is titled Prologue and covers roughly the same events of episode 1 from Rin's point of view. Season 2 contains episodes 13 though 25 (the main story ends at 24). Episode 25 is titled Epilogue and is an original story including character cameos from other Fate merchandise.

Season 2 was not as good as season 1 so I give it only 3 stars overall. This is downgraded to 2 stars due to the outrageous price of the blu-ray box sets. I recommend watching the whole series via some alternative method of acceptable visual quality first before wasting money like I did.

Directing: 3 out of 5 stars. The story from the source material is fine but the slowed-down pacing and writing did not work for season 2. Despite having many fights, the combatants mostly stand around doing nothing and talk. Though there are supposedly more explanations of tactics and objects in the source material, these don't seem to have been used. Instead the extended dialogue is redundant and meaningless. In season 1 some of the new dialogue helped clear things up but in season 2 it's generally filler.

Drawings: 5 out of 5 stars. Roughly the same as season 1 but less consistent quality. At times the faces deviate and start to slightly resemble Code Geass, due to the 2nd and 3rd character designers having worked on it.

Animation: 3 out of 5 stars. Significantly worse and more frame saving than season 1. Nearly all the fights are lame and have a total number of frames less than Studio Deen's movie version of Unlimited Blade Works. Just talking, very little movement. A few panels don't make sense because the action has been so stripped down.

Music: 3 out of 5 stars. It does the job and has the correct atmosphere, consistent with the sound of other Fate shows. But I can't remember a single tune except the disc menu BGM, which is never used in the actual show and only played as the ending to episode 0. The Fate movie and TV series from Studio Deen had much better music (except for the second TV intro, which was horrific).

The only thing I really enjoyed was the Epilogue. Watching season 1 followed by the alternative movie version might be the best presentation. The movie is a visually impressive clip show of constant action that makes no sense in the first part, then settles into a properly paced story around where season 2 would start.

Interestingly, most of the fights in season 2 did not have the exact same outcome as the movie. Lancer beats up Archer, while in the movie Archer appeared to be winning then left. Archer and Gilgamesh seemed to let Shirou win in all of their confrontations here, while the movie portrayed Shirou as earning true victories. I don't know which interpretations are more faithful to the source material.

The menus may be animating at an incorrect frame rate and the sunny day extra doesn't remember the audio language settings, but overall this release is technically sound (it better be, at this price) so I'm willing to overlook that. Sunny day is short and sucks anyway, I was disappointed.",1528848000,,3119,4.668488160291439
8752283,5,B01C5OL890,"The final 13-25 episodes are on three discs. This is the English dubbed anime product. All standard skip points are present so if you get tired of the opening and end credits the option to skip over is available. The visuals are done very well and effects are outstanding.

Largely spoiler free.
The second installment of Fate Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works differs in almost every turn of events in comparison to the previous anime adaptation. It focuses largely on the hate relationship between Shiro Emiya and the heroic spirit Archer with flushed out reasoning. Archer is given his due with a back-story that one could not help but sympathize with his seemingly narrow minded way of thinking. The overall story also ties largely into the prequel anime Fate/Zero which is referenced enough to want to go watch but is not essential to enjoy this current story arc. Rin Tosaka continues to be given far more of the lead role as the story progresses in both combat and interpersonal relations with the main character. Saber remains vitally important but has been further reduced to more of a supporting tank and is given less screen time.

The real kicker to this piece is the last episode, the resulting aftermath of the fifth Holy Grail War. Episode 25 goes back and forth chronologically from what happened right after the war to a few years in the future with Shiro and Rin continuing their lives together in a completely new environment. Kind of like a typical magic academy setting anime if you have seen one of those. As a closure episode it does the job but more so has opened the Fate Stay Night world up for even more storytelling. New characters regard the event of the Grail War to be nothing more then another event that just happens from time to time. With a decent goodbye to the familiar settings and secondary characters, the episode is an opening for an entirely new story arc. Rin was even given a new heated rival in terms of magical arts and love interest while Shiro himself continues on the tragic path to becoming a hero of justice. This episode is seemingly a signal of the Fate Stay Night franchise possibly pulling away from its root story and continuing onward in a new direction for these characters to grow further in. With that said, I have neither found information nor read the manga on how Fate Stay Night plays out after the Holy Grail War at this time. Its a good send off if the anime production of Fate Stay Night dies here while also is a opportunity for add-ons. By no means is it in regards to that Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya spinoff nonsense.",1481932800,2,2590,4.640522875816994
