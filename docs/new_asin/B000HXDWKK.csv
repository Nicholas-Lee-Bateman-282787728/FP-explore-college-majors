8547741,5,B000HXDWKK,"This DVD offers a fabulous introduction to note-taking for students.  It's also a great refresher course for experienced researchers with poor note-taking habits.  It reminds viewers of the intimate connection between writing and thinking, and urges us to view note-taking not as mindless transcription, but as a foundation for significant research.  In essence, it asks viewers to respect past scholarship by conscientiously reading, quoting, paraphrasing and commenting on it in notes.  But it does all this with an eye on instruction.
