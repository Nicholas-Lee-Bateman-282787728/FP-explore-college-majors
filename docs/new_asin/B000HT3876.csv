2640489,5,B000HT3876,"Hi, I'm not really an Anima fan.  I prefer my video to be live action for it to be believable.  Too many times as a child cartoons would ignore normal facts, giving us monsters that had wings and flew in space. Or simply went off on tangents all over the place, making episode to make episodes without a story behind it.  Where story is only connected to the next by base characters.

  Not Planetes, It's science fiction based in fact.  When a ship in space needs to move it fires it's thruster.  Ship's that land on Earth are aerodynamic, those that don't are the best shape to do thier job, from cargo haulers with lots of big boxes to Orbital Security Agency ships that are mostly huge engines for manivering.

  As stated in the title it's a Great Story for the series over all and fom episode to episode.  It has a story ark and each episode helps out in developing that ark and or developing the characters individually from the nest recruit to old hands.

  Though there are things that aren't explained, such as, the main space station in the storie--7 what is it's main role, where/how does it make money.  Or Debris retrieval, it has the stigma of trash collectors but the importance of the national guard and bomb squad put together.

  Simply put I thoroughly enjoyed these series and think anyone who likes a good storie and realistic expectation of space travel will two.",1168128000,4,1386,4.538461538461538
2640490,5,B000HT3876,"When I first stumbled upon Planetes I was intrigued by the level of realism inherent in its story telling and technical structure.  Everything taken into account, this is probably the most realistic, down to earth science fiction story I've seen in some time.  While not giving any major plot points away, the series is about a space debris collecting agency and it does the usual anime philosophical introspection of various topics (relationships, life and death, personal dreams, working-class life, etc.).  The job of collecting garbage is space is actually a foil more often than not to give the characters a setting to go about their psychological journey through life.  What caught me off guard was the level of maturity it uses to deal with these instances.  There are no ""out of this world"" type scenarios the characters involve themselves in.  Everything that happens is completely possible within the scope of the world these people inhabit (with the MAJOR exception of one episode that involves ""ninjas""...enough said).

I highly recommend this anime to anyone interested in dramatic storytelling.  Every series has its faults, and I think the major problem in Planetes is its forceful bits of humor, which do not work most of the time and only tend to offensively bog down the more serious issues at work here (I know everything can't be doom and gloom, but there comes a time when slapstick nonsense simply does not work).  The manga is also available that actually tells a little bit of story that takes place after the series ends, which is interesting.

The final point I will make about this great series is that it actually has a good ending.  I've noticed that far too many great animes (NG:E, Berserk, etc.) simply don't know how to end correctly, and you HAVE to read the mangas in order to fully appreciate them.  Not so with Planetes.  It ends perfectly.  While it isn't the greatest science fiction anime of all time (those honors still belong to Legend of the Galactic Heroes and Crest/Banner of the Stars) this is without a doubt one of the best, possibly right on the tails of those other two masterpieces.",1167436800,22,2133,4.856353591160221
2640491,5,B000HT3876,"I was browsing at Borders, and this series caught my eye. The box art was nice, and the plot of the series seemed interesting, so I picked it up. Planetes turned out to be everything I could have hoped for, and more.

The Show:

This is an excellent series, both technically and objectively--beautiful animation (with a surprisingly high cel count, especially in zero-g sequences) is coupled with surprising technical realism and well-developed characters to create one of the best animes in years, and possibly the best science fiction anime ever. Planetes is the most realistic and inspiring vision of near-future space exploration and habitation I have ever seen. Zero-gravity environments, spacecraft, and character movement are portrayed with a level of detail and realism which far surpasses that of most series touting themselves as science fiction; because of this realism, even the tiniest details of the characters' lives take on a sense of grandeur and beauty. Even my father, a man who isn't particularly fond of anime, was greatly impressed, and found the show enjoyable. I would reccomend this series to anyone from anime newbie to veteran otaku. For a newcomer, Planetes contains most of the best possible elements of anime; good story, well-developed characters, visual beauty, a gentle dose of philosophy, and a setting which is impossible to recreate in live action. For the weary veteran, it has both plenty of what you already love, and enough new ideas to remind you of why you started watching anime in the first place.

The Product:

This box set is a cheap and easy way to collect the entire series at once. It contains every episode with both english dubbed and subbed versions (though the dub is a bit miscast), and has a few of the basic extras expected of any anime, mainly clean opening and closing credit sequences. The only real drawback of this set is the lack of some of the more interesting special features which were included in the special edition DVDs of volumes one through three (e.g. interviews with NASA professionals, orbital debris CGI models). Though these aren't critical, their absence may prompt die-hard fans to purchase the individual volumes instead, although in my oppinion, the incredibly low price of this box set is enough to warrant forgiving Bandai the omissions. If you already own some of the individual volumes then it's a toss-up, but if you don't, this set is by far the better way to go.",1164931200,30,2450,4.96829268292683
2640492,5,B000HT3876,"Although I did not purchase this particular set whole, I have watched the 6-set series and was quite impressed with the storyline.  Pretty interesting idea and although some portions are a bit sci-fi-ish, its got a really good base.  If you enjoy seeing am movie with pretty decent characters who have variety of interests, hopes, dreams and motives...you can find that all here.  There were a few dragging pieces, but overall the whole series is very good.",1156723200,7,457,4.909090909090909
2640493,4,B000HT3876,"I decided to buy this one since Bandai is going away and this one is a very good anime that didn't get popular.

In desperation, I decided to purchase Planetes bc the desciption of debri collectors in space seemed originally unique.  Theres quite a level of character development and how certain individuals mature throughout the series.

2640496,3,B000HT3876,"I'd really like to give this four stars, but I just can't quite do it. It has a lot going for it. It's more realistic than most science fiction movies or TV series you'll ever see. It brings up political issues, looking at both sides without clubbing you over the head with a single biased viewpoint. But gradually, we come to realize that the love story, which starts off as a subplot, turns out to be the main point of the series, a love story between a naive optimist (the female, of course) and the cynical pessimst. And the optimist ""wins.""

Now, if I wrote the series, I'd focus on Fee (and possibly Edel), get rid the Chief and the Assistant Manager, and demote the romance between the young lovers to a subplot.",1334275200,,719,4.406015037593985

2640498,5,B000HT3876,"Not long ago, I conducted an Internet search on the ""best anime series."" As with any such search, there were a lot of lists. As I went over some of them, Planetes kept cropping up on a number of them. I have been a fan of science fiction/space exploration stories since I was in the 6th grade and Planetes sounded like something that I'd like. Boy was I glad that I read the manga and watched this anime. As with most manga/anime combinations, I read the manga first and then watched the anime. While I found the manga very good, the anime is off the scale awesome. Those familiar with the manga will see most of the plots lines in the anime, with a few additions that I really like. My understanding is that the director and writers of the anime did not have the final volume of the manga when developing the series and had to add material to fill the entire 26 episodes. All of their decisions are, in my view, excellent ones. Across the 26 episodes, we are introduced, and get to know many characters and watch the main ones develop and grow in very believable ways. The first episode introduces us to the main characters, Ai Tanabe (a newcomer to space), Hachirota Hoshino (referred to as Hachimaki, which is headband in Japanese because he always wears one), Yuri Mihairokov, and Fee Carmichael (captain of the debris collecting space ship, Toy Box). We also meet other important characters throughout the series. Some, like Nono (a 12 year old girl born on the Moon and exceptionally tall for her age) have relatively brief appearances. All, however, are important to the overall themes of the series: our connections to others and how space exploration can strain them almost to the breaking point. The individual episodes are a combination of serious issues, like discrimination, inequality, and the power of love, to rather slap-stick comedy. I particularly liked the discussion of inequality and how the wealthy nations have the resources to exploit space for their benefit, while the poorer nations are, again, left behind. I also liked how some of the funny subplots, like the one about a group of unemployed workers pretending to be ninjas which turned very serious and moving. The series has subplots about love, terrorist plots, political maneuvering within large bureaucratic organizations, the human cost of space exploration, how smoking cigarettes can save a space station, and a family contemplating mass suicide due to crushing bills. All of them come together at the end to make this a very satisfying series. As most know, you do not have to pay for much anime or manga, given their availability online. However, I liked this series so much that I paid for the pleasure of owing a copy of it. If you believe in rewarding excellence in art, then I highly recommend that you get the manga and watch the anime. I wholeheartedly agree that this anime is one of the top 10 of all time, without any fan service or other gimmicks. (Please note that I'm not against fan service as I have given positive reviews to anime with a lot of it.) Planetes is a wonderful character driven space opera. If that is your interest in anime, than you have to see this series. A magnificent experience.",1327795200,,3202,4.7196428571428575

Anyone with an interest in space and space technology should have this series.
The storyline is your basic one of love and relationships with space being a backdrop. It's a drama but there's enough humor in it to keep things from getting too heavy.

This DVD release is the complete series with many extras. The soundtracks are the original Japanese and a very good English dub. Subtitles are accurate to the Japanese soundtrack.
The extras are spread throughout the disks and include bits of the manga, commentary as presented by one of the characters (in comic manga form), interviews with the creative staff, promos and alternative opening sequences.

2640503,5,B000HT3876,"Planetes is one of the greatest anime series of all time, and easily falls in my top 5 favorites. Everyone kept telling me to watch it, and when I finally did it surpassed my expectations, which were high to begin with.

Story: 10/10
-This is really a slice-of-life anime, meaning each episode tells the story of what happens to the characters as they live their lives and pursue their dreams. However, there are stories that weave in and out of the series, so plot isn't entirely absent.

The setting is outer space. Its the future, and mankind has developed ways of traveling easily through space. People live on the moon. You can take a trip on a rocket. The boundaries are endless! Ah, but this creates unexpected problems. Junk is floating around in the starry darkness. And if this garbage were to collide with a traveling ship, disaster would strike.

Enter the Debris section. Under-payed, unnoticed, their job is to head out into the silence and quickly collect the dangerous trash before it causes problems.

And there you go. That's the story, for the most part.

Characters: 9999999/10
-The best characters I've ever seen in an anime series. Everyone in the show is perfect. They all have their quirks, their likes and dislikes, their fears, and their pasts. Each one moves differently, has a unique personality, and has been elegantly created. As I watched I was amazed at how involved I was becoming. Their stories, their dreams, it all makes for a must-watch experience. The characters alone are enough to merit purchasing the series. Perfect.

Music: 10/10
-The music is superb and helps create the images of space in a way we don't usually see. It also helps create tension when our characters are floating around up there. There isn't any sound in space, so its just the characters and the music. Very brilliant, and very realistic.

Animation: 10/10
-Gorgeously drawn. The art rivals even Miyazaki's work, and gives a Studio Ghibli film a run for its money. Each detail can be seen, and the movement of it all is fluid. I was especially fond of the Zero G sequences. Its all realistic, and you can tell the creators of the show really did their research to try and create something noteworthy and honest.

English Dub: 10/10
-Its a fantastic dub. Tanabe might be a little high pitched sometimes, but its simply part of her charm. The dub is even better than some anime movies I've seen. Very nice.

Overall: 9999999/10

Watch it. Stop reading my review and get Planetes! You really need to, because its one of the greatest ever created, and will hold that position for many years to come. With perfect characters, an exciting and foreign setting, catchy music, humor, romance, suspense, unemployed ninjas, and good replay value, Planetes is one of the best anime around and easily one of my top 5...no, make that top 3 favorites. Its the anime series you can show to your friend who isn't familiar with the genre.

Rating: 13 and up
-Mostly accurate, though some material is even harsher than a PG-13 rating. There's plenty of language, smoking, and adult material. Violence is brief but painfully realistic and sometimes bloody. There is some sexual humor, and a few shots of a naughty magazine. Some scenes are edgy and might be uncomfortable to watch. I'd recommend the show to only those mature enough to handle it, maybe 15 and up. If it were a live-action movie it would be a harsh PG-13, possibly even R.",1273017600,,3430,4.757575757575758
2640504,3,B000HT3876,"...the Manga is a lot better.

This Review is written by someone who read the Manga first and then watched the Anime. I believe that just a small minority read the Manga before watching the Anime, and this is why Planetes (TV), is in my opinion overrated.

I believe that if I hadn't read the Manga I would score this better, but still it's a fact that this anime has flaws, and the one that i hear the most is that the crisis of the poor country, isn't convincing. Other flaws pointed out is the boring start or the sometimes annoying characters. Well If you remove those flaws and add some great character development to the story, you have the Manga.

Now my Problem is if the Staff of the anime has such great material to use, why would they bother to add ridiculous characters like the Indian clown and the chef, and add fillers like the space ninjas? It's not like they hadn't used everything from the manga, and needed fillers to complete the 26 episodes, because there removed a lot of themes that appeared in the manga.

Well at least the second half of the show (and much better one, in my opinion) follows the manga more closely. And the end, although it's different from the manga is a scene taken from it.

I understand that the studio tried to give the anime a different atmosphere then the one from the manga, but they failed. So I recommend that if you are thinking of watch this anime, go read the manga first. And for those who already watched the anime, and felt those flaws, go read the anime.

PS: If you find this review not helpful try to comment why, so I can improve my reviews. Thank you",1271462400,4,1613,4.36
2640505,4,B000HT3876,"Slow start but a really good ending. After the first two discs the actors improve and the story gets a little more complex. Not less obviously contrived but better. The main plot revolves around a romance between two of the main characters which develops over the series.

But unlike most shows where the last episode is just ""The End"" this one has a real ending that doesn't feel tacked on. I'd recommend it for that reason. After watching the whole show, I enjoyed the experience.",1254787200,2,482,4.670588235294118
2640506,5,B000HT3876,"I'm a big fan of science fiction especially the hard variety, And I wasn't disappointed. Not only was the technology realistic, so were the characters. Everything was believable, and the story telling was spot on.

Great if you're looking for an anime with a little bit of everything, love, action, suspense, drama, humor, and mystery.  I'm really drawn to space-themed anime and watched this on a whim, and fell in love and had to buy it. Highly recommend it!",1246147200,2,342,4.796610169491525
2640508,5,B000HT3876,"Sometimes an anime story comes along that manages to push exactly the right combination of buttons to appeal to nearly everyone.  Planetes is an example of this most rare and thoroughly enjoyable experience.  If you know nothing about this program the premise may seem a bit, um unimpressive in its rather narrow scope of vision.  The concept of Planetes centers on junk- no, really- space junk to be exact.  As the second half of the 21st century witnesses a humanity capable of traveling and living in space, debris that we left behind to eternally orbit the Earth has become a serious safety hazard.

Just like the men today who come around to collect our refuse from garbage cans on the street side curb each week, so too does the garbage zipping around the planet require human beings for the task of collection and disposal.  Enter our lead characters, a group of very unique individuals who come together in the stuffy office space of a large orbiting space station with the common goal of ridding the solar system of man-made debris, one piece at a time.

If the prose sounds a bit under-whelming, take heart in the fact that following along against this seemingly menial job in the grand scheme of things is perhaps the show's greatest strength.  The viewer is treated to a near-endless succession of interesting, realistic science fiction but as only the backdrop to the monotony and routine of a futuristic daily job.  Additionally the interaction between the lead cast is incredibly accurate and lifelike thanks to the fact that the nature of their jobs is established early on in terms of social status.  Pilots, managers, and just about anyone else in the organization seem to look down on the lowly debris collectors (in fact labeling the whole unit Half-Section) despite the fact that without them, space travel would be severely stifled.

The true beauty of Planetes lies simply in its realistic interpretation of the near future and a painstaking attention to small detail.  The gains made in space travel are near science-book accurate for the setting of the year 2075.  Yes, humans travel into space via pressurized aircraft (not unlike a beefed up version of a jumbo jet) and enter into pre-established orbits from there.  Sure the average person can take a vacation to the lunar surface, but it's still a four-day trip to the moon just like it is for astronauts today.  More impressive still is that the moon's distance to the planet earth is chillingly accurate as viewed from the lunar surface.  So often in fiction, the moon is portrayed as a celestial body just above the clouds.  Add the fact that earth appears a distant blue sphere from the moon's surface to the four-days travel time (at speeds of 18,000 miles per hour) and the scope of the galaxy starts to look dauntingly immense (just like it really is).

Another beautiful little scientifically correct touch is the fact that all of the external space shots are devoid of sound (since sound is after all, vibrations carried through air).  Every space scene doesn't feature a panoramic backdrop of perfectly twinkling distant stars either.  Sun light reflected from the earth's (or moon's) surface often drowns out such views in favor of simple silent blackness.

The level of technical detail is exceptional and impressive, making this one of the best of science fiction series of all time and is rivaled only by the interesting character development in the foreground.  The story focuses on Tanabe, a nave and idealistic rookie debris collector, and her budding love interest in the almost comically cynical Hachirota (who has more names than a phone book).

The high point of the show is the inner office political strains as some of the work-environment struggles take cues from classic pop-culture staples The Office and Office Space.  Couple that to a chief who knows he's useless, a die-hard temp-worker, a tough, chain smoking, and yet oddly attractive female pilot, and you have the formula for some solid interaction dynamics.

Pacing is nearly perfect as well with several episodes that are deliberately uneventful.  As such, this is truly a show that only the Japanese could have done so delicately.  American studios would have littered the prose with unnecessary action, drama, or futuristic technology (worm-holes, hyperdrives, and so on).  Instead, Planetes blends a realistic daily grind and realistic space travel with the type of awkward romance that American children experience at around the age of 12.  It may not sound like much, but somehow it works very well.

Unlike most anime, the look and shading of the characters is particularly unique.  The colors aren't especially vivid or bright but rather earth-toned and subdue which works well with the drab backdrop of life within a space station.  Those accustomed to giant, glassy eyes may be surprised to find much more realistically proportioned (and dare I say Asian) peepers here.

Like most Bandai Anime Legends collections, the set is a bit light on extras but makes up for this by offering up the entire show across 6-discs for a great price.  My only complaint about Planetes is that the show comes to an end.  Concluding the 26th episode had me wishing for another 26.",1239062400,7,5235,4.944
2640509,4,B000HT3876,"I'll definitely say this was an interesting series and I did end up enjoying it overall.  At first it felt like the characters would really get on my nerves, but as I got into them more they got less annoying to me.  Or maybe because of what they went through they got less annoying in the show.  Either way, by the end of this series I was hooked and wanted to see what happened to them!

Planetes has a very unique premise in my opinion and the show works a lot more like a sitcom rather than action or a straight drama at first.  A lot of the comedic factors are based on character personalities and how they deal with each other.  This is usually based around arguing.  The tension is based around their jobs, every day life, and what to do in emergencies.  In Planetes we follow a group of interstellar garbage collectors.  Apparently the garbage situation around Earth has gotten so bad that they need special groups called ""debris haulers"" to clean up space.  Things in space can be moving really fast, even debris like a small screw, and if it hits a passenger liner in just the right spot it could blow a hole right in the ship!  Unfortunately being a debris hauler is kind of a thankless job and this show takes place in a time when humanity is really just starting to expand into space.  There are a few large space stations that house people full time and there are couple of moon colonies, but there isn't much beyond that, so humanity's reach hasn't gone too far yet.

The story really centers on a young girl named Ai Tanabe who gets her first job in space as a debris hauler.  Some people might not like the way these astronauts kind of trivialized the profession, but if you think about it, once space travel becomes more of the norm and people living in space also becomes the norm, it's very reasonable to believe that concepts like inept middle management like we see on Earth are bound to follow!  So that's sort of the world Tanabe gets involved with.  The two managers of the debris section for the Technora Co. are kind of clueless middle managers.  The real people with the know how are the grunt workers that Tanabe will be working with.  It's kind of a spin off of office sitcoms, but in space.  However, the show does have its serious moments, especially when the reality of dealing with upper management sets in.  Greed and power are not gone now that humanity is in space.  Not to mention there is a terrorist faction out there that wants to stop humanity from spreading into space!  So while this series seemed to start off as a happy comedy it takes a drastically serious turn towards the end.  I at first thought it would be marketed towards the fairly young, but by the end I can confidently say that it gets very adult themed or at least more mature like mid to late teenage years.

The overall message is an overly sappy one about love, but the anime goes through dark enough trials that I can kind of forgive this kind of a closing.  There are a lot of messages that go beyond that of finding those who love you and this makes this anime even more worthwhile.  One that I particularly liked was the tangent on following your dreams.  Are you doing them on a realistic level, is it just an ideal, and are you afraid if you don't achieve them?  These kinds of concepts kind of hit home to me, but I really did like seeing the character deal with those issues.  I can't pinpoint where the show precisely changed from what appears to be a comedic sitcom to a deep drama, but it does happen.  That may sound like a poor writing technique, but I think Planetes pulled this off well.  It also allowed for some serious twists and turns that I never even could have guessed!

In the end the story has its very cheerful and hopeful moments amidst large amounts of tragedy that befall people.  I like this very realistic approach, because it's not all happy fantasy out in space.  It gives that touch of reality that not everyone in the world is benevolent and sometimes people just get lost.  The harsh reality is that people do die and sometimes it's at the consequence of wanting to progress.  Even in Planetes the human race is already looking beyond the moon and wants to harvest energy on Jupiter!  So there's always a push for progression.  So this is a pretty enjoyable series overall.  It didn't blow me away and I wouldn't say this is the greatest thing I've ever seen, but it certainly did entertain me while I watched it.  This is the first one I've watched that Bandai put out and I have to say that I'm a little less than impressed with the packaging.  I like it in the sense that it definitely saves room because it's in a single oversized DVD case which houses all six discs.  However, the quality of the products that Funimation and ADV put out are just better in my opinion.  And for the other Bandai products I have there is also no booklet at all and I really like the ones I have that come with a booklet.  Maybe it's just me, but I just think the other companies put out a better product.  Either way, that really doesn't detract from the real quality of the show!",1217203200,2,5112,4.391489361702128
2640510,3,B000HT3876,"If you like Hollywood Horse-feathers, I guess this is well done. Frankly, I think it should have been darker and grittier. The 'all you need is love to salve the hearts of the disenfranchised and dead' message is worthless. The dialog and plot are worthless for the same reasons. I have the same problem with this series that I have with most horror: if you have the antagonist down... kill him, cut his throat, put a bullet in his head and scatter his limbs to the four winds. If someone just slaughtered your friends: philosophical questions about what you should do now are answered. Period. Kill anyone responsible. The garbage hand-wringing regarding the cost of exploring space is specious at best. We're all dead no matter what may come, and all of humanity is dead if we don't get off this planet.

Planates is a well animated series; however, the annoying characters and their contrived moral confusion are not worth watching. I fail to believe that our descendants will not be smarter than this series. All or any one of us would not react in the fractious manners displayed in this series given the scenarios presented the characters.

Oh, gee, people are dying! They already are, and we still explore space. Oh, people are abused: that's not going to stop. And the abused and disenfranchised are not going to cease belonging to that group. I suppose that my dislike of this series is related to my love of its potential.

Planates could have been a great, gritty scifi series on par wiith Ghost in the Shell. But Planates springs for sappiness when GITS works toward: grit, plot, and characterization.

I consider this worth watching with serious reservations.",1212883200,7,1672,4.815331010452962

2640512,4,B000HT3876,"as a fan of the original manga, I was pleasantly surprised by the transition to anime; they've vastly increased the cast, and changed some of the emphasis in the plot to draw from additional themes like Japanese office ettiquette, behind the scenes corporate maneouverings and the messy state of geopolitics. Some elements seem to be there just to pad things out, others are actually quite interesting takes on the original plots. The Planetes take on life as an orbital garbage collector is as keen as ever, with a deft touch on the hard sci-fi angle (their discussions appear plausible without bombing the viewer with the underlying maths). there are worse ways to spend your time:)",1208649600,,684,4.956521739130435
2640513,5,B000HT3876,"No sci-fi fan should overlook this title, no matter if they are an anime afficianado or not.  Superb characterization and excellent voice acting lend to a likeable cast of characters.  While this is not your one series, one plot style of anime, the stand alone style of the episodes works well for this series.  My particular favorite involves a group of wanna-be ninjas living in a colony on the moon.  It sounds odd...and it is, but it is hilarious nonetheless.  What better than a shuriuken attack using not a metal ninja star, but a very small man contorted into a ninja star shape?  I guess you have to see it to believe it!

The show sports some of the finest animation to date.  Though the music is not very lively or dramatic, it works well enough.

Do not blow this off as a comedy though, there are great moments of sadness, conflict, despair, and suspense.  A sure classic that is unfortunately going to be widely overlooked in the US due to the 'Space debris collection' job the characters are employed in and the lack of excitement generated by it.

Ai Tanabe, a plucky, awkward girl comes to Technora Co. Debris Section full of youthful idealism, and is immediately paired with Hashirota Hoshino, a proud, resentful young man, and  the bulk of the story is tied to Tanabe's loss of innocence about the realities of life in space and Hashirota recapturing his.

What's wonderful is how the world of 207? is fleshed out, from the culturelessness of the Lunar colonies, to the terrorist threat of those opposed to the expansion of humanity into the solar system, and the ethical questions of progress while third world countries still languish in poverty.

2640519,5,B000HT3876,"Planetes is one of the greatest drama series ever created, though you might not think so from it's outward appearance. In this age of information, western audiences scream for ever greater realism, grittiness, and violence, focusing on sacrifice and suffering and at the same time forgetting the purpose that it serves. The world of animation, and particularly the animation pouring out of Japan in a raging torrent, is largely popular for it's flash and not for it's substance, despite the fact that substance is there in ample quality for the discerning viewer.

And where does Planetes come in? Planetes is an anime with the styling of a realistic Western Drama, a Realistic Epic set in the not-too-distant future that focuses on the people, their sacrifice, their world, and greater ideals and yearnings that it serves.

You could say that Planetes (which is Greek for Wanderers) is simply a story about astronauts in space collecting debris garbage. But this show is SO much more than that.

The first time I saw this show, I was very off-put by the first episode, as it starts out like so many anime, with Japanese quirkiness and awkwardness, but very quickly hints at something far greater. From the very first episode we are shown a world of great ideals and dreams, of righteous beliefs just under the surface of the unfair world if only you can look for it. Throughout the show this same theme resonates again and again, being attacked but never thwarted by the never-ending cruelty of reality. It takes many forms, from from not wanting to destroy a peace plaque to protect a satellite of war, to helping people from a tiny third-world country test their space suit and get it certified for space-worthiness even as the world government seizes the country and it's representatives in space.

While the heart-touching (and at times heart-wrenching) ideals keep coming up, it's the characters who embody these choices of practical vs.idealistic conflict that give the show it's heart. Almost every major character in the show gets character development time, showing why they are the way that they are. As their stories unfold before our eyes and we gain insight into their feelings, we come to identify with and sympathize with their feelings. I can think of no better example of this then the Russian astronaut's story wherein (spoiler alert) we learn of the death of his dear wife, and how one small trinket she had on her when she died drives him to search through the debris of space endlessly to find the message written inside. When he finally finds the item (a compass) and sees the message inside, I think it was one of the most profound moments of any drama I had ever seen. Have you ever had a premonition of tragedy to come, have you ever wished for the safety and happiness of someone you love? Have you ever had to move past losing a person you love to live life again? Such was the struggle of a single character in a single episode!

There are many subplots which continue simultaneously, from the idealistic astronaut's arguing and (spoilers again) eventually love for the seemingly cynical rough talking astronaut (who despite all appearances is actually just as idealistic as she is) to the struggle between the terrorists seeking to destroy all space travel and the world government taking advantage of small nations. And as the series progresses, you may find yourself, like me, wondering just where it is going. Rest assured, while it may seem to derail toward the end, destiny pushes events to a head, and ultimately toward one of the most satisfying conclusions to any anime I can recall.

I could talk about the dramatic music, the historical opening, the pastel colored highly-detailed animation, the incredible realism (no sound in space!), the superb voice-acting in the Japanese dub, the INCREDIBLE drama in the final episodes (the most dramatic moment in any television show I have seen comes in an episode where the main protagonist is stranded on the moon with a terrorist, and has the choice of stealing her air, or dying a horrible death from oxygen starvation {watching the seconds tick down as she stares at the oxygen tanks, flashes of everything she has ever said about love and sacrifice playing through her head had me worked up more than I can ever remember being from a TV show}). Really though, any fan of serious animated drama, or just drama in general owes it to their self  to give this show a watch. It was undoubtedly the greatest show produced that year, and one of the best anime I have ever seen. The world would be a better place if more people watched shows like Planetes.",1183334400,44,4635,4.815326633165829

No, in Planetes you'll find newtonian physics, chemical fuels that actually run out, the effects of radiation and microgravity on the human body, and a host of other real world concerns.

2640522,5,B000HT3876,"A 12 year old girl, born in space, whose bones are so fragile she can never land on Earth. Astronauts who have lived in space so long hard radiation has riddled their bodies with cancer. Hard men making hard decisions, unsympathetic bastards who nonetheless drive the engine of progress. This is quite simply one of the best shows I've ever seen. It deals maturely with a great deal of unresolvable issues, including the human drive towards exploration, the personality and sacrifices of the explorers, and perhaps most importantly, who exploration benefits.

Planetes is set against the backdrop of a very basic extrapolation of our world. The overarching plot involves orbital terrorism and humanity's first drive towards Jupiter. The rich countries, who would benefit from Jupiter's exploitation as a limitless source of cheap fuel, and the poor countries, who having no military or political strength will probably never benefit. This show is as much about our world as about a possible world 100 years from now.

Perhaps I've made it sound like a dry, ptolemic drama, though that is far from the truth. The first DVD contains quite a bit of humor and doesn't introduce the main plot points at all, a humor much of the series maintains even as it exposes us to the human costs of exploration.

8141108,5,B000HT3876,"I had a reservations about purchasing this show for more than 3x my normal spending on random shows I've had never seen before, but after doing a fair amount of research, I was really intrigued by the concept and the ideas that would eventually unfold. Seeing as how the nearest price was more than 4x times more than the amount I was about to purchase it for, and I couldn't find any other listings on the internet in English, I thought I was getting a steal.

I'm so glad I made that gamble because I love this show!  Plus, the ""Very Good"" condition that it was listed under was only in reference to the cover, because the disc themselves were pristine. Thank you Goodwill Books!

The illustrations are beautiful with detail to all the material, like the suits and ships, with an ""as-human"" as can be interpretation of the characters. Everything feels real as if it were truly captured in time by an artist's pen. It's fluid and I never felt as if it were choppy or jarring. It doesn't rely on common anime tropes like action lines or unrealistic compositions. The color has realistic tones and it mimes the feeling of the never-ending space at those moments the characters are experiencing it for themselves.

I'm a huge fan of space, so I was quite impressed when there was no audio during any of the action sequences EXCEPT when the characters had direct contact with the surface of an object colliding with another. This is effective at isolating people at those right moments. That realism of being completely oblivious to something dangerous right behind a character was genuine and made me fright a few times at those near misses. The opening and closing scores weren't particularly my favorite, but they seemed appropriate. I listen to most anime in English without the subs, and I was really happy that I didn't have to to cringe at the voice acting. It was all very pleasant to listen too and I, again, felt like these were real people there in that moment.

The story was something I hadn't experienced before and it was nice that I couldn't guess accurately what was going to happen. Simply put, they are space garbage men who find themselves in unique positions throughout the stretch of the show, and they experience the darker side of humanity from the vantage of space. The episodes touch on each of the main characters' backstory, but it mainly follows the progress of Hachimaki toward his goal of owning his own space ship through the eyes of the new recruit Tanabe, with her idealistic view point of the how the world should be.  It's an obvious love setup, but the hiccups that the two experience are completely unique and it felt like a real relationship. There are multiple story arcs that transfer nicely into one another; touching on personal issues like self-doubt, personal sacrifice, and space-isolation; and global issues like who really benefits from space travel compared to those hurt by it. How would it be best to take care of the homeless in space? What do you really say to those that you leave behind? How would you introduce yourself to the child you left behind after so many years in deep space? However deep the subject matter, the writers and actors really make the subjects approachable without over doing it. The question is asked, maybe answered, but mostly they simply leave the question hanging for the viewer to answer for themselves.

I read numerous times that the story was slow to start-up, but I never got that feeling because they were fleshing out the the characters before the final story arc started to unfold. Honestly, I think this was the biggest highlight for the show; the Characters. You know every one of them by name and they are all used very skillfully throughout the show. Usually I forget the periphery characters almost immediately after viewing the show, but I recall them all with admiration. Hachimaki is experienced in the ways of space, but otherwise he is so jaded by his own goal that it creates conflict and confusion throughout the show. Tanabe's naive personality acts as a good offset to Hachimaki, and her sense of ""love"" sounds contrived sometimes, but ultimately feel genuine. Fee, the pilot, is the glue that keeps them all focused drawing from her own veteran experience in space. Yuri is the voice of wisdom in many cases once you've figured out his tragic past. The Chief and Robbie are colorful and a little unbelievable at times, but are very fun to balance out the serious moments of the show. Many more identifiable characters like Claire, Nono, Edel, and Gigalt. They all feel real. I don't think I can put more emphasis on how simply well crafted these characters are and their impact on the story at hand.

This show had appeared on my radar way back when it was available in stores, but the premise didn't sound appealing and I now regret never having picked it up. It is truly a artfully crafted vision of space in the future, much like Outlaw Star, but much more closer to home and with believable turmoils beyond just maintaining a job and terrorism. It hits on the many huge dangers of space like being cutoff from the parent ship and left to die alone floating helplessly, or the eventual cancer after decades of exposure to cosmic radiation. The simplest mistake could lead to a partner's death, and the smallest bit of debris could be a lethal projectile. The production values are high and it feels crisp and new despite having been on the market for over a decade. You'll fall in love with the characters and pray for their safe return after the enormous final climax. Why it never received a better reception, I can understand if you had only read the brief summary on the case; but, I would hope after having so many great reviews over the years, Planetes will get a second chance to make some traction and rise to the Star status it deserves.",1428278400,2,5851,4.684824902723736
