8200108,5,B000REQTCC,"Don't be fooled by CIA planted negative reviews, this is a must see for UFO collectors seeking hidden knowledge! This isn't hollywood, but the combined efforts of dedicated MUFON, CA. members seeking to reveal a secret government program to breed a new race of humans who will rule the world after the coming man-made Apocalypse.",1301097600,,329,5.0
8200109,5,B000REQTCC,"This film takes the docu-drama format to the next level. Revealing the nature of 9 species of aliens, this film includes special animated effects to show the extent of the technology being reverse engineered by the U.S. Government as a result of the Roswell crash coverup. If you are offended by the idea of alien/human interbreeding, do not watch this film! Alien love secrets are revealed!",1185062400,,391,4.9393939393939394
8200110,1,B000REQTCC,Absolutely awful production values. Acting was dreadful all around. The writing was confusing. The editing was some of the worst I've ever seen. Save your money. One of the top 10 worst films I've ever seen.,1184544000,,207,4.777777777777778
