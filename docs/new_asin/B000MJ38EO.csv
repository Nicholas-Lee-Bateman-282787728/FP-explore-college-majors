And they were depicting old slave characters like Harriet Tubman and many others not that I don't love my heritage but man, it was bad acting, not the greatest singers and to top it off it was narrated, OMG.  Unfortunately I was very disappointed in the company that sell it to me, because they knew it was a piece of junk, poorly written and horribly displayed on stage. They did not like it so they wanted to push it off on others like myself.  So when you purchase DVD's/VHS items make sure you have seen them and want to add them to your collection like me or you got a good review from a friend because you will end up purchasing a DVD for 29.99 plus tax like I have and not getting your monies worth.",1288310400,,893,4.120689655172414
8325416,1,B000MJ38EO,This play was horrible.  The acting was bad and the sound terrible.  Save your money as this dvd is a piece of junk.  Maybe if someone else produced it and get better actors it may be okay.,1196812800,,189,4.054054054054054

Hear music from your favorite artists and see a show that will have you Rockin', Jumpin' and Shoutin'.  You've Got to See It!!! Owning this movie will be one of the best investments you could ever make. You'll see what I mean after you watch the show.",1168387200,7,398,4.364864864864865
