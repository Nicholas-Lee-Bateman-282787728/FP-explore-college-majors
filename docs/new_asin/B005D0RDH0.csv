4655212,5,B005D0RDH0,"If this film can claim nothing else, it's assuredly the most violent circus movie ever. And it's one of the best films I've seen so far this year. It's definitely not for all tastes; you'll need a high tolerance for over-the-top, operatic storytelling and extreme imagery, but it's definitely a masterpiece of visual imagination.

The director is Alex de la Iglesia, who I'm completely unfamiliar with. His directing style is reminiscent of Jean-Pierre Jeunet's (Micmacs, Amelie), both men filling their films with outlandish and striking images, and characters who are as odd and eccentric as the visuals.

The Last Circus begins in Madrid in 1937 in the early stages of the Spanish Civil War. A Republican Army officer pressgangs all the men in a circus troupe to fight against the fascist Nationalists, and in the ensuing battle a circus clown is captured. He and other prisoners are put to work after the war building an enormous monument to the Nationalist war dead. The clown's son, Javier, tries to rescue him, but his father is killed during the escape. Before dying, Javier's father tells him to seek revenge. The story now jumps to 1973 as Javier, now a blobby man in his 40s, joins a circus as the ""sad"" clown. The ""happy"" clown is Sergio, an absolute brute who drinks and beats his girlfriend Natalia. Sergio is the star attraction of the circus. Javier falls for Natalia and attracts the wrath of Sergio. The rest of the story is better seen than described.

Iglesia tells his story in images, and his inventiveness never flags. The opening credits and the initial battle form the most visually dynamic opening sequence I've seen in years, and the final ten minutes or so are just as strong. Iglesia doesn't just string together eye-catching scenes for their own sake; he maintains a strong storyline throughout, albeit it's a story that can be a bit loopy and improbable. The only problem with this film is that it's filled, I assume, with political commentary and symbolism that's completely opaque to a non-Spaniard such as myself. This didn't lessen my enjoyment of the film, it just annoyed me to think that if I was Spanish I'd be enjoying it even more. The Last Circus is one of those films that celebrates that fact that film is a visual medium first and foremost, and not just a recording device for dialogue and images cooked up in a computer.

4655214,4,B005D0RDH0,"Gordon Sullivan, DVD Verdict --After a few opening moments of clowning, a military man shows up to conscript the clowns. Once they're conscripted, director Alex de la Iglesia unleashes an action scene that's equal parts Quentin Tarantino and Federico Fellini. He keeps his happy clown (and the rest of the circus troupe) in circus garb as the conscripted troops fight the fascist rebels. We watch as this clown--armed with a machete--cuts down soldier after soldier before being wounded. It's a carnivalesque version of Saving Private Ryan as directed by Alejandro Jodorowsky, a kind of fever-dream of the fight against fascism. Truth be told, this paragraph will tell you everything you need to know about whether to see The Last Circus. If the idea of Fellini and Tarantino collaborating on a remake of Saving Private Ryan sounds like a good idea to you, then chances are this is for you.

Of course it's not all slow-mo fighting and clowns wielding machetes. The film is also about the legacy of Franco's regime, forbidden love, and the vanishing art of the circus--all that, and a clown-versus-clown showdown. The Last Circus is stuffed to the brim--with violence, with color, and with plot. Yet, it never feels as schizophrenic as it sounds, effortlessly taking the viewer from 1937 to the early 1970s and the growing relationship between Javier and his acrobatic love interest.

All of the various plot points--from the circus to Franco's soldiers--allows de la Iglesia to indulge in his frankly beautiful visual style. The whole film appears to be decaying before our very eyes, with crumbling structures and desaturated colors, while the compositions are framed like paintings. Even if the idea of warring clowns sounds terrible, de la Iglesia has shot his mad tale beautifully.

That beauty is translated perfectly to this Blu-ray release. The 2.35:1 AVC-encoded transfer is stunning. The Last Circus was shot digitally, so this is a digital-to-digital port, and I can't imagine it looking better. Detail is strong throughout, from the patterns in the clown suits to the cracks in their white makeup, while color is perfectly saturated (though not particularly realistic). Black levels remain consistent and deep, and no artifacting shows up to mar the image. The tiniest bit of noise crops up in darker scenes, but that's probably not the fault of this transfer. The audio lives up to the quality of the video with this release. The DTS-HD Spanish language surround track (an English dub with the same specs is available) sounds remarkable. The explosions and action scenes have heft, while the film also makes good use of the soundscape, with good surround activity and left-to-right panning. Dialogue is crisp and clear, primarily out of the center channel.

The extras are not quite as stunning, but give some solid info on how the film works technically. We get a 15-minute making of, and a pair of behind-the-scenes featurettes, followed by some info on the film's (copious) visual effects. Finally, the disc includes the U.S. trailer, its international counterpart, and an international teaser.

4655215,4,B005D0RDH0,"""The Last Circus""
(Magnolia Home Entertainment, 2011)

If you have a friend, or girlfriend, who doesn't like clowns and thinks that they're creepy, don't take them to see this film, thinking it'll help cure them. This dark Spanish action/tragicomedy tells the tale of two clowns, one a sociopathic abuser of women (the funny one, who makes kids laugh) and another whose father -- also a clown -- was killed by Franco's police after the Spanish Civil War.  Javier is the sad clown, instructed to avenge his father, but unable to do it and consigned to a life as a nervous nebbish... That is, until he falls in love with the other clown's seductive, masochistic girlfriend, a path that leads to a kaleidoscopic welter of madness and violence.  The first half of the film has surreal touches, but is almost a straight tragicomedy -- in the second half it leaps over the abyss into blood-soaked absurdism.  There is an insane mishmash of stories, with hints of ""The Most Dangerous Game,"" ""The Blue Angel,"" ""Phantom Of The Opera,"" ""The Crow,"" various Hitchcock finales and every evil clown movie ever made. It's fascinating, grotesque and will test the endurance of many a viewer.  For the right kind of viewer, it'll be a real thrill.",1318809600,19,1230,4.81042654028436
4655216,4,B005D0RDH0,"Crazy indeed is cult director Alex de la Iglesia's 2010 Venice Film Festival winner about two clowns - one sad and one happy - who enter into a bizarre and memorable love triangle.  Set during the brutal Spanish Civil War as well as the end of Franco's regime, the demented parable is like an amalgam of Fellini, Del Toro, Hitchcock with a  pinch of Burton and more than a twist of German Expressionism.  Often nightmarishly absurd, shocking and irreverent, the visually rich cinematic tapestry defies a singular interpretation and like all great -- or even good -- art, sticks in the mind long after it is experienced.",1318723200,25,619,4.766355140186916
4655217,4,B005D0RDH0,"When you sit down to watch The Last Circus, you should go in not knowing what to expect. That mindset is your best bet at enjoying this film to the fullest. In fact, I encourage you to jump to the last paragraph of this review and then read the rest after your first viewing. It has quite a reputation going for it; a reputation that is mostly positive. Avoiding trailers and only having a vague knowledge of a movie is so rare these days and with a film like this it just pays off so well. lex de la Iglesia is a name I wasn't familiar with until now and while The Last Circus did seem to fizzle out a bit near its finale, it's still very absorbing, gloriously disturbing, and a solid effort from Iglesia.

The Last Circus tells a love story that is centered on revenge; it's demented and rather on the gruesome side but love is the central theme along with elements of revenge, horror, and dark comedy. The film's rich visuals will suck you in right away. It has this unique look to it; color seems to be completely drained from the film the majority of the time yet things like blood, makeup, and rather intricate costumes seem to leap off the screen in exquisite color. It's all very surreal and seems to be on the verge of becoming a nightmare at all times, so when it does finally venture into a dream sequence with nightmarish tendencies it's rather extraordinary.

The score is also pretty spectacular. The triumphant music that plays over the opening credits seems to give you the sensation that you're marching toward your death while the pounding keys of the piano during the tunnel sequence practically rattles your bones. It's kind of intriguing how similar Sergio (Antonio de la Torre) and Javier (Carlos Areces) turn out to be and it's all thanks to Natalia (Carolina Bang). Javier is so unsure of himself at first, is kind of pathetic, and a complete coward at his core but that changes once he meets Natalia. Sergio is short-tempered, an alcoholic, and his violent outbursts usually cause one or more to end up in the hospital when things don't go his way. Sergio's story becomes really interesting since it seems to borrow heavily from both The Phantom of the Opera and Frankenstein. Natalia on the other hand just doesn't seem to know what she wants. She loves the way Sergio makes love to her, but feels safe with Javier. She's truly torn between the two monsters she inadvertently creats.

Keep an eye out for a trumpet and an iron as they both become nearly as iconic as the hammer was in Oldboy. The Last Circus has a way of putting its viewer on edge with a sense of discomfort and uneasiness never being far away. The restaurant scene is a prime example, which also shows how messed up Sergio really is and eventually leads to one of the most awkward and off-putting sex scenes in recent memory. Some of the computer generated effects got a little overboard in the latter half and seemed to slightly sour my opinion of the film. However after watching the special features, it's truly amazing how much of the film was created with digital effects.

The Last Circus is like a one-sided coin featuring tragedy on both sides and the final scene seems to illustrate this point perfectly. Its surreal visuals make the film a real treat to look at and the haunting score is both memorable and beautiful in a sinister kind of way. With its nearly seamless use of practical and computer generated effects and the way the entire film seems to be covered in a veil of unpredictability, The Last Circus is a unique vision into circus life that's mostly calamitous yet visually stimulating.

Special features are pretty slim, but still interesting. Making of The Last Circus is a fifteen minute featurette that takes you behind the scenes of the film. It's here that you begin to realize how much of the film was filmed in front of the green screen as the cast comments on what it's like to work with lex de la Iglesia. Behind the Scenes Segments is more of the same type of footage presented as a seven and a half minute montage. Visual Effects is really cool. It's ten minutes long and compares the final version of the film to what was shot in front of the green screen. It literally takes you through step by step of the digital effects. It also informs you that there were 47 digital artists and post-production took two months. The U.S. Trailer, International Trailer, and International Teaser round out the special features.

The film looks completely stunning in 1080P High Definition presented in a 16x9 (2.35:1) aspect ratio and sounds fantastic in its Spanish 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio.",1318550400,2,4608,4.606577344701583

Sep 18, 2011
It's hard to compare ""The Last Circus"" to other films, though it's not an impossible task to find some similarities or homages to other cinematic works littered across the Alex De La Iglesia directed Spanish-language picture.

The story begins in 1937 where a happy clown is forced to join a bloody battle during a children's performance while still in make-up, handed only a machete, and massacres a whole platoon single-handedly. Jump to 1973, the son of the Happy Clown, Javier, attempts to follow in his footsteps, but, at the suggestion of his father, instead takes up a career as a Sad Clown. Joining a small circus, he is welcomed with open arms by all but his counterpart, the local Happy Clown, Sergio. Thrown head-first into a weird and twisted sort of love-triangle, Sergio and Javier must somehow learn to come to terms with each other's differences or destroy everything that stands between them, including themselves.

The theatrical trailers establish it's serious tone, but completely allude to the fact that this movie is a dark comedy. It's this subjective humor that lightens the incredibly grim storytelling while also serving as the propellant to the next disturbing moment in the grand scheme of things to unravel.

The orchestral score is incredible and only serves to heighten the tension before suddenly jarring you about like a couple of beans in a tin can. The source cues were appropriately selected. One in particular, ""Balada Triste de Trompeta*"" (""A Sad Trumpet Balad"") by Raphael serves to drive the film's plot forward.
*The original footage for this song can be found on YouTube, which really should be watched to fully appreciate one of the film's crowning moments, in terms of directing.

The makeup team should definitely be nominated this coming Academy Awards for their tremendous work on both Sergio's Happy Clown and Javier's Sad Clown. I don't forsee their likenesses escaping my thoughts anytime soon.

Where the film may falter is at brief moments of certain special effects, which aren't horribly done, but distract you just long enough to remind you that you are still watching a film. Also worth noting is that at some moments the translation may come off as cheesy, maybe simplistic, which becomes obvious almost instantly when the title of the film, ""Balada Triste de Trompeta"" is subtitled as ""The Last Circus"". Like any great foreign film though, you forget you're reading dialogue five minutes in and are strapped in until the very end.

Three-quarters of the way through, my impression for the film was almost skeptical of it's worth for it's several ""Best Picture"" nominations from various film committees. Sure it's entertaining and the elements were there, the antoganist/protagonist dynamic was uniquely refreshing, but where was that defining moment? The part that makes you say ""WOW, I'm glad I watched this"". That defining moment lies within the final five minutes, where everything comes full circle, opens your eyes, and makes you shake your head in disbelief of how poetic this masterpiece ends up becoming.

""The Last Circus"" is a bloody fairytale that manages to escape playing-it-safe and swings-for-the-fences. Does it strike out or hit a home-run? This film will absolutely polorize opinion, not unlike what ""No Country for Old Men"" did. Did I somehow find a way to compare it to the 2007 Best Picture Academy Award Winner?

A good majority of my movies are in subtitles but with this one I found myself having to pause often to understand what was going on because for me it went by quickly. Other than that I enjoyed it very much, it's definitely not a movie for everyone, but for those into foreign films and don't mind a little bit of blood.

There is a great deal of potential to this film but it apparently was not in the hands of the right director/writer to achieve what it should have been. The idea of a crazed clown was amusing but there is such little character development and a total lack of emotional depth that I did not care what happened to the character. The arc of the story is poorly handled and contrived. The contrast of Spain's history under Franco and the plot had no impact or correlation. Why the judges at Venice found this to be worthy of the Silver Lion I can not imagine. I have not seen the auteur's other works and most likely will not seek them out based on this grim hodgepodge of a film.,1354147200,3,717,4.318518518518519
4655261,4,B005D0RDH0,"Balada Triste de Trompeta (lex de la Iglesia, 2010)

It's actually been a couple of months since I watched lex de la Iglesia's Balada Triste de Trompeta, released in English-speaking countries as The Last Circus, and I've been having problems coming up with words to describe this movie. It defies genre, pinballing between war, comedy, thriller, romance, drama, and action without ever jarring. It is well-written, well-plotted, and well-presented, with the kind of eye to detail that got it nominated in every major category, and most of the minor ones, at the Goya Awards (it won two--for makeup and for special effects--and was nominated for an incredible thirteen more, including Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director, and Best Cinematography; it lost in most categories to Pa Negre [the exception, best actor, went to Javier Bardem in Biutiful]). More to the point: all of the accolades are well-deserved indeed. De la Iglesia turned in one of the best films of 2010, hands down, with this absurd romp through the last seventy years of Spanish history.

We open in 1937, at a circus, where Andrs (Los Lunes al Sol`s Enrique Villn), a happy clown, and his straight man, a sad clown, are in the middle of a skit when rebel soldiers burst in and forcibly draft Andrs, handing him a machete and sending him after a battalion of Franco's army. In a scene obviously (and hilariously) lifted from the climax of Platoon, Andrs, still dressed in clown drag, charges a machine-gun nest, then dispatches the entire battalion before being taken prisoner by Franco's men. Andrs leaves behind a son, Javier (played as an adult by Game of Werewolves` Carlos Areces), who by 1973 has decided to try and follow in his father's footsteps and become a clown himself. However, Javier, whose life has been difficult, cannot be a happy clown--he is only fit to be a sad clown, and even then, only in a second-string travelling troupe run by drunk, sadistic Sergio (Volver`s Antonio de la Torre), a happy clown himself when he's not guzzling liquor and smacking people around. Sergio's girlfriend, wire-walker Natalia (As Luck Would Have It`s Carolina Bang), takes pity on the sad clown, and the two of them strike up a friendship...which could be dangerous, or even deadly, if it turns into something more.

No plot synopsis can even begin to do this movie justice, however, because there is so, so much more to it than plot. Ever since Tod Browning, circus troupes have been wonderful places to stock crazy, quirky characters in movies, and Balada Triste de Trompeta is no exception (the human cannonball, who gets so precious little screen time, is hysterical in every scene where he appears, for example). Actors and writer/director alike have done a sterling job with this, and of course one cannot forget the rest of the crew--everyone from DP Kiko de la Rica (Sex and Luca) to... hell, I don't know, the caterer?...helped make this into the fantastic movie it is. Overcome your fear of clowns--it's worth it. ****",1351900800,,3019,4.915686274509804

4655263,4,B005D0RDH0,"The Last Circus, or as it's entitled in spanish A Sad Trumpet Ballad, gives what I've come to expect from Magnet films. Superd effects, graphic violence, and dark humor. The Last Circus is a difficult movie to review as it plays on a level of insanity not found in many other films. Movies like Ichi the Killer and A Clockwork Orange, while both insane, are insane in a specific way. The Last Circus provides insanity the way it is in reality, with very little sense. Basically, the fight for love between to opposites of men forces each to the breaking point. A sad clown who is twisted by his mind and a ""happy"" clown who can't face the way life falls around him battle over the love of a dancer in their circus group.
A very well made film it doesn't quite have the emotional resonance I feel it was reaching for. Still, a very solid film with surprisingly good acting and, as stated, fantastic effects, it is a film with looking at for anyone who is a fan of horror or disturbing oddities.",1343260800,4,993,4.4021739130434785
4655264,2,B005D0RDH0,"Having admired and enjoyed a lot of Spanish director Alex de la Iglesia's previous movies (especially Ferpect Crime, 800 bullets and La Comunidad), I found this last film of him to be very disappointing. The movie starts with a brief prologue during the Spanish civil war, but then moves on to 1973: it's basically about a newcomer clown to a pathetic circus who arouses the jealousy of the dangerously crazy head clown who thinks he might be after his not too bright woman. The fights between them will increasingly become more violent and grotesque. Since I don't recall their names right now, I call the three main characters in the movie, Sad Clown, Psycho Clown and Dumb Girl. Psycho Clown constantly beats Dumb Girl, but this is played for laughs in the movie which makes me wonder why the director thinks that domestic violence is funny. All three protagonists are extremely unlikable, almost repulsive, so we could not care less of what happens to them. Several aspects of Spanish 20th century history serve as backdrop to the action here but they don't add anything to the film, they seem gratuitous additions. (As an aside, chronologically, the movie doesn't add up: Sad Clown was a child around of around 10 in the 1930s, so he must be in his late forties in the second part of the movie, yet he looks like he is still in his twenties). Worst, Alex is copying himself: The idea of two rival comedians fighting each other like mad against a backdrop of recent Spanish history was already in Muertos de Miedo, which was not his best film but is much better than this (and with better actors, another problem of this movie is the poor acting, with the exception of the guy playing Psycho Clown). As in that movie, there are references to Spanish customs and popular culture of the 1970s (movies, TV shows, etc) that are probably moving to the director (who was a child during that time) but that left me and I suppose many other viewers cold. And as in Ferpect Crime, the movie ends in a homage to Hitchcock (which by now is a clich&eacute; among cinephile directors). So, in summary, I can't really recommend this, despite the expectations I had seeing this.",1341273600,,2167,4.675392670157068

4655268,1,B005D0RDH0,"The Last Circus is a horrible movie. To note, this is not being written by anyone that finds violence abhorring or is shocked by sex or even lacks the creative ineptitude to understand deeply rooted symbolism; but instead this is being said by a film watcher who witnessed a mismatched blend of creative and visuals in a film that should (nay, needed) to have been worthier of the Silver Lion at the Venice Film Festival. There is no denying that Alex de la Inglesia is a notable filmmaker, but The Last Circus is not the director's tipping hat. From the moment our sad clown (Javier) hears an unfunny joke by the supposed ""happy"" clown (Sergio), The Last Circus (or should we all say The Ballad of the Sad Trumpet [cough]) transformed from shocking visual cinema to a mismanaged company heading straight toward the red. This felt like a project that was too big, too flashy, to nondescript to create a compelling slice of cinema. Even as we open; the sound of the resistance, the grumblings of the circus, the fear of the children, the chaos of battle; seem to be forgotten the moment Inglesia has the opportunity to demonstrate his penchant for blood, special effects, large-breasted women, and the absurd. The Last Circus bases its watch-ability on the fact that each scene attempts to be more impressive than the next; which in theory sounds powerful, but when it adds nothing to the crux of a story - it ends up being merely extra screams in an inevitable car crash. Why run into the trailer when a sadistic boyfriend is on your trail? Logic. The Last Circus laughs in the face of logic. There is no ""why"", or ""what"", or ""how"", or anything connecting one scene to the next. An example of this would be the introduction late in the film of a memory that haunts Javier's life (see trumpet). Where was this earlier in our development? If this is needed to challenge our character, than challenge; do not add garbage to an otherwise already cluttered scene. Throwing information into our character's social well-being this late in the film muddies the impact on the ultimate finale. As our character ascends the cross in pursuit of his woman, does that particular scene carry relevance to anything? If your answer is no, the point is made. With no character development, no preemptive childhood scene, nothing tying us back to the central focus of this film - Inglesia pushes us head-first into the violence, into the lacking characters, and into a story that builds upon nothing, and shatters into oblivion.

On a side note, it is understandable, and respectable, that everything placed within this film is to represent a portion of history surrounding the Spanish Civil War (...it still doesn't make this a great film). When viewed amongst more educated friends, they brought to the conversation the lineage of truth Inglesia planted within this mess. While they appreciated the history (specifically, the scenes involving Javier chasing pheasants for the General - representative of Spain's class structure at this time), there was not enough hints of this throughout the film. Grass fed chickens we are not, but for those less impressed by the history of Spain there needed to still be a good movie among the rubble to rest your eyes upon.

In the end, The Last Circus' blend between the real and fantasy, the swirl of historical and metaphoric, and the shock of violence and destruction hit no mark.  It was a decent try, but Inglesia could not carry the weight of this film.  It was too much in a less than two hour performance.  Ideas implanted at the last moment forced this humble viewer to witness the sloppiness of this movie, and realize that Inglesia is a great director, but without his typical writing partner, Jorge Guerricaechevarra, the point fell flat.  Failing on potential, the Tarantino-esque violence could only carry him so far, and the rest was utter embarrassment.

I cannot write anything more about this movie.",1327536000,2,3939,4.835311572700297

4655271,4,B005D0RDH0,"Some of the Better Spanish horror films I've seen, ""The Devil's Backbone"" and ""Pan's Labyrinth"" to name two use the The Spanish Civil War as a backdrop. ""The Last Circus"" follows that lead.

Here's the scoop. A rebel troop, on the spur of the moment, dragoons a group of circus performers in a battle with government soldiers that is taking place right then and there. Some are killed while others, including a ""funny clown,"" are captured and put to work building a giant cross. The son of said clown sets off dynamite at the work site, taking out the eye of a general and causing the ultimate death of his father. Years later he becomes a ""sad clown"" in a circus and becomes infatuated with a beautiful female performer who is also the girlfriend of his ""happy clown"" partner. Said partner beats the girl on a regular basis and our ""sad clown"" figures he's got to save her. This leads to a real wild ride.

The sight of armed clowns, and other garbed up circus performers, fighting it out with soldiers is as bizarre a sight as you're likely to see in the movies. And that's just the first scene here so you know you're in for it. Though things do calm down a bit after that they are no less strange. The circus performers are an odd lot and seeing the girl put up with the regular physical abuse from her boyfriend is both painful and strange. Is there something wrong with her or is she playing out a repeating scenario with would-be rescuers? Things get increasingly more strange as the story plays out and that's where it lost me.

In the third act things become so surreal I could no longer suspend my disbelief. My guess it was supposed to be this way. No one in their right mind could figure this would be believable, but the purpose escaped me. our ""War Between the States"" was quite a while ago and exists only in a few photos and  writing. Much of the horror in Spain was caught on film. My guess is it's comparatively recent happening is still present in the psyche of the people and that is what drives this movie. The Catholic religion also plays a prominent role here and, again, I simply do not know it's place in their society, but, judging by the events, it isn't well thought of.

Alex de la Iglesia is a director to watch. He shows great authority here. He frames his shots well and his sense of movement within the frame is good. It has a great look and feel to it. All the aspects of production are top shelf and the actors do a fine job as well. This is not a horror movie but more a movie about horror. The story depicted is sad and ugly. People should not be subjected to these kinds of things in their lives. When they are they turn out to be screwed up and twisted as are many depicted here. This might not be for everyone but it's a rich treasure for the more adventurous among us.",1326067200,5,2809,4.332699619771863

Using different avenues, it consistently demonstrates the varying degrees of mental illness lurking beneath humanity itself. At points I watched with my jaw dropped in sheer amazement. The gore level is a gritty 7 out of 10, providing more than enough greyscale to splatter some red on. The violence of both love and hate depicted offer plenty of room for blood and guts. There are points where I wondered if this movie was running long, but it was quick to bring back the excitement til' the very end. Being a Spanish film, it may not be for everyone with its dark and gritty nature, but if you are looking for something out of the ordinary, this is it.",1325116800,,797,4.496551724137931
4655273,1,B005D0RDH0,"First of all, I have to apologize because my level of English does not reach to the point where I can trully express how bad this movie is. When I left the theatre I wanted to punch director Alex de la Iglesia's face. I have seen ALL his movies, bought his novel (yes, he wrote one years ago), and I have even meet him personally a couple of times, but this guy's career is going downhill. Each movie is worse than the one before. He started with a masterpiece (""Accin mutante""), then an excelent one (""El da de la bestia-the day of the beast""), then an ok one (""Perdita Durango-Dance with the Devil"")...and then we did crap after crap (specially painfully terrible were ""The perfect crime"" and ""800 bullets""). He, however, did another very good one: ""La comunidad-common wealth"".
But ""Balada triste"" (""The last circus"") should have been called ""Cagada triste"" (there goes a joke for the Spanich speaking people). It puts Ed Wood films to shame, with a number of mistakes, flaws, and plain nonsense too long to list here.
Anyway, here's a few:
-A hot chick can pick any guy... and chooses a shy, ugly fatso, even when that puts her life at risk
-A guy puts a red-hot iron on his lips...and keep on talking for the rest of the film, like nothing has hapened
-A guy in terrible condition leaves the hospital (?) naked (??), crosses the whole town of Madrid by foot (???) and ends up in the mountains (????) where he ACCIDENTALLY stumbles with the guy who has been looking for revenge for 20 years...and recognizes him (??!!!) even though he was just a boy the last time they saw each other (??!!!)
-A guy puts together some sort of ""batcave"" out of nowhere and without explanation
-This same guy goes to the movies, and when the film is over, returns to the ""batcave"" where he has... a copy of that same movie (!!!???).
The scene of the hot lady of the circus, when she's on top of the cross of the Valle de los Caidos, and she HAPPENS to find a EXTREMELY LOOOOONG ribbon she can escape with is just too much.
The film is supposed to be funny, but as I said before, brought violent, revengeful feelings instead.

Alex's movies keep you guessing what will happen next which is something I see about 3 percent of the time anymore. If you look at the directors he is compered to in the other reviews (Del Toro, Jean-Pierre Jeunet and especially Alejandro Jodorowsky) and you have enjoyed that storytelling...you should probably check this out too. As another reviewer said, I'm sure their is a lot of symbolism and commentary on Spain and Franco etc. and this level is lost on me but didn't take away my enjoyment of the film.
