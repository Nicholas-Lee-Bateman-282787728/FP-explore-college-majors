8736264,5,B016CG0JMO,It exceeded my expectations. It begins very simply but around the forth episode it really grabs the viewers attention. It's incredibly different in an incredible way.,1463875200,,166,5.423076923076923

8736266,5,B016CG0JMO,I saw it Netflix. I enjoyed this Anime. Went to another place to get because it was cheaper. Both artwork and story was good. I was little sad that the Princess was the bad guy!!,1456272000,,178,4.114285714285714
