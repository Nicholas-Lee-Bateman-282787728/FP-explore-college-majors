8173536,4,B00005M20K,"This dvd has been transfered from a battered VHS tape without any enhancements at all but that doesn't detract from the fun. The 50' 1992 Gods Of Grind Tour is worth the money per se !! Incredibly well filmed and with a terrific stereo mix; guitars SHRED, trebley but totally audible bass guitarwork and inhuman drumming; these guy invented the grindcore genre !!!

The shorter Nottingham 1989 bonus gig is a pain to watch and listen after the newer one since the filming and sound are of bootleg quality. Curiously enough the dvd starts off with 5 excellent videoclips 3 of which I didn't care for much since they belong to their latest melodic death metal era which would eventually lead up to their splitting. The other 2 SHRED !!

I'm just a casual fan who wanted to check out on the band through this dvd and man was I surprised !!!",1246579200,,837,4.5
8173537,3,B00005M20K,"I am very happy to have this title on DVD, but you can tell that  this rerelease was done in the cheapest way Earache could. Rather than digitizing the original films/videos, they merely made a copy from an old VHS of the original release. There are lots of dropouts in the picture and it is grainy from the aging process of the VHS. An earlier review complained about the audio, which I thought was better than the video quality. I hope that Earache will revisit the release and do a proper job someday. With the outstanding reunion tour the guys just did I think that now is the time to do so.",1225324800,,595,4.3125
8173538,4,B00005M20K,"Carcass is the best metal band.

This DVD is not very good though, in the sense that they do not spend any money to making it.
Still good if you are carcass fan.",1205452800,,161,3.878787878787879
8173539,4,B00005M20K,"Like others I bought this DVD because as a Carcass fan I'll take what I can get.  As their only DVD, this doesn't offer a wide array of choices.  The DVD is well laid out, and the insert seems to be a reprint of the Smell the Carcass CD.  The live material is pretty interesting and actually not that bad as far as audio quality goes.  I'd like to echo sentiments that the quality of the music videos was quite lacking.  I'm not sure what the sources where, but it most certainly wasn't what I was expecting for quality on DVD.  Well it's like $20 so what the hell, worth it to a Carcass fan.",1191974400,,592,4.104347826086957
8173540,5,B00005M20K,"This is a CARCASS dvd man, who can belive it ?!
