8594094,5,B00519IKBG,"Half an hour of intensely exciting tarpon fishing from float tubes. Highly entertaining flyfishing film, that really succeeds in making you want to leave the office and go fishing, like every film should! Highly recommended!",1324252800,3,224,5.428571428571429
8594095,2,B00519IKBG,"30$ for a 30 minute DVD --- Sucks
There is no real story here, a good chunk of the 30 minutes are simple nature shots (nice but not what i paid for)... I really feel like i got robbed.... This "" 26 minutes Movie (+ 3 min. bloopers"" is a racket. Watch the trailer... There's nothing more to see in the DVD !",1320105600,2,306,3.873015873015873
