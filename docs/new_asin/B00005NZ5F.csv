7948053,1,B00005NZ5F,Too much of Butch talking about himself. Who cares? I wanted some solid golf tips to get my handicap under 10. This video was thin on substance and not helpful.,1041465600,2,160,4.366666666666666
7948054,1,B00005NZ5F,"This should have been called the Butch Harmon auto-biography.  He talked so much about himself, I'm suprised there was time for any golf instruction.  In fact there was almost no fundamental teaching in the entire video.  Save your money on this one.",1023753600,7,250,4.904761904761905
7948055,2,B00005NZ5F,"Come on, Butch.  I haven't seen the course management video, but the ones on the short and long games should have been entitled ""Butch Takes Some Bows and While at it Throws in a Few Golf Tips"".  The content of these videos was extremely thin.  I've seen you on The Golf Channel, and you obviously have a great deal of wisdom.  I came away from these videos with one (1) insight I could take with me and that was how far to stand away from the golf ball for each club.  I feel like I was fleeced in buying these videos and I don't often feel that way with a consumer purchase.  Seriously, Butch, if you read this, I want my money back.  Shame on you.",1011657600,5,650,4.111111111111111
