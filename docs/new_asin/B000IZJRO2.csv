You can't beat a movie scene where the hero fends off five or six bullies, with a baby strapped to his back: Great scene.  A lot of disturbing tensions between families at the polar ends of the class spectrum, makes the viewer want to reach out and shake some sense into people, yet very charming and one of the better stories I've seen involving lovers from dichotomous classes.",1447027200,,444,4.5375
8147895,5,B000IZJRO2,This is a classic film in India which won several awards. After watching with friends I decided to purchase myself. I wasn't dissapointed.,1382486400,,138,5.043478260869565
8147896,4,B000IZJRO2,"For romantics, this 1996 movie is a must see. It was a big hit when released and Aamir Khan and Karisma Kapoor both won acting awards for their roles. I would have rated it five stars but I downgraded it a star because of a couple of the cheesy scenes with the comic relief squad (Johnny Lever, etc) and the overblown ending.

The music is superb throughout the movie. The Raja Hindustani soundtrack often gets mentioned on lists on best Bollywood soundtracks such as Planet Bollywood's list of 100 best soundtracks. The Raja Hindustani soundtrack was the best selling album the year it was released. Aaye Ho Meri Zindagi Mein (you have come into my life) is a beautiful song done in both female and male versions in the film. I have read elsewhere that this song is often played at weddings in India. The song Pardesi Pardesi (Foreigner, Foreigner) became a major hit. Tere Ishq Mein Nachenge (loosely translates to we will dance around in your love I believe) is another great tune. I loved the soundtrack so much I bought the cd; all of the songs are terrific unlike some albums where I will skip some of the tracks.

Basic plot summary: Rich Mr. Sehgal (Suresh Oberoi) lives with his modern daughter, Aarti (Karisma Kapoor), and her step-mother Shalini (Archana Puran Singh) in a palatial home. Aarti wants to go for a vacation at a small hill station named Palankhet where her parents had met for the first time. Once there, she meets with less educated, more conservative (some might say chauvanistic) taxi-driver Raja Hindustani (Aamir Khan), and after a short period of time, both fall in love with each other, and get married without Aarti's father's blessings. Eventually, Mr. Sehgal forgives his daughter, and invites both newlyweds to his palatial home, not knowing that his wife, her brother, Swaraj (Pramod Moutho), and her nephew Jai (Mohnish Behl) have plans for him and his daughter that will change their lives forever.

The movie has lots of emotion throughout. I have watched the film several times so it has repeat watching value. Some of the scenes are just terrific but I won't give any spoilers so watch it for yourself remembering is a 1996 film with a darker look and feel than you might see today. Aamir and Karisma have outdone themselves in this movie and you truly feel they love each other.",1375142400,,2321,4.74009900990099
8147897,5,B000IZJRO2,"You have so many great dvds tere are lots of others that I WANTED AND STILL WANT BUT I cannot understand why you don't send more to Australia for I ORDER LOTS AND YOU ALWAYS DISPLAY RED NOT GOING TO ,YOUR COUNTRY VERY DISSAPPOINTING for I LOVEbollywood  dvds.",1374278400,,259,4.395833333333333
8147898,4,B000IZJRO2,"I actually enjoyed this movie a lot.  The first half is really good, cute and funny. The second half goes bonkers, but it's still fun. Aamir is great, and Karishma is pretty but annoying at times.  And I love the music!",1354838400,,219,4.317073170731708
8147899,5,B000IZJRO2,"Truly was enjoyable and as always Aamir Khan does a fantastic job portraying his character. Karishma Kapoor is beautiful and the kissing scene took my breath away. I'd read an Indian article which had movie goers rate the best movie kissing scenes and this was voted the best. Besides being a huge Aamir Khan fan, it was the main reason I had to buy the movie. Hollywood could re-learn a thing about the kissing scenes in movies nowadays!",1311638400,3,438,4.628205128205129
8147900,5,B000IZJRO2,"This has got to be one of the greatest Indian movies you will ever see. Yes, some of the acting is over the top, the first 15 minutes of the film drag before the story kicks in and sure, some points are laboured for Western audiences. However, petty criticisms aside, I keep coming back to this flick year after year as my all time favourite Hindi language film (after Khuda Gawah perhaps). Karishma Kapoor in particular is a real treat to watch - beautiful and intelligent, and above all a very talented and convincing actress. I am genuinely curious that such a breathtakingly gorgeous lady did not make an effort to enter Hollywood or the English language movies at all. Perhaps the most outstanding feature of the movie is the fantastic music. Catchy and hypnotic to the point where you cannot really ever forget the main motifs and themes. I can guarantee that even if you don't like the film that much the song & dance numbers will either enchant or entrance. You will never in your lifetime forget the gypsy dance number. Forget the art house stuff and enjoy pure Bollywood at its best.",1304467200,5,1093,4.61025641025641
8147901,4,B000IZJRO2,"This movie is about a conniving uncle, wicked stepmother, misunderstandings through deception and love across the social class divide... and a proud headstrong lover who is his own worst enemy.
Here we have all the ingredients of Bollywood romance and melodrama. You are carried by the romance and your emotions manipulated by the deceptions. In short this is the sort of story Bollywood loves and does well. It is part fairy tale and part morality play.
There is also the fight scene (Aamir seems to have done few movies without one!)
Aamir Khan is a handsome youth in this movie (it was in the late 90s). He is not just a pretty face and a scene stealer but a fine actor. The movie is almost worth watching just for him.
Karisma Kapoor is also very good, as are the supports - though wicked uncle and stepmother are very much characatures. The chemistry between the lovers is good too.
There is some good music of the more sweeping haunting variety rather than Bhangra upbeat. Also a few good dance sequences.
This movie is a little dated in the film quality etc but as much of it is spent in beautiful mountain scenery in traditional clothes that are timeless it has stood the test of time well- and still seems to be loved by many.
If you love romance or classic Bollywood this is definitely recommended.",1232496000,9,1308,4.594017094017094
