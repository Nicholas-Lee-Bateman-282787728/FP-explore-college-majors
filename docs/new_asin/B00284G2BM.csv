3871968,5,B00284G2BM,"Minnesota Cuke and the Search for Noah's Umbrella addresses the issue of confidence around friends and teaches children to do the right thing and not worry about possible ridicule.

In this episode, Larry the Cucumber stars as Minnesota Cuke, the curator of the Mooselake Children's Museum. A rich man named Humfrey Muffet sends Cuke on a quest for Noah's Ark. Muffet wants the Ark for his Bible-themed goldfish pond. Cuke, along with his friends Martin, Julia and Professor Rattan, work to locate the Ark and learn of the existence of a supposedly powerful ""Noah's Umbrella."" Following clues, Cuke journeys to the pyramids in Mexico and later to Turkey and overcomes tests and hardships. Rattan's evil twin brother named Wicker knows of the quest and tries to find the location of the umbrella and Ark before the others. The accompanying silly song for this episode is titled ""Sippy Cup."" Minnesota Cuke and the Search for Noah's Umbrella is an Indiana Jones inspired episode, much like the earlier VeggieTales adventure, Minnesota Cuke and the Search for Samson's Hairbrush.

Minnesota Cuke is overly concerned about what other people think of him. The show relates the following message: ""God promises He will give us the confidence to do the right thing,"" despite what others may think. It is important to have faith in God's plans, just like Noah had great faith when he built the Ark. The applicable Bible verse discussed at the end of the film is Proverbs 29:25 - ""Being afraid of people can get you in trouble, but if you trust in the Lord, you will be safe.""

This faced-paced episode full of adventure and suspense will keep kids interested. Like the other VeggieTales episodes, the adventure includes plenty of creative and witty remarks. For example, one of the cities Cuke visits is called ""El Pez,"" the ancient city of candy dispensers. For those interested in incorporating bilingual studies, parts of the episode feature Spanish words and phrases, especially the song ""Mexican Ice Cream."" And, to my delight, the song ""Arise and Shine"" plays a big part in the show. I have a feeling VeggieTales has another hit on their hands!",1250208000,,2142,4.944444444444445
3871969,5,B00284G2BM,"Great for all kids any age! My three year old son has been in love with these movies since he was six months, and now his one year old sister is following after him loving these movies! And its even fun and educational for adults and parents. A great way to introduce God into their lives! Highly recommended.",1249603200,,309,4.344827586206897
3871970,5,B00284G2BM,"Larry the Cucumber is embarrassed.  He just got laughed at for giving thanks for his food at lunch.  And so Bob the Tomato sets aside the letter of the day and offers us this story instead.

Minnesota Cuke (Larry again) has had it with being laughed at.  He doesn't even want to take a new archeological job as a result.  But he gets talked into searching for Noah's Ark when he learns that his friend Rattan (Mr. Lunt) has disappeared after starting the search.  Fearing his friend might be in trouble, he sets out for Mexico where he is reunited with Julia (Sweet Petunia).  But the clues Minnesota has to follow are silly.  Will he be able to follow them or will he be too embarrassed to save his friend?

Along the way, we do get a new silly song.  ""Sippy Cup"" actually fits into the theme as it finds Larry at a restaurant asking for a real glass instead of a sippy cup even though he has  a reputation for spilling.  It found it amusing, but I think the target audience will really get into it since they will identify with it.

And really, this entry in the series will appeal to anyone.  The action is fast moving and silly enough for the kids.  Yet this one spoofs the third Indiana Jones movie pretty well, especially the climax, so adults will enjoy many of the jokes and puns.  The moral is a tad heavy handed at times, but that's my only real complaint.  Still, the reminder to do the right thing even if we get laughed at is important.

It still amazes me how much fun these videos can be for all ages while still teaching important Biblical lessons.  If you've missed these gems, this is as good a place as any to start.",1249344000,15,1635,4.301639344262295

3871987,5,B00284G2BM,"Minnesota Cuke - the loveable children's museum curator - is back for another Veggie Tales adventure! Following up on his eagerly received premiere appearance in Minnesota Cuke and the Search for Samson's Hairbrush, Larry takes to the screen again in his role as Minnesota, with both halves of the disc dedicated to his search for Noah's umbrella.

Written by the same team that brought us the original episode, Tim Hodge and Robert G. Lee spin a tale of intrigue and adventure that shows a distraught Larry that trusting in, and obeying God is all that matters. When some fellow fast food eaters ridicule Larry after singing a song of thanks over his chicken nuggets, Bob realizes that Larry is in need of his own story.

Minnesota Cuke hates being laughed at. Though he's tried to do right since he was a wee cucumber, he's just about had it with people making fun of him. The eccentric Mr Muffett (who made his fortune in a best-selling poem about his daughter - ""Little Miss Muffett"") is building a Bible-themed goldfish pond in his backyard, and needs to find Noah's ark to use as the centerpiece.

Larry's quest takes him on a journey filled with mysterious clues, kidnapping, evil twins, and... lots of people laughing at him along the way. Bolstered by scriptural encouragement from his platonic sidekick Julia - Petunia Rhubarb - and challenged through his trials, he eventually comes to the conclusion that when God is happy with his actions, it doesn't matter what others think.

After the release of a rather disappointing Abe and the Amazing Promise, I'm thrilled to see that Big Idea is back on track with this, their 38th Veggie Tales episode. With director Mike Narowcki at the helm, and John Wahba as a co-pilot, we're once again seeing great messages, effectively conveyed through the traditional-style veggie humor that appeals to kids, while offering adults laughs through additional inside jokes and spoofs. The Veggie Tales team openly admits that they were pulling heavily from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade for laughs from older viewers.

I love this 45 minute disc's format, with Minnesota Cuke filling both story slots, separated by an intermission of a fabulous silly song, ""Sippy Cup"" by Steve Taylor. This extended length episode almost gives the feeling of one of the Veggie Tales feature films such as Jonah, but remains sandwiched within the bookends of the intro sequence and closing scripture verse.

""Sippy Cup"" has become a fast family favourite, hearkening back to the undeniable sing-along appeal and humor of earlier Veggie Tales favourites. It's an inside joke here now to threaten our children with sippy cups when they spill, and both my six- and three-year-olds can be heard mumbling the tune under their breath throughout the day. The songs within the episode are just as catchy, only I'm the one you'll find hollering, ""The Lord told Noah to build Him an arky, arky... build it out of gopher barky, barky...""

The discs bonus features are even more fun than usual. The spontaneous, transparent, and revealing studio commentaries laid over the film, as well as lessons in drawing Minnesota Cuke and Julia are the high points. An art gallery, sing along with Larry segment, and discussion guide are also included. English and Spanish subtitles are available, along with 5.1 surround sound, and standard scene navigation options are also included. The CG animation is of course, fabulous. After watching these state-of-the-art releases, it makes returning to their older DVDs such as Esther somewhat painful.

I can't definitively say who was responsible for the mediocre quality of Abe, but I can attest to the fact that Minnesota Cuke and the Search for Noah's Umbrella is right up there amongst the Veggie Tales classics. My children have been asking to watch it incessantly, and I hardly mind. The message is great, unmistakably delivered, catchy tunes, lots of laughs - we've got a winner! Or as my oldest tells me, ""I'd give it eight stars if I could!""",1254960000,9,4005,4.958271236959762

3871989,5,B00284G2BM,"Veggie Tales have always been great. When Phil Vicher lost control of the company a few years ago (I highly recommend his book Me, Myself & Bob that tells about that), others have taken a turn writing the epsiodes....not always a good thing.  While good they just have not been up to Veggie Tales standards.

This one really hits the mark.  While watching I was sure that Phil must have written this one. Imagine my surprise at the credits to find out it was not him!

Anyway, this is a defite must have for Veggie fans.  If you have never seen a Veggie Tales before, this is a good place to be introduced to them!",1251158400,5,614,4.304347826086956
