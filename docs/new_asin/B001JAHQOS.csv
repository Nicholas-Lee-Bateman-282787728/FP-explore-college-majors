3656331,5,B001JAHQOS,glad to be able to get it.  law and order new season is awful.  Not worth watching so it good to get the good series,1276300800,,116,3.6
3656332,5,B001JAHQOS,"This DVD made a great gift.  It was listed at a low price, arrived quickly, and in perfect condition.  I would definitely buy future items from this seller.",1271808000,,156,4.535714285714286
3656333,4,B001JAHQOS,"I am so excited that season five of CI is finally coming out on DVD.  Unlike the other reviewers, I have to say that the addition of Barek and Logan was a great idea and the main reason I fell back in love with the show.  I was more than a little saddened that Annabella Sciorra didn't stay for sixth season as I loved her character, Carolyn Barek, and very much lament the missed chances.

Still, season five produced some of my favorite episodes of the series.  ""In the Wee Small Hours"" was very well done, as were ""Scared Crazy"" and ""The Healer"".  I have to say that in terms of show mythology, everything from ""To The Bone"" through ""The Good"" was a fantastic set up for Jamey Sheridan's exit and completely set up all of season 6 and the fallout therein.

Something that has always - and will always - impressed me about Criminal Intent is that the internal character continuity is some of the most perfect on television.  Character choices made in season 1 resonate and stay consistent straight through all of season 6 and beyond.  Season five set the scene for everything that came after, including the deconstruction of the Goren/Eames partnership.  Season five really is the last of the golden days for their partnership and friendship.

I have really been anticipating this release and can't wait to get it in my mail box!",1269388800,23,1331,4.578059071729958
3656334,5,B001JAHQOS,"I have long been a fan of LOCI, but only with Goren and Eames.  I have tried watching the other half from Noth and Sciorra all the way up to Jeff Goldblum and partner.  Although all others are very talented actors, I have been unable to enjoy them in these roles.  I am totally taken by D'Onofrio and Erbe and the talent they bring to this show.  I will certainly buy the 5th season, but you can bet that I only watch the ones with Goren and Eames.  I am so very sorry that Mr. D'Onofrio is leaving and the heart will go out of the show.  I will probably tune in to the new one but I don't think I will remain a fan.  It would have been interesting to see Goren  and
Eames' lives play out.  Both Goren and Eames needed a minor theme of a romantic interest to brighten things up.  Goodbye favorite show!!!!",1269388800,31,805,4.070063694267516
3656335,4,B001JAHQOS,"This series began encountering difficulties when it started alternating the detectives each week. One week you get the usual Goren and Eames and the next week you get a new team.  The new team is Mike Logan (Chris Noth) and Carolyn Barek (Annabella Sciorra). Noth eventually grew on me.  After all, he used to be on the original L&O.  However, Sciorra was terrible in this role. She was replaced by other women, who also failed, until in 2009 the show just paired Eames with Jeff Goldblum.  Some tv viewers just got in the habit of watching this show only when Goren and Eames were the ones ""up"". Some buyers of the dvd will probably do the same.

The formula of the show remains the same.  The two detectives need to solve a case which is particularly gruesome or sensitive. The focus is entirely on solving the case, not winning it in court, which makes it different from the other two L&Os. The scripts remain top notch.  However, this is a show which never deviates from the L&O formula.

The earliest seasons of L&O CI are its best ones.  However, this is good enough to continue viewing it.

3656336,5,B001JAHQOS,"The format for ""Law and Order: Criminal Intent"" changes during its fifth season by introducing a second pair of detectives. The episodes alternate each week with the cases being solved by either series regulars Robert Goren (Vincent D'Onofrio) and Alexandra Eames (Kathryn Erbe) or by Detective Mike Logan (Chris Noth) and former FBI agent Detective Carolyn Barek (Annabella Sciorra).

The addition of Logan and Barek brings a different approach to the series as the reactionary Logan is teamed with the intelligent and low-key Barek. The differences of this team, as opposed to Goren and Eames, is not lost on how they interact with Captain James Deakins (Jamey Sheridan) and ADA Ron Carver (Courtney B. Vance).

Featured during the fifth season is the first two-part episode of the series, ""In The Wee Small Hours,"" which involves both sets of detectives. ""Star Trek"" fans will be surprised to see Colm Meaney playing an egotistical judge in this episode.",1268524800,23,957,5.128205128205129

3656338,3,B001JAHQOS,"I have watched Criminal Intent from the first season.  Actor combinations are key.  Goldblum is not a match for the show. In general, his character does not make the story line sincere or as interesting  since his arrival.  There is no contrast from one set of partners to the other and Goldblum does not add anything.  His partner should deliver a larger portion in the episodes, as we have seen in past episodes. This is not a season I will buy.  I can watch reruns in the future.",1249776000,5,482,4.420454545454546

3656425,5,B001JAHQOS,"I never watched the show ""Law and Order: Criminal Intent"" when it was first showing because back then I only watched football games and the news at night.  I happened to watch a rerun of a Law and Order episode and from then on I've been hooked and tried to catch every episode but because the series is kind of old its not playing on TV much any more.

3656465,5,B001JAHQOS,"Personally, I love the new character of Detective Barek. She's quiet, thoughtful, speaks multiple languages, and does a mean, sexy Bronx (I think it's Bronx) accent in the mesmerizing episode ""Watch"". Much more interesting than the soon to follow Falacci character (who was pretty mediocre, imo). I wish it was just Goren and Eames, but I'm happy with the new choices. Definitely an excellent season.",1418256000,,400,5.1692307692307695

3656485,5,B001JAHQOS,I  absolutely love Vincent D'Onofrio.  He is the heart and soul of this show.  His character is well rounded and is realistic. The shows are terrific and so many fall true to life.  Love this show.,1396742400,,197,4.388888888888889

3656494,5,B001JAHQOS,will never stop seeing this show.  I love this show and love the way that the characters solve the puzzles and problems.  The characters also have their own issues and problems and hence it does not get mundane watching it.,1376438400,,223,4.55
3656495,5,B001JAHQOS,"Season V of Criminal Intent is one of its best yet, with a few surprise guest stars who almost steal the spotlight in their respective episodes. First, an old enemy rises again. Then, it's the AntiChrist, and...Caligula? And holy crap, is that ugly celie from the colour purple? Yes, yes, and yes. though I personally don't like the whoopi cushion, I admit, she's a good actress. Though I'm certainly a Goren/Eames fan, the episodes with Chris Noth & Anabella Sciorra were definitely not bad. It helps that Ms. Sciorra is easy on the eyes. And the final III episodes of the season link back to an episode from one of the earlier season involving a corrupt cop named Frank Adair, so you would do well to rewatch that episode before viewing the final III episodes from Season V.",1373673600,2,776,4.630434782608695

3656522,5,B001JAHQOS,"This is the first season where Robert Goren and Alexandra Eames alternate weekly with Detective Mike Logan and Detective Carolyn Barek. While the latter was only in the series for this season, she is the strongest female character paired with Mike Logan and I particularly enjoyed watching the episodes that included her. While not quite a female equivalent of Robert Goren, the character was written so that she was at least as good, intellectually, as her male partner, and appeared to be written to make her a co-lead. Logan's partners in subsequent years (Wheeler, Falacci) are more supporting roles.",1356739200,2,604,5.111111111111111
3656523,5,B001JAHQOS,Huge Goren fan!! Yet another great season that he and Emmes dominate!! I recommend this season and the others too!!!,1336089600,,116,4.85
3656524,5,B001JAHQOS,"With Law & Order: Criminal Intent ending its final season earlier this summer, I've always enjoyed watching the cast members in this show.  Makes for good suspense.  You would enjoy it as well, especially if you also like Sherlock Holmes.",1313712000,,238,4.925
3656525,5,B001JAHQOS,"Another great season. Possibly the strongest. Possibly.

I have to admit that alternating episodes between crews did in fact create suspense simply because the dynamic between them was so different. If you were unconvinced and unhappy sharing your favorite Law and Order with ""new"" characters, you were much more excited to see the D'Onofrio-Erbe episodes. Each team has distinct differences of approach. Chris Noth gets plaudits simply for playing his character for so long. His being in a different setting is hardly worthy of strong criticism.

This season rarely suffered from poor writing or redundancy as previous seasons did (albeit rarely). I can only think of one episode that outright bored me. The majority of the episodes in season five were riveting, and the two-parter (""In The Wee Small Hours"") featuring both Goran-Eames and Logan-Barek is an absolute must-see of the series. Season Four has an equally potent pair-up episode like this as well (""Stress Position""). Rarely a dull moment in season five. My only advise is ""don't binge."" Nothing gets dull faster than when you do :)",1297728000,6,1095,5.146067415730337

Both being hard core Goren fans, we were a little bereft when the seasons started having him in only half the episodes (with Chris Noth being in the other).  However, whether it is a Goren or Logan episode, Criminal Intent is as awesome as ever.  In this season there were moments where we literally gasped out loud at the plot twists!  Oh joy!  As usual, we tore through the whole season in no time, and are now impatiently awaiting season 6!  :) We highly recommend this to fellow Criminal Intent enthusiasts.",1284336000,6,652,4.428571428571429

3656540,4,B001JAHQOS,"In the 5th year of Criminal Intent, we are introduced to team B made of Det. Logan (Noth) and Det. Barek (Sciorra) , both teams work together in one case in this season and in my opinion is the best joint episode of a series ever.

I never saw the original L&O so I didn't know who Det. Mike Logan was, personally I don't care much in this season because Det. Barek is like Goren's female counterpart and made the episodes interesting. The reason I never watched Logan's episodes again was because the 2 terrible other partners he had (Wheeler & Falacci), Falacci wasn't that bad in season 7 but Wheeler was.

This is probably the last good season, mainly because of the departures of Ron Carver (Vance),Capt. Deakins (Sheridan) and Det. Barek (Sciorra) why did they leave? or why did Dick Wolf cutted them out? I think those 3 still had a very good potential, specially Det. Barek.

Sadly now L&0 it's just like your average CSI, I think that's why Vic D'Onofrio left the show in season 9.

Buy this one, is the last good one.",1280448000,4,1027,4.446808510638298
