7905302,4,096862880X,"I purchased this video after spending 10 days with don Augustin at Yushintaita, his Peruvian jungle camp. I found it to accurately reflect the experience that I had and capture the feel of this special place. More than that, it provides the viewer with insight into Augustin's devotion to his calling and his vast knowledge of the spirit world and the medicinal properties of plants that he has accumulated over a lifetime. Through an intimate view of ceremony participants' experiences accompanied by don Augustin's informative narrative, the viewer gains an understanding of the ayahuascero's role in Amazonian culture and the healing that is available through Spirit and ceremony even to those of us raised in western society. As a non-Spanish speaker, I appreciated the English translation of Augustin's words (subtitled) as it added much to my understanding of his perspective of life and the mysteries of the shaman's world. The video production done in a rustic, documentary-type format.  It is a good resource for anyone interested in learning about or already embarking on the shamanic path. It will also provide the traveler with a rare view of a mystical practice that is woven deeply into Amazonian culture. If I have one criticism about the video it would be that it doesn't go far enough to capture don Augustin's delightfully playful spirit and his mastery of music and showmanship, which made my visit so memorable.",1045612800,,1431,5.115384615384615
7905303,5,096862880X,"When I first met Miguel Kavlin I was in a group of people in a Yoga studio in New Jersey. After listening to his lecture and seeing brief parts of the video,I was grateful for the opportunity to purchase it that evening.
The first thing that I noticed was the beautiful Ayahuasca visionary artwork on the video package. It ""spoke"" of a world that awaited me.
Although it was late when I arrived home, watching the entire video was more important than going to sleep.
And, I wasn't disappointed! I did find it necessary to view it several times after that to accustom my ears to listening to Don Augustin's accent, but each time I learned something that I had missed previously.
I have been a student of shamanic studies since the 80's, and knew that going to the jungle to experience the transformational power of Ayahuasca was the next step for me.
The video was an important preparation for doing that in Nov. 1999. It captures the Heart,Spirit,fun and intrigue of the Peruvean Rainforest adventure.
I felt that the video gave me a realistic view of the Ayhuasca experience that awaited me, and also a sense of trust in Don Augustin as a multi-talented,wise and compassionate healer with an extraordinary commitment.
I returned from my Peruvean Amazon experience with a profound appreciation for the work that he and Miguel Kavlin are accomplishing with each of us who take the opportunity to be with them- and for the healing power of Our Mother Earth.",999734400,6,1455,4.732283464566929

  Miguel A Kavlin
  Thank you for this well put together video on ayahuasca,amozonian shamanism, and don augustin volume 1. In this video the information on healing makes perfect sense to me as I incorporate new ideas into my thinking. About two years ago I had taken care of an older friend who died at 80 years old. I wish I had known about this kind of healing back then. He had a mental illness with depression that kept him from functioning at his best because of all the mental and emotional build up that was not relieved. I had taken him to over 100 doctors in the fourteen years that I knew Warren. These doctors would not listen long enough. I can see after how this video presents this material on healing that I could have helped Warren and this is like putting some of the pieces together. My Intuition is very strong about this. Although Warren has pasted away I would not have seen this video at all, might not have known any information on ayahuasca, and would not have had these new ideas come to me. For me I need to do some kind of healing work as I am at a cross road. I know there is a reason why I came across this at this time in my life. I have read shamans drum on you and don agustin, but did not know  you were working with him. I am sure you feel the same way about all this and I feel some kind of connection. I have many things to talk about; too much to write here, but would love to here from you; and we can exchange thoughts, and ideas. Hope to here from you soon

7905305,5,096862880X,"This video, created by Miguel Kavlin, is the best of its genre.  It takes you right into the jungle and introduces you to Master Shaman Augustin Rivas.  Rivas talks about the the medicinal plants of the jungle and shares insights about ceremony, medicine, and universal love.  Interesting footage of the jungle, native art work and lots of singing by Don Augistin. This is a great inside view of the jungle for anyone considering a trip to encounter ancient medicines and ceremonies of healing.",989625600,3,494,4.927710843373494
7905306,5,096862880X,"How many times do we come across gentle beings capable of touching our heart no matter what our thoughts may be? I liked this video for what it showed me. I saw a man, a simple man, courageous enough to follow his heart, his intuition, his pure energy, and create his life, to the finest detail, out of that inspiration. You can see him curing, hear him singing, feel him playing, the man is in ecstasy and both his feet are touching the ground. He can explain shamanism and introduce us to Ayahuasca, but what captured me the most was the intention beneath the man, beneath the shaman, the courage, the humbleness, the sincerity and the playfullness of Don Agustin, that seem to be the ingredient forces to acquire wisdom, strenght, love and peace in life... and death.  A lovely account of wisdom. Thank you.",983836800,,810,4.586206896551724
7905307,5,096862880X,An excellent video for anyone looking to understand Shamanism or looking for information on mental and physical healing. Don Augustin Rivas Vasquez is truly a gifted shaman.

7905308,4,096862880X,"Dissconected from your soul? THink there is more to reality than just what you see. Ayahuasca just might be the medicine to help you realize your full potential. Much has been writen on the subject and many myths  seem to  abound, so  anyone considering a journey with ayahuasca should view this  video. Although slow in some parts it provides a comprhensive understanding  of all the aspects of an ayahuasca journey. Don Augustine explains to the  viewer the many complex levels that are encountered in ones journey in a  beatiful and precise manner. At points you may find yourself skeptical to  the ideas of spirits and alternate realitys, but DOn Augustine shows how  they can provide you with much compassion and joy. HAving spent two weeks  in Don augustine presence I came away with a renewed understaning of the  world and myself. THis is a wonderful chance to view first hand all the  power and love that can be realized with ayahuasca.",953251200,6,945,4.801242236024844
