8674711,5,B00MUI653G,Great value here! The 3D is superb with both of these films. FWIW I have a passive 3D system. I'm not sure how it looks on an active 3D system.,1448928000,,143,3.8
8674712,2,B00MUI653G,"Oh, Promethius....Just how did this movie get a green rating on IMDB? I have no idea. Promethius gets 2 stars for decent visuals and the quality acting by the main female actress. Otherwise, it is filled with cliches, plot errors, and just obvious logic and science errors that make it laughable... if only it were funny. I was so bored I couldn't even watch it, even in 3d. This movie is profound, if you're profoundly stupid. Wish I could return it for sure!",1442966400,,460,4.554216867469879

8674714,3,B00MUI653G,2 3d movies in one....predator and Prometheous...two P movies....For some reason these are two of the blurriest blu rays Ive ever tried to watch...even worse in 3d....I believe these must be made cheaply....maybe you get what you pay for....two movies for 3d for 22 bucks was a bargain...and thats how the movies look too...,1441238400,,324,5.018518518518518
