This particular disc has errors and would freeze about half way through on 3 diffenert machines.

DVD was sealed/new and appears to be perfect. I ordered it months ago and only watched it recently, so I don't think I can return it.",1373932800,,347,4.164179104477612

2780733,5,B000NSHY7G,"One would probably find this worth it for the AC/DC live performance alone. Hard to find live performances from some great acts.  Here are the performances and a few notes regarding this edition:

1) Hall & Oates-Rich Girl
2) Eddie Money-Baby Hold On
3) Robert Palmer-Every Kind of People
4) The Cars-Just what I Needed (Ben Orr is so cool in this...)
5) Exile-Kiss You All Over (before they went country)
6) Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers-American Girl (Fab, early Petty performance)
7) Chic-Le Freak
8) Four Tops-Ain't No Woman (like the one i got)
9) REO Speedwagon-Roll with the Changes
10) Ambrosia-How Much I Feel (They look to be lip syncing)
11) AC/DC-Sin City (Angus is so amazing and Bon Scott is in pure form...this is the best.)
12) Yvonne Elliman- If I Can't Have You
13) Chuck Mangione-Feels So Good (after 30 some years, I still don't need to hear this song again)
14) Ted Nugent-Cat Scratch Fever (it's Ted, so it has its merits!)
15) The Trammps-Disco Inferno",1231113600,23,975,4.695906432748538
2780734,4,B000NSHY7G,Some great bands on here.,1414713600,,25,4.2
2780735,4,B000NSHY7G,"Some great performances and - as always - a couple I had little interest in.

Hall & Oates doing 'Rich Girl' is a great example of a great performance - on the other hand I had far less interest in Tom Petty doing 'American Girl'. And that's sad because I love 'American Girl' but (to me) they were just going thru the motions - they didn't appear to be excited about being there.

As many others have noted, I would prefer the complete shows or at least putting all the groups songs on one DVD instead of 3 or 4 (or some songs not at all). I assume that they weren't able to get the rights or that they were too expensive to afford. This show was on about 10 years so there must be about 200 to 250 shows meaning at least 400 songs were on the show. However they have released only about 50 to 60% of the available material.

And that's a shame because some songs were ONLY on TV via this show.

I would rate this particular DVD 7.75 to 8.25 out of 10. In spite of the problems as noted above I still enjoyed this!

Recommended - but instead of being great like it could have been it's merely pretty good.",1411516800,2,1106,4.101851851851852
