8205278,1,B000SFOYNG,"You wonder how anyone could yell ""that's a print"" from the Director's chair. Very stilted sophomoric dialogue; or rather, had the lines been delivered as an actual 'real-live character' might have delivered them, it could have rolled along, rather than clunk-clunk-clunk like a car driving on its rims.",1247961600,,302,5.3125
8205279,1,B000SFOYNG,"This is more of an educational movie more than anything, About what drugs can do to you. No for me personally this movie is definately not a keeper.",1205884800,,148,4.321428571428571
8205280,1,B000SFOYNG,"The Blue Rose is a rare confluence of a bad movie trifecta. It has a cliched plot that is riddled with awkward, stilted dialogue. It has amatuerish acting by its lead. To top it all off, it is extremely low budget, so low budget that it seems like a ""scared straight"" video that might be shown to students in junior high. This is perhaps the perfect storm that results in an unredeemably bad film.",1204675200,,397,4.378378378378378
