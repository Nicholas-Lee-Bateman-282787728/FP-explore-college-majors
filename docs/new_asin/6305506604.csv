1039832,3,6305506604,"This must have been one of those avantgarde films of the Seventies to promote the hippie lifestyle.  Drugs with a capital D is what it was all about, and the rebellion of children who are not trusted or shown respect by their disapproving parents.  What appealed to me was the fact that Linda Ronstadt's songs (those I have never heard) were used at intervals to show how Denice really felt.  Sally Field and the actress who played her younger sister both had little girl voices, and had never grown up -- due to the fact that the extremely strict parents had never let them grow, and so Denice decided to fly away to find herself in the hippie world.  First, she had gone to Chicago, but finding no one substantial there, she ended up a year later out in L.A. where the beautiful people find their fixes.

The issue I found at the sale showed a beautiful Sally Field, as far from Gidget as possible, with a young David Carradine, rough around the edges.  The street scene has a motorcycle formation which did not take place in the film.  After she returned to the upscale home complete with swimming pool, the character played by Carradine first stole a pest control truck and then an ice cream truck to get to her parents' home.  The younger sister hid her drugs in capsules which looked like real medicine.  All of the family took vitamins at the dinner table, but the food was pretty terrible.

The hippies back then are what we now see as the homeless, and this town is full of them.  They scavenge through the dumpsters and garbage cans for food, even though they can get two free meals a day at the local missions.  One church group even brings soup to Market Square for any and everybody to take free of charge.  This backward town which starred a bear killer, an animal abuser, and a drughead to perform before 3,000 people (parents such as Denice had with their young children in tow) take good care of the homeless from who knows where.  While the girls' father and mother go through their bedrooms searching for drugs, it defeats their strict discipline when we see them hosting a rauncous party of adults playing ""Charades"" in a gross, adult scene of drunken participants.  Their drug is liquor (and sleeping pills) and thus the lavish lifestyle is deceiving.  They could live down in Podunk Florida or Branson, Missouri, wherever the wine flows freely.  I thought this would be about the Age of Aquarius; instead, it shows clearly how parents can force their young teenagers to leave home to seek some freedom of choices.  Soon, they will be grownups and certainly don't want to be like their unrelenting, uncompromizing parents.  It's a shame to have to see this on the screen to realize how some kids had no choice but to leave home.  I left home when I was 17.",1157155200,5,2777,4.560483870967742
1039833,4,6305506604,"I saw this in 1981 at the age of 13. I was starting to show a more rebellious nature according to my parents, and I just wanted to see what this was about. It was to me about wanting to have acceptance, and hsve a relationship. Sally returns from hanging around with the hippies, and finds herself ridiculed by her parents as she wants to bury the hatchet for running away like she did, and her sister now wants to do the same thing, and in the middle of all this is Sally's character waiting for her love to come, and get her, but imagine her surprise when he's working as an ice cream man, and her sister runs away. I found this movie looking back after 25 years of watching it was about the fact that parents and children don't really know how to talk to one another. Parents seem to want to dominate thier children, and not allow them too many outside influences. I know with me all I did was read a lousy book about Bob Dylan, and I was branded a rebel. I also feel that children don't know how to talk to their parents either as there's a lack of respect, and also mistrust. I'm not saying that parents are not to be trusted with a child's feelings, but that sometimes in their quest to know and grow in the world they will look at outside forces because it's going to be inevitable. When I was reading about Bob Dylan it was because it was a name that was stuck in my brain from childhood, and I wanted to know why. I had no interest in his music, or anything like that, but my father threw down the gauntlet by making him look bad, and weird, and to me that was enough to feul my interest even more, and yes I did listen to his music. Do I thank him for wetting my appetite more for knowledge, or do I look upon him in pity because he wasn't comfortable with himself to be open to the fact I was interested, and just acknowledge this. I have to remember that my son's growing up, and there's going to be times when he listens to weird music, or watches weird movies, or wants to read about people that I may feel not pleasant about, but I have to remember that it's better to just allow the interest, and not provide any feedback unless there's a serious change in his behavior, and with me I read about Bob Dylan a month before I heard the first song from him. I found this to be a rather sad movie of a family that I'm sure tried to get along, but couldn't because of feelings of inadequcies that made them want to build a shell of armor that they could hide behind, and act tough. That's the way the world is, and to me that's the biggest crime of all. What's more sad is the ending as Sally's character is submitting to being like her mother, and is vacumning. I feel that if there was a heart to heart talk with the two women there may have been some healing, but alas there was none, and if this movie were to be remade I wonder how the ending would turn out?",1156809600,2,2873,4.122994652406417
1039834,5,6305506604,"I love this film because it can be analyzed on so many different levels, in terms of parent-child relationships and the whole family dynamic. The film begins with Sally Field coming home as a burnt out hippie, basically trying to go back to the life she left behind, only to find out that nothing has changed, and her parents never learned what drove her away from home in the first place. The only difference is that now she sees her parents repeating the same mistakes with her younger sister. Her sister, played by Lane Bradbury, is popping downers, and the parents are going through her room, yelling at her, berating her for using drugs, yet the parents have a medicine cabinet overflowing with pills. They are constantly telling Sally and her sister to ""Take a vitamin!"", ""Take a sleeping pill!"", ""Take a couple of aspirin!"". Then they can't understand why their daughter starts popping pills.

Meanwhile, Sally has her own problems trying to readjust to coming back home. She cuts off her hair, goes back to playing with dolls, and basically tries to go back to being the kid she was a year earlier, but realizes she can't, especially since she keeps having flashbacks of her hippie life, and the boyfriend she left behind (played by David Carradine).

Granted, the movie is dated, but that is one of the reasons I recommend it. Because it takes the viewer back to another time and place; before anybody had ever heard of Osama Bin Ladin or terror cells or Internet chat rooms, any of the things we take for granted today. I highly recommend this movie.",1137888000,24,1560,4.689781021897811

1039836,5,6305506604,"One of the greatest telefilms ever made, from an era in which filmmakers were first sensing the possibilities of the form. Sally Field will break your heart as Denny, the young hippie girl who returns to her mom and dad and their ultra-square suburban lifestyle, after a year or so away from home exploring the complicated hippie life with a boyfriend, ""Flack"" (the young David Carradine). 40s and 50s screen star Eleanor Parker is super as the icy mother; she makes the most out of a difficult role, outdoing Mary Tyler Moore's part in ORDINARY PEOPLE and doing it ten years earlier, when it was a braver career choice. Jackie Cooper is all right as the Dad, but he and Carradine are no match for the female super acting power of Field and Parker.

 It's not a big blockbuster sort of picture, but it is one that you'll take to your heart, and I wonder if Sally Field ever really topped her acting work in this movie. By all means get the DVD, and revel in a different time and place.",1091664000,78,985,4.43646408839779

1039838,4,6305506604,"when this video first aired on tv, i was a 17 year old runaway hippie chick (not PC but true), hitch hiking all over the country, smoking lots of dope, dropping lots of acid, looking for an older guy to take care of me etc.  i tried coming back home a few times without success.  i had a younger sister who was into her own problems.  this movie floored me.  years later i found it on VHS and brought it home and watched it again. despite some silly and dated stuff, it still floored me. sally field did an outstanding job presenting a bewildered child of the times. the wierd part is that those of us who were there really believed that running away and getting high was the better option compared with staying home and following the rules. the world changed so much in such a short time! i felt like my soul was dying and i just had to get out and start living. if you're older than 45 and had a troubled adolescence, this might really hit you where it hurt.",1041120000,20,960,4.201086956521739
1039839,4,6305506604,"This made-for-tv movie was filmed at the time when Sally Field was trying to break out of her ""Gidget"" and ""Flying Nun"" roles.  It is effective at showing what great dramatic work she would do in the future.  One drawback about this DVD is it has no special features.  Overall, this movie has an absorbing story about the conflict between parents and teenagers.

1039841,3,6305506604,"Sally Field really wowed us when this first aired on television as a  made-for-TV-movie of the week.  It shows what happens to families when  parents don't listen and watch what is really happening with their kids.  Sally runs away, does drugs, and hangs out with the hippies (in very  effective flashbacks).  The depiction of thoughts with flashes of images  and voice-over was innovative and genuine.  The movie opens when she  returns home and we (and she) begins to see the same thing begin to happen  to her younger sister and she can't stop it.  Sally's charactor has learned  from her mistake and she tries to warn her sister as well as tries to warn  her parents that they are making the same mistakes they did with her.  It's  a good movie with realistic portrayal of it's time period.  I was a kid at  the time and I understood it and this film was something that teens of this  era were able to relate to.  Most important--there is a lesson to be  learned.  Unfortunately, television always cuts out the songs to make this  movie fit into it's time slot.  Rent the video instead.",960681600,36,1090,4.5625

Still the concept of how things were back then portrayed well in this movie with what everyone wanted the family unit to be with housewives and children.

The story of youth wanting to run away from the constraints of misguided adults is as old as time.  And although the clothes, characters, music and some of the dialogue is a little dated, the feelings are the same. Generational breakdown in communication pure & simple. Everyone has wanted to run away & join the circus at some point in their life.

The acting is what actually sets this film apart from many of that period.  A very young Sally Fields, Jackie Cooper, Eleanor Parker, and a sadly under-used David Carradine (pre ""Kung Fu"") elevate this film.

1040464,4,6305506604,"I didn't see this early-70s made-for-TV movie when it first ran (I would have been about 7, a little too young for the subject matter) or in any later reruns.  I'm a bit surprised because Sally Field of the ""Gidget"" and ""Flying Nun"" TV series was a very popular star, and I would have expected this movie to play on TV more than once and then go into late-night syndication for a while.  I'm now a nostalgic connoisseur of 60s and 70s ""mod"", ""hippie"" and ""teenage runaway"" flicks, and this one falls squarely into the latter genre.  It's kind of at the bridge point between the teenage-wanderer genre portrayed in films like ""Chastity"" and ""Breezy"", where nothing too bad happens to young girls who run away, and the darker troubled youth/ runaway films that began appearing a little later, like ""Richie,"" ""Born Innocent"" and ""Dawn: Portrait of a Teenage Runaway"" where the teens were more likely to end up in a bad situation or even dead.

Field plays ""Denny"", a teenage girl at odds with her parents who ran away from their suburban home and became the hippie girlfriend of an older, Merry Prankster-ish hippie fellow named ""Flack"" (David Carradine).  After a while things go haywire with Flack, so Denny returns to the security of her home, only to find that not much has changed.  Her parents are happy to see her but are repeating their past pattern of conflict with her slightly younger sister, who is secretly using drugs and openly acting out.  Meanwhile, Flack is making his way to Denny's house to convince her to run away with him again, which, from the viewpoint of every teenager watching, probably looked like a great idea compared to continuing to live in Denny's parents' suburban hell.

This movie is chock-full of early-70s cliches.  Plenty of shots of Denny as a hippie dancing through nature settings and running in dusky silhouette along the top of a hill - I swear every single film made in the early 70s has that same shot. There's also a musical sequence where Denny runs down her suburban street waving a stick that turns into a magic wand and leaves a colorful trail of swooshes and words in the air, while in the background a not-yet-famous Linda Ronstadt sings a song about being happy.  This has to be seen to be believed.  Denny's parents have the ubiquitous pool and intercom system and host cocktail parties at which Denny's mom (Eleanor Parker) wears a paisley hostess outfit and serves canapes, and middle-aged people get drunk and play charades and hit on women other than their wives. When Denny comes home, she uses a handy pair of scissors and the bathroom mirror to chop her long hippie banged hairdo into a perfect trendy short shag of the type worn by thousands of women then, leading you to think she missed her true calling as a hairdresser.  The parents are too busy working or partying to bother talking to their kids except to yell at them or search their rooms for drugs.  Somebody has a bad drug trip causing them to freak out and do a full-body crash through a window. Flack the hippie is presented as a fun playful guy who, when he needs to steal cars to get to Denny, steals a brightly painted exterminator truck complete with silly advertising figure on the back bumper (and uses it to scam a meal), then steals an ice cream truck complete with silly bells (and hands out free ice cream to a bunch of kids on the way).  You can see the filmmakers straining not to make hippie stuff look TOO fun for fear of alienating the middle-aged TV audience, while also not wanting to make the hippies look TOO bad for fear of losing the younger hip audience.  The sad part is, while it's easy to chuckle at this movie from the perspective of being middle-aged myself in 2012, there were a lot of families in our neighborhood when I was a kid who were going through this sort of turmoil with their teenage children - and also giving banal cocktail parties much like the one shown, complete with drunken Charades!  I actually witnessed a few such parties in person.

I watched the Amazon video stream which has a fairly poor quality video transfer and sound, not unlike watching this on a real 1971 television, haha.  Could not tell if all the parts of the film were there; Denny's hippie life, her past conflict with her parents, and her phone call home to her parents were all presented as flashbacks.  However, given how hard it is to find some 60s and 70s films especially those made for TV, I was glad to have the chance to watch this at all.",1342915200,,4486,4.571072319201995

My rating is based on the quality of the Passion Productions DVD and not on the movie itself.  For the movie, I give it 4 stars.  It's good, but you can really tell that the influences of the '60s were still present in this 1971 tele-film.  The use of symbolism and flashbacks were a strong characteristic of this movie, but it's still good.  The only thing is that it may not be of interest to younger viewers.  For the DVD, the picture is clear, but you can tell that it's a typical junior distributor release.  It looks like it was mastered from a Beta tape because there is one instance of a white bar running down the screen at the beginning of the movie.  The colours and overall look of the movie is watchable-the skin tones are OK, not flaming pink or morbid grey like on some movies from this time.  It's not as bad as some of the made-for-tv flicks from this era (the very worst being ""The Girl Who Came Gift Wrapped"")  My main complaint is towards the manufacturing of this disc.  It is very sloppy.  The first disc I ordered came in with the disc loose inside the keepcase.  There were surface scratches on the disc too.  I ordered a replacement, and it was worse! The disc was loose in the case and had lots of rub and surface scratches over the playing surface.  However,  the disc still plays good.  The cover also states that this movie is 90 minutes in duration when it's only 75 minutes.  It hasn't been edited, it's the basic running time for movies of this era.  ABC used to play double features for their movie of the week up until around 1974.

1040531,4,6305506604,"I was old enough to be this girl, and came from the same background with the same hassles she went through so I identified with her problem.  However, I guess I never could understand why she felt submerging herself to her parents' expectation was, to her, far better than the uncertainty of being on your own and having to deal with real life.  Maybe I was far more realistic and mature then then this girl because once I left home at 17 I never wanted to move back home to the ""as long as you live under my roof, you live by my rules"" situation.  So for me this movie was not very realistic and it appealed perhaps to middle class white people who preferred the safety of a boring and predictable suburban lifestyle.

On another point, and it has been many years since I saw this on tv, I thought the original tv version was longer and showed her initial struggle at home that sent her fleeing, how she got involved with Flack and much much more of her new life rather than the vague flashbacks in the DVD.  I specifically remember her group of hippies stopping somewhere and she sneaked off to phone home, being a little homesick, and everyone at home begging her to come home, she said ""maybe I'll come home in the spring"" (thus the movie title).  It was as though huge chunks of the original movie have been edited out--important chunks.  Sally Field did an excellent job in this movie--but again it always bothered me that the thing that sent her back home was that her boyfriend left her.  Jeez, if we all went back home to mom'n'dad just 'cause we got our heart broken...it's a pretty weak motive for returning to the dictatorship of mom'n'dad.",1245888000,6,1652,4.447019867549669
1040532,4,6305506604,"The so-called ""nuclear family"" that America had come to idealize as a result of the post-WW II Baby Boom was eventually exposed as an illusion as a result of the many social upheavals of the 1960s, with many young kids either running away from home to hippie communes or finding solace in the potentially deadly world of drugs because parents either didn't understand, or even more didn't WANT to understand, their offspring.  Such was the focus of the above-average 1971 TV movie MAYBE I'LL COME HOME IN THE SPRING, which did a rather good job of showing the downsides of both the counterculture and the typical American ""nuclear family.""

Sally Field, in a role that broke away from her Gidget/Flying Nun persona of the past, stars as a runaway who returns home from a hippie lifestyle after a year in which she has been bruised and scorned by her hippie lover (David Carradine).  What she finds when she returns home is nothing short of depressing: her parents (Jackie Cooper; Eleanor Parker) still look upon her actions with scorn and disapproval, and yet they too indulge in their own brand of reckless behavior, using over-the-counter pills and alcohol instead of marijuana.  Most distressing of all is that Field's younger sister (Lane Bradbury) is headed down the same path as she once was, practically being forced down that path by the parents, who act with relentless hypocrisy, unwilling to understand why their offspring have rebelled the way they have.

Though very emblematic of its time, with certain montage sequences and slightly psychedelic flashbacks, making it obviously dated in some ways, MAYBE I'LL COME HOME IN THE SPRING avoids the fate of so many heavy-handed counterculture films by taking an ambivalent approach.  The counterculture doesn't exactly get a free pass here, especially given the fact that Carradine's character seems too eerily close to that of Charles Manson, seducing Field and then (tragically) Bradbury in the dark side of hippiedom.  Then again, neither does the ""nuclear family"" structure that Parker and Cooper represent; their ideals are so rigid, and their beliefs and their hypocrisy solidified to such an extent, that they don't see the harm their actions have on their daughters.

Despite a few flaws, MAYBE I'LL COME HOME IN THE SPRING is bolstered by a superb dramatic performance by Field, which presages her later roles in pieces like SYBIL and NORMA RAE, and two period-era acoustic folk-pop songs sung by Linda Ronstadt.  The film also boasts very sympathetic director from Joseph Sargent, best known for the 1970 science fiction drama COLOSSUS: THE FORBIN PROJECT and the taut 1974 thriller THE TAKING OF PELHAM ONE TWO THREE.  Even though it can't help avoid being dated in certain ways, MAYBE I'LL COME HOME IN THE SPRING still stands as a very critical look at the things that broke so many families apart at the end of the 60s and the start of the 70s.",1243209600,3,2917,4.9468302658486705

7890653,5,6305506604,"I remember seeing this movie the first time around and it clearly depicts that era. The clothes, the shag haircut being main stream hip, hitchhiking cross country, the drugs, the dirty torn jeans, the long hair, etc. Watching it brought back a lot of memories. This era was a platform for organic farming and natural everything-funny how so much of this train of thought was a step in the right direction but so unacceptable because the older generation wasn't ready to be told anything by a younger generation-our parents were still from the ""children should be seen and not heard"" times. Sally Field did an excellent job with this. I liked that Linda Ronstadt sang the songs. It's dated but accurate.",1516665600,,702,4.809917355371901
7890654,5,6305506604,"This movie portrayed the pivotal period of time when our culture was thrown for a loop. Kids rebelling against the status quo, looking for a life that had meaning. Parents and the government did not know how to deal with free thinkers that were starting to emerge en mass so they tried to stop it with fear and violence. Most of the hippies did not know what to do after rebelling and so became the Baby Boomers that fueled our progression towards the extreme consumer society that we live in today. Yes, there has been progress towards people becoming enlightened , but there is a huge gap between being compassionate with one another and our continued struggle to fill the emptiness within ourselves with external pacifiers like drugs, food, sex, money, status, material items, and power over others. It is as though we have taken one step forward and three steps back looking at the state of our nation in 2018.",1515801600,,914,4.683229813664596
7890655,4,6305506604,"The film really caught the tensions and battles of the time. (although I never had these battles with my parents)  Being a girl at this time myself, I thought, even then, that the hippie lifestyle was EXTREMELY mysoginistic and pointless. But it lured a lot of girls onto the streets.  Many didn't make it back, like the Sally Field character did.",1486857600,,347,4.672131147540983

7890657,3,6305506604,OLD movie. Annoying sound. Middle class girl goes off the be a hippie in the 70s then goes back home. Girl without a country - she fits in neither place. Interesting time piece.,1486252800,,177,4.393939393939394

Although the acting is good overall, it was rather slow and full of cliches, and anyone with half an adult brain can see the end coming a mile away. ;) And boy! Was it loud. People constantly yelling at each other... got on my nerves to the point where I was happy to see it end.",1481241600,,348,3.9857142857142858
