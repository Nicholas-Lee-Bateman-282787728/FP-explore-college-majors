8146431,5,B000IMVOSM,"This ABC News Special DVD features only a ""play"" option on the menu. It is simply 1 hour and 24 minutes of news coverage from the last days, death, wake, and funeral of Pope John Paul II in 2005. I found the disc to be a great historical record of an event I remember very vividly from television in April 2005. It's a useful disc if you are teaching history or religion or journalism and want something to show students to evoke the legacy of Pope John Paul II, recently canonized by Pope Francis on 27 April 2014 as Saint John Paul II. The commentary by ABC News commentators is occasionally superficial, but does a nice job of recalling key moments in the papacy and in the international appeal of history's third-longest papal reign. I also like that the disc includes some moments where the commentators are silent and let the images speak for themselves. Everything is stock footage, without any retrospective added. Not just for Catholics, but for anyone who wants to learn about John Paul II's legacy, this disc is a great slice of recent history.",1399161600,2,1055,4.617021276595745
