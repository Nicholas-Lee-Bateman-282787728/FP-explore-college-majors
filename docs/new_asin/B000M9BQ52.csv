8167437,1,B000M9BQ52,"Poorly done, too cute for words, not enough concentration on the work, too flashy for flashly-sake. Wasted my time. Hated it!!!",1369008000,,127,5.095238095238095
8167438,4,B000M9BQ52,I love going to the Tate Modern and really enjoyed learning about how it came to life. Herzog and de Meruon are amazing at what they do- i think this doco really shows that.,1214956800,,173,4.117647058823529
8167439,2,B000M9BQ52,"this is a tiring dvd to watch. I have tried 3 times to watch it from beginning to end and not successful. there are just too many flat 2d video effect moving / floating / fade in-out in front of the screen which does not compliment nor match the architecture of H&deM. The tone, colour, ambience and aura are not there. At least we have the architects talking, but the editing is not so good either. The pace and mood is simply not there. Makes me think that reading any good publication on the architects (try the good publishers) is a better experience of the time and space and texture and colour and sensuality the architecture provokes. Is there anybody who can pick up the job to redo a good film on this?",1183075200,,711,4.353383458646617
8167440,1,B000M9BQ52,"Unfortunately, this film spent more time with crazy transitions and layers of film that it did not leave much time to discuss or show the buildings in a way that most people can absorb.  They did discuss some of the architects' theories, but did not spend enough time showing the application of the theory in the buildings.  Many times the views of the buildings or spaces in them were artistically shot.  Highly disappointed.",1179273600,,426,4.808219178082192
