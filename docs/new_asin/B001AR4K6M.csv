8279084,5,B001AR4K6M,"With the recent passing of Honeyboy, I've started to pull out and listen to much of his stuff.  I've had the pleasure of seeing him three or four times over the years and had never seen anyone in his elder years put so much energy into his playing.

On this DVD, Honeyboy's playing is excellent!  Dave Rubin shows enormous patience in coaxing Honeyboy to break down his style.

The sound quality is excellent, although sound levels are un-even, at times.  The playing was amplified yet the vocal appears not to have been.  This causes the viewer to turn up the volume during talk passages, and down when the playing continues.

I really ""dug"" the Tommy Johnson part.  If you like Delta Blues, then this DVD is a must.

8279085,5,B001AR4K6M,"I love this DVD.  It's a great way to learn an arsenal of those trademark Delta blues riffs, turnarounds and chord forms.  Listening to Honeyboy relate stories from ""back in the day"" really gave me a better understanding and feel for what it must have been like to live in the blues world of such greats as Robert Johnson, Charlie Patton and many  others.  A must-have for any Delta blues aficionado!",1315699200,,400,4.591549295774648

Honeyboy is a legend but save your money on this product. It's quality is amateur at best.",1268265600,3,263,4.617021276595745
