DO NOT believe the information listed for this item however that it contains only ""15"" discs.  In fact it contains all the discs from the individual items as would be expected and comes to something like 27 discs.  I even wrote customer service to look into the mislabeled information above but they responded it was ""accurate""  Yeah, whatever...the ordered set direct from this link is sitting right in front of me guys and I've counted 'em.

ADDENDUM 3/2/08 - Okay, I see now that Amazon has updated (finally) their disc count in the description of this item.  It now lists the correct number of discs.  Nice they finally believed me.",1163030400,53,787,4.611510791366906

2610961,5,B000GGSLSG,I love this serie !!,1455926400,,20,3.2
2610962,5,B000GGSLSG,"Sorry, Maggie Q and pound-his-shoe-on-the-table Khrushchev, but it's true!  Peta Wilson exudes penache as she does an unequaled job of combining slam-bang physical prowess, whiz-bang weapon capabilities, more-bang-for-the-buck brains, and an empathetic protect-the-innocent aura as her character struggles to find a balance in her tortuous existence as spy/special ops diva.  Two thumbs up for the writers, who weave a constantly evolving and implausible storyline with smart twists punctuated with the expected gunplay and explosions.  I unequivocally recommend this collection ... and I promise you hours of entertainment.  My routine?  I enjoy a dose of Peta while treadmilling 4+ miles in little more than an hour ... which means that I watch each 45-minute episode close to 1 times.  Believe me: A little Peta goes a long way toward making an otherwise boring routine seem to zip by painlessly.",1455926400,3,899,5.478260869565218

2610966,5,B000GGSLSG,"This is an awesome series. I bought the individual seasons, and found it totally absorbing. Roy Dupuis' character Michael is chillingly efficient, and Peta Wilson's Nikita grows into her position as skilled assassin. There is an air of paranoia that permeates the series, that really differentiates it from others. Highly recommended.",1451520000,,334,5.568627450980392
2610967,5,B000GGSLSG,"I just watched my full series again for the second time.  This is a fantastic show.  I had a hard time turning them off and going to bed.  Still gripping after all these years.  The only way you can tell that this show is older is the outdated computers, but it doesn't detract from the excellent story line and acting.  I loved watching them again.

2610971,5,B000GGSLSG,"I'm from France. I've discovered that great series on tv in the late 90's !

It's now almost 20 years ago ! I've bought all seasons in DVDs boxes but I have to admit that the DVDs have not a really top high quality images. I am COMPLETELY FOUND OF that great, powerful, intense, and creative series, and then I think time has come to re-release its 5 seasons in Blu-ray discs !

I am very angry about the idea the Besson's film Nikita and the 2000 series called also Nikita have both been released on Blu-ray discs and not that one which is 1000 times better than the Besson's movie and the 2000 Nikita series !

And if I watch it with her, every now and then, I'm surprisingly in the mood after a few minutes of Ms Wilson.  The stage sets and props were ahead of their time.  It looks great.  I wish they would re-edit like CMT did with ""Dukes"", zoom in for widescreen but, other than 3X4 it's great!",1433116800,,398,4.184210526315789

2610996,5,B000GGSLSG,I've been looking into purchasing all of the seasons but for a while they were cost prohibitive...

Absolutely thrilled to have gotten hold of them!,1424822400,,345,4.40625

2611006,5,B000GGSLSG,"One of my Top 3 all-time fav shows.  Peta Wilson (Nikita) and Roy Dupuis (Michael) put on a clinic in how to speak with body language instead of words.  They have incredible chemistry on-screen.  Peta is gorgeous in this show and you quickly discover that she's not just a pretty face (and body), she is a legit actress who took this role to the next level.  Roy was so good that they made him a regular on the show when he was only supposed to be on for a handful of eps.  The show is really about them and their unrequited love, it just so happens to also be about a secret society of spies who fight international terrorism.  This was pre-9/11.  Looking back on the plots and stories they did, it makes me shiver at how viable some of them were.  The viewer gets quickly invested in Nikita's personal journey as she's forced into this do-or-die secret society and her struggle to fight to maintain her sense of self in the process.

Rounded out with even more great cast who play equal parts bad and good.  You end up understanding why they are who they are and even rooting for them along the way.  It's a mind-bender at times but one thing is for certain...nothing is ever what it seems in Section One.  The only drawback to watching it now is that they didn't have a huge budget for graphics and explosions so those are a bit hoaky but only a small part of the show as it is mostly drama.  Others have played the role of Nikita before and since, but Peta made Nikita so uniquely her own with emotion, physicality, and transformation that she will forever be Nikita to me.

LFN would also be good for aspiring actors/actresses and tv writers to watch to glean insight on the great performances, structure of many of the stories, and how a great show can be done with limited resources and still be very interesting.",1419206400,4,1820,4.394029850746269

2611010,5,B000GGSLSG,"Just as I remember it. Either you liked the show or you hated it, but being a died-in-the-wool Peta Wilson fan  I love it. The early episodes are a bit cheesey when viewed and held up against later productions, but hey, this was then and overall it is a great show. And unlike some others, it stayed true to the original Luc Besson concept. Enjoy.",1413072000,,347,4.338461538461538

Watched it practically non-stop through all 5 seasons and the writing, acting and the cast were as marvelous and relevant today as during the years it originally aired!

Sill have vidid memories to this day over a decade later. Would love if there were an updated sequel with Peta and Dupuis[ Michael]  'recalled' to duty. just like the cinema recalled Sean Connery on several occasions to return to 'active duty' and entertain his fans with his established reputation of 007 which overshadowed all the others who took that role before and after him. He stood out with his charm, wit and sophistocated charisma

La Femme Nikita one of the very best TV series.",1390089600,3,635,4.754545454545455

2611030,5,B000GGSLSG,"This is currently my favorite action/thriller series from television.  The casting, writing and directing were excellent and the actors are wonderful in their roles. I compare all actors in other versions of Nikita to the cast in LaFemme Nikita.  I wish this series had run longer than 4 1/2 seasons (season five is really only a half season.)  The same people who created and produced ""24"" and ""Homeland"" are responsible for this version of Nikita.

I have viewed a more recent series that started in 2010 titled ""Nikita"" which starred Maggie Q and it simply cannot compare to the quality of this earlier production and Peta Wilson's Nikita.  The movie starring Bridgett Fonda in the role of Nikita was well done for a movie, but I prefer the unfolding of the story lines and character development possible with a series that runs for a season.

I bought all episodes of LaFemme Nikita and viewed them in sequence (without commercials) and now this is my preferred way of viewing television shows.

2611054,5,B000GGSLSG,"I love this entire series! The dynamics of the characters involved in this series from the 1990s are astoundingly heart-warming, all of them played their parts excellently. It was a stellar cast alright!

I was very sad when this series ended and I had wished it could have been resurrected. These DVD sets are left to fill those bygone memories of the 1990s and early 2000.

If you think the current ""Nikita"" series starring Maggie Q is good, then please watch this former version of ""Nikita""! ""La Femme Nikita"" is tops!

In the meantime, I'm putting a hold on collecting the Maggie Q version.

When it comes to music and movies, we've to look to the past to find inspiration. ""La Femme Nikita"" is one such inspiration.

2611057,5,B000GGSLSG,"What can I say about this series - it had everything: beauty, brains, amazing cinematography, directing, choreography, music, acting... Sunday nights were spent glued to the television waiting desperately for 10pm to come around. Michael and Nikita enraptured me and millions of other viewers with their heart-breaking relationship, ultimately doomed to failure. I purchased the series on dvd immediately as the discs came out, so I spent a considerable amount of money on them. There's a lot of good stuff on there, outtakes, funny bits, extra deleted scenes, and a beautifully rendered original reunion between Michael and Nikita in S5 that never got to the screen because of censors.

I'd heard a couple of years ago that WB (CW) was going to reboot the series under the moniker Nikita with a new, younger cast... I haven't been able to bring myself to watch that disaster. I'm sure the youngsters will watch it, but at 28, the original LFN will always be the best - Roy Dupuis and Peta Wilson will always be Michael and Nikita and nothing will ever beat that original series. With the 'reinvention,' I'd hoped Time Warner/CW/WB would give us die-hard fans the reunion we've been clamoring for, for YEARS, but alas, they haven't and I suspect we won't ever get to see 'our' Michael and Nikita onscreen again.

For those of you who got turned on to the franchise by the reboot, Nikita, watch the original series, and you'll never go back to the watered down, unoriginal show that is Nikita. There's a reason CW rebooted it, the series was a hit. But nothing will ever replace the original in my, and many others', hearts.",1320624000,2,1623,4.813620071684587

There are minor glitches in some episodes but did not affect those episodes too much. Overall I am satisfied with the set.

It was so good to watch Michael and Nikita again after all these years.  I had been indecisive for a couple of years to purchase the dvds. When ""Nikita"" starring Maggie Q first screened in my country I had to get La Femme Nikita.  La Femme Nikita is the best series ever.  The soundtracks, storylines, the characters, everything about this show surpasses Maggie Q's version.",1314316800,3,656,4.629310344827586

2611061,5,B000GGSLSG,"This series is killer! In the day, I would always clear Sunday nights to be home to watch it. Every role was cast and played to perfection. Operations was the cold-hearted bureaucrat who inevitably got results. Madeline was the quiet, beautiful but ruthless chief-of-staff slightly past her prime. Walter was the biker rebel weapons expert with a semi-soft heart. Berkhardt was the techie wiz who could run a Hammond filter and an FFT on a terrorist's video signal, deduce everything about their organization from it, and radio Michael or Nikita, who had infiltrated the hide-out and were hacking into the terrrorist's computer, the Unix commands to find and abort the rogue program that was going to trigger the explosion that would destroy the free world. Michael was the deadly enigmatic anti-hero who piled layers of stone over his agonized humanity. And Nikita? Ah, Nikita! She was truly lovely. She was truly loveable. But she was truly fearsome. The action was gripping. The musical score pushed right up to the cutting edge. The cinematography was awesome - those cold, stark, snowy vistas both set and fit the mood perfectly! And the tone was unremittingly amoralistic, violent, and ambivalent. Evil scumbags were sure to be relentlessly hunted down and unsparingly terminated. Yet everyone from Section involved would feel at least a twinge of conscience, whether they admitted it - or even realized it - or not. Had to love it. My only concern about this product is that the binding that holds the leaves containing the disc trays to the package cover is weak. Handle them carefully. I had to glue one back in within the first week I had it. But a little cautious handling is a small price to pay for the thrill of this set. Get it!",1301011200,2,1743,4.852348993288591

Afterward I went searching for Dupuis' other work and came across the La Femme Nikita series. I bought the first season to see what it was all about and was absolutely hooked for the next several weeks as I ordered and watched seasons 2 through 5.  A diehard fan of NFL football, the playoffs for me almost became NFL vs. LFN. The series is mesmerizing. The acting is wonderful, especially by Peta Wilson and Roy Dupuis, who put their very talented hearts and souls into the Nikita/Michael characters. I've never seen such chemistry between two actors, and they kept it up time after time, until the very last episode. The look, the sound, the feel, and clearly the subject matter of the series are timeless. Hard to believe it's been over 10 years since it first aired.

2611086,4,B000GGSLSG,"I never expected to, but I got caught up in LFN and ended up watching every episode.  This took some time.

The good news is that the creators of LFN were absolute geniuses at making the most of limitations, like low budgets and awful Canadian winter weather.  There are some truly wonderful moments, usually at the very end of episodes.  (The one where Nikita tries to bring a family out of a totalitarian country but is only able to get the children out, comes to mind).  Way above average.

That said, this series is relentlessly grim.  There is barely a chuckle in the entire 5 years.  Even the outtakes on the DVDs are low key.  And then, there is the way in which the ""good guys"" interrogate  the bad guys.  Trust me, even Dick Cheney wouldn't go that far.

So, you get pretty people, plenty of action.  But its all very sad.  And then there are not one, but two rather sad endings (seasons 4 and 5).  By the last episode it seems nearly everyone is dead.  Will Nikita live to see the freedom she has fought so hard for?  See for yourself.",1191628800,10,1045,4.331606217616581

2611088,5,B000GGSLSG,"Best series of it's Genre, simple as that.  The writing, cinematography, and directing are all top notch, generally movie quality.  They managed to stay on task the whole series, continuing to pull the rug out from under you regarding the development of the main characters.
Caution:  Extremely addictive.  After watching a couple of episodes, you will  be hooked and begin neglecting your responsibilities until you've finished this series.
Most probably don't know that this show ended after season 4, and the shortened season 5 was created only after unprecedented fan pressure on USA network to bring it back and do a better job of ending the series, which I think they did in season 5.  X files meets Mission Impossible is the best way to describe this show.

2611090,5,B000GGSLSG,"I watched every single minute of every episode USA aired of this absolutely outstanding series!  I lived for Sunday nights and it didn't matter where I was or what I was doing, I stopped to watch this show.  I actually worked it into my schedule and Sunday nights revolved around this show.  I was so heartbroken when they cancelled it due to budget constraints.  I still cling to some fleeting hope that someday they will revive the series, but I think that is only a dream at this point.

It's hard to describe what made this show so good.  Perhaps it was the irresistable and ever-evolving love story between Michael and Nikita.  You were always left guessing:  Is this just a Section ploy or does Michael really love her?  Will they ever be together?  Ooooooo.  Titillating!  Kept me hanging on week after week!  Or perhaps it was the eclectic and fashionable aura the creators were able to infuse into each episode, from Nikita's open-aired apartment, the outfits of the characters, Madeline's private little garden in her ""office"", or all those deserted back hallways of Section.  Or perhaps it was the funky, cool, rhythmic tunes that seemed to find their way into each episode.  Depeche Mode, Enigma, Morcheeba, Garbage, Gus Gus, and a whole host of other little-known artists created some ever-so-cool grooves for Nikita, and I have them all on CD.  Or maybe it's just the fact that I like a good chick-with-a-gun show where the heroine is a classy, beautiful, bad-mamma-jamma, with a great upper cut and roundhouse kick, fighting against the system for the good of the people!

Whatever it is, La Femme Nikita will remain my favorite TV show for all time...and I doubt I'll ever find another show to replace its stellar standing in my heart.  Some shows are just magic, and this is one of them.",1175040000,105,1804,4.745980707395498

I had stoped keeping up witht he serese for the last two seasons and was real excitred to see where the writers took the story line. Although not highly impressed with the lack of good acting, and obvous budget cutts in season 4 and 5. Still my need to see how it ended was fulfilled and i loved every minute of it!!!",1169078400,6,393,3.9873417721518987

8132006,3,B000GGSLSG,"This disc set was almost everything I wanted and expected--up until I got to the fifth (and final) season. There were only eight episodes in the last season, and they're all on the fifth season disc set. What is not on the fifth season disc set are closed captions/subtitles in English. There are French and Spanish subtitles, but none in English, despite the entire set being advertised as closed captioned. I have a hearing deficit, and I depend on the closed captions to understand the spoken dialogue. This was very disappointing. I have seen disc sets of older series that weren't captioned, but most of these were made before closed captioning was made standard for U.S. television broadcast. Season Five of La Femme Nikita, being the most recent, should have had the captions already created, but the producers of this set neglected to include them. This was very disappointing.

Besides the episodes, most discs include ""cancelled scenes"" (scenes that were filmed and then cut), most with commentary from the producers and/or Eugene Robert Glazer, who played Operations/Paul Wolff. Two seasons include a gag reel.

The set may have been produced for sale outside the United States. I use a software package to track my DVD collections that enters each item from its UPC code. The UPC codes on these disc sets (there are five boxes, one for each season) came up with no match.

Production quality is very good. I cannot understand why this last season omitted the closed captions in English. If you can live with that, and you love the show, it's a worthwhile purchase.",1489449600,4,1576,4.895131086142322
