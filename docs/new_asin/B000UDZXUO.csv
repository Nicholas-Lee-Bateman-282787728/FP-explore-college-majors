5099175,5,B000UDZXUO,"A beautiful film illuminating and humanizing the world of the porn industry.  And whoever does the lighting and the make-up are amazing!!!!  I have no interest in being in the porn industry (I'm sure they'd have no interest in me being in it either : ) ), but I wish I could look like those women - soooo beautiful!!  The music and the cinemaphotography are also really great.  And the girls are funny and super bright.  I must admit that I really know nothing about Adult entertainment (save a strange lunch I catered 15 years ago in my 20's where all the folks showed up in crowns and cheesy between-takes robes).  Having watched the documentary I feel I had the opportunity to have conversations with interesting and dynamic women who had a unique story to share.  My favorite had to be the agent Fran (I think).  You should see the movie for her comments alone.",1367798400,7,865,4.535483870967742
5099176,5,B000UDZXUO,I may have seen some of these girls perform in their films yet I never would have expected their stories to be so interesting. I have read some of the reviews and personally they missed the mark. This is not a pretty picture painted by a female director but a viewpoint seen through her lens where the Adult Stars are given an opportunity to shed some light on their lives. Porn is a subject that will always start somewhat of a debate with moral issues and such but at least here you get to understand a little bit more about these women and you will see that these girls know exactly what they are doing in the industry. Having downloaded the film from iTunes I actually look forward to owning my own personal copy. Insightful.,1367798400,,729,4.407407407407407
5099177,5,B000UDZXUO,"Deborah Anderson has delivered a very inspiring look at the human condition of a group of women that work in what is probably the most harshly scrutinized cabinet of the entertainment industry. Many watchers I feel were looking at this documentary to resemble your standard documentary like a Michael Moore film. This film was never meant to resemble a typical documentary and should not be judged as such. This is an art form documentary that is a chronology of the photographic process in which Deborah Anderson produced and completed her new book. This is not a historical documentary of the porn industry, nor is it about pornography, which Deborah herself clearly states in the opening minutes. This documentary is about the fragile life situations that these women face on a daily basis in this industry. The cinematography was superb. The black & white/color transition added a very ""noir"" overtone to the vibe of the film. Deborah herself looked stunning and did a phenomenal job bringing the images and stories of each girl to the surface. The film was also decorated with a superb original soundtrack by Deborah's brother, Damion Anderson. It was refreshing to hear such original, tactile and sharp music driving the film along instead of your typical trite canned themes that are often heard. After reading several previous reviews from other websites, it is sad to realize that some people these days have lost their sensibilities for understanding the arts and the unabated portrayal of ones direction and vision. Deborah Anderson accomplished exactly what she set out to do. She cleverly brought an important message about the human condition across beautifully interwoven with stunning visuals and clear and present artistic depiction. This is a must see for the fine art enthusiast and anyone who loves a challenging film.",1367712000,14,1838,5.13
5099178,1,B000UDZXUO,"I am not one to write reviews, however, I felt compelled to write one for this documentary. Personally, I love a good documentary and after I learned of this one from an article -- I was looking forward to watching it. The opening sequence is highly stylized with this amazing low rider type car driving down a street in what looks like Beverly Hills -- the film is in black and white (no color) and the sun is peaking through the homes and angles of the car which is really cool. Other than that this documentary is mostly about a group of current porn stars who talk about how they love the business etc. The documentary only has ONE setting which is a nice home (built in the 80s) located in Hollywood Hills. I was disapointed that this documentary did not contain any footage from behind the scenes (on set), or a porn studio office (e.g. Vivid) or something from a porn stars life (e.g. real home). The video only showed the girls getting thier makeup and hair done which basically glamorizes an industry or profession that is not always that glamorous. I wish that it would have been a more realistic story of porn stars as documentaries usually do, however, this one is highly stylized with the talking heads of the porn actresses and highly stylized camera movement. By the end -- I really wanted to just turn it off. Basically its a documentary made by a woman (photographer) and maybe it might be enjoyed more by women? I am not even sure of that :-)",1367539200,7,1460,4.47191011235955
5099179,3,B000UDZXUO,"Kind of boring and not that great to be honest. It wasn't horrible or anything, but I did fall asleep during the middle of it. In my opinion, not really worth the rental price.",1425686400,,176,4.205882352941177

5099181,4,B000UDZXUO,"I was hoping for more depth out of the interviews.  A little shallow for me, touches the surface but doesn't go very deep.",1416960000,,122,4.304347826086956

5099183,2,B000UDZXUO,"Deborah Anderson selects porn stars who are mostly age 22-26 and asks them all the same questions, have them pose the same way, and essentially all give the same answer. Yes, all these women are in porn because that was their first option. No one was there because they couldn't get a job somewhere else, support a drug habit, save money for college, or support their kid. None of the girls had horrific stories about being raped by a family member or clergy.

The film failed to achieve what it set out to do. The persona of the pron star doesn't change when they are in a studio with a camera on them. The film was superficial. I think if she had interviewed old time porn stars and asked them how they started and where they are today, that would have been more interesting. Then showing the new stars those interviews and get a real response without their make up an glitter.

This might be shocking or interesting to people who don't watch porn.

2 stars for the nudity.",1405209600,,975,4.435754189944134
5099184,2,B000UDZXUO,"Trying to ride the wave of the current porn chic, photographer/filmmaker Deborah Anderson swings and misses.  Maybe she doesnt miss by a mile, but this is neither horse shoes nor hand grenades.  The documentary AROUSED, in which Anderson interviews sixteen prominent pornstars, just fails to deliver.

Some of this has to do with Anderson just trying too hard.  One of the great things about porn is that it has a humor about itself (I still remember chuckling when I realized Peter Norths movie line was delightfully called North Pole).  Digging below the surface for something more significant may have some merit, but that does not mean, by any stretch of the imagination, that it should be the porn actresses themselves doing so.  People typically are not geniuses of introspection about themselves and it is unlikely that women choosing porn as a career even reach the level of average on that count.  Dont get me wrong, I often love them.  But their appeal lies heavily on the outer (rather than inner) side of the equation.

Not that the lasses don't have something to add.  Sure, there are some interesting tidbits about how they got into porn and the consequences of that choice.  But it is too little, and too old hat, to save this movie.  Anderson approaches the subject as if it is something new.  But in the age of pornstar biographies and numerous books and movies about the porn world, it is not.  If anything, I will say the cinematography is good.  The girls look great.  If you must watch this, watch it for that.",1398729600,5,1531,4.720754716981132
5099185,5,B000UDZXUO,"I second everything said in the review ""not aroused but impressed"" and would add that it was really fascinating to hear from Fran, the agent, about her thoughts on the industry and the women in it. Definitely worth watching when you are feeling thoughtful (pick something else if you are looking for something to spice up for more social activities).",1393286400,,350,4.85
5099186,2,B000UDZXUO,The first hour is really boring. The second part is only slightly better.  The worst part of the whole thing is the direction and cinematography.  Watching closeups of porn stars getting their makeup done and laying in bed talking...is so boring!,1391990400,,246,4.975609756097561
5099187,3,B000UDZXUO,"I thought the porn stars in documentary were going to be a ""more real,"" but they were not. Most of them appeared to be putting on a front still. Not worth it!",1391212800,,158,3.96875

5099190,3,B000UDZXUO,Many good interviews without all the skin. I was more interested in people's biographies - the reasons why they would choose an industry that exploits them - that question left much to be desired.,1382918400,,196,4.794117647058823

5099192,5,B000UDZXUO,"The documentary gave great insight into the world of these women. Unlike many documentaries, this one definitely sought to bring out the human element of such a taboo world.

5099195,2,B000UDZXUO,"This ""documentary"" about porn is a joke. It's really just a montage of soft porn shots with the girls talking about their childhood, daddy problems and religious upbringing. The only reason I rented it was because I'm a Belladonna fan. I don't know why they decided to put her in the film only to edit her out of it. I'd say she appears in about 4 minutes out of the entire film. What a waste of time and 4 bucks.",1375315200,,413,4.175
5099196,2,B000UDZXUO,"This film, first and foremost, is a vehicle of self-promotion for its director, Ms. Anderson. Beyond that, it shows young, beautiful women talking very briefly about their lives. That has value and interest, however, viewers should not draw conclusions about porn stars from such scanty information. This film is not a documentary. This film is a Playboy-type behind-the-scenes of a nudie photo shoot. That is fine, but, this film touts itself as offering insight through first-hand interviews. It doesn't.
I'm reminded of the Diane Sawyer interview of a young Belladonna on Prime Time Live several years, ago. Belladonna comes across as a very lost soul. My heart goes out to her. Some of the women in this film seem lost or, at least, fooling themselves(and the viewer). One woman tearfully said she was afraid she might have ""f'd myself"" by going into this line of work. I would wonder the same thing.
Some of the most truthful bits of information are spoken by Fran, the Adult Talent Agent. She said that with each scene, these women permanently lose a part of their souls, and that they should earmark half of their fortunes to therapy. One of the women said being a porn star is like being a stunt man, in that they are paid well because they are risking their lives doing this kind of work.
If we can watch this film and filter what rings true to us as individuals from what we want to believe, we can begin to have a clearer idea of the lives of porn actors.",1373155200,25,1466,4.620689655172414

I don't know if I judged porn stars before this film or pitied them and their presumed effed up pasts. The women here are positioned as empowered. These actresses are all beautiful and portrayed as whole, sound, thoughtful human beings. I liked the end especially. I do however believe that the film could have been marketed for what it wasinstead of an investigative documentary, perhaps it could have been labeled an artistic, somewhat anthropological fascination. Beautifully shot, and for that alone it's worth four stars. I am definitely going to research some of the women included in this film.",1443484800,,853,5.056737588652482
