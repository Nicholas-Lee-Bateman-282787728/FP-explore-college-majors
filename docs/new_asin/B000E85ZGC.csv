2508983,5,B000E85ZGC,"I happened to catch the end of this debate when it first ran on C-Span I believe it was.  I was so impressed, I ran out and bought a copy as soon as I could find it.  It has been one of the few debates I could enjoy watching more than once.  Both men are Presbyterian ministers and amateur historians but never underestimate the ability of amateurs to provide a professional and thoughtful response.  Of course, I have an opinion about who won the debate but you will have to watch and decide on your own who won.  It is a fascinating debate with a depth that seems rare these days.  It is certain to please the historiphile.",1160611200,7,625,4.254237288135593
2508984,5,B000E85ZGC,"At last!  A clear and comprehensive tool that people can not only use to challenge loved ones, friends and acquaintances that have fallen prey to anti-Christian cults -- it is also a great primer on why doctrine matters.  I've been saying it for years: cults prosper when the Church ceases to be a foundation and bulwark for the Truth.  Maybe this interesting and well-produced DVD will help wake the Church up.",1143590400,14,411,4.76056338028169
2508985,5,B000E85ZGC,"Upon seeing a documentary about cults, you'd normally assume it's going to be a brutal dissection of various groups and their beliefs, and simply pointing out how apostate they are. But THE MARKS OF A CULT is compassionate, educational tool for helping the Christian to identify who is a cult, and who is a legitimate denomination of Christianity.

All of the speakers featured in it are extremely prepared and thoughtful. As always The Apologetics Group has added just enough visual pizazz and musical flare in this documentary to make you forget you're watching a talking head video.",1143590400,11,585,5.030927835051546

2508998,1,B000E85ZGC,"Do not believe the synopsis of this film!  The word ""dispensationalism"" isn't even spoken until the last 2 minutes of the film!  This is nothing but an attack on Mormons, Jehovah's Witnesses, Seventh Day Adventist, etc.  And if you're not sure what a cult is, they spend a bunch of time defining that.  I am a Christian that worships in the Presbyterian church.  So I am not here to defend the churches listed above or even make a judgment for or against them.  My point, though, is that I purchased this movie on Amazon Prime Videos because I thought there was going to be an educated discussion about the history and error of dispensationalism - just as the film was promoted.  And it is not that!  Why they chose to link these above churches with this movement, I cannot figure!  Nowhere can I find these churches as being the historical source of dispensationalism.  So, again, don't waste your money!",1334361600,10,905,4.635220125786163
2508999,4,B000E85ZGC,"This video does a very nice job of presenting the facts and letting you decide for yourself.  Great resource & tool.

2509001,5,B000E85ZGC,Another great documentary by Eric Holmberg. This is a very good study of how christains are deceived by churches that preach another Jesus. The Bible says in the book of Jude to earnestly contend for the faith once delivered to the saints. It says the faith not a faith. Jesus is the Son of God. He is not just a man as they claim. He goes into how to decern a true church from a false church. This is a worthy addition to the church for the end time.,1214092800,,451,4.078651685393258
2509002,4,B000E85ZGC,"Truth matters. The gospel truth is a big deal. Eric Holmberg begins with several apostolic reminders; dire warnings about the coming of the false gospels heralded by false prophets identified  as ""ravenous wolves""; as well as the mandate to contend for the faith that was once for all delivered to the saints; complete, not to be added nor substracted or messed around with. The false gospel is the counterfeit Christianity, that comes in the form of movements or denominations that claim to be Christians, but upon closer scrutiny are not, by examining their fundamental beliefs that reject the cardinal Christian doctrines centered around the doctrines of the Trinity, the identity of Jesus Christ; his deity and human nature, the inspiration, inerrancy and the infallibility of Scriptures, and justification by faith or what Jesus accomplished on the cross. The mathematical signs you see at the DVD cover are a systematic way that the Apologetics Group has excellently formulated for a detailed analysis on how to determine whether a group that calls themselves Christians are indeed legitimately Christians.

While having covered some major counterfeit Christian groups, I was wondering if Holmberg and the Apologetics folks should have added, or should in the future expand their coverage, perhaps calling it ""The Marks of A Cult Part II"", to include prosperity gospel, and the Roman Catholic Church, which requires extra analysis due to the additional subtlety involved.",1210550400,3,1477,5.334763948497854
2509003,4,B000E85ZGC,This film took a good approach when facing cults.  I was glad to see that they threw some Pentacostals in there.  It is really informative and the math signs will leave a lasting impression.  That will probably pop in my head the next time I think of various cults.  It is an excellent way to explain them.  Good film.,1205971200,,318,4.322033898305085
2509004,5,B000E85ZGC,"Marks of a Cult is the latest in a series of DVDs produced by The Apologetics Group and hosted by Eric Holmberg. Previous titles have included Amazing Grace: The History & Theology of Calvinism and Hells Bells 2: The Power and Spirit of Popular Music, both of which I have reviewed in the past (and both of which are well worth viewing). This latest presentation seeks to answer some of the following questions: Why are Baptists properly considered Christians, but Mormons are not? Why is the Jehovah's Witness religion classified as an anti-Christian cult while Presbyterians, Wesleyans and Pentecostals are simply seen as denominations within the Christian faith? How does one differentiate between true Biblical Christianity and an aberrant religious movement? And just what are the marks of a cult?

The presentation describes cults through the four marks developed originally, I believe, by Watchman Fellowship. These marks are easy to remember and are helpful in forming a framework around which we can differentiate a cult from a church. The marks are as simple as add, subtract, multiply and divide.

Add: Cults add to Scripture. The revelation of God provided in the Bible is never sufficient for a cult. Thus they must add to the written revelation of Scripture, usually with additional scriptures or with their own translation of the Bible. In this way we have books such as The Pearl of Great Price of the Mormons and the New World Translation of the Bible produced by the Jehovah's Witnesses. Since the Bible claims exclusivity as the written revelation of God, we must see that other books, even if the followers of cults claim that they are equal to the Bible, must actually be over and above the Word of God.

Subtract: Cults subtract from the person of Christ. Cults cannot tolerate the divinity and exclusivity of Jesus and thus usually reduce Him to being a created being. In some cases they make Jesus only a manifestation or mode of God. In either case, the role of Jesus as revealed in Scripture is diminished.

Multiply: Cults multiply the requirements of salvation. Salvation, as it is presented in the Scriptures, is by God's grace through faith alone. Cults continually add to the requirements of salvation, always adding human works as a necessary prerequisite to salvation. No cult teaches or endorses justification by faith alone. Thus all cults reject the very heart of the gospel.

Divide: Cults divide the loyalty of believers. Each cult believes that it has exclusive revelation and understanding of God that ensures its followers are either exclusively God's people or are somehow more blessed than others. Cults always seek to divide believers against each other based on the previous three marks. Thus cults are, by their very nature, divisive.

Each of these four marks receives a good deal of attention within the presentation. Each one is proven to be true within the belief systems of several different cults including the Seventh Day Adventists, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (the Mormons), Jehovah's Witnesses, Christian Scientists, The Moonies, and Oneness Pentecostals (or the Jesus-Only Movement). Each receives the attention of a large group of highly-regarded Christian apologists. Those who were consulted in the making of this film are:

  * Dr. James R. White, Alpha & Omega Ministries
  * Dr. E. Calvin Beisner, Knox Theological Seminary
  * Dr. R. Fowler White, Knox Theological Seminary
  * James Walker, Watchman Fellowship
  * David Henke, Watchman Fellowship
  * Dr. Steve Cowan, Apologetics Resource Center
  * Craig Branch, Apologetics Resource Center
  * Clete Hux, Apologetics Resource Center
  * Jerry Johnson, The Apologetics Group

As with the previous DVDs released by The Apologetics Group, Marks of a Cult is well-researched, well-made and the facts presented are well-documented. This is a rational, measured, convicting examination of the marks of a cult as they stand against the claims of Scripture. It clocks in at almost two hours which is just enough time to do justice to the topic. It moves quickly and should easily capture the attention of adults and teens. In fact, my only disappointment was in the bonus features which included nothing more than a list of recommended websites and a second list of recommended books dealing with each of the cults. Nevertheless, that is but a small complaint and I am glad to recommend this DVD to you. It would be a valuable addition to any personal or church library.",1200960000,8,4500,5.063685636856369

8107013,1,B000E85ZGC,"This film was a bunch of pots calling a bunch of other pots black.  Unfortunately the Bible is full of seemingly self contradictory verses. I grew up Church of Christ and could not reconcile the fact that other kids I knew weren't saved although they were Christian.  According to these guys you either have to trust that their Doctor of Divinity is superior to some other guy or be a Bible genius yourself.  Otherwise you're an apostate ,and you're gonna burn.  These guys make their living discussing polemics even though they call themselves apologists.  At a time when more and more people are returning away from Christianity, we don't need more division. My definition of a cult is any group that pushes you to do something you know is wrong and you do it anyway because you fear being outed.  If you don't have integrity, religion can be a very dangerous place.  Jesus is the definition of integrity.",1473897600,,907,4.7025316455696204
8107014,1,B000E85ZGC,"Hmmmmm,

According to them any group that adds or subtracts books from the Bible is a cult. The Roman Catholic Church recognizes more books of the Bible than most Protestants. That is because ----------you guessed it -----------------------the Roman Catholic Church is a cult.

I'm Catholic.  I happen to enjoy the way we worship.  God is wonderful and loving; we are all welcome to worship in the faith of our choosing. Figure out what works best for you and just PRAY!

In the meantime, don't judge others. If people choose to worship differently -- let them.

I am interested in cults. Where is the line that separates a cult from other religions?  This movie didn't help me find the answer, because I quit when they started the anti-catholic rant.",1463788800,,751,4.8203125
8107015,5,B000E85ZGC,One of the best books on evaluating the cults.  Simple to understand.,1453248000,,69,4.75
8107016,5,B000E85ZGC,"Excellent synopsis of aberrant Christian theology.  Contrary to those who are members and have left negative reviews, I find this documentary consistent with historic Biblical theology.  Well done!",1447718400,,197,6.0
8107017,1,B000E85ZGC,"This ""documentary"" is replete with logical fallacies.  First, they define cult as false doctrine, but false doctrine in their human interpretation of it.  Early in the film they reference Jude's comment about contending for the faith that once for all delivered to the saints.  They assert that means that everything was completed then.  If that be true then every verse in Jude after that verse should be excised from the Bible.  Second, the use of the term ""cult"" is a tenuous term.  As an expert in the treatment of individuals who have escaped high demand groups, I find the word confusing.  Perhaps it is clearer to distinguish between false doctrine, which is teaching contrary to the Bible, and cult, which is a pattern of abuse of members by the leadership and their minions.  Third, the film gives very broad brush strokes describing some of the groups it attacks.  It does a more thorough job with Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses, a moderate job with Seventh Day Adventists, a minimal job with Pentacostals, and a horrendous job with the Church of Christ.  Those of us who work with ex-cult members recognize that Sacred Science is one tactic used by leaders.  Robert Jay Lifton (Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism) identified the belief that one's own dogma is scientific and not to be challenged.  While pointing to this dynamic in its objects of attack, the filmmakers engage in the exact tactic they condemn.  They make the point that many churches claim to believe ""orthodox"" Christian belief while they don't really.  The filmmakers claim they accept other denominations while they really don't.  Fourth, the filmmakers equate ""historical"" Christianity and ""Biblical"" Christianity.  At the same time, they identify ancient doctrines that they believe were false doctrine.  Yet these false doctrines are part of historical Christianity.  Much of Catholic doctrine would be rejected by the filmmakers, but this doctrine has a much longer history of majority acceptance.  Fifth, the filmmakers are either misinformed or intentionally lie about some of the beliefs they challenge.  For example, they talk about the Restoration Movement and say that its adherents believe that genuine Christian practice was lost for 1700 years.  A few adherents to that group do believe that, but the majority do not.  Rather, the term was given post-hoc to a movement that believed that the Reformation movement had failed to make the correct reforms.  Specifically, the early leaders believed that the religious hierarchy of the denominations were isomorphic to the very Catholic hierarchy they claimed to oppose.  Luther eventually completely broke from the Catholic church because he came to believe that it could not be reformed.  That is, he had to restore (restoration) what the Catholic church had perverted.  In short, it appears the filmmakers want to attack certain groups and sound logical while doing it.  Yet they engage in syllogisms where the premises are questionable due to either accidental or intentional skewing of the beliefs of the groups they attack.  While I do believe some of the groups they attack may indeed be dangerous, the filmmakers have not provided a fair analysis of all the groups.",1438819200,,3224,5.148076923076923
8107018,5,B000E85ZGC,"This documentary covers exactly the material I thought it would after reading the title and the summary. It is a good brief introduction about some of the sects of Christianity which are not considered to be ""mainstream"" and why they (according to this documentary) are seen as cults. There is also a brief history about most of the denominations covered and a little background. They then define the criteria by which they have made this decision and offer a clever mnemonic (pictured on the cover as the four basic symbols of mathematics) to remember these by. Christians should definitely watch this film to get a good idea of the criticisms aimed toward these denominations by the mainstream and the reasoning for them making these determinations whether you agree with them or not. Most Christians cannot even articulate the basic differences. You might find yourself surprised about your own ""mainstream"" denomination by applying the biblical criteria mentioned here.",1436659200,,973,5.203821656050955
