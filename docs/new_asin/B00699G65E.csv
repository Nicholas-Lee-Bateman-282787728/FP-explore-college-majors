4980426,4,B00699G65E,"[Not to be confused with ""The Debt,"" a 2011 John Madden-directed remake.]

""The Debt"" (2007) is an Israeli thriller drama about three Mossad operatives Rachel, Zvi and Ehud on a secret mission to capture a Nazi doctor in East Berlin. They return to their country with their mission accomplished, and become sort of heroes. Thirty years later, they find a strange newspaper article about the doctor they had exterminated. Rachel travels to Kiev to do what she should do, but what did really happen to the three agents thirty years ago? And what will a retired agent Rachel do?

The film's story goes back and forth between two timelines, 1964 and 1994, and events are traced from the viewpoint of agent Rachel, young and old. The contrast between the young and inexperienced Rachel (Neta Garty) and the experienced and tired one (Gila Almagor) is nicely done. Director Assaf Bernstein's film is less about action and mystery than characters, especially Rachel, and how they confront with each other and their past, and it works.

However, the intriguing premise of ""The Debt"" is somewhat undermined by several events that seem implausible. Also, as a thriller it lacks convincing detail (in the 1994 part, in particular) and as a drama the interaction between the ""Surgeon"" and Rachel (and other agents) is certainly tense, but all too brief. Considering the unanimously strong performances from the cast, the 1964 sequence could have been more intense with someone like Roman Polanski (I'm talking about ""Death and the Maiden"").

""The Debt"" is a spy thriller with more focus on characters and their psychology. It is fine as such, but more attention to what they do would have been helpful.",1356652800,4,1690,4.9822695035460995

4980428,4,B00699G65E,"I enjoyed this Israeli film; had seen the one with Helen Mirren,(THE DEBT) but there were some surprising differences. Want to see the H. Mirren one again. The original film from Israel is titled Ha HA HOV and is subtitled.",1349136000,,223,4.6
4980429,4,B00699G65E,"This was so well done, why a remake just a few years later? Just for it to be in English? Whatever the reasons, the 2011 version I tried to see on Amazon Instant Video was not available anyway. I was a bit perturbed - but after seeing this one, I'm quite satisfied.",1344124800,,265,4.115384615384615
4980430,5,B00699G65E,"Even though the film is in Israeli subtitles, you are quickly drawn into the story of the Mossad agents and their pact. The plot weaves the past and the present in such a way you don't even realize that the actors are not speaking English!! And the fight scene at the end must be seen to be believed. Helen Mirren and Co. did a nice job on the remake, but it doesn't touch the original.",1332892800,6,386,4.16
4980431,5,B00699G65E,"A friend recommended the U.S version (with Helen Mirren, 2011), but I love foreign films and liked the idea that this was the original version. Even though there were only 2 reviews, both highly recommended the film.  I saw this via Amazon Instant Video.  It does keep you on the edge till the very end.  I haven't seen the later version so can't provide a comparison, but the acting here in the Israeli version was excellent and the story told very well.  The one ""spy"" or female agent showed warmth and a very human side, unlike what you might expect.  I'd highly recommend it.",1330905600,8,579,4.528846153846154
4980432,4,B00699G65E,"""The Debt"" (original 2007 release from Israel; 100 min.) brings the story of 3 Mossad agents in the mid-60s hunting down (fictitious) Nazi criminal Dieter Vogel a/k/a the ""Surgeon of Birkenau"" who is now living in Berlin and working as a doctor in private practice. In fact they manage to abduct and capture Vogel. However before they are able to transport/smuggle Vogel out of Berlin into Israel, Vogel manages to escape. The 3 Mossag agents now are faced with a terrible embarrasment for both themselves and Israel. They decide to cover up what has happened, simply saying that Vogel was killed in a struggle. The agents then return to Israel in triumph. That is where the movie really takes off, examining the legacy/debt of living with such a lie. Then one day 30 years later, there is a rumor that a man claiming to be Surgeon of Birkenau is alive and well in Ukraine. I will not spoil the rest of the plot, you'll just have to see it for yourself.

Maybe you saw the 2011 Hollywood remake starring Helen Mirren, Sam Worthington and Jessica Chastain, maybe not. I saw the Hollywood remake last year, and when I compare the two, the original movie shines and is simply better. Why you may ask? Several reasons: one, there is a huge plot point that is radically different in the two movies, which I simply cannot understand why Hollywood felt compelled to change. Two, the Hollywood remake focues way too much on the love triangle (or not) between the female and the 2 male Mossad agents, which is absent in the original movie. As a result of the latter, the original movie is riveting and tense from start to finish, whereas the Hollywood movie has to have the occasional romantic interlude. I'm not saying that the Hollywood remake is bad per so, it is not. But compared to the original Israeli movie, it simply is not as good.

I am happy to see that the original Israeli is finally getting a proper DVD release in the US. I just saw it recently at the 2012 Jewish & Israeli Film Festival here in Cincinnati. In all, the original ""The Debt"" is highly recommended!",1329091200,28,2069,4.589189189189189
4980433,5,B00699G65E,"This 2007 original version of the film currently in the theaters with an entirely new cast and crew and know as THE DEBT is the version written by Ido Rubenstien and writer/director Assaf Bernstein: their story and screen play were the nidus for the current version. This version HA HOV is in Hebrew and German with English subtitles and because this viewer has not seen the current THE DEBT in the theaters it is difficult to compare the two.  That really is not a significant matter as HA HOV stands solidly on its own as a brilliant film.

The film opens at a gala party in Israel where Rachel Brenner (Gila Almagor) is being honored again for her role in ending the life of the infamous 'surgeon of Birkenau' who during WW II did heinous experiments on human beings in the camps of Birkinau, including being responsible for  the death of Rachel's mother.  But news arrives that at all old folks home in the Ukraine that the surgeon is still alive: the three Mossad agents (Rachel - played at the young age by Neta Garty, Zvi - Itay Tiran, and Ehud - Oded Teomi) in 1965, Mossad agents sent to capture the surgeon erroneously allowed him to escape and promising to keep their secret, told the papers that he committed suicide.  Rachel, Zvi and Ehud decide they must complete their broken mission and go to the Ukraine, fine the surgeon and kill him.  Zvi and Ehud are not up to the task, so it is left to Rachel to finish their mission.  The suspenseful hunt and chase is how the mission is accomplished.

The manner in which the film is set into motion is a seamless interchange of the years 1944 during the war and the black and white images of the concentration camps, and 1965 when the three young Mossad agents captured the surgeon (and their interaction with him before his escape) and the present when the now 60ish Rachel carries out her duty.  It is chilling, rich in character development, and maintains a degree of tension that is almost unbearable at times. But the other aspect of this film that keeps it form being yet another memoir of the mistreatment of the Jews in WW II  is the element of humanity in each of the three Mossad agents as they deal with their task and yet interact with the evil and warped surgeon.  This is a very strong film, one that deserves an audience at least equal to those who have seen or will see THE DEBT.  Grady Harp, September 11",1316304000,4,2379,4.468822170900693

4980436,5,B00699G65E,"There are so many great things to say about the Debt.  As a finance thriller set in the Peruvian countryside and in the bustling metropolis of New York, it follows a businessman as he convinces several farmers to sell their land.  At first it seems like the plot is quite simple, but soon you realize there is much more than meets the eye.  Stephen Dorff plays the conflicted businessman that is torn between supporting his family and his moral code.  David Strathairn plays his demanding boss that doesnt take no for an answer.  The plot is always taking twists and turns, and you never really know what anyones true intentions are until the end. I highly recommend this film to anyone looking for an intriguing work of art.",1469577600,,725,4.6328125
4980437,4,B00699G65E,"I have to give my applause to up and coming director Barney Elliott for his work on this one. A film based on power and greed that also dives into how executive decisions can affect even the smallest and seemingly insignificant person. Set in both NYC and Peru, we get to see veteran talent Stephen Dorff play Oliver, an investment banker who is pressured by his boss to obtain land bonds from Peru. At first, more concerned about his career, Oliver soon sees how wrong he and his boss's decisions are and the damage they've caused. Structured with three story lines, this film starts you off hating each of the main characters but then rooting for them. I can't say I recall many films that are able to do that. I feel that Elliott was really thoughtful when writing and prepared when directing this film which reflects in the short-handness of driving this story. Very well done.",1469491200,,881,4.617834394904459
4980438,5,B00699G65E,"Christine Vachon discovers another talent with this film. As an Executive Producer, she must have really believed in Barney Elliott's vision, and in my opinion he had a great one. Not only is The Debt culturally infused with a racially diverse cast and two different settings (NYC & Peru), but it also places a focus on social injustice and how greatly a population can be affected. For example, the scenes with Mara and her sick mother dealing with a strict healthcare system with no money to cure her were the most powerful to me, but the part where the farmer must choose between saving his land and getting his son to the emergency room in time was also very emotional. The Debt was unlike any drama I've ever seen, and really a breath of fresh air in these racially divided times. 2 thumbs up!",1469404800,,798,4.548611111111111
4980439,5,B00699G65E,Excellent story about tough choices one sometimes has to make. Beautiful scenery in Peru. Highly recommend.,1468627200,,107,5.75
4980440,4,B00699G65E,"The Debt is a non-stop thrill ride based around the economic tension of Perus agrarian reform. Stephen Dorff plays Oliver Campbell, a highly regarded banker who is fixated on securing a deal involving a piece of land in Peru. The film is paced expertly which is accompanied by its great performances from Dorff and Elsa Olivero. In my opinion, young writer-director Barney Elliott has secured a future in the film industry with this indie hit. Its amazing to see this amount of talent all across the board; I highly recommend The Debt for independent film lovers.",1468454400,,563,4.875
4980441,4,B00699G65E,"I realize in in the minority here, and I can't claim anything other than my subjective experience, but for me this was a rare case where I actually prefered the 2010 Hollywood remake.  To be fair, that could be because I saw the re-make first, and whenever we're first exposed to anything - a story, a song - that version tends to get stuck in our mind as the 'definitive' or 'right' version.  And with a thriller, you can only experience the twists the first time once.

But all that said, I don't know if it was the acting, the writing or the directorial style, but  for whatever reason  I found myself both more moved and more chilled by the re-make.  In particular I personally found Helen Mirren more affecting than her Israeli counterpart, Gila Almagor.

In either case, this is an  intelligent and clever spy thriller, with interesting moral overtones.  And this version is still a strong film, with a couple of very powerful scenes between the agents and their Nazi prey that handily beat out their counterparts in the re-make.  Well worth seeing, especially if - like me - you're into films enough that seeing two different versions is fun, not a chore.",1455408000,,1162,4.624390243902439

4980458,5,B00699G65E,"There is little I can add to the plot description of two top reviews of this film. I saw both films and this version, the original, is much more realistic and tighter than the remake. The two Rachels are perfectly cast --physically, you can see one becoming the other.

While young Rachel wears all her emotions on her sleeve, older Rachel  has learned to conceal things and live with ambiguity. Yet you can see many repressed emotions simmering underneath her grand dame exterior as she comes back to discharge her debt, and do away with the grotesque Nazi doctor who escaped while in her charge during an aborted Mossad mission in the 1960's, though the very thought of him still terrifies her.

The performances of Gila Almagor and Neta Garty are superb, but Edgar Selge as the unrepentant Surgeon of Birkenau, Max Rainer, is bone chilling. You first see him as a man of science, an obstetrician helping women with fertility problems. You also see photographic examples of his handiwork at the camps. The mentality of this being is so unnerving, his uncensored thoughts about his 'work' so terrifying that no matter how much  Holocaust material you have seen or read, it will make your skin crawl.

Although I thought I knew what to expect when the mature Rachel goes after Rainer in his hiding place in modern Ukraine, I was literally on the edge of my chair and surprised in the end.

4980467,5,B00699G65E,"I wrote a review for the English version of ""The Debt"", so I feel a little obligated to provide a review of the original.  I found it to be a little more subdued and subtle, and slightly melancholic... very preferable to the slightly excessive edge of the remake.  The twin roles of Rachel (played in this movie by Gila Almagor and Nety Garty) mesh much more closely than do Jessica Chastain and Helen Mirren in the remake.  In this version, you really can believe that Almagor is the aged Rachel, because she is about the same height as Garty, and her face resembles a fleshed-out, careworn version of Garty's youthful beauty.

In this version, also, the character of the Nazi ""Butcher of Birgenau"" is not taken to the Mephistophelean extremes of the remake.  Instead of a histrionic battle between good and evil, what is presented very simply shows the toll exacted by Rachel's task of putting the past to rest.  No vicarious revenge fest. It is something that every person can relate to in coming to grips with one's life.

However, there is plenty to enjoy in this film.  Much of the film is shot in close-up, and the cast shine in this demanding mode of acting.  We frequently pull away to three-quarters overhead angles, very reminiscent of 1940s noir films.  Definitely worth viewing, but not very suspenseful.",1474848000,,591,5.114583333333333
