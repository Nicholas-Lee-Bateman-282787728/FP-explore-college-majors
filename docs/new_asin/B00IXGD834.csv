6302464,5,B00IXGD834,With George Dzundza murdered off of the show with the first season I nearly decided to stop watching the series. I always thought the arrogant Chris Noth was a better candidate to be murdered off of the show. Paul Sorvino was an able replacement for George Dzundza's character. One thing that was noticeable from the beginning was that just about every episode is very well written and acted with story-lines pulled right from news stories.,1471651200,,440,4.88
