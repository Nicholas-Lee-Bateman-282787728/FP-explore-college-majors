8762315,3,B01G4B4V8U,"The main question I have for aliens is, why are you all flying spaceships or running around ""Completely Nude""? Is there perhaps a shortage of clothing material on other planets? What the aliens should be concentrating their efforts on is acquiring clothes instead of abducting people, before making any public appearances.
I mean...really, how seriously would anyone take an alien standing before them and demanding their submission whilst totally in the buff. I know that I'd be laughing my tail off!",1500768000,,501,5.197530864197531
8762316,3,B01G4B4V8U,"Everything was on one DVD, and the narrator spoke too fast--and the programming was fast and furious. It's less than about 2 hours and could have been done a lot better.  Not the quality of Ancient Aliens, originally on the History Channel.  For that series, I have 1-6, 7 and 8.  Series 9 is a repeat of one of the earlier series, so that one is not worth getting.  Ancient Aliens is entertaining and very professionally done.  One thing I really likes was you got to see a lot of interesting places around the world, that you normally wouldn't see.  Re Unsealed, if I knew how the content was presented, I would not have purchased it.",1492905600,3,636,4.439655172413793

8762318,5,B01G4B4V8U,"I've been waiting for a DVD copy of ANYTHING from Unsealed for sometime now, however, the episode listing is incorrect. The last episode titled: ""Top 10 Conspiracies"", is actually and episode about Remote Viewing, and the first 2 episodes are reversed. Not a deal breaker by any means, and still fascinating viewing, with good quality production.",1487203200,4,346,5.196428571428571
8762319,4,B01G4B4V8U,The video quality is wonderful I'm happy to say but there is no menu other than 3 sections and no closed captioning. I've been waiting forever to get this on DVD and hope the complete series will be available sometime.,1483056000,3,218,4.475
