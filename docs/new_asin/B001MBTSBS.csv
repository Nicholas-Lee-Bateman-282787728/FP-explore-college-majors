8320846,5,B001MBTSBS,Good movie. Of course not Hollywood type quality but you have to realize this is only 32 mins long and is a very low budget movie from a small church but they did a good job of giving you an idea of what Gods prophet Hosea had to go through to show the undying love and grace of God,1399248000,,282,3.7966101694915255
8320847,1,B001MBTSBS,THe worst movie I've seen In ages. Not worth it for free. THe director was sleeping when he did this ..it's horrible and bad acting not worth spending any money ever. I don't recommend this to the deaf and blind it was so bad,1375142400,,225,4.136363636363637
8320848,5,B001MBTSBS,"Crissy Moran is a woman of God, it takes bravery to come out of the porn industry and then confess that you have given your life to Jesus Christ and left that former life behind... I support this movie, it is cool, I hope Crissy continues to make more movies",1284681600,4,258,4.18
8320849,5,B001MBTSBS,"I saw a review that said Christina ""Crissy"" Moran was a lot like Natalie Wood. When I saw that I had to see the movie. I was not disappointed.  I was a great Natalie Wood fan as was everyone I knew. Now I am a big Christina  Moran fan",1257120000,,234,3.7551020408163267
8320850,4,B001MBTSBS,"If you compare this to celebrity actresses/actors it will just not match up. However the message makes the poor acting in scenes do-able.

I think that in the end the short film in it self, just was not long enough to develop the relationship that the audience needs to see between Josh & Sophie, but  you understand where the idea is going.

What would Hosea look like if in today's world it took place? If a Pastor married a Stripper? How would people respond? How would churches respond. It takes a hard look at the reality of where church stands, while it shows the reality of what God calls us to do. To show grace where even looking at each of our own lives grace is not deserved.

It is no where close to the depth of the Book of Hosea, but it gives a fresh look into how we can transpose something in the Bible to making it relevant today. The Narrator & Pastor sums up the story well, and sums up that this is in no way to replace Hosea in the least.

In the end, I think the ideas of the movie were good, though the relationships within needed to be lengthen. And the acting wasn't the best, I think the pastor summed it up nicely in the end.  For a short-film thats 32 minutes long I think it got the message across that God shows grace where it is not deserved.",1245283200,5,1273,4.1755102040816325
8320851,2,B001MBTSBS,"It's painful to watch Moran struggle through this film, clearly trying too hard to prove herself as a legitimate actress. Zimpel is adequate, given the material he's working with. I didn't necessarily want these 32 minutes back, as the film was mildly entertaining. However, I don't think I would pay $15 to view it.",1228089600,2,316,4.87037037037037
