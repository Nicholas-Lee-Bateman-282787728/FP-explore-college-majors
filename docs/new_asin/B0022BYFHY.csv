8349611,5,B0022BYFHY,"After finishing ""Plus"" square dance lessons at my local club, I was looking for someting that would help me to both review and improve on what I had learned.  This video reallly fit the bill!  All of the square dancers in the video are very skilled, and reallly help to illustrate what is being taught by the various calls.  They are very colorful and show alot of flair, but they also show great form, posture, tequnique and timing for each of the calls.  Most dancers will probably not get anywhere near their level of expertise, but it is something to strive for.  I purchased their ""Mainstream"" video a while back, and I was very happy with it.  I am happy to see that this ""Plus"" level video holds on to the same high quality standards!  I highly recommend this video to all square dance fans!",1491004800,,798,4.462068965517242
8349612,5,B0022BYFHY,"We had been away from square dancing for a very long time...years even.  These lessons have been so very helpful... We can go to dances, lessons and actually recognize the calls making this relearning process so much easier and quicker..  The caller is clear and the dancers are wonderful. Thanks!",1448755200,,297,4.92
8349613,5,B0022BYFHY,"These videos have been invaluable in learning to Square Dance Plus.  We reviewed these lessons before we went for our plus lesson, and after we graduated we still review it before we head off to a dance.  We love square dancing and these lessons help give us confidence. Thank you so much, Traveling Hoedowners for  making these lessons available.",1410739200,,347,4.8474576271186445
8349614,5,B0022BYFHY,Extremely clear and well-presented Plus calls and moves.,1409788800,,56,6.125
8349615,5,B0022BYFHY,Love the way I can see how the movements actually go from each person. Would love to be able to get on my iPhone,1401667200,,112,3.7083333333333335
8349616,4,B0022BYFHY,"This DVD is an excellent way to learn the ""Plus"" calls.  My only complaint is that even tho you can go back and have the call started over again it is not easy navigating to it.....it takes some patience.",1388707200,,204,4.230769230769231
8349617,5,B0022BYFHY,"This well organized DVD covers calls 1 through 30 on the Caller Lab Plus list.  The caller, Paul Place, explains the calls clearly and conducts walk throughs with enough repetition to explain the moves without being tiresome. The demonstrations by ""The Travelling Hoedowners"" are also clear and easy to follow with nicely color coded costumes and excellent camera angles.
All in all a very useful aid in learning the plus calls and, as noted in the header, excellent value...",1290643200,2,475,5.012658227848101
