5970800,5,B00F947Q9U,Actors were fantastic/great performances by the supporting cast especially. Great crime drama with a nice message by the end of it. Awesome ride of a film!,1383350400,2,155,5.0
5970801,1,B00F947Q9U,"Ant (Cam'ron) and Carter (Omar Goodling) run into trouble in New York and have to lay low with their cousin in Miami. Ant takes on a straight job helping set up charge processing with businesses. He gets the idea to skim off the transactions.

Ving Rhames appears briefly. The film lacked action and drama. I was bored listening to people sit around and talk. The action scenes, such as the party filled with naked women wasn't shown, just the boring morning after.

The low budget aspect of the film made it a joke.
