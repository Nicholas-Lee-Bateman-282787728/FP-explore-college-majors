7965225,5,B0000694XC,"This is a very confusing film especially for a westerner in trying to decipher its origin.

Through my research, ""5 Venoms vs Wu Tang"" is actually a Taiwanese film that when translated is called ""Strange and Mischievous Young Boy.""

aka ""Little Vampire 2: Kids From Another World."" (I have no idea what series as of yet this alternate title is trying to attach itself to.)

This is NOT ""Magic Story"", a film with a similar plot.  One of the biggest differences to my knowledge is that ""Magic Story"" does not include much martial art fighting.  ""Strange and Mischievous"" does have ample supply.

Nor is this ""Kung Fu Vampire Buster"" as another reviewer claims, which is just another title for ""New Mr. Vampire"".

I also do not believe the claims that this is part of the Hello Dracula series. Some claim that it is Hello Dracula 2: Son of Dracula.  This film does not make sense being part of that series since it does not feature the usual cast of the Hello (aka Yugendoshi) series.

Thoughts anyone?  Any actual Taiwanese film buffs out there with answers?

Does this film have any source on IMDB? If so, I can't find it.

Origin aside this is one of the funniest and most enjoyable cash-ins.

7965226,2,B0000694XC,"I bought this movie because i have fallen in love with the chinese kung-fu comedy horror flick.  Mr. Vampire was the first i have seen of this genre of movie and still my favorite.  but it has to be the megastar version (because the english dub is freakin' hilarious). i sought out this movie after seeing a preview for it from a wu-tang flick i had.  it looked pretty amusing.  so i bought it. let's get one thing straight i didn't buy this because i thought it had anything to do with 5 venoms or wu-tang i bought it for cheesy kung-fu comedy with hopping vampires. this movie had some serious potential to be an awesomely funny flick, but the baby zombie ruins the whole movie.  the baby zombie cries for it's mommy for like 10 minutes straight and when some kids discover it they try and help it but it never tries to kill them. man!!! zombies are supposed to be fierce!!! no matter what age, no matter what culture. lame!!! then the mommy and baby zombie get reunited and live happily ever after...was this movie made for kids? cause that is the vibe i got from it.  a few laughs but nothing worth salvaging.  as for venom warrior. the movie is really just called ""the warrior"".  it seems to have absolutely nothing to do with the poison clan, but for me i found this movie less annoying.  it is about a dancer who wants to move to the u.s. to dance, but these gangsters keep trying to set him up to fight in their tournament.  it is amusing to see this queer dancin' dude completely knockin' people out.",1125187200,,1509,4.357142857142857
7965227,2,B0000694XC,"First: Neither of the movies on this DVD have anything to do with the Five Deadly Venoms series. That said, 5 Venoms vs Wu Tang is actually Ku Fu Vampire Buster (1987), an unsophisticated comedy about a Taoist priest and a magician competing to capture a baby zombie. The movie is geared toward kids and is full of acrobatics, magic, hopping zombies, ghosts, vampires and just plain silliness. It is a lot of fun, moves fast and has a couple of good laughs. This is a direct transfer from tape, so the quality is just adequate. However, it is in widecreen and is subtitled. Skip the second feature.",1054512000,6,598,4.546296296296297
7965228,2,B0000694XC,"(1) re ""5 VENOMS VS WU TANG"":
FIRSTLY - This is NOT what it claims to be - There is no reasonable link to previous VENOMS films to be found. This is a so-called ""HORROR COMEDY"" which, from what I can tell, is probably the 1986 film ""MAGIC STORY"" (aka ""YOUNG MASTER VAMPIRE""). I wouldn't swear to this because there are NO CREDITS on the DVD packaging or on the film itself and the ""story"" (such as it is) is hard to follow. But I can assure you of ONE thing: if this is not the film I think it is, at least my claim is a heck of a lot more accurate than that which the packaging would have you believe.
SECONDLY - As far as collectible value is concerned, refer to any resource material you may have access to, look-up ""MAGIC STORY"" and if the description therein appeals to you, then go for it and enjoy - it is a WILD film with LOTS of hopping VAMPIRES and goofball HOCUS POCUS.
For ME, a moderately enjoyable time filler. For YOU, maybe a lost treasure...?
THIRDLY - The transfer is no worse than the average TAPE-to-DVD genre film copies out there and it is WIDESCREEN and in the original CHINESE language with ENGLISH subtitles.
(2) re ""VENOM WARRIOR"":
This is actually the 1983 CHANG CHEH film ""WARRIOR"" (aka ""DANCING WARRIOR""). It is an ENGLISH-dubbed FULL SCREEN transfer of a VHS print. The film appears to be about a singer/dancer (the BROADWAY type, not the PEKING OPERA type) and is set in CONTEMPORARY Hong Kong. Again, no reasonable (or even discernible) link to previous VENOMS films. I have yet to make it past the first 15 minutes of this one so it would be unjust of me to attempt any sort of review of the film itself.

FYI: NO EXTRAS on the DVD itself - just the two films. I hope someone out there finds this informative & helpful...",1043193600,13,1754,4.331306990881459
7965229,4,B0000694XC,since it looks like nobody else is gonna do a review ill give a shot. I gotta start by saying ive only since wu tang vs 5 venoms so ill comment on that. It looks like it was recorded directly off a tape but it still looks pretty good for this kind of movie.and it has subtitles.its got cool fights cheesy effects and hopping vampires. I don't know what it has to do with the 5 venoms though. I laughed the whole time so I would recomend it if you can get past the bad transfer and subtitles.,1034467200,3,491,4.020408163265306
