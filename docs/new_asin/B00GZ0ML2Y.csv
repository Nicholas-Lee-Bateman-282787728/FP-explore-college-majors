6124374,5,B00GZ0ML2Y,This movie looks really good and I am sure that it will be just as good if not better than the previously released JL:War,1391558400,8,121,4.083333333333333
6124375,4,B00GZ0ML2Y,"Ahh, Son of Batman.
A film I have seen almost nothing but constant complaints for.
So you can imagine my hopes were as high as Old Gotham compared to New Gotham when I pressed play. However, I was happy to find it was a quite enjoyable film, not perfect, but very fun to watch. Much better than the bowels of the DC Universe Animated Original Movies, such as ""Justice League: War"" (Jerky League: Why?) and ""Green Lantern: First Flight"" (dosen't get much worse than this).

The animation was good, very similar to past ones. The action scenes were awesome, something DC has always been great at. The script I thought was fun. The story is drop dead amazing, but it's good enough, and the humor when it was at play certainly had me laughing (it's like ""The Dark Knight Returns: Part 1,"" a great and grim Batman movie...with good humor? 0_0). The voice acting I feel has normally been the most controversial aspect of the film. I'm tired of the Damian complaints, he sounds like his age! And David McCallum and Sean Maher do great jobs as portraying Alfred and Nightwing. Deathstroke, however, is not supposed to sound like con artist Darkseid, and Jason O'Mara is still a poor substitute for Kevin Conroy (then again, who's a good one?).

If you completely ignored that last bit, here's a quick detailing of it all:
 - Animation: 4/5
 - Action: 4/5
 - Script/Story: 4/5
 - Voice Acting: 3/5

And the only special feature i've watched so far was the ""Batman: Assault on Arkham"" preview, which looks awesome. Same animation, whatever, but Arkhamverse prescence, good-looking story, and Kevin Conroy as Batman = WA-HOO!

So, overall, 4/5. It's no ""Flashpoint Paradox,"" ""New Frontier,"" or ""Dark Knight Returns,"" but it's definitely worth a purchase, for Batman fans especially. Or ""Batman and Son"" fans, not-in-original-Deathstroke aside.",1391385600,,1832,4.887096774193548
6124376,5,B00GZ0ML2Y,"I saw the trailer many times and I think that this will be a great movie. Now that they are making new movies based on the new 52 comics I have a feeling that they are gonna make a dc new 52 universe,so if we keep supporting these new dc new 52 movies we could get a new 52 universe.",1391126400,7,283,3.7333333333333334
6124377,1,B00GZ0ML2Y,"During the harsh winter months up in North Dakota, the amount of after school activities was always limited.  The Boys Club I would frequent burned down from a fire in the kitchen started by a couple sleeping Polish men (on ""working"" visa) at the grill. Most of the time, when I got off the school bus to go home, the door would be locked. My aunt thought she had a break in one time and became obsessed with making sure all the doors were locked.  The ""break in"" turned out to be a stray cat in heat knocking over some of her Precious Moments figurines while trying to mate with them. My uncle had confided with me that disgraceful event saying that he just sat there and watched the entire show with his mirrored sunglasses on while slowly drinking his six pack of beer. He hated those figurines more than cats which made the show all the more enjoyable.
As for getting into the house, frequently I would simply have to wait until she woke up from her daily drinking game with game shows. It was a race against daylight due to the short hours of sunlight in the winter.  If I lost that race, I would end up sleeping on the backseat of the Buick with a camping blanket for the night.  My uncle would work late nights with his security job at the alternative lifestyle male truckers dance club. He would go drinking afterwards if he hadn't had enough while at work.
My afterschool activities took a turn for the better when the local chapter of NAMBLA got together and rebuilt the Boys Club. It was a sizable upgrade from the facility that resided there previously. Indoor swimming pool, water slides, recreational courts, weight room, media/game room, showers, juice bar and even sleeping quarters for the weary fitness fanatic.
It was there that I met Dave who was a wealthy and elusive man who befriended me during those cold winter months.  We seemed to just connect from the time we first met while I was watching some movie action movie on VHS. From there on, we spent a great deal of time together. We had some exciting black luxury van rides around town as we pretended to look for bad guys. In my own way, I felt like we were Batman and Robin. No matter where I went, Dave was there.
In purchasing this movie, I had hoped that I would be caught up in the similar nostalgic feelings experienced in those winter months years ago. Instead, I am feeling sadness missing those simpler times. I think it stems from the fact that Dave sought me out unlike Batman with a ""oh here's your kid, your behind in child support."" That sort of relationship feels so shallow, as if copying and pasting something compensates for any real substance thought.
I felt needed by Dave.",1391040000,19,2670,4.48559670781893

She had a son who was raised by her and her father to kill people who oppose them. Batman, of course, is opposed to killing, even enemies. A man who the grandfather had thought to succeed him, kills him because he wants to take over. The boy's mother and the boy escape the assault that killed the old man, and the nearly bare chested mother leads her son to his father Batman to protect him.

He wasn't nearly as bad ass as I have come to expect from an appearance of Deathstroke and everything about his backstory was obviously only to make him fit in this movie as the main villain...but you don't have to make him the main villain he's one of the scariest mercenaries in the DCU. The guy took down a Justice League team with Falsh, Green Arrow, and Green Lantern in it while barely even trying. Put someone else as the main bad guy and have him hire Deathstroke! If you must have him as the main bad guy though all you got to do is set up some sort of grudge for him to settle like maybe the League didn't pay him and tried to kill him instead or something. Instead they took a super bad ass DCU mercenary and gave him some boring cookie cutter background that made him look like some push over.

6124449,4,B00GZ0ML2Y,"SON OF BATMAN

I am a big fan of the DC animated movies and of course the comics that they are inspired by. This film was based on the Batman and Son storyline although some things were changed of course, one was a major one for me but more on that later. This was a good adaptation that made me excited for the next films to come continuing Damians stories.

Bruce Wayne is continuing his career as Batman when an old flame from his past named Talia returns with a little surprise for him. That little surprise is a little him, his son Damian, now ten years old and the son he never knew he had. Talia has brought him to Gotham to help protect him from the people who killed her father and Damians grandfather Ras al Ghul. She fears for her sons life and knows he will not only be safe with his father but can continue his training working alongside him. Of course a child who has been taught since birth to be an assassin may not go along with the ideals of Batman.

This was a good film that has been changed some from the comic including the omission of Harley Quinn, which was a big one for me at first. Still it was good overall with the acting and look being done very well. The story is done well and sets up things to come in at least two more films as of now. The special features include great looks at the League of Assassins, Damian Wayne and the designing of the characters. Also we get a look at Batman: Assault of Arkham which was the next animated film at the time.

Of course we also get four great bonus cartoons from various Batman series. From Batman Beyond we get an excellent episode involving the return of Ras al Ghul. Then a great Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode involving the return of The Joker. Those are followed by two excellent episodes with one from the greatest comic animated series ever Batman: The Animated Series. The first of which is one of my all time favorite episodes about Jonah Hex back in the old west days going up against one Ras al Ghul. The final bonus cartoon is another Brave and Bold episode is all about the sidekicks getting the chance to prove themselves. This Blu Ray is recommended to all fans out there but admittedly it is not the best from the lot, still I did enjoy it.",1461888000,,2238,4.258823529411765
6124450,5,B00GZ0ML2Y,"Very fresh animation. I have never liked DC animated movies because the style was too unrealistic and jarring. This animation was much cleaner and nice to look at.

6124454,1,B00GZ0ML2Y,"Horrible movie. Poor writing. This movie would have you believe that a 10 year old boy can defeat Deathstroke all by himself. In the comics, it was already established that Deathstroke and Batman were equals, and that neither one could best the other with out cheating. So how does the man who is as baddass as batman get beaten by a ten year old little boy who weights less than the armor he wears. and since deathstroke defeated ras al ghul earlier in the film, that means 10 year old Damien is already better then deathstroke and ras al ghul. As a result i stopped reading a lot of dc comics since i can no longer take seriously many of my favorite characters, because now according to DC, little Damien can beat most of them up all by himself. including batman as seen in the next stupid movie they made, batman vs robin. so now i cant even take batman seriously because he cant even stop a little boy from beating him up.",1459987200,2,926,4.358381502890174

6124456,5,B00GZ0ML2Y,"Dc cartoons have a high standard, and this one clears that high hurdle. Literally the only downside is not enough of the other ""sons of the bat"" (Dick Grayson is a minor, if delightful, presence and I guess Jason and Tim don't exist).

6124459,3,B00GZ0ML2Y,"It could have been better, but I thought it was decent, though it doesn't make much of a fan base for Damian still. He's a fan un-favorite still, but all around a decent watch. I was kind of intrigued by it, but it could have had a little more depth. Though, on another basis, it's not exactly child appropriate as for the non-innuendo sexual talk, I can't say I'd let my fourteen year old watch parts of it despite the PG-13 rating by critics. Just because it's animated doesn't mean it's appropriate for children and it forgets to mention excess gore and violence. Come on critics, do your job.

STILL NOT CHILD APPROPRIATE. I would assume that the rising idea of labelling DC movies PG_13 just because they can is okay because it's animated, but it's not.

Otherwise, I'm fine with watching it myself, but don't bring this home to your kids. Eeesh.",1458086400,,851,4.555555555555555

6124461,5,B00GZ0ML2Y,"DC maintains their reputation for putting out high quality animated movies.  This outing tells the backstory of Damian Wayne and how he first comes into his father's life.  Damian is unlike any previous Robin.  He's not nearly as likable, and it's meant to be that way.  His story does create a nice pivot point to add new dimension to Batman.  This volume is a little more violent than most DCU movies, but it's necessary to explain who and why Damian is the way he is.  Great animation and voice work with a strong story and good cameo appearances make this a top notch addition to the DC universe.",1457827200,,600,4.5092592592592595
6124462,3,B00GZ0ML2Y,"I didn't think the story was to bad.  I actually found it pretty interesting.  I thought Batman illegitimate son had a different name though.  It is hard to buy a lot of the action in this movie.  Doubtful the kid could inflict any kind of damage to a full grow adult thug.  I was more interested in Bruce's relationship with Talia than anything Damien did in the movie.  I always found the younger kid Robin characters unbelievable and kind of annoying.  I could buy a late teenager helping Batman and assisting him fighting crime but not a kid.  To me Batman would be concentrating on baby sitting rather than taking out criminals.  It takes thousands of hours to be great at something and I found it very unbelievable that this little brat could be good at everything at the age of 8 or 10 years old.  But hey it is a comic book movie.

Perhaps they should have started off the story focusing on Bruce and Talia hooking up then fast forward several years later to the present.  Kids will probably like the movie because they seem to be able to expand their suspension of disbelief a lot more.  But as an adult you spot a lot of flaws with the action and pull out the BS card quiet a few times.  Raz being surrounded by gunmen in a circle firing machine guns and not getting hit deflecting everything with a sword makes the ridiculous meter go way up.  But through it all I did not thing the overall story was that bad.  I wish it had more substance and story development than just mindless action scenes. More scenes of Alfred and Dick/Nightwing would have been nice.

Through it all the kid does not seem to find humility at all at the end of the film.  I find it very hard that he would spare Deathstroke in any fashion.  He was together with Bruce for such a short time I doubt he would have built up any respect for him.  Even at the end wouldn't the kid want his parents to stay together, makes sense to me.  We don't see Damien find any humanity or Bruce showing him that killing is wrong and that he would be haunted by the lives he took.  Stuff like that.

Anyway it is an interesting popcorn flick.  No way is it near as good as Batman Under the Red Hood.  I thought that one was great and would recommend viewers see that film instead.  I would rate this 2 1/2 to 3 stars.",1457308800,,2285,4.268065268065268

I'm a longtime comic book fan and a Batman fanatic, but somethings are so unrealistic that you have to dumb yourself down to an idiot to think this could actually happen ... or should happen. This film's story line is surrounded by one of the worst DC character EVER Damian Wayne. You have to relax your brain power to .001%, to believe this brat could do 1/8 of the crap they have him doing in this story. The whole movie is painful to endure, but the ending is flat out insulting. Who Damian Wayne ends up living with at story's conclusion and why, is just as unrealistic as an adolescent taking out numerous ninjas without a scratch on him.

6124472,3,B00GZ0ML2Y,"After reading other reviews here, I have to agree with those who gave it a 3-star rating. It does seem that DC comics are putting out animated features much quicker now and that the films are suffering from it. One part of this trend is the practice of placing great cover art on the DVD/Bluray package which makes it look very appealing... then you watch the films and the animation looks NOTHING like the cover and is far below that expectation. The animation in this film is uneven; The Damian character looks like TV Japanimation (very cheap) while Batman and Nightwing look very good, and none of the characters look like their depictions on the cover.

The story is interesting but not fully flushed out, as that would require more time. It's too rushed, it tries to move on quickly to each successive action scene. Because of this, the character's are too one-dimensional and can't develop: Batman's less dark and moody and doesn't quite work as a father figure here, Damian is too skilled and acts like a spoiled brat, etc. The action scenes are good but too far fetched, another modern trend.

There are a number of special features here which are good. Overall, it's worth seeing this film for anyone who watches these DC animated features. However, you may want to rent it first, then you can decide whether you want to buy a copy.

First off, Slade Wilson was written completely out of character.  This Deathstroke is just a thug.  No code, no pride in trying to be the best, nothing that makes Deathstroke such a cool villain.  They should've just made some new character instead of ruining Deathstroke.  Second, the absurdity of the story.  Gun toting ninjas vs sword toting ninjas using arrow firing Gatling guns, etc.  I could go on, but you get the picture.  If you love Batman, than by all means, watch this movie.

I'm a die hard comic book reader but I always find it a must to see how they've adapted a particular story line & characters to a live action movie, animated show, or full length feature. In this case I'd have to opt for the original comics it's based off of. Morrison's & Kubert's ""Batman & Son"" story-line is way better than this. This animated movie seems like it had a rushed production too. Where in the past, these movies seemed like great care & detail was put into them before release yet Son of Batman reeks of a rushed product that was slapped together quickly to hit store shelves just as fast. Its also quite of predictable in some scenes which I felt was a let down considering DC Animation's previous efforts like Justice League New Frontier, Batman Gotham Knight, Justice League Crisis on Two Earths, & Superman Unbound have been stellar.

The storyline was good, kept up with the Batman/Robin fallout, and we got to see Nightwing and Bruce work together (with his son Damian) to find a solution to the problem at hand.

Talia is borderline good, Nightwing is UP (underpowered) Damian is OP (overpowered), and Batman is very VERY OOC (out of character), Deathstroke is UP and OOC. Tim Drake wasn't even in it! And seriously, would it have been so painful to slip Jason's suit into a case in memory of the fallen Robin? They didn't even have to bring in Red Hood (though it would have been good)
Throughout the movie I kept thinking, 'they could have made this so good. They could have made it the best DCU movie EVER! But...they screwed up. BIG TIME
I watched it the first time and hated it, then I thought 'maybe if I watch it again it'll be better'
News flash! I was wrong. It was even worse.

Reminded me of Jason Todd, who was irritating. Once I got to thinking of how Damian might have been looking at the world, I grew less tired of him.
The movie overall was good, but, Damian was made out to be more of a stud and stronger than he should've; especially compared to Nightwing, and stronger than he should've been when fighting the big thugs.
I would recommend it, though. I now am interested in the future development of Damian, since in the end, he seemed to understand the lessons Batman was trying to teach him.",1441584000,4,675,4.322834645669292

And really, who doesn't love the idea of ninja bats? Not sure they were used to their best effect (i.e. fewer bats who were more of a challenge might have made for a better story) but that's a quibble at best.

The real confusion in the movie is the target audience. It wasn't a sophisticated enough story to warrant only being suitable for adults but was too bloody and harsh (Batman ripping off Crock's tail, for instance) to be suitable for a wider audience.

First of all, Batman's bobble-headed son is the worst!  He is a puny child who can beat up giants.  He can hack into NORAD at 6 years old.  You know, Sheldon Cooper is a comedic character from Big Bang Theory.  Not Batman's son, DC.  Worst of all, this stupid kid character never shuts his face, and makes the entire cast look foolish.  He is basically a baby ninja who can beat up Nightwing.  What!?!  He faces Deathstroke!  What!?!

The you have some TERRIBLE voice acting here.  Talia is voiced by a microwave come to life.  Deathstroke sounds like an old Speak and Spell with a manly voice.  Nobody sounds into their characters.  Except--OF COURSE--the little jerk Son of Batman.

And that's another thing!  Really!?!  Batman was raped by Talia?  Really!?!  Batman can fight Killer Croc, but not roofies?

Oh, MAN, what a horrible animated film.  DC produces some of the BEST, but this one is utter drivel.  It brings Batman into the realm of Pokemon.  Childish and irrational and plainly stupid.

Death stroke had pretty much no motivation to be the ""villain"" of this movie. He also went down with one punch from Batman. The ending was also pretty awful. Batman would not leave someone to die. Also, Damian's last minute change of heart was way too convenient and unexplained. There is no way he would just throw away his years of training under his grandfather in only a few weeks with Batman.  Overall, I had high hopes for this movie and, quite frankly, am disappointed.

Sure, the voice acting is mediocre (Batman is so low-key he sounds narcoleptic, while Deathstroke sounds like a video game villain) and the art has a generic anime look, but at the end of the day Damian is the problem here. He's a  ten year old and we're supposed to believe he is nearly on par with Batman himself? No. Just, no.

Damian hacked into NORAD when he was six? No, Damian you didn't, because you were six, and that would be stupid. Damian can fight Dick Grayson nearly to a standstill and even give Batman a good fight? No: again, that's stupid. He climbed a mountain when he was four even though he had a broken wrist? Nope, don't believe it for a second. Took out Deathstroke on his own? Nope. All of this is absurd.

After voicing Batman in various video games, and almost all the cartoons and the cartoon movies he is so missed here as the man who voiced this Batman was just lousy.

What they have done here is in order to introduce the newest Robin aka Damien Wayne son of Batman they give his origin and they try to tell you that he was the one who was responsible for the loss of sight in the one eye of Slade Wilson aka Deathstroke.  God this was bad, as they re imagined his origin and such...I could take the time to type what his origin is but if your a comic fan you already know.
The Ra 's al ghul character was totally waisted here and looked so bad, the Talia character was the pits.

6124583,4,B00GZ0ML2Y,"As part of the New 52 line-up of the DC Universe animated movies, Son Of Batman is based on the story arc, Batman And Son, but also part of this ongoing continuity. Although it brings to the table since the Justice League just formed, this story has Batman being around long enough to have a kid.

Ra's al Ghul is watching over his ninjas training in their mountain stronghold, when the League of Assassins(not ""Shadows"")gets raided by some heavily-armed attackers lead by Deathstroke. This version of Slade doesn't have superpowers, and here was trained to be Ra's al Ghul's successor, but was cast out. Unknown to him was that Ra's daughter Talia had a son named Damien after a past encounter of with Batman. Talia manages to escape with Damian leaving Ra's to die(for the last time?), and she takes him to meet his father. Batman at first has trouble accepting Damian's superior attitude, despite the fact that the little creep spent his whole youth being groomed to the ultimate warrior. Damian wants to find and kill Deathstroke, but Batman won't allow him to commit murder. Deathstroke meanwhile has captured the family of former Man-Bat, Kirk Langstrom, in order to create an army of ninja Man-Bats, as well as keeping Talia prisoner. Nightwing joins the ranks after nearly getting his butt handed to him by Damian, who now has taken up the mantle of Robin, although its hinted that he's only the second one to take on the title. After rescuing Langstrom's family, the Damian seperates from Batman to Deathstroke's hidden headquarters, an offshore oil rig with an underwater lair near a Lazarus Pit where he's keeping all his new Man-Bat ninjas. Batman rescues Talia, but not before she is shot by Deathstroke, so he revives her with the Lazarus Pit while Robin fights Deathstroke to the death, although Slade is dowsed with chemicals before apparently drowning so he might return with enhanced strength in future DC Universe installments. Damian decides to stay with Batman and be the new Robin with Talia leaving him so she can rebuild the League of Assassins.

This feature had some ecstatic fight scenes in it highlighting what a skilled ninja Damian was raised to be, plus some quality animation, although you see how much better Under The Red Hood was in comparison. The main problem with this though is the inclusion of Deathstroke as the main antagonist, where he wasn't even in the original comic and has no connection with the League of Assassins, when he could have easily have been replaced with a character like Bane or Sensei who actually had ties to Ra's al Ghul, like Deathstroke is just some character from the DC Comics roster to fill a spot when you need some ass-kicking ruthless merc. Aside from that, Son Of Batman definately has a place in the Batman animated movie pantheon, and is one worth keeping.",1425081600,,2831,4.823045267489712
6124584,3,B00GZ0ML2Y,"Mediocre is the best way to sum this film up. If Batman: Under the Red Hood was a good example of taking a convoluted comic story and turning into a streamlined, better and improved version in animated form this film represents the complete opposite. While I do follow the Batman comics I have no problem when changes are made to translate a story to live action or animation and to be honest I really wasn't a fan of Grant Morrison's run on Batman but respect and appreciate what he brought to the characters history and went into this with an open mind....now, like I said, I understand changes have to be made to translate the story from comic to film but some of the changes made here are baffling!

If you're a Deathstroke fan you will probably dislike this movie. Without giving away spoilers they really do not do him justice and instead of using a different villain or even creating one for the sake of the story they throw Deathstroke under the bus and he is not done justice at all.
There are points where the movie is actually enjoyable and right when you think it's about to catch it's stride it trips over its own two feet. Near the end of the film I genuinely wondered if the people who made this even studied the source material or if they just read a recap on Wikipedia and decided to whip this together in a quick brainstorming session!
After watching it I was stunned and baffled. Watching the credits literally confused at what I had just watched. Missed opportunity, wasted potential and dropped ball are words that go hand in hand with this film. Its not necessarily BAD...but it gets pretty damn close!

All in all, if you're a Batman fan or fan of superheroes or animated action in general you'll find this somewhat appealing. If you're a die hard fan of the actual source material such as ""Batman and Son"" or any of Grant Morrison's run I'd probably advise you to avoid this because it will be very disappointing.

Also in case you were wondering there is no after the credits scene such as Justice League: WAR.",1424822400,,2035,4.509485094850948

6124620,1,B00GZ0ML2Y,"Uninspiring animation, bad voice characterization, and a plot line that will put you to sleep - this film had everything!  I honestly can't say I've seen a worse animated Batman movie.

Uninspiring animation - lots of group shots where identical-looking characters can be used.  Lots of identical ninjas - check.  Lots of identical Man-Bats - check.  You get the feeling that the group shots are used so the animators can leverage cut & paste and avoid any real work.  I get much more of an anime-type of look & feel than typical superhero-type animation.  Check out Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths for an example of well-done animation.

Bad voice characterization - throughout the entire movie, Batman speaks in a monotone voice that fairly typical of the character.  The problem is that Batman sounds as if he's bored to death, instead of intense, or driven.  The voice actor in this movie totally misses the mark.  A good example of accurate voice characterization for Batman is Justice League: Doom.

A plot line that will put you to sleep - zzzzzzzzz...sorry, I nodded off just thinking about it.  I've never read the print version of this story, but I'd imagine that it has to be better than this animated version.  The characters didn't act in their typical fashion (Deathstroke running away from a fight), the plot line itself was boring & unimaginative, and the entire movie was bereft of any of the usual plot devices that might have made the story more interesting (e.g., subplot, plot twist, 'red herring', or 'deus ex machina').  A prime example of a great story line with plot twists is Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox.

But maybe the problem is that after over 30 years reading comics & digesting related material (animated & non-animated movies), I've just developed too critical of an 'eye'.

6124630,4,B00GZ0ML2Y,"Considering the previous few Justice League movies in this series really left a bad taste in my mouth (Flashpoint Paradox and JL War), and I'm NOT much of a Grant Morrison fan, I went into this movie expecting not to like it much. I was pleasantly surprised. Son of Batman is pretty fun and different from other Batman movies we've gotten in a good way!

THE GOOD: Great animation, voice acting, action, sound characterization, and an intriguing premise, especially for those not familiar with the source material. Fun villains.

THE BAD: Sections of the movie are a little slow pacing-wise, but it's not so bad. Some viewers may be put off by the premise of the story where Batman has an illegitimate child who's a huge brat, but that sort of is what it is from the source material, so it's hard to hold that against it.

THE UGLY: Occasionally you can sense Grant Morrison's wooden dialogue seeping into the film's, but overall I found it to be a more engaging and lively adaptation than ""All Star Superman"" which was also adapted from a Morrison story.",1419292800,,1055,4.661290322580645

6124634,5,B00GZ0ML2Y,"I do like the way DC animated movies can expand on Batman and build stories around him other than just fighting the Joker all the time. Its interesting to see how the possibilities of other characterization can become apart of a wider story arc. This sets a great background about a little boy who is Batmans son, who was trained in the fine arts of becoming an assassin in the league of shadows under Ras Agul.....who happens to be his grandfather. The action and story are gritty and intense and yes it has graphic violence but this is geared towards an older audience. 18 years to adults recommended.",1418515200,,603,4.592592592592593

The first one i saw was Justice League: War, which at least had some funny dialogue, if pretty dismal characters and story writing, And then theres this. Son of Batman features an alternate universe wherein the lazarus pits cannot bring a recently dead body back from the brink (Jason Todd says hi), so when former league of assassin members come to take over from raas al ghul, hilarity ensues.

in all seriousness though, the justice league animated series had better animations... and writing... and action... so if you want a good batman tale go look that up or the batman animated series... this is just bad...",1418169600,,711,4.5984251968503935

Great flow and production value was congruent throughout.

I actually watched this one AFTER having watched Assault on Arkham and notice this came out before it along with Batman TDKR 1&2.  TDKR and Son of Batman were bot masterpieces in bringing batman into a more adult audience.

This might be the last good one though as I watched Assault on Arkham and it was just awful. I recommend skipping over Assault on Arkham as it's garbage and nothing like the last two WB and DC have put out recently.  If you need more batman wait for whatever is after Assault on Arkham to come out because it is garbage compared to the 2 before it.",1412467200,,835,4.490066225165563

How do you cope with a child that you didn't know you had who is now placed in your custody? The character of The Batman and his parenting skills may surprise you. This animation is not short on action in the very least and from start to finish you will be glued to the screen. I don't do spoiler alerts but I will say that there is a surprise Batman series character from the past that joins in this episode. Alfred is his usual enjoyable self to watch, who brings humor to the storyline. The Batman has a son. Who is the mother and how did this happen?

It's a new adventure that doesn't follow it's comic book roots exactly but it touches upon key parts that made it special. The main villain is not Talia Al Ghul but Deathstroke, a very athletic old man that kills a squadron of soldiers and his mentor but cannot kill a little kid. The story is not bad and plays like a Kill Bill or Punisher movie, Damien wants revenge and does whatever it takes to get it. Batman and Nightwing try to teach Damien that to be hero you can't kill your enemies. Damien is probably the best robin ever put to screen, he's not like anything you've seen before. Now even though this movie is great, it has it's bad moments. Deathstroke's voice is annoying and Talia is no more than a damsel in distress. Some parts of the movie don't really make any sense.

For the few short moments that Nightwing appeared, not only was he about the best looking Nightwing I've seen so far from DC, but he also acted 100% like Nightwing would act.... and he sounded 100% like I would picture Nightwing sounding.

I think the industry realizes that a great segment of the target audience for these films are fully grown, mature  fans of the genre who can handle a bit more sophistication and realistic content. While the blood and gore shown in this film might be questionable for very young viewers, the adult in me was absolutely thrilled with how great the movie plays out. The new Batman has a more relate-able history, where he has consummated his relationship with Talia, resulting in the new Robin. Very believable, very acceptable and very well done. Now do this for Batman / Catwoman and the many other flings the Dark Knight is famous for and you will keep me coming back for more!

6124793,3,B00GZ0ML2Y,"I am firmly in the camp that the whole premise of Batman having a son was a bad idea.  That said, Son of Batman is a moderately entertaining film and certainly better than the last original DC animated film, Justice League: War.  The film is an adaption of 2006 Grant Morrison storyline Batman and Son although the film makes wholesale changes to the plot and characters.

In the League of Assassins mountain stronghold we meet young Damian, the son of Talia al Ghul and grandson of Ras al Ghul.  Although still just a boy Damian has grown up in the league and is already an extremely skilled fighter as well as having a genius intellect.  The fortress is attacked by Deathstoke and a force of armed soldier.  Deathstroke had been Ras al Ghuls second-in-command but was tossed out.  He has returned looking for revenge.  The League manages to fight off the invaders but Ras al Ghul is gravely injured and not even the restorative Lazarus Pit can save him.  He dies leaving Damian shattered but vowing revenge.

Talia tells Damian its time he finally meets his father and takes him to Gotham to meet Batman.  Batman is skeptical at first but runs his own tests to confirm that Damian is indeed his son.  Damian is shown the Batcave and given full run of Wayne Manor, much to Alfreds annoyance as Damian proves a petulant, demanding, and egomaniac.  The strength of the film lies in the relationship between Damian and those around him, notably Batman and Nightwing.  Nightwing replaces the Tim Drake Robin role from the comics which causes the film to lose that rivalry aspect between the two.  There are some humorous bits where Damian keeps asking to drive the Batmobile and the like but ultimately the relationship between father and son is barely explored.

They learn that Deathstroke has kidnapped the family of Dr. Kirk Langstrom, the guy who created the Man-Bat formula.  Deathstroke forces Langstrom to help him create an army of super-ninja man-bats (I kid you not it was also in the comics) that he will use to take over the League of Assassins.  Along the way Batman and Nightwing have to teach Damian some basic life lessons such as you simply cant go around killing everyoneyou know, the basic stuff.

Son of Batman is one of the most adult-themed animated films yet, featuring strong language and a heavy dose of violence.  You wish however that the relationship between Batman and Damian would have received the same treatment instead of handled with so much dry humor.  Deathstroke was not part of the original storyline.  In the comics it was actually Talia who kidnapped Langstroms family and is the main antagonist.  I supposed with Deathstroke playing such a prominent role in the Arrow TV series that they wanted to keep him front and center.

Deathstroke as the villain is fineThomas Gibson (Criminal Minds) as the voice of Deathstroke, not so much.  Gibson may very well provide the worst voice performance in any DC animated film.  His Deathstroke sounds like a stressed accountant.  Compared to Manu Bennetts gravelly voice oozing with bad intentions, Gibsons take is positively feeble.  Jason O Mara returns for his second turn as Batman/Bruce Wayne and while he is no Kevin Conroy, hes more than serviceable.  Screen veteran David McCallum (The Man from U.N.C.L.E.) provides the voice of Alfred for the second time and is a standout.

Son of Batman makes a lot of changes from the original story arc, some good some bad.  Its biggest missed opportunity was in failing to deal more with the relationship between father and son.  As a pure comic action film however, it still manages to hit enough high notes to make it worth checking out.",1405382400,,3664,4.794258373205742

6124798,3,B00GZ0ML2Y,"Son of Batman's somewhere between ""just ok"" and ""good...ish."" This title falls middle of the pack for a DC animated flick, as far as my tastes go, but toward the bottom of the current Batman entries, which disappoints me. Damian is a really interesting counterpart for Batman and I think the young man voicing him did an exceptional job. That was one of the high points. He might've played the laugh a little much at times, but that's not unrealistic for a kid. In fact most of the voice work was good. Though Morena Baccarin's Talia hit her stride, she also seemed really uninvested, most notably around one of the earlier climactic scenes involving her father. As is frequently the case with the DC animated movies, the visual aspects appear to have taken precedence over all other aspects of bringing the comic to life as a movie. That's fine to an extent, but I'd rather more substance than eye candy.

To me, the biggest drawback was the comically bad casting of Deathstroke. Thomas Gibson (Greg of Darma and Greg infamy). As Deathstroke. Greg, y'all. GREG as DEATHSTROKE. What was that voice he was doing? It was like a kid pretending to be his dad on the phone. Really, really, really hurt the movie. Still, I'd watch it again, I just won't make my wife watch it because I'm pretty sure you have to really like the characters going in, if you're to forgive its weaknesses as a movie.",1405296000,,1390,4.604838709677419

I don't think he should be a character in the DC universe just due to the fact that I don't think Batman should have a son. Anyway, the movie is decent enough with a satisfying display of fight scenes and character design; however the movie kinda falls flat with character chemistry. A lot of the voice overs for each character really felt like they were not meant to go together. In some ways it felt as though they picked up some random person off the street and gave them a character of their choosing to voice. Ras Al Ghoul and Death stroke were the worst in my opinion; I couldn't stand there voices at times. Now I'm not 100% sure but I don't think Death Stroke has or has had anything to do with the league of Assassins. So his connection with them here felt really off. He felt a bit off script, as though he wasn't a super solder contracted killer. For a batman film its a little so so; you don't gain anything from watching it and you don't lose anything if you pass on it. The choice is up to you.",1402444800,,1095,4.145539906103286

6124863,2,B00GZ0ML2Y,"I had a free Redbox rental so I viewed this for free. Not worth paying for. Animation is similar to the cheapo Japanimation of the 1980s, but without the silly charm. (Where's Bruce Timm and Paul Dini when you need them??)  Poor voice actors, but to be fair, no one will replace Kevin Conroy. (They have Xander Berkeley in the voice cast, so why wasn't he Batman??)  I'm not sure why Talia lacks a European accent.  Judging from her voice actress, the director grabbed the first young chick he found in a Seattle Starbucks.

I get the feeling this was made for the Japanese market, then dubbed with English for release in America. You notice this because sometimes the voice actors speak more quickly, or more slowly, to fill up frame time that was designed for the peculiarities of a Japanese script.  But I could be wrong.....

Honestly, I'm growing weary of this focus on the League of Assassins in the Batman stories.  It started with Batman Begins and it hasn't ended. The end result is that Batman is now just a glorified ninja, which was never, never true at all.  Bruce Wayne trained with many experts, not just the LOA.  And man-bats? Why did they bring back the nonsensical man-bats here?? I thought we left them all behind in the sloppy 70s.

Warner Bros. animation has made some terrific full-length Batman cartoons. (Superman/Batman Public Enemies and the superb Batman: Under the Red Hood).  Even Superman/Batman Apocalypse was pretty good, because it had Kevin Conroy and Tim Daly. But then DC dumped all its veteran voice actors and outsourced the animation to farm-team hacks. It all went downhill starting with Batman: Year One, then The Dark Knight Returns garbage.  I think that's when they starting Japanimating everything, which truly lowers the quality.

From what I understand, Kevin Conroy is returning in Assault on Arkham in 2014.  About time........Note to DC: get back all the people who worked on the superb Justice League animated series.",1402185600,,1969,4.8562874251497

Is there any kind of plot?  Barely.

Does anything in this stinker make any kind of sense?  A resounding no.  Fifteen guys with automatic weapons against one swordsman + no cover of any kind = one terminally perforated swordsman.  The idiocy just gets worse from there.

Is there a maximum level of machismo and posturing? Yes, even by the so called kid.  The dialoge is straight off the ad on the back of a Brut cologne bottle, and the odor of testosterone in the film permeated my living room for hours just from the twenty minutes of the film I was actually able to watch.

6124871,4,B00GZ0ML2Y,"To celebrate the 75th anniversary of The Dark Knight we see one of the more recent Batman stories leap off the pages to become the 19th DCU Animated film 'Son of Batman'.

It is hard to believe but yes, Batman is a father. Not just for any kind of boy, but this one is also the son of Talia Al-Ghul. Trained in the arts of the League of Shadows we get a 'Lion King' like story, in which an rouge member of the organization wants to take it over for himself. Talia leaves Damian with his birth father Bruce Wayne and there he learns that are ways to serve justice with out killing people. Eventually Damian would end up becoming the 4th Boy Wonder.

This film is far from perfect, but it has a lot of high notes. The voice cast as always works well, this time featuring Jason O'Mara and Stewart Alan playing Batman & Robin as well as two former Firefly cast-mates Morena Baccarin and Sean Maher. The movie has tons of action some great lines and a ton of surprise appearances that would be appreciated by any Batman fan. Where the films lacks is through a lot of gaps in the story. We know that in between scenes certain things happen, but we have to use our imaginations in order to see them. I would have loved to see Damian fight Nightwing, but I guess we don't always get what we want.

'Son of Batman', may not hold a candle to previous DCU Batman films like 'The Dark Knight Returns' or Under 'The Red Hood'. What it does bring us is an enjoyable new film one that is worthy to be included in the ever growing DCU film library. It also holds true to the darker tone these film project have taken since Sam Register became executive producer of this franchise. With the 20th film on the way I am very excited because of the film's basis and I am eagerly awaiting the 2015 line-up of DCU films.",1401926400,,1797,4.263929618768328
6124872,2,B00GZ0ML2Y,"DC Animated used to be where fans of good animated long-form superhero adventures could go to get smart, well-told, well-acted, and well-animated storytelling. The key words there being ""used to"". Ever since genius creator Bruce Timm left DC Animated, the quality of their original films and adaptations has taken a huge dive downwards in pretty much every category. Releases like THE FLASHPOINT PARADOX and JUSTICE LEAGUE: WAR felt totally devoid of anything that made DC Animation the top of the heap; things like heart, emotion, urgency, drama and quality animation took a backseat to cranking out ready-made lowest-common-denominator ultra-violent snoozefests. And the latest addition, SON OF BATMAN is no exception.

Based EXTREMELY loosely on Grant Morrison's opening arc of his writing duties on the BATMAN comic, the film opens at the training facility of Ra's Al Ghul's League of Assassins, which is under attack by an army of mercenaries led by Deathstroke (voiced by CRIMINAL MINDS' Thomas Gibson). After the onslaught, Talia (FIREFLY and HOMELAND's Morena Baccarin) sends her son Damian to Gotham City to meet his father, Batman (Jason O'Mara) for his safety. Batman had shared a night of passion with his on/off lover Talia (while he was apparently drugged?!?) and that night produced Damian. Damian is an overly-entitled, borderline sociopathic 10-year-old assassin who's been trained by the League since he could walk. Batman has some reluctance to take Damian in, but only when he starts displaying his murderous tendencies does Batman really believe he has to give guidance and instruct his son that killing is not the answer. Nightwing (FIREFLY's Sean Maher) appears on the scene for... reasons. Apparently, Ra's had intended upon using the Man-Bat formula developed by Kirk Langstrom (career character actor Xander Berkeley) to create unstoppable flying ninjas, and now Deathstroke has hijacked those plans. This leads Batman to allow Damian to don the cape and cowl of Robin and become his new crimefighting partner as they hunt down Deathstroke to put an end to his plans.

Aside from the fact that most of the events in this film do not take place in Morrison's arc, this is not a good film at all. One of the best things that I can say about it is that it plays like a below-average Bond film rather than a straight-up comic book film, which is an interesting direction to go in. There are some good zingers tossed around particularly between Alfred and Damian, and the characterization of Damian is pretty well done, but that's about it. The pacing is atrocious, the animation is barely tolerable (particularly when you have CG vehicles against a hand-drawn background, which is something that has been an issue for a while with the DC Animated films, since BATMAN: UNDER THE RED HOOD), the voice acting of O'Mara and Gibson (which is an actor I love) is boring, cool characters like Nightwing are horrifically underused, the writing is terrible, and the film is INCREDIBLY violent. This is a trend that has been evident since THE FLASHPOINT PARADOX, and it's something that needs to stop being this gratuitous. Frankly, I'm a little shocked that some of these films got a PG-13 rating. The bloodletting is particularly brutal in the opening sequence, as well as moments with Talia being abused by Deathstroke and Damian being ""crucified"" by a knife and a sword. These aren't necessarily meant for kids anyway, but instead of it being interesting or dramatic, it was just uncomfortably and relentlessly bloody which just becomes numbing after this much of it.

SON OF BATMAN is another sad, poorly executed misfire in a catalog of new DC Animated releases that is growing with pretty much each subsequent film.",1401840000,,3734,5.078175895765472

The best part of the package is the extra-feature on the ""Batman and Son"" comic storyline. The extra gives a good look at what this movie could have been and provides a nice history of Damian Wayne beyond his introduction. The DC extra-features are still top notch even if the main movies seem to be on the decline.

This is as bad as ""Justice League: War."" Actually it is worse as ""War"" was a bad animated movie based on a bad comic and this is a bad animated movie based on an excellent comic making it more disappointing.

Also probably the worst representation of Deathstroke in any show (and that's saying something... Smallville... Arrow). Instead of a master strategist and hand-to-hand combatant, this Deathstroke poses no greater threat to our heroes than ""random thug #4.""

Deathstroke is just worthless in this.

6124907,4,B00GZ0ML2Y,"I was pleasantly surprised by this original and great story. Son of Batman is a great, action-packed animation many people will enjoy.

This film has a lot of elements to admire - thrilling Batman-class fighting that kept me excited and at the edge of my seat. There is also some romance between Batman and his 'special person' which is short, but nice and I thought it fit well.

The story starts when a training camp is destroyed. A young boy escapes with his mom and flees to Batman who, as it turns out, is the boy's father. For his safety, Batman takes the child and, as Batman, tries to protect and train him. Batman teaches his kid to take criminals alive but, a new mystery arises - one that will have a significant impact on the story line. We join Batman, Robin, and Batman's son as they face off deadly people while Batman makes sure his kid doesn't hurt himself. It's a fun and action adventure that all Batman fans will appreciate!

Overall, I think this movie had some ups and downs. The animation is rather interesting but, I thought it was a bit too much at times. It is gory at times, yet plastic and 2D like most superhero animations. I believe that the animators could have cut down a bit on the violence and mature content. Also, the animation of the faces looks a bit fake to me. The directing is interesting. I thought that the angles were good and fit the storyline quite well. The voice-overs are excellent.  For example, Jason O Marra who is the voice of Batman, doesn't show much emotion and talks in a quiet and dark whisper - perfect for the character. The plot is original and surprising, which I am fond of. For the most part, Son of Batman turns out to be a very unexpected and surprising adventure.
My favorite scene is the first scene iwhen the academy is destroyed. Even though this is a sad moment, it sets the tone for the entire movie. I love scenes that may not seem important but have a big impact on the rest of the film.

This movie has lots of adult lines and a lot of gory scenes, so I recommend for ages 11 to18. I also give it 4 out of 5 stars because of some hiccups with the animation.",1400716800,,2132,4.333333333333333

Damian is a compelling conundrum in Bruce's recent history, as he is in the books, but the plot here is so watered down that every *other* character's personality and motivation become a bit shallow. This is fine for Batman, who we know all too well already (especially considering not every case can be an Arkham epic or melodramatic character analysis -- sometimes. crime-fighting is simple), but there were adequate chances for the story and animation to offer more of... everything. Really, what this film needed was director Jay Oliva, who *will* return for the *next* animated Bat-adventure. This is an entertaining film, but only just. 3 stars.",1400630400,,908,5.226027397260274

and it did have almost every character (except Alfred) acting out of character for most of the time.

It fells more like a TV movie, then a (even direct to dvd) film,

It's a good time to watch with friends, (and laugh at some of the badly done stuff)
but overall I was not really expecting much, and because of that I was only a little disappointed,

JL:war was also 'not great' but better then this,
I may watch it again in a few years, but for $5 for an HD rental, it's not that bad.

(THERE IS NO WAY I COULD SEE A REASON FOR ANYONE TO GIVE IT FIVE STARS, not by a long shot)
but still an interesting watch.",1400630400,,718,4.0
6124914,3,B00GZ0ML2Y,"The visual design looked good. Very similar or the same as that for Justice League: War and Young Justice. It did drift a bit too much into the anime style when it came to some of the combat scenes. That's an awful lot of power coming from the punches and kicks of a 10 year old. Somehow he's able to smack around large grown men who had similar if not the same training he had.

The voice acting was good and most of the character designs were excellent. The  only ones I didn't like were for Ras Al Ghul and the Man-Bat. Man-Bat does not have batty ""angel wings"". His arms become giant bat wings. Plus he should be a scary kind of ""werewolf"" figure. Something they did very well in the old Batman: The Animated Series.  I wasn't crazy about what they did with Killer Croc but it did fit somewhat with the plot of the story and wasn't as crazy as what they've done with him in some of the comics.

The story was okay. It is very violent and a tad bloody, even for a PG-13 rating.

The main problems I had with this video has to do with Batman's son being a 10 year old bad ass who doesn't have super powers but sure looks like it in this movie. There's no other way he could do a lot of what he does.  While the character looked and sounded good Deathstroke should not have been in this film if they were going to punk his character they way they did here. Usually the character gets pumped up too much when it comes to fighting and strategy. It's pretty much completely opposite in this one. Given how most of the League of Assassins is portrayed maybe Deathstroke is a badass in their group, because other than Damien, Ras and Talia they all seem to be idiot henchmen and not super ninja style assassins.

If you have no history with Deathstroke (or Man-Bat) this movie will probably be a lot more enjoyable for you. It's not horrible, but disappointing given what DC animation has done in the recent past.",1400630400,,1909,4.271468144044321

6124918,2,B00GZ0ML2Y,"I will start off with I love Batman, and I read the comics.  Especially this specific storyline.  Now I won't go into the fact that the story does not match up, and has some flaws, but instead I will judge the movie based on, well the movie itself.  I find it a little aggravating when a nerd, nerds out at how the movie is nothing like the book.  If you love the book so much go read the book, but leave the hate behind when watching the movie.  With that being said, lets get to the review.  I have throughout the years looked past a few flaws that have plagued the Batman's movies and cartoons because I enjoy watching the Dark Knight do his thing.  In this movie I was just a little disappointed.  The passing was staggering, and felt overly rushed.  You have a movie that including credits is 1 hour and 14 minutes.  *SPOILERS ahead* In that time you are expected to just understand Batman has a illegitimate child with Talia, that Ras is dead, the child needs a guardian, child wants to kill Slade, Talia gets caught and held for ransom so that the child can come and try and kill Slade, and Batman is just there to mentor Damian to ""Do the right thing"".  All that in a very short time.  Lets not mention the fact that gun wielding ninjas, who are ran by Slade Wilson (Deathstroke for this kiddies) come in and kill off most of the league of assassins. Did I mention that Slade looses his eye from Damian sticking a sword in it, not the other 4 different versions from the comic books?  (Darn it, I am nerd raging.  Got to calm down) Talia and Damian seem to be the only ones that know how to fight.  Taking out most of the baddies with ease as their brethren fall like toy soldier.  However that doesn't stop the fact that Ras goes out like a little a weenie in a obvious fight to the death with Deathstroke.  How about the Gatling Gun of not bullets, but arrows that almost always seem to find there target, even when it is the pilot of a military helicopter?  This is all within the first 8 minutes.  If you can get past that, then you are in for much worse.  Batman for some reason just excepts that Damian is his child, and gives him the full run of the household including that Batcave.  No normal Batman mistrust, no keeping a close eye on him, just downright OK this is how it is.  Pennyworth does a good job showing his disgust, but Mr. Wayne, nothing, just ""Yep that's my boy.""  On multiple occasions when Batman and Damian go out, Damian always seems to run off.  Batman never seems to be able to keep up, which cause a lot of undo problems.

I could go on and nitpick every minute of this movie, and well, I just don't have the time to give it that much attention.  If you can see past the above, and just want to see a Batman cartoon, then watch it.  However if you are wanting a true Batman story, then you will sorely be disappointed.  I commend the art that is why I give it any stars at all, but the storyline is just down right horrible.",1400544000,,2961,4.220640569395018

Every great DC animated movie has followed the comic closely made a few changes here and there but basically left it intact...All-Star Superman is a great example of this...

I feel like this movie took a step backward instead of forward.

Now for a different rant...
Deathstroke:  Deathstroke is a villain capable of taking on almost anyone in the DC universe and WINNING this includes heroes like the Flash and Green Lantern and he has BEATEN BATMAN in a fist fight every single time they have fought!  This fight between Damion and Slade should have been a joke...it should have been Slade laughing and beating him to death...that's the level of skill Deathstroke has.  Deathstroke also doesn't work with others!!  He is a loner, he literally killed his entire team in the comics to make a point...""I WORK ALONE"" Slade Wilson...and now he's trying to take over some ninja band...to grow Man Bats...ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME!

 Even though the overall story is decent, the screenwriting and dialogue is not.  It often comes off like a bad English Dub, where you kinda get what they are going for but it never quite sounds right.

 It falls some where in the middle as far as DC Animated goes.  Up at the top you have 'Under the Red Hood', ""Flashpoint: Paradox"", and ""New Frontier"".  Down at the bottom you have ""Superman: Doomsday', 'All Star Superman', and 'Superman: Unbound'.  Notice a trend?

6124947,5,B00GZ0ML2Y,"The movie was fun, a bit short like many animated Batman features, and lacked complexity of some of the other films.  It definitely was not on par in terms of style, content, complexity or overall artistry with The Dark Knight Returns, Doom, JL: Crisis on Two Earths, or the Green Lantern Animated Series.

I agree with many other reviewers that the voice actor was the wrong choice for Batman and that the iconic Kevin Conroy voice is the best.  This voice actor's voice has an Adam Westish goofy twinge, old man warble to it.  I'm not saying it's a bad voice, just not the correct choice for the dark knight Batman.

Spoiler below:
Regarding the story, I didn't like the backstory that Batman was a rohypnol victim who was sort of date raped.  That was stupid.  Also, what is the motivation of Talia to 'rebuild the empire'.  Where does she get the money to do it if her 3 fortresses are destroyed and their mining operations also?  Does she offer a ninja assassin work study program / unpaid internship program or does she simply rohypnol them as well?  And if they are working for free, do they also build their own beds and farm their own vegan buffet offerings?  I think she'd have been better off marrying Bruce Wayne and then withholding sex until Batman buys her an army.  Sorry if that sounds like I'm saying something bad about women, I'm not: keep in mind she's a woman without scruples anyway, but as Batman is a flawed hero (driven by vengeance he can never quench because he blames the city for producing criminal elements that killed his parents), maybe it would work as a story.  As participants in a constantly-mutating, modern living myth, I think Batman fans can handle complexity of a Batman with controversial and questionable living arrangements, especially given we love the Dark Knight and his flaws.",1399939200,,1825,4.683385579937304

6124962,4,B00GZ0ML2Y,"The DC Universe continues combining its New 52 Universe and its animated movie universe with ""Son of Batman."" It was a lot easier to adapt ""Justice League: War"" for the big or small screen given that it was already rooted in the rebooted world we've come to know in the past few years. The real question everybody wanted to know the answer to was, ""How will a book written before the launch of the New 52 fit into the new cosmos?"" Whether you like the outcome or not, credit has to be given to DC for accomplishing the feat.

When Ra's al Ghul is assassinated by Deathstroke and his army, his daughter Talia and her son Damian are left on the run for their lives. She takes the boy to the only place she knows he'll be safe: Gotham City and into the custody of the only man she can truly trust - The Batman. The Caped Crusader is caught off guard when he finds out he is the father of Damian. The heiress to the throne of the Demon leaves the 11-year-old under the wing of the Dark Knight. Batman soon finds himself partnered with a new Robin when he is put in the middle of a battle between Talia's new brigade of Man-Bats and Deathstroke's squad.

If you've read Grant Morrison's graphic novel that ""Son of Batman"" is based on, then you know right off the bat (pun intended) this is not as faithful an adaptation as you might have expected. Whether or not you find this to be a good thing or bad is up to you. I personally found it to be entertaining and quite a brilliant way to pull the saga of ""Batman and Son"" into the New 52 world.

""Son of Batman"" is presented in 1080p High-Definition 16x9 (1.78:1) with Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound. Viewers will find the picture is vibrant and clean. The audio will encircle the audience with the bombastic sounds of explosions and atmospheric elements.

The Blu-ray version of ""Batman and Son"" includes a satisfying amount of bonus material. It includes three featurettes entitled ""Strange Blood Ties: Damian Wayne,"" ""Designing the Characters with Phil Bourassa,"" and ""The Fang and the Demon Head: The League of Assassins."" There's also a sneak peek at DC Universe's next animated movie, ""Batman: Arkham Assault."" Four bonus cartoons from the DC Comics Vault top everything off.

""Batman and Son"" is rated PG-13 for Stylized violence including bloody images, and some suggestive material. There's more gore than usual as members of the League of Assassins and Deathstroke's army get stabbed and shot. Several lines of dialogue are rather racy, but most pre-teens probably won't get them. I still don't really know why they needed to be included. Why not just leave them out and know that the movie is safe for everyone without question?

Some will see DC's use of Deathstroke to be a desperate ploy to promote and push the character further into the spotlight while cross-promoting his presence on ""Arrow."" Hey, business is business. DC executives and writers gotta eat, too. I like the character on the television show and I like him in the comics. If you don't like him, then you're probably going to have a problem with his inclusion in ""Son of Batman.""

""Son of Batman"" is made up of the first quarter of Morrison's book sans all the romantic elements and other extraneous elements which could be trimmed out. A little shuffling is done to certain plot elements and events, Deathstroke is thrown in, and ""Voila!"" We get an energetic and fast-paced 74-minute movie.",1399852800,3,3417,4.647350993377484

I was expecting a similar experience when watching Son of Batman seeing as the animation team seem to be the exact same one. However gone was the great story pacing and produced was movie so forced and barely believable. Too many plot holes in this movie such as the inclusion of deathstroke. Animation looks great as ever but everything else is just poor in this movie.",1399766400,,602,4.742857142857143

It was edgy, in-your-face and a bit dark for a (mostly) brightly drawn animated flick.

6124968,2,B00GZ0ML2Y,"I can hardly believe that Joe Lansdale scripted this movie from James Robinson's story. Normally I enjoy a lot of their work, but this movie was sorely lacking on almost every level. Both the characterization and acting was bad, the characters being distorted (with the exception of Damian) from the versions we are familiar with. Deathstroke is awkwardly shoehorned into the plot and becomes a cardboard cutout straw man villain, not even remotely close to his character from the comic books. Forget about watching this if you aren't already familiar with the long history between Ra's Al Ghul, Talia and Batman (the comic book versions); this movie assumes you are, and does nothing to fill in their backstory for viewers who aren't.

Even the animation (except for some CGI stuff) is bland, and the character design is mediocre and boring; nothing like the old days of stylish Bruce Timm/Lynne Naylor character design, or when DC's movies attempted to mimic the style of the artist from the comic story on which the movie was based. Now it just looks ho-hum, like the worst of Marvel's DTV animated features. Might be just a notch above what they used for THE FLASHPOINT PARADOX animated feature, but that's not saying much.

The preview feature for the next upcoming Batman animated feature looks even more appallingly bad, if that's possible. I was hoping for a totally CGI-animated feature, since the film is supposed to be set in the continuity of the ARKHAM ASYLUM/ARKHAM CITY video games. Why couldn't they just have made it look like the cut scenes from the game? Nor, from what I can glean, does it look like the plot of the story (other than being set in Arkham and featuring a bunch of Batman's rogues gallery of foes) has anything to do with the storyline of the game universe. It looks more like a story based on DC ""New 52"" version of the Suicide Squad (although Amanda Waller is still a middle-aged overweight woman in this one). They even admit that Batman does not even appear until halfway into the movie, so the story becomes more of a villains-versus-villains plot, with Batman almost as an afterthought. Oh, and the Arkham Asylum in the movie is an entire island prison, like Alcatraz, Ryker's or Blackgate Penitentiary.

Soo-o-o-o, SO, disappointed in this. This will be the last DC DTV feature that I pre-order. In the future, I will wait until I actually see the DC DTV movies before purchasing, no matter how long that takes. I have the sad feeling that the glory days of DC animation are gone, never to return.",1399680000,10,2538,4.776765375854214
6124969,5,B00GZ0ML2Y,"Especially based on many of the reviews here. :)

First, I've never been a Talia fan or even cared about the Damian storyline, but I did enjoy Jason O'Mara as Batman in the first movie---yeah, he's not Kevin Conroy...but I like him------ so I wanted to give this movie a shot....I thought it was fairly decent...not the best Batman animated movie for sure, but without having read the comic I believe the story regarding Damian was fairly well told....
The best parts for me....really enjoyed the voice actors, I enjoyed Bats, Nightwing, Damian and Alfred for sure and the animation was good.
The worst.... well, it was a very short film, could've been a bit longer and gone more in depth with the story, characters, etc.

6124970,4,B00GZ0ML2Y,"It was fun to watch.  Wasn't the all out best movie, but it was fun to see Damien brought to life on the screen.  I really liked the Nightwing appearance.

Nothing that sounded mysterious or sultry or dangerous.  Robins voice was perfect.",1399680000,,414,4.368421052631579
6124971,1,B00GZ0ML2Y,"Seriously, I imagined that actually happened after they released this film. I truthfully have no idea how this movie, which should have been AWESOME, went so wrong (other than Bruce Timm leaving WB). In a nutshell, this film is based on the 2006 graphic novel ""Batman & Son"" by Grant Morrison and Andy Kubert, in which Talia Al Ghul reveals their son to Batman with the hopes of disrupting his work so Batman cannot interfere with Talia's current evil scheme. Now that you have read that, throw that idea out of the window, as this film ignored that central plot entirely. Instead, the motivation for having Damian meet his father is due to an uprising led by Deathstroke against the League of Assassins that leaves Ra's Al Ghul dead in its wake. That in itself sounds like it could be an alright movie, however the film was just executed terribly. The entire plot line involving the Man-Bat ninjas becomes entirely irrelevant by the end of the film, leaving half the film as nothing more than a waste of time. The characterizations of a few of the main characters were just plain offensive to me as a fan of the comics, most notably Deathstroke and Talia. The filmmakers made Deathstroke a complete coward; he ran from every single fight he was matched up in, and let a ten year old kid cut his eye out, and because of that, he abandoned a surefire victory against the League of Assassins. Talia became nothing more than a damsel in distress that liked to show off as much cleavage as possible, and I feel pretty confident in saying that this isn't the Talia Batman has had a love-hate relationship with over the years. The voice cast was atrocious, with the only two cast members actually doing a good job being David McCallum as Alfred and Sean Maher as Dick Grayson/Nightwing (who, once again, is criminally under-used). The animation was pretty solid, however I'm beginning to notice a discernable lack of emotion animated on the character's faces during emotional moments.

Overall, if you want to experience a good story about Batman discovering he had a son with the daughter of one his most dangerous enemies, go for the graphic novel ""Batman & Son"" and skip this garbage. Even if you find this review to be not helpful, I'm urging you to pay attention to the other negative reviews for this film. ""Son of Batman"" has without a doubt earned the dubious distinction of being only the second Batman film that I have ever disliked (the other being, you guessed it, 1997s ""Batman & Robin"").",1399680000,91,2495,4.683371298405467
6124972,1,B00GZ0ML2Y,"I really love Batman and read this comic series. I loved Under the Red Hood and other previous Batman animated features. This movie is poorly acted, all of the characters speak as though they are in a recording studio. There is a total lack of awareness regarding their environment. The dialogue strikes me as a cut and paste job from every 5th rate crime drama I've ever seen.

6124973,2,B00GZ0ML2Y,"So I normally love the DC animated movies, with very few exceptions (Batman: Year One *cough*). But even that one is more of an issue with the source material. But this? This...

I just watched Son of Batman, and it's the funniest movie I've seen in forever.

Bear in mind, it's so not trying to be. It opens up with tons of gore, death, stabbing, mutilation, sexual innuendos, etc. But there's just so...much...stupid. The opening is an army of gun-wielding ninjas with helicopters blasting up the League of Shadows. Naturally, they win against sword wielders. But not before catapults firing boulders take down several of the helicopters. Also, Talia wields a gatling cannon that fires arrows. Yes. Arrows. And she brings down several helicopters with it, too, because arrows.

Ras al Ghul, of course, is awesome. He gets surrounded on all sides by six gunmen, who all fire machine guns simultaneously. He blocks them all. With his sword. Even ignoring that stupidity, for every twelve shots you'll hear fired in the audio, they'll only do about three blocking sounds/animations. So it ends up looking like these soldiers are just firing tons of blanks while Ras twirls his sword around like an idiot.

Whatever. Ras dies, Talia (who is just around to show off her breasts...even while chained up as a prisoner she's splayed out all sexy-like, chest bulging like some weird gravity-defying melons got surgically implanted into her frontal area) brings her son to Batman, who's the father. And then it gets funny...and insanely annoying simultaneously.

First off: Talia admits to roofing Batman, and then having sex with him, which led to Damian. I just...sure. Let's go with that. Batman getting roofied, can I see that movie instead? And Talia flirts with Batman all super seductive like *while her son is hidden in the room listening and watching*. Nothing creepy there. But now we get to meet Damian...and he's awful. He's an annoying, loud, brash, idiotic annoyance that is technically *supposed* to be all those things, but that doesn't make his presence any more pleasant, nor interesting. Every scene with him, you want to punch him and beg for him to be quiet. When Nightwing shows up, I was pleading with the screen ""pleeeease, let him stay instead, he's so much more interesting!""

Speaking of Nightwing, upon hearing that Damian exists, he exclaims ""The nerve, after all of those talks to me about protection."" Just let that sink in right there. Batman, getting roofied by Talia and giving speeches to Dick about condoms. That scraping sound you hear is Batman's mystique getting dragged through the gutter.

Back to Damian. He fights a muscle-bound roid-monster, whose forearms are bigger than he is. And in that fight, you 1) see this ten (twelve?) year old kid *kick him all the way across the room* 2) engage in and *win* a contest of strength pushing their bladed weapons against each other 3) cross a street by leaping car rooftop to car rooftop...even though the muscle-headed dude ran across just fine, and is a third the speed, and 4) block bullets with his sword. And that's nothing compared to his final battle against Deathstroke, where he has two different blades piercing all the way through both his forearms, pinning him to a wall, which he then rips both out (one pushing the hilt *through* his arm) AND THEN HE PROCEEDS TO BATTLE AS IF NOTHING WERE WRONG. Ten year old kid with massive gaping wounds in both his forearms? Yeah, I see no issue with him blocking an over-head chop by a fully grown mercenary and then struggling against it in another challenge of strength.

And I'm still not to the dumbest part. There's mutagen, apparently. Like, Ninja Turtles mutagen. In this movie, Batman and Damian fight flying mutant sword-wielding bat-ninjas. An army of them. And they take it seriously. There is an actual line of dialog that, as best as I can remember, goes like this: ""Ras thought an army of flying mutant ninja assassins would be unstoppable.""

I just...I...I can't. I've not even scratched the surface of how many bizarre contrivances, bad sexy dialog ('maybe you can let me see those x-rays sometime'), stupidly impossible scenes there are in this movie...and nothing I say here will possibly convey how badly you'll wish Damian would die by the end. And yes, the ending has Batman and Damian facing off against an army of bat-ninjas, feeling like something right out of the end of Van Helsing.

So yeah. Watch if you want a laugh. This is basically what happens when you take storytelling/world-building at the stupidity levels of the Schumacher Batman and Robin, but try to convey it hyper-realized with tons of blood, stabbings, murder, and Batman ripping the tail off Killer Croc.

6124979,5,B00GZ0ML2Y,"Sometimes when I begin to write a review, in particular for those subjects that I may feel less than adequate when others have a much deeper, connection, to the product, I honestly hesitate to write anything at all. That does not mean I believe my opinion or thoughts are not relevant, but it is just a distinction between novice and pro. In this case, the topic of Son of Batman, I hope I can offer some perspective that supports what other reviewers have written, but also encourages those who may not be as informed about the true history of Damon Wayne. It was about 3, maybe 4 years ago that I was first introduced to the discrepancies too many movies, including animations, make by not staying true to the history of a character. My father-in-law, whose comic book collection is jaw dropping to see, row after row of long cardboard boxes full of comics, bag and boarded, told me something I had never considered. The majority of his collections are Marvel, and when asking his opinion on some Marvel movie that was probably being released at that time, he spoke about his dissatisfaction as it relates to the history of a Marvel character or group  of characters that too often is not reflected in films. That was interesting to hear, especially when he began to pull out much older series to show what he meant. I mention this because I am thinking of one review left here and how the reviews states too much of Son of Batman was changed from the original storyline. Because I do not have that background knowledge, just speaking strictly from watching Son of Batman, it is definitely worth the money. But I completely get where the reviewer is coming from because when Marvel announced that Iron Man 3 would be, at least partially, based on Iron Man: Extremis. Man, I was so amped up because I discovered Iron Man: Extremis on Itunes and it was not until the 3rd or 4th episode that I learned it was from comic books or a graphic novel. I think this was in 2009, and I immediately purchased the graphic novel and enjoyed it so much that I bought the DVD of Extremis and the graphic novel as part of the gifts to my father-in-law for his retirement. Unfortunately, Marvel did not do the film justice because too many key elements were changed and they even made The Mandarin into a stupid, secondhand character, which is a complete 180 from his definition in the comics. I understand that additions must be made because a comic or graphic novel may not have sufficient material to make a 2-2 1/2 hour movie. But no one should be expected to turn off what he or she already knows as that is a large portion of the draw when you pay good money to gain access to the theater. For those of you who already know the actual history of Damon and how he was introduced to Bruce Wayne, even how Deathstroke lost his eye (which I do not think Damon had anything to do with, but please correct me if I am wrong), the slights made against the true followers of The Dark Knight will probably end up with a bad taste in their mouth. But for those of you like me who only learned about Damon during The New 52, you will be blown away. There's a lot, A LOT, of blood and action to keep you engaged. The voice acting can at times seem too monotone and unable to give real emotion, and yes this means Batman, too. I've watched it twice now so I enjoyed it. There is even a moment of foreshadowing that suggests Damon will become Batman with his own feature film. Again, I truly enjoyed this, and I think you will, too, but for the hardcore fan, please write your own perspective and teach those of us who do not know better, what, if any, elements work within the film and what you think is absolutely garbage and unnecessary. I hope this helps anyone straddling the fence on this one, and if you find yourself steamed about this one, just remember Batman: Assault on Arkham is coming soon and should be the cure for the common anger.",1399507200,,3923,4.433518005540166

However, when I watch multiple scenes and am consistently thinking: ""C'mon really!??"",  it distracts me from the other positive attributes of the movie such as: the voicing, art work, and sound design (i.e. special effect sounds, background music, etc..).

Instead of bashing this movie for the weak storyline and leaps of reality, I'll leave it at this:
If you're a Batman fan boy like myself, rent it because you know you're going to anyway since we've all been waiting about a year for another DC movie, but don't expect a 4 or 5-star movie; remember, it's up to us to support DC through the good and the bad movies.

If you're not yet a Batman fan boy, then please rent/buy the following movies first; I don't recommend you watch DCU: Son of Batman first, as it is not a good representation of the franchise itself.

Batman: Under the Red Hood
Batman: Year One
Batman: Dark Knight Returns

What keeps this movie from being 4 stars is the voice acting.  All of the actors sound flat and emotionless.  When talking about the death of Talia's father, Talia and Damion have no emotion in their voice.  The same goes for any of the characters that are in any danger.  Batman's voice is good for the character, but shows no emotion only the same monotone voice whether he is talking about the death of his parents or fighting bad guys.  Deathstroke is one of the worst, he loses an eye but his tone of voice is emotionless and shows no sign of pain.  Their is also a scene where Bruce and Damion are arguing in Bruce's office.  The voices are so emotionless any power the scene might have had was lost.

My biggest complain is how choppy the story is, the dialogue doesn't convey things that I have seen in other movies. especially how hot headed Damian is, he should have had the crap beat out of him, and it is unbelievable that he could stand up to Deathstroke and his henchman, the one with the wolverine claws. He looked to young to have the strength which he was portrayed to have. i can understand skill, but age does have a lot to do with it. I couldn't invest in the movie because i lacked knowledge to the overall plot. It developed over time but I feel like the story writers should have flushed out some of the elements which could have improved the overall product.

6124993,2,B00GZ0ML2Y,"I really looked forward to this film for a long time. Then I saw it. And it hurts me to leave this review.

Damian Wayne is both my favorite Robin as well as one of my favorite characters in the DC Universe - which is something remarkable since I borderline hated his character when he was introduced (in my book, the ""surprise offspring"" plotline is what writers do when they're running out of ideas). But he soon grew to be the very reason I got into reading Batman comics again.

The first moment I knew the film was going to have major problems was when they released a ""sneak peek"" of the movie and revealed that the creators of the film were going with the ""Talia drugged Batman"" version of events. This made me downright angry, as this version of events was something writer Grant Morrison himself openly admitted was a screw-up on his part quite some time ago, due to relying on shaky memories he had of ""Son of the Demon"" and not bothering to re-read the material before writing ""Batman and Son."" Source: ""For a long time, [DC] said [Son of the Demon] was out of continuity. Now it's just kind of out of continuity. I didn't actually read it before I started writing this. I messed up a lot of details, like Batman wasn't drugged when he was having sex with Talia and it didn't take place in the desert. I was relying on shaky memories. - Grant Morrison, Wizard #182 (p. 38). Furthermore, the New 52 has already established that Talia and Batman had a consensual relationship (to quote Bruce: ""Damian exists because I let my heart overrule my head"" (Batman and Robin Vol. 1). Why the film chose to go with an established mistake from the pre-52 universe (and meant this to be a New 52 movie) is beyond me, and I don't know why viewers are expected to overlook what basically equates to date rape.

Damian's appeal is his stark contrast to his father - Damian is an anti-hero, relentlessly trained to kill since he was a young child. He is brutal and angry, and that is part of his charm - especially when he actively decides to overcome his past to follow in his father's footsteps. The film skims over Damian's harsh upbringing and presents what I can really only describe as a watered-down version of the character. As a fan of Peter Tomasi's work in Batman and Robin, I do enjoy Damian's calmer, more controlled self, but he did not start out that way. That being said, this version of Damian is not unlikable, but a little underwhelming to those who know him and his long journey to changing from the comics.

A short list of other shortcomings in the film:

-Deathstroke is a wimp (and as much as I love Thomas Gibson, he did not excel as a voice actor - he has a very limited voice range, it basically sounds like Hotch quit the FBI and became Deathstroke).

-The League of Assassins is also embarrassingly wimpy - when the film begins you get to see the fearsome League of Assassins practicing martial arts moves I would expect to see in a children's karate class in a strip mall. Not to mention they use arrow machine guns and trebuchets to defend against military choppers and machine guns. Really?

-In the first few minutes of the film, I was pleasantly surprised to see that the White Ghost (Ra's son) was in the film - IMO this is an underused but great character - then left disappointed after he was killed off after less than a minute of screen time. Quite literally, this was me during that scene: ""Oh wow, the White Ghost is in this mov...never mind that, then.""

-The heart of the film should have been in father/son bonding moments, which are sadly almost completely glossed over. There are a few heartfelt moments (namely Bruce reminiscing about his father taking him to the amusement park where he is now doing surveillance with Damian), but these are few and far in between.

-Talia. I'll just say the animators were going for constant fan-service with her outfit, and she's downgraded from being the central villain in the comic to a damsel-in-distress role in the film.

- Dick Grayson/Nightwing. While portrayed well, he does little in the movie aside from bickering with Damian for no real reason. Grayson serves as a stand-in for Tim Drake.

-I'm not an expert on the Lazarus pit - but I was always under the impression it's dangerous to climb into one if you don't need rejuvenating/reviving. Yet Batman just jumps waist-deep into one.

-Small detail that maybe just bugged me: Damian's green eyes. In the comics, he has his father's blue eyes, and indeed this is the first hint we got that he was Bruce's son.

Some redeeming moments:
-Decent animation
-Seeing Damian in action, even with the differences from the comics he still has some of the classic charm
-I have never been a fan of Grant Morrison's writing, and I always did feel he introduced Damian too rushed and too briefly in ""Batman and Son."" It was nice to see an alternative version of events where Damian isn't rushed away after a handful of issues.",1399248000,,4953,4.55793025871766
6124994,2,B00GZ0ML2Y,"I usually enjoy most of the DC Animated movies.  To date, I can only think of 1 or 2 I dislike.  Now that list has grown to 3.

I don't mind loose adaptations most of the animated features are rather loose and it usually doesnt take away from it.  Son of Batman however, isn't just loosely based, it pretty much just takes the core concept of Damian Wayne and rewrites the entire story.  But, even still, I am not a raving lunatic fanboy, and I can accept a new version as long as its done well.  But the story was not done well at all.

What really brings down the story is the characterization and generic dialog.  The writers here apparently found zero reason to keep some of these characters well, IN CHARACTER.  The ruthless dynamics between Ras and his family is pretty much gone even gone as far as to having Damian cry his heart out over his grandfather.  What?  The Damian character in the comics would have picked up his grandfathers sword and declare himself the new Demons Head of the League of Assassins!  It also seems like a lot of characters are just inserted for the sake of insertion.some as far as having their origins altered to match the plot.  They might look like a character you know, but only in appearances.

I usually also don't complain about voice-acting, but here, only about a 3rd of the voice work is done well.  Many of the characters sound like generic anime voice actors some characters even sound the same.  Slade Wilson in particular is extra generic.

On the positive side, the animation and character designs are nicely done, but its the only good thing I could say about the film.

DC Animated films, to me, are mostly hits with a few misses and this one is a miss.  Rent it before buying and decide for yourself.",1399248000,5,1753,4.455974842767295
6124995,3,B00GZ0ML2Y,"You know something's wrong with the first 5 minutes of the film is nonstop action--swords, guns, helicopters, rockets, and a main character burning to death (graphically). It is unbelievable that Ra's al Ghul was invaded so easily and his palace destroyed so quickly after 500 years. Talia is a lifeless, cardboard character. Damian is completely charmless, makes no effort to be likable in any way, and the writers didn't even bother with father-son bonding, they just threw them together and got busy fighting bad guys. It's one of the most lifeless, meaningless, pointless DC films I've seen. It's not even in the same league as Under the Red Hood, The Dark Knight Returns, or Year One. Since I did not enjoy Justice League War either, and ""sort of"" liked Flashpoint before that, I guess this is a sign that WB/DCAU has changed in the past year and we won't be seeing the same high bar of quality as before. This is definitely a rental, not worth owning since I have no desire to see it again (like War). I believe this may reflect funding difficulties. The film definitely has a rushed feel to it. You just can't shotgun animated films out like this an expect fans to gobble them up when they're rubbish.

edit: After waiting a few months, I decided to give this film another try, because of the release of ""Batman & Robin"" featuring the same characters.

Not only are the characters stiff and act unbelievably but the plot is all over the place and is hardly cohesive seemingly in an attempt to include as many characters as possible. Nightwing and Deathstroke are completely mishandled and underutilized, the league of assassins feel like a bunch of B-movie extras and there is no solid reason to include doctor Kirk Langstrom (the Man-Bat) in a story that essentially revolves around all the league of assassins/Ra's al Ghul.

6125003,4,B00GZ0ML2Y,"Full review at Metal Arcade. Net

Son of Batman, the 20th DC Universe Animated Original Movie and an adaptation of Grant Morrisons comic series Batman and Son, finds the Dark Knight (played by Jason OMara, who also voiced the character in Justice League: War) discovering that he has a child with Talia Al Ghul (Morena Baccarin). Filled with great action, witty dialogue, and superb animation, Son of Batman satisfies on many levels  its personally one of my favorite DC animated films since Batman: Under The Red Hood.

After the headquarters of the League of Shadows is attacked, Talia and her father Ras Al Ghul (Giancarlo Esposito of Breaking Bad fame) attempt to defend the fortress in a breathtaking fight sequence. Right from the start, the eponymous son of Batman, Damian Wayne (Stuart Allan), showcases his incredible ability  shooting and slicing down wave after wave of mercenaries and facing down Deathstroke himself (Thomas Gibson). Soon after, Talia takes Damian to Gotham City to meet his father, as she believes hell be safer with Bruce for the time being. Damian has been trained his entire life to inherit Ras title as head of the League of Shadows, and possesses wisdom and skill far beyond his ten years. However, it falls to Bruce to teach him respect, restraint and control, as when Damian lands on the doorstep of Wayne Manor hes essentially an entitled, petulant child. His egotistical attitude quickly gnaws at the nerves of butler Alfred Pennyworth (David McCallum), and the original Robin, Nightwing (Sean Maher).

Damian quickly assumes the mantle of Robin (after providing a few cheeky remarks at the expense of Nightwings original Robin uniform), and vows to track down and kill those who attacked the League of Shadows compound. Over the course of the film Damian learns to curb his rage and ruthless nature, eventually becoming a huge asset to Batman.

As for the voice acting, Stuart Allan is great as Damian Wayne, easily capturing the characters sardonic wit and egotistical nature. Jason OMara does a solid job in his second turn as Bruce Wayne/ Batman, after Justice League: War. Giancarlo Esposito was a cool choice for Ras Al Ghul, but sadly the character isn't in the film for very long. Sean Maher plays off of Allans Damian quite well, and the two offer up some of Son of Batmans funniest moments. Morena Baccarin is merely decent as Talia, as she seems to be phoning in the role a bit and spends most of the movie as a damsel in distress. Thomas Gibsons voice seemed out of place as Deathstroke  his voice just doesnt fit the character in my opinion, but maybe Im too used to Manu Bennetts awesome interpretation of the character on CWs Arrow.

The Blu-ray of Son of Batman offers some good extras and featurettes. The Fang and the Demon Head: The League of Assassins tells the story of Ras Al Ghuls beginnings as a doctor before his wife was murdered and he gave into the maddening effects of the Lazarus Pit  whose rejuvenating energy has also granted him nearly 500 years of life. It also sheds some light on Talia as a character, beginning life in the comics as nothing more than a femme fatale and growing into a much more nuanced, layered character that would one day manage to seduce Batman  if Bruce Wayne would not marry Talia and take Ras place as the head of the League of Shadows, she would make an heir.

Strange Blood Ties: Damian Wayne focuses on Bruce and Talias son, who would one day take up the mantle of Robin as one of Batmans greatest sidekicks. It talks about Damians upbringing as the heir to the League of Shadows throne, and how he struggles to fit in in the Batcave alongside Nightwing and Alfred, who he sees as simply beneath him, before Bruce instills a sense of honor and respect in Damian. The feature also showcases issue 666 of Batman, which showed a future where Bruce is not successful at getting through to Damian, who becomes a much more chaotic, lethal, and darker version of Batman. This is an interesting story element that I wish would have been explored in Son of Batman, but sadly it was left on the cutting room floor.

The final extras on the Son of Batman Blu-ray include Designing the Characters with Phil Bourassa, where the lead artist goes into great detail about how he took the character designs from rough sketches to final renders, including his thought process behind coloring, linework, and adapting designs from the comics. We also get a sneak peek at the upcoming Batman: Assault on Arkham animated film, which is based on the videogame series and looks great so far. Finally, theres four Batman cartoons from the DC Vault, including an episode of Batman: The Animated Series and Batman Beyond.

While Son of Batman makes considerable alterations to its source material, theres still a lot to like about the 20th animated feature from DC. Son of Batman has perhaps the most action of any DC animated feature thus far, and some great dialogue and characterization as well. The animation is beautifully rendered, and the Blu-ray features a respectable amount of extras and an Ultraviolet Digital HD code.",1398816000,12,5104,4.792946530147895

6125011,2,B00GZ0ML2Y,"This film, based off of the comic run Batman & Son, written by Grant Morrisson, while not my favorite, was a good and enjoyable read. This film however does not retain the enjoyable qualities from the comic and drops the ball. This film is dead out of the gate.

While I didn't enjoy the film overall, I am not all negative, there were a few highlights of this film:

Animation - The quality of the animation, especially in some of the busier, more action-heavy scenes is very well-done. I particularly liked the hand-to-hand combat scenes between some of the characters.

Character Cast - While the inclusion of a specific characters was baffling, I did enjoy that they included a decent cast of characters.

As to the reasons why I disliked this film:

Story - This film had it's plot handed to them on a silver platter, and instead of streamlining it and keeping the important content, cutting off the fat, they almost entirely changed the basis for most of what occurs in the overarching plot. This, sadly, led to this film feeling like an hour long trope full of contrived events and characters.

Run Time - This is one of the slightly shorter films in the DCAU, and it is all the more worse for it. On the contrast, it is ironically an empty feeling film with this condensed run time. It takes little to no time for character development or bonding, yet has some rather long action and fast-paced scenes, feeling rather unbalanced throughout the run.

Characters - The characters in here are just sadly lacking in development, they are all very two-dimensional and without any real sense of, well, character or believability. I also noticed that every character in this film has a very monotone voice, regardless of the direness or excitement level of the situation in which they found themselves. This led to an immediate disconnect right from the very beginning for me. I thought that maybe it was just Batman, being Batman, acting like Batman, but it wasn't just him, and even he would have had some sort of surprise in voice or expression upon discovering he had a son whose existence was hidden from him for years. Everyone was a mannequin in their expressions and their inflections, so I feel that this was more an intentional part of the production team's direction.

Alterations - I believe this is probably where the film suffered most in its production. Mainly with the inclusion of Deathstroke as the big bad in the film, it created a strange atmosphere that didn't quite mesh with everything that I had come to know about his character. His motives, the loss of his eye, and the overall feel of the character underwent an entire change just to accommodate the story. In short he feels like a completely different person, and has been turned into a trope.

In addition to the baffling changes to Deathstroke, the main reason behind Damian meeting Bruce and subsequently living with him has been completely altered. I'm not going to say how, just to avoid putting out any spoilers for those sensitive to such things. This change was wholly unnecessary and unwarranted, it didn't need to happen; this definitely had the film suffering for it. With this change, came the change to some of the characters and their personalities and motives as well, which caused me more disconnect as a fan of the comics. I know who these characters how, I know how they operate and why they operate, and it's insulting to see them twisted into something so vastly different than what has always been established. They might as well have not had Bruce's parents shot when he was a kid, but this is not a ""what if"" or ""elseworld"" story, and I would expect to see the characters as they have been portrayed in the comic runs.

Overall, this appears as a shoddily created film, and it shows in the quality of the final product. I was very disappointed in this entry. I have enjoyed every DCAU films (sans Superman: Doomsday) up until now and this now will be relegated to the disappointing section along with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Superman-Doomsday-HD/dp/B00A6VY32Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Superman Doomsday [HD</a>]",1398643200,101,4166,4.89645390070922

In this movie, Batman does very little to keep a minor from danger while he fulfills his romantic fantasies with Talia. Sound surprised? I was. The voice acting is sub-standard, with the actors emoting with little more than grunts or a simple reading through their lines. Batman is as emotionless as the animation used.

6125020,2,B00GZ0ML2Y,"I got this movie because it is supposedly part of the new dc animated universe starting with Justice League: War and it featured Deathstroke as the villain.
For the positive: the animation is well done and character design is top notch.
Negatives: (Spoiler alert) The story makes very little sense. Basically, Deathstroke wants to control the use of the lazarus pit and decides to guard it with man-bats.  Deathstroke is portrayed as weak, mentally and physically not even close to being in the same league as Batman (Batman beats him easily in hand to hand combat), and is barely a match for Damien Wayne, A 10 year old.
Unfortunately I would say pass on this.",1398211200,9,661,4.747826086956522

Also i hate the voice actor for batman (Jason O'Mara), same as in Justice League War, his voice is not rich in authority or clean. In my eyes Jason O'Mara is nails to a chalk board trying to be batman as his voice sounds that of an aged smokers. I would have loved to see Will Arnett as Batman. Although in this film Batman is not more than a heavy cameo, the title of this is ""Son Of Batman"", after all so it's all about his son. It feels weak for being an animation of the DC series. As a person who loves the DC stories, I'd tell you to watch it, but not worth buying. Some kids might love this Boy wonder as he is the darkest one that ever existed in the series.

6125030,4,B00GZ0ML2Y,"Damian Wayne is Robin  yes, as in Batman and Robin.  Who, you may ask, is Damian Wayne?  To the casual observers out there that pay little attention to Batman comic books, all you really need to know is that even Batman occasionally gets down.  The unnamed love child of Bruce Wayne and Talia al Ghul was originally introduced during a 1987 graphic novel, Son of the Demon.  Flash forward nearly 10 years and infamous Batman writer, Grant Morrison, decided it was time for Batman to meet his son  in a storyline titled, Batman and Son.  And, just like that, Batman had another Robin at his side, which happens to be the subject of the new DC Universe animated original movie, Son of Batman.

Ethan Spaulding directs Son of Batman, which stars the voices of Jason OMara as Batman/Bruce Wayne and Stuart Allan as Damian Wayne/Robin.  The story begins with an attack on Ras al Ghuls (and his League of Assassins) palace by one of the leagues unruly former members, Slade Wilson/Deathstroke (Thomas Gibson).  Ultimately, the unforeseen ambush takes the life of Ras al Ghul, forcing his daughter, Talia (Morena Baccarin), to send Damian to Gotham City to live with his father, Batman  who has absolutely no idea that he has a son.

Eventually, Deathstroke abducts both Talia and Kirk Langstrom (Xander Berkeley), and forces Langstrom to complete a secret project  of which both Batman and Damian take an interest in and begin investigating.  While Batman attempts to connect with his son, its abundantly clear that Damian has no respect for authority and spends his time full of rage  which inevitably pits Damian against the former Robin, Dick Grayson/Nightwing (Sean Mather).  Regardless, Batman, Robin, and Nightwing must find a way to work together and put an end to Deathstrokes master plan.

The actual comic book storyline was allotted plenty of time for depth and character development, and if youve been lucky enough to read it, then youll likely notice how hastily Son of Batman is adapted.  Like most cases, reading the source material is usually the best way to enjoy a particular story, because its abundantly clear that this animated feature doesnt do the comic storyline proper justice.  However, that doesnt necessarily take all the fun out of this feature film.  In fact, specific moments, like the showdown between Nightwing and Damian, make this feature an absolute treat to watch.

In Son of Batman, Jason OMara is back for another stint as the dark knight, reprising his role from DCs most recent animated release, Justice League: War.  Since OMara has again voiced Batman, one could easily assume that Son of Batman is taking place in DCs New 52 animated universe.  Damian has played a pivotal role in the New 52 comic book universe, so its a no-brainer to finally give him the animated treatment.  In this film, his origin story is roughly the same, but like Jason Todds stint as Robin, Damian is now most famously known for his shocking death in the pages of Batman Inc.  Its entirely possible that particular story could also receive the animated treatment in the not so distant future  since comic book fans seemingly love to watch their favorite characters take a dirt nap.

For fans of Robin, its great to see him in a character-centric film, which is easily comparable to another Robin adventure, Batman:  Under the Red Hood.  Still, the villain of this particular story is a bit overshadowing  mainly because Deathstroke is not a typical Batman villain.  As of late, Deathstroke has been all over the expanded DC universe, playing a pivotal role in the Batman: Arkham Origins video game and on the popular TV show, Arrow.  Never the less, Deathstroke plays the role of the villain extremely well in Son of Batman  although his presence and ambitions are nearly identical to that of Bane in The Dark Knight Rises.

If you ask serious Batman fans, they will tell you that the 1990s cartoon, Batman: The Animated Series will forever hold a special place in their hearts and is still regarded by countless Bat-followers as the greatest superhero cartoon, ever.  With that being said, the bloody visuals used within the recent animated comic book features are absolutely needless and completely unnecessary.  The storytelling is what sells fans on these movies, not the senseless bloodshed (or the occasional curse words).  Yes, theres already plenty of violence, so why does the blood matter?  Well, it simply makes these new adventures unfriendly for young kids  and typically, cartoons cater to kids.  In fact, The Dark Knight trilogy is probably more suitable for kids than these gruesome animated flicks.

Overall, Son of Batman is a dreaded mixed-bag adventure  largely due to too much happening in a short amount of time.  It would have been nice to see this film play out longer and take a greater in-depth approach to the relationship between Bruce and Damian, which clearly felt rushed and at times disingenuous.  However, theres a lot to love about this film, also.  From start to finish, theres near endless action (and bloodshed), not to mention several well-placed cameos of prominent Batman heroes and villains.  At the end of the day, Son of Batman is absolutely worth your time, but again, you should be cautioned before allowing the kids to see this graphic presentation.

GRADE:  B-

6125031,4,B00GZ0ML2Y,"Son of Batman is quite good. Being a big fan of Grant Morrison's run on the Batman comics, I thought I knew what to expect but avoided officially released clips all the same in order to prevent any surprises from being spoiled. Well, let me tell you right now that this is not a particularly faithful adaptation of Morrison's ""Batman and Son,"" the original story arc from which the titular character of this animated feature was created.

The basic gist of the plot is there: a lover from Bruce Wayne's past, Talia Al Ghul, emerges from the shadows with a startling revelation: Batman has a 10 year-old son he never knew about. What follows that premise is an origin story for the latest Robin which is drastically different from the one from the comic, yet just as good - if not better.

I was wary at first, as the movie opens with an assault on the primary League Of Assassins' (or League of Shadows for you Nolanites out there) compound, leading to a brutal, action-packed sequence which, in my opinion, was a little over the top. I felt as though they were trying too hard to make Ra's Al Ghul look ""cool"" by exaggerating his ability to deflect bullets with a sword, but the ending of this sequence eventually won me over - as did the rest of the movie which followed.

This is a bloody cartoon, for anyone not aware. People are slashed by swords, blown away at extremely close range by shotguns, stabbed and just generally beat all to hell throughout. It never reaches the level of animated gore as seen in The Flashpoint Paradox, but it's not very far below it either.

Don't be surprised to see a 10 year-old boy wielding a sword and brandishing a handgun, either, because it happens often - and Damian uses these weapons to full effect. Additionally, the level of brutality this character endures is also quite shocking, so depending on your feelings about violence this movie may not be for younger viewers.

For the rest of us, however, this is a solid experience with only a couple of missteps. The vocal cast is generally pretty good, with Morena Baccarin (Talia), Thomas Gibson (Slade Wilson/Deathstroke), and Sean Maher (Dick Grayson/Nightwing) being the standouts. And while I have disliked Jason O'Mara's Batman voice in past features, he finally seems to be settling into the role quite nicely.

I suspect the voice of Damian Wayne himself will be divisive amongst fans of the comic book character. This Robin, more so than any other, is a complex character who can either be a sniveling little snot in one moment, or a noble warrior in the next moment. Be such a fan of the character, I was initially thrown off by Stuart Allen's voice performance, as this Robin has a particularly proper manner of speaking and, in my mind, I always read his voice on the page as more mature with a slight English accent to it. However, I am happy to say that Allen's performance completely won me over by the end of the movie, and he consistently hits all the right marks while portraying the character's youthful energy and extreme inner rage.

As for the visuals, the animation is fluid and oftentimes beautiful during the action scenes. The heavily stylized (and anime-influenced) character designs can sometimes look odd during the more still scenes, but I'd say that this movie fares a little better than Justice League: War in that regard.

All in all, this is a pretty adult tale presented in animated form for fans of the Batman mythos. There are a few instances where the content is unsuitable for younger viewers (for example: it's implied that Talia drugged Batman and had her way with him, which resulted in Damian's birth) so I would keep that in mind. The story is coherent and is a great take on Robin's origin, and anyone who recently became a fan of Deathstroke (Slade) through the Arrow tv show will also probably find a lot to like here.",1397692800,15,3860,4.657856093979442
6125032,4,B00GZ0ML2Y,"If you are a die hard Batman fan, then this movie is for you. If you enjoyed the comic book version of this story then it might not be for you if certain things are changed or not every little detail is presented. Remember is a movie, and an animated movie, and these are never really that long.

As with the last few DC Animated Movies it is packed with action, and as in any Batman movie or animated movie, there are some awesome fights in this one as well. And like the last few DC animated movies, this on is a bit violent, however not like the Justice League movie, no decapitations here. Some slashing and stabbing, and fists.

This is the story from the comics of Batman/Bruce Wayne finding out he has a son. The reason it gets four stars is, I wish they would of dragged this out a bit more and gave us more story. Not just Batman and a new Robin, but more how Bruce connects to his son, how Batman trains and learns to trust the new Robin, maybe how other heros like Nightwing who appears, learns to trust him. This could become an interesting series that I feel should be explored. I mean I know if you really want to know more, you should read the comics, but for someone like me and others who don't have time to read every single comic just to see how that happens it would be great.

As far as the movie itself, I enjoyed watching it. I thought it was as great as some of the other Batman animated movies or DC animated movies. I really hope they continue with this story arc for future Batman animated movies, and continue to show a growing relationship between father and son, Batman and Robin.",1397606400,,1610,4.254901960784314

First off I can't stand the new voice of Batman, bring back Conroy. The animation is very bland like a bad anime, very generic scenes. They set up the Dethstroke character very poorly. After watching Arrow this version is just a former follower of Ras al Gul and nothing more, he has no character. The fight scenes were all too generic and way too many, either fighting tons of ninjas that are all the same or tons of Man Bats that are all the same. I feel like they made this movie as fast as they could for a quick money snatcher. If you are a true fan of DC or Batman you will have trouble forcing yourself to watch this movie, but if you enjoyed some of the lesser rated DCAU films then you will probably be very entertained by this movie.",1397606400,7,920,4.203389830508475

8628822,4,B00GZ0ML2Y,"Like other reviewers, this does have its problems.  I think the vast majority of them can be blamed on time.  For developing Damian from cold-blooded assassin to new Robin probably would have worked if it had been stretched out over like 12 episodes rather than one movie.  Then Talia could have been shown as more the kick-butt assassin she is, Batman working with Robin, so that it wouldn't seem to come out of left-field at the end when Damian spares Deathstroke.  However, to introduce Damian and get everyone where they need to be for the ending in 75 minutes, yes everything was rushed.
Yes, I rolled by eyes when Damian had a strength contest with the big muscle guy, but since he didn't toss the man backwards but redirected the man's direction of attack, I forgave it and moved on.  If he had thrown the man backwards I would have had a problem with it.  Damian's fighting style should have consisted of agility and technique (precision strikes, attack redirection and dodging).  We could have done without the five second strength contest, which is just nonsense, but the rest of the fight was believable.
For those complaining about it being bloody for a cartoon, obviously you are still of the mindset that cartoons equals kid show.  Take that concept and throw it in the trash.  All those Looney Tune cartoons with the WWII jokes were originally attended for adult audiences.  Flintstones sometimes had adult humor in it, so no cartoons does not equal kid show.  Animation is a type of medium for storytelling.  If you are still not convinced, go watch ""Attack on Titan"" to be thoroughly disabused of the notion that all animation is kid stuff.  The first episode, the first ten minutes of the first episode, will cure you of that.  The blood-fest at the beginning of this movie is tame by comparison.",1526774400,,1814,4.735668789808917
