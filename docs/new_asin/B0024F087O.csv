8350389,1,B0024F087O,"I ordered ""Don't Touch That Dial"" before reading reviews and I am very disappointed in the DVD.  As stated by other reviewers, the video quality in over 60% of the commercials is almost non-viewable.  Also, some of the most popular commercials were not included. I do not recommend wasting money on this DVD set.",1293926400,,312,4.7592592592592595
8350390,2,B0024F087O,"This DVD is almost an exact copy of the Madacy set that was released a few years ago.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Classic-Commercials/dp/B0000844HL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Classic Commercials</a>&nbsp;The commercials are in the exact same order and everything, so if you already own that set I do not recommend purchasing this set.",1268438400,7,381,7.488888888888889
8350391,5,B0024F087O,The item arrived within the suggested delivery window and was new and sealed in the original packaging just as the seller advertised. It was given as a birthday gift and everyone was very happy with it. I would definitely buy from this seller again.,1267574400,,249,4.681818181818182
8350392,1,B0024F087O,"This is an interesting collection of commercials, but as another reviewer noted, the poor video quality is distracting and some spots are unviewable.  It's as if they videotaped a TV displaying a not so great quality VHS tape.  I'd be embarassed to release a product of such poor quality.",1259625600,12,288,4.857142857142857
8350393,4,B0024F087O,Anyone who loves nostalgia will love this - today we can't get past commercials fast enough but these are fun to watch.  Taken from the original non-cleaned up films.,1253836800,,166,4.724137931034483
8350394,1,B0024F087O,"I was really looking forward to this but was tremendously disapponted in the film quality.  Considering the subject matter I was ready to look over certain quality issues due to the commercials' age factors; however, I purchased a similiar item which contained several of the same commercials on it and the film quality was SO much better I couldn't believe it!  This DVD has MANY parts which are so illegible or faded you literally cannot see the piture.  I also purchased ""1001 commercials"" DVD set; the quality on ""1001"", which contains many of the commercials shown on ""Don't touch that dial"" was so far superior I know this is not age issues rather the poor quality of this DVD that makes it incredibly bad.  This makes me angry--I feel ripped off by the crappy quality throughout this DVD. And this one had the guts to cost MORE than ""1001""!  I hope that my review can save someone else from wasting their money.",1252454400,33,918,4.6419753086419755
