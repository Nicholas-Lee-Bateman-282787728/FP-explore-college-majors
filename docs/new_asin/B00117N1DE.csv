8240909,3,B00117N1DE,"Decent, but whole video is about an hour and moves very fast. Not a ton of detail - almost more like a set of demonstrations with just a bit of explanation.  This kind of art is hard to say a lot about, but there's a lot of discussion you could have on the internals that's absent here.  Maybe some will like this but I didn't find it that useful.  I read Lam Kam Chuen's book and found that more helpful - having the dvd to see how it's done really didn't help much in this case.",1518393600,,480,3.9791666666666665
