8448234,4,B004YEUFCG,Good collection of video material for newer coaches and definitely a good review for those of us that have a lot of years on the job. I found the information to be worth the $ and I picked up a couple things out of it that I will pass on to my players.,1522022400,,252,3.7735849056603774
8448235,5,B004YEUFCG,Excellent instructional videos. Coach T does a great job teaching the technique and then showing a drill that will help the kids develop the technique. Well worth the low price.,1414108800,,177,4.933333333333334
8448236,5,B004YEUFCG,"I bought this DVD series as a Christmas gift for my son, who is the head coach for the Clayton Civitan. He is very pleased with it and is always looking for ways to improve his coaching ability.",1389225600,,194,4.131578947368421
8448237,5,B004YEUFCG,"I'm a youth football coach and found this DVD set to be extremely valuable in getting my parent/coaches up to speed in coaching youth football. Coach T is a great role model for good coaching and how to teach at the youth level. The medical chapter, alone, made this series worthwhile. I really like how Coach T teaches technique and then how to attack the technique.  Less than a hundred bucks, this series is a steal.",1304035200,2,419,4.5131578947368425
