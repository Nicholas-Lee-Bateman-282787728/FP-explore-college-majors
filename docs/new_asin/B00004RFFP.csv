1343169,1,B00004RFFP,This is not the unrated version. Do not buy it!! NYPD Blue shows more scenes than this.,1100563200,18,87,4.176470588235294
1343170,1,B00004RFFP,"I recently purchased this movie after seeing in the past on cinemax. I bought this after seeing it was listed as unrated and directors cut, which I thought was cool it sounded great. Now unless the director is a prude this is were I was done wrong. On cinemax they showed a hell of alot more than on this DVD. This had so much heavy editing that I felt so wronged in my purchase. If anyone else feels the same join the club. The movie had some hot scenes, but after watching this version I lost the interest real quick. The movie should have at least 3 to 4 stars for its sex and nudity, but I felt wronged. The only thing I could think of is that someone messed up and put the pg-13 version in my box.",1097971200,34,702,4.057553956834532
1343171,1,B00004RFFP,"As others have noted, this is NOT the uncut version, but rather the very watered down R-rated version.  I have the R-rated copy, as well as this ""director's cut"", and they are identical.  This was either a grossly negligent error on the part of the studio, or a deliberate misrepresentation for the sake of increased sales.  Either way, if the real deal is what you seek, be forewarned and stay clear of this disk!",1085097600,15,414,4.5675675675675675

1343173,1,B00004RFFP,"I Can't believe I purchased this worthless DVD. I have the VHS version(R-Rated Version) that I purchased A few years ago. And when I found out that the unrated version was coming out on DVD
I thought to myself YES... this is the version that I've been waiting for because Cinemax doesn't doesn't show that movie anymore. WHAT THE %$@#!!!!! It's the same cut up version that I already have on VHS !!!!!! Consumers BEWARE!!!",1083024000,9,422,4.64
1343174,1,B00004RFFP,The first time i saw this picture was on a late night channel and it was hot. So i forget to tape it. But i say to myself maybe Amazon will have it. And they had this movie. I bought it right away. When i watched it...it was not the same because the best scene was cut off and it was the kitchen scene with the 2 girls. Don't get me wrong the actresses in this movie are awesome but it's not enough to save the movie. If you want my advice buy something else or real classics like Porky's or Fraternity Vacation.,1018051200,6,512,3.9805825242718447

1343196,5,B00004RFFP,There were scenes in there that weren't in the one i checked out back in 1999-2000 time range one the VHS copy. They were AWESOME scenes and I loved how the panties come down.

1343219,3,B00004RFFP,"The cut versions of this movie have gone out of print. This is an adequate entry for the Surrender Cinema series about a stressed out couple that checks into haunted Hotel Exotica to explore wild fantasies. Gary Graver did the photography,  his work is almost always good and Nikki Fritz has a small part.",1330300800,,305,4.648148148148148
1343220,5,B00004RFFP,"The DVD is an edited version of the film.  All of the erotic scenes are cut out.

The original VHS is the version you want to see.  I don't know where you can buy it, but believe me, it doesn't show on Cinemax anymore for a reason-it was too hot for tv.

Don't blame the director-she didn't have anything to do with the editing of what they are calling the ""director's cut.""",1187481600,,374,4.152777777777778
1343221,1,B00004RFFP,"When Ellen Evans directed this movie she managed to get sex scenes with energy, passion, sensuality, and creativity. Fans of softcore know how rare these things can be. An just how skilled a director has to be to accomplish them. Which make the directors cut of this movie (Which is being sold here) such a mystery. My only guess is that when she was given the chance to reedit this film she wanted a to make a version that she could watch with her 14 year old daughter, or maybe she was trying to get a job at the Hallmark Channel. What ever the reason if you are a fan of the Oxygen Network buy the Directors Cut, if you are fan of softcore get the original version.",1170460800,,668,4.2265625
1343222,2,B00004RFFP,"Here's the definitive word on the DVD version...

Koch got it wrong, plain and simple. The box both lists the runtime at 85 min. and the fact that it is supposed to be the Director's Cut. It isn't...it's the edited 71 min. version. I've never seen the VHS version, but you probably want to check that one out rather than the DVD.",1153267200,2,329,4.306451612903226
1343223,5,B00004RFFP,"I'm reading bad review after bad review which refer to the censored and cut DVD VERSION of this movie.  This is incorrect and needs to be fixed by Amazon. The specific box UPC code which ""leads"" to this product page and Amazon ASIN number is for the NOT RATED video (VHS) version of this movie.

As we all know, ""not rated"" is the Hollywood euphamism for ""we knew we couldn't get it past the film censor without it being cut to shreds, so we didn't even try"".

BTW, both the box and the cassette case state that this VHS version is the FULL 90 minute (i.e.: uncut) version.

We are a seller. As part of our listing process we review all used movies for quality issues. And I gotta say: this is a pretty hot movie.  5 Stars for hotness, and to counter all the inappropriate 1's.....",1140307200,4,781,4.285714285714286

Forget what the product description says, it is wrong! This is movie is a heavily edited version of Hotel Exotica with almost 20 minutes of footage cut!

Amazon should either stop selling this DVD or correct the information about it to say that it is NOT and uncut version and that it is only 71 minutes long.",1115337600,55,450,4.2823529411764705
