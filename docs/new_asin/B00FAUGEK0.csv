8613908,5,B00FAUGEK0,"The National Wrestling Alliance was the standard of professional wresting for decades in the 20th century as they were the governing body over numerous territories around the world however with the national expansion of the World Wrestling Federation and other territories leaving for various reasons throughout the 1980's, the value of the NWA's power was heavily reduced from 1990'S to today to the point where they were only relevant through either association (WCW in the early 90's, WWE in early '98, the first 5 years of TNA, title matches in ROH) or controversy (Shane Douglas throwing the belt down in ECW).  However things started to change starting in late 2010 as two men began one feud that would start in one promotion & evolve over time into a series of seven matches in seven different locations with seven different stipulations that would bring back more attention to the NWA itself than it had in previous years to the point where it was voted by the fans as a runner-up in Pro Wrestling Illustrated magazine's feud of the year only for things to fall apart due to politics that weren't best for business so here's the story of how it started to how it ended between Adam Pearce & Colt Cabana in Seven Levels Of Hate.  Various names involved in the presentation include Adam Pearce & Colt Cabana themselves, Championship Wrestling From Hollywood (CWFH) owner David Marquez, referee Rick Knox, ex-NWA board member Bill Behrens, ex-NWA C.O.O. Fred Rubenstein, ex-NWA Executive Direction Bob Trobich, CWFH talents Stu Stone & Angelo Trinidad & James Morgan & Percy Pringle III, New England Championship Owner Shelton Goldberg, Steel Domain Wrestling representatives Mich Karch & Ed Hellier, Metro Pro Wrestling owner Chris Gough, West Coast Wrestling Connection owner Jeff Manning, Warzone Wrestling representatives Ben Gilbert & Steve Ward, and columnist Jay Cal & Dan Murphy & Bill Apter.

The documentary beings with both men talking about growing up in Chicago & how their relationship with each other dated back from being high school football rival to both being trained together & working together early in their careers.  NWA Championship Wrestling From Hollywood was discussed next from how the feud began to the build to the championship match based off the simple formula of ""good vs. evil"" with the heavy amount of positive response that was drawn to it from social media including talents from other companies before going into the details of why the decision was made to go a different direction six weeks later & why to this day it's so hard to understand why it happened, the heavy amount of negative backlash & the aftermath that caused the NWA to ""press the reset button.""  The steps taken to right the wrong that was done was discussed next in detail from the conditions Pearce demanded to how their story this time had to be different with Colt using the mentality ""Back To The Future III was a western"" before going into the creation of the Seven Levels Of Hate series was discussed next with the concept being seven different NWA Championship matches in seven different cities with each match having a special stipulation with Adam Pearce putting his NWA career on the line if he didn't win the series.  The series of matches was discussed in detail throughout the rest of the documentary from the importance of the First Blood match happening in Hollywood & significance of a picture taken from the match of a specific turnbuckle, why the owner of NECW joined the NWA just to host the Street Fight & how he ended up getting the Dog Collar match as well, the importance of ""I Quit"" match in terms of how where it was held had significant to both Cabana & Pearce & how both men setup the strategy going into this match based off their previous two matches, how Pearce having a 102 degree fever effected the 2 out of 3 falls match, and how the Death Match came together at the last minute.  How the changes within the NWA starting with a lawsuit to new ownership started to effect the plans already set in place was deeply discussed including such details as CWFH leaving the NWA, the decision they made to not work with Colt Cabana, issues with Adam over keeping his advertised commitments, and what their final decision was that was the last straw going into the final Steel Cage match that ended with the line ""we wish you well in your future endeavors"" before the documentary concluded reading comments from fans & various personalities reflecting back on the series.

DVD extras include each of the seven matches from the series (listed below) that include such highlights as each pre & post match interview with both men, the unique first fall in the 2 out of the 3 falls that I've never seen happen before & an appearance by ROH ring announcer Bobby Cruise doing a very special ring introduction as it should also be noted that the sixth match does encounter some minor technical difficulties but nothing that effects the quality of the match.
Match One - Championship Wrestling From Hollywood: First Blood
Match Two - New England Championship Wrestling: Street Fight
Match Three - Steel Domain Wrestling: ""I Quit""
Match Four - Metro Pro Wrestling: 2 Out Of 3 Falls
Match Five - New England Championship Wrestling: Dog Collar Match
Match Six - West Coast Wrestling Connection: Texas Death Match
Match Seven - Warzone Wrestling: Steel Cage Match

Now I have to admit that this documentary was more personal to me than any other wrestling presentation I've ever watched because of the fact that I've seen this feud from start to finish not just watching it on television but being there in person at every Championship Wrestling From Hollywood to witness it live so I felt like this was a great presentation on two men with supporters behind them attempting to make history & restore prestige to a championship & name of the NWA only for the company itself to make decisions that went against the grain that ultimately left the NWA arguably in a worse position than it started.  Now it should be noted that Adam Pearce was heavily involved in the creation of this project from start to finish & I thought it was very well put together from the production to selection of music so I have to recommend this for any fan of Colt Cabana, Adam Pearce, or of independent wrestling period.",1383177600,5,6321,4.796143250688705
