8563586,5,B00B7BGTDS,"Jennifer's Yoga in 10 DVD is great for the newbie to the yoga enthusiast. She provides instruction but also allows for you to move with your breath, allowing for the ""healing power"" in your yoga practice. The DVD 10 minute segments are broken up into: Constructing the Vinyasa, Vinyasa Flow, Lunge Flow, Warrior Flow, and Tension Tamer. I had a slight sweat after completing the entire series of 10 minute workouts in sequence and felt refreshed upon completion. She recommends a mat and yoga block for the practice. I have QUITE A FEW workout and yoga DVDS, to include many of Jennifer's. I recommend her Yoga in 10! :-)",1372636800,7,621,4.706422018348624
