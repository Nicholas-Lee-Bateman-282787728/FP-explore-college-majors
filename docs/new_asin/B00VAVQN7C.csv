7084415,4,B00VAVQN7C,"I wasn't quite as blown away by this as I was by Akins amazing debut film After the Triumph of Your Birth, but I still quite liked it.  It stayed with me in the days after I saw it, and I look forward to seeing it again.  Akin has a great eye for images, a good touch with actors, a strong ear for music (in collaboration with his wildly talented wife, singer/songwriter Maria McKee), and - most important - a unique voice as a film-maker.  Weve all seen too many coming-of-age films, but this one feels different, fresh, poetic, oddball and honest enough that it rarely feels like weve been here before.

A very bright 12 year old girl (Moriah Blonna) lives with her charming, often sweet and funny, but also self-involved and self-destructive surf-bum dad (Tom Donne) on the edge of the human sideshow that is Venice beach.  The key woman in their lives  his wife, her mother  died 2 years ago, leaving a gaping hole that shes too young to fully grapple with, and hes too damaged to really repair.  So he hides behind booze and women, and she prowls the beach and has visions of her mother, in search of answers and meaning, trying to figure out how to grow up without any truly functional parents. But if that sounds depressing, know that the film keeps alive a rueful sense of humor and an off beat sense of poetry - visual and structural - amidst the emotional challenges.

The story is essentially a series of set pieces, and some work better than others.  There are moments that feel too self-conscious, or heavy handed.  But for every one of those, there are several lovely poetic moments where Akin captures the ephemeral simultaneous wonder and terror of growing up in a crazy, beautiful but difficult world.",1440028800,4,1718,4.563517915309446

7084454,5,B00VAVQN7C,"there are many films which try to capture the inner life of the young as they try to come to an understanding of the world adulthood and their place in it - this is one of the very best - like a totally internalized 400 Blows - all the pangs of want and beauty and passion and uncertainty - all the
transitory fleeting moments - like the ocean she loves - a wonderful film - and a wonderful performance by Moriah Bloona - a must see...",1440892800,2,435,4.069767441860465

8709743,4,B00VAVQN7C,"Another mesmerizing film from Jim Akin, whose first film (After the Triumph of Your Birth) was made for literally next to nothing. He has such an original eye that invites you into his hypnotic world. The rhythm of his storytelling is like listening to a song. I'm so happy to see this film available for Prime members. Jim is truly an independent filmmaker.",1514678400,,358,4.698412698412699

8709749,4,B00VAVQN7C,"A surreal but thoughtful slice of life, told from the perspective of a 12-year old girl living on the beach in Venice, California. The lead actor, Moriah Blonna is an absolute delight. Full of curiosity and pathos, every time the camera captures her face she reveals an entirely new expression. The melancholy feeling is occasionally heightened by the talents of songstress Maria McKee, including her breathtaking vocals, who plays Helena's late mother. Sweet, memorable - I'm expecting continued great works from director Jim Akin.",1464307200,,532,5.345238095238095
