8076821,5,B000AA4GSW,"First of all, this is a region 2 dvd, so it will not play on region 1 (U.S.A. & Canada) dvd players. You'll need to get a Universal DVD player, but its easy to get one, and its well worth the investment. I ordered one from Amazon, & it works perfect for all regions, and it was priced around $35. The Universal dvd player is well worth the investment.

Now this dvd, Thank God I have one, these are getting to be scarce. This features a concert by Golden Earring, filmed in Holland on June 23, 1984. This band rocks!!!!
I still have the VHS of Golden Earring's videos, that I bought back in the 1980's.

This band is very guitar oriented. Plus, they have Rinus Gerritsen on one of those big, double armed, electric, 8 string bass guitars. The main electric guitar player is George Kooymans, he is also, one of their 2 lead singers. Then you have Barry Hay, who is the other lead singer, and at times, especially towards the end of the concert, he plays the electric guitar also. Barry is the one in the White Tee Shirt. This band puts 100%+ effort into this concert. On the song ""Twilight Zone"" (A.K.A. ""When the Bullet Hits the Bone""), it is totally awesome. You get a long guitar solo, as follows - the double armed, bass guitar player (Rinus), plays a continuing rhythmic tune, while George plays a totally different tune simontaneously. It is very well coordinated, and so amazing, that it just simply defies description.

This concert is pure, Hard, Classic rock!!!

The line-up is:
George Kooymans - lead electric guitar, lead vocals
Barry Hay - lead vocals, and electric guitar (Barry also portrays the ""secret agent"" type guy in the intro - twilight zone, and in the video for ""Twilight Zone"".
Rinus Gerritsen - Doubled Armed 8 string electric bass
Cesar Zuiderwijk - Drums

The song set is:
Intro - Twilight Zone (This includes an excellent video introduction that goes way back to the 1980's, with the ""secret agent"" guy (Barry) & the ""cut-off"" poker card. It also shows the bullet going through the poker card. Then it has these ""hit men"" who are after him. Barry ""the secret agent"" guy is beginning to think ""that eternal fate has turned its back on him"". He tries to run from the hit men, who are out to kill him, and gets hit by a car, and then taken to a hospital, then the concert begins.)

7. N.E.W.S.

10. Twilight Zone - This one is sung by Barry & also George. It is totally awesome. ""He's beginning to realize that eternal fate has turned its back on him"", ""its 2:00 A.M., the Gun's still warm""....""You are going to know, when the bullet hits the bone"". In this song you get that unique ""one of a kind"" long guitar solo, with Rinus playing a continous rhythmic tune, while George plays an entirely different tune on his guitar, its awesome. Dancing girls come on the stage and dance to the music, and at times their faces turn into the faces of the ""hit men"", who are trying to kill Barry.
Outro - Twilight Zone

The Videos: (These are the original videos, back from the 1980's and they rock!!!)
1. Twilight Zone - ""A mini movie bascially."" Barry the ""secret agent"" guy is shown being shot by a gun. It show him with the ""cut-off"" poker card. He meets a woman who has the matching other half of the ""cut-off"" poker card. So, he thinks she's legitimate. They go to bed, and she pulls a gun on him, but he stops her, and he realizes that she is part of the enemy. So, he leaves, and the ""hit men"" who are out to kill him, finally catch him. He is taken before a firing squad, and the video ends. It's a great ""mini-movie"", music video. Also, in this video you get those Dancing girls in those back suits, dancing around a tied-up Barry. It's a Great Video!!!!
2. When the Lady Smiles
3. Clear Night Moonlight
4. Turn the World Around

This is one TOTALLY AWESOME DVD!!! IF YOU DON'T HAVE A UNIVERSAL DVD PLAYER, THEN GET ONE, IT'S WELL WORTH THE INVESTMENT. I'm so glad I did, so I can watch dvds just like this one. Thanks!!!",1263340800,7,4163,4.384715025906735
