First of all, the artwork is fantastic, and the idea behind the anime is fascinating. There are even a few moments in it that make you laugh. Unfortunately, that is where all of the good points end. I have no idea what the creator ""Oh! great"" was thinking when he created this series, but it definitely was not rational. The characters in the series are awesome, but there is absolutely no plot. All the creator does is throw the characters at each other and yell ""fight!""

Even though that is bad enough, he ruins any chance for redemption when he spends half of the first season on ""backstory"". Any good writer/artist knows that spending an episode or two on backstory is fine, it adds to the plot and allows for further character development. What you do not do, is spend 10-12 episodes in an approximately 23 episode anime to talk about backstory that has little to no relevance whatsoever to the main story. When it finally gets back to the main story, you are left thinking, ""What exactly was I supposed to learn from that? It never answered the question the character asked in the first place!""

All in all, if you watch anime and read manga solely for the purpose of looking at the artwork, then by all means get this series. However, if you actually want to enjoy a good story while appreciating Japanese art styles, stay away from this series at all costs!",1219795200,,1454,4.479245283018868
8488901,1,B0009PW00Y,"Started off Strong, it had an excellent intro and basic characters but it got way too off subject with boring Japanese School political structures and not enough fighting or interesting plot devices.  There were instances where it looked as if there was going to be some serious action but they just talked it to death.  My Favorite scene when Sechiro and the ""Nice Guy"" were fighting ing the lunch room, #1.  punches were stopped with chopstick, 2. lots of punches and killer techniques and #3.  When the street punk used a dirty trick to distract his opponenet.  Lets just say he pays the price for his dishonorable tactics.
Overall I would have to give this series a 3 out of 10.  Just neflix the first 2 discs and call it a loss",1192579200,2,732,4.507575757575758
