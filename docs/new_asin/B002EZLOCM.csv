8368691,2,B002EZLOCM,"This movie is not a total waste, however it is not a movie I would necessarily recommend either. The story line leaves room for what could have been a really good film. However, the acting was substandard and choppy as was the filming. The singers were quite talented, unfortunately for them the main song was not great. Maybe worth a watch if you are watching while multi tasking.",1496361600,,381,4.617647058823529
8368692,2,B002EZLOCM,"DREAMS OF THE DEAD  and THE HAUNTING OF DANBURY HOUSE are the same film. It includes a pseudo history. Samuel Arnold, a mad hatter, murdered two girls and was never caught. Now their ghosts haunt the house, but they aren't that scary since one them doesn't wear clothes. Did they have thong underwear a 100 years ago? Descendant Aubrey Arnold (Cathy Loch) is a singer and songwriter and wants to hold a recording session in the house against the wishes of her father. Ghosts? yes. Scary? No. In fact there is a scene where they all sit around the table and discuss the house that lasts way way too long. Sound is choppy. They filmed in the rain and it sounds like they simply put a plastic bag around the microphone to annoyingly magnify the raindrops.  Available on multi-packs.

Filmed in Allentown, Pa.

8368693,1,B002EZLOCM,the previous positive reviews must have been submitted by family of the cast in this movie; this is the first time I submit a negative review but I felt I had to warn others that might be fooled by the other reviews as I was.  Do yourself a huge favor and rent it if you are still curious ; you'll be glad .  Even the rental fee is too much for this one though.  I kept waiting throughout the movie and believe me that was a painful experience; for laughs I watched the interviews with cast members and saw some of their painful expressions as they were being interviewed; even some of the cast felt embarrassed being linked to this piece of work.  rent first ; you'll thank me for this info.,1254873600,,692,4.21969696969697
8368694,1,B002EZLOCM,"this movie was horrible....not sure where all the positive reviews came, but this was utter garbage..another movie that was shot with a camcorder, and ..basically no  budget, and people off the streets trying to act(if thats what you wanna call it)...terrible!!! terriblle!!!!",1253664000,5,276,5.571428571428571
8368695,1,B002EZLOCM,Beware of these bogus reviews.  All these 5 star reviews were made by people in and/or involved with the making of this film.,1253577600,6,125,4.434782608695652
8368696,5,B002EZLOCM,"When I learned that this movie was made by the same guy, Orrichio, who made Abduction, Requiem for a Vampire and Black Ribbon, I knew I had to see it. He has amazing talent and imagination, and it shows in every one of his movies. Dreams Of The Dead is a first class mystery/thriller/ghost story that exceeded all my expectations. It's an excellent movie with twists and turns that kept me glued to the screen. This is one movie you don't want to miss if you like mysteries and ghost stories.",1247616000,2,492,4.417582417582418
8368697,5,B002EZLOCM,"A watched this movie after enjoying ""Abduction"" from the same director/writer. What an entertaining movie! Well worth a view.",1246233600,2,125,5.631578947368421
8368698,5,B002EZLOCM,"Dreams of the Dead is a funny little movie...part goofy comedy and part erotic horror film.  The best part of it, though, is that the cast is made up of almost all women and they are strong characters who don't fall into the ""bimbo"" or ""dumb blonde who gets killed"" role.

It's a strong film from John Orrichio who also made the film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Abduction/dp/B002EZLOCC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Abduction</a>...check it out!",1246060800,3,489,6.176470588235294
8368699,4,B002EZLOCM,"Made by the same guys who made the film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Abduction/dp/B002EZLOCC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Abduction</a>, this movie looks like an earlier work.  It's got a bunch of really cute ladies who move into a haunted house to record an album.  The ghosts are also some very attractive women who seem to enjoy getting naked and playing pranks.

It's a goofy, fun movie that doesn't take itself too seriously.",1246060800,3,474,6.2615384615384615
