8217627,5,B000VA3J6G,"Okay, this might not be for everyone but if you love dry British humor at it's very best then this dvd should be on your Christmas wish list.  The dvd includes the more traditional humor as well as some delightful musical numbers that take well known tunes and put them into an entire new light.  One that this reviewer particularly found delightful was a bit at a large Victorian Christmas party and use of Gilbert and Sullivan tunes.",1442707200,,435,4.564102564102564
