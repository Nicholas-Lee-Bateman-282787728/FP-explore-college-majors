6016230,5,B00FOGH2RY,"Even after so many years, ER is still a great show.  The episodes are as compelling as ever, and the picture and sound quality are also excellent.  The only negative thing I have to say is that when you only want to watch one or two episodes at a time, you have to go through this scene index for each episode until you finally get to the start prompt.",1410307200,16,352,4.086956521739131

6016241,5,B00FOGH2RY,"Hopefully one day you'll release on BluRay and give this tv series the respect it truly deserves but seriously someone needs to be fired for the packaging design on this abomination.

Don't stop that from you buying it....some of the best tv ever produced and has aged very very well. My wife and I really enjoyed watching this from start to finish, great ""direction and editing"" true suspense.....and not relying on cgi to tell the story.

But seriously WarnerBros how did you guys seriously have 3 different type of season covers within the ER dvd package. Was it designed by someone on work experience?",1516320000,,605,4.8076923076923075

6016258,4,B00FOGH2RY,"Had no issue with the packaging or the product as a whole.  I was watching the series on cable and decided to get the whole thing for when I moved this summer and I could watch on my portable blu ray player.  I really liked the series as a whole up until they killed off Doctor Greene.  The original cast is what made this series good in my opinion, and the people they brought in later just weren't of the same quality.  Its five stars up until season eight or so, then sinks down to just OK with three stars or so up until the end.  Overall four stars.",1502150400,,554,4.045871559633028

6016265,2,B00FOGH2RY,"This is a great show, arguably one of the best dramas in TV history.  But the quality of these DVDs is just abysmal.  Each season comes inside a plastic case with little floppy holders for each disk.  The quality of the plastic is horrible and the case barely stays closed.  Once you open the case the DVDs are falling out of their holders because it's such cheap plastic.  To take it one step further each plastic case is covered with cheap cellophane, similar to what many libraries use to cover their books.  It just gives an overall horrible cheap feel.  This is very disappointing considering the high cost of this boxed set.  The first disc I tried played fine up until the last 5 minutes of an episode where it began freezing and stuttering.  There were no noticeable scratches or dust on this disc, which means this is just bad production quality. People have complained about this same problem in other reviews so it must be a widespread issue. Now I'm worried because by the time I have a chance to watch all the discs in this set I will be well past the return period.  Who knows what else will go wrong...",1499299200,,1117,4.458128078817734

I'm glad I bought the set. I'm seeing ER for the first time,when it first came on tv,I was too busy to watch it. Make sure you check all your disks when you get them. I recommend the sets.

6016284,5,B00FOGH2RY,"AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME!! My wife has wanted this set for quite a while, so I finally got it for her for her birthday. I personally had forgotten how well done this show was. We have been binge watching 2 or 3 episodes a night (most nights- we still have lives ;>} ) and loving every minute of it! There are 15 seasons and 331 episodes, so after several weeks, we are just getting to the end of season 3. Given that it's the beginning of May and the busy summer season, I figure it'll be fall before we finish it.

The medical parts are still just as well done as new dramas today, like Grey's Anatomy. The social and personal dramas are just as relevant today as they were in the mid-90's (yes, it's been 20 years since it started! ) and it's nostalgic to watch them try to work without cell phones or the internet and try to function with just land lines and fax machines. (If you really want to feel nostalgic, watch Rainman and the constant search for a pay phone during their cross country adventure...and then try to remember the last time you saw a pay phone). Another fascinating aspect of the show is the number of social issues they explored in just the first season alone, much less the whole series, and the depth with which they explored them. As I said, many of these issues are just as relevant today as they were 20 years ago. For example, in the first 3 seasons they have had story lines about; mental health, suicide, abortion, right to die, drug addiction, racial division and inequality, gender inequality, gun violence, healthcare insurance inadequacies, drug prices, transgender issues, gay rights and so on. Talk about relevant. That list could just as easily have been a rundown of issues to be discussed on the next Anderson Cooper show. It also may make it sound like it's a very grim show and about as much fun to watch as Cspan. But, of course, the other story lines explore love, family, personal losses and victories, heroic triumphs of the human spirit, spiritual and personal growth and much more. They did an excellent job of juxtaposing these vastly different issues against each other in such a way that you will be ready to cry in one scene and then cheer in the next. Not much more I can say about it other than at 45 minutes per episode and 331 episodes, this is just shy of 250 hours, or 10+ days straight, of quality entertainment. It's also far better than the vast majority of stuff on TV today, in my humble opinion. I hope this review has helped. Thanks",1493683200,59,2499,4.480263157894737
6016285,5,B00FOGH2RY,I love this show and now I am glad I have all the seasons,1492992000,,57,3.142857142857143

It is not my brand new DVD Blu Ray Player (which is the first thing I checked) nor is it that the discs are dirty or scratched (I checked them second). AND all of my other DVDs are playing just great, as usual. I am so frustrated and disappointed that I cannot watch it again (which is the whole reason one purchases DVDs and that it is unreturnable.

6016299,1,B00FOGH2RY,"Incredibly disappointed with this.  The box case has a ding in it and a small tear at the top.  Season 1 plastic case is broken and there were pieces of plastic rattling around in the case.  The ding in the box seems to correspond with the break in the season 1 case.  The next two seasons have cracked cases.  The plastic pole that holds the DVD's in place is broken in 2-3 seasons. Some seasons are made with the plastic pole to hold DVD's in place, others in a type of fold-out cardboards.  The box this was shipped in has no flaws at all, so this was not damaged in shipping.  This would seem to have been shipped with defects already in place.  This cost almost $200 and I expect things to be perfect.  This was supposed to be a Christmas present.  It is December 19.  How can this possibly be made right by then?",1482105600,4,818,4.212903225806452

6016304,5,B00FOGH2RY,"This seminal series disappeared from TV when TNT ended the syndication a number of years ago. Since then, I've been wanting to watch the series from the beginning. Finally, I told my husband that I wanted the series for my birthday. I know it's going to be a major project to watch all of it but I will.

This series set the standard for all the medical series that are on TV now - Code Black, Chicago Med, Night Shift. Their scripted stories brought a reality to prime time TV that had never been shown before. The acting was impeccable and the stories pulled you in.

If you love good television and want to make an investment that will last, this is the series to buy. I know from experience that, if the show was good and you loved it when it was in its original run, you'll love it again on DVD. And, of course, you won't have to watch the commercials because there aren't any. You also get the special features which can give you insights you never had before. All in all, a worthwhile purchase.",1478217600,10,1001,4.319148936170213

6016317,5,B00FOGH2RY,"This has been a favorite television show of mine since I was a child. My parents and I would all watch it together and I have fond memories of Thursday nights spent with Doctor Carter, Doctor Lewis, etc. My mother recently passed away and watching this show provided me comfort as I relived familiar stories, as well as a few that I'd forgotten about.

The story quality varies from season to season and it tends to jump the shark a bit towards the last couple, but it's still quality television that stands up to all the other great 90s television dramas. I know it's expensive but it's a worthwhile investment if you plan on taking care of the DVDs and the case.",1466035200,2,664,4.442622950819672
6016318,4,B00FOGH2RY,"UPDATE: Seasons 6, 7 and 8 also do not have English subtitles. Just started the Season 5 set and am very dismayed that the only subtitle options for this season are French and Spanish. I rely on the subtitles because I live near a military air base and the jets are very loud. Other than that, so far I am delighted to have this entire series!! I've always loved the show and am now happily bingeing my way through the series. I will update if there are any other seasons that have this issue.",1465862400,5,493,4.25531914893617
6016319,5,B00FOGH2RY,"Have received the set.  Can't believe how nicely packaged it is.  Was trying to watch on Netflix by having discs shipped but it is an absolute luxury to just have them all available when I want.  All fifteen seasons in their individual packaging and the single-sided discs are very nice!  I should comment on the DVD quality.  If you're thinking of rewatching ER but are concerned about doing so on DVD's, don't worry, with a quality upconverting Blu Ray/DVD player, these are simply excellent.  Rich detail and surprising sharpness.

As far as the show goes, we've watched up to halfway through Season 8 and I can't believe how good this show is/was.  Keep in mind that it was THE BIG THING for a decade or more and the production values are through the roof!  It is clearly the masterwork of several top notch actors that you will never forget!  I watched through about season 9 in the nineties and early 2000's and really missed all the original characters but I plan to watch the entire series this time around.  When it first exploded onto the scene, I remember ER being a raging monster of a series that dominated the airwaves.  Having watched and enjoyed many modern shows, I'm surprised just how well it has aged.",1464825600,2,1221,4.627906976744186

6016322,5,B00FOGH2RY,"nice boxed set. very reasonably priced. only thing missing is the  parts of the episodes which recap the previous weeks highlites, which were not included on the dvd's. Episodes are presented in chronological order on each season. Some bonus material within each set, sometimes the bonus material is not where it is suppose to be, from where the menu says it is. Otherwise, pretty good. Picture quality is good, not great. Perhaps the blue ray edition has better picture quality.",1460937600,,479,4.9875

6016326,5,B00FOGH2RY,"I watched this series growing up and I was sad when the series came to an end, however I am happy that the series came to DvD AND all in one set at that. Yes it is a bit pricey, however I rather pay one price than buy all 15 seasons individually.
Anyways, the set arrived safely and on time and no damage. All seasons and disks were there and they play excellently on my blu ray players and PS4.",1458259200,6,395,3.95
6016327,3,B00FOGH2RY,I would give it a 5 stars because I loved this show growing up. The only complaint wheni got this is that the 1st disk of season 4 would not work in my ps4 or my blu ray.,1456790400,,170,3.5
