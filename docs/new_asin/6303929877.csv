8221130,3,6303929877,"This was produced by the dubious Chris Harris and Dean DeLorean for Harris-Delorean Productions. See the Rip Off Report website on these two. It's interesting reading. This item features The Los Angeles Raiderette Cheerleaders in a workout video that is supposed to inform women about the game of football while working out. The girls, set design, music and production value are high. However, It was a bad idea, poorly written, poorly edited and the directing is non-existent. The names of the cheerleaders and crew are misspelled in titles. That's hysterical. It features Bob Golic, who comes across as a clown. However the late Bob Chandler, was always a class act. R.I.P. Overall... The girls are beautiful, costuming is good, lighting is great, the exercises are good, it's well shot and edited well (except for the opening and end credits). The ""educational"" portions are laughable and the stock NFL footage looks awful. I recommend it if you're a Raider or Raiderette fan. I would also recommend it to NFL collectors. But it is as cheesy as Chris Harris and Dean Delorean.",1317859200,,1079,5.0
