7741117,1,B01EXBC9PU,I had not seen either DVD so I was looking forward to seeing them. The Slave Trade DVD was damaged and I exchanged it. The same DVD was damaged on the replacement. I am returning this. It is a waste of time. I am disappointed.,1469491200,8,226,4.044444444444444
7741118,5,B01EXBC9PU,"This actually is a very good 2 x DVD set. The film about Prince's take, effects and futuristic vision about the musi industry  is the best documentnary ive ever seen about the man,.",1469232000,,181,4.484848484848484
7741119,2,B01EXBC9PU,"Very Disappointed. I was hoping it would have some of Prince's performances, but it was all documentary.. which was not mentioned in the advertisement.. Basically everything was already on TV..and I have it recorded. If you have watched all the documentaries about Prince On TV, then you have seen everything that was on this set.",1468627200,16,330,5.0181818181818185
7741120,1,B01EXBC9PU,"As stated before this is just a repackaging of the DVDs ""Slave Trade"" and ""The Glory Years"". Would of been nice to know. Because of this it gets one star. The content is good, if you don't already own them.",1468540800,17,206,4.175

7741122,1,B01EXBC9PU,"Amazon, this is coming back to you! This is The Glory Years & Slave Trade repackaged! This should've been mentioned in the product description!",1468108800,9,143,5.0
7741123,3,B01EXBC9PU,Not for a casual fan unless you are looking for a Prince history/documentary. First disc is somewhat newer material in bits and pieces and gives a Prince history and documents the record company fight with Warner Brothers the slave era and the name change to a symbol.  The second disc is an album history with comments from the same individuals as the first disc most of which is available on YouTube. Music clips/samples but not much else to make it noteworthy,1468022400,13,462,4.703703703703703
7741124,1,B01EXBC9PU,"If I could give 0 stars I would!!! This is just repackaging of ""Slave Trade"" and ""The Glory Years"" so if you already own those, which I do twice over because of other repackaging into the Prince DVD Collectors Box. I bought those DVD's individually and now in 2 different box sets! VERY UPSET & UNPLEASED!!!",1468022400,32,307,4.5

8759729,1,B01EXBC9PU,"Very disappointed with this purchase. First of all I am a diehard Prince fan and I absolutely love Prince. It hurts me to give anything about him 1 star.  But number 1 my set is defective and the disc 1 audio is unintelligible, disc 2 was perfect. Contacted Amazon regarding a replacement and was told this purchase.was not eligible for return or exchange. But this set is nothing new just repackaged and renamed. Once again very disappointing.",1473552000,2,444,4.766233766233766

8759732,5,B01EXBC9PU,"I cried when Prince died.  Truly loved this magical and gifted artist.  To bad though that they (Amazon?) just threw together two CDs that were previously released and call it something new!  Still, this is a great set for my Prince collection.  For those that have not seen or purchased the other two CDs as mentioned in other reviews, you will want this set to enjoy.",1471046400,6,369,4.545454545454546
