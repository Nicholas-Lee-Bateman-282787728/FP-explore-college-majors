1211290,5,B00000FDZ9,"This is a magnificent and moving film that is, arguably, the best film about the Vietnam War and its consequences without its locale being that actual country.  Actually, this is a movie about all wars,those both personal and political. It is also the best depiction of post traumatic stress disorder I have ever seen in a movie.  The script and direction by the very individualistic Henry Jaglom are terrific - but it is the late, great Dennis Hopper who truly makes the film unforgettable.  His performance is outstanding; perhaps the best of his long and storied career.  Don't miss this one!

P.S.  The Hopper character is hardly ever without his cassette player playing all the songs he loves.  Two years later another offbeat character appeared in another must-see film - ""Fingers"" - where the main character played by Harvey Keitel is also hardly ever without his cassette-playing companion.  Did James Toback, also this film's writer and director, draw an influence from ""Tracks""?  Perhaps.  Either way, they are both films that should not be missed.",1279065600,5,1058,5.028735632183908
1211291,2,B00000FDZ9,Wacko Dennis Hopper is in his full drugged out period when he made this movie. It is a train movie and Hopper is a PTSD combat vet coming home from Viet Nam to escort his dead buddies coffin to the funeral. He meets a colorful and very weird cast of charactes and of course he fits right in cause he is nuts and basically plays Dennis Hopper... which he normally does. This is not a great movie and I am not even sure a good one. But it is kind of interesting and if you are a fan of Hoppers give it a peak.,1225497600,,507,3.8846153846153846
1211292,5,B00000FDZ9,"Henry Jaglom's 'Tracks', is a beautifully constructed film, that, deals with the power of memory and the tragedy of War.

Without a doubt,  the fiery, fantastic acting talent, that is, Dennis Hopper, struts his stuff so close to the bone, that one is drawn in so personally, that, the pain of his situation, becomes, almost unbearable to watch.

Unbearable to watch, but, one invariably does and keeps up with him to the shattering, unexpected climax.

I first saw this film, featured on a  program, hosted by the filmmaker, Alex Cox(Sid and Nancy), on BBC London, quite a few years' ago.

It quite literally, blew my mind away!

Never, had I quite seen before, a filmmaker, who, bluntly criticised the horror of Vietnam and presented it in such a direct, straightforward manner.

The supporting cast, including, the splendid Dean Stockwell, is admirable indeed!

Filmed on location, it features, almost all the scenes,aboard several trains.

Apparently, Jaglom, failed to get initial permission, from the powers that be, to film, aboard the locomotives, the consequences of which, the cast and crew, were booted off, train after train.

Congratulations, all around, that, the movie managed to get finished at all!

Praise be to God it did!

I reinterate and reiterate, a splendid, masterful film, with an outstanding central performance from Mr. Hopper.

Miss this film at your peril!",1163894400,8,1385,5.125
1211293,4,B00000FDZ9,"This movie has got more great Dennis Hopper scenes than any 10 of his latest roles. You've got Dennis Hopper carrying his radio around looking paranoid, you've got Dennis Hopper walking through a train stark naked, you've got Dennis Hopper leaping out of a grave, wrapped in bullets with a machine gun after going on a tirade, ""I hate and I hate!"" This is one fantastic film. It has cameos from some great character actors as well--there's Harry Northup (Doughboy in Taxi Driver), and  Richard Romanus (Michael in Mean Streets). As if that's not enough, you've got the always entertaining Dean Stockwell as a man on the run. A fine film indeed.
I rated the film out of 4 stars, not 5. Four stars is the generally accepted rating for films.",1080086400,,739,4.641221374045801
1211294,4,B00000FDZ9,"For some reason this has been a staple of late-night BBC2 arthouse cinema nights for a few years. It's a very strange film indeed, directed on a budget of five pence by Henry Jaglom, who is a close to being John Cassavetes as it is possible to be without actually sharing his genetic material. Essentially, most of the film consist of Hopper and associated oddballs talking to each other on board a train which is ferrying the coffin of Hopper's deceased Vietnam war buddy (this film predated 'Coming Home', and the subsequent wave of angsty Vietnam war movies).
As you might expect it's not a conventional Hollywood movie. The strengths are in the acting (Hopper's performance is unusually restrained) and the David Lynchian conglomeration of odd events, most of which appear to be hallucinations suffered by the main character. The ending seems to be a bizarre foreshadowing of 'Rambo', and there's an odd collection of anti-Japanese WW2 propaganda songs on the soundtrack.
It's quite charming in an experimental-film-from-the-70s way, and works best when watched on a black and white television at half-past-two in the morning. Hopefully it will be released on DVD at some point - Jaglom is still around, although obscure as ever. Don't think from the cover that it's an action film, though.",1014508800,4,1294,5.023255813953488
1211295,3,B00000FDZ9,"9. TRACKS (drama, 1975) Jack (Dennis Hopper) is an ex-Vietnam veteran escorting the coffin of his dead friend's body, which is to be buried in their hometown. They travel by train, where Jack meets various interesting  people.
Critique: Actor Dennis Hopper has said that one of his main  influences in acting was James Dean (""he was pure gold man""). He  worked with Dean in his first film, the quintessential-classic Rebel  Without a Cause (1955) and in his second film Giant (1956). Dean's  mannerist style, irreverent mumbling and magnetic charisma made him into an  overnight legend never before seen...and then there was Dennis Hopper.  Though at first I saw Hopper as one of Dean's many clones, he has evolved  into a surprisingly charismatic presence, full of his own style of anger  and psychosis. One can see that early on he was very much influenced by  Dean's untimely (or timely) death in '55. His brief marriage to the  daughter of a Hollywood 'mogul' producer ended in him being blacklisted for  his bad boy streak. Through the 60s and 70s he drifted in and out of  Hollywood, spending most of his time in Europe (playing the ""ugly  American"" parts). His experiments with drugs and alcohol landed him  with his best financial triumph in Easy Rider (1968). But that was all. He  again disappeared into obscurity and fell further into disfavor with the  ""Hollywood people"".  His career has resurfaced of late,  however, giving a tour-de-force performance in David Lynch's controversial  Blue Velvet (1985), and as a director with the influential Colors (1988).  Though I still admire his maniacal Frank Booth in Blue Velvet (thus,  typecasting him in 'psycho' roles), I rather like him in Tracks. He  displays great depth (most of the film's dialogue is improvised),  passionate mood swings, and a sense of reality (it could well be Hopper  himself we see on screen trying to exorcise his inner demons). Director  Henry Jaglom's claustrophobic camerawork, angst written screenplay and  fallible pacing serves Hopper perfectly (the non-conformist). Hopper's Jack  describes himself as being shy but is, in truth, a disturbed little soul.  Lapsing into frequent, uncontrollable fits, awkward in describing himself,  and overwhelmed with his longing for his childhood days (the film's score  works perfectly on the same wavelength). This is his most accomplished role  yet.
QUOTE: Jack: ""Do you think about your childhood often? I think  about mine. When the going gets rough,  I think about my childhood.'",917913600,2,2514,5.141089108910891
7908215,4,B00000FDZ9,"Hopper was great - the Ervin Johnson of actors, bringing everyone around up to his level.
My reference to climate of the time involved growing up a block from the Kingsbridge V.A. in the Bronx, where I sometimes sold 10c newspapers for a Quarter.  The front page of one of the last was a picture of the penultimate civilian flight out of Saigon, on which Dad was flight engineer.  He called from the deck with the DC 9's call number and said, ""We're next out"".  I relayed message and we watched them leave. The crews of his outfit had been bringing young men to and from VietNam for years.  Many thousands more came back in boxes than Uncle has ever acknowledged.

 I saw a fair number of our protagonist around New York when I was a boy.  This is as close to how I remember them as I've seen in film.  His name should not be forgotten. Thanks, guys - for standing up.",1511049600,,868,4.282208588957055
7908216,2,B00000FDZ9,"Soldier accompanies a dead soldier across the country by train during the Vietnam War. Mostly  dialogue with weird, complicated action. Awkward conversations, very 70s presentation. Even though he serves as an honor guard for a dead soldier on a cross-country train trip, psychologically tortured Dennis Hopper pathetically pursues a teenage girl on the train. Even though the girl (Taryn Power) is pretty, it is no reason to watch this dud. With constant rumbling of the train, audio is poor in this film, also. Skip it.",1466121600,,521,5.129411764705883
7908217,5,B00000FDZ9,I watched it a second time the same day just because the trip was so interesting!,1433116800,,81,4.125

7908219,3,B00000FDZ9,"I am a Vietnam War Combat Veteran who was recently awarded disability for PTSD by the Barack Obama  Veterans Administration. This is IMHO as good a movie ""about"" our Vietnam War veterans as you who suffered there will ever likely see - or BE IN. It is rated ""R"" for every reason you can imagine. Take your seat as an observer and get to know the passengers. Get into the head of the protagonist: an E9 played to the hilt by Dennis Hopper - three years before APOCALYPSE NOW was made. The War is apparently winding down during the course of this film; and the toll of the war gradually rings out as the train nears the town where a coffin must be delivered. You may be as was I moved to pray at its conclusion the Lord's prayer - in particular the phrase "" ... DELIVER US FROM EVIL ... """,1427500800,,786,4.171052631578948

7908221,2,B00000FDZ9,Pretty slow.  Pretty wierd.  Definitely a Dennis Hopper flick.  Enjoyed seeing older passenger trains.,1410393600,,102,6.142857142857143
7908222,3,B00000FDZ9,"Hmmmm.  I do like outside the box creations, but this may be too weird for me.  The main character's inner fears, fantasies and outright hallucinations surely gave a sense of his experience, but it was an overwhelming one for me.  Even putting this film in the context of the War In Vietnam and looking back on all of the craziness that entailed, this was a difficult watch.  Sadly, with minor changes it could have been made about our current involvement in the Middle East.  A challenging movie.",1408492800,,497,4.666666666666667
7908223,5,B00000FDZ9,"Henry Jaglom directed TRACKS, that stars Dennis Hopper, Dean Stockwell and Taryn Power, Tyrone's daughter. Jaglom actually filmed this on a train, without proper permission, and it worked. I am glad to see one of Dennis's earlier films and he was good. It should be a cult film today. A very good transfer and the DVD does justice to the movie. And it is one of the first films to show an actor fully nude, Dennis, nude running down the aisle of the real train.

Jan-Michael Vincent was the first male to go nude, (BUSTER AND BILLIE), and it isn't on DVD and it is a damned good movie too. Wake up Warner Bros. Or was it Columbia.?",1351382400,,631,4.3474576271186445
7908224,5,B00000FDZ9,"The movie has a number of merits.  Dennis Hopper  is  free of many of the cliches of  other performances.  The subject of the effects of war  are presented without histrionics.  The gap between  the experiences of  soldiers  and the American public is powerfully presented.  The  effect of using people to be soldiers without any appreciation of the costs to them are also well presented.  The ways reality change the mind is well presented as it is in most of Henry Jaglom's films.  When people talk or write about vietnam era films, it is seldom mentioned and that is a shame.",1346198400,2,578,4.65
