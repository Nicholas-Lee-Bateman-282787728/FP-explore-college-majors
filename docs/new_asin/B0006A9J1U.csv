It's a made-for tv movie, so I didn't expect much out of it, but it's pretty funny to laugh at.",1284336000,2,263,4.076923076923077

Seriously I didn't think it would be cool since its made for little  kids but it was awesome. Im 18 years old and I think it was totally  hella tight, the tricks Zolar and the gang would pull off on there skate boards were awesome!!!, and the action scenes were totally sick!!

Bottom line, this movie was PANDEMONIUM 2005, YALL!!!!!!

You gotta check this out, ferizzle!!!!",1105920000,5,445,4.444444444444445
