8549591,4,B001CQS7SI,"Jerry Mulligan (Gene Kelly) ex-GI stays in Paris to practice painting. There he is patronized by a jealous Milo Roberts (Nina Foch). Mean time he is trying to make time with a store clerk that is more than she appears to be (Leslie Caron).

Not one of Kelly's best but passable. However even at his best, one has to have a taste for that sort of thing. He is sort of a Danny Kay type. His high-water-pants are his signature and really looks out of place. He cannot sing worth beans. However, he did do a good job in ""What a Way to Go.""

Even though this film is not a notable movie Vincente Minnelli, (1903-1986) directed it. He directed some great movies and some that you would never suspect such as ""The Long Long Trailer.""",1497484800,,726,4.330882352941177
