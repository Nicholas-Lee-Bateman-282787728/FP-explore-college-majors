5635704,4,B00BK86S4I,"I've loved westerns ever since I was a kid. Many a good times were spent with my Grandfather watching westerns. From the classic John Ford movies to the series that were on t.v. in the sixties such as The Virginian, Bonanza, and Gunsmoke. Even the spaghetti westerns of the sixties and seventies, loved them. Sure there were at times scenes that were abit, what can I say, over the top but as long as there was a good story that really told a tale with a western flare then it was all good. This movie has it ALL. It has a great story, western flare galore. Ed Harris should get an Oscar with his performance. It was amazing! If I lived in the ""western days"" his character is whom I would like to be like. No spoilers here, just WATCH this great western, you will not be disappointed.",1381708800,5,784,4.304054054054054
5635705,5,B00BK86S4I,"January Jones does herself proud with this hard hitting revenge flick!  I've never seen Ed Harris in a film where he looks like he's having such a good time. I hope ""Sweetwater"" gets a theatrical release.  It definitely deserves it.",1381449600,39,232,4.775

5635709,1,B00BK86S4I,"I got this movie, mainly because of a being a fan of Ed Harris,  and western in general. I cant understand how it got any good reviews. It's  right up there with the Hateful Eight as one of the worst movies ever! The was no point to it, the characters were so shallow they could of been left out. Why can't they make a good western anymore? Yes, I'm a fan of the old John Wayne's,  but there have been newer ones that are good. Tombstone is great, of course it's about 20 years old. I'd rate this piece of dog crap as a minus 10.",1517356800,,529,3.9716981132075473
5635710,5,B00BK86S4I,"Spoiler alert :  This has become to me a movie to rival Ripley in Alien Series...I was sort of put off by the graphic violence and sex but I'm a grown up so I just do what anyone should do if they don't want to see something in a DVD,  I jumped the track forward.  Easy peasy...  this was a very unique story and the acting by all was superb.  If you are tired of the same old trite western story try this one.  Ed Harris character was amazing in that he was the first old west lawman I ever saw who was in to forensics (at least portrayed on the screen)  You don't often get to view any story that has a woman protagonist who triumphs!  It's a keeper.",1517011200,,652,3.9615384615384617
5635711,1,B00BK86S4I,"I would have given this a negative review if I could. I saw this at Sundance and wanted to leave the theater after viewing it for a very short period of time. This is a classic example of some fine actors (Ed Harris, Jason Isaacs, Stephen Root) not being able to salvage this ""film"" because the script was so bad, the direction was sophomoric, and the labyrinthine, nonsensical story has unnecessary murder/sex scenes to enhance what little there was to enhance. Question marks are floating above my head as to why anyone found this good enough to give it 4 or 5 stars. The mind boggles. Don't waste your money.",1514764800,,611,4.5636363636363635

5635732,5,B00BK86S4I,"The beginning was lame until Ed Harris really turned it up.  January's plight seemed so bleak and just made you want to cry.
Then Ed Harris sauntered into the Sheriff's office and hope was reborn.  I loved how he fired the sheriff, what he did with the knife,
and the whole performance.  And, January, she can take care of herself.  It is a great movie on religious hypocrisies and cleaning up
a corrupt cult.",1486684800,,409,4.486486486486487

5635795,3,B00BK86S4I,"Possibly Jason Isaacs was a little too intense and unbelievable in his role.  But, he did make you hate him so that's good. Otherwise, Ed Harris was fantastic.  The movie is worth watching for him alone.  Seems that some reviewers felt that January Jones was too flat and lifeless in this movie.  I can see that, yet my point of view is that she was a prostitute before marrying Miguel, therefore she was probably a tough woman who had possibly been cried out over the years.  I bought her portrayal of Sarah.  I also liked that Ed Harris, in his role as Sheriff Jackson, seemed to really be pissed that two young men, decent guys really,  had been wronged (killed).  Overall I'm glad I watched this movie.  Not a classic, but enough bad people get taught lessons, that it was fun.  Again, Ed Harris...an amazing performance.",1452643200,,825,4.589041095890411

5635813,4,B00BK86S4I,"We watched this movie not knowing anything about it.  It was very good and we enjoyed it.

Ed Harris made this role look easy and fun.

It reminds me of what religion is about today - money and not being held accountable for their actions.  They feel they can do anything they want and they have the right because they are ""leaders"" of God.

5635814,1,B00BK86S4I,"Man, I know westerns follow the same trope but I am so sick of the revenge plot in these westerns. Can't filmmakers be more creative? Sweetwater is yet another film about revenge but it's a very bad one. The movie doesn't seem to have any focus and seems just thrown together. The acting is lackluster and everything that happens in the film has been done so much before that it's laughable and predictable. There were no surprises or any twists in this film whatsoever. It's just another lame template used in most revenge westerns. January Jones was dry and lacked spunk, something I'd expect from a female character such as this. Jason Isaac's acting was good but not enough to rescue this pathetic film. Ed Harris was completely wasted and I don't know what possessed him to be in this poor excuse for a western.

Skip this! Nothing exciting happens and Jones shows no emotion whatsoever. She is as dry as an overcooked pork chop. If you like westerns there are many more way better than this one! Save your time and definitely save your money!",1437004800,3,1048,4.634408602150538

Set in the fading years if the 1800s New Mexico, January Jones plays Sarah Ramirez, reformed prostitute and wife of slain Miguel.  In a convoluted story, Josiah claims God wants the Ramirez ranch.  Honestly, what he wants is to have his way with Sarah.  Sarah, for some unknown reason, doesn't seem to think that is too good of a deal.

Ed Harris looked like he was having far too much fun playing the sheriff.  One might think he should have paid the producer to have gotten the role.  Speaking of that, Amy Madigan, Harris' real wife had a totally useless role/part in the movie.  There really wasn't a need for her to be there other than to appease Harris.  She leant absolutely nothing to the movie.

There's enough gun fire to keep the movie moving along and the cast dwindling at a constant clip.  For the guys, well, there's skin.  This movie starts, goes and finishes.

The revisionist western Sweetwater is basically Ms 45 re-imagined as a western.  Sarah and her Mexican husband move to town where they are promptly cheated by the local banker and Sarah is spied on while trying on a dress by a lecherous shopkeeper.  But worst of all is Josiah, a psychotic polygamist cult leader clearly inspired by Joseph Smith.  Sarah's husband is murdered by Josiah, who later cold cocks Sarah and rapes her.  It seem like January Jones' Sarah is destined to be a victim forever, but finding two of Josiah's men digging up her husband's dead body finally sends Sarah over the edge--she kills both of the men, then the banker and shopkeeper, then all of Josiah's men (and a couple of his wives) on the way to the final showdown.

Ed Harris has the flashiest role as an eccentric sheriff who plays the fool but is actually pretty sharp.  Jason Isaacs is effective but no better as the crazy Prophet Josiah--a better actor could have turned the character into a great villain--instead he's mostly functional.  January Jones doesn't have much to do but look pretty and kill people--she does well at both.

Ms 45 was a far more moral and complex film.  The killings in Sweetwater don't bear the weight of real people dying--in fact the violence is frequently played for laughs instead of something darker, making Sweetwater a pretty light-weight movie.  Still, it's entertaining for the most part, although it's hard not to wish that the filmmaker's had a little more ambition.",1412121600,,1513,4.844357976653696

The cast of eminently watchable actors (Ed Harris, Jason Isaac) persuaded me though, and Im glad I was.  This is a thoroughly surprising movie, never a pure Western and often pushing genre boundaries.  After a slow start, it really works, thanks in large part to an intermittently witty script and of course the performances.
January Jones plays a woman who endures a tragic loss, which tips her over the edge to drastic action against the source of her tragedy -  the self proclaimed Prophet Josiah, played by Jason Isaacs.  His delusional, dangerous preacher is also responsible for another couple of murders, which brings an eccentric (putting it mildly) sheriff (Ed Harris) to come investigating.  Harris is great value, genuinely unnerving in his eccentricity, skirting the line of cartoonishness while never going over it, and never letting it blunt the characters hard edge.  You feel some sympathy when Isaacs tells him Youre a really queer man, to which the sheriff replies Unusual.  I prefer unusual..  However for me it is Jason Isaacs who steals the show with his portrayal of a character who could easily have been a wafer thin characterization, but becomes fully fleshed out and endlessly watchable in Isaacs hands.  All of these means that the core of the movie  January Jones revenge driven widow, taking matters into her own hands, never quite draws us in as it should  we are more voyeurs to her story than engaged in understanding or debating her motives and actions.
Beyond the characters, the cinematography belies its straight to DVD origins  as it should, with Brad Shield on lensing duties (Moulin Rouge, Star Wars Episode 2, The Avengers).  The scenery in New Mexico is immaculately shot, and the direction by Logan Miller although slow to start, works well in creating a movie with its own distinctive hotch potch of genre styles.
All in all, I liked this  nothing new in the story, but its executed well (no pun intended) and Harris and Isaacs make it a cult classic in my book  not up there with Open Range or Seraphim Falls, but a solid 6/10.

I'm not sure why I decided to watch this financial and critical flop other than it's a Western and had an interesting cast.  January Jones, on leave from TV's ""Mad Men,"" plays a yummy former prostitute who is now married to a Mexican immigrant (Eduardo Noriega).  The couple are trying to scratch out a living as farmers on land midway between Tucumcari and Santa Fe, New Mexico.  Their farm borders a large piece of land owned by a transplanted Utah cult, (clearly meant to be Mormon-like in appearance but never identified that way) led by Prophet Josiah (Jason Isaacs).  He's a bit off his rocker.  At times he gets his religion by wallowing on the ground.  Other times he just enjoys bullying people and raping the young women in his camp.  He also has the town sheriff (Luce Rains) under his thumb.

When Miguel and Sarah (Noriega & Jones) come to complain about Josiah's sheep eating their crops, they become enemies.  Even more so after the couple tries to get the sheriff to look into their dog's death at the hands of the cult.  Entering the picture is a new sheriff called Jackson (Ed Harris), who has been appointed by the governor to replace the old one and find out about his missing son-in-law and his brother.  Harris has some of the best scenes, humorously confronting the suspected prophet who he calls Josie, clearly unafraid.

After Miguel goes missing and later discovered murdered, Sarah goes on a quiet, but determined rampage against the religious clan and their town associates (banker and general store owner played by Stephen Root and Vic Browder respectively).  The later gets an especially gruesome measure of retaliation.  In another noteworthy scene, Sarah lures a pair of the prophet's henchmen (including country music star Jason Aldean) to a river where she appears to be bathing.  When they get close enough they are surprised that she had actually be cradling a .45 between her bare breasts.

For whatever reason Harris and Jones don't share a lot of screen time.  Sarah does her revenge thing and Jackson follows up.  This isn't a very good movie, but I did find it watchable.  And who doesn't like a woman-in-the-west out for revenge?  The biggest problem would be a lame script and some uneven direction.  I suspect this was a much longer movie originally and was poorly cut.

The film is beautifully shot in dusty New Mexico and it comes across in the Blu ray transfer just fine.  It has a 1080p resolution and a wide 2.35:1 aspect ratio.  The contrast is very good as is the detail, if not of demo quality.  The audio is perfectly fine as well.  The disc comes with a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track.  The surrounds come into play during the action sequences as well as with ambient sounds, especially in the night scenes.  English SDH is the only subtitle option.  Extras include ""The Making of Sweetwater, ""Cold Grey Light of Drawn"" the song played over the closing credits, a trailer and 3 previews.",1397433600,,2964,4.732421875

Also makes it hard to tell what is motivating her revenge spree, as she really doesn't seem all that upset at any point in the film. I also felt the plot meandered for a while before getting to the meat. For such a short film, the build-up was excessive and the payoff felt rushed.

Boy glad I did, always take movie critics with a grain of salt because they were so wrong on this one.

The story line was original and something rare in westerns and had a strong female character also rare. January Jones did a great job but of course my favorite performance was by Ed Harris. He played the quirky sheriff investigating various murders committed by the villain played by Jason Isaacs who did a wonderful job. You know you have a great villain when you find them vile and repulsive. I do have to give credit to the writers however, because they had the villain do some dispicable things meriting the hate.

The actors are quite good, especially Ed Harris and Jason Isaacs.  Their characters are two insane men from very different sides of the tracks.  Their performances are riveting.  Isaacs' because of how disturbing and emotionally invested he is.  Harris' because of how he teeters on the edge of insanity and yet is a damn fine sheriff.

Let's not forget our heroine.  January Jones plays a character we have not seen her attempt, and she does her job really well.  The stoic, good-natured woman with a harsh past, making a good life in a harsh land: Jones' character loses everything, refuses to wither, and takes vengeance upon ALL those who truly deserve a nasty end.  With a quiet determination akin to Ray Stevenson's the Punisher, Jones' vigilante widow comes at the bad guys like an unyielding storm.  Very nice deaths delivered to some disgusting people.  I think I'm in love.

The cinematography is beautiful.  The setting is integrated into both wide and close shots very well, immersing you in place.  Meanwhile the characters are followed from interesting angles, especially during the action, so you are drawn into the experiences of our heroine.

This movie does a lot of things well.  For example: One thing in particular is that this movie makes each gun shot very loud, giving one a real sense of being right in the middle of the action.  If you have ever heard the sound of handgun fire up close, you will appreciate how this movie captures the sudden and jolting report of a gun.

The story is straightforward and done well.  Not too many plot twists so much as characterization twists.  We come to know our three main characters well by the end of the film.

Speaking of the end, it is a fitting and meaningful ending.  No wasted time on meaningless banter or establishment of how life will be in the days after the streak of vengeance kills.  Just a very poignant and abrupt end like one you would receive from a well-written story.

WATCH THIS.  They did an excellent job.  If you are a fan of westerns like Deadwood, 3:10 to Yuma, Young Guns--or revenge movies like the Punisher, Get Carter, I Spit On Your Grave, etc. you will enjoy this film.",1392249600,,2375,4.669082125603865

When Ed Harris' character first appears on screen it does appear to have all the ""potential"" of creating an interesting, strong central leading-character to build a late-career Western franchise around, ala' Robert DuVall (Lonesome Dove, Broken Trail, & Open Range) or Kevin Costner (Dances, Wyatt Earp & Silverado). But the character really never gets enough traction or time to shine & own the movie.
The same can be said for the actual (good guy) leading-character January Jones, whose role is that of a former common whore, who is now also a recent widow & rape victim. Ms. Jones' character's arc is limited & complete, never reaching that Sharon Stone ""cold-killer-for-life"" persona (Quick & Dead) and ending/limiting her reign of deadly vengeance with only those select few directly responsible. Period. And then...??
You really will hate the ""bad guys""...by the time they finally start to get theirs, but it's rather late in the movie & rather limited in character depth (of action). Much ado about nothing. Leaves the viewer feeling ""kinda flat"", no real flash/bang or cool-factor climax pay-off for watching.
I actually heard of this movie looking for reviews of another new Western called ""Shadow on the Mesa"", another real ""cheese-whiz special""...""Family Friendly Western"" filled with endless-talking, piano music, & weeping Cowboys.

SWEETWATER is a nicely-done noirish parody of the old spaghetti western. Plot-wise, there aren't a lot of big surprises, but it keeps your attention and incorporates steady humor without turning into a complete slapstick joke. Best of all are the very colorful cast of characters: Crazy charlatan cult leader; beautiful, now-married former prostitute who's out to settle down and lead a quiet, simple life; unstable yet nobly maverick sheriff; perverted clothier; and a whole bunch of sheep who contribute a great deal to the story (really, they do).

Now with the help of the sheriff she sets out for revenge, and you know what they say about a woman scorned. I am a huge Ed Harris fan and I like westerns but lately the genre has been in a huge nose dive so I wasn't sure what to expect from this. This is easily one of the better ones that have come out lately but it is still a little slow moving. 90% of the reason this is good is the cast. Harris is good in everything, Isaacs is the most disturbing preacher since Michael Parks played one in Red State. The gem of the movie though is January Jones. For once she isn't just the eye candy of the movie, she actually has a needed part and the fact that it is her that loses it and goes on a killing spree makes it that much more interesting. If you are a western fan this is one to watch. Don't expect something like Open Range though, this is more like Appaloosa or 3:10 To Yuma or for you real movie fiends out there, if you liked Seraphim Falls you will like this.

January Jones did a fair acting job but she didn't grab her character as did Harris and Jason Isaacs.  Jason Isaacs did a wounderful job as the ""Prophet"".
  Isaacs made the audience loath the ""Prophet"" character and Harris' potrayal of ""Sheriff Jackson"" was fun to watch.
  Jones' character ""Sarah Ramirez"", who I think is supposed to be the true main character? seemed to end up as a innocent bystander to the fall out between Sheriff Jackson and The Prophet.  Jones does get her's toward the end of the movie but Jones never seemed to play the character with any real emotion, maybe this was by design I don't know but with the anticts of Isaacs' and Harris' characters I think Jones might have upped the ante a bit.
  The plot to this movie is tried and true so I don't think there are any real surprises here?  It is violent and bloody but I believe most of it is quite inline with the plot and not in any way over done.  There are a few veiled referances to to Mormanism though nothing out right.

I was surprised to see the beginnings of crime scene investigation which doesn't usually happen in western films.  I watched it with my dad who likes to watch classic westerns and he enjoyed it as did I.",1382227200,26,340,4.296875
5635944,5,B00BK86S4I,"There have been a few new westerns of late and I am glad to see the genre getting a new lease of life, but they all ought to take a few lessons from this little gem, it was released as 'Sweet Vengeance' in the UK for some reason. Ed Harris plays Sherriff Cornelius Jackson a frontier lawman who is out to investigate why two of his relations didn't show up for an intended rendezvous. He figures they had to have gone missing in a part of the country that is under the control of what appears to be a slightly lunatic `Prophet' who is tantalisingly evil - played by Jason Isaacs.

We also have January Jones (Sarah Ramirez)who is newly wed to a Mexican farmer and they are trying to carve a living from the sun parched land surrounded by the sheep of Prophet Josiah. Meantime's he wants to take over their land and or convert them to be part of his fledgling flock. He is not a man for compromises and cynically uses selective quotes from the Bible in order to justify his extreme actions and views, which would probably not even be politically correct even at the time this film is set. Needless to say he is a nasty piece of work and decides he will dish out some good old fashioned justice on behalf of the almighty, whilst maintaining a harem of `God fearing' girls.

Every action has a reaction and for him it comes in the unwanted attention of both Sherriff Jackson and Mrs Ramirez who decide to get some frontier justice of their own. What follows is a brilliant story that grabs you from the off and just does not let up. There is action, humour, potty mouth cussing a plenty and some virtuoso performances from all the main players. I am a fan of Ed Harris and he never fails to put in stunning performances and some of that magic must have rubbed off as not a second of screen time seems to be wasted. Some credit must to go to director Logan Miller as this is beautifully shot too and the pacing is nigh on perfect.

Some have criticised it for being simplistic but I have to aver that this was rollicking great fun all the way. This is one of those films where you want to award more than five stars as it is simply that good. If this is the future for westerns then their continued popularity is undoubtedly assured.",1382227200,80,2229,4.315035799522673
