6355335,4,B00JDSDQ4M,"""Grigris"" (2013 release from Chad; 101 min.) brings the story of Souleymane, whom everyone called Grigris, a 20-something yr. old with a crippled left leg who nevertheless is the dance sensation at the local dance club. The movie opens with Grigirs being the center of attention as he busts a move while the music is playing. When he's not dancing, he is trying to get by as best he can in his day-to-day life, trying to also take care of his mom and ailing stepdad. By coincidence he gets to know Mimi, a beautiful woman whom we quickly learn who makes a living ""being everyone's girl"". Meanwhile Grigris is desperate to make some money, so eventually gets involved in a gas-smuggling ring. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this movie comes out of Chad. Who could've imagined that there is a movie-making scene in faraway Chad, and that they are capable of bringing us such a wonderful, complex human drama. The movie is written and directed by  Mahamat-Saleh Haroun, who previously brought us ""The Screaming Man"" (also a Film Movement release). Second, the Souleymane character is a real life character, whom the director discovered at a show a few years back (check out the enlightening director's notes on the DVD inner jacket). Third, the movie provides a glimpse of what day-to-day life is like in a remote country like Chad, both in the big city and in remote villages. Last but certainly not least, the lead performances by Souleymane Dm as Grigris and Anas Monory  as Mimi are top-notch. Ths movie premiered to critical acclaim at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival. I am very happy that Film Movement has released it in the US. Bottom line: this is a little gem of a movie that is light years away from your standard Hollywood fare.

This movie was the April, 2014 release in the on-going series of Film Movement's DVD-of-the-Month Club of foreign and indie movies, and it will be released to the public at large in September, 2014. As usual, the DVD comes with a bonus (and unrelated) shortie, this time ""Feral"", an animated shortie (11 min.) that was nominated for this year's Oscar for Best Animated Short, and equally worth checking out. ""Grigris"" is another worthy addition to the ever-growing Film Movement library. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1397865600,2,2347,4.801980198019802

8650049,5,B00JDSDQ4M,"One of the best productions out of Africa!  Depicts the everyday struggle of the ordinary person living in Africa and what they have to do to overcome the odds. Family, passions, crime, betrayal, love, and compassion for those society has condemned.

The cinematography was top 3 I've ever seen come of Africa! The directing was flawless! The acting was unexpectedly great! The storyline is unbeatable!  They used the best and latest equipment for this productions; they clearly mastered the act of filming in the dark; something that productions in Nigerian films that I usually watch struggle with.

i hope to see more from this director!",1522540800,,640,5.066666666666666
8650050,3,B00JDSDQ4M,"This Chadian film stars a semi-disabled man which is not something you see very often in Hollywood films.  He is trying to live his life as best he can, but encounters a financial crisis with his father's health that makes him resort to a dangerous series of increasingly risky efforts to raise money illegally,.  The casting was excellent as all the character's made it feel like a real story inhabited by real people and not stereotypes.  The visuals are excellent at bringing a Sub-Sahrian African slice of life story to the screen.

VAGUE SPOILER:  This Chadian film doesn't have a typical Hollywood ending but it also doesn't have a typical dour foreign film ending either.  And I appreciate that.  We watch a lot of foreign films and too often they think they only ending is the worst possible outcome for everyone involved.",1516579200,,830,4.802816901408451

8650054,5,B00JDSDQ4M,"This is the first film that I have watched about life in Chad and I am glad I did. What saddened me was the poor state of the economy where the only option to make a quick buck was to resort to smuggling or prostitution. Impressive dancing and acting by the lead pair, but what impressed me most of all was the last scene where the village women in unison handle the crisis efficiently without resorting to shrieks or histrionics and notably without the support of men. Being a woman myself I appreciated the idea of female empowerment, it reminded me a little of the ending in 'Fried Green Tomatoes.'",1412121600,,601,4.472727272727273
8650055,4,B00JDSDQ4M,"This is what I love about Film Movement - the opportunity to watch critically acclaimed films that I would not have discovered on my own. Grigris is a 2013 Cannes Film Selection, from Chad director Mahamat-Saleh Haroun.

 Grigris loves to dance, despite having a disabled leg. He works with his stepfather, but earns extra money dancing at the local club. It is at the club that he meets and falls in love with Mimi, a prostitute. When his stepfather falls ill, Grigris needs to earn extra money to pay the hospital. And so he turns to a local criminal for a job. Despite his good intentions, Grigris runs afoul of this man and he and Mimi are in grave danger....

 I was fascinated to read how Souleymane Dm ended up playing the part of Grisgris. Haroun saw Dm dancing in his country of Burkina Faso and hired him for his film. While an accomplished dancer this is Dm's first film role. Mimi is played by Anas Monory and this is her film debut as well. I though both actors did a great job. I was absolutely astounded by Dm's dance moves - he is an amazing dancer. But Haroun does not make the film about Grigris's disability, instead it is about controlling your destiny. Our hearts and hopes are with Grigris and Mimi as they struggle to find a life for themselves. And isn't that what any of us wants?

 I loved the setting - seeing a country I knew nothing about - from both a city and a rural point of view. The soundtrack was fitting, from both the club music to the background sounds. There are parts of this film that are difficult to watch - there is some violence, but the level of poverty is just as difficult to watch. But there is joy as well - I think my favourite part is the village and the women who live there. There are a few slow scenes where the camera could have moved on fifteen seconds earlier, but I really enjoyed this film.

 As always, there is a short included. This time it's a monochromatic animated film called Feral, an Academy Award Nominee. The story is a familiar one - a feral child found in the woods.",1409270400,,2040,4.35
8650056,4,B00JDSDQ4M,"African writer/director Mahamat-Saleh Haroun has created a drama based on a gifted dancer Souleymane Dm and has captured so much atmosphere of the world of Chad that his drama is truly a work of art. The lighting, the music, the actors - all the `props' of a film are excellent and the story is deeply moving.

Grigris is a quiet gifted dancer who suffers form a malformed withered left leg, yet in spite of his deformity he enhances his income by dancing in the clubs at night: the exuberant crowd places money in this clothes and his hat in response to the exceptional dancing the man performs. His day job is working for his stepfather, Ayoub, in Ayoub's shop that offers a variety of services from tailoring to photography. And in the photography aspect of his work he meets Mimi who wants some photographs for her `modeling job' (Mimi is a prostitute.) Grigris falls in love, but when Ayoub falls critically ill Grigris must make more money to pay the hospital bills. He is sucked into being a transporter of petrol for the black market.  Things do not go well for Grigris and after some unfortunate events Grigris and Mimi must escape and in doing so confront their private demons in hopes of creating a new life.

The story is solid if a bit plodding at times, but the brilliance of Souleymane Dm's dancing alone makes the film stunning. There are many subtle and not so subtle metaphors about the current state of African nations that will touch the hearts of those fortunate enough to see this fine film. It is a plea of humanity on every level. Grady Harp, August 14",1408233600,,1576,4.581560283687943
8650057,4,B00JDSDQ4M,"Grigris is a film from Chad. It is in French with English subtitles.  Basically it tells the story of Soulemayne or Grigris, a young man with an injured leg who nevertheless aspires to become a great dancer.  As the film begins we see him already well on the way to accomplishing his dream as he performs to an admiring crowd in a club.  But Grigris has many problems, including the need to care for his ailing parents, but most particularly his friendship for a young woman named Mimi.  Mimi has troubles of her own stemming from her life as a prostitute, but she and Grigris are determined to make a life together.  Unfortunately, the need to earn money forces Grigris into smuggling oil, and this leads  to some fateful consequences.

This film is set in a country about which most people know little. The landscape and scenery are very beautiful and the cast is appealing.  The issues the characters face are in many ways similar to those dealt with by people fortunate enough to live in other parts of the world.  While the world Grigris and Mimi inhabit may seem very different from that most people who will see this film inhabit, I believe that many of us will recognize some parallels with our own lives.",1406505600,,1213,4.578703703703703
