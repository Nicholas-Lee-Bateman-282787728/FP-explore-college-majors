787070,5,6304111762,"...and I have seen a few ;) This is definitely a beatifully told and enthralling story, that goes far beyond the usual lesbian-chic erotica.  The setting and especially the soundtrack give you the feeling of being  drawn into a time and place as far removed from ours as the stories Camille  teaches and the depth of plot does not let you off as easily as most other  movies I have seen - you don't know how it will turn out, you don't know if  it will end well, and for a long time you don't even know how you want it  to end.  I head to re-watch it three times the night I rented it before I  could make myself turn the TV off.  Without a doubt *the* best movie I have  ever seen.

787420,5,6304111762,"I think lesbian movies have come a long way: In nearly all of cinema, one of the women usually came to a sticky end to somehow prove a ""moral"" point to viewers. This film is right up there in quality with ""Blue Is the Warmest Color"" in filming, character development, and dialogue, and did not rely on stereotypes to tell the story. Case in point: The character of Camille did not seem ""uptight"" to me, as written in the synopsis; inside her, she was already yearning for a different life, whether it was with Petra or not. This was apparent in her eagerness to wear what she wore to the dean's meeting at the very beginning, and how playful she was about it. The two women's sex was beautiful, tender, and human. This is a must-see not only in lesbian film, but in any genre.",1496016000,10,776,4.358620689655172

But this film deeply affected me because all of the characters are good, decent people, men and women who are trying their best to do their best. But in life, as I must imagine the same is true for each of us, things happen. The road curves to the right. Uh-oh, I really wanted to go left. What the hell is happening here? I'm lost...and I thought I was doing so well. But Life is a curvy road. My dad used to often say to both of us, ""When we get up each morning, we never know what's waiting around the bend. How true. There is no way Camille could possibly have anticipated what would evolve from that chance with Petra, as they both performed such a mundane, unimpressive act as washing one's clothes.  But this mere encounter changed the lives of several people. For the better?  For worse? Who knows. John Newland would have said all these characters chose to leave the road ahead of them and take...One Step Beyond! Silly me. Nonetheless, this is a five star offering, one which decidedly, puts off to the side what sexual proclivities we may personally have chosen.

787505,5,6304111762,"I didn't watched a lot of lesbian movies maybe this is my second one.
But I can say this is very artistic and is far from cheap erotic movie at all.
The director is a female and she didn't showed nudity because she wanted to please the audience's eyes just like other male directors because they wanted to pull their attention for them to come to the theater or make them buy the dvd or rent the movie.

She only show bed scene if really needed and in a very artistic way.
I would call the bed scene as a pure work of art.
Once with a male and maybe 2-3 times female-female (Pascale Bussires and Rachael Crawford).

Racheael Crawford is a lesbian who is working for this circus and she happens to meet Pascale at the cpin laundry. Pascale was in a bad shape, she was kind of sick- and she helped her do the laundry and she felt in love righ away. To make possible to meet her again, she exchanged some of the laundry along with her busiess card inserted into her laudry bag.
They meet again that way.
Pascale Bussires strongly avoids when Rachael approaches as a lover at the beginning. She was a streight woman at all and for her she was so different.
But in one way, she got her attention.
Little by little she opens her mind and finally she make love with her.

And one day when Pascale's boyfriend went on a business trip and came back, he traces her to the circus place where she was with Rachael all she being all naked with Rahael, he was shocked.
They were just great. There was nothing wrong with the relationship between her and the boyfriend.

The stoy seems pretty cliche but if you see the movie you will feel that the director made it look totally new and fresh by making the moody lights and soft music and great looking acress Pascale.
As every lesbian girls, man usually doesn't like man part lesbian that much you know so did I didn't liked Rachael that much.
She did looked and acted more like a male. I don't mean she looks like a man or she is ugly or anything but you will feel something masculine from her.

Both acresses have great shape and theire bodies are work of art as if seeing some kind of wonderful picture. And that owe a lot from tecnique worked by the director and the cinematographer I guess.

Above all this is not a thriller or pure erotic movie or even softcore.
It's a love story between two women.

If you are a man or a woman you will enjoy watching this movie because it's beautifully shot and the acting is good.",1463097600,,2457,4.282327586206897

Rozema, Crawford, and Bussieres combine their talents and their skills and their sensitivities to make one of the...no, the most moving portrayal of falling in love I can think of.

A circus woman meets her female lovebird, a crying college professor in a Laundromat.  She cries for the loss of her pet dog.  This movie tells viewers that she tends to leave her middle aged boy friend.  Of course, her decision cannot be final without the aggressive approach from her
new playmate.  Take the time to enjoy it as a love story in gay relationship.

Circumstances and society make it nearly impossible for them to even be seen together, let alone, explore where these feelings might lead. Even they, themselves, don't completely understand this strange attraction that they find out is on a very deep level that cannot be seen from the outside. Even though they both realize that they don't know exactly where this can posssibly go (especially one of them), it is interesting to see how they both deal with the many obstacles they face. They learn much from and about each other and the attraction becomes stronger and stronger. They must see where this leads!

But what's great about this movie for me is the overall cinematography. Every scene is so deliberate, from Bob's (the dog) death in the alley to Petra's ""Dance with Irons."" There's not one wasted second of film.

There's so many cool touches - like the trapeze artists (the Steben Twins from Cirque du Soleil), and Camille's explaining Greek Mythology to her Calvinist classroom. I loved that the kissing scene in Camille's hallway didn't have a soundtrack... it was set to pure silence, yet it was breathtakingly perfect.

The movie also contains one of my favorite quotes - I've always said it in my head when anyone gave me crap for being gay:

Petra: ""Aren't you cute?... If you can't handle a little fun here, what are you going to do when the really mean [expletives] of the world start laughing at you?""

It's helped me keep my head when otherwise I might have been baited into confrontation.

788137,4,6304111762,"Camille Baker (Pascale Bussires), a professor of mythology at a Christian college, is about to start down a conservative path with fianc and fellow professor Martin (Henry Czerny). After she meets sexy and charming circus performer Petra (Rachael Crawford), she begins to question her current relationship.

When a mix-up at the Laundromat leads Camille to a warehouse where Petra and her fellow circus performers are practicing, Camille is fascinated by the freedom of their lives. Camille initially resists Petra's advances, but eventually she is overcome by her attraction to her. With an unsure future ahead, Camille must choose between the life she knows and the woman she has fallen in love with.

In this Canadian film, director/writer Patricia Rozema (I've Heard the Mermaids Singing) plays with the clash between an ultra-conservative school with its strict beliefs and the decadent, fun-loving life of circus performers. A sensual portrayal of the women's courtship is woven through a backdrop of lush colour and carnival atmosphere.

Pascale Bussires is wonderful as Camille, straining against the bonds of conservatism. Rachael Crawford is equally amazing as Petra, Camille's polar opposite. The women's love scenes sizzle on the screen as Camille's erotic journey begins.

788143,2,6304111762,"I don't understand how this film has garnered so many five-star reviews and is considered to be one of the ""best"" lesbian films out there. My main gripe is that as visually beautiful this film is, more was spent on aesthetics than on an actual plot and character development.

There was never a sense of urgency or danger. Okay, so we get that the main character (Cecille) is in a relationship with another man and lives a very conservative lifestyle and career, but there was so little spent on their relationship and so little spent on the background of her ""conservative"" life that I never felt that connected or emotionally invested in it. When she does start being involved with another woman (Petra), I still didn't feel that there was any tension or conflict other than Cecile's flakiness and blatant rudeness to her. Though their connection was beautifully conveyed, I still didn't really understand why Petra was soo attracted to her especially when Cecille would deliberately try and hide their relationship and even called her a ""street kid"" to the Reverend. I just didn't find it believable that Petra would still fall for this woman...after all that. As for the subplot with her dog passing away...it is indeed sad when you lose a pet since it is like losing family, but I can't honestly imagine a passing of a beloved pet being the primary reason for two people to fall in love with each other and for someone to sacrifice their current relationship and career for a lifestyle that they apparently don't fit into. It just wasn't realistic and seemed very contrived, silly, and unbelievable. And what was up with the ending? How is it possible for a dog to be dead for days/weeks in a fridge, later buried in the snow, and then just magically pops out from the ground out of the snow and running as if it was trying to return to Cecille? I get it was symbolic (or trying to anyway) but c'mon...not only cheesy but just downright stupid, honestly.

Though I admire this film's efforts at trying to create a lesbian film where it's passionate and erotic, there was virtually no plot and so little character development. I also couldn't stand the flakiness/fickleness of Cecille coming to terms with her relationship with Petra. I don't so much mind the whole conflict with her choosing between her man versus the woman she loves but why in these lesbian films does the woman have to treat her female lover so cruelly for the sake of being with a man that she isn't even in love with? And why would that female lover so willingly want to be with a woman who wants to keep their relationship a ""secret"" or who would push her aside for some jerk? I liked the circus aspect but it seemed so lacking in spark and imagination...the characters in this circus were not the least bit interesting...heck none of the characters in this movie had depth or personality. It's a shame because this film does have potential...but was so lacking some life, personality, and character...and a beautiful love story that really should have rested on its own...the boyfriend conflict was so unnecessary and didn't even add anything to the film and wasn't fleshed out enough. I think this story would have worked better if let's say instead of the dog passing away, her current boyfriend passed away instead, and Cecille starts her new life by being with a female lover and joining the circus with her. That would have made for a more interesting story but alas, that was not what the story went for.",1348531200,5,3489,4.699346405228758

It is a unique story too, done in a way I have never seen before or since. I am not a artsy person really but so many of my friends are and often I find their interests/creations/tastes  over the top for me in stretching my open mind.

788217,1,6304111762,"If one was to look at the pic on the DVD package, one would expect a passionate love story between two women who are in conflict with societal norms.  However, one would be disappointed.  Instead, the viewer is saddled with a film that strains the boundaries of viewer patience.

First, let me give you the plot. A professor at a christian university, Camille(Pascale Bussieres), is having a crisis after the death of her beloved pet dog, Bob; and this death is the catalyst for her examining her life.  Enter into the conflict a flamboyant young circus performer, Petra (Rachel Crawford), who's free-spirited ways and creepy stalker-like behaviour titillate Camille and the pair begin an affair that culminates in Camille having to choose between the comfortable, safe, and boring life she has with her boyfriend. Or the more care-free unpredictable life with Petra.

The most glaring fault of the film is that most of the focus is on creating a visually stunning film. In this, Rozema (director) succeeds.  It's in the plot details and character depictions that the film falls flat.

One of the problems is that Camille's boyfriend and the people in her more secure and traditional life are mere cardboard cutouts lacking any depth.  We don't get know them as people so we don't care about them.  And since we don't care about these characters, we don't understand the depth and breadth of Camille's conflict when she begins to consider running away with a circus performer.  Creating more defined characters with real feelings, motivations, and agendas would have made the conflict and the ultimate choice more satisfying. Especially since more time is spent on Petra's crowd of tattooed oddball associates.

Another challenge is the acting of Rachel Crawford.  Her acting style is heavy-handed and unpolished and just plain unbelievable.  This is most evident in the scene when confronts her lover, Camille, with her patronising behaviour towards the other circus entertainers.

Bussieres is the better actress, but she is given so little to work with. Her character's motivation for upending her life is the death of a dog; granted the death of pet can be painful, but I hardly think it would warrant her suddenly going round the bend and beginning a same sex affair and threatening her career and long-term relationship. If the death had been of a parent, or her longtime boyfriend, the emotional fall-out would have made more sense as grief makes us contemplate our life choices with more depth and awareness.  Even when the character begins to act out as she contemplates life outside of her comfort zone, the viewer is left wanting; Camille's idea of wild is wearing a jumper with a cutout in the chest and flashing it at her boyfriend with a mischievous smile.

It's in her character's development that we notice some of the most glaring deviations.  For example, if you work at a conservative university, would you really go to a superior to tell them that you're seriously reflecting on your sexual preference lately? Oh, come on.

Basically, the film is long on visual beauty and slight on plot and character development.  Also, the happy Hollywood ending was irritating!  Have we, as viewers, come to expect so little of our filmmakers that we accept this pallid little film as art?  It's a toddling baby step forward for Rozema, but falls quite short of true art.",1319241600,7,3378,4.953900709219858
788218,3,6304111762,"""When Night is Falling,"" produced by Patricia Rozema, and starring Pascale Bussieres and Rachael Crawford as protagonist lovers, is clearly announced, from the offset, by the lush, erotic, underwater, photographic-title sequence, to be a story about lesbian lovers.  The opening sequence, less the aqua-flow, comes to fruition through the awakenings of a woman who is steeped in the institutionalized worlds of religion and university, and who is tempted by opposing forces.  The telling of this metaphorically enhanced and visually enticing story is marred by some unlikely character actions, but despite their distractions they are forgiven as stumbles, forced by scarcity of time and budget to properly present what would in reality be a far more lengthy and complex transition process.

But, the real gem, twinkling after night has fallen, wrapped up and hidden away inside the bonus features, is a 27-minute expos on the self-torture of sacrificing everything for the passion of art, presented as a video letter to the sacrificial lamb, titled ""A Letter in 16mm,"" also produced by Rozema, starring Linda Griffiths as Anna Vogel, a documentary producer who is the moth drawn to the projector's light.

788400,4,6304111762,"This is a movie about someone who has to make an important choice in her life.

She has two souls pulling on her and wanting her to follow two very different destinies with them.

The one path offers security and convention.

The other offers excitement but many risks.

The implications of this choice become overwhelming and life threatening.

This is a sexually interesting movie because it's about a professional lady who starts to get pulled into a completely different lifestyle with someone from ""the other side of town"".

This movie is full of symbolism.  ""When night is falling"" refers to the scene where she takes a big risk and goes wind surfing (or whatever those flying things are).

Religion and the Church are there also.  The Church can sometimes become ""the enemy"" in a movie like this although I wouldn't say that happens in this movie to a great extent.  Howevever the religious figure in the movie does not understand what's going on too well.

As is often the case with good movies it pulls in philosophical and mythological ideas.

I took off one star perhaps because I wish it was more explicit.  Maybe the dvd is I don't know since I watched it on tv on the Logo channel.

Most Lesbian films are just plain bad. With the rare exception of a film like Desert Hearts, they are mindless romps by undeveloped, self-absorbed characters. They always end in the bedroom, usually to a lush musical score, because the plot literally can't go anywhere else. This film is not only a good lesbian film but a beautiful, artistically rendered chronical of a quirky relationship between two very eccentric people. The cinematography alone makes it so visually compeling that you could watch it just for that. It has a fine rhythmic pacing and a color saturation reminiscent of David Lynch. The color filled Art Circus atmosphere that surrounds one character pops as it is interspered with the staid beiges and browns that paint the academic world of the other. One scene that intercuts a car headlight dancing across a bedroom wall, a circus act that uses bouncing lights behind a screen and one of the female leads making love to her boyfriend turns editing into an artform.

The plot goes something like this: Straight woman in rather ordinary relationship with a nice enough guy. Lesbian circus performer comes after straight woman. Straight woman resists but is clearly intrigued. After a little back and forth, straight woman finally gives in and the two women ultimately fall in love.

""When Night Is Falling"" does everything a love story's supposed to do. Pascale Bussires (Camille) is tortured, lovable, and convincing. And Rachael Crawford (Petra) is honest, quirky, and absolutely mesmerizing. By the time these two women realize that they're in love, you find that you've sort of fallen in love too.

This film is not only a good lesbian film but a beautiful, artistically rendered chronical of a quirky relationship between two very eccentric people. The cinematography alone makes it so visually compelling. It has a fine rhythmic pacing and a color saturation reminiscent of David Lynch. It is so good that you could enjoy it for that alone. One scene that intercuts a car headlight dancing across a wall, a circus act that uses bouncing lights behind a screen and a man and woman making love turns editing into an artform. The really sad thing about this film is that it took so long to come out on DVD that it lost its original audience.

It's a shame that more theatres and movie rental stores wouldn't carry it, because it's a wonderful love story between these 2 women that enticed me more with each view.

She's dating an up and coming professor who is on the fast track to become dean of the school.  However, the female professor's life is forever changed when she ends up being comforted at a laundromat by a beautiful woman after her dog is killed.

Nothing is more enjoyable than to see a successful love relatioship between two women. Unfortunately, in movies (major and independents) nothing is more rare! I am so tired of self hating lesbian directors making movies about sick, twisted women behaving in self-destructive behavior!

Fortunately!!! This movie is not one!

A wonderfully acted, enjoyable LOVE STORY between a lesbian and a ""convert to lesbianism"". You might even say a convert to real love, after having a ho-hum relationship with a man- just because it's what's expected. Some of the story is kind of silly or quirky, but adds to the oddball character of the movie. American movies can be so tedious sometimes...foreign movies (especially Canadian ones), tend to take more chances and less car chases!

Be advised....the DVD version is MUCH better than the VHS copy...The love scenes are extended, and the print is tremendous and letterboxed to boot!.

The movie is funny in spots....very tender and passionate.....beautifully photographed....and the acting is first rate. One of my favorite lovestories...straight or lesbian.",1107648000,14,1334,5.298578199052133
788477,5,6304111762,"I love this movie. I can't say how many times I have seen it. It's one of my absolute favourites. Director Patricia Rozema made this a masterpiece. It has all the ingredients: Great story, beautiful cinematogrophy, thoughtful dialogue, talent, emotion, wonderful contrasts; the list goes on and on.

  So here's the plot, in no certain order: Camille (Pascale Bussires) is a Mythology teacher at New Faith College, a Christian Post-Secondary Institute. Her boyfriend, Martin (Henry Czerny), is a theologian at the same school. There is an open position for a new chaplain at the school, as the current chaplain is moving on. Camille and Martin are offered the position as a team. The position can go to a man/woman team provided their relations were not questionable, ie. provided they were married. So the school is pressuring Camille and Martin to get married so that they would not be presumed to be having sex out of wedlock. Bad Christians! They do have sex. They don't get married.

 N.B. Some lesbian viewers may not like the inclusion of a hetero sex scene, but it's very important to the story. One must pay attention to details of how she is attempting to make love to her partner and how he appears to just be screwing. (Reviewer's opinion)

  At a local laundromat, Camille meets Petra (Rachael Crawford), a performer in the modern circus, Sirkus of Sorts. Petra and Camille connect (Rachael and Pascale have chemistry!!!) and Petra performs a ""switcharoo"" with their laundry, thus prompting them to meet again.

  As the story develops, we see Camille struggling with her faith and it's conservative, anti-gay views versus her feelings for Petra. Camille is still very conservative and not used to the crass nature of the performers. My favourite dialogue is after Petra dances with Camille while other performers are cat-calling.

Camille: ""It's vulgar and crass.""

Petra: ""Wh-What? Are you ashamed of me? These are some of the nicest people, Camille. If you can't handle a little fun with them, what are you going to go when the really mean f#%^*@$ of the world start picking on you, huh? 'Cause they will, Camille. They'll be mean and they'll be laughing up a storm.""

Camille: ""Not if you show a little dignity""

Petra: ""Dignity? What could be more dignified than dancing with the woman I adore?""

  It's beautiful, really.

  Naturally, the love scene between Petra and Camille cannot go unmentioned. The chemistry between these actors is enough to project their feelings, but the twin trapeze artists provide beautiful imagery for the scene occurring below them.

  I went to St. Patrick's High School in Sarnia, Ontario, Canada. Patricia Rozema went to Lambton Christian High School, which was across the street and recently closed. We are in two very different age groups, but from the same area of town. I wish I could know her. I wish more of her recent alumni could know her. I had very in depth conversations with my religion teacher at St. Pat's and even lent her my copy of this film. She actually watched it, though she said she turned it off when Camille walked out on the chaplain and thus, ""chose Petra over her Faith."" Of course, I told my teacher about the ending, and I think she wished she'd stuck it out to see it. I found some of the dialogue hard to hear because of wispering and such, but if you watch the movie enough, you'll get it.

  One last thing: Camille's dog. He dies in the beginning, and you'll no doubt be confused when you see him in the end, but I suspect it is more imagery. The dog is not just her pet, but part of her heart. This movie is not for those who don't enjoy thinking about a film LOOOOOOONG after it's over. If you don't think about it, you miss stuff (by ""you"" I mean ""me"" because I still haven't caught everything). But it's definately for anyone who loves love.",1104537600,11,3831,4.7218045112781954

Though there is not alot of dialog, I found myself not really caring, rather, I allowed the visual atmosphere to sweep me away. Unlike other 'lesbian' plot movies, this one relyed more on assaulting the viewer with soft and sensual moments between two strangers, letting them smolder and grow in intensity. I found the love scenes, some of the best I have ever seen by the way, tasteful and beautiful in their own  simplistic way.

I thought the general premise of the film where two women who were complete opposites and immediately become attracted to each other in this film was a lot more convincing than in most films that involved heterosexual couples. Pascale Bussieres plays Camille who works at a extremely conservative Christian college. She meets Petra (played by the gorgeous Rachel Crawford) in the laundrymat. Petra briefly comforts Camille because earlier that day, Camille's dog got loose and was hit by a car. Smitten, Petra switches her clothes with Camille's just so she can see Camille again. Her chance encounters with the unconventional circus performer leads Camille down a path of self-discovery and she slowly learns to really enjoy life. She quickly becomes torn between her rigid, conservative life with her fiance, a fellow theologian professor at the school she works at and a more free-spirit life that Petra leads. Eventually Camille makes her choice. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The music really captured the ambience of the film. I particularly enjoyed the scenes involving Petra and her circus troupe performing. The love scenes weren't gratuitous or weren't constructed for heterosexual male viewing like you would see in some mainstream film like ""Showgirls"" or even ""Bound"".

788543,4,6304111762,"We watched this film last night, and to say we were impressed is insufficient. This is a touching lesbian love story, an evocative discovery of a woman's sexual identity, and an entertaining couple movie, all bundled in an incredibly erotic package.
Camille, played by Pascale Bussi&egrave;res (well-known in Quebec for her role as the title character in the wildly popular mini-series ""Blanche"") is a repressed, conservative teacher at a Toronto Christian college. Camille is engaged to Martin (Henry Czerny), a fellow teacher at the college. Czerny is miscast in my opinion--it is sadly difficult to separate his character from the abusive and menacing Brother Lavin of ""The Boys of St. Vincent"". Czerny's brooding, hooded stare distances him from the viewer and makes him far less sympathetic than his character demands in this film.
Camille's engagement seems not to touch her very deeply, despite a passionate love scene she shares with Martin, and in a moment of vulnerability she is ""cruised"" and captured by Petra, a circus performer wild-child played by newcomer Rachael Crawford.
Petra visibly falls head-over-heels in love with Camille and the love affair which blossoms is beautiful and exciting in its intensity. The viewer's emotions are snagged and held by the way the initial infatuation develops into profound love between the two women.
Despite the foregoing, I have a couple of reservations about the film. The musical score is excellent--dark and sinister for the circus rehearsal and audition scenes and ethereal for the dream sequences--however it would have been nice to hear more of Shirley Eikhart's voice other than in harmony. The sets are good, but the ""iron"" scene is just plain weird and does not fit the Cirque du Soleil-like atmosphere. Is it a prerequisite of Canadian films that they display their artsy independence with strange camera angles, sentinel-like trees and transmission towers, and nausea inducing spinning?
And one last minor whinge about the DVD: Patricia Rozema is a talented and courageous director, but her ""director's commentary"" is for the most part mind-numbingly boring and uninformative. We kept commenting that we wanted to learn more about the locations, the cast and the crew, only to be treated to a metaphysical soliloquoy delivered in a self-conscious monotone.

 Camille is a teacher at a religious college, and Petra is acircus performer, who meet one night at a laundromat where Camille hasa break down over the fact that her dog had died earlier that day. Petra offers her some comfort, takes both their laundries from thedryers when they are done, and seeming accidentally switches theirclothes, although she does this on purpose because she is attracted toCamille, and wants to see her again.

Thereare no real heroes or villains in the movie, just people who react towhat is going on around them to the best they can, and two women whoare drawn to one another, and act upon their feelings.

I felt that there are many great scenes in this movie but the opening scene where we see the very straight-minded Camille having lesbian fantasties is probaly the most important scene because it establishes Camille's potential desire to be with other woman. These desires made the unlikely relationship between Camille and Petra(who is openly lesbian) much more plausible and believable.
I also liked the fact that the movie at times did not take itself too seriously and mixed in some fun and interesting moments with Camille and Petra.

788648,4,6304111762,"...my own seems a little heavy-handed. In honesty, I didn't see this movie as a very light-hearted film, nor did I feel that the romantic overtones of the film buried some of the other themes.
This is a very direct and clever interpretation of the Cupid and Psyche myth and I appreciated it despite the fact that the director felt it necessary to TELL us (I like my symbolism to be symbolic, you know) this story was a retelling of the myth.
I found the spiritual overtones and the direct confrontation of religious bigotry to be compelling and well-done. Although there's plenty to work with, the film manages not to villanize organized religion. Instead, Camille reaches a spiritual enlightenment of her own when she is at last able to unite her conceptualization of god and morality with her deep attraction for Petra.",959817600,,821,4.788732394366197

And she doesn't wear men's  clothing.  The whole story itself is very realistic that I don't even think  that this movie is a fiction.

788652,4,6304111762,"""When Night is Falling"" is a prefect example of what most people would call an eye-opener. Based on the framework of the story of Cupid and Psyche, where Cupid fell in love with a mortal (Psyche), a big taboo, this  film portrays this in a contemporary setting and context.  A chain of  events is sparked off after Camille, a young church teacher (Pascale  Brussieres), finds her dog dead, leading to her chance meeting with  stunning circus performer, Petra (Rachael Crawford). The two are drawn to  each other, but Camille faces her internal conflicts when she realises the  consequences of homosexuality on her ""christian"" life and her job  as a theologian.  The portrayal of the love scenes is ""luxurious""  as one critic puts it, but the portrayal of Camille as 'the torn between  tradition and love' Cupid, really shines through.  Though homosexuality is  the main theme of this film, it could also be strangely likened to a new  generation film like ""Romeo and Juliet"" (starring Claire Danes  and Leonardo DiCaprio).  A must-see for people who look beyond the  conventional and are interested in the placement of contemporary society.  And what better location than Canada for that..!",954460800,2,1190,5.015384615384615
788653,5,6304111762,"I had seen ""When Night is Falling"" in the video store for maybe 4 years. When I finally picked it up last week I was happy to find that $1 would buy me a weeks worth of viewing. Was that dollar worth handing over?  An emphatic YES is my only response. I'd have happily paid the usual $7 had  I known this movie would be so good.
Going to work the following day, I  was still entranced by this beautiful love story. Instead of actually doing  work, I decided to find out some more information about this movie. After  going to amazon.com, I was overjoyed to find that so many others were also  thrilled be this film.
The cinematography was magnificant and left me  longing to visit those snow encrusted forests of Canada. I'm still dazzled  by the swirling power staunchion over Petra's head. And like so many  others, I too was capitivated (maybe even spellbound) by Camille beauty. My  only regret in having finally seen ""When Night is Falling"" is  that I now have the knowledge that such consuming passion can exist. Had I  not seen this film, I might never have wanted to experience that passion  myself.
I have the arduous task of handing back the video to the store  today. Perhaps ""When Night is Falling"" answers the ""wordless  question"" that so many other movies have been unable to answer. I  certainly feel it has answered some questions for me.",949449600,19,1354,4.533057851239669
788654,5,6304111762,"I'm absolutely a tough critic, it's my ""station in life,"" but this movie caught some sparks inside of me that I never knew even had a presence.  When I first came across the movie it was an ordinary night; I  was bored and channel surfing, I happened to be watching a cable channel  and the titel displayed. Titles usually catch my attention and encourage me  to want to actually watch a program and this particular night was no  exception.  I first thought it was going to be another cheesy movie;  nonetheless cheesy lesbian movie, but I began to become intrigued by the  storyline and overall performance of the two actresses. Camille presents an  intimidating outer beauty that is coherent with her sweet voice, and what  is even better; her looks don't have to compensate for bad acting, she  doesn't become nude because she can't ""get into"" her character;  she becomes nude because she does ""get into"" her character.  Petra's beauty is strengthened as the movie progresses.  You begin to see  changes in her character, and in her performance.  It makes it quite alert  that love is a feeling in which no one born under the sun has any control  over.  The term ""homophobia"" has become quite a popular term  among heterosexual men/women who fear other sexuality preferences; mostly  homosexuality, and among homosexual men/women; which some feel like they  are looked upon as contagious specimens...homophobia; Jesus, society acts  as if  a person's private life or choice in life is a topic for discussion  during a therapy session.  Therefore, seeing this movie and witnessing how,  for once, a woman who was preampted to be ""straight"" with a  ""boyfriend"" could defeat the opponents within herself and decide  to act on her new found love for a ""woman"", and the new term  ""heterophobic"" made me squeal in laughter. This movie, although a  couple of years earlier, completely squashed the cliche' title of 'Chasing  Amy' which certainly depicted lesbians as ""needing men"" or  ""eventually falling in love with men"" as if there were no real  lesbians in the world who preferred sharing their most intimate,  passionate, and even routined moments with a woman.  It's absolutely  degrading. Not all lesbians are women just waiting for the right man, and  for all those future producers and directors of 'Chasing Amy' movie  upcomings...hint this; Not only was 'When Night Is Falling' filled with  passion, steam, and creativity; it is more true to reality than your  cliche' will ever be.  For my friend who actually named her cat  ""Petra"" after the character in the movie...this one's for you!",943833600,22,2595,4.951048951048951

I have seen this movie 3 times and its always like  the first.  This movie is excellent, the sets, the characters, etc. There  need to be more movies like this.

788656,5,6304111762,"I've seen this movie over and over (would buy it except it's still a fortune) - each time I see it it evokes the deepest feeling in me - sometimes one thing, sometimes another. The first time I saw it I was  shocked by how beautiful Camille was and I wanted her for myself. I loved  the two women on the trapeze - a more compelling presentation of trust in  love and of the beauty of two in one I have never seen - with each viewing  I love that sequence more. In later viewings I came to see Petra's beauty,  too. Then they were equal. I loved from the first the accepting nature of  the man who ran the circus. Several viewings in, I felt terrible sadness at  the loss of the church. The movie sort of presents the husband and  heterosexuality and the church (not to mention Canada which expects them to  pay their bills) as the bad old life - the world necessarily left behind in  the quest for right loving and living - and yet I felt the loss of the  church so intensely - not that I wanted Camille to stay. Of course she has  to leave. The only things I have never warmed to are some of the kitschier  bits, such as the heavy dog symbolism and Camille's passing out in the snow  - one always wants the plot never to kick in - contrary to other reviews,  this is not a realistic love story, rather a fantasy and a myth. The movie  is so Canadian - that country that hasn't gotten around to only doing  blockbusters - it's rather quiet in its over the top way. I think this is  my favorite movie. I want to see it over and over - at intervals - one has  other moods. It's so passionately beautiful and lovely.

7862372,5,6304111762,"I really didn't expect to like this movie this much. But before I go more into the movie, let me state that the performances of the two trapeze artists in the movie showed incredible skill and strength. Camille, who is raised and is in a stifling religion that impedes all human sensuality and feelings, and she has to be a part of it, especially since she is a teacher at the Christian college.  The message to feelings is that is their dogma, that is what is required, and let us pray together.  She develops feelings for a woman, and this simply is not allowed by her religion.  Her dog suddenly dies, and while doing her laundry, meets Petra, who sympathizes and then swaps her laundry.  Petra is in the circus. Camille is in a very serious relationship and is being considered as a co-chaplin with him for a religious college.  This puts even more pressure on her.  She puts on one of Petra's dresses, and it awakens in her that there is a sensuality that she is missing.  A deepening relationship develops, with tremendous passion as she is drawn into this relationship, while still reconciling her religious teachings. She is tentative and uncertain, while Petra is assured. It is quite erotic and passionate.  This film came out in 1995.  The ending is really good, and unexpected.  While it is a restored version, there were a couple of technical glitches.  If one has a cynicism of religion, you will love this movie. I don't give five stars easily.",1520640000,,1459,4.638132295719845
