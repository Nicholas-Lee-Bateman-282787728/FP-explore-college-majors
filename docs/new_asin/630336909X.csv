7844777,5,630336909X,"As a Lutheran pastor I have used this video for many years in first communion instruction.  It effectively gives my students an opportunity to experience a Passover Seder, enabling them to see the Jewish roots of the Christian Eucharist.  The video is informative and done with a light sense of humor.  Elie Wiesel is a delightful host.  The family depicted is warm and welcoming.  Highly recommended!  I wish it were available in DVD.",1173398400,3,435,4.890410958904109
7844778,5,630336909X,"This 30-minute video features an introduction by Elie Wiesel, who briefly talks about what Passover meant to him as a child in the Old Country, and as an adult now.  Then comes a re-enactment of a family Seder, followed by a wrap-up by Elie Wiesel again.  It's just the right length to use in a one-hour class and still have time for discussion.
The family portrayed is ""typically American,"" i.e., they dress modern and do not put on their yarmulkes until they sit down at the table.  That would classify them as a Conservative or Reform family.  At the same time, the narration includes pictures of Jews from around the world, celebrating the Seder in various forms of traditional dress.  The point is made that all these Jews are doing the same ceremony around their own home tables.
Members of the re-enacting family include the grandmother and grandfather from the Old Country, the Americanized parents, and their two children, a boy and a girl.  (The little boy keeps asking ""Do we eat yet?"" -- pretty typical of kids and adding a nice note of informality.)
The Seder follows the proper order, but is not word-for-word from the Haggadah.  The main purpose is to give a basic outline and teach the meaning behind the various items.  As each thing is explained, little animations pop up to illustrate the story, such as cartoon frogs hopping all over the table, a talking matzah, etc.  Animation is also used to illustrate a very nice story that the grandfather tells, about how charity was given to the poor in the Old Country. These animations add enough cuteness to keep younger kids interested, but, at the same time, they do not talk down to older viewers.
In addition to showing this to Jewish children, I have used it in multi-cultural programs to teach non-Jews about the holiday.  Many students have already heard of Elie Wiesel in connection with his books about the Holocaust, and are usually interested to see what he's like on tape.  Also, showing a video is better than just talking about the Passover customs.  The singing of the blessings in Hebrew, the background music based on traditional melodies, and the general ""stage presence"" of the Jewish actors all combine to give an authentic ""feel"" to the presentation.  In areas where there are no synagogues or Jewish families, the only way to get this authenticity is with audio-visuals.
When I use this in high school classes, I introduce it by explaining how the Seder ceremony itself is geared toward teaching children, and that this video was designed to help adults do that.  Plus, the explanations are easier for beginners than a video which assumes you know about Judaism already.  Older students usually ""get"" this and watch respectfully.  Besides, they like the animations, too!",1016668800,21,2756,4.844349680170576
