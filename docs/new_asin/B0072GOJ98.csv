Not the greatest actors or actresses but once again, it just works!",1396569600,,374,4.597014925373134
5049843,1,B0072GOJ98,If DVD doesn't come with sleeve they shouldn't advertise it with it. Tired of this. Ordered all seven seasons and only two came with sleeves. Yet all seven are shown with sleeves. I'd like to get what was shown. Wouldn't you? Amazon should be ashamed.,1395187200,,251,4.6

5049846,5,B0072GOJ98,This series is something I never watched when it was still aired. I bought 3 seasons just to be sure I'd get one specific episode. I'm glad that I did buy them because they've brought hours of enjoyment for my family. My grandparents absolutely love Tyler Perry's awesome foolishness. I'm buying them all!,1389744000,2,305,4.773584905660377

5049848,5,B0072GOJ98,"You must see my review on "" Tyler Perry's House of Payne complete series 1-8 "". (copy and paste title in Amazon's search box).
I spilled my heart out writing that review of Tyler Perry shows, movies and plays. There are people who don't understand how this television show, Meet The Browns and all Tyler Perry productions, mimics a very funny, people of Color television show, from the 50's. Back then, organizations  fought to get it off the air because of stereo typing, yet today we seem to have revive that genre and loving it.",1387152000,,531,4.589473684210526

8508882,5,B0072GOJ98,"Probably one of the funniest shows I've ever seen.  Displays wholesome values, in the midst of comedic activity.  I absolutely love this series.  It's on par with some of the funny classics, of yesteryear, like ""The Beverly Hillbillies"", for instance.  Wish it could have had a longer stretch of time on television.  I really wish they would bring it back on the Oprah network.  Very good show!",1485388800,,394,4.8059701492537314
