6397764,2,B00K0MM4E8,Our daughter loves the Halloween wiggles but really no reaction to this one (personal preference) However there aren't any Christmas songs that you would be familiar with that was a disappointment.,1415664000,,197,5.387096774193548

6397766,4,B00K0MM4E8,Another Wiggles hit with the kids!,1414886400,,34,4.833333333333333
6397767,2,B00K0MM4E8,"Just got this in the mail last week. We were so excited to watch the latest Wiggles DVD that we popped it in for a quick sneak preview despite the fact that Halloween JUST passed (two days ago)!
Our daughter LOVES the Wiggles, especially the current group of characters, so it passed with her. However, my wife and I were quite disappointed to find that this video was basically a watered down version of the normal Wiggles routine with Christmas decorations. The biggest disappointment was finding that even six songs into the show, there were ZERO songs/melodies related to any recognizable Christmas music. Maybe we are missing something or are clueless about Christmas in Oz, but if it wasn't for the Christmas tree in the background, I would swear this was a run of the mill Wiggles.
To be fair, we didn't get much further in the video, but hopefully it ends much stronger than it began. So far, music gets a 5/10, entertainment quality gets 6/10, ability to distract a 16 month old for 10 minutes gets 7/10.",1414886400,2,1013,4.664804469273743
6397768,5,B00K0MM4E8,Chritsmas might be over but not in this house! Our daughter loves this movie that she learned how to say GO GO and runs to find one of us to play it for her. I love that it has strong Christian songs about Jesus throughout it. It's wonderful.,1484697600,,242,4.0625
6397769,5,B00K0MM4E8,Very cute! My 2- and 1-year-olds loved this video.,1483315200,,50,4.666666666666667

6397777,5,B00K0MM4E8,Huge hit with my three year old.  I have had to watch this several times in one day many times.  She loves all the dancing and singing.  Oh it doesn't even have to be Christmas for her to want to watch it.  It's a cute video.,1469404800,,225,3.8260869565217392
6397778,5,B00K0MM4E8,"We love the wiggle in out house.  I love that we can take our table and having Amazon Video downloaded and the movie in it, we can have them watch it anywhere we go without having them use our data from our phones. The show has a lot of christmas songs that the kids can enjoy. Very entertaining for young toddlers from a year old to about 4",1468540800,,341,4.014705882352941

6397780,2,B00K0MM4E8,DVD worked perfectly but was not what we expected. There are very few scenes with Santa and no American Christmas songs. We didn't recognize any of the songs. My girls were not fans and it didn't keep their attention. If you are looking for a video to get your little ones in the Christmas spirit or learn Christmas songs- this isn't the video for you.,1461974400,,352,4.430769230769231

6397786,5,B00K0MM4E8,"My nephew loves the wiggles so I ordered him this one to watch just before our Christmas.  From what I hear, it was a hit!  I didn't watch the film myself but my sister told me he asked to watch it almost daily leading up to our Christmas trip together, so I'll call that a success.
Price was really low when we purchased so it was definitely worth it!",1454457600,,352,4.086956521739131

6397788,5,B00K0MM4E8,"Another great wiggles movie Go Santa go! I bought this for my three-year-old daughter for Christmas who is an uber wiggles fan. She doesn't watch anything else on TV  seriously, nothing else will keep her attention so we have a plethora of wiggles movies as they are not regularly on TV here in the US.  This video has become one of her new favorites and she's watched it at least 10 times since Christmas. It's a good mix of old wiggles songs and new wiggles songs sung by the newest wiggles cast: Anthony, Simon, Emma and Lachy.  Personally, I still like Wiggly Christmas a little bit better  it had more traditional Christmas songs in it, but I'm not the one watching it over and over and over and the person who is seems pleased with what this one has to offer.",1452038400,,765,4.404255319148936

6397790,4,B00K0MM4E8,"Ok, my daughter loves the Wiggles. I love the Wiggles. But I just don't get the whole soccer players (football players) being elves... you know... thing. It's just very bizarre and awkward. My 2 year old is too  young to really notice the awkwardness of it, so I guess it doesn't really matter. It just seems like it would be immensely better without them.",1451001600,,356,4.5625
6397791,5,B00K0MM4E8,"A must have for your little wiggles.  And what a great Santa and Mrs. Claus, so nice that they sing songs too. And they keep the ""Christ"" in Christmas. Thank you wiggles.

he didn't sit through more than 5 mins of this (we tried to watch it several times too). My husband and I don't have a problem watching the Wiggles but this was absolutely painful. HUGE disappointment after seeing the Halloween DVD (which was GREAT)",1447977600,,371,4.470588235294118

6397798,5,B00K0MM4E8,Good Original Christmas music from the Wiggles. This DVD will get kids into the Christmas spirit and they will learn new Original songs from the Wiggles. The song Go Santa Go is a great upbeat song. My child loves the song about Emma's Christmas bow. This is a good DVD especially for kids 1-4.,1439078400,2,294,4.462962962962963

6397825,5,B00K0MM4E8,My 5 yr old loves The Wiggles and so she loves this. I don't understand the bad reviews actually. This is exactly like the majority of Wiggles DVDs. I have 5 kids (the oldest is 13 now) so I have seen lots of Wiggles shows and DVDs and this is exactly the same as most are. The reviews that are comparing it to a specific DVD seem to not realize that very few of the Wiggles movies and shows differ from a set format. Over the years my kids have liked certain ones and hated others even though they were the same format just different songs. It's just the way kids are. :) If your kids love The Wiggles then you should give this a try. My daughter watched it on repeat the day we got it but isn't interested most of the time to see it again (like she is with everything),1417651200,,770,4.03921568627451

6397827,5,B00K0MM4E8,"We are Wiggles fans here so we were excited for our Christmas Wiggles video.  It's your typical Wiggles shenanigans and some fun new friends, and Santa too.

There are also some Santa, Elves, and Wiggles friends songs too.  We love it and the girls ask to watch it often.",1416787200,5,421,4.573333333333333

8654910,2,B00K0MM4E8,"We love, love, love the Wiggles! This DVD content is great, but the picture quality is really poor. We noticed that the Wiggles recently switched distribution companies and the new 2017 DVDs we ordered (2017 Go Santa Go; Emma; and Duets) all have a really grainy picture. Our TV isn't huge (about 55 in), but the picture is really distorted. I'm not sure if it's only produced for really small TVs or they've made some mistakes in the disc burn. If you're going to order Go Santa Go, I'd suggest ordering the older DVD version (2014). We've never had problems with the picture quality of the older DVDs. We're really hoping that the new distribution company makes changes so that the future DVDs don't have the same problem.",1510358400,,724,4.6640625
