7821750,5,6302148294,"Need a cure for worrying about eating too much at Thanksgiving? Too bad you won't find Bugs Bunny's Thanksgiving Diet on DVD. If you have it on VHS, or a homemade videotape via CN or Boomerang recordings, then this is a great idea to cure you of your worries, but I don't know about the overeating part! Bugs Bunny's a real (diet) doctor in this special, curing the eating problems of Porky Pig, Millicent the Slobovian rabbit, Sylvester (Junior), and even Taz himself, mostly in bits and pieces of classic Looney Tunes shorts, some never on DVD to this day, on top of this very special never being on DVD. It's a wonder it never got on DVD in 2010, like Bugs' V-Day, Easter and Halloween specials did! ""What I recommend is to... keep eating! Happy Thanksgiving!""",1478304000,,763,4.576642335766423

7821753,5,6302148294,"That's just what I do. I watch this show the night before Thanksgiving and I never get tired of this tradition. Bugs Bunny is found as the head doctor of a clinic trying to help this obese lady bunny try to watch what she eats at the Thanksgiving table. In between, he listens to Sylvester's problems, too. A nice holiday treat to enjoy the night before or on Thanksgiving day itself. HAPPY HOLIDAYS!",1038268800,2,400,4.493150684931507
7821754,3,6302148294,"I am an avid Looney Tunes fan and I must say that Bugs Bunnys Thanksgiving Diet did not fulfill my every expectation.  I was expecting a bunch of Bugs cartoons but instead it was a short, uninterupted movie.  If you are looking for something different you might want to try this but if its the classic Bugs cartoons you are after there are plenty more tapes out there that you would be better off purchasing.",997228800,2,408,4.426666666666667
