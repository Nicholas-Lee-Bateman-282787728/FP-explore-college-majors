8701069,3,B00TA465F6,"The oddly phrased title should be viewed as the first term leading to the second leading to the third. But it is the means by which that trio imbues LOVE CHEQUE CHARGE with a gripping beginning that starts strongly but slowly fizzles out into a predictable paste pudding that clumsily attempts to resolves some pretty serious themes. One might be forgiven for wondering how director Wu Meng En manages to partly cobble together a continuous string of coincidences that extend for nearly the entirety of the series seventy four episode run.

  Love:
  As in all Taiwanese romantic televised dramas, love between the leads does not begin in a smooth synchronous manner. Typically, the lovers meet with one pursuing the other. It takes the middle episodes for the two to conjoin and it remains for the last third of the series for a complicating factor (usually a stalking/rejected competitor) who insists on generally mucking up the lovers with some outlandish scheme. KunDa Hsieh is Shi Bo Hai who appears briefly in the first episode as a man intent on marrying Hsu Man Man (Phoebe Yuan). How these two disconnect is jarringly unclear. Shi Bo Hai asks a stranger He Bu Fan (George Hu) to meet his fianc to tell him the wedding is off. Yet later in the series Shi Bo Hai is then seen as being involved in an auto accident that places him in a coma for three years. This accident inexplicably negates the need for a healthy Shi Bo Hai to end a relationship with a woman he clearly loves.

  Enter He Bu Fan. Exit Shi Bo Hai (as a living breathing human being). Enter Shi Bo Hai as a spiritual essence occupying a place on earth while awaiting his wings. Now this sort of thing has been well done before in Hollywood and the concept of a benign spirit intrigues. Can the angelic Shi Bo Hai arrange a love affair between He Bu Fan and Hsu Man Man so she can get over being told about being dumped by a stranger that Shi Bo Hai deems as worthy of Hsu Man Man?

  Cheque:
  He Bu Fan is in the mold of the tall handsome and glib hunk that a woman on the lower end of the social scale falls for straight away. When he tells Hsu Man Man that Shi Bo Hai has asked him to tell her that her looming marriage is over, she predictably has a public break down, with her tearfully demanding of He Bu Fan what is his responsibility for all this. He replies, quite reasonably, that he has none. He is merely the messenger of bad news.  He takes pity on her and tosses her a sliver of hope, knowing that this sliver will likely never come to pass. He gives her a cheque and postdates it three years, telling her that if she is not married by then, He Bu Fan will marry her. This pseudo-promise calms her down a bit, allowing him to exit, congratulating himself on his cleverly wriggling out of an embarrassing moment.

  Charge:
  The ""Charge"" segment of the drama is long, unwieldy, and replete with an abundance of coincidences that reduce audience credibility. The ""Charge"" then becomes a metaphor for repaying a debt that should never have occurred in the first place. As with many Taiwanese dramas there are parallel plots playing out with the audience expected to accept these related love complications as interesting subplots. Some succeed, some do not.  The most credible parallel plot concerns He Guan Yu (Jet Chao), the brother of He Bu Fan. He Guan Yu is a roguish playboy who meets and falls heavily for whom he calls his ""wild rose."" This rose is successful businesswoman Wang Qian Qian (Jessie Chang) who falls equally for him. They quickly marry, but an ex-girlfriend Rebecca (Cherry Hsieh) mysteriously appears and with He Guan Yu in a drunken stupor, the two wind up in a motel room. Rebecca soon announces she is pregnant, causing considerable stress on the newlyweds. During the course of this subplot, Rebecca appears coincidentally at critical junctures to further muddy the marital waters. Rebecca is a monomaniacal schemer in the Fatal Attraction mold. She exists only to break up He Guan Yu and Wang Qian Qian.

  A second parallel plot distraction concerns He Bu Fan who has his own troubles with yet another monomaniacal schemer Victoria (Lene Lai) who is just as ruthless as Rebecca. The problem here is that both schemers are too interchangeable for viewers to see them as fully fleshed individuals.

  A third parallel plot concerns an employee of He Bu Fan, Wang Bai Hao  (Jay Shih) who pursues an impossibly innocent Tian Xin Ping (Smile Weng). What is of note here with all three plots is the extreme puritanical emphasis placed on the absence of sex. No one kisses passionately. Even the seduction of He Guan Yu occurs under a haze of alcohol. Wang Bai Hao and Tian Xin Ping agree to live in platonic bliss until they marry. What is most disconcerting about LOVE CHEQUE CHARGE is the ineptly configured pseudo-harmony between the tri-part title and the heavy use of coincidence to make what might have been an interesting plot work.",1475539200,,4948,4.6187214611872145
