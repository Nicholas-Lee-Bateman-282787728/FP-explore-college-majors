8541119,5,B009G82UDW,The story of Grace is very touching and shows the realities of what a patient and family goes through as the disease progresses.,1463097600,,128,4.608695652173913
8541120,1,B009G82UDW,"I, like another customer wrote, would love to see this film. Even willing to pay a ""little extra"" for it. But come on, seriously, $200. That has to be a misprint. Who has $200 to pay for an hour long film? Please lower the price and I will but it.",1448668800,3,247,3.96
8541121,1,B009G82UDW,Is the price a misprint? Would love to see the documentary...please fix the price.,1447459200,2,82,4.928571428571429
8541122,4,B009G82UDW,"Very thorough look at the progression of Alzheimer's,  at times a little too much time was spent in some segments of the disease.  The film is a bit dated in the technology that is portrayed, but the follow up of Grace's progress is timeless.  A good presentation for groups in health care to talk about the impact of this disease.",1398556800,,331,4.483333333333333
8541123,5,B009G82UDW,I really want this dvd. My mom passed recently and I have been trying to understand.  Unfortunately I do not have $200.00 to spare. Please if anyone  knows where I can get a used copy...let me know,1398384000,2,197,4.297297297297297
8541124,4,B009G82UDW,It was very enlightening for my students who work with alzheimer's patients to see that they were once functioning members of society and about the struggle for the care givers.,1394928000,,177,4.933333333333334
8541125,5,B009G82UDW,"I have been showing this to my Nurse Assistant classes for many years.  To see the changes that happen to Grace during the stages of Alzheimers is an eye opener to the students.  They see not only the behavioral changes and memory losses but the physical changes as well.  Then there is her amazing husband who kept her mentally and physically active.  One could only hope to have such a dedicated, loving and patient spouse.  I recommed it to anyone caring for others.",1361145600,6,469,4.602409638554217
