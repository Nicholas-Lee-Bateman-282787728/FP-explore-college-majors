7037616,5,B00UGPNQKA,"Absolutely remarkable. One of the best historical movies I have ever seen-- the history is pretty accurate and the story extremely strong. The bitter jealousy of Salieri and the brainless genius of Mozart becomes more than just an interesting  anecdote-- it turns into a universal theme. How life doesn't make sense. How jealousy hurts. How being a genius doesn't mean you're necessarily smart. How being popular doesn't have to mean you're the best. How fighting reality is ultimately fighting God and that is just not a battle you will win.
Also I have to say it's refreshing to watch a period movie that doesn't feature 100 % British accents. The recent craze for making anything European automatically British can get tiresome.
Costumes, production values etc are gorgeous. Acting superb. Comedy will have you in stitches.
A few ending points: there is one scene of partial nudity ( easy to fast forward) and quite a bit of inappropriate dirty talk ( mostly from Mozart). I also felt the later part of the movie dragged a little ( not sure if that's the extra 20 minutes allowed by the directors cut or just how the movie evolved over time). The details of the cheap vaudeville stuff Mozart enjoyed are tedious, and if you're not a Mozart fan ( I'm not particularly) you do get a little tired of so much of his music. I enjoy some classical music but Mozart's work is a bit cold for me.

8705781,2,B00UGPNQKA,"I purchased the director's cut of Amadeus thinking it had to be better, of course.  The second disc is very good because it gives an abundance of information about the production,  locations, casting, etc.  Very good!  the film itself suffers from the extra scenes as it changes the entire complexion of the story.  The addition of some of the scenes is overkill, while other added scenes change one's opinion of the Salieri character entirely.  He goes from a sympathetic character we could all identify with to one of base intentions whom we will ultimately despise.  The extra scenes are interesting, but in the end spoil the story.",1534809600,,635,4.878504672897196

8705784,5,B00UGPNQKA,"I saw this movie several times in the past and could not pass up the opportunity to see if Blu-ray would contribute much. Als what differnces are in the director's cut.

This is a unique approach to the life and contributions of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. It is told through the filter of an acquaintances Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) of who struggle with god. In addition, we seeing the movie of course may miss some of the play but being a movie we have replaced them with visions of Prague, where the movie was filmed.

The only thing that can be a bit annoying to some people is the laughing style they gave Mozart (Tom Hulce) in this production.

Be sure to watch the extra information where the different actors and the director tell about the trials and tribulations of getting a film crew in to Prague 1984 and having to deal with the secret police.",1509321600,,862,4.512820512820513

8705788,2,B00UGPNQKA,"The original theatrical cut of 'Amadeus' is my all-time favorite movie.  I've watched it dozens of times over the last 30 years, and it's yet to feel old, or worn, or dated.  In my opinion, it is as close to movie-making perfection as I've ever seen.

However, the ""Director's Cut"" of Amadeus serves only one useful purpose: it is incontrovertible PROOF that 'Amadeus' should have also won the Academy Award for ""Best Film Editing"".  The addition of the 20 minutes of restored footage takes a nearly perfect film and makes it almost unwatchable: Salieri rambling on to the priest about how pious he was in keeping his oath to God; A jilted lover, Mme Cavalieri, (in an awkward, and very poorly acted scene) chastising Mozart upon hearing the news of his upcoming marriage; Costanze Mozart attempting to go the, um, extra mile to get her husband a teaching job (actually, that scene is rather interesting, but lacks any sort believability.); Salieri telling the Emperor that Mozart is a rapist; Mozart attempting to teach a pupil while howling dogs run around the music room...  None of these scenes are compelling.  The acting is sub-par in all of them.  They do nothing to move the plot forward.

And sadly, the 'Director's Cut' is the only Blu-ray version of 'Amadeus' available.  If you've never seen Amadeus, my recommendation is to get the two-sided 'flipper' standard DVD, which to my knowledge, is the only version available with the original theatrical cut of the movie.  And I implore Warner Brothers - PLEASE release a Blu-ray version of the Original Theatrical Cut of Amadeus!

Had it not been for the skillful work of the editors (Nena Danevic, T.M. Christopher, Michael Chandler), I have serious doubt that Amadeus would have won even half the Academy Awards that it did.",1488931200,14,1784,4.874172185430464
