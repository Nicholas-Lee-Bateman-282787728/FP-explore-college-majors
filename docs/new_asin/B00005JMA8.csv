1535557,5,B00005JMA8,Ok Mongo (aka Alice) from Borders - The obvious product placement in this film is clearly a representation of how our culture is so saturated with brands that you can't even escape them when the world is ending and corporate identity no longer means anything. The film is filmed on Mini DV and the branding only adds to the reality aspect of it (one of the many reasons its so scary). The characters are shallow - but it is danny boyle. and the acting is terrible - although it seems somehow deliberate in a mulholland drive kind of way. But what a film! They really don't make 'em like this anymore (except they just did by making this). At least worth seeing.,1049932800,,661,4.426229508196721
1535558,4,B00005JMA8,"A laboratory is attacked by liberal hippies wishing to free test monkeys..a deadly virus is unleashed into the city of London.
Premise sound familiar? Prepare to be astounded.  28 Days Later is a stunning piece of cinema.  The world is turned upside down, the characters are faced with a horrifying reality, to tell you what happens would be to spoil a truly original and innovative movie.  Raising questions about the true natural condition of man, as well as containing a good old fashioned road trip, there is really nothing I could fault this film on.  The acting is superb, Cillian Murphy (Disco Pigs) a bright new Irish talent shines as Jim and familiar face Brendan Gleeson (Gangs of New York, The General) is fantastic as the father figure.  Miss this and miss out.",1048723200,11,773,4.7819548872180455
1535559,1,B00005JMA8,"I've only given this one star because it looks good but it really was terrible.  I too have seen Silence of the Lambs, and was even more scared by Hannibal which i thought was vastly under-rated.  Given the money that was obviously poured down the drain to make this I was appauled by its blatant product placement and the worst acting I think I've ever seen in a film.  Ignore the critics.  Go see Red Dragon.  Far superior.",1048032000,2,425,4.397435897435898
1535560,4,B00005JMA8,"I am usually not a person that is easy to scare, but this film terrified me to the very core of my soul. I have seen Silence of the Lambs, Donny Darko, Exorcist, etc, and none of them have ever given me nightmares. I literally wake up in the middle of the night with terrible images from this film in my head.
It also has some truly amazing effects, in that there is this superb shot of the whole of London empty and silent, which is unsettling.
On the negative side, if you've ever read John Wyndhams opus, ""Day of the Triffids"", you will laugh at some of the plagiarisms in this film. Also the ending, although original, is a little disappointing. Overall you will walk out of the cinema feeling shocked.",1047427200,3,706,4.356060606060606
1535561,4,B00005JMA8,"Hi Americans,
I have seen this movie in the UK and i must say, it is worth a watch if you like a good psychological thriller. It does have its scary moments and first person camera activity does put you in the picture very well. Special effects are nothing special, but make up is superb. Imagine being in a deserted city, with only cannibals left. Awesome to see at the cimema, wouldn't recommend buying it when it comes out on dvd. One of those films that once you've seen it, you won't need to see it again.",1047427200,3,510,4.268041237113402
1535562,5,B00005JMA8,This movie is rocked plain and simple. If your a fan of Zombie movies then you should check this one out for sure.,1047427200,,114,4.0
1535563,5,B00005JMA8,"From Danny Boyle, famous for directing Ewan McGregor in ""Trainspotting"" and infamous for his poor film adaption of ""The Beach"", we have the scariest movie that I have seen in twenty years.
The film begins near London, when a group of animal activists break into a secure animal laboratory. Against the advice of a very British looking laboratory technician, one of the activists releases an ape from a cage. When the laboratory technician desperately tries to smash in the brains of the activist, for the protection of everybody else, you know that there is something very seriously wrong.
Filmed digitally, there are several minutes of wonderful footage as the hero of the movie, dressed in a hospital gown, walks the deserted streets of London, even passing close to the Houses of Parliament. For the early part of the movie, you wonder where the residents of London have gone, and there is this mild horror, slowly growing in the pit of your stomached as you begin to see the extent of the devastation - or rather, depopulation.
I don't want to go into detail about the plot, because I want you to have the chance to enjoy this movie without preconceptions. This is both Horror and Thriller, but don't let friends or web-sites make you believe that this movie fits into an existing sub-genre. This film is not like one of THOSE kind of movies. It is far closer to Wyndham's ""Day of the Triffids"" than to anything by George A. Romero. I saw this movie in Glasgow in October 2002. Apparently I jumped in my seat several times, and I can tell you that the audience atmosphere during and immediately after this movie was tangible. There were lumps in a lot of throats.
Not to be missed - and definitely to be kept out of the reach of the children.",1047254400,4,1746,4.635483870967742

1535891,4,B00005JMA8,"Recently watched this again and I liked it, but found it not as good as the sequel, 28 WEEKS LATER. This movie had it's moments, certainly.
I found it at times to be a bit boring and dragged for anything to happen on screen.
I don't consider it to be a typical zombie movie, because they do not eat the victims as such. They have been infected with a man made virus called ""Rage"" after experimenting on Apes and Chimpanzees, etc.
Once infected with it, the ""victim"" seeks out others to transfer the disease at any cost. The infected die over time as the body decays, etc. Hence, the sequel for this movie.
I will give this movie 3 stars at least and 3 for the Blu-ray because the quality of it could have been way better for the format.
I played this on my UHD 4K TV with a Sony upscaling Blu-ray player and it looked like DVD quality. However, upon comparison to the Sequel Blu-ray, ""28 WEEKS LATER"", there was a noticeable difference in HD Quality with the sequel being superb.

There are Special Features on this Blu-ray disc despite what the editorial review says above ^^

1536326,1,B00005JMA8,"Just to be clear, I really enjoyed this movie & was looking forward to rewatching it. I haven't seen it since I was a teenager & was curious as to how well it held up. First, I bought the ""Multi-format"" thinking it meant multiple formats. Multi format is JUST the bluray. So I went ahead and bought the regular DVD aswell, in case I ended up watching it at my girlfriend's place. She doesn't have a bluray player. (Useless info but I know some weisenheimer will question why I bought both.)

I couldn't even begin to watch it. The video quality on BOTH the Bluray & the DVD is absolute garbage. I was astonished. In awe of the atrocity on my screen. A bootleg filmed by a man sneaking his camcorder into a movie theater, complete with crying babies & people chewing loudly, would've made for just as pleasant an experience.

The audacity of the cover to boast that it is ""beyond high definition"". This is a lie so grandiose you would think the box art was running for president.
I first played the bluray and I was floored by the horrendous quality. So, then I put the regular DVD in and I was stunned.
Had I been duped?
Are my video settings screwed up?
Is someone selling bootleg copies through Amazon somehow?
I just don't understand how this could have happened.
Why even bother releasing a bluray if there's no difference in quality?
EVEN the 20th Century intro looks like a glitched out PSOne game.
Surely this was not the quality that we saw in theaters.

I understand that way in which the film was originally shot it can't be upgraded to HD. I'll have to see how it looks on a CRT screen",1473724800,,1596,4.403389830508474

This movie is scary as s***e. I first saw it in theaters when I was 14. It was terrifying then, and... still is.
It is extremely violent. Making movies like Saw and Resident Evil  look like movies for children. I am not kidding.
Would I recommend seeing this 28 days later on Friday night with the guys? Maybe.

There are a few thrills and chills and a couple of unexpected what the f***s? Involved and there are a few scenes of undetailed abstract artwork that will most likely leave you feeling puzzled.

I rented this movie in HD, started watching it, and was immediately confused by its pixelated quality. After doing some research, I found out that the movie creators deliberately shot some scenes in relatively low-res Canon XL-1 camcorders for logistical reasons. I don't know if the entire movie is low-res (supposedly the last portion of the movie is high res), but be aware that much of the movie is purposefully low-res.

1536592,3,B00005JMA8,"The zombie genre, honestly, is an overpopulated one. What, with THE WALKING DEAD and numerous recent attempts to cash in on the craze, it's a little hard to separate oneself from the crowd when in the shadow of what George Romero already did. 28 DAYS LATER came at the early end of this recent uptick in zombie films and does manage to differentiate itself, mainly through a straightforward, ""realistic"" take that recasts zombies as humans infected with a virus. The only problem I found with this approach is that it robs the material of much potential for social commentary. I also found the choice to film on digital video a rather irritating one, giving the film a gritty, but cheap, look. At times, even the dialogue was difficult to make out. I also had took issue with the pacing, as roughly the first half of the film could have been streamlined a little bit in order to get Cillian Murphy's character from the hospital where we find him, to the family meets, and finally to the military base where second half takes place. Quite frankly, the film is kind of boring until he meets other survivors. For me, the second half is where the real meat of the film lies, and you get to see how in the event of a massive traumatic event, humanity reverts to brute (and uncouth) methods of survival. Here, Christopher Eccleston as the base commander, delivers what I think is the best performance of the film. The other cast members do fine, but there was little to latch onto as far as character development was concerned. As for the horror elements, I thought action and gore were well-handled, but the frame-dropping or speed-ramping was a little bit annoying. There was also some tricky editing going on to make things seem more intense than they really were. Some people might like that, but I typically don't. Ultimately, I ended up with about half of a good movie. It's not terrible, but I wasn't terribly impressed with the results either.",1462406400,,1945,4.673469387755102

Confused as to what's happened he ventures out and finds the city had been evacuated.  Believing it now deserted he soon discovers otherwise.  An excellent film though many mistakenly refer to it as a zombie movie.  The infected are not dead.

1537579,3,B00005JMA8,"A well-crafted zombie movie but marred by the typical British faults. Very slow in spots, eg., why at the beginning does it take ages just to establish there aren't people around? Also marred by casting: the Brits have taken political correctness and affirmative action to the point where they feel they absolutely MUST have numerous African-Americans in leading roles, even where better actors are available. The movie itself is better than most zombie movies. One idiocy I noticed is the director's anti-gun bias. Though constantly menaced by zombies, the characters do not bother arming themselves; instead they make do with machetes and baseball bats! Ridiculous indeed, although you can easily find Cricket bats in Britain, baseball bats are rare. Evidently the director expects the audience to assume the lead characters are as paranoid about firearms as he is. The film would also have benefited from some appropriate nudity and realistic violence. My criticism is not niggling nor is my praise niggardly; the sad thing is that with a little more honesty and bluntness, this could have risen from a workmanlike film to a great one.",1424649600,,1138,5.1567567567567565

1537810,4,B00005JMA8,"I love zombie movies and this one definitely met with my approval. Cillian Murphy wakes up in an empty hospital after suffering an auto accident. I know youve seen these types of scenes before in movie where the main character wakes up in a desolate world and you need to find out what happened when they were unconscious. Its sad and creepy and chilling. The TV show Walking Dead, I am sure borrowed from this movie and thats ok. They are both still well written and very entertaining. This disease called Rage gets lose after a monkey attacks some scientists and desolates the world population pretty quickly. It takes place in England, but you assume its the whole world thats effected. It revolves around four people who come together to find sanctuary somewhere from the walking, or in this case sprinting dead. These aren't your Night of the Living dead slow type zombies. They are fast, violent, strong and very destructive. It only takes a drop of blood in your eye to get it. Thats how contagious it is. Of course, as in most zombie movies, you find out the real enemy is us. Unlike the dead, we are self-aware and still capable of horrible things. I know the zombie genre can be limited in what they can do and this one is no exception. It has to borrow from a lot of other stuff too, but I still recommend it.",1411948800,5,1320,4.481327800829876

1537815,5,B00005JMA8,"28 Days Later (2002)
 The 28 days refers to the time from a PETA style attack on a laboratory housing primates until the beginning of the films action.  The lab government in the UK uses the primates to simulate humans in a quest to make a dangerous bio weapon.  They do.  The animal rights activists release the virus into the human world.  The virus causes tremendous rage on the part of the victims.  Think of fast moving, enraged, homicidal Zombies.  They are not just hungry; they want very badly to kill.
 Director Danny Boyle and writer Alex Garland say they modeled their story on The Day of the Triffids, a 1951 book by John Wyndham and the subsequent 1962 film.  There are certain similarities, never mind that the Triffids are mobile plants from outer space.
 One British horror mag rates 28 Days Later as the second greatest Zombie flick of all time.  Most of us find this a defensible claim.  We give it a strong four brains.  A few technical quibbles prevent the golden halo of a five brain rating.  Make no mistake, this film pops to the very top of the heap in the genre and makes the grade as a general film also.
 Director Danny Boyle is astonishingly good.  He directed the harrowing look at addiction in his very well regarded Train Spotting.  He won the Oscar for Slum Dog Millionaire, an outstanding film which garnered 8 Oscar nominations.  28 Days Later picked up seven awards in the UK, the USA and Europe.  The awards covered direction, acting and cinematography, a very complimentary mix of favorable views.
 The principle actors, little known in 2002, have gone on to major success.  Cillian Murphy has significant roles in both Batman Begins and The Dark Knight.  Naomie Harris plays Winie Mandela in the 2013 biopic on Nelson Mandela.
 So, we have a genius director using young but very talented actors.  Give them a thinking mans script by Alex Garland and we have a world class film.  In 28 Days Later we are given allegory-there is a dream sequence about a large flock of sheep harmoniously grazing, plenty to think on there in the midst of a Zombie apocalypse.  When we lose our fellows, our primate band, we lose a very great deal of ourselves.
 The terror of the infected is matched by the bestial behavior of the survivors.  In the climactic scene, the Murphy character exhibits the chief symptom of the infected, homicidal rage.  He so closely mimics the behavior of the infected that we think for a while that he must have been bitten.
 A recurring image in the film is the famous Greek statue of Laocoon and his sons struggling against his fate in the form of a giant, poisonous sea snake.  Laocoon has every muscle of his body, every fiber of his being, fighting the snake, a snake of overwhelming power.  Boyle is asking us to fight ill fate to the bitter end.  As human beings we should never, ever give up.  Thanks Danny.
 The producers allowed a mere $7.5 million to make the film, a pittance.  But genius will often surprise.  Great imagination, wonderful insight can make a great film without spending a great deal of money.  But it brought in $83 million at the box office.  We in the audience know the difference between gold and dross.
 Boyle made a sequel 28 Weeks Later (reviewed elsewhere) and has in mind rounding out the trilogy with 28 Months Later at a future date.",1410825600,,3322,4.602389078498294

The movie itself is 5 stars: great actors and plot. I bought this movie from Amazon Instant Video for HD. What better than not to have to drag a DVD around and be able to watch it instantly on our tv which has an Amazon app. Unfortunately, the HD video is terrible. And I cannot return or exchange this video. All instant video sales are final which I didn't know until this occurred. If Amazon cannot deliver HD quality then they should not be selling movies at a higher HD price.

Update: There are complaint(s) that since I didn't review the movie, I shouldn't have made this review. I completely disagree. I paid extra for HD quality and Amazon did not deliver. These ""reviews"" are as much about the quality as it is about the plot, acting, directing, etc. If this movie is not available on HD then Amazon should not have HD as an option.

1537954,3,B00005JMA8,"First of all, one reviewer described ""28 Days Later"" as the ""best British zombie flick""  ever seen, which makes it apparent that he or she has never seen ""Cockneys Vs Zombies"" and ""Shaun of the Dead"", both of which are superior comic efforts, and ""Dead Set,""  the critically acclaimed BAFTA-nominated British television zombie miniseries, which far outshines all three (and may well be available here on Amazon).

Secondly, ""28 Days Later"" does not by any means elevate the zombie flick to the level of ""art"" or ""literature"".  It's a zombie flick.  Yes, certain characters do blurt out a few lines about the hopelessness, the futility, the point of going on living when the world has gone to Hell in a hand-basket, but that is barely a first step on the long and arduous expedition toward the lost city of ""art"" and ""28 Days Later"" lacks the wherewithal to go the distance.

However, ""28 Days Later"" is not a bad zombie flick.  The atmosphere is generally grim.  The effects are gory at times and well rendered but unlikely to send anyone running for the ""loo"".  The dialog is competent and the characters run the gamut from the very sympathetic to the utterly detestable.  The cast does a fine job with the material.  I must say, though, that one gets the impression that somewhere there came a producer who decided that the film needed some lightening up in order to appeal to a wider audience.  I refer of course to such little gems as the scene where one of the leads decides that the best way past a logjam of abandoned vehicles is by driving a taxicab over the roofs of the abandoned vehicles.  I refer also to several characters, who, after 28 days of the apocalypse, evolve into modern gladiators facing down stoically the worst that the world can throw at them, only to run giddily and giggling through a supermarket while filling shopping carts (trolleys) with candy treats and single malt beverages.

Also, we are once again treated to a troop of soldiers who in slightly less than a month have dispensed with military discipline, and anything resembling civilized morality.  And these are the same johnnys who wear a nice suite of protective gear when firing on the infected from afar, but don't bother with goggles and face masks when defending their own citadel at close range.

Yes, yes, I know.  It's a statement about the disintegration of social mores and how the human condition barely tops out one rung on the evolutionary ladder above apes.  And if you need a zombie flick to illuminate stuff like this then you obviously skipped that old class ""Intro to Philosophy 101"".  Sorry, but I'm not impressed.

Still, it makes Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"" look like a third-rate amateur production, and though not nearly as creepy as the original 1968 ""Night of the Living Dead"" the horror fans among us should probably give ""28 Days Later"" a look--if only to maintain our street cred among other fans of the genre.",1407888000,,2928,4.7263779527559056

1538058,5,B00005JMA8,"To start off, this will be my first time ever writing a movie review; I'm used to the simple give-it-however-many-stars system.

I am one of the biggest zombie fans ever, long before the hype that was created by The Walking Dead. However, I am not one of those zombie fans that likes any and every zombie movie out. As a matter of fact, I despise a lot of the zombie movies because I think many of them are POORLY done. 28 Days Later is by far one of the best zombie movies to come out in over 10 years. They develop the characters wonderfully so that you actually care if anything happens to them. It has a great plot rather than just sticking people in a hell-ridden town or place where they simply try to survive. Although that is great and pretty much sums up many zombie movies, 28 Days Later offers more. It offers many of the themes that are now in popular series The Walking Dead, and I don't want to go any further than that because I don't want to ruin it for anyone that hasn't seen the film. For the action scenes, they are INTENSE! It gives those feelings of anxiousness, dread, and terror that we all seek from a horror films especially zombie films, but 28 Days Later delivers it in a very in-your-face, horrific manner.

If you consider yourself a horror buff, then this is a must-see.

Man, the movie is a classic and the story behind its making is very unique and hilarious in part.
Great movie that was Cillian Murpheys ""break out"" role at least to audiences in this country. Great acting, great storyline, tremendous direction and casting.......everything was simply awesome.
Also one of the first movies to have ""frenzied"" zombies featured.......if not THE first. Sure beats the old slow moving plodders that most zombies are portrayed as being.....but then again I like both......big zombie movie fan (except for the really dreadful ones and there are a LOT of them out there).

Even though you don't get much time to get to know the main characters, I find that I content to them through their actions and humanity. This movie is well worth the time.

While thrilling and frightening, it can be slow at parts (which adds to the tension, but some may be looking for more action throughout). I give 4 stars instead of 5 because (semi-spoiler) I felt the ending was weaker than the rest of the film. For parents or those concerned with content, there is a fairly lengthy scene in a hospital with the main character is fully nude, including genitalia. It is non-sexual, but definitely graphic. The violence, too, is quite graphic, but not over the top (like ""Saw"" or ""Hostel""). There is a great deal of language, as well. Discretion is advised (hence, the R rating).

1538328,3,B00005JMA8,"This is truly not your typical Zombie flick.  This movie is more concerned with human reactions and relationships during a zombie-type epidemic.  There aren't that many zombie scenes.  Cilliam Murphy plays Jim, a man who was in an accident around the time the infection escaped an animal research lab and was in a coma until 28 days later when most major cities in England were ghost towns because of the epidemic.  He is clueless about what happened to everyone when he woke up in the hospital, but he soon catches on.  He meets Selena, Frank and Hannah who are also not infected, and they do quite well under the circumstances until running into a large group of army men (uninfected).  This is where human frailties raise their ugly heads.

The cover art of the DVD box totally misleads you into believing that you are about to watch a scary movie about zombies or some other equally as scary creatures.  This movie is much more somber and depressing than that.",1381881600,,964,4.662721893491124

interesting complex characters. It still doesn't quite rise to being a great movie, through a combination of not really exploring the many political and social themes it hints at (George Romero takes that further), and pushing its internal logic pretty far at times. But it's always entertaining, has a lot of genuine suspense, and isn't over- reliant on easy scares and shocks. Interestingly photographed on video.

I would have rated this even higher if it had actually ended one of the darker, more emotional and complex endings included on the DVD special features. That would have brought it to 'classic' status.  (It was shown in U.S. theaters with the 'regular ending and then one of the darker endings, but for me that attenuated the impact).",1379894400,3,890,4.966442953020135

No, it's the psychological aspect of humans in a high stress environment when laws and rules don't exist beyond the might to enforce ones will.  Many new zombie movies forget this fact, but the greatest ones never forget about it.

So these zombies aren't undead, might be something difficult to get over, but it's a trivial bit of zombie mythology, and it makes for a good biological explanation in this movie.  They are rage infected people, highly contagious by bite, scratch, or any entry of blood into the human body.  They also like to vomit blood a lot, which is effective for transmission, since a single drop in the eye is enough to infect you.  They don't require head shots to kill, in fact they are as fragile as regular humans, just super pissed, non-speaking or rationalizing, and absolutely fearless.

1538523,5,B00005JMA8,It's not World War Z or the Walking Dead but a great zombie movie.  28 Weeks Later has different characters but completes the story.,1375056000,,132,4.5
1538524,3,B00005JMA8,"I enjoyed the first half of the movie. Cool urban setting, good character development for a zombie movie, interesting survival tactics and bonding of survivors, and just the right amount of Zombie mayhem to keep tension without turning into a grindhouse. I was looking forward to the second half.

Then it came. The second half. Um.

I think it would have been fine if the movie had started this way and you knew what to expect, but the story transition from first half to second is so abrupt and so different, it just makes for non-fun movie watching. And then the ending, which again shifts away from what just preceded it, is enough to make you scratch your zombie-loving head.

I think those that know Romero's work, will see it shine through in this film, homage, copy, you decide.

For those that dabble a bit in zombie movies like myself, the first half was good, the second half--eh, which means overall the movie boils down to just okay.

I am not going to say don't see it, because there are definitely parts that are great, but it is not something that will make you run out and buy the T-shirt.",1374537600,,1106,4.51
1538525,4,B00005JMA8,"28 days is an example of what a good budget, writing, direction, acting and editing can produce when done the way movie making should be done. The story and plot are well thought out and executed in a cohesive and chronological order that helps to develope the characters and their evolutionary thought processes as they struggle to survive. After they leave the city you can see and feel their relief as they start to think about the future and not just surviving another day. The actors were well cast and did a very good job bringing the script to life under the talented and watchful eye of the director. It was so refreshing to see most of the characters NOT doing stupid things or to be constantly at one anothers throat, again good writing means you don't have to fall back on amateur stunts to create tension or other stimuli to help sell your story. When the gang reaches Manchester they run into other unforeseen problems (not going to give them away here) that I had forgotten about once they left London. The virus that caused to outbreak was a good twist to the story and was equally well defined and integrated into the story from the begining, so we weren't left in the dark as to how and why all the chaos started in the first place. My only nitpick with this movie is a few scenes that are a little to far fetched for me, but at least they aren't way over the top crazy far fetched. The movie does contain a decent amount of gore and some foul language with a fair amount of violence and for the ladies, full frontal and back male nudity. There is a scene of attempted rape, but does not go past the initial asault before it stops. 4 Big stars ""MUST SEE""

1538674,5,B00005JMA8,"An experimental laboratory in which animals have been infected with the virus of a disease for which a cure was being sought is invaded by an animal rights group and the animals let loose on the population. The plague almost instantly  affects humans who spread it rapidly among themselves until the Island which is the United Kingdom is depopulated of all but a few unaffected individuals and many infected ones. It would appear that the larger world has also been affected but that is not directly of consequence for the plot. As we have seen in frequent theatrical and television productions recently,  a few survivors come together and seek to find some other group(s) like themselves with whom, somehow, they can ride out the storm, so to speak, until they can recreate some form of group life again.
Nothing in this is new on the media scene today. What struck me sufficiently to  single this movie out is simply the high quality with which every aspect of the process was performed. It's a case of doing roughly the same job only doing it better.
If your taste runs to this subgenre, you will not want to miss this film. If you want to see what model is being used by such films, this is a good one to try, since there is less visible violence and bloodletting than is to be found in the average of the type.

1538735,4,B00005JMA8,"28 Days Later is the brain child of Director Danny Boyle, who has might quite a name for himself over the last few years. It is also another post apocalyptic film that plays into people's fear of the end of the world. Most of these movies suck, but Boyle knew this and made sure his movie didn't. 28 Days Later follows the life of a survivor (Cillian Murphy) who wakes up in an empty hospital after an accident. He has no idea what's going on, but soon learns the horrible truth. Boyle decide to film the movie as if he were following this stranger from a distance, with an outdated camcorder. It gives the movie a grainy, dark, 70's style and fits right into the story. Cillian Murphy is great in his first leading role and you can see why he's now a name in Hollywood. Overall, it's pretty bloody and predictable, but defiantly not your typical end of the world film. The acting is top notch and the way it was filmed and directed make it something special.",1361577600,3,959,4.363128491620111
1538736,4,B00005JMA8,"28 Days Later is a 2001 British Horror film written by Alex Garland (who also wrote The Beach) and directed by the great Danny Boyle. It stars Cillian Murphy, Naomie Harris, Christopher Eccleston, Megan Burns, and Brendan Gleeson. The basic plot follows the main character Jim (Cillian Murphy) who awakens in a hospital several weeks after getting struck while on his bicycle and finds it utterly deserted. He eventually makes it out of the hospital and into the streets, which are also deserted, and then into an abandoned church where he is awakens and is chased by several ""infecteds"" only to saved from certain doom by two masked individuals who kill the infecteds by throwing Molotov Cocktails at them. The two individuals are a man and woman named Selena (Naomie Harris) and Mark (Noah Huntley), who later explain that while Jim was comatose in the hospital, an unknown virus was released from a government facility and quickly spread into the populace, eventually infecting most people and causing them to behave in a very rabid, psychotic manner. In this manner the disease was somewhat akin to rabies. The remainder of the film follows Jim and the others as they fight to stay alive in this dark new world. Now before I review the film, I feel I should make a statement as to whether or not this is a ""Zombie"" film. Personally, I don't feel it is, since the infecteds are not dead or ""undead"", rather, they are humans infected with rage to put it simply. Sure by biting someone they can make them infected as well, but it works the same with rabies and no one calls people or animals who have rabies zombies do they? So no this is not a zombie film, it is a horror film about a deadly virus and it's effects on society. I personally loved this movie, it was way more than your typical film of this type, which normally focus on mindless gore, violence, and gross special effects combined with poor writing and acting. 28 days later had great acting, dialogue, and special effects. While there were a few stereotypically gory, violent scenes, there were also many scenes that were actually quite beautiful and joyful, most notably the shopping scene and horse scene when the Brian Eno song was playing. 28 days later was a perfect blend of light and dark in my opinion. The acting was good all around, especially from Cillian Murphy, Naomie Harris, and Brendan Gleeson, and to top it all off, it was an incredibly frightening, nightmarish film. They were several scenes that had me on the edge of my seat and wincing in terror. Isn't that the purpose of horror, to frighten the viewer? In this regard, this film definitely succeeds, and I don't scare easily by the way. Along with Insidious, The Blair Witch Project, The Fourth Kind, Paranormal Activity, and The Exorcism of Emily Rose, this is one of the scariest films I've ever seen. There were a few minor things, which kept this great film from being a masterpiece though, most notably the beginning where we are supposed to believe that Jim managed to survive for 28 days in a hospital without being infected, he was in a coma for crying out loud and in all that time, despite being incredibly vulnerable, he awakens from his coma just fine while the rest of the patients in the hospital supposedly died or where infected. Yeah Right! Also the fact that they genuinely believe, with the exception of one person, that it's not only England that's infected with the virus, is incredibly idiotic. How the hell could a virus like that, where an person becomes a raving lunatic in only minutes after being infected, spread beyond the island of Britain at all? Yet apparently everyone, including the soldiers later on the film, believe this, with the exception of one of them. Overall though, 28 Days Later was an ingenious film and a realistic look at a society where civilization has collapsed and daily life has become a constant struggle for survival. A well-deserved 4 stars.",1361404800,3,3938,4.725290697674419

1538808,5,B00005JMA8,"The Rage virus has wiped out nearly all of England, turning its infected into murderous killers driven only by their need to feed. Now, a handful of unlucky survivors are left to find an escape from the nationwide pandemic. In 2002, Danny Boyle shook the Horror genre with a refreshing new thriller that redefined the zombie movie and terrified audiences around the world. 28 DAYS LATER offers a nihilistic world view in which humanity is the ultimate villain. Man's attempt to dissect and control nature is what caused the deadly virus, and while the infected mindlessly attack out of the primal need to feed, it is the living characters that kill out of fear, paranoia, and selfish desire. As best portrayed by the corrupted band of soldiers in the end of the film, it is darkest human emotions that drive home the suspense in 28 DAYS LATER, with the added horror of infected flesh-eaters running in the streets. The infected are unlike any of the undead that we have ever seen before. They are fast and ferocious, bursting through windows and tearing into their victims with a shocking speed. This would become a popular trend in the zombie films to follow, the most notable example being Zack Synder's frightening update to the Horror classic DAWN OF THE DEAD. Boyle's decision to shoot 28 DAYS LATER on a digital camera delivers a grim sense of reality, which is darkened even further by the dreary score. He also creates one of the defining moments in recent Horror as Jim walks aimlessly through the deserted streets of London. 28 DAYS LATER has a devastating effect on the viewer, and has proven to be one of the best films from the 2000's.

1538953,4,B00005JMA8,"There is no doubt in my mind that this sci-fi horror movie will keep you glued to your set while terrified at the same time. I saw the movie twelve hours ago and it's still with me. I can't get the visual scenes from my head. A virulent simian virus somehow crosses into ALF burglars freeing a chimp that then spreads into the city of London and then the whole country.

I liked the plot and storyline, yet I felt a few scenes were contrived. The scene where Tim is in his parents' house and is using a candle to look around the kitchen. That's the last thing anyone would have done as it would only have drawn the zombies to the house like moths to a flame. Then there was the scene where Frank decides to drive down a dark tunnel. That's the second to last thing I would have done! And the Granddaddy of them all was Frank's being infected by a droplet of blood delivered by a raven-crow!! What are the chances of a droplet of blood falling directly into his eye? It would have made better sense to have had Frank killed by the soldiers after he reached the estate as he and Tim fought to keep his daughter Hannah from being raped. That would have made so much better sense! Nevertheless, I was very sad to see Frank die. He was the character I most cared for in the movie. Had Frank's demise been written better I'd have rated the movie Four and a Half Stars. As it stands now I rate it Four Stars rounded up from Three and a Half Stars. One more thing. I don't want to leave out the great performance of Christopher Eccleston. Man oh man was he great as the ruthless major.

If you want to see dark sci-fi movies showcasing beautiful and grungy British locations, I recommend this movie and also Children of Men. Both these movies showcase a terrible future for Britain and all of mankind.

The DVD transfer is quite good for a movie that was shot on Mini-DV. England is a country you must see to believe. Beautiful, lush and posessing rolling hills one will never forget. I recommend this movie if you can handle terrifying horror scenes mixed in with extreme violence.

I didn't care about the characters, mainly because their actions were often unbelievably idiotic. Take for example a scene at night -- with rabid zombies roaming about -- our protagonists squabble about falling in love and f**king. Stupid. Another moment that sticks in my memory involves the silly third act, with Cillian Murphy freeing a shackled zombie at the military outpost in hopes that it will ""naturally"" kill the nefarious soldiers who are holding his two friends captive. Also, the demise of the character played by Christopher Eccleston, who's hiding in a car, waiting for our heroes, shoots Cillian's character (Jim); Brendan Gleeson's daughter takes off in the car with Eccleston -- going in reverse -- and ""naturally"" drives next to the aforementioned zombie. The zombie busts through the back of the car, taking Eccleston. Ridiculous.

This film has nothing on Cronenberg and Romero.",1344556800,2,1028,5.345679012345679
1538956,4,B00005JMA8,"I just got around to watching this movie and have to say it was an entertaining flick. It kept my attention throughout and I'm thinking about it days later (3 days...not 28 :)  The fact that you cared about the 4 main characters helped and the twist with the military in the castle and Jim's subsequent rescue of Selena and Helen was what really made it good.

Having said that, it could have been better.  There should have been more conflict (internal and external) amongst the soldiers.  The idea that only one guy in the platoon would have had any issue with raping the girls is hard to believe.  The major explains it as a necessary evil to repopulate the earth and keep his men hopeful.  But it's clear all the men just care about getting their rocks off.  Really?  Is that how we perceive the military?  And why not present it to the women in a different way.  IF it eventually became apparent they were the only survivors they are likely to eventually say yes, although they would chose their partner of course.

There were some things that weren't well explained either.  1) If this virus was so contagious, why was no one concerned with getting a bunch of blood on their selves?  Selena tosses Jim some paper towels after she kills Mark.  How contagious can this virus be if paper towels are sufficient to disinfect with?  If they spit/vomit blood, why was the Major not that concerned to be within spitting distance of Mailer? 2) Why do the zombies only attack non-infected?  If they are filled with rage, wouldn't they be attacking each other?  3) Do they eat? If not, how are they able to live so long?  The virus still has to follow the rules of nature and after a few weeks they would be very thin.  If anything, the infected should have a short life span since they use a lot of energy attacking people and vomit copious amounts of blood (which is another question...is this produced from some gland or does the stomach instantly start hemorrhaging?)  It would seem you could go out during the day, get a bunch of food and water and hole up for a couple months and wait it out.  The thing is, all of these questions would have been easy to explain at some point in the movie (perhaps the virus causes naturally makes them want to continue spreading the infection and maybe it dies very quickly once exposed to air.)  And of course, why do they mostly (but not exclusively) attack at night?

I've yet to see 28 Weeks Later but am a little disappointed it's different characters.  I'd have like to see what becomes of the Trio.  Were they picked up?  What more did they learn of the virus? Did the US and rest of the world consider nuking the UK?",1341964800,3,2660,4.455486542443064
1538957,4,B00005JMA8,"28 Days Later takes place in an apocalyptic London. Here, we have our main hero Jim having just wakened from a coma after 28 days. 28 days before, a group of animal activists unwittingly released a virus-infected monkey that promptly attacks one of the activists and infects her with the Rage Virus. When Jim wakes up, London has seemingly been abandoned and is empty. Until he discovers that the virus has infected countless people causing them to attack and kill all non-infected people.

After meeting up with other survivors, the small group which includes father and daughter Frank and Hannah and tough girl Selena,  must survive long enough to get to a military base they heard broadcasting on a radio or simply die trying.

It's not really a ""zombie"" movie per se (I seem to recall even hearing at one point the director say the infected aren't zombies. The movie does a good job at creating suspense, and an isolated and impending doom sort of feeling for the main characters. Here, if you get so much as a single drop of blood that's infected with the virus, you'll become like one of them in a matter of seconds.

I thought it was well acted. A good addition to your DVD or bluray library, especially if you're a horror fan and like zombie movies (though again which it really isn't, but close enough that the zombie lover in you probably won't mind).",1341878400,2,1361,4.634854771784233
1538958,4,B00005JMA8,"This movie asks the deeply philosophical question: can a zombie movie be artful?  Well,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Romero-s-classic/dp/B00005B1YC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Romero's classic</a>&nbsp;is unquestionably art, if a bit stark, and I don't think he or his cast considered it so when they put it all together so many decades ago.  But this film, with its very carefully considered and truly beautiful shots is a long way past shoestring-budget black-and-white, with friends and relatives filling in for the undead.  The artistic approach is deliberate, giving us a zombie movie with fiery explosions and some relatively graphic violence as well as lovely cityscapes and idyllic countryside musings.  In the end, one can't help but figure that director Boyle is telling us the world would be a mighty beautiful and peaceful place, if there just weren't so many damn people in it.  (He's right.)

But for all its Peter Weir-like cinematic artistry, the disconnects are pretty big.  If you're going to be serious about a zombie apocalypse, then you've got to get down to details, and work to eliminate the holes.  At least this zombie deathscape doesn't have power or water.  That's a good start.  But no dead bodies lying everywhere?  Dead animals?  It's only been 28 days, right?  We see indications of an evacuation, but where did everyone go?  And all of the cars off the roads?  I know Britain is a pretty conservative and some would even say docile place, but did they really manage a total national evacuation that well, and leave the streets largely free of litter, or pillage?  And was it so perfectly orderly that grocery stores still have fully stocked shelves, with no mess on the floor even?  No stores overrun by animals, the refrigerator cases containing pulsing masses of insects revelling in the mush that used to be refrigerated consumer comestibles?  Really?

The shot of Manchester burning is one of the best in the movie, a serious plus, one of good, honest storytelling.  Fire in a societal collapse scenario is one of the biggies--with no fire brigade to respond in a city, the fire will just spread and spread, and given the smallest ignition and the proximity and abundance of fuel, it's likely every city would burn to its foundations in a matter of days.  The lack of a London firestorm is a necessary oversight.

And the inescapable need for an explanation zombie existence keeps complicating things.  Here the bad guys technically aren't zombies.  They are not the undead; they are all quite alive.  They're just ""infected with rage,"" which means they are still fully human, although suffering from a fast-acting malady making them permanently unhinged with homicidal rage.  So, the whole brains-eating thing is out, as is the need for a head shot or decapitation to put them down; a double-tap to the torso will do the trick.

The neat plot device here is that the zombies are speedy.  Since they're not undead, they can run, and run they do, really fast.  And they're strong, with that rage apparently amping up their adrenalin levels quite a bit.  Okay, that's fair enough, and all relatively scientifically logical.

But they're still human, and alive, which means that after a day or two of maxed-out, rageful running about and killing anything that moves (why aren't they enraged at each other?) without water or food--we don't see them drinking, or even engaging in the fun zombie standard of eating brains--they should be physically incapable of doing anything more than groaning and slipping into death by exposure, dehydration, starvation, sepsis, any of the unpleasant things that the human body is stuck with, rage or no.  They're dumbed-down with their rage infection, in that they don't have any higher-level brain function, which means they're reduced to reacting to sight and sound; the rage has apparently done nothing to their sense of touch or smell.  By the end of the film, roughly 60 days after the story opens, we see a few zombies wide-eyed and emaciated, clear evidence that they're starving or otherwise running out of rage-zombie steam.

And they vomit blood, which is pretty cinematically neato, especially given the subtle stroboscopic lighting technique.

Ah, how ironic, the greatest threat to our heroes is not the zombies, but the humans whose duty it is to first rescue and then protect us humans.  Hero-boy has to get mortally active, and bests his zombie tally until their escape is complete.

Bottom line: When the apocalypse comes, the enemy will be them, and us, too.  So stock up on your rations, weapons and ammo, and be ready to do what you need to.",1341532800,,4674,5.077326343381389

The only problems I had was the the virus itself. At first, I thought the name of the virus - ""Rage"", was literal, meaning the moneys became infected because they were exposed to so much emotional hate and anger, which obviously would be a corny and cheap plot device. I realized this was likely just a nickname, but wished the movie had made this distinction clearer. Also, the speed by which the virus spread through the body once infected was too fast, in my opinion. 20 seconds to transform from normal human to mindless zombie was a stretch. I am sure there are really nasty viruses that do spread almost this fast, but I wished this movie would have taken a less sensational plot device.",1318032000,2,1024,4.595628415300546
1539015,4,B00005JMA8,"28 DAYS LATER

This movie seems to get a lot of mixed responses from people, but I think that it's one of the few good horror films in the past decade to warrant serious attention.  It's essentially a remake of the classic Night of the Living Dead, which is itself a remake of The Last Man on Earth, so what you are seeing is the unofficial retelling of the now classic zombie tale, a modern invention considering the zombie story isn't cemented in folklore or literature like so many other monster tales are.

The concept is novel--a man awakes from a coma to find the world he knew has vanished.  It's a great image and the movie does a great job re-creating this now abandoned world.  In short time we find this world is actually quite alive, but only with the zombified remains of individuals who through exposure to an unknown virus, are driven insane with an unquenchable lust for violence.  Along the way he discovers he is not alone among the uninfected, and that small pockets of uninfected have been holding out from the zombies.  It is this small group of survivors who must now navigate a world greatly changed and vastly more dangerous.

It's a familiar but frightening concept.  Being trapped in a radically changed world, forced to battle new and unusual forces against seemingly overwhelming odds.  But this movie pushes the subject into new territories.  Like George Romero, Danny Boyle (director) explores a variety of social topics--biological warfare, societal collapse, authority, and primal instinct, just to name a few.  He even lifts the infamous patricide scene from Night of the Living Dead, only with very different circumstances. Nonetheless, it's a very chilling concept, and a very disturbing scene.

There is a nice blend of action and dialogue throughout the film keeping the pace of the movie nice and even.  It doesn't go overboard in it's violence, and I feel that is what keeps the film so frightening, because you're never sure just where and when a threat is going to present itself.  I also like the idea that the zombies are not your typical dead flesh-eaters.  They are alive, they are people, it's just that their fight mechanism has been pushed to full throttle.  These zombies also have speed and agility, unlike the classic notion of the slow and clumsy zombie that is mostly seen in movies.

The story takes a fatal turn when our survivors meet up with a renegade army unit.  These guys are uninfected, armed to the teeth, and have in all appearances, held on to a small shred of humanity.  They have barricaded a mansion and established a sanctuary for survivors, but as the truth unravels, we find that these rescuers have more in common with the infected zombies than previously thought.  The only hope for the group to escape a horrific fate is to tap into that same primal force that drives the infected to kill mercilessly.  It's a great new spin on an old tale that distinguishes 28 Days Later as a horror film classic, while giving us some thought about just what a post-apocalyptic world would look like, and whom we could trust.",1317686400,2,3084,4.74671669793621

1539017,4,B00005JMA8,"A group of idealistic animal activists break into a laboratory to free monkeys that are being experimented on. The captive scientists warns them that they are extremely contagious, but they don't listen, unleashing a devastating virus that causes mindless rage in the infected into the world. 28 days later, Jim wakes up in an empty hospital room. Then he discovers that the hospital, the street, the city, and all of England is a barren wasteland. After encountering other survivors, he discovers that the last piece of news before the TV and radio went out was that the virus was spreading. Jim and his small group of survivors hear a broadcast over the radio, urging them to join a military group for shelter, safety, and an answer to the plague. With no other options or places to go, they head to the location, satisfied with some sort of plan for the future. They try no to dwell on the fact that the men that left that message may already be dead.

28 Days Later is a unique zombie film. I've avoided seeing it for a long time because I would catch bits and pieces and I wasn't really impressed. Seeing the film in its entirety is a different experience, so I'm glad I finally sat down to watch it. It isn't perfect, but a very good addition to the zombie genre. The film has beautiful and powerful cinematography. Danny Boyle is extremely talented and crafted surprisingly artistic scenes. The most visually striking scenes are when Jim is wandering London, which is completely empty. The signs of the apocalypse are the only things that mar the landscape and include overturned cars, money all over the floor near banks, fires, and dead bodies. The aftermath of the chaos, the silence, and the blank canvas of a city created a suspenseful atmosphere. The Infected are also filmed in a different way than the rest of the film, giving them a jumpy, rough quality that sets them apart from the rest of the characters.

The zombies aren't quite zombies. They are more akin to the Beaters in Sophie Littlefield's Aftertime because they are still human, but driven by rage. It makes more sense why they are fast because they are still living, breathing humans. Because they can't feel pain normally, they can push themselves beyond human limits. When humans aren't around, they go into a dormant state, which is a perfect time to conserve energy and rest. They come out of this state when humans get their attention, through movement, sound, or even light in the darkness. The virus that causes the rage state is very much like Ebola: transmitted through blood, saliva, and other body fluids and can communicable between primates and humans. One aspect of the disease that is unique is the infected vomiting gouts of blood in order to spread the disease. This just made sense to me and reminded me of a disease that makes rats get eaten by cats so it can be in its preferred host. With the infected being human, it seems to be only a matter of time until they starve to death (or, more realistically, die of thirst).

The film poses some important philosophical questions. Is survival or happiness/friendship more important? How far should science go with experimenting with deadly viruses/biological weapons? Is there a point when life is no longer worth living? How far would you go to protect yourself and loved ones and survive? At one point in the film, Jim is committing horrible acts of violence against humans to protect the women he's traveling with. The film technique used for the zombies is used for Jim in this instance, challenging the viewer to compare the two. When he finishes his violent acts, one of the women can't tell whether he has been infected or not: his appearance is savage and the acts he committed are very similar to what one infected would do. This also challenges us to define what it is to be human.

This is no ordinary horror film. 28 Days Later explores many themes critiquing society and it revamps the zombie in a unique way. I must say that this is one of the most suspenseful and frightening films I've seen in a while. I literally screamed out loud at some points and had the urge to cover my eyes. The soundtrack created a perfect atmosphere and heightened the suspenseful moments. I had a few very minor problems with it, but overall I highly recommend this film to all zombie fans.",1316908800,,4329,4.684625492772668

The thing that is scary is this could actually happen. Scientists dabbing into the unknown or forbidden, and people trying to protect animals that cannot protect themselves...except the animals are infected with RAGE, a virus that causes the chimpanzee's to be full of uncontrollable rage.

28 Days Later....

The virus had spread throughout the UK. The ones whom have been infected are not the revived dead. The infected chase the NON-infected with the simple desire to kill them in a fit of rage, not eat their frickin' brains ;)Another key difference is that the Rage-infected victims are still living human beings and as such can be killed using conventional weapons that inflict fatal injuries. But what actually is the rage virus? The Rage Virus causes extreme aggression in a victim only ten to thirty seconds after being infected with the disease. From that point on, the victim seeks out and viciously attacks any uninfected person to the extent of anything else, even self-preservation. The disease is easily transmissible through any bodily fluid as shown in 28 days later when Hannah's father looks up to the sky and gets a red surprise in his eye. Because of this extreme contagiousness and very short incubation time, a crowd of hundreds could be infected by one single individual in a matter of minutes as shonw in both films, particularly 28 weeks later after Don becomes infected. The Virus gives those Infected a heightened mobility and endurance, thus enabling them to quickly rampage through miles and miles of territory and invade entire towns. The Virus also seems to change the behaviour of the Infected, because before they were generally diurnal and slept at night; but in the space of time they are Infected they become nocturnal and sleep in the day.

Whether you like it or not is not the factor. This film was a critical and commercial success offering a new look at a post-apocalyptic horror film. It also spawned a sequel,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/28-Weeks-Later-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000TJBN80/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">28 Weeks Later (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;and a book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/28-Days-Later-The-Aftermath/dp/0061236764/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">28 Days Later: The Aftermath</a>. The film was shot almost entirely in sequence which is rare and cool nowadays. Also the film was shot almost entirely on digital video making it NOT NEEDED ON BLU RAY!! I have seen this film before plenty of times on regular dvd and on tv, no HD. Finally watched it yesterday on blu ray because my sister owns them and I honestly was not impressed. But I understand, its not meant to be beautiful and crystal clear so whatever. I just will not dish out extra cash to pick this one up on blu ray and get rid of the dvd one and I advise the same to others. If you already have the film on dvd, your not missing anything. The ending of the film, and I mean the very end after the escape from the military horndogs and once their trying to get noticed by a plane was the only part I found crystal clear and saw no grain.

Cillian Murphy (pronounced Kill-ian) in his breakout performance was absolutely profound in this role and won me over completely. Danny Boyle, the director said to prevent disbelief relatively unknown cast members were chosen. I tend to enjoy films like that. The hangover is a weird example of another film that was a critical success with relatively unknown actors in it. Sure, they played smaller roles somewhere, but now look at them all. SUCCESS!

There are three alternate endings included in the special features of the movie.
#1: Jim dies at the hospital (this was called the ""true ending"" as it brought Jim full circle from waking up in a hospital bed to dying in one)
#2: Rescue coda w/o Jim (only selena and hannah are here, no jim)
#3: Radical Alternate Ending (would have taken story in a radically different direction from film's midpoint) watch for yourself...

With an estimate of 8 million to shoot the film...the gross has reached nearly 83 million worldwide. You be the one to judge whether this film will surprise you or not. I've said enough..

oh Yeah, Did I mention Cillian Murphy is Awesome?!?!

Hope I've been helpful, I didn't want to spoil film for ya

In a mere 20 seconds, the afflicted person contracts an illness that induces violent cannibalism and the spewing of blood by mouth. The carnage, the paranoia, the utter insanity of it all is non-stop. You'll need a strong heart and a cast-iron stomach to make it through this one!

1539094,4,B00005JMA8,"The survivors Jim met after his coma are Mark and Selena but later Mark was killed by Selena because he's bitten and infected during a fight with zombies in Jim's house where they went for Jim's request of seeing if his parents were alive. But they had eaten pills to suicide and left a note to Jim on which they wrote about their despair of the hopeless and collapsing civilization.

They're attacked due to Jim's candle light in the night for watching photos reminiscent of his past family memory. So we can say Jim caused Mark's infection. But, Selena is the person who killed Mark just because of suspicious. Jim asked her how was she sure Mark was infected? Selena answered that she would also kill Jim if he might have been infected, ""in a heartbeat"". Never hesitate.

In the later plot, the director is talking about the gradual loss of hope and humanity, along with the devastation by virus. The military, government, and all society are stepping to ruins. And Danny Boyle conceived audience of Selena's change by Hannah and her father Frank.

Danny Boyle didn't put more and more blood subsequent to their meet, but more about their interaction with sense of humor such as their happy shopping in empty supermarket. He focuses on the people more than terror. Terror is necessary only to support the story. Otherwise, the audience will shortly get used to the blood. It's hard to fright modern audience only by effect.

Who had lost his hope to the world, hope of humanity? And who still keep it? It's also a question for Jim who had stroke an infected boy to death with blank face unmercifully. When they still despaired of the empty military base, Frank was infected. And the military showed up at this moment but shot Frank to death at Jim's hesitation. Are the military really their savior?

Obviously ""future"" which the commander gave his soldiers is an excuse for satisfaction of their monstrous sexual desire. They all had given their conscience except one who protected them but executed with Jim later. Jim escaped. Thus far the movie is not just a simple terror zombie and has accumulated enough conflict about fear of virus, and fear of ""human"" as well.

The last extremely excellent dramatic scene rendered kind of crash of humanity by a series of bloody, violent, terrible fights. But the metaphors are not given abruptly but have brewed since the beginning. What we saw is not only a world crumbled by the virus but by primitive human.

Apparently, director deliberately makes Jim looked as zombie or kind of crazy monster, and when he killed the soldier who grabbed Selena, his way is cruel, he pressed his eyeballs into skull. Selena almost cannot tell whether Jim's infected and intends to slash him. She held the same weapon she killed Mark, a machete.

She didn't. She still keeps her trust of Jim, and her humanity.

Jim said ""It's longer than a heartbeat"". And the name of the passionate post-rock music within this whole violent process is ""in the house, in a heartbeat"", which strengthens this passage's dramatic power.",1299628800,2,3050,4.783269961977187

Then the music quickens as the lone character strolls through the emptiness; is he really alone?  Even when he meets others, how tenous the relationships?  (Loved how the imagery went from vast to boxed in, chopped up, limiting; the rush up a stairwell.)  This was a cleverly thought out film with many set pieces to lift it out of a well-worn genre.  Trust was a major issue.  Also the gravity of their situation which sometimes they risked by overlooking the obvious; things have changed.

1539213,4,B00005JMA8,"Is it a B movie in outlook?  Yes.  But did it surpass expectations?  Yes.  And is it a zombie flick?  Yes and no.

I'm not one for horror films generally, but when exposed to Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead as a young adolescent, I responded to the sense of isolation and survivalism and to the apocalytic context.  Ever since then, I have had a soft spot for zombie flicks that is easily disappointed and turned off.  But it was tickled recently when my brother showed me the pilot episode of The Walking Dead.  Hearing that 28 Days Later was inspired by the same story line as The Walking Dead, I decided to try it out.

I am pleasantly surprised.  28 Days Later is more than excuse to watch decapitations.  In fact, it is not really a zombie flick and doesn't explicitly stick to conventions such as the importance of the brain.  The ""infected"" are not zombies but the results of a biomedical experiment gone bad in merry old England.  The plot involves the search for sanctuary and the fall-out that happens when it is found to be a group of bachelor soldiers holed up in an English country house turned into a fortress.  There is not an excessive amount of gore and rather than a horror movie, this really as much a day-after sci-fi movie that has aesthetic commonalities that range from Dr. Who to Heart of Darkness.

Very enjoyable.  The time passed quickly.  I cared about what happened to the characters.  The production values were entirely adequate.  Now planning to watch 28 Weeks Later, too!",1290384000,,1518,4.531365313653136

1539215,5,B00005JMA8,"Ever since the original 1968 George Romero film ""Night of the Living Dead"" zombies have been slow-moving undead corpses with a hunger for human flesh. Before this zombie films were mostly about voodoo zombies. Just like how George Romero changed the idea of a Zombie film forever this one has a large impact on the genre as well. Unlike their Romero counterparts the zombies in here aren't slow moving and will sprint after their victims. Another big change here is that these zombies aren't actually dead but are infected with a rage virus that is similar in nature to rabies. The running and viral infection ideas have had a large impact on zombie films and now most of movies have at least one of these traits.
This film's premise revolves around a man named Jim(Cillian Murphy) waking up from a coma in a hospital bed only to find out that the whole of Britain has been taken over by rage-infected zombies. Jim meets up with various other survivors and they makes their way across country in search of a safe zone. They eventually come across an isolated group of soldiers who claim to have an answer to infection and let them into their compound. Another thing that this film does differently than other zombie films is that in here once they become infected with the blood they become infected within seconds. In the oldschool zombies films like ""Dawn of the Dead"" it took a slow three days or so for them to eventually change.
  28 Days Later is a suspenseful and Tension-building horror film that sucessfully combines the horror genre with the post-apocalyptic type film. This film is able to do a lot with it's relatively low budget including effects and set pieces. The actors in here do a good job and the film is masterfully directed by later Oscar winning Brittish director Danny Boyle. 28 Days Later is a great horror film that is highly recommended and a must own for fans of the genre.",1290124800,,1901,4.654761904761905
1539216,4,B00005JMA8,"Animal activists break into the Cambridge Primate Research Centre for obvious and understandable reasons. If only the chimpanzees weren't already intentionally infected with a virus only referred to as ""rage"" and forced to watch countless hours of human violence (shades of A Clockwork Orange, anyone?). With infection possible by mere contact from contaminated blood (absorption or by a bite being the main sources of contraction), and the effects of said infection only taking 20 seconds to take its course, a man-made pandemic is thus completely out of control. But how could Jim, a courier hit in a traffic accident while on duty and left in a coma for, oh... four weeks or so... be aware of the changes that have taken place in his conscious absence? I suppose the hard way when he comes to, awakening to an abandoned hospital as well as... well, ... London! And so Jim's journey begins to find the cause of this desolate earth he once called home, finding the cause to be horrible beyond imagination, the survivors to be few and hope to be, well.. at a disadvantage. Director Danny Boyle creates a landscape beautifully balanced between hope and despair, even when the scenes of hope are few and far between. Many people depict this as a zombie film, for obvious reasons in terms of the physical appearance and mannerisms of the abundant antagonists, but they are nothing but. In a way, this is an advantage for the shock value; when the infected civilians are on the hunt, in their abnormal ""rage"", it is high velocity horror action at its finest. That said, it causes proper reaction from the viewer who is more accustomed to the slow moving type of horror villain. A slight stall in the midsection (in route to possible salvation) and the arrangement of where our heroes (you didn't expect Jim to stand it alone, did you?) end up are the only deterrents from a possible perfect rating. An unashamably graphic and mostly downbeat effort that, for the most part, is a modern horror movie masterpiece. 8.25/10",1288137600,,2015,4.826589595375722

1539218,1,B00005JMA8,"First of all, I have to say that the movie itself gets 5 stars.

This review is of the actual Blu-ray version of 28 Days Later.

This was probably the worst up-conversion I have ever seen.  The movie somehow seemed blurrier than the DVD version (which I also own).  I thought that High Definition meant that the video clarity was supposed to improve.  Maybe I was wrong.  However, I will concede that at the very end of the film (when the characters are outdoors on the countryside) it does appear to be 1080p High Definition for that one section of the movie.  Maybe the creators wanted to keep a gritty feel throughout the first 98% of the movie to express the negativity of the infection, but as a fan of High Definition, I was supremely disappointed to see such a blurry, pixelated mess.

Another negative thing about this was that I was able to see more things on screen (even though they were blurry) and I saw an irritating blooper early on in the film that I had never noticed on the DVD version.  When Jim is wandering around the city ""alone"" there is a wide shot in which I could see a vehicle traveling in the background.  It really ruined the tone of the film at that point because as a viewer I was supposed to feel the intense isolation that Jim was experiencing and instead I felt annoyed.

Please remember that I absolutely LOVE this movie, but buying the Blu-ray was a waste of money.  If you already own the DVD, DO NOT BUY THE BLU-RAY.",1279929600,4,1454,4.384328358208955

1539220,4,B00005JMA8,"Now I will admit that seeing this in blu-ray made absolutely no difference for me.  I hadn't owned a copy before, and this blu-ray was marked around $10, so I definately got what I paid for.  As far as transferring the DVD to the Blu-ray there is virtually no change.  There's no advantage of blu-ray features, or a significant quality enhancement.  That being said, I put it in my collection as the first copy of the film owned, and I enjoy the film for its ambitious attempt at making the zombie genre intelligent.

The Good: 28 Days Later is nearly a classic.  It has a unique style and independent feel about it.  It avoids any type of Hollywood approach and is born solely from the visions of Alex Garland and Danny Boyle.  The film may stray away from zombie traditions, but its originality does substantial justice to the horror genre.  They weren't afraid to redefine zombies or to avoid the name altogether.  The infected plague in London carries a lot of subtext about our own fears and desires, and it was a fresh burst of horror in the movie theaters.

The Not So Good:  The first half of the film really does not compare to its complimentary half.  The second half of the film is breathtaking, and it has a way of upstaging the first portion of the film.  Just for the sake of being well-rounded, I criticize the first half for being somewhat slow and quiet(the talking scenes were especially quiet and inaudible).  The balcony scene hits an all time low spewing dialogue that even Alex Garland(the writer) regrets.

But take my approach as a positive one.  There's nothing bad about the film, I only argue that there are some parts significantly better than others.  I can watch this film multiple times and I would add it to my zombie culture timeline, if I had one.  You may want to pass on the blu-ray, but for the sake of abadoning DVD format I purchased this copy.  The good thing is that the blu-ray contains some special features and a commentary to make my purchase feel worthwile(a barebones copy would not do).  As a last note, I urge you to rent, tivo, dvr, or borrow a copy of the film and watch it before purchasing.  You may see it as an aquired taste, but it becomes a work of art.",1278547200,,2210,4.4725

The soundtrack, which I have including its sequel, is splendid. Each song fits perfectly into the scenes and the ambience is amazing. The ending, while I have seen mixed reviews from others, was quite beautifully done. Add in the song you have something to remember forever. Not the cliche ending most horror movies tend to have. This is the main reason why I added it into my library.

I also have the sequel, 28 Weeks Later, and although it was a good film yet not having Cillian Murphy return was a let-down for me, I find 28 Days Later to be my favourite.",1275955200,,879,4.425925925925926

1539280,5,B00005JMA8,"This one has gone down in my book as one of the top 5 movies I have personally ever seen. Not just for horrors. If I could only have 5 movies to watch for the rest of my life, this would definitely be on the list.

It is well acted, edited, written, special effects, direction, soundtrack. The only qualm I have is the final 5 minutes is a little too cut and dry and seemed a little bit of an add-on to please the masses. I later learned, that was in fact, what it was and there was another ending originally that was changed shortly before filming to make the movie more mass marketable.

Regardless, its up there with the original Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, all the real horror movie greats. I didn't see it until shortly after it was released on DVD when a friend brought it over to watch since we're big horror, especially zombie movie fans. These are not technically zombies per se, but there are enough similarities to throw it in the general category. That said, it is far more realistic than the average, even good zombie movie. The only real scientific impossibility is the speed at which the virus infects a person, which admittedly is an integral part of the plot. All else appears to be based on the idea of a ""super rabies"" type virus. It is unknown whether it was a natural mutation that occurred, or something engineered, but it doesn't matter. Either has a real, albeit distant, potential.

Cillian Murphy is fabulous in this movie. His character is well-developed and undergoes some changes throughout the story after several harrowing experiences. It can easily be included as a psychological thriller with the disturbing experiences of the characters and one can't help but wonder what they would do in this situation and wonder if they would survive, or better yet, if they would want to at all. The psychological aspect is nothing short of disturbing and might make you want to go out and stock up on any apocalyptic emergency sort of supplies you can get your hands on.

To add to it, the movie is peppered with a John Murphy soundtrack that quickly rose to one of my personal favorites as well. The music often has a very rhythmic heart beat sound to it, that rises and falls with the action perfectly. I often listen to it on my treadmill, since you just can't help for it to make you want to move just a little faster. It also included some appropriate operatic/symphonic pieces.

It is a little on the gory side, but that is one of its strong points as it doesn't strike me as gratuitous or intended purely for a gross-out/shock value. How could such a thing not be a little gory? Nature can be pretty ugly when it is kill or be killed. It's more of a national geographic gore, rather than a teen scream. And it doesn't contain the usual red paint or corn syrup like blood substitute of many a horror film, so if your stomach turns easily, you might have some trouble, but that is hardly not a reason to watch it. Just don't do it right after dinner.

I'll always go back to this one time and again when I just need to see a good horror movie, even if I can recite the script from memory. Even if you don't find yourself captivated and enthralled, I can almost guarantee that you won't be sorry you spent the time or money.",1268956800,,3266,4.435

It was shot in standard def to look blurry, soft, hazy and undetailed.  point is when Jim wakes up nothing is the same, its all out of focus.  When things turn more hopeful at the end it was shot in 35mm film which looks a lot better.  I have no problems with the transfer as it reproduces the artistic intent.  Audio is very good but not demo quality.  Extras are great the audio commentary is my favorite, the deleted scenes/pure rage featurette are also very good.  There is also animated storyboards, still galleries, a music video, 2 trailers for 28 days later and one for 28 weeks later.

Now the movie.  I found 28 days later to be a very well written and made film.  It is a very suspenseful viral outbreak film.  28 days later begins with a infected monkey biting and infecting a human rights activist from there the infection spread like wildfire.  fast forward 28 days Jim wakes up in a hospital and things are not right.  London is eerily empty when night falls things get worse.  28 days later is a study of how people behave under extreme circumstances.  People lose much of who they are as they struggle to survive.

1539404,4,B00005JMA8,"First off, my four stars are for the movie itself - an excellent re-imaging of the ""Zombie"" genre.

Now, onto the video resolution issue that many reviewers are complaining about.  I was also shocked when I rented this Blu-ray and saw the awful video resolution.  Basically, it's no better than a standard DVD except for the closing scene.

The reason: The film was filmed mostly in standard DV resolution, using a Canon XL1s camcorder (the closing scene being the exception - it was filmed in 35mm).  DV is very low resolution in comparison to HD or 35mm film, so the problem (if you consider this a problem) is with the source material, NOT the transfer to Blu-ray.  It was the director's decision to film in standard DV, so this is the best resolution that you will ever see of this film.

So, if you don't have this movie and the Blu-ray and the DVD version are the same price, I'd probably stick with the Blu-ray version just for future compatibility.  But, if you already have the DVD version, I would recommend just sticking with that copy for now because the Blu-ray version isn't going to offer any enhancements, other than the closing scene.",1262217600,190,1151,4.635467980295567

1539407,4,B00005JMA8,"Recently Danny Boyle won the best directing Oscar for Slumdog Millionaire, a worthy award winner in my opinion. Boyle is a director that never rests on his laurels, recreating genres every time he steps up to the plate. One of his most familiar is the polarizing dramedy Trainspotting, but he's also recreated the sci-fi movie with Sunshine, the kids movie with Millions and so on. Danny Boyle is a filmmaker worthy to be listed among the great auteurs like Scorsese, Hitchcock, and so on. With 28 Days Later... (unfortunately, often referred to as a ""zombie"" movie, though it's not) he tackles horror with excellent precision.

28 Days Later opens with scenes of violence being watched by a monkey on a TV screen as he lays strapped down in a lab. Extremist animal activists break into the lab in an effort to save the animals from being tested on only to find they've been infected with a highly contagious virus known as Rage. Disaster leads to death and devastation throughout all of London. Cut to Jim (Cillian Murphy) 28 days later, a bike courier waking up from a coma in an empty hospital. After wandering across London, bewildered by the lack of people, he's saved by Selena (Naomie Harris) and Mark (Noah Huntley) as he's being chased by the infected denizens of the city. After finding other survivors, Frank and Hannah (Brendan Gleeson and Megan Burns), they hear a radio broadcast from a military installment which houses other horrors for our survivors.

While often considered a zombie movie, and it borrows liberally from many past zombie movies, 28 Days Later is not a zombie movie. The infected in this movie are living beings, infected by a virus that similar to Ebola is communicable by blood, and has more affect on the brain than the physicality of a human being. This is important to the message of the movie as the virus represents something that is inherent in all of us and leads to social unrest and the breakdown of modern society, as the virus did in the movie. In this Boyle has done something that he does very well in every one of his movies: creates a great social commentary. Throughout the course of the movie we see that there are those who would fight against a society gone wrong, and those that would exploit it. Yet, while exploring the themes of moral ambiguity, Boyle never handles them with a heavy handed approach.

Having a moral/ social message is important to good horror in this reviewers opinion, but how the movie looks and feels is easily just as important to hold the viewers attention. Boyle chose to shoot the majority of the movie with DV cameras, giving the movie a gritty post apocalyptic type feel while also giving the movie a kind of documentary feel as well. On top of that, the DV camera also allowed for tricks that gives the infected an otherworldly look, making them seem scarier when they're bum rushing their ""prey"". The visuals selected to fill the frame also give you a glimpse at an alien world, a city, or a grocery store that should be buzzing with people, but because of the look of film, it seems even more eerie when you see it emptied of all presence.

The acting of course is top notch, as anyone whose seen Brendan Gleeson act would expect, but the movie really belongs to Cillian Murphy who had his break out performance in this movie. As Jim, a man who went down one day in a bustling city, and woke up the next in an empty city, Murphy shows the pain of a man whose lost everything before he even knew what had happened to him. Cillian gives us a man in the middle of a crisis that we truly believe his arc from a pained and scared man just waking up at the end of the world to a man who will fight through all hell to protect those he cares about. Naomie Harris, who also received great acclaim for this movie, portrays a strong woman struggling with her fear and sorrow, but always holding it in, trying to steel herself from pain to come. Also keep your eyes open for Christopher Eccleston, who will become the future Dr. Who a few years after this movie.

For as great as the movie is though, I do have my nitpicks. Calling the virus Rage seems a little too on the nose for my tastes, but luckily this isn't mentioned too often throughout. At the beginning there are also glaring plotholes in the scheme of today's society. Why is Jim the only patient to not be evacuated from the hospital? And why did they leave a comatose patient naked in the ICU? Why are there no cars left on the streets of London, or along the highways? A lot of this is due to the budget of the film, and can be explained away, but as there are no answers to be found within the actual narrative of the movie they must be left as plotholes. Luckily, as the only plotholes are mainly to be found at the beginning of the movie they do not detract from the movie as a whole, and will be forgotten by most by the end of the movie.

For fans of horror, and movies with a deeper socio-political meaning this is definitely a must watch, but think before you decide to show this to your kids. There is full male nudity, as well as a lot of cursing. But if you're looking for a captivating horror this movie is definitely for you.

I have argued it for years and it seems that there are still people out there who think this is a zombie when it is clearly not. This film is no were near being a zombie flick as the INFECTED are not dead they are just INFECTED with a virus that was put into monkeys. I don't know why people think of this as a zombie flick but what ever. This is indeed a great film and when it was released one of the scariest films in recent years. I remember seeing this and thinking man this is pretty intense as I was not expecting it. Still I found it to be a wonderful film experience and thought that it was deserving of the praise it was getting, most of the time movies are not.

For those who have yet to see this for some reason it is about a man who wakes up 28 days after a virus has struck the UK and turned most of the population into raging killers. The virus which is called rage I guess makes a person go back to their animalistic instincts and want to survive and kill, nothing else. At first the guy has no idea what is going on until a few infected come his way but luckily for him a few other survivors are there to help out. These survivors are a tough bunch and are just out looking for food and supplies and have no problem leaving our lead behind. As time goes on a people get picked off a father and daughter come into the mix and the film turns into a road movie. They make their way across the country looking for salvation based on a radio signal they picked up.

Writer Alex Garland did a great job with this movie taking a nice end of the world type idea and making it feel very fresh and very real. Director Danny Boyle did a great job converting the script and idea onto the screen. This film while not at least to me jump out of your seat scary it is still a very intense feeling film or at least it was when it came out. Acting wise one of my favorites ever Cillian Murphy is perfect for this film and did a marvelous job. Naomie Harris was excellent as well and did a great job as did Brendan Gleeson and Megan Burns. Every one in this movie did a great job and I can't stress that enough, great movie I think.

I had a lot of fun watching this when it first came out and still it is fun to watch right now, that's just me. Is this a perfect movie, that is up to you but I have a great time watching it. If you have not seen this then I highly recommend it to you, I say buy it and skip a rental. The look and style of this film is great and the road story that is involved in this is my favorite part of the film. The first part of the movie is the end of the world ""we have to survive"" which is defiantly the horror aspect of the film. Then we get the road flick that is the ""we have hope now"" part of the film which is the fun part of the film. Then we close it out with the dramatic thriller/suspense part of the movie when the army holds them captive. Could you ask for in a film, I think not.",1255564800,3,2935,3.9277310924369746

(UK - 2002)

Aspect ratio: 1.85:1
Theatrical soundtrack: Dolby Digital

Survivors of a virus which turns infected victims into murderous zombie-like creatures struggle to stay alive amidst the chaos.

High-concept horror from TRAINSPOTTING director Danny Boyle and novelist-cum-screenwriter Alex Garland (THE BEACH), produced on a modest budget and filmed with digital video cameras (transferred to 35mm for theatrical exhibition). Cillian Murphy is the hapless hero, compelled to join forces with a motley band of survivors (including Naomie Harris, Brendan Gleeson and Noah Huntley) who run afoul of an Army encampment run by well-meaning - but deluded - military officer Christopher Eccleston, whose rash behavior unleashes a fresh wave of horror.

Comparisons with the work of George A. Romero are inevitable, though the film's impact is blunted by rapid editing which curtails the violence and renders some of the action scenes incomprehensible in places. However, Boyle uses edgy visuals to keep the audience off-guard at all times, and the narrative builds to a satisfying conclusion. The opening sequence, in which Murphy stumbles through deserted London streets, is truly haunting.

This movie reminds me of those old Resident Evil video games.  Absolutely terrific and scarier than you can possibly imagine.

Some people might not like the fact that there's not a whole lot in the way of action, but honestly, there's a good deal of action sequences despite the fact it's not necessarily a totally action-dominated film, and the atmosphere that builds up to those action sequences is pretty terrific too, because you get a sense of constant uneasy feelings around every turn.  You really feel the main characters as they struggle to find a way to safety and survive.

The reason for such a harsh grade is the video formatting - the vast bulk of the movie looks terrible on Blu-Ray.  I mean terrible!  It looks like a bad bootleg, or something that was downloaded off the internet and then ""converted"" for the format.  I've seen VHS tapes look better on my screen!

For a perfect example, take a look at the scene right after they leave the store.  They're driving in the country side and pass a field of what I believe are flowers.  I can't say for sure because the picture is so garbled that all you see are pixelated, artifact-ridden blobs of colors swaying to and fro.

1539603,5,B00005JMA8,"When I first saw 28 Days Later, I was really shocked at how good it was. I thought I was going to be watching a zombie movie, but it's really not one (even though you can pretend they are, which a lot of people tend to do). In actuality, England has just been infected with a rage virus thanks to some PETA activists trying to rescue some test subject chimps. Ok maybe they don't work for PETA but you get the gist. And like the title says, within 28 days, all hell breaks lose and England is ravaged and destroyed by people who really should take a chill pill.

After the outbreak we meet Jim (Cillian Murphy aka Scarecrow from Batman Begins) who wakes up completely naked (why completely naked I don't know) in a hospital room and it seems he's just been through some surgery. After calling for help, Jim comes to realize he's the last person alive on Earth. Ok not really, but it really does seem like it at first. They did a great job of showing deserted cities and roads and making it seem like he is legend (see what I did there?!).  After some walking, he comes across a church filled with what seems to be a mass suicide. This was definitely a scene I cant forget mainly due to when he says `Hello?' and two infected look up at him really quickly and just stare. CREEPY. Plus lets not forget the priest. As he runs away he comes across a couple of uninfected who help him out. Together they try to survive and come across a radio signal broadcasting help and safety. Together they try to make it to this so called safety.

Some might consider the movie a little slow, but I enjoyed the pacing because I really did start to connect with Jim and some of the others. Watching it the first I thought there could've been a bit more action scenes, but after my second sitting, I believe I was wrong. I actually enjoyed just about every minute of it. Also the video quality is not great. Not horrible by no means either, but just not great.

The special edition I watched had 3 alternate endings. The first 2 were really dumb and could've been easily just ONE alternate ending. The third though was really good actually. But you have to sit through a story board and not live action scenes, but I promise you it was still good. It basically picks up where the military comes in, but there is no military. Instead they head to a hospital with their little rag tag group and try to save one of their own since the person has been infected. They are told that to cure the person, you have to take out all of his blood and replace it. But this was the problem the director (Danny Boyle) had. How the heck do you clean out all of the blood when one drop could infect you. It was funny to hear how Danny says it though. Nice idea though.

In the end I would say to definitely give this movie a shot, especially if you are a zombie fan (even though they aren't zombies) or an `end of the world movie' fan.

P.S. - Anyone read `The Walking Dead'? Great, great, great read for us zombie lovers.

It should not be offered in Blueray, and the graininess was constantly irritating on my large screen.  Possibly the lowest quality blueray I own except for some movies from the 70's and 80's.

I really wanted to like this film but it defies common sense.

First there is the rehashed storyline of animal rights activist releasing infected primates from a laboratory.

However, the defies common sense begins when Jim, a bicycle courier, wakes up after being hit by a car. Jim understandably YELLS for a nurse and when no one shows, pulls out his IV, gets dressed and walks outside his room looking for help. He sees evidence of violence everywhere and no people and without ascertaining whether the perpetrators were still around and whether the hospital staff have good reason to hide, Jimbo yells HELLO up and down the corridors while viewers cringe.  Why is Jim smart enough to gather/stock up the sodas/food from a broken hospital vending machine but this same prudence didn't compel him to be stealthy until he could figure out who/what caused all the violence? And why, when he is recovering from a coma/painful head injury and bleeding from a pulled out IV, didn't he yell HELP instead of HELLO?  And why, when he looks outside and sees a dead body next to an ambulance and someone walking in the background, didn't he yell HELLO to that moving someone if he felt safe to yell it everywhere else?  Instead, Jimbo walks out into the streets sees overturned buses, more obvious violence and front line newspapers screaming danger and proceeds to YELL HELLO again.  No prudent person would do this.  Jim then wonders into a church, see lots of dead bodies and several people moving about suspiciously and while the prudent person might wait quietly to see who are the good guys versus the bad, this idiot yells HELLO at the top of lungs again.  He didn't yell hello when he sees one dead person by an ambulance with a single person walking by but feels its just fine to yell HELLO in a church full of dead bodies with several moving people?  Not un-expectantly he attracts Ragers and is saved by Mark and Serene who up to this point survived quite well without Dumbo around but they decide to save him and he rewards them by YELLING over and over again as they are running ""What is going on"" giving away their position.  Once in their hideaway, Jim bangs and yells on their window possibly giving their position and crying he wants his mommy and daddy-like they don't care about their families.

At this point, one wonders if both the Rage and Dumbo's stupidity isn't contagious because Selena and Mark stupidly placate Dumbo and risk their lives taking him home only to discover his parents committed suicide.  Now prudence would again dictate that everyone sleep in the same room but this Dumbo suggests sleeping in separate rooms and is overruled by Selena.  Then this idiot defies logic again and proceeds to watch home movies of his parents with the TV on loud and flickering though the windows.  Dumbo also carries a flickering candle. If there is electricity to run home videos, why was he using candles?  Predictably the Ragers are attracted to the noise/light, break in and Mark and Selena wake up and save Dumbo's life again while he cowers.  Mark is bitten and is killed by Selena while Jim stupidly/cowardly watches.  Selena is now stuck with a weak ninny of a partner instead of Mark. She even has to tell Dumbo to get his clothes and get ready to leave as more infected will come thanks to him.

Selena and Dumbo see apartment building lights and head there.  Dumbo lost his bag of food and carries only a bat while Selena carries both a weapon and a food/medicine backpack. As they climb the apartment stairs, they hear the infected and Selena hauls butt but Dumbo repeatedly YELLS WAIT UP pinpointing to the infected exactly where they are.  Dumbo and Selena are saved by an apartment survivor named Frank but to their discredit leave him alone to fight off the monsters they led to him.  Frank survives and he and Hannah, his child, give them shelter in their apartment.  Frank took the calculated risk that even though his Christmas lights would attract the infected, they might also attract people to help him escape the building with his daughter as they could not do it alone.  Bad luck for Frank's small family to hook up with Dumbo.

Wise Hannah and proven survivors Selena and Frank have to persuade wimpy fearful Dumbo to leave the apartment and go to an advertised military location.  They escape in a taxi which Frank drives like a tank until they have flat tire. With Frank and Jim lifting the taxi, Hannah and Selena change the tire and they barely escape the ragers.

At this point, again one wonders if Jim's stupidity isn't contagious because survive by their wits up to this point Hannah, Frank and Selena behave stupidly.  After barely escaping, they stop at a large glass fronted grocery store where they do not post a look out but instead joyously run wildly up and down the aisles making lots of noise in full view of the street and luck is with them - no infected.  Later, they stop at a parked gas tanker and this time Selena smartly acts as a lookout while Frank siphons gas and Hannah is told to stay safely inside the taxi.  Predictably Dumbo leaves the group to wonder around alone jokingly looking for a ""cheeseburger"" after Marlene tells him to stick together.  Dumbo walks into the gas station, sees a dead body with evidence of violence all around proceeds to do what he does best YELL HELLO! This time he is attacked.

Later, they all sleep outside in the open, defying common sense, and build a nice fire to attract lots of monsters but luckily none show up.  Even more stupidly, Dumbo wakes up Selena to ask how she is sleeping when he and Hannah cannot.  Defying life and death common sense, the normally smart Selena gives Dumbo Valium and Dumbo persuades the normally smart Frank to let him give young Hannah Valium also. Dumbo laughingly says they won't care if they get attacked now.  Monsters are crawling all over and they take Valium?  Worse, Frank stays up all night keeping watch and Dumbo and Selena don't offer to spot him.  Next day Frank is cranky from lack of sleep and gets angry when there is no one at the military area.  Frank goes off by himself, gets annoyed by a crow and kicks a wall causing a drop of blood to fall into his eye from a hanging body infecting him.  Selena doesn't have her weapon and yells at Dumbo to kill Frank with his bat and the idiot hesitates so soldiers kill Frank.

The contrived ""romance"" between Selena/Jim insulted viewer intelligence. Their kiss was reminiscent of the kiss between Marie Presley/Michael Jackson.

The soldiers take them to their compound where the major actually cups Dumbo's head in his hand like a child treating him exactly like the moron he is.  And, one realizes if Hannah and Selena hadn't been with Jim, this major would put Jim (with his large expressive eyes/hairless body/delicate frame) into a pink striped kitchen smock and forced him into the existing ""role"" the cook there was already performing.

It defies viewer's logic to believe this ineffective wimpy Dumbo escapes the soldiers (and later miraculously his large black plastic or metal handcuffs) and saves the girls from being sex slaves.  They escape; settle in a not so safe place as cameras pan in on roaming monsters and then pan in on child Hannah working outside all alone.  Viewers cringe again as no reasonable adult would allow this.

Naturally, they make a huge sign to signal a plane and the sign doesn't say SOS or HELP but says HELLO!  Defies common sense.

I remember when 28 DAYS LATER was in theaters. After about a month or so, the television ads were up to a full minute to a minute and a half long. They were packed with sterling reviews, thrilling speedy zombie cut scenes, and the promise of three possible endings! A few friends of mine went to see the movie five times so that they could see all three. They weren't the only ones, either. A ton of my friends were quick to say things like, ""You, of all people, will love this movie!"" Hype hype hype. If there is one thing I can't stand is every one and their grandmother telling me I have to see one particular movie. Given, hyped movies are either as good as or ruined by the hype and that ratio is hovering around 50%. However, this movie falls into the latter. It wasn't the worst movie ever (close, but at least it had a budget), though right from the start I had issues. Now, I'm down with the idea that some hippie, animal liberation bozos would end up destroying society, but the whole first scene was laughably bad. I will admit, the movie did started becoming promising, but only to rot away and FAST! I personally don't see how this movie is any different than DAWN OF THE DEAD other than the fact that DAWN was a criticism on consumerism and 28 DAYS was a commentary on...sex?...I think. ""Soldiers are horny"" seems to be this movie's overall message, or at least ""the apocalypse will make men do morally ambiguous things to satisfy their libido."" Thanks. I think all of us zombie fanatics could have figured that one out on our own. In the end, this is just the arrogant sods that brought us that sterling example of cinema THE BEACH (and the director who, in my opinion, butchered Irvine Welch's novel TRAINSPOTTING) exposing a trite taboo. I've seen some trashy zombie films in my day, but at least none of them took themselves so horrendously serious.

I've been reading the glowing reviews of this movie, and I'm a bit perplexed by some of them. I've read that it plainly deals with the hopelessness of the situation...as if DAWN or even RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD didn't. There's nothing particularly special about this movie.

Talking about RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD, I think it's total bull to declare 28 DAYS as the introduction of the ""Fast Zombie."" There were plenty of zombies running around in RETURN and ROTLD PART 2. How about the scene when all the zombies bum rush the cops? There are two separate scenes of zombies bum rushing cops in ROTLD, and another one when they take out the paramedics! So what, we should give credit to 28 DAYS because some of the zombies were superhumanly fast? We should give it full marks for making them faster? Please.

Also, I've read that the movie's landmark because it doesn't rely on violence. Instead it relies on changing a tire really really quickly so the stampeding herd of zombies don't infect you. Come on! This is supposed to be tension? It was like watching NASCAR! I didn't hate this movie because it lacked gunfire or bombs. I hated this movie because it was a boring, watered down rip-off with the moral rudder of a prudish eighth grade girl. Besides lacking action, it also lacked any semblance of suspense, drama, or intrigue. Oh, and how about calling the disease ""Rage?"" How hokey can you possibly get?

I will say that the sequel looks interesting, not that I'm going to pay theater prices to see it, but I will definitely give it a try on DVD. As for the predecessor, I'll just leave it for the monkeys.",1232409600,,3515,4.546603475513428

AMAZING experiences, all of them. BD really makes a difference on a big screen. I also rented a number of recent releases, and each one of them stunned me in clarity and color and contrast. So after all that, I assumed that all BDs were amazingly superior to their DVD counterparts. Given that assumption, I was so excited when 28DL came out on BD. I LOVE that move, and I have it on DVD. I wanted so bad to see it in glorious HD. WHAT A COMPLETE JOKE! If anything, this BD looks WORSE than the DVD. How can they get away with selling this on BD?! I wish I'd read the reviews before purchasing this turd.

I did learn a valuable lesson though: not all Blu-Ray disks are created equally. Read some reviews before purchasing a BD, assuming it will be better than DVD -- or in this case, VHS.

1539641,5,B00005JMA8,"A lot of these reviewers seem to think that this is not a zombie movie. Well, of course not. For one, it has more substance, and for another, it's original.

This movie does not just take from other zombie movies. It's not all just about scaring people and showing hundreds of pointless people get eaten. There are real characters whom you learn to care about. It's not gory and gross but thrilling; when something bad's about to happen you're going to be scared for the main characters rather than wonder how gross it's going to look. Also, there are problems among the normal human characters as well, making it even more realistic and interesting. The zombies in this movie are just people who have been infected with a virus that makes them extremely violent and blood-thirsty, as well as fast. These zombies can easily chase you down, which adds to the thrill.

The plot is not necessarily about looking for a cure but about staying alive, staying together, and finding others who are alive. Unfortunately, in the journey to do so, a group of uninfected people end up being worse enemies to the main characters than the zombies are. I liked this movie a lot because of the unique plot and because it actually gets you to feel for the characters and hope everything works out for them. Also, the acting is good and the directing and picture were very uniquely, interestingly, and artistically done.

The aspect of a virus causing all this makes it more realistic than other zombie movies and therefore more thrilling. This movie really makes you think about how humans treat each other as well. There were several human interactions that could have gone differently that would greatly change the way this was portrayed. If you are skeptical about this movie, I just recommend that you see it for yourself and don't let someone else's opinion limit you.",1230508800,,1856,4.75776397515528
1539642,4,B00005JMA8,"I loved the opening to this movie, where the main protagonist walks around in a completely isolated Britain.

He quickly gets acquainted with the few survivors, one of which is a family.  They get a signal saying there is hope in Manchester, and proceed there making every dumb horror movie mistake in the book.  How could they be so stupid as to drive through an underground road?  Why would the main characted just decide to meander into a dark convenience store.  They acted so dumb sometimes I almost wished they would get killed off.

The main villains in this story don't end up being the zombies, but fellow human beings, and leads an interesting study in what happens to humanity when stripped down to the bare essential question of ""What future do we have""?  In this case, what does a group of soldiers have for a future with no women to create a future with?  What happens when they get two women, and they have no interest in what the soldiers have in mind?  What's scary is that what the Leader of the Squad says isn't unreasonable, deranged yes, but not unreasonable, and shows the terrifying repurcussions when traditional society is destroyed.

There were too many plot holes to make this an excellent movie, such as never explaining other than plot convenience why the infected only attack in the dark, and why they only attack others that are not infected.  The latter could be said for all Zombie flicks, but given this is a ""rage"" virus, it makes even less sense here.

I did have one major objection, though. Everything was too pristine. They did a good job of making the hospital look ransacked and doing the same for a few other locations that needed to be creepy so things could jump out at the main character, but at other times they show streets, stretches of highway, and whole city blocks where there are no crashed cars and no dead bodies.

More annoying to me are the constant extremes in the sound track. There are any number of hushed conversations that I can't even hear, so I don't know what they're saying. Then a door will close and it's frighteningly loud, way beyond any half-way realistic sound mixing.

I was obliged to ride the volume control constantly, upping it to try (sometimes in vain) to hear the dialogue, downing it frantically when the sound would suddenly screech off the screen at me.

Some of the images are praise-worthy as well, especially of the horses, the ""bright sunny day"" over the typical ""doom-and-gloom"" feel of most horror movies and just an odd soundtrack that, while it doesn't seem to fit in a horror movie only makes it that much creepier.

If you want a bloodbath, watch the sequel, 28 Weeks Later, which is much more intense, bloody, and violent, but just as intelligent and well made, with many hailing it as an on par sequel, a rarity in movies, especially.

If you pay attention to the first couple of minutes of the movie, it is very clear where the virus comes from (and that's why I am sure this could definitely happen if they keep doing stupid experiments on animals).

Anyway back to the movie! The acting is great, even though the actors are relatively unknown. It's one of those movies that has so much going on that it seems much longer than it actually is. If your brain cannot process a lot of information then you probably won't like it. But if you enjoy a more serious plot and psychological suspense instead of million-dollars-worth-of-destruction kind of action, then this is a great option!",1212192000,,1156,4.579710144927536

1539736,5,B00005JMA8,"For me, the best horror is that which touches on those things which, whether in reality or in the mind's eye, could be true. Some people find blood and gore, the ability to invoke the best (or worst, depending upon how you look at it) gross out reactions, as the definition of great horror. And while 28 Weeks Later, like it's predecessor,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/28-Days-Later/dp/B00005JMA8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">28 Days Later</a>, has enough gore to satisfy those with a love of such things, the movie is one of those seemingly all too rare gems in which the very story itself, and not the special effects or the star power of the lead actors, carries this film.

The story picks up six months after the previous film, during a time when humanity is picking up the pieces after the ""Rage virus"" decimated Britain, a horrible plague that turned anyone infected into a raging, zombie-like menace in a matter of seconds. It begins with a flashback to the time period of the previous film, where we find a man, his wife, and some friends being trapped in he infected zone trying to survive the plague-ravaged landscape around them. Not so surprisingly, their luck quickly runs out, and as most everyone is killed, the husband, in what I thought was a disgusting act of cowardice, leaves his wife at the mercy of these monsters and runs to save his own neck. Then we flash to six months later, the jumping off point for this film, when the man is reunited with his son and daughter, who had somehow been saved from the danger zone prior to the incident with his wife. The man tells the kids that their mother is dead, which is a reasonable expectation considering the predicament he left her in. But later, after the kids sneak back into the danger zone to retrieve mementos from their former home, shocks, surprises, and more await, setting in motion the tragic adventures that befalls these kids throughout the rest of the film.

28 Weeks Later is, on the surface, just a well-made zombie flick. But it's more than that. In the film, we explore the possible ramifications of what might happen if a virus like the Bird Flu, or some other unstoppable plague (natural or manmade) were to emerge into the global arena. No, we won't see some mysterious disease that will miraculous transform man into beast at the blink of an eye, but in 28 Weeks Later we see the panic, the confusion, the brutal forms of martial law where many might be sacrificed to save many more. Imagine having to decide whether to save a human life begging for help, or to slaughter this person because you can't take the risk of getting infected by them, should they be a carrier themselves. Unlike this mystical ""Rage"" virus, a real plague won't manifest itself in such an obvious way, so how will we know who is safe and who is not? How will we choose whom to save and whom to forsake for the greater good? This world has faced such plagues before, and scientists say that it will eventually happen again. We hope and pray that with today's modern technology and techniques that we can head off any potential disaster in time, but the very same technology could be used to create such a plague, one specially built to defy the very measures we have in place to stop such a thing.

When a horror movie leaves me with these kinds of deep thoughts long after having watched it, that's when I know that the movie was good. If you like visual horror, this film has plenty (in my opinion, more than it needs) to satisfy you. But beware. You might come away not so much afraid of the monster hiding under the bed, but fearing the ticking time bomb lurking in the inevitability of our far too real future.

1539737,5,B00005JMA8,"A lot of people automatically credit this movie with inventing the fast moving, overpowering zombie. Undoubtedly, the images presented by Danny Boyle of his Rage-infested, ticking time bombs are chaotic and very troubling to watch. Most see this and think in the back of their minds that `when this goes down -- they won't have a chance'. I feel the same way. Seemingly guns, bullets and shelter don't help in any case. The best bet looks like a underground bunker, but good luck on finding one.

For the record, John Carpenter's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ghosts-of-Mars/dp/B00003CY6P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ghosts of Mars</a>&nbsp;in 2001 brought out the maniacal and unstoppable undead to the screen for the very first time. While `Ghost of Mars' is a very dark and also very troubling film, due to its spiritual angle, it's very forgettable. I was put into a very uneasy state when I saw it in the theatre, but I was forever put into a state of alert after seeing 28 Days Later.

The use of a digital camera, hand-held throughout, was cutting edge when Danny Boyle did it for the first time, now Paul Greengrass seems to have made a career of copying his techniques. Note to the theatre going film elite: Greengrass may be good at what he does, but just remember what he did before the release of 28 Days Later is completely forgettable.

28 Days Later is hands down the best Zombie movie ever made. The realism  is frightening and dark. The high water mark may be so high in this that others trying to emulate it may only get within groveling distance.

Some may have seen this and thought: ""hey that'll never happen. It's fiction."" Yeah? Think so? Just watch the attached documentary in the special features and you might be scratching your head and looking for the gas cans. Maybe we won't have to fight  off zombies, but being wiped out by plague is a highly possible and very probable future scenario.

The viral factor itself is the primary defining twist. There is something extra horrifying about the zombie equivalents' mindlessness being the product of rage rather than Romero's characteristic blind cannibal hunger.

Otherwise, it's really a slightly more hopeful-ending homage with brilliant takes on classic moments like the oh-crap-you're-infected scene, survivors proving to be worse than the infected, or the grim slaying of a kidbie.

My only real gripe is that it's never explained why the enraged don't kill each other off. I have my own ideas but I do wish the movie had at least asked itself the question. Also, there were moments where I wish I'd been a little more surprised by humanity. Still, a great modern take on a classic subgenre that deserves a place next to classic Romero and the DotD remake.

More often the film is tedious.

1539803,3,B00005JMA8,"Maybe ""28 Days Later"" is so disappointing because it had so much potential. At its core, the film is a bleak, brainy British update on the social commentary George Romero used to be so good at. The lead characters, in fact, are fleshed out even better than those of Romero's classic zombie films, and the film definitely has it's thumb on the paranoid pulse of the 21st Century. Throughout the first half of the film, I was literally on the edge of my seat, and I believed all the hype. I was prepared to love this movie.

Then the film suddenly veers from its pseudo-indy tone into a type of Hollywood filmmaking that is nauseatingly overfamiliar. Cliche after cliche follows: A formerly mild-manner character suddenly turns into a Rambo-like superwarrior; a formerly strong female character turns to emotional mush; a team of crack career militarymen seem incapable of firing their guns straight; a quirky supporting character is killed onscreen to prove the severity of the threat. I know it may seem odd to complain about a certain subplot that comes up near the end as being ""sick"" especially as this is a zombie film, but I found the soldiers' plans for the female characters to be very, very offensive
and seemed to exist only for shock value.

While this is a great movie by the standards of ""Resident Evil"" or ""House of the Dead,"" this could have been so much more. I was very, very disappointed with ""28 Days Later.""",1201392000,3,1426,4.7

1539873,4,B00005JMA8,"I'll not rehash the plot, as so many other people have graciously done MANY times over--even to the point of spoiling the movie for those who haven't seen it. Why people feel the need to ruin it for others I will never know.  Unlike a comedy or action flick, when a movie is a suspense the worst thing you can do is summarize or discuss it.  That is as good as revealing what is going to happen.  Duh!! I caution to read through these reviews at your own risk.  Several I've read will definitely spoil watching the movie for you, assuming you don't want to know what happens in a movie before you see it.  Thankfully, I read them after I watched the movie.

Instead of ruining the movie for you dear folks, I will just tell you why I liked it: I cared about the people; their plight was harrying enough that it held my attention all the way through; and I really wanted to know what happens to them.

The movie did a good job in creating suspense.  Would they all survive or would only some of them survive?  Where would they end up? What kind of life would they have?  Would love spring eternal between the two main characters? The questions mounted as the movie continued and as I grew more attached to the characters. I simply had to see it through to the end.

The zombies weren't often seen but added an eerie backdrop that created tension and suspense as I wondered when they would attack next.

It's funny, I almost turned the movie off during the first 15 minutes because the story was looking rather weak. I am glad I held in there because I soon realized that this is a character driven movie in which you follow the people rather than follow a storyline, per se.  Extraneous distractions were removed to allow the characters themselves to take center stage. Which is why the zombies were rarely shown, I surmise.  With the fate of humanity presumably on the line, the characters provided an interesting perspective on how people will react to their demise or salvation.

""28 Days Later"" is a terrific film but be aware that it was shot with a Canon HD camera and director Boyle degraded the image quality even more AFTER shooting to get a cinema verite look to the film. As a result, the Blu-ray doesn't look all that great (I imagine that ""Blair Witch"" should it ever arrive in a high definition format probably won't look all that great either). The last five minutes of the film was shot on higher quality video (or film I don't recall which)and, as a result, looks extremely good. Just be prepared for a shock when you see the film as it won't live up to films like ""3:10 to Yuma"" or even Boyle's own ""Sunshine"" because the format used to shoot the film.

The story is very familiar I'm sure but we'll revisit it anyway. Jim (Cillian Murphy)a bike messenger awakens in a completely desserted hospital after surgery. He ends up walking the empty streets of London where a disaster clearly has occurred. Jim finds that the city and most of England have been infected with a man made virus Rage that turns people into zombie-like killers interested only in infecting, eating or killing others. Jim and trio of survivors make their way through the countryside trying to discover if anyone else has survived this epidemic.

The Blu-ray has the exact same features as the original DVD. Surprisingly, my DVD looks better upconverted than the Blu-ray. Great movie just be prepared that this won't look as good as ""Blade Runner"" or ""Troy"" (or even the sequel ""28 Weeks Later""). This isn't the Blu-ray I would break out to sell the merits of ANY high definition format. The fact is that Boyle meant for this to look like this.

Regardless, the film is terrific and Danny Boyle's taunt direction of Alex Garland's script creates an often terrrifying, suspenseful tale. Look for Christopher Eccleston (""Dr. Who: The First Series"", ""Heroes"")as a military commander who has created a bizarre, sterile Eden for his soldiers and Brendan Gleeson (""Troy"", ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"", ""Kingdom of Heaven"", ""Bravehart"")as a father who's only interest is in keeping as normal a life as possible for his daughter and getting her to safety.

This is a well made, tauntly directed film. As long as your expectations on the quality of the video are adjusted, you'll enjoy ""28 Days Later"". Keep in mind the source (Canon HD handheld video camera-except for the conclusion which looks extremely good and is the only part of the film that was shot on 35mm film).

I'd give the film itself 5 stars but the ""look"" 2 stars it is, however, supposed to look this way.",1199145600,10,2645,4.70194384449244
1539877,3,B00005JMA8,"OK, so they aren't zombies, exactly.

""Jim"" wakes up naked on a hospital bed in an silent ward. Donning some scrubs, he wanders outside into empty London streets. Newspaper headlines blare about evacuations, and bulletin boards are filled with longing pleas for information about the missing. What is wrong becomes more apparent when the sun sets and Jim is beset by a group of wild, thrashing, blood-eyed attackers. He rescued by a pair of strangers wielding flamethrowers, and the film is on.

Director Danny Boyle has put together an exciting piece of work that combines the thrills of the science fiction disease genre (a la Andromeda Strain) and the anarchic wackiness of zombie films. His small group of survivors is desperate to find shelter, to avoid contamination and to find others of their kind. Luckily for them, the empty city provides ample food and transportation to do about anything they want, and they head out of the city to follow a faint radio beacon promising safety.

To say more is to give too much away. The movie stays fairly believable until about midway, when its lapses increasingly into silliness and implausibility. For all their supposed ""pure rage,"" the infected people could have used a bit more dionysiac, limb-rending fury. And a subtext about dolling up a pair of females before ravishing them seems (in the face of constant threat by crazed zombies) to be an unnecessary and titillating diversion.

But ""28 Days Later"" is entertaining, well-acted (Cillian Murphy as Jim is terrific, especially as a befuddled ex-patient) and tries to be intelligent about a ludicrous situation.

You see the street is deserted and 10 mins later you figure out pretty much all of London is deserted. You then realise you might be the  only living (sane) thing within miles. Basically we are informed there was a mass exodus from London due to the onset of the pandemic: ""the rage"" virus which is passed on by transmision of blood or bodily fluid (even saliva). If blood or saliva is orally ingested or if it comes in contact with cells of the body, the infected gets turned into a zombie in 10 seconds and will kill even his nearest and dearest ones turning them into zombies as well. The backdrop of the story is the basic premise of many post holocaust movies. Most such movies deal with a post nuclear war era where the rebellious few overcome the odds of surviving in a devastated environment and live on to start a new civilization. The movie has this edgy character to it. Danny Boyle (trainspotting, the beach, sunshine) shoots the movie in Digital video. Some scenes have this grainy resolution of a home digital camcorder. The movie sustsains interest because it is not a mindless zombie flick. The zombies in this movie are not mindless walking targets of ""dawn of the dead"" which can be just popped off with a push of a trigger. They are swift, ferocious and very very deadly in a matter of seconds . They come at you relentlessly. They are fast and furious and they are hungry. Good movie...got me to the edge of my seat.

I can't believe the women didn't go along with the soldiers' plan. They would have been protected, fed, sheltered and guaranteed to have offspring. If they had just a bit of smarts they could have spun that situation so that they enjoyed a somewhat powerful, comfortable position in a world gone to hell. Instead they chose to face the continued, exhausting threat of being eaten by pseudo-zombies.

In general, people will do anything to survive and Selena says as much early on. Even if it means having servicing someone they don't particularly like. Carnal, unromantic, and harsh but a biological reality none the less. We wouldn't be here now if it weren't.

If that sounds like something too profound to be jammed into a mere 113 minutes of film, think again. Director Danny Boyle once again uses a novel of Alex Garland as the basis for a movie, but this time the novel's story is much more effectively adapted into a screenplay, as it is Garland himself who writes the novel's screenplay. This seems to be the key distinction lacking in 'The Beach' that prevented it from being a more effective movie conversion.

'28 Days Later' begins with a viral form of rage being released by animal rights activists and then to a nearly empty hospital, populated by only a single patient who has been in a coma for 28 days. After stumbling about in the abandoned city of London, a scene that itself is very unsettling, Jim, played by Cillian Murphy, discovers that some mass evacuation has occurred on the British Isles. Jim eventually stumbles upon what can only be described as zombies, and is saved by a man, and a woman named Selena, who have somehow survived the plague. The man dies after being infected by the virus, leaving Selena (Naomie Harris) and Jim to deal with the aftermath of being two of conceivably, less than twenty uninfected humans remaining in Britain. The journey they embark upon is one that should not be missed by anyone who has ever wanted to see something more significant come from a zombie movie. This pair discovers a great deal about what it is to be human, what humanity is capable of when all authority is removed, and how people cope with isolation.

Brilliant acting from a primarily unknown pool of talent, great direction from Danny Boyle, and an impressively original idea from Alex Garland are combined to form this remarkable film. Perfectly complimenting these aspects is a soundtrack that many will not notice until it is pointed out to them, as it is so fitting to the overall movie that it tends to blend in perfectly.

1539971,4,B00005JMA8,"The main difference between say this and Romero's first two classic zombie films is that here the infected are able to run. This makes them much more dangerous than the slow moving variety in Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead. Indeed Dawn of the Dead has some strong black comedy elements to it because of the zombies slowness. No such luxury with 28 Days Later, its all pretty scary and relentless. The zombies in this film are humans infected with a Rage virus which can passed on by blood or saliva.

As most other reviewers have said the opening scenes in a deserted London are superbly done. Its hard to tell how much CGI work was involved to create the effect but I do know they had permission to close off one of the London Bridges for the early scenes.

In the action scenes the film is full of very fast cutting and editing techniques, which I don't normally like, but in this instance it fits in with the conditions the survivors are having to deal with perfectly. Danny Boyle racks up the tension and the film maintains a fast-pace so unlike a lot of films, this one seems shorter than its actual running time (108 mins).

Its certainly not for the squeamish, and if you are in any doubt about your horror film stamina, then I'd rent it first (unless its very cheap). However I strongly recommend it.",1195948800,,1323,4.436213991769547

1539973,5,B00005JMA8,"When I first saw `28 Days Later' I abhorred it.  I really and truly thought it was horrible.  It was not what I expected to see and for the most part was not what I wanted to see.  Then I watched it again because some friends were dying to see it, and knowing what I was getting myself into I actually found myself engaged with the film.  So I decided to watch it a third time and I was completely smitten with this utterly brilliant horror film.

Why the change of heart, drastic change at that?

Not ever really getting into the horror genre until recent years my mind had been dulled to the films of today with their big budgets and special effects and `28 Days Later' is no where near that type of film.  It's frantically paced, grittily filmed and ultimately much darker than anything released as of late.  The rawness of the films orchestration feels awkward at first, almost unfinished, but the truth of the mater is that it is the most accomplished horror film in the past decade, maybe longer.  It's smart because it plays on the audience and builds a solid foundation of fear cloaked in deep-seated human emotion.  The audience is constantly on the edge of their seat waiting for the worst to happen and when it comes we are leveled completely by the force.  It took multiple viewings for me to fully appreciate this film, but it is one of those movies that gets better with each and every viewing.

The film follows a group of sole survivors of an outbreak that has turned humanity into blood thirsty zombies.  As the group searches for a sanctuary they find that it is not just the undead they must be careful of, but that humans in general tend to unleash their dark side when despair and hopelessness take over.  The film carries a far more real feeling to it with the detail of the main characters.  These `survivors' are just normal everyday individuals.  There's no he-man heroics here, no femme fatales, just your next door neighbor, his father, best friend or worse yet, you.  It helps give the film a far eerier presence because you never know what is going to happen to those involved since they seem so unprepared for what's in front of them.

The acting is superb here, especially for that of a horror film.  Breakout star Cillian Murphy shows that he has the acting chops to go far in this industry, and recent years have only gone to further prove this.  The beautiful Naomi Harris also sizzles here with determination and a purely commanding presence.  I can't wait to see her sink her teeth into some more meaty material.  Brendan Gleeson is always worth the price of admission and this is no exception.

The true star here though is director Danny Boyle who creates a mood and establishes a fear that not too many directors in this genre seem to get and or understand.  Aside from Boyle I have yet to see a director truly create the perfect horror film.  `28 Days Later' is the perfect horror film.  It will haunt you long afterward and the images presented will take you to a place most horror films fail to take you.  I feel it's because of its sheer genius that one may at first be put off.  It's different than the trashy horror films we have gotten ourselves used to.  Give it a second or even third chance and I promise you will see the brilliance that lay beneath its gritty exterior.  `28 Days Later' is truly one of the best films to grace the screen in a long time, in any genre.",1193788800,3,3417,4.446945337620579
1539974,2,B00005JMA8,"This may not be a popular opinion, but this clearly is an over hyped, and disappointingly underwhelming movie. I mistakenly watched this because I love zombie movies and thought this was the newer ""28 months later"" - a better movie compared to this turkey.....

There are many reviews here that will go into the ""plot"", which is simplistic even by zombie movie standards, so I'll spare everyone the agony of reviewing that again, and simply say that if you really want to waste some time, have very low standards, and don't mind bad acting with boring ""action"", then rent this movie. On the other hand, if you're interested in better, as in night and day, almost incomparably better, zombie movies, watch the Resident Evil movies, Night of the Living Dead (gritty), and Shawn of the Dead which is a great parody of all zombie movies.

Boyle does an excellent job of directing Murphy from his hospital bed into a fight for survival in a new world.

Too bad 28 Weeks Later didn't follow suit.

28 Weeks Later is a good Horror movie, but a bad sequel. 28 Weeks (fledgling) director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo dropped the ball on several fronts...most importantly that the Rage Virus was supposed to be extremely contagious...coming into contact with just one drop of the contagion should render anyone 'infected'; part of 28 Weeks is the introduction of potentially immune people (just like in The Stand), and that was not lost on me. But there is 'infected' spatter everywhere and on everyone in this movie that seems to have no effect, and that takes away a lot of the realism and continuity that held true in 28 Days.

28 Weeks also fails in the way it delivers its scares. In Weeks there's lot's of scare moments that unnecessarily rely more on focusing on an image where one second their is nothing there and it's a deadly silent, then the next second there's a frightening image crashing into the shot accompanied by a loud ""PUNG!!!"" (like someone landing on the low keys of a piano). Granted, in DTS 5.1, it effectively knocked me of my chair each time, but it was quite dissimilar to 28 Days where the situations and images alone were enough to knock me out of my chair without the 'BOO!' effect.

28 Weeks also breaks down in the reality department where tight, military-secure areas are breached by civilians (including teenagers) and a Rage-infected person is not only able to breach dozens of secure areas, but also manages to appear everywhere in the movie.

It's the small (important) things like these that took a great movie in 28 Days and turned out an average sequel in 28 Weeks. So overall, Boyle's 5-star Horror/Drama goes to a 3-star Fresnadillo follow-up for me.

1540049,5,B00005JMA8,"I guess I would have considered this a 'zombie' movie, since the bad guys are not at all nice, and have definite problems (to say the least).  But it isn't a zombie movie, since zombies are the dead, come back to life.  The vicious killers in this excellent film are actually living, breathing, normal folks who happen to get rapidly infected with the 'Rage virus'.

I say that 28 Days Later is a ground-breaking film because it is such a departure from the 'Night of the Living Dead'-type of film, where the zombies are slow-moving, but relentless creatures with a taste for human flesh.  In 28 Days, the unfriendlies are angry, very angry, and they act out their most violet impulses on any human within grabbing distance.  These guys are FAST and terribly violent, and if you get a drop of blood in your eye, or in a cut, or breath in the virus particles, it's pretty much all over.  (Pretty much?  No, it's really ALL OVER, and you are going to act like Jack the Ripper on a very bad day.  28 Days is a smartly done thriller with tremendous tension that keeps your heart pounding the whole movie.

The film is well photographed and the Rage Victims are truly terrifying.  The don't shuffle along at a speed a snail could outrun, but the are fast and lightning-quick.  And they have one desire...to kill you.

(Of course no virus will take over your brain in, like, 10 seconds.  They need to replicate many generations to do their damage.  That's why you don't get a cold instantly when someone sneezes in your face.  Oh, by the way, make sure the sneezer doesn't have...the Rage Virus!)

The cinematography in this film is excellent.  It gives the film-goer a sense of loneliness, fear, affection, struggle and eventual survival (for some of the characters).  I suppose the only criticism would be that the virus can infect a person in 10-15 seconds, which is impossible.  But it does make it handy to tell if someone is infected.  If they go crazy and try to kill you, they are infected!

Highly recommended.  But be forewarned, this is often very bloody, very gruesome, and very graphic. This one will bear repeat viewing.  It's a must see.",1191801600,,2146,4.589473684210526

I would say the creepiest aspects of the movie are how fast the  infected move and how bloodthirsty they become. Only a handful survive and continue to do their best to stay that way.

I would definately recommend 28 Days Later for a change of pace in the horror genre.",1191542400,,559,4.235849056603773
1540051,3,B00005JMA8,"Ok, first and foremost...""28 days later"" is not a zombie movie, no matter how it was marketed, or reviewed or talked about. The bad element of 28 days are people infected with a viral toxin (rage), that causes them to succumb to extreme violent acts. They are not dead, or undead. The do not devour their victims. They are not rotting...etc.

While 28 days shares familiar territory with Romero's classic Living Dead movies and an introduction to the lead character ripped from Day of the Triffids, the zombie genre ends there.

What ""28 days later"" is, however, is a very good low budget suspense flick with a great opener, a good middle section and an ok ending. Which, despite being entertaining, kind of loses its way somewhat. It starts off well, documenting the actions that release the ""rage"" virus on the public and its scenes of a deserted London, with unknown unseen dangers, drips with atmosphere. People from London (or anyone whose spent some time in the city) could easily imagine themselves in Jim's dilemma, played admirably by Cork's Cillian Murphy.

Going into too much detail will spoil the suspense for those who haven't seen the film, but needless to say Jim eventually meets and runs away from the ""infected"", right into other survivors (including another Irishman Brendan Gleeson) who have been managing to hide out and stay ""normal"" in the face of overwhelming odds. Together, this group decide to hook up with a military outfit that has set up as the ""answer to infection"" up North in Manchester.

""28 Days Later"" has enough to hold the viewer for its duration. In fact, it rewards several viewings (I seen it three times now). But the budget constraints do show at times and the story does seem to run a little out of steam. It's very apparent that director, Danny Boyle, wasn't quite sure how to end the film and one is left a little let down at the films conclusion. This feeling may disappear however, now that ""28 weeks later"" is out and the second installment of the drama lets us into other areas of life in 'infected' Britain, although I have yet to see that particular episode.

All in all, ""28 Days Later"" is an effective and entertaining film, with some fine scenes...but it ain't ""Day of the Dead"", but then again, nothing is...",1189123200,,2265,4.724050632911393

Explodes and you have a post-apocalyptic story with some great shots of abandoned streets and markets and some good chase scenes taboot. Add some great film treatments and good camera work and it's an edgy flick with some nice emotional touches.

BUT! It completely fails to be a Zombie movie.

Aside from breaking all conventions in Zombie movies, there aren't any walking dead. Between 28 days later and 28 weeks later, we find out that the infected, although usually killed through conventional zombie means (remove the head or destroy the brain) can also drown, bleed to death, asphyxiate, die from being gassed, starve, and be generally mauled. All their primary bodily functions are still going and that's what keeps them alive. Zombies (as originally portrayed in Night of the Living Dead) die and then start causing trouble.

I was in for a real surprise, however, as we are taken through the story of Gwen Cummings, played by Bullock, who is sent to a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center.  At first she resists getting involved in the program, and refuses to admit that she has a problem, but as she gets to know her fellow patients and as she gets the chance to look deeper inside herself, she learns to accept that she does in fact have a problem, and only then is she able to have true hope for the future.  She then wakes up 28 days later in the abandoned hospital only to learn that the world has changed drastically while she was in her unconscious stupor, and most people have been infected by a horrible and extremely contagious virus that turns even the kindest person into a hate-filled zombie filled with uninhibited violence.

1540128,5,B00005JMA8,"This is one great movie.  I lived in London for several months and watching this great European city devastated in a so visually convincing manner was a unique experience to me.

The acting is superb, particularly that of Cillian Murphy who portraits Jim, a humble delivery man who had had a traffic accident, who is the film's main character.  (On a personal note, I think Murphy is soon to be recognized as the first-caliber actor he is.)

 In several days, 28 Days Later is also a breakthrough movie.  Unlike past zombie movies who heavily relied on actors moving awkward and slowly, this movie makes them FAST and all of preternatural stamina.  They ""infected ones"" also cough large amounts of blood, which can infect other people's membranes.  By adding this new, well-thought, the film makes the zombies waaaaay scarier.  Also, while the latter can barely think, they capable of enduring virtually any kind of pain --- including running with their bodies on blames.  Also the reason they became zombies (or, more appropriately, ""infected"") is because their bodies has a rare, experimental virus called the Rage Virus.  This man-made microorganism is transmitted in a matter of seconds by bites or by contact with membranes --eyes, mouth, and so forth.

All characters are deep, contrasting, and utterly convincing.  Jim is an idealist, ready to die for his love ones; Selena begins a pessimist who thinks humankind doomed, someone who would kill her own father, mother, or best friend to remain ""in the blink of an eye"" to remain alive for just one more day.  As time pass by, Selena is transformed by Jim's upbeat demeanor.  They meet a caring, generous man called Frankie and his obedient, timid daughter Hannah, who had survived against all odds because they have one another.  The four then decided to go near Manchester, where a cure has apparently been found  . . .

I agree with many of the reviewers: this is not really a horror film.  It's a tragic, deeply moving film with great innovations for the zombie genre.  Highly recommended.",1183507200,,2049,4.901162790697675

Zombies are the living dead, the monsters in 28 Days are living humans, infected with a virus. This means they can die any way a human would, making a more believable story. On a whole, the movie is more of a mystery than a horror film. Throughout the story your trying to find out more about the virus. In the beginning you see how it is released but you don't know that much about it or how it spread. And besides the question of what the virus is there's how far it has spread. The film takes place in England, and is thus isolated from the rest of the world leaving the question of whether or not the rest of the world has been ravaged. The acting is great as well, while the story revolves around the main characters fight for survival their emotions and relationships are clear. This movie is much more believable than movies like Day of the Dead or Resident Evil, and in my opinion much better as well.",1183507200,,1150,4.279816513761468

1540133,2,B00005JMA8,"I was very disappointed in this movie. It is dull. It is not scary. It has very few ideas, once you get past the main ones. I think it's safe to say that, despite what the ads promised, zombie horror remains steadfastly NOT re-invented, nor is this ""Scary as Hell.""

The problems begin soon after Jim, our protagonist, awakes. He wanders around empty London for like five minutes, as I thought ""This is getting boring."" Then the ALT-ROCK SOUNDTRACK (it survived the apocalypse!!) kicks in, and then he wanders around empty London for FIVE MORE MINUTES!!!! This is endemic of the whole movie: large, long sections with NO new ideas. I saw this in the theater, so every time I reached for the fast-forward button, it just wasn't there.

The zombies aren't that scary. The fact that they run fast adds surprisingly little, and it makes the slow moving zombies of previous movies just scarier. You know, dogs run fast. People run fast. Average movie monsters run fast. So these zombies running fast just made them more generic. And... what do they WANT? They want to puke blood on you? Doesn't make a lot of sense. I mean, I want to puke blood on people, so having zombies want to do it doesn't give me that much of a thrill.

I did notice that Jim, who woke up with half his head shaved from the hospital, apparently found time amid all that constant running from zombies to get himself a chic hipster haircut.

I think the writer and director had a few interesting overall ideas and felt like that was enough, there was no need to develop them or come up with new stuff to keep it interesting. With an hour to go, I considered leaving (as many in my audience already had), asking myself ""Do I really need to know how this ends?"" In retrospect, no, I did not. I haven't seen any of the additional endings on the DVD, because a) I don't care, and b) I could never possibly sit through this movie again.

I think what the reviewers who gave this one such positive reviews at the time were responding to is the originality and intrigue of the premise, and overlooking much of the result. As well as thinking it might be cool to give zombie movies a chance, since Dawn of the Dead [original] has grown so much in estimation since its release. Let's give the critics credit... they ARE required to sit through From Justin To Kelly, so anything a little bit different must look a lot better by comparison.

Towards the end there is an extremely ugly and vulgar subplot involving the gang rape of a young teen girl that in my opinion mars the movie as a whole. While it may make sense that this kind of thing could happen in the case of a zombie apocalypse, I also think that this is a movie, and there are plenty of other aspects left to explore without having to go to that particularly nasty and misogynistic extreme. I suspect the writer and director think they're being ""Hard Hitting,"" but it supplies more evidence that they confuse the jolt of shock and disgust with a genuine reaction.

I also think that arguments about ""what would happen in a zombie apocalypse"" are specious from the start because zombie apocalypses don't really happen. And if they did, Romero already showed us quite clearly and believably what would happen twenty years ago in both Dawn and Day of the Dead.

Sometime after seeing this movie I rented Trainspotting for the first time, and think that there's another example (like Silence of the Lambs) where the strength of the cast and script really is what makes the movie. That is to say; not the direction. I think Danny Boyle can safely be taken off our ""directors to watch"" list.",1181260800,2,3605,4.526881720430108
1540134,3,B00005JMA8,"I really enjoyed the first half of this movie.  It was so fresh and compelling I was already thinking of calling this the ""Dog Soldiers"" of zombie movies, as I felt it was looking just as good as that excellent recent entry in the Werewolf movie genre.  It also had echoes of the 70s Charlton Heston classic ""The Omega Man"", but nicely updated for the new millenium.  I couldn't wait to see where this movie would take us.

But unfortunately by the second half of this movie things degenerated rapidly as the writers lost their originality and resorted to a bunch of cardboard stereotypes in order to convey a highly preachy message.  As soon as I saw the new characters introduced in the second half I thought to myself, ""naw, this movie is too good to stoop to that kind of plot"".  But it turns out my worst fears were borne out and things descended in exactly the type of hackneyed direction I had feared.

In short, this movie had the potential to be truly great but instead settled for mediocrity.

Once this team reaches the compound the story goes flat.  I understand the idea of spinning a tale of survivalist compound, but the military characters are done in two dimensions, with many hoary stereotypes.  They are portrayed as primitive frat boys, when a much darker, Darwinian turn of the script is called for here.  Could you imagine if the commander had proposed it was their duty to start repopulating the earth...that would have been compelling.

The silver-grey dramatic lighting creates the dark and intense mood.  Jim, Selena, and Hannah move against the eerie lonely backdrop of an abandoned world trying to survive as more and more of the living become infected.

More chase scenes and zombie-human interaction would help up the excitement prior to the climax.

1540227,1,B00005JMA8,"28 Days Later begins when some foolish environmental activists/terrorists manage to unleash a plague of ""Rage"" upon England (and possibly the world).  The story then picks up 28 days later when a young man wakes up from a coma in his hospital bed that goes back to just prior to the outbreak.  As he, and by extension we, attempt to find out what's going on he wanders around London calling out ""hello"" repeatedly with no one answering.  While he ultimately manages to find other people as well as some infected unfortunates, it is striking how empty the entire city of London is.  Where did all those millions of people disappear to?  We never learn the answer to that question.  As the movie continues and we see the rest of England, we find it is similarly depopulated.  There are nowhere near enough corpses to believe everyone is dead and nowhere near enough infected to believe that everyone has turned.

I would gladly set aside an empty country if there were only something interesting happening in the movie to push it from my mind.  Sadly, the plot is almost nonexistent in this movie.  Very little actually happens.  Our small band of characters wander an empty UK and are very occasionally attacked but there is surprisingly little real menace.  When they finally find an organized band of military men, we find that man's inhumanity to man is alive and well as these ""saviors"" are arguably worse than the Rage infected maniacs.

The movie does an excellent job of blending these suspenseful moments with much brighter, happier scenes, as well, creating a truly full experience, not a hollow, cheap-blockbuster bang.

1540393,4,B00005JMA8,"""28 Days Later"" took a few viewings to really settle in as a good zombie movie for me.  During my first viewing, I was overly impressed with the beginning sequence when Jim(Cilliam Murphy) awakes from a coma to a desolate London and wanders throughout the street trying to figure out what is going on.  This is, without question, the best portion of the film.

Jim eventually wanders into a church and is shocked to find it's filled with dead bodies.  He is even more shocked when a group of ""infecteds"" chase him out to the streets of London.  This is where he runs into Selena and Mark; two survivors of the initial outbreak.  He is then filled in on what has taken place.

From here, the movie continues to provide a great depiction of post-apocalytic hell.  Jim and Selena(Mark dies :(....) meet up with Frank(my favorite character) and his daughter Hannah.  The four of them embark on a 2 day mission to Manchester, in search of a rescue station they heard about through a taped radio broadcast.  This is where I was first initally disappointed with the film.  The whole plot now switches.

Instead of finding refuge, they find that the deranged Sergeant has promised his 8 remaining soldiers women as a means of keeping them sane.  The film now revolves around Selena and Hannah's desperate efforts to avoid rape and Jim's efforts to rescue them.

Initially, I was disappointed with the turn the movie took, but after further viewings, I find this aspect to be rather unique and actually a good way of keeping this movie from growing stale with zombie chases, zombie killings, etc...  I'm reminded of George Romero's masterpiece ""Day of the Dead"", in the sense that we have ""regular"" civilians facing greater danger from the army/government than they do from the zombies.  Although not quite pulled off as well as in ""Day of the Dead"", the desperation felt by Hannah and Selena is dramatic and the felling of hopelessness is quite intense.

I'll save the ending for those who haven't viewed, but would recommend this film very highly and advise the zombie enthusiasts to view this one a couple times before giving final judgement.  As for violence and gore, this film delivers and there are absolutley no complaints in this regard!
Dialogue and plot are very good.  Acting is well above average for a horror film.  Setting/mood is possibly the best I've seen in a horror film and is what truely makes this film worth praise!

A film that at time plays like a frenzied docudrama, 28 DAYS LATER... is unrelenting, grim, horrific, and completely nightmarish. Images of violence against humans dominates the screen for a few minutes, and we soon learn these are televisions mounted against a wall, broadcasting non-stop footage of the inhuman things people do to one another. A monkey lies strapped down, facing these images, helpless. There are others in cages nearby. A band of environmentalists break in, predictably to free these imprisoned monkeys, but a conflict ensues as a scientist barges in and warns them it would be completely insane to do so -- they're infected with Rage. However, since scientists normally equal evil corporations and dehumanized technology known for cruelty not only against animals but humans, they proceed to free one of the apes... and total pandemonium breaks loose as the monkey viciously attacks its freer, and in seconds we see her eyes have become red. She is an infected.

And this is the simple setup for a movie that in 100 minutes frightens the pants of even a jaded person. To see shots of a deserted London magnified by shots of abandoned vehicles, overturned equipment, and a haunting collage of missing persons that recalls the scores of photos of the missing that did not survive the 9 - 11 attacks, is extremely disturbing and unsettling and made me squirm in my seat as Cillian Murphy's character Jim walks around town, having awaken about a month later from a coma. It's not reassuring for him to know he may be the only surviving person in the city, and soon he learns there are others out there... but not reasonable, frightened people as much as ferocious predators who will rip the flesh right off you, and if mercy takes over, you may die right there and then, because it only takes 20 seconds for full infection to take over and turn you into a raving monster.

That he is saved at the last minute by others who have survived the madness is his saving grace. These are Naomi Harris as Selena and Noah Huntley as Mark, who brief Jim on what happened in haunting monologues, and that Danny Boyle stays focused on Huntley's face as he relates to Jim his own story is flashback enough: it only heightens the terror that swept London and that is still alive and well. This prompts Jim to go visit his parents, maybe hoping they are still alive, and after a near-fatal encounter with an infected there in which Mark does not survive (Selena, absolutely committed to survive this, hacks him to pieces after quickly noticing he's been infected), they barely manage to escape more infected before meeting two other people, a bearish man and his daughter (Brendan Gleeson and Megan Burns). They have been listening to scattered transmissions that are indicating Manchester holds a possible refuge for survivors.

Once they make the decision to leave to Manchester the movie takes a turn and becomes a road film and involved a harrowing if somewhat implausible escape from London through a tunnel, where even the rats are running away from the sheer horror these barely seen people have become. That they eventually meet this fort in an already destroyed Manchester gives them little reassurance, which proves to be true as a small band of military guys lead by Christopher Eccleston have dubious intentions with the women.

And here is where Danny Boyle cleverly turns an apocalyptic movie into a study of the human race: can the people who are supposedly meant to protect us be actually worse than the ones who have fallen to a devastating plague? The answer, quite simply, turns out to be yes. That this makes Jim do a much needed transition from dazed youth to fierce survivor drives the point even more home: Rage wiped out most of the population, as a virus, but in given circumstances, is found quite well within us, and Jim becomes so filled with it at one climactic sequence it takes Selena a second before reacting that he hasn't yet been infected.

This is a very tense film. There are moments of quietude in a field, where sleep comes uneasy, and even that moment to me was worse than any of the moments when the infected actually sped out and after any of the characters. Seen in stroboscopic images, they becomes even more frightening than if seen as lumbering idiots. If the ending seems a little too upbeat, maybe it's only the decision Boyle and the screenwriters took after having us gone through so much gut-wrenching tension and clear calls, that it was only fair to have Jim, Selena, and Hannah survive and see a glimmer of hope at the end. Other than that, 28 DAYS LATER compresses the battles with good and evil in a world gone wild instead of going all over the place with too many characters like THE STAND and many others do. Intelligent, repulsive at times, unbearable, this was one of the best films of 2003. The DVD release has some nice extras, like alternate endings, deleted scenes, for those into investigating further into Boyle's dark tale.",1161043200,4,5045,4.77205040091638
1540397,4,B00005JMA8,"""28 Days Later"" is really just another take on any of George A Romero's works (Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, Day of the Dead).  However, what makes this work is the 'reality' of what (the normal/uninfected) people will do TO and FOR EACH OTHER.

The 'zombie' aspect of the movie is nothing more than a canvas that lets Alex Gardner (writer) and Danny Boyle (director) take us on trip in the minds and psyches of people under extreme duress - both good and bad...

As with any 'zombie' movie there are some obvious holes in the plot, the story and the filming (like where are all the dead bodies in the opening sequences...)  However this is more a social comment - so 'holes' like that don't matter...

As others have noted the cinematography is well done.  I especially liked the subtle use of lighting - to inform.  Both the mood and the action are choreographed well to the lighting in the scenes.

I was expecting a horror/blood fest - and instead was pleasantly suprised to get an intelligent social discourse...",1156118400,,1031,4.565217391304348

I loved Trainspotting .This was hyped as a zombie movie but it's not .Zombies are supposed to be slow moving forces of nature that are inescapable .These infecteds move like they are on fire nad most importantly are NOT DEAD. Anyway I like the story and the multiple endings that they made .The radically different ending is probably the best one but it wasn't filmed .Enjoy it for what it is , a good plague movie .",1155859200,3,510,4.322916666666667
1540399,5,B00005JMA8,"This movie is a perfect example of survivial horror at its best.  reasonably believable characters, no superwomen or ubermen here.  Just a poor little bicycle delivery boy Cillian Murphy is fantastic as he goes through the movie, a sweet sensitive kid who is still a survivor at the end, no matter how brutal it gets.

It touches a lot of things - there are some very sad, very tragic moments that seperate this from your typical 'zombie' movie.  The worst of the badguys in this film (other than the infected monsters) still come across as humans just trying to stay alive and reasonably sane - though whether they are or not is purely speculation.

This is not a gratuitously violent movie - there are reasons for every scene of brutality and homicide.  It is a 'character' movie, not a monster movie.  The movie is about people surviving, not about monsters eating people.

The extras are interesting - including alternative endings which i'm glad they didn't use, i think the movie as it stands is superior.

Now the warnings.  This is not a movie for children, or for people who are offended or sickened by violence.  It is violent, horrifically so, deals with a lot of things that children would really find frightening.  The lab scene in the opening of the movie might disturb those who are animal lovers.  And just the sheer brutality of the movie - there is a scene where a character has to deal with an infected child, and the climax of the movie is ruthlessly vicious.  In my opinion, delightfully so, but then, I like this sort of movie.",1155513600,,1549,4.626373626373627
1540400,5,B00005JMA8,"When I saw this movie I couldn't help but think, wow, this is very eerily similar to John Wyndham's book 'Day of the Triffids'. Many of the plot twists were the same: guy wakes up in hospital to find the world has been devastatingly changed and life as he knew it no longer exists, guy finds girl, guy and girl follow light and radio signals to find other people, pick up an orphaned girl along the way, and end up tangling with crazed military men. It's like in making this movie the writers morphed that book with the Romero movie 'Day of the Dead', and threw in a dose of scary plague as well, probably inspired by fears at the time of outbreaks of SARS and mad cow disease and the emergence of other hideous new illnesses in our world.

But even though this film is not exactly original, it is ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT, and oft-times very unpredictable! The characters are very easy to relate to, the scenes of a deserted England are chilling, the 'Infected' (as the plague-carrying zombie-like people are referred to) are absolutely terrifying, and the drama never lets up for a second. Also, there's a twist in its tail with an alternate ending, which screens after the credits, after you think the movie has already ended. It's stark, that ending, but one of the most powerful, original and logical moments of the film. I watched the whole movie on the edge of my seat. At one point I even actually pulled my t-shirt over my eyes, because I was too scared to watch. But there were funny moments too, and exhilarating moments, and touching moments. I was struck by the character traits of the few remaining uninfected humans. Some were brutally honest and realistic about what they had to do to survive. Some tried to cling to their former ways of life, hanging on to their old civilised ways of going about things, even long after the fall of civilisation. Some tried to take the middle ground, doing what was needed to survive, but trying to hang on to their basic humanity. Every character was a realistic, 3-dimensional individual. I felt like they could all have existed in the real world, and I was intrigued (and sometimes shocked) to see how they coped with their horrible new plague-struck world. I also liked that the female characters were strong, and didn't necessarily need a man to rescue them.

I'll admit, there were a few implausiblities about this film, like how the disease was so contagious it only had to drip in your eye or mouth or a scratch to infect you, yet some of the characters who were splattered all over their skin with infected blood didn't seem to feel the need to wash the blood off, or, if they did, would only wipe it off with a bit of paper towel or something. However, I was very happy to overlook the movie's little faults because I enjoyed it so very, VERY much.

I would thoroughly recommend this movie to anyone who likes good, exciting, well-made movies. If you see it with a date, you WILL get a cuddle, even if it's only because they're clinging to you in fear. I would also recommend this movie to any fans of Dr Who, since it stars Christopher Eccleston. However, don't expect him to be anything like the fun-loving, Northern-accented Doctor -- in this, he has a very different accent, and a VERY different temperament. Plus (and this would no doubt delight the current incarnation of Doctor Who) he's a ginger.",1154131200,,3361,4.589018302828619

Good movie with a reality feel to it. I was disappointed by the zombies (err, I mean infected) because I didn't understand their basic goal. I mean they just ran around lunging at people, but didn't stay to enjoy the snack or stay to rip them apart.  It was like ""Oooh, a person! let me bite/bleed on them.  Oooh another person let me bite/bleed on them, etc.""  If the infected were so consumed with rage, wouldn't they want to inflict massive amounts of dammage to their victims?

Also they should have gone into a bit more explanation about what happened to the rest of the world.  Was it only that area that was infected?  Did it spread to other countries?

1540455,2,B00005JMA8,"28 Days Later was one I skipped in theaters because I won't see any more videos badly blown up onto 35mm because some director's convinced himself it looks better than film while the studio saves a few bucks on processing. I'm glad I did, because judging from how bad it looks on DVD it must have been nigh on unwatchable on the big screen. Close-ups are fine, but anything more than a two shot and the lack of depth and detail (not to mention the problems with any straight lines that are anything other than perfectly vertical or horizontal) is a major irritation. The major casualty is any sense of scale - with the long shots looking so horribly flat and lifeless, most of the film is played in medium shots, which means in effect you're watching a TV show with worse picture quality than you'd get on a game show. Rather than the sense of immediacy the makers claim, you're just left at a distance from much of the film because you're too busy squinting to try to work out the background detail.

The film itself is utterly predictable in every way - you know who'll die, what the plot twists will be and exactly where and when they'll happen - but aside from the substandard visual quality and the fact that it's basically 'No Blade of Grass' with zombies, it's actually pretty good until the finale, when Cillian Murphy goes all Rambo on squaddies and `infected' alike. Despite the horrible miscasting of David Schneider in the opening scene, the performances are very good, especially the erratic Brendan Gleeson as a London cabbie, which helps raise the bar. It's just a shame that the videography has such a deadening effect on the film.

If you want to see a really good British horror movie, however, track down Neil Marshal's The Descent instead.",1145750400,,1759,4.616613418530352
1540456,5,B00005JMA8,"28 days later really exceeded my expectations! The story of a virus turning people into zombie like monsters seems a little too much like the Resident Evil series, but there is a lot to keep you from making that connection. To wake up in a world all alone, like Jim does at the beginning of the movie, is a fear that no one wants to face. From the start, you know that this will be one memorable thrill ride. It is just incredible how the movie starts off setting the mood by almost complete silence, it almost feels like the entire country is abandoned. It's just incredible the way they present the monsters. There is a scene when the survivors are trying to drive to an army base and they get a flat tire in an underground tunnel. It's extremely dark and while they are fixing the flat in the dark, they see shadows moving coming from the only light being seen.

1540457,4,B00005JMA8,"So, did writer Alex Garland (The Beach, Halo) and director Danny Boyle (Shallow Grave, Trainspotting) re-invent the wheel with the release of the film 28 Days Later...(2002)? I wouldn't say so, but they did serve to give the medium in general a good, swift, revitalizing kick in the gonsaticles, something every genre needs now and again as to not grow overly complacent or stale. Appearing in the film is Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins, Red Eye), Naomie Harris (Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest), and Christopher Eccleston (Gone in Sixty Seconds, The Others, ""Doctor Who""). Also appearing is Brendan Gleeson (Cold Mountain, The Village, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire), Megan Burns (Liam), and Noah Huntley (Event Horizon, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe).

As the story begins we find ourselves in a research laboratory specifically one that seems to deal with chimpanzee monkeys. The lab looks relatively deserted (except, of course, for the test simian test subjects), that is until a small group of masked individuals enters...ah, the activists...anyway, a hapless technician walks in on the group and warns them some of the monkeys are infected with some particularly nasty and infectious virus known as `Rage', and that they should avoid letting the animals loose. Of course they don't listen, brimming with their own sense of self-righteousness, and one of the idiots gets bitten...by the way, I don't think they're idiots for their beliefs towards not using animals for such testing, but they are idiots for thinking it a good idea to let loose monkeys infected with who knows what...so much so I'd be lying if I said I didn't find some enjoyment in seeing the troupe reap the bloody benefits given their obviously overwhelming sense of self satisfaction. Anyway, it's 28 days later, as indicated by some text on the screen, and we're in a hospital. A man named Jim (Murphy) in a bed wakes and notices there's no one else around...the hospital is literally vacant. Not only that, but the city streets of London are the same. Newspapers indicate some sort of mass evacuation, but it seems not everyone has gone...a visit to a church yields a meeting of sorts with a few crazed, bloodthirsty, infected individuals, who Jim manages to escape from aided by a couple of norms, one of them named Selena (Harris). They fill Jim in on current events (seems Jim's been in a coma for the last month due to an accident), and Selena imparts a few rules to live by...after a visit to Jim's parents house, they hook up with a tower block dweller named Frank (Gleeson), and his daughter Hannah (Burns), and all decide to hit the road based on a pre-recorded, repeating radio broadcast promising salvation from the madness. The wanderers eventually find the source of the message, in a small, grabasstic military group holed up in a large, country estate, led by someone named Major Henry West (Eccleston), but not necessarily salvation as the unit has their own designs for the travelers, especially the ladies...

This seems to be an important point to many, so it's probably worth mentioning...the term `zombie' is never once used within the film (as far as I can tell), and, in a traditional sense, those suffering from the disease do not appear dead, just overly prone to unspeakable acts of extreme violence, and thereby aren't really zombies (at least not of the George Romero/walking dead variety). As far as consuming the flesh of the living, I really couldn't say...there did seem to be a tendency to bite, and I suppose those `infected' would have to turn on the `norms' if only because their madness would prevent them recognizing any other viable source of food (tinned meats, canned fruits and vegetables, etc.), but I never really saw a close up sequence of the infected feasting on flesh featured in the film. The `Rage' virus seemed odd if only because it drove its victims not to randomly attack anything in general, but rather only those not yet infected (the infection passes easily enough, especially given the infected's penchant for projectile vomiting). Why should the homicidal loonies not attack each other, focusing rather on those not yet affected? I'm unsure, and it's never related in the story...oh well, a lot of things are left open ended, so it was no big deal. The one aspect I really liked about this film was when Cillian Murphy's character first woke, and then began wandering around the city, unaware of that which had transpired during his Rip Van Winkle impersonation. There was an entirely spooky feeling seeing him walking these streets that should have been normally teeming with life, hustling and bustling crowds all intent on fulfilling whatever purpose they have at the moment. Does the plot here offer up anything we really haven't seen before? Not really, but what it does do is give it a good once over, sort of a fresh spin, and juice things up in general. I had a lot of fun with this film for the first half (the flaming `Ragers' were amazing, and the gas station explosion sequence incredible), but then things got a little draggy during the latter half of the movie, after the initial group hooks up with the military types running their own program. I spoke earlier how director Boyle `juiced things up'...one way he did this was by shooting the film (a majority of it) using digital cameras. The effect is to sort of break down the barrier between the screen and the audience, almost like your watching live TV rather than scenes choreographed for a film. All in all a strong film with a solid sense of direction, despite the story getting a little predictable near the end.

The anamorphic widescreen (1.85:1) picture on this DVD is clear, sharp, and exceptionally clear, and the Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround audio comes through clean. As far as extras, there's quite a bit including a commentary track with director Boyle and writer Garland, six deleted scenes with optional commentary, still photo galleries, a music video, animated storyboards, a `making of' featurette titled `Pure Rage: The Making of 28 Days Later', and three, alternate endings...the first is slightly more depressing than the one actually used in the film, the second a little less so, introducing a relatively new character to replace one that got lost, and then the third, titled the `Radical Alternative Ending' excludes virtually the last third of the film, offering a completely different tale all together.

Biological weapons are not a ""fantasy"", you can ask the people who survived the ""desert storm"".

This was not a cheesy movie at all, it was a very clever way to show a horrid future panorama not too far way from today.

1540534,4,B00005JMA8,"""28 Days Later..."" gets off to a brilliant start.  A commando team of European animal rights activists breaks into a secret lab in the UK and liberates a single chimpanzee, strapped to a bed and forced to watch continuous TV feeds of rioting and other atrocities.  The chimp's rage becomes contagious.  He attacks one of the commandos, and in a fountain of blood, the end of the world is on.

The action picks up 28 days later, when Jim (Cillian Murphy, who has since broken through as an actor) awakens from a coma in a deserted hospital.  In a digital video homage to ""The Day of the Triffids"", Jim wanders the hospital (and later, a deserted London) for several minutes before he finally meets some victims of the rage epidemic... infected, highly contagious victims.  Soon, he is rescued by two uninfected survivors, and they band together first in search of safety, and then in search of a cure.

The first hour of ""28 Days Later..."", penned by Alex Garland, whose novel ""The Beach"" (a study of European backpackers in an uneasy paradise) was let down by a woeful film adaptation, underlines Garland's strengths as a novelist.  The first several characters we meet, beginning with Jim, are all well-defined and are known only by their first names -- something that you'd expect in a world where last names, like cash and cell phones, no longer matter.  Even those characters who die after just a few minutes are well-written.  The most compelling of the bunch is Brendan Gleeson, who brutally slaughters a group of infected before revealing that he's just a kindly cab driver who dotes on his 14 year-old daughter.

The use of digital cameras lends a herky-jerky movement to the infected, and also allows director Boyle to expand on the scenes of devastation (such as a wide shot of a burning Manchester).  However, Boyle's best directorial flourish is entirely natural: after 28 days with no running water, a fishtank is down to a few inches of water, and the surviving goldfish are mournfully confined to the very bottom of the tank.  The acting performances for the first hour of the movie are all determined, yet decidedly not over the top.

In the second half of the movie, a major cast member dies in very tragic fashion, and then the military takes over.  Led by Christopher Eccleston, playing a British army colonel a million miles from his recent portrayal of ""Doctor Who"", a group of nine very creepy soldiers establishes a temporary refuge from the virus.  After an unsettling dinner party, Eccleston reveals his motives to Jim, some of the soldiers turn hostile, and the movie quickly devolves into a tiring base under siege picture.  The action here is well directed, but the content is not quite as interesting as the first hour.

The DVD content is superb.  Boyle and Garland (but mostly Boyle) lend a commentary track not only to the movie, but also to six deleted scenes (in various stages of completion), three alternate endings, and two photo stills galleries.  The alternate endings show that Boyle & Garland struggled to end the picture, but that the ending they settled on (shot several months after the close of filming, on different film stock, thanks to an infusion of cash from a new distributor) is clearly the best.  One discarded ending, which omits the Eccleston storyline in favor of a more scientific solution to the virus problem, exists only in animated storyboards, and is well presented with Boyle & Garland reading from the script treatment.

""28 Days Later..."" presents a common apocalyptic scenario with compelling vision.  With strong direction, a talented cast, and a terrific DVD presentation, this movie is a strong entrant in a crowded genre.",1138752000,5,3691,4.861022364217252
1540535,3,B00005JMA8,The horror scenes are amazing in this film. This is how Resident Evil should of made their movies. But the thing about this movie is their isn't alot of zombie scenes in this movie. When your ready to enjoy a zombie scene it's already done. After that the movie tends to get boring. But it kinda makes it uo towards the end when the group of army guys get attacked by that zombie. And some guy actually sticks his thumb into someones eyes. I forgot the guys name but he comes on Batman Begins as Scarecrow. Pretty good film but could of been alot better. It should of had more action in it and the cities should of been filled with these zombies. Now thats a good horror film and would of been really scary.,1138406400,2,707,4.2444444444444445
1540536,5,B00005JMA8,"Someone recently gave this film a 1-star review because it contains ""full-frontal male nudity"" and so this prevented him watching it with his wife. If the male body offends you so, I suggest you take some sex ed lessons and get to know yourself a bit better. That's just plain insecure.

People are saying that the Resident Evil films are good now. I'm sorry, did you just walk into the wrong film? maybe you'd be better off with something that doesn't raise difficult questions about survival instincts versus society versus humane actions. Go watch Doom, or some mindless action franchise made for no other purpose than to make money. Or, better yet, go back to playing video games.

Unfortunately, I guess some Americans just can't see the good side of this film. Being British, I grew up with The Wicker Man and other such unorthodox, tension-building, subtle horror-thrillers, while my American brethren watched violent, gory films about psycho killers wearing funny novelty masks. I mean no offense to Americans, but I do think that this puts me in the position of being more accustomed to this kind of film; low-budget, not too much gore, filmed often awkwardly to create atmosphere.

Unfortunately it does take some of its cue from Day of the Dead, but don't hate it for that. Judge the film, not other films parallel to it. BUT I WISH PEOPLE WOULD STOP COMPLAINING THAT THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE THAN ZOMBIES IN THIS MOVIE!! I'M SORRY THAT IT CHALLENGES YOUR INTELLECT, THAT IT DOESN'T FALL NICELY INTO THE ZOMBIE HORROR CATEGORY!! THAT IT IS IN PLACES DIFFICULT TO COMPREHEND AND WATCH!!!!

How many other zombie movies can boast realistic and dynamic, and yet subtle, character evolution? None of the ""...Of The Dead"" movies can, that's for sure. How many of the Dead movies can boast being filmed on a low budget, with digital camera footage thrown in, developing an intelligent, almost beautiful and serene atmosphere and feeling in places, while in others create horror and disgust?

Basically, what I'm trying to say here, is: don't hate it because it's different. The natural reaction for human beings is to hate or shy away from something out of the ordinary. It's what kept us alive when our neanderthal relatives were still living in caves. But if you can truly discard this feeling, and watch it with an open mind -- and many people are not able to do this -- you will see this film's true colours.",1137283200,9,2414,4.793269230769231
1540537,3,B00005JMA8,"Director:  Danny Boyle

Cast:  Cillian Murphy, Naomie Harris, Brendan Gleeson, Megan Burns, Christopher Eccleston.

Running Time:  113 minutes

Rated R for extreme violence and gore, language, and brief nudity.

Director Danny Boyle, who created fine pictures such as ""Trainspotting"" and ""Shallow Grave"", is back to redeem himself, as is screenwriter Alex Garland (Boyle directed and Garland wrote the wretched Leonardo DiCaprio disaster ""The Beach"") with ""28 Days Later...,"" an interesting twist on the apocalyptic film.  Much like ""The Lord of the Flies"", the film strips away the civility we all think we possess and demonstrates that we, too, are bound by the laws of the animal kingdom - it's survival of the fittest and to have a future we need to reproduce.

Twenty-eight days after being hit by a car, Jim (Cillian Murphy), a bike courier and the film's protagonist, wakes up to find London deserted. Making his way though the desolate surroundings of the city, he discovers that an awful virus is spreading through the streets and cities of Great Britain. Soon nearly everybody is affected by this deadly disease that turns its victims into zombies, who are quite noticeable and different from normal people due to their odd, rapid body movements, their blood red eyes, foaming at the mouth, and their inability to communicate with normal people unless they are trying to bite them. Jim stumbles along a small group of survivors: an intense, badass female (Naomie Harris) with the heart of a lion and a soul of steel, a gentle father (played extremely well by Brendan Gleeson) and his teenage daughter (Megan Burns).  The group manages to stay alive and uninfected, but not for long. Eventually, they one-by-one fall victim to the awful disease and the remaining survivors have sealed a pact that involves them instantly killing any member of their group that has become infected, not to endanger those who are still alive and not yet zombies. As the survivors count their time left, they attempt to make it to a British military base near Manchester where they believe they will be safe.

The first half of ""28 Days Later..."" is intensely engrossing, disgusting, and piteously terrifying; however, the film takes a detour for the worst when the clan of survivors finds its way to the military base in which the soldiers have the ammunition to keep everyone safe and the potential to learn more about the deadly virus.  Led by their captain (Christopher Eccleston), the soldiers soon decide that resisting the crazed, infected humans is secondary to other means of survival.  The film deviates from the terror of the infection into a heroic farce in which Jim must save the females of the group from the groping military soldiers who seem thirstier for intercourse than the zombie-like monsters are for blood.  The slick direction from Boyle is extremely unique and the musical score composed by John Murphy is unusual, yet eerily exceptional for a horror film.  What could have been one of the most distinctive and intellectual horror films of the decade loses unfortunately loses its sight.  An original, amusing gore fest nonetheless.",1135728000,5,3146,5.044401544401544
1540538,5,B00005JMA8,"By 'recycled' I mean this kind of story has been told before - just take Romero's trilogy. But Danny Boyle is not of those directors who parasite on success of others. I'd call it revising. After an unknown infection took over the whole world groups of people here and there seek shelter in order to hide from rabid infected people who seem to be carnivorous. Cities abandoned, houses desolate, street empty... This is a perfect reminder that one day you can wake up and find out that you're left alone and everyone else is gone. It's frightening and exciting at the same time - many of us have a thought from time to time that it would be great if everybody just disappear at once and we'd be left all by ourselves.

There are things we can't believe in even watching them on TV - 9/11 or New Orleans tragedy. So here it's the same: it can happen one day just like on TV but it would be REAL. ""28 Days Later"" looks very much like reality. Endless shots of abandoned London make your skin creep. It's one of the most grim, uneasy and apocaliptic movies I've ever seen. If ""Dawn of the Dead"" at times lets itself smirk, ""28 Days Later"" is dead serious. And it's a pity to realise that even in the given circumstances people find time to fight each other instead of being united.

This edition has excellent bonus features - alternative endings (which are different and really interesting), deleted scenes and 'making of' featurette. All those are informative and entertaining. Don't hesitate to buy it.",1133827200,,1501,4.555555555555555

I think it makes a whole lot of more sense than the trash that has been released this year like ""The Ring 2""

Watch this film now or you will regret not doing so. Don't listen to the negative reviews because this film is unbelievable in it's own way. Don't wait for HBO to show it but RENT/BUY/STEAL it today.",1132617600,3,613,4.066115702479339
1540540,4,B00005JMA8,"While 28 Days Later is not a modern masterpiece, nor is it likely to stand as a great landmark in the history of horror films, it is an engaging, memorable, and thought-provoking apocalyptic nightmare. Danny Boyle and Alex Garland have taken brutal and horrific modern-day zombies and placed them in the traditional post-apocalyptic context. The film's promotional artwork, centered around a presentation of the universal biohazard symbol, reveals just how timely and unsettling the contagious zombies of the film are; the monsters here are not decomposing corpses animated by unspecified cosmic radiation, they are men and women infected with a bio-engineered contagion. The allegories are clear. As photographed, the desolate and utterly empty streets of a vacated London are just as chilling as any of the movie's swiftly-moving zombies. In fact, those seemingly endless scenes in which the capable Cillian Murphy surveys the near-silent streets and shops rank among the film's most terrifying and memorable. You see post-apocalypse on screen and all of its mind-numbing loneliness is evident. The nightmarish and realistic ramifications of the plague's spread are vividly depicted. Additionally, while those movie monsters we do see are truly terrifying, it is of course the human monsters that emerge from this scenario--the always intense Christopher Eccleston, in particular--that bring the greatest intrigue and the most terrible of sins.  As fans of the genre know well, horror films are all morality plays, and the predictability of this film's brutal twist does not detract from the impact of its climax. Ultimately, 28 Days Later succeeds in what it presumably set out to accomplish; the film revitalizes what stood as a seemingly decomposing sub-genre, imbuing the symbolic and archetypal figure of the zombie with new life, new threat, and new appeal. As an example of apocalyptic cinema, it is not easily forgotten.

1540591,5,B00005JMA8,"28 Days Later is the best Zombie movie I've seen in ages...maybe even the best.  Cillian Murphy plays a young man who was lucky enough (depends on how you look at it) to get in an accident, and wake up in the safety of a hospital.  He also wakes up to a new world; a world full of nothing...no people...no animals...nothing.  He soon finds out that a virus was released and spread accidentally which caused people to turn into the living dead.  He meets a woman a father and daughter along the way and together they all try to find a cure for the disease that a military base supposedly has.

1540592,5,B00005JMA8,"Our world has gone completely Mad.

Have you ever thought that very thing---thought it as you watch the news, as you surf the Net, as you read your morning paper? As you watch flickering news reports of the latest mass riot in Liverpool or Paris, ethnic cleaning in the Balkans, slave-trading in the Sudan, tribal genocide all across Africa, our own politicians slobbering at the mouth as they call their opponents liars, morons, traitors?

As you see the latest news flash: shaven-skulled ""militia"" in dusty fatigues in some dirty border town, shoving weary refugees this way and that with the muzzles of their AK-47s. Or a breathless anchor bringing you up to speed on the fact two levees have given way, erasing---totally obliterating---a city you thought was there for the Ages?

Great. Now imagine that that kind of Insanity amped up a billion times, only it's catching through the blood. Imagine that and you have the travelogue to Hell that is Danny Boyle's ""28 Days Later."" And in Danny Boyle's film, Hell is very much other people.

Centuries ago the brilliant English physicist and celebrated polymath Sir Isaac Newton contended that ""I see so far because I stand on the shoulders of giants."" The same thing might be said of director Danny Boyle, who draws heavily on his own giants---zombie Grandmasters like George Romero, Dan O'Bannon, and Stephen King---for his own hyperkinetic descent into a post-Apocalyptic English Hell, ""28 Days Later"".

But with that in mind, Boyle has distilled all of the shock and terror of Romero's zombie trilogy into two hours of pure adrenaline, two hours of raw, sheer, shrieking terror. He has, with ""28 Days Later"", out-Romero'd Romero, and his stark, horrific, harrowing portrait of a London gone literally mad manages to capture the end of the world in a manner that utterly eluded the the TV-adaptation of King's ""The Stand"".

Forget the fact that the red-eyed, shrieking legions of the Infected in this movie aren't classic zombies: sure, they don't feed on the flesh of their victims, and yes, they don't lumber and shamble along.

The Infected don't just get Mad. They get Even.

Nothing in this movie lumbers or shambles along---but make no mistake about it, Boyle's latest is a zombie film, and it is so good, and so scary, that it rightfully claims its Crown as King of the Zombie Movies.

Here are some tasty little nuggets about the movie to tempt you with, without spoilers to ruin your appetite:

The PLOT: Animal rights activists break into a Cambridge biowarfare research facility, intent on setting their primate buddies free. A goggle-eyed scientist, returning a bit late with his moca frappucino, witnessing the break-in, begs them not to free the chimpanzees: the beasts are infected with a highly contagious virus known as Rage, which is spread through the blood and within 20 seconds turns its victim into a froth-mouthed, shrieking homicidal maniac.

The activists ignore the warning, a young woman opens a chimp's cage, and within seconds the chimp launches itself into its erstwhile rescuer's face.

Our protagonist, a bike messenger played sympathetically by Cillian Murphy, awakens from a coma in an eerily empty hospital ward; he stumbles out of the hospital into an equally empty London, and the fun begins.

The CINEMATOGRAPHY: Director of Photography Anthony Dod Mantle is an adherent of Dogme, the cinematic movement committed to using natural lighting; the result sets up the movie's haunting, sere, and unsettling visuals. London broils under a jaundiced, sterile sky, and broods at twilight in an otherwordly greyish blue; the empty city resembles an alien moonscape, and a gas station explosion is shot as though on another planet.

The Infected here don't walk, lumber, or lurch: they run---fast.

London's zombies are glimpsed only as a shrieking blur, or caught as loping shadows against a tunnel-wall; the combination of hyperkinetic editing and the blood-spattering gore (captured using much the same technique employed in the battle sequences of ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Gladiator"") makes the lulls between encounters with the Infected unbearably suspenseful.

The ACTING: Everyone here is an unknown (with the exception of ""Gangs of New York""'s stolid Brendan Gleeson, who plays a London taxicab driver and---for a few minutes, anyway---gives the movie a reassuring moral center), and the acting is all superb and believable.

Cillian Murphy manages a remarkable transformation during the film, remarkable both for its outlandishness and (given the horror of his character's plight) believability. Noamie Harris and Noah Huntley shine as London survivors, and Christopher Eccleston is superbly Kurtzian as an embattled British Army Major at the center of his own raging heart of darkness.

MORAL of the STORY? Two, really: 1) if you're an animal activist, pick targets other than biowarfare facilities; and 2) if you're a soldier holed up in an English manor home, don't keep an infected zombie chained by the leg in the house garden.

Many of ""28 Days""'s critics have attacked the movie for being 'derivative'---and yes, Boyle borrows heavily from a treasure-house of zombie and horror movies. The movie practically condenses all of the major action from Romero's 'Dead' trilogy, and the climactic, operatic final sequences in a storm-tossed English manor house could have been lifted directly from the horror video game ""Resident Evil. But Boyle takes his inspiration, consolidates it, and then sets out in new, unexpected, and terrifying directions.

Boyle has crafted a masterpiece of movie terror, and one of the most bleakly disturbing films about the end of the world ever made.

And keep your lights out---they're drawn to lights.

1540594,2,B00005JMA8,"I got this movie to watch on Halloween because it was reputedly a very scary movie. I don't think I felt frightened even once in the entire movie.  There is no aching suspense, no sudden jumping out.

The lead actor Cillian Murphy is almost impossibly handsome. The camera often takes time out from the mountains of gore to lovingly caress his face and body which sometimes seems so jarringly immaculate it looks as if he just walked off a fashion runway.

There is lots of slime and blood and festering, hours of it. There is also what felt like like 10 hours of footage of people bashing each others' brains out in the dark.  I could not tell who was bashing who or why.

I have never watched a movie where I had less sympathy for any of the characters. Even the ""heroes"" were totally selfish opportunists.

The rape scenes were supposed to be terrifying, but I could not help but laugh. Why would anyone give a thought to rape when they knew they were about be pounced on at any second by rabid plague victims?

The mayhem wore thin very quickly. The villains were as distinctive as the white plastic-coated soldiers in Star Wars.

By far the most interesting parts of the movie were about the gritty practicalities of living without electricity, running water, grocery stores or other people.

As metaphor, the movie had its moments. It showed how money really is just a token in a social game. Money becomes meaningless in the apocalyptic world. There was one bit of philosophising when a soldier noted that for most of earth's history it had no people, and now with this megaplague, earth was returning to normal. The plague itself is symbolic of the rage that spreads from person to person in modern urban society, erupting in mass violence like the Iraq war.

The special effects went on for what seemed like an eternity too, namely wandering through British cities without seeing a even a single car or pedestrian. I suppose these might be more interesting to people familiar with the landmarks with their normal bustle. The effect was supposed to be eerie, but for me, it came across much like visiting a resort town out of tourist season. It has been done too many times before and director Danny Boyle belaboured it. He went on for what felt like hours of it with nothing happening.

P.S. I was not on drugs. The time dilation effect comes purely through repetition of the exact same thing over and over and over.",1130803200,7,2425,4.616279069767442

28 minutes later: this is horrid!

28 hours later: Bring it back to Blockbuster...if I don't burn it before!

This movie looked bad to me. Then I read a review that compared it to the majesctic Frailty. So, I ran to Blockbuster and rented it. Well, this isn't at all like Frailty..I'll tell you that much. Frailty is an intelligent movie that requires some thought and ends out being an amazing movie. This movie doesn't require your brain to be turned on so fans of the horrible Dawn of the Dead, knock yourselves out. This movie trully is idiotic. I am in awe at how stupid some of these people are. The Amityville Horror, you have a new competition for some of the stupidest characters ever. Why do I say that? Because some ""anti test on animals"" person releases an animal that was tested by a highly contagious and dangerous virus. Oh she's smart. So then 28 days later, zombies are everywhere, biting people and turning them into zombies. The zombies jump out of everywhere holding their mouths open trying to eat people. Well, 28 minutes after turning it on, the disc was in its case and I mad at myself for wasting my time with this trash.

The movie isn't scary for one. Zombies jump everywhere, so if that's your thing then you'll love it! Secondly, it's flat, being very boring and stupid. The acting is below average..as is everything. Critics praised, everyone on Amazon praised but I sure didn't. This movie is another movie in the horror section to make fun of.

1540596,5,B00005JMA8,"All my life, one of my worst fears has always been having some kind of plague be released somehow by the government, and the civilians of earth would be the test rats. With what they do today, it's not entirely impossible. Before I had even heard of 28 days later... there was actually a documentary that came out called ""Smallpox"" and before it came to America it was made by the british also. The movie involved a man infecting himself with the contagious disease, and spreading it all around New York himself, causing 1/3 of the world's population to be wiped out in less than one year. It had scared me because they had made the film so real though the documentary was fake of course.

When I heard about 28 days later... it was already well out of the theatres, and a long time after smallpox had been released, but reading into it online, I found out all about it's scenario and plot, and it piqued my interest, especially since the virus didn't kill you this time, but it turned you into a monster in less than 20 seconds. Also, when I found out that it was filmed on Digital Video, I myself being an independent filmmaker, I jumped right to the film with no regrets in the process.

After a car accident leaves young Jim (Cillian Murphy) in a coma, he awakes a little less than a month later to find the hospital he's been stationed in is completely empty. No one is around, no doctors, no nurses, not even patients. Including the hospital, all of England seems to have been totally abandoned. Taking shelter in a large, Jim soon finds he's not as alone as he had assumed. The cathedral is filled with anything but normal people who he is suddenly attacked by for no reason.

Trying to escape from these demonic looking beings is no easy task since they're easily able to run twice as fast as a normal human being. After being rescued by two seemingly normal people; Mark, a rebellious skeptic, and Selena, a beautiful cynic, (the beautiful Naomie Harris) Jim finds out the whole of England has been infected with an incurable virus that was accidentally let out. It turns whoever is infected into rage filled monsters that have the notion to kill, but there may be a way out, but that may mean going straight through the heart of the infecteds, but if there's a cure for the virus, it's worth it...right?

Now I'm even more afraid of lethal viruses than ever! The whole movie, I think mainly because it was shot on DV, seemed so real. Almost as if you were there along with the characters. Their terrible language use made it seem real, that's for sure. After all, at my high school, I hear ""the F word"" at least a hundred times a day, so it's no change for me in adults. It's amazing how Danny Boyle directed the film because he takes it in a whole new direction than you think. People who you want to live die, and then people who you want to die...die. LOL.

As for acting, I think the best acting was done both by Naomie Harris and Brendan Gleeson (who doesn't stay around long). Cillian Murphy was good, but his acting just didn't show enough emotion for him to be as real as possible. Naomie Harris, for her role as Selena who will stop at nothing to keep herself alive was awesome. She made you want to hate her, but then at the same time think ""Well, I would probably do the same as her"" especially if you're caught in a world where everyone you know will never know YOU again.

I found it's a very original plot may be the best movie having to do with zombies, per se. Dawn of the Dead (2004) no doubt was inspired by 28 days later. The ""zombies"" in 28 days later were much scarier because if they dared get a drop of blood on you, or get bitten, you're dead. It's an apocolyptic thriller that will take you're breath away, especially since this is so believable, as in it could actually happen someday, it's scary. 5 stars for everything!

After a VERY strong opening, it just deteriorates. No other way to put it. They set the stage well, great camera shots, clean editing, intense pacing, great effects, atmosphere...the works. I was impressed, honestly. Trouble was, after laying out this this great apocolyptic vision, they just couldn't tell a story that lived up to such a well done opening, nor could they populate their little zombie world with characters you can actually care about. I didn't even care enough to want to see them die, let alone root for them to live...

Props to the effects crew, set designers, lighting, costumes, stuntmen, sound crew...basically all the tech people...they did a great job. The casting director should be shot, the writer obviously tried but just didn't have anything original to add to the genre.

I can't wait for the unrated version on October 18th.

Someone had the idea to make the zombies move fast. Great idea, but it would have been better if they had actually SHOWED A FEW MORE ZOMBIES!! The remake of DAWN OF THE DEAD did this with a devasting hold-on-to-your-seats-folks-these-zombies-are-moving-fast effect. Someone also had the idea of having a band of survivors meet some psychotic soldiers. But, these rapists can't compare to the brilliantly repugnant Rhodes and Steele of Romero's DAY OF THE DEAD. Nice try, guys. But, ROMERO DID IT FIRST!! And much much better.

This flick is full of style, little substance, very little or no flesh-eating, and no story. This film is unoriginal, boring, and DEAD on arrival. Here's a little rule to follow when making a horror movie with zombies: PUT SOME HORROR IN IT!!! I saw this a few years ago and just recently and I still can't figure out what all the fuss was about.

I guess it is inevitable that every zombie movie gives a hat tip or three to the three Romero classics and 28 Days Later is no exception. It does, however, have a very British feel to it and, by blending in elements of Terry Nations seminal Survivors, still manages to deliver almost two hours of  highly entertaining and evocative thrills.

Any horror/SF buff happy to just go with the flow should not be disappointed.  Analysing the movie to any depth, however,  reveals several plot holes and inconsistencies, which just may compromise your enjoyment.  Firstly, if, as one of the ill-fated squaddies surmises, Britain has been effectively quarantined, leaving the rest of the planet more-or-less untouched, then why couldn't any foreign stations be picked up on the radio?  Talking of radios, surely a wind-up radio would not be necessary in the days following the catastrophe?  I'm sure most households would have a few of those ""no other battery costs like it"" in a cupboard somewhere?  Then, isn't it a bit far fetched that a lowly bicycle courier could metamorphose into an expert in armed and unarmed combat with skills exceeding those of trained soldiers?  Oh and, with an absence of advanced medical facilities, would someone who takes a bullet in the guts be likely to survive?  Then there are the geographical bloopers; the famous National Trust site Waverley Abbey is well South of London and most definitely not on the way to Manchester.  Manchester itself is several miles to the East of the motorway and not due North as the scene of it in flames suggests.  Lastly on my niggles list, there is the all too often gratuitous overuse of strobe lighting to make an extended combat sequence very uncomfortable viewing for all the wrong reasons.

But enough nit-picking! For an adrenaline-filled shocker with great tension (you wouldn't believe how changing a flat tyre could be made into real edge-of-the-seat stuff!), characterisation and convincing acting, you could do a lot worse than 28 Days Later. The iconic scenes of an eerily deserted London (how the hell did they film Westminster Bridge and Piccadilly Circus like that?) are nothing short of magnificent!",1127779200,3,2203,5.0
1540642,4,B00005JMA8,"You would probably need to go back to the original Night of the Living Dead to get the same vibe that 28 Days Later has.  I'd rank this film slightly above its predecessor in that you are drawn into the main character's (Jim) point of view.  You're never sure entirely who he should trust throughout the film and just how dangerous the threat is so I'll guarantee that you'll be on the edge of your seat until the very end.

The very beginning at the lab and towards the end just before the final zombie onslaught are a cliched, but this is still a quality flick.  You're not going to get your gore fix with this one and the DVD extras are ""OK"", but I'd highly recommend it if you're looking to have your pants scared off one dark night.",1126569600,,737,4.242857142857143

After all, two major events happen 28 days later from the previous scene and because the budget of the movie was relatively cheap, this cannot be blamed. However, the movie is quite well pondered.  The plot is simple, but the details are intricate.  Viewers do not know what happens outright, it is revealed slowly and surely through foreshadowing and scenes of great suspense.  The problem is that I purchased this DVD in the horror section.  To me, the horror section is very specific, and this is not horror in my terms, but I guess it is due to genre lumping.  Horror contains twists and turns; this movie is more like a haunted house at Halloween Horrow Nights in Universal Orlando with everytims jumping out at you.  Making up for the lack of true in the acting script is the lighting and mood that is created in teh last scenes of the movie.  This film is strongly suggested, by me, for those interested in the Apocalypse sub-genre, that like suspense on the screen, and/or enviromentalists hardliners.

1540650,4,B00005JMA8,"I am giving this movie a 4 due to a major plot flaw, but otherwise the film is very good. The movie is well worth a rental and I would purchase it if you are a fan of post apocalpytic sci-fi. If you liked the Steven King Novel/TV Mini series ""The Stand"" or movies like ""The Last Man on Earth"" with Vincent Price, or Charleton Heston's re-make, ""The Omega Man,"" you will be a fan of this movie. All 4 movies feature a biological apocalypse. In the Price movie the survivor is immune to the Plague and spikes the vampiric survivors by day until they track down and kill him as the creature that imperils ""their"" civilization. The Omega Man is similar but ends with a hopeful cure to the plague that may be the start of normalcy for the infected.

In 28 Days Later, the infected have no intelligence other than to bite and kill what is not infected, however they seem too angry to use their intelligence to plot and kill, rather they form posses and give chase whenever a target gives itself away like our hero Jim does on a few occaisons. The new twist in this film is the British Army squad they encounter and the deal the Major has made with his men to maintain his tenuous control. Here is my serious plot flaw with this film (stop here to avoid a spoiler): the morale of this squad is so low that they would recruit/bump off Jim as long as he agrees to the sexual slavery of his female companions (one of whom is barely finished puberty). This I don't undertsand, they have tons of military hardware and have even setup a radio broadcast stating they have a cure for the Plague (which drew Jim and friends in the first place). So why don't the organized authorities send a helocopter in to check out this claim or at least send this group a radio signal saying ""hello there, what's the cure?? Knowing that there are folks outside themselves would have kept this group's morale up and prevented their barbaric (although understandable) deal.

I think if I were in a squad of soldiers that beleived we were the only healthy men in the world, and there was only one woman and one girl left in the world with us, I would be saying Ok here's the situation; until more women are found you gals are it, we are your group husbands' until the numbers are more even. We share and share alike and hopefully all the infected folks will die soon because they are stupid and angry. Then we can start growing some food and raising us some babies. Instead they make the soldiers out to be rapacious lunies, and they are too dumb to listen in on the radio to what any American with a Police scanner would have heard, the chatter between pilot and controller of the jet scouts flying over head

This movie also made me think about guns and zombies, would we in America feel as threatened as the folks in this British film? I think Americans would run to the local K-Mart or army/navy store and grab some guns and ammo. The Brits, even when chased by the zombies don't head for the nearest police station to get a pistol or riot gun. I think if I were being hunted by crazed zombies I'D WANT AS BIG A GUN AS POSSIBLE!!",1121558400,2,3101,4.343103448275862

1540718,5,B00005JMA8,"With awful zombie films being made these days ( House of the Dead) it is truly refreshing to see a movie such as this, even though it is much different from the cliche zombie movies of today ( could this be why it is so good?) it has everything not just a good horror movie but what a great movie in general needs. Likable characters who you want to survive. Good script, good scenario and plot ( I mean, how can you enjoy a movie when how the whole thing comes to be makez zero sense?) So anyway, for those whom haven't seen this movie I won't give any big spoilers away, it starts out in a lab with monkeys infected with a virus the doctor describes only as ""rage"" so you better believe when a group of people whom think caging the monkeys is wrong release them, they get a huge suprise. The monkeys kill everybody and so the story starts, while that may not sound very interesting the plot is incredible. 28 days later, we meet a young man in the hospital whom we later find out is named Jim, after waking up and enjoying a Pepsi he wanders into a church and that is where the real fun begins. What I feel makes this movie work is three things. Likable characters, I can not say this enough, it is so important for a flim. An ending which you won't be able to predict an hour before the movie ends ( you won't even be able to guess within the last 5 minutes) and the fact that they don't over do the zombies, they're not in every scene being blown to pieces with a shotgun. I enjoy gory no plot films as much as the next guy but lets face it, they get old. If you notice on the back of the dvd it says ""Hailed as the most frightening film since The Exorcist"" which i'm sure many will disagree but in my opinion, this is much better. For one reason. I have watched this movie twice already and I loved it just as much as the first time, however my personal opinion with The Exorcist is, it sorda lost the magic after the first time and I don't plan on watching it again. Now, even with only one dvd here it still has plenty good extras. with the usual director/ writer commentary. Six deleted scenes ( three of which are alternative endings) a music video by some band named Jackknife Lee, I have no idea who they are though. a making of called "" Pure Rage: The Making of 28 Days Later"" plus animated storyboards, trailers for the film and Still Photo Galleries. Most of the music in the flim while not bad seems like insturmentals from English Alt. Rock bands (which I have nothing against) except for one scene near the end in the kitchen, the scene is quite eerie to begin with but when this piano kicks in which sounds like it would be made by a melodic Black Metal band such as Cradle of Filth, Dimmu Borgir or Old Man's Child ( which is more my thing) it is just beautiful and adds to the eerie feeling of the movie. So all in all this is one of the best movies to come out in recent years and I recommend it to all movie buffs. Enjoy.",1120521600,,2943,4.146853146853147
1540719,5,B00005JMA8,"Man, I really shoulda reviewed this a damn long time ago. Anyway, where to start.  Well, I guess I'll say right up front that '28 Days Later' may be the greatest zombie movie ever.  Or perhaps what I'd actually say is that '28 Days Later', 'Night of the Living Dead', 'Dawn of the Dead' and 'Shaun of the Dead' are all both so great and so different from one another that I couldn't really say that one was 'better' than the  other.  'NotlD' is the masterpiece of despair, 'DotD' is just so distinctive and odd, and 'Shaun' is funny. (duh) I suppose '28 Days Later' may be the most straight forward of them, as it works most from a dramatic and human interest standpoint.  As others have said this isn't just  a horror movie, it just kinda qualifies as one by default, due to it's apocalyptic nature and the zombies and whatnot.  The horror is largely clustered at the beginning and end, and although it is very good, it's really no more significant than the more dramatic material between it.  '28 Days Later' is populated by some of the most sympathetic, likable characters you're likely to find in any genre, and this is what makes the movie works, as much as anything.  It's quite a powerful movie, really.  Thematically, it's primarily interested in resiliency of the spirit and the ability to deal with tragedy.  These are terribly common themes, of course, but this film makes them work a lot better than most others do.

Of course, lotsa people out there are gonna try and tell me this isn't a zombie film, but these people can piss off.  I'll admit it, upon first hearing about this movie, prior to the US release, it didn't sound like it was really a zombie movie: they aren't dead, they don't eat flesh, as far as we can tell.  The fact of the matter is, however, that the infected individuals in the movie *look* and *act* just like zombies: They attack humans on sight, without weaponry, while ignoring other infected individuals; they have no apparent intelligence; they spread disease through physical contact, and they're all icky.  The fact that they're alive shouldn't matter, because being undead doesn't actually signify anything, necessarily.

As you certainly know, this film involves the decimation of England due to an outbreak of 'rage', a disease which, naturally, causes people to pretty much act like zombies.  Our main character, Jim, was injured in a bike wreck just prior to the outbreak, and wakes up in the hospital 4 weeks later.  Other than this, the film doesn't really have that much of a plot.  It's sorta a slice of life from the post-apocalyptic world, as it is primarily interested in Jim's meeting with and bonding with other people, and the continued search for any other survivors.  This is a reasonable arc, as the film is more about character and mood than it is about any over arching scheme.  The film also develops a real sense of tragedy and desolation that is often inexplicably missing from this sorta film.  Sure, we all know that it would be highly upsetting if the world were to end tomorrow, but most of apocalyptic films fail to make me feel the loss. This one succeeds.

The endless, severe tragedy of the opening gives way to the generally violence free and relatively lighthearted middle section, as our group searches for a military base.  Nothing much happens in most of these scenes, but they reveal the humanity of the characters, and show that most of the time, life just goes on.  Here the central theme comes out.  Early in the film, the hardened Selena says, flatly, `Surviving is as good as it gets'.  The film itself counters this, more or less saying that if just surviving is as good as it gets, than their really isn't much point in surviving any longer.  Again, perhaps an obvious point, but the film really makes you believe it.

As always, I finally lose patience with looking at it in an overall perspective, and just have to talk about some specific scenes.  Early in the film, the Mark character gives a brief monologue about the death of his family.  This is a truly chilling scene, which can't help but remind me of Ben's monologue from `NotlD'.  Also, `28 Days Later' has one of the most tragic, gut-wrenching death scenes I've ever come across.  I can't go into specifics, naturally, but it's really powerful.  Finally, though many have complained about the climax, I like it quite a lot.  It's truly intense, with some brutal, if not particularly gory violence.  It's largely helped by the slowly building and brilliant post-rock score. (People love to rave about the use of GYBE towards the beginning, but I think the original score at the end works even better.)

I have no real complaints about the film.  The performances are all great, and the direction controlled and adept, with a kinetic, visceral feel without being so formless and out of control as so many recent films.  They do perhaps over use the frame removal stuff a bit, but this is no big problem.  Overall, I think it works quite well, but it woulda worked even better  if they'd held back a little more.

Yeah, I'm done.  Great movie.

1540721,3,B00005JMA8,"When you are tackling a genre that has been so overdone as zombie movies (ok, they're plague-infected people, but they sure act like zombies) you need to do something different. I'm not a zombie afficiando so maybe some of the things I liked have been done before, but I thought it was exciting that someone became infected within 10 to 20 seconds. It doesn't give you much time to determine whether they're infected or to defend yourself. I also liked the fact that the zombies moved fast, not dragging along like snails. The beginning of the film where the main character, Jim, wakes up in the hospital, not knowing about the plague because he had been in a car accident, is very well done. It was easy to imagine that was yourself trying to figure out where everyone was and what had happened. There is a very creepy scene in a church when Jim is rescued from a pack of zombies by other non-infected people. After this the movie slows down quite a bit while Jim and Selena argue and meet other survivors. There is some talk during these scenes about needing to have something to survive for, not just survive. I guess this elevates the movie slightly, but its done pretty superficially and a little too easily.

It almost becomes another movie after that. The survivors follow a radio transmission to Manchester and find a small military band in an armed fortress. They think they'll be safe until they find out the commander promised his men women which is why he put out the broadcast in the first place. Lucky them that the only people to show up are 2/3 female and young and attractive at that. Jim is supposed to be executed to get him out of the way but he escapes due to the soldiers utter stupidity. Then this former bicycle courier manages to out-maneuver trained military personnel to rescue the women. Including along the way releasing a captured zombie, who immediately attacks everyone in sight thus creating more zombies. Brilliant idea.

This was a decent movie that lost its way with a slow pace and plot contrivances that made you stop believing any of it was real.",1118016000,3,2085,4.617250673854447
1540722,2,B00005JMA8,"Good special effects and an ambitious Apocalypse virus scenario grip you for the first part of the film.  Animal rights activists let out monkeys with a virus that's so aggressive it wipes out the population of England in 28 days.  The DVD contains interviews with scientists saying, yes, viral pandemics are dangerous.  So this film pretends to be realistic while wallowing in mindless gore.  Pretty much a cross between Night of the Living Dead and 12 Monkeys (without the time travel), a group of survivors travel to Manchester to find salvation in a radio broadcast of army troops.  The scenes of a deserted London are well done (looks like London on Sunday morning 6AM).  All the while they fight off blood spewing zombies.  So one inconsistency among many here is with all the blood all over the place, the film starts with survivors wearing blood-proof full body and head protection, but this contradicts the rest of the film where they are unfazed when infected blood spews all over them.  Of course watching a film with nothing but actors in burka-like covering would be boring, especially for the gore fans.

  Danny Boyle directed Trainspotting, and the satire that works there is conspicuously absent here.  I wanted to see thoughtfulness in the script, but found little.  Why is it the trend to make Apocalypse/Disaster films into shallow studies in action, violence, and gore?  For mass appeal?  Anyway the gore scenes are intense enough to recommend keeping kids away from the film.  On the other hand adults can laugh at some of them as they attempt to be as over-the-top as you can get.  Skip it and watch 12 Monkeys or Night of the Living Dead instead.",1117929600,10,1670,4.823943661971831

There are many instances within the film where it is clearly evident. The Monet-like imagery of the flowers after the grocery store run, the camera angles and music while they are on the deserted highway, the plane viewed through the trees, a red dress that gained its own theme song only to swoosh across the screen for a few seconds, and the final scene where HELL is spelled upside-down out on a green hillside only be read as HELLO later.

All of these, and more, captivated my attention throughout the horror of the movie's entirety. These images were produced so well I bought the movie just to see them over, and over, and over again.",1116201600,2,864,4.532051282051282
1540724,3,B00005JMA8,"The zombies are fast.

It's true that in Danny Boyle's 2002 film 28 Day's Later the crazed, flesh eating villains aren't technically zombies.  In fact, Boyle has gone to great lengths to qualify them as humans infected with a virus known as RAGE.  Yet, to this reviewer at least, the differences seem moot.  In traditional zombie pictures, and in this film the creatures are mindless, they carry a real zeal for human flesh, they have a predilection for turning everyone else into their like, and they are fairly easy to kill.  Whether the creatures are the living dead so to speak, or infected by an incurable virus doesn't make much of a difference.  Though the zombies here, seem updated from their filmatic ancestors.

These zombies are fast.

Traditional zombies are a slow moving lot.  Having been rotting in their own graves for untold years, their reanimated flesh is a little atrophied, causing them to move at a slow, sluggish pace.  This has always been a helpful plot point for the heroes in zombie films, for they are easy to run away from.  In fact, the means by which zombies generally kill their victims is through sheer numbers.  Boyle has circumvented this convenience by allowing his monsters to run at normal human speeds.  It is an excellent update to the genre, giving the ability for more scares.

Man, I dug the first half of this movie.  Well, except for the very, very beginning.  The opening scene gives us the origin of RAGE, with a bunch of Clockwork Orange inspired monkeys.  I've never really dug origin scenes in zombie flicks.  I think it's much scarier to just have the zombies running around eating brains, without any reason for their existence.  Origins, generally, just seem dumb.  And here, with the infected monkeys being freed by some Green Peace types doesn't really inspire any other feelings.  Though, I suspect it was another move to plant this film outside the zombie track.

But after the dumb origins scene things get really good.  We've got a naked guy named Jim (Cillian Murphy) hooked up to various tubes in a hospital bed.  I always like it when there is a bit of male nudity in a flick, since there is always so much of the female variety.  Anyways, Jim gets out of bed and wanders the streets of London.  There are plenty of shots of Jim (fully clothed now) walking by big famous London monuments without another soul around.  It seems London has been vacated.  It is creepy and effective.

In a bit, Jim clamors into a church figuring to find some sanctuary, or at least have a few questions answered.  What he finds is a bunch of dead folks piled up.  In a good holy crap moment, Jim says, ""Hello"" to find a couple of the dead guys not so dead and jumping up.  From there until the second half of the film, it is a constant run from the zombies.

The zombies really work in this film.  They are fast, furious, and vicious.  Jim eventually teams up with some other survivors and they set about trying to figure out what to do.  Boyle really does a great job of adding tension to the film and keeping the scares up.

Then the film changes.

The group is rescued by a gang of all male military types, living in a compound.  Turns out the military types are a bunch of psychos and the film turns from being a zombie flick into being a stranded-in-a-compound-with-a-bunch-of-psycho-military-types kind of film.  To make sure we know this is no longer a zombie flick, a big group of zombies launches an attack on the compound only to be massacred with machine guns and land mines.

This half of the film, I don't dig nearly as much.  Zombie flicks always have trouble filling out their whole hour and a half time slot.  Even with a good introduction of characters, and a slow build to zombie free-for-all there is still plenty of filler time.  Here, the filmmakers seem to have decided that they might as well dump the zombies and give us some other tension filled concoction.  But, there isn't really enough time to develop the military end of the story and it feels wrong.

It's too bad too, because that first half was really promising.

1540775,2,B00005JMA8,"28 Days Later is not a bad film.  Indeed, considering that rotten zombie movies are nearly as numerous as the shambling hordes themself, this movie could be considered somewhat of a gem when held in comparison to Return of the Living Dead III, Zombie Planet, or Chopper Chicks in Zombietown.  Is it, as advertised, a groundbreaking zombie film that will reinvigorate the genre?  No.  Not at all, and possibly quite the opposite.  So far we have two truly groundbreaking films in the zombie genre: White Zombie and Night of the Living Dead.  Comparing any zombie movie to these two is unavoidable, as the first started the genre and the second defined it.  28 Days Later does not cap this list, nor is it particularly innovative.  Zombie outbreak?  Already done - 1968, Dawn of the Dead.  Running zombies?  Already done - 1985, Return  of the Living Dead.  Zombies created as a military weapon? Already done - 1936, Revolt of the Zombies.  Etc., etc., etc ad infinitum . . .  What led to negative criticism and a collective groan from Romero-inspired zombie afficianados was the presentation and the marketing of the movie.  Though not a particularly great or innovative example of the genre, the marketing has inspired subsequent movies towards imitation, hence running zombies encountered in the remake of Dawn of the Dead.  It's rather like having a hip hop band, whose inspiration was once based in Motown, suddenly switch over to emulating Justin Timberlake.  The ideology changes.  Plenty of people will like it because Timberlake is marketed to be popular, but a certain portion will lament over the loss of that pure Motown funk.  If you want Justin Timberlake then enjoy 28 Days Later.  If you want that pure Motown funk then opt instead for Shaun of the Dead, which quite possibly rescued the genre from this movie.",1113955200,6,1824,4.8762214983713354
1540776,2,B00005JMA8,"Much as I love zombie flicks and apocalypse flicks, this one just doesn't work on an American audience. Why? Because we have guns.

The virus that decimates England (and presumably all the populations on contiguous land masses), is a disease that couldn't travel globally. It takes 20 seconds for an exposed person to become violently symptomatic, and the virus is spread only through direct contact into the bloostream, so it's not like an infected person could board a plane and fly over to another continent. So, while the decimation of Europe would doubtless put a cramp in the global economy, the plot that is offered could never become the end of the world. (A point which is implied by the absence of global support ""sending in the troops"" or, at least, sending helicopters over to drop off food, medicine, weapons, and other supplies.)

As I watch these handful of survivors try to flee London and find other survivors in the English countryside, I wonder why they don't have any effective means of defending themselves. I mean, I know England is anti-gun, but they do have rifles, don't they? Aren't their police armed? Wouldn't there be an armory somewhere? True, a few guns won't fend off a swarm of thousands of ""zombies,"" but it would provide a better means of protecting oneself against smaller zombie attacks, which are a constant risk to the survivors. Instead, they rely on machetes, baseball bats, and running away.

I guess that's why this movie was set in England... set in America, the plot would end 5 minutes into the movie once Americans descended upon the zombies, fighting back with millions of armed private citizens. (Until the lawyers get a judge to issue an injunction against zombie destruction.)",1113523200,2,1727,4.907534246575342
1540777,1,B00005JMA8,"28 days later is without a doubt the worst movie ever made, even

in britain or america. it is a libelious rip of the ""night of the living dead, dawn of the dead, and day of the dead"" trilogy that i am surprised george romero didn't sue for copyright infringement. but then again ""28 days later"" was such an awful film beyond anyone's comprehension that he didn't have to sue. no this film pretty much speaks for it's awful. horrible scripting, horrible acting, slowpacing self.

Its no wonder why most of the people who give this film

thumbs up are British. British people definitely are

hard to figure out. Usually they have good taste but

I cant fathom why would they praise garbage like this

especially when it's as unoriginal as a Friday the 13th sequel.

Yet some of these film critics praise ""The Football Factory""

a violent look inside Football in the UK through a bunch

of dsyfunctional fans.

The film's plot is that virus (yes like night of the living dead and romero's flick ""the crazies"") has infected many area of the uk. jim (cillian murphy) is apparently the only dumb smuck not infected along with a girl named selena (naomi harris). well from here on out these two dimwits and their friend mark now fight of zombies i mean rage people with bats and a machete. lol

In order for the idiotic danny boyle to not appear as he is copying romero (which he does anyway), he invents a new plot in middle. see the virus infects people and takes over within 30 seconds, whereas romero's zombies start reacting after an hour or so of being dead.

We get some shots of london and manchester but those shots didn't matter as the film is a mess. not even an entertaining mess, its just plain doggy doo.

There is another rip of ""dawn of the dawn"" when jim, selena and their new friends frank and hannah, scourged and plunger an abandonded supermarket to their hearts contents. this is reminiscent of the abandonded shopping plaza where the ""survivors"" exploit the plaza while the zombies on the outside are trying to get in. what a rip. another scenes that rips of romero is where boyle for shock value has a young boy who has the disease attack jim. the scene ends with jim getting a baseball bat and killing the boy. this was

a bit of copy of the dead films like the first one where we see the first zombie  girl in a zombie movie (the girl kills her mothers, then girl is killed herself).

Well the copying of Romero doesn't end there because Jim and others find a military complex which is really an abandonded plaza where Major West (Christopher Eccleston), an arrogant military commander attacks the rage people.

Well the rip here is that West like Dr. Logan (from Day) has a zombie, I mean rage person on a leach trying to the dead thing new tricks. LOL My god as you can very well see ""28 Days Later"" is a such rip of the great Romero it ain't funny. However, it's such a poor ripoff  of the work of Romero that the movie fails at every level.

There is hardly any suspense, until the last 10 minutes, the characters are horrible including Jim who by God is one of the ugliest actors I've seen. The ending is cheesy and dumb.

Mr. Cillian Murphy and others do such a poor job of acting that it's hard to fathom that this guy will play a big lead in the next Batman movie (""Batman Begins"").

Don't fall for the lies of the critics that say 28 Days Later is a good movie, it's not, it's horrible. I went to see this horrible ripoff with low expectations and I came away still in awe that such a bad movie could be made.

There is no more to say or add to this review of ""28 Days Later"" than to say it's horrible, horribly done by a European director, and poses a black eye to any future horror directors from the UK.

At least George Romero can still rest comfortably that his great work of the ""Dead"" trilogy will not be eclipsed by any wannabee horror directors anytime soon.

I didn't mind the copying so much if the movie had a great

payoff sadly it never does some people may bash this opinion

but it doesnt change the fact that its an awful film unworthy

The story begins with animal rights activists trying to free test monkeys, who have been infected with Rage, and becoming infected themselves, thus infecting the whole of England eventually.  As above, I did say infected, as a sickness, NOT dead, or undead.  This movie really uses its head, and comes up with something that while not wholly scary in itself, is a frightening concept.  People trying to kill other people off because of rage, which could have been controlled at the beginning.  Of course, everyone gets different things out of something.

As a huge fan of apocalyptic movies (""Dawn of the Dead"" & ""The Thing"" being my favorites), it was a fresh turn to really get to know the characters. The Director actually succeeded in getting me to care about them. Caring males and beautiful yet very strong females, all becoming friends - more like family. Then an inevitable point in the movie came - things have settled a bit, what do we do now?

The characters go to a military base - which turns out to be a blockade to any further creativity in the film. Soon follows a plot twist so intolerably dispicable, it ruins the movie and leaves a sour aftertaste. How any man could actually write that into a story, I have no idea.

1540781,5,B00005JMA8,"This movie transcends the zombie horror genre in ways that are reminiscent of George Romero.  Zombies are the greatest monsters in ""monster movies"" because they are your family, your friends.  No one wants to be the one that has to kill their once-loved family member and a great zombie story will work with that in mind.  Zombie movies also work on the fears of the current time period.  For instance, Night of the Living Dead (50s) deals with a downed satellite when space exploration and satellites were new.  In the 60s we had zombies that were formed from nuclear means (the Cold war, nuclear annihilation fears).  Today, with SARS and the threat of biological terrorism around the corner, we have this infection that spreads as fast as one minute, turning normal people into bloodthirsty savages.

Danny Boyle (director of Trainspotting) infuses this movie with his dream-like sense of direction.  Portions of the movie are so eerily dream-like (for instance, a car ride that passes a field of roses that look like they were painted there) that it shows a stark dichotomy with scenes of zombies and violence.  It's also brilliantly filmed with a digital camera that makes the film look documentary in places, adding to the fear.

Horror movies show the worst in humans.  It is often said that a good horror movie, one that transcends the genre, will have a horrific obstacle or monster but that, by the end of the story, the horrors humanity will eclipse the terror of the monster.  For instance, at the end of the Night of the Living Dead, the lone survivor is killed not by a zombie, but from a bullet.  The character happens to be African American in a time (again, the 50s) where segregation and blatant racism ruled.  His character being killed not by the ""monsters"" but by a human bullet helps propel that movie past its monster movie mania.  The same can be said of 28 Days Later.  To exactly explain how this happens would spoil an excellent plot twist.  Needless to say, this movie shows the horrors of humanity in a similar way to Night of the Living Dead.

Another positive in this movie is the fusion of music with what's happening on screen.  In at least two areas, the music starts quietly, in the background.  But, as the scene progresses toward intensity, the music builds to pounding climaxes that really make you feel edgy.  I've watched this movie countless time, but each time the music builds I can feel a knot in my stomach.  Very effective.

Overall, this is an excellent movie that takes the zombie movie in an awesome direction.  It's intense, scary, and smart.  And, it shows us that sometimes it's not the monsters we should fear, it's each other.",1110931200,,2680,4.724137931034483

Anger as a disease that is contagious and was spread to humans by monkeys? Come on.  After that opening scene I already knew how much I was going to hate the movie. After that they go forward in time 28 days and this guy wakes up in a hospital bed. They really don't explain much about this guys character but he is the main character.

This is the one part of the movie that I really enjoyed. They had a beautiful montage of him walking through an empty city. The camera angles were just right. After this it all began to go down hill.

I'm not going to reveal anymore of the plot incase you actually feel the need to destroy your precious brain cells and sit through this like I did. But I will say this. Through out the movie there are multiple plot holes and also a lack of a plot at times. I also noticed that a large majority of the movie just showed them driving in a car. They did that for at least 15 minutes of the movie without dialogue.

Oh, and now onto dialogue. The dialogue was horribly weak in it. In fact they rarely even talked in the movie about anything relavent to the plot. And one thing that really irked me was that the infected humans barely made any appearences in the movie. I was really disappointed in that. They could of at least thrown in some more violence just so that you would be distracted from how horrible of a movie it was.

Now for character development. There was none. All of the characters stayed the same throughout the whole movie. Except the main character. Throughout the whole movie he wasn't violent at all and you could tell he had no intention of it. Then suddenly at the end of the movie he is brutaly slaughtering military soldiers. Hmmm, thats really random. They really never justified this change of his character it just happened.

There was one thing that they did pretty good in it. The music fit in perfectly with every scene. I'm really stretching hard here for positives but I am finding it quite difficult to do.

1540828,5,B00005JMA8,"Wow, here's something new: 28 Days Later is a zombie film that pits dying plague victims against one group of people who in turn are against another group of people.  This UK film is really magnificent.  It fly's in the face of the normal Sci-Fi horror film that Hollywood has released to us lately.  With release of films like ""The Grudge"" ""Cursed"" and ""The Ring Two""  horror film makers have been insulting audiences with typical plots cheap scares and formulaic characters.  Not so here!  28 Days Later is feels fresh throughout with new ideas and moves between genres from sci-fi to post apocalyptic film to action to art film seamlessly.  This is a must see for all fans of  horror and sci-fi but a film that appeals to a much wider audience through its excellent cinematography, characterization and writing.

The film is based on a premise (albeit a rather thin one but suspension of belief is easy) that the world had been struck by a plague that kills quickly but deranges its victims causing them to become violent. The city becomes something of an ""Omega Man-esque"" metroscape where everything is available for the taking but lurking in the darkness wait the afflicted ready to attack.  After 28 days there are a few survivors who upon finding each other must survive and seek safety.  They hear a radio broadcast that gives them hope that others have survived and safety is available.  Here the plot really thickens... I won't give away anymore of the plot.

The movie has a good soundtrack and uses pumping metal for many of the action scenes.  The action is intense but unlike ""The Matrix"" it is actually believable.  Shot beautifully using wide angles to show the desperation and bleakness of the situation, the film uses a lot of contrasts and making it visually stunning.  Though the script is bereft of any truly great dialogue, the characters are believable. All in all the film has an artful, yet creepy feeling that keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat.

The real clincher here is the DVD versions copious extras. Including several alternate endings all of which are good and two different commentaries.  This movie is fantastic in its freshness. While it came to America with little acclaim and fanfare this is a movie that all horror and sci-fi fans will enjoy.  Lacking many of the clich&eacute;s and stupid scenes that ruin most horror movies 28 Days is certainly among the best.  I truly enjoyed the film.

1540829,5,B00005JMA8,"28 Days Later...

A film from the British Film Council, Canal+, DNA Films, Figment Films and distributed by Fox Searchlight Pictures

Written by Alex Garland

Directed by Danny Boyle

Reviewed by PeterAmthor

Public synopsis: A powerful virus escapes from a British research facility. Transmitted in a drop of blood and devastating within seconds, the virus locks those infected into a permanent state of murderous rage. Within 28 days the country is overwhelmed and a handful of survivors begin their attempts to salvage a future, little realizing that the deadly virus is not the only thing that threatens them.

Well that's just the blurb that is given to the general audience via the back of the video box. But this movie amounts to so much more than most people could have anticipated. A very finely crafted movie with a cast that delivers some top-notch performances and a story that's sure to keep you in your seat. I'll try not to give away too much in the way of spoilers but I'm sure a few will leak their way in.

The story revolves around one character named Jim (Cillian Murphy) who wakes up from a coma in an abandoned hospital. With no idea of what has happened over the last 28 days he wanders around London in search of somebody, anybody, to tell him what's going on. It is his story that is told, and how it affects some of the other survivors that he finds and journeys with throughout the film.

Many of the shots are eerie to nearly any viewer, including those who have never been to London the UK in general, like me. The emptiness of the city around major tourist attractions, large city streets bare of any signs of life, vehicles abandoned and everything left to its own devices. A very odd view indeed. This is something that they make a point of showing throughout the movie. From the deserted highways to stores with goods still on the shelves, they want to make it a point that there is nobody left.

Well nobody but the infected. The devastation was caused by the release of a super virus that will turn anybody into a murderous killer within seconds. There is no cure save death from this terrible affliction. In another good move by the writer and director is that they point out that panic caused almost as much, if not more, damage than the virus itself. People trying to flee the city packed airports and trampled each other. Now all that are left are those trying to either kill you or those who are just trying to survive.

Another major character is a young woman named Selena (Naomie Harris). A very bitter and hardcore survivor who will leave anybody behind that may slow her down and get her killed. She has absolutely no problem with killing an infected by whatever means necessary if it appears you may be infected then she considers you that way.

Later in the film they meet up with two other survivors Frank (Brendan Gleeson) and his young daughter Hannah (Megan Burns) who have been holding out in a high-rise apartment complex. Together they formulate a plan to travel to a location just outside of Manchester where a radio broadcast of a recording is telling all survivors to go. A place where the military are supposedly holding out against the infected and are claiming to have the cure to the virus.

After a cross-country trip where we get to see much more of the carnage caused over the last 28 days they finally arrive at the destination. It is here that we are introduced to another group of characters, Corporal Mitchell (Ricci Harnett) and his nine surviving soldiers. They have been holding out in a fancy countryside mansion, the entire grounds have been covered with floodlights and land mines as they fight a continuous battle against the infected that swarm out of Manchester.

After a while you start to see that this movie is not so much based upon surviving the infected but also based upon ones ability to not turn into something just as bad as they are. In a world where everything has gone to hell one must hold onto their humanity no matter what. Because without it you are lost as the infected are. It also shows what a person is capable of when they are forced to do when confronted with only one right thing to do.

This film is such an excellent mix of well-written dialogue, excellent cinematography, wonderful direction and a very captivating story. They went beyond making a normal horror movie and made something so very much better that it is sure to be talked about for a while to come.

Check out the DVD version for extra endings, including one radically different ending that was never filmed but is shown through storyboards with voice over commentary. Several deleted scenes, some of which show events that never even took place in the final cut. The excellent film trailers are worth watching again; just for the hook that they originally used to get audiences are also present. There is also the extra bit called `Pure Rage' which is a behind the scenes look at the movie.

So in the end I give this movie a five out of five. Much to my surprise even. I wasn't expecting something this good when I sat down to watch it. So if like a good horror movie, or a psychological look at the development of characters in a situation of disaster, then pick this movie up.

The World ends.

Our hero Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes up ""in hospital"", as the Brits say. Charming. Except nobody is in the hospital, and Jim goes roaming through the deserted streets of London, hollering out ""Anyone here? HELLOOOOOO""??? Knowing what went on in the monkey house earlier, we wish he'd shut up.

Anyway, he soon finds out what's up, catches up with the audience, hooks up with a host of pilgrims on the road to St. Ives (all played to the blood hilt by actors at the top of their old & young games: Brendan Gleeson, Megan Burns, Naomie Harris, the great Christopher Eccleston). The plan is to vacate the East London tower blocks via taxicab, and head on up north to Mancester (England! England! Beside the Sea! the Sea! Sorry) where a military broadcast promises safety---and a cure.

Up to this point, and a little beyond, ""28 Days Later"" is a brutal, hypnotic, completely gripping classic. Seriously, I cried. I made me miss my parents, long dead.

1540893,5,B00005JMA8,"28 DAYS LATER SHOULD BE IN YOUR MOVIE COLLECTION ASAP.

First of all, the movie is nearly flawless: The acting, the editing, the DV shots, and most importantly..THE MUSIC. The soundtrack for this film is awesome. Every song fits perfectly with the scene, and every song is musically great.

The story is quite interesting. Many people think this is just another zombie movie, where the most popular actor survives at the end..but it has nothing to do with that, really. I see this film as an indie/horror/suspense movie. The plot is so unpredictable. There are plenty of setting changes throughout the movie, which I think is cool and original. All of the actors play their part extremely well. And as I said before, the music is outstanding.

Danny Boyle is such a great director. I've been a fan since I saw Trainspotting (superb movie by the way). The Beach was also awesome. 28 Days Later is a much more darker movie, with totally different characters.

A particular scene I loved was the beginning: after some monkey-chaos, this dude wakes up in a hospital bed, all jacked up. He slowly walks out of the hospital, and into the London streets, which are completely deserted. This scene reminds me of the ending of Resident Evil, but 28 Days is way better than RE.

Dawn of the Dead got remade, and it gave George Romero a B-12 shot right where he needed it. Now we've got the Diamond Dead to look forward to, and a host of other zombie fare in the near future.

Now, I know this isn't your typical zombie flick, it's more about a virus.

Same thing though, really. This movie was a gritty, in your face kind of movie and the first half hour is about as tense as anything I've seen. The ending fell apart for me a little, or more accurately just started to feel like a different movie.

All in all though, this thing made me jump in the theater, and was something that has stayed on my list of top 50 great horror movies.",1105920000,2,935,4.265536723163842
1540895,4,B00005JMA8,"This is a ""hate it"" or ""love it"" film.

Some things that occur in this film don't make much sense, except to move along the plot. BUT the writer and director both seem (from the commentaries) fully aware of this. Meaning, they didn't take that aspect too seriously and they don't expect YOU to either.

This is key in the enjoyment of the film for those plot-nit-pickers out there. :-)

Though, that intent can be confusing when juxtaposed with the FINE performances from unknown actors, Naomie Harris and Cillian Murphy.

It can be downright confounding that some things are handled so viscerally, and realistically (Selena's machete rampage comes to mind) while others (everyone sleeping comfortably outside AT NIGHT while rage-infected humans are running around) aren't.

This film is SOOO re-watchable to me, regardless. I am aware that this film has it's flaws, plot-wise, but it's just, and I say this being completely past the age of trendy-teeny-boppers, ""cool"". :-)

Some would argue, much too purposely so, but I really could care less.

It just is, for me. :-)

1540896,5,B00005JMA8,"28 Days Later proves for the first time since the George Romero zombie trilogy classics of the 60s and 70s that a properly scripted and directed zombie flick (or any horror) can be done with a low budget and no name actors.  One of the refreshing twists to this movie is that the zombies are fast very fast.  This causes for some pulse pounding, nail biting, bouncing in your seat moments that are a rarity in today's jaded horror market.

The movie premise is simple; the main character wakes up from a coma and finds that some interesting things have happen while he was out of it.  A disease, transmittable by direct fluid transfer (IE blood to blood) has escaped a research laboratory and has effectively taken England out.  The movie never really specifies whether the infected people are alive or ""zombies"", but for all intents and purposes they lose their original identities and turn into flesh craving monsters.  So I call it a zombie flick.

The thing that really makes this movie stand out from the pack isn't the big name well paid actors (which they aren't), nor is it the special effects (which are fine), or excessively gross gory moments (which aren't actually that often).  No the thing that makes this movie great is the time taken for the audience to get to know, understand and care about the character.  You learn to appreciate what these people are feeling and the very bad situation that they are in.  The thing that this focus of character development does for the movie is also to break up the action, which is a good thing.  Instead of being jaded to the gotchas and slaughter half way through the movie, instead you are allowed time to relax and get comfortable again and just when you think everything is okay, that's when things get bad again.  The pacing to movie is very well directed.

In conclusion, I can't think of anyone who wouldn't enjoy this movie especially a horror junkie like myself.  The only thing that I will add is that the DVD release boasts of 4 total ending.  The two filmed alternate endings don't offer much and the theatrical ending is just fine, however the ""radical"" ending which is presented in storyboard and narrator by the director is very interesting to watch.  The radical ending takes about a half hour to watch and effectively would have totally rewritten the last third of the movie.  It is worth it to check this ending out and see what could have been.  I think I still like the original ending more but that's just me.",1105660800,2,2485,4.609090909090909

I must agree that the actors do their parts with high competence. But the movie is just.., ugly. Alright, horror movies are ugly by definition, but this one is the kind of ugliness linked to bad taste, not to scary moments.

And, by the way, this is not a zumbi movie! People are infected by a virus and in a spam of twenty seconds are contamined with rage. That's it. So, to kill them, you don't need to aim at a specific point of their bodies or use a specific guns. You can kill them in anyway.

1540942,4,B00005JMA8,"""28 Days Later,"" directed by Danny Boyle of ""Trainspotting"" and ""Shallow Grave"" fame and ""The Beach"" infamy, was released a couple of years before the remake of George Romero's pseudo-classic ""Dawn of the Dead,"" and the two movies invite comparison.

While the remake of ""Dawn of the Dead"" followed the traditional lines of a horror/action film rather closely, ""28 Days Later"" takes a more thoughtful, atmospheric approach towards generating its creepiness.  While ""Dawn"" opened with a magnificent sequence showing the carnage -- both intimate and grand in scale -- of a zombie infestation, ""28 Days Later"" opens with pure dislocation.

Following an opening scene where environmental activists unwittingly let loose the ""rage virus"" by freeing infected chimps (including a nice reference to ""A Clockwork Orange""), the movie really sets its tone with some of the most amazing shots of London ever.  Bike messenger Jim -- injured by a car -- awakens in a hospital 28 days after the virus was unleashed.  He is completely alone.  And I mean *alone*!  Wandering first through the hospital and then through the streets of London, Jim does not see a soul . . . and the mind reels as the stark reality of an empty city hits home.  In several shots with no action whatsoever, the film establishes its tone of ominous foreboding - high marks!

Eventually, of course, Jim encounters some zombies.  The ""rage virus"" is lethal, and if the virus gets into your bloodstream -- whether from a scratch, a bite, or, most creepily, if it makes contact with your eyeballs, you have about 20 seconds before you become a zombie.  Jim is saved by two survivors, and demands to know what is going on.  This leads to the typically British understatement, ""Jim, I've got some bad news.""

""28 Days Later"" stays on a five-star path through the first half as a handful of survivors (including personal favorite Brendan Gleeson as a doting father) unite, fight some zombies, and strive to find some answers.  The ensemble tries to put a brave face on their situation, but there's a melancholy behind their forced humor that is very realistic.

The movie then goes to a strange place.  Our little band runs into a surviving group of soldiers, bunkering in a huge manor behind barbed wire and land mines.  This is a typical ""out of the frying pan and into the fire"" situation, which is foretold by the general creepiness of the commanding officer, played by Christopher Eccleston (""Elizabeth,"" ""Shallow Grave""), who is rapidly developing a body of work as one of the movies' most reliable villains.

The action devolves into a human-against-human-against-zombie climax which is a bit over-reliant on coincidence -- at one point, a character purposefully smashes a car into a building just in time for a zombie to rip the passenger out of the back seat, even though she should have had no idea that the zombie was there.  Whatever.  One does not go to zombie flicks for logic -- but still, the scenes with the soldiers don't feel quite in line with the rest of the movie.

That is a mere quibble, perhaps keeping this movie in the four-star range rather than the five-star effort it was shaping up to be.  This movie is scary, scary, scary, and has enough meat on its bones to stay with you after the lights go up.

The DVD's extras are good, too, including three alternate endings (one is good, one is okay, and the radical ending is very thought-provoking), making-of features, and director's commentary.  An excellent DVD for a very good movie!",1102291200,5,3515,4.839464882943144

1540946,4,B00005JMA8,"28 Days Later is a great addition to anyones Sci-Fi collection.  Danny Boyle successfully creates interesting characters and a believable story, a true feat in any Science Fiction movie.  In most sci-fi films, the characters are quite cliche, typically overdone stereotypes of the horror movie pro- and antagonist. But Boyles characters are deeper, allowing the audience to connect with them. Cillian Murphey does an excellent job as Jim, the main character, who finds himself awakened from a coma, and in a completely abandoned London. He actually grows the character throughout the film, another thing usually lacking in sci-fi. Even the Zombies in this movie have more depth. Rather than being the typical unfeeling, flesh crazed undead, we see them as desperate, suffering creatures, who once had families, jobs, and souls.  I recommend it to anyone who wants to see some decent science fiction / horror, not the usual thrown together mish mash of gore and blood, complete with an ending of absurd nonsense. This film is  elegantly crafted, a welcome change in the sci-fi film genre. Be sure to watch the DVD version with Boyles narration of how it was made.

1540947,5,B00005JMA8,"Borrowing heavily from George Romero's zombie flicks, Danny Boyle and Alex Garland's 28 Days Later gives a much more thought provoking thesis than its predecessors.

It's about a group of survivors of an outbreak in London that turns people into zombies. Despite their differences, they grudgingly trust each other until they reach a military base. When they reach it, the soldiers have other plans for the females in the group. This plot twist brings an aspect a lot scarier than just zombies sprouting at different places. It shows that man itself is much scarier than the monsters he is supposed to vanquish.

This theme of man's ""bestiality"" was also explored by screenwriter Garland in his novel The Beach (later made into a movie directed by Danny Boyle) and 28 Days Later has a lot in common to the Mad Max and other post-apocalyptic movies prevalent during the Cold War 80s.

Although you can see the ""indie"" (aka low-budget) feel of the movie, it is quite a feat to see a busy city of London devoid of people.

So if you're planning a Zombie Movie Marathon, be sure to include this and Shaun Of The Dead (both Brit flicks) for different twists to a reanimated genre.",1099872000,2,1175,4.717073170731707
1540948,4,B00005JMA8,"28 Days Later is about a virus (RAGE) that spreads throughout Great Britain and affects people by turning them into desperate, ravenous, zombie-like monsters. Their eyes turn red, and they scream and growl as they try to rip apart any non-infected humans they can find. The main character of the film, Jim (played by Cillian Murphy), awakens in a quiet hospital 28 days after the virus is accidentally released by animal rights activists who were trying to free chimpanzee test subjects infected with the RAGE virus. The hospital, along with the rest of London, is seemingly deserted as Jim wanders aimlessly through the empty streets. Extremely similar to the opening of Vanilla Sky, this scene is perfect in creating the empty lonesome tone of the first act. The movie follows Jim as he journeys to not only find safety, but to understand what has happened to everyone he once knew and loved. I was left with one big question. If everyone infected turns into one of the `zombies,' where was everyone??

Right away, I realized that no one was safe in this story. You can't assume that the characters you love will live and the ones you hate will die. One thing I really liked was that once infected, the virus would take hold of a person within seconds. This took out the traditional moments of ""Oh no, so and so is infected and no one knows - I guess we'll watch the virus slowly develop over the length of the film while building a very cheap, overused, yet somewhat effective bit of suspense."" I liked the fact that if someone was infected, you had better kill them sooner than later - or risk them turning on you. Another thing I really liked about the ""zombies"" is that they do not stalk their victims by sluggishly pursuing them with a long drawn out groan. These guys are fast! They dash towards their prey while screaming and vomiting blood. It really is gruesome.

Speaking of gruesome, this film very much feels at times like the `B Movies' it has borrowed from. The gore is over the top and the picture quality of the movie is really poor since it was filmed on digital video. I don't know if it was done solely for purposes of budget, or just to create a low budget gritty feel, but I can't help but wonder if it would have come across more clearly had they shot on traditional film and spared us the halo ridden blur of pixels void of any sort of detail. Then again, the movie may not have worked at all had it been shot differently. It is interesting to note that the final shots of the movie were shot on film. This is clearly significant, but to keep the review clean of spoilers I will say no more.

The all British cast did a fine job. The only actor I was familiar with was Brendan Gleeson who was very good as expected. The other actors may be well known in the UK, but they are all unknown in my mind, and they all did very nice work.

I have a new respect for director Danny Boyle. Some of the shots in this movie are downright terrifying, while others are absolutely breathtaking. The entire post-virus Britain is brilliantly realized, and some of the images will stay with you long after the credits have rolled. I don't think the filmmakers were trying to make any statements about SARS, nor were they trying to draw any other real world parallels, but it is hard not to become just a little more paranoid after having seen the film. Sure it's preposterous that a virus would turn a normal human being into some terribly violent and hopeless monster full of despair and a lust for human blood, but it does make for a suspenseful and at times shocking movie that horror fans deserve after putting up with the dreck that they usually have to settle with. (Now that was a long sentence.) It isn't the scariest movie ever, but it was a Kevin Costner cameo away from being close.

1540949,5,B00005JMA8,"Yet another one of the few movies that I consider worthy of re-watching. Though this is my favourite genre (hell, I even liked Waterworld), this movie was very well done. It's extremely dark and forboding. The atmosphere is incredibly good. Sure, it's not entirely realistic (I can't think of a virus that would hit you in 10 seconds and turn you freaky so fast), but details like that aside I consider this to be a pretty accurate depiction of how a catastrophe like this could hit the world.

Certain scenes are, of course, very memorable. Two in particular would be: 1) When what's-his-face wakes up and wanders around London, and nobody is around and 2) When what's-his-face et al. find a man and his daughter holed up, waiting everything out.

Movies like this make one think ""Damn, that could be me one day."" Will it be you? Almost certainly not, but this is fiction with a real possibility to it, and that's what makes it so visceral and real.",1098921600,,950,4.615384615384615
1540950,5,B00005JMA8,"I have begun to think that zombie movies are fundamentally about social alienation: the paranoid fantasy that anyone, even the people you love, can suddenly become an inhuman monster and turn against you.  This is definitely true of this movie, for me: I feel most scared by it when I am feeling most alienated and downtrodden by society.

In any case, this was the scariest movie I have ever seen. Not just make you jump scary but get under your skin and give you nightmares scary. After seeing it, I had to sleep with my lights on and doors open for two months. But also it really made me think about things like: what is civilization? At one point they have a captive infected and the army guy is studying him. The hero asks him what he has learned and he answers, ""I have learned that he will never bake bread."" Okay, laugh at me if you want, but I like to bake bread, the old-fashioned way, starting with yeast and doing it all by hand. But I never really thought about all the factors that baking bread depends on: the domestication of wheat, a process that took thousands of years; sufficient social organization to harvest, process and distribute it; my knowledge of the exact formula necessary to get the bread to work right; the gas company delivering gas to my apartment so I can bake it... and so on. What a long and fragile chain of things that could be broken at any link. That's civilization, something we all take for granted.

Another thing I really liked about this movie (although I will never see it again because it scared the heck out of me and anyway I can practically replay the whole thing in my memory) is the way certain otherwise ordinary moments are made transcendant--a bridge or an airplane brings almost you to a state of grace.

Finally, the army guys show that the potential for infection is not just from blood; it's in our blood. It doesn't take a lab experiment gone out of control. It could happen any time and does. That's what war is.",1098230400,13,1974,4.475

The survivors in the film seek each other out and learn that sanctuary can be found in the North.  Sanctuary is found at a military base camp and this is where the film goes somewhat awry.  Give credit to director Danny Boyle for mounting an impressive, scary picture on what was probably a limited budget by U.S. standards.

The story begins with an high energy, ironic twist as animal activists rescuing experimental monkeys end up releasing a viral epidemic.  The nearly instaneous and horrific effects of the virus are briefly shown before the film jumps 28 day later. We watch as a hospital patient arises from a coma to discover a seemily depopulated London.  These deserted London scenes are captivating. The story continues as he wanders about London to discover that he is not alone.

The concept has gaping holes. The virus acts nearly instantly, turning its victums into raging, vicious lunatics. This is just one of many implausible aspects of the story. Why don't the virus victims attack each other? Why don't animals, such as birds, catch and spread the virus? Why was the monkey watching violent TV images?

Who cares, the execution of the film is so great that I brushed past the impossible concept. I bought into the story and was swept along.

There are some classic scenes. The shopping spree in the supermarket was great and provided needed relief. But you could never rest truly easy as the directors keep the tension at a fever pitch.

The film takes pot shots at just about everything: animal rights, biological researchers, the military, bike messengers, taxi drivers and devoted parents.

Given the tone of the film, I did not expect the ""happy"" ending. But the ending was upbeat.  The DVD offers two alternate endings that were also fun to see.

The tension was so high that watching it was difficult.  But as I think back on the film, I liked it more. Give it a try.",1097798400,,1840,4.618461538461538
1541019,4,B00005JMA8,"This movie is SO much more than the horror/thriller genre designation indicates! Not really a zombie/shocker at all, but there are plenty of shocks. At times grisly, also has moments of humor & tenderness. Truly a study of human nature in unnatural circumstances.

(Those who point out its derivation from other films might benefit from a willingness to experience something for the first time, without fixating on the comparisons. This is very original & exciting, like a great song the first time you hear it - and just how many totally original songs do you think there are? It's all from the same 11 different notes...)

Beautiful is a strange word to apply to such a dreadful story, but Danny Boyle and the cinematography of this film provide many thought-provoking & beautiful scenes. (He deserves the compliment of 'Kubrick-esque' for this work.) The frantic strobing of 'the infected' is very effective, as is the grainy portrayal of dreams from the happy past. (For those of us with no stomach for gore, it is very easy to tell when a good time to shut your eyes is coming!) From a purely artistic standpoint, the imagery is masterfully woven into the fabric of the story. Thumbs WAY up.

A very haunting conceptualization of an inconceivable turn of events; if this one doesn't stir you, it's time to buy a burial plot. The additional material wasn't impressive, the alternate endings were certainly better left on the cutting room floor. So intense that it seems like a lot more time has passed, than what the DVD counter reads... Fine acting, especially from the leads.

DO NOT be afraid to try this one, it is a must-see... but it's certainly not for the kiddies.

1541020,3,B00005JMA8,"This film has received much praise for ""re-imagining"" the zombie movie, but in the end it does not add much to the genre. Boyle does come up with one, excellent innovation in that his zombies are very swift and effective hunters. They are creatures perpetually in a berserker rage totally consumed with a singular purpose: kill, kill and kill some more. This is a vast improvement over the typical movie zombie, whom we have never felt was much of a threat. True, they never stop chasing their prey, but they move at such a sloth-like pace that even the most out-of-shape victim should have no trouble evading them. If it weren't for those pesky tree roots tripping vacuous heroines, zombies would never get to eat.



The rest of the film, however, retraces the steps of many films that came before. Like The Omega Man we find an attractive, black female protagonist and vast shots of deserted streets in a major city. We have to wonder though, where are all the cars? Surely some people were able to take to the roads before the Rage hit. This detail distracted us in that all we could think was that this scene was shot at dawn before traffic hit and the Bobbies were able to cordon off the area. A few digitized cars with rotting bodies would have been a bit more apropos. We also see an ""infected"" captured so he can be studied by the military just as a zombie was in Day of the Dead. This particular ""homage"" was so obvious we half expected the zombie's name to be ""Bub."" Whether the story is derivative or just respectfully paying homage the fact remains that we have seen much of this all before.",1097193600,,1604,4.505154639175258

A relatively low key cast--one day directors will realise that big names detract from a plot and discourage people from viewing it, I can honestly say I refuse to watch movies with BIG names, especially Hollywood / American movies due to the unrealistic moods they carry--low budget English movie.

The plot, acting and atmosphere carry this piece and use of truly emotive aspects of civilisation and the potentiality of civilisation as a whole being taken away from us.

It follows the fragile persuits of a man who awakens from a coma to find that life in urban London has come to a halt, a kicking screaming horrific halt.  The terror of it all was great, truly a remarkable movie and definately up there in cult standards!",1096588800,3,947,4.857142857142857

The cinimatic style of this movie is quit addicting, which I found to be similar in The Beach.  The story is really good for this type of movie also and the characters are very beleiveable.  There's not too much blood, but there is a healthy amount.  It's worth it for anyone to see.",1096416000,2,404,4.405405405405405
1541024,1,B00005JMA8,"I wanted to love this movie. I really did. I love zombie films. But this film not only falls apart on its own logic, it ""borrows"" heavily from the zombie films that came before.  In the film, a virus has gotten out of a research facility and spreads throughout England, transforming the general populace into mindless maniacs (or zombies, as Danny Boyle referred to them). The main characters quickly find themselves in a world thrown into chaos, and discover that the rampaging hordes outside might not be the worst thing they have to face.

Okay, without giving to much away, let me explain the movie's basic zombie logic. A human being is infected with the virus (which shouldn't have gotten out of the research facility it was in in the first place), and then turns into a highly aggressive killer. Now, those infected aren't dead. They're still living human beings. But they kill everyone they meet. But if they kill every un-infected person they meet, how are there more of them? Wouldn't they kill themselves off? Apparantly there are thousands, if not millions, of wounds being delivered, but no killing, I guess. Oh man, such scary monsters.

This movie also reeks of the classic Romero trilogy. You can literally call off scenes from Night, Dawn, and Day of the Dead that are in 28 Days Later. It's like watching a Cliff's Notes version of the trilogy, but with less logic. If you're in the mood for a good zombie film, check out any of the Romero films, Dead Alive, or Evil Dead 2. But don't waste your time with this one.",1096243200,8,1533,4.649446494464945
1541025,4,B00005JMA8,"David Boyle directed this movie and created a movie that was thought provoking and entertaining at the same time. However this film has its faults, the movie begins strong enough with the opening scene in the animal cosmetic testing facility where scientist's have been working on a virus called 'Rage'. The director shows the viewer how the virus was passed on to humans from monkeys. This is a movie, but closely based on a reality we has a species may have to go through sooner or later.

Check out the bonus material and take a closer look at the alternate endings for this movie. I kind of liked the Radical theaterical ending that was shown via a story board. The ending they have in the movie was not that good. From a great start the movie became predictable.

Although I loved the movie and will watch it from time to time, I did give it 4 stars for the superb acting, great directorship and the first 45mins of the movie was 5 stars.",1096070400,,943,4.445086705202312
1541080,5,B00005JMA8,"Danny Boyle is a genius. He may not please everyone but his movies are often emotioning, agressive and in-your-face entertaining. This is no exception.
Those who absolutely love old classics like George A. Romero's zombies trilogy will be so much pleased to discover zombies horror movies with well-developed characters and story can still be made these days.

Zombies in this movie differently from Romero's movies are fast, smart and bloodthirsty as never seen before. Some elements were captured/adapted from the mentioned trilogy (noticeably the fact they keep a zombie in chains for experiments, an army of crazed military men, the supermarket scene and last but not least the fact that there's no beginning and no end to explain what's going on).

Enough said, go watch it if you like horror movies with much more than ""barely-naked-cheerleaders-running-away-from-buffy-like-vampires"" movies can offer. An underrated classic.",1095724800,3,931,5.549295774647887

1541083,4,B00005JMA8,"This movie is engrossing and fantastic for the first hour, then careens off the tracks into a weird and not-so-enjoyable finish.  I've seen the entire film three times, but I can watch the first hour over and over again, just for the film-making craft involved.  Danny Boyle loves, loves, loves movies, and it shows in this film.

And yes, the film is derivative -- name a post-1980 suspense film or horror film that is not one of the following: derivative (""Resident Evil""), a re-make (""The Ring""), or a parody (""Scream"").  Boyle's influences are great works, well-considered by him, and his movie is about two-thirds of a minor masterpiece.  I don't understand why someone would be especially harsh to this film -- if you didn't enjoy it, fine, but I think the widespread acclaim from numerous independent critics speaks for itself.

The opening sequence, with Jim coming out of his coma to find London abandoned, is spectacularly haunting.  In particular, use your DVD player to slow-mo Jim's open-mouthed puzzlement over the news kiosk with thousands of flyers and notes from people looking for loved ones or trying to rally friends and family to evacuation sites -- all of which occurred during the time that Jim was in a coma and while England was being overrun by the infectious virus that causes ""Rage,"" a disease that transforms an infected person almost instantly into a homicidal lunatic.  You can't read much of the flyers and messages at regular speed, but a great deal of care went into creating this scene in detail, and it's worth looking at more than once.  In a few seconds, this scene brilliantly conveys the chaos, trauma, and bleak desperation of an urban population going insane and consuming itself.  I found it much more moving and sad than, for example, the scenes of live-action calamity in Dawn of the Dead or the news videos in the same film.  Likewise, the message left for Jim by his parents, as well as the way he finds it, is heartbreaking.

The first hour or so is a riveting end-of-civilization, survivors-among-the-rubble story, combined with a lot of obvious and not-so-obvious symbolism relating to man's inhumanity to man and hubris of various stripes.  The film also has several genuinely frightening moments of being attacked by/running from ""the infected,"" i.e., the humans infected by Rage, along with an effectively brooding atmosphere that is a fine accompaniment to the storyline.

The survivors' trip north to search for help or a semblance of governmental authority is not problematic in itself, but conceptually this is where the wheels start to come off this movie.  Of course, suspending one's sense of disbelief is critical to a film like this, but the first two-thirds of the movie do exist within a very logical frame of Boyle's creation.  The last third, however, just creates a big question mark in terms of individual and group motivation.  Even in a suspense fantasy or sci-fi thriller, believable individual motivation is critical.  For example, consider Ripley's actions in going to retrieve Newt at the end of ""Aliens"" -- because we know Ripley's character and understand what motivates her, we find it believable that she would go back for the lost child.  It's a very satisfying penultimate sequence.

28 Days Later, on the other hand, creates a two-group dynamic between the survivors and a group of soldiers, who behave in a way -- and I don't want to give it away for those that have not seen it -- that does not seem logical given the situation.  While I can appreciate that a group of men in such a situation might behave poorly after all hope is lost, in this particular story, with the facts as laid out by the director, the events toward the end of the movie don't seem credible -- though they do help with the director's overarching message that we are already worse than the monsters that we might create.

If you like movies and the craft of movie-making, then I highly recommend this one.  If you are looking for a traditional zombie movie, this is not it.",1093996800,5,4030,4.8425655976676385
1541084,1,B00005JMA8,"How uninspiringly unoriginal. So, the movie dares you to imagine - what if there was a gloabal epidemic (and spread by apes, to boot)? I'm floored. Such genius! What a diabolically ingeneous directorial concoction! (Oh, btw, any coincidence to the decades-long AIDS pandemic supposedly spread by human contact with Rhesus monkeys is purely coincindental.)

That's pretty much what the movie is about. England is hit by monkey fever. Cities sprawl citizenless. Dead line the gutters. Everybody is evacuated. Wherever to? How? Which other country rolled out the red carpet for this seething mass with its baggage of potential human extinction? Ah, these are but minutiae, utterly trivial and irrelevant beneath the grandly sweeping brush of our director.

The infected undead (aka zombies) run amuck. You would do well to hack them to bits, because that is all this movie has got going for it. But pray tell, how do I tell a zombie from a good guy, before I merrily bludgeon him to a pulp? By their penchant for bulging red contact lenses, that's how. What's the matter with you? Never seen a real zombie movie before?

And so it meanders on. After the ape-holocaust, Jim meets Selena. Jim and Selena meet little girl and dad. Dad doesn't have his red contact lenses yet, and so the merry band wanders around looking for zombies to chop to bits. They run into bunch of soldiers. Soldiers are horny, and want women. Women don't want soldiers. Women only want to kill more zombies. Dad finally finds his contacts and tries them on, and would do a zombie proud. Hack, Hack, hack. Not any more.

Let's see.. hack, hack, hack some more, and presto - the convoy of soldiers is history. Hack, hack, hack, and liberating airplane flies directly overhead. Wave, wave, wave, and make arrangements for helicopter airlift.

The end.

The tag line on the DVD says ""Scariest movie since The Exorcist"". ""Truly terrifying"". ""Chilling"". Etc. If I were a zombie, I'd agree. I'd be truly chilled, terrified, horrified and apalled that my lot had been so completely trivialized by such dire lack of imagination. Zombies all over the world would hang their collective heads in shame, and realize that something more horrifying than the walking undead was on the loose - movie directors possessed of just one buttock.",1093910400,6,2293,4.912144702842378
1541085,3,B00005JMA8,"The Trainspotting team with Danny Boyle have made another good movie. This time about what will happen to England if there is an outbreak of a very deadly virus. It could be a scenario though up by people who know a lot about bioterror although it seems to be unlikely something like this will happen. It's fact and fiction, like a horror story. The virus is passed through by blood, no strange things there, but they almost turn into zombies, and that seems unlikely.

Someone wakes up in a deserted hospital, not knowing what happened. He finds a few people and they try to get to the neighborhood of Manchester where still some normal people are. They are not so normal after all and things turn bad.

I haven't seen all the alternate endings and would really like to. The 'normal' version ends a little too happy.",1093824000,,817,4.551020408163265
1541086,5,B00005JMA8,"The post apocalyptic story of Danny Boyle's movie '28 Days Later' seems to borrow from just about every other film of this genre, including `On the Beach', `The Stand', `Damnation Alley', `The Andromeda Strain', `Lord of the Flies', `The Omega Man', `The Twelve Monkeys' and the `...Living Dead' movies. In spite of the cribbing, the movie is better, in many ways much better than `Damnation Alley', `The Andromeda Strain', and `The Omega Man', and it equals and surpasses in many ways the `... Living Dead' flicks.

One of the movie's strongest aspects is something it shares with `Lord of the Flies' in that it explores the behavior of normal men and women put into this very unusual circumstance, and shows that it is quite possible for baser emotions and inclinations may come through in spite of their being contrary to the well being of the entire group. In many ways, the basic premise is also more interesting than `The Stand' in that the heavy that emerges after the run of superflu is not human nature, but a supernatural evil who takes advantage of the situation. While this creates some very unusual plot lines and leaves room for human frailty to take its toll, it is not as interesting as tragedy based on purely human failings.

My biggest problem with the movie is the improbability of its premise and the even greater improbability of civilization's reaction or inability to react to the situation. Like `The Andromeda Strain', the movie is based on a speed of infection and effect which simply does not seem biologically possible. At least in `The Andromeda Strain', the infecting agent was extra-terrestrial. Once you assume an infection that takes effect in 20 seconds, the reaction of healthy human civilization does not seem nearly as adequate as it would actually be if that situation really arose. `The Stand' makes the spread of its superflu believable because it does not have a startling effect. It starts like a simple cold, so health officials simply do not recognize the danger until it's too late and the superflu has spread too far in the general population.

The second big improbability is the fact that no larger groups of people within the environs of London were able to create enclaves of normal people. If a squad of ten (10) soldiers could create an island of normal humans, why couldn't a battalion or a regiment or a division or even an entire army base create a similar much larger refuge and jumping off base by which they could recover control of cities after the infected people die out. It is made clear in the movie that the infected people have virtually no ability to do anything except stay out of the sun in the daytime and search out and infect normal people at night. It is clear that since they don't even seem to have any interest in eating in spite of the ample supplies of groceries in abandoned markets, they are not likely to last more than a few weeks.

But if you are willing to buy into the two big assumptions, the story and its presentation by actors, director, and technical crew is well worth the viewing time. A bonus for American audiences is the English setting. One can get very tired of movies set in LA or LA making believe it is some other unspecified American city. One can even get tired of NY as a site of catastrophe movies. London and the English accents are a very nice change. The clever camera work in showing the infected bezerkers in a kind of jerky double speed possibly borrowed from Alfred Hitchcock's famous `Psycho' shower scene works well and enhances the sense of near helplessness in the face of the speed on onset of the infection.

While this has many similarities with some famous horror movies, I think it is much fairer to class this as a science fiction movie, as the really interesting aspect of the movie is less the danger from the infected than it is the effect of this threat on the people we encounter as the plot develops.

The bonus features on this DVD lists `Audio Commentary' by the director, but be warned that this is not audio commentary on the full movie. It is only commentary on a series of stills taken by photographers doing shots to help publicize the film and by continuity staff to keep makeup and wardrobe consistent from shot to shot. The comments are interesting takes on the stunts and the effort to film empty London streets and the M1 highway, but they don't give much insight into some of the basic questions in the story.

The story has a few other contrivances, such as the decision to go through a tunnel in daylight when you are trying to escape people who can only operate in the dark, the lack of any weapons more lethal than a machete when firearms are proven effective against the infected later in the movie, and a brightly lit grocery store when previous evidence was the fact that central electricity had gone missing. Where were those deadly samurai swords when you really need them?

These are minor quibbles and every sci-fi movie has their share. The overall effect of the story is chilling, made even more so by the reactions of the normal humans than by the actions of the infected.

Highly recommended for all sci-fi and horror fans with a reasonably strong stomach.",1093824000,,5211,4.673936750272628

I thought the first half was great - but the stuff with the soldiers just didn't work as well. Had the four characters from the first half continued their journey's through post-apocalyptic Britain, I think the movie would have turned out more as a character study with a crazy zombie movie background.

1541153,3,B00005JMA8,"I've read some reviews here and everyone seems split on this film: either it's the greatest thing since sliced bread or it's a boring waste of time. I found it to be somewhere in between: good for what it was, but would've been great due to what it could've been.

First off, I don't consider this to be a zombie film, it barely passes as a horror film. The film deals with a viral infection and has more in common with Romero's THE CRAZIES than his DEAD films. The infected are also fast moving and remind me of the creatures in Argento's DEMONS. The second half, or last third, reminded me of the horror film DOG SOLDIERS. I liked DOG SOLDIERS somewhat, but that's where I felt this movie 'lost it's way'.

See, I enjoyed the desolate feel at the beginning, the survival aspect of the film, the sci-fi(rage virus) meets horror(the infected) dimension of the film. But when they hook up with the soldiers at the base about halfway through the film, I felt it took on an action(machine gun toting soldiers) meets drama(what's gonna happen to the two females in a base full of soldiers) plotline that detracted from the original theme. Of course, some people may prefer the second half as it is more action-packed, and it does have that character drama in it(which more astute viewers can read all sorts of meaning and symbolism into). But personally, I enjoyed the more apocolyptic first half than the Rambo meets 'women in distress' second half. That's why I was disappointed with this film and don't rank it as a great sci-fi/horror film or a classic in general. Good for what it was, but could've/should've been better.

Interestingly, on the extras portion of the dvd, the filmmakers have a 'radical alternative ending'(actually, it's a long animated storyboard for the second half and doesn't even include the soldiers subplot at all) that I think would've made for a better film as it concentrates more on the three main characters and their search for a cure and survival. There is a commentary track for this ending and they tell you why they scrapped this idea; but I think with some tweaking, this direction for the film(or some other one) would've been better. But that's just me. As is, it's not the highly original masterpiece others make it out to be nor is it total trash either. Certainly worth a rental to make up your own mind about its merits and shortcomings.",1092441600,,2379,4.65952380952381
1541154,1,B00005JMA8,"A very tacky, politically correct, horror sci/film that has nothing going for it except for a generic screenplay, bad acting, and very cheap special effects.

The story starts with Jim (Cillian Murphy) waking up in deserted hospital in the middle of London.  He soon realizes that the entire city is deserted and the film goes back in time to tell us how it got that way.  It so happens that humans have been infected by a rage virus which takes 28 days to incubate.  The virus was in experimental chimps who were freed by overzealous animal activists.  The film then becomes a cat-and-mouse thriller between normal humans and infected humans.

A very bland film with politically correct undertones about the value of liberal activists and the dangers of the military establishment.  A very contrived film with a cheap plot, lousy acting, and lousier still special effects.  Avoid at all costs!",1092009600,4,894,4.913333333333333
1541155,4,B00005JMA8,"Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later gives new hope that the horror genre --- especially the zombie film subgenre --- is hitting a new rennaissance. Using a very taut and intelligent screenplay from Alex Garland (The Beach, Tesseract), Boyle infuses his low-budget film with equal doses of scares and social commentary.

 Many have dubbed 28 Days Later as one of the best zombie films to come out in the last 10 years. I would agree if this was a true zombie film. This film doesn't have zombies, but it has something just as terrifying: ""infected"" human beings. The plot of 28 Days Later pretty much is the British Isles, and maybe the entire world, after an accidental release of a man-made virus that causes uncontrollable, primal rage on all who gets ""infected"". The zombie angle comes from the fact that the tone of the film has alot of similarities to George Romero's Living Dead Trilogy.

 In fact, Boyle and Garland must've been very big Romero fans because 28 Days Later is pretty much a Romero's Dead Trilogy condensed and wrapped up into a nice British packaging. If it was any other director and screenwriter this film would end up like some pale imitation, but in Boyle and Garland's worthy hands 28 Days Later becomes like a nice Valentine to the zombie-master himself.

 The acting by the cast helps hold the story together. One thing about horror films that has always made it like the bastard child of filmmaking is the lack of good acting. 28 Days Later doesn't have this problem. The stand out performances are those of Cillian Murphy and Naomie Harris as the two main protagonists. Their acting makes the audience care as to how they will survive the insanity and hell that has sprung up around them. Christopher Eccleston, as the British Army commander, makes as imposing presence in the film. Brendan Gleeson's quiet and fatherly take on his Frank character rounds out the cast.

 The use of digital cameras by Boyle give 28 Days Later a very documentary look. This is very effective in that it makes the audience feel like what they are seeing could be something that came out of news footage. It becomes almost voyeuristic at times. The digital look will sometimes get too obvious and take the audience out of its rhythm, but it doesn't happen too often and usually something intense comes up to get them back into the film.

 Overall, 28 Days Later does a great job of being a tense and intelligent horror film. This is not your cynical, wink-at-the-audience Scream type film, but a straight, balls-out horror that owes more to the classics that came out during the 70's. Hopefully, the planned sequel --- tentatively titled 28 Weeks Later --- will be just as good.",1091577600,7,2681,4.733905579399142
1541156,2,B00005JMA8,"28 Days later was a terrible disappointment to me.  I had heard about how wonderful this movie was from a bunch of my friends that are into horror movies, so I gave this a whirl and was ready to flush it down the toilet.  The movie is about some monkeys that had a disease that turned people into blood raging freaks that crave human flesh.  Though they are never really identified as zombies, they are close enough.

So this guy wakes up 28 days after the initial outbreak of the disease to find that almost all of England has been abandoned. So he tries to figure out what happened while attempting to survive and you follow him along on his journey as he meets different people and interacts with humans that are and are not infected.  There are a few different endings to view, but in the end, the movie just didn't do it for me.

I can see where people loved this movie, it wasn't such an all out horror movie and there were a few interesting twists to the plot, but overall, it came down to the fact that I eventually was waiting for everyone to die or escape so I could go do something else.",1091232000,9,1098,4.2548076923076925
1541157,4,B00005JMA8,"The movie introduces itself in a testing lab set in contemporary London. A couple of animal-rights activists break into the lab, open a cage door with a screaming and terrifying looking chimp inside despite the pleads of the scientist in the lab, ""They are infected."" And thus, begins the story of ""28 Days Later"". Cillian Murphys character wakes up from a coma to find London deserted, what a mystery this becomes. He soon runs into bllod thirsy zombie/humans who we're over-taken by the disease and their only motive is to slaughter him. Cillian soon finds healthy human beings struggling to survive. This may sound like a trashy science-fiction zombie flick but it is so much more. The atmosphere of the film is so carefully put together it leaves you with bad dreams, even if you are the most tolerant of horrifying films. The subtle moments in which Cillian is walking the empty streets of London are gut wrenching and eerie because the audience knows something will pop out from the corner. The entire movie follows a complicated structure but it is very balanced with great performances, especially Naomi Harris. This is so much more than just a thriller, it is a real film about the complexity of human nature, and oh yeah-creepy as hell.",1091059200,4,1246,4.827102803738318

What a waste. From what I can remember (it was so boring to me it's hard to), it starts out eerie, which was cool, but it becomes so dull and loses all point half way through the movie. It's hard to stay interested in what happens to the people involved. One thing I liked about it was that the zombies were fast, but instead of looking scary, I just thought they looked funny. This movie was also way too long. I fell asleep in both sittings of trying to watch it. So take my advice, do not buy this movie UNLESS you KNOW you will like it.

1541159,3,B00005JMA8,"Director Danny Boyle (Trainspotting, Shallow Grave) set out to make an old-fashioned B-movie and shot it all on digital video camera and a shoe-string budget. Borrowing heavily from George Romero's B-movie classic zombie flicks, Boyle produces a decent, well-acted, character-driven zombie flick. In this one, the zombies aren't the slow, staggering corpses of the Romero oeuvre; they are fast as lightning and mad as hell, so the survivors need to keep on their toes. And instead of an infected human taking days to transform (as he keeps his infection a secret from the others), this virus takes effect right away, forcing survivors to quickly and brutally dispatch their companions before they turn, while they are still recognizably their friends--a far more traumatic test of one's character.

As usual with the B-movie horror/suspense genre, there are plenty of holes in the plot and unintelligent behaviour by our heroes. The ending falls a little flat and borrows too heavily from Romero's weakest flick, Day of the Dead. Still, it's good to have a solid recent entry in the vanishing B-movie genre. Let's have a few more of them...and lower the admission price or at least double-bill 'em. That's the whole point of the genre!",1090627200,,1235,5.1138613861386135

Its about a few people left to fight off crazy insane humans who have been infected from a lab accident and roam the country killing the uninfected humans. That sounds like a pretty cool storyline except there was way too much of the main characters sitting around telling us their hopes and dreams and not enough good old killing and maiming.
  For this infection to have swept the country there sure didn't seem to be the thousands of crazy infected wild people we should expect to see. In fact the humans we follow in the film carried a baseball bat and a machete to fend off these crazies. So there is a lot of nonsensical stuff in this film and not enough gore and insane violence that I expected. The last half of the film goes off on a tangent ,not about fighting the insane people,but of the heroes trying to get away  from a militia leader and his pack of horny underlings. Predictable stuff where the ""military men want our women and we must fight for their honor"" kinda crapola. A lame bit of business in what was advertized to be a cool zombie type film.

1541236,1,B00005JMA8,"28 days later is without a doubt the worst movie ever made, even
in britain or america. it is a libelious rip of the ''night of the living dead, dawn of the dead, and day of the dead'' trilogy that i am surprised george romero didn't sue for copyright infringement. but then again ''28 days later'' was such an awful film beyond anyone's comprehension that he didn't have to sue. no this film pretty much speaks for it's awful. horrible scripting, horrible acting, slowpacing self.
The film's plot is that virus (yes like night of the living dead and romero's flick ''the crazies'') has infected many area of the uk. jim (cillian murphy) is apparently the only dumb smuck not infected along with a girl named selena (naomi harris). well from here on out these two dimwits and their friend mark now fight of zombies i mean rage people with bats and a machete. lol
In order for the idiotic danny boyle to not appear as he is copying romero (which he does anyway), he invents a new plot in middle. see the virus infects people and takes over within 30 seconds, whereas romero's zombies start reacting after an hour or so of being dead.
we get some shots of london and manchester but those shots didn't matter as the film is a mess. not even an entertaining mess, its just plain doggy doo.
There is another rip of ''dawn of the dawn'' when jim, selena and their new friends frank and hannah, scourged and plunger an abandonded supermarket to their hearts contents. this is reminiscent of the abandonded shopping plaza where the ''survivors'' exploit the plaza while the zombies on the outside are trying to get in. what a rip. another scenes that rips of romero is where boyle for shock value has a young boy who has the disease attack jim. the scene ends with jim getting a baseball bat and killing the boy. this was
a bit of copy of the dead films like the first one where we see the first zombie  girl in a zombie movie (the girl kills her mothers, then girl is killed herself).
Well the copying of Romero doesn't end there because Jim and others find a military complex which is really an abandonded plaza where Major West (Christopher Eccleston), an arrogant military commander attacks the rage people.
Well the rip here is that West like Dr. Logan (from Day) has a zombie, I mean rage person on a leach trying to the dead thing new tricks. LOL My god as you can very well see ''28 Days Later'' is a such rip of the great Romero it ain't funny. However, it's such a poor ripoff  of the work of Romero that the movie fails at every level.
There is hardly any suspense, until the last 10 minutes, the characters are horrible including Jim who by God is one of the ugliest actors I've seen. The ending is cheesy and dumb.
Mr. Cillian Murphy and others do such a poor job of acting that it's hard to fathom that this guy will play a big lead in the next Batman movie (''Batman Begins'').",1088553600,4,2884,4.429378531073446

Its a classy style horror film and with the way its shot and acted, its especially eerie and creepy. The scence with the zombies is shot unusual but very nicley. Its a jerky camera motion, like they took out frames and then put the film back together...its cool.

I left the theater thinking ""what the hell was that"". I thought the plot was just stupid and there were certain scenes that were simply unnecessary.  Some scenes look as if they were just thrown in there to add time to the movie so the movie wasn't only 30 minutes.  The opening is probably the most boring since there is about 15 minutes of nothing except a man walking around an empty city.  I understand that was used to show that everyone died but for goodness sakes did it have to seem like it went on for days?  I got the point after about 2 minutes of it. I did not like it and do not recommend it to people usless they really really like the zombi coming back to life and killing humans so they can live thing.

1541305,2,B00005JMA8,"When initial reports about Danny Boyle's ""28 Days Later"" began filtering in to my headquarters, I exulted aloud about the possibilities of a resurgence of the zombie genre. Could we dare hope for a return to the days when films like Lucio Fulci's ""Zombie"" and the Romero pictures appeared with frightening regularity? Well, all hopes for more pictures featuring the walking dead, at least in the traditional sense, dimmed considerably after I finally watched this movie. Boyle's oeuvre commences with one slam-bang scene after another before settling down to a rather mundane series of events. An uneven movie in every respect, ""28 Days Later"" did not maintain this viewer's interest. This zombie picture does not improve significantly on the traditional shambling dead films of the 1970s and 1980s. History will consign it to the cinematic ash heap labeled with the ""They tried but could not quite pull it off"" tag. A true pity since the filmmakers actually explored a few intriguing ideas that should have worked.
Jim (Cillian Anderson) wakes up from a coma to an unfamiliar world. There does not seem to be anyone around, not in his room nor in the entire hospital. Wandering through the deserted corridors, all he finds is desolation and destruction. Litter drifts along the floors, chairs and equipment lie in heaps, and an eerie silence hangs oppressively. Jim's sense of awe about his surroundings grows by leaps and bounds as he walks out into the street. He finds no one, not a single, solitary living soul anywhere in the city. His footfalls echo down abandoned London streets as birds soar amidst the silent buildings. The occasional wrecked automobile and a bulletin board plastered inches deep with missing person notices hint at some sort of enormously ominous event having occurred while Jim slumbered on a gurney. With no other place to go in the immediate vicinity, he wonders into a church only to espy mounds of bodies heaped in the pews. Then, he hears a roar of rage. As Jim turns to flee the building, a priest lurches out of a shadowy doorway, moving strangely and mumbling unintelligibly. The man of the cloth suddenly charges our hero, and the game is afoot. As he races from the church and retreats down the street chased by several of these people, two strangers rescue him by heaving Molotov cocktails at the pursuers. Congratulations. You just finished watching the best part of ""28 Days Later.""
Jim learns from his two saviors that a virus unleashed from a medical lab by a bunch of save the earth types swept England, turning ordinary citizens into frothing at the mouth zombies fueled by an boundless rage. The living attempted to leave the country even as the virus spread to points beyond the United Kingdom. As soldiers set up roadblocks throughout the country, civilization gave way to anarchy. After Jim learns his parents took the easy way out, and after a close call with one of the rage filled zombies that resulted in the demise of one of his rescuers, he and Selena (Naomie Harris) meet up with Frank (Brendan Gleeson) and his daughter Hannah (Megan Burns). The four set out for a checkpoint that is still sending a radio signal promising a cure. After a lengthy trip that bonds the four together, they discover that the soldiers at the military installation do not promise a cure. These motley men, led by a Major Henry West (Christopher Eccleston), are largely content to defend their perimeter from the occasional zombie incursions. Moreover, as time goes by the men begin to show sinister interest in Selena and Hannah, much to the consternation of Jim. What started out as a promising film loaded with suspense rapidly disintegrates into a rather pedestrian attack on the big old bad military.
""28 Days Later"" still sports heaping quantities of gore, solid performances from a mostly unknown cast, and a strong central premise. The idea that rage could one day turn people into mindless zombies is a good one. When you have zombies, you also have suspense, which Boyle realizes through several tension filled scenes in a dark tunnel and in an abandoned roadside marketplace (shades of ""Dawn of the Dead"" in the latter). The use of digital cinematography works well by giving the movie a candy colored dream-like quality that makes the violence all the more effective when zombies burst on the scene out of nowhere. It's so heartbreaking that Boyle allowed the picture to turn into a by the numbers chase movie after the group arrives at the military base. The massive PR campaign launched when this film came out, and the attendant hubbub among the horror crowd, probably insures that a sequel could amble down the road in the near future. The conclusion of the film should quell rumors of a ""28 Days Later, Part 2""-would they call it ""31 Days Later""?-but always remember good box office receipts never stopped Hollywood from trying.
The DVD contains more extras than you would expect on a single disc. It offers commentaries, deleted scenes, a behind the scenes featurette, storyboards, a music video, galleries, and three disappointing alternate endings. One of these conclusions consists of nothing other than storyboards with voice-overs from the filmmakers. The other two offer nothing radically different from the one we get in the film. Thinking about the picture in retrospect, I am surprised that I cannot find the heart to recommend it. Horror fans will obviously see it no matter what anyone says, as I did, but moviegoers looking for a scary movie could do much better by choosing amongst a host of other similarly themed films that work much better than this one.",1087084800,4,5623,4.913774973711882
1541306,5,B00005JMA8,"This movie is more than just a ""zombie flick"".  I'm not going to go fanboy on you over it but I will say it's a solid film in it's genre.
It's beginning leads us not only into the plight of the main character but also gives us a feeling of quiet desperation as he roams the streets looking for any sign of life in a world turned upside down while he was out of it.
The ""zombies"" aren't actually zombies... the movie even deals with that by calling them infected.  This movie ushered in a new era for the zombie flick featuring fast moving very contagious (one drop o' blood will do it) madmen contaminated with rage and willfully spreading the disease.
In the slow moments, as all great horror movies must have to let the viewer check if their heart has yet exploded, they give us vital plot.  More importantly than that, the cast gives you a realistic look at what someone who's going through a crisis of this magnitude might be thinking.  We'd all try to make sence of it when we had the time to catch our breath.

I considered 28 Days Later more a movie of suspense than true horror and without doubt it was worth my attention, held my attention and the great care, editing, action and dialogoue are a tribute to its creaters.
Set in a world beset with a plaque that fills that person with immediate rage (this is by no means a slow paced thriller) it has more in common with Stephen King's The Stand than it does with zombies.  In truth it is basically a story of survival and commiment to others and what is learned along the path when your world or the world you know is taken away from you.

1541308,3,B00005JMA8,"What begins as a promising scenario of the apocalypse ultimately transforms into a brainless gore fest--it almost seems as if the director tried to both delight the intelligence and pander to the base, but did the work so sloppily that the combination merely splatters into a jumbled mess of indecisions. The early part of the movie--beautifully suffused with sepia tone and amateurish touch--portends ominous gloom, but once the point is streched an hour too long the movie becomes a repetitious bore; only to descend into a blood and flesh spurt-o-rama during its unmajestic ending. 28 minutes later into the story, we actually root for the zombies as they become a more animated and interesting presence than the wandering humans.
If there is a saving grace to the film, it is its consistently cynical outlook. The take-home message, that humanity is capable of a force more pernicious than the most destructive epidemic, is a chilling proposition, yet seemingly true, if today's events are any measure of what awaits us in the near future. It is a scary world, indeed.",1086220800,7,1072,5.02808988764045

Well again I was wrong. This wasn't a zombie flick at all,
this movie was only suppose to make you think of a few
things...
It was as the disease was called in the movie rage. Now thing about, rage hits the streets everyday, to some extent how far would a human mind go?
In this case '28 Days Later' the 'rage'of one person pent up feeling boiling over in to hate, anger, hurt, fear, and among other things.
It was paranoia, (we see this everyday) the paranoia of thinking what would it be like if you were the only one,
being alone, no one to care for you and to take care off,
the only person in the world, losing your mind, losing your state of being, and to or or what purpose?
And love, in any movie of any kind their is always the need for love. It's a sentiment that eases the hurt and suffer the pain (now that's an oxy moron, but think about it)
One thing that really got my attention was the fact that the director payed really close and minor attention to the main characters, Cillian Murphy and Naomie Harris ....

The first hour and a half of this movie were terrific, I was spellbound, but everything just fell apart in the last twenty minutes and the ending was just so typical.  The ending was so bad that it reminded me of your average, run of the mill Hollywood horror movie.  This brought to mind the bad ending of the novel ""Hannibal"" by Thomas Harris.

This movie has the feel of a really good Independant film.  Dont get me wrong, this movie is terrifying stuff.  Cilian Murphy plays a guy who wakes up 28 days after the virus was unleashed in a hospital.  He meets Naomie Harris's character who is a woman will do anything to stay alive, including killing her best friend seconds after he had been exposed to the virus in a bloody violent, hard to watch, but awesome scene.
The only reason this movie isn't 5 stars for me is because of the actual theatrical ending.  It wasn't a pleasant movie.  It was sad and depressing, so the ending shouldn't have been pleasant.  If you wanna watch this as a 5 star movie, watch it with the ending that ended on the cutting room floor.  The ending is much darker and much much better for the mood of the movie.  I think Danny Boyle actual likes that ending better too.
That alternate ending is on the DVD along with another ending, and a very interesting ending to the second half of the movie.  It's also got the trailer, a documentary, a very entertaining commentary by Danny Boyle, the director, and the writer.  I recomend this movie to all horror fans and to anybody that likes good movies.",1085356800,3,1451,4.462121212121212

A group of people wander London trying to get back to ""civilization.""  While the characters in George Romero's classic were interesting and you really felt for them, these characters are dull and sometimes act crazy themselves.
The British accents were very difficult to understand at times.  The climatic ending is in no way as good as Romero's film.  In this film the survivors of the group keep trying to catch the attention of some overflying aircraft.  They rig a big message and I guess they are rescued because the next scene is says it is 28 days later and the main character is in a hospital.  Not worth buying.",1085270400,,856,4.666666666666667
1541384,5,B00005JMA8,"Let's get two things straight. Firstly, all zombie movies are a bit clich because there are only so many things zombies can do. (Pretty much scare people, eat brains and get shot.) Secondly, 28 Days Later isn't a zombie movie, not really. While it has a similar feel, and the writer & director were inspired by geniuses like George Romero, the people in this movie simply are not zombies. They are still alive, they just have a blood disease, they are infected with rage. This is why, throughout the film, they refer to them as ""the Infected"" and not ""the dead"" or ""the walking dead"" or anything of the sort.

28 Days Later begins with Jim (Cillian Murphy), who has just awoken in the hospital. He finds himself alone. Alone in the room, alone in the building, alone in London. While the woken-at-the-end-of-the-apocalypse is not a new idea, the first 15 minutes of this movie manages to re-do it in a way that is still absolutely chilling. Still we smile and understand what Jim is feeling when he scoops up the money he finds in the street. Eventually, Jim is rescued by two other survivors who are holed up in a convenience store. They fill him in on what has happened - a blood virus has broken out in London which causes people to go mad with rage and kill everyone they see. Jim somehow convinces them to go find his parents who are halfway across town. Themajority of the film consists of travelling and hiding. When they come across some more survivors who have nearly run out of food and water, they decide to follow instructions that have been broadcasted on the radio about the ""answer to infection"". What they do find is somethingdifferent all together....

There are some obvious nods to George Romero in 28 Days Later. When the group raids a grocery store we can't help but recall Dawn Of the Dead. Additionally, the latterthird of the movie is obviously influenced by Day Of the Dead - there are just too many similarities to ignore. Yet, it doesn't feel over-done, and it doesn't feel like a direct rip-off. Three cheers to the brilliant director, Danny Boyle, for that one.

The extras on the DVD, well let's face it, they could never be enough. The 'Making Of' documentary isn't really a making of - it's more of a scientific look at the idea behind the story and is quite fascinating. The deleted scenes and alternate endings are as tasty as the movie itself, and the photo galleries are a must see - the still photographer they had on set was simply stunning.

I have to admit - I'm a zombie (and Infected) lover. I'm a horror lover. (Perhaps also a Cillian Murphylover.) I have to rate this movie with 5 stars. I think everyone should see it. I want to push it on them like a religion. I consider it a must see and a must buy.",1085097600,6,2747,4.498997995991984
1541385,2,B00005JMA8,"What the heck happened?  After a dramatic start that sets the table for pending doom and fatalism, 28 DAYS LATER devolves into a trite and lackluster military bash.  It was much more interesting watching Cillian Murphy and Naomie Harris doing battle with hordes of infected humans rather than a platoon of nimrods, but apparently director Danny Boyle decided a jarhead in fatigues was scarier than a snarling pack of red-eyed demons.  I know I'm shaking in my sandals.
Again, the entire premise of this film is fascinating:  A young man (Murphy) awakens from a 28-day coma to discover a deserted world.  Well, not entirely deserted--the shadow of night brings out a demented population of enraged people infected with a very cranky virus.  And like the zombie movies of old, the infected have a desire to kill the uninfected.  Thus, Jim, our hero, is rescued by a tiny band of ""normal"" humans, led by Selena (Harris), who possesses loads of street smarts and attitude.
The stage is set for a spellbinding, apolcalpytic tale--a grand tale of survival against overwhelming odds--but instead, 28 DAYS LATER dissolves into utter nonsense when our group of heroes abandons London and travels north, lured by a military radio broadcast promising safety in the wildnerness.  When I discovered the ""real reason"" for the broadcast I laughed so hard I rolled out of my chair, and almost hit the ""STOP"" button once and for all.  Once the conflict with about one dozen soldiers is established, the zombies merely become props.  Heck, the zombies even become instruments for the protagonists.
Go figure.
On second thought, don't waste your time figuring.  28 DAYS LATER is one of the most frustrating films I've ever watched, as golden potential for a white-knuckle thriller was squandered and subsequently flushed away down a cinematic commode.

Shot on digital video, this is an extremely cheap, visually ugly film which rips off George Romero's zombie trilogy, especially elements of Day of the Dead (the weakest of the Romero trilogy) and also adds in what are now hoary cliches from other post-apocalypse films. The film's one inventive touch is that the virally infected don't lumber around aimlesly but are infused with an almost superhuman strength and speed. Other than that, I won't belabor you with my litany of complaints about this film, since there's already a surfeit of negative reviews posted. However, I was particularly offended by the deliberate stupidity of some the plot, such as the infected soldier who is chained up, who you just KNOW is going to get loose to wreak havoc, and the putative hero Jim's act of setting him free, and the whole last act of the film.",1084665600,5,979,4.764705882352941

1541449,2,B00005JMA8,"With the exception of the opening 10 minutes, 28 Days Later fails completely. The scenes of the Jim (Cillian Murphy) walking around an abandoned, completely deserted London are creepy and un-nerving. The scenes that hint at mystery and unknown danger are far more intriguing than the rest of the movie.
As soon as Jim hooks up with other survivors the scares are lost. Danny Boyle stupidly telegraphs every jump to the point of disqualification. When the survivors leave London and are 'rescued' by a bunch of thuggish army louts it degenerates into extremely cruddy sub-straight-to-video nonsense. I've never seen a film lose its way so badly as this. What could have been really exciting and scary ends up being too cheap and confused.
There are hardly any 'zombies' in this movie. Any action or thrills are over within seconds and the complete lack of logical thinking (even within the morally bankrupt army) becomes annoying.
It did appreciate the raw-looking photography, it gave the movie a realistic edge but it's soon ruined as the plot meanders and doesn't know what to do. Cillian Murphy was quite good as the hero but the woman playing Selena was too brutish and hostile to be sympathetic. I did like Brendan Gleeson's character but he wasn't in it long enough.
Mainly, 28 Days Later suffers badly from minimal plotting, awkward characters, a distinct lack of scares and a corny ending that's out of sync with everything that preceded it. Danny Boyle should NOT attempt horror again.
The DVD is in 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5.1 sound. Extras include a commentary, documentary and deleted scenes. The cut scenes (and alternate ending) are worthless and not interesting.

1541452,2,B00005JMA8,"Sadly, it's NOT a sequel to Sandra Bullock's '28 Days' - I think I would have enjoyed it more if it had have been.
I thought it would have been creepy. It wasn't.
I thought the main characters would have ended up being infected. They weren't.
The underlying love story? Adam & Eve nonsense, two people forced together, due to them having to repopulate the world or whatever.
So what exactly was the point of this film? It seemed disjointed, and seemed to have no idea what direction it wanted to go in. And I nearly fell asleep during it, although I was coming close, and struggling to keep my eyes open, when thankfully it got switched off. Only kidding. It got paused. But that gave me the chance to wake myself and splash my face with cold water. And then I watched the rest of the film. Interesting as it was.
It's a British film, which means Americans wouldn't like it, but if they'd done this kind of film, they probably would have over-dramatised it and maybe made a better job. (I said maybe) Being a British movie, it had a real edge to it, to see what Danny Boyle was going to come up with now.
The whole love story was totally dense, and felt like it was put together at the last moment. And for any ladies reading this, would you honestly go up to a guy and kiss him, when he's covered in blood? Something tells me you wouldn't. Why did there have to be a love story anyway?
There are actually some good points to this movie. Seeing main cities, like London, completely deserted. No people, no cars, nothing. It felt rather eerie.
If you like these kind of non-interesting movies, which no one else owns, or even likes, then sure, go for it. Just don't expect a sequel to 28 Days.",1084320000,,1692,4.340694006309148

This is how it is for the hero of Danny Boyle's jarring 28 DAYS LATER. London England has been swept clean of her inhabitants, at least those of the normal variety. What is left are roaming bands of bloodthirsty maniacs, driven insane by a virus that quickly decimated the population. The story is good, owing much to both Night and Dawn Of The Dead, The Crazies, The Omega Man, Last Man On Earth, and even The Day Of The Triffids. We follow the uninfected survivors as they attempt to make it to an oasis of sanity they've heard about on the radio. A place that promises sanctuary and salvation for our battle-weary adventurers. Will they make it? What, if anything will they find there? We get to join them in their quest, hoping that they make it before some infected nut gets a hold of them. 28DL, like Boyle's Trainspotting, offers us a ride that may not take us where we want to go. Where Trainspotting showed us the utter deadness of addiction, 28DL shows us survival in it's most raw form. Just watch what these people have to do to stay alive. Watch who they must kill.

We get no action, no scenes of the plague going down, no chaos....nothing. The movie completely skips it.

1541456,3,B00005JMA8,"Almost everything in this movie has been done before.  It was predictable and provoked no thought whatsoever.  You can tell which characters are going to die as soon as they're introduced, and when they do, it's anticlimactic because you saw their demise coming from miles away.
Many questions arise that are never addressed--why do the ""infected"" attack anything that moves, yet they don't attack each other?  And what animal-rights activists would be stupid enough to release a chimp from a cage when they're TOLD the chimp is infected and highly contagious?  It would have made more sense for one person to be opening a pen while another scans through lab notes that detail the virus, realizing their mistake a moment too late.
""28 Days Later"" did evoke emotions, but only those of annoyance and exasperation.  This is one of those movies where you throw your arms in the air and say, ""Okay, WHY did they just do that?  Okay, WHAT is happening?!"" because the characters are often foolish, and the camera shakes so much.  I wasn't the only viewer confused during the film, and there's no reason it SHOULD have been confusing because the confusion was caused by jerky action sequences, not anything cognitive whatsoever.
The redeeming qualities of this movie are the acting and the character's roles.  There are no B-movie performances to be found, and it's refreshing that a female (Selena) is such a strong character AND she's never nude (unlike the male lead).  The script is very good for the most part, though there were some groan-inducing moments that kept the film from ever being taken seriously.
If you've read ""The Stand"" and ""Watership Down,"" you have already seen this movie in the theatre of your own mind, and I've concluded the theme of the movie is that animal-rights activists will be the downfall of our society.

The film opens with a person in hospital waking to find that there is no one around. He wanders around an empty London before being attacked by some of the infected and then he is rescued by some other survivors. A radio message leads them to travel north to an Army facility and more problems emerge.
The strength of the film is its atmosphere and its characters. A large number of American films have characters who are sterotypical. Handsome heroes, stoic love interests played by models who are clearly around 19 years of age with big brests.
In this case the main characters are in no way Bruce Willis characters. The hero is a courier and one of the other main characters a taxi driver. The women are anything but shrinking violets. The main female lead in fact is tougher than any of the male characters.
The DVD is quite interesting. It has a number of alternate endings which reflect different approaches. The end chosen for the film is a happy ending. The alternate endings are somewhat bleaker. There are also a number of deleted scences in which there is commentary by the director. All of it is interesting and explains the process of film making in a practical way.

The portion of the film set in the military base does tend to let the plot unwind a little but there is enough of an undercurrent of madness to keep everything moving forward.

I think this is probably the most overrated film I have ever seen. It gets off to a pretty bad start in terms of plausability, expecting us to just accept that one lone man was left unscathed in a hospital while everyone around him was attacked and infected. I don't understand how it didn't occur to the writers that this is something that requires an explanation. It's also pretty boring. So many scenes are so unneccessarily long and drawn out when nothing is happening. The five minute musical montage of the guy walking through the deserted city. Ok, we get it, the city is deserted, move on, something happen. Even the twenty seconds showing the stuff stuck on the fridge at his home was infuriating. Show it for two seconds, move on, something happen. I'm sure some people would say those excessively drawn out scenes were important in setting a mood, but a lot of the early part of the film just left me bored and annoyed, wishing something would happen.
Although it was seemingly promoted as a ""zombie"" movie, nothing interesting happened with the zombies, and fighting the zombies was a minor background plot, with the focus being placed more on human drama. So you've got the boring underdeveloped zombie plot, and the boring underdeveloped human drama plot, both fighting for their right to bore you. Other than a couple of violent scenes, which really aren't as bad as some people seem to want to make them out to be, the film starts to take on an almost wholesome family viewing tone.
The obligatory romantic entanglement is introduced, and handled rather badly, falling into the trite hollywood conventions this movie is supposedly distanced from. The cringeworthy culmination of this being when the girl is all oh you killed my captor now let me make out with you.
The film is kind of separated into two parts, the second being after they enter the army base. The second part isn't as badly done as the first. It's just an ugly feel-bad thing, with the army guys proving to be more sinister badguys than the zombies. I don't find any major fault with the way that part of movie was executed, it was done well even, I guess, but it wasn't something I enjoyed watching or would have wanted to had I known what to expect. The editing does become a bit garbled towards the end though. There were a few parts when I was like who's this guy, who just shot at that guy, isn't that the other guy from before, why is he over there. It seemed like they did a really rushed editing job, and just took out random chunks of movie, leaving a fragmented narrative, where you have to fill in the dots way too much. I don't know what they were going for, because it is difficult to follow, and there's no reason it needed to be. And that's all I have to say about this travesty of a film. I hate it.

Why to make such a movie when you know that you won't make better anyway ? Romero made a masterpiece with Zombies longtime ago and nobody never challenged his work so far.

Energetic(at times frantic)camera work, appropriate lighting, music and sound, take away from the fact that we've seen all this before.

1541555,4,B00005JMA8,"Upon its intitial release in the UK, 28 Days Later met with mostly lukewarm reviews.  However, following good word-of-mouth I decided to give it a shot.  The story's simple enough: zombie plague leaves only a few survivors left in an empty and ravaged London; survivors head for a military post in Manchester in hope of safety.  Written by Alex Garland, directed by Danny Boyle, set in England, and with a cast of virtual unknowns, it didn't come across as your regular horror flick.
And to be fair it's not.  After de-railing slightly with A Life Less Ordinary and The Beach, Danny Boyle goes back to his roots, using low-res camera techniques and making possibly one of the most British horror movies in years.  After what a travesty The Beach was to the source novel, it's perhaps surprising that Alex Garland would still be talking to Boyle, but they're good friends enough to cook up this little number apparently.  There are clear signs of Garland's writing here, especially when the group reach the military post, with themes of society devouring itself being even more inherent here than they were in The Beach.  This will either be a plus or a minus point depending on your point of view.
Crucially, this does have a few scares up its sleeve though, and the beginning sequences involving an empty London are remarkably effective, as are the characters, who are each drawn believably and acted with a great deal of realism.  Whilst gore fans might be disappointed (it's pretty tame in comparison with many other horrors on the market at the moment), it's certainly a film you won't forget.  Original, quick-paced and interesting, with a fanastic soundtrack, Danny Boyle proves that maybe England is best for him.  Whilst not as tense as Shallow Grave or as important as Trainspotting, 28 Days Later is a quick in the teeth to the majority of horror movies out there.",1080777600,5,1874,4.809968847352025

The story line has some holes in it,but name me one movie that fits in this genre that doesn't have some kind of plot hole in it. I feel that this movie took over where Resident Evil left off (with the zombies on speed basically).

Borrowing liberally from Day of the Triffids, Night of the Comet [remember that one?] and Omega Man, this erstwhile zombie-ish flick takes place in England and surrounding parts.  When radical do-gooder animal rights activists release test monkeys full of `rage' potion they do more harm than good as usual.  The virus quickly infects everything and turns humans into slavering, red-eyed rage-a-holics.  The token survivor, a bicycle courier, wakes up in a hospital and wanders around the desolate London before things start getting better.  Chased by mobs of the infected he joins up with a few more survivors as they make their way to the requisite military stronghold.  Once there, of course, we see the soldiers have already started breaking down in Lord of the Flies fashion, and boy are they happy to have some chicks show up.  Cinematically impressive, with some gritty effects and angles it's a slightly above average entry into this genre which I'll revisit when the new Dawn of the Dead comes out.",1080432000,,1093,5.005524861878453
1541561,3,B00005JMA8,"i bought this dvd right after finishing alex garland's wonderful book 'the beach' and watching the dvd of the movie it was based on, hoping for another wonderful collaboration between the director danny boyle and garland who wrote the script for 28 days later. it is a nice zombie movie and incredibly well shot (needless to say the deserted london sequence is breathtaking) but then again not much separates this zombie film from the george romero ones or any other zombie flicks of recent times. the fact that the story is set in england and that the actors are mainly unknown does add a bit more panache, though personally i think the movie does have certain problems, most noteworthy for me is the incredibly silly exposition of how the virus causing the zombie epidemic spread into the wide world.
the dvd is full of underwhelming features including a commentary track by boyle and garland who sound kind of tedious after a while (maybe it's those british accents), the alternate endings are nice but silly and only go to show yet another problem in the screenwriting process of an unperfect script, the featurette is incredibly stupid, sort of like a british 60-minutes segment about how a zombie epidemic is inevitable, the music video is horrible and the storyboards dull.
nevertheless there are good reasons to get this movie, most notably the wonderful soundtrack and score (though you can probably get that separately) and from a purely educational point of view, to see the film and then the deleted scenes (especially the alternate endings, which are not 'killer' endings as stated on the cover) to see how this movie could have been a lot worse.",1080432000,,1659,4.865724381625442
1541562,3,B00005JMA8,"I was hoping for a lot from this Movie, Danny Boyle is behind a few gems, Trainspotting and Shallow Grave are classics.  But like so many directors, he fell flat once gaining acceptance in the mainstream USA audience, big budgets hindering him more than anything.  This movie wasn't as good as I had hoped, but it was still entertaining and fun to watch.
Most interesting is the beginning before you know what is really happening, some people get infected, a scientist freaks out about it, and the opening credits roll.  Then you are brought to the main character, who has been in a coma from a bicycle crash.  He wakes up in an empty hospital, and walks out into a seeminly deserted london.  When he discovers that a plague has decimated or changed most of the town.
One thing to note, this isn't as much a zombie movie as it was hyped up to be.  The infected weren't dead, they got the disease and became like rabid animals.  Second, you don't see them as much as you would expect.  This is nice since it keeps them fresh and you don't see a lot of them till later in the movie.  They are also really fast, appearing sometimes out of nowhere and charging like mad for those who haven't been infected.
This is more like the earlier Romereo flicks, more about how people react to the desolation of their society and danger of their surroundings; the hardened survivalist that will kill you without blinking if you show signs of infection, the kind father who wants to get his daughter to safety and seems to be almost unaffected by events around him, or the degenerated soldiers.
It could have been better, but I think that it was better than a lot of horror movies of late, and hope for future movies from Danny Boyle.  Hopefully a sign that he will return to the former caliber of his early films.",1080259200,,1799,4.474006116207951
1541563,3,B00005JMA8,"When I first saw the previews for this movie, I actually thought it was going to be the new movie adaptation of Richard Matheson's ""I Am Legend"".  I think that was the unofficial intention of the film, as it closely resembles the storyline (One man existing in an extinct world where all living inhabitants have been transformed into bloodthirsty monsters).  I am a huge fan of zombie flicks, so I was thrilled to hear that there was finally a new one coming out.  But upon seeing the film I was both satisfied and disappointed.
First off, the storyline is awesome, but this is certainly not a horror movie.  28 Days Later is definetly Drama (which is not necessarily a bad thing if you're a horror fan).  Horror movies co-exist with the theme of humor and have a lot of fun, which is why many horror movies are so cheasy and corny.  This movie had little relief from its miserable atmosphere, one of its down points in my opinion.  Now, I know horror fans (myself included) are always begging for more and more zombie movies despite the fact that they're all the same, but this movie definetly lacked in originality (again, maybe not such a bad thing).  Just about every frame of the film was taken from another movie.  Fans of the Romero trilogy will recognize several scenes as tributes to his zombie films.
The films biggest innovation was its style of zombies, which were truly original.  Classic zombies were slow moving with no intelligence, and well... dead.  The infections spread slowly and gave people a chance to at least say good bye.  These zombies are quick and intelligent, and very much alive.(The more ""believable"" approach also taken in ""The Omega Man"").  An infected person is gone within seconds, giving no time for people to get a safe distance away, let alone listen to their last requests.  And shame on you if you say they aren't zombies.  No one ever sat down and said ""Okay, this is what zombies have to be"".  Just because George Romero took a different approach on what zombies traditionally were doesn't mean everyone else has to copy off of him.  In fact, since 28 Days Later, all zombie movies feature ""running zombies"", including the remake of Romero's classic ""Dawn of the Dead"".  Some of the infection scenes of the film were truly disturbing and scary, which was one of the things I loved about the film.  But I beleive this is where the good stuff ends.
The rest of the movies is a bunch of mumbling in british accents, you can't tell what in God's name people are saying half the movie (no offense meant to the British).  And I honestly don't think an infection so fast would ever be able to make it overseas.  I mean, once by accident, okay, but to seven continents?  I mean, if someone wanted to transport the infection, they'de have to round up a bunch of zombies into a plane, fly them without getting killed, and drop them off in another country.  And another thing, the zombies find it necessary to hide during the day?  (This is where the film was an obvious rip off of ""I Am Legend"")  A man runs around the streets for hours during the day screaming for help with no response, and at nightfall a hundred zombies all of a sudden appear?  The movie also spent a bit too much time on moral humanitary issues and not enough on fiction, spoiling the science fiction effect.  And one last thing, maybe they shouldn't have wasted such a good story in a place where guns are illegal.",1080172800,2,3420,4.563934426229508
1541564,4,B00005JMA8,"this movie was the real thing as far as horror movies go.  i say this because through out the whole i literally had a knot in my stomach the whole time i was watching.  i cannot recall a movie that has done that to me.  there is a part of me that knows that something like this ever happening is not very likely, however i would not rule it totally out of the question, and that is what is really scary about the movie.  i can only imagine waking up and finding the whole world has literally gone mad.  this is the story of true survival and testing the limits of human endurance.  the whole movie is full of heartbreaking moments and to me that added a real element of humanity to the story, especially with regards to the father and daughter aspect of the movie.  and also in the movie once you think that the main characters have found salvation it turns out that their salvation  comes at the hands of another type of madness, something similar to cabin fever.  i am referring to the army that have created a stronghold, and believe that rape is the only way for the human race to survive.  in the end they all get what they deserve.  i did like the hopeful ending with all the main characters making it out alive, and eventually being rescued. i do have to say that the director did an excellent job in creating an atmosphere.  the whole movie is very dark and very creepy, i really did not know where the next rage zombie was going to come from.  the tunnel scene was especially suspenseful to me.  there is much to be taken away from this movie, and to me the most important thing is to realize that people need each other.  no matter how tough you are on your own, everything can be made better if you are not by yourself.",1080172800,,1730,4.247706422018348

1541623,5,B00005JMA8,"First of all I must say that Danny Boyle's directing in this film is really good.  I want to clear up the myths about this film.  This is not a zombie horror flick.  While it does have horror elements, it is a more realistic view on what would be the whole zombie genre.  Zombies are the living dead.  This movie is about infection.  A virus has spread throughout Britain as a result of animal testing.  And most of the population has been infected.  This movie has a very political message to it.  The basic storyline is set 28 days after the initial infection outbreak.  It shows the remnants of the chaos that was created by showing empty silent streets.  This movie is about a whole country that is virtually whiped out because of their own government trying to be powerful, and as a result becoming powerless.  It is about total chaos and survival.  This has to be one of the top films of 2003.  While the whole idea of being infected by rage might seem a little unrealistic, the very essence of the story is almost too realistic.  And that is disease and infection spreading.  This story is real, because it can in fact happen.  The devesteting effects on a country as a result of a fast killing disease or virus outbreak would be similar to what you will be watching in this film.  So those who were dissapointed because it wasn't ""scary enough"".  Well when you watch it for what it is, it is down right horrifying.",1079913600,2,1422,4.441860465116279
1541624,5,B00005JMA8,"28 Days Later is a really good zombie flick.
[...]
Despite all those distractions, I STILL thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It combines elements of Night of the Living Dead, but it does them better. Like in the remake of Night of the Living Dead, the director makes a statement about mn killing man -- is it okay to have fun shooting people when they're zombies?
They're not really zombies, of course. They're victims of a disease called ""Rage"" that turns you into a murderous killing machine. These are still people though -- they can be shot, set on fire, and starved to death.
Cool Device #1: Main character wakes up from a coma. We're as clueless as he is.
Cool Device #2: It takes place in deserted London. It's a plague that spreads fast. I imagine it spread to all of England, actually. Sort of like Vanilla Sky in NYC. It's probably not even as creepy for Americans, as we don't live or visit there very often.
Cool Device #3: Rage can be transmitted by any bodily fluid exchange, blood being the most likely.
Cool Device #4: Rage takes 20 seconds to take effect. Whenever you think a character gets infected, you subconsciously being counting to 20. This keeps the audience perpetually on edge.
Eventually, the protagonist and his companions find a military base and we expect the movie to end. Only the message here is that being with the military (the supposed savior of the people) is actually WORSE than being with the zombies.
This movie was done before, and the parallels between the two are quite amazing. The movie: Resident Evil! Of all things, Resident Evil -- a true-blue zombie flick -- didn't pull off horror nearly as well as 28 Days Later. But they have the same elements:
28 Days Later/Resident Evil
Protagonist wakes up in hospital with no idea what happened/Protagonist wakes up in a deserted house with no idea what happened
Movie begins with protagonist in a completely deserted city (London)/Movie ends with protagonist in a completely deserted city (Raccoon City)
Movie begins with protagonist naked in hospital/Movie ends with protagonist naked in hospital
Zombies get shot by a military agency (UK military) sent to eliminate them /Zombies get shot by a military agency (Umbrella, if I remember correctly) to eliminate them
Zombie disease spread by infection (20 seconds)/Zombie disease spread by infection (uh, more than 20 seconds)
Two females end up running around in red dresses/Female protagonist runs around entire movie in red dress (thank you Mila!)
So what did 28 Days Later do right as a horror movie? Well, it's a horror movie for one. To clarify, it focuses on horror. Zombies are scary enough, but they alone do not a good horror flick make. There needs to be more. And the director (the same one who made Trainspotting) has no problems going ""there.""
""There"" is watching a father figure turn into a zombie and being forced to kill him. ""There"" is bashing a zombie child's head in with a bat. ""There"" is being attacked by a priest who's a zombie. ""There"" is having one of your friends turn zombie and -- instead of the old, ""I refuse to kill my friend"" -- brutally hacking him to bits.
28 Days Later succeeds because it ignores horror conventions. There is none of the angst associated with a person turning into a zombie. Hell, even Night of the Creeps had that. No, 28 Days Later succeeds because the director isn't a horror filmmaker. He knows that collapse of basic human decency is what's horrifying, not zombies.
Don't get me wrong, Resident Evil kicks ass. But it's a science fiction action movie. This is real horror, the way it was meant to be made. See it, you won't be sorry.",1079913600,,3630,4.7271293375394325

I really liked the scene that the Ave Maria was playing over 'cause that's good music, but the move never really takes off.
There's a bit where a bunch of CGI rats come running through and I'm thinking, cor! It's finally beginning.  But no, not really.
If you look at some classic zombie films, like Dawn of the Dead or Day of the Dead, there are zombies who stand out.  A hare Christina, Bub, the clown.  And topping the bland zombies is an even blander cast of humans.
Even the worst Italian low budget zombie films, like Zombie 3 & 4 are more entertaining.

1541626,5,B00005JMA8,"I think that why this movie was such a disappointment for most people was due to the fact that they were expecting a horror flick. While 28 Days Later certainly has its scary moments (the zombie suddenly jumping through the window at Cillian Murphy while in his home), I'd say it leans more on drama. The sociological issues raised in this movie, such as sex as survival in a ruined world, are extremely profound.
  Aside from this, the casting was immensely superb, with absolutely dazzling performances from Cillian Murphy and Naomie Harris, and the cinematography was nothing short of spectacular, especially the cottage scenes in the country.
  By the way, the writing is wholly unique. One of the most moving sequences of the movie, Murphy's murderous bloodbath near the end of the movie, forces the viewer to question morality in a world gone dead.
  However, the killer of this film is the fact that people looking for a thought-provoking flick look at this movie as a zombie-horror creepshow, while the thrill-seeking punks look at it as too boring or slow.

There are no nurses, no doctors, no janitors, no other patients, nothing.  There is only the deafening silence.  He manages to wander down into the streets of London, where he finds absolutely no one.  Finally, after stepping into a church, he finds a mass of bodies all together - and also manages to find a zombie-like priest who seems possessed.  Jim only manages to escape the zombies with the help of two strangers, Mark and Selena, who quickly fill him in on what has happened in the past 28 days - a virus has spread throughout England, causing ""the infected"" (the zombie creatures) to attack anyone who is not infected.  The virus has spread so rapidly that nearly all of England has been either infected or killed.  Families no longer exist, there is no government, there is no army, there is nothing but a struggle for the non-infected to make it through one more day.  Jim and Selena team up with a father and daughter in search of a group of soldiers who promise salvation from the infection - but once they reach the blockade, one has to wonder just who the monsters are.
I really liked this movie.  The first part of the movie with Jim discovering the vast quietness that has enveloped London is particularly great - there is virtually no sound at all, and you almost feel like you are wandering the deserted streets with him.  I did wonder, however, how Jim managed to survive for so long in a hospital with no one to care for him.  I don't know how long he was in the hospital, but in the coma-like state he was in, surely he would have died within a few days with no assistance, if merely from lack of water.
I also had a few more questions about the movie...surely the zombies would have died within 28 days.  They only ate the non-infected, they never seemed to drink anything, surely even zombies need water?  I also wondered why the infected didn't turn against one another, but only attacked the non-infected.  Maybe it had something to do with the disease, I don't know.  Anyway, just because I had a few questions about the movie, the experience wasn't ruined for me!  :)
The movie really made you think, because in just 28 days ""civilization"" itself had pretty much disappeared.  The soldiers who weren't infected were pretty much becoming animals themselves.  There was no respect for others, no qualms about killing innocent people, etc.  I really don't know if that is realistic or not, as thankfully I have never been put into such a dire circumstance, but I imagine that it could conceivably happen as the movie portrayed it.  That is the scariest part in my opinion - humankind turning against humankind, and destroying itself in the process.
I didn't particularly like the ending, but the alternate theatrical ending (included on the DVD) was much better.  There are three endings in total included on the DVD, so if you don't like one, you can always pick another!  :)  Altogether, I believe this movie is a definite plus to any DVD collection.",1078617600,4,3083,4.637200736648251

A virus is released, and if anyone knows anything about history, viruses spread fast!  Think of SARS-or the Plague (the Black Death)!
The story is a microcosm of a much larger disaster.  The virus is released-ironically by animal rights activities.  The virus causes massive and violent homicidal behavior in the infected.  Release one infected person on an unsuspecting population in an hour there will be say 10 infected then 100 and then a thousand!  And that's only a passage of THREE hours!
The Zombies don't need much motivation, and zombies (in any of the genre films) generally, never ""see"" each other as a threat.

1541695,1,B00005JMA8,"""28 Days Later"" is basically a rehash of a number of George Romero horror films. The one most often cited is ""Night of the Living Dead"" but in fact ""28 Days Later"" borrows most liberally from a lesser known Romero movie called ""The Crazies"".
It's directed by Danny Boyle who seems to get a lot of free passes from critics who should know better. His first film: ""Shallow Grave"" was OK if a bit too determined to be hip. ""Trainspotting"" was better, but again - I thought - too desperate to attain cool hip status. And then there were ""The Beach"" and ""A Life Less Ordinary"", both of which were pretty dismal
""28 Days Later"" again has garnered a lot of positive reviews, but for me this update of the zombie movie doesn't really have much new going for it at all, except that it's shot on a prosumer DV camera, the Canon XL1
After a brief segment of violent news footage, the movie begins with a group of animal rights activists freeing caged chimps infected with a virus that causes unreasoning rage. The chimps infect the humans, and 28 Days later a cycle courier Jim (Cillian Murphy) awakens from a coma in a deserted hospital. He wanders around a deserted London until he encounters not only infected and murderous individuals but also Selena (Naomie Harris) and Mark (Noah Huntley).  Mark doesn't survive long, but Selena and Jim meet up with a father and daughter Frank (Brendan Gleeson) and Hannah (Megan Burns). They group decides to strike out for Manchester, where several soldiers, led by Major Henry West (Christopher Eccleston), have invited any survivors to join them at their blockade. When they get there though they discover that while the soldiers might provide some protection from crazed zombie-like infected they have their own less pleasant agenda.
The script's by Alex Garland, the writer of ""The Beach"". It doesn't bother to make much sense, and often descends into clich. It tells us the infected are full of mindless rage, but never explains why they don't turn on each other, just on the uninfected. Or how they get organized enough to launch a mass attack.
The soldiers in the movie are apparently desperate for women, but they've only been locked up for the eponymous 28 days. And the movie automatically assumes that being attacked and eaten by enraged crazies is somehow a preferable fate for its two women than the ""fate worse than death"" the soldiers have in mind to rebuild humanity. The acting, particularly from Naomie Harris  is pretty dire, and somehow that's made even more apparent by the grungy video footage. The best scenes are the scenes of a deserted London, but I remember seeing something very similar in an old Hammer film ""Daleks Invasion Earth 2015"". This is one of those movies, like ""The Blair Witch Project"" where the hype seems to have overcome the actual qualities or lack of them. For me, it wasn't even big on horror. Personally, for thrills I'd rather watch ""Night of the Living Dead"" or ""Dawn of the Dead"" again. Don't expect too much.",1077926400,3,2991,4.7389635316698655

It's more of a movie that grabs you and then makes your gut wrench watching everything that is going on and the thought of the world being destroyed.  It doesn't really shock you and make you jump.

1541746,5,B00005JMA8,"Wow! I'm a little surprise with the negative reviews here. Myself and those I talked to thought it was a great film. One of the best of last year even.
I didn't notice the product placement, but then again it doesn't bother me too much. I'm not from the UK so maybe that's the ticket;)
I felt tense all through the film but there were segments where the camera shots allowed a little relief. The audience starts to get comfortable and BAMN in come infected humans! It was a great juxtaposition I thought. The camera was used well. In one scene a man is infected by getting a drop of blood in his eye and the use of the camera as the drop tragically dive-bombs tenses the audience once again, as we wait for what's to come.
It wasn't exclusively a zombie film (if anything I'd call it 'psuedo-zombie') but it definately commented on human nature, like that in ""Night Of the Living Dead"". Since previous zombie films have focused more on the evil of humans than the evil of zombies I thought it made perfect sense for this film to follow that lore with the whole 'world's gonna end' thing. It's a fair call that humans are self-destructive.
There weren't any dull moments in the film. I found myself interested in the characters enough to hear them out when there were the few talking scenes that were shown but the film was so fast paced I didn't feel bored or anything. Because the film is in movements I think it remains enjoyable. We have a man by himself, then he finds others, then they seek refuge...
Sometimes horror films make the mistake of keeping the film set in one place with one simple storyline for the entire film. I felt that this film allowed for some changes and exploration, while retaining its main themes of evil humans etc.
Unlike a lot of end-of-the-world films or horror films this is one that can be read-into. You can analyse the fact that the lead character 'evolves' physically and emotionally throughout the film, and you can analyse the church scene etc.
I thought the setting was great. For once the end of the world stuff wasn't filmed in the US. Without the lame patriarchy and with the more naturalistic settings this film was a relief to watch.
One warning, though, for those who feel icky easily there's projectile vomitting of blood so if you can't handle the dirtyness close your eyes.
I couldn't be happier with this film's release. It's something different on the market, but also stretches its roots to past horror films. I don't think I've seen a more original film that tackles the end of the world idea.
I'm going to add that the film was heaps underrated here in Australia (most people never heard of it) and I had no expectations of what the film would be like. I saw a poster and a friend told me it was an end of the world film where people got infected with rage. I didn't see any trailers and felt pretty confronted at the messy start. It was confusing but was meant to be so I got on board pretty quick on what kind of film I'd be watching, thanks to the intro.",1077148800,2,3012,4.448462929475587
1541747,1,B00005JMA8,"I just rented this movie because I remembered reviews saying that it was really scary and I LOVE scary movies.  Let me tell you, there is NOTHING scary about this movie.  I think there was one part when I jumped but that was simply from shock not because I was scared.  Everything about this movie was predictable and silly.  I knew who would die before they did, I pretty much knew the ending before it came.  When it was over, i said to myself ""I want the last hour and half of my life back.""  It was pretty bad.  So bad that I had to come down here and see how others were rating it.  I was shocked to see the number of good reviews.  Perplexing!!! Well, to each their own, but I would have to caution anyone who is thinking of getting this vid.  It will be time poorly spent.  Just my .02.",1077062400,3,793,4.084415584415584
1541748,4,B00005JMA8,"but it is still a very good movie. Obviously the moviemakers had a hard time trying to find a good way to market this film, but they just chose the easiest way. There are enough horror elements to trick people into thinking it was a horror movie with the trailers and all, but people shouldn't judge the whole movie on that!
Instead, we get an atmospheric movie with a few jumps and enough well-done acting and character development to keep people watching. The beginning of the movie (after the little intro with the stupid activists) has a very secluded and lonely feel to it. There are several minutes of silence with a slight jump with the car alarm. Then there is the feel of danger, insecurity, and weakness after Jim gets rescued when the infected could come at them at any time. And then there are the stupid soldiers.....
This movie triumphs with the atmosphere and they give plenty of time to develop the four characters you follow and their relationship with one another. I actually cared for all of them.
But why the four stars? Some parts do seem to drag and I was expecting more scares, but there wasn't. Why didn't anything happen when Jim and company were all resting in the open country? There could have definitely been something exciting like infected attacking while they were asleep or something like that. Also, it does feel kind of strange that the soldiers they meet up with all (but one) become rapists and immoral killers in only a month.
Despite those downfalls, the movie was still great in its originality, atmosphere, and character development.

1541751,4,B00005JMA8,"A lot of people felt disappointed after seeing ""28 Days Later"". The main reasons why that happened are:
A).- The film was publicized as ""One of the best horror films in recent history"". And ""28 Days Later"" is not a horror movie, actually is a psychological thriller with post-apocalyptic atmosphere.
B).- The pace of the movie is rather slow, and probably a lot of people expected a frantic pace in this movie, something in the line of ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" or ""Child's Play"". Once again, the wrong promotion might be responsible of this.

The highlights in ""28 Days Later"" are the use of dark atmospheres. The concept of human extermination is very interesting, even though is nothing new. The music used in the movie is very good, the use of guitars creates a progressive rock soundtrack in a lot of the tracks.
At the end of the day, ""28 Days Later"" is a very good movie, is not a classic, but neither is a bad movie, as some might say due to the misguided expectations created for wrong publicity from the studio. Once again, ""28 Days Later"" is not a horror movie, is a thriller, therefore the movie has a slow pace, proper of a thriller.",1076284800,5,1148,4.519230769230769
1541752,3,B00005JMA8,"""28 Days Later"" would be a much better movie if the film makers had known what story they wanted to tell.  As it is, they start with a high-concept apocalyptic plague premise that degenerates into a slap-dash, jumbled action movie. I suppose Danny Boyle and screenwriter are trying to make the idea of people being infected with rage relevant to our current troubled world state (the film begins with an image of multiple T.V. monitors each showing news footage of one violent action or another), but I think they are much more taken with the idea of making a gross-out movie that will appeal to the alternative grunge crowd, not realizing that grunge is now cliche.  What is supposed to feel cutting edge feels stale and like something you've seen done before and done better.
The movie gets kudos from me for its visual look, and I do admit that it's never boring, but there's a general feeling of senseless nastiness that negates any message you're going to get from this.

I was sad to see that one of the reviewers spent the movie focused on the commercial items in it.  Not only did I find the product placement to be a highly irrelevant criterium upon which to denounce this film, but I thought junk food played its role well, adding more than a little irony to the apocalypticism.  In the end, we will die or become undead, but soda lives for ever.  Also, I thought the placement of a few commercial items was a small price to pay for this independent film.  Had its initial production been backed by a large studio, we could have said goodbye to the Valium and name-brand English chocolates but we would have most likely also had to live without the gorgeous cinematography, pictorial narrative style, brief male nudity, wonderful soundtrack, imagination, and suspense.

1541754,5,B00005JMA8,"This is one of the most gripping films I have seen in a long time.  No, it is not a mega-special-effects blockbuster like Armageddon, but a much more realistic story.
Animal rights activists ultimately destroy England when they release infected chimpanzees.  They are infected with Rage, an illness which drives the infected into a murderous rage when encountering someone not infected.
Jim wakes up in a hospital ala Day of the Triffids.  He wanders an empty London trying to figure out if he is hallucinating or not.  The Empty London and contact with a pair of other survivors shows shades of The Quiet Earth.
Soon reality sets in for Jim as he and his companions in survival search for others.  They eventually wind up at a country estate fortified in a manner similar to The Omega Man.
The story explores some interesting concepts including the key issue of what do you offer people when all hope is lost so that suicide is not a viable answer.  How can hope be resurrected?
The changes Jim goes through are very well done.  He starts confused and dazed, moves to mild acceptance, continues to belief and ultimately becomes a resourceful survivor.
The DVD contains a number of deleted scenes, the original ending (which I liked), another alternate ending and an extremely alternate ending where the second half of the film follows a completely different path.
This is not a teen horror film like Scream or Halloween, but one that relies more on fear and atmosphere like the original The Haunting.  Excellent.",1075852800,3,1513,4.837209302325581

Three ""intruders"" at the beginning of the movie, want to take the chimps but things get out of hand and the female in the group is bitten and she turns into the ""infected"".  The Infection is spread.  EXPOSER, INFECTION, EPIDEMIC, EVACUATION, and on Day 20 came, DEVASTATION.  Only ONE survived.  28 days later a guy by the name of Jim woke up in a hospital.

28 Days is rather gory and is for a real horror fan, so if you think you're up to it then by all means see it. It is worth it and will keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time. It's got everything: drama (of course), a love story, horror, etc.

(Each act of the film partially correlates with one of George Romero's trilogy, including the somewhat weak finale.)
Why is it still worthy of five stars then?  Two reasons.  First is because of the brilliant use of digital video in a theatrically released movie. Boyle does an excellent job of playing up the strengths of video, and using interesting compositions and editing to dance around its weaknesses.  He even takes advantage of the quick setup time video affords to create the soon to be iconic abandoned London sequence.  (I'd like to see the budget of that scene compared to Vanilla Sky's abandoned New York.)
The second reason this movie gets such high marks is, for fans of the genre at least, it manages to hit more high marks than any zombie film since Dawn of the Dead, including Dawn's Sequel.

If the whole movie from say, the exodus from London on were deleted, I would've been satisfied. Danny Boyles had excellent vision with 28 days later.. The camera angles are simply brilliant. The introduction of the zombies is brilliant. The setting in london is incredible to watch.  Unfortunately, Danny and Alex Garland focus on presenting Jim's transformation to brutal enforcer of humanity instead of exploring the full potential of what the circumstances provide for the characters.  The soldiers were plain stupid. For being the ones to survive the carnage of the virus outbreak, these guys would be about as tough a bunch of soldiers as you could get.  Instead Boyles makes them some rapist buffoons who Jim has no problem finishing off when he goes into pyscho mode. Its too bad the 2nd half of the movie occured. 28 days later would've been much better if they tried something different I believe.

1541821,3,B00005JMA8,"I gave this one 2 stars for the theatrical release. I give it 3 stars for the DVD release but definitely this is a TV quality movie and that is probably where it will play best - after the Ten o'clock news on Friday evening. It was even shot on video (Canon XL1S).
The makers of Trainspotting have brought us a Zombie movie, only it is not a zombie movie, but it still is. The zombies here have been replaced by the infected, but for all intensive purposes they are still zombies... except they run. The premise is simple. Monkey experiments cause an infection to spread across Britain turning people rapid. Survivors try to make it to civilization. Cue lots of set pieces involving who is going to make it and who is not. The producers of this film often have posters for ""The National Lottery"" in various scenes as a movie in-joke gimmik.
28 Days Later has appeal in the realm of independent movie productions but certainly does not surpass the offerings of Romero or even Fulci for that matter. It has a social and psychological element that may move this into the category of intelligent horror, but at the same time the IQ drops a few points in various scenes. For example:
- Why are the army so crazed to rape women only 28 Days after the holocaust? (US soldiers in Iraq will probably laugh their heads off)
- Why do characters still walk into ""traps""? (You know - when a character goes for a walk on their own or drive into a dark place.)
- Why hasn't the world done something about it? (Very plausible when you think about the ending.)
So some intelligence points granted - others subtract from this. Overall there is a good representation of England turned deserted except for zombies that ""run"" amok, some very violent scenes and a few interesting parallels between mankind and the zombies. Essentially it is a film of two halves. The first half takes place in London as survivors meet up, get killed and try to make their way to safety. The second half of the film takes place in a Military compound in Manchester. The film borrows heavily from - Day of the Triffids; man wakes up from a coma to find the world desolate, Day of the Dead; Army try to protect the survivors only to turn on them and they have an ex-soldier turned zombie to experiment on, The Stand; the scene in the tunnel is from that book. So 28 Days Later is not exactly the most original Zombie horror flick in the world, but the originality is in the direction of being more art-house than mainstream and for that it does look better than most but is still a no-brainer in the guts.
I'd watch it though for the video look (Canon XL1S) that is done quite well considering you can buy this camera on Amazon for $3,529.88. Independent filmmakers will enjoy that and heck so might you.",1075075200,,2762,4.471287128712872

I'm a huge horror movie buff, and I was growing tired of inane, slasher, pop-out ""Boo!"" bores that are being released so rapidly and being labeled as ""horror"" films.  So I figured this film would finally be just what I needed to scare the hell out of me and keep me awake at night...
...I've had no problems sleeping since the minute the film ended.
I thought this was going to be a movie that created its fear through subtle imagery; use the whole idea that what you DON'T see is what's scary.
I was wrong.  The first ten or so minutes of the movie are the scariest, I think, as it shows an entire city in desolation.  The imagery is eerie and convincing and mildly disturbing...but it just goes downhill from there and becomes another carbon copy of everything we've seen before.
The dialogue doesn't help any either.  From the very start of the film, I found myself thinking, ""Wow...this is cheesy!""
The only ""new level"" this movie rises to in terms of zombie horror is that now the zombies can run instead of just walking around aimlessly.  But that's nowhere near enough to make them scary...
And the pace of the movie is utterly slow.  One would think this would add to the suspense and tension, but it only bogs it down because you begin to realize haflway through the film that nothing is going to happen.

1541875,3,B00005JMA8,"28 days later is defnately worth viewing.  Unfortunately, the plot is severely flawed.  Firstly, some good points.  The post-apocolyptic , panaramic scenes of central london are fantastic, almost like a character initself.  This might have something to do with the fact that ive lived in London for 22 years and seeing it as such was quite disturbing.  The concept that Danny Boyle is trying to put across has been the subject of much debate on this site, however, I found it quite meaningful [in places].  The plot has resonances of a Hobbesian/Darwinian animalistic state of nature where mankind is set against itself.
What is interesting is how all the brand names have outlasted society (witness the billboard adverts, the soft drink discussion on the staicase, the lottery tickets and choclates etc), moreover how mankind's creations outlive mankind.  Also, the scene where the taxi driver gets infected is heart rendering.  The moment when he tells his daughter (sorry, im terrible at remembering names) that he loves her just as the rage sets in was chilling.
Unfortunately, it is hard to take this film seriously at times.
The tire changing scene was technically impossible, you'd be in the guiness book of records if u did it in that time.
The discussion about the soft drinks is quite frankly absurd; the whole country is consumed with zombies and you're worried about whether its lilt or tango or pepsi or whatever.
Why the taxi driver and the daughter send out bright signals from their appartment is beyond me.  Surely thats just asking for it.
While the idea with the army was a nice twist it is somewhat unlikely within such a time scale.  Self consumed rapists with 2 years, yes possibly.  but after 2 weeks, surely not.
If the soft drink discussion was absurd, the picnic scene is beyond description.  I mean come on who do they thnk they're kidding.  And the scene with the horses where everyone just stops and sentimentalises was pathetic and insulting.
Characterization is immensely poor.  The're dialogue in particular is dreadful.  It severely detracts from the films overall impact.
Also, surely the most productive idea would be to get a rowing boat and sail to somewhere off shore??  Just find a copy of the yellow pages....  You'll be munching on camamberre within a week.
Having said that, almost every film or peice of work has its own flaws.  And 28 days later is no different.  Overlook these and you're in for an okay movie.

1541876,4,B00005JMA8,"A blasted monkey undergoing biological enhancement testing was the source of deterioration. ""28 Days Later"" may be mistaken as a zombie film, but it's more about the social commentary of learned violence. In my opinion, survival of the fittest was developed early during human evolution as the lonely survivors (Cillian Murphy and Naomie Harris) killed the plagued victims of RAGE and they had to build a new trust. Overall, the movie is creepy especially when Jim woke up from his coma to a deserted London and when he discovered bodies in the church. It's a great movie up to the point where Jim and his friends stumbled upon the military base to be saved. Even the military had become savages and had vile intentions for the women. Violence comes from humans as society is the order of their compulsions. Everything falls apart and the heroes are left stranded once again in seclusion from the world and the feeling of despair never enters their minds. This isn't a scary movie like the original ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" or one of those diabolical slashers, but it's a good movie with a surprising, meaningful message. If you're looking for watermelons or cherries falling out of people's necks or swarms of monsters chasing people all over the place, this isn't your movie. People will be disappointed. The moments of silence in the movie are really the most frightening. Then I realized that I actually live in the mountains and I became afraid of where I'm living. What if a bunch of insane monsters with bad breath and a crazed look in their eyes came running toward my house and crashed through my house just to spit on me? Then I wanted to hide my food. Wow, that's scary man. ""28 Days Later"" is a good movie.",1074643200,,1719,4.714285714285714

I wonder how much of the actual movie wound up on the chopping block.  ONe of my acquaintances, David Schow wrote the screenplay for a movie called Leatherface which got cut to shreds on the preproduction floor so I realize how that can happen.

1541878,3,B00005JMA8,"Before watching ""28 days later"", everybody told me it was a different movie, much more than the usual horror/vampire/monster/zombie movies already existent. They told me the plot was good, the acting was good, the movie had a cynic social commentary, the direction was different, etc.
So, I put the disc in my DVD player and waiting for something different to happen. When I watched the time display, it was almost 60 minutes into the movie, and I had not seen anything that different, and certainly no social commentary. Then I began suspecting something was wrong.
OK, ""28 days later"" is an above average ZOMBIE MOVIE. It's much better, for an example, than that heinous John Carpenter thing about vampires. But it's still a zombie movie. Social commentary? I couldn't find any. Really, if you have noticed something social about this movie, tell me, please. What is it? That society binds humankind togheter? That man is fundamentally isolacionist and evil? Sincerely, these debates have gone on for more than 4000 years, and answers vary 180 degrees. What's more, Alex Garland, the writer of the screenplay, had already toyed with the notion of ""rebuilding humanity from a small nucleus"" in his previous work - ""The beach"" a so-so movie (also directed by Danny Boyle) but a great book - and in that story I already though the beach community was ridiculous. To try to find a different answer to the problems of humankind in a zombie movie is too much.
""28 days later"" has thousands of plot-holes (all listed on previous reviews) and idiotic situations; the dialogue... ridiculous; the characters... I don't remember their names, and that thing with the army, that's totally unbelieving. The good thing about this movie is really Boyle's direction, frantyc, scary, full of movement and very thrilling. Excellent for a ZOMBIE MOVIE.
If you take this movie seriously, it deserves one star. It is not revolutionary, not different, not with a social commentary (sigh), and certainly has many problems. It is a ZOMBIE MOVIE and, as such, it deserves 3 stars, the top-most rating a ZOMBIE MOVIE should get.

1541879,3,B00005JMA8,"A virus that causes its victims to fly into a murderous rage is released in London.  The country is devastated and a small band of uninfected survivors is left to struggle for their lives.  This film is most effective early on, but problems with the story swiftly accumulate to rob it of its power.  The cast is very good and scenes of star Cillan Murphy wandering through a deserted London and piecing together the truth from available evidence are very effective.  I was enjoying the movie a great deal at this point, but then the problems kept mounting.
Where were all the corpses?  How did a virus that claims its victim within seconds manage to spread throughout the whole country at all, much less within a month?  If the infected are so irrationally angry, why do they run in packs without attacking each other?  The last act of the film has our heroes seeking refuge with a group of soldiers who have descended to the level of murderous rapists.  Director Danny Boyle and screenwriter Alex Garland may have some interesting ideas about the fragility of our social contract but, I'm sorry, 28 days is just not enough time for people to sink that far.  If their point is that the military mindset is particularly susceptible to this avenue of degradation, then their viewpoint is not just overly pessimistic, it's downright offensive.  It's not an interesting choice dramatically, either.  The film's climax is just a lot of running and shooting in which the zombies are entirely beside the point.  Besides, George Romero did the whole embattled-military-outpost-coming-apart-at-the-seams-while-under-siege-by-zombies thing much more believably and effectively about twenty years ago in ""Day of the Dead.""",1074470400,24,1711,5.071428571428571
1541880,5,B00005JMA8,"What if you woke up from a coma to discover you were the last man alive?  And what if you then realized you weren't alone, but instead were surrounded by zombified, blood-spewing plague victims and the last scattered remnants of the uninfected?  That's exactly the situation faced by Jim (Cillian Murphy), a young English bike messenger, in Danny Boyle's ""28 Days Later.""  A horror movie for people who don't like horror movies, it's a genre-busting exercise that adds to its scares with an actual plot, plenty of suspense, a bit of drama, and even a few moments of mordant humor.
For the first fifteen minutes or so, the movie is a powerhouse.  The opening scene, where a monkey bite spreads the infection (aka ""rage"") to a group of unwitting animal-rights types, is frenetic and frightening in the extreme, augmented by director Danny Boyle's innovative camera work.  In contrast, the next scene is plenty horrifying, but in a vastly different way.  When we see protagonist Jim wake up from a coma in his hospital room and wander the streets of London looking for all the people, the desolation of the city is perfectly captured by some stunning cinematography, and augmented by the tense, sweeping music of Godspeed You! Black Emperor (shameless plug: check 'em out if you haven't already).  The horror here comes from the vastness of the abandoned landscape and the bewilderment in Jim's face as his predicament gradually dawns on him, and only escalates when he finds a pile of corpses in a church in what is surely among the most eerie sights ever put to film.
Of course, all that changes when the infected come on the scene, staggering, throwing up blood, and generally looking scary and ominous.  There eyes are red, their movements herky-jerky, and their speech reduced to a venomous rasp.  Indeed, the very fact of their humanity makes them scarier than any monster Hollywood could dream up.  It's only after their first appearance that we're filled in on the back story from a couple of survivors, and a harrowing story it is.  One survivor's description of the scene at an airport where he and his family went in an effort to escape was chilling enough to give me goosebumps, with no need to resort to the typical horror-movie schlock.  When Jim discovers the bodies of his parents in their house and reads the note they left him before committing suicide, it's even moving, not a description that can often be applied to films of this ilk.
The movie quickly becomes a Darwinian struggle to survive, with Jim trying to adapt to the new reality as he and three others try to stay alive long enough to reach a bastion of humanity that they've heard broadcasting over the radio.  Not your typical road trip to be sure, but along the way the viewer actually gets a chance to become invested in the characters and care what happens to them, which occurs all too rarely in any genre.  There are plenty more scares along the way as well:  Jim and Co. have to change a tire in time to avoid an onrushing pack of the infected; Jim finds himself forced to kill a young boy with a baseball bat; and perhaps worst of all, we're subjected to the sight of the good-natured Frank (played by Brendan Gleeson, aka Hamish from ""Braveheart"") catching the rage right before the eyes of his teenage daughter.  It's all frightening stuff, especially since it tends to come out of nowhere.
Eventually Jim and two female companions find their way to a military installation where a few soldiers are holding out under the leadership of the philosophical Major Henry West.  The soldiers are a pretty jolly bunch considering their circumstances, and they certainly mount a spirited defense of their base.  In what may well be the highlight of the movie, they shoot up (and blow up) an onrushing mob of infected, with bullets and body parts flying around liberally.  For a brief moment, ""28 Days Later"" becomes an action flick, and a very entertaining one at that.
I don't want to get into the plot any more than I already have (that would sort of defeat the purpose of seeing the movie), but suffice to say that it culminates in an all-hell-breaks-loose finale that's mildly disappointing but still extremely exciting.  It's a rather fitting conclusion to a movie that's simultaneously intelligent, uncoventional, unpredictable, and suspenseful.  Since I'm not typically into horror movies I was hesitant to give this one a try, but my decision turned out to be more than vindicated.

1541882,3,B00005JMA8,"I had reasonably high hopes for this movie going in, even though I never really got a true feel for what the story was all about from the previews I had seen.  I had heard good things about 28 Days Later, so I expected to enjoy a thrilling movie experience.  What I discovered was a movie with a lot of problems.  There was potential here, and the first half of the movie seemed to be following the right track to some sort of dark and memorable destination, but then everything changed; I felt as if I were watching a completely different movie, and gradually my patience wore out to the point that I could no longer deny the fact that 28 Days Later really is, to some degree, a bad movie.  The alternate endings and the plot issues they raised only reinforced my conviction that Danny Boyle was a great explorer who lost his map once he got into this cinematic jungle.
Basically, what you have here is a virus unwittingly released in England; the virus itself is ""rage,"" the hows and wherefores of which are never really explained.  One drop of infected blood in your system, and you almost immediately turn into a maniacal killer with red eyes and a penchant for spouting out liters of blood on anything and everything.  The protagonist Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes up in the hospital to find the place deserted; as he wanders outside, he finds London itself deserted.  These scenes are rather effective, as the complete absence of musical accompaniment really reinforces the stark loneliness of Jim's environment.  Before long, Jim meets up with a couple of fellow survivors, finds out all about the infection and its apocalyptic effects, and starts dealing with a brand new future.  He and a lady named Selena meet up with a father and daughter, and the four of them eventually set off to find the ""salvation"" spoken of in an obscure radio broadcast.  Here is where the movie takes a dive.  The whole storyline involving a set of soldiers led by Major Henry West (Christopher Eccleston) - who is a few clips short of a full ammo belt - is a big mistake.  Sure, you get most of the movie's bloodier moments in the second half of the film, but the whole thing has become rather ridiculous by the end.
A lot of little things annoyed me as the story played out.  First of all, it took over half an hour for anyone to figure out that perhaps they should take a car rather than just walk everywhere.  The entire population is either dead, infected, or gone, so it's not as if finding a car and the keys to go in it is an impossible task.  In addition, there really didn't seem to be nearly enough dead bodies and traffic jams in evidence in the middle of this once-thriving and now decimated metropolis; the bodies I did see looked as fake as they actually were.  Even the heavy rains that come down later look incredibly fake.  Then you have heavy-duty military rifles that sound like a child's cap gun when fired.  One character, gun in hand, watches an enemy run directly toward him down a long hallway and then turns his head at the worst possible moment for no reason whatsoever.  And speaking of guns, our heroes never even get their hands on any firearms; their entire arsenal is a big knife and a baseball bat.  I was also disappointed to see that the elaborate setup in which the nature of the infection is presented to the audience at the beginning is never addressed again.  I wanted to know more about this virus; one of the alternate endings included on the DVD makes it pretty clear that the filmmakers really knew nothing about the virus either, and that explains why that part of the story is essentially  dropped.
28 Days Later does come with a bundle of extra features, including a commentary, a number of deleted scenes, three alternate endings, and a making-of featurette.  The alternate endings really aren't that special, though; two of them differ from the actual ending in only one important regard, and the third one is just an idea expressed through some dialogue and a series of storyboards.  As the filmmakers say on the commentary, they started thinking about the ""radical alternate ending"" late into production and ran up against a roadblock that highlights their lack of development of the entire infection concept (and implies that they were most likely not completely satisfied with the original and second endings).
Needless to say, I was really quite disappointed by 28 Days Later.  To me, the whole concept of the film needed to be explored and developed more deeply.  Some of the shots are very effective and somewhat surreal, but it seems to me that the filmmakers were depending on this radical sort of cinematography to patch over the problems with the dialogue and plot.  No matter how impressive the scenery, it's hard not to notice all the potholes in the road.",1074124800,14,4801,4.630896226415095
1541922,5,B00005JMA8,"This is actually a line of graffitti written on the wall of some church as depicted in the film.
""28 days later"" is overall a great horror film and quite possibly a classic in its genre even though it treads already stepped on ground it still has enough originality and verve in it to bring it through.
As a man wakes up from a coma after a month only to find out that humans have been almost wiped out by a deadly ""rage virus"" that makes its victims extremely aggressive and murderous a story of ultra doom unfolds filmed masterfully by Doyle (Trainspotting).
The scenes where the protagonist walks about in a deserted London where cars have been abandoned in the middle of the streets and there's no soul to be seen anywhere while screaming ""helloooooo"" are second to none when it comes to depicting catastrophe on celluloid.
Eventually, and after being attacked by raging zombies, he figures out that while he was comatose the world has turned into an arena of murder induced by the virus. Understanding the extreme danger he's under he teams up with other non-infected survivors and they try to figure out what to do but in the mode of a blind man searching for something which he doesn't know what it looks like.
The ened of the film dissapoints somewhat as the few survivors become prisoners of a near-psychosis-army-major and his few men who've set barracks somewhere in the countryside and gets further spoiled as the final scene emits out of the blue hope when the entire film actually works in showing there's no such possibility. Pity because those last 20 seconds of the closing scene are enough to take the film off its course. An ultra doom-end would not only have been very appropriate but the scenario indeed screams for an ending that leaves no hope and no light at the end of any tunnel.
Strangely enough, for those that've read Stephen King's ""the stand"" a lot of the scenes and ideas incorporated here seem to be lifted straight off that book. They fit like a glove of course but I wonder how much of the script was inspired of that novel.
Cinematically speaking it's strikingly obvious that Boyle pays hommage to classic horror directors like Romero and Carpenter. The raging zombie theme has Romero written all over it and the excellent soundtrack reminds immediately of Carpenter as does the sequence with the survivors being emprisoned in the army barracks while under literal siege which reminisces of ""Assault on precinct 13""..
Beautiful camera work, beautiful directing, incredible photography, brilliant soundtrack only marred by the ending of the film which should have been avoided. All the -outside Britain- actors are giving excellent performances (esp. the main character as well as the army major) and exactly the fact that they are not known faces helps make the film more believable.
Along with Donnie Darko (dont miss it if you haven't seen it)28 days later are easily the top indie films of last year not to metnion of the last 5 years.

Review
Danny Boyle is back on form, lets choose to ignore what I thought of The Beach and continue.  This film will do for the Zombie flick what An American Werewolf in London did for that genre.  What first strikes you about this film is that it is shot entirely on DV, yes that's right and its obvious!  The degradation in the picture quality as opposed to film works magnificently giving the work an eerie dreamlike quality on one hand, while juxtaposing that with a gritty harshness that strikes home with the inescapable nightmare of what is happening.  Indeed, the use of tilted shots from high angles gives the work a contemporary feel, creating connotations of CCTV camera footage while at the same time adding to the suspense that the central characters are always being watched and are never really alone.  Add to that the intense horror, fast camera work & editing and this is a movie that one should not miss as it is sure to spark a stream of copycat films as Blair Witch did previously.
This is not American, only British filmmakers and actors could have made this and stripped that sense of saran-wrapped packaging that is typically attached to these sorts of films.  This feels real, and the pacing works well, it isn't one corpse after another, there are lulls that make the sudden impact of horror believable.  The cast play their respective roles effectively, portraying what within the space of this film, are tangibly real people.  While it is on occasion graphically nasty, it's the horror of humanity, or should that be horror in trying to rediscover ones humanity, that Murphy, Harris & Eccleston et all deliver so well.
From the frame enhanced shots of fire that recalled in my mind old atomic test footage & the movement of the virus victims, to the simplicity of the signs of lost loved ones around Eros in Piccadilly, that invoked parallels with September 11th, this film works well on so many levels.  In my opinion the most striking of sequences involved Murphy discovering his parents dead; prior to entering the bedroom where they lay he is bathed in golden sunlight through opaque blinds that block the outside world, as if to remind us that life continues whether it be here or somewhere else.
So didn't anything about this film annoy me?  Was it really that perfect?  To be honest it was that dam good and I don't say that very often. However I will say this: that on occasion the music did seem to date the picture to era of BBC television made films from yesteryear, and at one particular moment a speech by the young actress Megan Burns seemed undermined by the soundtrack making what should have been a poignant moment quite corny.  The only other grating issue was the overwhelming amount of product placement within the film - I guess films have to be made somehow - though any film that involves the irony of a virus that wipes out mankind from the streets of London but leaves the pigeons ought to be forgiven for that I guess!
The Verdict
Only Exodus or Revelation's have come as close as the apocalyptic horror of this new text.  In the light of recent events this film becomes all the more frightening due to the reality principle that works so well, but at least the distributors on this occasion haven't feared releasing something that in my opinion really should not be missed.  It may be a horror film but that doesn't mean it has to be crap - This time Danny Boyle has proved that.",1073520000,2,4168,4.618403247631935

In the Featurettes Danny Boyle says that the RAGE virus is supposed to be road rage times 1000000000000 and anger is the only emotion you have left inside you.

This film is worthy of Romero with one exception.  There is not enough gore in this movie.  Alot of scenes where a lot of gore could exist are cut aways.  As a conisuer of violent media, this disappointed me greatly.
The Characters are pretty believable.  How would you act if the whole world were Zombies.  The story itself is not so much a zombie story, but a story of perseverence and trust.  This movie speaks on the importance of family unity over self interest.
This movie is highly recommended",1073001600,,734,4.549618320610687
1541981,2,B00005JMA8,"A major, major disappointment derived from a clever but thin premise: A ""virus"" released from an animal lab destroys the world even faster than do lust-filled soldiers (kind of makes you wonder who the really bad guys are in this film). These two acts book end an interesting jaunt through an abandoned city of London (that solitude alone leaves a small moment of awe about the production) and a drive in the English countryside (mostly the M from London to Manchester).
The negative reviews have made all the points: cliched if well-acted but empty, weak dialogue, points of illogic (like why do these virus-filled ""ragers"" only attack healthy people and seem to work together?) and social commentary (our hero first finds these rage-filled ""zombies"" sleeping in a church). Gratuitous nudity, gore and violence, overdone even for this type of film.
Along the journey to salvation, the intrepid travelers enjoy the other cliched elements of any end-of-the-word, post apocalyptic saga: splurging in  an abandoned grocery, running Christmas lights off a car battery (a sure way to attract attention from these walking dead!), trying to collect water in buckets on a roof top, siphoning gasoline from a tanker, frolicking in the ancient remains of another, earlier civilization, living in an abandoned country manor.

1541982,4,B00005JMA8,"I own this DVD movie, and I must say, I'm pretty darn impressed. The reason this review exists is to try and enlighten and encourage you to either: A. Rent this movie, or B. Buy this movie. Either way, you'll be seeing the movie, and that means I've done my job. So lets review the facts of why this movie is impressive to me. (remember, this is all my opinions)
1. Danny Boyle (the director) did an excellent job of showing a disturbing apocalyptic version of London. Not only is it disturbing, but its quite gory for a low budget movie, ensuring gore lovers will probabily enjoy this one.
2. The story was really interesting. Yes, yes, yes, I know. It may have been done quite a few times before, but ""28 Days Later"" was a pretty impressive version, and had its own way and style, not to mention being really creative, espically for a low budget film.
3. The DVD version includes 3 alternate endings. Each of them are different in their own way, and the ""radical ending"" is a pretty weird, odd, and different version of the film, showing what would have happened if there weren't any soldiers involved in the story, and since there werent, the characters would have to face something different...
4. The acting for a low budget film was basically as good as it gets. Not only do they have pretty good acting, but also includes Brendan Gleeson (who has starred in the movie ""Gangs of New York"" and the new upcoming movie ""Troy"").
5. The ""zombies"" weren't zombies... They're not even zombies! They're infected people who are extremely strong, fast and agile.
6. The movie was overall great. Period.
Anyways, besides my points of why this movie was impressive to me, the story is this.
A virus called ""Rage"" is released. People can catch the virus by either being scratched by an infected, or else any blood particle from the infected entering the non infected's body by either an open wound, eye, mouth, ear, etc. When this is happened, most, if not all of London is taken over by the virus, and only a few survivors are left. Can the few survivors survive the infected and hope for the best in the end? Shoot, GO SEE THE MOVIE AND FIND OUT!!!
There is 1 disc for the DVD edition and the bonus features include:
Audio commentary by Director Danny Boyle and writer Alex Garland, 3 alternate endings, deleted scenes with optional audio commentary, ""Pure Rage: the making of 28 Days Later"", featurette Jacknife Lee Music Video, animated storyboards, still photo galleries, theatrical trailer and more!
Rated R for strong violence and gore, language and nudity.
I hope I have convinced you into seeing this movie, regardless if you rent the movie or buy it. I suggest you RENT the movie first, though, because everybody has their different tastes!",1072828800,3,2743,4.657731958762887
1541983,3,B00005JMA8,"Hello, Hello, Hello.......It looks to me that Danny Boyle has been watching the work of US director George Romero, and has effectively remade Romero's 1985 zombie shocker ""Day of the Dead"", albeit with English accents & English locales.
I'm actually a keen fan of two of Boyle's previous films, the film noir thriller ""Shallow Grave"", and the heroin fuelled, hell ride of ""Trainspotting"", so when I heard Boyle was behind the helm of an apocalyptic thriller about an escaped super virus decimating London, I was eager to view the end result. ""28 Days Later"", is quite interesting in many places, bleak & unsettling where it needs to be, and takes some new viewpoints on the ""end of the world over run by flesh eating zombie"" genre, however, it bears far too many similarities to the forementioned ""Day of The Dead"".  Have a look at these comparisons ( WARNING : SPOILERS AHEAD ) :
Both films fundamentally open with a key cast member wandering through a major metropolis shouting ""hello, hello"", and getting the wrong response by attracting zombies / infected lunatics.
Both films feature a captured zombie / infected person being used for experimental purposes.
Both films have the chained zombie / infected person eventually breaking free to wreak havoc on those who tormented him.  ( Never, ever taunt caged zombies, they always get out and you will be first on their dinner menu !! )
Both films feature teams of soldiers holed up in a ""well defended bunker"" and yep, they've gone trigger / stir crazy in a lawless society.
Both films see these unbalanced soldiers getting on each other's nerves more and more, until their unit falls apart, allowing the zombies / infected lunatics to enter the premises, and make a meal out of anyone wearing camouflage clothing.
Both teams of soldiers in both films are led by psychotic officers ( Major West & Captain Rhodes ) who mentally unwind further as the film progresses.
Both of these commanding officers in both films eventually get their comeuppance in rather grisly circumstances.
Both films feature the female lead being sexually threatened by the teams of unbalanced soldiers.
Both films finish in rather idyllic, serene surroundings which are totally removed from the maelstrom of the rest of the picture.
So, there you have it.....quite a few similarities between Romero's 1985 zombie thriller & Boyle's 2002 apocalyptic virus epic. Having said all that, ""28 Days Later"" is still quite an enjoyable zombie film, and Boyle's highly aggressive, highly animated infected lunatics are an interesting departure from the usual ranks of living dead that stumble & shuffle around as if they've just woken up after a huge night on the booze.",1072828800,,2686,4.979955456570156

It is not predictable like all the other horror flicks out there,its worth every penny spent. BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT, don't listen to all the other reviews, there just used to all that stupid cheap horror that they don't know a good movie when they see it! Trust me!",1072828800,,516,4.118811881188119
1541985,1,B00005JMA8,"Some critic out there called this ""the scariest movie since 'The Exorcist'"". That has to be one of the most idiotic statements in the history of humankind. There isn't even so much as a nanosecond of scariness anywhere to be found in this trash heap of a movie. It starts off vaguely interesting, what with all of London being deserted except for one incredibly ugly naked man who wakes up...you guessed it...28 days after the world is wiped out by a plague. He finally runs into some survivors who aren't ""infected"" and the rip off of ""The Stand"" continues. Then, in the middle of the film, with no warning whatsoever, we skip from a horror flick to a truly disgusting social commentary that makes you roll your eyes and ensures that, no matter what happens, you won't care. As it turns out, our ""heroes"" run into a miltary outpost full of soldiers concerned with nothing more than rape. And all of a sudden the zombies stop being the bad guys and the military takes over the job, because we all know that soldiers are far more dangerous than mass numbers of murderous zombies. Anyway, the film ends with ugly naked man (who by now is at least wearing pants) enlisting the support of one such zombie in order to kill the soldiers who are going to ""rape"" the other two, thus ensuring that the species will not procreate and therefore die off. Hooray!..  That's the gist of this amazingly bad movie. Don't even bother renting it.",1072742400,13,1428,4.578125
1541986,5,B00005JMA8,"I rented this movie with low expectations, considering how many times I'd been disappointed over what could have been a great horror movie. However, within the first 15 minutes, my fears were assuaged. What the film-makers have accomplished with this film is nothing short of extraordinary. They have managed to provide gruesome and grisly entertainment as well as a deeper underlying meaning.
While the ""Last Man on Earth"" scenario has been played repetitiously for moviegoing audiences for ages, it almost seems new in this film. The characters are wonderfully played by a cast of virtual unknowns, which seems to further the whole isolationist theme. The background and incidental music, while admittedly weird, do not seem out of place in this undeniably weird film.
Of course many nay-sayers complain that the movie ends leaving too many unanswered questions. That, I believe is the whole purpose of the film. Many a viewer will leave this movie with questions racing through their heads, and if they do, the film-makers have succeeded. This movie was made to ask questions.
And in a time when such horrible, pointless films are being made today, better to leave questions unanswered than to have never asked any questions at all.",1072396800,4,1235,5.118811881188119
1541987,4,B00005JMA8,"Getting a storyline for a movie that will actually be terrifying is a tough thing to do today, but this movie does it fairly well.  The highlight of this movie is not the in the main characters, who are boring and often annoying, but in the ZOMBIES!!  The zombies just look awesome, but the best thing about them is that they are damn FAST.  In other zombie flicks, the zombies are slow moving creatures, which makes you wonder how the main characters ever get caught.  In this one however, the zombies are FAST and VICIOUS - the people who are still alive after the plague barely have a chance to survive because the zombies are just too quick.
Although the end of the movie is a little bit disappointing after all the previous action, I would suggest buying or renting the DVD and watching all the other endings to see just how far the directors and writers came.  They went from a ridiculously implausible ending to one that is actually feasible, albeit boring.",1072396800,,964,4.5491329479768785

1542039,5,B00005JMA8,"We know you are mad because 28 Days Later isn't really a ""horror"" movie, but it got the review ""SCARY AS HELL"" for a reason. The zombies and killing isn't suppose to be the scary part of the movie. It's giving the viewers the illusion of waking up after an accident...and having nothing, and have no idea what is going on, and nothing to live for.
The movies scary because it's showing you how a man, a father and his teenage daughter, and a woman are fighting to survive in a world overthrown with a virus they can't fight.
Is a movie ""good"" or ""scary"" if it's horror genre is slasher, like Freddy? Pointless killing of teenagers to scare teen couples while they hold each other in their parents living rooms?
Wouldn't it be a little scarier to wake up and have nothing. Your environment is beautiful, yet run down. You meet a group of people like you...trying to survive the disease.
This movie is brilliant, and I loved it. Shots of the group driving through an empty country side is plain amazing and beautiful. I really like the scene where the father is looking and sees the horses running. That is one of my favorite scenes from a movie.
This movie is beautiful, yet horrifying in a way that most ""horror"" films don't come close to acheiving. This is the best movie of the year, and is one of my favorites ever.
This is a must see if your tired of these lame horror films with psycho killers chasing teenage girls ...
This is, perhaps, the scarriest movie ever made. It seems only a few people what the point of the movie is.",1072224000,2,1532,4.397887323943662
1542040,3,B00005JMA8,"""28 Days Later"" could easily be the fourth installment in George Romero's ""Living Dead"" trilogy - only this time the zombies have a bit more get up and go to them.
When Jim wakes up out of a coma one day, he discovers that not only is he the only person in the hospital but virtually the only person left in the entire city of London.  After wandering through the deserted city streets for awhile, he eventually runs into a couple of stalwart survivors who inform him that 28 days earlier a plague began sweeping across the planet - catalyzed by the release of some infected test monkeys - causing people to turn into mindless killing machines and passing on the virus to their victims through their blood.
Although ""28 Days Later"" is little more than a rip-off of those earlier zombie classics, director Danny Boyle does bring a certain level of artistry to his handling of the material, particularly with his apocalyptic visions of a London and an English countryside utterly bereft of human beings.  There's a real end-of-the-world eeriness to much of what we see on the screen, a product more of suggestiveness than of blatant visualization.  Indeed, Boyle shows the zombies as little as possible, a wise move for a couple of reasons: first, because leaving a threat unspecified allows the audience to use its imagination, thereby heightening the suspense and tension, and, second, because, quite frankly, these fleet-footed zombies simply aren't all that terrifying when we get a close-up view of them (certainly not on a level with Romero's lumbering - and truly horrifying - originals).  And that, perhaps, is the biggest complaint I have against the film.  For all the impressiveness of the visuals and the tone, ""28 Days Later"" just isn't a very scary film in the long run.  The plotting is derivative, the characters not very well developed, and the poorly staged final showdown more laughable than frightening.  Like two many horror films, this one suffers from a weak third act, with the anticipatory windup more impressive than the delivery.
There's a lot to admire and recommend in ""28 Days later.""  But it just doesn't get under the skin the way the best horror films do - and the nightmares just don't come.",1071964800,3,2223,4.831578947368421
1542041,5,B00005JMA8,"I and one of my most nitpicky friends went to see this, and when we came out, neither one of us could find a single thing wrong with it. That everyone involved with this movie actually cared about what they were doing, from the director all the way down to the caterers, shows through.
The plot is not revolutionary; what makes this a great movie (I want to call it the best movie of the year, but Last Samuari and Return of the King do make me hesitate...) is the incredible way in which it's done. It is an astounding execution of an isolation drama (rather than a zombie movie, which it is bizarrely called). The acting is solid and sincere. The music is so subtle that you are barely conscious of it at times, but it creates and complements the moods of the film wonderfully. The grainy quality of the DV cinematography also puts you very much in the film with the characters. Nothing looks crystal-clear, nor perfect, nor certain--just as it would be if we awoke to find the world we knew in ruins. In a certain sense, it evokes the quality of memory, and seems far more real for it.
This is not perfect social commentary, and it doesn't aspire to be. Jim is not a perfect person, he's just Jim--the everyman. The question this movie asks is simply ""What would you do?"" and it answers it in a way that doesn't preach, but merely makes you think.
Buy it, watch it. You won't regret it.",1071878400,2,1389,4.366795366795367
1542042,3,B00005JMA8,"If ""In the Bedroom"" was a zombie movie, it might look something like this.  I applaud the director for his goregeous cinematography in many areas, such as the panoramic views of the deserted cities and countryside.  Also, I enjoyed the documentary style.  The soundtrack does not overwhelm the action and is not overly manipulative, which is certainly refreshing in this day and age.  The characters are witty and likeable.  However, the movie simply isn't scary.  In fact, it comes dangerously close to ""feel-good"" territory.  And while there's nothing wrong with feeling all warm and fuzzy at times -- especially at the end -- the sense of dread that was advertised is entirely missing.  By no means is this a bad film, but I am diappointed that so many critics chose to misrepresent it.  Ultimately, the film is a good change of pace and perspective, but I don't see it having much more value than that.",1071792000,,906,4.7935483870967746
1542043,4,B00005JMA8,"This movie is very well made. The direction is disturbing, the acting is decent, the script is also very good. The plot is a little far fetched, but this is a movie. There are always discrpencies in movies as oppossed to reality. And do you know why that is? It is because this is a movie, not reality. Pointing out little details that are wrong or inconsestant obviously makes some reviewers feel smart and special, hurray for you!!! Maybe I can join the fun and be smart like you! In this moive there were no cars clogging the streets, Why? It seems to me that if a disease was wiping out the population people would try to flee in cars, the cars would get in epic traffic jams, and then would be abondened on the roads. In this movie the streets are empty. Look I just found a discrepincy, something that does not make sense in a movie. WOW!! I am so smart. Let me congragulate myself, I feel so superior now, hurray for me!!! This is the kind on nonensense that reviewers who do not like this movie write, but that is o.k. because they are worthless fools anyway. The ""infected"" are great villins, puking blood onto others to infect them, very oringinal. The scene where the black girl hacks up the guy because he got infected was amazing, sick but fascinating. This is what people have to do to survive now in this nighmare world. I thought that a lot of reviewers overestimated the social messages of this movie, there were some but they act like this movie was nothing but a trojan horse by which the directors snuck thier political views into the film. I thought that the social messages were but a sidebar, the point of the movie was to tell a scary story about a world gone to hell, and in this they were successful. The music was haunting, and the transformation from a regular person to a ""infected"" was grotesue. However, just becuase most people have become infected does not mean that those who are not infected are all good or friendly. Horny soldiers by themselves in such circumstances could very well do what they did in this movie. It seems to me that a lot of people do not like this movie because it is honest, and thus it contradicts their brainwashed mentality which is built on a foundation of lies. Given the chance soldiers would not become rapists? Espically in a post-apocolptyic setting where there is no authority beyond their own desires and power? The soldiers are the law now, they are the last remnet of the government and their power is now unchecked because they have to answer to no one. Given those circumstances soldiers would rape, as would men in general. Animalistic desires which are constantly held in check most of the time are now given free reign, power corrupts, regardless if it is a soldier, a priest, or even a bleeding heart liberal we are discussing. Another reviewer suggusts that we come back to reality, sorry pal, you are the one that is deluded if you honestly think that what the soldiers did in this movie is that far fetched. Just look at what soldiers have done to women throughout history even when there was someone to punish them for their actions! Now imagine what they would do if they were never held accountable! It is idiotic statements like the ones made by that reviewer and others that really make me wonder what they are thinking. It is obvious they are in denial and live in some sort of fairytale universe where authority is never corrupt or evil. You guys should stick to GI Joe cartoons or FOX NEWS. The social aspect of this movie is really only a complimentary part of the plot, yet some reviewers have fixated on it. This is a sign that the social observations have touched a nerve. This movie is not nearly as bad as you portray it to be, espcially the reviewer named Ian from England. Why is it that every reviewer from England is arrogant, obnoxious, condencinding and a total jackass. ""this might have gone over American's heads"", wow! you are so sophisticated in England, so much smarter than everyone else. Please!!! Most of you people are nothing but tame, exploited establishment intellectuals that jusitify the status quo. You are the kind of people that would be singing the praises of Hitler if you lived in Nazi Germany, and singing the praises of Stalin if you lived in Soviet Russia. England is nothing but one big prison, cameras everywhere, watching everyone, but that is fine by you right.

1542045,4,B00005JMA8,"I thought this film was extremely well done. As a skeptic of horror films, moreover a skeptic of apolocolyptic horror films, I was very much entertained by the underlying themes that littered this film.
Who'd have thought a group of animal activists would incite a world-wide spread of a potentially devistating virus? Well they do and 28 days later the story that follows is excellent.
""The Infected"" are probably some of the scariest bad-guys I have ever seen in a movie. As an action fan, I think it's safe to say there's some comedy found in the way the un-infected dispose of the seemingly unstoppable menace that finds them in London's nooks and crannys.
By the time our heroes find the source of the miltary's distress signal, the directors make it clearly evident that things are far from ok. Although Jim and company seem to be safely confined in the 47th's well secured mansion in Manchester, the man leading this group of outlandish militants seems to be as sick as the ""infected.""
To make a long story short, good can over come overwhelming evil. And this film illustates just that. And in many ways.
Before I saw '28 Days Later' I had NO IDEA that people involved with 'Trainspotting' and 'The Beach' we're involoved.
Now that I have watched it a second time, I can see the similatities. I LOVE 'Trainspotting' and thought 'The Beach' was very original. If you threw these two films in a blender with 'The Omega Man' and 'Dawn of the Dead' the end result would be similar...
Just see the movie, it's very good.",1071360000,2,1523,4.66542750929368
1542046,5,B00005JMA8,"I am not a good review writer but I feel that the people below me know nothing about movies and they do NOT give this exquisite film justice. I am a college film  and photography student currently taking a class titled ""The Horror Film,""  so needless to say I have learned a couple of things about the genre. First of all this film is pure eye candy: from all the satrical posters scattered through the background (yes lady below me, I am an American and I did notice the background posters), to the cleaver methods of shooting through molded glass. The cinamatography of this film is so good that you can stop 28 Days Later at any momment and capture an amazing photo. Few films display this level of cinemaphotography. Second this film pays homage to the great zombie horror flics from the 70's such as The Omega Man, and Dawn of the Dead but it still adds its own new twist instead of trying to mimic them ( example: running zombies) . Infact some of the scenes within the film are near duplicates from Dawn of the Dead with new creative input. Third the cast of characters is great! The only characters that are well known by U.S. standards are the Evil General ( sorry forgot his name ) and Naomi Campbell. This destroys all biases that we normally attribute to popular actors when watching them in alternate roles. When seeing this film, one is completly unaffected by these biases and main characters role is well taken. Forth this is a great Horror film because it touches on our current fears of chemical warfare instead of some other redundant theme. The ""anser to infection,"" is a perfect example of this theme that elevates 28 Days Later above other horror flics. Lastly, this film comments on society, and rises questions about humanity such as ""Is chemical warefare our greatest threat, or is mankind its own threat."" this is portrayed through the evil soldiers who are more manacing that the infected themselves. In conclusion, you should not pass this film up because you will be missing one of the better horror films of this generation. I was always jeallous of the people in the 70's that could be appart of the great cult films released during that time. Now I have my own cult flim thanks to Danny Boyle. (sorry for my horrid grammer and laguage, I just felt this film needed propper support)

1542047,5,B00005JMA8,"With 28 Days Later, a brilliant and suspensful horror movie, writer Alex Garland (of The Beach fame) and director Danny Boyle (of the Trainspotting Fame) have teamed up to bring us a modern-day experience in terror. With this film, we are given an urban apocalyptic tale that will chill you to the very bone.
When a young man wakes up from a coma naked in a hospital, he soon realizes that there is something horribly wrong with the world. Everyone seems to be gone and, when he finally encounters a group of people, they seem to have turned into blood thirsty monsters. It's only when he teams up with a Selina and her friend that he learns that a virus has destroyed the greater part of England's population and turned many others into monsters.
This virus is, simply put, rage. People are infected with it and turn into crazy, blood thirsty, zombie-like monsters that no longer fear anything. When Jim goes to his home and finds his parents dead, you know this movie isn't going for the cheap thrills. Instead, it tries to hit a kind of emotional terror we don't often find in Hollywood films.
Some have said that the film gets out of hand in the end, when our group of survivors tries to find comfort in a band of military men who are everything but what they seem to be on the surface. But I think that the brilliance of this film is that, by the end, Jim becomes inficted with rage himself, but of a different kind. The film doesn't get out of hand, it only shows that sometimes, the human race is the one thing to fear.
28 Days Later is simply brilliant in every shape and form. It has made amazing discoveries in actors Cillian Murphy and Naomi Harris. With a minimalist score, a digital video-style imagery and very engaging editing, 28 Days Later is bound to become a modern-day horror classic. You won't see a better horror film this year.

You need to pay attention to the details.  What happens is that an innocent group of animal environmentalists break into a lab that is testing on chips.  Security finds them and then warns them.  They do not listen, but instead try to free the chips.  All hell then breaks loose.  The virus that these chips possess quickly spreads, turning innocent people onto other innocent people.  The game is now survival; you are trying to save your own self.  I see that a hidden message from this film is to resolve your hatred and differences with others because you never know if you are going to have to depend on these people in case of a crisis as this movie showed.  The bottom line is that hatred and rage do not solve anything; they only add to the pot that is stewing.

I do not call this a zombie movie I just call it a Survivle movie. The puking of the zombie's was a nice cool thing but don't call it a zombie movie. It has zombies in it but only 70% of the movie.

1542076,5,B00005JMA8,"28 Days Later"" is not simply a zombie/horror flick for those who are hoping for blood, gore and information thrown at them. The level at which one must watch this movie is far different from the level needed to watch teen slashers such as ""Scream"" or other zombie movies. First of all, nowhere is there a mention of zombies. They are infected. That is what is truly frightening about this film. They are humans, they are alive. They are simply incapable of feeling any other emotion but blinding, crippling rage.
This is not by any means a horror in the traditional sense. Rather, it is a psychological horror. The idea of the movie is terrifying. Awakening in a hospital, completely alone and disoriented, knowing only that something has wiped out the civilization of such a large city as London. This is a truly foreshadowing movie, in the wake of the deadly diseases overcoming the world in recent times. One must watch this movie with a complete open mind, ready to accept that this is what society could very well revert to. The soldiers, in particular, are a proper example. They have given up hope after such a short time. They have already convinced themselves that there is no other way.
The film does not contain any well known actors (save for Christopher Eccleston, although here in the US many have not heard of him). Therefore, you are not drawn to any character because of the actor portraying them. You are drawn to them for the way Alex Garland has written them.
Do not watch ""28 Days Later"" expecting to cower beneath your seat with a soiled pair of pants. The fear inflicted from this movie is a much more real fear. Solitude. Desolation. Destruction. No blood and gore could do the same.",1070755200,3,1707,4.655629139072848

1542078,5,B00005JMA8,"Many people went to the theaters expecting to see the scariest movie of all time here, but it is nothing of the sort. The ""scary"" moments are more ominous than anything, especially the scenes of Jim walking through a completely deserted London. Danny Boyle uses a technique that so many other horror directors should use, that constantly seeing the enemy is not always the scariest thing, the fear of suspense is. There are definitely creepy moments in this film, but nothing that should make you jump out of your seat.
The direction of this film is brilliant, as Boyle uses a distinctly European style in his approach to filmmaking. You will see the elements that were so impressive in ""Trainspotting"" and ""The Beach"" used here again, effectively as usual.
""28 Days Later"" offers a grim look at a possible future for mankind, as the world is quickly taken over by a plague of rage, unknowingly cast into society by foolish activists trying to free test monkeys. This movie is great in displaying the search for hope in a world where there should be none, as things continually get worse for the core group of characters.
The acting from virtual unknowns here is very strong, as well as convincing, and much of this can be attributed to the dark script penned by Alex Garland, author of ""The Beach"" and ""The Tesseract"". His gloomy outlook transferred well to film, and his story is a very convincing one. The DVD is pretty good, although there are not many extra features here. But the three different endings provided are very interesting, showing vastly different possibilities in this story of survival.

Eventually he discovers that creepy, monster-like humans (all infected with a 'rage' virus) do exist as they roam the streets at night.  Naturally, he is chased throughout the city and is rescued by a couple of non-infected humans.  This movie is a thrilling, fast moving ride with the good over evil theme.

The acting by Murphy and others is superb.

It seemed to me that this film was simply a showcase for gore, violence, and red eyed zombie freaks, unless I'm missing some deeper point.  I certainly don't think that there was a lesson to be learned.  This film was also problematic in many respects, and unrealistic to say the least.  I doubt there would truly be a happy ending as positioned in the film if there were an unstoppable global contagion.  This film conveniently leaves too many questions unanswered.  How did the fighter jet pilot survive?  Did a government organize itself to look for remaining survivors?  How come some infected died and others remained zombies?

1542133,2,B00005JMA8,"""28 Day""s starts out well. Yes, you see ""Omega Man"" (not to mention the best of all - the fine 1964 Vincent Price film ""Last Man on Earth"") and Romero's Dead films.  But there's a trippy topical newness to the start of 28 Days, as animal rights terrorists (and there are such groups) release a havoc causing virus into the British population. The jerky camera work is effective, in the short term. And up until Jim and his little group gets out of London, there is some serious dread. (The zombies are the most jacked up zombies in the horror canon.)
But the movie's mixed signals start multiplying quickly.  I suppose one shouldn't think too hard about the story, but the genius of Romero (and others), is that you keep it somewhat simple. For example, ""28 Days"" hints at Jim's Catholicism, even has some music to reinforce it, and then does nothing with it. Next, you have bike-courier Jim carrying on like a Special Forces guy, kicking both zombie and bad soldier behind. Rambo or St. Francis? One reason I rode with this split for a while, is that there were hints that there may or may not be something wrong with Jim. Was he infected in some way? A hybrid? Who knows? He certainly has his I-love-violence moments where one could draw parallels, due to the obvious direction of the film, between him and the zombies. And in one scene, he goes out of his way to seek it out. But the dots are never connected. And then there's whole second half of the movie, which is a wash. The rogue soldiers looking for women to start their new world seems pretty silly and contrived even by horror flick standards. What's also silly is how these same heavily armed soldiers can't kill a single zombie or bike courier in the movie's last 10 minutes. Jeez, these guys are soft when something bad gets in the house. The mean little kids from ""Lord of the Flies"" could of done more with less.
So in other words, 28 Days fails for quite a few reasons. Yes, it has energy and is stylish (especially if you like strobe lights), at least for about 20 or 30 minutes. And then the virus wears off. And it's only those effective minutes that get the two stars.",1069891200,6,2140,4.456632653061225

I have seen a lot of movies in my day, and had yet to be entirely disappointed by a movie until now.  I was so excited to see this movie because of all the critical acclaim, but just hadn't gotten around to renting it.
I think the fact that I was anticipating this movie so much may have led to my utter dissatisfaction.  I thought the movie was terrible.  For one, there is no sense of time in the movie.  Morning turns to night in less than what the movie is depicting as 5 or 10 minutes.  I think this flaw was the deciding factor in my final judgement of the movie, though there were many others.  I don't think the characters were as developed as I'd like.  I don't mean that I want to know everything about them, but I would like to at least have a general sense of personality.
Another thing that I didn't like was the ending(s).  I'm not going to give any details out in my review, but after seeing all the endings, I really wish they would have just ended the movie after they left the compound.  They ruined it even further by writing the cheezy ending(s) that they did.

The idea of a virus of rage may be surreal but it allows the movie to show how some people even w/o the virus behave as rageful animals toward other humans while others behave with compassion.  It also makes me look at all of the violence I absorb into my mind and how it affects me.
Although there are no big stars in this movie, it is well done.  Like Trainspotting, by the same director, it is disturbing at times to watch but also rewarding at times.  It shows the best and worst of humanity.

Jim, played by the up-and-coming Irishman Cillian Murphy is the initially bewildered lead in this 'Omega Man' meets 'Outbreak' film depicting a dishevelled and disintegrated Britain where most people are either dead or have contracted 'Rage', a disease that turns you into an extremely unpleasant zombie.
Jim falls in with a small group that seek shelter in a Mancunian stronghold containing the remnants of a British Army platoon. All is not what it seems and things very quickly turn pear-shaped.
Boyle stirs the pot and comes up with a blend of the old guard from previous movies (Trainspotting, Shallow Grave)whilst giving the lead goes to a somewhat unknown actor. Works well.

1542181,2,B00005JMA8,"Lets just start the review here.
These monkeys in a research lab are being tested and some animal activists break in. The researcher warns them but they let the monkeys out anyway. Then the movie starts with a guy naked. Kinda weird, but alright. Anyways, the creepiness starts when noone is around except him. We know why, he doesn't.
Anyways, once Jim meets the other 2 survivors, they go to this house. The house lets Jim remember things, and then BOOYAKA the jump point comes. Yea, you probably will jump because the sound kicks up alot when this zombie comes! Thats it. The movie had a great thing going. I was getting ready to jump whenever I saw bodies and such, but never. The movie could of had you jumping at every turn, but it doesn't.
The characters are nice, but again... This movie isn't scary at all. I jumped once at the beggining. We basically see these few people travel far to a military compound where these soldiers are apparently saying. Of course, the main character kicks some ...(against 1 zombie in the whole film and like 10 guys), but its almost as if the director forgot about the zombies, because they become useless. I am going to be honest... You will probably completely forget about the zombies and such about 30 minutes into this 1 hour 40 minute film, and you should. Theres like 1 or 2 zombies after that. Honestly, it turns into an action movie. Mostly because Jim kills these guys, and doesn't care about the zombies as you will see(neither will you).
There is no vicious killer, and the movie isn't scary. I hate to say it, but the alternate endings are worthless. I watched 2 of them(there are like 3) and I was done. They are retarted. Then there is the actual ending. The movie basically starts creepy, then for about 45 minutes(im not exaggerating) you will witness no zombies(except a little mob of them but you know they are coming a mile away) but they won't matter. Honestly, the movie has you kinda creeped for 15 minutes, then it's 45 minutes of no action except shopping in a supermarket and replacing a tire....

1542182,3,B00005JMA8,"I saw ""28 Days Later"" in the theaters and enjoyed it, then bought the DVD and enjoyed it much less, some of its flaws becoming more obvious to me. But it's still an okay movie, very unique in a world of look-alike Hollywood thrillers.
I read some of the reviews on Amazon.com to get a feel for what others thought of the movie and I'm a little confused. I guess there are two different ways to view the film - first as a horror film. This seems to be how most viewers received the movie and in that light I'm amazed anyone liked it at all. This isn't a horror film, and I don't think director Danny Boyle (Trainspotting, The Beach) *tried* to make a horror film. Certainly there are scary and disturbing moments in it (although I don't remember any ""15-second close-ups of rotten dead babies"" as one melodramatic reviewer commented), but taken as an overall picture, I just don't consider it a horror film, which leads us to the second lens through which to view it, as a psychological thriller. It is in this mode that the movie succeeds - and fails. Mostly fails. But at least in that context it becomes watchable, maybe even likeable.
Yeah, yeah, Danny, we get your little point. In a post apocalyptic world where there is disease to fight, as well as monstrous creatures to avoid, we as humans will just fight amongst ourselves. What a profoundly average statement to make. It's clichd, boring, solipsistic and self-righteous (yes! I've been trying to work ""solipsistic"" in somewhere). Not only is it all those things, ""28 Days Later"" had the potential to be so much more than that. It was filmed in a fresh way, had interesting characters we cared about, had legitimate character growth and an enthralling concept. It's almost as if Boyle didn't understand what was great about his movie and chose the conventional, boring way out.
And that's the main emotion I was left with, it could have been far better than it was. Good effort, better than most of the mundane trash put out in the last year or so, but only a shadow of what it could've been. Some examples? Thought you'd never ask.
1. Why did we need the first scene with the animal rights activists breaking into the research facility? Imagine how much cooler it would've been to just start the movie with Jim (the main character) waking up in a hospital - and everyone in London is dead. He doesn't know why, neither do we. Then he would spend half the movie discovering what happened, along with the audience. Much better, much more suspenseful, much more unique.
2. The disease is just incredibly stupid. Forcing apes to watch horrific scenes of violence is not going to spawn a virus, or make a virus worse. Showing the apes watch human aggression only reinforces Boyle's little ""can't we all just get along"" statement. Why not think up a realistic virus? Why do we need some scientifically impossible infection? It hurt the movie and in many ways set the pace for the audience - this movie was not really about the virus at all. (And a minor point here - even if we had to have the ape scene with the ""horrific clips,"" it's ridiculous to assume the scientists would've used rioting incidents you might see on CNN. They would've used clips that are far more violent and sickening than foreigners throwing bottles at cops.)
3. The soldiers should not have even been in the movie. Here Boyle has a great film in the making, he's created characters we care about and a fictional world which we are sucked into - and then he takes us right out of it. We don't need an apocalyptic disease ridden world for Boyle to tell the story of the soldiers - this could've been told anywhere in a hundred different situations. About an hour into this movie, it stops being about a plague and it starts being about disagreeable humans. We have enough of those movies! Why, Danny?
4. Even if you had to include the soldiers, it seemed unrealistic they would've been that desperate not even a month after the infection. Remember, only 28 days has gone by. Would these trained men really be at the point of raping a fifteen year old? Of surrendering to the plague, not even trying to get to America or somewhere else? It's hard to believe they would.
Then there's the DVD itself. There are some good features on it, more than most DVDs have, but nothing making it worth buying. The alternate endings are completely lame, identical with the exception of a character living or dying. The ""radical"" alternate ending shows how little in control of his idea Boyle actually was, and we can only be thankful they let this idea die before it was fully realized. He actually had the idea of using a blood transfusion to cure the disease. A blood transfusion. Granted, they realized how stupid it was, but the fact that it was even entertained for a split second speaks volumes.
Lastly, the one positive thing. The music was great. But don't get the movie for that, get the soundtrack.",1069459200,2,4920,4.592045454545454
1542183,3,B00005JMA8,"Warning!! If you are the type of person who cares about movies being consistent, cohesive, logical and sensible from beginning to end, don't even consider watching this particular one, it will only make you mad! There is a lot of hacking, slashing, biting, shooting, fountains of blood, and 15-second closeups of rotten dead babies in this movie, plus buck naked guys and child rape attempts, so it is definitely not for kids.
If this kind of issues don't bother you, read on.
The basic plot of the movie is:
A virus breaks out that turns people into raging maniacs that keep biting uninfected people and spreading the infection this way. The Infected are depicted quite well and can be rather scary on occasion. Fast-forward 28 days, the main character wakes up and finds himself in deserted London. Here we see some pretty great scenes, the abandoned city looks quite impressive. He meets with some other survivors and they try to find a way out of this mess. They head to an army holdout near Manchester where the plot gets kinda strange as the few weeks of disaster have not been easy on the soldiers and all they have on their minds is raping their female visitors. After that there is a lot more slashing, biting and blood to almost the very end. The end itself is a cliffhanger and might be disappointing as it is unclear of what really happened.
I spent a long time thinking how to classify this movie or its intended audience, here are some theories:
1) Philosophical apocalypse drama, intended to make people think about human nature and other serious things. There are lots of ""symbolic"" details in the movie pointing in this direction, and don't get me wrong, some of them are actually quite interesting. This idea is however greatly weakened by countless inconsistencies, logic flaws and needless violence. Not that I have a weak stomach but some of the gore just didn't help conveying any deeper meaning here.
2) Simple horror flick, intended to scare people. The problem with this idea is that a horror movie should be at least a little bit believable in order to be effective. However, there are so many silly things that keep interrupting the suspense that some situations get laughable instead of scary. Also, the main characters keep behaving in annoying and mindbogglingly stupid ways, so that it gets hard to sympathize with them. This kind of behavior is common in horror movies but got a bit overboard here.
3) Something oddly perverse that I can't find a proper name for, intended for people who need something ""unusual"" to get them excited. There are many details that indicate the moviemakers think in some twisted way. For example, we are introduced to the protagonist when he lies in a hospital bed, totally naked.

1542184,5,B00005JMA8,"Danny Boyle (Trainspotting, The Beach) directs this horror film, which is everything that is proclaimed by the review tagline on the back of the DVD package.  28 Days Later is the most visionary horror film to come along in years, thanks in part to some excellent performances from everyone involved, a super creepy atmosphere that is more than believable, and a refreshing take on the zombie genre.  When Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes out of a coma, he finds the hospital, along with just about all of England, deserted and abandoned.  Soon enough, he finds out why, and with the help of a few survivors, struggles to survive the onslaught of rage infected virus carriers.  The word zombie is never mentioned once during the film, but it's pretty apparent what this rage virus does to people, and the film never slows down from the time of its' opening sequence on.  28 Days Later is the scariest zombie film to come along since the original Dawn of the Dead, and with it's share of twists and turns, is always full of surprises, and this is clearly Boyle's best directorial effort since Trainspotting.  Anyone who calls this film boring obviously considers Scream a classic, and older horror fans who were raised on horror films like Romero's Dead trilogy and Halloween will find plenty to admire with this modern day classic.  The DVD extras here are great as well, including the commentary by Boyle and writer Alex Garland, plus 3 alternate endings.",1069372800,3,1450,4.82258064516129

Before anyone rolls their eyes at the pretext of the situation the movie is based on, consider Ebola, West Nile virus, etc. Could something like this really be that far from happening?
The story begins with confusion as the protagonist tries to piece together what has happened over the last few weeks while he has been in a coma. Then from the non-stop thrills and scares of trying to escape from the ""infecteds"", to the highly intense conclusion of having to escape from a group even more sinister than those who are diseased, the viewer is kept of the edge of his or her seat.
Fun for scares and thrills, but also thought-provoking in premise, this is one film that will grab hold of you and not let go until after the credits have rolled. See it today if think you can handle it...",1069200000,9,951,4.6
1542267,3,B00005JMA8,"""28 Days Later"" is a madcap romp through a post-apocalyptic world where the men are men and the women are scared. It features fine performances by a cast of relative unknowns (Brendan Gleeson probably is the only actor in this movie that you have heard of), but the direction lacks comedic focus. The movie delivers more scares than laughs. In fact, I don't recall even chuckling one time -- a serious indictment of a film that professes to be a black comedy of manners set in the near future.
Perhaps if the characters  infected by ""rage"" didn't move spastically and develop glowing red eyes, the comedic potential would be realized. The movie is redeemed by its social message: that liberals, environmentalists and animal-rights activists are responsible for the world's ills, and if only corporations and scientists were allowed to irradiate produce, perform cruel experiments upon primates, and choose technology's direction without the interference of bleeding-heart do-gooders, all the world's peoples would be united and happy amid a cornucopia of flawless consumer goods. If you are under the misapprehension that corporations are responsible for social disintegration and environmental degradation, this film will set you straight: Our problems are all the fault of those damned dirty environmentalists and animal-rights activists and consumer advocates.",1069027200,,1363,5.459715639810427
1542268,1,B00005JMA8,"My partner was very curious to see ""28 Days Later"", which, as the ballyhoo went, was this ""ultra-scary"" film that critics and audiences were praising to the skies. Doubting Thomas that I am, was skeptical. So, off we went and rented the DVD. And were we surprised! What would you get if you took ""On the Beach"", ""The World, the Flesh and the Devil"", all of George Romero's ""Dead"" films, ""Rambo"", and even ""The Crying Game"", threw them all together in an editing room, and what would you come up with? This film! The film did hold our interest about halfway through the film, though we felt the ""music video""-style music extremely distracting and annoying, reminding us that we were ""watching a movie"". We did express interest in the characters, though they were, of course, ""horror/action"" movie characters, i.e. 2-dimensional. And yes, characters that we began to identify with were brutally killed off well into the film, ala Hitchcock's ""Psycho"", but then the film just went berserk and fell apart. A maniac British army officer and his goons in a mansion-turned military compound begin to brutalize the (now 3) survivors of a deadly rage-inducing plague to sexist views of womanhood and such. Dressing a ""strong"" black woman and a 14 year old white girl in red prom dresses with the intention of using them for ""man's pleasure"", now really! And the soft-spoken, sensitive hero turns into an avenging Rambo to save them! And the ending? Don't ask! My partner and I both felt like we'd been ""had"". But, courageous souls that we were, watched the extra features on the DVD. The alternative ending (which isn't an ending, really, it's more like the second half of the film) shown in story-board with voice-overs, would certainly have been a much more interesting choice than the wayward direction that this film took. And director Boyle and company's pontificating about the ""threat of deadly viruses and their possibility"" is all fine and lofty stuff, but that doesn't excuse nor validate this misbegotten, bloody mess. The end product should speak for itself. Alfred Hitchcock didn't film presumptuous, preachy explanations following the endings of ""Psycho"" or ""The Birds"", did he? Have audiences forgotten the criteria that justify a ""well-made"" and ""entertaining"" film, such as structure, character development, and coherency? ""28 Days Later"" is yet another example of ""The Emperor's New Clothes"", ladled out to a very complacent, naive, uneducated audience. If you are 20 years old and have been raised solely on MTV, then this is a ""great"" film. To quote a friend's mother, ""They didn't have ME in mind when they made this"".

1542269,4,B00005JMA8,"I had never heard of this movie before watching it and had no idea what it was going to be about. Someone just brought it over to my house. If you've read the other reviews you already know the premise of the film so I won't recap.
Obviously many people didn't like it. Some of the people who didn't like it were people dumb enough to think it would be a good movie to watch along with their children. Obviously these are people of poor judgement and should not be trusted. There are others who didn't think their was enough gore. Many of my favorite horror movies are heavey on 'gore' but I don't think that pools of blood are what make a movie frightening. If all you wan't to see is gore than this is not the film for you.
Those who didn't like the film because it didn't have an original story line are the only one's that have a valid point IMO. The story is a cross between 'Outbreak' and 'Dawn Of The Dead'. So, yes, it's been done before. This movie simply combines those idea's and makes a very good movie out of them. Being a fan of Romero's work didn't ruin this film for me.
Here's what I liked about the film:
It gives the viewer a genuine sense of emptiness and paranoia. The inflicted(Zombies as some have refered to them) are not bumbling baffoons. The 'RAGE' they have contracted provokes them to behave as rabid dogs rather than zombies in desperate need of prozac. I'm not really sure why directors usually love to portray zombies as slow and stupid.
The acting is neither bad nor great. I like that the protagonists are not turned into superheros. They pretty much speak and behave as normal human beings would. It gives the movie a sense of realism and darkness. Most horror movies have acting that is either very bad or over the top.
Although it's considered a horror movie it's more than that. It's a parable about the essense of being human. The protagonists find themselves stuck in a tough position. If they care too much and become to attached to each other they will most likely not survive. On the other hand, if they are unable to care about or have a meaningful connection to anyone what is the point of their survival? I thought the scene where the little girl tells the rest of the group 'you need us as much as we need you' was very powerful. It makes you think about how your decisions and actions affect the quality of your life.
Overall, it's a good movie. Not a fiver but worth four for being suspensful and thoughtful. Much better than most of the thrillers they've been putting out the last few years.",1068940800,4,2541,4.397027600849257
1542270,5,B00005JMA8,"I was somewhat sceptical about this movie before I saw it. I have seen so many bad horror movies that I have almost given up on horror movies. This movie renewed my faith in horror.
This is set in London and Manchester and the surrounding countryside. Most of England has been turned into zombies by a rage virus and the few uninfected survivors have to stay alive as they try to reach Manchester to get help from the army there.
The acting in this movie was superb and the camera work was done to perfection. I could find very few flaws in it and I enjoyed it immensely. It is now one of my favourite films.",1068854400,,608,4.25
1542271,4,B00005JMA8,"Whoa, seems to me I write a lot of reviews on zombie flicks, so here I go again.  28 Days Later seems to be a film that people are simply divided over.  You will either loathe it or love it.  I wouldn't go so far as to say I ""love"" this film, but it certainly is a statement of the times.  Paranoia seems to fill almost every scene in film, and it is a reflection of the fear many across the world feel in the wake of 9/11.  The possibility of something like this happening is frightening and realistic, though for the sake of entertainment there is the ""suspension of disbelief"" factor that comes into play in most films.  The film revolves around a super-virus that seems to have plauged the entrire world, and a group of individuals are left to deal with the aftermath.  Desolate, dark and almost devoid of any real humor, 28 Days Later is a psychologically shattering film that will have an impact on you if you think about the reality of it all.

The only thing I enjoyed about this horribly filmed and acted movie was when the damn thing ended. I cannot tell anyone what to think nor do I imagine my opinion matters. I just strongly advise anyone to borrow or rent it before spending good money on it! In parting here is a thought, I own over 1000+ DVDs that I have bought over the last 5 years.

Lowpoints: Too much zombies, too little subliminal terror at times; Megan Burns as the little girl is a truly terrible performance that fortuitously doesn't bring the film down.
Conclusion: An unflinching, metaphorical look at the possible loss of control over rage amongst humans, 28 Days Later marks Danny Boyle's comeback from his flop The Beach. Petrifying with its realism and astounding in its contrastive moods, 28 Days Later definitely has more in common with the director's dark masterpiece Trainspotting - it is scary, droll and compelling, and will linger with its audience, despite its flaws, long after the ending.

1542275,5,B00005JMA8,"Directed by the director of _Trainspotting_, the movie _28 Days Later_ examines the apocalyptic question in London, England.  A plague has just wiped out the city (and apparently most of the world) and the few remaining citizens are infested with the disease - rage, turning them into mindless raging zombies.  The protagonist wakes up to this horror in the hospital and he must join up with a band of few remaining survivors to try to survive in the nightmare that remains of the modern world.  Together they set out to meet a camp of soldiers who have broadcasted over the radio from Manchester, alleging a cure for ""rage"" and a new beginning.  Along the way they lose some trusted companions, who become infested with rage through the blood.  However, once they arrive at the camp they discover things are not to their liking.  Apparently, the soldiers possess a fortified unit to keep out the raving populace; however, there is no available cure.  In addition, most of the men are mad with lust and decide to keep the new women arrivals while jettisoning the only surviving male.  It is after being thrown out of their fortified citadel that the protagonist decides to seek his revenge - managing to slaughter all the soldiers in a fury.  _28 Days Later_ is a disturbing thinking- man's type movie which will appeal to those who dare to face the apocalypse head-on.  In a world of mass disease, famine, and anthrax scares, a movie about raging zombies is not too far off.  Indeed, it becomes apparent after watching this movie that no truer statement of human nature was ever expressed than this ""Homo homini lupus (Man is wolf to man)"".",1068681600,,1641,4.742957746478873

1542326,3,B00005JMA8,"28 DAYS  LATER continues the cinematic tradition of judgment day via zombies and, for the majority of the screen time, succeeds in the communication of its essential thesis: the momentum of society has been reset to a far earlier setting, and the instincts of the gut and the primordial parts of the brain have seized all functions of  the unquestionably unlucky survivors.  Director Danny Boyle presents a bleak and somber story of the aftereffects of a terrible plague which infects most of the population of Great Britain, peppering the gory Grand Guignol with surprisingly fascinating bouts of introspection into the human condition; at times, it seems like a spec script written by the Grim Reaper.  Although uneven in tone and execution- and perhaps a bit of a deviation from what its marketing seemed to promise- the film does nevertheless invoke a few moments of intelligence and wit.
We begin with a prologue as quick as an electron jumping into a higher orbital level; it seems as if a group of animal activists intend on righting the wrongs visited upon a collection of simians at a secret governmental laboratory.  The chimps are imprisoned in squat, claustrophobic transparent chambers, and our hearts go out to them- we long for their release and a subsequent end to the torturous medical experiments that are most assuredly the source of their pain and suffering.  Good deeds, however, are sometimes the source of inestimably hideous mistakes...these particular monkeys carry a plague whose particles probably serve as platelets for the Devil's bloodstream: the rage virus.  In no time at all, one of the activists is infected, and the distribution of the killer disease begins, viciously efficient and hellishly unstoppable.
Twenty-eight days later, a survivor- Jim- awakens in a deserted hospital, unaware of the apocalyptic chaos unleashed upon his country.  In quick order, he learns that something terrible has happened when he is attacked by a priest in a corpse-saturated church.  From there, he meets up with a couple of healthy people and begins a journey which will eventually take him and his party to a military sanctuary which may or may not hold the answer to the horrific plight.
28 Days is a visceral exercise, both in terms of visual realization and philosophical discourse.  That's not to say that there any lectures of significant length contained within the scenes (although such indulgences wouldn't have been necessarily unwelcome); instead, bits and pieces of ideas and questions relating to countless aspects of the human condition shine through if one is so inclined.  For instance, how would you react if you were thrust into such a Twilight-Zone scenario?  Would any means of survival immediately justify itself?  Would survival be worth pursuing at all?  What is the true essence of a human being; do we find it when desperation has been substituted for comfort by removing most technological and bureaucratic amenities?  And, most disturbingly: is the virus merely a remover of superficial masks?
The film is also a template of allegory, especially relating to the concept of man versus the invisible armies of nature.  Germs and their associated death-hastening effects are the true Jason Voorheeses/Freddy Kruegers that society has to deal with- not only is it immensely difficult to stop the more prodigious varieties, but everytime we do, still, they come back, more powerful than before, in sequel after sequel after sequel (or, maybe strain after strain might be better terminology).  Lunatic pieces of nucleic acid called ebola test the fabric of human life...outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome fill us with fear and can cause financial markets to experience panic-attack selloffs.  They may not be as fast as the rage disease, but they are nonetheless equally as scary.
One interesting note should be made on the intrinsic historical influences exhibited by Boyle's project: without a doubt, the celluloid spirit of George A. Romero is standing off to the side in a majority of the frames, sort of a guardian ghost, a protector of the genre being sampled- a genre he pretty much created.  Although the term ""zombie"" was used earlier, it would be careless not to acknowledge that, from a purely technical standpoint, the film featured not one member of the walking dead army- sick, afflicted personages who stay expired once put in such a state obviously do not qualify.  That's the clinical, categorical analysis however; from a more symptomatic angle, there isn't much difference between Romero's radiation-poisoned nemeses and Boyle's bad-blooded victims (except for velocity, of course).  Put another way, mass cannibalistic insanity boils down to the same thing.  Another debt the film owes a mention to is ""The Last Man On Earth"", starring Vincent Price (which would see a second coming as The Omega Man, with Charlton Heston).  In fact, both of these films were based on the book ""I Am Legend"", by Richard Matheson, which Romero has cited as inspiration for ""Night Of The Living Dead"".
28 DAYS LATER is about both life and death...but mostly death.  It has the heart of an arthouse film and the skin of a major-studio release.  It is not perfect; it is entertaining, but it did not invent any new wheels (or any new spokes, for that matter).  It has a House-Of-1000-Corpses attitude but it achieves a richer plateau of plot and characterization.  If you like your zombies famished and feral, take a look...",1068422400,,5476,5.103023516237402

Insights should arise from the characters and story.  The character and story should not be used to force insights down the audiences throat.  We know that zombies aren't necessaily worse than people after we see 28 Days Later, because Danny Boyle has been jamming that idea down our throats for two hours.
I gave the movie two stars instead of zero mostly because of the way the movie was shot.  The distorted frames, the views of an abandoned London were all visually interesting.  Ultimately, though, the movie is a failure.  A contrived plot with a corny, phony script contribute to a moviegoing experience that is not that scary and leaves a bad taste in one's mouth.",1068422400,3,935,4.590361445783133

""28 Days Later"" could have been the screen equivalent of Stephen King's ""The Stand,"" or at least as suspenseful and scientifically relevant as any of Richard Preston's novels (The Hot Zone, The Cobra Event), but it kind of settles for cheap thrills.
The movie just isn't very ambitious. There are some brilliant moments -- the opening sequence, with the lone survivor of the plague wandering forlorn through London -- and there are several suspenseful scenes. But it doesn't do much with the material, which is ripe for good cinematic treatment.
The direction is for the most part solid but sort of calls too much attention to itself, as if Danny Boyle were saying, ""Look at how cutting-edge I can be."" I realize this is low-budget fare, but I'd rather have a cohesive story with characters that I care about than a lot of flash and a lot of mind-numbing quick-cuts.

WOW!!  There is No way anyone can ever compare this movie to The exorcist. Anyway I went to see this movie with a neutral state of Mind. I wasn't expecting the best movie ever and I wasn't expecting the worst.
So the movie begins and for the first 5 - 10 minutes the movie is off to a good start. (Except for the music being played while he walks down the empty streets) and also, {all the camera shots are done on a tripod it gets really annoying and believe this, it isn't original or innovative!!!
So everthing is going pretty well until...
he meets the fellow survivors. From here the movie goes into a downward spiral in which nothing helps it ascend.
Every scene after this is awfully drawn out(think Matrix reloaded party/sex scene, except with dialogue and no sex or dancing) The more characters they bring on, the worse the movie gets. And then if things couldn't get worse we are introduced to some soldiers who instead of helping the main characters they become their enemies.
So the story all of sudden moves from being about an empty
and dead ""world"" to being about ""bad soldiers""
Such a good premise thrown into the trash, what a SHAME..
But I still had hope ... hope in that the ending had to be good..
And of course it was, quite possibly, the worst ending to a movie I have ever seen. And if you don't believe me then why did they come out with a new ending only weeks after it's release?? This of course angered me even more, because they couldn't get it right the first time!
I wasn't the only one who hated this movie... This was the first movie in which HALF the people in the theatre walked out HALF WAY through the Movie!!
With all the hype, this movie was very dissapointing. The Blair witch was hyped like crazy too, but that was an innovative movie and a lot scarier. TRUST ME!!

First the obvious; 28 Days Later borrows from many sources. It's not so much a horror movie but a character study of people in a horrifying situation. 28 Days Later has much more in common with Hitchcock than (Tobe)Hooper. Danny Boyle focuses much more on character and the eerie situation the characters find themselves in more than the thrills and chills of Resident Evil. That's one of the strengths of this fine film. While it may ape Night of the Living Dead (the prototype for all these films), Boyle makes 28 Days Later worthwhile by focusing on how the characters adjust to their horrible situation.

Jim wakes up in the hosptial after a biking accident. What's frightening is that he wakes up in a completely deserted building and, from all appearences, city. London is as quiet as a field mouse with no moving traffic and, more importantly, no signs of human life. He quickly discovers that a plague of some sort has broken out and that the uninfected residents were evacuated.

He arrives at a church and goes inside. The church is filled with human bodies. Hoping that there might be someone alive in the building he calls out. Two of the ""dead"" bodies rapidly raise their heads staring right at him. More of the bodies stir. As Jim attempts to leave, he's confronted by a priest who clearly is suffering from the plague. He escapes but is being pursued by the walking dead. Suddenly, he's saved by two masked people who fight off the ""Zombies"" by burning them and, ultimately, blowing up the gas station where they've converged.

Boyle manages to elicit moving performances from his young cast and captures all the torment, fear and sense of dread the survivors feel as they relate stories to each other about what has happened to them.

The DVD includes three alternate endings (one of them in storyboard form with narration by the writer and director). One of the film's variations includes a completely different second half to the film (again, it's in storyboard form). This radical departure from the film's theatrical version is very interesting and suggests a completely different, darker film than what was ultimately shown in theaters. It's not surprising that they didn't film it (they had some narrative issues) as this version would have been a complete downer and the film wouldn probably not done as well at the box office as it did otherwise. It also feels a bit unnatural after having viewed the film's actual narrative course.

The internet trailer, theatrical teaser and trailer (the latter two basically identical)and audio commentary by director and writer give a unique perspective to the viewer; it feels almost as if one has been working on the film.

The DVD transfer looks very good considering that the film was originally shot on standard definition digital video and transferred to film. The sound -- both the effects and the soundtrack itself chillingly come to life on the DVD. While 28 Days Later is a horror movie it's not just slash and burn horror movie. It's a film with heart and, ultimately, more in the tradition of great horror films that examine how the characters cope with the horrible things they witness as the horrible things seen.",1068163200,,3559,4.805555555555555
1542397,5,B00005JMA8,"The images in this film fly at you like snow in a blizzard.  The camera angles are clever and effective at including you in the horror of what is being said and done and at the same time is mind-numbing due to the intense graphic overload...its like Satan showing you a slideshow...little snapshots of hell.
In its slower moments we get too close to the ""infected"", those infected by the Rage virus, which turns these moments into a feel-sorry-for-these-zombies movie.  I would have preferred having seen them in only the glimpses and snatches we are given in the rest of the movie to keep them inhuman and frightening. I also felt the ""Mars Needs Women"" part of the film, where we learn the real reason why the shortwave broadcast was made by the soilders weakened the film but it made a nice set-up for the ""our hero gone bullistic"" payback scenes. (I had this strange feeling I was watching a remake of Apocalypse Now where Martin Sheen went on his sweaty, half-naked, grease-painted mission of death).
The film itself I rated 4 stars but gave it that extra star after I discovered that this whole beautifully executed film was made on an extremely low budget.  Only someone with real vision and intelligence could do so much with so little.

It also addresses genuine (& realistic) fears in the modern world about a pandemic wiping out the world's population following 9/11. The manifestation of the disease as a zombie-creating evil is inconsequential & shouldn't be looked on as the most important aspect of the film. There are too many themes to go into here.
The start of the film is breathtaking & creeped me out for weeks, the shots of deserted London streets & the M6 motorway completely deserted are genuinely disturbing. The fact that this film is set in the UK as opposed to the US makes it even more freaky.

1542471,4,B00005JMA8,"A really close friend of mine recommended that I see 28 DAYS LATER. I highly respect his taste in film and the first opportunity I had of watching the film after it arrived on DVD, I rented it. I enjoyed what I saw, though it wasn't quite like I was expecting.

From the previews and trailers and even reading the blurb on the back of the package, one would think that 28 DAYS LATER is going to be a horrifying masterpiece of terror. Unfortunately, except for an unexpected car alarm that goes off in the middle of London, there really isn't anything too frightening about the film. Instead, the movie is basically a hodge-podge homage to the zombie films of the past that offers hope about the state of humanity.

The plot of the film is rather simple. A psychological virus first tested on monkeys is accidently unleashed in Great Britain. It is a highly contagious disease that is passed through the blood and other bodily fluids, changing humans into wild carnivorous beasts that eat raw flesh. The main character of the film, Jim, awakens alone in a hospital bed 28 days after the virus was first unleashed. He wonders through the empty streets of London and eventually meets up with a couple of other survivors who are uninfected. They eventually meet up with a couple of other survivors and in the hopes of meeting other survivors head to a location where a cure to the disease supposedly exists. The people broadcasting the signal are a group of soldiers loyal to their commanding officer. They have a cure, but it's not quite what Jim and the others expect.

For a zombie movie, 28 DAYS LATER really isn't that gory. There really isn't much blood shown. In fact, outside of some foul language and a little violence, the movie is relatively tame. Some will be frightened by the zombies (basically a person's eyes turn red and blood drips out of their mouth) more because of the way the movie is filmed. However, more frightening is the nature of the soldiers and the questions they raise about our own humanity. The philosophical and psychological questions that are raised after encountering this band of modern marauders is more chilling than any physical violence caused by the infected.

As mentioned earlier, 28 DAYS LATER is a homage to zombie movies of the past. I couldn't help but be reminded of THE OMEGA MAN and DAY OF THE DEAD while watching this film. Influences from 12 MONKEYS to EVIL DEAD can be seen in the movie along with several others.

Overall, 28 DAYS LATER is a fairly enjoyable movie that's not to scary to watch. My favorite part in the film were the scenes filmed in the empty streets of London and the scene right before Jim is supposed to be executed and he learns the secret of the disease. The alternate endings that accompany the DVD are interesting to watch and the commentary is quite informative. A decent film from one of the UK's more interesting directors.",1067904000,,2902,4.649122807017544
1542472,1,B00005JMA8,"I've seen this movie before, in several different versions.  It starts out as ""12 Monkeys"" then transforms into ""The Quiet Earth"" and finally ends as ""Day of the Dead.""  In fact, the entire movie is a patchwork of previous, more coherent reflections on the apocalypse.  The stroylines, scenes, even characters are lifted directly from other apoacalyptic movies.  Even the use of unknown actors has been done previously to achieve  the illusion of ordinariness/reality.  Presumably, when you don't see celebrities you think ""gee, this could be me and this could really happen!""
""28 Days Later"" is another example of patent forgery, or should I say ""homage,"" to hit the screens and lift our hard-earned money.  The marketing strategy warrants praise for boldly inflating the movie into a phenomenon, transforming a sampled set of imagery into ""the scariest movie since the Exorcist.""  The storyline, pitting survivors against the ""infected"" as well as against one another, is the basis of virtually every zombie movie out there, beginning with ""Night of the Living Dead.""  In fact, if it wasn't for George Romero's Dead series, this and other movie of its ilk would never have been imagined.  Even the exploration of sociopolitical issues, such as the global economy, medical ethics, and race relations have been plumbed in other movies repeatedly and more effectively.  That goes for the attempts at humor as well.  None of the scenes, characters, plot points, or themes in ""28 Days"" have any original essence.  In fact, the filmmakers hardly tried to veil their rehashed version of others' works.  Their use of digital film is about the only new twist in an old drink.  It doesn't help.
The DVD has ""alternate endings"" further validating the sampled (aka plagiarized) origins of this movie.  The hero is killed ala ""Omega Man."" The hero survives to lead a bittersweet existence ala ""Planet of the Apes.""  But we could place our own endings in also: the hero dreamt the end of the world or had a psychotic break with reality or there was a momentary shift in the space-time continuum transporting him into another dimension.  Who cares? 28 days later, you'll be wondering what the big deal was all about anyway.",1067817600,6,2210,5.008219178082192

After a frantic search, he meets to survivors.  Occasionally, they come across one of the undead and must kill them or else they stand to become infected themselves.

Pick up a book and read, you'll find plenty of books like this that are much better than this movie.  The beginning is great, I do have to give the writer and director credit cause it really sets up the tone of the movie, your almost on edge waiting for something to happen.  But then as it goes along all it does is get more and more disappointing, and that's a shame cause it had so much potential.  This film is no 'Night of the living Dead' and you almost wish it was cause at least you'd actually be scared instead of sighing and waiting for another flash of the zombies, and that's all you really get are flashes, there's no real interaction with the infected and uninfected. The movie would have been much better if it were 'Night of the living dead apocalypse style' maybe if they had them fighting the zombies more and didn't have that whole ""Military"" thing going on half way in it would have been an improvement.  The alternative endings were okay but I doubt it could have improved the movie, face it the trailers were more scarier than this film.  The whole movie just started to plain suck after the beginning to be honest and I wondered if the real title of this movie was 28 days of boredom cause after watching it you feel as if 28 days have been sucked out of your life.

The the last third at a miltary camp gets more unfocused, weirdly brutal and just strange.  In fact the last third reminded me of a really bad horror film I had seen in the eighties.  The film poses some great questions about morality, loyality, science ... but the last third, for me, really diminsihed what started out as a much more powerful film.",1067644800,,688,4.636363636363637

The first third, where Jim wanders around an empty London, borrows heavily from ""The Omega Man"" -- which in turn borrowed from ""The World, The Flesh and The Devil.""
The middle feels a lot like the midsection of ""The Stand"" -- complete with the drive through a dark tunnel.  And the final third is like a hyped-up version of the ""Living Dead"" movies, with ""the infected"" running amok.
If you haven't seen any of the movies I mention here you'll probably find ""28 Days Later"" more gripping than I did.  And if you HAVE seen them, you can play ""spot the borrowed reference"" as you go along.  Worth watching, but not in the same class as its predecessors.",1067644800,,872,4.452830188679245
1542538,5,B00005JMA8,"It's very difficult to make a horror film today; audiences are inured to violence and bloodshed, and computer effects have made the exceptional seem mundane.  Moreover, most movies in this genre are horribly derivative, stealing from their predecessors rather than paying homage.  Happily, neither of these things are true of ""28 Days Later"" a film which actually transcends the genre in which it is classified.
The premise is a familiar one, a terrible plague sweeps through England, leaving the survivors to come to grips with a drastically altered world.  However, from the beginning, """"28 Days Later"" defies convention.  The film opens with animal rights activists ignoring the warnings of a researcher that his chimp subjects are infected with ""rage"" and liberating the animals.  It quickly becomes clear when the first chimp is released that there is something drastically wrong.  The next shot, however, is twenty-eight days later, which finds the main character, Jim, coming out of a coma in a locked hospital room.  Thus, the viewer, like Jim, is thrown into an abruptly and mysteriously empty landscape.
As Jim travels a deserted London, the viewer is treated to a series of remarkable images: piles of money blowing around, cars abandoned in the middle of intersections, newspapers proclaiming disaster, and most poignantly, a message board clearly inspired by those that appeared around the WTC following 9/11.  However, it is Jim's first encounter with another living person that defines this movie.  Jim, understandably wanders into a church, where he encounters a deranged priest, who within seconds he is forced to bludgeon.  Thus, from the very beginning, the director, Danny Boyle, shows that social convention is abandoned in his world; if a priest can become a source of danger, no one is safe.
The other compelling aspect of this encounter is the illustration of what this rage disease does to its victims.  Essentially, it turns them into zombies, intent on mayhem and destruction.  However, unlike zombies of the past, these movie creations are terrifyingly fast and lethal, rather than lumbering and vaguely befuddled.  Thus, as Jim encounters other survivors, and they set out in the hope of safety at a military base, they are haunted by fellow humans, infected with the absolute worst in our human nature.
To say more would spoil the plot, but the film offers a host interesting elements to consider.  First off, the actors are relative unkowns, so there is an ""everyman"" quality about the characters that is immensely compelling.  They aren't brilliant scientists or ex-commandos, just everyday people struggling to survive in a world gone mad.  The core characters are the aforementioned Jim, Selena, Frank, and Frank's daughter Hannah.  The only actor that would be readily recognizable to most people would be Brendan Gleeson, who played Hamish in ""Braveheart"", who does a superb job as Frank in this film.
The range of emotions and issues that these characters deal with is daunting.  Aside from mere survival (which is all the more treacherous due to the absence of firearms in Britain), they face survivor's guilt, and a world in which they must kill infected priests, children and even friends.  Even more compelling, however, is another nod to the post-9/11 world: what happens when in fighting the enemy we take on their worst characteristics.  Is survival an end unto itself, or does their need to be something more?
In drawing on these themes Boyle and screenplay writer Alex Garland, have drawn from numerous influences.  Matheson's ""I Am Legend"" is apparent in a world where normal humans have become the minority and must kill the new majority to survive.  There is also a tunnel scene that is strongly reminiscent of Larry Underwood's escape from Manhattan in King's ""The Stand"".  Furthermore, the conclusion of the films looks to have been strongly influenced by Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"" in general, and Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now"" specifically.  Finally, the conclusion also puts me in mind of the end of Burgess' ""A Clockwork Orange""; although very different in terms so setting and scene, both speak to the short, albeit brutal, lifespan of rage.  All that said, I should emphasize that these influences are never ripped off or copied.  Rather, in the finest artistic tradition, they are acknowledged as influences and then modified into something new.
With all this drama and tension, one might suspect that ""28 Days Later"" is unbearably serious, but nothing could be further from the truth.  The comic relief is appropriate, timely and intelligent.  In particular, there is one scene inside a grocery store that had me laughing out loud.
Technically, the disc is superb.  The film was shot using digital camcorders, so it's never going to have the resolution of a traditional release, and above and beyond that fact, some shots have been left deliberately grainy so as to produce a nostalgic effect.  That said, the picture looks as good or better than when I saw the film in a theater.  The sound is also excellent and is used effectively throughout the film.  Like ""The Exorcist"" much of the movie is shown without a soundtrack, so when music is present, it heightens the tension immeasurably.
The disc also includes an excellent selection of extra features.  There are three alternate endings, two of which were filmed and one which was storyboarded and then narrated by Garland and Boyle.  There are also several deleted scenes, all of which feature excellent commentary from Garland and Boyle.  Finally, there is an interesting making of documentary; in addition to the usual interview with cast and crew, it offers some insight into the nature of infectious disease, and comments on the possibility of a ""28 Days Later"" type scenario actually occurring.
""28 Days Later"" is a film of remarkable power, even as it offers a unique horror/post-apocalyptic tale, it explores our humanity and our deepest fears at the dawn of the twenty-first century.  It is the rare film that lives up to its hype and is not to be missed.

1542541,5,B00005JMA8,"In case you didn't know, this movie is about a lethal virus called rage (makes the person infected in a constant state of savage anger) that has basically obliterates England and only few are left uninfected.
I am not usually scared by movies. Sure, Ill jump here and there at a loud sound or sudden scary image, but in general, I tend not to check the backseat of my car, nor look under my bed and in my closet at night. While watching this film, I wasn't too overly scared, but there were a few good frights and shocks. However, behind the all the horror a look into human behavior and the subconscious was being presented. In the end, I found this the most intriguing and preserving quality of the film. But first things first...
The cinemetography is breathtaking. From the astonishing shots of a deserted London set against the hazy sky, to the beautiful English landscape with the rows of flowers and endless miles of green, I was definitely captivated. Most of the film was shot with a digital camcorder, as well, providing an extremely effective gritty feeling to the movie. Some parts almost looked like a documentary, making various scenes pretty creepy, kind of like the poor film quality that made the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre so horrific (it could have been a cannibal's home videos).
The acting I thought was also very well done, although I have never heard of a majority of the talent showcased here.
Now, onto the reason why this movie is just that good...
Each of our four road trip passengers represented a different human emotion, therefore representing a different goal and solution.
Selena, for example, was very cold, cared only about surviving, and showed little feeling. Frank gave us the laughs in tough times, along with the fatherly care and guidance. Jim obeyed the laws and believed there was always hope and loved the comfort of others. Hannah provided the logic in the times of erratic behavior and self doubt. Most of the soldiers represented the need for an immediate solution and a future thanks to the arrival of women, since rebuilding a decimated country requires people.
Conflict is inevitable, especially when everyone is trying to survive.
Every character occured a personal change in this movie, and many were subtle but all were important. Selena showed a great deal of emotion and motherly love toward Hannah, which caused her to lose some of her original tough-as-nails disposition. She develops a little thing for Jim, too, but that was expected. The extended ending showed she still had a strong side, though. Frank lost his temper and his hope at a time when it was needed. Hannah toughend up, like when she picked up the gun and exited down the hall in the extended ending (the better one, too), probably because she looked up to Selena. The most vivd transformation, however, was by our bicycle boy Jim. He originally spoke of there always being a government and a law, but he ended up taking both into his hands with brutal results by the film's ending. Jim's actions also illustrated the selfish actions of humans and how we put ourselves before society, the great lengths we will go to for the ones we love, and the shot in the arm a small shred of hope can bring.
I know a lot of viewers expected a super scary and frightening movie since it was marketed as one, and Im sure they were a bit disappointed, but looking at the film from a different angle really brings out its true beauty behind those blood red eyes.

1542542,3,B00005JMA8,"A group of animal rights activists unleash a deadly virus when they attempt to free infected chimpanzees from a primate research facility. 28 days later, Jimmy (Cillian Murphy) awakes in his hospital bed to find himself alone. The entire city of London seems at first to be deserted. Unfortunately, it hasn't been entirely abandoned: most of the remaining population are infected humans whom the virus has transformed into homicidal maniacs in a constant state of rage. Jimmy encounters a few remaining sane individuals: Selena (Naomie Harris), a fiercely independent woman who won't hesitate to do anything that might enable her to survive, and Frank (Brendan Gleeson) and his daughter Hannah (Megan Burns), whose close relationship has given them a less cynical outlook. Together they set out to find the source of a continual radio broadcast, hoping they will find safety and other uninfected humans. But as the saying goes, you should be careful what you wish for.

""28 Days Later"" is not so much a horror movie in the traditional sense as it is a gruesome philosophical drama. There is a lot of slaughter and a great deal of blood. There is only one scene that I found disturbingly violent, but the film is grisly enough to merit a warning that  sensitive persons should avoid it. Blood and guts don't actually seem to be the point of the film, though. It's about the rage that dwells within human beings, and it's a philosophical treatise on the nature of violence. Balancing the obligations of a horror film with those of a broad social commentary is challenging, and I don't think that ""28 Days Later"" quite succeeds. I found the philosophical aspect of the film to be ridiculously simplistic. And I don't think that it creates enough suspense to be a great horror film. ""28 Days Later"" was shot on digital video to conserve time and money, and it looks it. It's ugly, but that's suitable to the gritty environments in which the story takes place. In conclusion, ""28 Days Later"" gives the audience a little horror, a little philosophy, and a lot of blood. It isn't bad, but there isn't enough to recommend it either.

The DVD: You can choose English or Spanish subtitles. Bonus features include: deleted scenes; a ""making of"" documentary featuring interviews with the cast, director Danny Boyle, and some paranoid talk about pandemics; a gallery of still photographs, with commentary, taken by the film's still photographer, many of which are quite good; a gallery of Polaroids taken during production for continuity purposes; theatrical trailers; animated storyboards from the film's UK website; and a music video. I recommend the still photograph gallery.",1067472000,12,2665,4.997747747747748

It was fun to really be startled and scared again while watching a movie. The camera motion, when the zombies are attacking, is nothing short of brilliant(strobe). It's one of the best concepts of a zombie type movie I've seen yet. After seeing this, you'll wonder why they haven't thought of it sooner(fast zombies, not that's scary). A+ all the way and a must if you like to jump out of your seat in fright. BELIEVE ME, YOU WILL JUMP!",1067472000,,599,4.3097345132743365
1542544,4,B00005JMA8,"Rage. It affects many a singularity in the whole, passing through the social body with so many a cataclysmic repercussion. Many of the worst times in history are cast in its dye, and many of the things we fear are byproducts of the tongue it universally speaks. So, if rage were to pass through society like a virus, want would the effect be? And what would happen if you were one of the unlucky ones that didn't have the grace to bow out before the world went mad?
28 Days Later is a story about just that, picking up with its main character 28 days after the initial onset of this epidemic hits the world at large. Unlike many movies of its zombie-like type, it is also set in a different realm of interaction, within Britain, and that has some ramifications with regard to the outcome of the movie. For instance, there is no outlet to go to and to procure weaponry of the higher velocity, user friendly, type, with people instead having to opt for blunt weapons, machetes, and iron showings of will. The characters are different that the ""norm"" as well, with those souls not exactly conforming to rigid horror stereotypes that have plagued the genre in the past. This, in turn, sets the stage for something that erupts well initially and seems to say that it will have many a thing to add to the fold. Fear, blood, violence, and shock come out of the woodworks, and that makes a tale that seems like it will be promising. But then, just when things seem to be going somewhere, the task of telling goes into a tailspin and emerges in a mundane realm that has been so many times done before. The story actually forces itself into completion and it strays, adding in soldiers and some subversive storyline while taking away from the horror and disappointing someone expecting what was touted by the makers - a movie that was, in a word, frightful.
This isn't to say that the movie has nothing to offer, because it does give something back. It has some gore, a nice look at a menace that is somewhat like the overused zombie but that is fast and angry instead of slow and brutish, and it picks up in the middle of the problem instead of at the beginning. This gives the viewer a different perspective of the woe manifesting and, in some rights, this would have been fine. The downside to this is that it becomes a human drama in the end, actually leaving out the menace of the rage-infected except for a slow trickling that is, in effect, dull. Sure, excuses have been made that it was trying to make a point, but couldn't that point have appeased the mind with the overuse of horror instead of becoming its skinny, underloved brother?
To add to this, the DVD touts three alternate endings that will ""blow your socks off,"" but that advertisement is egregiously deceptive. Two of the ending only have to do with shuffling who lives and dies, and the third, the radical changes, aren't really ""shown"" to the viewer at all. They are instead ideas that erupted in the middle of making the film and they weren't processed passed the storyboard phase. So, ironically, the best way the movie could have gone, with the bad part of the movie actually removed, is further accented by ""the story that could have been"" told to you as if you were reading a book.",1067385600,6,3248,4.5067796610169495
1542545,4,B00005JMA8,"The plot of the British Science-Fiction/Horror movie 28 DAYS LATER is not totally original: In the wake of an apocalyptic biological disaster, a handful of uninfected survivors struggle to stay alive as they fight against both monstrous plague victims and an unscrupulous and aggressive military enclave.  Indeed, it would not be totally inaccurate to describe this movie as THE OMEGA MAN meets NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD.  But unlike its venerable predecessors, 28 DAYS LATER projects such stark honesty and austere realism that it plays with an almost documentary-like believability.  The ending is a little more upbeat and mawkish than the previous films--at least the original theatrical ending is; the DVD offers multiple alternate endings, not all of which are happy ones--but overall, 28 DAYS LATER is a much more plausible and satisfying movie.
Part of the quality of realism in this movie comes straight from the performances. All of the principal actors, while not enormously famous, are first-rate craftsmen, and they create characters that are true reflections of real-world people who just happen to be in a nightmarish situation.  In other words, we recognize these characters as either reflections of ourselves or as portraits of our friends and neighbors, and we therefore identify with their feelings, actions, and reactions.  Of course, it also helps that the lines these characters speak ring true.  The script is very literate and well researched--in one of the extra features on the DVD, the director and screenwriter talk with some of the scientists, politicians, and sociologists that they interviewed as they developed and refined the story's devastating ""plague""--and screenwriter/novelist Alex Garland is masterful at converting ideas into real-world dialogue.
Arguably the foremost reason that 28 DAYS LATER plays in such an honest and believable manner is the fact that it was shot totally in digital video.  The use of digital video has become quite common for shooting television news stories and TV documentaries, and consequently, the quality of digital color saturation and digital's subliminal image pixellation have become associated with real-life events in the public subconscious.  Add to that the relative ease with which digital images can be manipulated and the seamless way in which digital FX can be inserted, and you have the perfect tools for making a fictional story FEEL like non-fiction.
No doubt ardent fans of both Science Fiction and Horror will want to add this DVD to their collections.  But the script, acting, and overall production values of 28 DAYS LATER are top-notch, and since the gore level and technobabble factors are relatively low, members of any filmgoing demographic will find this movie quite satisfying.",1067385600,2,2770,5.349425287356322
1542546,2,B00005JMA8,"I'm not sure why this movie did so well in theaters.  Perhaps this was more of an indication of a hunger for movies that are not remakes of older movies/comic books/tv shows than of this movie's quality.  But this movie has nothing new to offer and is a typical doomsday flick with a little zombie action thrown in for thrills.  It is based on the silly premise that the ""rage"" virus is transmitted through body fluids and within 10-20 seconds turns the infected person into a violent maniac.  Of course, the infected are not so violent that they can't act together in chasing down and killing the noninfected.  Its funny how they never attack each other-how convenient.  Many others have stated that this movie is scary, but it is not.  In fact it is quite boring and the cheap scares are entirely predictable and cliched.  There is really not enough substance to justify a full-length movie.  Really, how long does it take to tell us about a few people driving across England to meet up with other survivors?  The story is stretched out and seems like it was written while shooting, which is further confirmed by the 3 different endings presented on the DVD.  Much like the Blair Witch Project, this movie is unpolished, and rather dull.  The only positive is that the acting was well done.  I would not bother seeing this flick.",1067385600,3,1331,4.636752136752137

After a very boring first 20 minutes I thought that I'd give the movie a few more minutes to pick up. Sadly it didn't pick up enough to hold my attention. I thought the film would have been right up my alley because I love zombie/horror, but it just seemed to take itself way to serious for it's own good. And it's not really a horror film at all. A few chase scenes and some bloody vomit doesn't mean you have a horror film. All and all the biggest problem was that it was overwelmingly dull. 1 star for the chic that hacked up that dude who became infected.",1067299200,7,638,4.195121951219512
1542571,5,B00005JMA8,"This movie is thoroughly thought provoking and disturbing.  If copious amounts of blood and guts is the sort of distraction that is 'Scary' to you, rent Cabin Fever or rubbish of that ilk. The sparing use of gore throughout actually adds to the film. In addition, the way it was shot (with a digital camera) adds to the gritty and dark ambiance. As such, this fine movie is as much a psycholical thriller as it is a horror movie.
The -Scariest Movie Ever- it was not but then again, what a great marketing draw aimed at getting gen y-ers in the seats.  In addition, I am not surprised the term 'boring' was encountered in other reviews of this film.  It is a term frequently used these days by those that would rather be playing x-box or going to the next scream sequel.
Furthermore, this is not a 'zombie' flick nor does it claim to be.  Therefore, there will be no eating of brains or the reciting of ancient curses.  The actual premise of the film, to me, is much more believable: a biological weapons or medical experiment gone awry.
Highlights include 1) the protagonist finding his parents and 2) the unsettling resolution after a member of the group is believed to have been infected.",1067299200,,1191,4.546728971962617
1542572,1,B00005JMA8,"Okay.. all the folks who panned the original Blair Witch Project now have a new, and in my opinion, far worthier target for their disdain. To its credit (whether you liked it or not) BWP doesn't try to be any more than it is... a low budget film with no real script and pretty much unknown actors.
Sadly, 28 Days Later is exactly the same thing, only it was promoted as the scariest movie since Exorcist and, otherwise, a ""brilliant and visionary"" film..
Visionary? I think not.
Here's what I saw:
A plot that, as correctly mentioned in other reviews, has been done before, many times and much better. As a side note, a friend told me that 28 Days Later is ""what Resident Evil, the movie, should have been."" After seeing both, I can say that I disagree 120% with that analysis. I don't consider Resident Evil to be the pinnacle of horror movies... but it's *much* better done than 28DL... atleast the zombies actually acted like *zombies*... but I'll get to that. Suffice it to say.. 28 Days Later is, in my opinion, nothing more than another ""me-too"" zombie horror flick with the whole, obligatory ""this is what happens when you mess with Mother Nature"" moral built in.
Scary. Ha!
If a bunch of people wearing orange/red contacts, doused with fake blood who are running around screaming and vomiting up mouths full of more fake blood on their victims, who then - only seconds later - turn into exactly the same blood-spitting screaming and raving lunatic is what you consider scary.. then this movie is for you.
Suspenseful or Disturbing?
The only part that got any kind of an emotional response out of me is when one of the survivors is brutally hacked down by one their own... I chuckled at that.
There were a couple other parts that I could *tell* were engineered to yield an emotional reaction.. they just didn't.
All in all... this is a very weak piece of movie-making that, for me anyway, failed to live up to any of what it promised.",1067299200,4,1941,4.564469914040115
1542573,3,B00005JMA8,"Although there are certainly some tense moments and a few really disquieting scenes, Danny Boyle's 28 HOURS LATER loses something in the end.  Some of the camera work and imaginative editing are really effective; the acting overall is good.  Naomie Harris and Cillian Murphy are very durable in their leading roles; Brendan Glesson and Megan Burns lend fine support as Frank and Hannah.  The movie loses its steam once it hits the soldiers camp and the typical, cliche characters perform in their expected macho madness.  By the time the film reaches it's all too predictable ending, one feels a little left out.  Many reviewers said that this film is not a ""horror"" film; than shame on 20th Century Fox for marketing as the scariest movie ever made.
On the DVD, the deleted scenes show they should have been, and the three alternate endings are worthless, too.  The third one is nothing more than the storyboard with overacting hamminess from director Boyle and screenwriter Gardner.

Set in post apocolyptic Britain, our hero Jim is given the daunting task of surviving in a world where: A: most everyone is dead and B:the survivors are hell bent on killing him. However, he does succeed in meeting some survivors who do not have the intense desire to kill him, and the movie goes from there. For some reason Danny Boyle taps into my personal deep fears of the downfall of society. It attacks your emotional fears instead of relying on an assault of blood and gore. The film has so many underlying themes, it would be a waste to try and describe them all. It was one of the greatest movies I have ever seen.",1067212800,,796,4.385135135135135
1542575,5,B00005JMA8,"It's rare to find a horror movie that is truly unsettling and frightening these days. It's so easy to be jaded by the blood and gore of the Freddy/Jason type slasher films...that when a movie like ""28 Days Later"" comes along, that does indeed have it's share of gore associated with it, but also has an actual intelligent storyline underneath it all, that it's no wonder so many people were excited by it.
The basic premise: a bunch of primates infected with the fictional ""RAGE"" virus are somewhat accidentally released after a break-in at an animal testing facility in England. 28 days later, the cities are all but deserted and in ruins. The movie then follows the progress of a handful of survivors as they search for others who are uninfected. and try to make sense of what exactly has happened.
Going into this, i honestly expected the usual zombie movie...but this is far more then that. The depth of the storyline and the acting by everyone involved is wonderful, and leaves me wondering if some of the people giving this film a terrible review, actually saw the same movie as i did.
There is a twist to this that i will not get into, other then to say it was a brilliant move in steering the film away from a typical ""zombie-fest"". As an avid horror movie fan, i am always thrilled to see a movie go in the less obvious directions, as this one does. the final act of the movie, is actually almost like a completely different film. focusing more on the remaining characters, and their inner relationships, then on running from the monsters. but there are still plenty of monsters...just not in the shape you might have expected.
The director,(the amazing Danny Boyle of ""Trainspotting"" fame), sets a tone of dark, and ominous paranoia early on...as one of the main characters wanders down the deserted streets, finally making his way into a church, and seeing hundreds of dead bodies piled up in front of the alter. And he maintains that sense of dread through-out the film. There is a sequence towards the end of the film that is truly frightening...where one of the characters is on the outside of a house, and sets in motion a chilling series of events, and watches it all unfold, going from window to window. The effect of this scene...thanks to the direction, lighting, and even the music, stays with the viewer long after the film has ended.
The true test of a great horror movie, as with all great movies in general...is that it stays with you long after you've seen it. This is especially true of ""28 Days Later"". it's a film to be watched more then once, to fully appreciate the underlying horror of the story.",1067212800,,2627,4.615384615384615
1542576,5,B00005JMA8,"let me preface this by saying that movies don't generally scare me like this.  there are always too many fantastic elements that make it hard for me to suspend my disbelief (aliens, monsters, ghosts, etc.).  however, the premise for this film, though their were a few plotholes here and there, hit a bit closer to home than other films of this genre.  an outbreak by a dealy virus created by the government is much scarier and believable to me than a spaceship crashing on a planet teaming with hostile aliens (though i enjoy those movies too).  i especially appreciate that the filmmakers realize that it's what you DON'T see that is the most frightening, and resisted making this into a typical zombie gorefest.  this is a great film, and while it is a bit morbid, i think it's ultimately an optimistic film, which is why i wasn't as perturbed by the ending as some other folk seem to have been.
this movie had my grim imagination at work for long afterwards.  standing in crowded supermarket lines or in the cafe at lunch, i'd wonder how long it would take for the infection to spread through the crowd, and how people would react when it did.  maybe that says a bit too much about me.  anyway, they skipped over the first 28 days of infection in the film, and left that to your imagination.
a final thought: selina alludes to news reports (while there still were news reprots) that there were reports of outbreaks in new york and paris.  sequels perhaps?  naaaaa.",1067212800,,1467,4.586206896551724

While the structure of human society is virtually destroyed the survivors must fight against the remaining infected that aim to kill. As the survivors fight for their lives they travel from London to Manchester in hopes of joining a military group who promises an end to the virus. But upon arrival the group realizes that things are not what they seem. Unfortunately, the unfolding of the plot left little to the imagination. I was especially troubled during the scene when the survivors tried to drive through the underground tunnel on their way to Manchester. Anyone who has read THE STAND should well remember the scene of the Lincoln Tunnel in NYC and learn the obvious lesson to not travel in tunnels after an apocalypse, as bodies, vehicles, and unknown creepy things exist in the dark.

1542648,4,B00005JMA8,"This movie has been written off by some as a zombie horror flick. Well that's about 1/4 correct as I see it. It is also great Sci-fi/drama/action-adventure/etc. film. Fortunately most of the critics see it more than that as well. It reminds me of those great low budget films of the early to mid 70s that didn't spend alot of money but got their point across.
The film is centers mainly on one character, Jim (Cillian Murphy). He is one of a handfull of survivors of the release of a deadly ebola type (and apparently human manufactured) virus called rage (inadvertantly released by animal activists trying to save chimps). Jim wakes up from a coma to find his entire world has vanished...almost.
One of the best scenes of the film is watching Jim walk through a deserted London, having no idea what's happened, while the films beggining theme plays in the background.
The virus has apparently affected most of the population, turning them into blood vomitting, raging, ""zombies"" of sorts.
Eventually Jim meets up with 2 other ""survivors"",  Mark and Selena (excellent job by Naomie Harris). From there the idea is to survive and to find other ""survivors"".
I think the moral of the film (if there is one) is how would normal humans (survivors) react to a situation like this as opposed to the infected...and which would be worse to face? you might be surprized to find out.
This film wasn't as scary as I thought it would be but it was also much better than I thought it would be. It is a modern version of all my late 60 early 70 sci-fi favorite apocolyptic films..Planet of the Apes...A Boy and his Dog...Eraserhead...Etc.

What starts out a great update of the 'zombie' idea with some end of the world flavor one eighties into something about as terrrifying and engaging as the undead dance sequence from THRILLER.  It's dissapointing really, the film has an darkened look and feel that would've been great given a better script.  A great modern day, realistic survival/zombie film has yet to be made, because this is not it.  Unsympathetic characters are half of the blame and we've seen them before in dozens of genere films.  I hate watching a movie where the players act in a fashion that no human being would behave.  The old cliche where the lone person goes into the dark, creepy room just to look around has been over-overdone.  I understand a film such as this is already stretching the bounds of reality, however can't one be made that's somewhat realistic?  There a plot points-a-plenty that go unexplained, as well as twists that just didn't work, making for a strangely unexpected second half.  On par with RESIDENT EVIL (the movie, not the video game, which is a far better apocalyptic zombie experience than this), which isn't that good itself.

1542650,5,B00005JMA8,"It is not so much that ""28 Days Later..."" is a classic horror film, but that this 2003 effort is heads and shoulders above the schlock that fans of the genre have had to endure so far this century.  Even when a horror film has a good (""Ghost Ship"") or great (""Jeepers Creepers"") opening, the rest of the film and the payoff end up being disappointing.  The payoff for ""28 Days Later..."" is a debatable element as well, especially when director Danny Boyle offers an alternative theatrical ending as well as an additional ending that basically combines the first two on the DVD.  You will have to decide that offering different endings, one of which you will have to like a lot more than the other, is ultimately a good thing or a bad thing.
The prologue of the film begins with televised images of rioting in the streets, but the main show has not begun yet.  Instead we are watching a chimpanzee that is being subjected to all this media violence in a medical testing facility somewhere in England.  A group of animal activists arrive to document the treatment of the chimps and to set them free, which they do, despite the frantic protests of one of the lab's scientists who explains the animals have been infected with a ""rage"" virus.  Of course the do-gooders do not listen and 28 days later Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes up in a hospital bed from a coma, having been hit by a car, and discovers everybody is gone.
In a series of chilling shots, Jim makes his way through a deserted London, finding only bits and pieces of information in scattered newspapers about a virus that has forced the evacuation of the city.  In a corpse filled church he meets an apparent survivor, but there is clearly something wrong and it is only when Jim is rescued by Selena (Naomie Harris) and Mark (Noah Huntley) that they explain the bad news.  These are, for the purposes of this film, the rules of the game and they are straightforward and simple enough to make this horror film work.
After all, the obvious comparison here is with ""Night of the Living Dead,"" where the dead rose to become flesh-eating zombies because the earth passed through the tail of a comet.  Since minimal direct contact with fluids carrying the virus result in someone becoming ""infected"" in 10-20 seconds, I keep thinking that most of these people are ghouls rather than zombies, but correct categorization is not an imperative here.  Unlike the slow, doddering zombies of George A. Romero's film, the infected are more manic and considerably more violent.  Still, it is impossible to forget that black & white classic, especially when it comes to believing that our small band of heroes are going to get out of this with any of them being alive.
After Mark becomes the obligatory first fatality, making it clear how quickly people turn and that the only way of dealing with it is to kill the infected person P.D.Q., Jim and Selena team up with the unlikely team of cab driver Frank (Brendan Gleeson) and his teenage daughter Hannah (Megan Burns).  Having picked up a repeating radio message that the answer for infection can be found at a military post outside of Manchester (a scene that will remind older viewers of a sub-plot in the film ""On the Beach""), the quartet head out of town to see if they can find other survivors.  Meanwhile, high up in the stratosphere an airliner passes overhead, a sign that the normal world is out there somewhere, but that England is a quarantined land.
The fact that the last part of ""28 Days Later..."" turns into more of an action film strikes some viewers as odd, but the situation is comparable to ""Aliens,"" where you can slaughter dozens of the bad guys because they are not considered human, a free pass to mondo blood-letting and lots of gore in the logic of contemporary movie making.  At the heart of it all is the attempt of the main characters, a family unit forged out of necessity and fear, to keep alive.  Our ability to relate to their situation is what makes this film work, which is why the cast are unfamiliar faces, as in ""The Blair Witch Project.""  The effective rock score by John Murphy and cinematography by Anthony Dod Mantle are other strong elements as well.
For the record, I think the alternative theatrical ending provides the strongest ending.  That version is at least a 4.5 and I round up to make it clear that ""28 Days Later..."" is the top choice for discerning horror film fans who are looking for something that will turn their stomach...in a good way.",1067040000,5,4488,4.618090452261306

The directing in this movie is fantastic, i trully think that Danny Boyle is the next horror director next to Wes Craven and George A. Romero. Pretty long for a zombie movie and a good scare. Some shots were kind of weird like you seen the zombies running up to the house in one scene which takes the scaryness out of it. But nevertheless the shots of deserted London were great and the drive through all of England. The dvd isn't the greatest, the alternate endings are  a waist and the deleted scence are dull.

I have been a long time fan of the Resident Evil franchise - but even I have to admit - this movie far surpasses anything in it's category before it. Sure - the concept is similar: A virus of the blood turns the world into monsters, but these aren't your average zombies. I thought of slow ambling, mindless, flesh eating, rotten fiends. Nope. These are extremely fast moving, focused, rage-filled, fresh and alive humans. The virus ignites uncontrolable, inhuman rage within its host in a matter of 20 seconds or less. So what you have - in effect - is a hyped up zombie on steroids. And their purpose isn't so much to eat flesh as it is to violently murder any non-host in their path. Sound gory? It is. Very graphic, and very real-looking. Remember how Saving Private Ryan was so surreal - how it looked like it was shot on home video cameras - made you feel like you were there? Well this movie is done in a very similar style. It all appears to be organic - none of it feels staged. And the movie is never predicatble - never dull - and it never slows down. From start to finish it is an all out intense gore-feast, tailor made for true horror movie fans. The scenes of the deserted cities are captivating with an absolute feeling of void emptiness. It conveys a solid feeling of hollow unease and panicked desperation. The movie has a real sense of fear in the ""What if this actually happened?"" fashion. Because with all the new viruses we have these days. . . who's to say it couldn't happen? ;-)",1067040000,,1617,4.33993399339934

1542719,5,B00005JMA8,"I enjoyed this movie in the theaters and even more on DVD where one can take the time to think about the many different themes portrayed in this film (whether intended or not, I do not know).  Danny Boyle's vision is more than a reminiscent film on previos zombie horror flicks, but instead a thouhtful film dealing with human emotions, struggels, spirit, and ideals.
Even the villians, the Major and his ""boys"" are seen as people trying to -though morally wrong- survive with a country that has gone to hell.  The major is even portrayed with a solemness that is thought provoking - how does one instill hope in a people who have lost it?  He takes the wrong path as demonstarted in the film by basing everything in the material world (hence killing his metaphysical sergeant).
But what makes this film so strong as to build suspence is the way he crafts the story with the main characters.  We actually begin to feel their plight and want them to succeed.  We just don't want them to live, but begin again and if needed begin civilization again (fornuately they don't need to). All the acting is great as all the characters are rivitingly portrayed.  The developing love story between Jim and Saleena is real and very human.  The character Frank is the most enjoyable and Hanna brings about the innocence that is lost.
Finally, the film, because we do care, is intense. Who will die and who will live?  Will anyone live?  Is life even worth living?  These very human questions are silently asked as our charcters fight to survive.  This is a true horror film that asks fundamental questions about the human species.
One reviewer dislikes the films shooting.  I think the cinematography was purposely shot with this quality level (though that may not change is likeness or dislikeness.)  It brings about a surreal quality that I assert is need for this film to work.  Also, the sountrack is outstanding!  The music is at times reflective and inrospective.

I like how they make the infected people quick and decisive, rather than slow and lumbering. 28 Days wasn't as gory as expected either, but it had it's moments.

1542725,4,B00005JMA8,"Plenty of other reviewers have provided concise plot summaries here, so I'll focus on what I liked, and what I didn't like, about this film.
28 Days Later is an interesting hybrid of post-apocalyptic horror thriller and sociological commentary on the human condition.  What's admirable about the film is that it leaves it up to the viewer's discretion to take away from it what one wants.  If a variation of the classic zombie sub-genre is all you crave (I am aware that they're not actually zombies, but that's effectively their function), that's here for you, with little more asked of the viewer.  On that front alone the film succeeds.  Refreshingly, the zombie sub-genre is recast in a more modern and more plausible plot-vehicle - viral research gone awry (horror buffs can further delight here in another classic horror theme: science turning on its creator - see reviews for ""Frankenstein"").  Gone are the hackneyed means of bringing the zombies into the picture, such as the supernatural or the radiation-getting-into-the-crypt.  Those wanting an exciting combination of the post-apocalyptic, zombie, science-gone-haywire horror film will get it here, no questions asked.
What makes 28 Days Later really stand out, however, is that it offers more than that, without force-feeding its theme to the viewer (exactly how Oliver Stone would NOT have handled it).  How do people behave under stress?  What psychological defenses does one employ to deal with nigh unthinkable devastation?  In the absence of law to circumscribe one's actions, is one's behavior guided more by morality or by what one can get away with?  The film is clearly grappling with these questions, and the viewer can't help but ask himself how he would behave under these circumstances.  The most compelling question asked - and the central question of the film, I think - is whether humanity is self-governed by force or by morality.  And, at the micro level, which of these governs an individual's choices.  Enter ""Lord of the Flies.""  These are the questions I found myself ruminating on weeks after I saw the film, and what, in my opinion, makes it so enjoyable.
Unfortunately, the flaws of 28 Days Later prevent it from being a great film.  The second half seems to lose focus.  I simply could not accept that people would behave in the manner they do here.  I understand that the attempt was to juxtapose the enraged with the even more monstrous uninfected, but the effort abandoned all attempts at the subtlety that would have made it effective.  Also, why don't the enraged attack each other?  I will gladly accept an answer, but please at least offer one.  Worst of all, the film ends with hope, despite all signs pointing the other way up to that point.  The ending makes me strongly suspect that artistic control was preempted by the studio's desire to satisfy audiences with a ""feel good"" ending.  A shame....
All things considered, however, 28 Days Later is a provocative, multi-layered thriller with plenty to offer.",1066694400,4,3006,4.993975903614458
1542726,5,B00005JMA8,"I consider myself a horror-movie buff and while others may not consider this a horror movie...I would.  It's not your typical ""zombie"" movie (in fact, there are no real zombies - rather the ""monsters"" are people who have been infected by a virus) nor is it your typical blood and gore fest.  No, what you have here is more of a psychological horror.  Sure, there are a few ""graphic"" scenes but the real horror lies in the question:  ""What If?""

1542795,5,B00005JMA8,"I want to go out and say that 28 days later is a great film. Although, I do want to state a warning that is movie is not for all people. Some people come into this movie expecting some dumb cheap horror movie like cabin fever. This is definitely more of a psychological thriller than a zombie movie. First off, for the morons that get on here and call the ""infected"" (which is what they are referred to the ENTIRE movie) zombies, they are not. No where in this movie does anyone call them zombies. For those scoring at home, Movie 1, Morons 0. Now, as for the stupid people that get on here and complain about how there are not guns around... well for those who know nothing of England, guns are illegal. Notice, the only people with guns are military personel. Movie 2, Morons 0. Then there are people who get on here saying that the monkeys get rage from watching tv. FALSE. The scientist clearly states that the monkeys were given inhibitors. I must have seen another movie, or the sound must have just been on.... Movie 3 Morons 0. People...pay attention to the movie. In all seriousness, this movie does have similairities to the Omega Man... but it still seperates itself. This movie is more dark and also is more psychological. I don't want to give a lot about the movie away, but this movie has a lot more to it than so called ""zombies."" It also shows how man would react to an apocalyptic scenario such as an outbreak of this magnitude. It just isn't man vs. the infected, but it turns into man vs. man.... something I did not expect going into the movie. I don't know about most moviegoers, but I want to be suprised and see the unexpected. I also want to see a movie that is going to make me think. While I love this moive and encourage people to see it, I would not recommend it to people how do not like psychological thrillers or to the younger audience, 17 and below. Not because of the violence, but honestly, they would not get it.

If you want to think, be thouroughly creeped out, and enjoy a well written and extremely well directed movie with amazing cinematography and acting, then this is your movie.  I could see why some people would get bored from the movie, but my guess is that they are uneducated and their opinion probably doesn't matter much anyway.

Secondly in response to your bitching about the fact that nobody went and got a gun to defend themselves...well...the movie is set in the UK.  In case you didn't know, guns aren't legal in the UK.  You can't just pop down to Wal-Mart to get one like you can in good ol' KY.

The film was not what I expeted from the advertising, but I didn't let that little bit of disapointment ruin the film for me.

The movie is set in post-apocalyptic Britain, which has been rendered desolate by a biological virus that has turned the inhabitants into.....egadddsss....blood puking, red eyed, f***n zombies!!! Actually, they aren't even zombies. To become a zombie you first have to die, so why the hell are they referred to as zombies? Just a prototypical example of the placidic ignorance that oozes from this piece of s**t, low budget,cellar quality, over-hyped sh** fest of a movie, or how about instead of movie we call it a two-hour insanity inducing torture device? The first half-hour or so features the star (hahhhhahhah) walking around a deserted London. And he walks, and he walks, and he... get the picture? The writer must have thought that he was doing a brillant job to evoke the solitude of the post-apocalyptic atmosphere...ever here of overkill pal? At this point in the film I wanted to walk out (My God how merciful that would have been!)and get the hell away from this cursed sh**fest, but I was accompanied by friends and didn't want to leave because we did *pay*, yes actual money to see this sh**. So this dumba** guy wonders around, looking stupid (although he didn't have to look hard) and taking in the freakin scenery. By the way, he had been in a coma for 28 days, hence the name of the sh**fest 28 Days Later. And he walks and walks some more...HE LOVED TO WALK! Finally he comes into contact with SURVIVORS! Wow! Zowsers! But guess what? Even though they are fighting for their lives, outnumbered a zillion to one by these plauge victims (oh sorry, ZOMBIES)they do not get a SINGLE GUN? What the hell? Who in their right freakin mind would not go get a damn gun in this situation? So these two survivors hook up with the star, a great Omega Man rip-off, I still can't remember his name, nor do I want to! So the zombies chase them (ohhhhhhh) and they run to this dumbass building where they escape and meet more survivors! Yes! They talk about how it never rains and they don't have water. At this point my mind is friggin numb it would have taken electric shock therapy to resucitate a response from my poor brain. Then the Zombie Possee as I call them, get a message from this radio that says more people are alive! I'll be damned! For an end of the world scenario there sure are a lot of surviors! They then begin their journey to Eden away from the plague infested city, and almost get caught by the *scary* zombies. On their way to Eden they find a small farm. They sit and talk and look around, damned exciting stuff eh? Oh man this is such a thrilling flick! Look out Exorcist your mantle as scariest movie ever is barely holding on! They then drive off in search of... yes 'Eden'. They find army soldiers at a military base, the dumb looking Omega Man rip-off is like...""Whoa dude... this is heavy sh**."" If they had gone out on the streets of L.A., found a drunken bum, who could not speak it would have been an infinitely better choice for this film's star! The budget for this film looked like it was around $100,000; counting the knock-off Omega Man's salary! After they find the source of the radio transmission the Zombie Possee discovers that these military men want to take the women of the party and party with them! The Omega knock-off pulls some big time heroics and gets the living sh** beat out of him! And to add insult to injury they take his women! The army commander takes Omega out to meet his pet zombie. He says that he keeps him so he can find out how long it takes them to ""starve"" to death. Another mile-wide in this dumbass flick's plot. They explain nothing about why they ""starve"", what in the hell are they talking about, starving? Holey plot Batman, this movie sucks! So the Omega-knockoff eventually gets free and rescues his lady friends. Omega then gets in a car with them and crashes the compound's gate...then those famous words appear...
28 DAYS LATER (Damn!! Can you stand the suspense?!)
Omega and the girls find them a nice little country cottage and are living happily ever after, when all of a sudden a plane flies overhead! END OF SH## FEST.
  Final Analysis: I mercifully spared you the horrible details of this sh&& fest. Zombies that run around and puke blood, and starve to death. Aren't zombies flesh-eaters? Don't zombies actually have to die to be zombies? The WORST paced movie I have ever seen, bar none! So damn slow you think your brain has been placed on slow motion. I was literally aching physically and mentally after this abhorrid sh** fest. And the promos said: ""The scariest movie since the Exorcist!"", ""Out of your seat zombie attack scenes!""  Bullsh**. This movie wouldn't scare a damn fly. The actors were horrible, the cinematography looked like sh** ( a 10 year old camcorder would exude more quality), the movie was SOOOOOO DAMNED SLOW, oh God. My whole purpose of writing this movie is to save you some pain (watching this sh**), and wasting hard earned money to see this wretched Omega Man knock-off.

1542802,3,B00005JMA8,"Advertised as a fright filled horror film, 28 Days Later is more accurately a science fiction suspense story. 28 Days Later is a mix of apocalyptic films like 12 Monkeys and Omega Man. Much like Omega man, this film also features an interracial relationship between the two main characters Jim (Cillian Murphy) and Selena (Naomie Harris) and the similarities don't just stop there. One drawback of this film is in its opening, a back story, which unnecessarily shows us how the rage virus began through primates in a laboratory. The film would have started off to a better pace if we were instead introduced to Jim awaking in the hospital only to find the world around him desolate. After he awakens he soon partners up with the last remaining survivors in a depopulated London and together they seek out others to pair up with as they battle off the infected, whose only aim here is to kill or infect others.  Depending on how you view it this movie either borrows or steals from the other apocalyptic science fiction and horror films already out there. I found it enjoyable, but I kept feeling as though I were watching a remake.
Now onto the DVD.
I enjoyed the interesting yet implausible alternative ending which has been included on this DVD. It is a story board sequence acted out by the director and the producer and presents an ending void of the soldiers scenario and deals with Jim's further search for a cure to the rage virus. In that version Jim sacrifices himself in order to save Hannah's father and his relationship with the women characters never materializes.  The DVD also includes three other alternative endings none of which work for me as well as the theatrical one but which are great to see. The picture is sharp which one would expect from DVD. The director commentary is some what brief and vague in most areas, it seems they were watching and not describing during the most part. A short making of is here as well as something about the rage and I did not watch all of this short either. If you enjoyed this film or enjoy seeing alternative endings and deleted scenes this DVD works well.",1066348800,,2116,4.64

The biggest downside to this DVD will be the medium in which the movie was filmed. The film has a grainy quality for a ""stylish"" effect.

The first encounter with a zombie kills one of them off in half a second and this guy was supposed to be a survivor? The Nazi like camp they encounter is
where everyone gets their highbrow ideas about this movie. It didn't bring me to any revelations. I already know people suck without a movie sucking to tell me bout it. How about some makeup for those dracu-ombies? The living people looked as much like zombies as the others. Please just rent the classic or even the remake of Night of the Living Dead.

Sometimes recycling classic themes is a great idea, so in theory Boyle's interpretaion of a zombie movie would make a great example of recycling... Not.
Where is the tension? Where is the suspense? We know who is going to survive and who is going to get it from the first 15 minutes of the movie.
Yes, we have, as we have in all movies made by Boyle, a great cinematographic composition but it doesnt stand out.
This is suposed to be a scary movie... And it might have been should Boyle had managed to put you in the players shoes, but that just doesnt happen.

This Movie is heavily influenced by Classics like George Romero's Dawn & Day of the Dead,without being a cheap Remake Clone. Danny Boyle has taken these influences and and incoporated them into 28 days Later to craft a original Horror Movie. The Movie also does not rely on cheap shocks to frighten it's audience but uses a feeling of dispair,dread and clautrophobia mixed with genuine concern for the Characters to do so.

First of all, this movie utilizes some very beautiful camera work when it delivers its characters that you learn to feel for AND its scenery that is constantly looming with a desperate sense of hopelessness and emptiness that could very well have your skin crawling. Which, by the way, is how this movie delivers its scares. Yes, you will be startled too, but if you can appreciate beautiful camera work and sound that will have your heart thumping off of your rib cage, then you will surly enjoy a movie such as this. Also, don't expect the kind of ""horror"" movie that you may be used to. This movie throws a spin on the genre by delivering a very artistic take, which I think takes nothing away and does so much for originality. By the way, this movie is VERY intense.

  I found this movie to be dull and the least bit original.  To begin with this must have been written years before the world became technological.  Also if you want a good scary movie don't purchase this, it isn't at all.  It has not ultimate climax, if anything the introduction is the highlight of the movie and from that point it begins to go downhill.  The ""zombies"" or ""infected"" look so fake and were so poorly developed that they ended up looking like psychotic nutcases.  I was attracted to this movie because it is british, and british film makers have a unique way of capturing their audience.  This movie failed to do anything to me at all except make me feel like i shouldn't rented Buffy the Vampire Slayer which would have given me more thrills.
If you want a movie with no climax and a bunch of talk then buy this,  if you want a good movie, i would suggest looking around some more.",1065484800,3,924,4.3882352941176475
1542880,1,B00005JMA8,"13 year old 'Scream' fans rejoice! You can finally watch a zombie film that doesn't have any gorey scenes and will not insult your intelligence in the slightest! I stumbled into this film cos I though it was the sequel to the awesome Sandra Bullock film '28 Days' but was pleasantly surprised to find that it's actually a horror which does everything right. Don't be foooled by the fact that it's foreign, this feel just like any Hollywood movie like '2 Fast 2 Furious' or 'Bad Boys 2'!
This film is totally a breath of fresh air to the horror genre just like the US remake of 'Ringu'. Highly original and doesn't rip of 'Dawn of the Dead' 'Omega Man' or 'Day of the Triffids' at all. I mean this film doesn't have zombies that will kill and eat you, it has people infected with the ""rage virus"" (whoah I could have never came up with that name!) that will kill you for your blood. And those empty street scenes, wow I've never seen a movie that uses that cinematic effect before!
The director is this really cool British guy who made 'Trainspotting' you know the more harder edge version of 'Requiem for a Dream' and he sure knows how to build suspense without using the old cat-jumps-out-of-closet trick.
I sure am glad this was made with 13 year olds in mind too, I certainly don't want to see a zombie film that show zombies biting people on camera, yuck! It good too that it wasn't made by one of those Itallian directors who might have shown guts on the screen or even hurt a real monkey, like in those sicko 70's zombie and cannibal movies true horror fans avoid. The whole family can enjoy '28 Days Later' and thats the way a horror film should be! Also the suspense is fast like it was filmed by the same cinematographer who make those trippy ""Backstreet Boys"" MTV video clips, it sure isn't boring like those over-rated turkeys 'The Exorcist' or 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre'.
I just can't epress my gratitude enough for Danyy Boyle and his fresh original horror film that push the boundries and is the scariest movie since 'Final Destination'.",1065312000,3,2050,4.528301886792453

Moreover, while Resident Evil is a far more mainstream Hollywood film, with its share of special FX and grandiose production value, 28 Days Later diverges with  surreal claustraphrobic imagery - therefore you can appreciate each individual film in different contexts.

However, I felt a little indulgent, and on a summer afternoon I saw Danny Boyle's ""28 Days Later"".  (After all, I figured, he DID make ""Trainspotting""... how bad could it be?)  Three viewings later, I was only more ravenous to see it again.  It is amazing how this film grows on you.  Boyle does a spectacular job in not overdoing gore (as you would expect in a zombie film) and instead focusing on the humanity of the situation in which his characters find themselves.  What would you do if your world was destroyed?  Why live?  These are the questions Boyle asks and answers in ""28 Days"".  The film serves as an intense commentary on human nature from a number of perspectives--the ugly and ruthless, and the spiritual and beautiful.  The film showcases a fantastic soundtrack and great acting.  It helps that the actors are pretty much unheard of, along with the fact that the film is almost completely shot in digital.  It gives the movie a sense of legimacy and rawness that lends itself well to the subject matter.  You cannot, however, avoid the fact that this is a horror film.  If you can't stomach a good bout of anxiety, don't bother.  I, for one, love a good scare, so this movie is all the better.  Give ""28 Days Later"" a shot.  Watch it with an open mind.

1542975,5,B00005JMA8,"I went into this film expecting a classic sci-fi genre with that age old plotline dealing with an end of the world scenerio. What I received in return was a film that beat the crap out of anything I've seen for the last six months, a film that torched the mess out of:
A. Freddy Vs. Jason
B. Jeepers Creeper 2
C. Cabin Feaver
D. Darkness Falls
E. The Ring
This film takes us on a  smart, sophisticated journey from London to Manchester, England. We encounter a host of infected civilians and a small band of survivors who come together for survival. This film is beautifully executed and wonderfully put together. It will no doubt have you wondering what you would do in a similar situation. The soundtrack is perfect. In one scene, four of our survivors are driving through the Manchester country side as they see the city burning to the ground from a far distance, while in the background we hear Faure's 'In Paradisium'. It's a twisted turn that made me want to stand up in the theatre and shout in approval.
We also behold the thin line between the sane and infected. This is strongly thrust at us towards the end of the film when a group of nine surviving soldiers show us why morality and ethics takes a back seat in disasterous times.
The last twenty minutes of this movie is one of the most powerful segments captured on film in the last year. The racking soundtrack and edge of your seat suspense will have you rooting for some survivors to live, while hoping other get torn apart by our red-eyed monstrous civilians. A must see for all fans of suspense, horror, and, believe it or not, music and art lovers.

1542976,5,B00005JMA8,"To be honest I think most ""horror"" movies are just gore flicks nowadays, with sequels that must have greater body counts and no discernible creativity.  This movie was awesome in that it didn't rely on gore for effect.  It certainly had some blood spattering going on, but that wasn't the focus.  If you want that I highly recommend a six-pack of Newcastle and ""Jason Vs Freddy"".
What seperates this movie from the million zombie flicks out there isn't so much the fact that the infected are still alive, it's that they sprint at you instead of meandering slowing as they moan.  You can't just push them down either.  As for moaning, they either make no sound at all as they charge you from behind, or they scream at the top of their lungs.  Both alternatives are pretty freaky IMO.
The director made incredible use of point-of-view angles and the accompanying sounds, so you *see* the victim as the infected goes charging at them, and you hear the infected's footfalls and breathing at the same time.  *Very* eery.  The idea that an entire country was wiped out in a month was cool, and the vacant streets of London was nice in an apocalyptic sense.
My only problem with this flick was the ""stupid horror movie mistakes"".  The country is overrun with insane people who only come out at night and kill anyone they see, so as we walk down the street at night let's have a casual conversation in normal voices....  Or see that empty building?  Let me go check it out alone for no reason....
I overlook the dumb mistakes of the main character and still give this movie 5 stars because it made me start turning on lights when I walk around my condo at night.  It's a tad embarassing but this movie is ... scary.",1064102400,,1707,4.52442996742671

1542978,5,B00005JMA8,"First off the best thing about this movie is that it is in the tradition of a zombie movie but they never actually say the word zombie, they just say ""infected"" (Much in the style of the ""vampire"" movie Near Dark). Not to spoil anything in the movie, but the defining characteristics of a zombie is that they are DEAD and eat HUMAN brains/flesh/whatever! In this movie once something is dead it stays dead. The infected are exactly that, infected with a disease that makes them go mad and crave live meat/flesh. For those of us that were paying attention when we saw the movie, they don't just hunt people, but ANYTHING that is alive, such as rats (if you haven't seen the movie you will understand when you watch it). It is an original idea placed over a familiar plot. I have never seen a ""zombie"" movie where the ""zombie(s)"" can run as fast, if not faster, then their prey and then tear them to shreds in a matter of seconds. Like it or not you do have to admit that it is one of the best ""zombie"" horror movies in a long, long time.

1542979,2,B00005JMA8,"What was this? I couldn't tell if it was horror movie, or a movie like Signs, where it's a drama and the aliens were just to make the religous story more interesting. And the brief comic relief scene in the supermarket didn't even go into place. One second there's suspenseful scary music and the next there's comical music with ""funny"" scenes. It was very confusing and just not right.
I love the idea. That is what drew me to watch this in the first place. If they kept going with that, this would be a great horror film. Every horror film they make nowadays has the combination of horror, drugs, and sex, and it normally doesn't work. The movie starts off with newsflashes. A monkey is connected to this machine and he's watching the news, bad news, causing him to be infected with rage. That's alright, untill an animal rights group comes in and free's all of the infected monkeys, ignoring one of the scientist's warnings. One of the monkey's kill a member of the group and...
28 Days Later...
We see a nude man waking up in a hospital bed. This is Jim. After putting on a robe and walking outside he finds a deserted city. Unaware of anything that has happened in the past 28 days, Jim walks around the empty city yelling ""Hello?!"" and getting no answer. Thats is untill he opens the door to a church and finds the pews filled with zombie like creatures(still good, so far)and gets attacked by a rabid priest. Running away into the night he is cornered by more of the zombie creatures, but is saved by Selena and Mark, two uninfected people who inform him never to go out at night, which is when the infected come out.
Jim discovers that his parents are dead. He joins Selena, who killed Mark after he became infected, and the two meet two more surviors Frank and his daughter Hannah, who have locked themselves in thier apartment. After a few days of staying with them, they hear a radio broadcast from Major Henry West, promising a sanctuary of some sort, and the four head off to get there, whilst dealing with the monsters who now roam the U.K. in the messed up world.
The film went down under sometime during their quest to get to the sanctuary. I'll give you the clue of about two minutes after Frank kicks a fence. The last forty five minutes in the miltary retreat was pointless. It changed the entire point and plotline of this movie. Nothing happened but useless conversation and a non-suspense rape subject sequence.
The most gory scene is when Selena kills Mark about he becomes infected. It comes almost at the very beginning so it's not like I'm ruining anything for you. It was horrible. Extremly graphic and horrify, I was shocked about that. Just the idea is horrible, and not the actually blow. The movie isn't scary after the first half hour-forty five minutes. It's just plain disturbing. So is the part I liked. It's becomes to a point where the content of the film is scary, but the plot. Just the idea of it all. Wait for the video.
ENJOY!

1542980,3,B00005JMA8,"28 Days later is a pleasing diversion from the toils of everyday life.  It sets up an interesting premise, but really tries to cram too many different plot lines into 2 hours.  The start of the movie (after the terrible ""teaser"") is fascinating - what would you do if you woke up one day and everyone else was gone?  The shots of the empty streets of London are fantastic and the menacingly fast and terrifying ""zombies"", for want of a better word (come on - they're mindless, self-replicating monsters, what else are we going to call them, ""French""?), really make this seem like it could be a great horror movie.  However, presumably cautious of stealing too much from Romero, the movie turns into ""Road Trip"" meets ""Maximum Overdrive"", and then tries to recreate the claustrophobic atmosphere of ""The Thing"".  The climax is too short, and too well put together to be really believable and yes, the ending sucks.
My main complaint against the movie is that it relied too much on the cheap shock.  Things jumping through windows and monsters movie really quickly are good but somewhat obvious techniques.  For this to be a truly 4 or 5 star movie I'd like two more things; One - some buildup of suspense - only when Jim wanders off at the truck stop do we really feel horrible things are about to happen, and two- some deeper meaning.  The ""Rage"" is so all-consuming that we can't really draw parallels between it and AIDS or communism or the rise of the inner cities.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, but if the movie truly was seeking to be ""art-house"" some deeper levels might've been nice.

Besides the works of Romero and Fulci, us zombie fans have little else to go on, save for the release of Resident Evil which used digital effects to put a new spin on the walking dead.

Just good ol' gore, colored contacts and excellent build-up.  These zombies are equally, if not more effective in frightening audiences because they are very much unlike zombies we're used to.  No stretched moans and groans and no slow walking for them.  They scream, they shreik, they give chase.

1543033,4,B00005JMA8,"No, ""28 Days Later"" isn't the sequel to that Sandra Bullock rehab movie. It's the newest film by British filmmaker Danny Boyle (""Trainspotting"", ""The Beach""). Released November 2002 in the U.K., the film became a sleeper hit, went to Sundance Film Festival, and enjoyed a degree of success in mainstream American theaters.
""28 Days Later"" opens with a team of animal activists who break into a clinic to release primates who are being used for testing a deadly virus. The apes are contagious, and any contact with their body fluids will pass along the infection, which reduces the infected to grotesque zombie-like creatures.
Twenty-eight days after this event, Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes up from a coma in an abandoned hospital. He can't find anyone and apparently doesn't know about the virus because he was asleep during the chaos. He walks along the deserted streets of London and is saved from the violent onslaught of infected zombies by two healthy people who have survived.
Shot on digital video (apparently because it lends the movie a ""realistic"" feel), this film is eerie and asks things of an audience that few movies have done for 20 or 30 years. It is quiet and spare in the way that many 1970s sci-fi movies were. Instead of showcasing gratuitous gore and mind-numbing action, this movie has thinking characters who ask the audience to think. It builds gradually, engrossing the audience and getting them emotionally involved with the characters. When was the last time you actually cared if a character in a movie lived or died?
I wouldn't call this movie scary exactly, although it is scary in the sense that you imagine yourself up on the screen in a desolate London after most of the country's population has been wiped out or turned into mindless zombies. What would you do? How would you survive? The scariness of this movie isn't really based on the fact that zombies are running around killing people, but more on that life is fragile and relationships with people are important, and anything that threatens life or the lives of people around you is frightening.
Despite the fact that the movie was shot on digital video, it still has high production values and perfectly cast actors. We see shot after shot of a deserted London, deserted freeway streets and a world where electricity and running water are no longer part of life. The characters inhabit this world with a grave uncertainty, thrust from the world we live in to a world of loneliness, loss and wildness.",1062979200,13,2491,4.863529411764706

Big mistake number two was watching it at night!  LATE at night....NEVER again is all I can say!  I'm amazed that such a low budget film could come out so well, amazed and pleased because some big budget films are a waste of movie air time and money!
The special effects were next to nothing, but the plot made up for that.  It was a surprisingly simple plot, a lethal virus is let loose on an unsuspecting society.  Transmitted through a single drop of blood it sets of a chain reaction that locks those unfortunate enough to be infected with it (human or beast) into a perpetual state of murderous rage and fury.  The title refers to the time of the aftermath, 28 days later in which society is now two tiered.  Those who have been infected with the virus and those who haven't.  And those who haven't are in the minority to say the least!  And so the few uninfected survivors begin a desperate attempt to carry on living, avoiding the virus infested remnants of a now defunked society.
There are no big named stars in this film, like I said earlier it was a low budget film, made with digital cameras so I have been told, but there is a good musical score and excellent all round acting.

1543039,2,B00005JMA8,"In the beginning of the film, the audience finds out that the infection in the laboratory monkeys is caused by rage. This leads the audience to believe that the movie will convey rage and its effects on human beings, thus making people compare the movie's reality to that of their own. (Basically, people will be forced to look at their own lives and see how they need to change in order to make this world a better place. You would think this is another one of those ""wake up and smell the coffee movies"" that would try to get people to change their destructive behavoior.) This movie does NOT deliver this message however. Even if it tried to, the movie was just too violent and gruesome. Realities of the world can be shown in a smart, non-violent manner as well.
28 Days Later delivers no strong message(s) to the audience and is just another waste of film and money.",1061164800,,871,4.484276729559748
1543040,4,B00005JMA8,"This was the best new horror moview I've seen in years.  It seems most horror movies these days rely on bad CG graphics, shallow characters, and pointless plots (e.g. Darkness Falls, Jeepers Creepers, Ghost Ship), but not 28 Days Later.  It relies on its story and atmosphere (partially created by the low production values).  It's not really ""scary"" so much as it is ominous.  It's a good a negative-utopia as I've seen on film.  Maybe, for me, the most effective parts were the opening scenes in a deserted London and the later portion set to the old hymn ""Abide with me fast falls the eventide.""  That really gave me the chills.  The effects are modest (no bad CG that I could see), and the gore is kept to a minimum.
This movie does have its faults though.  First, it is not terribly original.  The plot is more or less an amalgamation and retelling of Day of the Dead and The Omega Man.  The part of the movie at the military complex (right down to the captured zombie / rage victim) is straight out of Day of the Dead.  The basic lesson that the human survivors are the real threat of course is a major theme in all of George Romero's zombie films.  The infection idea / fighting against crazed victims of the disease is very similar to The Omega Man.  Yet 28 Days puts its own twist on things and makes it work well...except for the ending.  The happy ""hollywood"" ending is just horrible and unbelievable.  I have not seen the new supposedly darker ending, but anything would have been better.",1061164800,,1500,4.483394833948339

So what does this mean? Well, it means that, instead of the script focusing on humans running away from zombies for 90 or so minutes, the script instead focuses on how 4 strangers cope with being the only persons alive in their country, who also happen to be stalked by ranging monsters, of course. Surprisingly, the script is loaded with more mindful ideas (i.e. lone survival VS. cooperating with strangers to survive as a unit, because, let's face it, being alone sucks) than seat-ejector tactics. The fact that the movie pays so much attention to its characters makes the film's occasional bits of horror all the more genuinely frightening. More than anything, the movie would rather (first) portray its characters as three-dimensional human-beings before expecting you to fear for their lives.

1543172,5,B00005JMA8,"Indeed, this film seems to generate a love or hate response among the viewers (always a sign of potential greatness - no mediocrity born of the test audience here).
Shot on digital video (likely due to cost and flexibility) we are introduced to what has perhaps been mistakenly billed as a horrer film. This film is clearly in the post apocalyptic camp, with all the ensuing moral cautionary notes thrown in.
'Action' is given a chaotic cutting / editing which makes the scenes all the more tense. However, there's really very little gore and 'pop out' surprises. Overall the move focuses on character development.
The cinematography is painstakingly crafted, ambiance is subtle and evokes the dread of being lost in a hostile and barren environment, characters are rich and evoke at least a sense of personal attachment.
There's very little I can add to the many excellent reviews already posted here. However, that being said:
This movie is not a derivative of Resident Evil (please forgive those that assert this - the video game generation knows no other frame of reference than...well, video games) or any other Zombie movie. In fact, there isn't a single zombie in the whole film. The infected are just that, infected with a virus causing uncontrollable and unreasing hostility and violence. If one wants to find the roots of some of the major plot devices, they should look back to 'The Day of the Triffids'. Clearly there are parallels to ombie movies but to call imply derivation is unfair.
When Jim, in a disoriented state only glances at the new paper detailing the evacuation does this really surprise us? He's hungary, dehydrated and has just awoke from a head wound induced coma. To top it all off the whole world has apparently diassapeared. I think it's safe to see he is not thinking 100% clearly.
The flashing light on the skyscraper is actually quite clever, healthy humans will reason through to the appartment but the infected, with their diminshed mental capacity would likely be unable to connect the light to the stairwell and the correct apartment.
When Jim wanders into the cheesburger stand it's a classic 'don't go in their, moron' syndrome. Unfortunately some people probably would do things like this, evidence that they still haven't fully adjusted to their new reality (natural selection anyone?). It was pleasant to see someone actually tell the other folks that going into the tunnel was a really [bad] idea.
The plane flying ahead was clearly placed there to support one characters hypothesis that the rest of the world didn't have the virus, that in fact England had been isolated. I had to wonder how this could realistically be achieved. Adventurers would inevitably stop by, it would seem radio signals would be making it across etc. However, it plausbile to assume visitng thrill seekers were killed and radio may have been intercepted in places here and there. It's unlikely the virus would spread from the island...but not impossible.
Regarding the brutish behaviour of the soldiers. No surprises here...what do you expect when law breaks down? Keep in mind the it's extremely unlikely they were motivated by the cerebral desire to reconstitue the species, rather the reproductive urge combined with the stress of the environment, and obvious lack of consequences for their actions helped shaped their attitude. This type of behaviour should be expected, and much worse if any serious breakdown in a society were to occur.
From my perspective there was only one serious plot hole - (it's a rather significant one though). Why didn't the infected attack each other?
If they were just mindless angry people lashing out at anything that moved, why not each other? They clearly weren't intelligent enough to reason, they shouldn't have a plausible goal to 'get the living' as we are always presented with in B rate zombie movies.
In any event, a top film, check it out.",1059350400,,3907,4.966412213740458

I watched this movie because a friend told me it was really good and besides, in all the advertisements, it said ""SCARY AS HELL"" so of course, I was looking forward to a horror flick that would make me not want to go to sleep alone at night.
The first few minutes of the movie grabbed my attention due tot he horrific images in the videos, but after going through 15 minutes of Jim walking around London yelling ""HELLO!!"", it went downhill from there. It was not ""Scary as hell"", not even a bit. In fact, I felt [silly] because many people started leaving within 30-45 minutes of the film and someone sitting two seats away from me started talking on her cell phone, left and never came back. Bored, perhaps? There was nothing scary about this movie. Sure there were a few jumps here and there, but nothing to scream about.

I have to give credit for the soundtrack and the cinematography. Very artsy-fartsy. For an independent film, I enjoyed the shots and the music that went along with the scenes. If anything, I should've gone and looked for the soundtrack instead of watching the movie. The actors weren't bad at all, although they could have had a better script.

CUT TO:
28 DAYS LATER
Jim awakens naked in a hospital bed.  He has been in a coma for a month and has no idea what happened.  Although the movie was shot on video (probably to save money) the movie has some incredible effects - the most moving of which is the sight of a nearly empty England.  Jim starts to put things together when he sees heaps of the dead.  ""Hello?"" he asks.  BIG MISTAKE.  Friends and neighbors, if you ever wake up to an empty world, no matter WHAT your beliefs are, ALWAYS ASSUME THAT ZOMBIES ARE TO BLAME.
Of course, Jim hooks up with other survivors, as usually happens in this kind of a movie.  What sets this movie apart is the level of artistry with which the subject matter is handled.  It is well-written, well-acted, and well-directed.  We sort-of know what is going to happen, but we don't care because that's what we're there for.  28 Days Later is basically an art film for those of us who love horror movies.  It is, in fact, the best new horror movie I've seen in a while.  Boyle and Garland (who collaborated together on The Beach, a failed realization of Garland's novel) know, along with Stephen King, that the secret of horror lies in characterization.  There are only so many ways to kill a man, and movie audiences have seen them.

Secondly those complaining about product placement, the filmmakers have claimed they didn't get any money for product placement. they used brand names because they wanted verisimilitude.  Not sure if i beleive it but that's what i read.
Now, the film.  The film really isn't a horror film as such, but I found it a very gripping film. It borrows from other films, but it does it so well that I forgive it. It is a genre film and genres have formulas.
Certainly it is not without problem. A tough character ends up needing to be rescued, and one of the last deaths was totally unbelievable. However, I can overlook that and I enjoyed it completely.",1058918400,,848,4.64
1543179,2,B00005JMA8,"For the most part, I love a zombie movie. I also like horror movies. However, something made me leave the theatre  unsatisfied with this movie. Although 28 Days Later tries to be a movie with both a conscience and gore, it seems to fall flat with little explanation of it's own plot.
For one thing, we do not really get much in way of the background. Within the first 5 minutes of the film, the virus and everything are just kind of thrown at us without being explained in the way of a violent attack at some sort of laboratory for testing. Perhaps the makers of this movie could have just spent a little time not rushing this part; for one thing, the ""rage"" virus that people suffer from is the main premise of the movie. The next thing is, of course, the caption that says 28 days later and some guy is naked in a hospital...
28 Days Later should be credited for doing several things well. This is at least a movie that takes itself seriously; the characters are not your average horror movie stereotypes and there is some build up of character development. There is a sense of eeriness about the city when the main character is walking about trying to find out what has happened.
However, very little is explained, which leads to more questions than answers. Where are the people in other cities, countries, etc? What is exactly ""rage""?  Why are the zombies constantly vomiting? Why do the zombies ""sleep""? Why in the world did they use that ending for the movie?
The movie was a tad on the violent side, which, I suppose, should be expected. But it wasn't really a ""violent"" type of violent, but more of a ""loud"" violent. For instance,  when someone is about to be attacked then they crank up this loud music from the soundtrack and keep getting it louder and louder until the attack scene is over. There are also many times when the camera shakes around and you rarely can tell what is actually happening.
It seemed as though they spent too much time dragging out things and not making clear connections as to what exactly these people were suppose to be doing to survive from the breed of zombies. I think they could have cut some of the scenes to fit in a little more background. Overall, not bad, but I wouldn't watch it again for the price of a show.",1058832000,3,2259,4.43855421686747

>This movie is more subdued and shot in gritty, drab tones. The horror scenes are done through dizzying camera-work but not with the typical hollywood blitz and flash. Some shots are done with frenzied editing of incoherent horrors, but its with purpose and style, and used quite sparingly, which heightens its impact.
The agent responsibile for turning ordinary humans into zombies is quite vague. It has something to do with captive primates and how bombardment of images on modern urban warfare somehow became an agent in their blood that could be transmitted by the good old-fashioned tecniques like biting and bloodspill. It's never really explained though, which might be a screenwriting copout, but I feel it rather adds the sense of confusion and terrified awe of the main character, who wakes up in a hospital bed to find the world around him infested solely by the undead in lurking corners.
There's some moral poking and prodding at the dinner table scene that deals with the presence and purpose of man on earth, and whether or not the outbreak was natures way of returning the planet to the status quo the way it was before man got here just a few years ago
 It's quite bloody and ditrubing, and mainstream movie-goers will be driven away by it's overall bleakness and frank British filmmaking, but those who appreciate well crafted thrillers will dig this film, although it could have benefitted from a few more scares.
Unlike conventional horror movies, however, the gore and frenzy seems only incidental. Boyle doesn't seem to be filming these shots with the intention of only showing some gore.
Oh yeah, and Brendan Gleeson provides a familiar face amidst the competent British unknowns.",1058745600,,1869,4.990384615384615
1543249,4,B00005JMA8,"""28 Days Later"" enchants with a marvelous score (John Murphy) and dazzling photography.  The scenes of a deserted and absolutely still London are unforgettable.
A group of animal rights activists invade a laboratory to free the animals and save them from experimentation.  The animals are infected with a virus that causes rage and follows with a horrible death.  The animals show their appreciation by viciously attacking their liberators and running amok.  28 days later, Jim (Cillian Murphy) awakens from a coma, naked in a London hospital. Disentangling himself from support devices, he sees a scene of disarray and not a soul in sight.  He calls out to absolute silence.  He wanders the empty streets becoming increasingly disoriented and terrified.  When he is attacked by a group of infected people, two hard-bitten non-infected survivors save him.  They get a recorded radio message supposedly from the Royal Army telling them to get to Manchester where a vaccine is available.  They have a harrowing journey (any reader of Stephen King's ""The Stand"" could have told them to Stay Out Of That Tunnel!) and finally arrive to find a quasi-military group led by a half-mad Major with strong overtones of Colonel Kurtz in ""Heart of Darkness.""  They are quartered in a beautiful English country home that is properly spooky. The group finally overcomes the ""army"" in some highly unlikely encounters and the movie ends on an optimistic note.
Cillian Murphy as Jim gives a highly nuanced performance.  He is by no means an action hero.  Jim is a nice, not overly bright born follower who reluctantly has bravery forced upon him. He firmly keeps the audience on edge, proving to us over and over again he is no Terminator or Robo Cop coming to the rescue.
The major problem with the movie is it loses emphasis when it leaves London behind and descends to a more mundane level.  Minor flaws are the opening scenes at the laboratory. There should have been Level 4 precautions dealing with such a lethal virus and airtight security.  The activists entered with the ease of visiting a pet store.  Another worrisome thing to me was exactly how long did the infected people live after coming down with the virus? They weren't ""zombies"" because they weren't dead, but they certainly did a lot of running around!
In spite of a few problems, I recommend the movie, though not to the faint of heart.

1543250,2,B00005JMA8,"This movie has a very interesting premise: Humans become infected with a virus, ""Rage"", which causes them to hunt down and bite other humans so as to transmit the disease. On second thought, that's not a good premise at all.
The movie opens in post-apocolyptic London, with empty streets and eerie flyers pinned to walls of distressed families looking for each other. The first half an hour or so follows the main character, Jim, around London looking for answers to the ostensible question: ""Where is everyone?""
Well, for those are going to see the movie, I don't want to spoil it. The footage is fascinating initially, and the viewer is forced to stop and think about how completely empty the reality of that circumstance would be. However, it doesn't get much better than that, and soon becomes a senseless zombie thriller. The ""uninfected"" turn against each other, the zombies rise, etc. etc.
I had high expectations for this movie as I am somewhat familiar with the writer Alex Garland (who wrote the story this movie is based on, and ""The Beach"" which I believe was done by the same director as well). Both ""The Beach"" and ""28 Days Later"" reveal Garland's social anxiety, as both show how humans essentially cannot cooperate and always end up ruining things for each other. ""The Beach"" does a much better job at this, for the characters are placed in a situation which is opportune for cooperation, but soon becomes the stuff of Sartre's ""No Exit.""
The hardest aspect of this movie to deal with is that it looked to be the salvation of the theater for this summer, but in my opinion, turned out to be a total dudd.
Definitely not a film I would recommend.",1058400000,6,1661,4.691780821917808
1543251,3,B00005JMA8,"""28 Days Later"" is a rare breed of film in that it attempts to be both art house flick and horror movie rolled into one.  Perhaps a bit surprisingly, the film for the most part succeeds in this undertaking.  It is a horror film that is driven more by suspense and psychological terror than gore, which is refreshing for someone like me, who has never been interested in the typical slasher horror film genre.  ""28 Days Later"" also sets itself apart from the standard horror movie by actually taking the time to develop its characters, giving them background and motivation for their actions as well as developing a sense of  sympathy in the viewer for them.  The film is not without its flaws though, and sometimes suffers from a fairly obvious lack of originality in plot and subject matter.  However, all in all the film does work when seen as a new take on subject matter that has been presented many times before.
The director effectively uses low lighting throughout the film to enhance the sense of claustrophobia and impending terror. His use of quick camera movements and close-ups also convey a sense of the frantic and chaotic while at the same time bringing the viewer into very close contact with the events on the screen.  The crowning achievement of directorial prowess in the film  is without a doubt the breathtakingly eerie shots of an absolutely deserted London.
""28 Days Later"" explores many facets of the dark side of the human psyche, from the obvious use of the ""infected"", who are driven by mindless rage, to some of the seedier characters we meet later in the film, who are driven by more complicated and selfish motivations.  We are faced with the question of what is more evil, the mindless rage of animal instinct, or the well thought out forced control of people for personal gain?  Also, is it greed that pushes these characters to attempt control, or simply the overwhelming drive to satisfy human needs?  When we see certain characters driven by such selfish motivations even in the face of such a crisis situation, we must face the question of whether or not human nature itself is inherently good or evil.
""28 Days Later"" finds its strength in its ability to present such intriguing subplots while still providing a satisfying dose of suspense and terror.",1058313600,3,2288,4.767088607594936

It totally ripped of an old 80's horror moive (think it was called year of the comet) where most the world is killed looking at a comet, a few people are left, they pick up a radio transmission, and follow it to its source to find out it wanst what the expected, sound familiar? Anyways, very slow movie, boring in alot of spots, not enough creatures in the film, and they arnt even the focus of the movie. Deffinitly not enough gore.

If u watch it with 1 friend its not scary its boring trust me i watched so many scary movies with my best friend and the movie [was bad].when i watched the ring one time with alot of my friends i was scared cuz ur friends try to scare you during the movie.

The problem with trying to make a realistic (believable) horror film is that, when you push the boundaries of feasability, you end up with big holes in the very foundation of the movie.  The beginning of 28 Days later does not involve any supernatural forces, undead, or infractions of the laws of physical science.  Instead, 28 Days Later is based on the all too believable premise that a secret (government-created?) virus has been released accidentally by some well-intentioned but misguided animal rights activists.  All too believable, except that it seems unlikely that such a ferocious virus would be contained in a room with less security than Nieman-Marcus.
When our hero, Jim, awakens from a month-long coma, he finds himself naked and completely alone.  He leaves the hospital, probably assuming he's in a dream, and tries to find someone.. anyone.  What he finds are people infected with the virus, which turns them into zombie-type creatures, and he begins to run.  Luckily, he runs into two of the only unifected people in the city, who just so happen to be perfectly happy to save his life.
Then there are a series of bloody encounters with infected people.  All of these scenes are edited in a disoriented fasion, presumably to make the experience more unsettling for the viewer.
The group then drives out to Manchester, where they are hoping to find a rumoured vaccine for the infection.  However, what they find is a bizarre military installation.  At this point the movie takes an entirely new tack, and new dangers are presented.  An unlikely series of events leads to Jim rescuing his two partners from the snares of a fascist-leaning army, in the process of which he releases an infected man into the house where the two women are held captive.  Only a film script could find a way to protect these two unarmed women while the rest of the residents of the home perish.
The first half of this movie I found incredibly depressing.  If it had been some b-movie popcorn flick, it wouldn't have affected me the same, but the dark tone of this film gets under your skin immediately.  The second half is rather silly and at times senseless.  All in all, this is a inspired but disjointed film -- recommended to fatalists and fans of british accents.",1058140800,4,2275,4.829896907216495
1543255,5,B00005JMA8,"This was an interesting story, but many will have problems with the manner in which the characters dealt with the situation.  First, the surviving Londoners appeared to act unilaterally in dealing with this perceived ""crisis"" -- not once did they seek help or approval from the United Nations.  Also, they effectively dehumanized an entire segment of society by labeling them ""the infected,"" which converted them into impersonal targets for shooting, beating and other abusive, discriminatory acts.  In not one instance did a character stop and ask himself, ""Why do they hate us?""  The characters simply attacked the ""infected"" in a pre-emptive fashion, without even attempting to understand their culture, religion or motivation.  In one protractedly violent scene, a group of hungry ""infected"" folks were merely approaching a building in search of food, and the regular characters made the ""infected"" undergo shock and awe by simply gunning them down.
This would have been a much more sensitive film, a vastly more Democrat-minded film if the characters, instead of reflexively killing the ""infected,"" had spent more time doing yoga, visualizing world peace and asking themselves what they had done to make the ""infected"" hate them so.",1058140800,4,1237,5.355670103092783

I wouldnt call the people ""zombies"" but they are something else all together.  I only saw 2 somewhat major plot holes, but otherwise very well made and kinda artsy fartsy.

1543257,5,B00005JMA8,"In a world of road rage, air rage, sidewalk rage and a rage for whatever else you've got, Danny Boyle (Trainspotting) sends a message to everyone with this movie that our anger is out of control and will consume us all.
A cycle courier wakes up in hospital (nod to Day of the Triffids) to find that everyone has become infected with a disease called 'Rage' and the London he knew is a deserted wasteland full of blood-crazed zombies.  He eventually meets up with some allies who were hiding out and together they set off to Manchester after hearing a radio message claiming to have the solution to the problem.
Of course, things aren't that easy and the film brilliantly portrays the madness of solitude as the question arises: what is the point of survival when everyone and everything is dead and gone?
Danny Boyle knows this genre enough to make several nods towards George Romero - the scene in the shoppping mall is an obvious parady of Dawn of the Dead and he also shows that the surviviors end up more crazed and behaving more inhumanely than those infected a la Night of the Living Dead.
It is also full of thought-provoking lines such as when Cillian Murphy first tries to come to terms with the devastation and says ""The government will do something"" to which the reply is: ""There is no government.""
There is also a beautifully directed scene when Cillian is lying on his back in complete desperation and his hazy eyes focus on an airplane flying overhead, like a dove telling him that all is not lost and civilisation is still happening somewhere in the world thus giving him strength.
Those reviewers who balk at the blood and gore (see above) are missing the point this movie is making completely.  It is NOT a slasher Wes/Carpenter flick. When someone cuts you up in your car, nips into the parking space you've been waiting for, takes too long at a checkout or just annoys you in general, what is your reaction?  Rage?
Go see this movie to find out where Rage will lead us all eventually.",1058140800,,2003,4.573816155988858

Cillian is actually smirking on camera when he's supposed to be acting wildly crazed and lost and fearful.  Jim (Ciliam Murphy) has a totally unbelievable reaction to deserted London.  Patrons were walking out of the cinema before the movie had run 30 minutes.  The slow, agonizing start to the movie blended into a boring, boring, tedious job, not an entertaining stunner.  The only reason that I didn't join the patrons walking out was to sneak into the Terminator afterward.  The supposed surprise ending (Jim sees something in the sky as he's being stalked) is as anti-climactic as they get.  The effects couldn't be discerned because of the way they were shot so fast -- a symptom of a low budget flick trying to look like a block buster.

1543320,4,B00005JMA8,"First off, 28 Days Later is billed as a horror movie but if you are expecting ghosts, quaint ogres walking at midnight dripping blood off their ears, or spirits in funny baseball masks, you shouldn't be looking here. The ""horror"" in this movie is crisp and intense, but emerges from the predicament of the characters rather than the usual gory antics of typical Hollywood genre films.
Rarely have I been so frightened and made to think at the same time, and I don't mean only in the cheesy ""Night of the Living Dead"" manner. This movie is a very visceral and scary harbinger of what may lie ahead for humanity, what with all the biological and viral threats that have become commonplace conversation starters these days.
The acting is tight; the musical score clearly shows passionate creation, hear out the samples here on Amazon itself under the Popular Music section to see what I mean; the reel is slightly pixelated/blurry with a colorful strobelight effect resulting from using a deliberately smaller-than-normal frame rate (the whole movie is shot in digital video btw); and the editing techniques sport a very stylized jerking/stroking (remember ""Pi""?). You may relish the movie for just the aesthetics alone, if you are into that sort of thing.
But above all, the film evokes some pretty leery thoughts in almost any person with common sense and a basic awareness of current affairs. It is almost an allegorical warning for things to come.

1543321,1,B00005JMA8,"This is a terrible movie.  I watched it in the theater and was blown away by how cruddy it is.  It starts out quite scary, *not the monkey part, but after*  A man wakes up after a virus was released upon London, and he finds no trace of anyone still alive.  This is fairly scary part, but it goes down hill rapidly from there.  The ""zombies"" are nothing more than a person who has poor cordination, throws up blood, and babbles alot.  They are NOT powerful, undead, or by any means unstoppable.  This creates a very very very unscarry opponent.  They take them out with no problem with just baseball bats. Anyone with a basic knowledge of a martial arts could just stand in the street and fight as many as they like until they needed to take a break.
From what I have above, I would of gave it 2 stars.  What happens next makes me want to give it 0.  They come across a highly trained group of soliders who fight in a team and use good fire control.  These people take the 3 main stars into their fort to live with them.  UNTIL later that night, you find out these soliders just want to have sex with the 2 female characters, well, the main dude aint having that, so he kills them all.  Once it becomes obvious the soliders are bad guys, they loose all the skill they showed earliar.  They fire their guns from their hips, they panic and drop their weapons, and they run around like mice, when just 10 minutes prior they took out 20 plus 'zombies' without any trouble.
The ended was one of the worst I have ever seen.  They sew together a giant ""HELLO"" blanket to lay on the grass so an overpassing jet will radio for help for them.  My first complaint is, why Hello?  Why not HELP or SOS, but HELLO?  Second.. they make mention that the jet has been flying over and not seeing them everytime they sewed something together.  This is bogus, they are out in a pure green grass lands, and a jet pilot searching for surviors would not need to see a 30 foot blanket of HELLO, all they would need to see is a person or even a white flag.

1543322,5,B00005JMA8,"Danny Boyle and Alex Garland have done something special, delivering a smart 'little' thriller about the end of the world (or at least a small portion of it) that is both dark and hopeful.  Well meaning animal activists break into a research facility and release a primate infected with RAGE, a fast acting and easily spread virus that turns its victim into a homicidal maniac.  28 days later Jim, a bike messenger, awakens from a coma to find himself in a deserted hospital.  He makes his way outside and finds the rest of London equally deserted, or so he thinks.  The city, the entire country actually, has been overrun with people infected with RAGE and the few uninfected struggle to survive.  While people have pointed out the numerous parallels to such thrillers as The Day of the Triffids (the novel, not the movie version), The Omega Man, and, most significant, the Dead trilogy created by George A. Romero, what most don't notice is that these homages actually enhance the story rather than detract from it.  The movie had me on the edge of the theater seat, heart pounding, both looking forward to and dreading the next plot development.  While it does not reinvent the 'zombie' movie (it most certainly is NOT a zombie movie) 28 Days Later does show that horror movies can be witty, smart, and harrowing all at once.

1543323,3,B00005JMA8,"Opposing what many of the other reviewers have said, I didn't find this movie very original. In fact, it seemed more of of a remake of ""The Omega Man"" with Charlton Heston, mixed with the Resident Evil game.
The movie is based around some sort of contageous  virouse that effects the world. Somehow one man didn't get infected, and thinks he is the last living human on the planet. He later finds out that he is not, and most other people are rage infested zombies. Which, is very much like the plot of the Omega Man.
Later he goes to a mansion where there are several military personel camping out. (Let's see, zombies, secluded mansion, sounds a lot like Resident Evil).
For those of you looking to see a good zombie move, I would reccomend it. But I give it 3 stars for not giving credit where credit is due.",1057968000,3,811,4.406666666666666
1543324,4,B00005JMA8,"A virus that locks those infected into a permanent state of killing rage, is accidentally released from a British research facility. Carried by animals and humans, the virus is impossible to contain, and spreads across the entire planet. Twenty-eight days later, a small group of survivors are trapped in London, caught in a desperate struggle to protect themselves from the infected. As they attempt to salvage a future from the apocalypse, they find that their most deadly enemy is not the virus, but other survivors.
The film starts brilliantly with a brief prologue in which animal rights activists break into a top secret laboratory to set free the animals held there. Unfortunately, they decide to release a chimpanzee that carries a deadly new virus called Rage. 28 days later, Jim (Cillian Murphy) awakes from a coma in hospital to find the city of London apparently deserted - little does he know that the homicidal victims of Rage are at large across the country. This British variation on the post-apocalyptic zombie movie was scripted by Alex Garland, whose book The Beach had previously been filmed by director Danny Boyle. But where zombies in other movies are slow and crave the taste of human flesh, the red-eyed zombies here sprint around at high speed and are satisfied with merely killing or spreading the virus through bloody vomit. We are told that Britain has been evacuated, so only a few survivors remain to share the country with what's left of the infected population. The streets we see are deserted (there's a nice sequence at the start with Jim wandering alone through the city) and only occasionally will bands of marauding zombies emerge to pick off the uninfected, which makes you wonder where they go to for the rest of the time - the attacks aren't quite relentless enough in their frequency.

The vision of a devastated society is convincingly portrayed, with plenty of pop culture references and brand names to show what has been left behind. There is also nostalgia for lost families; in fact, the people Jim joins up with become surrogate families for him, whether it's with Brendan Gleeson's decent taxi driver and his daughter, or the rather more dysfunctional troop of soldiers headed by Christopher Ecclestone. The soldiers make it clear that now the culture is in ruins the violence inherent in everyone has broken through to the surface, infected or not.
The film carries a few twists to the plot which will keep you interested through-out. The film is well-acted, particularly by Murphy (Disco Pigs), who has a spaced-out quality as an actor that really adds to his role. It`s also filmed on digital video, giving the film a gritty, more realistic feel and distinguishing it from glossy Hollywood horrors such as Scream etc.
This is an excellent film that presents a unique view of London and breathes new life into the zombie genre. In addition, the shocks work brilliantly and there are some truly terrifying moments. Which, let`s face it, is all you really need from a zombie flick. Impressive, atmospheric and very scary, this is an extremely effective British horror movie. Worth going to see. This blows any horror film released this year away. It is te film ""Stephen King's The Stand"" should have been. Highly Recommended.",1057968000,45,3274,4.952727272727273

The beginning starts out a bit slow but soon it takes off at a much faster speed, making it hard to move your eyes at all. One aspect of this film I truly enjoyed was the fact that you could identify with each character, those wanting to survive, those who want happiness again and those who commit evil acts with the understanding that it is neccesary to do. I enjoyed the fact that there was an interacial couple in this film and the fact that this film contained the most vital ingredient to life............ hope.

1543378,5,B00005JMA8,"Although the coming attractions would lead you to believe that this is merely another ""monster"" film, quite the opposite is true. There are at least three major themes in this film which suggest that being ""human"" isn't all that we believe it to be. First, there is the indiscriminate attempt by well meaning folks to ""save"" animals (in this case, chimps), disregarding the warning that the animals have been infected with a deadly virus that causes ""rage"". Contemplating this single theme, one wonders why any laboratory would even consider infecting animals with a virus that doesn't present a widespread danger to the public. The rioting, the epidemic and the resultant effects on humans are sufficient to provide a morality lesson, and the writing and the acting rise to the challenge.
As the film progresses, both the violence with which humans are capable, and the ability of humans to rise above such violence, are beautifully presented by the actors. The desire to find other survivors leads our survivors on a harrowing journey, and the film holds up admirably to the second morality lesson, which teaches us that we are capable of love in times of great stress.
Finally, when our group, somewhat diminished by the dangerous journey and the infected humans they encounter, reach their destination and find a remnant of military firmly entrenched in a compound, we see the unfolding of the third morality lesson. Saftey is not what our group of travelers find, but rather that most (but not all) of these soldiers have lost most of their humanity in their effort at survival.
The acting and direction of this film are excellent. It is a film worth seeing, and I predict that it will become a classic of the genre.",1057881600,,1721,4.897260273972603

Horror is losing it, besides House of 1000 Corpses I can't think of very many good horror movies that have come out lately.

1543380,5,B00005JMA8,"So I went to the theater and saw 28 Days Later, and I have to say, it was much better than I expected.  I was expecting to see the stereotypical zombie horror movie with no plot, poor character development, and the same old gory scenes with people getting chunks of flesh bitten off, which is not the least bit shocking anymore (it's what you call ""outdone).  However, I like the director, Danny Boyle, known for Trainspotting, which is a sweet movie, and this one was pretty well-done as well.  First of all, the film itself was interesting, because it seems like it was shot almost on a digital camera, so it's always just the slightest bit out of focus, and it looks pretty good that way.  Another good thing about the movie is that the writers actually did something that few horror movie makers tend to do anymore:  they slowed down a bit so they could actually develop some characters.  This certainly helps a movie of this type, because if the characters are actually given time to develop over the course of the movie, then you actually end up caring what happens to them in the end.  The other thing that is nice about this one is that the ""zombies"" aren't in the movie every five minutes, which can't be said for anything ever made by George Romero, regardless of whether or not Night of the Living Dead is a ""classic.""  When they are in the movie, the action is pretty good and suspenseful, though.  The basic premise is that a virus called ""Rage,"" which basically turns the infected into a zombie-type being, spreads all across London, infecting almost everyone over the course of 28 days.  After all this has happened, the main character Jim wakes up from a coma in the hospital, finds that he is one of the few survivors, and meets up with others, and together they try to mke it to a military outpost which promises salvation while fighting off the infected.

1543381,4,B00005JMA8,"Danny Boyle's newest offering features hundreds of flesh-eating undead, but that's just above the surface. Essentially '28 Days Later' is a post-apocalyptic psychological thriller focusing on the actions and mental states of the survivors, as they struggle to survive in a now hostile environment.
Jim wakes up in a deserted hospital, 28 days after an infectious virus (rage) spreads through all of Britain. He wanders through London, now an eerie ghost town, until finally meeting up with other survivors. And this, I feel, is when the real story emerges. As the film progresses, it becomes painfully clear that zombies are not the real threat to Jim, Selena, and Hannah.
This ""who are the real monsters?"" theme is an excellent twist, and so much scarier than disintegrating zombies. That Jim himself is forced to act monstrously in order to save Selena and Hannah only enriches the film's message.
Some of the character's personality changes puzzled me, however. Some of the other reviewers mentioned Jim's transformation from scared, physically weak boy to a military-defeating super-hunter. But I feel that the changes to Selena's character is even stranger. At the beginning of the film, Selena is a calculated, efficient zombie killer, someone who seems like she can handle ANY situation. Are we really supposed to believe that by falling in love with Jim, Selena's reduced to another girly girl unable to save herself and Hannah from the real monsters?
That aside, '28 Days Later' is an excellent study of human nature in a post-apocalyptic setting. There are also plenty of gorgeous, haunting scenes of Britain as urban wasteland, scenes that will stay with you long after leaving the theatre.",1057622400,,1701,5.166666666666667

Boy was I wrong...

#1  This movie is a clumsy social commentary, not a horror movie, as it is billed.  All plot elements are subsumed to this goal.  Characters act out of character, and the plot lurches towards the end statement envisioned by the writer/director.  Watch this movie if you want to appear intelligent/deep/profound.

#2  If I'd known that Danny Boyle was also responsible for the freakshow known as ""The Beach,"" I never would have seen this movie.  The ""28 days"" plotline is ripped off from that movie. Ah, yes, all of us are barely held in check by society/civilization... we'd break loose, rape/kill/rampage, without society's constraints.  Boyle might have well as used Leonardo DiCaprio as ""Jim,"" except leave the headband at home while filming the rampage at the end.

#3  Can we have some intelligent characters in the movie?  Is it required to have bumbling heroes that survive only through dumb luck?  Would YOU light a candle in front of open windows, while zombies are prowling outside?  Is it too much to ask that they not wander off alone? Can they plan ahead?  Would they really have a picnic in a countryside crawling with zombies? In a city full of abandoned vehicles, would they really take the worst one available?  Should it take a third of the movie before it occurs to them to USE a vehicle?  All of those characters should have been dead early on in the movie.  Plot/Message was clearly more important than characters.

#4  The Soldiers.  [Sigh!!]  All of them are rapists (save one) only a month after the fall of civilization?  Is that the Message of the movie?  Men are only held in check by civilization?  Otherwise, they'd take their nasty guns and ravish the local womenfolk?  If you high-brow 5-star reviewers truly think that, it's time to come back down to reality.  There are plenty of decent people out there, civilization or not.

Aspiring directors, why did I rate this movie 2 stars, and not One?

*  The background concept for the movie was sound.
*  The quality of the actual filming was well-done.
*  The actors weren't bad, just saddled with bad script/direction.

In the hands of a director (as opposed to a preacher), ""28 Days"" had the potential to be a fine film.",1057622400,43,2491,4.819905213270142
1543383,5,B00005JMA8,"Going into 28 Days Later, I knew little of what to expect. I'd read reviews online explaining how it was mainly a drama with a horror backdrop, but the American trailers and tv spots led to believe that it was a downright horror film with tons of gore to boot. What I got was the first option, a drama with a horror backdrop. And I found it absolutely amazing.
 A delivery boy wakes up after being in a coma for 28 days to discover the world he knew is now gone, and has been replaced with empty streets littered with dead bodies, and the occasional lunatic trying to kill him. When he's rescued by a pair of what seem at first rip-off commandos from Resident Evil, he is informed that a worldwide virus has wiped off most of humanity, and has made a majority of humanity insane individuals that live off of rage. Now they must rely on each other to survive.
  Danny Boyle has made this film a solid metaphor for today's world, and even states that in the movie of how screwed up people could be. Even when they should be helping one another. This brought a deeper meaning to the movie, and actually made me enjoy it more.
  One word that popped up in my mind while watching the ""climatic showdown"" was ""subtle."" 28 Days Later is very subtle. In it's storyline, action, and pacing. The acting by mostly little known actors was on. Noah Huntley, although at times boring, was pretty good and kept me interested. The star of the movie for me was Naomie Harris.

The idea of a virus that can kill those around you by turning them into a zombie is horrifying. 28 Days Later may turn into the sleeper hit of the summer.  ...  You can always tell how well a movie was liked once it is over and you are walking out.  Everyone was extremely quiet.  It seemed the movie had touched a nerve.
For months I turned away from the commercials for 28 Days Later as I usual do when an interesting movie trailer begins broadcasting. Its because many times the trailers convey a different idea or show all the interesting parts spoiling the experience. This situation was an excellent decision.  I had no idea what to expect.  All the actors are relatively unknown but are great. The grainy texture was a lack of funds but works great to add another dimension especially thriller/horror films.  Its few and far between that movies come out like this. It reminds me of Halloween.  All the actors were unknown and the film grossed nothing the first weeks only to grow as the great horror movie every filmed.  This is a must see.

  Waiting with much anticipation to see this hyped up film, I could not imagine that after seeing so many horror movies, that I could still be deeply disturbed and sickened by someone else's image of horror.
  The film has outstanding imagery, sound, and almost all of the characters, save a few of the soldiers, are compelling. I think other reviewers have made enough of the plot known, so I won't go into that. But as you watch the movie, you can't help but get tied up into the main characters and feel for them as the nightmarish reality of their world falls on them.

1543460,2,B00005JMA8,"Points: The movie is stupid and pointless. Its entire first half is a rip off of THE OMEGA MAN and its entire second half is a rip off of Romero's DAY OF THE DEAD. (For God's sake, they even have a zombie tied up ala Bub in DEAD; I guess it wasn't enough that they made the soldiers crazy just like DEAD.) Romero's DAY OF THE DEAD and DAWN OF THE DEAD not only ALREADY explored the notion of man being more dangerous than the zombies, but he did it much better. Here, the acting in the second half is all farce. Can't take none of it seriously.
As to the first half: QUESTIONS: Where are the bodies? Where are the cars? 28 days later, and all of the victims of the plague simply ""vanish""? And why are the zombies afraid of light? Did the virus also make them think they're vampires? Also, if the zombies are homicidal and has lost all sense (they don't even eat food, thus starving to death), isn't it nice that they only attack the un-infected people. Gee, they sure don't act very psychotic to me.
28 DAYS LATER should have been called THE OMEGA DEAD, since it's just a rip off of both movies. For God's sake, if you're going to so blatantly steal, then at least offer up a wink and a nod that you ARE doing it. Don't run with it and act as if you made it up all by your little lonesome.
The worst part of it? No one seems to realize that 28 DAYS LATER is such a poorly disguised rip-off. I guess it's true what they say after all: The American public IS stupid and easily duped.

1543461,1,B00005JMA8,"Now let me see if I've got this straight. A virus has been released that is so fast acting and potent that completely eradicates any need to explain what it is as well as the plot of this movie. We do not know why zombies have red eyes, hate the sun (are they vampire zombies)? Or why they have to puke their guts out!(Are they bulemic)? We then come across a man named Tim lying in a hospital bed completely naked. Apparently the hospitals in England (or where ever it was) don't dress their patients in hospital gowns or even cover them up in sheets. He is apparently there for a head wound that isn't even bandaged up.
ANYWAY he gets out of bed, finds some clothes and goes wandering the steets that have been deserted yelling ""Hello?"" to nobody. This is the only dialogue spoken for what seemed liked 10-15 minutes. Despite the fact that there are no cops around he gets scared off by a car alarm.
ANYWAY he goes into a church where he finds a massive group of bodies laying there. As it turns out they are zombies because our guy yells ""Hello?"" and wakes them up.(Zombies need sleep?)After fending off a zombie priest, he takes to the streets again and wanders them until he comes across 2 people still alive but who very nearly kill him because they think he's a zombie. They then go to Tim's parents' house. Tim's parents are lying peacefully dead in their bedroom. But at least they were considerate enough to leave him a note before they died! After they've raided the pantry, zombies burst in and are easily killed by the film's heroine. After they leave Tim's parents' house they go off in search of more survivors. They eventually find a man and his daughter in an apartment complex. They are able to find them because the guy and his daughter put up Christmas lights outside their window which is completely visible from the street. And they wonder why so many zombies find them!
ANYWAY they discover a radio transmission broadcast by what sounds like the military and the promise of salvation. So they set out trying to find this place riding along the countryside (and not seeing a single zombie in sight).
 Along the way they get a flat tire in a tunnel filled with abandoned cars. With zombies bearing down on them they make the fastest tire change in history with the 13 year old girl tightening down the lugnuts.(She's strong!) This European car thens climbs on top of and drives over an entire gridlock full of cars!!! Maybe the rage virus got into the engine and turned it into A RAGIN' MONSTER TRUCK!!!
And despite the fact that they could not hide from the zombies in the most obscure places they are somehow able to sleep outdoors in the great wide open completely unbothered!!!
Eventually, they find a group of military vehicles. The father turns into a zombie when a single drop of infected blood falls from somewhere and hits him right in the eye. BULLSEYE!!!The soldiers appear out of nowhere and gun down the father. The soldiers then take Tim, the heroine, and the daughter to a house being used as a compound. We then learn the real reason the soldiers put out that radio signal is because they're [lonely]! They want the heroine and the daughter (who looks all of 13 years old) for sex. Tim decides that isn't right so he starts a fight with the soldiers and releases a zombie the soldiers had been keeping as a pet. The zombie has fun feasting on the soldiers. Chaos ensues, and eventually they make their getaway in their car driven by the daughter who plows right into a cast iron fence with a big chain on it. Don't worry, they all survive and live happily ever after in a nice farmhouse that doesn't have any bedsheets because they've stitched them all together in a big sign that says HELLO.

1543462,5,B00005JMA8,"""28 Days Later"" is the best zombie film I have ever seen. The opening begins with a riot and a group of animal right activists taking monkeys out of an experimental lab. But, what they don't know about the monkeys is that they are infected with a virus that makes a person into a crazed cannibal, or has they are really known as zombies. The main character, Jim, played by Cillian Murphy, who is a bike courier who wakes up at a hospital 28 days after the virus was released. He went into the hospital to have brain surgery before the virus was released because when he was delivering a package when he ended up in the hospital. When he goes around the city, he goes into a church and wakes up some zombies. Then he runs into two survivors, Selena, played by Naomie Harris, and Mark, played by Noah Huntley, who saves him from the zombies that were chasing him down one of the streets in the city. They go to Jim's house and that is where Mark gets infected and Selena kills him. When walking to a safe haven, Jim and Selena sees Christmas lights that are signaling any uninfected survivors to come up there for safety. While trying to get there, Zombies appear. Jim and Selena run from them, then, thanks to Frank and his daughter, Hannah, they were safe. The next day, they hear a broadcast on Frank's handradio to come to Manchester to get away from the zombies. On the way, in a tunnel, they, in Frank's taxi, climb over cars in order to get to Manchester. One of the tires popped and Frank and Hannah had to change the tire. And in there, see rats running from the zombies and that is when they rush to get the tire on in time before they are near them. They get out of there, but, later, Frank is infected by a drop of blood. And that's when they are spotted by a group of soldiers run by Major Henry West, played by Christopher Eccleston. During that time, it is when Jim, Selena, and Hannah discover that the real monsters aren't the zombies, but the soldiers themselves. The ending is too good for words, but I am not going to tell you anymore of this excellent zombie movie. Danny Boyle's directing is extremely brilliant, Cillian Murphy as Jim is smart and intelligent and heartwarming as well as Naomie Harris' Selena is. Brendan Gleeson's performance is extremely heartwarming and emotional as Frank, the grief-stricken father of Hannah. Megan Burns' performance as Hannah is excellent without compromise. But the performance that takes the prize is Christopher Eccleston's. His performance as the crazy Major Henry West is an remarkable performance for a villain ever. John Murphy's score for the movie is encouraging and smart at its best. The production design, the costume design, the visual/make-up effects, the cinematography, the editing is extremely well done at its best just like the rest of the movie is.

1543464,4,B00005JMA8,"The makers of '28 Days Later' claim to redefine the zombie film genre with this offering, and by this standard, they've certainly failed. '28 Days Later' doesn't cover any new ground, but it is a good film of its type, and features real characters instead of the usual comic book/video game caricatures, ala 'Resident Evil' and 'Matrix: Reloaded.'
Appropriately, this film starts out on a violent, ironic note, and then proceeds to the 'waking up in a lonely hell' scene. The beginning is very artsy-- and unlike other films of the same type, I felt like I was following a real person through the expected post-apocalyptic landscape. (Yes, the buildings are still there-- it's the people who've been ruined.) Of course this wasn't anything I hadn't seen or read before. The entire film reeks of Stephen King's 'The Shining,' and follows firmly in the footsteps of 'Night of the Living Dead' and its sequals. As the film progresses, it loses some of its artsy flavor, and focuses on the hopes and fears of the characters.
The characters in this film aren't particularly charismatic, but they're believable. That's a refreshing change from the usual MTV influenced garbage I've come to expect.
By the end of the picture, you've learned the same lessons you'll learn by watching the superior 'Night of the Living Dead:' 1/To fight the zombies, human beings must band together, and 2/human beings banding together doesn't always work, because at the end of the day it's the living who are the real monsters.
Like I said, this picture doesn't cover any new ground; but it is a worthy addition to the pantheon of zombie films, and I recommend it. It is a little long, but the soundtrack's pretty good.

After the plot began to develop, it was recognizable as ""The Omega Man"" with a twist. But it was like fresh air to see characters with distinctly recognizable personalities with depth who were reacting to traumatic situations in a believable way.

1543467,4,B00005JMA8,"I've read all the other reviews and agree with most points--28 Days Later was a fresh addition to the horror genre, especially due to Boyle's artistic approach. Personally, I've never seen a so-called ""zombie"" flick that I considered beautiful, which this movie certainly is. However, I also see that the idea of survival in this movie is a tad unmotivated. Characters never really discussed procreation--the army men did not seem as concerned with repopulating the world as they did with ""getting their women"". On the other hand, I really did like how it turned out, as in most ""zombie"" movies, that men are ultimately more evil than the enemy. Take the army men for example, who had tied up one of their own men to ""study"" the Rage disease. It seemed more like torture to me. Plus, Jim ended up doing more harm to the soldiers than the infected did. Displaying how wicked men can be added a very humane twist to the story. Obviously, the warm and fuzzy ending was liked by some and hated by others. I, being a sucker for such endings, liked it and appreciated the hope it instilled.
My main point in writing this review was to highlight something that has been grossly neglected--the soundtrack. The songs in this film--led by Brian Eno, Blue States, and Grandaddy--were awesome. John Murphy's original compositions are also not to be overlooked. The music provides a surreal, eerie, and ephermeral quality to the film, making it (as I said before) beautiful.
So, see the film--if only to listen to the soundtrack!",1057104000,,1516,4.790076335877862
1543527,4,B00005JMA8,"With SARS, Anthrax, Mad Cow Disease, Rampant Terrorism and AIDS on the news nightly, the world of Danny Boyle's ""28 Days Later"" with its flesh-eating Zombies is not at all far fetched.
Arguably, the classic Zombie movie is George Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"" which today seems quaint and even cartoonish while ""28"" is so close to today's reality that it frightens and creeps you out because its milieu is so familiar: nature seeking revenge by bringing about a scourge upon the human race that can be traced back many of hundreds of years and manifested in the Plagues brought on by Rats. In fact, there is a disgusting and frightening scene in a tunnel in which thousands of rats fleeing a town preclude the attack of a pack of Zombies that recalls a similar eerie scene in ""Nosferatu.""
In a film of this kind, the ""humans"" usually play a backseat to the monsters but Alex Garland (the screenwriter) and Boyle have casted and written very carefully as Cillian Murphy and Naomie Harris as Jim and Selena respectively bring a humane truthfulness to their roles without which the film would have no viable heroes and emotional center for which we can root.
""28 Days Later"" is frightening because it seems too plausible, too possible, too much of a logical extension of our current world situation. Danny Boyle has fashioned a film that is as much a comment on our lives of cell phones, fouled oceans and endangered species as anything on the 24-hour news channels: watch out, beware, think about what you are doing he's saying... everything has a consequence.",1057104000,3,1564,4.7749077490774905
1543528,4,B00005JMA8,"28 Days Later... (Danny Boyle, 2002)
28 Days Later... immediately establishes two things: first, that Alex Garland's screenplays are equally as brilliant as his novels (and, as a sidelight, that Danny Boyle letting John Hodge adapt Garland's luscious novel The Beach was an even worse crime than we first thought). Second, that Danny Boyle, given a script with an actual plot, a goal, and enough meat is, in fact, capable of making a good movie.
Hot on the heels of these revelations, as I sat through the film for the second time on Sunday afternoon (and this is the first film I have gone to see twice on opening weekend in over a quarter of a century), I realized why the Hollywood machine will never, ever be able to make a film even remotely resembling 28 Days Later.... But more on that, well, later.
There has been a good deal of criticism about this movie, and it doesn't surprise me in the least. England has long been the bastion of low-budget horror that achieves a kind of brilliance 28 Days Later... reminded me most in critical reaction of another low-budget horror film from England twenty years ago called XTRO. XTRO is unimaginably brilliant, but like 28 Days Later..., it's not structured like your normal horror film; you get hit with a brick wall at the beginning of the film, and you get hit with a brick wall at the end of the film. The middle contains a few jumps, but is mostly concerned with building plot, characterization, and mystery. (More mainstream filmgoers should be recognizing the pacing by now-the same type of structure was used in both Ringu and Saving Private Ryan.) In other words, it's bound to alienate both the ""regular"" American horror film fan, who's used to the ""scares"" coming thick and fast throughout, and the ""cerebral"" American horror fan, who's used to getting his disturbances from the creep factor and not the gore factor. And to be honest, I'm surprised the film's audiences have been as large as they have (it landed solidly in fourth place this week, behind three films which all were playing at over twice the number of screens). It's almost enough to get me to write Harry Bromley Davenport and tell him that now's the time to re-release XTRO on the big screen. It might have finally found its audience.
Aside from the excellent performances (main characters Cillian Murphy and Naomie Harris, and Harris wonderful turns by Boyle regular Christopher Eccleston, the excellent and highly underrated Brendan Gleeson, and Megan Burns), much has been made of Boyle's use of digital photography to shoot the film. Good idea, indeed. The whole thing comes up with an odd quality that is both documentary (zombies in flames can almost be smelled in the theater) and surreal (as Murphy and co. are driving by a field of rotting roses, a guy behind me asked, ""is that a painting?""). The film is also layered in its presentation, as any good zombie film since the seventies has been; it asks all the questions a zombie film should ask and still manages to make them come off sounding like we haven't heard them before. Boyle has finally found the right film to posit his seeming deep loathing of the human race, which he attempted to bring to the forefront of both Trainspotting and The Beach without a shred of success. Here, it comes through with crystal clarity.
What should have emerged from this review is, overall, a single word: different. This is not your mindless summer blockbuster. This is a film that will make you think, require repeated viewings to catch things you missed the first time, stick in your head long after it's over (probably longer than you want it to), and above all will make you uncomfortable. (And not just with horror; the gore factor is far more suggested than explicit. It's little things like Cillian Murphy's first appearance in the movie being a full-frontal nude shot, which had murmurs of discomfort going through the audience. ""We didn't need to see that,"" the guy behind me said. Yeah, we DID. That's the whole point.) And that was what hit me, when not long after my second viewing I found myself listening, somewhat revolted, to songs on the radio by the winners of American Idol. I loathe the show, and could never really figure out why until then. America, when given the choice, will vote for sameness every time. Reuben and Kelly do not sound markedly different than anything else you're likely to hear on your local soft rock station. And most of the films you're likely to see this summer are not markedly different than those you saw last summer. And 28 Days Later... is above all different. You may have seen every film which is paid homage by various scenes here (and you will likely get more out if it if you've at the very least seen A Clockwork Orange, Dawn of the Dead, Platoon, XTRO, most importantly The Omega Man, and probably fifteen to twenty other movies that aren't coming to mind right now), but you've still never seen it done quite like this.
All that said, 28 Days Later... is not a great film. It's a very good one, but not a great one. Boyle isn't flaunting the genre's conventions enough to cross the line into true greatness, and there are things about the movie which give away Boyle as a novice horror director (for example, we don't get much information about Rage, but we get too much early to achieve the spooky ambience of Carpenter's The Fog, without getting a full explanation by the end to really drive the horror home, like in Poltergeist). Still, so far it's a shoo-in to make the year's ten best. ****",1057104000,5,5532,4.686536485097636

1543530,3,B00005JMA8,"I'm glad to see this kind of movie given a decent budget and put in major theater chains.  In a time when I Know What You Did Last Summer, Scream and The Sixth Sense are thought of as ""horror"" films, it's pleasing to see an honest, back-to-basics horror film like this.  The only other one this year being House Of 1000 Corpses.  This movie has it's shortcomings, but I like the effort.  This movie's basically a Frankenstein-type movie in the sense that it's made up of pieces and ideas(sometimes whole scenes!) from other ""last people on earth"" horror movies.  There are pieces of Dead Alive, Night/Dawn/Day Of The Dead, The Stand, The Quiet Earth, Demons, The Crazies and the Resident Evil game to name a few.  Yes, we all know that a guy wakes up from a coma to realize that he's left in a city of living dead monsters.  He teams up with a few other survivors, ends up at a mansion with some soldiers, tra-la, tra-la.  Naturally, these military guys have a sinister agenda, but that's not much of a surprise coz the military ALWAYS does in this kind of film.  The ""zombies"" aren't the Romero ones you're used to, they don't even eat anyone really.  They're infected with rage, so they like to beat, claw, stomp, strangle, puke up blood, etc.  They actually look and act alot like the demons from Lamberto Bava's Demons films(minus the claws and fangs of course).  I have three main gripes with this: 1)  The streets aren't cluttered with cars like they should be(with the exception of the tunnel).  A massacre like this would leave abandoned cars all over the city, but I guess the zombies moved them or something, coz our heroes have a clear path everywhere they drive.  2).  I don't care what anyone says, but a happy ending in this kind of film leaves a real bad taste in my mouth.  3)  It's a little more flashy and stylish than this kind of film should be.  Is it scary?  Depends on how many of the aforementioned films you've seen.  The ""scares"" here consist of zombies suddenly crashing through windows or doors, making the audience mess their trousers and leaving them looking around to see if anyone saw them jump.  That's about as scary as it gets if you're fluent in zombie flicks.  If you're not, it can go either way.  I've heard people say it's very scary and others say it's dumb, so I can't answer that one.  It's got a great and scary concept though.",1057017600,,2371,4.496487119437939
1543531,5,B00005JMA8,"American marketing unfortunately touts this as a horror film...which it is!  But it is so much more.
This is not your run-of-the-mill Freddy Kreuger or Jason Vorhees slasher.  It's a story with heart and emotion, to use an overused cliche.
A deadly virus named ""Rage"" is accidentally released as animal rights activists become infected as a result of their efforts to release monkeys undergoing extremely cruel experimentation.  I seem to recall several in the audience laughing when the scientist who tries to stop them explains that they are infected with ""rage"", and I'm saddened to think those who laughed completely missed one of major themes of the movie which I will delve into later.
Fast forward 28 days to Jim who wakes up from a coma in the middle of a deserted hospital.  He slowly comes to realize that the entire city of London appears to be deserted.  ...  One of the elements that the movie brings out is that our world would be better off if we could eradicate ""rage"" from our society.  It also brings up the theme that ""rage"" cannot be caged as is metaphorically brought up in the opening scene.
What is so endearing about this movie at times is the camarderie and happy times occasionally shared by the survivors in their desparate attempt to survive.  The love that they eventually share for each other is especially heartbreaking when one or another falls prey to the evil that surrounds them.
There are so many aspects of this film and I hope I touch on some of the more memorable ones:
1.  First and foremost, the shooting of the film on digital film lending a home-movie feel to everything is bold and it works.  The gritty feel to everything brings a considerable edginess to the film.
2.  Some of the visual shots, while understated, are exquisite.  As one example, the taxi that our survivors head north in pass by flowers that look like a pastel painting.
3.  Other shots are subtle.  One scene has a survivor hiding behind a mirror...and it's almost as if she is holding up a mirror to RAGE.  The ""infected"" studies the mirror for a considerable time and although some might think he is considering whether or not someone is hiding there, others might infer that it is difficult for one to face oneself and it is only the possible incredulity of such behavior that brought out a brief human response of self-study.

I was hoping to see a very scary movie.....it turned out i saw a movie that could of been very good or very bad..it was very bad. while the specail effects(of the zombies) were very good indeed, but the story was very slow! this film did deliver a creepy way of transforming humans into zombies and a very creepy way the zombies attack he humans.

What many reviewers were saying was that it was the scariest movie since ""The Ring"" but lets face it, this a bedtime story compared to The Ring. But as soon as I got over the fact that is wasn't scary, I really enjoyed it. The filming technique of this movie is truly unique and added a lot to the feel of the movie. The acting and editing of the movie were also stellar, I really loved Jim (Cillian Murphy)and I felt like there wasn't a weak character in the whole movie. But, I'd say the MVP of this movie would have to go to the music, this movie had the greatest soundtrack of any movie I've ever seen. My personal favorite was the song that was playing while he was wandering through england and it was completely empty. Overall it was a brilliant movie with great music and a very tasteful amount a gore (Highlighting one scene where Jim grabs a soldier by the head, sticks his thumbs into his eye sockets and repeatedly smashes his head against a brick wall) All in all, I highly recomend this movie for anyone who enjoys violent thrillers, actually no, I changed my mind I reccomend it to Everyone.",1056931200,,1264,4.382978723404255
1543534,4,B00005JMA8,"""28 Days Later"" by British director Danny Boyle (of ""Trainspotting"" and ""Shallow Grave"" fame) arrives with perfect timing for this paranoid post-9/11, post-Iraq world, seething in post-millennium tension.
Set in modern-day Britain, three PETA-like animal rights activists in ski masks slip into a government medical facility in Cambridgeshire, where they are instantly shocked to see monkeys caged in a research room, subjected to endless TV coverage of riots, looting and civil wars around the globe. Believing that they`re doing the ethical thing, they begin to release the creatures while the shouts of an intervening frantic doctor yelling they're infected go ignored. Suddenly released, the monkeys turn on the activists under the deafening pounding of the still-caged monkeys' fists.
Twenty-eight days later, a twenty-something bike currier named Jim (played by excellent new-comer Cillian Murphy) wakes up from a deep coma in a London hospital after being in an auto accident. Immediately, he notices that the room is empty; food, chairs and tables are scattered all over the floors. He slips on some doctors clothes and ventures around the hospital, finding it devoid of anyone. Curious, he travels outside, noticing that this city of twelve million people is eerily deserted and quiet. Big Ben and Parliament are empty. Piccadilly Circus is devoid of people except for scattered newspapers and overturned double-decker red buses. The war monuments have no tourists. Notice boards are filled with letters and pictures of lost loved ones. He picks up a newspaper from the ground, announcing headlines that read the world is dead, dying, or going crazy from a virus called Rage, that government and civil services have collapsed, and that London is either dead or evacuated. Dismayed and in numb shock, Jim ventures into a church to find it stocked-filled with corpses of all ages and professions. He yells hello at the sea of bodies. A few stagger up: their eyes red, their mouths covered with blood, their speech nothing more than primordial growls. Like the worse nightmare you've he's ever had, they begin to chase him, making Jim flee for his life.
So begins the first twenty minutes of ""28 Days Later."" Director Boyle's opening scenes of a deserted London are truly remarkable and grimly beautiful. If you've ever been to London, you know how absolutely busy it can be at any time of the day, but to see it devoid without using any special effects is a true achievement for Boyle. It harkens images that one might get when reading ""The Stand,"" ""Day of the Triffids,"" or ""Earth Abides."" Considering that ""28 Days"" was shot all on a digital camera (done very professionally and definitely not ""Blair Witch Project""-ish), it lends a documentary feel to the film, where the camera adds grimy detail to the deserted buildings and an utterly destroyed Britain, all seemingly done to make this film frighteningly realistic. ...In all, this film is wonderfully acted by a group of promising young stars, with great sweeping cinematography and well-matched Brit-rock that fit the scenes perfectly. Despite the overall somber nature of the flick, there's moments of that all too-familiar ironic British sense of black humor interspersed with moments of jump-out-of-your-seats suspense, creepiness, and food for thought about the primordial instinct of violence itself. By far, this is not your traditional horror film by any means. This is a film that will stick in your head for days, and might perhaps make it hard to sleep at night.",1056931200,,3537,5.16376306620209
1543535,4,B00005JMA8,"It's easy to get numbed by the movies that dominate the theaters. Those that are entertaining, tend to be mildly so.  Those that have even slightest provocative content ordinarily end in silliness, or, worse yet, overwrought self-parody.  But when I was least expecting it, 28 Days Later hit me like a baseball bat across the side of the head.  Except for an ending that seemed tacked on and unnecessary (I would have much preferred an ending where there is dramatic freeze frame--you'll know it when you see it--about 5 to 10 minutes before the real ending), this is film that is a wonder of excellent acting, fine storytelling, and profound intellectual metaphor.  And it couldn't be more timely with the media echoing with tales of super-bugs, monkey pox, ebola, and SARS.  But this movie isn't about a virus, it's about human nature.  About who and what we really are.  And how quickly that true nature could be revealed if a thread-bare social structure were to unravel for ANY reason.
You should simply watch this movie.  Pay attention to the low-budget artistry that abounds (it is pitch perfect), the gorgeous cinematography, and the sets.  And to who the real monsters are.  I kept thinking about the riots in this country, and how they reveal something about how close we are to being brutal animals--and that we do a great job of tricking ourselves into believing that we're more than acquisitive brutes.  Keep hope alive, I suppose.",1056931200,,1444,4.853061224489796
1543606,1,B00005JMA8,"I agree that the premise was great, and there were really good visual effects (e.g., the empty English cities), but I was expecting a movie that was going to SCARE me (that WAS the claim, remember?), or, at the least, be chock full of zombies and gore.  On both of these it failed.  This is the reason I think the movie stunk like rotting cheese you forgot at the bottom right corner of your refrigerator from seven months back.
Bottom line: if you are into ""artsy-fartsy"" type zombie movies then definitely see this movie.  If you want to be scared and see tons of zombies and gore, go with one of your favorite classics, DO NOT pay to see this tripe.",1056931200,3,652,4.371900826446281
1543607,5,B00005JMA8,"I am no fan of zombie movies, but 28 DAYS LATER is not exactly what I'd call a zombie movie, but rather a  well crafted, apocalyptic tale of the end of humanity - so to speak.  When a virus created by the government called Rage gets set loose upon the populace of Britain by animal rights activists who ""think"" they are doing good, the entire country's population quickly becomes infected.  The virus is spread by a victim's infected blood (which they tend to spew up uncontrollably)  entering the body of another persons (through the mouth, nose, eyes, or a cut), which then completely overtakes them within 20 seconds.  Jim, who has been in a coma since before the outbreak, suddenly awakens in the hospital and begins his confusing search for answers in the eerily deserted streets of London.  He quickly finds them as he encounters infected multitudes in a church and is rescued by a couple of un-infected survivors named Selena and Mark.  That is simply the basic opening premise to the film, not the whole story!
The movie introduces you to several well developed characters that you will really come to care for as the story progresses.  You really are concerned over who may die, or what the group's fate will ultimately be.  Basically, you will be drawn into their struggle for survival, as well as enjoying the lighter moments as the group bonds and becomes more like a small family.  There are many unexpected incidents that keep you guessing throughout the entire movie, creating a very unnerving mood overall.  Filled with disturbing images and ideas, this movie will definitely leave you with lots to think about after the credits roll.  These are the signs of a film succeeding on a higher level than most these days.
The visual style of the movie is not to be ignored either.  Danny Boyle's choice to film it using a Digi-Cam was brilliant.  It adds to the realism of the entire film, bringing to light the loneliness of the world around.  The horrific scenes depicting Rage-infected men, women, or even children crawling and running up towards the camera are terror inducing and really manage to drive the horror of the character's situation home.  Director Boyle also masterly crafts some very surreal dream sequences for Jim that perfectly depicts what pent up worry and fear can cause the mind to imagine.  All of this is capped off by a well written score that compliments the film in every way, from the intense and very stressful scenes to the quieter, character driven moments.  Very impressive work overall!
Some may not like the ending, but after all that these characters have been through it was nice to walk away from this film with some happiness and hope.  Not everyone could have pulled off such an idea, but it works well here.  It is a relief not to be stuck with a shock-value ending, or some weird twist in the story during the last frame that seems to have become common place in movies of this genre.  I recommend this film to everyone who is old enough to see it.  28 DAYS LATER is truly an artistic masterpiece that actually dares to have a  point behind it!",1056931200,12,3098,4.685767097966728
1543608,5,B00005JMA8,"I usually have little faith in horror movies, because almost all of them try to frighten their audience by substituting large amounts of gore and grotesque costumes for genuine acting.  While this film does contain gore and violence, the actors did far more than simply scream and stand around to get eaten or killed.  Cillian Murphy, who I've never seen in another movie, proved that he can act very well, and he does an excellent job of seeming frightened and confused at the beginning.  The imagery in this film is great: a totally deserted London, carnage and corpses littering the streets and buildings, et cetera.  The plot did not initially seem to be original, but it quickly becomes a film that stands out from its counterparts.  The ""infected"" people are like zombies, but they are really living people that simply feel the need to kill.  Like the interpretation of the rogue army squad's commander, the film can be seen as an analogy to everyday life--""people killing people,"" which seems to be normal.  I thought that the more frightening sequences were the ones that made me use my imagination, such as when Serena's friend that helps rescue Jim after he flees the church describes his family's attempt to board an airplane when a mob of people is trying to do the same.  The ending with the soldiers did feel like a different movie, but it went with the plot, and was probably better than some crazy attempt to wipe out the infected people, which would have ended up being ludicrous.  If you are thinking of seeing a movie, go see this one, because it is one of the better new films I have seen in a while.",1056931200,3,1620,4.636363636363637
1543609,4,B00005JMA8,"This movie was good. It kept me entertained but I thought the directing was cheap and poorly done. The zombies however made up for this. They were terrific and life like! It wasn't as scary as I suspected but I jumped maybe once, but it was pretty graphic.

1543610,5,B00005JMA8,"What's scarier than thousands of zombie-like creatures chasing you through the streets of an abandoned city with only the though of killing you on their minds? Why our own human nature of course. ""28 Days Later..."" is a fantastic combination of sci-fi and horror that goes straight for the jugular (no pun intended) and never once lets up. The best way to describe this film is this manner: take one part ""Day Of The Dead,"" add a pinch of ""The Omega Man,"" stir in a dash of ""Lifeforce"" and blend on high. The resulting mixture will be oh so good. This movie is one of the bleakest and most violent films I have seen since the aforementioned Romero gore-fest ""Day Of The Dead."" People who could not stomach this film will never be able to sit through the nauseating finale of ""D.O.T.D."" The actors, mostly unknowns, did a wonderful job in this film - especially the gorgeous Naomie Harris. The no-nonsense attitude of Harris' character was not B-Movie, but realistic - she cares for her survival and her survival alone. After all, why wouldn't she? Thats what any of us would do when the stuff went down. The graphic violence of the film will turn off the general moviegoer who has no previous ""zombie"" film experience. In fact, this really isn't even a true-blue ""zombie"" film, the infected just exert sheer madness and rage, not the typical cannabalism that zombies posess. But, more terriying than the infected is the way that humans react when their backs are up against the wall and faced with extinction. When our Harris-led band of five survivors end up at a military base, all seems well. But, as if a page were torn from Romero's ""D.O.T.D.,"" the soldiers are more evil and dangerous than the infected. This leads of course to the obligatory, and quite nail-biting, gory conclusion. The only thing about this film that I didn't like was the hokey ending. Much like the original theatrical cut of ""Blade Runner"" the ending of this film tried to make a happy ending out of a seemingly bleak world. I think that a better ending would have been if (SPOILER AHEAD) the jet fighter had circled back and dropped a bomb on Selena, Hannah and Jim. But thats just me, I love the dark and dreary ending because its more realistic. So, in summary, go check this out if you are looking to get a good creep fest at the cinema...the film is not 'scary' in the sense that it will give you nightmares, but its expression of the dark side of humanity should haunt you long afterwards. This film, minor flaws and all, overshadows any horror film that has been produced since the ""Blair Witch Project."" ""Zombie"" flick fans like myself will get a hee-you-juh kick out of this one. A sure-fire bet that this will make it onto several critics 'Best Of 2003' list. Leave the kiddies at home for this one!!",1056931200,,2788,4.600401606425703
1543611,5,B00005JMA8,"Probably early ""Night Of The Living Dead"" influence, ""28 Days Later"" is the slickest horror flick in years! What happens if you wake up in the hospital & no one's around, anywhere? As you venture out you realize something has gone wrong, very wrong. Take that edgy ""Blair Witch"" look - amplify to the max. Grainy with awesome shots, exquisite editing, perfect casting/acting. ""28"" is believeable, fresh, eerie, extremely involving, well written & complete. It kept me on the edge of my seat. In a packed house you could hear a pin drop. ""28"" took hold of it's audience & didn't let go.  Everyone was on board with our hero Jim...it was one hell of a ride!  See it now in theatres - buy it when the DVD is out - watch it in the dark with someone you're sure isn't 'infected'! ""28"" rocks!",1056844800,,786,4.451388888888889
1543612,5,B00005JMA8,"There is very little about this movie that can be considered ""horror"" per se.  At best, in this sense, the film is a suspense flick, with a somewhat spooky score/soundtrack (that added plenty to the tension in its atmosphere), and a great cast who portrayed the best and worst traits in human nature.
I can understand those who give the movie a bad review since they were expecting something extremely scary (that's the way in which it is being marketed) and ended up watching an intelligent, well presented study in good and evil, right vs. wrong, loyalty vs. survival, and many other concepts that one wouldn't expect from a ""horror"" flick.  This movie, in that sense, simply was not what the average goer was promised.
Now, as far as good films are concerned, this is definitely a worthy effort.  It has more depth than one could ever expect; the cinematography is done extremely well; and the acting is superb (even on the part of the nearly silent and secondary infected characters).  The symbolism is one that the average movie watcher might not get, especially if they're looking for two hours of gore or scary moments (there are very few of those, as the director clearly preferred to refrain from using extremely graphic imagery).
Indeed, what makes this film a valuable one is the social criticism and the analysis of human nature that it presents.  What is more important, survival or friendship/family?  Are the ethics of scientific research being checked to prevent the creation of harmful agents (even if not as tragic and extreme as what we see in this film)?  Is it worth fighting for one's life when hope is dim or even non-existant?  Many more questions arise and give extreme value to this film.  This is definitely an excellent example of existentialist movie making.  Whether it is a horror film or not becomes irrelevant once you observe its true meaning.
So, if you are the kind of person who enjoys trashy and bloody films like the Jason or Freddy ""epics,"" or if you cannot handle too much thinking while at the theatre, then this is not a movie for you.  If you've enjoyed ""smart"" flicks like ""Lost Highway,"" ""Frailty,"" or ""The Ring,"" then this is definitely for you.  You will feel good about seeing this one, even though it portrays so many bad and ugly things about us as ""humans.""",1056844800,269,2309,4.73067331670823
1543613,5,B00005JMA8,"Since it's release on June 27 2003, I have seen this move twice.  I was a little skeptical about the movie, seeing as how many of the more recent horror movies have really [been bad]!!  But this movie has renewed my faith,  It has a great story, great cast (my favorite "" Cillian Murphy""), and a great director.  Well let's talk a bit about the plot of the film...Anti-vivisection activists make a very bad judgment call and release an experimental monkey infected with ""rage"". 28 Days Later..., as the title has it, bicycle messenger Cillian Murphy wakes up from a post-traffic accident coma in a deserted London hospital, ventures out to find the city depopulated and the few remaining normal people doing everything to avoid the jittery, savage, zombie-like ""infecteds"" who attack on sight. Our bewildered hero has to adjust to the loss of his family and the entire world, but hooks up with several others--including a tough black woman (Naomie Harris) and a likable London cabbie (Brendan Gleeson)--on a perilous trip northwards, to seek refuge at army officer Christopher Eccleston's fortified retreat. However, even if they survive the plague, the future of humanity is still in doubt.  I don't think this movie could have been any better, it was Directed superbly, and written excellently by (Alex Garland).  I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a good horror film, that has a bit of everything in it, humor, terror, action, etc.  I am definately going to see it again, and I will be the first in line to buy it when it is finally released on DVD.",1056844800,2,1567,4.781481481481482

1543615,4,B00005JMA8,"By and large, the British seem to make more believable horror films than Americans, and this coming from an American who has studied both U.S. Films and British.  ""28 Days"" is no doubt a nail-biter.  But if you've studied horror cinema, you'll recognize many themes that have been present in past horror films.
If you're a David Cronenburg fan, you'll immediately recognize ""Rabid"".  If you're a George Romero fan, of course you're going to see ""Dawn of the Dead"".  Surprising to me, being a fan of B.B.C. television productions, the most obvious connection is to the 80s British remake of ""Day of the Triffids"", in which this movie almost completely mimics.  But is this bad?
Absolutely not.  As any fiction writer will tell, there is no new story under the sun, only new ways of telling it.  And as far as zombie films go, this movie will keep you on the edge of your seat.  There is a visceral quality to this film, which is helped along by the British connection to a long history of telling horror tales, that makes you think and wonder, while keeping you guessing.  The film is presented in a grainy, almost human-eye point-of-view that is reminiscent of flash-backs in our own life.  The whole time you are following the main characters through their tragic ordeal, you are immersed in a kind of dark, depressing focus that feels like catching a ride on the back of someone who is reliving a nightmare.
Still, for those of you who have watched endless hours of horror films, from American to Canadian to Spanish to Britsh, you cannot help but remember that this has all been done before.  There is the feeling that you've seen these themes in ""The Omega Man"", ""Night of the Living Dead"", ""Dawn of the Dead"", ""Day of the Triffids"", ""Rabid"", etc.
But, if you can put this all in the background, and you can forgive the British for borrowing from horror icons such as the ones I've mentioned, if you can settle down in your seat and close out reality, and ignore the munching of popcorn and the slurping of diet Cokes, you will find yourself wondering why it has taken so long for a horror film of this caliber to reach your local theater.  This is one hell of a ride.  And you better hold on.",1056844800,3,2197,4.5456852791878175
1543684,5,B00005JMA8,"My first horror film was a cheap rip off of a combination of mob-men infected 'The Sopranos' and Bram Stokers 'Dracula' titled 'Bloodlust', before the age of 10. Yes i was too young but to prove my point of how long I've been interested in the genre its imperative for you to know the afore mentioned. Year after year the horror genre gets worse and worse, from stupid sequels like 'I Still Know What You Did Last Summer' and just plain old redundant films like 'Wrong Turn', 'Darkeness Falls', and 'The Ring'. We've seen it all before!!!
When i saw the 6 minute preview of the film online and the trailer in theatres i was instantly captured by its original plotline and captivating effects. The film encaptures the hopes, dreams, and fears of 4 survivors 28 days after the exposure, infection, and disastruous obliteration of sanity instigated by a man made virus set loose by animal rights activists. (By the way, the church scene RULES!)
The film was shot with digital film which allows the movie to look creepy and disturbingly real. I commend Director Danny Boyle as well as the screenplay writer and the actors. All did superb parts and developed personalities for their characters as a whole. The film upholds all the realities for zombie-like films and is a masterpiece on how Boyle reaches his audience with extraordinary film-making.
Our present generation lacks emotional sympathy towards the murder of a character in a film due to the lack of sensitivity that modern day gore-filled films have, but Boyle demonstrates his talents by grasping the viewer and telling him ""HEY, this COULD be YOU, or ANYONE you love dearly"". The original musical score is exhuberantly wonderful and makes you feel just as desolate and enraged as those in the film.
A MUST see for all horror film genre lovers and a total loss for those who don't give it a chance. The boundries set for horror films have been broken and replaced by '28 days later' a contemporary masterpiece that has set new standards for horror films that are yet, and not likely to, surpass this one.",1056844800,3,2062,4.762569832402234

At least five or six plot points coincided with ""Dawn of the Dead"" especially, and Romero in my mind may want to sue for royalties. Unfortunately, as is with the case of many films, cds, etc, the younger generation will not recognize these references, and be possibly left out at discovering the genius of the likes of George Romero.

And certain things just don't add up.  (Spoilers below)
For starters, When Jim was shot at the end and their car crashed through the gate, the next shot we see is the hero characters in a cabin in the country.  How did they get there?  And when Jim wakes up in the hospital in the beginning, with the hospital in shambles and no one around, how is it that he was untouched by the infected?

The concept of a ""rage virus"" decimating the population of England and leaving only a few surviors is borderline realistic.  What makes it scary is that this world experienced something like this in the boubonic plague.  Eventhough it has been centuries and our medical advancements are great, it could still happen.
The cinematography reminded me of Jennifer 8.  The whole movie was shot with a night/dark setting and the camera lenses/digital recordings were altered to make them a touch blurry, unclear and raw.  This greatly added to the mood of the movie, much like Jennifer 8's dismal settings.  This could be a contender for an Oscar due to purposely raw filming style.
The acting was very believable, very.
The story itself was the weakest part.  The ""shock value"" was not up to par with the pre-reviews and I was not terrified like I thought I would be.  I left the theater in more of a pensive mode, but that's not all bad, is it?",1056672000,,1087,4.625
1543691,5,B00005JMA8,"28 Days Later is stylish, lonely, bloody, desperate, wet, violent, frantic, thoughtful, scary and, ultimately, hopeful.  Danny Boyle artfully directs Alex Garland's script while paying homage to movies like the Omega Man and George Romero's Dead trilogy.  As hard as it is for me to say, 28 Days is a much better film than any of the films mentioned above.
The movie focuses on the people who have not been infected with a virus that turns humans into rage filled zombies.  In fact, the zombies only make a few screen appearances, the fear factor of the movie coming mainly from the reactions of the uninfected people to their situation.  The main characters are well acted and I cared about what happened to them. Visually the movie is a masterpiece and the scenes in an empty London are incredible.
I recommend 28 Days Later to fans of the other movies mentioned above or anybody looking for a thoughtful, scary zombie film.  People looking to pull their brain out for a few hours or for non-stop gore and zombies will most likely be disappointed.",1056672000,87,1049,4.741758241758242
1543692,4,B00005JMA8,"28 DAYS LATER is one of the most unsettling post-apocalypse film of this or any other year.  Director Danny Boyle tells an end of humanity tale that pays clear homage to a wide range of similar such films like THE OMEGA MAN, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, and THE WORLD, THE FLESH, AND THE DEVIL.  Though the material has been done before, what stamps this film as noteworthy is Boyle's use of lighting and camera.  There is not a single scene that is brightly lit.  Even in those scenes that take place in the full light of day, the audience never gets a clear look at either the background shots or the actors.  And when the camera does pause long enough to show one locale or one face, that shot is blurringly made, almost as if the camera did not want to reveal too much.  Further, much of the dialogue is whispered, so I had to strain to catch the dialogue.  Normally, this low level of sound is annoying, but I had to believe that the dimness of the sound was simply an acoustic variation of a visual deconstruction of both cast and scene.  Claustrophobic shots have been done before, most notably in ALIENS 3 and BELOW, but in 28 DAYS LATER, it is this weird combination of a shutdown in both sight and sound that keeps the audience on edge.
The plot opens with a trio of animal loving activists who seek to free what they consider to be mistreated chimpanzees at the hands of soulless researchers.  Of course, when one of the scientists warns them that these simians carry a fatal virus that causes homicidal mania, you would think that these activists would say 'Whoa' and back off.  They do not and suffer predictable consequences.  The movie then shifts gears in a way that reminds you of THE DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS when Howard Keel wakes up in a deserted London hospital to find that the world has gone sightlessly mad.  Here, Cilliam Murphy is Jim, who also wakes up in a London hospital to find a very nearly deserted city.  The only inhabitants are raging zombies who seek only to bite the unconverted and a small group of humans who seek the supposed safety of a far distant army base.  Frank (Brendan Gleeson) is a bear of an Irishman who lives only to protect his teenage daughter (Megan Burns).  Naomie Harris is Selena, a lovely but lethal black woman who will kill in a heartbeat anyone who becomes infected. As they travel to seek what is probably the last effective military unit in England, movie goers with long memories will recall a similar scene in NO BLADE OF GRASS in which hapless civilians find temporary sanctuary with soldiers of crumbling discipline.
It was difficult for me to center on the morally good uninfected humans since for most of the film, their distinct personalities were deliberately obscured by low sound and dark shadows.  However, the last third reveals the paradoxical truism that both muffled sound and sight merely hinted at: the real monsters were not the howling zombies but rather the unconverted and opportunistic humans who sought to prey on their fellow kind in a way that showcases the horror of the greater damage wrought by them in comparison to the less horrible rendings of the mindless zombies.  By the time the closing credits roll, there is a slight hint that all may yet end on an optimistic note, but the combined savagery of zombie and 'normal' human lingers so strongly that the concluding note of optimism can suggest only that the gap between order and anarchy is a lot closer than we might like to think.",1056672000,5,3472,4.583198707592892
1543693,3,B00005JMA8,"From the critically acclaimed director of Trainspotting and Shallow Grave, comes a terrifying experience in which many have called a revolutionary to the horror genre.  While I do not agree with that assessment wholeheartedly, but I must admit that I had one thrilling ride sitting through 28 Days Later.  That's saying a lot, since truth be told, watching scary movies is not exactly my idea of a good time.
Set in modern day England, a group of animal rights activists breaks into a laboratory that uses chimps as test subjects.  Believing they are doing the right thing in freeing these helpless creatures, their act results in the release of a deadly virus called ""rage"" into the world.  Fastforward to four weeks after that pivotal event, a comatose patient name Jim suddenly wakes up in a deserted hospital.  Not sure of what has transpired since his accident, he roams the eeriely empty streets of London looking for any signs of life.  As daylight turns into dusk, Jim stumbles upon two individuals, Selena and Mark.  It is then he finally discovers that the whole country has been evacuated due to an outbreak of the virus.  With no outside information coming in, they have no way of knowing if the same thing is happening around the globe.
Thus begins the journey of this ragtag band of normals trying to stay alive and uninfected, but to what end?  That was one question I kept asking myself as the movie progressed, since there was no cure and for all they knew they could be the last people left with no chance of being rescued, wouldn't survival be meaningless without a goal?  Fortunately, the film does eventually address this concern in the final act, better late than never I suppose, however, the damage is already done and the pointlessness of the whole first part is only alleviated partially.
Although many are dubbing 28 Days Later as a zombie movie, but do not let that mislead you or your expectations.  Granted I am no expert on the subject, but I failed to see any similarities.  The infected people are neither mindless drones craving for human brains, nor are they the living dead.  In actuality, their purpose of existence is very simple, and that is to pass on the virus to others.  This is where one of my main concerns for 28 Days Later comes in.  I realized that ""rage"" is most likely just a means to an end, to put this group in a seemingly hopeless situation.  Yet for a movie to used a device so prominently in the telling of its story, the writer has a responsibility to explain the scenarios he introduced.  For example, why in the world would someone have the need to research a virus like this, what possible good can come out of it?  Furthermore, if the effects of the infection manifest themselves almost instantaneously with no antidote available, why would it be kept in such a low security place?  These unresolved issues do not necessarily ruin one's experience while watching the movie, but they certainly do not help to make it better to just gloss over them.
Director Boyle's choice to shoot 28 Days Later with a digital video camera is probably more of an economic decision rather than an artistic one due to the low budget.  Whether it was intentional or not, the resulting effects were quite significant.  The washed-out and grainy look of the movie contributed to an already creepy atmosphere, the sense of dread and despair was almost oppressive at times.  The beginning scenes showing an abandoned London was quite a sight to take in, even though it was kind of illogical to not encounter a single dead body when you think about it, nevertheless, the sequence was effective in drawing the audiences into the plot.  Another noteworthy aspect is the score, especially the absence of it during a few key moments, sometimes the silence is more desirable than contrived loud noises aimed at scaring the viewers.  There were a couple of cliched elements common to many horror films present as well, such as a person would enter a darkened building for no apparent reason at all.
Character developments in 28 Days Later is a mixed bag.  Cillian Murphy gave a good performance for most of the movie as Jim, but somewhere in the middle someone decided to turn him into a killing machine.  This complete one hundred eighty degrees change in his personality may be necessary to resolve the situation he found himself in, but it felt completely unconceivable when you compare it to his earlier behavior.  He was out of shape, still recovering from his injuries, and for all we knew had never taken another human life before, but now we were expected to accept that he can outsmart and outmaneuver a group of trained military soldiers.  My suspension of disbelief can only go so far.  Naomie Harris's portrayal of the strong-willed Selena was decent but forgettable, but her character also suffered from inconsistencies.  We were led to believe that she was supposed to be this tough fighter who can make all the difficult decisions without a second thought, but towards the end she was reduced to a damsel in distress needing Jim to rescue her.  It is a shame to see these personas ruined by careless writing.
Despite of all the problems I have with 28 Days Later, I still think it plays very well as a horror film on many levels, I am just a bit disappointed that it is not as polished as I hoped it would be.  Danny Boyle did an excellent job filling the audiences with angst and anticipation, the experience is so intense that you cannot let your guard down even during moments of respite, because you can never be sure if the director will have something sinister planned behind those light hearted scenes.  As I have mentioned before, I am not a big fan of scary movies, and if I managed to find something enjoyable about 28 Days Later, I can imagine you will as well.",1056499200,3,5817,4.688298918387414
1543763,4,B00005JMA8,"I watched the movie twice in two days, just so I could be fair
when I'm talking about it.

 I have seen almost every zombie/madman/epidemic film made since 1970, ranging from 'The Andromeda Strain' to 'Zombie'. Does that make me some sort of expert? No. It means I like this genre. Take my review in that spirit.
 '28 Days Later' quickly jumps into its main storyline; the survival of Jim, a twenty-something bike messenger who had been in a coma since immediately before the outbreak (caused by animal activists who simply wouldn't listen to reason I'm afraid).
 He manages, after a pretty hairy escape from a church, to hook up with two other survivors: Serena and the character I like to call ""he who dies to drive the seriousness of the situation home"". Later, they hook up with a father and daughter holding up in an apartment building which they have to abandon due to the plumbing giving out.
 Following a radio recording promising salvation, they head for an army barricade hoping for protection.
 Up to now, I haven't said anything about the movie that hasn't been in previews or magazine articles. To finish my review, I might have to use some spoilers:
 Danny Boyle is still growing as a filmmaker, but at least it's in the right direction. Jim has very little time to adjust to his new reality, and his reluctance is palpable. He sees what simply surviving has done to the others. He also learns from an unexpected source an astonishing bit of information that turns the despair you feel slightly around. Jim finally does embrace the 'kill or be killed' mentality, but not in the way you expect or against the obvious enemy.
 Now a lot of folks have commented on the ending not being so good, but I have to wonder: were they disappointed that it wasn't action-packed, or were they disappointed that it held out more hope than any Romero film ever did (or Luchi or Cronenberg or Craven for that matter)?

 I personally enjoyed the ending, which shows things aren't always going to go to Hell forever.
 Having seen 'Trainspotting' I'm surprised Boyle was capable of, what in his eyes, was a happy ending. Maybe not for his country, but for humanity. And maybe that was his point. Humanity goes on, just not certain peoples way of life.
 I'm watching it again this weekend.",1056067200,18,2282,4.6633416458852865

This is a must see for anyone who is sick of the usual sappy Hollywood blockbuster films--it is a quality picture that will stimulate your mind and invoke interesting dialogue and thought.",1055808000,8,533,4.610526315789474

This film is brilliant on two levels.  First, it's a zombie movie par excellence--very scary, very creepy--with a bit of the wonderful flavor of '60s British horror films (and a bit of ""The Omega Man"" for good measure).
Second, it's about what happens to people in terrible situations, about the loss of innocence, about cynicism and ultimately about the persistence of love.
It will delight/scare horror movie fans, but its appeal, I believe, will be much wider than that.

I was not expecting much from this movie, and went in thinking it would be stupid, but boy was I wrong. The movie is a horror movie that in death scenes it makes you feel sad, as if it were real. The score is marvelous, easily one that should win or atleast be nominated for an Oscar. Director Danny Boyle does a superb job of direction, and is so far the best direction I have seen in any film this year, it is a Oscar winning direction . The cinematography is in one word: WOW! Oscar deserving. The Whole cast does an amazing job and the woman and girl deserve Oscars for their performances.

1543770,3,B00005JMA8,"As a long time horror fan, I waited this film with great expectation and enthusiasm. The good things are these: The overall concept and premisse are great. A guy wakes up in hospital just to discover he is the only one left on Earth. The rest of the people is dead or (better!) transformed into zombies due to a deadly virus. Well, from this point of view, Danny Boyle strikes gold. Not only this film is triumph of production (with London's empty streets and some great storytelling moments - as the main character unfolds the traces of chaos and violence that spread while he was sleeping). The film keeps going beautifully as the character finds other survivors along with terrifying zombies (the church scene is great). Their journey through the city is great (it updates most of the scenario created by George A. Romero in his legendary DAWN OF THE DEAD - still unsurpassed!) and all the elements are wisely chosen. All characters are interesting and everything is terrifyingly believable. In all, the good thing about this film is that it promisses a great story and it delivers so. The music is one of the best I have seen in years. The image (shot on digital video - no less) is bold and should be studied with attention.
The bad thing (when the movie starts to sink) is when the story starts to shift towards another story (not part of the original premisse) and usually this is when you begin to realize that the screenwriter did not know how to end the story. The main characters get to the military camp and the story (about loneliness, zombies and survival) shifts to something else (so much it actually distracts you from what the film was really about). The ending is (as one might figure) unbelievable and disappointing as it uses the ""weeks later""-like jump to conclusion - not to mention a contrived happy ending (how can it be possible??).
In all, I think this is a terryfic film experience with lots of great moments, interesting characters but with a stupid ""last 30 minutes"". It could have been a landmark film in contemporary horror. I hope someone learned the lesson.
