8204503,5,B000S6LS7A,I like the Military Channels concise videos- it keeps them from getting to boring. At the same time it lacks in some information about different subjects. But it also sheds light on information that is slightly different than what you might normally hear about.. all and all this video won`t put you to sleep!!,1257897600,8,310,4.7592592592592595
8204504,5,B000S6LS7A,"If you like military history and technology, this is a very interesting set of countdowns that shows the most significant events in weapons development over the last century. What I like is that the countdowns is that they factor in the historical significance of the weapon as part of the criteria. So they do not simply rank the lastest weapons as the best, but rank it according to its impact on history.",1202428800,15,407,4.666666666666667
