8566850,5,B00BDZV7BC,Really love this show. It's pretty good but its kind of a guilty pleasure of mine. All the same though its worth checking out.,1435190400,,126,4.291666666666667
8566851,5,B00BDZV7BC,"So, on the packaging, it claims to be the complete third season, but it lacks the series/season 3 finale, An All Dogs Christmas Carol, unlike the complete series set. I think it's still well worth it though as it is a great show. And if you are to save money, seasons 1-3 and An All Dogs Christmas Carol may be your best bet.",1393372800,,325,4.174603174603175
