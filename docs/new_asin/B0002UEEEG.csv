8031962,5,B0002UEEEG,"The ""Perry Mason"" novels were a form of mystery stories where the detective is a lawyer and the solution occurs in a courtroom. A real life court trial is not this dramatic. Erle Stanley Gardner often educated his readers with new technology or medical-legal facts, and warned of swindles. The TV shows are simplified and changed versions from the originals, or were new stories. Some may criticize the tactics of Perry Mason but they represent life before the modern legal rules of the 1960s. The prices, automobiles, and monetary figures date these stories. Note the familiarity with firearms. They record the styles and culture of the 1950s. The many character actors enriches these stories, their emotions are often portrayed by their facial expressions.

In Mexico Paul Drake finds the missing man for a shocking surprise ending! The last scene ties up the loose ends. No mention about what is next.
This story tells something about the life-styles of the rich. It seems to echo Dashiell Hammett's short story called ""The Golden Horseshoe"".

""The Case of the Nine Dolls"" begins in Perry Mason's office where he talks about a fshing trip. A young lady wants to see Perry. Peggy Smith wants help to find out her true identity!

Mr. Tobler tells Perry about the source of the funds. Larry Osborn tells the hidden facts. Then a witness testifies to the truth during Perry's cross-examination. This will free Linda Osborn.

This is an unusually sentimental story. Note how the ""Jeffers"" name is mispronounced by some of the actors.",1260489600,,3133,4.821561338289963
