4830000,3,B005LS4MQY,"This review is for the standard DVD version of Def-Con 4/Hell Comes to Frogtown release by Image Entertaiment.

These movies are both dystopian future movies. 'Def-Con 4' takes place in the near future during and right after a nuclear holocaust. 'Hell comes to Frogtown' staring 'Rowdy' Roddy Piper, is a post-apocalyptic story that takes place at an uncertain time (at least to me!) in the future after a nuclear holocaust.

There is nudity in 'Hell Comes to Frogtown' but not 'Def-Con 4.'

Both of these movies are on 1 disc and the picture quality is good.

The First Movie, 'Def-Con 4' has many problems, not the least of which is it's title. For those who don't know, Def-Con 4 is not the condition in which a nuclear war takes place. We need to get to Def-Con 1 for that so I'm not sure if their is a good reason for Def-Con 4 or it was just a dumb mistake. 3 astronauts are out in space manning a nuclear warhead station. They have been there for many month's and they are beginning to show signs of severe stress (don't they ever do psychological profiles for astronauts in sci-fi movies they way they do in real life?). One day they receive a 'launch' message that gets interrupted. This creates some real drama. They have to decide to launch or not. Suddently their ship is being pulled back to earth without their consent. They attempt to send away all the nuclear missiles and give them 60 hours before detonation but one of them remains 'stuck' to the ship. They land and it's all downhill from here. Jordan is knocked unconscious upon landing. The other two hear knocking on the side of the ship. Thinking they are saved, they attempt to leave. Walker leaves first and is immediately eaten by cannibals. Howe waits awhile and decides to leave the ship only to be captured by a survivalist, Vinny. Vinny is living with J.J., who is the ex-girlfriend of Gideon. Gideon is the sadistic leader of the remaining survivors in the area of which they landed. We find out it was Gideon who had the capsule brought to earth. Eventually all 3 are captured by Gideon and when they get to prison, they find that Jordan, who remained in the space ship has been captured also. Only Howe and Jordan are aware of the imminent danger of the nuclear warhead detonating. They must find a way to escape before all is lost.
Of course none of this makes any real sense. How could earth have devolved into this mess so quickly after nuclear war. There is bound to be plenty of places not hit by bombs and it's doubtful that people would have turned into cannibalistic maniacs in such a short time. J.J. is basically living in a hole in Vinny's basement like a prisoner, yet she is free to come and go as she pleases. The plot is a mess. Vinny has a tank like vehicle. I'm not sure where he is getting his fuel for this vehicle. There seems to be very little reason for Gideon taking people prisoner and brutally supressing them. Why not just let them go and not be bothered? There don't seem to be any other factions for them to join. Hey, it's just a movie and it does have pretty good poster art.

'Hell Comes to Frogtown' is the second of the movies. This movie is much more entertaining. As the movie opens we see a seen in which a 'frog person' who's face is wrapped kills somebody outside and he makes a comment about how they shouldn't have guns. Sam Hell (Roddy Piper) is being interrogated by Captain Devling (veteran actor William Smith). Devling is a corrupt head of security who is selling guns to the frog people. Sam is a criminal but is saved from more abuse at the hands of Captain Devling by a group of nurses. You see, Sam, is one of the few men on earth that have a high sperm count. They need Sam to impregnate a group of fertile women in order to keep the human race going. Whatever nuclear holocaust occured has made most people unable to procreate. A group of women who can still produce babies has been captured by the frog people. These 'Medtech' nurses also carry guns and can fight. Medtech attaches a 'chastity belt' to Sam. But not really. It does have a flap that opens. The purpose of the belt is to keep Sam from running away. If Sam leaves the area in which Spangle (Sandahl Bergman) is in his genitals will be electrocuted. If Sam doesn't cooperate, they can choose to send a shock to his 'package.' Along with Centinella, a very hot gunner, they take off into the wastelands heading for Frog Town. Once there, it's up to Sam and company to free the fertile women and for Sam to do what he must for the human race. This may even include doing it with a Frog Woman who's help is needed. Even his captors seem to want a go at Sam. Can Sam save the day? You'll just have to watch. Know this however, there are two sequels, Return to Frogtown and Max Hell, Frog Warrior, neither of which star Roddy Piper.

The budgets for each of these movies is low, particularly Def-Con 4. 'Hell Comes to Frogtown' at least has some recognizable names even if they are for 'b' movie actors/actresses.

'Hell Comes to Frogtown' is definitely the better of the two. There are some decent sets and the 'frog people' look pretty good. The acting is at best average and the movie comes across as being quite 'campy' at times. There is quite a bit of comedy in 'Frogtown' and it definitely made me laugh several times.

'Def-Con 4' tries to be serious but fails. The acting, especially the main star, Tim Choate as 'Howe' is well below average. The one decent acting performance is by Maury Chakin as 'Vinny,' a veteran character actor. The movie starts off well enough and is at first intriguing. Once the space ship lands, things quickly go down hill starting with the killing of one of the astronauts. The 'cannibal' subplot goes nowhere and is almost immediately dropped. The movie ends with story resolved but leaves you with the filling that it isn't.

I would give 'Def-Con 4' a 2.5/10 and 'Hell Comes to Frogtown' a 4.5/10 or for Amazon purposes, 2 stars(Hell) added to .5 stars(Def-Con) for a total of 2 1/2 stars. We'll throw in another 1/2 star for the unique plot (How many movies do we see where a former wrestler's sperm saves the world?) to make it 3.

Recommended for 'dystopian future' diehards.",1462492800,3,6212,4.474845542806708

4830014,4,B005LS4MQY,"I recommend this double feature solely for Hell Comes to Frogtown which stars wrestling legend Roddy Piper and the amazing price. The picture quality on this release is wonderful, especially if you have a blu-ray player that does the upscaling. Even if not, the DVD picture and sound is still great.  The movie Def-Con 4 is not my cup of tea. I did not watch it. I put it on for a few minutes and it was horrible, in my opinion, but I did not buy it for that movie. There is also a theatrical trailer for each movie included but no other extras.  I like this movie even better than They Live which is probably Piper's most notable starring role.  I definitely recommend Frogtown if you are a ""Hotrod"" fan or a horror/sci-fi fan in general.  Classic B-movie!",1439683200,,757,4.424460431654676

4830016,4,B005LS4MQY,"I'm trying to be fair on my score here.  Fair because I love the old 70-80's style after the war style films and I'd simply give this a 5-star score for that.  If you keep in mind WHEN these films were made and whole road-warrior class of films being made at the same time, then you''d likely score it 5 starts too.

Without giving away the stories (which you may already know of if you are reading this in any case) here are some reasons to buy and watch these two films.

Roddy Piper.  This isn't his best movie, but he mostly leaves his wrestling moves behind and just plays / pushes the camp style to the max.  He makes the film the perfect blend of fun and silliness that make this a cult style classic.

Movies without a budget.  Okay, there had to be some kind of budget, but not by much.  Entire movies made without spending on sets, special effects or lots of retakes.  They just got out there and made a movie for just the love of doing it.

Seeing what other folks thought the world might look like after World War 3 that didn't focus only on Mel Gibson and cars racing around. Both movies are that very topic, though in the case of Hell comes to Frogtown, well things could be worse.  While both have the basic core background and subject mater, they couldn't be more different.  From one being dark and the other being outright funny, to one trying to paint an almost moralistic commentary to the other perhaps setting up a TV series, there is a lot to enjoy.

So look, if you know what a B movie is and have ever enjoyed one, then you can almost bet your bottom dollar that you'll enjoy one or both of these movies.  What more can I say?",1439251200,3,1651,4.2300319488817895
4830017,5,B005LS4MQY,"I still haven't watched Def Con 4, since I only bought this for Hell Comes to Frogtown.  I hadn't seen this movie since I was a kid, so it was nostalgic.  VERY corny, but in a funny way.  If you're looking for a pure sci-fi experience, it's probably not for you.  If you look at it from a comedy perspective, it's great -- especially for the age.

Roddy Piper's character is great.  Supposedly, one of the last fertile men after a nuclear war, his reproductive parts are considered property of the new government and his job is to help re-populate the world by performing ""in the field"" with any fertile women his team can capture and impregnate.  The brief topless scene is reason enough to watch it!",1437868800,,701,4.47244094488189

It is a very entertaining B movie featuring scantily clad girls, a loopy plot and the macho heroics of ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper. What's not to love? If you are the sort of person who finds a title like ""Hell Comes To Frogtown"" innately appealing you will LOVE this movie.

  ""Def Con4"" is a late in the cycle Canadian nuclear holocaust film. It has an interesting premise but fails to deliver on execution. Radioactive mutants? Introduced and dispensed with in a matter of minuets. Things like that occur all the time in this movie. The really interesting stuff gets little air time while we get an abusive  teenage love story as the center of the film!
