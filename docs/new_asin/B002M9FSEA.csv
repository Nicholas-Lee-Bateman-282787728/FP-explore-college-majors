8373606,5,B002M9FSEA,"Looking for something inexpensive and full of ninja? Look no further. 4 films, one set, all action!

Ninja in the dragons den is the far superior film in this set. Awesome cast, great story and possibly the wackiest theme song ever.

Ninjas and dragons is the least favorable in the collection but it's not with out its charm.

Ninja:the final duel is a spectacular film by Robert Tai. It has the best nude female martial arts scene ever put down on celluloid. Even better than the nude fight scene in Shaolin Dolemite. If you like this film I suggest getting Shaolin Dolemite and the Black Soul Dynamite collection. It also has another Robert Tai film with most of the same cast.

To Catch a Ninja is possibly the craziest ninja film I've ever seen. It's rather lackluster through the first 50 minutes but the last 40 are insane! It involves a robbery, an insurance adjuster, a cop and ninjas. What really sets this film apart from the rest, these ninjas are on rollerskates! Possibly the only film with ninjas on rollerskates. At the end of the roller ninja chase scene, watch for the 2 ninjas skating on the spot!

Hope this helps. I found my copy at best buy for $7. Might be easier on the wallet.",1335139200,,1201,4.516129032258065
8373607,5,B002M9FSEA,"Bought this package because it included ""Ninja in the Dragons Den"", been looking for this one for a while. The other movies are typical Ninja/Kung-Fu martial arts B (or C) movies...but will pass time on a slow evening :) When playing on the computer twas a little motion-blurry whenever the camera was panning, might be because of VLC (software used to watch movie) or DVD-player in PC. Will probably check it in an ordinary DVD-player some day, but no biggie. The movie was as good as I remembered it - and like I said before - the others will pass time on a slow day. Worth the price !",1312416000,,587,4.394495412844036
8373608,3,B002M9FSEA,"Hey, who doesn't like Ninja movies?  Four Ninja movies, can't be beat!!

There are four ninja movies in this very cheap (and cheaply produced) 'box set' consisting of a doublesided dvd (two films on each side.)  You can pick this up for 6.99 at Best Buy (even tho the Amazon 'add'  says it's not yet released.)  Two titles are full screen and two are WS transfers, and they are mostly watchable VHS transfers.  The 'find' in this set is ""Ninja in the Dragon's Den"" which stars Henry Sanada and Conan Lee.  While this is decidedly NOT the new remastered transfer, it's very watchable and possesses good Corey Yuen choreography. (The tone in the movie shifts a lot, but so what.)

""Ninja, the Final Duel"" is the film which Rudy Ray Moore adapted, I think, for his Dolomite kung-fu movie.  It has some gratuitous nudity (FS, the print is not good.) It's entertaining, if you toss down a couple pops and settle in.  ""Ninja and Dragon"" has lots of jumping around (and WS print - I'm waiting to watch it on a dull Saturday afternoon, but I scanned thru it and it looks very 'very entertaining'.)  ""To Catch a Ninja"" is pretty unwatchable and possessing such a bad print I did not give it a fair shake.  (Whew, it will take a very very dull day that prompts me to finish watching this one, I thought.)

Apparently ""To Catch a Ninja"" is also called 'Ninja Thunderbolt"" and it stars Richard Harrison and has more gratuitous nudity.  I roamed the net looking for a review to see if would entice me to someday watch it and came across these interesting comments:

""I have to say that this movie contains the best chase scene ever to be filmed in the history of mankind! When the main character, Mr. Harry Wong (no joke) gets into his tiny little car and is chased by ninjas wearing white rollerskates with big pink wheels.  If you manage to find this one, rent it! Just beware of the 2 absolutely random and gratuities sex scenes. They kinda pop outta nowhere.
All in all, it's your typical Kung Fu type movie out of Hong Kong, but with a bizarre and puzzling twist at the end.""
These comments were made by a man named ""Rockweezer 84"" (from Detroit) on IMBD.  Good comments.  Very good comments.  Made me rethink my position on the film, bad print notwithstanding.  I'll file away a notion to watch it someday.

In sum:  At 10.00 bucks, not a good deal......buy a good copy of ""Ninja in the Dragon's Den.""  At 7.00, at Best Buy it's probably an ok deal for the four-pak.",1263686400,10,2459,4.4641255605381165
