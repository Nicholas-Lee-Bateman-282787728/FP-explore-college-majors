2324032,5,B0009VCS6O,"OK, there is a twisted, retro, Martha Stewart quality to Brini. But in a good way! Seriously. Brini is the perfect hostess, chef, redecorator, and gal about town.  As campy as the show is, she actually does give sound advice on such things as collecting (I loved her vintage beauty products), organizing, finding those hard to find items (she had a field trip to the recycling plant where she found some unique vintage pieces), and planning a bridal shower (just a few examples).  I even learned what a ""pullman loaf"" is (a loaf of bread baked in a certain shape that you can slice into layers and ""frost"" with sandwich spreads and cream cheese frosting (popular in the 1950's apparently).  She spills, flubs, gives advice and encourages the weary to carry on - the Brini way!

If for no other reason, everyone should see the show just for Brini's wardrobe. Her clothes are, well, retro-licious!  Every ensemble is stylish beyond words including the coordinating jewelry.  I'm guessing the clothing is made especially for Brini (if Brini doesn't make them herself) out of vintage fabrics.  Brini, if you see this review, please tell me where you get the fabric!  I'm a retro gal myself!

To end, I'm really happy that this show is on the air because it's one of those feel good shows that make you smile and reminds you of your mother's glamorous 1960s style - when all the moms worked hard taking care of their homes and families and always looked beautiful and accessorized doing it.  Brini is the ultimate retro goddess!",1138060800,23,1523,4.734848484848484
2324033,1,B0009VCS6O,"The premise of this show holds great potential: a drag queen hosting a Martha Stewart-style show. However, Brini Maxwell is the ""unfunniest"" drag queen that I've ever seen and she walks and talks like she's popped a few downers.",1126483200,,228,4.871794871794871
2324034,5,B0009VCS6O,"Brini Maxwell, that cross between Martha Stewart, 'Tippi' Hedren and an ideal 50's-60's wife/mom, delights and entertains in this wonderful series.  Yes, of course she's really a man (the clever Ben Sander), but that doesn't stop her from charming all sorts of folks all over the Big Apple, including, at one point, a cadre of macho firefighters.  Even if you find a few of her ideas for decorating or entertaining a bit, well, too-too, her can-do attitude and her admirable sang-froid - or is it a martini-induced stupor? - will have you savoring every moment in her presence.  Plus, she's got a retro wardrobe that'll either have you chortling out loud, or drooling in envy (and you know who you are)!",1126137600,37,703,4.793388429752066

8067348,5,B0009VCS6O,LOVE! LOVE!!!  LOVE!!!  The Martha Stewart of the 50-60's!!  Brini always makes me smile!!  So campy!!!,1407801600,2,103,5.25
8067349,5,B0009VCS6O,"Lived thru the 50's and 60's, and I'm here to tell you that Brini's wardrobe on the show is perfect, just as we wished to look (but sob didn't).  Whether it is really vintage or Ben's retro designs, her palette, makeup, and clothes are accurate and very good looking too.  I would watch just to see what she was wearing, but the shows are fun too.  The set, which is Ben's home I believe, is also wonderfully accurate.  There is so much retro stuff for sale that is slightly off and annoying; but not on the Brini Maxwell Show.  And she looks much more feminine than many a real lady!  I have to recommend this for the accuracy of the style.",1398124800,,641,4.256198347107438
8067350,4,B0009VCS6O,She is an original. Saw her show years ago on a cable channel and make myself terrible VHS copies of the episodes but still watched them. Glad to have these at last.,1390780800,2,165,4.1875
8067351,5,B0009VCS6O,"when this was first on TV, my wife and I would argue up and down as to whether the main character was in drag.  (he is!)  This is a hysterical sendup of Martha Stewart and the like.  Especially funny when you're already in a slap-happy mood!",1388534400,2,241,4.195652173913044
8067352,5,B0009VCS6O,This was a gift purchase from a friends wish list. The item came as described and the price was great!,1384732800,3,102,4.15
8067353,5,B0009VCS6O,"The classiest and most polished of drag queen illusionists, Brini Maxwell is a true treat to watch!  But don't let that prim and proper exterior fool you, Brini definitely also has a very funny and saucy side that subtly shines through.  This DVD was a joy to watch, as well as to be reminded about Brini's very REAL household tips to which she often replies, ""Now why didn't you think of that?""  And my question to put out there to anyone reading this review, is why didn't you think of buying this very entertaining DVD of the best of Brini's Style Network show sooner?!",1363392000,3,572,4.480769230769231
8067354,5,B0009VCS6O,"Brini, Brightens even the dullest mind! Much better then Martha Stewart!
Love her Style, the camp, her smart attitude and her smarter clothes. Can't say enough about the cheese (recipes) I want to be Brini in my next life! Watch her DVDs and buy her book. A shout out to the Brilliancy THAT IS Ben
Sander! Brini we love you! Style Network bring her back!",1218585600,4,354,4.461538461538462
8067355,5,B0009VCS6O,A fine gift for an M. Stewart devote'. Fn'tastic. Brini makes recalling that time more bearable.,1209254400,3,96,5.0625
8067356,4,B0009VCS6O,"Add one part Martha Stewart, a dash of Julia Child, the moxy of Mary Tyler Moore, the soothing nature of Mr. Rogers and mix generously in a gender blender and you get the wit, wisdom and just a touch of subversive humor from the fabulous Brini Maxwell!  As much great fun as this DVD is if your a fan of the domestic goddess that is Brini, I was disappointed that the Season One DVD only in actuality had the first half of the season and not the full season in it's entirety.

I also unfortunetly found out that the Style Network is not renewing Brini's contract for a second season, so for fans of this fabulous domestic diva I really hope that the Style Network will release the rest of 'her' season onto DVD.

I can't recommend this DVD enough, it's great fun!",1142467200,13,763,4.321678321678322
