5341341,5,B009JA2ZT6,This series tells of a 30 year love that exists through time. It tells of a new young love that begins totally unexpectedly. The love continues between parents and children. The music is sweet and wonderful as is the story. It has great pain and decision making and sacrifice. This marriage and sibling aspect is not known in American society. I truly was kept watching to see which way the plot would go next.,1352937600,12,410,4.554054054054054

5341345,5,B009JA2ZT6,"This is an extraordinarily beautiful film. The sights are spectacular, and the music is beautiful throughout.  The ending is happy and cute, actually.  The most impressive of all is the acting.  It is in a word--flawless!  Jang Geun Seok demonstrates his incredible versatility again, as he plays two distinctly different characters, and I do mean flawlessly. Joon Ah is also great In the roles she plays.  All of the acting of every actor was so well done.  There are no disappointments in this movie.  A well told love story with things you can learn from and take away from to better your own life.  I only love happy endings, and I wasn't disappointed as it all came together and had me smiling to the end.  I guess I can't say enough, but it is now my new favorite movie which I will be watching again and again.",1444348800,,817,4.503401360544218

5341348,5,B009JA2ZT6,"Very good story. A lot of drama but enchanting. Loved this one, even though I do not consider this the best K-Drama I have ever seen. It goes into the favorite ones in my K-Drama collection.",1437868800,,190,4.305555555555555
5341349,5,B009JA2ZT6,"Good subtitles. The only thing we noticed when watching was that the episodes play continuously one right after the other...so the intro to each episode doesn't play as each one starts, which is fine...just may not know where an episode begins or ends.",1434844800,,252,4.883720930232558
5341350,5,B009JA2ZT6,"Love Rain is my favorite Kdrama.  I watched this so many times and still I will not get tired of watching this again.  JGS and Yoona had a good chemistry, it's so good that you hope that they make another TV drama together.  My favorite episode was #5, when the young couple met.  Although the first 4 episodes are corny and boring, these episodes give the viewers a comparison of what was like in the 70s and now.  I loved how the movie transitioned to modern day in episode 5, and how it transitioned from funny episodes to heart wrenching episodes then to a heartwarming final episode.  Again, Jang Geun Suk did a superb job in this tv drama!!!  I am now officially, a JGS fan after watching this.  I wish they show this in Netflix.",1433116800,,735,4.352941176470588
5341351,5,B009JA2ZT6,"I enjoyed this movie, love the actors...  I never found it to be slow, always kept me wanting to see it.  I work, so when I get home, I open my laptop and can not wait to continue my Love Story..",1432598400,,195,3.731707317073171
5341352,1,B009JA2ZT6,"This story may be one of the best drama ever made, but you wouldn't be able to tell since the subtitles are horrible!!  I love Jang Geun-seok and I really wanted to watch this but I can't get pass the broken and illegible English subtitles.  Plus the drama only came with three disc not five like the description stated.  Can anyone tell me which version I can buy that has a better English subtitles?  I like to think that I can understand Korean as many dramas I've seen but I can only pick up a word here or there.",1427846400,,517,4.191919191919192
5341353,5,B009JA2ZT6,"This is one of my favorite k-dramas so I'm glad to add this boxset to my collection. The quality of the set is done quite nicely. Better than I expected as this was my first time buying somewhere other than YesAsia. The subtitles are well-written as far as spelling and grammar go and from what I can tell from watching this online before, seem to be spot on. My dvd player also automatically selected the Korean audio with the English subtitles on which was a plus. My individual dvds were in great condition (not a single scratch!). The audio does cut out but only a couple of times the entire run of the drama and particular scenes have different background music/OST music than when I first watched it, but it seems to definitely be worth the buy for any 'SarangBi' fan~",1415232000,,774,4.49645390070922

5341355,5,B009JA2ZT6,This is such a sweet drama. Everything actually works out for the characters. At some parts the sound cuts off but other than that it plays perfectly and arrived on time and in great condition.,1381968000,,193,4.542857142857143

5341357,5,B009JA2ZT6,"Excellent continuity in screenplay. The storyline cohesive with characters in the perfect part. The soundtrack and set direction spot on, made me wanting to revisit South Korea just to retrace the emotions expressed by the actors. Jang Geun Seok as well as the other actors portrayed their individual parts seamlessly. I vote for Oscar Gold for this ensemble casts along with script and set direction.  KUDOS!!!!",1370822400,4,412,5.242424242424242

5341360,5,B009JA2ZT6,Love Rain is in my top five K-dramas (I have only watched 32 so far).  The  story is delightful and I appreciate the mature love story as I am 53 myself.  The story has a lot of depth since we get to watch them age - great leads - beautiful music (as usual).  Watch this one for sure!,1364083200,,284,3.8448275862068964
5341361,5,B009JA2ZT6,"If you like Korean dramas, Yoona or Jang Geum Suk, you'll love this show.  The first 3.5 episodes were a little slowly paced, but they're well worth it once you get to episode four.  It really picks up the pace and the lead characters play off each other really well.",1362960000,,267,4.32

8542180,5,B009JA2ZT6,I love the entire series. The actors give the impression of reality not acting. The story line keeps your attention. I have watched this several times and my enjoyment of it stays the same. Thank you!,1514678400,,200,4.583333333333333
8542181,5,B009JA2ZT6,"I'm a fan of Jang Geun Suk, and there are very few tv shows or films with this actor that I don't like... so I can't be partial. I will say that it is a lovely romantic series and that I enjoyed it despite the fact that I am not a romantic person at all.",1507161600,,254,3.6363636363636362
