2661465,5,B000ION27G,When a movie touches my heart - the way this one did - I watch it over and over and over again...  Recommend this highly...,1167264000,9,123,3.92
2661466,4,B000ION27G,"This moving incorperates all the elements of a magical, beautiful Christmas!  Tracey Neeham (Sarah) is a terrific actress and her character is someone I would like as a friend.  At first I thought that Natasha Gregson Wagner was not a very good actress because she was so ""dead pan.""  Then I realized that her character, Beth, is a self-centered, pasionless, joyless person until the ""magic"" begins.  Ronny Cox, Buddy, is one of the best character actors of our time and, of course, Meredith Baxter never disappoints.  An enjoyable, heartwarming movie for Christmas or anytime!",1165881600,30,577,5.095744680851064

2661521,5,B000ION27G,"If I had seen this movie before this Christmas, I did not remember it.  It is a really good movie for Christmas or anytime.  It brings a sense of what so many families go through (discounting the angel's coming back) because we are all flawed in our own way.

2661544,5,B000ION27G,Meredith Baxter does her usual fine performance in this movie.  How great is a story when one spirit can come in at just the right time and help to heal a family's broken heart(s)?

2661549,5,B000ION27G,"Who has not wished for just one more day with a loved one who has passed on? One more opportunity to say I love you and to feel the warmth of their hug? One last chance to right a wrong? What if you prayed for that one more day and God answered your prayer? Would it, could it, possibly change your life?

A grieving father and husband wants that one more day with his deceased wife. His two daughters, living miles apart and estranged for years, reunite due to his having a stroke just before Christmas. He convinces them to spend the holiday at a small cottage on a lake, where they used to live as a family, surrounded by the beauty of mountains and a snowy landscape. After the settle in, the father finds his wish is granted and their lives are changed forever.

On Christmas morning, their mother appears on the scene - shocking them all. (Yes, she is the angel.) Once they realize she is only to be with them for one day, they treasure every moment as their mother creates a Christmas they will never forget. The father is renewed, pulled from his grief at last. The daughters are reconciled, making life-changing decisions due to a whole new perspective given them by the gift of those brief few hours with their mother. As hearts are healed, they open to let in light and love.

The message is that life goes on and those we love are always with us, living in our hearts as we remember all the little things that made our lives with them wonderful.",1410912000,,1457,4.369003690036901

2661553,5,B000ION27G,"A wonderful movie to watch anytime, but really good for a Christmas movie.  If you like good Christmas movies and you have watched the 'old' great children movies, this one is one that you should pop some corn, and turn out the lights and sit back and enjoy it.

2661577,5,B000ION27G,"Definately a contemporary classic. I always enjoyed this movie every year when it was shown on Lifetime. It disappeared from the dial and was so pleased to find it on Amazon. It is one of my Christmas traditions. What a terrific heart warming story so appropriate for the holidays. Hard to find such meaningful holiday movies. A refreshing departure from all of those ""Santa claus"" movies that are appearing lately on LIfetime and Hallmark.
I highly recommend this one.",1357862400,,469,4.949367088607595

Don't forget your family, what you have learned, and if it wasn't that great, there is a time for forgiveness and understanding, and things that you need to remember not to repeat in your life.",1325030400,,306,4.350877192982456

2661591,2,B000ION27G,"I was hoping for a tear jerker, something that would move me but alas it didn't really have that ingredient. It tried and hoped you would be moved, but it was very shallow imho. The Blu ray is nothing exceptional, I think it would be identical to the DVD. If you want to get this get the double feature for the same price even if not blu ray. Absolutely no extras in fact no menu to go to. As I said nothing special. 2 stars for effort.",1293148800,,436,4.022988505747127
2661592,3,B000ION27G,"I picked this up because I had seen Meredith Baxter's other movie, A Christmas Visitor and loved it. I was also a fan of her show, Family Ties. I didn't expect much, and was pleasantly surprised. It's a great story. Sure, it's got the feel of a low budget ""movie of the week"" kind of thing, but it was a lot of fun. I think that it will become a Christmas classic for me to watch every year !",1279411200,7,392,3.9746835443037973
2661593,5,B000ION27G,Great story for someone who has lost someone. It shows faith that we can still come back to help our loved ones.,1264291200,2,112,4.136363636363637
2661594,1,B000ION27G,"I started watching this movie when I was feeling a bit sick thinking that it would make me feel better. It started off interesting and had promise until the long-dead mother started baking pies and making hot chocolate, and then actually appearing. Anyone who has lost a beloved parent (or sibling, child, friend, etc.) always wishes for them to come back, but that never happens.  I started feeling uncomfortable when the beds were suddenly made and the house was somehow completely decorated, but I turned the movie off when the dead mother appeared.

The movie did not feel hopeful; it felt hurtful. I'm not against movies about angels helping families. I actually like that type of movie, but this one just felt wrong. There are so many other good holiday movies; I suggest skipping this one.",1260144000,10,796,4.845588235294118
2661595,5,B000ION27G,"I'm adding this movie to my list of yearly Christmas movies to watch! It lets the viewer know that our loved ones, that have passed, still watch over us, especially at Christmastime. A sweet decent movie the whole family can enjoy!!",1253318400,3,232,4.682926829268292
2661596,5,B000ION27G,"My husband and I enjoyed the movie.  It is one we will watch again.  It was a very touching movie and one that had some good messages in it.  It is a nice family movie, safe for the whole family to watch.",1249171200,,204,3.8095238095238093
2661597,5,B000ION27G,"A nice movie that shows love conquers all!
Truly inspiring and worth watching. I wish that stories such as this come to life!",1241136000,,125,4.478260869565218
2661598,5,B000ION27G,"A heart warming movie that will bring tears to your eyes. It's a story that shows what true and everlasting love is all about. It also shows how we sometimes lose what our real priorities should be....family. So often we all get lost in the real world of stature, prestige, money and materialistic things, we forget what real love and companionship and family are all about. This movie even identifies sibling rivalries and the different paths people take to solve their problems to their own satisfaction, sometimes blaming the family for those same problems. Until you take responsibility for your own problems and life, you will never come to grips with what real love and family is all about. This is not a movie for those action/adventure types. This is truly a love story that covers the family situations. Enjoy, this is a movie you will come back too many times over.",1240358400,,875,4.7631578947368425

2661639,2,B000ION27G,"The idea of reconciliation and completing loose ends is good but many don't have a second chance after they die!

a soso movie with a peaceful feel except when the psychological monster fights with her sister.",1199145600,2,209,4.805555555555555
2661640,3,B000ION27G,"The idea of this film is false, and not remotely realistic, which no other reviewers seem to mention!  Meridith is great as always, and the characters, apart from the father, are realistic enough, but hardly superb.  There are a lot of missing elements in the plot lines.  Both girls hate each other and feel their lives are harder than anyone elses, which in some ways is realistic, other ways, pathetic.  The dad is acting a little too hard all the way through.  He seems out of his mind and like he should be avoided.  At times Meridith is invisible, at other times, not.  I don't believe, and the bible does not teach that people die and become angels, so the whole idea is goofy.  But for young kids, be aware that it is about death and life after death, not really something for young kids.

However, there are some bright spots.  The idea that the mom held the family together is quite realistic, and something folks can relate to.  The idea that the little things we do affect our future, or even eternity is clear and note worthy.  It started some conversations and thoughts going in our family.  Not really a feel good movie for the holidays, but definitely of the Christmas sort.  I wouldn't buy it.  Rent it if you want an evening with adults, but again, not the best out there.",1198972800,7,1290,4.476394849785407

2661643,4,B000ION27G,"This movie I saw part of on TV, and was flipping channels between it and another that I should have just quit watching and finished this movie.

You don't have to wait till Christmas to watch it.",1198368000,4,321,4.366666666666666
2661644,5,B000ION27G,"This is an excellent movie.  One of the best I have ever watched.  It is so like what happens in many families.

2661646,5,B000ION27G,"This movie is a find!  It manages to deal with real people in a realistic way without resorting to the usual easy gimmick of making the people nasty and hostile.  The people here are not perfect, but they are sympathetic.

Also, the relationships in this family are very realistic--again without making anyone a pain or an impossible person.  Whoever wrote this had a lot of understanding of the relations between grown siblings and between grown children and their parents.

The film also explores some of the big questions of life and how important ""little things"" are in those big questions.  The mother's admitting that she gave an incomplete version of her recipe to a friend who had admired the dish, and that she had been bothered by that and wants to make it right--this was priceless.  Also, her determination to return the library book!

The transitions of the characters are well-developed and believable.  They manage to work things out without everyone suddenly becoming angelic creatures without a fault in the world.

If you like human dramas about real but decent people, this is not a film to be missed.  There are all too few like it.",1189036800,56,1152,4.826530612244898
