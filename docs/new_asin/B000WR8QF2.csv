8225330,5,B000WR8QF2,"This 56-minute documentary on the formation of the Biblical canon is the middle chapter (2007) in a series of three Ignatius Press DVDs on bible topics that feature most of the same scripture scholars. The other two discs are ""The Story of the Nativity"" (2006) and ""Did Jesus Really Rise From the Dead?"" (2008). This DVD has ""play"" and chapter stops in addition to one extra feature, an extended interview with Jesuit scripture scholar Father Mitch Pacwa SJ. These three videos get progressively better, starting with the dull ""Nativity"" film and concluding with the fast-paced and provocative resurrection film. This one is excellent, not riveting but not boring either. It moves pretty quickly through a series of interviews -- with decent graphics -- as it explains the difference between gnostic gospels (i.e. the Gospel of Thomas) and the four canonical gospels. It also explains how the canon of the Bible came together and why the gnostic gospels became lost (they vanished as the gnostic sects that maintained them died out) in addition to being excluded from the canon primarily due to their lack of historical antiquity.",1396742400,2,1130,5.080645161290323
8225331,5,B000WR8QF2,"This documentary state the facts and informs to greatest possibility of instruction. This DVD is pure instruction in the history of how and why the books left out are not Gospel.  A person who wants to know the facts needs this DVD.  Remember that the year 1054 is the birth of a Separate Roman Church, by its division from One Holy Catholic Church.  The year 326 the First Council would decide Christian Doctrine. What would be called the Roman Church was not really a concern of how the Council went.  The Roman Bishops of course went with the rest of the Church.  So in our time when attacks on the faith of the Lord occurs, the Roman Church is blamed.  This documentary confirms that it was a Council mostly of the Christian East that determined which books would be the cannon.  In our time The Roman Church being blamed for the False Gospels alimentation, this blame is too many years after the creation of Romanism in 1054.  The Christian East was primary the reason the False Gospels were left out.  The Roman Bishops did agree with the One Holy Catholic Church and the Emperor agreed with the Council.  The Emperor informed the Roman Pope what had been agreed to and the Council decision was the rule of the Empire.  There is a lot of information in this DVD that will correct the new age history and religion of our time",1393372800,,1330,4.5
8225332,1,B000WR8QF2,"If your are not a Catholic, don't buy this DVD. There have been many recent discoveries of gnostic gospels, which are interesting to me, and many books which cover them are available on Amazon. The gnostic Gospel of Judas by National Geographic on DVD can be purchased here. I highly recommend the DVDs of Joseph Campbell (Mythos in 3 parts with Susan Sarandon and the Hero's Journey, both available on Amazon) for unbelievers or those who want to learn about all religions. Campbell has also written many books on religion, including The Masks of God in 3 volumes and The Power of Myth with Bill Moyers. Finally, I would direct you to the recent release of Zeitgeist: The Movie, which points out that many Christian beliefs were taken from the Egyptians and other ancient religions and questions if Jesus really existed.",1378857600,,821,4.829787234042553

8225335,5,B000WR8QF2,"This is a good primer for the Christian or seeker who may be confused by scholars such as Elaine Pagels who claim that there were many ""competing Christianities"" and ""hundreds of Gospels"" in the early centuries. This DVD exposes the faulty postmodernist thinking behind this so-called scholarship.",1209513600,14,297,5.340425531914893
8225336,5,B000WR8QF2,"The title False or Lost Gospels may be a bit misleading. Early Christianity was surrounded by a complex world of religious diversity and many times other groups tried to 'borrow' from each other to help earn converts to their religion. In reality, that's what Gospels like Thomas, Judas, etc are all about tryin to create interest in Gnosticism by using well known names of people well known to Christians. This video makes that clear--unlike some others that try to see the Gnostics as an off shoot of Christianity (instead of a seperate religious group with Greek roots). This video is a good example of explaining a somewhat complicated situation in an understandable way.",1202515200,25,675,4.982300884955753
