8122089,2,B000FGFBNK,"Low budget, mediocre acting and dated.  These are the good qualities.  The story is an old one, good kid, bad choices. In this it's about gangs.",1510444800,,144,4.5
8122090,2,B000FGFBNK,"Yes, it's low-budget and the actors are amateur.  However, I didn't hate this film, like I do with others of this ilk.
Though made 20 years ago, it doesn't feel incredibly dated.  It's not like watching ""Square Pegs.""  This reminded me a lot of what Dr. Michael Dyson calls ""New Jack films.""  However, I think this may have come out before ""Boyz N da Hood.""  The film has a surprise twist in the middle that kept me wanting to see the whole piece.
There is a flash of female nudity, but due to its anti-gun, and possibly pro-police, message, I think parents may allow their children to watch it.
What I love is Tony Bravo.  Beautiful almost doesn't do the job in describing him.  Neutrally, his face looks like that of Dr. Clouseau.  He has delicious pecs and upper arm muscles, almost like that of adult star Earl Slate.  He has a hairy, tasty chest, like the one Patrick Warburton has.  He teases the audience by wearing sleeveless undershirts for the most part, but in the middle of this film, he goes topless and shows more of his pulchritude.  For those who like leaner and smoother men, check out Kamar de los Reyes.
The bruthaman from ""Welcome Back, Kotter"" plays a dark character here, as he has done in other projects.  Still, some viewers may have him typecasted in their minds.  Hearing him ape a foreign accent was a difficult task.
This work had no Spanish language subtitles or Spanish dubbing.  This may make it impossible for Latinos who only speak Spanish to see the film.
bell hooks, or some other womanist writer, once wrote that she loved ""Daughters of the Dust"" because unlike most films that have no or just one Black female character, that film had many sisters interacting with each other.  ""East LA Warriors"" similarly show more than one LatinO; he shows LatinOs dialoguing, fighting, and learning from each other.  That's a counterhegemonic filmic intervention.",1256774400,,1887,4.7073170731707314
