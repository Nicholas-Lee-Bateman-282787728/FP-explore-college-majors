1901297,5,B0000A2ZSN,"America's craziest family is back, and this time they're even funnier than the first season! I absolutely am addicted to this show. I can watch it over and over without ever getting sick of it. In an age where funny television shows are a dying breed, this one stands out from the rest of the reality tv/ comedy mush out right now. From Ozzy's battle to catch Moby Dick (um, fish don't like cheese, but whatever), to Kelly freaking out about her newfound fame, to Jack... well, being Jack, and of course Sharon (who at the time this season was taped was still battling cancer) who always just says whatever she wants (yay Sharon); this is a family that never ceases to have an interesting story to tell. They're the Beverly Hillbillies of the millennium (and I mean that in a nice way) - they have this balance of being just like any given American family - just as dysfunctional and crazy - only they have millions of dollars and cameras following their every move. It's basically the story of your family if your dad had been a 70's rock star.
The DVD itself is mostly like the first one. It has all 10 episodes of the season plus the option to turn on commentary by Sharon and either Aimee, Kelly, Ozzy, or Sharon's 4th child, Mimi (or Minnie?) the dog. The commentary isn't remarkable, though if you've seen all of the episodes a billion times (like me) you can just switch it on for something different while you watch the episodes. They don't say much (Sharon mostly says ""I haven't seen this"" or ""Oh my g-d, I can't believe they put that in""). I'm not sure why they thought it was a good idea to have Aimee do commentary because all she does is say how stupid her family is and criticize whatever she sees. Ozzy will occasionally mutter and say ""testing, testing,"" Kelly offers a few insights, and Mimi (or Minnie?) the dog will occasionally bark. There are a few 'bonus' clips of the family that were cut from the episodes, which are ok. There are a few games which are also mildly entertaining. The slightly amusing Ozzy translator (subtitles that can play during an episode whenever Ozzy speaks) is also back.
The bottom line... this is one of the funniest shows on tv and a fun DVD to have around to pop in and watch when you're bored or just sick of watching all of those other 'reality' shows. I got my entire family hooked on it, even though they are about the last people you'd expect to enjoy watching a dysfunctional rock star family on tv... but it's a show that can appeal to all types.",1067040000,4,2505,4.447826086956522
1901298,3,B0000A2ZSN,They just screwed everyone into buying another set is what they did.. And the one I have *does* has censored and uncensored language..,1065052800,6,134,4.869565217391305
1901299,3,B0000A2ZSN,"Just purchased this DVD, season 2. The 10 episodes are from the original airings on tv but they are ""bleeped"" out as when being aired. The packaging lists it as 10 censored and uncensored scenes. False ! The only uncensored scenes are on the bonus disc. And that disc covers some extremely vague dialogue of no interest and is a waste of time. I was dissapointed but still get a laugh out of the fumbling ways of this family. They're a family with true love and money but it never seems to amaze me of just how spoiled these children are and wonder how soon that they would crack under the pressures of the real world if anything should happen to Oz and Sharon. These antics will be played out in the years to come and we shouldn't be surprised by what we see !!! I know I won't. How fast we fall...",1064966400,6,799,4.228758169934641
1901300,5,B0000A2ZSN,"I just watched a few episodes of the 2nd Osbournes season and it was just as funny, if not funnier than the first season. Seeing Ozzy fumble around his daily life and seeing his lights go on when he is on stage is amazing. Kelly and Jack drive each other crazy as usual and Sharon is there to referee, from her sick bed.
I highly recommend anyone to buy this. I have never been a fan of Ozzy's music but I love the show. I cannot wait for the 3rd season to come out.",1064880000,8,466,3.9680851063829787

1901318,5,B0000A2ZSN,"Having started with the first season I HAD to continue on. The Second Season shows them settled into their home, new animals, beautiful yards, the kids moving into their own places in the bizness and Sharon being diagnosed.
You begin to see Ozzy slipping. More stuttering and mumbling speach patterns than in Season One. Sharon shows what a trooper she is through her battling chemo and trying to reign her family together and being the first family of reality you can't help but love them and feel for them. Ozzy breaks my heart at times.
Kelly keeps hitting and I just want to smack her up side her head and Sharon looks beautiful in the wake. I adore Jack's getting the pest's outside the gate.",1372982400,,697,4.584
1901319,5,B0000A2ZSN,"After reading Sharon's bio I had to watch their reality show which I hadn't seen before.  I must say that I really like  Sharon. I love her in ""The Talk"".  Ozzy has a split personality, in my opinion.  Sometimes he makes sense, sometimes not so much. The problem was the microphone. It was  very often difficult to understand them. You must watch these videoss (I bought all 3 seasons) with a sense of humor.  Otherwize they drive you nuts. Living in a beautiful house but they have to watch every step because nobody lets the dogs out !!! The biggest transformation in my opinion took place with Kelly. I watch Fashion Polilce and I do like her now.  She was a wild card and now she is fantastic. Well, they all went their way and I do not regret spending my time and mone for these  DVDs.  Rock n' Roll, Ozzy.",1360886400,2,811,4.317880794701987
1901320,1,B0000A2ZSN,"Not recommended, boring. The first season had a few laughs. But this season seems to be nothing but a desperate money grab, and a tool to promote Kelly's music career. Don't bother.",1356566400,,181,4.6875
1901321,5,B0000A2ZSN,I've always loved the osbournes since the show started. I was very young when I watched it so it's so nice to be able to watch my favorite disfunctional family again :),1319414400,,168,4.28125
1901322,4,B0000A2ZSN,"It took me a while to purchase this 2cd season DVD.

I got into the show mid way through the 1st season.  If NOT for this show reality TV on certain network's would not be the same now.

You have to what the episodes uncut.  ONLY way to.

This season of course is when we watch (edited of course) Sharon's battle with cancer.

OK extras on it.  Per how old the DVD package is a lot of extra steps & remote button pushes to watch individual episodes.",1235520000,,449,4.091954022988506
1901323,5,B0000A2ZSN,This was purchased as part of a set and the price was great!  The season is fun to watch.,1231632000,,89,3.6842105263157894
1901324,1,B0000A2ZSN,"Why anyone would pay 2 see this is beyond me? Here are a list of reason's why:

1.)The Osbourne family is sick and perverted. They love watching their dogs take a s--- on the carpet and think their house is all clean with just a quick spray of cleaning products over the filthy areas of their house. Kelly loves to make out with her dogs as often as possible.

2.) Jack should be forced to keep his shirt on at all times until he does not lose AT LEAST 5 STONE.

3.) Practically every inch of Ozzy's body is covered with tattoo's, he looks like a mad homeless man who has not taken a shower for weeks. As he is completely illiterate he does not know that you can become HIV positive/get hepatitis if the tatoo needle is not cleaned properly.

4.)Ozzy is an idiot, recall 'I just bought 300 pounds worth of chocolate and I don't even like it'.",1123632000,2,842,4.24375
1901325,4,B0000A2ZSN,"They're back and better than ever with season 2 of the osbournes tv show. The DVD has the first 10 episodes from season 2, commentary, bonus footage and all. This DVD is even better than season 2. The commentary differs from sharon and jack, sharon and kelly, sharon, ozzy, and ammie. There is more bonus footage in this one than the first season. No interviews though, oh well. This is definetely one of my favorite DVD's that I own.",1093824000,,434,4.506329113924051
1901326,5,B0000A2ZSN,For all Osbourne fans I recommend this dvd.  From the episodes to the fun little games at the end.  The only thing I have against the dvd is the commentary.  Both kelly and Amiee constantly complain and tear into either their siblings or parents and grandfather(aimee).  Personally jack did a better job in the previous dvd(commentary sense)!,1084579200,,342,4.947368421052632
1901327,4,B0000A2ZSN,"Ozzy and pals have done it again! This time the series is much more warm.  The fact that Sharon was diagonised with cancer only served to make the show reveal some stonger emotions.  The kids are still brats and the Oz is still a madman, but you can tell that they truly love one another.  Most reality TV is somewhat fake, and The Osbournes have obviously staged episodes, but the emotion is real.  Very good DVD.  Once again...NOT FOR KIDS.",1084406400,2,442,4.475
1901328,2,B0000A2ZSN,"Yes Season Two had some wonderful moments, but alot of it was just a phony show of wealth, and the kids trying to capitalize on their 15 minutes of fame. They are barely ever in the house together at the same time, they're always running to London or something. Kelly released her album during this time, and lets just say the charts speak for themselves. The first season was Osbournes at their best, this is like having to listen to Kelly screech while stepping in a turd from Lola",1082505600,3,483,4.438202247191011
1901329,5,B0000A2ZSN,"The season two set is incomplete. It does not include the last ten episodes of the season that were produced late in the season.
As season three has now started, hopefully the second half of season two will be released onto DVD along with the Christmas special.",1075248000,6,261,4.574468085106383
1901330,4,B0000A2ZSN,"Whether or not you may believe ""The Osbournes"" is your particular cup of tea, I feel that it has an appeal that crosses generational lines. It shouldn't be dismissed summarily.
Despite the barrage of four-letter words.
One of the things that comes across with crystal clarity is that this family really, truly, deeply loves each other. It's unquestionable and freshly without any sort of cynicism you see on pretty much every other reality show save ""Queer Eye"".
Next, due to a combination of the magic of editing and the family's natural timing, this stuff is freakin' hysterical. Ozzy's comments on the pandemic dog poo situation, Sharon's frequently lacerating comments on popular culture, and the epic bickering between the two kids is recognized by anyone who has ever been a sibling, or given birth to them.
The ability to censor the cursing is kinda fun. The bleeps are funny in their own way, when whole sentences seem to evaporate. But the unrestricted torrent of often-playful vulgarity is oh-so funny. When Ozzy berates the ocean...yes, the ocean...to quit encroaching on the fire he's trying to build in front of his Malibu home to cheer up the ill Sharon, I was giggling madly.
He's as serious as a heart attack, which makes it all the funnier. He's not cursing the fact the water is trying to extinguish the fire; he's actually expecting  the waves to respond as he yells ""F off!""
His idea to fish from the shore, using cheese as bait had me on the floor, because to Ozzy, it's common knowledge that ""fish love cheese.""
Dismiss any prejudice you may have towards this show, and watch these ten episodes (plus outtakes). This is very funny television.",1075161600,,1664,4.838596491228071
1901331,5,B0000A2ZSN,"Everyone says that the Osbournes are not a typical American family, well what is the typical American family?  Sharon is such a sweetie, Jack and Kelly are great, and Ozzy is a great artist.  I'm glad that they are allowing us to venture into the Land of Oz.  The Osbournes is a funny TV show and I plan on buying the next DVD.  Keep rockin!",1074643200,,341,4.2
1901332,1,B0000A2ZSN,"Ozzy, is a rock megastar, but thats music. As for this family, they are totally and utterly f***ed.  Kelly Osbourne, can't sing, and would be nothing if it weren't for her father, Jack, the gormless kid with the drug problems is plain daft. And Sharon is a typical self centered women, who belives that she is actually intelligent, though if it weren't for 'daddys money' nobody would have ever heard of her.  I can some up this family in one from watching this DVD and the word is 'SIMPLE'!",1073779200,2,491,4.50561797752809
1901333,5,B0000A2ZSN,"They are not the typical American family, when it comes to the language. But the love they share, is what we all need.
Is there a house out there, that has sibling that don't fight? How about a spouse with a few problems? How about problematic children or teenagers? If you do than you need to write a book. Because what you see on the Osbournes is the truth of a real life family. We all don't use their language, but there problems are typical. I especially loved the re-newing of the vows. That was very special, especially after Ossie reunited Sharon with her Dad! Than her Dad gave her away at the wedding.
Ossie, you are so special.
I also could identify, with Sharon, and the entire family during her heath crisis. I have been there, and no matter what a family looks like on the outside, this family pulled together to get her through, and she maintained as much of a normal life as she could for them. I LOVE THE OSBOURNES! WE COULD LEARN HOW TO LOVE FROM THIS FAMILY!",1070064000,3,977,4.344262295081967
