7897125,4,6305865639,"White Wolves II...Quality to film to dvd transfer excellant.  Shots are perfect and so is the audio.  Story line is very good and so is the cast.  Ernie Reyes Jr., plays a nice character but again, like in Surf Ninjas, we do not get enough of him.  A very uplifting film for the whole family and a few privilaged friends.

7897126,5,6305865639,"White Wolves II is a part of the White Wolves series of films. All of the movies in this series are stand-alone films, so it is not necessary to watch the first one before watching this one.

Synopsis (possible spoilers): A young naturalist (Nemec) takes a group of troubled teens on a backpacking trip in order to research wolves. The teens face challenges, including dealing with their past hardships, getting along with each other, taking care of a pair of orphaned cubs, and jealousy when they meet two brothers who are in search of the ultimate adventure. Then, when an unexpected accident occurs, the teens must put aside their difference and work together in order to survive.

I remember watching White Wolves 2 often when I was younger and recently purchased it. It is still as great as I remember. Over acted at times, with unintentionally humorous ""emotional scenes"", it's just wholesome entertainment. The cast includes Corin Nemec, Justin Whalin, Ele Keats, Elizabeth Berkley, Jeremy London, and Ernie Reyes Jr. Definitely recommended.

The company that released this version has edited the movie to make it ""family-friendly"". At least 5 minutes have been cut.",1206748800,,1173,5.067357512953368
