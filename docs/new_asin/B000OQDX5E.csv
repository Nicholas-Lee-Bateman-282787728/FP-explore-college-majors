2799065,1,B000OQDX5E,"unbelievable. and not in a good way. i'm muslim, so i know mainly what its like. but i was completely shocked at how they portrayed everything. dancing ang swimmin in front of guys. showing her hair only because he was upset .. it felt wrong. there are muslims who aren't scarved, like sabah, so why couldn't they make the character like that. by scarving her, they made it worse when they made her show her body nd hair. some of the acting was good, and i watched it twice, but it doesnt mean i don't have comments. im sorry i am commenting badly, but its what i genuinly feel. i felt it was a complete crock at muslims, and gave us a vry bad name.",1225756800,2,649,4.2
2799066,5,B000OQDX5E,This is a truly lovely little movie that celebrates the best impulses in human beings. The fact that it deals with Syrian Mulsims is incidental. Its story could easily apply to any other ethnic group at its moment of moving from insularity to full citizenship in a larger culture. You. Will. Love. It.,1222819200,12,301,4.69811320754717
2799067,4,B000OQDX5E,"being Arabic + Muslim girl from ME, shocked *at first* from this movie idea. it gives wrong idea about what we should do (e.g: wearing Hijab) and what we shouldn't do (e.g: wearing Bikini in Public, Drinking wine), at the same time i can't deny that it-can-happens-in-real-life.

being educated & open-minded at the same time, love can happens between any couples.

2799069,3,B000OQDX5E,"In this film we meet Sabah and her close knit family of older mother, married brother (who has daughter) and her sister- apparently married.  Sabah has never been married and she is 40 year old and single. She takes care of her sckly mother.  Sabah's father is deceased so the role of the family patriarch is taken over by her older brother.  She lives by stict islamic rules and rarely leaves her immigrant Syrian neighborhood.  There are codes of conduct to be followed: woman's head must be covered when she is in public, woman is not to walk alone after sundown, there is no dating, only arranged marriages and having no other obligations it is Sabah's duty to be a caregiver to her sick mother (who does not look all that sick anyway, just a little bit too overbearing).  When Sabah meets a local nice Canadian guy, self employed, divorced, carpenter/artist, willing to learn about her, her family and her culture, the family is about to explode with idea that she is dating a ""foreigner"".  An absurd idea considering that is it Sabah's family living in Canada and if anyone is a foreigner it is her and her family unwilling to assimilate or at least adopt to the customs of the country they live in.  There is nothing you have not seen before in this story of spinster-turned-bride in her middle age.  It is a cute little past time movie.  Do not expect too much of it.",1215302400,7,1375,4.534412955465587
2799070,5,B000OQDX5E,"I stumbled upon ""Sabah"" on The Sundance Channel and was very glad to see it released on DVD. ""Sabah"" is a surprisingly touching film that is engaging and beautifully acted. It's a throwback to a long gone era of romantic films. And not a major Hollywood star in sight (thank goodness). Arsinee Khanjian gives a wonderful performance as Sabah, a middle-aged woman struggling to find freedom in love while being stuck inside her strict Muslim family. The real treat is Shawn Doyle as her would-be suitor. ""Sabah"" is a sweet little film that tells a universal story of love and romance.",1193875200,22,583,4.782178217821782
2799071,4,B000OQDX5E,"This movie was very interesting and visually entertaining. I don't know much at all about how Muslims live, so in addition to the story, I enjoyed looking at the set, the costumes, the behavior. Sure, the acting was a bit clumsy at times, and the plot was quite obvious. There are other points that might not be really polished, but it's not a big budget, cast of thousands production.

As obvious as the joke was about avoiding an arranged marriage by pretending to be ultra-observant when the suiter is more Westernized, it was still hilarious.

The belly dancing was very nice; I really enjoyed that.

Most of all, I liked the message: open your minds, include others, explain your situation, share your problems with those who love you. They're likely to understand and help.",1192320000,,779,4.798507462686567
2799072,3,B000OQDX5E,"Sabah is a sweet My Big Fat Greek Wedding, only with Syrian Muslims. Some of the acting is shaky, especially in the beginning. Family members in the first scenes have to explain things to the audience in a bit too much explication. Strange then that the family relationships of all the people don't get sorted out very well. Are there four sisters? Three sisters and a daughter? Two sisters, a sister-in-law, and a daughter? Bingo!

But the funny, predictable moments of the forbidden romance, and the tender feelings and slow courtship of the couple in question, will satisfy viewers who stick with it past the first 15 minutes. Expect standard culture-clash jokes and tension, but in a fairly satisfying romantic comedy concoction.",1183248000,7,733,5.008196721311475
2799073,3,B000OQDX5E,"Syrian Muslim woman turns 40, takes up swimming again and meets a Candian man at the pool.  One thing leads to another and soon she finds herself in love with the man, which goes against the teachings of her family.  It's a pretty predictable set up and we just get to sit and watch the drama play out.

The cast is good.  I didn't find the lead actress very compelling which is probably why I didn't really care if the romance worked out or not.  It's not just that she wasn't beautiful by traditional standards; she just seemed lack luster all around.  Even when she learned the traditional dances, she seemed stiff and wooden.  The Canadian fellow was quite charming and good looking so I had a hard time seeing what kept him going after her in spite of the obvious cultural problems.

The rest of the cast was fine.  The mother, who was supposed to be at death's door was  attractive and looked more vital and interesting than Sabah.  The rebellious niece who taught Sabah to dance was very cute; the scenes of her dancing were the best parts of the film.

Mostly I think the film suffers from lack of character complexity.  Most of the characters were one dimensional and their behavior was predictable.  The only surprise was that of the financial situation, but that was resolved in such a predictable way that I failed to believe it.  This is a well intentioned film but it failed to move me in any real way.",1340582400,,1416,4.4765625
2799074,5,B000OQDX5E,"This is a beautifully acted love story.  First discovered this director from her film ""Cairo Time"" which is one of my favourite movies, so decided to look up her other works and I was not disappointed with ""Sabah"".  I love movies about relationships and emotions.",1331769600,,263,4.822222222222222
2799075,1,B000OQDX5E,truly an awful movie. aside from the numerous irrelevant and uninteresting scenes scattered throughout this movie it is both socially and' culturally inaccurate. it displays both the western and muslim world as one-dimensional with every reference based completely off over-played stereotypes. it insults islam and muslim women everywhere' by degrading the hijab and by making a mockery of verses from the Qur'an. additionally the actors are hideous looking and their acting is similar.,1324684800,,486,5.671232876712328
2799076,5,B000OQDX5E,"This is one of my favorite movies and I have watched it on the internet and on cable.  I decided to order it and was very satisfied with the vendor who sent it even earlier than originally believed.  It's a great simple love story and character study.  I compare it with another favorite of mine, 1955's ""Marty"" and just about anything that the director Lasse Halstrom has directed.  It's so nice not to have all of the special effects, gun fire or explosion's and just concentrate on the characters and story.",1324684800,,510,4.571428571428571
2799077,5,B000OQDX5E,"I am a sucker for a good unconventional love story. Where people work to overcome the divferences that we are told should keep us apart. Religion, gender, politics, race. This was a simple movie with a WONDERFUL message. It did much to not set up a dynamic where intercultural relationships are the ultimate goal. Instead it showed a variety of different types of love in the various family members. It really resonates with me, and I have watched it twice in two days. Make that three times in two days. Very. Very. Simple. Very, very Beautiful.",1323475200,,546,4.697916666666667
2799078,5,B000OQDX5E,"This 2005 Canadian film is a lightweight look at a cross cultural romance between a 40 year old unmarried Muslim woman named Sabah and a Canadian carpenter.  Sabah takes care of her mother and has been the dutiful daughter all her life.  There is conflict in the family though because her 18-year-old niece is resisting the matchmaking efforts her father, Sabah's brother, who heads the family as the only male.

How this all turns out is a predictable romp through the ups and downs of Sabah's secret love and the struggles of the immigrant family to adapt to modern culture and still enjoy their heritage.  The film is enhanced by the fine acting of Arsinee Khanjian cast as Sabah.  She does not have traditional good looks, but the expressions on her face make her endearing and it is easy to identify with her conflicts.

The film is fast paced enough for my taste and I found myself caught up in it even though there was no doubt in my mind how it would end.  It might not be totally believable but in spite of this, I enjoyed it completely.",1309392000,,1046,4.502645502645502
2799079,5,B000OQDX5E,"Sabah A Love Story is exactly that, It's not meant to be a Documentary of Muslim Life. Its a  Love Story. Set in Canada, Sabah's story spans a period of a year, begins on her 40th Birthday, ends on her 41st . Sabah brilliantly played by the Award Winning Arsine Khanjian, is a woman who has been deprived of a life,  in order to look after their Mother. Sabah and Steven's relationship begins at a Community swimming pool. Swimming is something she used to love and has not done in a very long time. Their attraction to one another is instant; they meet weekly at the pool followed by coffee or Lunch. Get to know each other, their common likes such as Opera, Steven begins to learn lessons of what pursuing a relationship with this woman will mean. Steven reveals at one of their coffee clutches that he is divorced, Sabah is void of understanding ""Divorce"". She fears this may have killed any real hope of furthering their relationship, when Steven asks her out on a real date.  But Sabah must keep this relationship a secrete from: Her older sister, Shaheera, is Conservative, and looking Marry her, westernized daughter, Souhaire, off to the highest bidder, older brother, Majid, head of the family, who tries to rule with an Iron Fist. Majid's Wife Amal, modern and has her own secrets. Souhaire, the only one to know about Steven and her Mother who is somewhere between Conservative and Modern. Again this is not a Documentary, it's a story. As Sabah's love for Steven grows, her ability to ""Bend the Rules"" does also. Sabah emotionally moves away from her family and closer to Steven. Steven tries to understand Sabah and Islam. Sabah tries to bend with out breaking to the point of Loosing her family or Steven. The Acting by the Leads is Strong, their chemistry, remarkable. The ensemble is good. No rated, there is one use of foul language, No nudity but yes an Adult situation, lets be honest, Day Time Soap Operas are more offensive than Sabah A Love Story. Likely would have been PG.",1303344000,,1996,4.632768361581921
2799080,4,B000OQDX5E,"While a Syrian-Canadian family is obsessed with finding the appropriate husband for young Souhaire (who wants to choose her own husband), her 40 year old aunt meets an atheist carpenter (Stephen, played by Shawn Doyle) at a public swimming pool.  The aunt, Sabah (played flawlessly by Arsine Khanjian), slowly comes out of her traditional shell, and explores the delights of being in the company of an interesting person, regardless of religion or background (although Stephen is a bit more pouty than I like).  As she falls in love with Stephen, she also dreads the inevitable clash with her family, particularly the authoritarian brother, Majid.

Sabah: A Love Story does not use supermodels to portray real people.  Every character has physical or behavioral flaws.  Souhaire's attempts to turn off her suitor with a overly traditional act was a hoot, as was Sabah's real angst when an unknown man accidentally picked up and used her towel at the pool.

This was just a pleasant movie throughout.  Yes, you knew the clashes would come.  And you'll expect some sort of resolution.  But this predictability doesn't detract from the sensitivity of Sabah's growing awareness of herself.

In English, with subtitles during the Arabic exchanges.",1296518400,9,1242,5.165
2799081,4,B000OQDX5E,"Having known some Muslims, I know like any faith, the rules they adhere to are all over the map.
This movie is inconsistent within itself. But, I don't think it was written as a anthropological study.

It's a love story, so lighten up.

Sabah is a 40 year old woman, that takes care of her Mom and is supported by her brother while doing so.  Her brother; now the head of the family since his father died, calls the shots for the family.  He overlooks not only her finances, but also how she lives her life.  She is somewhat headstrong and has avoided being paired off in the past.  Chaffing against the strict Muslim rules she has decided to pursued her love of swimming.  This leads to a chance meeting of a single Christian man, who she forms a first a friendship with. Over time, it blossoms to much more. In the mean time, her young niece is being paired off by her brother in lieu of being sent to a university. This is very much not to Sabah or her niece's liking. Things come to a crucial point for the niece.  Other issues are revealed and Sabah's budding relationship needs to end or be made known.  All of these factors force the family to reconsider how they have been living.

Besides the peculiar mix of Muslim inconsistencies:
Sabah nearly has a unibrow, but her mother's, are painted on.
Sabah's brother's wife, does not wear a hijab, but the older sister is expected to.  Muslim's I knew it was stricter for married women than single ones. But then the brother's wife is not from the old country.
Sabah's mother to me except for the grey hair looks younger than Sabah.
Sabah's mother seems ditzy (maybe Alzheimers is implied) not infirm in any way, so caring for her makes no sense.

This is a movie to be taken lightly and not examined too closely.
I find the love interest character Steve, to be fairly shallowly handled. He is defensive about his divorce and felt his wife traded up (his exact words).  Though he is clearly interested in learning more about Sabah's culture, his character in only lightly handled.  He does come across as a sweet gentle man.  Being quite attractive doesn't hurt either.

This is a nice light ""Cinderella"" story and pleasant to watch.",1293494400,3,2186,4.524173027989822
2799082,3,B000OQDX5E,"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie, which popped up as an instant play on a movie rental website I subscribe to. It tells the story of a Syrian Muslim woman, who has been living with her extended family in Canada for many years. Sabah, the central character, is a 40-year-old unmarried woman who is unemployed and cares for her mother (unfortunately, though Sabah is supposed to be caring for an ailing older woman, the actress that plays Sabah's mother does not appear to be very ill nor very old!). Sabah's family is headed by older brother Majid, who has taken on the role of family patriarch after the death of Sabah's beloved dad. Majid is very strict with the women in his family, which include a sister and her rebellious teenage daughter. Ironically, Majid's own wife does not don the hijab, or head covering, unlike the other women in the family.

There are some inconsistencies in the portrayal of the Muslim culture here. I say this because I spent my childhood in Malaysia, a Muslim nation and was able to observe how Muslim women dressed and behaved. In this movie, Sabah walks about outside with a headscarf, but then she wears revealing dresses with the scarf! This is not how an observant Muslim woman would dress. That being said, Sabah's character is not credible in some aspects - she is strict about wearing the scarf, yet she wears a bathing suit in a public swimming pool which is where she first meets Steven, the potential love interest.

These inconsistencies affected the credibility of the story, yet I enjoyed the movie because the two main actors, i.e. Sabah and Steven portrayed their roles very well. Sabah's struggles to come to terms with her burgeoning and long suppressed sexuality and independence are credibly portrayed by the actress. Steven's role as the unsuspecting Canadian 'infidel' who grows to love Sabah despite the culture clash is also well acted. It is a sweet and poignant love story which makes for a fun and interesting watch, but it does oversimplify certain aspects such as the sudden acceptance of Steven by Sabah's family, etc. Overall, a fun watch.",1291420800,,2111,4.81267217630854

8186228,5,B000OQDX5E,"Sabah's theme is definitely familiar. It tackles the clash between Arab culture and tradition against the Western one. Although many have seen this in a lot of films,this Canadian film somewhat refreshing due to its being light and downbeat.

The film is about Sabah,a 40-year-old Muslim spinster that who still lives at home in Toronto. She looks after her mother since her father died and is somewhat the person who holds the family together in times of crisis and difficult situation. Majid,who is her brother,still upholds the Arab culture and tradition particularly treating women a class lower compared to men and who is still in favor of arranged marriage. His daughter Souhaire,played by the gorgeous Fadia Nadda,is the modern in his views as she is against an arranged marriage that father wants her to have. Also,we get to see Sabah fall in love with a Canadian divorce and faces a lot of difficulties in their relationship particularly when she wants to hide it from the family particularly his brother due to being a foreigner.

Sabah tries to focus on how the women - like Sabah and Souhaire - who don't play by the rules when it comes to the tradition they have to uphold and their arguments with Majid particularly when in comes to having an arranged marriage. Although it is light and funny,I felt that the resolution of the story was somewhat forced and far from being believable considering that it was expected to have a happy ending especially when it comes to the subject it tackles. Also,I felt that some of the characters aren't interesting enough for the viewer to really care about. Added to that,I felt that the dancing scenes were somewhat out of place and the conversation mixing English and a foreign language serve as a distraction to the story. Finally,if not for the presence of Fadia Nadda,this film would be somewhat boring as it doesn't really elicit that much laughter from the other cast. But nevertheless,this film manages to entertain despite of the fact that it could have been a better one.",1433376000,,2031,4.85014409221902

Sabah lives with her mother and is her designated guardian.  There is also an older brother, his wife, another sister and her daughter.  All of the women are under the thumb of the eldest who is doing the late father's bidding by looking after all of them.  The niece absolutely dismisses the customs of Muslim dress, behavior and absolutely refuses to succumb to the tradition of having a husband picked out for her.  Sabah is continually sneaking around, making up stories, and trying desperately to be with Steven, her new friend.  Watching all these antics take place is funny as well as being frustrating not only to Sabah but Steven who wants very badly to make this relationship work.  Can you be faithful to your family's faith and culture and still try to blend in to the Canadian ways?  Is it also important to be with the one you love?  I loved the part where Steven picks up a book called ""Muslim for Dummies"" in his effort to try and understand Sabah and her strict customs.
