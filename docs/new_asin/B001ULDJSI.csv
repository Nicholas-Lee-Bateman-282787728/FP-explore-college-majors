8344360,5,B001ULDJSI,Playing is always a small group activity and it was great to hear others discuss it. Interviewees reminded me of players and games from the past.,1508630400,,145,4.615384615384615
8344361,5,B001ULDJSI,"This is a very nice, indie movie that describes what role-playing games are for a broad audience.

As a gamer, I was already familiar with the types of games described in the film, but this would be a heaven send if you are trying to explain to a partner or parent what the games you play are all about.

There are bits of gamer humor spread throughout the film.",1461024000,,362,4.231884057971015
8344362,5,B001ULDJSI,Great documentary! An interesting insight into the RPGs community and the people that play the games.,1442361600,,101,5.375
8344363,4,B001ULDJSI,"The thing I didn't like was menu system, it's completely unnecessary, I don't see a need unless you are talking about a multiple episodes of say something like like 'Dungeons and Dragons' the Animated Series, 27 episodes, each one about 23min, so that's why you would need a menu system, otherwise for a 2-3hr movie, it's distracting and doesn't make sense.
I thing I liked the most about RPG is that it really dealt with the negative aspects that people have of RPG players and the real people views about those that play RPG, many thinking they are dorks or nerds only, but you'll be surprised.",1362182400,,596,4.632075471698113
8344364,5,B001ULDJSI,"I thought... this could be interesting, I dig the online role playing stuff... but I had no idea there were so many people from so many walks of life playing these role playing games.  I thought it would be like the star trek thing or something, but this goes deeper then a worship of stars... this is about being the stars.  So much imagination needed and willingness to let yourself go.  I mean to think the guy who works in the cubicle next to you who you think is kind of boring may be going home at night and killing dragons and using spells to stop his enemy.
Watching this kind of made me think I'm the guy in the next cubicle who is kind of boring.  Definitely worth checking out!",1302825600,,688,4.229007633587786
8344365,5,B001ULDJSI,"I was unfamiliar with the whole idea of role playing games before viewing this very funny and informative documentary.
The narrator brings you right into the action, and makes the whole phenomena understandable.  Highly recommend this!",1294531200,,235,5.527777777777778
8344366,5,B001ULDJSI,"RPG, or Role Playing Games, are a whole lot of fun according to this lively documentary directed by and starring Louis Roth.  The games appear to be a lot of fun, but so is the movie itself.  Louis brings us into this world, showing us what it's all about and introducing us to players at a RPG convention.  Not afraid to poke a little fun at these people and their passions, the docu never loses sight of it's affection for the game or those who love to play it.  In fact, you may find yourself anxious to try it for yourself after watching this.",1246752000,,547,4.230769230769231
