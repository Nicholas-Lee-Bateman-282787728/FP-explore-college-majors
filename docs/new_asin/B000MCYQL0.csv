8167928,3,B000MCYQL0,"Of all the movies out there that never needed to be remade, here is one crying out for a big budget remake.

Funky leads, interesting twists (that could be seriously upgraded and CG'd), a sexy snake dance, motorcycles and US surplus trucks. Terrifying the locals. Fires and druid priests.

Mix well with Night of the Minotaur, and remake !

Got this on VHS to check it out, and the print is pretty bad, but don't think it is worth buying the DVD unless you are a writer. This looks like another movie made by the stunt guys !",1294012800,,525,4.336734693877551
8167929,2,B000MCYQL0,"I must admit that I didn't like ""Werewolves on Wheels"" very much. It's plodding, and tries to bore the audience into submission with countless shots of bikers riding across the desert southwest, lots of closeups of campfires, and a muddled plot that gets totally lost amid the numerous scenes of disjointed pseudo-mayhem. I gave it two stars because I appreciated the truly bizarre concept of inserting a werewolf into a biker movie and expecting it to work. Despite all the sleaziness, terribly choreographed fight scenes, bogus criminal mischief, satanic monks, and surely improvised padding, all hope for a comprehensible and enjoyable film somehow evaporated. I particularly appreciated the scene where the biker runs through a pasture frightening some cattle. Bikers tease cows! Now that's excitement.

The acting is generally terrible, which is explained by noting that they had the budget for six actors, and the rest of the bikers were played by actual bikers, while the satanic monks were a commune of hippies who worked for food. The production is quite cheap and the lighting is especially poor. Most annoying is the deceptive title: at no point is there a pack of werewolves on bikes, in fact there's only one in full lycanthropic regalia unless I missed something (which is entirely possible given the mind-numbing level of boredom that had set in by the conclusion of the film when the werewolf finally appeared).

The plot (disjointed as it is) concerns a group of bikers who encounter a group of satanic monks led by ""One"" (Severn Darden). They are offered bread and wine by the monks, but it's drugged and the monks take biker chick Helen (D. J. Anderson) to use in a ridiculous black cat and snake-intensive ritual that highlights the multiple inappropriate and laughable dance sequences in the film. After the black magic wedding of Satanella, the bikers wake up, decimate the monks (in one of the many horribly choreographed fighting and wrestling scenes in the movie), snatch Helen and get back on the road to ride some more while the soundtrack churns out more terrible omnipresent folk music.

A major plotpoint and time-wasting feature is the recurring gas pumping motif, which teaches us that bikers don't like paying for gas, or like gas station attendants very much either. Since there are no sympathetic characters in the whole lot, I breathed a sigh of relief when the cast members started getting attacked at night by an unknown evildoer which set up a system of dueling evils between the bikers and satanic monks (""We're gonna' kill us some monks, man."") This could have been interesting if it was handled better, but instead the bikers spend most of the last half of the movie getting lost in the mysterious desert, wrestling with each other, and (finally) outing their undercover lycanthrope in full makeup (which is by itself pretty hilarious). The conclusion is abrupt, unsurprising, and ultimately unrewarding, just like the rest of the movie.

While the film started with a few conceptual possibilities, it quickly lost momentum and became much more boring than the title would seem to indicate. Unless you are a werewolf or biker movie completist, feel free to skip ""Werewolves on Wheels.""",1277769600,,3227,5.037453183520599
