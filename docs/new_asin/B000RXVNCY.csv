2876060,3,B000RXVNCY,"This edition of Midnight Movies offers two non-Hammer British horror films from the early-1960s. Both are competently made. ""Witchcraft"" is probably the better of the two. Directed by Don Sharp after his Hammer outing ""Kiss of the Vampire,"" it's in atmospheric black-and-white and offers Lon Chaney, Jr. as a warlock. Chaney looks tired and blusters a lot as a somewhat improbable British squire, but he is sincere enough in his approach to the role. He can't be faulted for not being Christopher Lee or Vincent Price.
""Devils of Darkness"" is in color and tries merging vampirism and Satanism, much less successfully than in the aforementioned ""Kiss of the Vampire."" It's one of those ""guilty pleasure"" films. This one especially shows quite clearly why Hammer Films were the gold standard for British horrors at the time.",1193011200,6,822,5.0962962962962965
2876061,4,B000RXVNCY,"Fans of classic horror movies will be very pleased with this outstanding double feature, part of the new wave of the Midnite Movies series.

DEVILS OF DARKNESS (1965) is an enjoyable British gem from the mid-60's, starring William Sylvester and Carole Gray in leading roles.  Paul Baxter (William Sylvester), a vacationing American tourist stumbles across a small village where devil worshippers congregate on a regular basis.  After his girlfriend is abducted, he steals the powerful talisman belonging to Count Sinistre (Hubert Noel) and his ""chosen bride"" Tania (Carole Gray).  Sinistre will stop at nothing to re-claim the talisman, even luring Baxter with swinging red-headed model Karen (Tracy Reed).

Beautifully shot on EastmanColor filmstock, DEVILS OF DARKNESS looks really spiffy on DVD.  Fans of Carole Gray will be especially interested in this title.  Best-remembered for playing Cliff Richard's spunky girlfriend in ""The Young Ones""; Gray has a very substantial role in DEVILS OF DARKNESS, playing the ill-fated gypsy maiden who becomes Sinistre's immortal bride.  It was originally released as a double bill with Fox's ""The Curse of the Fly"", which also co-starred Carole Gray and can be found in the superb Fly Collection box set.

WITCHCRAFT, filmed the previous year, makes for a perfect companion piece.  Horror movie legend Lon Chaney Jr. stars as Morgan Whitlock, at the center of an age-old feud between two dynasties.  When the graveyard of the Whitlock clan is disturbed during an excavation, witch-matriarch Vanessa Whitlock (played by Yvette Rees in a truly-unsettling performance) returns from the dead to seek her revenge on the Lanier family.  The cast also features Diane Clare and Jack Hedley.

Starkly-filmed in black and white, WITCHCRAFT makes for an ideal companion movie for DEVILS OF DARKNESS.  Each movie has it's own disc, with bonus animated picture gallery (DEVILS OF DARKNESS also has a brief trailer in b&w).",1191369600,66,1952,5.336601307189542
2876062,4,B000RXVNCY,"A little dissapointed ""Witchcraft"" is not widescreen. Only the titles are in 1.66.1, the ratio of British films of the period. Still, mustn't grumble. Never thought this forgotten film had a chance of a release. Must be Witchcraft!

I have reviewed it elsewhere but suffice to say that it was the first horror film I was ever allowed to stay up and watch and I have a soft spot for it. Aspects of it are routine, but there are at least three or four great scenes to make it worthwhile. It is also beautifully lit. I like the small details, like the resurrected witch's puzzlement at rain after being ""away"" for so long. Also, it is the female characters that confront her alone, and their facial reactions are spot-on. Oh, and did I mention that the vengeful witch - Vanessa Whitlock - is absolutely cracking? I reckon there is a cheeky lift from Sunset Boulevard in one scene. You'll know it when you see it!

You would think a combination of Pressburger, Beat Generation and French fruitiness could not possibly bore but ""The Devils of Darkness"" manages it in spades. Best treated as a comedy. The funniest moment is when Victor Brooks enters a scene playing exactly the same role as an Inspector he did in ""Witchcraft"", almost as if he exited one door in black and white and entered another in colour. Also, I can't bear ""give the game away"" names like ""Dr De'ath"", ""Mr Diabolique"" or, in this instance, ""Count Sinistre."" I know its his secret name, but really!

Get this DVD for Witchcraft, which is a minor classic.",1191110400,5,1520,4.601476014760148
2876063,4,B000RXVNCY,"This double feature offers two rarely seen mid-sixties British horror films. ""Witchcraft"" has Lon Chaney Jr. as a warlock seeking revenge on a rival family for desecrating his family's ancient cemetary. A centuries old witch arises from her tomb to carry out the murderous task. Good acting, atmosphere and a sublime sense of dread permeate the b&w film. And the witch, Vanessa (Yvette Rees) is truly creepy. Fine print of a good supernatural chiller. The 2nd disc is ""Devils of Darkness"", another rarely seen mid-60's color film about a centuries old satan-worshipping vampire (Hubert Noel) seeking a missing talisman and a new bride in modern day Chelsea among some bizarre, ultra-hip party people. Turns out he has a slavish following and his ""old"" bride (Carole Gray) is getting really jealous over his new find, a jaded model with very heavy eye make-up. This is a low budget, very strange film. An excellent print enhances what seems to be a dream-like quality that some may write off to low production values. It's virtually blood-less but has an odd style that makes it watchable. A good deal on both films and definitely worth a look, especially ""Witchcraft"". Enjoy.",1189728000,32,1175,5.0
2876064,3,B000RXVNCY,"Here are two interesting horror titles from the 1960s that have been hitherto unavailable to DVD.  'Witchcraft,' blessed with a commendable performance by Lon Chaney Jr., is quite a surprise:  low key lighting, quietly suspenseful, graced with beautiful black and white photography.  Certainly not a classic but well-made fun.  'Devils' is not in the same league but still enjoyable.  If you enjoy the Midnight Movies series, this is a welcome addition to it.",1421193600,,459,5.232876712328767

2876067,2,B000RXVNCY,"After seeing Burn Witch Burn, I thought these two British witcheries might be as good.  Not so.  Both plodded on requiring a great effort to stay awake.  My wife alternately fidgeted and napped.  Burn Witch Burn was far superior to either of these shows in every way -- acting, suspense, and terror without gore.  I won't watch either of these again and will try to return them to Amazon.",1400889600,2,388,4.565217391304348
2876068,4,B000RXVNCY,"Put that together and you come up with a 4 star rating for this 2 DVD offering. I had read about WITCHCRAFT (1964) for years in anthologies about British horror films but I had never seen it until I purchased this set a few years back. While undeniably low budget, it was definitely a quality example of the less is more school of filmmaking. It also happens to be the last in the all too brief subgenre of British black & white modern day occult thrillers that began with NIGHT/CURSE OF THE DEMON (1957) to be followed by CITY OF THE DEAD/HORROR HOTEL (1960) and then NIGHT OF THE EAGLE/BURN, WITCH, BURN (1962). It's also the only one not to have its name changed for American release. Watching it again for my traditional May Day Eve horror movie viewing, I was pleasantly surprised to see that it is still as good as the first time I saw it. Although Lon Chaney Jr seems out of his element in this setting, the rest of the British cast is rock solid and Yvette Rees as the resurrected witch is terrifying and she never says a word.

It then occured to me that I might not have watched the second film in the set, DEVILS OF DARKNESS (1965), and as it turned out, I hadn't. Originally released on a double bill with CURSE OF THE FLY, the third and final installment in that series until Jeff Goldblum came along many years later, DEVILS is lacking in everything that WITCHCRAFT possesses. The color photography is good but not evocative, the script is rather flat and full of inconsistencies, and the performances by mostly unknowns are generally lukewarm.. The principal villain, despite his character's name, is hardly sinister at all which is a serious handicap. The film does score points for the then contemporary beatnik scene parties (full of ""lesbians"" who smoke pot) and for a few striking images that linger afterwards. Nevertheless this is not even a poor man's Hammer offering and it isn't surprising that Planet, the production company, quickly went out of business. Still it's a definite curio and along with WITCHCRAFT, this disc is of value to old school horror afficionados.",1399248000,3,2093,4.6567567567567565
2876069,5,B000RXVNCY,I liked the fact I could find a great 2 for 1 deal at such a good price. The DVD was shipped fast and I was quite pleased to add this to my horror film collection.,1394409600,2,163,3.5555555555555554

2876072,3,B000RXVNCY,"I first saw ""Witchcraft"" in my father's small town movie theater, and I remember it scared the crap out of me.  40+ years later I can almost laugh about it.  I actually didn't even remember the title, but a little search online and I found it.

People in this movie don't do QUITE as many stupid things as they do in the more current ""slasher"" genre, but there aren't many horror movies where people do act rationally, and of course that's part of the fun.  At least in this one I didn't end up rooting for the side of evil just because the ""good"" side was so stupid.

A great movie where you can suspend disbelief on a quite weekend afternoon or evening.",1363996800,2,655,4.2926829268292686
2876073,5,B000RXVNCY,I bought this because I loved the Devils of Darkness. Witchcraft is a classic horror movie - if you love these kinds of movies.,1357171200,,127,4.333333333333333
2876074,3,B000RXVNCY,"I saw this earlier today, and the subject of death is a very serious one to me. I know from losing my wife, and worried about dying myself. The first scene is where you see a bulldozer going over tombstones to make way for a new shopping mall. I am doing the review for ""Witchcraft"" as I didn't see the other one. This is a classic satanic film which takes you into the world of Satan. It's also a battle between God and Satan in which two families are at war with each other. The Whitlocks and Laniers. Mr. Whitlock is a Satanist, and his beef with the Laniers goes back over 300 years in which the Laniers claim it was for the greater good of God that they hate the Whitlocks, and the Whitlocks feel that the Laniers are opprtunitists. At the center of this is a ancestor of the Whitlocks was accused, and convicted of witchcraft, and her punishment was that she was buried alive. The Laniers are the ones responsible for the new shopping mall being put in, or their partner in construction is, and he is the one who o.k.'s the bulldozing of the cemetary which so happens belongs to the Whitlocks. Also at the center of this is a love affair with Amy Whitlock, and Troy Lanier. However, Satan comes first per her Uncle Mr. Whitlock. The battle's afoot when Laniers start to die, or disappear, but the battle belongs to God, and in the end God wins as Amy sacrifies herself, so no more people have to die. This was filmed in England, and definitely on a low budget as most of the actors other than Lon Chaney in probably one of his last roles no one is familiar. This is still a decent flick for those who are intrigued by Satan.",1249344000,,1630,4.295454545454546
2876075,3,B000RXVNCY,"A couple of OK British occult thrillers here. DEVILS pits American tourist William Sylvester against the ancient French satanist ""Count Sinestre"" (Hubert Noel) in for possession of the latter's magical talisman, which has fallen into Sylvester's hands. Despite the dark trappings, the whole affair has the Eastmancolor punch of one of the better AIP Beach Party Movies. Reds aren't just red, baby, they're RED! This finds a superior companion in WITCHCRAFT, an atmospheric black & white shocker about an centuries-old rivalry between two British families renewed when one family plans a major redevelopment of the village and razes the other family's ancient graveyard as one of their first priorities, causing its long-dead matriarch (an impressive Yvette Rees) to rise from her grave for payback alongside her devil-worshipping descendants, led by Lon Chaney Jr. Great stuff.",1241308800,2,877,5.503703703703704
2876076,3,B000RXVNCY,"Witchcraft (1964) This is a pretty good little scareflick from Great Britain which gave Lon Chaney Jr. his last quality horror hurrah before he slid into junk like Dr. Terror's Gallery of Horrors. Lon plays Morgan Whitlock, the elder paterfamilias of a family descended from a witch named Vanessa. When a construction project buys out the land Chaney's family has been buried in for centuries, Lon gets plenty upset and refuses to have the remains moved. The more unscrupulous business partner desecrates the graves, and wouldn't you just know it? A mysterious woman suddenly pops up at the Whitlock house, and shortly after people start dying in bizarre accidents. This is old school horror, with no gore, but some good chills. Lon is in fine form, though he attempts no British accent and so stands out a bit among the British cast, all of whom are solid if not familiar (the male lead (Jack Hedley) was in For Your Eyes Only 17 years later). Still in all, it's good to see one of the old horror greats in something with some production value, and it's too bad Lon couldn't have gone out on a note like this 9 years later instead of Dracula vs Frankenstein. Check this one out!",1239580800,3,1179,4.645933014354067
2876077,3,B000RXVNCY,"OK, let's be honest. You don't expect low-budget horror movies to be all that good, and they're not. We've all seen the Hammer studios films from the 50's and 60's. No surprises here. Still, there are times when it's fun to just curl up in front of the television with some microwave popcorn and enjoy a late night horror show. These are fairly good examples of the genre. Want a really scary movie? Watch ""The Changeling"" with George C. Scott. I felt I got my money's worth on these though.",1225670400,3,491,4.466666666666667

2876079,3,B000RXVNCY,"Much better than often reported, this beautifully photographed British horror is a well upholstered turn down the familiar vampire path, enlivened by some delicious tongue in cheek. Directed by cult director Lance Comfort, (see Brian MacFarlane's monograph on his career) the film opens with a dazzling dance sequence set amidst a mid forest gypsy encampment, interrupted by the first burst of horror--accompanied by a swooping bat and a gust of wind.

These forest sequences are visually arresting, and include an eerie torch light parade photographed in reflection from a lake's surface.

As for the story, it concerns a modern day male vampire, (equipped with Louis Jourdan accent and beautifully cut suits) who turns out to be reincarnated from the ancient past.

Despite some dull detective sequences, (of the type that slow down Bava's ""Blood and Black Lace"") the picture manages an effective array of diverse settings including forest sequences, a country manor house, a catacomb lair, a jammed to the rafters antique shoppe, an artists' atelier, the reading room of the British Museum and a groovy bachelorette pad that is host to one of the screen's all time campiest cocktail parties.

Indeed, this sequence, replete with the Watusi, and Frug, and featuring an array of cigarette puffing (with holders!) extras that seem to have been recruited between takes from the sets of ""Darling"" and ""A Taste of Honey"", (one keeps looking for Julie Christie to appear) is guaranteed to elicit howls. And if that doesn't catch you, please note that Diana Decker's wardrobe had the female audience cooing at a recent screening.

Moreover, the climax, featuring a cave in which destroys the vampire clan, is well staged and shot.

Picture seems influenced by Don Sharp's superb ""Kiss of the Vampire,"" and while it doesn't hold a candle to that stellar feather in Hammer's cap, it does emerge as an interesting and zesty contemporary take on the same theme.",1218412800,7,1952,5.122641509433962
2876080,5,B000RXVNCY,"This is one of my favorite Midnite Movie double features so far! DEVILS OF DARKNESS has Hubert Noel as the evil, undead Sinistr; the leader of a satanic cult of ne'er-do-wells. Sinistr has returned from his long dirt-nap in order to take a bride from among the living. DOD is packed full of interesting / strange characters and plenty of fun hocus pocus. WITCHCRAFT has Lon Chaney jr. as Morgan Whitlock, head of a family w/ long ties to witchcraft and devil-worship. He's upset that the Lanier family, the descendants of the very people who (centuries earlier) killed many Whitlocks as witches, is now destroying their ancestral graveyard! This one really gets going when Vanessa Whitlock (Yvette Rees) rises from her cold earth in order to exact vengeance. She is the perfect ghoul (in a Barbara Steele/Vampira way). Both of these movies are re-watchable and make for a great Saturday afternoon creepfest...",1196553600,21,909,4.9868421052631575
2876081,5,B000RXVNCY,"I adore these multi-discs. It's a grand opportunity to catch up on old 'friends' without breaking the bank. Witchcraft is a particular favourite of ours - nicely constructed and with a suitably fiery ending.

2876082,3,B000RXVNCY,"I gotta be honest, I don't remember that much about these, and I only saw them a week ago. I suppose that says something. As I recall, they both has a nice Cold War paranoia about them, and were pretty typical for horror films of the period. Themes of emerging sexuality, xenophobia, and challenges to the Capitalist authoritarian patriarchy may be read between the lines (I guess here between the frames). Good films to do your taxes by.",1193788800,,438,4.628205128205129
2876083,4,B000RXVNCY,"For those who enjoy British and Italian b&w horror films from the 60's like City of the Dead/Horror Hotel, The Mask of Satan/Black Sunday, Night of the Eagle/Burn Witch Burn, Danse Macabre/Castle of Blood, etc, you just might like Witchcraft as well. And especially if you like creepy, haunting witches, like Elizabeth Selwyn in Horror Hotel and Asa the vampire witch in Black Sunday, I think you will find Vanessa Whitlock, the resurrected witch in Witchcraft, to be in some ways the most chilling of all. Yvette Rees plays Vanessa, and she plays the character as much less animated than Elizabeth or Asa. In fact, she doesn't say a word in the whole film, but Rees' understated performance works, conveying a cold, icy feeling. I agree with other reviewers that the cinematography is good, with well lit scenes; the script and acting for the most part are good; and there are nice, eerie touches, like when Vanessa Whitlock breathes onto the voodoo doll of her next victim. Are there flaws in the film? Yes, as in other b-movies of this era, but I agree with Phil Hardy in the Encyclopedia of Horror when he describes Witchcraft as ""quietly effective"" and ""better than average.""",1193443200,7,1180,4.817733990147783
8202921,4,B000RXVNCY,"Devils of Darkness - I guess I shouldn't be taken aback by all the references to ""Hammer"" I've seen on various sites,or how this film is reminiscent of their style. I guess any horror from Britain made during this period might conjure those thoughts, as I was having them myself. The style, the atmosphere, the hot women running around throughout the proceedings.

Of course, I've heard ""Roger Corman"" too, but I haven't seen much of his work. At any rate, this is good stuff. Not quite Hammer ""Dracula,"" but pleasing to the eyes and the finale is noteworthy. Good B-Movie fun...

Witchcraft - This might be forgotten, too--as far as I know, it's not available on a standalone DVD. I found it paired with a double feature disc, so who knows? At any rate, this could be one of Lon's last few standout features or roles. His career hadn't totally sunk into the abyss yet, but he was still solid, whatever else was going on in his life during this point.

As for ""Witchcraft"" itself, a good B-movie if you don't have high hopes--and that angle may make the movie more enjoyable. Not sure if I should go into too much detail--aside from the obvious--witches, satanic rituals, some nice co-stars (oh, Amy), and a nice, fiery climax where Lon and his niece in the movie get destroyed.

Didn't see that coming, but I suppose she was supposed to be evil, too. Of course, having seen so many horrors, you don't always get out alive if you're supposed to be good in heart. Good, popcorn and horror entertainment...",1515456000,,1504,4.621722846441948
