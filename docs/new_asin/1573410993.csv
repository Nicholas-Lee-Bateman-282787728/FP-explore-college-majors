This program examines the crushing weight of evidence supporting the fact that Secular Humanism is the dominant worldview taught in public schools today.
 Many school administrator want to claim they are value neutral, they are not.
Often schools are promoting an agenda in our public schools that is associated with
secular humanism.  In order to clearly see that the many public schools are promoting secular humanism you must clearly understand and identify it's tenants.
It is well worth your time to know these popular ideas which have become pervasive in our society and now unfortunately define who many of us are.  Secular Humanism
is inconflict to a true Christian world view.  Secular Humanist believe the truth is
inside of you revealed by the consequences of your own actions no divine being
is helpful in revealing truth to you. Humanist view is that God is irrelievant because
inside man is that answers to all questions.  Christianity points to a divine being
showing you moral standards, a created universe and love given by God not a
mortal gift that is temporary. One might view Secular humainsm like a one night stand and Christian world view like a everlasting marriage between God and man. I vote this video as
a must see.  40 minutes.",1011744000,11,1389,5.043668122270742
