8058798,5,B0009AFMRW,"Okay you hop heads, dope fiends, and reefer addicts! STAY AWAY from the demon weed and happy dust or you too will turn into hit-and-run driving, jitter bugging, sex-crazed loosey-goosies who bring SHAME and DISGRACE to yourselves and your parents! You might even commit SUICIDE as a result! So aw heck, be a SWELL JOE and stay away from the WRONG CROWD as displayed in these flix.

On one end, these films are a real hoot! All facetiousness aside, these films ARE well intentioned in trying to keep the kiddies away from the dope dens and admittedly, that is a noble cause. But as the case with the late 1960s episodes of ""Dragnet"" (remember Blue Boy?) and the afterschool specials of the 70s and 80s, the execution, dialogue, and stories are so outragously ridiculous that only the least sophisticated or grandmothers at the hell fire and brimstone churches who haven't gone ten miles further than the family farm since the fifties could POSSIBLY take these films seriously. Children will be bored by them and gen x-ers on up will pound the floors in hysterical laughter.",1116633600,4,1072,4.794594594594595
