3823974,3,B001W6QA82,"I was so excited to get this movie because I loved this book series so I thought it would be great.  Especially when I saw that they had Maggie Grace and Stephen Amell, I was really excited because I really like both of them.  After getting the movie and watching it I was disappointed that they really didn't tell the story of the book When Calls the Heart.  That would've made a great movie with 2 great actors like Maggie and Stephen.  Instead they made up other characters and focused on a whole different story (with actors and actresses who are not known and honestly not very good!).  It really doesn't make sense to me at all-the only part that's any good in the movie are the parts with Stephen and Maggie and there are not enough of them at all!  I found myself wanting to fast forward through the parts with the made up story characters but it turned out to be most of the movie.  Too bad they didn't tell the story from the book with these 2 actors because it would've been great!!  Just don't expect the movie to focus on or be like the book at all other than brief moments.  Too bad!",1381881600,6,1097,4.260869565217392
3823975,3,B001W6QA82,"If you're a Stephen Amell (""Arrow"") fan, you need to go into this film with realistic expectations. A review copy came into our office and i checked it out and was disappointed to find his plot is more a subplot. In brief, the film is set at the turn of the century, when a well-to-do young Canadian woman is debating whether or not to go to the untamed west for a teaching job. She eventually finds an old diary that reveals her Aunt (Maggie Grace) was also a teacher who went out west decades earlier and fell in love with a Mountie. It's this flashback story that involves Amell's character. It is the best part of the movie, and I wanted more of it. Amell is fun, as usual, and approaches his character with a dry backwoods charm. Maggie Grace is also great in her role of an independent minded woman who resists being swept off her feet by any man.",1378857600,5,853,4.304347826086956
