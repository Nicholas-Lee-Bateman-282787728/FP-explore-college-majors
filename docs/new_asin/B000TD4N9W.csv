2896366,5,B000TD4N9W,"... with infinite patience. At this point, I don't ask for any extras, no fancy booklets, nothing! Just press the discs and sell them with the cheapest packaging you can imagine... I (and apparently several others) will buy it right away. The series had a loyal following, so much so that it kept the show going for seven seasons. Well, we are still here! If not for anything else, a quick IMDB glance points to the striking fact that this show earned 63 awards nominations and 36 wins, including multiple American Comedy Awards, Directors Guild and Screen Actors Guild awards, several Emmy's, Golden Globes, and the list goes on. So, for the sake of ART, itself, please release it. In case inescapable reasons prevent that, I would hope Sony could simply offer an explanation to the fans. Take it as a matter of politeness towards your customers (yes, we are the folks at home watching your shows and helping you make money). It is fine, we can take a solid justification, we are not exactly Cavemen (pun intended). That way, at least, we will not feel like fools waiting for nothingness. And for the record, season four ranks very high in my list of favorites, not just for its formidable ending, but also for the intelligent and subtle way the seeds for that ending were planted throughout the entire season, offering much more context and meaning to the final episodes (evidently, this is in no way captured by the collection dvd set). What else can I say? I encourage more people to use this public space and signal their interest in this excellent show. Thank you for reading.",1200960000,61,1582,4.694244604316546

I don't want somebody's idea of the best, I want the next season...and the next....  I tried a couple of times to write Sony, using the address on the DVD box.  My letters were returned with a note that I needed the department number.  Well, duh!!!  How would I know that?  The next time I added something like ""TV DVDs"" on the envelope, same response.

I felt the season took a major downward turn once season 4 began (& onward), so I watched very little of it when it aired on TV & instead chose to hold the first three seasons warm in my memory. It was only in recent years that I felt I wanted closure on how they wrapped-up the series, so I watched all the remaining seasons.

2896402,3,B000TD4N9W,"Season 4 is a downer. No way to get around it. There are funny times and increasingly HILARIOUS times, but the tone of the season -- especially at the crescendo -- gets to be depressing. Whereas the first three seasons tend to be small laughs mixed with the wink-and-nod towards married life, season 4 seems intent on addressing that married couples have rough patches. From the dramatic side of things? Bravo! From the situation COMEDY side of things... ouch.

Still, if you love the Buchmans, and you understand that marriage isn't just a flowery path of joy, don't hesitate to purchase this season.",1382572800,2,601,4.834951456310679

Cant say too much more than what great stories and characters were told and built in this series. And funny ! Helen Hunt has always been a favorite actress of mine.

2896409,4,B000TD4N9W,"The fourth season of ""Mad About You"" was arguably its last hurrah before slipping into mediocrity. When the Buchmans returned for their fifth year headed for babyhood, MAY felt like a different show that struggled to capture the charm of earlier seasons. So after a long wait, it's nice to see the fourth year finally available on DVD to complete the release of the ""essential"" MAY seasons.

Largely focused on Paul and Jamie's efforts to get pregnant while juggling hectic work schedules, the show remains at its funniest when it's just Paul Reiser and Helen Hunt sparring back and forth, which there's plenty of. Epsiodes like ""Ovulation Day"" and ""The Glue People"" kept the show in the realm of ""must-see TV,"" even as other NBC shows like ""Seinfeld"" and ""Friends"" were stealing more and more of the spotlight.

If you've bought previous seasons, there won't be much surprise in the fact that this is a pretty barebones 4-disc set. There are no audio commentaries, just two brief episode introductions recycled from the earlier ""best-of"" DVD collection, as well as some old NBC promos and a featurette on the theme song. But ultimately, the no-frills presentation is OK -- it's just nice to have the show's last solid season available on DVD.",1284854400,2,1243,4.886255924170616
2896410,5,B000TD4N9W,"At last, Season Four is released. This season was a turning point in the show and the laughter slowly gives way to the seriousness of relationship troubles as this season draws to a close.

Much could be said about the last three episodes of the fourth season. Suffice it to say, these three shows, a trilogy story arc within the greater arc of the series, really bring home the reality of marriage - the side you never see in most series, let alone a sit-com. But, as we all know, this was more than just another sit-com. As M*A*S*H became more than a series of setups, prat falls and yuks featuring doctors at war, MAY demonstrates the depth and range of the actors, giving them dialogue that was about as close to ""real"" as you can get during the park bench scene. Chilling stuff.

And with Season Five slated for a late 2010 release, it appears the powers that be are beginning to hear our cries for getting on with finishing the release of the remaining seasons. Let's hope seasons six and seven won't be another two to three years in the offing.",1282003200,,1051,4.4404145077720205
2896411,5,B000TD4N9W,"OK. It was shipped so fast (and I live in Peru).
First surprise: 2 plastic cases. 2 discs in each case. So my new Mad About You discs are safe
Second surprise: Introduction by Paul Reiser and Helen Hunt on ""Yoko Said"", ""The Finale (part 1)"", ""The Finale (part 2)"" and ""The Finale (part 3)""
Third surprise: ""Mad About the Theme"" (04:09) and ""TV Spots"" (06:16) on disc 4.
OK, I think all of these bonus features were on the ""Mad About You Collection"" but i didn't buy it (I refuse to do that) so now I hope every single extra is on the next DVD sets.
One little downside: no subtitles. I already accepted there is no other audio track (there was a spanish track in the first DVD sets) but they must add english subtitle (spanish subtitle would be better).
I am waiting for next seasons! They already announced season 5 on DVD.",1282003200,,824,4.32258064516129
2896412,4,B000TD4N9W,"The long-awaited release of this season brings us Paul and Jamie's attempt to expand their family. Of course, as is typical for the Buchmans, any project comes with some element of disaster and hilarity, and this is no exception.

Particularly memorable episodes include ""Yoko Said,"" where Paul has the chance to work on a documentary with Yoko Ono (Ono guest stars); ""An Angel for Murray,"" where dogwalker Nat (Hank Azaria) is first introduced; and ""New Year's Eve,"" where Paul and Jamie deal with being apart for the holiday for the first time since they became a couple.

2896413,5,B000TD4N9W,"Took a while but finally, season 4 is released.  The 3 ""Must See TV"" shows for me back in the mid 90's were Mad About You, Friends and Seinfeld.  Although the least popular of the trio, I felt a strong affinity toward Mad About You mostly due to the fact what red blooded male didn't want Helen Hunt as his wife back then?  Although the entire collection of Seinfeld and Friends were quickly released, Mad About You lagged behind, presumably due to poor sales.  Season 3 lagged behind Season 2 and Season 4 lagged behind Season 3.  But it was with great relief that I found out that Season 4 was being released thus I can finally throw out my worn out original VHS copies.

To me, season 2 through 4 were the best which is why I was anxious to get it.  Season 5 was good but once the baby was born, lost a little bit of luster for me.  Both Paul and Jamie are neurotic in their own complementry way.  Paul's wishy washy quality countered by Jamie's quick, sharp wit made for some fine comedy.  Although one of the charms of this series was that the two were not perfect (although perfect for one another), in this season, as doubts about their relationship and future appear, the you-know-what really hits the fan.",1279584000,2,1214,4.379464285714286

2896415,4,B000TD4N9W,"I'm very pleased that a distributor has decided to release the remaining seasons of this classic show. Season 4 was perhaps the best season and had some great episodes. My only complaint, and the reason for only giving it four stars, is the image quality. It's still better than the first three seasons, but it could be better.",1278460800,2,327,4.655172413793103
2896416,4,B000TD4N9W,"Always loved this show, one of the few back then that I used to actually make sure to watch when it was on.
But for me, the first through third seasons were the best, because in this season, they started getting way too contrived, with the baby and marriage problems, that it just lost some of the appeal, started feeling more like just another sitcom.

Up until this season, it was a smooth flowing, fun ride, and while i wouldn't have minded a more serious bent to the last part of the fourth season, it was how they went about it that just rang so hollow.  Out of the blue, suddenly the marriage is in danger, and the setup for the various things was just so planned, it took away the enjoyment.  The show where they were trying to talk, and suddenly everyone was showing up at their door, for instance...  They live up in the building, only way to get there is to go on the stairs or elevator, and there is no way the elevator could go up and down and bring up new people within 10 seconds, yet in one episode, their doorbell rings over and over, as if they all came up separately, but there is no possible way for that to have happened.  And the whole last end of the season has that feel, things just thrown at the wall in hopes something would stick.

The beginning of the season is still good though, hence the reason I still gave it four stars.  And even the bad shows still have moments of hilarity, but this was the beginning of the end, and it unfortunately mars the series.

Other than that, though, still glad this finally came out on DVD, as I have had seasons 1 through 3 forever it seems, and had wondered if it was ever going to come out.  Worth getting, especially for the price here at Amazon.

But the happy ride that was enjoyed for the first three seasons begins the downward slide towards the end...",1278115200,2,1823,4.273255813953488
2896417,4,B000TD4N9W,"The first season was released on 2 discs, 11 episodes/disc, and looked as bad as that sounds - anyone with a DVD burner could make copies at least that good. The next two seasons had 8 episodes/disc, and didn't look much better, blurry and with numerous artifacts. Season four has 6 episodes/disc and looks noticeably better, but still not good. Like Dharma and Greg, this show is just not getting a fair shot on DVD. Consider a program like HBO's Rome, which puts 3 widescreen 50 min episodes on a disc, and the quality is outstanding, not BLU-ray, but close enough that I'll never bother replacing the DVDs. Mad About You puts 6 fullscreen 21 min episodes on a disc, and it looks obviously digitized (at least, on a big screen; it's probably decent on a TV). I suppose they have sandwiched this into a DVD-5 to save money, but it is a shame that such an outstanding show should have this kind of legacy. I'm hoping that Mad, Dharma, Wings,  and the other classic shows that have had inadequate DVD releases will one day have a BLU-ray release that does them justice.

2896426,5,B000TD4N9W,"Mad About You is a smart, honest, touching, funny series about the complexities and profundities of marriage.  The characters Paul and Jamie have a chemistry and depth that is incredibly rare for a half-hour sitcom.  The show simply got better with each season, and was able to weave into its comedy some real human drama that anyone who's ever been in a committed relationship could relate to.  Besides the two title characters, there was a supporting cast of characters who were written and acted so well they could easily have had their own show.  It's hard to label 'Mad About You' a sitcom, because it was so much more than that.

I own all the dvds currently available, and among my favorite moments with my girlfriend is cuddling on the couch, watching episodes of MAY.  There simply hasn't been another TV show that can compare.  It would bring us a tremendous amount of joy if we could complete our collection, and be able to spend several more evenings on the couch watching the series to the end.  Please, Sony, I know at least one of you has either been married or been in a relationship - if you have any humanity at all, please release the remaining four seasons.  You will make a very large and loyal fanbase very happy, not to mention you'll make some money as well.  Everybody wins!",1259280000,3,1299,4.584415584415584
2896427,1,B000TD4N9W,What I don't think the powers that be realized is when the show ended with Paul and Jamie divorced...that killed the show and any want to watch it over and over.

They should have protected the show instead of being edgy and ruining it.,1255651200,3,468,4.329545454545454

For that reason the first 2 or 3 might not have sold well, but I'm covinced the later series sell better and better. I'm hoping they will bring out all series. I would certainly buy and enjoy them very much.",1251072000,6,329,4.15625

So we've been waiting a long time.  Sorry, a VERY long time.  And what is Sony waiting for?  I think they should just release all the seasons at once. I used to think molasses moving uphill in winter was slow. But I think Sony now holds the all time slow record. And yet, we still wait.",1232236800,6,358,4.014084507042254

No, we will not be mollified by ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" or ""BallykissAngel.""  We actually have brains and like TV that is genuinely humorous and credits us with being able to appreciate subtlety.  Not even the reviewers employed and paid by Amazon.com can claim that much...or even spell ""mollify"" or ""subtlety.""  Let's face it, aside from exceptions like ""The West Wing"" and ""Mad About You,"" television is vapid...and assumes we viewers are as well.  What can we do, while we (not so) patiently await the long overdue release of the other seasons of ""Mad About You"" onto DVD?  Well, after you add your voice to the swell of protest with a review of your own, help the TV execs and advertisers lose some money by NOT watching ""Dancing with the Stars"" or ""American Idol.""

2896435,5,B000TD4N9W,"After so many years of waiting for the complete set of Mad About You I hope that Sony just sells the rights to a company who will give this Emmy award winning show the respect it deserves!  Chuck the first 4 releases, including the best of, and start from scratch.  Obviously Sony doesn't want the hassle!

My theory is that they released the first season too early, when DVDs were new and TV series were just beginning to be released.  Sony was put off by the low sales but didn't stop to consider that it might not be the show but perhaps their own lack of marketing strategy and quality of the initial release.  If Mad About You had started being released in 2004 or 2005, with a good quality package, I believe the sales would have been much higher.  Too much time goes by between releases and people forget about it.  The real issue here is Sony.

I am just beyond frustrated because this is my husband and I's favorite show of all time and yet the only one that isn't available amidst all the JUNK!  Sony, get your act together or sell the rights to someone who is willing to do this series justice!",1225411200,12,1105,4.325242718446602
2896436,5,B000TD4N9W,"Fascinating that so many comments on here reflect my own.  I didn't think there were fans as big as myself for this show.

I just love this show!  It's just one of those sweet, comforting shows, that's REALLY funny.  Not like so much of the stuff out today.

It's just so interesting that we have 3 measly seasons so far (all of which are great) and some unnecessary collectors thing, while other shows have either more, or ALL of their seasons out.  I mean, there are shows with more out after 3 seasons of being on the air (that have only BEEN ON the air for 3 seasons (meaning that they are releasing the videos after each season, to put it plainly, (kinda like the Sara Conner Files or Chronicles, or whatever that dumb show is called))), than we have for what, 7 or so seasons of a show that ended about a decade ago??  So it's not resources.  They have enough to produce these.  It's not lack of interest or fan-base.  So what the heck's the deal?

Bring on the rest of the seasons already!! :)",1218931200,4,1000,4.294117647058823
