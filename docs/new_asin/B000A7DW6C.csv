8075789,3,B000A7DW6C,"In this Mexican film from the mid Forties you get to watch an elegant Mara Antonieta Pons sing the title song twice. This is perhaps this film's only virtue. The rest is pretty creaky.

This is the story of a well-heeled family in Mexico (played by Anita Blach & Manuel Arvide) who, upon a friend's death in Havana, decides to raise the teenageg daughter(Pons). The young adoptee develops a crush on the husband. Not wanting to be a burden, she decides to get a job. The husband then employs her in his office. This brings them closer together, so Pons confesses her love and goes off on her own. The husband's business partner (played by Emilio Brillas), a  bachelor who has always been in love with the partner's ""noble"" wife, tracks down Pons at a classy nightclub where she is employed as a singer. Arvide then installs Pons in their own love nest where she gets pregnant. No spoilers here, except to say there is a semi tragic ending where all is resolved.

These tear-jerkers were usually aimed at a primarily female audience, but from today's point of view, they are obviously nothing more than the fantasies of middle aged men who come up with these kinds of loopy plots. Gorgeous young women like Pons don't fall ""in love,"" with old geezers like Arvide unless they're loaded. And here is the film's biggest hurdle: Arvide is completely uncharismatic, he throws off no sparks, so there is no chemistry between him and Pons. Heck, there's no chemistry between him and his wife! The Actress playing the wife is stuck with what today's actresses would consider a thankless, hard-to-play role: the wife who puts up with it all. In a film that goes from the sublime to the ludicrous, she provides the film's sublime moments: a walk in a park after she ""finds out"" the truth about Pons and Arvides, and her final close-up, as she gazes upwards and the soundtrack music swells. Not even Lana in her hayday of Ross Hunter opuses comes close.

As far as the major attraction, the ""simptica"" Mara Antonieta Pons acquits herself quite well in a role better suited to Marga Lpez or any other queen of the weepies. Pons did much better later, in her saucy comedies. Here she doesn't even do what she did best: shake her booty! Not even one dance number. The guess would be that the filmmaskers were trying to keep what is at best a squalid potboiler from looking like one. Oh, she gets to dance a waltz (!) with the stiff Arvides. Yes, it's that kind of flik: people are formally dressed, even when relaxing at home!

The print is so-so and there are no extras. Only for die hard Pons fans who want to have all her movies, or if you want to see her perform the classic pop hit, ""Toda Una Vida.""",1310428800,2,2689,4.536082474226804
