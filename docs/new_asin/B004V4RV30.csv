8442932,5,B004V4RV30,I enjoyed Sensei Lovrets Insight in his own words.,1449792000,,50,4.666666666666667
8442933,1,B004V4RV30,This is a very poorly made video. I do not recommend it.,1419206400,2,56,3.75
8442934,5,B004V4RV30,"Lovret Sensei masterfully explains and demonstrates the differences between the ""do"" and the ""waza"" of Akido and Akijutsu by comparing and contrasting displaying highly skilled (mostly) empty hand technique. Lau Sensei displays brilliant kenjutsu skills and knowledge. This is a relatively short video which I have already watched several times.",1413849600,,345,5.92
8442935,3,B004V4RV30,"Let me preface this review by saying this is my first review and I'm a beginner at the subject of Aikido. That said, this product is okay for the price, but essentially your paying for demonstrations with little to no elucidation. I would hope that my poor grasp of the concepts presented is due to the esoteric nature of the content; however, seeing that the emphasis is on presenting these secret aspects of Aikido Lovret Sensei stops short. It is my hope that within a few years or more I can review this again with more optimism and better criticism. Certainly not a foundational or introductory dvd.",1304640000,5,604,4.654205607476635
