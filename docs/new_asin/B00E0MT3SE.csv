5882917,5,B00E0MT3SE,"Amazing, disturbing, honest and brutal portrayal of Indonesian death squads dealing with their actions years later. I saw it SXSW with the director, and he told us it was ok to laugh at times, which helps brake the tension and brutality.",1384819200,2,237,4.804878048780488
5882918,5,B00E0MT3SE,"In 1965 the Indonesian military responded to an attempted coup with the massacre of at least 500,000 people. They employed local gangs to help carry out these murders, transforming young idling street toughs into death squads who killed without abandon or regard to the political pretense of eradicating the alleged communist threat.

Anwar Congo is one of these killers, a flamboyant man with a penchant for the gangster movies he once stood outside scalping tickets to. Anwar has never been charged for his crimes. To the contrary, his atrocities have made him somewhat of a minor celebrity in his hometown of Medan, a large city in Sumatra. He believes he is responsible for murdering about a thousand people; mostly by strangling them with piano wire, the way gangsters did it in the movies.

 Joshua Oppenheimer met Mr. Congo traveling through Indonesia while working on another project. He was struck by Congo's zeal in recounting his horrific acts like an aged athlete recalling his bygone glory days, acting out his crimes and providing little asides on the most efficient methods of killing a large number of people quickly and cleanly.

Oppenheimer proposed filming and financing re-enactments of Congo's crimes starring the murderer himself, his surviving accomplices, and his young lackeys.  As inexplicable as Oppenheimer's proposition to help a mass murderer make a film is, Congo's decision to recreate his transgressions through an array of genres - horror, musical, war, westerns and, of course, gangster - is even more baffling. Oppenheimer's documentary, The Act of Killing, is the collision of Congo's bizarre scenes realized, chilling interviews, and fly on the wall observation.

The fact Congo maintained final cut gives the documentary its occasional perverse comedy. Laughing at these men's lack of sophistication is double-edged; it's this same absence of self-awareness that made them capable of killing thousands of people and recall their actions with little of no sense of remorse. So when one young lackey engages in a quixotic run for public office, explaining how much easier it will make shaking people down for bribes, it feels almost as absurd as something off of NBC's Parks & Recreations, while providing a prime example of what makes Indonesia so hopelessly corrupt.

This sort of ironic detachment takes an even darker turn when a man recalls the murder of his father during the '65 genocide. The man suggests the story would make a good addition to the film. One would think Anwar would recognize this thinly veiled confrontation by a victim, or perhaps feel some tug of guilt for his participation in events that led to the death of this man's father. But Congo is unable to see past his film, and dismisses the idea, characteristically, without thought.

And yet, The Act of Killing does catch glimpses of some semblance of remorse in Anwar Congo. On several occasions, local citizens are solicited to act the part of Communist dissidents. Most decline, visibly terrified of being mistaken for Communists. Yet a few do concede (likely for what is to them a great deal of money), and as they are mock beaten and murdered their children fall into hysterics, not understanding what is going on. One woman appears to slip into shock from the experience.

It's at moments like these that something like regret appears in Congo's face. There are also admissions of terrible nightmares that have plagued him for years, quieter conversations with accomplices about coping with memories, and a final fifteen minutes which are almost unbearable to watch.

But while watching all of this, I couldn't help wonder if Oppenheimer had discovered and crossed some line of ethics with his film. Yes, we sit in judgment of Congo, but he himself is blissfully unaware of this. All he sees is the medium provided to glorify his actions. Even since The Act of Killing was released, Congo's complaints are detached from the crimes, instead focusing on his feeling of being misled in terms of the type of film he was making.

But most troubling, is it ethically sound to make a movie that causes participants trauma or puts lives in danger? My knee jerk reaction is to say such a film should not be produced. But this feeling is countered by the powerful visceral reaction viewing this film stirred in me.

The Act of Killing, is many things: sober documentary, meta-film within a film; exploitative, surrealist, funny and always deeply uncomfortable. I can safely say I have never seen a movie like it, and that my thoughts returned to its characters and images in a way only a few documentary films have. It is a unique and troubling masterpiece.",1378339200,83,4668,5.016795865633075
5882919,4,B00E0MT3SE,"""The Act of Killing"" (2013 release; 115 min.) is a documentary from writer-director Joshua Oppenheimer who sets out to interview/expose several of the ""evil-doers"" behind the mass killings that took place in Indonesia in 1965-66. As the documentary opens, we get to know Anwar Congo, one of those directly involved in the killings. Anwar and several of his croonies have decided, apparently with some coaxing and suggesting from Oppenheimer, to make a movie about the events from 65-66, so as to preserve hisotry and making sure everyone knows what really happened, including how exactly these killings were executed.

Several comments: first and foremost, in what kind of a world do we live that these mass-murderers boast about what they did in the mid-60s without any fear of apprehension, let alone any regret over what they did? To the contrary, we see Anwar Congo and his croonies making the rounds of various media, including a national TV show, where the host merrily goes along. Likewise with Indonesia's politicians at the highest levels. Here is a Indonesian Vice-President addressing the Pancasila paramilitary oraganzation that did much of the killings in the mid-60s, there is the Minister of Information showing support for the making of the film, and on and on. It simple blows the mind. Second, it must be that these killers truly have no inkling why Oppenheimer is making this documentary, as they are on seemingly very friendly terms and a first-name basis with Oppenheimer throughout the movie. Third, the re-enactments make for difficult movie-watching at times, in particular the further we get into the movie. This is most definitely not for the faint of heart, so viewer beware.

I saw this movie just this past weekend at the Downtown Independent in Los Angeles, and the particular matinee showing I was at was very well attended, somewhat of a surprise to me, given the subject matter of this movie. The showing actually started with ""A special announcement from director Joshua Oppenheimer"", in which Oppenheimer introduces the movie and concludes ""I won't say 'enjoy the film' as it's not necessarily that kind of a movie, but I would hope that you have a powerful movie experience"", and that it certainly is, and then some! This movie is one of the more unusual documentaries I have seen in a long time. Assuming you can handle the at times schocking and always revolting characters we get to know in the movie, this is definitely a movie you want to (need to) see, be it at home or in the theatre, and I fully expect this documentary will be in the running for the Best Documentary Oscar early next year. ""The Act of Killing"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1377734400,46,2678,4.922566371681416
5882920,4,B00E0MT3SE,"""The Act of Killing"" is the strangest documentary I've seen, and I've seen some doozies. Joshua Oppenheimer approached members of Indonesia's death squads who perpetrated the mass murders of alleged communists in 1965-1966 about making a film about their experiences. He asked the men to recreate the scenes of the killings in whatever way they wished. Anwar Congo, who was a movie theater gangster a smalltime hood who scalped tickets- before being called upon by the Indonesian army to exterminate communists, and Herman Koto, who was running for parliament as this film was made, took Oppenheimer up on the offer. They seem eager to be involved in the project, as the mass killing of communists is still considered a patriotic act, especially by the powerful paramilitary organization Pancasila Youth, which enjoys strong support from the government.

Congo and Koto choose to recreate the killings in the style of their favorite American films: gangster movies, Westerns, and musicals. So we get scenes of torture and murder by men wearing suits and fedoras, the burning and mass murder of a village by orange-clad Pancasila Youth commanded by Congo dressed as a cowboy, and extravagant musical numbers in which Koto appears in drag. ""The Act of Killing"" shows the final product intermittently, but most of the film is spent on discussions about creating the scenes, and the men describe what they did for the filmmakers. But first, they must recruit actors. Koto's first attempt to recruit people to play communist wives and their children who were victims of the death squads doesn't go well, as people are reluctant to play a communist or maybe that was just their excuse.

Eventually, it comes together. Congo and Koto are joined by others who perpetrated the killings. One such person is Adi Zulkadry, who says that the death squads were more cruel than the communists and believes that the government should issue an official apology. He is the most thoughtful of the men but points out that there is nothing to be done about it now. Congo and Koto killed ""happily"", in their words, but Congo suffers from nightmares and disturbed sleep, which he attributes to his role in so many murders, an estimated one thousand. It is interesting that Congo, in particular, chooses to play a victim in one of the scenes, who is killed by Congo's favorite method: strangled with a wire. The atmosphere becomes heavy when a man whose stepfather was murdered by the death squads, who is playing one of the victims in a recreation, tells his story.

It's all very odd, but I'm not sure what conclusion we're supposed to draw. The death squads are still revered by many in Indonesia. Some of the men regret what they did; some don't. Some are disturbed by the recreations more than they were by the real thing. I would have liked more discussion of what these men felt like at the time of the killings. They were young punks in their twenties given carte blanche to do wreak havoc. They fashioned themselves after the images they admired in Western movies. They killed a lot of people, most of whom were probably not communists. I guess it felt like an opportunity to be important, powerful, and invincible a dream come true. But I would have liked to hear about what they felt and thought within their social groups at the time, which I suspect is what motivated them. Great idea from Joshua Oppenheimer though.

I found it profoundly unsettling, informative, and weird all at the same time. The re-creations and commentary are usually chilling, alleviated as tension builds by cuts to the families and friends of the killers shopping in modern malls, fishing, drinking, and participating in bizarre performance scenes (""eye candy,"" as one of the major characters notes). There are also scenes of extortion, mostly of Chinese merchants and businessmen, stories of gangster activity, and much else. To me, the film seemed like strong evidence for the banality of mass violence.

The limited perspective on this period provided by the interviewees must be balanced against the almost total lack of accounts on the subject in English. A fellow viewer thought it amazing that the film could actually have been made in Indonesia given the sensitivity of the topic even today.",1463270400,,1026,5.2560975609756095
5882931,2,B00E0MT3SE,"THE ACT OF KILLING takes as its reference-point the killings in Indonesia during the mid-Sixties, when thousands of alleged ""Communists"" were butchered by pro-government forces as well as groups of gangsters working on the government's behalf.

Nearly half a century later director Joshua Oppenheimer confronts some of those involved in that genocide, most of them now gray- haired old men, or middle aged men with paunches, and invites them to re-enact the killings in any way they choose, using intertexts drawn from Hollywood movies - westerns, melodramas, and the like - as well as their own first-hand memories.

The result is a documentary that means to shock; to dramatize the sheer horror of the events, compared to the complacent ways in which the executioners recall what happened. Although one of them, Anwar Congo, admits to having sleepless nights as a result, it's clear that he still enjoys the company of his fellow-gangsters and the male bonding rituals keeping them together.

As with many documentaries dealing with traumatic events, THE ACT OF KILLING seems too over-manipulative, almost as if Oppenheimer were deliberately playing with his subjects in the hope of making them ""confess"" to their sins. Things don't work like that - as other documentaries focusing on other genocides (for example, in Nazi Germany) have shown, the perpetrators often feel that what they did at the time was right, in the interests of their country's future, and find it difficult to alter their opinions. This is not to condone their actions, but nonetheless we have to try and understand why they did what they did. This is what THE ACT OF KILLING fails to address.",1462752000,,1668,5.08029197080292

A disturbing trip into the twisted minds and imaginations of several of the executioners who had a hand in the killing of as many as a million suspected communists, communist sympathizers, ethnic Chinese, and others during the Indonesian genocide of 1965-66. They were tools, cogs in a bigger, nationwide, indeed international (US-facilitated) operation. Yet they were also enthusiastic participants, devising their own efficient ways to murder, and for no other reason than profit and gain. They trot out no ideological justifications for their actions, parroting only feebly something about the alleged wickedness of the communists when acknowledging that what they did was far more wicked. Anwar and Adi are like many functionaries and quasi-official thugs, who succeeded though violence, intimidation, and corruption. The prestige they enjoy--and the continuing existence of Pemuda Pancisila--remind us that to the victors go not only the spoils, but history itself.

5882946,5,B00E0MT3SE,"I'd be hard-pressed to name any film I've watched that is as strange and disturbing as 'The Act of Killing' (brought to you by executive producers Werner Herzog and Errol Morris).

When Indonesian president Sukarno allied himself with communists in 1965, he was toppled by a military coup and a bloody, anti-communist purge followed. Ethnic Chinese, deemed disproportionately wealthy and corrupt by other Indonesians, were targeted as well  or at least this is how some pretended to justify the genocide of so many innocents. A million people were killed. The same paramilitary death squads that carried out the assassinations are politically strong today and count with government ministers among their members. They proclaim themselves national heroes and boast loudly about their ""achievements"". Director Joshua Oppenheimer interviews some of these gangsters and invites them to reenact the murder scenes by adapting them to their favorite movie genres (Westerns, musicals, etc.)

I initially wondered whether such a bizarre concept wasn't disrespectful to the victims of the massacre, but I realized that it was precisely this format that enabled the director to revisit history and unearth its truth. Oppenheimer had to stroke the gangsters' egos or he would have never been allowed to film. Some of them, including the main character, Anway, started their criminal careers by scalping tickets at a local cinema and were big fans of Hollywood films. In an article from The Australian newspaper, Oppenheimer explains the documentary's theatrical approach this way: ""Killing always involves some kind of distancing from what you are doing. Maybe that always means a kind of performance and acting, some kind of storytelling. Maybe it can just mean drinking first. But for Anwar, in part, it comes from the stories that he would imbibe in the cinema, the images and roles, the process of cinematic identification. The act of killing, for Anwar, was always some kind of act.""

The result is both chilling and surreal. It is shocking to see these men proudly celebrating their monstrous crimes, including rape. Have they no empathy? How ignorant, demented and evil can humans be? This reminds me of the BBC documentary mini-series 'The Nazis: A Warning Story', in which former Nazi members speak coldly about their ideology, indifferent to the suffering they have caused. These Indonesian gangsters, however, are still in power and are applauded on national TV, their insanity still shared decades later by a significant portion of the population.

There seems to be a disconnect between these people and their feelings, as if all the violence had somehow rendered them numb. This is most evident in Anwar. While a few of the thugs express some awareness of the harm they have done, Anwar is in a state of denial. He blocks his emotions and appears to bury any remorse for his acts under a fabricated storyline that absolves him. Yet, toxic memories stubbornly surface every night in the form of nightmares. As the film goes on, he slowly wakes up from the cloud of illusion that he has created around him and realizes the horror that he's participated in. This is one of the film's big successes.

It's frightening to picture this kind of cruelty emerge from a marginal, uneducated, third-world environment. But we have to ask ourselves how different we are from them. Don't we turn a blind eye on the killing of civilians carried out by drones in other countries, for example? Don't we also glorify national heroes who wiped out entire populations? As a Venezuelan, I think of the revered Independence leader Bolivar, who ordered the systematic murder of all Spanish civilians with his decree of 'War to the Death'. Every country has its stories. We seem to rationalize these inconvenient facts by telling ourselves that the war was merciless on both sides or that the end somehow justifies the means. Like gangster Adi suggests, history is written by the victors and war crimes are defined by the winners.

At two and a half hours long, the film could use a little more editing, in my opinion. I feel like it would be even more effective if it were stripped down further, removing any hints of sensationalism. I'm confused, for example, as to why Herman, the obese gangster, is dressed in drag during each reenactment. Did he find it comical? Was he aiming for the grotesque? Did he do it out of his own initiative or did the filmmakers encourage this? It gives the impression that someone was trying hard to make things look even weirder, which is completely unnecessary. Maybe there's a good explanation for this. And then again, everything in this film is so bizarre that it often resembles a work of pitch-black satire. Its terrifying strangeness, however, is no joke.",1445299200,,4775,5.036708860759494

5882949,5,B00E0MT3SE,"It starts off like a dark Coen Bros.spoof of mass murder and its perpetrators.  Anwar Congo - assumedly his real name - is a veteran death squad executioner from the 1965 Indonesian coup, suckered into making a film of his valiant exploits by Danish filmmaker Josh Oppenheimer; and co-produced by Werner Herzog, long noted for his deep probe into the darkside of his own Germany. Never before, I'll wager, has ""Anonymous"" been given so much credit in one film for all phases of production.

The unintended comedy is helped by an over-the-top transvestite, but the real darkness lies in the total self-righteousness of these veteran killers and their fascist, state-subsidized terrorist movement.  Long lauded as national heroes, they've cauterized whatever qualms of conscience ever stirred under their rhino hides: until Anwar Congo comes vis-a-vis with himself during the pseudo-film's production.  Pro-Western death dealers from Central America to Indochina have been brought before truth commissions and state prosecutors.  Yet here one actually role-plays a victim of his own terror and comes to feel a portion of the agony he inflicted upon others.  The final scenes show Anwar Congo dry-heaving his memories at his old killing ground.  It might not be full justice, but it's more of a reckoning than most of his kind will ever receive.

To this day the Indonesian mass murders are kept in the West's memory hole, still camouflaged by the lies of the CIA and MI6 as part of cold war ""necessity""; while the Western media yet choruses over the atrocities of the Khmer Rouge, Bosnian Serb militias, ISIS and other official enemies.  It is misleading to call this a double standard of human rights and democracy.

In Indonesia in 1964 & 65 occurred what can only be called a genocide of presumed communist communities, caused by death squads which were at least tacitly backed by the West. Nearly fifty years later a number of those who participated in massacres of unthinkable horror talk about what they did. Its truly unsettling what they describe, in the form of beatings, strangulations, be-headings, rape and other forms of sick barbarities. But whats arguably more disturbing is the casual way these abhorrent crimes are talked about, and the lack of repulsion or remorse by many about what occurred, partially due to the fact theres little risk anyone will be punished for it, ever. Millions in the country still celebrate the military style rule of the time, they serve in elected office, and have propaganda talk shows to congratulate themselves (though many Im sure also have little idea about this dark chapter in their countrys history).

The filmmakers here did something pretty brilliant, which probably produced more insight and history than any number of hours of interviews would have: they ask those who participated to reenact violent scenes of what happened during those purges. And these former thugs (they often proudly refer to themselves as gangsters) are only too happy to oblige, putting in surprising effort to accomplish the cinematics. The scenes they act out, with some Hollywood stylization, range from darkly comical in a few instances, to absolutely grotesque and very hard to watch. Seeing them act out scenes they presumably partook in is chilling, but its also where we see some humanity come out: in a few scenes the emotion of certain actors is overwhelming. As cold as these people might seem to the pain theyve caused, no one deals with the situation in exactly the same way. And it all comes to an ending scene which will be etched in my mind probably as long as Im alive. The Act of Killing, tough watch as it is, needs to be seen, both for its important history on an under-reported atrocity of the 20th century, and for what it says about us as a people when we lose our soul and convince ourselves the worst acts are justified.

I find it both interesting and a little pointless that theyve now released a directors cut version thats a half hour longer. I have to think that version must be either for film students, historians, or for masochists. I won't sugarcoat it, this is one of the most grueling, uncomfortable movie experiences Ive ever had in a long time. Im glad Ive had it, and Im of no two minds in calling this film a masterpiece, but enduring an extended version is not something I plan on partaking anytime soon.",1433894400,,2939,4.736328125

Anyone who would insist on calling this movie a documentary has missed the point.  This movie is a work of art.  This movie challenges your ability to process reality.  I'm sure the people who didn't like this movie are challenging my ability to process reality right now.  All I can say is check out the interviews with Werner Herzog and Errol Morris in the special features section of the blu-ray and get some opinions from real film makers instead of people who were looking for a history lesson and were disappointed they didn't get one.  I almost didn't watch the whole movie because I was afraid the images were going to go places I didn't want to go.  But now I am so glad I sat thru it because every time I think about the movie I appreciate it more.  How evil can we get?  How does doing evil distort our grasp on reality?  How desperate are we to put a positive spin on our behavior?  What did I just witness?

5882958,5,B00E0MT3SE,"First off if you know me I love a good documentary, the more reality that builds in the process of the film, the better the subject unfolds. The director Joshua Oppenheimer has a talent with capturing great quality of history and turning the story into a deep reality based process that the viewer can believe; that the story is real. The film makes you feel the characters, the surroundings and most all the history that is haunting and painful, because it's created so we'll.

From the ocean of the opening, from a comment by Voltaire: It is forbidden to kill. Therefore, all murderers are punished, unless they kill in large numbers, and to the sound of trumpets."" This documentary truly changed my life, truly gave me an experience of a visionary masterpiece; if I should say that, because of the subject matter. I had in all honesty felt the reality of this documentary. I had no knowledge of it until I looked at one of my fellow movie friends choices of films of the year and this was on it.

5882960,5,B00E0MT3SE,"Joshua Oppenheimer challenges the basic human tendency to be unable to comprehend mass genocide. Someone who commits an act of violence against another person has an immediate quality that most people can understand if not forgive. However, the horrors of mass genocide are incomprehensible for most sane people. How could people commit hundreds, sometimes thousands, of murders? How could entire communities be destroyed? And how could the people behind these death squads possibly bury the demons deep enough in their psyche that they could sleep at night? Using the inherent power of cinema and the fact that his subjects saw themselves as Hollywood icons, Oppenheimer pulls the darkness to the surface for a group of men who were a part of that incomprehensible evil and dares the viewer to turn away, or, even more challengingly, understand that there is still a drop of humanity in the most evil of monsters and that they have led lives that included joy even after stealing it from so many innocent people.

In 1965, there was a military coup in Indonesia. The resulting power vacuum and quest for vengeance led to the formation of murder squads. These newly-empowered men prowled the cities and countryside looking for people who were deemed ""Communists"" in a manner not dissimilar to the way that the Nazi SS planned a final solution for the Jewish people. Women and children were pulled from their homes, forced to watch their husbands and fathers killed, and then were often raped and murdered themselves. The horror of the genocide is almost unimaginable and yet the millions of people murdered have seen no justice. Genocide happened and the world kept on turning. Many of the members of the murder squads are still protected by a government that feels perpetually on the edge of undergoing another round of ethnic cleansing. The pages of history are very slowly turning to turn these former leaders into demons but it has been a slow, gradual process that has made the survivors afraid to even speak about what they underwent. In fact, Oppenheimer began his film as a piece about the people who made it through the genocide to bring more light to it but the government continues to instill so much fear in its own people that this angle became untenable. So, he turned to the murderers themselves.

""War crimes are defined by the winners."" So, how does Anwar Congo, one of the most defiant and proud mass murderers in history define his war crimes? There is certainly very little shame in his voice as he reenacts one of the times he garroted a man with a dance in his step. And yet there is something under the surface. It may not be sadness. It may not be regret. It may not be definable yet but Congo's demons are being pulled to the forefront by Oppenheimer's camera. While many documentarians would have met these men in their element and simply interviewed them, perhaps intercutting their stories with archival footage or expert interviews, Oppenheimer realized the propaganda that would have resulted in unchecked bragging about past sins. And so he makes his criminals revisit their crimes, asking them to reenact them for a filmmaking crew, often with a level of detail that includes makeup of burned flesh, costumes, and sets. These men are obsessed with Hollywood, revealing that many of their methods came from their love foe ""gangster films,"" and so Oppenheimer uses that love to reach deep into a part of their own history that they do not seem to full understand yet. In doing so, he makes their past crimes present. It is a way to address horror that somehow feels safe because  it puts the control of judgement in the consciences of the men who committed the crimes.

Oppenheimer interviews a number of people on both sides of the struggle but he places most of his emphasis on Anwar Congo, a mesmerizing man who may have killed over 1,000 people. At the start of the film, he casually throws out stories about his murderous days, talking about the decapitating wire he used and how he would practically dance across the street from the movie theater to kill the captured Communists across the street. Congo seems to have little regret, Forty-five minutes or so into the film, the tone shifts. Oppenheimer brings Congo's collaborators into the fold and they seem to have some more ghosts in their souls. Discussion brings nightmares to Congo's sleep. And then one of Congo's collaborators, in the middle of ""rehearsal,"" while pretending to be a Communist, tells the story of burying his own stepfather on the side of the road when he was 12. His bizarre, uncomfortable laughter sounds like it is turning to sobbing. And everyone, even Congo, begins to realize their own unimaginable depths of cruelty and pure evil.

Like so many documentarians, Oppenheimer's greatest skill is a cumulative one. He keeps adding more horror to the pile. Discussion leads to reenactments on a set to an amazing, on-location reenactment of a pogrom. And Oppenheimer frames it all in the way that one culture impacts another, making the evil of what happened in Indonesia feel universal. This is not an island away from the rest of humanity. One of Congo's associates uses Guantanamo to defend their own actions; George W. Bush thought that was right but feels it is wrong now. Another practices his speeches for a run for Parliament by mimicking facial expressions of an Obama speech. And almost all of the gentlemen reference Hollywood icons like gangsters and Scarface.

Al of these episodic beats and insights pile on to Congo, a man who goes through an on-screen ""therapy"" like no other. At one point, Oppenheimer stops recreating actual events and stages one of Congo's horrific nightmares. And the audience realizes that they are watching a man who could not really see his own horror until it was a pert of the cinematic fabric in which he draped himself when he committed his crimes. Few men have ever used a visual medium such a film to capture the fact that all the discussion in the world cannot always equal what can be conveyed through imagery. The brain has the ability to rewrite and repress inner monologue; alter memories to fit its own narrative. Oppenheimer tears down that ability when he forces Congo to face his own atrocity. It is an undeniably hard film to watch; as it should be. There have been countless, clinical, talking-head films about the unimaginable horrors of war but they have kept those awful events on the other side of the world or in the record books of history. Oppenheimer takes the kind of torturous pain that one can barely fathom and gives is present-day impact and importance. His film is more than a mere documentary; it is an essential record of history.",1423526400,2,6715,4.844947735191638
5882961,5,B00E0MT3SE,"Joshua Oppenheimer went to Indonesia to make a documentary about victims of the Indonesian genocide committed during the Suharto dictatorship.  They didn't like that very much.  Even today, relatives of the victims are intimidated against talking about it.  So, Oppenheimer talked to the people doing the intimidating - the militias, the government, and the surviving perpetrators of the genocide itself.

I had no idea about Indonesia.  In the present day, it's like the Nazis won, and the perpetrators of the Holocaust are local heroes for their actions.  There are multiple ""paramilitary organizations,"" just like the Brownshirts, except that the one that seems to be most powerful wears orange.  The Pangacila Youth are little more than gangsters, and indeed the idea that gangsters are the only free men permeates the organization.

The focus of the movie is on Anwar Congo, a man who is estimated to have killed over a thousand people himself during the genocide.  He is nothing more than a thug, a small-time gangster who saw the genocide as a way to move up.  We meet his former compatriots, including a newspaper publisher who viewed ""reporting"" as a way to identify Communists for being murdered.  Oppenheimer then asks Congo and his buddies to describe what they did during the genocide, and asks them to reenact what happened in any way they wish.  What they wish turns into a surreal horror B-movie,. where they have a good time hanging out and making a movie.  You want to reach through the screen and do anything to make these people suffer any consequences at all for their actions.

Much of the movie is difficult to watch, particularly when people who lost relatives during the genocide break down on camera.  It's also difficult to watch Congo and his co-perps gleefully discuss with impunity the sheer number of murders they have committed.  It's additionally difficult to watch sitting politicians in Indonesia, including the vice president of the country, come around and praise Congo for his actions.

Particularly for Americans, whose government supported Suharto wholeheartedly, it's important to understand what happens halfway around the globe when evil men propped up by our money and our advisors have free rein to do as this wish.  It's also important for Americans to understand that even in Indonesia, men like that view our crimes in Guantanamo and elsewhere during the ""War on Terror"" as after the fact justification for what they did.  As one of Congo's buddies said, ""why should I worry about the Hague?  The winners write the rules.  The Americans said torture was wrong and then they decided it wasn't.  We've done the same thing here.""

""The Act of Killing"" fulfills a vital role of a documentary.  It takes facts you should know, no matter how unpleasant, and makes you confront them.

For the second consecutive issue of the ARC Newsletter, I am reviewing an important, superlative work devoted to human rights without any content directly relating to genital cutting.  Joshua Oppenheimers 2013 film, The Act of Killing, co-directed by Christine Cinn and an Indonesian who understandably remains anonymous, won no fewer than a stupendous seven documentary filmmaking awards.

As with Charli Carpenters outstanding book reviewed in the last issue (Forgetting Children Born of War: Setting the Human Rights Agenda in Bosnia and Beyond), this motion picture simply must be seen by anyone with an interest in human rights, law, or justice.

What causes someone to knowingly, deliberately violate the right to life and security of another human being?  Is it possible to do so and remain an intelligent, thinking person?  Evidently some people find it possible to so compartmentalize their thinking that they can even take pleasure in recounting their atrocities and their excellence (if such a word can even be so used) at committing them.  Even more shockingly, it seems that a large percentage of the countrys citizens propped up these torturers views of themselves.

The star of the film is gangster Anwar Congo, one of Suhartos worst human rights violators and even today viewed as a hero by most Indonesian residents.  In 1965, after Suharto overthrew the democratically elected president Sukarno, an ostensibly anti-Communist purge was conducted that caused the deaths of an astonishing total of over half million people. Congo was one of the main beneficiaries, as he made the career leap from selling black market movie theatre tickets to master-minding and leading what became a notorious North Sumatran death squad.  Congo personally killed at least 1,000 people, usually by strangling them with wire using a method he breezily demonstrates in the film.  After he re-enacts this killing method, he seems distraught, saying, I cant do that again.

Today, as Oppenheimer graphically shows us, Congo is revered as a founding father of the right-wing paramilitary organization Pemuda Pancasila and its youth-oriented branch Pancaila Youth, which both trace their lineage through the death squads. Pemuda Pancasila is so powerful that its leaders include government ministers, and they are happy to boast about everything from corruption and election rigging to clearing out peasants for land developers and genocide.
Invited by Oppenheimer, Congo and his friends recount and re-enact their experiences and some of their killings for the cameras. The scenes are produced in the styles of their favorite film genres: gangster, western, and musical. As the films publicity says, they re-create their real-life killings as they dance their way through musical sequences, twist arms in film noir gangster scenes, and gallop across prairies as Western cowboys.  While some of Congo's friends realize that the killings were wrong, others worry about the effects on their public image of the story being publicized.
After Congo plays the role of a victim of his own human rights violations, he finds himself unable to continue. He says that he feels what his victims have felt. Oppenheimer, from behind the camera, points out that it was much worse for the victims, because they knew they were going to be killed, whereas Congo was only acting. Congo then expresses doubts over whether he has sinned or not, tearfully saying he does not want the memories of what he did to come back to him. He revisits the rooftop where he claims many of his killings took place, and gags repeatedly.

Congos comments are illuminating.  He says: Killing is the worst crime you can do. So the key is to find a way not to feel guilty.  Its all about finding the right excuse. For example, if Im asked to kill someone, if the compensation is right, (raising hands in air) then of course Ill do it, and from one perspective its not wrong. Thats the perspective we must make ourselves believe.

Another participant in the crimes tells smilingly of finding in a barrel the body of his own stepfather, who raised him. We buried him like a goat next to the main road. He laughingly continues, Then all the Communist families were exiled. Thats why Ive never been to school. Thats why I had to teach myself to read and write. I promise Im not criticizing what were dong. Its only input for the film.

Chillingly, an employee in the office where many of the torture incidents occurs claims that he was never aware of what happened. Surprised, Congo replies, Even the neighbors knew! How could he not know!

Congos position on war crimes is illuminating: War crimes are defined by the winners. So I can make my own definitions. Im not bound by the Geneva Conventions..

Congo appears on a modern day talk show with wildly applauding Pancasila Youth members in the audience. According to the smiling talk show host, Congo taught his country a less sadistic way of killing communists and he avoided excessive violence.  The vice president of the country says at a Pancasila Youth meeting, Beating people up is sometimes needed, drawing cheers from the audience.

Congo has an answer as to why the children of the victims of his crimes have not taken revenge on him for their losses: Its not that they don't want to take revenge. They cant because wed exterminate them all.

Congo calls his grandkids to the television set to watch replays of some of the scenes he has filmed. Come watch this scene where Grandpa is tortured and killed. Oppenheimer asks, But this is too violent. You sure? Congo: No problem. Theyll be fine.

Did the people I tortured feel the way I do here? he asks as hes watching it.
I can feel what the people I tortured feel. Because my dignity here has been destroyed, and then fear comes. Starting to weep uncontrollably, he adds, I did this to so many people. Is it all coming back to me? I really don't want it to.

Extortion of money from Chinese merchants is shown. Back in the day, merchants were refused to pay were ruthlessly murdered by Congo and his henchmen.  Congo is clearly proud to show off how things were done.

Toward the end of the film, Congo makes an illuminating comparison: Why do people watch films about the Nazis? His answer: To see power and sadism.  Congo repeatedly mentions being troubled by nightmares yet never draws the ever so obvious connection to his own actions.

If Congo never felt remorse, was never plagued by doubt, this would still be a powerhouse of a film.  The fact that Oppenheimer and his co-directors were able to get this sort of honesty from their subjects is astonishing, and doubtless they risked their own lives to make the movie.  The most impressive fact of all is that Congo is a human being, intermittently able to weep for his victims, to empathize for them, and to recognize the horrible nature of his actions.  Yet at the end of the day, he laughs, excuses himself with his own professionalism and a recitation of the asserted political conditions that ostensibly forced his behavior.  And in his view his actions have been sanitized, even justified.  This film simply must be seen.  It is a breathtaking achievement.",1409529600,10,7375,4.95698051948052

5882991,3,B00E0MT3SE,"I borrowed this DVD from my local library after seeing good reviews of it on Amazon. Below is my opinion.

The Good

It reveals Indonesian government used gangsters to kill hundreds of thousands of communists in 1965 and 1966.  These gangsters publicly claimed they worked for the government.

It shows how brutal the killings were. For example, in one scene, the killer shows how he uses a wire with 2 pieces of wood tied to both end to cut off the head of the prisoner.

It exposes the people who were killed did not get a fair trial. It implies some innocent people were killed because they were alleged of being communists.

The Bad

The way the story was told is boring. The majority of the film shows the re-enacted killings done by two old gangsters who claimed to have killed a lot of people. The re-enactments look so mockery that they greatly reduce the quality of the documentary. They also fail to present the large scale of the massacres of up to 500,000 people as mentioned by Wikipedia dot org.

I agree with another reviewer who says this film is overrated.

It's worth watching if you want to see with your own eyes some of what happened with the communist massacres in Indonesia. However, it's boring and not well-done.",1398902400,2,1237,4.586363636363636

I have never seen a documentary where the perpetrators of horrific acts willingly tell what they did with no fear of retribution, or, so far, any regret. On the contrary, they retell their deeds as if they are to be celebrated. This is because in their country they work for the successful political group and are considered hero's, though they committed atrocities. they tell their stories of murder in front of their grandchildren, relatives, and other children, as if these are suitable stories for children - as in ""your grandpa killed so many people and it was extremely bloody and stinky and messy beating them to death, so clever grandpa devised a way of strangling them instead (grandpa demonstrates), significantly reducing the amount of blood and mess."" (I'm taking some license here, as the grandfather didn't tell his grandson this story on camera, but instead allowed the child to view the re-enactment alongside him.)

to me, one of the most chilling perps (so far) is the newspaperman who admits on camera to planting lies in his paper to frame innocent people and to make peasant Indonesians hate other ordinary peasant Indonesians who happened to be powerless communists (powerless because they were unable to prevent their own murder), and that he tells us what he did with no sense of self-loathing. Just the opposite, he brags that a wink from him to the muscle got people killed. He boasts, reveling in his power to have people murdered; it is something to display, as he displays the many photos on his walls.  another awful reveal, currently ongoing, is the shakedown of poor Chinese booth renters in the village where the filming takes place. We are actually shown how relatively powerless people in this village are leaned on and threatened with violence. To avoid beatings, they are forced to pay protection money. This is captured on camera. The look on the shopkeeper's faces as they fork over the little bit of money they have, money that could feed their families or pay their rent, given instead to thugs, is extremely sad. the thugs are so clueless that they don't mind showing how abusive they are. really, really interesting.

5883005,4,B00E0MT3SE,"""The Act of Killing"" received an Oscar nomination for Best Documentary, and was recommended to me by a human rights colleague. While watching it, I could see why it was nominated - and recommended.

This fast-moving two-hour documentary centers around a genocide in Indonesia in the 1960s, in which a million or more artists, intellectuals, and ethnic Chinese were assassinated by government-sanctioned death squads in an effort to ""exterminate"" all ""communists"". It's worth noting that the ruling military regime at the time - along with its anti-communist effort - was proactively supported by the U.S. government.

Director Joshua Oppenheimer spent several years in Indonesia researching the genocide. In the process, he met Anwar Congo, a death squad leader who had personally killed as many as 1,000 alleged communists. Congo and his fellow assassins were proud, even boastful, of their actions. And so Oppenheimer ingeniously decided to allow the killers to tell their own stories on film. The result is this movie.

It's disturbing in that the killers who star in the movie are proud of their actions, and eager to share the gruesome details. While making ""their"" movie, they boastfully reenact various killings in order to show us just how clever and brutal they were.

One assassin, Anwar Congo's old friend, explains - or, rather, justifies - why he feels no guilt:

  ""'War crimes' are defined by the winners. I'm a winner. So I can make my own definition.""

The concept of human rights is held in disdain in this culture, and is ridiculed. And the killers are regarded as heroes in their country.

Will this filmmaking exercise cause any of the killers to finally recognize and confront the wrongness of their actions? Watch the movie and see if you think so.",1394409600,8,1771,5.037671232876712

5883007,5,B00E0MT3SE,"How do you know if a documentary takes risks? If the final credits are full of people named ""Anonymous.""

The Act of Killing is about veterans of 1960s death squads  so-called ""gangsters"" backed by the Suharto regime and its CIA accomplices who kidnapped, tortured and killed an estimated 2.5 million people. But it's also about the current government's embrace of well-funded paramilitary gangs who use the half-buried memory of these murders to bully local communities.

The director gives a group of retired killers the chance to make a movie about their bloody escapades. In their youth, the killers copied their execution gimmicks from US gangster movies. It takes months for some of the men to wonder if documenting torture and assassination is such a bright idea. For at least one ""gangster,"" a master of the garrote who claims to have personally killed 1,000 people, scenes of the crime prove increasingly unbearable. The killer crew is reminiscent of the reputed makeup of German death squads in Eastern Europe in the 1940s: sadists, drunks and moral cowards.

This is grim stuff, of course, when it's not farcical. But if you're optimistic, the film may persuade you that bloodbaths do not come easily, after all, except to the genuine psychopaths  and to the smooth politicians who license them. It takes extremely brave filmmakers and crews to work among such zombies. Meantime, the ghosts of genocide may, in their dread silence, ultimately possess more power than hired thugs to shape a nation's future. Dead, alive, or someplace in between, nobody ever really forgets.

Highly recommended.",1394064000,8,1604,5.126436781609195
5883008,5,B00E0MT3SE,"(This is a review of the director's version which may contain scenes not in the theatrical version) In 1965, a military revolt in Indonesia crushed a popular movement and coup attempt. The military's actions were inspired by propaganda produced with the help of the CIA and the groups that were responsible for the revolt were composed of various paramilitary groups and violent street gangs funded by the US government because of its fear of communist elements in the popular movement and in the government. However after these paramilitary groups took over the country, they imposed decades of brutal authoritarian and genocidal policies purging anyone suspected of communist allegiance (again, endorsed and supported by the US government. We know this through the US government's own records released through the Freedom of Information Act). More than 2 million died as a result of political, religious and ethnic cleansing mainly against alleged communists and their families, Christians and ethnic Chinese. To this day, Indonesia is only gradually beginning to come out of that hell.

This film details the current lives of many of those who had done the dirty work of exterminating alleged communists and other undesirables within Indonesian society. Many of whom have now profited well and are treated as heroes in their country. Some remain as influential parts of the government today. A few of the most brutal murderers were given the opportunity to not only explain what they did but to show it through reenactments produced with the murderers as writers, producers and actors. Their crimes were never mechanized and systematized like the Nazis but they often used their hands and other crude instruments to murder and torture their victims.

The viewer is constantly in a state of prolonged horror when watching this movie as no other film portrays evil as palpably and as clearly. The film makers could have interviewed historians and victims or made reenactments that used professional actors as most documentaries do but the genius of this film is the realization that nothing conveys evil better than evil itself so they had the perpetrators recreate what they have done.

There are so many memorable scenes that will stay with a viewer forever.

The murderers talks about how they went about their business of murdering people in all the details and they seemed to relish reliving the memories. They laugh and dance to the internal echoes of their victims screams. There are remarkable admissions. At one point two of the leaders of the killing gangs talked about a famous anti-communist film all Indonesian children were made to watch and how it had instilled in them a violent hatred of communists. The film portrayed communists killing, torturing and raping Indonesians. One of the killers then mentioned what complete bs that film was and that it was a lie through and through used as propaganda and that they were the cruel and sadistic ones not the communists. The other killer agrees with him but says that they shouldn't talk this way in front of the camera or to foreigners. Other ex paramilitary and gang leaders talked about how much they enjoyed raping 14 year old girls and murdering the father's of their girlfriends.

Also interestingly, many of those who acted in the reenactments began to sob and cry during their scenes. Their reactions seemed to be wholly genuine outpouring of emotion instead of acting. After one particularly griping shoot involving a reenactment of a brutal interrogation, Anwar Congo broke down and wondered aloud whether his victims had felt the same level of fear and degradation he did during the scene. The director talking from behind the camera was quick to point out to him that his victims suffered far worse because Congo knew that this was a film but his victims knew they were going to die and were actually tortured to death.

In another interesting scene Congo goes back to his ""headquarters"" where he and his henchmen once interrogated hundreds of people and murdered them on the roof of the building. As the interview went on, he began to repeatedly dry heave. The more he talked the more it was interrupted with his hacking gags. This was presumably his physical repulsion by the memories of his actions which caused the gag reflex but it was almost like something out of a scene from an exorcism like a battle between a demon and him was occurring internally and the demon was trying to stay in and he was trying to expel it. It was surreal like much of the rest of the film.

Another subject and friend of Congo talked about his complete lack of guilt for what he did. The film shows him in mundane actions such as shopping in a modern mall with his wife and daughter or driving down a city street while the viewer is constantly reminded by the brutal and gory reenactments past actions in scenes before and immediately after. The director asks him at one point what he would feel if he was sent to the Hague to crimes against humanity and he said he would gladly go because it would make him famous around the world. He also mentioned how his crimes are like those committed in Nazi Germany and the United States at points in their history and that he likely won't be punished as well like the perpetrators of those crimes.

Many of the characters this film really are demonic beings (if you think my uses of the words 'demonic' and 'evil' are hyperbole, I suggest watching this film first then see if they are not perfectly fitting). This film might make a great antidote to those postmodern moral nihilists who deny the existence of evil.

But the most disturbing thing that one gets out of the film is a misanthropic realization that these people are not much different from the vast majority of humanity and that their society isn't that much different in its superficial callousness towards violence. Their crimes have been repeated throughout history in Germany, Japan and the United States and many other parts of the world. Moreover, the film shows how the cruelest actions can be blended with crude entertainment and political propaganda to produce a public acceptance of evil through conflating and sanitizing it. There is no guarantee that had any of us been tested in the same way we'd do the same or perhaps look the other way in cowardness or indifference instead of fighting against it.

This is perhaps one of the few films ever made where one is required a kind of courage, not a kind of superficial courage like what it takes to watch a really scary horror movie but a kind of moral courage to see and even greater courage to make.",1393804800,13,6625,4.849690539345712
5883009,5,B00E0MT3SE,"It's one thing to read in a book about the atrocities of another time or place or even watch it in a dramatic retelling where we suspend our disbelief and go along with the storyline.  It's a whole different experience to watch people in real time based on actual events in a documentary boast about their patriotic war exploits, and their direct contribution to killing hundreds of thousands to millions of ordinary ""communist"" citizens without a trial, without evidence, without any consideration - other than the apparent direction of the (state?) run newspaper? and other higher-ups.  Even more mind bending are the re-enactments of the killings in the attempt to retell and glorify their win over tyranny and evil, the communist threat, with the open support by the Indonesian public officials, the state-run television shows, the military leaders, and their candor about the rampant corruption and the ""gangsters"" being a necessary evil in society for the greater good.  The list goes on.

Questions arise and analogies abound watching the movie flooding my brain with implications, for example, how often do Hollywood films glorify the eradication of evil?  What role does fiction, the media, mythology, self-narratives and state-narratives have in our lives?  Who decides when it is ok to kill and torture (openly addressed in the movie by one Indonesian death squad leader)?

Whether their actions were necessary and legitimate, and whether there was a real threat in 1965 of Indonesia being overthrown by communists is not really addressed, which is where I diverge from the director.  There is an assumption of guilt in the documentary, which is difficult to deny or reject.  Having listened to the director speak (and I think he's brilliant), I disagree with him on that point.  The director says he believes all the characters know what they did was wrong.  I disagree with that sentiment.  I don't think people know right from wrong that clearly in general. Morality gets so clouded over by competing values in society, loyalty, religion, community, country, friendship, fairness, harm, etc..  His use of a remorseful, internally conflicted man to demonstrate some type of predisposed or natural morality demonstrates more so the murkiness of morality than the naturalness of it for me, which is more effective at raising questions than it would have been had he only talked to the most smugly self-righteous death squad leaders.  Even if you ignore social values altogether (if you can even do that) and take natural selection as the moral foundation, I think killing might be even more supported and pronounced.  I imagine moral fluidity would be a better adaption than moral inflexibility.  I tend to believe morality is an evolutionary adaptation which is one reason among many that casts doubt on any absolutist moral framework... so in that regard, I am in some agreement with the killer in the movie who compares his deeds with the US torture in Guantanamo (which I'm Wholly against by the way - I don't really care if the CIA thinks it was necessary as was seemingly suggested by Zero Dark Thirty).  The Killer is being defensive in the scene by Oppenheimer's line of questioning, but he's right, i think, that leaders of nations decide when it's OK to break with our moral codes for the greater good of our culture, for its protection, etc., for better or worse, right or wrong, greed, pleasure, whatever their reasons... hemorrhoids, their dog just died.  I am somewhat nauseated by the immorality of the average person in society (including myself sometimes) and our national leaders which frequently makes me question my own sense of right and justice.  Recently, studies and researchers have been saying, for example, that people are wired for poly-amory.  Does that make cheating on one's spouse right or wrong?  Using the word cheating would suggest yes, but starting from a premise of an open relationship and polygamy being considered wrong by most (at least most Christians here in the US), but the ""science"" is revealing otherwise.  How do we manage these conflicting drives... with religion, social norms, laws, guilt, shame, etc.?  Or is it even necessary to control in the first place?  Against what some may believe, I would argue that morality, social norms and political economy all form quite the muddy waters. I am much more aligned I believe with the director's moral inflexibility than most (at least that's how I perceive the director and myself, but as Jonathan Haidt points out, self-righteousness is the natural human order).

The world is getting smaller, more connected, etc. which i think promotes a rejection of the anti-social nature of killing because it's getting harder for people to distinguish otherness from ourselves.  When groups are separated, i think it's easier for us as humans to separate the enemies from ourselves and overlook the unnaturalness of killing people like ourselves.  It's easier to pretend that they are not like us.  And if they're openly trying to kill us, pushing us to the extreme of kill or be killed.. well I'm not sure how Oppenhiemer could say in that scenario that it is wrong and everyone knows it (if that's indeed what he believes, which it seems like he may from listening to him speak).  And maybe the main actors, as corrupt and absurd as they appear, maybe that's what they thought in 1965, and still believe today.  It's hard to say from watching a few of them in the film.  The attitudes of the people in the movie did appear quite venal, self-interested and grotesque, and seeing how much the thinking seemed to pervade the highest powers of that society was jaw dropping.

After watching The Act of Killing, I came across this interview with the psychology professor Lt. Col. Dave Grossman on youtube where he talks about people's natural moral aversion to killing, which manifests as nausea and retching.  He says the military recognizes this instinct and develops ways to shut it off and when the soldiers come home we have ways of honoring them so that we and they can accept their actions as having been necessary for the greater good of the people.

The genius of the movie is that it forces us to recognize similarities we share with the actors in the film, making us grapple with the horror (or complexity) of it inside us all.  It's hard not to see that the people in the movie are just people, like everyone else with one exception... one of them was reveling in the great heavenly pleasures of raping children.  I totally agree with the director resisting the description of the characters as the ""banality of evil"" by replacing it with the ""humanity of evil.""  The characters seem so typical, which I think is part of the movie's potency.  It's hard to point a finger and say those people over there because they are all too similar to everyone else, including ourselves.

If the director wants to suggest that we put an end to war, because ""all killing is wrong,"" well I'm with him on that push for peace but I must disagree on a simple claim about the idea that all killing is wrong.  Morality is too messy for that type of a simplistic dogma or prescription.  Circumstances and conditions play too important a role in making such a claim outright for me, but I guess that's why I tend to be a utilitarian with libertarian underpinnings.",1393632000,,7350,4.904684975767367

Unfortunately, having seen it, I don't support the argument in favor of a Best Documentary Feature nomination.  While the film admittedly depicts colorful characters dancing around a dark period in history, it falls short of exposing the fact of what was happening in Indonesia in 1965.

The film left too many important questions unanswered, such as who exactly was being killed, and why?  The film focuses instead on the quest for penance by a few self-proclaimed ex-thugs that supposedly carried out thousands of executions.  However, no evidence is presented verifying that these people actually carried out those executions, nor was any explanation given for the executions outside of the fact that the people being executed were ""communists"".

I suppose the film does a decent job of presenting a dramatic depiction of the horrors of war...but wait, this is a documentary!  Remind me again what exactly this film documented?  Oh yes, this film documents at length elaborately costumed women dancing out of the mouth of a submarine sized carp and an obese ex-warlord obsessed with posing in skimpy Carmen Miranda costumes.

The premise of the film is to document aging warlords acting out the executions they performed decades before.  However, with the exception of one scene toward the end of the film, the light hearted nature of the reenactments served to marginalize, and often mock rather than call sympathetic attention to their supposed crimes.",1391385600,8,1573,5.109375

The fact that these killers literally reenact their murders and tortures is terrifying.

Rating: 4.5 out of 5.0

In 1965, following a military coup in Indonesia, various gangsters and paramilitary leaders and their followers were given free rein to kill as many people they deemed 'Communists' as they could. The result was that approximately 500,000 people were murdered in these anti-Communist purges including many ethnic Chinese. Joshua Oppenheimer, the film's creator, was living in Indonesia since 2001 and attempted to interview some of the victims and relatives of the victims of these massacres but soon found out that it would be dangerous to do so. Instead, it was suggested to him that he seek out the murderers themselves and much to his surprise, they were more than willing to cooperate.

Oppenheimer developed the idea that if he allowed his interviewees the ability to create cinematic scenes illustrating their role in the carnage, this might get them to open up even more. After meeting with approximately forty of these self-admitted killers, he came upon one Anwar Congo, a white-haired, grandfatherly looking man, who bears a slight resemblance to Nelson Mandela (one good way of looking at Congo, is that he's the anti-Mandela). Congo explained that he was a young man back at the time of the anti-Communist purges, working as a ticket scalper, and soon became a self-appointed 'gangster', claiming to have murdered approximately 1,000 so-called 'Communists'. Joining Congo is Herman Koto, a paramilitary leader, much feared in the area of North Sumatra where he's from.

One of the disturbing things about Congo is that he has a charming and magnetic personality. Congo openly boasts about how he enjoyed committing these murders and is now revered as an elder statesmen by the Pancasila Youth organization, a right-wing para-military group that reportedly boasts 3 million members strong. Oppenheimer films the current head of this youth organization who reminds one of Baldur von Schirach, the head of the Hitler Youth in Nazi Germany.

Congo demonstrates on film how he used to strangle his victims with wire, in order to prevent his victims from bleeding too much. When he visits the current governor of North Sumatra, the governor makes the point that Congo was much feared in his day as a 'gangster', but he had no fear of him, because Congo was basically like an uncle to him. Congo and the governor define the word 'gangster' as 'free men'. It's obvious that Congo's behavior is approved by all levels of the current government in Indonesia today. A newspaper editor who used to order the deaths of various people he deemed Communists back in the 60s, is shown to be a close friend of the current president of Indonesia, who received training by the US military in the United States prior to his election as president.

Congo and his fellow henchmen seem to have no guilt feelings about insisting that they were far more cruel than the people they killed. But Congo seems to be the only one who was affected by the killings. He suffers from nightmares and at the end of the film, is seen retching at the site where many were killed. Another paramilitary leader, Adi Zulkadry, has no guilt feelings whatsoever. While driving with Oppenheimer who questions him from the back seat of a vehicle, Zulkadry boasts that he's not bound by the Hague Convention, since ""history is written by the winners."" Furthermore he points out that the US under Bush provided chemical weapons to Sadaam Hussein, who used them against his own people. So if the US was complicit in war crimes, why should he be singled out.

The documentary takes on a surreal quality during the re-enactments created by the aging gangsters. One particularly disturbing scene involves women and children who volunteered to illustrate rapes and murders in a particular village. Even Congo seems a bit perturbed when children begin crying during these re-enactments.

Other crazy stuff involves shakedowns by a high-ranking paramilitary soldier of ethnic Chinese vendors in the local markets. Right on camera he demands money from these poor businessmen and when he feels they haven't given him enough, he asks for more.

Mr. Oppenheimer has provided a great service in putting a human face on the purveyors of genocide. Instead of horrible devils, Congo and his ilk appear to be charming raconteurs. These are people who revel in being sadistic and boasting about their many misdeeds (in their eyes), is a source of power.

Don't ever think that any of these men will be brought to the bar of justice. The United States has been a long-time supporter of Indonesia, particularly during the cold war, when their anti-Communist stance was in full force. The same applies to China--despite the fact that many ethnic Chinese were slaughtered during the genocide that occurred in 1965, the Communist Chinese government resumed diplomatic relations with Indonesia in 1990, and the two countries are strong trading partners.

'The Act of Killing' represents an indictment of a society that thrives on the intolerance of others. By exposing the mindset of these people, people here in the West should have no illusions about who they are dealing with in such countries that support and promote a fascistic mentality.

Ultimately, I believe Mr. Oppenheimer's hope was by gaining the trust of these killers, he could perhaps influence them to develop some kind of moral conscience. Only Anwar Congo seemed to have any guilt feelings about his role in the killings as he admittedly suffered from nightmares and was seen retching at the site of the massacres. But even Congo still doesn't seem to make the connection--he can't stop the nightmares because he truly is not repentant.

'The Act of Killing' may have benefited from more judicious editing as it's a bit long in places. Nevertheless, Oppenheimer has exposed the dark side of human nature by bravely befriending people who can best be described as scary and dangerous.",1390867200,4,5958,5.024316109422492

Imagine walking up to a known killer and asking him to reenact one of his murders, then questioning him about all the gory details. Well, thats exactly what Joshua Oppenheimer, the maker of the documentary The Act of Killing, did - over and over again, in fact.

The killers in question all committed their atrocities fifty-some-odd years ago as part of an anti-Communist purge in Indonesia perpetrated by the military dictatorship that had just risen to power there (its made clear at the very beginning of the film that the Communists were often just farmers, union members, Chinese immigrants, intellectuals and anyone not supportive of the military regime). In one years time, over a million such people had been slaughtered. Today many of the killers, all of whom have gone unpunished for their crimes, are now in positions of great influence and power in the government. The focus of the film is on two men and their minions in particular: Anwar Congo and Ad Zulkadry, members of one of the death squads in North Sumatra, personally responsible for the deaths of thousands. Congo went on to found a paramilitary right-wing organization known as Pemuda Pancasila, which boasts many adherents and followers - mainly young people - even today.

The makers of The Act of Killing have gathered together this group of self-proclaimed gangsters, who have decided to make a mainstream movie on the subject with themselves and their buddies as the stars. But what the documentarians actually wanted was to give these men the opportunity to relate not only how they committed the murders but how they feel about it all nearly five decades later. And it is their responses in this regard that make this such a stunning and disturbing movie to sit through. For not only is there virtually no remorse - or even much of an attempt at rationalization - expressed over the people they tortured and killed, these men can barely contain their feelings of nostalgia and pride as they regale their audiences with their memories. There are a few moments of quiet reflection: one man discusses the nightmares he occasionally has about the people he strangled; another dismisses concerns of morality by arguing that one generations war crimes are another generations accepted practices, and that the victors ultimately get to determine what is right and what is wrong in the long view of history (he brings up Americas decimation of its indigenous peoples and Bushs sanctioning of torture at Guantanamo Bay as examples to buttress his argument). Apparently the PR spokesman for the group, this individual has at least enough of a perspective to fear that the movie that they are making may actually make themselves look cruel and the Communists sympathetic in the eyes of the general public if they re-create the tortures and killings too effectively.

Yet, such moments are the exceptions. Most of the time, were learning about how gratifying it can be to take another mans life or rape a child or burn down a terrified familys house as they watch. And its all supposed to be okay since gangster really means free man, a fact we are told at least a dozen times throughout the course of the movie. That is somehow supposed to justify not only the killings in the past but the corruption and abuse of power many of them are perpetrating in the present. And, most shockingly of all, the media and much of the general populace of the area seem to go along with it - though how much of their approbation is actually the product of fear is anyones guess.

The irony is that, while these gangsters keep declaiming against the evils of Communism, they have set up their own positions of power in a way perfectly aligned with how that system has worked wherever it has been tried. For instance, we see one of the men wending his way through a crowded marketplace, going from one honest, hardworking shopkeeper to another, extorting money through threats, and, later, running (unsuccessfully) for parliament so hell be able to wring even more money out of the decent citizens of his country.

Many of the men point to Hollywood as their inspiration, explaining how they adopted many of the tough-guy styles and attitudes they saw in pictures in their youth - and even some of their torture and killing techniques. Score another one for American exports!

Weve seen so many dramatized accounts of genocide and war crimes in movies and on TV that seeing these actual perpetrators re-enacting their atrocities takes the subject to a whole new level. And the depressing part is to realize that these are not just isolated cases, that the world is indeed full of such men eager to trumpet the evil theyve done. Its true that, near the end, Congo has what appears to be a breakdown of remorse, finally comprehending what it is he did all those years ago.  But is it too little, too late? And how much of it is genuine and how much of it is staged? (These are actors, after all). Unfortunately for these men, redemption cannot be had for the price of a movie ticket.

Its safe to say that The Act of Killing provided me with the most surreal experience Ive ever had watching a movie. At times, I found myself thinking it must be some sort of put-on, an elaborate piece of street theater designed to trick the unwary into believing its real. Alas, it isn't a hoax, and, for that reason alone, it emerges as one of the most deeply disturbing looks into the dark heart of humanity ever put on film.",1390348800,8,5471,4.756585879873551

Rena Kaneko  The Act of Killing films 1965-66 memories from the perspective of murderers who see themselves as cinema celebrities, swaggering, dancing, gleefully re-portraying their killing of hundreds of thousands often with their own hands, as they boastfully relive their ascent to political power.

Director Oppenheimer was not surprised privileged officials dissembled in response to direct questions. Instead Oppenheimer offered to film whatever memories would be offered, in whatever form desired, allowing the individuals being filmed to write, direct and act out their killings. The production involved ethereal Busby Berkeley dance numbers, dream sequences, ""making of"" footage, and terrified supporting actors, including women and children, whose genuine distress is obviously not acting.

All cruelty springs from weakness. Seneca

Self justification ""the winners get to write history"" is blunt and straightforward ""I don't feel guilty."" Over the course of 8 years of filming perpetrators recreating their brutality ""we are more sadistic than Nazis"" it becomes clear to the actors that the viewing audience may judge their cinematic bravado as evil and their victims as victims. Yet they continue filming as if driven by emotional need for catharsis to keep telling their view of what happened.

For two hours I was mesmerized watching murderer's empathy dawn for what their cinematic macho violence must have cost victims: terror, helplessness, fear. The memories of humiliating and degrading other human beings and taking their lives begin to wear on the perpetrators who devise a dream sequence of the dead forgiving and thanking their murderers for freeing them from the bonds of earth.

I mean, I will watch nearly any and everything, and the squeamish doesnt make me think any less of you.  I particularly enjoy a film that pushes me; that actually causes me to question things or makes me uncomfortable because of its stance or presentation.

But honestly, The Act of Killing kind of rubbed me the wrong way.

I know that this has been lauded and I know that this has received many (and I mean MANY) awards, but as a complete film I found myself wondering why it was being lauded and praised so deeply.  I understand the point the filmmakers were getting at, and yet while I feel that to a degree (and I guess that degree really depends on who it is that is watching the movie) the film made that point, the point is lost (at least for me) in the filmmakers directorial and visual decisions.  The subject is harrowing, the presentation is creative and the final frames are intoxicating and yet together these all create a film I found somewhat distasteful.

The Act of Killing, Joshua Oppenheimers Oscar nominated Documentary, dares to allow Indonesian death squad leaders to tell their stories cinematically.  They were allowed to select the film genres they desired and essentially act out their disgusting atrocities for our viewing pleasure.  Yes, there is a point to this madness (for as they watch back on playback you can see the realities of their horrors sink in) but for me the payoff is too little to justify the means here.  I know that many will not agree with me, and Ive already been told that I was wrong for thinking this, but to me The Act of Killing was too exploitive for its own good.  In a way, the first half of the film comes across almost glorifying the acts, while the second half serves as a means to poke fun at these morally corrupt individuals.  Watching these viscous men dress up like women in colorful costumes, parading around covered in fake blood or singing show tunes feels oddly theatrical and uncomfortably humorous when you consider the context of the film itself.  Giving these men free reign as they reminisce on when they were kings, killing on a whim and destroying lives, all the while their eyes filled with glee; my head was throbbing in anger and confusion.

Why?

I feel like The Act of Killing has a very powerful message to convey, but I don't agree with Oppenheimers choices here.  Yes, seeing Anwar dry heave at the very thought of what he had done is a very raw and mesmerizing moment, and it at least confirms that this exercise was beneficial to an extent (even if the moment is short lived and Anwar then proceeds to joyfully show his grandchildren the scene where he dies), but I question whether this was an exercise the rest of us needed to see.",1390176000,8,2805,4.522772277227722

Since these men started out as gangsters hustling movie theater tickets, there's an odd and repellent circular feel to the proceedings. These men love the movies, name dropping actors like Al Pacino and John Wayne as reference points for their murderous actions; on the talk show, Congo playfully suggests he resembles Sidney Poitier (he decidedly does not).

And so, we have history re-told as a musical, or a western, or a gangster film, or a horror movie, with the death squad members playing different roles; Congo gets done up in a dark wig (covering his greyed hair) and make-up to resemble his younger self. He also plays victim at points. Just like a ""real movie,"" there are dream sequences, production numbers, and heroic speeches.

It's a fascinating perversion of humanity. Congo and his cohorts are remarkably candid about their deeds, offering up graphic descriptions of torture and murder in a strikingly facile manner. Congo talks about coming from watching an Elvis movie, and singing and dancing while he tortured people to death; Congo and the other killers seem to not have any real stake in politics whatsoever, no sense of self-righteousness or that the ends justified the means. They were merely mercenary thugs who parlayed a revolution into a money-making scheme. The film also notes that there was virtually no intervention from the western nations; if anything, there was tacit approval, likely because the death squads were eradicating ""communists.""

The film re-creations are bizarre and shocking, particularly the ones that feature Herman Koto, an obese paramilitary leader who does drag in his ""film"" scenes. Done up in elaborate make-up, headdresses, and wigs, as well as flowing, brightly colored gowns, Koto's female character turns up as villain, vamp, and a seemingly supernatural creature. If we did not know this man's history, it would be easy to see him as a comic relief actor, much like Italy's Bombolo.

Koto and Congo spend time watching the rushes and discussing their hopes for the finished film, taking it all very seriously, but frankly, it's difficult to imagine this mlnge of scenes and styles being cut together to make a cohesive, narrative.

The Act of Killing is fascinating, troubling, and infuriating on so many levels. On the one hand, it seems that these men are out to redeem themselves for actions that have no redemptionone paramilitary leader takes us on a tour of his opulent home, showing off delicate, one-of-a-kind glassware he's picked up on his world travels, offering himself as a genteel sophisticate. But then, we realize that these men really aren't seeking redemption, they're buying into their legend-status as heroes, even if they never set out to be. They make no apologies and few excuses for the atrocities they committed; on the contrary, they have bragging rights to the horrors.

Long before midpoint, it becomes awfully overwhelmingthe reprehensible men cheerfully describing their inhumanity; the re-creations of the atrocities; the absolute soullessness of Congo and company; and the overblown, histrionic film-within-a film, which frankly looks more Bollywoodor even Dollywoodthan Hollywood. At times, it comes perilously close to being less like watching a movie and more like experiencing a Black Box-style sensory overload.

The film was directed by Joshua Oppenheimer, Christine Cynn, and an Indonesian filmmaker who has chosen to remain anonymous, fearing reprisal (a number of crew members also retained their anonymity for the same reason); Werner Herzog (Grizzly Man) and Errol Morris (The Fog of War) served as executive producers.

The two-Blu disc set includes the 166-minute director's cut as well as the 122-minute theatrical version. I watched the director's cut; generally, when given the option, that seems the way to go. I'm not so sure in this case. ""Overwhelming"" is again the word that comes to mind; I'm not sure what was removed for the theatrical release, but it's not hard to imagine losing 20 or so minutes from what I watched and still having a compelling, disturbing film.

Image quality is fine for this 1.78:1/1080p transfer, considering it's almost all interviews, archival footage, and scenes from the faux-movie, and cinematography wasn't the main focus. The DTS-HD 5.1 audio track is strong, with virtually all dialogue in Indonesian with non-removable subtitles.

The Act of Killing (Blu-ray) sports an impressive slate of supplements. Disc One, which contains the shorter theatrical version, includes an interview with Oppenheimer on Democracy Now; interviews with Herzog and Morris for Vice Presents; and deleted scenes, plus trailers for this film and other Drafthouse releases. The second disc, which contains the extended director's cut, also includes a commentary with Oppenheimer and Herzog. There is also a 64-page booklet with an essay by Morris, along with a code for a digital download. This is an excellent set of supplements, each one insightful and meaningful, adding to the viewing experiences as supplements should.

5883036,5,B00E0MT3SE,"""Haunting"" has become a well-worn cliche to describe maudlin dramas in hyperbolic terms but this film will literally haunt your thoughts and insinuate itself into your perspective. While the ""banality of evil"" is a given for all save those who envision it at the end of a pitchforkeven that phrase creates too much comfortable distance in our conceptions between the loving grandfather and the psychopathic mass murdererthis portrait of killers and the society that lionizes them will disabuse you of the false distinction between monsters and heroes.

The psychological portrait of vanity, delusion, rationalization, and cognitive dissonance is as complex as any you will ever see.",1389052800,3,682,5.433962264150943
5883037,5,B00E0MT3SE,"Nine Things about ""The Act of Killing""

1. This is probably the most psychologically complex and mind-boggling documentary Ive ever seen.

2. In 1960s Indonesia, there was a failed military coup. As a result, thugs and small-time gangsters were turned into paramilitary death squads. They roamed the country and killed millions of people who were suspected of being communist. Anwar Congo was the most feared leader of one these death squads.

Filmmaker Joshua Oppenheimer managed to make contact with Anwar, and asked him to recount his memories of that time. As the death squads are openly celebrated as heroes, Anwar eagerly agreed to make this movie.

3. The movie starts out with Anwar and his partner Herman openly boasting about the ways they tortured and killed people. The stories then turn to actual recreations of some of the murders and massacres. Anwar is sometimes glib (like discussing the best clothing to wear when you kill people), and sometimes regretful (such as when he admits that he usually didn't close the eyes of the peoples heads once he cut them off).

4. Besides Anwar and Herman, we meet other people who were involved with the murders. They all have their own ways of dealing with what theyve done. Many of them believe that the key to not be haunted by the ghosts of those they murdered is to never feel guilty.

5. This movie is really two movies in one. While Anwar and the other subjects think they're making a movie glorifying their role in the massacre of over a million people, Oppenheimer is really making the movie about Anwar and the regime that still can't be touched today.

6. In between the recreation of history, we also get a close look at the way Indonesia is run today  the rampant corruption, cynicism, and extortion. People love to explain repeatedly that the word gangster means free man. We come to understand that the death squads are part of an entire horrific pattern in the countrys psyche. This is normal life to them.

7. As Anwar recreates his adventures, he moves from playing himself to playing the victims role. Then he wants to act out the nightmares he has. The torture and murder scenes become increasingly elaborate. You can see him progress from self-important psychopath to trembling human being that questions everything hes done. But he cant apologize for it.

8. In the credits, the name ""Anonymous"" appears almost 50 times, because people working on the movie were afraid the death-squad killers would target them.

9. The movie is long, running almost three hours. Its absurd, nightmarish, horrific, and amusingly surreal. Its an unprecedented look at the psychology of mass murderers and the effects of trauma on those who cause it.",1388361600,13,2707,4.875816993464053
5883038,5,B00E0MT3SE,"I saw a video review where the reviewer said that it wasn't often her jaw dropped at the beginning of a film and stayed that way. I thought she was exaggeration. She wasn't.
I have never seen anything like it. The humanity, how people talk openly about such atrocities when they have no fear of being reprimanded. And than how the basic humanity catches up with them.
Amazing movie.",1388188800,2,382,4.550724637681159
5883039,5,B00E0MT3SE,"It is quite unusual to come across a piece of film making that owes so little to what has gone before, it has to be absolutely unique. This is essentially a documentary about the Indonesian killing squads from the 1960s and what they did, but with them re-enacting their deeds.

The gangsters are all Hollywood movie fans and so Director and visionary Joshua Oppenheimer invites these men to make their own films about what they did. They can use any medium they like. So we have exotic dancers emerging from the mouth of a wooden fish building. Actors parading in front of a waterfall pretending to be in heaven and a re-enactment of a village massacre, to name but three. Plus the obligatory scenes of torture and execution, with some bizarre make up in places. I do not know how he got these men to talk about what they did or to show in such graphic detail.

I often make notes if I am going to write a review, normally only a few sentences, but I wrote two pages on this. The main guy is Anwar Congo who shows us his Hollywood inspired garrotting and dyes his hair especially for the re-enactments. They all talk with disarming frankness about their crimes insisting that they, as gangsters, were always going to be better than communists.

They ignore the contradiction with Islam being into drugs, alcohol, mass murder etc. They still extort the ethnic Chinese and were content to be filmed doing this. They strut around with impunity and some of the scenes they get people to act for them and they all seem to be genuinely terrified, especially the children. One of them keeps dressing up as his women victims in a grotesque parody of what really must have taken place. There is some remorse but to say too little, too late, is obviously not enough. They experience a tiny fraction of what they did to others and claim to be able to empathise, until its pointed out that they know they are not going to be actually tortured to death.

So meet the killers would be a good alternative title, but I was left moved, disturbed and horrified in equal amounts and yet still amazed that this could all be true. An astonishing accomplishment that anyone seriously interested in film should see. It has haunted me since seeing it and I have been telling everyone about it. This ranks in my top five most disturbing films and the others are all fiction, this was sadly real.",1386115200,41,2371,4.55868544600939
8599835,3,B00E0MT3SE,"With a heavyweight such as the inimitable Werner Herzog involved in this documentary, I expected a more compelling piece.
The DC, at an appalling 166 minutes is a pastime only for the heavily medicated, and it entirely unnecessary.",1531526400,,231,5.105263157894737
8599836,5,B00E0MT3SE,"This is one of the most powerful films I have seen.  It goes a long way to show how clueless people can be concerning their actions.  This movie is a documentary of a people making a film about the ""glorious"" slaughter of civilians by murder squads, but goes so much farther than that.  Spoiler alert.  There is a point where the members are re-enacting the killings in a village and having their relatives, including children, serve as the victims.  When their children become terrified - even though it is ""playing"" they are confused in large part because they are disassociated from the reality of what they did.  Do not be worried about blood and as there is very little shown, especially when compared to the American slasher movies.  Think more along the lines of the original ""Psycho"" by Hitchcock where your imagination creates more than you see - except in this case all this really happened.  Spoiler alert.  In the end you will find there may be some slim glimmer of redemption.",1529625600,,989,4.703488372093023

The imagery is visually stunning, and every shot accentuates the feelings and tone of each scene. The way the characters have such enthusiasm to share their story, and act out scenes of the atrocities should be used as a case study in psychology.",1498089600,,399,5.0606060606060606
