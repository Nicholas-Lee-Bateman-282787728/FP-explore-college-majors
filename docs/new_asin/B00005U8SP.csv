1664326,5,B00005U8SP,"Wow! This is a great t.v movie about Judy Garland. It really brings to light the person behind the legend. It shows Miss Garland as a human being, not just a star.
I have been a fan of Judy's for some time and I found that this piece of work really introduced me to her as a person. Judy Davis is fantastic. She sucessfully brings the essence of Garland to herself, which is the job of a great actor, without becoming a grotesque characature.
This film highlights the real talent that was Judy Garland, her energy, humour and drive as a person. It shows her as strong and caring. It removes the all too cliche image of the tragic star and shows the performer and the reality that was her every day life. What a talent!
This is a must have for any Garland fan.
I've just one more thing to say... Why has it taken so long to make this tribute to one of the most remarkable and interesting stars that ever lived..?",1012176000,2,911,4.241379310344827
1664327,5,B00005U8SP,"Being an avid Garland fan for the last 40 years, I always thought that nobody could get close to bringing the personification of the World's Greatest Singer to the TV screen until I saw Judy Davis tackle the job. She was superb. There is only one other person who could have donea similar job, and that is Liza Minnelli, but she always vowed that she would never do it. My only disppointment was with the screenplay, in that they did not spend enough time depicting Judy in the recording studio. Judy, like Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald, agonized over every note they sang with Nelson Riddle and Gordon Jenkins to make sure it was correctly delivered. Judy spent a lot of time perfecting her art. The TV mini-series tended to spend an un-balanced amount of time of her foibles in the bathroom, yet she spent as much time perfecting her art. Yet, with all its minor weaknesses, this DVD of the Judy Davis portrayal of Miss Garland is a marvelous testament to one of the greatest artists of the 20th century.",1012176000,3,1010,4.585635359116022
1664328,5,B00005U8SP,"Judy Davis has brought Judy Garland back where she belongs, in the spotlight. What a fantastic film. One of the greatest actors of out time playing one of the greatest entertainers of the world, what could be better.
This movie brings forth the artistic brilliance of Judy Davis. With her talent in the true meaning of acting..she brings to life the dynamic energy of Judy Garland....that no drag queen could ever capture.
Judy's daughter Lorna Luft is gleaming with the many awards this film has earned. If your not of a fan of either Judy D, or Judy G......just the fine color of authintic acting is a must....for every movie buff.",1011571200,2,633,4.711711711711712
1664329,4,B00005U8SP,"The audio commentary on this DVD release is wonderful.  Director Robert Allen Ackerman, costume designer Dona Granta, director of photography James Chressanthis, and co-executive producer Lorna Luft all come together, watch the entire miniseries and explain many behind the scenes situations scene by scene.  You will have so much more appreciation for the hard work and dedication that went into the making of this miniseries and you will appreciate the artistry of Judy Garland much more after listening to the commentary.
Mr. Ackerman gives one of the best descriptions of Judy Garland --""She didn't feel she WAS Judy Garland, but that she had to BE Judy Garland.""",1011139200,3,667,5.224299065420561
1664330,5,B00005U8SP,"""Life With Judy Garland: Me and My Shadows"" is a movie that has to be seen to be believed. Fans of the revered actress/singer will thrill to the film's spectacular performances, and those new to Garland's story will be moved by and in awe of a woman who, whether on top of the world or scraping to make a comeback, would always known as a legend, and to many, as the world's greatest entertainer.
As a teenager, the young Garland (Tammy Blanchard) is signed by MGM Studios, where she becomes a sensation in the film classic ""The Wizard of Oz"". With stardom comes a bumpy road, in which the nervous Garland is fed a diet of amphetamines to keep her going at a breakneck pace. As an adult, Garland (Judy Davis) is caustic and wry, but optimistic and searching for love. In her late twenties, Garland leaves MGM and, with the help of her manager/husband Sid Luft (Victor Garber), becomes a legendary stage performer. Along the way she is wed five times, and becomes a mother of three. On top of the world again, but now dependent on amphetamines, Garland travels a rocky road that leads to terrific triumphs and emotional disappointments. And through it all, she is supported by Luft and her adored children, who becomes part of the whirling maelstrom of their mother's life. And life with Judy Garland proves to be an extraordinary ride...of love, desperation, and hope.
""Life With Judy Garland"" has many ornaments in a particularly sumptuous and satisfying movie, but its greatest ornaments are undeniably the actresses who play Garland: as the young Garland, Tammy Blanchard (who bears a spooky resemblance to the real Garland) is buoyant, eager to please, an emotional girl looking for happiness. As the adult Garland, Judy Davis is nothing short of a miracle: she BECOMES Judy Garland. Davis captures Garland's wry humor, her infectious charm, her emotional needs, and desire to entertain and be loved so brilliantly that the viewer forgets they're not watching Judy Garland. Davis is extraordinary. Both Davis and Blanchard won Lead Actress and Supporting Actress (Miniseries/Movie) Emmys for their outstanding performances. (The film also won three more Emmys for Costuming, Hairstyling and Makeup, the most for a miniseries this year.)
Garber lends staunch support as the charismatic Luft, Marsha Mason is well cast as Garland's overbearing stage mother, and John Benjamin Hickey is wonderful in his role of Garland's vocal coach and staunch supporter throughout her life. Also, Alison Pill, as Garland's second daughter Lorna Luft (who acts as the story's narrator), is also outstanding.
This film was produced by Ms. Luft, and she and her colleagues produce a powerful, moving tribute to her mother. Garland's real voice is used, and is lip-synched brilliantly by both Davis and Blanchard as some of Garland's classic film scenes and concert appearances are re-created. Blanchard shines as she sings with Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion in tow, ""We're Off to See the Wizard,"" shooting the famous scene from ""Wizard of Oz."" Davis recreates with intensity Garland's ""The Man That Got Away"" from ""A Star is Born"" and is THRILLING as Garland in concert at the Palace and Carnegie Hall. Davis, in tramp costume, sits on the Palace stage, singing to Garland's ""Over the Rainbow"" in one of the film's most moving scenes. These scenes are so realistic they feel like documentary footage (which also lends itself to the extraordinary work of the art decoration and set designers). In fact, the whole film has a voyeuristic, documentary quality about it, which is rather unnerving in several scenes in which a burdened Garland breaks down and takes her frustrations out on people. This is a film that grabs the viewer, and makes them get involved with the drama and heart of the story, feel for the heroine. The film is brilliantly directed by Robert Allan Ackerman, and with a sympathetic but honest script by Robert Freedman, the film is very entertaining, and never skips a beat; you can't take your eyes off it for a second.
""Life with Judy Garland: Me and My Shadows"" is indeed an extraordinary ride. It is a powerful, moving piece of entertainment and a rich, human story that gives the audience a sincere appreciation not only for Garland's talent, but for the life she lived and the legacy she left us. Her story is one that has long needed to be told, and with ""Life With Judy Garland: Me and My Shadows"" comes forth the tribute this shining star has long deserved.",1011052800,6,4468,4.903566710700132
1664331,4,B00005U8SP,"I liked the first hour of the movie.
Tammy Blanchard did a terrific job as Judy. She sounded and looked exactly like her. And in my opinion, she could have portrayed Judy the whole time, with the right make-up of course.
Judy Davis did an okay job. But I think Tammy did better.",1010880000,,278,4.264150943396227
1664332,5,B00005U8SP,"It is without a doubt that one of the best performances by an actress portraying another actress belongs to the magnificent Judy Davis.  Awards have been deservedly given to her for her wrenching and sympathetic glimpse at one of the great entertainers of the 20th century.
Regardless of others' comments about the ""soap opera trimmings"" or Lorna Luft's ""recollections,"" the powerhouse acting of Davis makes up for any discrepancies.
Take me ""over that rainbow"" with you, Miss Davis!",1010188800,5,483,5.1923076923076925
1664333,5,B00005U8SP,"This will be probably what Judy Davis will be remembered for. She captures the exuberence of Garland almost to perfection. She absolutely deserved that Emmy. She worked so hard, you can tell. Also congratulations to Tammy Blanchard, who played the teenage Judy Garland. The ""Oz"" scenes look spooky because she has that little something extra that made her just right for that part. Everyone in the movie is perfectly cast, including both Judy Garlands, Victor Garber (Sid Luft), John Hickey (Roger Edens), Hugh Laurie (Vincente Minnelli), and for some comic relief Sonja Smits (Kay Thompson). This movie is destined to become a classic.",1010188800,5,636,5.184466019417476
1664334,5,B00005U8SP,THis is one of the best movies ever made. Judis Davids plays perfectly Judy Garland. She won the emmy as did tammy for playing the young judy. I was mad and suprized when it lost best miniseries to anne frank which was good but not that great.,1009670400,,243,4.191489361702128
1664335,4,B00005U8SP,"This is a pretty favorable treatment of the life of Judy Garland, at least from the standpoint of the role daughter Lorna Luft played in the context of growing up with a mother who became a legend in her own time. Lorna does, after all, narrate this thing, and as a result, you get the feeling that this is going to place herself and her father, Sid Luft, in the best possible light.
What makes this video worthwhile -- enough worth owning -- is that, flaws and all, it is still by far the BEST overall bio-pic available about Judy Garland. The firestorm of moods is all on display here, particularly with Judy Davis' spectacular (with a capital ""S"") performance covering Judy's post-adolescent years.
The music is incredible, the lip-synching is flawless and the re-creations are bulletproof to criticism. My aggravations associated with the near invisibility of daughter Liza Minnelli in her mother's life (she did tour with her didn't she? Sang with her, didn't she? But there's very little evidence of it here other than the notion that Liza was more career-focused and by implication, more selfish, compared to beloved daughter Lorna) -- were far outweighed by the sheer hypnotic delivery of the songs by both Tammy Blanchard and Judy Davis.
No one had a voice like Judy's, a true original, and thankfully for fans and non-fans alike, there's enough here that is jammed-packed great to make you overlook the ""transitions"" that act as bridges between songs. Certainly, you get the impression that Lorna's father, Sid Luft, was Judy's true love. Whether it was or not, this is Lorna's view, and the magnificent actor Victor Garber certainly makes a dashing and strong case on her behalf playing Mr. Luft.
Without Lorna's participation, this production would not have come to be and certainly the use of Judy's own voice could not be replicated by any other actress, living or dead. Judy Davis' performance is hands down riveting and wonderful.
And I don't want to overlook Tammy Blanchard, who plays ""young Judy"" to perfection. The Wizard of Oz sequences with ""Over the Rainbow"" literally have you, sorry, here comes the obvious, ""over the moon,"" in their seeming authenticity. The magic of these early sequences are so precious that I must admit that when Judy Davis comes into the movie, the effect was jarring for several minutes, so unlike in appearance she is to Judy G. until the story reaches into Garland's ""later years.""
In sum, don't worry about the one-sided treatment and be satisfied about being transfixed listening to a voice for the ages. Never dull or boring, equal parts unsentimental and sentimental, ""Me and My Shadows"" stands as the best epic thus far about the life of Judy Garland. I'm sure Liza would have differed with many of the story elements presented, but there's no doubt she would NOT have quarreled with how ""mama"" is portrayed.",1009324800,39,2864,4.895061728395062
1664336,5,B00005U8SP,"Who did like the Wizard of OZ....but the life of Judy Garland is really interesting and sad. I enjoyed the movie very much, just didn't like how Judy's life turned out.  Help you understand the hard work these actors go through.",1459209600,,228,4.560975609756097

1664342,4,B00005U8SP,"Judy Davis has said that when she took on this role she knew nothing about Judy Garland. Her music, the legendary concerts, films and private life. But whether that extraordinary comment is true or not, she's brilliant in this film. The truth about this turbulent time in Judy Garland's life was probably even more complex than this film, but it's worth seeing for Judy Davis, who's wonderful. She looks amazingly like Garland did at this time too. But while Lorna was bravely holding the fort, where was Liza Minnelli? She was present a great deal of this period, but she's invisible in the film.",1422230400,,597,4.75

1664349,5,B00005U8SP,"Having been a Judy Garland fan for over 30 years, like millions of others I tuned in to this film when it first aired on Labor Day, 2001 on LIFETIME. Having known much about Judy Garland, I certainly learned more seeing this; especially the speech at the very end where the narrator playing Lorna Luft says, ""Mama never saw herself as tragic; she never lost her optimism. If I learned anything from her along the way, it's that every show must go on. And it's up to us to make it a good one."" So those who believe Judy Garland's nothing but a tragic figure, I suggest do yourselves a favor and watch this film. You'll be proven wrong.

Tammy Blanchard (Young Judy) and Judy Davis bring Judy to life . . . and with perfection. Like Judy herself as Dorothy, you'd think they really are the character; not actors portraying her. They both look identical to Judy Garland, they talk the same as her, they act the same as her. The only difference is they don't sing. That naturally is a job for the real Judy Garland. And both actresses are well deserving of their Emmys.

Despite some incorrect dates and of course details in the film (Not unusual for non-fictional stories) this made-for-television movie is one not to be missed. Of all the things written about Judy Garland over the years, this I believe is most thorough. With her own daughter, Lorna Luft producing it, how can you go wrong? If you're a fan, watching this film I don't think will darken your admiration, but strengthen it. Labor Day, 2001 was the perfect day for airing this special. Any day will be perfect to play it on your DVD player.",1407715200,,1603,4.486301369863014
1664350,5,B00005U8SP,"Judy Davis not only resembles the great Garland but she channels her every move, her every vocal intonations and most importantly the depth of the life of a troubled but HUGE star.

1664359,5,B00005U8SP,"I remeber when this came out on tv in 2001, then I completely forgot about it. I loved Judy, just not as much as I would come to in later years. I had been watching some videos of her on Youtube last year, and one of her radio performances really stuck out when she performed ""Dixie Melody."" For some reason that song really did something to me. I know I have an old soul, but I was shocked at how the song affected me emotionally. Maybe it was sort of nostalgic?..maybe it was her voice, and you could hear the passion? I still don't know, but one of the next few video results was the scene from this movie, where she performed ""Dixie Melody"" at The Palace, and I was instantly covered with goosebumps all over my body. Judy Davis is absolutely amazing. I hope she got all the credit she deserved taking on this role. Don't get me wrong, Tammy Blanchard who plays young Judy did a wonderful job, and it's scary how much she really looks like Garland during her young career, but Judy Davis is sublime. So many movies out there telling stories of our diva's of the past, but this movie is one of the best. It's got a great amount of well known actors, and really opens your eyes to the life of the hollywood stars of the past, and what a nightmare it truly was. Let me warn you, you will end this mini-series with a lump in your throat, if you are anything like me. However, you will feel better knowing even with all of her issues, she did her absolute best trying to care for her children, while in constant yearning for the true love of a man, and attempting to entertain millions of people for all her many years in the spot light.

Judy Davis, although at times appearing too old for the role of Judy Garland, is outstanding in capturing Garland's phenomenal essence. Tammy Blanchard is uncannily good as a younger Garland too. In fact, all the actors are wonderful and so is the script, with one of the last scenes of Davis as Garland talking to Lorna Luft on the phone from England bringing all the years of the abuse of drugs to very sad farewell.

The scenes at the great and iconic Carnegie Hall concert are so good that there' smoments when you actually belive it' snot Davis but Judy Garland up there on stage. Davis looks exactly like Garland.

1664378,4,B00005U8SP,"For the first half this is just a pretty good TV bio-pic, not very subtly hitting the high and
low points of Garland's life and career.  But then Judy Davis takes over the role and
gives an amazing if sometimes over the top performance that galvanizes your attention.
She manages to make Judy both a selfish monster and a heartbreaking victim of the system
that created her, often both at the same time.

Victor Garber  nicely underplays to balance out Davis as Luft, Judy's third husband.

(mild spoiler ahead)

However, the film is dragged down by awful voice overs lifted from Lorna Luft's book
about her mother upon which this is based, the worst (and most disastrous) at the very
end, when, in spite of everything the film has told us, we're preached to that Judy's
life wasn't a tragedy, that she knew the show must go on, and that she was an eternal
optimist.  This does nothing except pull out the emotional rug from what we just watched
which was, by very definition a tragedy;  a woman of immense talents hooked on drugs as a
young girl by those around her to keep her going, and then slowly being chewed up by the
entertainment industry.",1343174400,2,1148,4.543689320388349

I had just gotten finished watching the ""Week with Marilyn"" movie, which disappointed me due to all the rave reviews - sat down and started watching this and thought, ""Now, THAT is how you cast a movie about a true star."" Both actresses nailed their parts in both looks and voice.

I have not read the book, nor have I read enough about Judy Garland to know how factual it is - but the feel of the movie and presence of the actresses brought the real Judy to life for me.",1342915200,,490,4.202127659574468
1664380,4,B00005U8SP,"""Life With Judy Garland: Me & My Shadows"" is the highly respected miniseries about famed actress and singer Judy Garland.  It is among the best TV biopics produced, thanks to solid production values, a detailed script and strong performances.  The strongest performance comes from Judy Davis, who is nothing short of remarkable as Judy Garland.  Her vocal mannerisms, appearance, gestures and costumes are all spot on.  Tammy Blanchard is equally impressive as the younger Judy Garland, and both won deserved Emmy awards for their work.  Even though the two actresses look little alike, the transition from one to the other is so smooth you forget within seconds it has occured.

This is the 2nd American DVD release of this film.  The first one, by Miramax, contained the network broadcast version and a handful of solid extras.  This release forgoes the special features but includes the highly coveted extended cut, which contains 18 minutes of scenes re-edited into both parts of the film.  This cut was previously available in North America only on a double VHS set issued by Alliance Atlantis, which was never sold in stores and has long been out of print.  The picture has also been carefully reframed in widescreen.  Contrary to some reports, it is not simply matted.  Comparison with the 4x3 release reveals previously unseen image on either side of the screen in many shots.  Unfortunately, despite these perks that the original disc did not include, this is hardly a definitive release.

The picture, although a new widescreen transfer, is non-anamorphic.  That is, it is not ""enhanced for 16x9 televisions"".  Watching it on a widescreen TV without the use of a zoom feature will result in blackness surrounding the entire image.  Viewing on an older 4x3 television is fine, as it is simply letterboxed, but in 2012 there really is no excuse for non-anamorphic video to still exist, as widescreen televisions have become the new standard.

In addition, all 188 minutes are housed on a single sided, single layered disc.  More than 3 hours of content should definitely call for a dual layered disc, and without it the bitrate suffers.  As a result, the image is not as sharp as that of the previous DVD, despite its newer source.  Echo Bridge is obviously a value home video company, but a film of this caliber really deserves better treatment.

Despite these qualms, the disc is certainly worth it for the low price tag, especially to see the additional scenes.  It makes fine viewing for those with older televisions and is a great compliment to the first DVD if you have it.  Definitely do not get rid of your old disc, but for first timers it's well worth checking out.",1341187200,3,2683,4.884955752212389
1664381,5,B00005U8SP,"In observance of Judy Garland's 90th birthday last week, I watched ""Life with Judy Garland: Me and My Shadows"" (2001). This is actually the second biopic made of Garland's life; the earlier effort was made in 1978 and titled ""Rainbow.""  I think ""Me and My Shadows"" is easily the superior picture, with an overview of Garland's entire life and career, where ""Rainbow"" only covered the years from 1922 through 1939.

This is one of the best biopics about a Hollywood personality that I've seen to date. Oh, it has some of the typical shortcomings of the genre; for instance, in this sort of picture a fair amount of the dialogue has to deliver a lot of exposition, to try and impart as much information as possible to the viewer in a limited amount of running time. This results in conversations that often don't sound entirely natural. And of course there's so much biographical material that has to be left out in a picture that runs just over three hours but attempts to depict an entire life in those few minutes. However, for the most part the events dramatized in the script are fairly accurate. Oh, there are a few bits that aren't true-to-life, but overall this is a decent biography and is far, far more accurate than any number of other biopics I've seen in the past.

The two actresses who play Judy are each excellent in their own way, giving decent impressions of Garland in her earlier and later years. Funny---Blanchard and Davis do not really look alike, but nevertheless they each look like Garland during certain phases of her life. The film only makes one major misstep, and that is the point where the young Blanchard transitions over to the older Davis. This change was made far too early in the picture, when Garland was shooting ""Meet Me in St Louis."" Davis is absolutely not convincing as Garland at this age; she looks far too old and her characterization seemed off as well---too cynical and bitter for ingnue Judy, who after all was only in her early twenties at that time. It would have made much more sense for the transition between actresses to be made when the film reached the year 1950, the year Judy left MGM and was set to begin the concert-performing phase of her career. I do think this is a substantial problem, but on the other hand it didn't diminish my enjoyment of the picture TOO much.

(One other minor pet peeve, which DID annoy me no end! Man, who was responsible for the orange fright wig used in the ""Meet Me in St Louis"" scenes! Holy cow, it's horrible---not even remotely close to the colour of Garland's hair in that picture.)

I suppose the one problem with a picture like this is how can anyone, no matter how skilled, depict a unique talent like Garland? The film at least did not attempt to have the actresses mimic Garland's singing voice---nearly all of the musical numbers on the soundtrack are mimed to recordings of Garland's voice. But more than that, I'm not sure that anyone could accurately portray what made Judy so unique. When reading about the actress one comes across the same statements again and again---she seems to have had a magnetic personality, and everyone who met her was instantly drawn to her. Garland had a personal charisma that was overwhelming, and such a trait is difficult to portray on-screen. Still, overall I'll say this film is an admirable attempt to give an overview of the Judy's life, and I'll happily recommend it for anyone who wants to learn a little about the star, or is interested in glimpses of golden-age Hollywood.

Though I had seen this film when it was first broadcast, it's been quite some time since I last viewed it, and I was happy to watch it again. This new DVD release (it only came out a few weeks ago) runs 18 minutes longer than the previous DVD did, and to the best of my knowledge is the longest cut of this film that exists. This new DVD is also presented in a 1.78:1 aspect ratio to fit modern widescreen televisions, even though the film was shot in standard 35 mm with a 1.33:1 ratio. Now, I thought this would be a problem, because of course this means the top and bottom of the film frame had to be trimmed. However, when viewing the picture at no time did I get the impression that the image was cropped; the composition seemed just fine. This makes me wonder if the film was originally shot in ""open matte"" 35mm, with some extra space left at the top and bottom of the frame for safety. (Before the advent of widescreen television some US television films were intended for theatrical release overseas, and in those cases they were shot open matte. Don't know if this is the case here, but at any rate the picture looks fine.) The only complaint I have about the display is when viewing on a HD set, the DVD picture has a black border on all four sides. You'll need to use the ""zoom"" feature on your TV remote to get the image to fill the screen properly.",1339891200,6,4880,4.5397727272727275

1664383,4,B00005U8SP,"Just in time for the 90th Anniversary of Judy Garland's Birthday (she was born Francis Gumm on June 10, 1922), Echo Bridge has re-released this superior  TV biopic from 2001. It was originally broadcast as a special ""Two Night Event.""  Echo Bridge also divides the movie into two parts. I actually prefer the original DVD release; which was edited as one movie that ran 2 hours, 50 min. The Echo Bridge release runs 188 minutes-- that's 18 additional minutes in two parts. Some may appreciate this, feeling the need for an intermission in Judy Garland's roller-coaster life story. If so, a good intermission is provided around 94 minutes-- the end of Part One. Others have commented the picture quality is terrible; or badly formatted. I had absolutely NO trouble seeing the picture on my old 35 inch screen. It looks fine to me. So I don't know what to say about those who are seeing a bad, or badly formatted,  quality picture.
  Robert L. Freedman's teleplay gives Judy Garland's extraordinary life story the epic treatment she deserves. Robert Allen Ackerman's direction is solid throughout.  Tammy Blanchard (young Judy) and Judy Davis (adult Judy) give mesmerizing, deservedly award-winning performances. The only real mistake the biopic makes is switching the two actresses much too soon. Blanchard plays Judy from 1935-1943. Davis takes over from 1944 (when Garland made ""Meet Me In St. Louis"") until her death in 1969. Blanchard should have played Judy through 1949-1950, with Davis taking over the role after Judy left MGM. Blanchard/Davis offer a clear, well-rounded, extremely compassionate portrayal of Judy; the most talented entertainer of the 20th Century, who struggled with countless personal and psychological demons away from the spotlight. Between MGM executives constantly telling Judy she is too fat and forcing a crazy cocktail of pills on her, and her much less than loving or caring stage mother Ethel Gumm, (a  strong supporting performance by Marsha Mason), it's easy to understand how Judy developed an inferiority complex and ended up an emotional mess. In one excellent scene, a psychiatrist asks her to tell him about Francis Gumm. An all too aware Judy instantly replies, ""Nobody liked her. She was that fat girl. We had to get rid of her. Judy Garland stole Francis Gumm's voice."" It's easy to see and understand how the young, eager to please Judy, played by Blanchard, evolved into the vulnerable, volatile, high-strung, needy, diva, adult Judy, played by Davis.
  The production values are excellent; far above the typical TV biopic. Both Blanchard and Davis lipsinc perfectly to several of Judy's classic recordings. Scenes from Judy's most popular films (""The Wizard Of Oz"", ""Meet Me In St. Louis"" and ""A Star Is Born"")  and her career apex at Carnegie Hall in 1961  are lovingly re-created. John Benjamin Hickey gives an excellent performance as Roger Edens, Judy's musical mentor and constant champion. Tellingly, Edens, who truly valued her as a person and performer, is the only person who repeatedly calls Judy by her real name of Francis.
  Trouble is, those additional 18 minutes don't add much to  Judy's saga. The cut scenes seemed to be cut for good reason. The one cut scene that is valuable has Vincente Minnelli (Hugh Laurie) trying to calm an overwrought Judy down in her dressing room during ""Meet Me In St. Louis."" This is later contrasted with another dressing room drama, during the difficult filming of ""The Pirate"" in 1947, when Vincente is no longer able to help Judy, deep in drug-addicted paranoia, at all.
  Here is a run-down of the additional scenes:
1. Short scene with Judy (Tammy Blanchard) writing poetry in her bedroom in 1940-- after a date with Artie Shaw.
2. Short scene with Judy (Judy Davis) and Roger Edens. Judy does not want to make ""Meet Me In St. Louis""
3. Extended Scene: Vincente Minnelli calms Judy down in her dressing room.
4. Short Scene: Vincente talks with doctor about Judy's drug addiction and his worries for her.
5. Sid Luft (Victor Garber) talks with doctor about Judy's drug addiction and how it will affect her pregnancy with daughter Lorna Luft.
6. Judy, ill and without medication, forgets her lyrics during a concert in Australia. Audience members leave, yelling at her and berating her.  Judy runs offstage, a complete mess.
7. Lorna  (Allison Pill)  and housekeeper Lottie witness domestic violence between Judy and Mark Herron (Judy's fourth husband, but seemingly depicted here as a boyfriend). Judy's face has blood all over it. Mark screams and leaves. Lottie helps Judy; telling Lorna to leave quickly and make sure her brother Joe does not see this. Lorna stays behind to clean up a bloody mess on the carpet.

 I recommend this biopic. The 188 minute Echo Bridge release is fine; but I think the earlier 170 minutes DVD is better. It is presented as one whole movie (not in two parts). The earlier DVD release (Miramax) also includes a Making of Featurette, and Audio Commentary from Lorna Luft and others involved with the movie's production that is NOT included here.",1338940800,19,5076,4.9834319526627215

1664390,4,B00005U8SP,"Me and My Shadows: Life with Judy Garland was the way for Garland's daughter Lorna Luft to tell her mother's compelling life story. Many say she was the greatest entertainer who ever lived and that could well be the case. Nobody gave as much as Judy Garland did. Judy was one of a very rare kind: she could sing better than anyone I've ever heard and she could act better than anyone I've ever seen act--and that was on a bad day! She danced wonderfully, too, in the numerous movies she made. She danced onstage during many of her live concerts, too, much to the sheer delight and awe of her devoted audiences. Moreover, when Judy Garland was in a movie, it didn't matter who she danced with or with whom she was talking in any particular scene, your eyes were always on her. This biopic, done with great care and no doubt at least partially supervised by Lorna Luft, captures Garland's ups and downs incredibly well.

Look for exceptional performances by just about everyone in this film. Not everyone looked exactly like the people they played but Tammy Blanchard DID look a great deal like Judy, especially the very first time we see her walking on the yellow brick road on the set of ""The Wizard of Oz."" Judy Davis gives a stunning, electrifying performance as Judy Garland in her post-adolescent years. Alison Pill is just great as young Lorna Luft and Ellis Turner, Harrison Kane and Alex House play Joe Luft, Judy's only son, very well at three different ages. Dwayne Adams also plays a teenage Mickey Rooney to perfection. Victor Garber looks a bit like Sid Luft but from there on in the convincing acting makes up for the fact that the actors don't always look too much like the people they portray.

Other reviewers have noted that there are several inaccurate details scattered here and there throughout the film--and they are right. For example, when Judy loses the Oscar for Best Actress in A Star Is Born, her then-husband Sidney Luft (Victor Garber) says ""That's the greatest robbery since Brinks."" Actually, that was something Groucho Marx stated to tell Judy how sorry and angry he was that she didn't win the award. If I have any other gripe with this DVD release it would be that it is missing a few scenes that were originally released when this came out as a two VHS tape set which is now unavailable. However, don't be too disappointed: the movie as it exists is rather faithful to Garland's real life and times even as it stands.

The cinematography and the choreography couldn't have been better. In addition, the DVD comes with extras. There is a commentary by Lorna Luft; a ""behind the scenes"" featurette; and another featurette entitled ""I Play the Palace."" Terrific!

Overall, this movie is a must-have for Garland fans although as others have said they will probably notice a few inaccurate details along the way and they will be annoyed that a few minutes were deleted from the original version sold as a two VHS tape set. Nevertheless, this is an especially good place to start for people just discovering the singular artistry of Judy Garland; and anyone studying the truly few and very rare major ""superstars"" of Hollywood will want this for their collections.",1256256000,,3193,4.706618962432916
1664391,4,B00005U8SP,"2009  marks the 40th Anniversary of Judy Garland's death; on June 22, 1969. It is hard to believe she has been ""gone"" so long. She always seems so near and ""present"" to me. Death, of course, never destroys a spirit and talent as singularly special as Judy. As one of the biggest Judy Garland fans in the world, (trust me, Judy is in every corner of my apartment; and on my computer), I was very skeptical when this TV biopic first aired in 2001. How could any biopic, or any other actress, hope to capture the essence, the incandescence, the charisma, the magic, the talent, and the often heartbreaking humanity of Judy Garland??-- who has quite correctly been called ""The World's Greatest Entertainer."" To my delight and surprise, this TV biopic passed the test of my critical nature. Watching it again earlier this week, I was, once again, simply stunned. The movie falls just short of being miraculous.
  Robert L. Freedman's teleplay gives Judy Garland's extraordinary story the epic treatment she richly deserves; although it  does, quite understandably, tone down aspects of her life for a PG TV movie. Robert Allan Ackerman's direction is remarkably solid. Of course, the story is fascinating and absorbing-- so absorbing, in fact, that one barely notices the film runs 2 hours and 50 minutes. Judy Garland led a turbulent, roller coaster existence. By the end of the movie, the audience is likely to feel we have taken the roller coaster ride right along with her.
  What makes the movie work, though, and makes it a superior biopic, are the extraordinary performances of Emmy winning actresses Tammy Blanchard and Judy Davis. Judy Garland was so singularly special and extraordinary, it's no surprise that two extraordinary actresses were required to portray her. Both Blanchard and Davis go far beyond all the myths and legends. This is not Judy Garland, the gay icon-- or Judy Garland, the tragic diva (although there's more than enough tragedy to go around here). Both Blanchard and Davis portray Judy Garland as a human being. God knows how many psychological/emotional demons Judy Garland wrestled with during her lifetime, but the movie makes all of her struggles understandable and relatable  on a basic, human level. With Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer executives constantly telling Judy she is fat and forcing pills on her, it's no wonder she had an inferiority complex and was an emotional mess. It's easy to see how the insecure, earger to please,  young Judy portrayed by Tammy Blanchard evolved into the tortured, vulnerable, and volitile adult Judy portrayed by Judy Davis. I do wish, however, that Tammy Blanchard had still played Judy in the scene recreating ""The Trolley Song"" from 1944's ""Meet Me In St. Louis,"" but this is only a minor quibble.  There are also excellent supporting performances from John Benjamin Hickey as Roger Edens, Judy's constant champion and musical mentor, and Marsha Mason as Ethel Gumm, Judy's mother. Ethel was, apparently, a driven ""stage mother,"" whom Judy hated. Judy adored Frank Gumm, her loving  father who died much too soon. The Gumm family dynamics led to another central life conflict: The real life Frances Gumm always lurked behind, in the shadows of Judy Garland, who was ""created."" In one of the best scenes, a psychiatrist says, ""Tell me about Frances Gumm."" Judy instantly respondes, ""She was a little fat girl. Nobody liked her. We had to get rid of her. Judy Garland stole Frances Gumm's voice.""
  The production design is superb.  The recreations of scenes from Judy's most beloved films, ""The Wizard Of Oz,"" ""Meet Me In St. Louis,"" and ""A Star Is Born"", are excellent. The scenes depicting Judy's triumphant Carnegie Hall concert in 1961 are electrifying. The film only falters in the final hour, when it ceases to be about Judy Garland and becomes, in effect, all about Lorna Luft  (Allison Pill) taking care of the increasingly fragil, frail, drug-dependent Judy. This is understandable, seeing as the film is based on Lorna's ""family memoir."" Interestingly, Sid Luft did not want Lorna to publish the memoir or this movie to be made. Since  much of the last half of the movie depicts Sid's (Victor Garber) domestic battles with Judy, and their bitter custody battle  over children Lorna and Joe, he can hardly be faulted or blamed for his feelings. Since the memoir and the movie are from Lorna's perspective, it is dramatically unbalanced. Brother Joe and superstar half-sister Liza Minnelli, for instance, are largely left in the shadows in the movie. Judy's second husband, the gentlemanly Vincente Minnelli (""House's Hugh Laurie) is depicted as rather cold and indifferent. On the other hand, Sid Luft (husband number three and Lorna's father) comes off, for the most part, as Judy's knight in shining armour. In truth, Judy and Sid were a  much more tempestuous couple who probably couldn't live with or without each other. But these criticisms are minor. The film is extremely worthwhile; the  overall quality of the production being so far above the standard show-business biopic.",1243468800,,5055,5.026315789473684
1664392,5,B00005U8SP,"Ever since Judy Garland died in 1969 Hollywood has been extremely slow in developing a movie based on her life. In 1998 Judy's youngest daughter, Lorna Luft, wrote a mesmerizing and well-written memoir on her famous mother called ""Me and My Shadows"", and it immediately became a best seller. It was only natural that a film based on that book would come to pass. The miniseries ""Life With Judy Garland-Me and My Shadows"" aired on ABC as a two-parter, and gained huge ratings. People knew about Lorna's book, and it was obvious people still loved Judy Garland. The telefilm would receive five Emmy awards, including two for the actresses who played Judy at different stages in her life: both Tammy Blanchard (the young Judy) and Judy Davis (the older Judy) would both win acting Emmys for their portrayal. The film is excellent, with a superb script, and the life of one of Hollywood's most beloved screen icons and singers is well documented. Judy's destructive descent into alcohol and prescription pill addiction is thoroughly explored, and it is well dramatized that these addictions are what eventually destroyed her. The DVD comes with audio commentary by Lorna Luft and director Robert Ackerman, and there is a behind the scenes featurette. The New York Times calls the movie ""Dazzling"", and the National Post says, ""Judy Davis delivers a majestic and memorable performance"".

It tells the story of her triumphant and often unhappy life as straight and honestly as any movie possibly can, never letting us forget how brilliantly talented and troubled she was. There is an affection for Ms. Garland that permeates every frame of this film and infects its audience no matter how many times one sees it. Watching the brilliant performances of Tammy Blanchard and Judy Davis actually allows the audience to experience the greatness of Garland. I think this is a remarkable achievement. So that if you never saw Judy Garland perform, watching this movie, you can actually walk away from it a Garland fan. Much has been written about the faithful recreations of the movie musical sequences but little has been said about how they serve the film in a totally and unique way. In their original context of course they served to advance the story of the movies they were written for but here, the director has not only recreated them but he has reinvented them to serve the story he is telling of Garland's life. So that the TROLLEY SONG becomes the musical moment in which we see Vincente Minelli and Judy falling in love. THE MAN THAT GOT AWAY becomes Judy's lament for her dead mother. The Carnegie Hall sequence tells of Judy's rise from the ashes of a failing career. In this sense the director has actually invented a new and totally original form of musical film. The movie has won many accolades and has a great many admirers all over the world. Well deserved! A true work of art. Television never had it so good.",1221264000,2,1920,4.65

1664404,5,B00005U8SP,"For picky hardcore Garland fans who are looking for a movie that strictly sticks to the facts, presents them in the exact order that they happened, and doesn't deviate from the truth one iota, well...you'll have a field day pointing out the errors in ""Me and My Shadows"" (although I would say the movie does a somewhat better job of being factual than the book; apparently there were a few who ""overrode"" the filtered memories of Lorna Luft). If you can enjoy this movie as entertainment that gets the spirit of the situation right and nails the characterizations down perfectly, then you will enjoy this film immensely. MY one fault with the movie is the switch between the two roles. I think both actresses did an amazing job of portraying Judy Garland (at times, it is eerie to watch Tammy Blanchard without thinking that it's not Judy, as she nails the look, mannerisms, and emotions of Garland), but I do question switching the roles at the point of ""Meet Me In St. Louis."" Blanchard could have carried the role up until the point of Garland leaving MGM, and I believe that the change would not have been so jarring. It's just difficult to see the youthful Blanchard performing ""I've Got Rhythm"" from 1943's ""Girl Crazy"" and then seeing Davis step in doing ""The Trolley Song"" supposedly one year later. Besides the age problem, Davis' portrayal is more of the manic Garland that we expect in the 1960's, a Garland that had not emerged as of 1944. Other than that, the film manages to display the amazing sense of humor that Garland possessed, and how she used that to overcome the challenges she face with her career, her husbands, and her financial problems. Hugh Laurie does a nice job of playing Minnelli, without becoming a gross characterization or parody of the real man. Kudos also go to Marsha Mason as Ethel Gumm and John Benjamin Hickey as Roger Edens. Both forces show how they alternately tore down and bolstered up Judy's self-esteem. Victor Garber struggles to play tough-guy Luft, and is probably the weakest link in the cast. The costumes and settings also do an incredible job of nailing the period...again, you will be amazed at how closely they replicate the originals. The extras are nice; one deleted number of Davis lip-synching another live number by Garland, a making-of-featurette, and a commentary track by Lorna Luft and others involved in the movie (who are not shy about correcting Lorna's factual errors). If you are looking for even one frame of Judy Garland in the extras, it is not here. Nowhere do you see the image of the real Judy Garland. Everything is strictly to do with this photoplay. For the DVD, the sound and picture are transferred nicely as well; with the exception of a few short numbers that are incorporated into the dialogue without accompaniment, all the musical sets are from the original Garland recordings (unfortunately at times the lip-synching leaves a bit to be desired).",1192320000,2,2934,4.800395256916996

Tammy Blanchard, who prior to this had been on ""Guiding Light"", was truly amazing as the younger Judy. And there simply is not enough superlatives or adjectives in the dictionary to describe the fabulous Judy Davis and what she did with the role as ""adult"" Judy.

I would give this, on a larger scale, a 90 or 95 out of 100. The movie has ONE glaring mistake in it, and that is that Davis assumes the role of Garland too soon in the movie. Davis is a stunningly beautiful woman and looks absolutely fantastic, but she is unconvincing as a girl of 21.

Another scene is when she finds out her current boyfriend is having an affair with another man. He walks out of the room half-naked as Lorna and the housekeeper rush to help her take care of the bloody gash on her head. Another scene is when she is about to go on stage for a concert in Australia, and she is too disoriented to perform thus getting booed off the stage.

I have read the book upon which this movie is based and found it very difficult to put down.  It is well written, straight from the heart and told from a view point which couldn't have been done any better than by Lorna Luft herself.  Judy Davis does Judy Garland's memory nothing but honor in her portrayal of this vocal legend.  The book and movie allows us to learn who Francis Ethel Gumm (aka Judy Garland) really was from the time she took her first steps on a stage at 2 years old, through her rise and demise as one of MGM's brightest stars through her uncomparable performance at Carnegie Hall to her untimely death.  One may learn the pros and cons of life in show business while also seeing how crucial parental guidance and welfare for a child in this industry is.  We are reminded of the great joy and entertainment Judy Garland brought to many lives and despite it all her determination to endure and go on even in the face of much physical and mental adversity.

1664411,4,B00005U8SP,"In a review (basically favorable) I posted recently of the film HILARY AND JACKIE, I made the observation that film-bio's are, by definitiion, problematic.  Every bit of cinematic license one takes with the story is going to be picked up by SOMEONE somewhere who will be quick to denounce said film as little more than a pack of lies.  Or at least, if they're feeling generous, a jumble of truths and fictions.

Perusing some of the reviews below, I see that more avid fans of Judy Garland than I take exception to some of this film's representation's about the life and times of this hugely talented performer.  Overall, however, it seems to be a more accurate film biography than many others I've seen (including the above cited HILARY & JACKIE).  Like many casual fans, I am aware of the outlines of Ms. Garland's life and career, and the film, and by and large, the film adheres to those outlines.

Contributor Gary Taylor cites the scene where Judy's body is discovered by her last husband Mickey Deans as an example of the kind of innacuracies and distortions he finds disturbing.  In reality, he reminds us, Deans didn't just walk into the bathroom to find Judy dead on the floor; he actually had to crawl out on the roof and through the window.

That's an interesting tid-bit and I thank Gary for it, since I certainly was not aware of that fact.  And you know, it's just dramatic a true life event to make you wonder why the filmmakers did NOT incorporate it into the film.  Wouldn't that have made a real corker of a scene?  Well, maybe, but here's my take on it.  Britisher Mickey Deans was married to Judy Garland only for a matter of weeks.  Her family back in the States had never even met the man.  The filmmakers (correctly, I think) did not attempt to flesh out Mr. Deans as a character or as a presence in Ms. Garland's life.  Giving him a big dramatic moment when his character has never been established would likely have seemed a bit odd, dramatically speaking.

(It probably does not need to be reiterated once again that this film is based on a memoir by daughter-from-Judy's-second-marriage Lorna Luft, who does serve as narrator in the everpresent voiceover. For that reason alone the lack of emphasis on Judy's later marriages makes sound narrative sense.  There also seems to be little reason to believe that neither her last marriage to Deans or the previous short lived liaison with Mark Herron were anywhere near as significant to Garland herself as either her first marriage to Vincente Minelli or her second to Sid Luft).

So I personally have little argument with the minor liberties this film takes with the facts of Judy Garland's life.  And like many others who have posted reviews of the film, I have nothing but kudos for both actresses who portrayed Garland at different stages of her life and career.  Judy Davis is just riveting as the older Judy.  And Tammy Blanchard is a wonder as the adolescent star.  Both certainly deserved the Emmys they won for their work on this film.  Probably the only argument one could make regarding thecasting would be whether or not Blanchard should have been aged ""up"" a little to play Garland in her 20s rather than having Davis age ""down"" to take on those scenes.  But then, 50-50 screen time for both actresses would likely have meant that neither of them would have walked away with an Emmy in either the ""lead"" or ""supporting"" categories.",1154131200,3,3418,4.667779632721202

It must have been beyond magical.

All around wonderful cast, powerful performances, and accurate story-telling, all about a woman who's life was one of the greatest dramas. Thankfully, the film doesn't treat her as a cold and unapproachable star. Here she is Frances Gumm trying desperately to embody Judy Garland, unforgiving in her demand for perfection.

Not so with this incredible Television film. ""My Life With Judy Garland - Me And My Shadows"" is simply superb on all levels.

  The attention to detail in recreating the many settings and eras of Judy Garland's life at M.G.M. and on the concert stage is wonderful.  The cast of supporting players is perfect, especially Marsha Mason as Judy's mother.

  But special kudos must go to Tammy Blanchard who plays the young Judy and to the incandescently incredible Judy Davis.  Both performances are more than impersonations, each actress makes you forget performance and believe their magical recreations of Judy Garland.

  But of the two Emmy awarded performances the most spectacular comes from Davis. She is uncanny in her choices and a revelation in her becoming the character. Most touching is the recreation of the ""Star is Born"" speech about Norman Main. This is an artist at work recreating the harrowing life of a legend. It is a full-blown portrait that covers the range of Garlands talent, humor and despair and great capacity for hurt and love. In scene after scene she is pure magic.

  Special note on this DVD are the few extras that are not to be missed as well as a wonderful commentary track my Lorna Luft, director Robert Ackerman and costumer Donna Granada. Much thanks to must go to Lorna Luft for bringing this wonderful work to light.",1104278400,5,1524,4.8076923076923075
1664420,5,B00005U8SP,"Me and My Shadows: Life with Judy Garland was a fascinating look at the life of Judy Garland from her daughter Lorna Luft's perspective.

The movie starts off when little Frances Gumm (Judy's real name) singing in her parents theater in Minnesota and ends with her death forty-five years later in England.

During that time there are highs (the birth of her children Liza, Lorna, and Joey; some incredible movies) and some lows (drugs, divorce, no money, going from hotel to hotel) but through it all she still retained her love for her children, and her humor.

This movie was absolutely great. I was not a Judy Garland fan before this, but after watching the movie and reading Lorna Luft's book I became one. Judy Davis did a superb job as the older Judy and Victor Garber was phenomenal as third husband Sid Luft ( father of Lorna and Joey)",1103328000,2,843,4.6066666666666665
1664421,2,B00005U8SP,"The telepic bio ""Life with Judy Garland - Me and My Shadows"" at least looks expensive and contains a thoughtful and intelligent performance by Judy Davis.  However, if you really want the essence of Garland, watch her films and boxed sets of her 1963-1964 television show as well as her 1962 special with Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin.  The lushly-mounted TV bio, based on ""other daughter"" Lorna Luft's book of the same name doesn't quite cut it as far as telling Judy's whole story, because there are plenty of things you can't tell on TV these days for fear of big fines.  The boldest thing ""M & MS"" depicts is that yes, Judy's father was gay (this is demonstrated in a very brief male-to-male hand-holding shot), and yes, Judy did have a gay affair with vocal stylist Kay Thompson (Judy holds Kay's hand and says ""I don't know what I would have done without you.""), and it is worth noting that Lorna Luft, given producer's credit, vehemently protested such assertions in her book.  There is also the strong suggestion in the teleplay that Liza's dad Vincente Minnelli, arguably the golden years' greatest director of film musicals, was gay.  Lorna denies this in her book, which is like denying Bullwinkel is a moose.  All in all, to get the essence of Garland, one needs to read the grittier bios of her life, and there are many.  Couple that with her films, TV shows and records, and you'll get a good idea of who Judy was and why she is still a hot topic of conversation over 30 years after her death.  Lorna either doesn't know much about her mother or, more probably, prefers to hold certain things back.  One particular example says it all: Lorna's television version shows Judy found dead on the bathroom floor.  Sad to say, it is a matter of public record that Judy, like fellow icon Elvis, died on the toilet.  How do you portray that on ABC-Disney?  One day the whole tale might be told, but more likely on the big screen.

The performances here are top notch.  I've noticed that Judy Davis has received many negative reviews here.  I am not one of those.  Truthfully .... no one can capture the true essence of Judy but I think Judy Davis did an outstanding job!  They could have done better with the make-up.....especially during Judy's last years.....Davis looks too healthy when in truth, Judy was emaciated and her body had broken down.....

Tammy Blanchard, as the young Judy is the one who gets the real kudos here......uncanny.....and she definitely captured the young Judy......

Davis' and Blanchard's lip synching to Garlands music is done superbly and the film is top notch in every quality.  The young man who played Mickey Rooney was great too!!

The man who played Vincente Minnelli looked to be on auto-pilot...completely wooden.  Victor Garber as Sid Luft was fine.

Marsha Mason looked like Ethel Gumm and it is understandable why Judy always said her life was ruined by her mother.  Mason is great!

This movie is exceptional and shows why Judy, little Girl Lost, God Bless Her will always hold a special place in the heart of America.  She is an American Institution.

I thought there were times during the movie that she was more a charicature of Judy  instead of portraying a real living person. She wasn't bad at all, I just think she is over-rated. She does have some very good moments though such as when she finds out her father had died and the scene with Lana Turner.
True Judy Davis looks less like Garland than Tammy, but I think she seemed much more ""Judy-Like"". From what I have seen of Judy Garland interviews and read (I wrote a 20 page paper on her life), she seems to capture Garland's esscence well.
Despite being a fan of Judy Davis's performance, I do agree with most that she should have been brought in later than for Meet Me In St. Louis.
One person complained about the ""jaw shaking"" Judy is shown doing. This actually happens with some singers when singing correctly for effect. I don't know if Judy did though.

1664424,2,B00005U8SP,"When ""Me and My Shadows"" was first broadcast, it was broadcast the week of my first quarter-century as a Judy Garland fan and serious collector.  I had taken issue with the book and how Lorna Luft had such specific and almost mundane memories of unfortunate events in Judy Garland's life, but glossed over Judy's humor, her grace, and her courage, and worse yet, implied that Garland's last two years were basically a burn-out.  Judy completed 120 concerts in her last two years.  Her 1967 tour saw 80 concerts performed with only three cancellations.  What angered me the most was the error that Luft made when stating that Garland had canceled her entire 12/67 run at Caesar's Palace when Burt Lahr (""Oz's"" Cowardly Lion) passed away.  This is untrue.  Recordings and photographs exist of Judy's engagement.  She did cancel one show when she found out about Lahr, but was back the next night and dedicated ""Over the Rainbow"" to him.  I won't go on to the other 191 factual errors about Garland in Luft's book.
In the film, Tammy Blanchard does an admirable job as young Judy, and her performance is the only thing that made me choose a two star rating instead of one. Her skill at interpreting Judy's gawky adolescence, burgeoning style and mannerisms is uncanny.
Judy Davis arrives like a plane crash, and shrieks and whines her way through the remainder of the film (incongruously entering the film at the time Garland was about 22 and Davis in her 40's).  Garland's humor and genius and survival instincts are lost in the need to push the Judy Garland story through the mind set, prejudices, bitterness and self-aggrandizing filters of those who have gone through recovery from substance abuse.
Sid Luft and the Group V corporation he formed with two ""associates"" (both with prison records), was responsible for bleeding Judy of considerable monies in 1967-68, and Luft eventually sold Judy's contract for ONE DOLLAR to another group of similarly shady-credentialed individuals.
Judy's ability to, in her words, ""rise above"" her situations isn't even alluded to.  As far as Luft is concerned, Garland was too trusting and not discerning and the loss of money was due to these faults.
As a result, the casual viewer thinks, because of the quality of the wardrobe and the attention to visual detail, that this is the true story of Judy Garland.  What is sad is that this depiction of Judy's life, by someone who was only part of that life for 16 years, is as one-dimensional as a pencil line.  If the essence of Garland and her uncanny abilities had received as much attention as the costumes, this might indeed be a significant film.",1082246400,11,2637,4.835555555555556
1664425,5,B00005U8SP,"I adored this movie, just as i adored the book. Some of you have been saying that key scenes were left out of the VHS version, and i find this very dissapointing. i never watched the mini-series when it was on tv (i forgot it was on), so i'm annoyed i didn't see the movie in it's entirety. I also found that Judy Davis looked way to old to play Judy in the Meet Me In St Louis scenes, perhaps Tammy Blanchard could have done these?
Those are the only critcisims i have of this movie, though. I think it deserved every award it got, and the performances of both Judy Davis and Tammy Blanchard were amazing. i liked how excerpts of Lorna's book were voiced-over (read by Cynitha Gibb, not Lorna Luft as was orginally thought) throughout the movie, so the audience didn't get lost in what was happening, particularly when they skipped years, which it did alot, which made the overall effect somewhat choppy. i'm surprised Alison Pill (who played teenage Lorna) didn't get nominated or win an award for her performance, i thought she did extremely well, especially in the hospital scene talking to her mom.

1664428,4,B00005U8SP,"Arguably the single greatest talent to emerge from golden-era Hollywood, Judy Garland continues to fascinate us even more than four decades after her untimely death.  As a singer, she was incomparable; as an actress, she was exceptional; as a star, she was perhaps the most brilliant celebrity of her generation.  But behind the brillance there was a deeply troubled woman who began her career as a child in the hands of a driven mother and an all-powerful studio, who raced through five husbands, who fought a losing battle with chemical dependency throughout most of her life, and who self-destructed time and time again--only to arise, phoenix-like, from her own ashes over and over again.  It was an extraordinary life.

So it should come as no surprise, really, that this three-hour television falls a bit short.  Realistically, it would take a talent of Garland's own scope to bring her fully to the screen.  But what the film does right, it does extremely, extremely well--and the centerpieces of the film are the remarkable performances of Tammy Blanchard and Judy Davis.  Both give extraordinary performances.  That said, however, both performances are flawed due to the age of the actresses.  Blanchard, who plays the teenage Garland, is clearly too old to be thirteen-ish when the film begins; Davis, who plays Garland from her twenties until her death, is clearly too old to be Garland in her twenties.

But so exceptional are the performances that these are actually minor quibbles.  When made up for the role and placed in period attire, both Blanchard and Davis have the look to an absolutely uncanny degree.  More importantly, they match each other in their skill at playing Garland, who was one of the most uniquely idioscyratic personalities of her era--indeed, Davis has been described by many as having ""channeled"" Garland, and I certainly wouldn't disagree.  And the supporting cast is quite good as well, ranging from above average to extremely good, something of a surprise in a made-for-television movie.  Equally impressive is the painstaking recreation of the world in which Garland moved; her wardrobe, both on stage and off, has been meticulously recreated right down to the hat she wore for her wedding to Vincent Minnelli.  Be it sets, costumes, or props, the design staff did a truly miraculous job.

But the film falls down in both script and detail.  Part of this is due to fact that Lorna Luft's memoir was, naturally enough, based on what her mother told her about her life.  Doubtlessly Luft accepted much of this as fact, but Garland was notorious for twisting the truth if it would make a good story--and consequently the film includes several depictions of events that by all other accounts didn't happen that way, assuming they happened at all.

When filming THE WIZARD OF OZ, SHADOWS shows Garland being crowded out of the shot by her co-stars, prompting director Victor Flemming to say ""You three dirty hams, let that little girl in there!""  It was one of Garland's favorite party stories--but it didn't happen.  Garland was well known for her ability to perform complex musical numbers with little rehearsal in a single take, and SHADOWS offers her performance of ""The Trolley Song"" in MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS as an example of her ability to do that--but while she certainly could and often did perform her numbers in a single flawless take, she didn't do it for that particular number.  In fact, she mis-mouthed her own vocal play-back during filming, and later had to re-record the vocal as a result.  Perhaps the most obvious gaffe in the film is when Garland is found dead in the bathroom of her London apartment; SHADOWS shows her husband going to the bathroom door and seeing her sprawled out on the floor, clearly dead.  In reality, the door was locked and he had to climb out on the roof to look in the window--and from her appearance he was unsure of her condition until he actually got into the room.

That aside, the script does a superior job of showing Garland's racy, acid, and often self-mocking sense of humor and her often-hidden powerful sexuality.  It also does a fairly good job of displaying her love-hate relationship with her own talent.  But it is extremely spotty, skipping over major events and focusing on considerably more trivial incidents.  (Garland's first husband, David Rose, is never seen in the film--and indeed, scarcely mentioned at all.)  It lacks flow.  And were it not for the incredible performances of both Blanchard and Davis, it would often also lack drama--a pretty astonishing thing when one considers how electrically dramatic Garland's life was from day to day.  Perhaps most frustrating, the film also has a certain aloofness from its own subject; we observe Garland, but the script itself never really allows us to get inside her.

In the final analysis, ME AND MY SHADOWS is a film that will most greatly appeal to casual viewers or to new Garland fans, for it does show the main outlines of her life and her career.  Hardcore fans, however, will be frustrated by its covert inadequacies--and will be quick to spot the numerous moments when the script goes awry.  Still, even with its numerous flaws, Blanchard and Davis are exceptional.  And I strongly recommend it on that basis.

1664429,5,B00005U8SP,"This, the second of 2 tv movies based on Judy's life(Rainbow being the first), definitely shines.  Judy Garland is not the eaisestn of roles to play due to the complexities of her persona and talent.  Judy Davis and Tammy Blanchard richly deserve their Emmies for their portrayal of Judy Garland.  They manage to capture her essence like no one else has.  True, the movie was filled with historical inaccuracies, but that can be forgiven, for the fact that this movie manages to portray Judy as she really was.  A definite must have for all Judy fans and a great primer for those just starting out in learning about her.",1036972800,3,620,4.651376146788991
1664430,3,B00005U8SP,"Judy Garland's tragic story is a textbook example of what happens if addiction is inadequately treated.  Of course, in her day little was known about how addiction works and how to deal with it.  Perhaps today she might have had a fighting chance.  As it was, it was as if she was doomed from the moment she was handed her first dose of pills.
This film whitewashes Lorna Luft's book, on which it was based.  I only skimmed through the book, but that was enough to tell me that many incidents described in the book were glossed over in the film, and others -- the worst being a horrifying incident involving Lorna Luft's brother Joey -- were omitted entirely.  This is odd, since if Lorna Luft wasn't afraid to include these incidents in her book, why did she, as a producer, leave them out of the film?  The film also doesn't reveal the fact that Joey suffers from some degree of mental disability due to his mother's drug and alcohol use during pregnancy.
The person I sympathize with the most is not Judy Garland, however; it is her third husband, Sid Luft.  As played by Victor Garber, he seems too smart to get involved with someone like her, but maybe Garber is merely a little miscast (even so, his performance earned him an Emmy nomination).  More than once while watching the scenes following their marriage, I wondered why he didn't just haul off and break her scrawny little neck.  Loving Judy Garland was not exactly a rewarding experience.
It is understandable that Lorna Luft would want to take a forgiving look at her mother's life, but somehow I ended up disliking Judy Garland, not understanding her.  Maybe my reaction is a credit to Judy Davis's incredible performance as Judy Garland (Tammy Blanchard is also marvelous as Judy Garland in her younger years). Ms. Luft, in a  voice-over at the end of the film, says that people should not look at her family's story as a tragedy.  I must respectfully disagree.  This feeble attempt to end the film on a note of optimism just didn't wash after witnessing the damage Judy Garland did to her family.
If you want a sobering look at what addiction can do to a family, then this film is just right.  But don't expect an objective look at Judy Garland's life.",1029196800,3,2220,4.587341772151898
1664439,5,B00005U8SP,"Let me begin by saying,in my opinion ""LIFE WITH JUDY GARLAND-ME AND MY SHADOWS"" is excellent! Judy Davis & Tammy Blanchard gave brilliant performances! The production deserved every award it received! As for the people who say Judy Davis wasn't Judy Garland, of course she wasn't! There's only one Judy Garland! Judy Davis is an actress not an impressionist! She captured the essence of Garland while at the same time making the character her own which is what every actor strives for. The film is based upon the book ""ME AND MY SHADOWS: A FAMILY MEMOIR"" by Lorna Luft. The key word is BASED, meaning the filmmakers couldn't include every aspect of the book in the movie. This has been the case with every film adaptation of any book from the 100+ years of filmmaking. The DVD itself is beautifully packaged. The picture and sound quality, chapter selection menu & special features are superb. There is an audio commentary track by Director Bob Ackerman and Lorna Luft which is worth every penny of the price of this DVD! Mr. Ackerman gives a scene by scene discription explaining how and why each scene was filmed. Ms. Luft then tells her point of view from all the vast research she did on the life of her Mom as well actually living through the events depicted in the latter part of the film. Lorna says right on the commentary that she has no problem with the filmmakers ""artistic license"" since Ms. Luft is an actress she understands this concept. The  behind the scenes featurette includes much praise for the performances of Ms. Davis & Miss Blanchard by Lorna Luft, the filmmakers and other cast members. As for the other cast members, they are incredible too! It was great to see Marsha Mason playing Judy's ruthless mother Ethel Gumm. Hugh Laurie as Vincent Minnelli played the role with dignity. The awesome Victor Garber played Sid Luft. I was quite impressed with actor Aidan Devine he played Judy's father Frank Gumm with such warmth. I really loved John Benjamin Hickey who played Roger Edens he was so charming, just the sound of his voice made me take notice. Since the first time I saw this film i've tried to see any film Mr. Hickey has appeared in. Actually you can see all of John Benjamin Hickey in the film ""LOVE, VALOR, COMPASSION"" watch the movie and see what I mean. Anyway, the entire cast of ""LIFE WITH JUDY GARLAND-ME AND MY SHADOWS"" is terrific! If you've been thinking about buying this DVD, let me tell you, buy it now! Also: read the book, it's a great read! I also enjoyed the audio book read by Lorna Luft.
Bottom line: One of the best Bio-pics ever made!",1028764800,2,2590,4.61822125813449

1664441,5,B00005U8SP,"Being a die-hard Judy Garland Fan. I couldn't wait for this film to come out. I have the video and DVD> The DVD has 10 minutes cut from the film where the VHS is complete. I feel this movie should be seen by everyone. The performances by Tammy Blanchard and Judy Davis are knockout performances. When you watch the film you really fall into Judy's world and Life. You feel her pain and her joys. her broken hearts and her love. One of the really great things about this film is that her real singing voice was used, both Tammy and Judy lip synced to the classic recordings. I love how authentic the costumes were they are exactly like they did in the original films. The most heart renching scene is where Judy is in her Dressing room with her husband vincente Minnelli right before they film ""The Trolley Song"" and she's in tears saying ""I Can't Be Judy Garland Today"" and another really great moment is when CBS Chews her out and she stood up for herself and her TV show.
I knew she loved her children but it this film It really came across and you knew that Liza Minnelli and Lorna Luft were her world. They ment everything to her. It will bring tears to your eyes.
It's a really powerful film about one of the greatest Singers in the world andI recommend this film to Oz Fans/Judy fans or fans of great entertainment!!! A Dynamite, powerhouse performance! Winner of 5 Emmies awards.

A ""no-holds barred"" approach, showing warts and all, and still making the whole increadible story unstoppable. HOWEVER I had a couple of issues watching this.... Firstly (as mentioned in another review) the video release cuts out many of the most poignant scenes shown in the TV version. This is nothing short of sad. My second critisim, and this is of both version, was the sense of ""running out of time"" towards the end. Emotionally charged and powerful scenes were no longer than a few fleeting seconds... this is a scripting fault, rather than a concept/directorial fault, I think. The effect is to dampen the emotions and meanings of these scenes. I found myself wanting more out of the movie, and found the retail version failing even more than the TV version to deliver.

1664444,5,B00005U8SP,"To say this film is good is an incredible understatement. What makes it so good is the jaw-dropping performances of its two Judys, Tammy Blanchard and Judy Davis. Ms. Blanchard plays Judy early in her life, up to Meet Me in St. Louis, and does one whale of a job. Her physical resemblance at times is eerie. Judy Davis portrays Judy from that film to the end, and HER resemblance is frightening! It's as if she 'channeled' the real Garland onto film. The concert performances were understandably lip-synced, but you feel as if you are watching actual concert footage. These two fine actresses each deserved and received emmies for their work, and the whole production should have received more. Knowing how Garland's life ended, I still broke down at the end, because it seemed like viewing history as it happened. This film is well-worth buying, and viewing over and over.",1016496000,,873,4.826666666666667

1664446,5,B00005U8SP,"This was a Herculean feat, daring to bring back the greatest singing star of the last century. Fortunately, through the brilliant vision of the director, the guiding hand of her daughter, and Judy Davis in a performance of a lifetime, they manage to succeed on all accounts. ""Me and My Shadows"" is worthy of all the accolades.
Starting with the dramatic and angst filled life of Judy herself, the tale starts appropriately from the moment she stepped onstage to the moment she left it 47 years later. From the highs of her performance in the Wizard of Oz and later on, Carnegie Hall, to the lows of suicide attempts and her battle with drugs, this movie weaves a dramatic story that at times would be bold and unbelieable had it not actually happened. Judy's life was a roller coaster, but in it, moments of genuiness and brillance that only insiders, and now us, knew.
The outstanding performances of both Tammy Blanchard and Judy Davis amaze us from the moments they appear on screen. Tammy nails the young Judy perfectly, and you never doubt it one minute. This actress has an amazing range. Passing off the baton midway, Judy Davis runs as if her life depends on it. Her portrayal of the legend is dead on, spookily accurate, and inspiring. Not only does she look like her, but her concert performances are so realisitic you'd believe it was concert footage if not for the modern camera work. Judy Davis' recreation of Judy's ""Over the Rainbow"" in tramp costume is touching and true. Both women deserve all the awards for performance possible.
Some criticisms: the last part of the film seems to bog down a bit as it switches focus from Judy to her daughter Lorna's story. While understandable, especially since Ms. Luft was so instrumental in making the film, it seems to lose a bit of steam. You desparately want to stay with Judy, but she diminishes a little bit as Lorna grows up. Also, the commentary track on the DVD is  wonderful, save one thought. Many times during it, the director Robert Ackerman often talks over Lorna, interrupts her, and comes across as being more of an expert about Judy than her own daughter. While that might be true, I would have enjoyed Lorna's story much more as an original source, and wished Ackerman would let her speak more.
Other than that, with the price and the quality of the performances, you cannot go wrong including this screen jewel in your DVD collection.",1014508800,5,2409,4.695035460992908

7954316,4,B00005U8SP,"Life with Judy Garland is an impressive portrayal of the life and career of Judy Garland.  Earning 5 Emmy awards this production sets the bar high for a television production, and bio-pics.  Judy Davis was superbly cast as Garland. She has a strong resemblance to Garland, and also captures many of Garlands mannerisms and idiosyncrasies. Tammy Blanchard plays young Judy, and is impressive in her own right. The music of Garland is certainly another highlight of this production, and Davis does a thoroughly convincing job during the performance scenes.

All the major events in Garlands life are included, as well as other parts of her story that aren't so well known. For example, the challenges she went through as an awkward child and the way adults  especially at the studio  treated her. In addition, I had no idea that it was MGM studio that got her addicted to drugs.  Regardless of her challenges, which sometimes included her physical and mental conditions, she managed to deliver the goods. Throughout storyline, Davis delivers emotional and nuanced performers that help you empathize with Garlands ups and downs.

If the portrayal of her career decline is accurate, its a shame how the TV executives treated Garland. Her show might not have garnered immediate strong ratings, but in hindsight it might have been because she was ahead of her time.

This bio-pic has a great cast, high production value, and is attentive to the music and its presentation.
