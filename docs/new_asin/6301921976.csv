 (starring Leslie and co.)is getting those reviews attached to them. Right now I am looking at buying DON Quixote and sure enough, there is the review used for the live movie (again). Does anyone edit these things?",1237248000,3,290,4.576923076923077
7816641,5,6301921976,"I loved this Magoo series when I was a little boy and it aired in prime time on NBC Saturday nights. I only wish the series now was available on dvd so my young family could easily enjoy them and develop an appreciation for the classics. Please bring the entire series back on DVD. I am especially interested in Magoos TREASURE ISLAND,  NOAHS ARK,CAPT KIDD, MOBY DICK, and ROBIN HOOD. The Don Quixote version is wonderful because it introduces young children to the characters and basic plot of this timeless masterpiece. Magoo is a star. What more dare I say!!!!",1184630400,2,563,4.63
