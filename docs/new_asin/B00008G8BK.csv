We are talking about 3 B hall of famers, so it was with great anticipation that we got the chance to do a unit and get some b. As we discussed Mike Norris deserved a full show but it was us who got the full show. Mike Norris, you are our inspiration.

The second this movie started, it earned a can. The thing is from 1996 and the first few seconds had the quality of 80s adult VHS.And we would have absolutley stuck with this one in 94 because the second scene was in a strip club owned by the immortal Chink Weber. Anyway, Norris plays a cab driver who got canned for slapping around all the customers like the Beaut. So, feeling down, he went to the same bar he went to celebrate his ironman victory. Tough bikers show up and start beating this pud bartender when Norris, a spannish guy playing a black minister, and a Japaneese yazz flute player came to his rescue. Did I mention the Japaneese guy's name cuz that's kinda important. I swear on Aaron Rodger's life it's freaking McQueen. And this wasn't just any bar, it was Joe Estivez's bar. After Joe chases these guys out with a shotgun they hatch this scheme to rob a casino in an alley. I would do it in a minute with you. They actually pull off the robery but then the Chineese casino boss has to come back on them so he takes out Norris'a dad and Norris lets out the most amazing ""NOOOOOOOOO!"" ever filmed and he takes out the spanish black minister and the bartender. So it was Norris and McQueen vs. the bad guys just like in Death Ring. Amazimg. Of course they take them out. Then they went their seperate ways like Journey for the tearjerker ending. Then the bikers from the bar kill McQueen. Heartbreaking.

What a freaking movie. There's not B too much finer than this. It had it all. Whole story lines not making any sense, awful awful acting, and some of the worst stunts since Journey to the West. Couldn't have been more made for Sid. This is a must view for the upper level B afficianato. Norris was at his best here check these lines:
""Poor b**tard""
""This is peachy just f**king peachy""
and ""Give my reguards to Jimmy"" right before he capps a guy. Bravo Matt Collins. Drive-in totals I think I would like to shower with you we could do it in the shower too.

This film was made the same year as ""Set It Off.""  They have much, much in common.  However, ""Set It Off"" was of higher quality and much more believable.  In a way, the two are practically like Clark's ""The Other Half"" and Walters' ""The View.""  I didn't see the film, but I wonder if ""Four Brothers"" takes from both films.

The musical group Culture Club got its name because the four band members had different identities:  a gender-bending singer, a suburban guitarist, a Jewish drummer, and a Jamaican bassist.  The four characters here are a culture club:  one Black, one Asian, one dark-haired white guy, and one fair-haired one.  Just as Culture Club had Helen Terry for gender diversity, this film has a female love interest that turns the quartet into a quintet.  Usually in these Hollywood motley crews, people of color are present, but pushed into the margins.  In a way, the Asian character is the main character, not the light-haired Caucasian.  Each actor calls the Asian lead ""McQueen"" even though the credits say his name was Kuroda.  I kinda wonder if this was an American B-movie targeted to the Asian film market.

I hated this film during the first ten minutes, then it gradually got better.  It's far from Oscar-worthy, but I wasn't an absolute stinker either.",1177804800,,1458,4.718253968253968
