8252649,5,B0013QTSQ2,"In this DVD, Ken C. Roebuck takes you through the steps of training your spaniel (no matter what breed of hunting spaniel) from the time you get your dog to the time he/she is field ready. What is very nice about this DVD is that he teaches and shows you step by step what you drills and exercises you should be teaching and doing with you spaniel from the time they are 12 weeks old to the point where they are field ready. The information given is very specific (whether he states it specifically or does it without stating it specifically) on what you should do and when you should do it.

He explains the all the commands you should use through the use of a whistle, verbally, and vocally when training your spaniel. He also explains the reasoning behind those commands. He demonstrates, with one of his own spaniels, how to correctly do everything and what to do when your spaniel does not do a command correctly by demonstration while explaining it.

He also talks about and explains in detail why you need to do certain drills with your spaniel.

The movie is excellent and I highly recommend it. What I found very nice is he has broken everything down into 14 lessons that start you from the time you get the puppy to the time the dog is ready to actually go out and work the field like he/she was bread to do! Plus he also  explains and talks about the training equipment that will be necessary to purchase at the beginning at each lesson.......He also explains and shows the trainer how to use and the propose of each piece of training equipment at the begining of each lesson!

I have a French Brittany who is a hunting machine and if I would've not invested into to this DVD, I believe I would've trained him in the incorrect manner!!!!

This is a must for any upland game hunter who is going to train an upland game spaniel!!!!",1320710400,3,1840,4.412979351032448
8252650,3,B0013QTSQ2,"I've only just started watching it.  I am guessing the ""content"" is good.  I ""harumphed"" a little when I saw the cover photos and read the cover info -- flushing dogs -- the photos on the cover all appear to be Brittanys, not springer or other flushing dogs.  I doubt there will be any pointing dog info on the DVD -- which is as it should be -- if it's about flushing dogs there shouldn't be anything about Brittanys on it.

Then, now that I've started watching it...the video quality is exceedingly poor.  It may have been shot with a low-res. camera, or was dubbed onto DVD from VHS.  Still, for $29.99 Cabela's price, it should be to modern video standards.

Interestingly, the first dog, at least, that Roebuck uses is a ""hunting cocker from 100% hunting cocker lines,"" and he notes the difference in appearance from ""bench"" cockers.  The dog is indistinguishable from a hunting springer -- and I have seen lots of hunting cockers that don't look like springers; they look like cockers.  Point being...I'd say there's basically complete convergence of some formerly-cocker lines and field-type springer lines.  Not surprising in that, as I understand it, cockers and springers were once the same breed, separated based on size.  It's probably time that bench springers and field springers are officially considered separate breeds, isn't it?",1276992000,,1346,4.911504424778761
8252651,5,B0013QTSQ2,"I purchased this DVD for Christmas for my husband who pheasant hunts with my English Springer Spaniel.  This is my 2nd Springer plus I owned a Brittany.  My dogs enjoyed many ""birdy"" years up until they passed away from old age.

My husband will enjoy this DVD as he is always looking for books and videorecordings about training and animal behaviour.  From my searches of other websites, this apparently is a very popular video.  The video arrived within days of placing the order and delivered well-packed.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/GUN-DOG-DVD-Training-Spaniels-Featuring-Kenneth-C-Roebuck/dp/B0013QTSQ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">GUN DOG DVD Training Spaniels, Featuring Kenneth C.
