3777562,5,B001RPO3FU,"Agatha Christie's renowned Belgian detective resolves yet another slate of atmospheric British-themed crimes! Here is a synopsis of each episode. (I've rendered my own relative evaluation of each one on a 1-10 scale, 10 being the best):

VOLUME 1 (Disc One)

The Million-Dollar Bond Robbery -- At the behest of bank officials, Poirot and Hastings accompany a bank representative who is notorious for his gambling on the Queen Mary across the Atlantic to America -- the bank's assets are clearly in jeopardy of being stolen. But Poirot never gets to debark from the ship as the bank's bonds have apparently disappeared along the route so it's back to England in an attempt to solve the mystery. [ 7.5]

The Plymouth Express -- Christie enthusiasts will recognize this yarn as being loosely based upon&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mystery-of-the-Blue-Train-Hercule-Poirot-Series/dp/0594035503/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mystery of the Blue Train (Hercule Poirot Series)</a>. A financial magnate's daughter is experiencing ex-husband difficulties just prior to re-kindling an old flame with a nefarious French Count. She journeys away in a train compartment, ostensibly for a weekend excursion, and is later discovered brutally murdered for her valuable and now-missing jewels. Poirot is called in by the girl's distraught father to ferret out the killer while Inspector Jap of Scotland Yard remains typically befuddled. [6.5]

Wasp's Nest -- The intellectual and refined son of one of Poirot's old acquaintances is affianced to an attractive and well-known model who is clearly bearing the burden of a past dark secret. Poirot and Hastings visit the privileged son and, while there, the master detective sniffs out a murder case... one which has yet to happen! Inspector Japp is notably inconvenienced by appendicitis as a sub-plot. [7.5]

VOLUME 2 (Disc Two)

The Tragedy at Marsden Manor -- Marsden Manor harbors the ghost of a young girl which haunts the vicinity of a gigantic and ancient cedar tree on the estate; however, the Lord of the manor doesn't buy into this yarn although he is sympathetic to his young wife's chilling encounters with the apparition. Very soon the discovery of his corpse found lying beneath the tree's canopy seems to confirm the ghost's presence as well as its efficacy. Through a comedy of errors, Poirot and Hastings find themselves in the vicinity of this sleepy little hamlet and the two are consequently pulled into the case, (luckily for Inspector Japp!) The sordid and dreary lady book-keeper of the estate seems a nasty piece of work but Poirot maintains an open mind. [9]

The Double Clue -- Here, the screenwriters didn't bother to modify one of Christie's well-known original titles:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Double-Clue/dp/B001RMWAV2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Double Clue</a>.This is an unusual episode as Poirot immediately loses his heart to a dubious but attractive Russian Countess. Then Poirot discovers that, at a series of elite parties where the Countess has been in attendance, valuable jewels have come up missing. The pressure is turned up on a very depressed Chief Inspector Japp to break the case but Poirot unexplainably declines any interest in helping him to resolve his career-busting demise. Miss Lemon and Captain Hastings thus take up the baton, deciding to pursue the facts of the case and Hastings is nearly killed as a result! [6.5]

The Mystery of the Spanish Chest -- Is the lovely wife of a jealous man about to be murdered? A mutual acquaintance of both this lovely lady and Poirot believes that it is so. Poirot attends a party in pursuit of more clues and he is astonished when Inspector Japp later informs him that the jealous husband has been found at the party house inside an old Spanish chest, the obvious victim of a murderer! This episode features terrific co-stars including Peter Copley (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fall-of-Eagles/dp/B000EMGF2Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fall of Eagles</a>) as Burgoyne, the stereotypical English butler; John McEnry (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Little-Dorrit/dp/B001PU8N0I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Little Dorrit</a>) as Colonel Curtiss; and, John Noble (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Return-of-the-King-Platinum-Series-Special-Extended-Edition/dp/B000634DCW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition)</a>) who plays Rigoletto. [9]

VOLUME 3 Disc Three)

The Theft of the Royal Ruby -- A flashy woman steals a priceless Egyptian ruby from a rowdy Prince of that realm. As a caveat of the theft, British interests in the Suez Canal are at stake so while Poirot despises the Prince's flamboyant behavior he still takes on the case. His chief suspect is soon tracked down and found to be in association with a prominent archaeologist who resides in the English countryside. Under an arranged pretense, a Christmas invitation is extended to Poirot who probes the estate for clues during his brief stay -- the ruby is found almost inadvertently but the crime remains unsolved as far as discovering the identity of the thief -- the Prince demands further investigation. Lots of terrific atmosphere is generated but the mansion remarkably resembles the one seen in *The Double Clue*. [8]

The Affair at the Victory Ball -- A gaggle of BBC Radio actors, one of whom being quite wealthy, all attend a New Year's costume ball dressed as Harlequin and company. When the rich actor, (who is also a noted collector of rare China), is brutally stabbed to death, Poirot is faced with deciphering a crime where all the suspects were shrouded in full disguise during the evening of murder. This is one of Christie's most formulaic yarns, much akin to the works of R. Austin Freeman:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dr-Thorndike-Mysteries-Collection-Volume-One-Four-Books-in-One-Volume/dp/B001FB5ST6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dr. Thorndike Mysteries Collection, Volume One (Four Books in One Volume!)</a>. [6.5]

The Mystery of Hunter's Lodge -- A quarrelsome old Uncle sustains a hand wound from the shotgun of an inexperienced member of a large hunting party as the group blasts away at fly-by grouse on the winter moor. Back at the lodge, ill feelings continue to fester as Poirot, still freezing from his unpleasant outdoor experience as an onlooker, decides to retreat to his nearby hotel bed where Hastings looks after his ill friend. That very night a stranger appears at the lodge and puts a permanent end to the crusty old Uncle's rambling repertoire of bragging and carping! This episode features the superb atmosphere which manifests the very Hallmark of the classic Golden Age British Mystery. At 9.5, this is easily the most compelling episode of the set.

These Poirot episodes were first aired on PBS station broadcasts in 1991. The total run time for each disc (of which there are three) is 153 minutes (just over 50 minutes per episode.) Poirot is artfully played by the adroit and talented actor David Suchet.

Highly recommended for fans of the genre.",1301788800,37,7349,5.730275229357798

3777565,5,B001RPO3FU,"I'll keep this very simple:  My wife and I can't watch TV.  The programs we find on our television set seem to be written by and for people with Attention Deficit Disorder.  After about five minutes of viewing, I am ready to do something as violent as the characters I'm watching.  Enter Hercule Poirot, the elegant, brilliant French detective, who with sidekicks Captain Hastings and Miss Lemon provide hours of enjoyment.  Throw in a little Chief Inspector Jaap, and you have the recipe for...wait a minute!  Did I day French?  I meant Belgian!  Sorry.",1274572800,48,554,4.819148936170213

3777570,5,B001RPO3FU,"I thoroughly enjoy watching David Suchet in the character role. I never wanted to own mysteries, since once you see it how surprised can you be? But getting older has its compensations. I forget things so much, that as long as I wait awhile it is almost like new again. The cast of each production is well chosen and well-directed. Word to the wise however, it is possible to find these cheaper elsewhere.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Agatha-Christie-s-Poirot-The-Classic-Collection-Set-2/dp/B001RPO3FU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Agatha Christie's Poirot: The Classic Collection - Set 2</a>",1325548800,,630,6.511904761904762

The DVD's themselves are beautifully made.  The color and sound is perfect.  If you are a dyed in the wool Agatha fan like me, then you will love these programs.  David Suchet is the perfect actor for Poirot.  Along with Hugh Frasier, Pauline Moran and Phillip Jackson the quartet brings the stories to life.

I love the classic mysteries.
I love the music.
But the characters make the show!

I'm 16 years old and adore this show.
After watching a Poirot with my mom I can't help but be happy.

If you are looking to buy some Proirot mysteries this collection is a top contender.  These and other early episodes are lighter hearted.  The classic collection sets are the TV episodes.  Be careful not to confuse them with the movie collections which are longer but you get fewer.

A must see  :)",1313280000,2,508,4.340425531914893
3777577,5,B001RPO3FU,"I own all but 2 of the Poirot series with David Suchet as Poirot. I will eventually purchase the whole series, and will be sad when I have come to the end. David Suchet has portrayed Poirot excellently. I do not compare the movies to the Agatha Christies books. I have not read the books but will someday. I enjoy setting down at days end, plugging in a DVD of Poroit and engulfing myself in a life style of England and the world of years ago. It is hours of entertainment that I can watch over and over.
