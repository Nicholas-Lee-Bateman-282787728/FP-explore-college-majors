2521118,4,B000EHSVVO,It was interesting seeing Henry Fonda in Immortal Sergeant.  He was young when he played the part of this combat soldier in this movie.  I know years later he played in other war movies like Battle of the Bulge and Midway.,1170720000,3,222,4.390243902439025
2521119,5,B000EHSVVO,"This is one of the early World War II movies(1943).  It is very well done and extremely entertaining.  The story of the mild mannered soldier that is forced to take command in a very difficult situation is presented in such away that the viewer is enthralled with the character.  Henry Fonda was perfect for the role and he brought the transformation from a weak timid man to a heroic soldier off with great finese.  I loved this movie.  If I had been in the audience in 1943, I would have rushed out and bought the war bonds that were advertised at the end of the film.",1025827200,62,570,4.339622641509434

2521174,5,B000EHSVVO,"HENRY FONDA plays a reluctant hero. The film is smart, interesting, dramatic, and has a surprise or two. If you like WAR MOVIES this one won't disappoint you. FONDA shows again he was one of the BEST ACTORS WHO EVER LIVED.",1392076800,,222,4.439024390243903
2521175,5,B000EHSVVO,"Great movie. I saw this movie when I was much younger and really enjoyed it. When I found it was on dvd I bought it. No regrets. Quality of the dvd is great. Thomas Mitchell and Henry Fonda are two fine actors, as is the supporting cast, so you should really enjoy this film.",1385424000,,275,4.111111111111111

2521178,5,B000EHSVVO,"Henry Fonda did a great job in this early World War II film where he portrays a Canadian corporal who suddenly finds himself in charge of a combat patrol in the Sahara desert when their sergeant dies. The title refers to the late sergeant, whose words of wisdom occasionally come to Fonda's mind throughout the film as Fonda is deciding what to do now that he is the leader.  The central focus in the film is the corporal's character as he evolves from someone who is unsure of himself and lacks confidence to becoming a mature person and able soldier who finds the inner strength to be a decisive and effective leader.",1364860800,,619,4.526785714285714
2521179,4,B000EHSVVO,"I don't remember ever seeing this before and I thought I knew most of the WW2 films from this era but I have never even heard of this one.  It has a solid cast with Henry Fonda and Thomas Mitchell as the leads.  It is a British film and about their army, Mitchell is old vet, a Sgt. from the old days who takes good care of his squad.  Fonda is next in command as a corporal and not the most confident guy in the world.  Of course it works out that he has to take over and get the squad through their troubles.  All in all a pretty good film.",1355616000,,542,3.8468468468468466
2521180,5,B000EHSVVO,"Great acting by the late Henry Fonda and the cast members of this movie. I really enjoyed him in the movie ""Drums Along the Mohawk.""",1314835200,,132,4.32
2521181,4,B000EHSVVO,I had never heard of this movie before stumbling across it one day. Henry Fonda is a Canadian Soldier who is serving in North Africa. As his mission unfolds he has some flashbacks about the girl he left behind. Maureen Ohara plays the girl and does a good job with a minor role. The flashbacks are a bit long but they do add to the film and I enjoyed watching Fonda in a serious role.,1290470400,,384,4.133333333333334

2521183,2,B000EHSVVO,"An early Fonda Film set in North Africa during WWII.  Hank plays one of several
British Tommys fighting the nasty nazis.  It is an interesting mixture of
blatent flag waiving (that is not a bad thing) typical B grade propaganda
effort (that is a bad thing) and Mr. Fonda trying hard but not quite succeding, to
put fortha performance the equal of his co-stars.  I liked the film mainly because
it is a classic example of WWII propaganda.  Could have taken place in the American
South West in the 1870's with Fonda fighting the Apaches over a water hole.
  If you have little expectation of an Oscar Winning effort you will not be disapointed.
But it is worth the watch.  WH",1213228800,3,673,4.512396694214876
2521184,4,B000EHSVVO,"Henry Fonda stars as timid Canadian writer Colin Spence who enlists in the British Army during World War II.  Living in London, becomes inspired to join the war effort leaving behind his girlfriend Valentine played by Maureen O'Hara to the amorous advances of love rival and journalist Joe Benedict played by a dapper Reginald Gardiner.  Interestingly Fonda completed the filming of the movie just prior to the commencement his own wartime service,

Fonda who has risen to the rank of corporal is fighting the Italians in the Libyan desert.  His mild mannered nature finds him eschewing command all the while learning at the elbow of respected veteran platoon leader Sgt. Kelly played by Irish American character actor Thomas Mitchell.  When a desert fire fight leaves his platoon decimated, Fonda and Mitchell must lead the lost survivors through the sweltering desert sands.  When another battle claims the respected Mitchell, Fonda is forced to assume command to save himself and his 3 remaining men.

Fonda exhibiting leadership and heroism is spurred on reminded of the words of the beloved Sgt. Kelly.  He leads a well conceived suicide mission during a raging sandstorm, against a large contingent of Germans guarding an oasis which harbors the sole source of life sustaining water.  His experience matures him into a man worthy of command and the hand of the girl he left behind.

This film completed in the midst of the darker days of WWII evoked a strong sense of realism and patriotism without overly cranking up the propaganda, typical of films of this time.",1196553600,7,1570,5.027027027027027
2521185,4,B000EHSVVO,"I really liked the movie.  I had never seen it prior to this.  I bought it, only because I happen to like old B&W movies.  This is a great classic that everyone should see.",1195862400,,172,4.0
2521186,5,B000EHSVVO,"First saw this movie on TV in the early 1960s and have always liked it since.  Good character studies and insights into leadership.  As with all war movies made during WWII, it has some propaganda included but in general, holds up pretty well.

Action takes place in Libya probably in Feb/Mar 1941 just as the Germans are arriving in Africa.  Flashbacks during the main plot reveal how we got to where we are.",1186876800,2,409,4.561643835616438

Henry Fonda stars as a Canadian Corporal who takes charge of what is left over after his Patrol was shot up and his Sergeant is killed. It's not a realistic movie by any means, but it's mildly entertaining and Henry Fonda always manages to make even mediocre movies just a little bit better.",1464566400,,381,4.380281690140845
