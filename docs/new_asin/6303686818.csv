718348,5,6303686818,"It's movies like ""Hardbodies"" that made an evening out at the drive-in so much fun!  I saw this movie back in 1984, and countless times on TV and still really enjoy it.  I bought a VHS copy of this movie 2 years ago, and it's been replayed on a regular basis.  The California sunshine, the beach, lots of bikinis and the funny characters make this a memorable movie.  Basically the plot consists of 3 middle-aged men renting a beach house, and the local dude shows them how to ""dialogue"" bikini-clad babes known as ""hardbodies"" on the beach.  It's not a serious movie, just lots of fun.  It's a movie that you can watch over & over again which makes it a great choice for buying.  If you are looking for some light entertainment, and you are a fan of '80s movies, then this one will not disappoint!  I hope one of these days that it's released on DVD!",1030579200,19,851,4.341772151898734
718349,3,6303686818,"Growing up 80's had to be the the greatest era of them all.  Amongst movies like ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Last American Virgin and Hollywood Knights, this movie had my motor rrrrrvn'!!!  You could only appreciate it though if you grew up as an 80's teen film buff.  Don't bother if your looking for serious acting.  Grant Cramer will never be a household name. Between he and his ""Carrot Top"" look-alike side kick, they manage to convince you through enough ""BS"" to get you to
watch 3 over-the-hill, never-gonna-get-it, well-to-do, old men; rumble, stumble & bumble their way to more unforseeable lonely nights.  Might I add, he gets pa-aid for it too...handsomely.  Remember sitting up at night watching ""Friday Night Videos""? Well afterwards, this was the kind of movie that kept you up until dawn. Hardbodies is only for the hard charging, nastalgic, hair band era (Prince & the Revolution, Bon Jovi).  No acting skills necessary!  Have busts, will travel! This movie is for you. Just Don't forget where you come from...Tom Hanks, not included.",1003536000,6,1053,4.943181818181818

I know the critics hate this movie but if you watch it with an open mind you will be cracking up and spitting milk through your nose. The jokes never  stop and the Ragger gets laid. Can you imagine Rags with a set of 48 DD  dugz? Does it get any better than that? Yes! The Ragger flipping off the  beach geeks in 47 different languages. I agree the old BBD is the best part  of this flick. I wonder what ever happened to the old dude that played  ""Southern Comfort"" or the fat dude.",957398400,5,553,3.9909090909090907
718518,5,6303686818,"When did Anchorbay/Starz  start pulling any of there catalog  titles?
I payed around $12.00 for this Collection
now it's being sold for $50.00+ it's not even a remastered blu ray!
Lord what happened to the Anchorbay that put out HQ products and didn't limited the release time

The original Hardbodies is a must see 1980's teen sex comedy
the cast is a hit and miss of genre actors
Grant Cramer  (Scotty) did lots of 80's horror
Courtney Gains  (Rag)  is without a doubt the biggest star to come out of this film (from Children of the Corn, The Burbs, Colors) he's done a lot
Crystal Shaw  (Candy) did horror too!
Darcy DeMoss  (Dee)  Known For  Can't Buy Me Love Can't Buy Me Love, Friday the 13th part 6 Jason Lives,  Return to Horror High  and various tv guest staring roles

The breakdown is very much like a adult film
you have three middle age wealthy guys visit CA and try and pick up younger chicks
They suck at it so they employee a younger hipper CA stud  Scotty
the film is a gem it's just a sleazy B-Style nudity filled comedy
The logic isn't there these guys could get high end escorts and not have to worry about the younger slicker guy
but, it's 1984 everyone was high on huge amounts of blow plot logic meant nothing
you have a bunch of struggling female actress throw money at them and bang T&A all day
This film is simple mindless early 80's fun
I'm shocked this film never got re-made/re-booted but, with all the politically correct nonsense going on (The MPAA would make sure a film like this would get buried and only put on demand and home video
The follow-up Hardbodies II is a stretch and don't work I've never been able to watch it all the way through it's just not the same  as the original
The first Hardbodies deserves a collector's edition on blu ray but, i doubt that will happen anytime soon!
  This collection is  still a  solid 8.5/10
The original is a sleazy classic to say the least",1450310400,,1917,4.394886363636363
718519,4,6303686818,"Two movies--both rated R.  The first one revolves around three middle-aged men who rent a place on the California beach in an effort to pick up as many of the beach girls as possible.  Having no luck, they hire one of the local beach bums to teach them how to become attractive to the younger generation of girls.  The second movie is about the making of a movie on one of the Greek Isles.  The hero stars in the ""movie"", while trying to connect in real life with the local girl who plays his leading lady.  Sort of a movie within a movie scenario.  There is no connection plot wise between Hardbodies I and II.  The only similarity is in the number of swimsuit models who are willing to appear in various stages of undress.  The plots are silly; the acting is adequate; and the main reason to watch either of these movies is for the number of swimsuit models who are willing to appear in various states of undress.",1448668800,2,915,4.341176470588235

That's not a bad thing when you want more visual than some sort of story line.  I got this for a gift but thought I should check it out first.  The first movie had young girls and nudity but it was treated with humor, not smut.  I didn't see the other movie yet but the idea that the older guys got a beach rental to lure young chicks is the plot.  There is a love me / don't love me story going on that is like Doris Day - Rock Hudson.

Hardbodies 2 was a waste of good film, the acting and story was so bad after about 20 minutes I started fast forward to see if it would get better but it never did.  If you like this type movie HB1 is probably worth a look if you can get it at a good price otherwise I would recomend ""Beach Girls"" it's the same kind of story but it's about 3 hot girls instead of three old dudes.",1347408000,,673,3.8905109489051095

719021,5,6303686818,"To start off, I loved Hardbodies 1, that was a great movie with everything. Scotty, the beach hunk and smooth-talker, training a group of ""older gentlemen"", shall be say, how to get hard-bodies? How can you possibly lose with an idea like that! Without revealing too much of the story itself since you literally need to see it to believe it, this is a classic teen-pig-sex-comedy from the 80s and a definite must watch, if not just for the memorable lines (""Cause she don't f*** fossils for freeeee"", thanks Ashby!) It also has Mr. Skins seal of approval :P

Hardbodies 2, on the other hand, blew. You know you're in trouble when only one of the original actors comes back, and it wasn't Scotty. The guy who played Ashby was the only one to come back. The brief plot is that Scotty is in Greece for some film shoot and he runs into Ashby who's on a yacht and a total player. In contrast to the above, which is so good you have to see it, this movie is so bad that you have to see it just to understand its level of suckiness. It definitely falls short of the original.

So, I know I gave Harbodies 1 a-lot of praise, and I would like to make it clear that I am QUITE aware that it is not some kind of a film-classic or masterpiece of cinema, but that doesn't stop it from being a great movie to watch. It's a goofy film, and if you like raunchy comedies you'll probably laugh your butt-off watching it.",1307059200,6,1402,4.2669172932330826

One of the best NAKED movies to come from the 80's. It has a good handful of gorgeous women; most of them look just like your everyday gal. It has sex, nudity and the plot is actually funny! Good actors, good scenes, good dialog and an upbeat pace that keeps you interested. Hey, even the music is good.

The nudity is exactly what it should be: stupid and funny. The photo shoot scenes is the best. 6 lovely women, 5 of them topless and 10 boobs. This scene alone should have definitely won an award. And then there's the fitness scene staring the gym girls. One woman shakes her breasts so fast and hard that you'd think that someone set them on fire! Other scenes include a beach dog that steals a bikini top and 2 girls standing topless in front of a mirror asking each other ""Why do guys like boobs?""

The picture quality is great. Clear enough with vivid colors. Not completely clear or perfect but you definitely won't see anything like this on vhs. The sound quality is just as good.

If you grew up during the 80's then do yourself a favor and get it. They don't have the guts to make movies like this anymore. This was the pre AIDS era when having care free sex was still accepted and this movie reflects it.
If you're only going to by one movie this year then buy this one... also.",1276300800,121,1331,4.290836653386454

719134,3,6303686818,"Welcome back to the 80's folks 1984 to be exact. And from the vaults comes this classic 80's sex comedy thanks to the folks at Anchor Bay Hardbodies. The 1986 sequel is included in the set but I'm here to talk about the original. Back in the 80's teen sex comedies were all the rage and Hardbodies would be in the upper echelon of the genre. The story opens with us meeting Scotty Palmer a young beach bum type about to be evicted from his dumpy apartment. Scotty is one of those guys floating thru life trying to find themselves,He's got a hot hardbodied girlfriend Kristi that he's crazy about. Hardbodies the term itself applies to a young woman(usually) that has a tight toned body .You can thank Jane Fonda from the era for introducing that look. Not that I'm complaining mind you nor should you. Anyhow he's on the beach with best bud Rag looking to come up with a plan to save his apartment.lo and behold enter 3 middle aged guys Hunter,Rounder and Ashby who arrive in L.A. looking to score chicks. The 3 guys dubbed ""fossils"" by the locals strike out big time in their efforts to meet hotties. They end up meeting Scotty and hire him as their guru(NOT a pimp)to help them score hardbodies. What follows is Scotty teaching the guys the art of the BBD ""Bigger,Better. Deal"" which was how you scored a girl back in 1984. The guys get success with Hunter really becoming what is now known as a player. Scotty along the way ends up managing an all girl rock band(played by 80's pop metaller's Vixen)and trying to decide if Kristi is the one for him. Kristi in turn wonders about her future and if Scotty is going to grow up and be a part of it. What helps make Hardbodies apart from the pack is that the writing is good enough that you care about these characters. You don't hate Scotty(Grant Cramer) or Kristi(Teal Roberts).Hunter(Gary Wood) becomes the defacto heel of the fossils but Ashby(Sorells Pickard) is quite likable. Hardbodies also besides having lots of female breasts on display has early appearances by Kane Hodder(as Foz) and Kathleen Kinmont. And unlike today the hardbodies on display are almost 100% natural no saline to be found. So if you long for the 80's and want a semi intelligent comedy(unlike say an Adam Sandler film) then check out the Hardbodies I bet you'll love it.",1259280000,61,2300,4.571428571428571
719135,3,6303686818,"Although this film isn't one of the highlights of the early eighties, I will say that a hundred or more years from now, some of these films will be seen as a window to the culture of the early 80's.  It's really like looking into a window of the past to see what was there, what people were saying, what people were wearing, their hairstyles, and what types of scenary was there.
This film actually is a lot better done than what is credited for since it has made an impact on the social conscious of society and because so many people have seen it.  Not everybody can make a movie like this.  It is like looking at a party, but a lot of things were working for it - the pacing, the good looking actors, the cheeze, and the obligatory plot.",1253923200,2,740,4.197183098591549

719141,4,6303686818,"My four star rating of Hardbodies should include a disclaimer for all those considering purchasing this movie.  If you're looking for a deep, meaningful film with stellar acting, fascinating and complex characters, and brilliant writing, then save your money.  Whoever wrote the script for this film certainly wasn't striving to make Citizen Kane or The Graduate.
My positive rating for this film is for those guys out there who want to see a bevy of beauties flaunting their breasts, mixed with a little bit of humor ...  This film is pure 80's T&A, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that.  They certainly acquired some very beautiful ""talent"" for this film that is certainly worthy of wearing out the Pause button on your VCR.
The synopsis of the film is three middle aged men in mid-life crises rent a beach house and are having absolutely no success in scoring with the beautiful young women on the beach.  So they acquire the help of a young stud to show them how to succeed with these hotties.  But one of these guys turns into a jerk and puts the moves on the young stud's girlfriend.  Eventually the jerk gets his [come]-uppance, and our hero(?) gets his girl back.  Quite a fascinating storyline, huh?  The only actor of any note whatsoever in this film is goofy looking redheaded Courtney Gaines, who also starred in Children Of The Corn and Can't Buy Me Love, and had a small part in Back To The Future.  Also, there's an early appearence by girl rock group, Vixen, before they grew their hair out and had some success as a metal act in the late 80's!
Beautiful girls and their beautiful breasts are the selling point of this film.  Look elsewhere if you want more.",1050451200,13,1685,4.63973063973064

7853885,2,6303686818,"Their were several of these sex-crazed romps or even movies that had a plot more or less that came out in the 80's.  Some were good enough for the nudity, some for the party scenes just as much, some for a road trip, many for fighting against unlikable authority figures, some like the Porky's trilogy had a plot, good nudity and more, and some tried to pass themselves off as a porn.  Softcore porn or the weak attempt at it.  Sadly these two mostly worthless movies failed to live up to Porky's(the 80's teen comedy trilogy that every sex-filled teen film should be measured by), tried to be more softcore porns than proper movies, and even worse failed to establish anything worthwhile during the course of them.

In Hard Bodies we meet a beach going teen named Scotty Palmer.  Scotty is having problems with paying his rent at his beach apartment and his landlord is intent on evicting him.  Knowing that he may be homeless soon but trying to take it in stride even after his girlfriend Kristi hears the bad news, he finds a quick possible solution as 3 middle-aged businessmen named Hunter, Rounder, and Ashby ask for his aid in scoring with the hot Southern California girls that live local to the beach house that they rented.  In return they would give him a place to live and $600.  At first Scotty didn't like the idea but once he returns to his beach apartment only to see that his landlord blocked entrance to it by boarding it up, Scotty decides to take them up on their offer.  What ensues are some somewhat funny comedic mishaps as the 3 middle-aged businessmen fail to impress the sexy California women.  On the side Scotty finds a girl band to promote naming them Hard Bodies in emphasis of the local sexy beach community.

All this movie manages to offer is some good scenes of nudity and some hot scenes.  By some I mean that this movie didn't offer as much nudity or sex scenes as you would think.  Often times the scenes were brief or showed nothing.  The party scenes just didn't pack even remotely enough fun to make this movie worth the time.  The vast majority of the characters were quite dull.  There was simply no real character development.  The plot sounded like it had potential but only proved to go nowhere fast.  When there was nothing else going on one of the characters becomes the villain for no good rhyme or reason other than lazy writing and filler so that the movie isn't too short.  That villain part just wasn't necessary.  Kristi was a super annoying wet blanket of a girlfriend, Candy was a sexy yet obnoxious and unlikable tease, the girl band were one-dimensional, Rounder was a gross out and a moron, Ashby is just a one-dimensional redneck cowboy stereotype,  Scotty is a philanderer and a big whiner, and Hunter while cool in some ways is much too unpredictable in others.  Location wise not only wasn't that much of the beach filmed but there's only a couple of city scenes and even there you don't see much of the surrounding area. 2 1/2 stars out of 10.

As for Hard Bodies 2 while it wasn't quite as terrible as the first and it had its moments, the whole element with the film crew filming from America to Greece became very annoying, distracting, and worst of all it made it near impossible to figure out what was really going on in the vast majority of the scenes.  So this movie just proves so unbelievably confusing. Granted there was much more nudity in this chapter and it was really good nudity, but had this movie only bothered to stop making a scene appear to be real one minute then you find out that it was just a shot that the fictional film crew and the fictional actors within this movie were doing and that the scene completely fools you.  While the character development is a bit better also still that wasn't enough.  Also there would be painfully moronic and totally embarrassing  scenes in it like when the guy that falls for the sexy Cleo carries her from being exhausted from walking, as he carries her she sings some song of some kind.  Also the scene where the sexy Cookie not only gets her shoe tied to her chair by the director's mean wife, but Cookie for some reason is holding a chainsaw and uncontrollably starts stumbling with the chainsaw with it running and then accidentally chases people out of the way while cutting off umbrella tops.  Both were juvenile and just plain embarrassing scenes that weren't needed.  As this movie is a bit tongue and cheek with good nudity it was just too incredibly tough to figure out what was just the movie within the movie and what scenes were actually happening within the movie's slight plot.  It puzzles me as to how they ever got James Karen to star in this turkey.  He's cool and all but what was he even thinking. 3 stars out of 10.

All in all neither of these films are especially worth seeing more than once.  They're poorly made as their isn't much for plots in either, not so great character development, they both leaned more towards being softcore porn that actual movies, both are very forgettable, neither are all that interesting, the attempts at fun scenes missed the mark 99% of the time, the jokes were lame,  there weren't even any great soundtracks or scores to come out of either.  Both are worth seeing only once and then never again.  Spring Break, Last Resort, the Porky's trilogy,and Hotdog the movie are some examples of far better sexy teen romps than either of these.",1470614400,,5419,4.555211558307533
