8752995,4,B01CH6SADS,It's not IP MAN but it's a good movie Donnie Yen is not in the movie as much as you think towards the end he has a couple fight scenes and I set the audio to English 2.0 that's the only english available but it mostly is sub titled but it's actually not bad,1466899200,,257,3.7777777777777777
8752996,5,B01CH6SADS,"Donnie strikes again!  He clearly demonstrates that he is a master of the historical fiction martial arts movie.  Based thinly on the visit of Dr. Sun to China in order to help organize resistance to the Ching government, Donnie weaves a multi-leveled tale of intrigue and betrayal.  For anyone interested in that period of China's history and watching Donnie's Wu Shu skills, this movie is well worth the price.",1292716800,,412,4.942028985507246
