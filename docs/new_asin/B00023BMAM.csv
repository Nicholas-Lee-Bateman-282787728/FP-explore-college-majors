8444794,1,B00023BMAM,"This is a movie about a pretend murder that turns into a mess with Tin Tan right in the middle of it.

I first watched this movie as child in the 70's but after seeing it again as an adult I only give it one star it does not have the spanglish codeswitching wordplay that Tin Tan is famous for. I recomed it for true Tin Tan fans - only.""",1175040000,2,338,3.8285714285714287
