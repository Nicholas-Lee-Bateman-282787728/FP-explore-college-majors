8193531,3,B000PUB57M,"This cheapie from Alpha Video (the film stock quality is exceptionally poor) is trying to capitalize on the current resurgence and exploration of grindhouse cinema.  If you can overlook the poor film quality then you might find something here somewhat worth your while, though neither film is great or even very good.

THE ASTRAL FIEND: This creeper concerns a detective trying to solve a growing murder spree whose victims are older starlets.  A jailed young man who has mommy issues develops psychic powers that turn him into the titular astral fiend, a psycho who can essentially turn himself invisible and incorporeal.  He beats up another inmate during his escape from the pen and then goes on his murder rampage.  In following his stalking behavior the film feels too much like an exercise in misogyny and while its compelling third act conclusion satisfies its overall hard to watch as his victims are both horrified and helpless single women who come across as completely vulnerable.  Its a piece of grindhouse derangement thats not for the kiddies and though it hardly has any gore its also not for the squeamish due to the disturbed subject matter.  Sad to say, though, that this probably comes across as relatively tame when compared to many of todays regular television murder dramas.  2.75 stars but mainly for the films third act.

THE BRAIN MACHINE: Theres an interesting premise to this slow boil movie made way back when this was really a sci fi concept: can a machine predict and control our behavior and cause us to act in contrary ways to which we see ourselves; can we be manipulated by an artificial intelligence of our own design?  When five volunteers subject themselves to a machine that can read minds when fed certain information about the subjects it pushes them to their limits and exposes their darkest demons.  Trapped in a living situation where they can no longer get away from each other can be claustrophobic in itself but when the walls literally begin to move in on them will any of them escape with their lives, or their sanity?

An interesting premise but not executed especially well and the video transfer of the Alpha Video edition leaves a lot to be desired.  But its worth a watch if you're looking for some older low budget sci fi that doesnt rely on SPFX to convey its storyline.",1420156800,,2325,4.796992481203008

(spoilers) I love horror movies. I love B-Movies as well. Nothing makes my day more than a cheesy little film about zombies, monsters, murderers, that sort of thing. But to say that this movie was lacking, is an understatement. This movie was pure trash.

I decided to get it only because it looked like it could be okay. The story is pretty basic. Two doctors stick four people in an underground lab and start doing mental tests on them with these brain-machine computers. (Spare the constant ""beep-beep...beep-beep"" from any TV show.)

Nothing really happens. The film's first twenty minutes is about an escapee from the lab who has a file showing all that goes on. Apparently, these tests are pretty much illegal. He eventually gets caught and killed off. Then the four people (a war veteran, a priest, a girl, and some other guy) are tested on. It's all really boring until finally they all start going mad and either killing themselves, or each other, until the abrupt and pretty unsatisfying ending.

Once you see the cover art to this film of a zombie coming out of their cryogenic Mind Warp chamber, you'll think you were in B-Movie Horror Heaven. At least that's the way I approached this film. But boy, was I in for a shock. All and all, very disappointing

Really. It isn't very good at all. I found it in the horror section, and hopefully if you do, too, you will just see it. But it has nothing to offer.

Invisible Strangler (1976) Also Known As:The Astral Factor

Starts out well enough and then goes into complete foolishness. Sue Lyon's drowning scene is the only interesting part. We get introduced to characters only for them to die, unknowingly by an insane murderer who practised how to be invisible in his jail cell, complete with ""how to"" books.

If nothing else, the film is a veritable treasure trove of 1970's film overdrive. Perhaps that was the basis of the film's alternate title ""Invisible Strangler ""; nothing else would make any sense. As for myself, I'd like to consider a title suggested by the film's Dr. Risner's experiment, titled ""AVOID AT ALL COSTS"". It applies to the film's actors and viewers alike but it gets the 3 because I actually was able to finish this insomnia cure, and didn't have to leave in the middle.",1385510400,,2277,4.68922305764411
