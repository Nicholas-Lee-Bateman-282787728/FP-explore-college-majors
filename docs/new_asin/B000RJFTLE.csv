8201003,1,B000RJFTLE,"I have NEVER felt so compelled to warn people about NOT buying either of these movies.
I paid 3.48 Including shipping...for a double feature ...and I still feel Like I was robbed...

First let me very briefly, describe FLESH FREAKS.
This is half set in some place snowy(I think canada) but the first part is set in south america at the Maya ruins.
Thats where all the budget went. the ""ZOmbies"" were people with paper mache masks the size of a large pumpkin. The dang masks were almost as wide as the shoulders of the poor people who had to wear them. The acting was Terrible.
And it wasn't even a parody, they were trying to be serious, you can tell...And the camera, visual effects were F's
I realy don't want to spend any more time filling my poor brain with this movie...
The editorial review here on amazon say it won some sort of award...what was the competition, some 5 year olds making a movie with their dried out play-do? Worst zombie movie I have EVER seen...and I have watched lots from low budget indie to that Millionare bomb that was House of the dead...

As far as DEAD HUNTER..
Another bomb, but more watchable
I actually chuckled twice...
First was when a One legged old man on crutches took on 4 zombies...
He took them down in one case by htting the zombie in the nuts with his stump and another by grinding the tip of a crutch into the nads of a second(see a theme here)
Second chuckle came when one of the ""DEAD HUNTERS"" escaped a horde of the undead by putting on a rubber zombie mask that actually looked better that the makup/masks of the zombies themselves...he just put the mask on an walked through the crowd....Brilliant If you don't think about it for more than a second then it defies all logic...

Please , I hope you read this and DON'T Buy this unless your a film studies professor who wants to educate their students on how not to make a movie...",1328140800,,1881,4.399425287356322
8201004,5,B000RJFTLE,"Review for Deadhunters only: If you like ""so bad its good"" then this is for you. This is SOOO horrible but HILARIOUS!!! Plan a bad movie night with your friends and this is instant MST3K fodder. The dialogue, the camera work, the atrocious makeup, all look like the entire movie budget was loose change but this has the special charm that makes it loveable. If you enjoy cheese like Night of the Lepus, Killer Klowns, Santa Conquers Martians, etc then you should like this. It's no surprise that Lloyd Kaufman makes a cameo. Though this movie makes most Troma films look like Stanley Kubrick.

DH is silly, not mean-spirited, and tries to play it straight despite the idiotic scenes. At first I thought the makers of this train wreck were serious, which would actually make it more enjoyable, but after a while you can tell they were in on the humor.

WARNING: It is in Spanish and the subtitles are very poor. The yellow small font makes them hard to read. Also the overall image quality is very poor, though I bought mine at a dollar store.

SPOILER: I think the handkerchief scene elevates this film to 5 stars; though it ran a bit long and beat a dead horse. I haven't reacted to a scene like that since the infamous priest ""I kick ass"" scene in Dead Alive aka Brain Dead. Another bonus point is the makers paid an homage to Peter Jackson in the video store scene.

As for Flesh Freaks. I've tried to watch it but simply cannot. It's horrible in a bad way and I lose my patience. Looks like it was filmed with a cel-phone camera. Very boring though I should give it another chance.",1262822400,,1585,4.455172413793103
8201005,1,B000RJFTLE,"Only for the movie Deadhunters, a Spanish sort of film.

Put your hand on your chin, rest your elbow on your knee and that's how you watch this movie. Because it is boring. Deadhunters, a Spanish sort of film. Dare I call it film? It starts semi-ok, then goes horribly crappy. It has ok gore, but still substandard. Ugh!

Still, doesn't everything sound better in Spanish, even with the bad translation? At least this has somewhat better dialogue that `Dead Summer'! It starts out ok and then it deteriorates into crap. Watch this only for the music, it is a great metal rock soundtrack. Gothic feel in the costume design. It has bad bad bad acting, wanna be sexy crappy acting.

Just like the made-for-you-tube-`movies'.

Still bad movie, nice soundtrack, but badly placed. Really ok few songs in the soundtrack though. Feels like a video game around the end. And then the ...no words for that handkerchief scene.",1256342400,,914,4.765822784810126
8201006,1,B000RJFTLE,"These movies are so bad you need to see them for yourself.  Be prepared to waste your life and block your time between getting a root canal and getting audited.  It is that bad.  The pain will be lessened by the two events on the outside of the movies.  One good thing about this dvd is you get 2 bad movies to watch.  While the first movie blows chunks all over the place the second one is only horrible.  Watch them and see for yourself.

Wow, I gave this review a two to begin with.  I feel dirty now.  Excuse me why I go wash the stench of badness off me.",1248480000,,559,3.963963963963964
