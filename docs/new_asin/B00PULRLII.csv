6821836,4,B00PULRLII,"A horror comedy filled with chest-bursting zombie squirrels, mutant rage zombies dressed as bigfoot, and delightfully deliberate stupidity.
This B-movie gets a solid A+.  I love the gore and the zany creatures, and after a slow start the movie keeps stacking on the gore and lunacy more and more until the end.

With all the style and subtlety of a summer camp slasher combined with a strong sense of self-aware satire, Love in the Time of Monsters sweeps horror fans away to a land of laughter.  There are no scares to be had here--just gore and giggles.  I'll admit, I came in skeptical (and curious) and it took me a little while to figure out what kind of movie I was watching.  Just know this, I love horror comedies and I grew to enjoy this film more and more as it revealed its nature to me.

Marla (Gena Shaw; Insomnium) and Carla (Marissa Skell; Sorority Party Massacre, Slumber Party Massacre) arrive to some tourist trap family vacation destination in the woods with cabins, fishing, hunting and buffet dining.  Pretty much 'Murica!!!  The place is staffed by Lou (Kane Hodder; Wishmaster, Hatchet, Smothered) and his bigfoot suit-wearing entertainers.

The story takes root when one such furry entertainer is exposed to some contaminants.  Subsequently, the other four fully-suited entertainers (including Kane Hodder) become infected with some sort of virus-thingy-whatever that makes them get slimy, put on their bigfoot masks, and become belligerent jerks that chase all unafflicted humans and eat their human fleshsometimesit's not very consistent.  LOL.

Now that we've delved into flesh-eating and what I can only describe as ""mutant rage zombies"" we should address the special effects and the apparently low budget.  Whatever afflicts these bigfoot-costumed men is pretty simple to recognize by our now-hunted protagonists.  A dash of ooze on the face, a couple of wart clusters on their face or neck and, oh yeah, they're wearing bigfoot costumes.  But this silly premise and low budget seem to be something to celebrate rather than ridicule.  I was dazzled with glee when a bigfoot tore off a woman's head with a dangling spinal cord in tow.  It was sloppy and gory and it made me smile.  It's at about this point in the movie that I realized ""this movie isn't stupid, it's FUN.""  This film knows what it is and runs with it much to my pleasure.

All logic goes out the window in this film.  A favorite scene of mine is when a bigfoot ""sneaks up on a cop"" by bum-rushing him in the middle of an open area and then projectile vomits face-melting acidic bile all over his face.  Why can it do that?  No clue (well, it's quasi-explained later).  But it's a gore-slathered mess and I like it.  Afterwards we get a Romero-esque rubber gut-ripping display and another guy has his face torn off and eyes popped out.  Lots of gore.  Pure joy.

What's more is that this silly script and it's often lame lines are delivered strikingly well.  The acting rightly feels deliberately campy.  I roll my eyes and grin at the lines, but the lines are intentionally delivered in such a manner as to bring about that very reaction.  Everyone is hitting on everyone else, drug and alcohol placement is blatant, and some girl clumsily runs through the forest in high heels and lingerie.  Oh, right, and some murderous afflicted men are killing people in bigfoot costumes.  This is just plain silly.  This film clearly has no illusions of being taken seriously by viewers.  So if you're taking this movie seriously and thinking ""what am I watching and why am I watching it,"" you're doing it wrong!

All the characters have their overblown clich&eacute;s and the film is stitched together with one farced trope after another.  A favorite character of mine was the Sasquatch hunter Chester (Hugo Armstrong; Coherence).  He's weird and played with a straight face but has some of the funniest lines""A woman on the radio in the gentle forest silenceIt's like diarrhea in a kiddy pool"" and ""I couldn't leave you running around in the dark like that, soI shot you.""

There's a simple brilliance behind the bigfoot costumes.  Without them, we'd have slimy warty jerks as antagonists.  It would have looked stupid; it would have been stupid.  Lord knows I've seen enough lousy student films helmed by visionless filmmakers.  But with these silly costumes we are given something to laugh at and playfully mock instead of sneer at and hatefully criticize.

Speaking of silly, completely out of nowhere a doctor in a felt Abraham Lincoln beard (Doug Jones; John Dies at the End, Absentia) explains that the cause of the affliction is a combination of medical and pharmaceutical waste and some bacteria giving the men irregular strength and pain tolerance.  He explains that they will continue to get stronger, faster and meaner until they die from overcharging their body.  How Dr. Lincoln could know this is beyond me.  This was just another utterly ridiculous nugget that made this silly movie work in its own way.  Oh, and he can make an antidotebecause he's an expert in medicine, toxicology, pharmacology, and pretty much everything else and can conduct ground-breaking science in an hour with whatever is on hand at a vacation lodge in his office.

So far this movie is pretty fun, but there's room to grow.  But just then, in the spirit of Blood Glacier (2013) we encounter a mutant rage zombie moose, mutant rage zombie trout swimming upstream, and a flock of mutant rage zombie geese.  Again, these effects are not necessarily good, but they are abundant and easily ""good enough"" and most importantly they are FUN.  The real treat comes at the endmutant rage zombie squirrels!!!  They swarm lodge entertainer Brandi (Heather Rae Young; Chillerama), strip her naked while biting her all over, and make roaring sounds.  Then, as if combining ""The Cat from Hell"" (Tales from the Darkside: The Movie) with Alien (1979), one of them forces itself down her throat and then tears out of her chest between her breasts, ringing the dinner bell for the bigfoot gang to chow down on some bloody, gut-covered boobs.

Things are really getting out of hand at this point.  Then, out of nowhere, the ""real"" bigfoot shows up (with a moderately more convincing costume than the mutant age zombies) and battles the electrically charged Kane Hodder mutant rage zombie.  Then zombie raccoons, a moose and roaring squirrels show up for a final fight battle montage.  This is nuts.

This movie is loads of fun and the moment you think you've hit the climax of the excitement it gives you more zany, gory madness again and again.  Give this fine slapstick horror comedy a chance.",1436227200,,6653,4.866548042704626
6821837,5,B00PULRLII,"How fun!!  Like an earlier reviewer said, consider that this is a ""B"" movie, folks!  There was a budget and only 13 days to film.  This is the genre that was born for drive-in movie theatres and since the majority of those are dead and gone, there aren't enough of these movies made for us to enjoy anymore.  We have been spoiled by large budgets, professional soundtrack composers, writers, top billed actors, CGI effects, etc.  This was a fun, campy with the purpose of being campy style of movie that you can just kick back and enjoy watching.  With the zingy one-liners, witty characters and ridiculous ways to die, it reminded me a bit of those Bruce Campbell movies, only done better.  I noticed a nod to 'The Walking Dead' with the way one of the victims was being devoured by those mutant monstrous humans disguised as monsters.  The climactic scene at the end when our heroes lay waste to the mutated zombie woodland creatures was gold!  The comic book effect given to that sequence really drove it home for me since you get the sense of the chaos involved in both shooting that scene and what it might actually feel like if you were fighting off creatures that wanted to eat your face off!  Overall, I thought it was a heck of a lot of fun and I would recommend watching it for a night in :)",1435190400,2,1301,4.428571428571429
6821838,5,B00PULRLII,"Very cool movie! Really liked it...a mixture of comedy/horror type deal. Kane Hodder was Awesome as always and did a great job! Love anything that Kane plays in and really love it when he get's to do comedy. He is so good at comedy,but still is The Absolute Best Jason Voorhees,Victor Crowley ect there is. So if you haven't checked out Love In The Time Of Monsters you need to do so now! You will enjoy it and won't be disappointed! To all the cast and crew~ You guy's did a great job! Keep up the good work! Can't wait to see what's next!",1434758400,2,540,4.201923076923077
6821839,1,B00PULRLII,This is more of a zombie flick than Bigfoot. Zombies dressed as Bigfoot.  It would have been better if actual Bigfoot was in it for more than 2 minutes.,1434412800,,152,4.241379310344827
6821840,5,B00PULRLII,"This movie features Bigfoots (Bigfeet?), and the costumes look cheap and store bought... and that's the entire point! The Bigfoot costumes are actually costumes, bought for employees to wear at a run down tourist trap. This is a smart move by the folks behind the scenes, as it not only is a handy explanation for why the costumes look like they do, but it also allows us to get to know the characters before shenanigans go down.

Said shenanigans involve an odd virus infecting employees, customers, and wildlife and they become oddly zombie like. The acting is excellent, the editing sharp, the writing witty, and the directing strong. The movie breezes by quickly and is very funny and gross. Definitely recommended!",1433894400,2,719,4.9421487603305785
6821841,1,B00PULRLII,"What a complete waste of time.  The description sounded interesting, but i should have know the film's execution of the plot would
would fail.  Sometimes you have to give things a chance.  Very poor acting, poor costumes, poor FX, and overall just shallow character development.
WARNING!! STAY AWAY from this film.
WARNING!! Stay away!!",1433548800,,336,5.185185185185185
6821842,2,B00PULRLII,Very Poor.,1432944000,,10,4.5
6821843,4,B00PULRLII,"The acting is tight, with quick dialog delivered on time by a cast that brings their A game. Love In The Time Of Monsters stars Doug Jones, Kane Hodder, Michael McShane, Shawn Weatherly, Heather Rae Young, Gena Shaw, Marissa Skell, Paula Rhodes, Hugo Armstrong, Danny Vasquez, Paul Elia, Ben Palacios, Jade Carter, Zylan Brooks, Alex Sanborn and Bigfoot. The story is really does have a bit of everything mixed in with an almost slasher-esque atmosphere and setting, zombie/mutants, gore, comedy, even some boobs pop out in a Zombeavers like moment of bloody fun. There are a few moments where dialog falls flat, and characters step a bit over the line of authenticity but well over 95% of everything written and given in Love In The Time Of Monsters is just so on point and great that the flubs just don't matter much.

The special effects are, as I said, a big ole bag of practical awesomeness with blood, guts, and gore. There is a tiny bit of CGI that does cheapen a one or two moments in the film but considering Love In The Time Of Monsters is a film with flesh-eating mutants running around in Bigfoot costumes, zombie wildlife, and characters who seem too cool for school  in that comedy way, the CGI is not a big downer. Plus most of the effects in this thing are old school, organic methods of monster movie making that, thanks to killer directing, writing, and clever acting, give one entertaining viewing experience. The soundtrack and sound effects are pure energy. The hard rock, heavy metal soundtrack takes the atmosphere up a notch while feeling reminiscent of classic 80s horror.

The sound effects offer up atmospheric chills that are both dark and fun. Overall Love In The Time Of Monsters is a great indie monster movie. Even the real Bigfoot makes an appearance to save the day. He is a bit costume-y, but much like the animatronic critters and tongue-in-cheek dialog, it just works. This is a film that all of horrors fans, both the hardcore dark material fans and the horror comedy fans. Definitely check out Love In The Time Of Monsters, it is a film that you don't expect to be so damn good but it just is!",1431216000,,2132,4.649867374005305
6821844,4,B00PULRLII,"This movie contained exactly what I expect from a ""B"" horror movie with these types of actors. It has all the essentials- corny/funny dialogue, crazy creatures, questionable characters making questionable decisions, hot girls in tight clothing, and lots and lots of blood and gore, but almost in a laughable way.. I will say the prosthetics effects team did a great job! This movie doesn't have a large budget so don't expect any great revelations, just enjoy the ""B"" ride. When watching these types of movies with a smaller budget I recommend lowering your expectations, chances are you will enjoy it a bit more and your reviews won't be so negative. Its hard to make a film!!",1431043200,3,677,4.844827586206897

I would compare it to Return of the Living Dead part 2 (1988), Friday the 13th 3 (1982) , or Killer Klowns from Outer Space (1988). It also has Doug Jones (Abe Sapien, Pan's Labyrinth)",1426464000,3,429,4.797297297297297
