8199616,3,B000R9GMDI,"I didn't get the point of much of the symbolism in this film.  This work could have been done much better if it had been done much simpler.  I understand that the religious system called Christianity has perverted the gospel of Christ, and that message from Dostoevsky's book does come across.  Hence the three stars.  But in the main, I wish I had not bought this video.  Was not worth it.",1416873600,,390,4.436619718309859
8199617,5,B000R9GMDI,This is an outstanding film!  Words can not describe it.  I have watched it three times already and still feel that I am not grasping the entire message.  It is a must watch for thinking people!!!,1315008000,2,196,4.388888888888889
8199618,4,B000R9GMDI,"This is a compelling rendition of Dostoevsky's famous ""poem."" Through a complex interweaving of dramatic action and documentary footage, Beat Kuert rethinks the connection between power and love, group psychology and individual freedom. Playing the roles of both Christ and the Inquisitor, Giulio Broggi gives an effective, chilling, and haunting take on both characters.",1231632000,4,371,5.888888888888889
