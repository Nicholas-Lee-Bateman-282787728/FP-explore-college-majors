7938452,4,B00005J75W,"A COP [MARIO VAN PEEBLES] INVESTIGATES MURDERS THAT'RE LINKED TO A DEMON. IT'S A GOOD ACTION/HORROR MOVIE. IT'S COOL HOW THIS MOVIE KEEPS YOU WATCHING. HAS SOME GOOD MURDER SEQUENCES. I REALLY THINK ICE-T SHOULD'VE SURVIVED MUCH LONGER IN THIS MOVIE.
ICE SHOULD'VE GOTTEN MORE SCREEN TIME IN THIS MOVIE. BUT OTHER THAN THAT, THIS IS A GOOD ACTION/HORROR FLICK THAT SHOULD PLEASE FANS OF THE TWO GENRES.",1071532800,2,402,4.926470588235294
