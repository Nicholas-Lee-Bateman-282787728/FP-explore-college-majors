8591735,5,B00DCFD0CK,"As I have mentioned in some of the other reviews, there's a competing series called 42nd Street Forever (with commentaries in vols. 3 to 5). For this one, just about all of the trailers are new, with only one repeat and that came from this series' Vol. 6. The trailer selections are very enjoyable.",1390348800,,298,4.537037037037037
8591736,1,B00DCFD0CK,"With the bright, pastel-and-neon-and-black vibe of the 80s nostalgia wave finally wearing out its welcome (and being given a nice send-off in the forms of Drive, Hotline Miami, and assorted awful Kavinksy tracks), lots of folks are turning to the seedier, weirder side of 80s flicks - D-grade slashers and other straight-to-tape bargain basement fare. It's the guiltiest of guilty pleasures, but whoever's making these DVDs is cashing in on it in a pretty contemptuous way.

Let me get this out of the way: Yes, the trailers themselves are exactly what you'd expect: a mixed bag of various no-budget sci-fi/horror/family movie trailers taken from VHS and Betamax tapes. The problem lies in the fact that these are not actually *sourced from* VHS and Betamax tapes - not directly. No, these people had the audacity to rip every one of them from Youtube. I'm talking 240p stuff. Be prepared not for lurid color-bleeds and tracking lines, but big, nasty, glitchy cubes of digital distortion on every single trailer. The presentation itself shows they truly didn't care; the trailers are just tossed in with no way to actually select which ones you want to see, nor are they organized by genre or any other way. They spend a dime churning these things out, and you shouldn't repeat my mistake of spending a dime on it either. Do yourself a favor and just look them up on Youtube.",1377475200,5,1375,4.851063829787234

Montreal Film Studio has issued another in their Fantastic Movie Trailers DVD series. This one is #12 - VHS Rewind Tape 3, which means more painful trailers from the 1980s (and early 1990s)!  And of course, we mean ""painful"" in a fun way...love this whole series except the one with all the graphic grind-house stuff (of which there is plenty on this disc, hence four stars instead of five).

Here's the list of trailers included on this disc, along with a comment or two as warranted:

SuperBeta/FBI warning
Evil Toons (David Carradine, Arte Johnson)
Hobgoblins (featured on MST3K)
Excessive Force (Thomas Ian Griffith vehicle)
Two Evil Eyes
The Skateboard Kid (Timothy Busfield, Bess Armstrong, Dom DeLuise as the voice of the talking skateboard...yes, you read that correctly...)
Co Ed Oil Wrestling (exactly what it says, not a movie)
Evil Spawn
Honor and Glory (Cynthia Rothrock)
The Story Of Ricky (Aka Riki-Oh)(my other half says this is considered somewhat of a classic..really?)
RCA Videodisc blurb
Leprechaun (Jennifer Aniston)
Cut And Run (Willie Aames, Karen Black, Richard Lynch,and a host of other actors who should have known better)
Robot Jox (Gary Graham)
Ticks (Seth Green, Ami Dolenz, Clint Howard, Alphonso Ribero, Peter Scolari)
Knights (Kris Kristofferson, Lance Hendrickson, Nicholas Guest...WHY??)
Chunk Blower
Slime City
The Creepazoids
Dark Universe
George A Romero's Season Of The Witch (NOT related to the Nic Cage movie)
Return Of The Living Dead
Magnavox Magnavision ad featuring Leonard Nimoy (Fascinating! It looks like an early infomercial)
Excessive Force II - Force On Force
Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers
House 2 (Arye Gross)
Undefeatable (the hideous end fight scene has been featured on Tru TV's ""Worlds Dumbest"" series)
Nemesis (Tim Thomerson, Deborah Shelton, Jackie Earle Haley among others)
Young Lady Chatterly
Revenge Of The Ninja (Sho Kosugi classic)
Flesh Gordon Meets The Cosmic Cheerleaders
Dead Heat (Treat Williams, Joe Piscopo)
Leprechaun 3 (hey, what happened to Leprechaun 2, huh?)
Repo Jake (Dan Haggerty)
Cocaine Wars (John Schneider)
American Cyborg (Joe Lara)
Hostage
Hybrid
Zombie Death House (Directorial debut of actor John Saxon)
My Mom's A Werewolf (Susan Blakely, John Schuck, John Saxon, Ruth Buzzi and... MARILYN MCCOO? REALLY?)
Dreams Come True
All Star Bikini Arm Wrestling (Exactly what it says - not a movie)

As always lots of fun! Quality suffers on some of them, but that's to be expected, seeing as how they were taken from 1980s VHS or BetaMax videos. To me, worth the price just for the Magnavox Magnavision ad with Leonard Nimoy done between ""Star Trek - The Motionless Picture"" and STII-TWOK"" (the whole thing is on YouTube, I just looked). And as noted above, as Spock would say, ""Fascinating!"" And now we get the same thing on little compact disc sized DVDs...ain't technology grand? :-)

Thanks Montreal Film Studio - another great blast from the past!",1374537600,2,3139,5.5020746887966805
