7990875,3,B00009IB4N,"This DVD offers long segments of footage from Bruce Lee's movies from his youth.  Interesting to see for the first time, but not very entertaining to watch more than once.  One of the reasons for this is because the audio is just horrendous.  Bad English dub and it's hard to understand.  The original Cantonese version (with optional English subtitles) should of been used instead of the dub.  Picture quality is bad too, it has a yellow tint, probably needs to be remastered.  Also, lot's of Bruce Li (most popular Bruce Lee immitator) footage scattered in between early Lee movie segments.  Seems like the production team use the Bruce Li footage to maybe try and fool people into believing that they are actually seeing the real Bruce Lee in action.  The extras are pretty good and probably the best part of the DVD.  One extra has Lee's students talk about Lee's home and daily life, while filming Lee's hang outs with a camcorder.  A good presentation of the Bruce Lee museum in China at Lee's ancestral home.  Rare footage of Bruce Lee as Kato with the Green Hornet, and Batman (Adam West) at a Hollywood type tv show.  Entertaining to see but, the picture quality and sound is horrible.  Last extra, is a demonstration of Lee's power demonstrated by a possible JKD student.  I wasn't too excited about this one.  Overall, the DVD is good to see, but it may not be worthwhile for everyone.  Needs work in quality and presentation.",1061510400,,1437,4.688
7990876,5,B00009IB4N,"This is for hardcore Bruce Lee fans only.
It has over an hour of childhood footage that is charming,but no action(the fights are supplied later by Bruce Li).
The English dubbing is excellent though.
Bonus materials are another story.
Audio commentary by Jesse Glover,Bruce Lee's first student is excellent. Audio qualty is not good though.
Mini docus on Lee's Seattle years and his ancestral home in China are different and absorbing.
Bruce Lee as Kato on the Milton Berle show is the stand out of this DVD.Amazing footage,but short.
I would recommend Death by Misadventure over this one.",1060560000,,588,5.010204081632653
