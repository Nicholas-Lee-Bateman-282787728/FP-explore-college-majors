1393103,5,B0000544LY,"This riveting film explores Glenn Gould's life through 32 short pieces that make up a cohesive representation of this complex genius's life.
The acting is brilliant as is the cinematography. You become immersed in Gould's world, bizarre as it is. Almost cubist in it's multi-faceted view of Gould's life, the film reaffirms our own understanding that our own lives also can never be truly told in a linear way.",1042502400,4,410,4.956521739130435
1393104,5,B0000544LY,"When I watched this movie for the first time I had a small working knowledge of the genius of GG. This film really puts Gould's life, eccentricities and passions into a delicious nutshell. The 32 films represent a life in variations (after the Goldberg Variations: aria and 30 variations of the ground bass and aria recap). Other reviews will argue that _32 Films About Glenn Gould_ is too sporadic and uncentered, and not without justifiable ignorance. When I first saw this film I was overwhelmed by the amount of subject matter covered in such a short amount of time. Some of the sections didn't make a whole lot of sense to me at the time either. What I can tell you is that each vignette does have real meaning and attachment to the artist. In my studies since I have discovered nearly all of the connections. Any movie that can inspire you to search for more knowledge and enjoyment can only be good. If you love movies about music you will not be disappointed. Other reviewers have also argued that this is not an authenic biography about Gould. But to say that the deviations are so great as to render the movie invaluable would be a big mistake in this reviewer's opinion. Oh, by the way, this is also, without a doubt, the greatest soundtrack ever assembled for any movie. I say this not because of the material (though one could certainly make that arguement), but how the music is presented with the images on the screen.  I defy anyone who watches this movie not to, at the very least, be tempted to purchase it.",1008720000,13,1525,4.545454545454546
1393105,5,B0000544LY,"What it isn't is a film bio/documentary. In a pointillistic, fragmentary way the filmaker allows you a sense of who Glenn Gould was in a way that I think Gould himself would have been pleased with given his own modus operandi in his radio scripts: the interaction of many voices- tiny fragments making a larger idea clearer in a way that a more prosaic approach would  have failed. Best enjoyed by people who have at least a passing knowledge of who he was but an interesting and moving film by any standards. As noted by another reviewer here: more than the sum of its parts.",1001635200,11,576,4.485714285714286
1393106,5,B0000544LY,"I have played and loved the piano since I was a child.  Gould has always been an enigmatic force in my musical landscape.  Brilliant, at times amazing, but always somehow distant.
There is no getting around his brilliance (genius is not wrongly used) and the power of his musical personality.  But then there are also those interpretations that are just beyond eccentric.  However, I can't help listening to them and learning from his playing.  His playing is compelling even when I disagree completely - sometimes angrily.
This wonderful movie uses vignettes to tell the story of Gould, well, impressionistically.  It is like a movie by Degas.  A simple narrative about him would be so much more misleading.
I don't pretend to be a scholar on Gould or to even know much about his biography.  But this movie lets us hear his music as well as catch some of his life.  I particularly loved #6 Hamburg because it works on many levels and tells us many things about a view of Gould.
The only thing I wish is to see something like this done with footage with the real Gould.  It wouldn't be as poetic, but somehow seeing the real Gould responding to music is better than even the best acting.
Just terrific!  Thanks.",998352000,7,1211,4.63849765258216
1393107,5,B0000544LY,"Eccentric, brilliant, paranoid, reclusive, and recording vampire of the night.  The words have often described Gould's life.  This film weaves documentary pieces, narrative, performances into a quite unusual film.",987984000,,213,6.310344827586207
1393108,2,B0000544LY,These are short pieces of movies about Glen Gould not paino music performences.  You don't see any real Glen Gould playing piano in this DVD.  In that regard I am dissapointed or I might have been misled to think these are some documentary films about Glen Gould.  Actor Colm Feore's performences in #6 Hamburg and #9 LA Concert are two of the interesting pieces to see.  But in my opinon this DVD should not be listed in the Musucal and Performing Arts category where most people buy DVD's are ofter watch the performences again and over again such as Glen Gould's Goldburg Variations.  I centaily will not watch this DVD again.,983145600,6,629,4.63063063063063
1393109,5,B0000544LY,"This is a wonderful film. It has introduced me to Glenn Gould after I had been studiously avoiding him due to a purist ""authentic performance"" buff's dislike of Bach on the piano. Many wasted years. As to the film itself, it is not a documentary. It was never meant to be. Nor does it have a linear story line. It was never meant to have. It is a pastiche, a cinematographic collage using a theme. The theme is Gould and his relationships and we see the number of effects he had on people from a huge variety of the social spectrum. Really this is why it is like variations on a theme, and juxtaposing this to the Goldberg Variations (unique too in their own way, being the ONLY set of Variations Bach ever composed) is a masterful stroke. Judicious use of dramatic license portrays this obviously complex man in a very sympathetic light and with real cinematographic flair. The Hamburg scene so eloquently evokes Germany that I felt a momentary pang of ""homesickness"" (I lived there for 8 years). Masterful cinema, beautifully paced, varied and interesting. I must answer the typically america-centric view of one of the reviewers directly. There are two reasons why Yehudi Menhuin speaks French. 1)The film was made by Canadians and English is not the only language in the world, and 2)It is sonically more interesting to have a French interview at that point in the film. Far from struggling with his French I feel that Mr. Menhuin was struggling with ideas and concepts about a complex and confusing man and Mr Menhuins relationship to him. Masterful cinema....just think more about it",981072000,5,1589,4.760869565217392
1393110,5,B0000544LY,"It is a shame this DVD is out of print.  I have an old VHS which I've enjoyed immensely and would dearly love to get a fresh copy. The film offers a very unusual look at an unusual musician.  Gould always was a bit of a recluse, with a lot of strange habits.

Gould had an ear for a panoply of sounds as well as music, which is captured in the scenes of Gould listening into the talk swirling around him in a diner, which he later made into radio shows.  The short films capture a wide range of moods, summing up as best as one can Glenn Gould's enigmatic life.",1172620800,4,852,5.281481481481482

1393112,5,B0000544LY,"Colm Feore is excellent as Glenn Gould, and there is the film.  There are some wonderful musical interludes and visual interpretations, but Feore is the film.

Now, does the film cover every aspect of Glenn Gould's life? No.  But what biographical film ever does?  I've read a couple biographies, and some entertaining facets of Gould's life were missed.  The characters he created and performed as weren't even mentioned but his wit and warmth as a human being were expounded upon by people who actually knew him--now that is valuable, seeing and hearing the people who were touched by that great pianist.",1139270400,3,606,4.96039603960396
1393113,5,B0000544LY,"""Gould's passion and charisma cross all boundaries plus reach out and grab one by the throat.""  That quote by a reviewer sums up the sublime emotion portrayed in this film.  You can see the young Gould growing up and his passion for his music increasing exponentially throughout his relatively short life.  The movie, disjointed, fragmented and disorganized like the genius Gould, is a wonderful artistic statement of the man and his marvelous gifts to all of us.  I listen to his recording of ""The French Suites"" with awe and profound appreciation...and think what it may have been like to be this man, trying to live such an ideal life in such an imperfect and messy world.

As an old folk lyric in the song ""Vincent"" proclaims, ""This world was not made for someone as beautiful as you.""  Glenn was truly a beautiful soul.",1133827200,3,824,4.7272727272727275
1393114,2,B0000544LY,"I like Glenn Gould.  I didn't care for this movie however.

1)  The actor does not look like Glenn at all in my opinion, which I find distracting.

2)  Its very disjointed, and a lot of the components offer very little insight about Glenn or his life.  One scene was Glenn simply going into a restaurant and listening to other people's conversations.  Big deal, this is not interesting.  I know this was supposed to offer a subtle insight into his personality, but it's boring and it comes across as pretentious filmmaking.  Another example; Glenn is listening to a record with a cleaning lady.  Thats it. Why is this interesting?  Someone could film my uncle in Wal Mart, but would you care?  Hey, look...My Uncle Carl is buying batteries.  Now he is putting his change in his pocket.  How utterly profound....

In my opinion, you will learn and understand more about Glenn Gould by listening to his music than watching this lackluster, uneventful movie.",1129075200,8,955,4.773006134969325
1393115,4,B0000544LY,"Formalistically, this is an attempt at a fragmented, nonnarrative portrait of the life of the Canadian pianist Glenn Gould who is as famous for his eccentricity and his refusal to perform live as for his brilliant if debated recordings of works such as Bach's Goldberg Variations.  The Amazon official editorial review wonders if we learn more in this fashion than we would have with a more straightforward biopic and concludes, ""Probably not.""  I would, however, argue that a straightforward narrative probably did not suit the subject as well as the one employed in this film.  There is brokenness in Gould's life that a normal narrative would have obscured.  I have know a couple of souls who were geniuses in a fashion similar to Gould, and what was most striking about them was how poorly they meshed with greater societal expectations.  I think the method for the film was perfect for the subject matter.

This does not, however, mean that this is a perfect film.  Too many of the pieces are not especially moving, and I found my attention wandering in some segments while riveted in others.  For the most part, I found that I enjoyed any scene in which Colm Feore, who portrayed Gould, appeared.  His is always a fascinating presence, and he did a masterful job of projecting someone you feel might have been Gould, though he dispensed with some of Gould's more arresting eccentricities, such as lowering his piano stool to the point where he was nearly sitting on the floor.

Unfortunately, in the end the film fails as a portrayal in any detectable sense of the life of Glenn Gould simply because it omits too much.  For instance, the film ignores or mutes many of Gould's less pleasant qualities, such as his notorious habit of simply not showing up for performances.  Or the enormous idiosyncrasy of a huge number of performances.  Because of the oddness of many of his interpretations, Gould would certainly not be ranked among the very finest pianists of his or any other generation.  Certainly he ranks far, far below not merely luminaries such as Rubenstein and Horowitz, but contemporaries such as Alfred Brendel or Byron Janis.  Was Gould a great pianist?  Possibly not.  Was he a fascinating one?  Without any question.  But I suspect in the end Gould fascinates more because of his personality and the eccentricity of his life than for his brilliance on record or in the concert hall.

This leaves us, finally, with the question of whether 32 SHORT FILMS ABOUT GLENN GOULD is a failed biopic or a successful fiction based on a famous real life musician.  I lean towards the latter, but I wouldn't debate too strenuously anyone who insisted on the former.",1094428800,19,2673,4.8307692307692305
1393116,5,B0000544LY,What an interesting collection of meditations on the stupefying musicality of Glen Gould. This pianist is from another planet. Classical music has never been so exciting to a rock n' roll fan.,1076716800,4,192,5.03125
1393117,4,B0000544LY,"Several reviews of this DVD operate under the misconception that it is intended as a documentary or as a fictional re-enactment of some short films on Gould. It is neither.
The ""movie"" (by which I mean the integrated thirty-two vignettes) is an exploration of Glenn Gould (Pearl Harbour, Colm Feore, Storm of the Century), the Canadian-born musician who is considered to be one of the world's greatest pianists, an eccentric genius whose performance of Bach's Goldberg Variations was recorded and included onboard the Voyager space probes.
By no means a conventional biography, the film's episodes rarely attempt to pin down exact events or particular dates in his life. Exceptions include his interviews, radio broadcasts, and his final concert appearance. Rather, the film shows us phases and stages of his life, from his childhood to his career as a concert performer, his hobbies - the stock market, humour, travel, and experimental radio broadcasts - and his last days, when he complained to friends and relatives of his apprehension of death.
The aesthetic of the film is self-consciously arty, deliberately bizarre, and exceedingly concerned with crisp, polished sound - exactly like Glenn Gould.
It runs for 100 minutes or so, which means each vignette should have an average of 3 minutes. In reality some of them are 1 minute long, and other more key sequences (like one where Gould is at a truck stop) are of 5-6 minutes duration.
Very worthy purchase if you are familiar with or interested in the quirky but brilliant musician.",1058659200,10,1538,5.08300395256917
1393118,5,B0000544LY,"I first showed this to my students five years ago in one of those ""after the holiday concert slump"" moments.
At first, the seventh grade students were restless, similar to the German hotel chamber maid whom Gould forces to listen to his newly arrived recording.  At the same moment she becomes riveted, the students became riveted.  I showed the video over two days.  After that, students were curious about Gould and his life and work.  With the advent of the suggestion that Gould suffered from Aspberger's Syndrome (a neurological disorder with similarities to autism), some of my students were interested in learning more about people with this disability, especially their afflicted classmates.
I do need to stress, both to my students and even to some adults, that this is not truly a documentary.  It is an art film.  The man playing Gould is not Gould himself, but the actor Colm Feore.  Many of the other people interviewed are truly portrayed by themselves, including Gould's piano technician, friends, and violinist Sir Yehudi Menuhin.  Even with its questionable historic accuracy, it is a wonderful introduction to the works of one of the most highly regarded musicians of the last century.",1044921600,19,1203,5.040404040404041
1393119,4,B0000544LY,"I was expecting a documentary of Glenn Gould, ie, with exclusive footage of Gould, short interviews, etc. What I got is a 'film' about Gould acted out by another person, Colm Feore. For those who are not familiar with this film like me, please be aware of this fact before you buy it. Otherwise, this film is tastefully done, employing Goldberg Variations to link the different segments together. One extra note for those using a region-free DVD player: this DVD works fine on both of my region-free DVD players (of different brand names).",1042588800,3,539,4.806451612903226

7930741,5,B0000544LY,"This is a film you either love or are left cold by.  This film acknowledges the dictum that ""talking about music is like dancing about architecture"" and it opts for a different approach to telling its story.  The film, Thirty two Short Films... invites you to go on a journey with it, musing and meditating about Glenn Gould, about genius, about normality, about the impossibility of being totally known by others, the universality of loneliness and the direct, immediate connection to and among disparate souls that music makes.  I have quirky taste and I love this film.  And I love, in tandem with this film, The Silence Before Bach which reminds me of Thirty Two.. in various ways in its ability to recognize when words fail and seeking images in response to the music and the life which gave rise to unique interpretations of and engagement with the music.",1317945600,,861,4.758389261744966

7930745,5,B0000544LY,"This is a great film. Well, that's the review over with! Does anybody know when this film will be reissued on DVD?",1210032000,,114,4.2272727272727275
7930746,5,B0000544LY,"To dismiss Glenn Gould as a neurotic or eccentric is quite missing the point. While he was these things, he was also much more. Gould was likely one of the finest interpreters of J.S. Bach on the piano in the last 50 years. His musical output is mammoth and his technical skill almost unsurpassed. Gould is a fascinating character. Having difficulty with personal relationships, Gould left his sizable fortune to his cats. Leaving this earth too early, Gould's legacy is still felt in the musical world and will be for many generations to come.

This movie is a fascinating entre into Gould's world and into his mind. For anyone who enjoys Gould's music this movie is derigeur.

While Gould is played by an actor in the movie, Gould certainly is playing the piano. Sergei Eisenstein the great film director once said, ""One should be able to see the music and hear the image."" This film about Gould lets that happen.

Done in short mini-films, 32 Short Films combines to create an image of Gould much like a Bach two- or three-part invention disc does for Bach's masterpiece. Separately, each stands alone and has value and import but together a new, vivid and complete unit is formed.

Gould is so brilliant and talented-- yet self-absorbed, that he practically lives inside his head. The movie shows him having difficulty, as many brilliant artists do, in interacting in a satisfying way (to themselves and for the other) with other people. But there were moments when all the walls fell away, and all the neuroses pushed aside so that a real, yet brief connection could be made with another. There is such a moment in this film and for me it was the highlight.

In the most beautiful sequence of the movie, Gould is in a hotel in Europe, Germany if I recall correctly-- the land of Bach himself. He is preparing for an evening's concert and has just received by courier the brand new pressing of his newest Bach LP. It is a lovely day, Gould is silent and preparing. A maid enters his room, she doesn't appear to know that the man in the room is Glenn Gould, likely the greatest pianist alive on the planet at that time. He asks her if she would like to hear something. He places his brand new LP, Bach piano, on his record player and puts the needle down. The disc is spinning... stunning piano music is heard.

The maid is shown almost in a dream a kind of reverie as she glances out the hotel room overlooking the German city, transported by Bach music played so superbly on the piano. Gould lets the woman enjoy the moments as he watches her reaction in silence. She glances from the window and the realization that it is Gould himself who is playing the piano on the recording arises in her eyes. It is a beautiful moment. The maid is humbled and completely appreciative of this gift that Gould has just given her. She says, ""Thank you."" I have never seen a ""thank you"" delivered by any actor on film seem so meaningful and important as that one. This is what Bach does to people who care to listen... Bach transports you.

When played by a pianist such as Gould, it's only a matter of time before Bach grabs your imagination and soul and takes you on a grand journey. Gould seems almost a channeler more than a virtuouso pianist. One can almost see the master standing over Gould as he plays whispering to him. Perhaps this is why Gould is often heard on his recordings humming-- perhaps Bach is just too close.

The world is a lesser place with Gould not existing in it, playing for us, bringing Bach alive through his awesome talents. But, for a few minutes, with this movie-- we have him back in all his glory and fascinating eccentricities. Bravo!",1207180800,12,3659,4.550151975683891
7930747,5,B0000544LY,"Perhaps you are a Gould devotee or perhaps one with little patience for his many oddities or the cult-ish devotion showered upon his legacy.  For either case this biopic tastefully illuminates some of his major obsessions and choices:  the decision to stop performing in public, his self-important opinions on the role of the artist in society, his delirious love of music and the sharing of it...

This amalgam of short vignettes sidesteps the many trappings of cinematic film bios.  Gould is never sentimentalized and the filmmakers never try to embellish or over-interpret the fact that Gould's personae was, and remains, a difficult nut to crack.  The short films recreate significant moments in his life, interviews with associates, and more mundane events that nonetheless sparkle, such as one in which Gould prompts a housekeeper to listen and ultimately engage in this music.  By the end you feel you know something more about him, yet you hardly know him, a truth many film bios feel an urge to manufacture their subject's motivations.  Indeed, the lead actor is never shown playing the piano.  More importantly, you feel Gould's connection to the music, and its infectiousness will make new fans of many who see this.  And hearing him play the Goldberg Variations (1955) is one of life's great joys, right up there with seeing Yellowstone or Yosemite valley.",1181952000,3,1368,5.071428571428571
