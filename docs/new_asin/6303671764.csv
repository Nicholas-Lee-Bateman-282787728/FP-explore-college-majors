The style is more anime like (then again, it was animated in Japanese studios)The characters & storylines are complex & its important to watch the stories in order because they all end up connecting.
The quality of the animation is fabulous, heavy shading, not fast & jerky, very undisney-like. The voices match the characters perfectly, not corny in the least! Not irritating singing!
If you love fantasy, complex stories, inter-racial romance, & Shakespear, you'll LOVE this series^o^",1070150400,4,633,5.038095238095238
