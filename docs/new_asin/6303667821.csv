699641,5,6303667821,"Spanning three generations, ""My Family"" (""Mi Familia"" in Spanish) is fascinating account of one family's struggle to stay together and survive the mean streets of East Los Angeles. Narrated by Edward James Olmos (""Stand & Deliver""; television`s ""Miami Vice""), the film centers on a Mexican-American family who want to achieve the American dream, however they face obstacles along the way.
The film, directed by Gregory Nava (""Selena"") is an honorable, beautiful, and tragic masterpiece that captures the essence of what it is to be Latino in Southern California. Using realism and incorporating local and Mexican slang, Nava, along with writer Olmos provide the viewers with close yet a distant relationship with the family.
Many actors, including Scott Bakula (""American Beauty""; television`s ""Quantum Leap""), Esai Morales (""La Bamba""; ""Rapa Nui""), Michael DeLorenzo (television`s ""NY Undercover"") and Lupe Otinveros (""Selena"") lend their wonderful artistic support to this film, however the real scene stealer here has to be Jimmy Smits (""Old Gringo""; television`s ""NYPD Blue""), who plays younger brother Jimmy. Jimmy, who gets released from prison finds himself helping his sister, who was a former nun, in preventing the deportation of a young Salvadoran woman, who faces death if she was to return to war-stricken El Salvador. While he is coerced in marrying her, he believes it is only a short-term marriage. But when these two accidental-lovers get together and discover the beauty and support they lend to one another, love is here to stay.  However all happy stories come with their tragic endings and Smits carries this film through most of its final stages with his effective acting.
Whether it is dealing with intercultural marriages, street gang violence, or the everyday fears many illegal immigrants face each day with deportation lurking around the corner in some cases, ""My Family"" is an excellent portrait of how important culture and family are among Latino households. This is a must see film for anyone interested in Latino Studies. An excellent film and an eternal classic, ""My Family"" is a stunning film that should be watched by all who want to understand the history, legacy, and contributions of America's fastest growing minority group.",969753600,90,2263,5.338935574229692
699642,5,6303667821,"First impressions of sweeping epics are usually mundane; not so with MY FAMILY. This movie really grabs your heartstrings. It speaks to every nationality, not just Mexicans.  It's filled with raw emotion, love,  loyalty and the trials of lives sometimes filled with nearly insurmountable  odds. All performances were memorable, but especially Jimmy Smits' who  gives a searing performance as Jimmy, the youngest son. By the film's end,  you will be compelled to take stock of relationships in your own family,  appreciate the ties that bind and the power of forgiveness, then thank God  for His blessings, both big and small.",946425600,7,625,5.19

699644,5,6303667821,"My Family chronicles the Sanchez family over three generations.  From the parents migration from Mexico to East LA.  The movie shows the struggle of the Immigrants to survive in America with the lack of education, but a  determination to improve their lives in America.  The family is split by  the cynical views of the rebel sons Chucho(Esai Morales) and Jimmy(Jimmy  Smits) and the political views of the NUN(eventually marries) sister and  her also political (former priest) husband, and the educated lawyer  brother, who is engaged to the white girl from UCLA and is slightly  embarrassed when his future in-laws visit EAST LA.  All the time the  Sanchez family is struggling with their lives Jose and Maria try to keep  the family together.  The movie trys to show the diversity that can occur  in the lives  of this mexican/american family and the culture associated  with a typical family of that ERA it  illustrates some of the hostile  feelings felt by this familiy of their perceived prujudices against them by  the establishment.  The characters all go thru some transformations as they  mature.  James Olmos as the oldest son Paco and his narration is the movie.  Esai Morales and Jimmy Smits turn in some brilliant performances, and my  wife swoons at every scene with them both. They have mastered the 50'S/60'S  Pachucos roles. The allstar cast of LA Latin Actors Enrique Castillo,  Morales , Olmos are excellent as always  and aptly supported by Mary  Steenburgen and Scott Baculla as well as the other latino actors Lupe  Ontiveros Jennifer Lopez and others.  If you are of thAt ERA and ethinic  background this movie is a must.  Its a great family movie and just as  awakening as AMERICAN ME AND ZOOT SUIT.  In closing, being of that 50's era  and my Mexican background I especially enjoyed the generous portions of the  slang and music references throuhout the movie to recreate the way it was  back then, and referencing an actual artist Rosie and the originals  (Jeanette Jurado of Expose) was  genius on the part of the director/Author  Mr. Nava.

7852536,4,6303667821,"I had to watch this in a college course i was taking.  I enjoyed the movie.  My Family/Mi Familia describes the tale of three generations of an immigrant family's troubles and achievements. Maria and Jose, the first generation, come to Los Angeles in the 1930's, meet and marry, and then they face deportation. They establish their family on the east side of Los Angeles, and their many children Chucho, Paco, Jimmy, Memo, Irene and Toni.  This story starts with the father of the family, Jose Sanchez, who makes a one year journey on foot from Mexico to Los Angeles in order to track down his long lost brother. Once he gets there, he meets and marries the love of his life, Maria.  The two of them begin a family and the stories of their children begin to develop.  These stories involve Chucho who gets involved in gangs and has to deal with his father for his constant troubles with drugs and the police.  Jimmy begins to follow in the footsteps of his older brother but eventually realizes that he needs to think about the future and that this way of life will not cut it.  As the second generation become adults in the 60's, the focus of the story shifts to the son, Jimmy, and tells the story of his marriage to Isabel, their son, and Jimmy's journey to becoming a responsible parent.  This story shows the life of a family that sticks together through adversities, through crime, gangs, prejudice, no matter what they are faced with, they will be a family.",1137456000,3,1464,4.561068702290076

7852539,3,6303667821,"The movie depicted the stereotypical life style that people view Latinos as who are of Mexican ancestery and live in East Los Angeles.  Having been raised and growing up in East Los Angeles, I see some of the humor, vugarism and traditions that this story tells.  Everyone may not agree with what they see and hear, but once has to live and experience in order to understand...not necessarily agree.  I think the movie depicts a Mexican family who goes through the ups and downs of being simply a minority group.  Los Angeles is a diverse city and all cultures clash so I think this movie depicts the family clashing with others.  Of course it does go into the ""poor me, I'm a Hispanic"" routine but unless you experience what it is like living in a multicultral city as Los Angeles and having to deal with all colors and greeds, then you would understand what it's all about.",1039651200,5,875,4.547770700636943
7852540,5,6303667821,"I am a non-Hispanic who stumbled upon ""My Family"" by chance; I had heard about it from reviewers Ebert and Roeper. The effect this film had on me was unprecedented.  I was moved and delighted beyond measure by its artistry, its story, and its performances.  ""My Family"" transcended other films of its genre, such as ""Avalon"" and ""Sunshine,"" because its power and beauty make it the best representation of family ethnicity ever displayed on film, and its universality is sublime.
The film is beautifully photographed, filtered through a haze of color which brings to mind precious memories.  It is both mythic and realistic, with scenes that seem like archetypes of family love and tragedy.  The beginning is humorous and poignant, where the hero Jose Sanchez learns of the existence of ""another country"" on the other side of the world.  The love and family joy of the married couple, Jose and Maria, are marred only by the intolerance of government bureaucracy and the culture clash experienced by their children.  The gorgeous costumes, haunting folk music and period songs, and the magnificent colors of the interiors of the family home, all combine to make the film indelibly rich.  The tragic moments are deeply engraved on our consciousness by that brilliant filmmaker, Gregory Nava.  The conclusion, in which Jose and Maria state their gratitude for their wonderful life together, in spite of heartless tragedy, is transcendent.
The fine performances have been heralded by many critics, but I would like to recognize one in particular.  Elpidia Carillo, as the tragic Isabel, is deserving of an Academy Award.  In addition, Jennifer Lopez and Jacob Vargas as the young Jose and Maria are admirable.  The magnificent starring turns of Jimmy Smits and Esai Morales, aided by Eduardo Lopez Rojas and Jenny Gago, are unforgettable.  Everyone who worked on this fine film did a superb job; they made it more than a movie, but rather an experience that permanently warms and expands the heart.

7852541,5,6303667821,"The cinematic masterpiece Mi Familia captivates the reality of challenges that the traditional immigrant Mexican family has to go through. This production is amoung the best films for portraying the many sides and historical events in a typical Mexican family. The film gives a very important message that characterizes a traditional Mexican family, which is that love and unity of the familia can overcome many obstacles.  From the beginning of the film the director Gregory Nava, shows us the historical background of all Mexican families. He shows the typical ""indio"" crossing the border with hopes for a future. This ""indio"", Jose Sanchez, hopes to begin a new life and family with Maria, a woman who he fell in love with in Los Angeles. As time goes by Jose and Maria start a family who they love and care for. As the family continues to grow emotionally and mentally, each one of them find themselves with their own obstacles to overcome. The character ""Chucho"",  portrays  a situation that often happens in ""el barrio"" these days. He shows the typical ""pachuco"" (gangster) getting in trouble because defends his dignity and his family name. As a result of a confrontation with a rival gang leader, Chucho gets in trouble and runs from the police.  He is discriminated by the police, and killed.  The death of ""Chucho"" leaves a scar on the family forever. Jimmy, the youngest son, is the member of the familia who gets affected the most.  He becomes a ""Pachuco"" just like ""Chucho"". This rebellious change is a cause of the anger that he holds inside of him because of the discrimination that his brother suffered from. Jimmy goes to jail a couple of times, however, his parents always show their love and support through his tough life that is full of resentments.  Most Mexican Familias hold feelings of resentment and anger towards the US governmental system because of all the challenges that a familia has to go through from the first time that we step on US territory. Mi Familia shows the struggles of the familia from the beginning of time with Jose's journey to US territory. Once on US grounds he searched for one of his lost family members in search for support and love. His uncle ""El Norteno"" gave him that family love and support and helped him get settled in the US. This shows the unconditional family support that the familia has towards one another through thick and thin. This support is very important specially when you are trying to settle a family in the US. There are many rules and regulations that immigration has towards immigrants, therefore most of the transactions are done illegally. Once settled here, most familias choose to clean up their record and become legal residents which starts to make their lives a little easier.  The history given in the film relates to many Mexican families. Maria is a very important character that symbolizes the frustrated immigrant taken away by the government. She gets deported back to Mexico and is forced to leave her family for a year. Her belief in her own strength and love towards her family is the only thing that gives her hopes for success in the odyssey she had to take in order to return to her loved ones.  Although the American society did not pay as much attention to this film as the Chicanos in America, it still received a lot of awards and recognitions by the Latinos. This film shows us the real lives of your everyday Mexican family, therefore, making it very easy for anyone to get in touch with their Latino side. Specially now, that almost 1/2 of the population in the US is Latino in one way or another, films like this are more respected. Overall, this film is one of the best films ever made and that gives its audiences real characters and real live situations that any immigrant can relate to.
