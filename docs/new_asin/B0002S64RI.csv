2116685,1,B0002S64RI,"The dialog is abysmal.  The acting is hammy, and rigid.  This story could have had some promise, the acting and directing completely destroyed it.",1379289600,,146,5.041666666666667
2116686,5,B0002S64RI,This product was just as it was on television.  My wife fell in love with it and wanted to purchase it when it was available.  The music and the southwest theme makes the theme of the movie.  In my opinion you should list Victoria Principal as the mail actor instead of Hector Elizondo who was a supporting actor.,1286150400,5,313,4.362068965517241
