Otherwise, it is very thorough and comprehensive.
Thanks.",1426204800,,131,5.285714285714286
8219937,4,B000VTVA04,"A video of picturesque still life images of colonial sites and wares accompanied by the sound of occasional horsedrawn carriages, a door creaking, clanking of fireplace cooking, harpsichord music, etc.  With the introduction of each segment or chapter, if you will, there was a zoom on the plaque of that particular historic site, then the tour into the building began with the still lifes. Faded overlays of transitioning images were creative in areas such as showing 18th C. portraits through windows, etc. as if to remind us that they were once there.  However, after a while, I found the slow fading in/out to be fatiguing on my eyes and had rather wished that they'd just click to the next image or find a different means of transitioning.  There was no narrative accompaniment which may be important to some potential buyers.  My motivation was not so much to be educated on any particular site.  Rather, I was merely seeking visual entertainment, which this is indeed.  Being a still life artist and enamoured with all things of the 18th century, I found the photography to be absolutely beautiful and for that alone, I highly recommend this video.",1249862400,,1155,4.897435897435898
