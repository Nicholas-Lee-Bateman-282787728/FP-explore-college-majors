8085361,5,B000BD132A,"As a collector and fan of old classic mystery horror sci fi movies and TV shows I had never heard or seen this before until I caught it on
internet and has become one of my favorites! why hasn't this movie gotten more notice? It's a great gem of classic horror comedy. And
with Roddy McDowall and Stella Stevens and Elsa Lanchester [bride of Frankenstein] and Dr. Bombay from Bewitched TV show it's a
very good fun mystery horror movie! All it needed was Vincent Price to make it even better. I like that it's well written and fast paced and
even though there are many murders it's not bloody gore like most movie from 70's and done with style. It reminds me of Murder by Death.
I like the plot very well done and great ending. WHY ISN'T THIS ON DVD WITH ALL THE CRAP THEY RELEASE? AND WHY IS THE
DAMN VHS SO EXPENSIVE? I guess I'll have to watch the bad quality video on internet til I find a copy! A MUST HAVE HORROR FANS.",1459555200,2,924,4.196629213483146
8085362,4,B000BD132A,"ARNOLD opens w/ the unholy matrimony of Karen (Stella Stevens- THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE) and the non-living, coffin-bound title character. Karen has ""married"" Arnold, post mortem, per his request, in order to inherit his vast fortune, this to spite Arnold's former wife (Shani Wallis). Karen, as we discover during the reading of the will, is / was the only person whom Arnold trusted. His other ""friends"" and relatives include his daffy sister, Hester (Elsa Lanchester- BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, WILLARD), the ultra-smarmy Robert (Roddy McDowall- PLANET OF THE APES, THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE), Evan Lyons (Farley Granger- STRANGERS ON A TRAIN), and his mysterious, faithful servant, Dybbi (Jamie Farr!). Not altogether shockingly, these dastardly people start dying in terrible ways. No worries, as Constable Hooke (Bernard Fox) is on the case! Is Arnold somehow bumping off these odious humans from beyond the grave? Loaded w/ atmosphere, and devices- secret passages, paintings w/ eye-holes, etc., ARNOLD (1973) is a goofy, suitably cheeeze-filled horror / comedy, w/ a macabre sensibility. Expect nothing remotely serious, and you could have fun w/ this one!...",1451174400,,1160,5.4860335195530725
8085363,3,B000BD132A,"ARNOLD (1973) is a strange comedy/horror hybrid.

The film starts brightly lit with a funeral procession in heavy ground fog that proceeds over some creepy cemetery ground and into a gothic-looking chapel. Close behind is Stella Stevens in a bridal gown. She's surrounded by flower girls. They follow into the chapel as Shani Wallace sings the ""Arnold"" theme.

Arnold is a wealthy but deceased businessman. Miss Wallace is his widow and Miss Stevens his betrothed! The upset, somewhat inebriated presiding minister is Victor Buono. The marriage ceremony occurs during a thunderstorm without rain. Arnold's casket is propped up and his eyes open as his remains are married to Stevens.

Elsa Lanchester plays Arnold's scatterbrained sister and Roddy McDowall is his ungrateful and lazy son. At the will reading McDowall's left out entirely, and Wallis is equally shunned, but new bride Stevens gets the lion's share of Arnold's considerable estate. It seems obvious what will happen next but the story quickly goes in a different direction.

Also with John McGiver, Farley Granger, Bernard Fox and Patric Knowles (in his final picture), plus a heavily-disguised Jamie Farr as a sinister-looking one-eyed, one-handed Hindu servant named Dybbi.

If you think about the unsavory main premise any comedic possibilities are squelched.
It's OK entertainment otherwise.",1435536000,,1360,5.42654028436019
8085364,5,B000BD132A,"I saw this movie years ago at a Drive In. Never forgot it. It's very funny . Also very hard to find on Vhs. I was lucky enough to find it although it cost me $47.00 . With all the trash making it to DVD now,it's a damn shame they overlooked this gem...",1364860800,2,252,3.7735849056603774
8085365,5,B000BD132A,"Released in 1973, ""Arnold"" is a delightfully macabre black comedy that should've become a cult classic.

Here's the premise: the wealthy and recently deceased Lord Arnold Dwellyn becomes married--during his funeral--to his long-time mistress (Stella Stevens), after which he has willed his entire fortune to her under the condition that she remain faithful to him for as long as she should live.  Of course, this arrangement doesn't sit well with Arnold's greedy relatives and associates, and anyone trying to get his or her hands on Arnold's inheritance is disposed of in a creatively bizarre manner as a prepared cassette-recorded message plays for the intended victim.

""Arnold"" is full of witty moments and several great comic performances. Bernard Fox (Dr. Bombay from TV's ""Bewitched"") has many funny lines as the investigating constable who attempts to explain the deaths of each of Arnold's victims. Victor Buono (""What Ever Happened To Baby Jane?"") is hilarious as a skittish minister presiding over Arnold's combined funeral-marriage. Elsa Lanchester (""The Bride of Frankenstein"") is a hoot as Arnold's sister. Other cast members include Roddy McDowell as Arnold's brother, Shani Wallis (who also sings the strangely gleeful title song) as his ex-wife, Farley Granger, Patric Knowles, and Jamie Farr (as Arnold's silent, turban-wearing manservant).

Director Georg Fenady's other theatrical film credit was ""Terror In The Wax Museum"", released the same year as ""Arnold"" and featuring some of the same cast. Fenady was a veteran director for several television series (""Emergency!"", ""Quincy, M.E."", ""Baywatch"", etc.); he also directed two Irwin Allen made-for-TV disaster movies, ""Hanging By a Thread"" and ""The Night the Bridge Fell Down"".

Some compare the style of this movie to the cult classic ""The Abominable Dr. Phibes"", but for fans of low-budget and campy black comedy, ""Arnold"" more than stands out on its own. It more than deserves to be rediscovered and preserved on DVD.",1341964800,4,1991,5.409677419354839
8085366,5,B000BD132A,"I have been looking for this movie for at least 5 years, my mother said that she had seen it in the 70s when it came out and she was looking to purchase it when she actually found a copy. Not only did I find it, it was also under 50$ and in working condition. very pleased with the buy, would purchase from seller again.",1338940800,,320,3.9384615384615387
8085367,5,B000BD132A,"Hot Stella Stevens and an all star cast attend the wedding of Arnold, who is already dead. Will everyone be killed by Arnold?

I saw this at a drive-in in the early 70's and never forgot it.

Enjoy",1178496000,4,197,4.157894736842105
8085368,4,B000BD132A,"I saw this in the theater around 1972. A rich man wants to marry his young mistress, but is blocked by his spiteful wife who refuses to grant a divorce, declaring that only death will end their marriage.

Oh, the things we do for women! The movie opens as the pallbearers carry the man in his coffin to the front of the church, stand it up next to his wedding-gown-clad mistress, pop a tape of recorded responses into the coffin's built-in tape deck, and signal the minister to proceed.

After the wedding ceremony, the body must lie in state in the home for several days, during which each of the family members and household staff pass the time trying to find his treasure for themselves before any of the others.

Remember the tape deck in the coffin? In a marvelous display of early 70's wireless technology, as each person in the house shows the deceased was right not to trust them the tape deck comes on and delivers a personalized message through one of the speakers conveniently located in every room. Essentially it's an ""I knew I was right about you!"" kind of thing, right before they meet a gruesome end in a funny making-the-punishment-fit-the-crime kind of way.

I remember this movie as being a lot of fun in a campy sort of way.",1157328000,6,1244,4.540178571428571
8085369,5,B000BD132A,This is an excellent movie. Its very creepy. Its about a rich man who dies and teaches his family a fatal lesson about real love and loyalty.  Its a very juicy and unique movie. Even the theme song is cheerful yet spooky.,1149897600,6,221,4.261904761904762
