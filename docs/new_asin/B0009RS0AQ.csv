8065694,5,B0009RS0AQ,"While I really liked this DVD I should give you fair warning that most of it is shot in Detroit, so it doesn't really give you an overall look at the 1960s. That said, the films are a great case study of what was going on in the city as the babyboomers grew up and the counter culture started to take hold. What's amazing is the huge contrast between the straight society people and the up and comming hippies. Both seem to exist in seperate worlds. It makes you really rething that period of history.",1153785600,,501,4.28421052631579
8065695,5,B0009RS0AQ,"Most of the documentary footage I've seen about the 1960s just shows you hippies and anti-war protestors, so I have to say that this series of documentaries is a breath of fresh air in what is otherwise a mundane genre. After all, not everyone could have been counter cultural in the summer of love, or there would not have been a culture to rebel against. The films all center around what normal middle class Americans who were not long hairs were doing in the 1960s and I particularly enjoyed the vintage Mardi Gras footage.",1147910400,,526,4.6063829787234045
