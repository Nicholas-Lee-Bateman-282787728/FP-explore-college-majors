7694585,3,B01CX1HVYG,CHEESEEEEE BALL MOVIE! Haha. This movie has it's mixes of good scenes and generic cheese ball scenes. They try to make Dominic Purcell look like this kick booty guy who doesn't talk a lot and doesn't take any crap. It doesn't work in half the movie. The fight scenes are low grade and at one point in the movie where the team is going through a training course shooting targets quickly makes me laugh. If you want to watch a halfway decent movie that drags on then this is for you. I hate it when movie trailers are better than actual movies. I'd save your money on this one and watch it when it comes out on something for free.,1466553600,5,628,4.241666666666666
7694586,4,B01CX1HVYG,"This was an indie movie, wasn't it? Very hard to tell. It was a great action movie.",1466121600,,83,3.9411764705882355
7694587,4,B01CX1HVYG,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

As with the video generation before it companies releasing DVDs straight to video has created a niche market for various stars. These stars have name recognition for some but perhaps not the majority of moviegoers. Thats a shame because many of them deserve better than they're getting, some doing better work in small budget films than many major stars.

One such actor is Dominic Purcell. His first major break that I was aware of was as the main nemesis of Wesley Snipes in BLADE: TRINITY. A year later he became more recognizable as Lincoln Burrows in the now famous TV series PRISON BREAK. More recently hes starred in the new CW series DC LEGENDS OF TOMORROW. But in between these items hes starred in a number of low budget action films and done a great job in each. Why hes not making a bigger splash is beyond me.

This week Purcell arrives in GRIDLOCKED. He plays David Hendrix, a SWAT team leader demoted to street cop and not pleased with that position. Worse yet he is now saddled with a temperamental bad boy young actor on probation after punching a member of the paparazzi. Brody Walker (Cody Hackman) is a stereotypical character here, the obnoxious brat styled young actor who had fame to fast and abuses it at every chance he can. As he tags along with Hendrix he wants to know more about when he can shoot a gun rather than take something useful back from their time spent together.

Hendrix is no piece of cake either. Resentful of being stuck with Walker he does everything he can to ignore him. That is until one night when Walker shows up at Hendrix apartment, six pack in hand and tries to call a truce. Hendrix breaks down a bit and takes him to the training facility for SWAT to show him what their real world is like.

Unfortunately theyve picked a bad night to do so. While Hendrix and his old squad are in the midst of an exercise, their own Hogans Alley test area, a team of mercenaries takes out the power and ignites an EMP cutting off any and all access to phones. As a gun battle follows the old guard at the facility Sully (Danny Glover) is shot and reveals to Hendrix what this group might be after. As the two teams go head to head, skirmish after skirmish the leader of the group is revealed, someone who has bad blood with Hendrix. Just who will survive this night remains to be seen.

Where the plotline of the spoiled and incompetent movie star partnered with a tough as nails cop has been done before the best thing about it here is that its used to put the ball in motion but isn't the centerpiece of the film. That makes it work so much better than expected. Instead the writers and director have chosen to make the film about the assault on the training facility filled with enough backstory to make it believable and involving.

Purcells character fits his appearance and skills as an actor. Hes an imposing figure to look at with a tough as nails attitude that oozes from every pore in each scene hes in. And yet there are moments when with just a subtle adjustment of body language or quick smile you can see there is more to Hendrix than meets the eye. Thats the sign of a good actor.

Perhaps the weakest character here is Brody. Hackman doesnt have the chops yet to pull off this character even though he gives it a decent try. As written the character is far too clichd and it would take someone with more skill to pull this off. Even Michael J. Fox in THE HARD WAY (1991) wasn't able to quite achieve it. When I read that Hackman was a five time karate champion before going into film I wondered why those skills were never used here. It might have made for a more interesting character.

The movie offers some great fight sequences, some over the top gun battles and a plot that may have a few holes in it but not enough to make it unenjoyable. The rest of the cast does a great job in their roles and for being a film on the low budget end every penny shows on the screen. Ive seen bigger budget films in the past year with more major special effects that haven't compared to this one. So if you're in the mood for a solid action film that will keep you involved from start to finish then give this one a shot. And keep in mind that Dominic Purcell is far better than the roles hes been getting.",1465948800,10,4307,4.367041198501872
7694588,4,B01CX1HVYG,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

I wasn't sure what to expect going into GRIDLOCKED, but I definitely had high expectations.  The film boasts an interesting cast, and several of the reviews I read made it sound like a high-intensity action film.  So, the bar was raised pretty high when I sat down to watch the film.  Im very happy to report my expectations were met and then exceeded with this movie, and I cant wait to see what director Allan Ungar does next.

I love good action flicks, particularly those with intense gun-battles.  GRIDLOCKED definitely delivers in this area, but it also contains a slick storyline that will keep you enthralled until the end.

GRIDLOCKED is shot well and looks great onscreen.  The production value appears high, and the HD quality of the picture is very appealing to the eye.  Likewise, the sound is crisp, and I greatly enjoyed the film in surround sound.

The acting is quite good, and I must confess I wasn't sure if Dominic Purcell could pull off a lead role like this.  Thankfully, he does a great job.  I enjoy seeing him in the lead, and I hope to see him in more of the same in the future.  Purcell is joined by a great cast that includes Cody Hackman, Stephen Lang, Vinnie Jones, and Saul Rubinek.

GRIDLOCKED does not contain many special effects, other than the firefights.  Those look great, though, and they offer an energetic foray into fun.  And when the action has subsided for a moment, the plot progresses at a nice pace.  As a result, the film offers a great viewing experience overall.

GRIDLOCKED is a win for me, and I recommend giving it a look.  It hits store shelves tomorrow, so make a note.",1465776000,3,1697,4.541254125412541
7694589,3,B01CX1HVYG,"Do you even know who this man really is? David Hendrix (Purcell) is a former leader of SWAT who is now working the streets. When troubled movie star Brody Walker (Hackman) needs to take part in a ride along to not only save his career but stay out of jail David agrees to take him. Personalities clash, but when the training facility is attacked David and the rest of the force must not only fend off the attackers, but deal with past issues that threaten everyone. There isn't really a whole lot to say about this movie. It is a predictable B action movie but does have some pretty good action and is entertaining all the way through. Purcell is becoming a pretty reliable movie star and his movies are usually exciting. This has shades of Assault on Precinct 13 but isn't quite as good. On the other hand with all of the low budget action choices this is definitely one of the better ones. Overall, nothing amazing and not anything to rush out and see, but it is entertaining and watchable. Ive seen worse from this genre. I give it a C+.",1465776000,,1040,4.393782383419689
7694590,4,B01CX1HVYG,"David Hendrix (Dominic Purcell) is a hard nosed NYC cop. He has the dubious assignment to chauffeur around movie star Brody Walker (Cody Hackman) who is doing community service for an assault on a reporter.  The bad guys were poorly developed but they do have Vinnie Jones. The police get held up in an archive building, where most of the action takes place. The plot mystery is revealed about half way through.

Cody was made to look like a cocky Brad Bieber Pitt, while Trish Stratus looks like Angelina. There was an awkward table scene where Purcell and Hackman converse, showing us they are better actors with their mouths shut. With Purcell as a good guy and Vinnie as a bad guy, we all know where this goes...it has to. Some light humor in the banter.

Who still has tube TV sets? No great twists. 3 1/2 stars

7694593,2,B01CX1HVYG,"Gridlocked is a fairly predictable movie where a tough guy NYPD cop is forced to babysit a moviestar who joins him for ridealongs, who he doesn't respect at all.  For some reason when the actor decides to turn up at the cops apartment (how he knew address isn't explained, I can't imagine a cop who kicks in the doors of drug dealers would have his address in the telephone book), but anyway the cop decides to take him to his former some sort of S.W.A.T. team firestation style of type place where they await getting called into action or something, I never really understood what this place was supposed to be, which is also a heavily secured compound. Of course Die Hard 2 style, some bad guys want to break in.  Sure it would have made more sense to start something a fair way away that will get the S.W.A.T. team dispatched from the compound before implementing their plan, but this one's main villain is ruthless rather than smart.

Gridlocked will pass the time but really it's not that entertaining  Danny Glover has a cameo where he does the ""Getting to old for this"" line from the Lethal Weapon movies.  There's plenty of bullets flying, for highly trained on both sides people, no one really seems to be able to hit anyone, and you can tackle someone out of the paths of bullets and things like this.  At one stage it seemed like someone was just flicking lights on and off for around 30 seconds. The movie doesn't really get into the whole spoilt brat child, now a self-entitled adult actor clashes with the tough grumbling to himself cop thing  much at all, the actor is pretty much an afterthought once the first bullets start flying in the compound.",1480291200,,1664,4.545150501672241

Yes, I know, Dominic Purcell only seems to do very low budget hack movies BUT this was very entertaining and lots of fun too. The Other performers are all okay, that's right just okay but okay in a good way. My one problem may have bee with Trish Stratus just because she was way to cliche'd. What I am really saying is that if you have some time to kill, check this out and be possibly pleasantly surprised because Dominic does the growly peeved guy very well.",1480118400,,869,4.54140127388535

This seems to be a growing trend for movie goers. I have noticed that as I walk down the movie isle at Walmart I see movies I haven't heard of or ones that never came to my local theatres. Some of these have actors or wrestlers I have heard of and for the most part are cheaper than the ticket price at theatres.  This is one. It is what Hollywood use to call a B movie or a movie that would be on the twin bill at a drive in movie. The plot is good guys defend a building against the bad guys and there is a mole in the good guy's team. That is it pure and simple. There is action and gun play and dead bodies. No moral, no cosmic idea, nothing but the desire not to bore the viewer.

I do highly recommend this movie.

The first thing that surprised me about this movie was Danny Glover in a lower supporting role.  Bummer.  He's a good actor.
The story itself is your basic ""spoiled actor kid"" (Cody Hackman) gets in trouble and has to do ride along with NYPD.  The cop (Dominic Purcell) who has the dubious duty of babysitting is a SWAT member who is out of rotation because he was shot.

He's taken to the training building to watch his team practice.  In the meantime a group lead by Lover (Stephen Lang, Salem) and Ryker (Vinnie Jones) enter to snatch  some good stuff and shut down the PD's computer servers.
