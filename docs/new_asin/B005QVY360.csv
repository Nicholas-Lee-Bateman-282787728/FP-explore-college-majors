8483837,5,B005QVY360,Very good tips for the beginner and easy to understand.  Some review complained that they didn't learn anything new from the video as it was too basic.  Basic and easy to understand is what the beginner needs to start out.,1461801600,,222,4.525
8483838,5,B005QVY360,This is a great learning tool.  I am so glad I ordered it.  Thank you for a good product & good service.,1436140800,,104,3.6818181818181817
8483839,2,B005QVY360,I'd say the title of my review says it all.  The amount of useful information in this DVD isn't nearly enough to justify the price they are charging for it.  On the actual driving and backing sections I at least expected some simulations and a LOT of examples.  Instead you get about five minutes of some retirees talking about how to have your spotter help you.  That's great if you have a spotter.  This DVD is a total ripoff.  You could find as much info in a couple of free YouTube videos as you get out of this ridiculously priced DVD.,1359331200,7,540,4.297029702970297
