7900604,5,7885142868,"After reading some bad reviews I was very skeptical about this movie.
But clearly it delivers very accurate, and unbiased history.

I strongly object the idea that this film is a propaganda.
First of all, it never puts the Chairman Mao to the first place.
Doesn't emphasize Deng XiaoPing at all.
If it it had been a propaganda, these two figures would have stolen the whole movie.

It only delivers the real conversations, events, and nothing but the facts.
You can read all these not only from the Chinese archives but anywhere from wikipedia to history books.

I do accept the fact that there are way too many characters to follow and too many key conversations that played great importances in the history but if you really pay attention, you never lose the track.

I recommend watching it alone, even then you might need to pause and rewind. In some scenes you can't follow the subtitles due partly you need to read the legends that explain the date, location, and historic figure's name etc.

If you'd like to know how, when, and why the Chinese went into the civil war, this is the history 101.

In terms of film making, the acting is good, filming, lights, costumes and everything you can think of is good.
Another 5 star movie from China.
I really enjoyed it, and strongly recommend it if you liked any of the following: Red Cliff, Warring States, Three Kingdoms, Warlords, Assembly, Founding of a Republic, and 1911.",1327536000,7,1425,4.68
