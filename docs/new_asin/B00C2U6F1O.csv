5689132,5,B00C2U6F1O,"Scientists, academics, skeptics have long cried out to metaphysical people, ""Show us contact with spirits in the afterlife that can be repeated.""  Paul Davids ""The Life After Death Project"" shows it being performed in a university laboratory--and it is repeated.  It blows away all those so-called ghost-busting hunts around haunted prisons, hotels and castles that never seem to come up with any full blown evidence on film.
The Life After Death Project should tickle the heart of movie-goers, skeptics and ardent believers alike. When he was alive Forrest J. Ackerman became a legend for his Famous Monsters magazine that followed luminaries such as Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi, George Pal and that host of space movies such as The Day the Earth Stood Still, War of the Worlds, etc.  Ackerman, a constant wit coined the phrase ""Sci-Fi"" and became known as ""Mister Sci-fi.""  An artist once did a portrait of him with a clock behind that showed three minutes to twelve. That's the exact time Ackerman died on December 4th 2008.
If Ackerman became a Hollywood legend in his physical life he is sure starting to create legendary status as an active spirit.  A self-proclaimed non-believer in the afterlife his spirit comes back with a light hearted and provable vengeance.  When Paul Davids started the Project four years ago extraordinary events started happening while the camera was recording.  A clock that had not worked for ten years sounded the hour.  In a professional science lab a computer mysteriously switches itself on.  A line on a business document is deliberately inked out in exactly the precise style used by Ackerman.  A College of New Jersey specialist in forensic ink analysis says the ink is a mystery substance.  While Davids was filming an internationally known researcher in electronic spirit communication with two independently operated cameras, both suddenly recorded severe electronic interference.
The film rolls like an intriguing well-plotted detective story in fact the last thirty minutes is a ""must see"" for any believer or non-believer in the afterlife.  At the University of Arizona during a scientifically controlled experiment Spirit not only answers simple questions but the experiment is repeated again and again.
The Life After Death Project movie is fast moving, well edited with great photography and clear unrefutable evidence that life exists after death.
There is a second movie in the DVD package called ""Personal Encounters""  This is a collection by Davids of fascinating interviews with many people from all walks of life who have experienced life after death firsthand.
Surely a valuable documentary both for students of the Afterlife and Paranormal and also those doubters who need re-affirming that some form of active life exists after their final moments on Earth.  It's educational, enlightening and heartwarming.",1375056000,11,2866,5.27032967032967
5689133,5,B00C2U6F1O,"On 12/4/08 at age 92, we lost Forrest J Ackerman, author, actor, historian, literary agent, Esperantist, editor of Famous Monsters of Filmland magazine, and creator of the term ""sci-fi"".

""Forry"" was a generous friend and an inspiration to many people all over the world. He was a friend to Boris Karloff, Vincent Price, Bela Lugosi, Ray Harryhausen, Ray Bradbury and many, many other authors, filmmakers, artists and entertainers. He inspired the careers of George Lucas, Cassandra (Elvira) Peterson, Stephen King, Steven Spielberg and John Landis, again to name but a few.

More specifically, Forry was a great friend and mentor to ""Monster Kids"" like myself who were often misunderstood for enjoying horror, fantasy and science fiction. ""Uncle Forry"" gave us a place to feel safe, told us it was okay, told us WE were okay and free to enjoy this magical obsession. I am fortunate to have met and shared a casual, yet delightful acquaintance with Forry Ackerman.

The Life After Death Project was more informative and insightful than I had anticipated. While I personally need no convincing, I highly recommend this to the skeptic and believer alike, and to anyone who appreciated Forrest J Ackerman.",1374883200,2,1202,5.122448979591836
5689134,5,B00C2U6F1O,"Others have written very positive reviews, with which I am in total agreement. THE LIFE AFTER DEATH PROJECT stands out as a benchmark in paranormal studies, because of the persuasive evidence contained in that small but very ""loud"" ink stain, and the unprecedented scientific research it inspired.

What I want to focus on in my review is a negative side effect that inevitably rears its ugly head in cases such as this-- like one of the creatures from the pages of Forry Ackerman's FAMOUS MONSTERS OF FILMLAND magazine. So, while my title is humorous a la one of Mr. Ackerman's characteristic puns, the subject is ""deadly"" serious.

Equally as fascinating to me as this mind-boggling case itself is the ability of some of the more extreme skeptics to continue denying its significance. One of these skeptics is a lifelong friend of mine whose materialistic belief system was so threatened by the synchronicities we both experienced in relation to this case that he chose to end our friendship rather than acknowledge that anything out of the ordinary had taken place. Kind of ironic, because it was this friend who brought the case to my attention by showing me director Paul Davids' article about it in FATE Magazine.

Generally, my friend and I have had an amicable relationship. We've experienced our differences over the years but never before had I seen in him the level of animosity engendered by our brush with the miraculous. Whatever its true source, a spirit of harmless fun and pranksterish mischief seems to be behind these otherworldly ""voyages""-- but unfortunately, my friend has missed the boat completely, at least up to now.

I knew Forrest J Ackerman slightly and interviewed him on a couple of occasions. For reasons unknown to me, after reading the FATE article I began receiving many of these apparent ""communications from beyond"" on an ongoing basis. In the beginning my friend expressed great interest and asked me to keep him notified.

But last May, after a particularly ""impossible"" coincidence we both shared that had the unmistakable personal stamp of Ackerman all over it, I emailed this friend to discuss the event and received this reply: ""You can't stop equating everything in your life to Forry. Quite sad.""

My immediate reaction was, ""WHAT???"" Not only was this statement untrue but incongruous in light of our supposed mutual interest in learning all we could about this amazing case and our involvement in it. Then I remembered that on two previous occasions we'd gone around in circles arguing about the anomalies, as my friend tried to discount them through conventional explanations and ""lost his cool"" when it became clear he couldn't.

I felt that he was now playing the ""let's pretend it never happened"" game-- a form of denial to which many (but not all) skeptics resort when confronted with undeniable evidence for things that don't jibe with their rigidly held concept of reality. To me, our friendship did not hinge on his sharing my spiritual beliefs, so I sent a courteous reply inviting him to agree to disagree and let it go at that.

Instead he ramped up the conflict; his subsequent emails grew more disagreeable, insulting, and even a little paranoid. He would find fault with or misinterpret every response I made, no matter how well-intentioned. When I pointed out that he was being very negative, he accused ME of being the negative one, because I was accusing him of being negative! It was as though he'd constructed a mental screen of self-deception between us, through which I could no longer get through to him clearly.

During his previous visit I had quite seriously and without malice observed that he was like Biblical Thomas, who needed to place his hands in the wounds before he would believe in Christ's resurrection. At the time, I thought I'd made it plain that I respected that stance, although I did not share it.

In his emails, my friend began characterizing this observation as a ""Crack."" Even if I had meant it as a joke, he said, it was really nothing more than a ""pointed slap.""

Feeling a bit ""slapped"" myself, I assured him that I intended no disrespect or humor at his expense-- but, if he really interpreted what I had said in that way, then he must be having a serious issue with his own beliefs. His reply to me was ""This relationship is not worth the headaches. Please don't email me anymore."" I haven't heard from him since.

This was a guy who, in the beginning, had professed to being an ""open-minded skeptic."" But what he was most motivated to do was to debunk the phenomena. He could not do that and chose to rationalize the experience out of his life by creating unnecessary drama in our friendship.

Although my friend may be an extreme example of overreaction, any one who espouses belief in life after death must be prepared to confront strong disbelief from society at large, if not from friends and family. Most people who don't agree will probably just change the subject-- then again, concern over skepticism and/or ridicule is largely responsible for keeping many people who have experienced these kinds of anomalies from coming forward in a more open fashion. As a result, our society loses the benefits that widespread knowledge of this subject would bring.

Don't get me wrong; skepticism is an essential component of any approach to the paranormal. But there comes a point where, when truth has been staring you in the face through repeated experience, it's time to remove your blinders and at the very least admit, ""something remarkable is taking place here. I'm not sure what it is, but I want to learn all I can about it.""

Unfortunately, extreme skeptics like my atheistic friend prefer to sweep truth under the rug when it doesn't fit their expectations. For me, that would be the same as lying to myself, but ""to each his own."" Because of his repeated involvement in my experiences, I feel my friend may be the real ""target"" of our personal LIFE AFTER DEATH PROJECT. Perhaps eventually he will ""wake up,""  but each of us has to make up our own minds when or if we are ready to embrace reality in a new way. Those who are not yet ready will not be convinced by anything or anybody-- not even by the evidence of their own experience.

But that situation will change. For centuries, flying was believed to be impossible for humans, the world was undeniably flat and the sun obviously revolved around the earth. Anyone who said otherwise risked not only ridicule but persecution. In time the paradigms shifted, and, as Dr. Gary Schwartz contends, the same shift is now beginning to take place in the wake of cutting edge scientific research into the after-life and other paranormal phenomena.

Buy the DVD and weigh for yourself its persuasive evidence-- and by all means discuss and debate it. But please don't blame me if you discover you can't bend, squeeze, pound, prod or otherwise force this disc to fit into your own personal ""real player.""

One final observation: in life, Forry Ackerman was an atheist. We ""true believers"" sometimes forget that atheists can feel just as strongly about their NON-beliefs-- however misguided those feelings seem to us. We could ALL benefit from being more tolerant of people who think differently than we do. To me, that's the real lesson and legacy of THE LIFE AFTER DEATH PROJECT.",1374537600,5,7329,4.825498007968127
5689135,5,B00C2U6F1O,"The Life After Death Project really piqued my interest due to its unusual approach.  Does all psychic investigation have to take place in a moldering cemetery or a former battlefield, as most of the ghost hunting TV programs appear to suggest? I think not!

In fact, so many variables are present in a cemetery (temperature changes, barometric pressure changes, light changes, etc.) that I should think that data gathered there is of marginal scientific value in the end.  That could be why the scientists are not putting much emphasis on cemeteries or battlefields, nor are they publishing many papers on cemetery investigations in peer-reviewed journals!  But they are carrying out other sorts of studies, and some of the best research is being shown in The Life After Death Project.  The documentary shows laboratory experiments in which communication with ""hypothesized deceased co-investigators"" is being conducted by U. of Arizona research psychologist Gary Schwartz.

Dr. Schwartz talks about how he measures minute amounts of light in boxes using silicon photomultiplier systems manufactured for the purpose of bioimagery in the medical field.  Combining the silicon photomultiplier systems with light-tight chambers in a controlled laboratory setting, Dr. Schwartz measures light emissions in the tens of protons which are generated from an unknown source within the light-tight boxes when questions are asked of the ""hypothesized deceased co-investigators"" invited to join the experiments. Forrest J Ackerman, or, his spirit, if you will, was one of those invited.  It is very interesting, even thrilling, to see this happening in real time!

In March 2009, Mr. Davids was one of the celebrity speakers at a tribute held in Hollywood to honor Mr. Ackerman, the focus of the documentary.  Just weeks after the tribute, Mr. Davids was alone in his and his wife's second residence in New Mexico where he printed out a listing of business contacts. It looked fine when he tossed it on his bed and left to take a break.  But when he returned there was a strange blot of ink obscuring the line ""Spoke to Joe Amodei"".  Joe Amodei was a producer whom Mr. Davids only met once... so what did all this mean?  The connection with the late founding father of science fiction fandom, Forrest J Ackerman, came when Paul Davids spoke to a close friend of Forrest Ackerman a week after the incident in New Mexico.  The close friend, Joe Moe, described a vivid dream in which Mr. Ackerman told him he liked the tribute to him.  It then occurred to Mr. Davids that ""Spoke to Joe Amodei"" was a way of communicating ""spoke to Joe Moe"" and it was solid empirical evidence.  Mr. Moe did not know about the inkblot when he told Paul Davids about the dream.

I liked the scene in which Paul Davids flew to Indianapolis, Indiana and hand delivered the sheet of paper to a prominent chemist at Indiana University.  By the end of 2010 the ink blot had been analyzed by two forensic chemists.  You cannot help but notice the peculiar way in which the ink evenly covered the words ""Joe Amodei"".  The chemists and several graduate students have attempted to replicate the way the ink covered all the words and have gone on record in this documentary as saying they cannot, even three years later.

In the documentary the producers interview other close friends of Forrest J Ackerman and learn of odd things that happened to them as well.

The two DVD set has many good extras pertaining to Forrest J Ackerman on Disk 1.  The second DVD disk, Personal Encounters,  consists of interviews with hospice doctors and nurses who have in the course of their careers witnessed occurrences which they cannot explain, as well as interviews with New Mexico saloon/hotel owners who have seen and felt some peculiar phenomena, like doors that open on their own.  Updates on the ink blot analysis are also included in Part Two.",1374537600,7,3893,4.924961715160796
5689136,2,B00C2U6F1O,"""The Life After Death Project"" is a fascinating documentary in which filmmaker Paul Davids conducts an investigation of a case of after-death communication with science-fiction luminary and one-time editor of ""Famous Monsters of Filmland"" magazine Forrest J. Ackerman. Ackerman was a skeptic about life after death, but promised close friends that if it turned out he was wrong, he would try to ""drop them a line"" from the Other Side. Featured are authors Richard Matheson, Whitley Strieber, and Dannion Brinkley, along with science professors and three mediums.

The two-disc set also includes the film's sequel, ""Life After Death Project 2: Personal Encounters,"" which features first-person accounts of encounters with life after death from archaeologists, physicists, a retired colonel, a librarian, clinical psychologist, sales executive, publisher and doctors and nurses who've worked with hundreds of dying patients. They report seeing souls leaving the body at death, angelic beings, spirit entities, golden orbs, physical manifestations, and more. It includes updates on the continuing sage of Forrest J. Ackerman.

The movie attempts to make its case that there is an afterlife, but succeeds only in relying on an assortment of talking heads -- some charlatans, others basing their speculation on testimony of those who've had close flirtations with death. After all is said and done, the film is hardly convincing and not worth the time to watch it.

5689137,5,B00C2U6F1O,"The Life After Death Project-What Comes After Death?
by Richard Matheson, Whitley Strieber and Dannion Brinkley
is a DVD set with a series of interviews of best-selling
authors, top science professors, well respected mediums
and actual witnesses who provide testimony on their research
and personal experiences with persons who have died.

The story begins with a brief synopsis of the life and
death of Forrest J. Ackerman who was a founding father
of Hollywood science-fiction. Apparently, he refuses to
die as evidenced by mysterious communications with the
living by computer, on ink blots and a home clock which
ceased to tick at the exact time of his death.
Scientists tested the ink blots under an electron microscope
and could not pinpoint the materials science of the ink
markings.

Dr. Gary Schwartz PhD explained that the subject of energy
and consciousness after death is a continuing research
puzzle similar to the behavior of stars which continue to
emanate light long after their light extinguishes.

The authors point to various objects of scientific interest.
For instance, a Zimbabwe mask gives off a huge electric
charge. In addition, some scientists believe that the soul
exists on a quantum physical level after death. There is
credible testimony from nurses that dying patients have
a white light emanating from the mouth. Others have seen
a golden orb rise from the body at the time of death. The
International Association For Near Death Studies found that
people who've had near death experiences develop tremendous
insight and unusual psychic abilities not present before.

The Life After Death Project brings scientists closer
to establishing life after death. Much of the evidence
is testimonial. Some evidence consists of readings on
scientific instruments.

More needs to be done in order to capture pictures of
the human aura/chakras present during life and at the
time of death. Specific physics experiments need to be
set up and conducted on mysterious golden orbs and
light present at or near the time of death. For sure,
the scientific evidence is evolving as the test
instruments become more sophisticated. Only time and
additional research will provide conclusive answers on
what happens after death. Note that Jesus Christ stated:
""I will be with you-always"".

5689170,5,B00C2U6F1O,"This is a fascinating, and ultimately, compelling piece of work. Ive seen mixed reviews of it, and with most things like this, I went in skeptical. By about halfway through, however, I was starting to soften up on the whole thing, and by the end, I think what Paul Davids has here, is rather significant. At the heart of this, is the life and death of Forrest J Ackerman, a huge name in Sci-Fi circles. Ackerman was an Atheist, but said if there was something more beyond death, he would try and communicate back. Forest is not the first to make such claims, Harry Houdini being the most famous, but in that case, the relevant attempt at contact seemed to be primarily a sances at the anniversary of his death. This happened far more spontaneously.
One of the things that has been coming up more and more in this type of research is the role of synchronicity. For those that are not familiar, a synchronicity is a meaningful coincidence. A lot, but by no means all, of the evidence here are synchronicities. To some, that is reason to dismiss this. I think, though, that maybe this is just how it works. Not in some grandiose fashion, with a spectral form screaming out your name, but in the subtle workings of reality. Coincidences happen. But the sheer number of coincidences that would need to be accommodated here to dismiss it is absurd. And these synchronicities revolve around many people, not just Paul Davids.
Beyond that, you have mediums, who communicate very accurate information about Forest without knowing anything at all. You have a fascinating scientific experiment involving light photons and chemical analysis on a mysterious block of ink, which is really where the whole story starts.
Then there is a second DVD, which talks to various people about life after death, not directly related to Forest for the most part, although there are some updates. All in all, if you are looking for some mind blowing, in your face proof of life after death, you will not find that here. If, however, you look at this with an open mind, and with no preconceptions, there does seem to be something significant here.  Maybe we have been looking at the Life after Death issue in the wrong way. Maybe its the subtle fluxs that we should be paying attention to. In the end, I suppose, its personal. The people who these events happened to, know they happened. They present their stories and evidence clearly and concisely. A hardcore materialist will just chock it all up to coincidence or deception, but that is not an honest view of this. An honest view says something odd is happening to these people, and it may very well be explained by Forest J Ackerman communicating with them in his own way.",1388534400,2,2699,4.6821052631578945

5689177,2,B00C2U6F1O,"Yes it talks about life after death but this is almost ENTIRELY from the viewpoint of friends of Forrest J. Ackerman who they believe sent cryptic messages to them after his death. We get to hear all about his relationships to the people in the film and see tons of footage of him. Near the beginning of the film we meet two young Canadian film makers who say they are working on a film biography of Ackerman. It seems pretty obvious that this is that film with, ""a life after death"", theme added to give it a larger viewing audience.

I bought it because it featured a writer I love, the late Richard Matheson. I wanted to hear his ideas about life after death. All I heard was about two minutes of his stating that he didn't think people would be interested in life after death when he wrote ""What Dreams May Come."" If you were interested in hearing a real Matheson interview, forget it. The same goes for Whitley Strieber and Dannion Brinkley who are also listed in the subtitles on the cover. These are not real interviews, they are short clips, little more than sound bits with pictures. If you know who Brinkley is, you know he was hit by lightning and died. He tells that story in a few words, nothing new.

The few pieces of ""evidence"" presented are over analyzed to the point where you are begging for the film to just MOVE ON and over and over again those interviewed tell you who Ackerman. After a while it comes across as sheet narcissism...i.e. Forry was a great and I knew him well! This could have easily been HALF as long with proper editing and the narcissism of the main narrator who first finds a name inked out on his script gets VERY old. I watched the second CD which is mostly unedited footage of the stories told in the film. Nothing great there either. The only difference in the second CD is that it spends some time on ordinary people. The CD itself reminded me of a really bad episode of ""Celebrity Ghost Story"", full of people who have been out of the spotlight for too long and are hoping to remind any director who might be watching that they are still available.

It's not about an eerie vision that appears to hundreds of people simultaneously.  (Even that would be debunked by those individuals so inclined).  No, this is about a series of anomalous events that occurred to Paul Davids and many others over a period of time; events that would puzzle them anyway, but taken together seemed to point to someone deceased (Forrest J Ackerman) communicating with them using various means available.

It began for Davids with a strange blot of ink appearing on a list he printed on his home inkjet printer... a blot that was fresh, and was not there when he originally printed the mundane list of business contacts, tossed it on his bed and went to a casino.  Hours later when he looked at the sheets of paper, the blot was there.. and it covered part of a short line of text as precisely as if an editor had done it... he was alone in the house and there was no water nearby, no animals, no leaks from the ceiling.  He immediately got spooked, since this made no sense, and he suspected someone had broken into his house.  No one had, and then Davids remained spooked and shocked, and wondered what had happened.  He did not touch the ink but had the paper tested by two different chemists whose specialty is inks, paper and solvents.

Here is something that I think about a lot ever since I saw this documentary being completed by the producer...how many other persons have had something similar to this happen to them, and how many tossed the paper away or, frightened by the implications, never mentioned such a phenomenon to anyone else?

I myself made the mistake twenty years ago of discovering with my own eyes something that could have been someone ""from the Other Side"" communicating to me and just dismissed it, rationalizing it as something I did when sleepwalking, although I very rarely sleepwalk.

Paul Davids wanted to know the truth about this and other strange things that began to happen to him and his friends and associates.  His quest eventually made it possible for him to meet Dr. Gary Schwartz, a researcher into paranormal phenomena using scientific instruments in the lab.

Dr. Schwartz talks in this film about how he measures minute amounts of light in boxes using silicon photomultiplier systems manufactured for the purpose of bioimagery in the medical field. Combining the silicon photomultiplier systems with light-tight chambers in a controlled laboratory setting, Dr. Schwartz measures light emissions in the tens of protons which are generated from an unknown source within the light-tight boxes when questions are asked of the ""hypothesized deceased co-investigators"" invited to join the experiments. Forrest J Ackerman, or, his spirit, if you will, was one of those invited. It is very interesting, even thrilling, to see this experiment happening in real time!  These kinds of experiments, and not the thrilling but ultimately unconvincing ""ghost hunting"" type television programs, is what I want to see more of.

I liked the scene in which Paul Davids flew to Indianapolis, Indiana and hand delivered the sheet of paper to a prominent chemist at Indiana University. By the end of 2010 the ink blot had been analyzed by two forensic chemists. You cannot help but notice the peculiar way in which the ink evenly covered the words ""Joe Amodei"". The chemists and several graduate students have attempted to replicate the way the ink covered all the words, even when there had not been enough ink in the printing to do it, and have gone on record in this documentary as saying they cannot replicate this, even three years later.",1465084800,,3631,4.871753246753247
