About the maker:

8015158,5,B0001NBMZI,"We first watched Miffy on cable - Noggin. My then 18 month old loved it and we got a DVD for when we were travelling for a month. Although he barely watched the DVD on vacation, he loves watching Miffy. The show is simple and easy for kids to follow, and focuses on fun, friendship, love, school, grandparents, etc.

Other good shows are Maisy (books are also great for 1 year old) and Blues Clues.",1167782400,,398,4.306666666666667
8015159,5,B0001NBMZI,"I hope I'm not the only one out there that can't stand Dora. I found that Dora has a lot of mistakes if they are trying to teach a child. I think that Miffy is one of best videos out there for infants and toddlers. It teaches a child to be polite to friends and elders, which some do not. It is so hard to find something for a 2 year old to watch that won't corrupt them. I found Miffy and friends so innocent and sweet.",1144195200,3,420,3.839080459770115
8015160,5,B0001NBMZI,"Miffy & friends has to be the cutest and sweetest show on television.  I was very happy to see this dvd -- once or twice a day on Noggin just isn't enough sometimes.  My 18 month old son loves to dance along to the theme song.  He's been a big fan since about 12 months old.

I think the reason *I* like Miffy so much because she reminds me of Hello Kitty. (another childhood fav of mine!)",1133395200,2,389,4.012987012987013
8015161,5,B0001NBMZI,My 4 1/2 year old son loves the Miffy show on Noggin. But the show is only on once or twice in the morning.  This DVD could not have come soon enough for me.  I only hope that noggin puts out more miffy DVD's in the future.,1125273600,3,223,3.723404255319149
8015162,5,B0001NBMZI,"Not to imply that television needs its own introduction for children, but since the TV was crafted, human's have been watching it. Everyone needs a half hour or so to sit and either be informed, entertained and in todays world even shocked in the comfort of their own home. There's nothing wrong with watching TV and the time in a day is very long for a toddler, even longer for the parent chasing after one. So if you need to prepare dinner, read the paper, or even just sit down and day dream, this is the perfect video to get that slight, however much needed break from finger painting and reading that one book twenty times. First, I believe this is called stop animation, which is more enjoyable and easier for children to watch rather than the fast flashing of most cartoons. Then there's the narrartor, a soft, pleasant woman's voice which tells each story in the right of amount expression, like Alec Baldwin's voice in the Thomas The Tank Engine series. The same, familiar, sunny voice that draws children to the story. Also the stories are short, the music is happy, the characters are diverse and very thoughtful of each other. The little animal families are ones all children will relate to as there's the only child, Miffy, with her mother and father, Grunty the Pig who lives with his Aunt Poppy, Boris and Barbara Bear who are married, but with no kids and all of Miffy's classmates and friends.
 Then there are the brief breaks between each story which poses more of a word problem, for example, instead of just counting three flowers, three birds and three worms the child is asked after counting three flowers and three birds, if there's one worm under each flower how many worms are there. Which isn't going to make your child a wizard at math, but for a childrens video, I feel this is a more creative approach to the vidoes educational value.
 Nothing is more important that reading to your child and taking your child out to the park or your neighborhood recreation center to educate and stimulate your childs mind. But I will admitt I'd rather my young child say Miffy is their favorite program than that big, purple, goofey and borderline  frightening phoney dinosaur. Just for an option.",1106092800,19,2212,4.666666666666667
