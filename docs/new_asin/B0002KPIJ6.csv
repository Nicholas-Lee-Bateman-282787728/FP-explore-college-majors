8028736,5,B0002KPIJ6,"One of the best teachers out there, Fred's a laid-back and watchable guy who genuinely loves the Great American Songbook. Oh yeah, he's a mighty fine player besides.

On this disc he breaks down five of Irving Berlin's best, first teaching the backup chords and then chord soloing.

Includes ""Blue Skies,"" ""How Deep is the Ocean,"" ""Cheek to Cheek,"" ""Say It Isn't So,"" and ""I've Got My Love to Keep Me Warm.""

If you've felt the standards were just out of your reach, Sokolow will have them in your grasp in little time.",1114387200,6,519,4.559139784946237
