8514988,1,B007DIQCXG,Terrible quality video.,1505779200,,23,7.0
8514989,3,B007DIQCXG,"As other reviewers have stated, this is a 16mm transfer, so the quality is fuzzy throughout, and there are lots of artifacts in it, which is understandable giving the age of the prints.  All in all, it is viewable, and the background music is far above the standard I usually associate with Alpha (but that's not saying a whole lot). It's a pretty good buy for the money.",1475712000,,371,4.455882352941177
8514990,2,B007DIQCXG,"I bought this DVD for Run Girl Run specifically. I had seen the short on an online streaming service, and the print was clean and sharp. I ordered this DVD, but didn't look carefully enough to realize it was an Alpha DVD. The print they used looks like a 16mm (very low resolution), is scratchy, dirty and overly contrasty. Wish I had known, wouldn't have bought it.",1445904000,8,366,4.477611940298507

8514993,5,B007DIQCXG,I bought this dvd because of my love for the silents..  Fatty Arbuckle and Mabel Normand are my favorites.  I am also discovering new actors of that era that I like too!  These films are so funny!,1374278400,3,196,4.243243243243243
