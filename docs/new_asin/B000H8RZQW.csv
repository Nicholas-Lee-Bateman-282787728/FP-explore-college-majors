I'd rather a person take care of that than having us stare at a nasty, yellow-grain accident waiting to happen all day.  Similarly, I normally wouldn't want anything near my eyes and don't like seeing other people's eyes pestered with.  But hey, if eye procedures will cure cataracts and help people see, then I'm all for it.  Watching instruments make bad liquids gush from people's eyes was fun.

If someone said ""cataract,"" I'd think about the General in ""Watership Down"" with his very iris-absent eye.  However, there were no images like that here.  The documentary said surgeries are up and they are almost always successful.  Maybe the age of that scary eye look is past.

The work was diverse in terms of gender, age, and race.  Both a patient and a physician interviewed had awesome chin dimples.  Too often, one hears of devastating diseases that are wiping out scores or will never have a cure.  This work seemed to suggest that cataracts are something solved.  The work tries to preach that individuals get the problem addressed, but since I think most people want to see clearly and don't want eyes like that of the General, so they'd jump on this resource.",1198713600,,1227,4.731132075471698
