8428011,5,B004FN26TG,Brought back a childhood memory from PBS. My parents taped this off of PBS in the late 1980's. My Dad and I loved this National Geographic a lot. I know we wore the tape out. Have been looking for it in DVD for many years. It is a must if you like National Geographic specials. Very beautifully filmed. Great to watch with the family to teach children about history around the world.  Thanks for the memories.,1419724800,,409,4.381578947368421
