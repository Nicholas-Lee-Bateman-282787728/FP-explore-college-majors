8601721,5,B00E65SF98,"This is one of Sheridan La Fanu's best ""ghost"" stories (along with the excellent vampire tale Carmilla).  It was adapted for television in 1979 by the BBC, shown once in England and highly praised by the British Film Institute.  However, it was deemed far to erotic for distribution in the U.S. and is now available only on Region 2 dvd.  Its major offence is tasteful nudity in the context of art.  Oh my, oh my!
One hopes we colonists will some day believe we are able to handle the visual depiction of a mostly nude body as well as murder and mayhem.",1486944000,,553,4.392156862745098

8601723,5,B00E65SF98,"Well-known as one of Le Fanu's best ghost stories, and as one of the BBC's most atmospheric television productions, this DVD is for whatever short-sighted reason only available in Region 2 format. In practical terms, this means most of you here in the US can't play it on your DVD player or in your Windows computer. You can, however, play it on your Ubuntu Linux computer* by installing the VLC media player and a code library. Search the Internet for the topic ""play region 2 dvd in ubuntu"" and follow the directions. If this seems intimidating, get one of your tech-savvy friends to do it; it takes about 5 minutes. This DVD is most certainly worth the effort, and the procedure will open up your viewing scope to other non-Region 2 DVDs.

*Not using Linux? You may want to re-think your position. My wife and I love it, and not just for this.",1467763200,,846,4.529411764705882
