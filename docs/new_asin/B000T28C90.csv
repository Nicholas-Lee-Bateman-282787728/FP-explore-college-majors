I've actually had the pleasure of spending a few nights in the beautiful Stanley Hotel. So being able to see the Ghost Hunters team visit, explore and share some of my own personal experiances, really makes this a fun DVD to own!",1195689600,,348,4.242424242424242

2892748,3,B000T28C90,"I love Taps, especially since they got rid of Brian (something touched my arm dude!) Harnois (sadly he'll be ruining the new european ghost hunters).
Mr. Punk was fine, why he was there was a mystery.
There are some intriguing things including the tunnel ""voice"" (a cat perhaps?). The show suffers from the dreadful added soundtrack noise.
Just once I'd like a chance to hear what is going on without the spook music. The cuts to commercials are always ""Whats that!!!"" oh PLEASE.
Hitchcock proved it again and again, less is more.
Down sides , full screen never widescreen prior dvds had audio problems.
The recent OCT 31 Waverly Sanatorium was even better than The Stanley Holloween Show except for the idiot that ""hosted"" the show.
The guest celebrity on that show should be back, he was great as is Kris.
They need to kill the noise, make it HD and widescreen.

2892749,1,B000T28C90,Not too impressed. Lost intrest when Ghost Hunters brought in a celebrity to help them investigate the hotel and also had it as a live broadcast with viewers imput via text messages during the show. I still haven't finish the dvd yet!,1193788800,,234,4.595238095238095
2892750,4,B000T28C90,"I'd like to have had the full six hours on DVD rather than another compilation of highlights from the show. Still, I've watched this 3-hour DVD several times.  Not much happens, as usual.  The team finds a lot of cold spots, but you will in late October in the Rockies -- and some of the sounds they are tracing around the hotel could be attributed to heating coming on or even by mistake as Donna points out, the air conditioners.  Jason and Grant pretty much sequester themselves in the basement where they hear sounds that excite them into believing they've found a haunting, but they just sound like animals to me -- racoons or cats make similar sounds.  They fail to question this, so I sometimes believe that they pretend to be deceived just to enliven the show.  The investigating team is a good mix, but I wonder why the addition of a celebrity wrestler to help investigate.  Wouldn't it have been more worthwhile to have one or more scientists on board to lend some credibility?  For all that Jason stresses the science behind the investigations, the fact that none of these guys has any scientific background, thus little critical thinking skills, is brought home.  For instance, Steve hears murmuring in an adjacent room and is startled.  Yet might it be the heaters blowing air through filters, which can moan and rattle, and not ghosts talking?  Doesn't occur to him, and the new guy, Tango, is always willing to believe he's come upon a ghost, so much so that when he hears a strange sound or feels an odd sensation, he magnifies it into being a ghost.  He's funny.  Lisa is in this one, and she's the most grounded of them, as well as very serious about her investigating, which makes her as much of an asset as Brian.  Also, as a negative, the teams often stand around chatting, especially about personal info, rather than roaming about investigating.  It doesn't seem like they're that interested in finding any evidence.  However, I still enjoyed the presentation.  When the lights go out and the display goes to black and white, it's like a B-movie.  Very entertaining.",1193529600,9,2088,4.6923076923076925
2892751,5,B000T28C90,"This DVD was a lot longer than I thought it would be.  It's the special Halloween live version of TAPS investigating the Stanley Hotel again.  I loved the live feel of it, you feel like you're walking right along with them and experiencing everything without editing getting in the way.  There's a very creepy bit with Jason and Grant down in the employee entrance of the hotel.  I don't want to give too much away but it made my skin crawl.  Awesome.  If you love TAPS, buy this DVD.  I highly recommend it.",1192147200,17,508,4.397849462365591
2892752,3,B000T28C90,"You watch it for the people looking for the ghosts! These guys are hilarious! Especially since they take themselves so dang seriously. I've never seen an episode where something happened (or in which someone said something happened) that wasn't totally explicable. And even though they claim to be looking for logical explanations to odd occurances, these guys are all DYING to see/hear ghosts. And it shows! People like to be scared, and they like to think there are ghosts and the guys on this show are no exceptions. If they really wanted to find out what was what, they'd totally empty the house in question, fumigate it, seal it, and have all electrical power cut off to it from the street. Then when they investigate they'd know that they're not hearing rats or people or radios, or picking up electrical magnetic fields from the house's wiring or letting in drafts that are moving doors, etc. in other words, they'd actually do things scientifically.
But what fun would that be?

Like I say, watching these guys convince themselves that ghostly things are happening when they are not is the entertainment value of the show. A great depiction of how we humans love to fool ourselves.

A PS from 2009-- To answer some of the comments on my comment. I should have pointed out that this DVD is fairly typical of the show in general, but not the best representation of it--the ""live"" aspect of the program on this disc, even edited down, reveals the massive amount of time these guys spend doing basically nothing but sitting around bs-ing in the dark. AND I must add that I LOVE the show and am a great fan. I never meant to knock the show, but only meant to send a gentle elbow to those folks who watch it uncritically. The interest I find in GH's is the way it give you the opportunity to observe the way even intelligent people act when isolated in the darkness, hearing sounds they wouldn't have noticed in the daylight and misinterpreting unexpected sources of light and shadows.  Every time the Ghost Hunters experience an odd occurance they can't explain in 20 minutes, they assume there's a good chance that it's supernatural--that's what I find so interesting. The logical thing would be to assume that it's NOT supernatural and keep investigating. Their ""science"" is (how to put this kindly)...faulty. While it's true that they have ""debunked"" quite a few claims, they could easily debunk ALL of them, given the time and outside expertise. For example: EMF readings only read electromagnetic fields--they do not detect ghosts. There are few places in the modern world without electricity these days, so you're always going to find legit emf sources. And all old houses have colder patches at night; no room is the same temp all the way across in either a modern building with HVAC or in an old house with natural drafts. So reading temps proves nothing, despite the totally made-up theory that ""manifestations"" use room heat to manifest. Digital recorders don't record things you didn't hear if you were in the same room when they were set to record; anything strange you hear later on is just odd white noise or transmmissions from any one of hundreds of voice transmission sources. Eliminate those sources before being ""astounded."" All cameras have spherical lenses, and thus all can create spheres from any minute light source (which is why you don't see them with your eyes). And even regular snapshots occasionally have unexplained blobs or blemishes that no one would call ""unexplained and possibly supernatural"" unless they were already looking for something like that. Another interesting point is that, even though the owner of the buildings in question often claim that the spooky stuff they've experiences happens in broad daylight, the investigations always take place in the dark; there's no reason for that other than people's imaginations run wild when they are used to seeing stuff and then can't see anything.
I could go on and on. But I don't see my comments as negative as far as the show is concerned. I know that the GH's will never find real evidence of an acutal haunting. BUT they will entertain me endlessly with their good-natured attempts and they will provide me with many hours of insight into the psychology of ""how folks fool they own selves"" as the old saying goes. You COULD staff a show like this with actual professional technical experts who are familiar with the scientific method (like they have on UFO Hunters)but that would ruin the show. The entertainment of GH is that these are regular guys we can identify with.
To sum up: GREAT ENTERTAINMENT SHOW (but don't ruin it by taking it as anything else). This disc is ok, but the series dvds are better than this particular special.",1191456000,9,4733,4.819188191881919
2892753,4,B000T28C90,"My big complaint with Ghosthunters as a whole is that they focus on the two most uninteresting personalities (Uncle Fester Jason and Grant the mouse) and the characters who have some energy and something to say (example Dustin and Steve) don't get enough showtime.

2892768,1,B000T28C90,"I did a tour at the Stanley Hotel today and bought this video at the gift shop to learn more.  The tour we went on allowed five year olds and was during the day and I love ghost stuff so I wanted more of the spookiness.  There started out with four of us watching this DVD and one by one everyone left the room and now I am the only one left typing this while it's still on.  I think something might actually be happening now, but at this point I've lost too much interest to really care, (it's been at LEAST 45 minutes,) and I am so annoyed by the time I spent watching this waiting for SOMETHING to happen and having three other people watch it with me and thinking I have bad boring taste!  There's some stuff that happens at the first bit when they originally go to the hotel, and as for the ""live"" part and it being the ""highlights,""  well if these are the highlights not much must have happened overall!  Maybe if they skipped to the end and any actual activity it would be okay, but there are long sections with each group out looking for ghosts where NOTHING happens,except them talking about nothing and ghosts and their boring conversation, (have I used the word boring enough?  I'm holding myself back.) but seriously multiple sections for EACH group where they do nothing.  I would not recommend at all.  Waste of time and waste of money; I'm disappointed that I spent my last night with my family in Estes Park where the Stanley Hotel is watching this instead of something actually entertaining.

I've been watching Ghost Hunters (via satellite and in the States) from almost the very beginning. I've now seen the original programs and have read the books of Jason and Grant too. I have to say that I believe that ghosts may exist, but I want some kind of evidence. Some kind of proof. These investigators -- and their paranormal investigation team -- work on the same premise. They attempt to ""debunk"" paranormal claims, but when they gather evidence that is hard to ""debunk"" or ""dispute,"" they are left with evidence that may actually support life after death (i.e., ghost, paranormal activity).

While Ghost Hunters works with a scientific leaning by utilizing technical equipment from EMF meters / K2 meters, digital thermometers, night vision cameras and thermal sensor equipment, etc., other paranormal programs utilize spirit mediums and the like. While I do not discount psychic mediums and sensitives, their evidence is hard to prove or ""debunk."" Nevertheless, programs like ""Paranormal State"" and ""Paranormal Cops"" (broadcast on A&E) have their place as well. They are certainly interesting. Psychic mediums like John Edward and Chip Coffee are quite interesting. In fact, I've been watching John Edward for many years. He's gotten a bit ""mushy"" as of late (even for WE) -- his original program on SyFy used to display his medium abilities more readily. In short, more readings.

Writers and psychic researchers like Peter Cayce are also quite interesting. Peter Cayce utilizes Science, Philosophy and Religion to come up with explanations for the afterlife and reincarnation and Karma. Interesting material.

In any case, the paranormal field is an interesting one. I'd really like to see more programs about legitimate psychics and paranormal investigators like Ghost Hunters, John Edward and Peter Cayce.

2892771,5,B000T28C90,"GHOST HUNTERS LIVE
FROM THE STANLEY HOTEL

I have been a fan of this show since it first debuted and have been watching it since following Ghost Hunters Jay and Grant into the unknown. For those who don't know this show is about a group of professionals in the paranormal field [if there is such a thing they are closest] who using the latest in technology go from haunting to haunting searching for or disproving the paranormal at each place. The show is highly successful spawning two spin off shows like Ghost Hunters International and the upcoming Ghost Hunters Academy.

For the first live show the Hunters returned to one of the sites that gave them the most activity, The Stanley Hotel. This is the legendary hotel that Stephen King once stayed in and based stories after what he had seen here. So it seems a logical choice for the first live show since it is a proven hot spot for paranormal activity. This time around pro wrestler CM Punk is along for the ride and seems like he is ready for anything to happen.

This DVD is basically the episode after the live one that was the edited version with the analyzing and reveal of everything that they found. Still this is an excellent DVD that is a wonderful addition to the collection at home of every season. Jay and Grant as usual come off as the most professional but every one else seems really into to find something so it is entertaining. There are some really great moments that happen during this investigation like when Jay and Grant are down in a tunnel, CREEPY.

I own all of the DVD sets and such and watch every episode on SyFy so I highly recommend this show if you are into things like this. I am a big fan and I think you would be to if you were to watch it. Some episodes are better than others but I have never been bored by an episode, including when I watched and recorded all the live shows, the full 6 hours of them.

There was alot of overreacting to sounds and sensations that they wouldn't have seemed to have done on the regular show. As one reviewer stated, maybe it was to try to infuse some excitement to the show. The only problem was that it tended to make it seem fake. This seemed most true when Jason and Grant were in the basement hearing what seemed to be a woman saying ""hello"". Their usual skepticism wasn't there (I.E - it could be an animal or with all the pipes under the building perhaps it was someone in a room somewhere) they went immediately to it being a ghost. A wrestler as a special guest? What were they thinking? This added nothing to the show (unless you are a wrestling fan). I found this to be a negative influence to the show more than a positive one.

the program, and own seasons 1,2 and 3 on DVD.  I saw the original
investigation at the Stanley, and me and my wife were really
looking forward to this.

My review overall is 2 stars.

The reason is because this DVD
is sloppy.  The investigation was sloppy.  The integraton of
a wrestler who anounces at the beginning that he is
""into this kind of stuff"" in an unenthusiastic voice sets the
scene.  It was a sloppy decision to include him.  Almost as sloppy
as the editing.

Jay and Grant stumble on some interesting activity.  The girls
team lead by Donna LeCroix is professional and make expositional
remarks so  the audience understands what is happening without
it being too 'play school'

The biggest problems are everything else! ..

* Brian and Steve amount to nothing more than a comedy duo
as the presence of Live TV (""I feel like I am being watched"") makes
them uncomfortable and continue to talk non-stop and say silly
things, the best being Brian's theory of a woman exploding mid-air
to explain a cold-spot high in the air.  I know Jay must have
sighed when he watched this DVD back.

* Dustin who does nothing except pose and walk around like
a primate - quite possibly the only TAPS member who is completely
useless and thinks hot girls sit around to watch the show for him.

* The absence of Andy Andrews - where did he go?  Awesome investigator
who could have brought more legitimacy to this poor investigation.

* CR Punk, a wrestler who seems to occasionally disappear from the
investigation, only for the audience to realise he is laying around
on the beds of each room.  He was bored out of his brains and wasn't
anywhere to be seen at the invetigation wrap-up.

Next time the Ghost Hunters team do a DVD from a LIVE show,
they should get a good editor.  I honestly have never seen
such sloppy work and I have seen a lot of amatuer films, believe me.
