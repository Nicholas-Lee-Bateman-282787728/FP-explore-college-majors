8500232,4,B006L3YML8,"***MILD SPOILERS*** Insightful film about tense relations between the police and the disenfranchised poor in Liverpool.  Gripping, suspenseful, film noirish, still timely in regards ""us versus them"" relations between police and citizens nearly 60 years hence.  Good acting all round, except by some of the children.  David McCallum (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Man-From-U-N-C-L-E/dp/B00110EJA0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Man From U.N.C.L.E.</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/NCIS/dp/B00ND9WZ5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">NCIS</a>) is especially effective as a young man on the verge of cracking up and taking others with him.
