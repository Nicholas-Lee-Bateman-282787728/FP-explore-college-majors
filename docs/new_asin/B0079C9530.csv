5064128,5,B0079C9530,"Hector, played by Jonathan LaPaglia, is facing his 40th birthday. He lives with his wife, Aisha, played by Sophie Okonedo, who runs a veterinary hospital. They have a son and a daughter, and things are pretty good, except Hector has a thing going with Connie, a 17-year-old who works for his wife and sometimes babysits their kids. He knows he needs to break it off before things get worse.

At the birthday party, Hugo, a son of Rosie, played by Melissa George, and Gary, played by Anthony George, is a kid out of control, has never reprimanded and is still breast fed when frustrated. Hugo is slapped across the face after he kicked Harry, the rich playboy, friend of Hector. Everyone becomes outraged. Harry's wife drags him away. Hector's aged Greek parents say the kid deserved to be slapped. Anouk a friend of Rosie and Aisha, also believes Hugo needs discipline. Anouk is a  writer of a soap opera and brings along her boy toy, actor.

Each of these people have their own story, and each one is explored in this 8 episode drama. This is an excellently acted series, much better than the US series going on now. A lot for people to talk about. The Slap opens the series, and it is the main drama from which all evolves.

5064129,4,B0079C9530,Aisha's performance is wonderful-An English actress with a great Australian accent.  Hard core drama with some good sex scenes as well as some violence.  The DVD's had to be played on my computer since they were Britain orientated.,1384387200,2,231,5.052631578947368
5064130,4,B0079C9530,"This is a very well acted, Altmannesque narrative that follows many separate people from their point of view while advancing a plot line.  While my wife found it exaggerated and over-the-top, I found it engrossing and at times moving.  The various crises - of sexuality, marriages at the point of disillusionment, and the burdens of long-term relationships - appeared very real indeed to me, as did the ambiguity of the characters:  no one is clearly good or bad.

The plot starts off with ""the slap"", where a man loses it with a very difficult child.  The parents, who already intensely dislike the man, take the matter to the police; they want to send him to jail in the most serious way.  Of course, this drives a wedge into a series of friendships and family relations, making lives much much more complicated.

The episodes then cover individuals, whose concerns and thoughts are revealed in greater depth.  Rather than a reversal thing - where you see things in a totally different light - it is more of a peeling away, getting closer to the essence of someone as they hurt and grow and accept things or don't.  This was fun, for me, because I thought the characters were well drawn and, for the most part, realistic.  It also isn't a rashomon-style drama, in my view, but a consistent portrait that gets engraved ever more clearly. THough the quality is good enough, I speculate that the viewer will be able to re-watch the drama and see it differently in accordance with maturity and experience (a feature of good art, in my opinion).

I do not want to reveal any spoilers that aren't obvious from the cover blurb.  The best portraits, I found, are the married couple, Hector and his judgmental wife.  They are in that limbo, where they have been married for some time and are caught in routine and the terrible grey of mid-life.  Both make irrevocable choices, but choose to deal with them in very different ways.  You leave the series not knowing if they can reconcile or heal, which is so much like long-term marriages that go through stages unimaginable to those who have never married.

Then there are the older parents, who exist in the background but whose relationships and personalities shape events in subtle ways.  They are at turns sad, loving, a pain to deal with - everything that elderly parents can be, but with a startling honesty.  There are also 2 teenage kids, whose travails are less developed, like their personalities.  A lie (based on an illusion) shapes much of what happens to them.  The resolution of their problems was the only thing that seemed too pat with me, though the young actors were excellent.  Finally, there are the parents of the assaulted child.  Perhaps less complex, and I never developed much sympathy for them, they are interesting for anyone who has friends that have a very difficult, if not mentally ill, child.  Is it what they do that makes the child so impossible or something inherent in him?  What should they do differently?  Maybe he did need a smack?

I recommend this as a good slice of life.  It is fun to witness Australia, but is universal as well.",1373846400,3,3116,4.69060773480663
5064131,5,B0079C9530,I would highly recommend this series to anyone who likes a relationship based drama. Each episode follows the lives of each of the friends and  acquaintances who all shared a dramatic BBQ together. Brilliantly written and acted and perfectly cast.  Superb.,1357516800,5,256,5.219512195121951

8512639,1,B0079C9530,Usually enjoy Australian TV shows. Unfortunately this seems to be some kind of liberal left-leaning crap. First episode you have to have the multiracial couple then the other couple one married to a Muslim. Have to be all inclusive of course. But what is really stupid is a woman breastfeeding her four or five year old child still in front of a bunch of other young children. Call me old-fashioned but that is just ridiculous. Then the kid is destroying property and actually tries to hit the other kids with a wooden bat. Child needed discipline unfortunately guy lost his cool and slapped him. When I grew up this would have never been acceptable by any adults I'm talking about the little kid and no discipline. Just wondering if one of the woman would have done the same thing it would have been such a big deal. Stopped watching after 3 episodes just a bunch of crap,1528675200,,872,4.560509554140127

So i thought, why not try the original Australian version.  This version is way darjer with a lot more gratuitous sex, drug usage, and swearing...which would be ok, i guess, if it added to the story, but it really doesnt.  This version is way harder to watch and i wouldnt have gotten if if i had known.",1528329600,,508,4.326315789473684

8512645,5,B0079C9530,"THE SLAP. This unusual Australian television series opens as a man strikes an unruly, disobedient young boy at a family barbecue in suburban Melbourne. The boys mother presses assault charges; tensions start to run high among family and friends.  As based on the award-winning novel by Christos Tsiolkas, this intense melodrama looks at the consequences of that moment from the viewpoints of eight characters: lies, secrets, adultery will be exposed; relationships damaged. This critically acclaimed miniseries won the Australian Film Institutes AACTA Awards for best miniseries, screenplay, direction, lead actor, and supporting actress. It boasts  an outstanding international ensemble cast that includes the gorgeous Oscar nominee Sophie Okonedo (HOTEL RWANDA), as Aisha; the beautiful Golden Globe nominee Melissa George (IN TREATMENT, AMITYVILLE HORROR), as Rosie; the striking Essie Davis (MISS FISHERS MURDER MYSTERIES),  as Anouk, three longtime close friends. And Jonathan LaPaglia (COLD CASE, THE DISTRICT), Anthony LaPaglias younger, better-looking  though still ethnic-looking-- brother, as Hector, Greek-Australian host of the 40th birthday barbecue, Aishas husband. The series, which also stars Alex Dimitriades (GHOST SHIP), and Sophie Lowe (THE RETURNED, ONCE UPON A TIME IN WONDERLAND), premiered in Australia in 2011; an American adaptation that also starred Melissa George aired on NBC in February 2015.  This boxed three disc  set features eight episodes totaling approximately 450 minutes, plus extensive bonus material that takes up an entire DVD: a making of featurette, deleted scenes.  I received it as a review copy. It has subtitles, thank goodness, for those of us not familiar with  Australian lingo.  Mind you, it contains nudity, sex, strong language, violence, drug use: not for children, nor the faint of heart.

The acting, of course, is top drawer.  The scenery lovely, frequently interesting, as it shows Australias flora and fauna to an audience that may not be familiar with those sights. The episodes are:
1. Hector. Aisha, his veterinarian wife, has  planned a barbecue for their friends and family on the day before he turns 40. The day starts off well but soon becomes chaotic. The slap and its consequences force Hector to examine his own behavior, his own weaknesses, his own regrets.
2. Anouk. Anouk, Aisha's handsome best friend, has a very sick mother, a high-stress, high-tension job as a TV runner, and a boy toy lover in one of the young stars of her soap opera.  She falls pregnant at the age of forty-one, has to decide if she wants the child. Anouk feels pressured by Rosie to condemn the slap even though she has often felt herself like administering one to the boy.
3. Harry. Hector's cousin, a self-made man who has the perfect wife, the perfect child, the perfect house by the bay, discovers that his aspirational achievements are about to be destroyed. Because, in a moment of rage he slapped the child Hugo, who had kicked him, was flailing around a cricket bat, threatening the other children at the barbecue, including Harrys son.
4. Connie. At seventeen she is a lovely blonde school girl, the orphan child of radical parents whose liberated ethical code may have not prepared her for the colder, unbohemian world of suburban Australia. She works in Aishas veterinarian business, babysits for her.  And her secret involvement with Aishas husband Hector, a man over twice her age, threatens to make her both  victim and outcast.
5. Rosie. Hugo's mother is a woman who dotes on her son to a degree many may not understand. Her rage at what she considers Harry's abuse of her son becomes an obsession which threatens to overwhelm her and destroy her social circle.
6. Manolis. Hector's immigrant Greek father, Harrys uncle, is approaching the end of his life. He considers Hugo dangerously ill-behaved, but wishes his nephew had not hit the child. He is alarmed by how the event has divided his family, in particular the tensions it has created between Hector and Aisha.
7. Aisha. As she too enters her forties, she has doubts about the marriage, the future. The barbecue slap has left her loyalties divided between her husband and his family, and one of her oldest friends. Aisha and Hector take a holiday in Bali to confront their problems.
8. Richie. Connie's best mate at school, the child of divorced parents, wishes the world were a simpler place that he could better understand.  Hes confused, unstable; as the only one who knows Connie's secret, he inadvertently sets off a chain of events that brings everything out into the open.

This finely-wrought drama that examines its characters lives so closely may not be to everyones taste, but we in this house found it electrifying, worth binge-watching.",1443225600,2,4768,5.155440414507772
8512646,5,B0079C9530,"Is it OK to slap as child discipline? Can ethnic families be dysfunctional? Both seem to be story themes. THE SLAP is both disgusting and heartbreaking drama. THE SLAP event in the opening episode becomes more of a B-plot as episodes, just like chapters in Christos Tsiolkas book of the same title, look in depth at the lives of some of the guests of the BBQ. Each has an intense, modern type of Aussie lifestyle, which is portrayed via convincing acting.
IF-it-Matters warning: More than normal profanity (F word often) mixed into the DVD box warned frantic adult interludes, drugs, violence, and missing costumes. If that's a problem, I hope this warning helps you decide to skip this DVD series. On the flip-side, that negative is more than made up for in the miniseries concept and character finesse.

It is a complex iffy morality story-line. No matter what you think and feel--THE SLAP is a compelling must-keep-watching miniseries. The miniseries did take some liberties from the book, with the aid of the book author, to make the visuals better. Some changes are explained in the bonus material.

8512647,5,B0079C9530,"I just watched all installments this morning through my Acorn subscription.  I could not pause or turn away.  I haven't read the book yet to see how close it is, but it was very well done. I'm grew up in the old South where kids were raised to be seen and not heard and I've managed to raise three  responsible, caring adults with a minimum of physical punishment and I regret some of the times I did spank them.  Hugo was one of those indulged, totally out control kids that we see and hate to be around.  The Hector character was in gorgeous form, I remember him from New York Undercover.  I don't think I've ever seen so much suggested masturbation in one film.  This version really makes you think.",1437868800,,702,4.3538461538461535
8512648,5,B0079C9530,"I am making my way through this one, the original. I viewed a short while ago the American remake. I thought the American remake was really good. Now here's my only warning. Apparently everyone was so in love with the book that they kept the same script for both versions. The scenes and lines are virtually identical. The actors are all different except for one.

The only main acting difference I've noticed is that Hector was played by Peter Saarsgard, a wonderful actor, in the American one. However, the Australian one uses someone I am far more inclined to believe is actually Greek with a Greek family. He is Anthony LaPlagia's younger brother, Jonathan, and he is infinitely better looking than Anthony. He is also in real life a doctor but he stopped practicing to try acting.

This version also does not censor anything. Our American version is missing some explicit scenes which are in the Australian one. If you haven't watched either version and you want the most explicit version, this is the one.

I am really curious to see if they end the same. Usually American remakes have nice tidy endings. Foreign series don't seem to feel that need. Their endings are generally a lot grittier than ours.

You might want to give this a chance.",1434153600,8,1248,4.7110091743119265
