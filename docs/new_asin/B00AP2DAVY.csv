8555597,5,B00AP2DAVY,"Older 60's - 70's R&B style material but absolutely classic. They may seem overly simple and somewhat repetitive at first, but a sensitive open-minded ear will soon recognize some of the beautiful basic DNA building blocks of American rock and role. The technical reviews of how to play the material is at a level just above beginner and will probably be a simple review for most proficient guitarist. But the classic tasty licks themselves are worthy of your attention, whether you're 20 or 70, just beginning or a crusty seasoned Pro! If you get the bonus CD version you will receive yet another collection of classic R&B, Rock and Blues licks, presented in an easily digested format by various players.

Definitely a recommended CD if you want to fatten up your R&B vocabulary.",1440547200,2,780,4.864661654135339
