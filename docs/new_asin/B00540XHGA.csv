Worse, I ordered this DVD from Amazon in the USA but it ended up being shipped from the UK!!!

Now, to return it to the UK I now have to pay for the postage, that besides having to drive to a UPS outlet to ship it.

Amazon.com USA was adamantly reluctant to take care of the case, they washed their hand and ""solved"" the impasse by giving me no other alternative but to deal with the UK franchise, with which I never made the deal. Then, to my new surprise, per instructions from Amazon USA, I went to the Amazon UK website and it took my ID and PW...when I never ever opened any account with such franchise or any other franchise of Amazon in the world, except for Amazon USA.

Flops like this only reflect very poorly on Amazon; Bezos --or whoever is at the helm at Amazon-- should do his job.

I have been buying from Amazon since the very day it went online in 1995, but lately I have been hit by a rosary of all sorts of problems from lousy products to UN-truth in advertising situations to cases like the one I address here.",1364256000,3,1081,4.202898550724638
8456059,1,B00540XHGA,"This video is really poor quality considering video formats today, with two poor announcers & no additional commentary.  I at first thought that this was a mistake & had to do a double take when examing the video box & realizing that I had paid good money for this, but alas, it was a fantastic game.",1316304000,9,300,4.357142857142857
8456060,1,B00540XHGA,"This expensive game video comes with no extras, passive commentary from a couple of bored guys with no interesting insights, and poor video quality. The only saving grace is the quality of the game itself, struggling to matter in the face of such indifference.",1314230400,11,260,4.931818181818182
