8077881,4,B000AD0QF6,"The picture quality and sound in this video are pretty good overall, but it starts out with 15 minutes of just panning through the happy crowd at the show. Why nobody bothered to edit this look at the crowd down to just 5 minutes I don't know because it does get boring after the first 5 minutes of that. The only other problem that I have with this concert video is that during every song and everything that is said between songs there is a Spanish translation caption on the bottom of the screen, which was very distracting for me. It takes up almost 20% of the screen at times.
I don't speak spanish myself, but for those of you who don't understand English, just Spanish, this aspect of the video might appeal to you.  For the rest of us English speakers, if you can get past this constant captioning, you will enjoy this music video. This concert took place in an amphetheater outdoors, so the sound isn't perfect, but it's still pretty good and the picture is very clear.",1296604800,,978,4.433333333333334
8077882,1,B000AD0QF6,I was really disappointed with this DVD.  The sound quality and video quality made we remember what life was like in the 50's with television.  I would not recommend this for anyone.  A total waste of money.,1277769600,,207,4.54054054054054
