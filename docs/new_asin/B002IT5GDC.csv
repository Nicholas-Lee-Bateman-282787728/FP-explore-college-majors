So why, just why was ""Stan Helsing"" thrown into my life? What crimes could one man commit that ""Stan Helsing"" would be visited upon him?

If the ""Scary Movie"" series of films wasn't enough for you, ""Stan Helsing"" is like a compilation of the unfunniest scenes from those films.

I'm actually angry at the space this dvd took up in my trash bag when I threw it out. That space could have been used for something that was useful at one time, like a spent tube of toothpaste or something. ""Stan Helsing"" doesn't even make good garbage. Don't even use this DVD as a coster, your drink will resent you.

I hated this movie, and am a worse person for watching it.",1256601600,,828,4.2215189873417724
3936815,3,B002IT5GDC,"Spoofs of franchises either fall flat, or exceed expectations.  Not having seen any of the Scary Movie Franchises, I came into this film with absolutely no preconceptions.

From what many have said, that was probably okay.

However, this was not a terrible film if you look at it with an eye that says, ignore the girl with the halter top, or the short dresses.  The Fat Superman, the vampire hunter cowboy, are just as spoof-ful and given the premise of the film, match whatever level the humor/quality is.

Jokes based on sex, destiny, torture, product endorsement, stupidity, and sex are rampant.  Some are funny, while others fall flat. The dialogue is sharp, predictable, and cynical.  It is clear that some money was spent on production quality.

One of these days, these guys will do an original film.

Watch it for a laugh.  A second time might be too much.",1256601600,3,865,4.74496644295302
3936816,1,B002IT5GDC,"I'm a big fan of satire.  That said I've thus far avoided the Friedberg/Seltzer films (Disaster Movie, Date Movie, etc.).  This isn't made by those infamous producers, but apparently it shares the same DNA - and what a foul specimen it is.  I'm pretty sure this is the first ""1"" that I've even been inspired to give, and I wish I could rate it lower.  I can't say that among the stupid takeoffs of monster/killer names, bad Michael Jackson jokes, and horrific dialog that I as much as grinned once.  This movie is truly an abomination.  I almost cried seeing Leslie Nielsen here in drag.  This is an even darker moment for him than the late 80's craptastic satire disaster, Repossessed.  This movie doesn't even make it anywhere near the 'so bad it's amusing' category.  This is more like 'it's so bad that I want to gouge my eyes out.'  For the love of all that is sacred, STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE.",1256601600,2,900,4.466257668711656
3936817,3,B002IT5GDC,"I'm glad this movie is a parody. If it took itself seriously at all it would be absolutely horrible.

The plot is this--Stan Helsing, a flunky clerk at a video store, has to drop off some videos (yes videos) to the mother of the store owner. This gives Stan and his three companions a reason to being heading into neighborhoods they have never been in before. That's about all the plot there really is. There is a minor thread about Stan denying his bloodline (the Van Helsings) but that topic is rarely touched on and is really only there to give an excuse for him to be the monster target.

This is a very poorly made movie and I was sad to see the great Leslie Neilson make an appearance as a waitress. He must've had a contract obligation because there was no reason to have him in this movie other than to use his name.

This movie goes on my list of bad horror flicks. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because it is almost so bad, it's good. I did laugh and roll my eyes at some of the parodies presented in this movie but none of the cheesy concepts were given enough time to really develop any steam and so fell pretty flat.

I would put this movie on in the background at a Halloween party but that is about all.",1256515200,2,1225,4.156118143459915
3936818,2,B002IT5GDC,"Without a doubt a very unfunny film, but the entire BD product does have a few things to offer.

The sound and picture clarity are actually outstanding (or on par for a Blu). In this case, they give you the option of 5.1 or Uncompressed PCM, and the latter was much better. All the flesh tones and contrasts looked solid also. The supplements include:

* 11 minute making of. If anything, just to see Nielsen do his schtick behind the scenes was great. It was obvious they were doing this to have fun, and once you know that, all of the criticisms about how ""ashamed"" actors should be for partaking in this film - become misplaced. Nielsen's little gas-noise device he hides in his hand still shows (all these years later) how simple it can be to make people laugh.
* 8 minutes of deleted scenes. Wow - more rated R than the entire film. Was actually fun to watch.
* 5 minutes of outtakes. Unfunny.
* Picture gallery. Low def pics that were boring.
* Storyboard gallery. Even more boring.
* Cast/Crew commentary. Enjoyed the making of more.

One for the Blu quality and one for the extras. Otherwise a skipper.",1256515200,2,1110,4.485148514851486
3936819,5,B002IT5GDC,"Leslie Nielsen is even funnier in drag with this hilarious spoof in the tradition of 'Scary Movie'. Stan Helsing (Steve Howey) is the male version of 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' in that he doesn't connect with his family roots as monster slayers until he's tested by the monsters. Soon there is no escape from the truth as Stan is forced to venture into a bizarre neighborhood with his friends to make a delivery to 'the last house on the left' where they are confronted with strange events along the way. Though the film does slightly touch on the use of common stereotypes, I happen to think some stereotypes are always funny. After all, most stereotypes have a hint of truth to them, or people wouldn't connect to them so easily in the comedy crowd. Those of us who also watch a lot of horror films will 'get' more of the humor. Be sure to watch the extended and deleted scenes, as well as outtakes, especially cast interviews. Thanks for the endorphin rush Bo Zenga!
P.S. If you're the type who 'comes to the party not looking for fun', you probably won't enjoy this movie. If you want straight horror, this isn't the movie for you.

3936820,1,B002IT5GDC,"In the tradition of comedy spoofs and parodies, Stan Helsing takes on every major scary icon of recent vintage, including ""Freddy,"" ""Jason,"" ""Leatherface,"" ""Pinhead,"" and ""Chucky"".  If you are an aficionado of the horror genre, you might enjoy some of the subtle and blatant humor, but most of the humor is aimed at debasing women, bathroom jokes and the like.

Stan Helsing, a video store employee, has to make a delivery before going with his buddies to a Halloween party.  As danger lurks around every corner, he learns that in fact he is a descendant of Van Helsing, a famed monster killer and given special weapons to defeat ""the monsters"".

The movie is laden with insider gags and jokes e.g. at the video store, as people return ""The Ring"", they fall down dead (the gist of that movie is if you watch that video you will die). If you are not familiar with the movies parodied, you will wonder why you are watching such sophomoric nonsense.

3936821,1,B002IT5GDC,"FreeDictionary defines ""spoof"" as: 1. nonsense; tomfoolery; 2. a hoax; and 3. a gentle satirical imitation; a light parody.

One of these fits the movie Stan Helsing.  It's not definitions 2 or 3, and it is not tomfoolery.

You see what's left.

In Stan Helsing, video shop employee, drug user, and sexist pilgrim Stan Helsing finds that he is a descendent of ""famous"" monster hunter Van Helsing.  His IQ of 90 prevents him from reaching this conclusion for the first 95% of the movie.  He is most interested in delivering a bag of videos to his boss's grandmother, looking at women's chests and under their clothes, and singing badly.

As a spoof, it fails to reach the funny-bone threshold we've come to expect with movies such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Airplane/dp/B00004Y62W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Airplane!</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spaceballs/dp/0792844890/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spaceballs</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Young-Frankenstein/dp/B000G6BLWE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Young Frankenstein</a>.

Stan (Steve Howey) who is out to make a movie gets stranded in a sort of Halloween Twilight Zone. There they are confronted by all the biggest slashers of the time. Makes you want to up-Chucky unless you are a Freddy-defender. It can be mockingly funny.

3936876,4,B002IT5GDC,"First off, I'm not a fan of the ""Scary Movie"" franchise.  I don't think I've even seen any of them.  If I had, I may not have found Stan Helsing to be as funny as I did, since many people are saying the Scary Movie films are far funnier.  I DO however, like horror movies in general, and do enjoy a good slasher flick every now and then.  I don't generally go for spoofs or parodies all that much (Mel Brooks classics notwithstanding), but I was bored one afternoon and found Stan Helsing showing for free On Demand, so I thought I'd have a look.  It took a little while for me to get into it, but once I did, I was totally loving it!

Steve Howey plays the title character, Stan Helsing, a lovable twenty-something loser stuck in a dead-end job, with no greater ambition than to get high, get laid, and otherwise not get involved.  He hooks up on Halloween night with three friends, including his ex-girlfriend Nadine (played by smoking hot Diora Baird) to go to a party.  But first, he has to make a detour to deliver some rental movies to Stormy Night Estates, and that's when the fun begins.  Stan and his ex, along with their friends, Mia (played by the equally hot Desi Lydic) and Teddy (funnyman Kenan Thompson), make this a detour definitely worth taking.

What follows is a huge dose of slap-your-forehead silly, outrageous, sexy, and sometimes just plain dumb humor.  The cast seems to having a lot fun with it, and the karaoke sequences just seem to add to the sheer lunacy of it all.  The always funny Leslie Nielsen, in one of his last roles, is on hand in drag to add his own brand of deadpan silliness to the proceedings.  And when the ""Monsters"" show up - including parodies of Jason Vorhees, Michael Myers, Freddy Krueger, Chucky, Pinhead, and Leatherface, Stan Helsing the slacker somehow begins channeling his Van Helsing heritage, and ends up as the most unlikely of heroes, saving the day (or night, in this case).

I have to admit that with a title like Stan Helsing, I somehow expected Stan to square off against parodies of the classic Universal monsters, rather than the more modern ""slashers"".  Perhaps if there's ever a sequel made (fat chance, I'm sure all the haters would say), thay could somehow figure out a way to make this happen.  Either way,I enjoyed this film a whole lot more than thought I would.  I don't know why it's so widely reviled.  I found it to be a great way to kill 90 minutes plus on an afternoon, and will definitely be watching it again - most likely on or around Halloween.  I think it would make a terrific party movie.  If you're a fan of slasher movies, and don't mind a broad parody going for cheap laughs and taking potshots at some of the most iconic figures from those films, you could do much worse than Stan Helsing.  I know I seem to be in the minority, as a lot of people are saying there isn't anything much worse THAN Stan Helsing, but I gave it a shot, and I'm glad I did!  Perhaps you should too.",1327968000,,2965,4.411764705882353
3936877,1,B002IT5GDC,"One word best describes this movie LAME.
This is a sad attempt of a comedy trying to poke fun at horror movies.
First, whoever wrote the script for this movie was probably a virgin. So he had nothing else better to do with his lonely Saturday nights then to come up with a crappy comedy trying to spoof horror movies. The writer was most likely an ex MTV comedy writer, who spent countless hours on the computer writing this horrid movie script, and between chapters looked at porn while eating doritos. He probably had anger issues over the fact of not being able to get it up. With his erectile dysfunction issues, he channeled that useless energy to come up with a pathetic attempt  at a comedy. He needed whatever amount of money the sad hack of the movie producer gave to him to pay for his alcohol abuse program.
You have a group of actors that no one has ever heard of before, that couldn't even get a job at McDonalds. So the next best thing besides living on the streets was to be an unfortunate actor in this epic fail of a comedy movie.
The less of a man actor who played the embarrassing role of Stan Helsing. looks like a retarded ex football player. But we all know that football players are just retarded anyway.  Now Stan Helsings butt pirate buddy was probably a cashier that the movie crew found at a Walgreens store. Now I do feel sorry for the two female lead actresses. Their poor acting skills reminded me of college girls that work as strippers. Even though they are kinda cute, they probably slept with most of the crew members of this God awful movie. And most likely will probably end up on the Maury show to find out who their babies daddy is.
As for the comedy in this movie. It was the kind of MTV juvenile quality that we all come to expect from the ghetto's producer's at MTV. Or rather the black folk projects. Not one joke made me laugh in this movie. At least the jokes were short lived for the movie was fast paced.
The only bright spot in this movie was that the late but great Leslie Nielsen played a bit role. He probably felt so bad for the movie producer that he decided to do what he could for his movie.
I'm thankful that I only had to watch this movie once. I watched it from my on demand Comcast cable.
I very strongly suggest that nobody waste their time  watching this crap. Even if Amazon offered it for only a penny. Its the kind of comedy suitable for a Christian.",1323907200,,2413,4.31057268722467

3936881,4,B002IT5GDC,"Stan Helsing is a very funny horror comedy spoof, and I don't really understand why a majority of reviewers obviously don't care for it.  Yes, it's stupid - but that goes without saying; and, yes, the ending is extremely stupid, but that doesn't take away from all of the good bits leading up to it.  I'll take Stan Helsing over any of the brain-dead Scare Movie sequels any day of the week.  Stan ""It's Stan, not Van"" Helsing (Steve Howey) is one of the most likeable underachieving slackers you're likely to run across, his buddy Teddy (Kenan Thompson) is hilarious, and his ex-girlfriend Nadine (Diora Baird) is just plain hot.

It's Halloween, and video store clerk Stan has to drop off some videos at his boss's mother's house before he, Nadine, Teddy, and Teddy's girl Mia (Desi Lydic) - an exotic dancer turned masseuse - can go to the big Halloween party.  Along the way, they encounter one crazy, oftentimes dangerous, and consistently comical obstacle after another.  Eventually, they find themselves trapped in Stormy Night Estates, where Stan discovers that he is expected to save the town from the menace of six monsters: Lucky (Chucky), Mason (Jason), Fweddy (Freddy Krueger), Pleatherface (Leatherface), Needlehead (Pinhead), and Michael Criers (Michael Meyers).  It turns out that there's some Van Helsing in him, after all.

Interestingly enough, Ken Kirzinger (who played Jason Voorhees in Jason vs. Freddy) plays the part of Mason.  You also have Leslie Nielsen playing the part of a waitress, which certainly doesn't take anything away from the comedy of the story.  A number of movies are, of course, mocked along the way, and I think the whole concept works quite well.  I laughed out loud several times over the course of this movie.  I know a lot of people are putting Stan Helsing on their lists of the worst movies ever made, but I hope those who haven't seen it yet will give it a chance.

3936888,1,B002IT5GDC,"""Stan Helsing"" is not just unfunny; it is a painful experience with my favorite actor Leslie Nielsen in it. He hasn't been in good movies these days - and he was great in the ""Naked Gun"" trilogy and ""Wrongfully Accused"" was not that bad. I didn't expect much from ""Stan,"" but I like him, so I decided to see the film anyway. It turns out a wrong decision as ""Stan Helsing"" is truly a terrible film (and not that kind of ""terrible"" you can enjoy watching).

""Stan Helsing"" is about four characters and their Halloween night misadventures. The story is virtually non-existent, but that is not a big problem. Some great comedies like ""Airplane!"" don't need a plot. But comedy needs talented actors and someone who guides them, neither of which ""Stan"" has. Throughout the film we are not sure what the film is parodying. The ""jokes"" are just crude ideas and nothing more. The film's most elaborate comic set-piece is a karaoke contest involving ""monsters,"" or Fweddy, Mason, Pleatherface, and so on. You can watch something much better on YouTube.

But what is really bad about ""Stan"" is the embarrassing characters played by Keenan Thompson and Steve Howey. You know, while watching films you meet some annoying characters (like Jar-Jar Binks) that you wish their quick and early demise. They keep doing stupid things they think very funny, which you find very irritating.

As to Leslie Nielsen, well, he looks just bored or uninterested. Luckily his role is not a big one and perhaps he knows this is going to be a bad movie, which ""Stan Helsing"" exactly is.",1289520000,2,1556,4.7555555555555555

That's not to say the actors are entirely unlikeable, but the script was so poorly written they didn't have much to go on. Another problem is that the film isn't really a spoof or parody of anything in particular, like it presents itself as; instead it comes off as a bunch of drama club students running around playing dress-up and goofing off. It's just one random event after the other, with no plotline to speak of. Not that these kinds of movies should rely on in-depth backstory, necessarily, but the early Scary Movie series and subsequent Date/Disaster/Epic/Whatever Movies at least made some sort of attempt to hold everything together.

3936900,1,B002IT5GDC,"The only thing more disheartening, more painful, more hopelessly frustrating than watching STAN HELSING is watching and listening to the special features included on the DVD, in which cast, crew and writer/director Bo Zenga continually delude themselves into thinking they've made a good movie. The commentary track--in which Zenga, Desi Lydic, Diora Baird and Kenan Thompson practically hump each other with unearned praise and point out a myriad of ""favourite"" scenes ad nauseum (really, folks, how many favourite scenes can a person have?)--made me angrier than any other commentary I've ever listened to, including the one for RESIDENT EVIL where Michelle Rodriguez and Milla Jovovich act like cracked-up morons. But seriously, you'd have to be contractually obligated to participate in a commentary track for a piece of agonizingly unfunny junk like this in the first place--and further contractually obligated to pretend you think it's within a million miles of the ballpark of funny. The track offers virtually NO production background either, just 90 minutes of four people with little of worth to say about this movie because they damned well know it was nothing but a cash grab.

Nearly every parody movie of the last decade can be accused of laziness when it comes to picking pop culture targets, but Zenga--an executive producer of SCARY MOVIE but none of its sequels--reaches new lows because he barely even TRIES.

- His title character works at a video store called Schlockbuster. Seriously, Bo, that's the best you could come up with?

- The villains Stan is fated to battle--once they bother to return to the film after being absent for most of it--are knockoffs of famous franchise horror villains, here renamed Lucky, Mason, Michael Criers, Pleatherface, Fweddy and Needlehead. Again, how friggin' EASY was it to change a couple of letters in each of their names to come up with these new ones?

- The town in which Stan and his pals (big fat best friend Kenan Thompson in ""hilarious"" Superman tights, and their girlfriends Desi Lydic and Diora Baird in skimpy indian and schoolgirl outfits) find themselves trapped after detouring on their way to a Halloween party is called Stormy Night Estates. I wanted to stab my eyes with screwdrivers at this point, but since Amazon gave me this movie for free, I had to oblige by writing this review. I may still stab my eyes later.

- The ""song contest"" near the end of the film is the absolute nadir of comedy, with some of the most unimaginative parody lyrics ever written. Again, Zenga and Co. put forth only the barest amount of effort to make sure they had something--ANYTHING--to pad their film out and get it released on video.

Zenga's IMDB profile suggests he hadn't worked since 2006 before making this film, which makes the project seem all the more opportunistic and sad. In being left to his own devices to pay the rent, he came up desperately wanting. It's all too evident that Zenga felt that wit, comic timing and filmmaking talent above that of a TV-movie hack were unneccessary as long as he had a derivative, foil-embossed parody movie-style slipcover to lure in the suckers. Thank GOD Amazon made this available for free through the Vine program, where dozens of 1-star reviews have hopefully kept potential renters away in droves.

I'm utterly ashamed that this ""film"" was made in Canada. We already crank out enough direct-to-video garbage up here, but this truly hits rock bottom.

Not so, in fact the people that rented (or god forbid bought) the movie are more than likely fans of the characters & they've more than likely really insulted every single one of those people.

Bottom line, I AM DONE!!!  Never again will I rent, buy, go see... whatever, these movies & anyone involved in these various movies, they're all dead to me.  I'll pretend they never existed & that'll be the end of them (I hope).  I think the only reason they still get funding to make these movies is exactly because of people like me who keep expecting that one day they'll finally have a winner.  Advise to any and all movie exec's & producers out there, please oh please stop giving these guys money.  Let them crawl back into the holes they came from & let the rest of us get on with our lives.  BURN THIS MOVIE!!!!",1258588800,3,2439,4.426008968609866
3936909,2,B002IT5GDC,"I honestly can't say this is the ""worst"" movie I've ever seen. Considering it falls into the Spoof Comedy category it's pretty average for these types of films. The last 5 I've seen were real stinkers.

I couldn't make it all the way through in the first sitting. That tells me a lot about a films re-watch value. It has none.

Definitely in the top 10% of the worst movies I've ever seen.",1258588800,2,389,4.315068493150685
3936910,2,B002IT5GDC,"Despite Leslie Nielsen's brilliant performance (as always), this movie was a complete disaster from start to finish.  It could have been a gem, too, when you take the off-beat writing style from movies like Airplane and Naked Gun and give it a Halloween twist, but it just didn't happen here.

Pretty much everything that happened was easily predictable, and those that weren't were so outlandishly childish and stupid that they weren't even worth watching.

A few minutes into the movie I was ready to turn it off, but I kept going in hopes of finding something worthwhile.  With the exception of Nielsen, that never happened.  And the ending was absolutely intolerable.

What's disappointing is that I usually like this genre of movies.  I enjoyed Scary Movie and Not Another Teen Movie, and the aformentioned Naked Gun series and Airplane I/II.  This movie?  No.

Others have said that the only value in this movie were the attactive actresses and gratuitous shots of cleavage and legs, and while there's some truth to that, it's certainly not worth 108 minutes of your time.",1258243200,4,1078,4.938888888888889
3936911,2,B002IT5GDC,"Stan Helsing- A Parody, could have been a much funnier movie, if only the pace was faster and the humor would have been more outrageous, as in the Scary Movie's. As it is, the movie starts out with the main character Stan Helsing working as a clerk at Schlockbuster, a video rental store, who is made to make a special delivery on Halloween night. He makes the delivery with 3 of his friends while they are on their way to a Halloween Party.

The humor revolves around Stan being constantly mistaken for Van Helsing and always running into many of the great horror stars from movies like Child's Play, Nightmare on Elm Street, Hellraiser, Halloween, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and even Jaws.

Parodies are ridiculous imitations of serious movies, so having outrageous humor makes them really funny, and this is what is lacking in Stan Helsing. The movie moves slow and the laughs are cute, but not laugh out loud funny. There are parts where the movie could have been absolutely hilarious, like with the Altar Boy, who is ALMOST a priest, but it seems the humor is kept low, as in the movement of the film.

The movie has some extra's: Commentary, The making of Stan Helsing, Extended, Alternate and Deleted Scenes, Outtakes, Trailer and Galleries. This is a cute parody, but it just doesn't have what it takes to be outrageously funny.",1257984000,3,1337,4.705128205128205
3936912,4,B002IT5GDC,"Hey lighten up folks . . . . these reviews are so serious for what is clearly a low budget Indie Movie.

I loved that it took place on HALLOWEEN night, and made fun of some of my favorite killers such as Michael Myers, Jason Voorhees, and Freddy Krueger. A dorky guy named Stan Helsing works at a video store, and on the way to a HALLOWEEN party with his friends, they get lost on the back roads and meet some really creepy characters. Stan finds out from a homosexual priest that he is the heir to the famous monster hunter, Abraham Van Helsing. Soon, Stan and his friends compete against the monsters in a Karaoke battle. Who will win the battle against good vs. evil? I highly recommend STAN HELSING!!!",1257552000,2,687,4.548387096774194
3936914,1,B002IT5GDC,"Wow, Leslie Nielsen and Keenan Thompson, fire your agents. Bo Zenga, retire. Everyone involved in this, hang your head. ""Stan Helsing"" is a spoof that can't take an easy target (monster movies and characters that have been around long enough to be self-parodies) and make even a mildly funny movie. I got only one mild chuckle in the whole 90 minutes of this film, and it involved a kids' hockey team. The rest of ""Stan Helsing"" is a wretchedly unfunny movie that misses almost every pitch it makes. Top it off with a bad Michael Jackson joke and an inexplicable ""appearance"" by Barack Obama and you start to wonder how this DVD got past the discussion stage. Plenty of aimless, mean-spirited sex jokes, a nasty homophobic streak, lack of developed ideas...and the only monster that stoner/video store clerk Stan Helsing should have killed off was this script.",1257465600,,860,4.857142857142857
3936915,1,B002IT5GDC,"I should have known better, as even the Scary Movie franchise ran out of steam really fast.  This is a real snooze.  They try so hard to make you believe it's funny, that it's almost painful to watch at times.  Take a big pass on this.",1257379200,,235,4.065217391304348
3936916,2,B002IT5GDC,"Oh goodness this movie was bad. I would love to say that it had ""potential"", but I'm really not even sure about that. The only positive I can say is that some of the costumes were pretty creative (pin-head and ""clutch face"").

Let's start with the plot, what there was of it: Stan Helsing, a video store employee, is going to a Halloween party with some friends, but first he has to drop off some movies to one of the owners - if only they can find the owner's house. Oh and he keeps getting mistaken for ""Van"" Helsing the great monster hunter - even though he redundantly reminds everyone that he's Stan. Yes we know you're Stan, you've told us 50 times.

The foursome find themselves stuck in a gate community that was once used as a horror movie set - and many of the residents are still dead. Ooooh, spooky. Yeah no. Seriously the only redeeming acting in the entire movie comes from a cameo from the great Leslie Nielsen. But I'm sorry to say, even he wasn't enough to salvage what got worse and worse.

You'll see all the ""popular"" horror characters here like pin head, freddy, michael myers, and jason. The costuming tries to be funny - pin head doesn't have pins in his head, they are things like darts and syringes; and one of the characters has a Prada clutch for a face (I found that one pretty funny, but only in passing).

The four main characters attempt to be funny, but the writing doesn't even reach slapstick level (which I could have actually tolerated and laughed at). I have a feeling we won't be seeing much from these folks anymore. Even the sexual humour (which is sometimes thrown in to help you get into the ridiculous story) wasn't any good.

Two stars - and it only gets two for Leslie Nielsen (who should have said ""NO"" to this movie), and the costumes of pin head and clutch face.",1257206400,2,1810,4.407185628742515
3936917,2,B002IT5GDC,"STAN HELSING wasn't a complete disappointment. It kept my interest for the most part but the humor was lacking and frequently garned no reaction at all. If you're renting or buying STAN HELSING, you know what you're getting. We get a half dozen of these films a year. Cheap budgets. Same old movie spoofs. The lowest grade of humor possible.

Yet, HELSING may just be a victim of the movie business itself and how lame it has been lately. Because what are they spoofing? Chucky from Child's play (last movie 1998), Pin-head from Hellraiser (when was there a good one of these?), Nightmare on Elm Streets Freddy Krueger (last movie 2003), and of course the 3-dozen movies about people who drive out in the middle of nowhere and get hunted by crazed loonies that don't like outsiders.

I'll give it better props than coasters like Date Movie, Epic Movie, Disaster Movie & Meet the Spartans, but just for the sheer fact that it has somewhat of a story arc to it, and it had Leslie Nielsen who was actually funny.",1257120000,2,1009,4.6
3936918,1,B002IT5GDC,"All I can say is wow, and not in a good way! I wasn't expecting much from this and boy did it deliver NOTHING! OK so the chicks were hot but that only goes so far. The jokes were childish and as parodies go I think Leslie Neilson played a woman hoping no one would recognize him! I think Keenan Thompson is funny and the addition of a ""good burger"" for him was clever but even he wasn't funny. All the ""funny"" stuff was shown in the trailer and when I actually saw them in the film they weren't funny anymore. I think I chuckled once and it was so fleeting that right now I couldn't tell you what it was! Even the out takes during the credits were dumb. I am glad, however that I only rented it on my TiVo and didn't pay the money to purchase the film. Unless you can see it for free, I'd pass if I had to do it again.",1257120000,,818,3.904191616766467
3936919,4,B002IT5GDC,"Stan Helsing is one of those rare parody movies, in that it actually manages to have a plot and follow it.  The story follows Stan (Steve Howey), his ex-girlfriend Nadine (Diora Baird), his best friend Teddy (Kenan Thompson), and Teddy's date Mia (Desi Lydic) as they try to make a delivery for the SchlockBuster where Stan works at.  Of course, that proves a little difficult to do since there are six of the biggest names in 80's monster movies chasing them.

I won't spoil the rest of the movie for you, but I will tell you it's funny, but it feels a little reserved.  It doesn't hit you with as many sight gags as, say, Epic Movie (which was just an enormous waste of time), but it has more subtle ones.  Not being much of an 80's horror buff, I can't say how many cameos may actually appear in it.  I do know there are several instances where I felt that I should know the actors from somewhere before.  That being said, the gags they decide to run with are fitting.  They aren't completely disconnected from the plot, but the use of obvious stock footage sometimes gives the movie the feel of a TV pilot.

Bottom line is, the movie is funny.  If you're looking for a decent parody film, and you can't find one done by the Zucker brothers or the Wayans brothers, Stan Helsing is a good buy.  There aren't that many special features on the disk (some outtakes, a small list of extended scenes, and commentary by the writer/director and 2 of the cast) but it's alright.

But probably the real reason people are going to buy it is to see Leslie Nielsen in drag.",1257033600,3,1563,4.388888888888889
3936920,2,B002IT5GDC,"What a wasted opportunity.  To have a video clerk go to a town where all the classic horror movie villians reside is a brilliant idea for a spoof.  Yes, we have had SCARY MOVIE, EPIC MOVIE and too many others to mention.  But almost all opportunity to get even limited laughs is wasted here.  In the first 5 minutes almost every gross over the top antic was utilized and I was pretty repulsed.  But I told myself I was gonna watch this movie all the way through.  The four main characters that take us on our journey luckily were likable and had good chemistry for the rest of the film was grade F and only they made it barely watchable.  I recommend this film as one of those rentals to watch with friends when you want a really bad film to mock.  Go beyond the first 10 minutes and it will be slightly tolerable.

This movie is a perfect example of how a films description can often in no way match up to its quality.  I love Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13, Hellraiser and Chucky and thought even if this was bad how could they mess up.  But they did.  I pity those who paid money to see this in the theaters.  Luckily I got it for free to view and review.  Had I purchased it I would be angry too.  But after just finishing it I don't feel like I totally wasted 90 minutes but I am trying to be kind.  Most will feel that way.  One last time - what a waste of a great ideas!!!",1256860800,2,1387,4.0777777777777775
3936921,2,B002IT5GDC,"I guess there will never be an end to the ""spoof"" genre that began so long ago.  The early pioneers of the genre were Mel Brooks with ""Blazing Saddles"" and ""Young Frankenstein"" and the trio of David & Jerry Zucker with Jim Abrahams - ""Aiplane!"" and ""Top Secret!"" and ""Police Squad"".  These were classic movie (and in the case of the very last example, TV) parodies that have stood the test of time because they are clever and don't rely on merely sending up the latest movies.

""Stan Helsing"" is a piece of junk that tried to follow in the footsteps of a very decent horror movie spoof, ""Scary Movie"".  Of course, ""Scary Movie"" degenerated into a horrible franchise with three sequels that were further and further diminished in quality.  ""Stan Helsing"" throws Leslie Nielsen into the mix, as all these desperate junk parodies seem to do.  Poor old Leslis is cashing a paycheck with this one, in drag no less.  Somehow the talented Kenan Thompson of SNL fame got suckered into a starring role, though he isn't even top billed.

The first half hour of the movie takes place largely in a car.  The whole thing is cheap and badly written and poorly directed.  There are a few chuckles here and there and the two lead chicks are pretty hot.  If you must see every single movie of this kind, you might get a laugh or two out of it.  Everyone else: avoid it!",1256688000,3,1352,4.473469387755102
3936922,3,B002IT5GDC,"I desperately wanted to enjoy ""Stan Helsing.""  I love the ""Scary Movie"" franchise.  My best friend bought me all four installments for Christmas last year.  Whenever I feel depressed, I watch one.  There are certain scenes that I watch repeatedly because they make me laugh out loud.  Anna Faris and Regina Hall are my favorite stars in the series.

  ""Stan Helsing"" was produced by Bo Zenga who was the creative genius behind ""Scary Movie"" and ""Soul Plane.""  The DVD jacket for ""Stan Helsing"" is similar to the one for each ""Scary Movie"":  A scared group of young people are sitting in a theatre surrounded by horror film creatures.  Alas, the advertising misled me to believe that ""Stan Helsing"" would make a great companion piece for my ""Scary Movie"" collection.

  Halloween is one of my favorite holidays.  I love watching Halloween themed movies around this special day.  I was eagerly awaiting my opportunity to preview ""Stan Helsing.""  Unfortunately, I was disappointed to the extreme.  The title character is so very inept.  I would rather call AAA, Ghostbusters or the Girl Scouts before I called Stan Helsing to help rid my neighborhood of monsters.

  The plot for ""Stan Helsing"" is too simple and childish.  My thirteen-year-old nephew could've written it.  Stan Helsing (Steve Howey of ""Reba"") is a trifling, bumbling, lazy video clerk who must deliver a stack of porn films to his boss' grandmother before going to a Halloween party.  Him and his misfit friends get lost in the country and find themselves at Stormy Night Estates.  It burned to the ground ten years ago.  Now it is inhabited by ghosts who have a fixation for Karaoke.  Unfortunately they are terrorized by horror icons from the eighties such as Michael Myers, Freddy Krueger, Pinhead, Chucky, Jason Voorhees and Leatherface.  They want Stan Helsing, a descendant of Van Helsing, to slay the monsters.

  The acting is fair to middling.  However, the two female leads are beautiful and kept the movie interesting.  In fact, Desi Lydic is delightful as Mia, the stereotypical dumb blonde.  She is a stripper turned massage therapist.  (I'll let her explain the difference.)  Cute and adorable, she had most of the lines that could be considered funny.  I hope to see her in other projects.  Leslie Nielsen in drag has an extended cameo that is never funny.  Not since costarring in 1972's ""The Poseidon Adventure"" has he been involved with a bigger disaster.

  ""Stan Helsing"" tries very hard but never approaches the hilarity of ""Scary Movie"" or ""Soul Plane.""  Too many of its jokes we have heard before.  There is an overabundance of bathroom crudeness, breast fondling, crossdressing and gay bashing.  Many fans of slasher films from the eighties might be offended by seeing their horror heroes depicted as clowns and buffoons.  The Karaoke sing and dance that they performed to the music of ""YMCA"" while spelling S-T-A-N was especially degrading, almost sacrilegious.  Someone owes an apology to Jason Voorhees, Chucky, Leatherface, Pinhead, Michael Myers and Freddy Krueger.  In the end, ""Stan Helsing"" manages to be just another mediocre movie parody like ""Epic Movie"" or ""Date Movie.""

  Anchor Bay provided numerous extras.  There are outtakes and bloopers.  Unfortunately, they're not funny.  Likewise, the ""making of"" featurette titled ""Killer Parody"" was not funny.  Steve Howey incorrectly believes that the repeated use of the ""F"" word is comical.  The ""Extended, Alternate and Deleted Scenes"" featurette was very offensive, especially the extended scene of the gay porno studio and the deleted one in which Chucky is gang raped by other dolls.  Afraid of dying of boredom, I didn't listen to the audio commentary.

  ""Stan Helsing"" is recommended only for those who must see every movie parody.  Fans of Leslie Nielsen may also want to watch it.  Don't purchase this DVD thinking that it is a sequel to the ""Scary Movie"" series.  Because humor is subjective, I definitely suggest that you rent ""Stan Helsing"" before purchasing.  What some people find objectionable, tasteless, crude and obnoxious, others may find highly enjoyable and entertaining.
