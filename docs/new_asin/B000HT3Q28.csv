8141162,3,B000HT3Q28,"Daniel, (Ash Newman) is urged by his grandmother to search across all of Europe to locate her fathers grave and end the mystery she wants solved before her death. Too old to make the trip herself, she arms Daniel with a little money and some clues and he hesitantly sets off to unravel the mystery and bring her peace.

His mission was a puzzling one that led him from one dead-end lead to another, where he did manage to locate information about the life his great grandfather lived and learn about the heritage his family posessed. However, as Daniel goes on his way it begins to become more clear throughout the film, that his great grandfather is not really the man his grandmother intended for him to find, but rather to find himself through the experience. She doesn't want to die without knowing Daniel will be able to take care of himself and know what his life is all about. She also wants to makes sure he is aware of his family roots and that this rich heritage may be one he will pass down to future generations, if he can only learn to grasp it and appreciate it.

This was an ""OK"" film, and it held my attention throughout, however there were places where I got lost and found it hard to figure out. Trying to follow the visual of the film and keep up with the subtitles at the same time, left some moments of confusion. There are films you want to watch over and over again and then there are films like SHEM. For me, one time was enough.

I suppose I had high hopes for this movie that it simply couldn't live up to and I was rather disappointed by the plot which I did not have a good understanding of  before viewing it. It was not an unpleasant film to me, and did contain lots of adventure, sights all around Europe with some history and culture that make it a good watch.

The acting was pretty good as was most everything in the production. Before viewing it, I would suggest reading the discription carefully as well as the reviews, so you can have a better understanding of the film in advance. There have been several reviews added since I purchased this DVD, which might have made this a more enjoyable film for me. I hope the addition of my review will give you a little more information to go on and make SHEM a more enjoyable adventure for you.",1353110400,,2273,4.351415094339623
8141163,4,B000HT3Q28,"Caroline Roboh's Shem doesn't follow the clich rituals of Hollywood.  It doesn't exhibit the inconclusive, abstract detachment of much French cinema.  So it has been misunderstood by some who fault it for the apparent incompleteness of its plot.  In fact it yields great riches if one realizes that the story is unfolding in words and images more than in external plot.  The true plot is an inner plot.  Who is Daniel and what is really happening to him?

 Daniel is not particularly likeable at the start.  But he exudes a youthful vitality irresistible to other characters, and to us.  (He is played by the attractive Ash Newman in a performance that is fresh, subtle, various, committed, and forceful.)  Despairing of his life of hedonism and self-absorption, Daniel responds to his grandmother's challenge to find the grave of her father, a righteous rabbi who, after sending his daughter to England, died in Europe in 1939.  Daniel follows clues on a journey from city to city in Western and then Eastern Europe.

 Hints that there is more than literal significance to the quest for a physical grave include several recurring visual and verbal motifs, like awakening from sleep; focus on Daniel's eyes with blindfold, sun glasses, and fake and real tears; the variety of Daniel's sexual escapades; the use of true and false names (the title of the film means ""name"" in Hebrew); the succession of places memorializing the Jews of Europe destroyed by the Nazi holocaust; the series of dead ends; the seductiveness of death and of images of death; and others.  The turning points for Daniel--an empty synagogue with nothing but names on the walls, the appearance of an angel, a discovery about his great-grandfather's life--are not so much plot turnings as moral and psychological turnings.

 One motif takes the form of an apparently unresolved sub-plot that has caused some reviewers to think the film badly edited.  They miss the point.  The activities of the spy ring in search of the ""stones of the Temple"" are far less significant as a hidden or incomplete plot than as a form of temptation for Daniel.  Late in the film the ring presents Daniel with a reductive interpretation of his great-grandfather's life, and his challenge is to resist it.  That the plot does not follow the spies themselves to some Hollywood resolution is not a flaw.  The point is Daniel's response to the vision of reality they offer.  Are the physical world and its pleasures the point of life, or is there more going on here?  Is Daniel's true quest for a physical grave or--whether he knows it or not--for meaning and connection?  When the viewer can answer this, the film turns out to be both deep and moving.",1310083200,,2697,4.864035087719298

8141165,1,B000HT3Q28,"I can only conclude after watching half this movie that those who gave it favourable reviews must be friends and family of the film maker. A good lookng young man having adventures in europe,whats not to like?Well...the good looking young man is extremely unlikable,as for the adventure part..nothing happens! this unlikeable brat wanders around europe looking for his grandfathers grave. He has a couple of contrived encounters which are totally without interest,the episode on the train is ludicrous,bad bad acting.the film looks as though it has been shot on an old video camera, the picture is soft,the colour washed out ,I am not jewish so all that jewish angst and self flaggelation was lost on me and the acting from everyone involved was so amateurish it is cringe making. So thats it.. no story,an unlikeable lead character,and poor picture quality,i gave up on this halfway through.what really annoys me is that i paid top dollar for it and ended up getting $3.00 for it at my local second hand dealer,thats about what its worth. What was film maker caroline robah thinking when she made this self indulgent piece of of nonsense who on earth did she think would find this drivel interesting?Ms robah give up film making and if you want to do something useful for the jewish community learn how to make bagels!",1236902400,,1319,4.892857142857143
8141166,4,B000HT3Q28,Shem is a awesome movie about aveture and being young traveling across eastern europe Ash Newman does an awesome role in this film and made it interesting and exciting filled with much joy and sadiness.,1211760000,2,202,4.8
8141167,4,B000HT3Q28,"For many twenty something's entering adulthood nowadays, it's hard to find ones place in society. Daniel, our protagonist in the movie is feeling fed-up and under appreciated with his dead-end job and like many people his age who would love to get away, decides to toss it all to the wind; his job, his income, his partner(s) and take a whirl-wind trip around Eastern Europe to get his mind off his dull dead end, seemingly meaningless life. What he encounters along his journey, contrary to his reasons for leaving however, begin to change his outlook on life and his ancestry. For those who wish to pick up and leave never to look back, Shem may just be what you need to get away, without leaving everything you know.",1172620800,19,719,4.625
8141168,1,B000HT3Q28,"Beautiful scenes and cinematography and a handsome leading man do not make up for an awkward, disjointed, poorly-developed ride around Eastern Europe in search of a story.  Add to that an unlikeable and unsympathetic leading character and you have picture-postcard quality beautiful emptiness, which is this movie.

I got through it hoping that it would have some point or resolution to tie it all together and make the journey worthwhile.  It didn't happen.  The story isn't here and the character development doesn't happen.  You have to watch the extra on the DVD where the director ""explains"" the movie.  It's helpful, as the movie isn't all that clear.

I'd stay away from this.  It's a nicely shot and well put-together film in search of a meaning and lacking a story.  It's not even worth a rental except maybe to get to see the scenery and shots around Europe.",1170201600,21,868,4.850340136054422
