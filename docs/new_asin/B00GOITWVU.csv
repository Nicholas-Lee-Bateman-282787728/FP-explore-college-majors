6095590,4,B00GOITWVU,"I am by no means an expert critic on movies, but having said that I believe that this movie is well worth watching. At the risk of raising the wrath of those with negative comments, I think that if you are able to enjoy a good creepy movie that you will not be disappointed. Yes, this is a low budget film, it is indie and above all it is in Red Bluff! But, having said that I believed it was well done and there are many positive aspects to this creation by the October People. The cinematography was exceptional, the sound was fantastic and the story was well thought out. Was it the best movie Ive ever seen? No. But, from previous reviews I went in expecting less and was pleasantly surprised. I thoroughly enjoyed the commentaries as well. If there is anything to be gleaned from the variety of reviews, it should be the disparity in ratings, which leads me to believe that there is more going on than simply whether or not the movie was enjoyable. Do yourself a favor, watch it.",1393286400,7,984,4.353260869565218
6095591,2,B00GOITWVU,"I agree with the movie guy's review of this film...the characters become insufferable after awhile and the outdoor photography and impending sense of doom was about all I could salvage out of it...if you get it, keep your finger on the mute and fast-forward buttons...",1393027200,2,268,4.977777777777778
6095592,2,B00GOITWVU,"Sam (Trin Miller) inherits a house owned by her aunt. It is one she lived in as a child until five when her parents put her up for adoption. Her memory of the place is worse than a Watergate defendant. Her friends include Mark (Brandon Anthony), her ex-boyfriend who just broke up with his girlfriend. Roman (Josh Truax)is bummed out because Caitlin (Andi Norris) who has all the decent lines is leaving for six months. We really don't know what the heck their relationship is. Eric (D'Angelo Midili) is the caretaker. He remembers Sam, but doesn't give her any important details as why she was put up for adoption at five. All three guys are loosely and sadly based on the creepiness of Norman Bates. Is there a writer in the house?

Things escalate as Sam sees and hears things blending the past with the present. The green monster complicates matters among all the testosterone. At an hour into the film you get your first WTF moment as someone slips out of character...or perhaps into character.

The downfall of the film is that it creates only one decent character, Caitlin. The ending becomes bizarre and doesn't offer up any real closure, except what the audience might surmise. The film for the most part was boring. The ending should have brought the story together and gave meaning to all those boring parts. And what was that abandoned building they stopped at in the beginning? It looked like the dome of a small experimental reactor. A good script would have tied this stuff together, instead we get the sloppiness too often found in indie productions, i.e. let's start shooting and see what looks good afterwards.

6095593,1,B00GOITWVU,"I never thought there would be a horror/thriller (whatever you want to call it), that would be so lackluster, that I would end up falling asleep repeatedly, but thats what happens when you watch The Invoking.

The Plot: Sam has inherited a house in some small town, so she decides to check it out with her friends, Caitlin, Roman and Mark. Sam was adopted as a child and feels that this house will reveal more about her past. When they arrive, they are greeted by the caretaker Eric, who seems to know more about Sam than what hes saying. Sam soon starts seeing strange things, and doesn't know if they are real or imaginary. Can she find out what happened in the past that is making her see things in the present?

Review: Where do I start? This movie was just BAD. The story is so slow paced and badly written that you not only get bored, you don't even understand whats happening. Lets start with Sams friends. I don't get why Caitlin has to take six months off to be on vacation instead of graduating, or why Roman is always recording weird noises throughout the film. Other than Sam, there is no back story to any of these characters for the way they act. Then we have the sudden relationship hopping between the friends. Mark decides to make a move for Sam after his breakup, but then he also flirts with Caitlin when he knows Roman likes her, why? Furthermore, while I don't want to give away the ending, I really didn't understand the relationship between Eric and Sam till the end. Were they lovers or siblings? Is he real or a ghost? Does he have supernatural powers? Is Mark possessed in the end? There are so many unanswered questions that not only make you tired of boredom, but annoyed with the way this film was made.

Probably the ONLY thing good about this movie was the cinematic still scenes you see of the country side, but even that becomes a scene filler after a while due to lack of any story line. While I thought that the actors who played Sam, Mark and Roman did a good job (hey, they did the best they could with what they were given), the girl who played Caitlin hammed up her lines way too much, and the creepy caretaker Eric seemed to be high on all the scenes to be taken seriously.

Its obvious that whoever posted 4-5 stars for The Invoking are connected to the cast/crew somehow and just want to create a false hype about it. Please avoid watching this movie, its not worth it!",1392940800,6,2411,4.3991031390134525
6095594,1,B00GOITWVU,"I read about this movie on a horror site (can't remember which), so I decided to check it out.  Let me tell you,...it was a STRUGGLE to make it through this.  Every minute that passed felt like an hour while watching it.  Many of the other reviews praise the acting and character ""development"".  Unfortunately, at LEAST 2 of those reviews came from people that were LISTED IN THE MOVIES CREDITS!  Therefore, they should be discarded.  Here's my take on the film.

The story revolves around a group of 4 friends: Sam (Trin Miller), Caitlin (Andi Norris), Mark (Brandon Anthony), and Roman (Josh Truax).  Sam has just received news that an Aunt she didn't even know existed has passed away and left her the land and house she was living in.  (This story has been done WAY too many times already)  The group decides to make a vacation of it and head there to check out Sam's newly acquired property.  Along the way, we discover that Mark and Sam were once and item, but something happened that caused them to break up.  Also, Roman and Caitlin are just ""friends"", but Roman obviously is looking for more.  That, in itself, is really the only ""development"" we get.

After arriving to the property, they are greeted by Eric (D'Angelo Midili), who is apparently the ""caretaker"" of the property.  How he makes money, I'm not sure, but he spends his days looking after the house and fixing anything that needs repairing.  Of course, Eric is the same age as the others, so Sam invites him to join in from time to time.  Somehow (beyond my imagination), Mark is supposed to be some sort of ""tough guy"".  He doesn't like the fact that Sam continues to ask Eric to join in and promptly lets his feelings be known.  The problem here is Mark just ISN'T the ""tough guy"" type.  At least, to me he doesn't appear that way.  Of course, of the 3 guys on screen, I guess he could be be the tough one, but whatever?

During their stay at the house, Sam starts having these hallucinations involving a past that she can't remember.  These are played out by her friends.  Of course, Sam then can not distinguish the real from the fake, so she begins to hurt her friends thinking they are the family that gave her up for adoption.  It's all sort of confusing to watch.

The film plays out just the way you expect it will.  Up until the very last scene, that is.  For some reason, the movie does NOTHING to set up the final scene or explain what made it actually come to be.  Basically the story in this movie is the major problem.  Don't get me wrong, the acting is beyond TERRIBLE!  But without a story that flows properly from one scene to the next, you have NOTHING. (In my opinion)

So, for reasons that I've listed I can not recommend this movie to anyone beyond the persons involved.  And if you read some of the previous reviews, you'll know that they love it!

Final Verdict:  PASS!  Avoid this movie like the plague!

6095595,5,B00GOITWVU,"I was fortunet enough to see the film in 2012. I was blown away by the writing and character delopement.

6095599,5,B00GOITWVU,"I got to see this film while it was at a film festival, and it was a really fun and suspenseful movie. While it gets off to a leisurely start, that's all the better for character development, in my book. The tension builds throughout the film and it really plays more like a mystery unfolding, but with definite horror/mystical aspects to it. If you want your thrillers with excellent story and character and don't need gratuitous action (there IS action, it just corresponds honestly with the story), then this would be a great choice for you. Most of the acting, story and direction are very good, but the acting by D'Angelo Midili is really the scene-stealer in this release--see him now before he becomes a big star!!!

Spoiler

4 teens (college age students that act like 12 year olds) inherit a house. There's a creepy caretaker that's about their age. Caretaker is the long lost love of one of the girls (although their actual age difference appears to be much more than would make sense for the story). Caretaker has killed off the long lost love's family and lured the girl here. Caretaker kills off the friends and now they're in love forever. These last 5 sentences are actually better written then ""The Invoking"". (Even though I intentionally used ""then"" instead of ""than"".) (And even though I used way too many parenthesis to write this review.) (Even though I used ""and"" to start my last sentence.)

6095606,2,B00GOITWVU,"The story in The Invoking is a pretty cool, classic adventure turned nightmare and that works for the first half of the film. The characters are emotive and portray some pretty convincing roles. There is some lag when the story arch hits the midway point, and instead of rushing into a thrilling overload of horror and melodrama, things fall a bit flat. The vision goes from one of almost paranormal chills to one that seems patch-worked between missing intent and scattered dramatics. I felt that something got lost in the translation toward the last act of the story. The first part created a great character building connection between me and the characters, the second act created an atmosphere of haunting unease but the last act seemed lost or held back. Plus there is absolutely nothing paranormal, supernatural or invoking in the story save the lead characters, Sams, recovered memories of a sketchy past. I felt the marketing for this film is very misleading and that is really off-putting.

The special effects and horror elements in this film are almost non-existent. I am not sure if that was intentional or a budget crunching thing but I really expected more from The Invoking and was left with a major feeling of disappointment. The few horror moments in the film are lightly braised upon with standard effects tricks that work but considering there were so few moments and most of the film is melodrama I feel Lifetime Movie Network is more this films audience. The ending was a total miss and made very little since. The meat of the mystery caretaker and Sams relationship is almost missing from the story. The moments touched upon are not enough to justify how this film ends. So really most of the film is a fail considering the pay-off, after such a suspense build-up, is really not worth the time invested. I say skip The Invoking.",1432166400,,1851,4.802507836990595

It takes its time, building tension and conflict amongst its characters, steadily creating an increasingly foreboding atmosphere, and that's something I really enjoy.

6095634,4,B00GOITWVU,"Southern gothic supernatural thrillers seem to be gaining some momentum lately. ""Last Kind Words"" and ""A Haunting in Connecticut 2: Ghosts of Georgia"" immediately come to mind. The middle of nowhere is a cheap and easy place to make a movie. There's no denying that there's very little creepier than the darkness of the woods and the isolation felt in a rural setting. RLJ Entertainment's ""The Invoking"" is another fine example of what can be done with a small budget in the backwoods of any state's countryside.

Samantha Harris and her friends embark on a trip to visit a house she's inherited from a family she's never met. As soon as they arrive, Samantha starts having terrifying visions she can't explain. Are these haunting experiences trying to reveal something about her forgotten past? Can she trust the young man commissioned to watch over her new property as he slowly opens up to Samantha about their past friendship she can't remember?

Producer/Director/Co-writer Jeremy Berg knows how to drum up scares without the use of fancy special effects and CGI. His style is reminiscent of Hitchcock and the likes. He works more on your nerves and jump scares than most new filmmakers. Sometimes having less money to work with makes you try harder to create genuine scares without the crutch of modern technology.

There are some impressive special features included in the DVD version of ""The Invoking."" Two audio commentary tracks are provided with the actors, writers, producers, and Director Jeremy Berg. A ""Behind the Scenes"" documentary really makes you appreciate the effort the filmmakers and cast put into making this movie in record time on a micro-budget.

Although it's not rated, ""The Invoking"" does contain material some might find objectionable. There's violence, adult situations, and language in it. However, no nudity is found. I would say if it were put in front of the MPAA, they'd give it a PG-13 rating.

""The Invoking"" is a worthy entry in the gothic horror sub-genre. The movie is made even scarier because it takes place in a house that's fairly modern (think 1980s style) versus the overused centuries-old mansion we're so used to seeing in supernatural films. Although it's not perfect and some of the acting is rough, the overall atmosphere and story trumps any negatives you could pick out.",1396483200,7,2326,5.015544041450777

6095645,2,B00GOITWVU,"I rented this movie largely because of the trailer which showed just enough to intrigue me. turns out those clips weren't a prelude to more, they simply stood on their own. there was no more excitement than what was shown in the trailer clips. I am a hardcore horror fan, and although my requisites for a good movie don't have to include gore and violence, I felt this was totally lacking in what I assumed would be escalating violence stemming from the clips. it wasn't a horrible movie. it just fell flat in all the categories I anticipate in a horror movie. and as a side bar, the acting was only mediocre at best. i'm sure there will be viewers who find this movie engaging, but if you are a true horror fan like myself, I think you will be disappointed.",1393545600,3,758,4.382978723404255
6095646,1,B00GOITWVU,"This movie is downright horrible. Nothing about it is good and the acting is ridiculously bad. Plus, whose house is that on the DVD cover because it sure wasn't the house in the movie.

P.S. This is not a supernatural movie.",1393545600,2,224,4.463414634146342
6095647,2,B00GOITWVU,"After reading several reviews of The Invoking online, I, being a horror fan, duly watched the film. I must say that I was underwhelmed with the frights. The story can be a bit plodding and superficial in the beginning. The story is basically about a girl who inherits her aunt's home in a rural town. The place is never stated. She brings along her ex-boyfriend and and two other chums to check out her new digs. They are greeted by a strange war veteran who is, or is not, the caretaker of the home in question. What follows is a story of lost memory, apparent child abuse, and a killer/lover relationship with the main character. The flashbacks of lost memories tries to tell the viewer the back-story, however, the sudden flashes of familial abuse and bible verse spewing are trite and actually confuse the underlying, slow decay of the overall story.
  The ending is annoying at best. I predicted this so called plot twist early in the narrative. An astute viewer will likely also predict who really killed the leading characters aunt.",1393372800,,1039,4.7032967032967035
6095648,5,B00GOITWVU,"The Invoking is an extremely well-made and well-acted independent horror film. The film is evocative of many of the classic slow-burn horror films from the 70s such as ""Let's Scare Jessica to Death"" and other psychological horror films such as ""Session 9"". The movie is very well written, the characters and their interactions all feel real, and the suspense and mystery is slowly built all the way through the film and keeps you guessing until the very end. The cinematography is also very well done, and is a breath of fresh air compared to all the careless ""found footage"" horror films that currently flood the market. The film eschews cheap jump scares and musical stingers in favor of a slow creeping terror that gets under your skin and stays there. It is filled with elements that I as a horror fan love to see in a film, and I found it to be a truly chilling and enjoyable ride. Unlike many other modern horror films, The Invoking doesn't insult your intelligence; it engages it.",1393372800,6,987,4.67816091954023

Fantastic imagery, and an intriguing story is painted once you pick up on it. Confusing at first, but give it a minute. It will get there. And by the end, you will want to start it over.

Tense in the right places, and made me jump in a few. Love a movie that can do that.",1487289600,2,375,3.986666666666667
