Difficult to watch but highly recommend for it's strong performances, great direction and script.",1432684800,,285,5.651162790697675

7850509,4,6303560555,"This film is very well directed even though the actors are quite young they give a good performance. This film is about one woman's fight for her children but it does not help how she conducts herself. The DVD is of good quality but we had trouble getting it onto the English menu without the sub titles, you have to have patience. All in all a good film but not for the faint hearted.",1385337600,,385,4.216216216216216

7850511,4,6303560555,"Once more, Director Ken Loach turns his focus on the poor and the dispossessed and develops a scathing attack on the British government's inability to see beyond regulations. Ladybird, Ladybird is an uncompromising look at an all-too-common situation: the abused child who becomes the illfitting parent, caught up in circumstances beyond her limited capabilities. She seeks help from the social service system but that system is unable to grasp the complexities of this woman's life. Though as is his wont, Loach's sympathies are with Maggie, yet the film is no leftwing apology. Loach makes Chrissy Rock's character as unsympathetic as he can. Yet the viewer still cannot remain detached from her seemingly hopeless life. Additionally, Vladimir Vega's performace as Jorge, while understated, is a powerful reminder of the ultimate value of hope. Rock is stunning in her acting debut. A truly riveting but disturbing viewing exoperience.",1288915200,,937,5.424657534246576
7850512,5,6303560555,"LADYBIRD LADYBIRD, a movie you can also find here in the VHS standard&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ladybird-Ladybird/dp/6303560555/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ladybird Ladybird</a>, earned two awards at the 1994 Berlin Film festival. The whole filmography of director Ken Loach is composed of social or political movies and this corpus is one of the most interesting filmographies of the recent British cinematic production.

With this film, Ken Loach's intentions are clear, the director wants to denounce how social services and justice handle the case of so-called unfit mothers in Great Britain. I personally didn't know that justice could break the legal bond between a mother and her children and deny her the right to ever see them again. As a human being, this regulation shocks me even if I'm aware that it's often better to move away the children in peculiar cases. In the dramatic situation exposed by Ken Loach, the obvious thing to do is to force the mother to undergo a psychological treatment. Any other solution can only worsen the situation.

But don't be afraid, LADYBIRD LADYBIRD is not at all a TV documentary film because Ken Loach is also a talented director who knows how to harpoon the audience. Just think about the scene of the biscuits when Maggie and Jorge must receive in the British manner numerous social workers and keep quiet in front of them while they're in fact boiling. That's great cinema.

7850514,5,6303560555,"This is one of those movies that I didn't enjoy, but I would recommend it to most people. Although I didn't feel enjoyment, I was extremely moved by this movie. I felt a gambit of emotions during this movie: sorrow, anguish, frustration, love, awe, and wonder. I felt anguish, sorrow, and frustration over the main character's predicament. She just can't seem to dig herself out of a hole. I felt love, awe, and wonder over the relationship she finds with Jorge. Chrissy Rock does an excellent job as a single mother in England that has a pattern of entering into unhealthy realtionships. As a result of an abusive relationship, she loses her four children. Her life takes a turn when she meets Jorge, a south american refugee. He is loving, kind, and patient. Together they start a life together, but her history comes back to haunt them. She does her best to change her destructive patterns, but unfortunately her character defects get the best of her. I was extremely moved by how real these depictions were. Her story ends in hope. If you like Ken Loach movies, you'll really appreciate this one. It was worth every tear. I highly recommend it.",1102204800,4,1148,4.7164179104477615
