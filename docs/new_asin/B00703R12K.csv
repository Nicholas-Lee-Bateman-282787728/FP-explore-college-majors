8507523,2,B00703R12K,"This is like an episode of America's Dumbest Criminals but set in Korea.

In one scene, the hero is angry and so he is tightening his fist as hard as he can around a large shard of glass. Blood comes flowing out. There are so many important tendons and ligaments in your hand. If you did that, you would need immediate and expert surgery to repair it if you wanted any hope of ever using your hand again and even then you might lose significant use of it. Just stupid fight scenes like that. If you want to be a bad ass for more than one fight, it is a good idea to minimize the unnecessary damage you do to yourself, right. I mean really, gratuitously injuring yourself is the height of stupidity, am I right. Pretty hard to be a bad ass in the future when your right hand is a useless stump. I also didn't like that the movie went from the convicts being smart enough to plan an elaborate escape from jail and then after that they make moronic decision after moronic decision. They ended up being so stupid that it was impossible to root for any of them. I started feeling happy each time one of them got killed.",1389312000,,1114,4.230046948356808
