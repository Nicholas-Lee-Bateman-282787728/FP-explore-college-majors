1865670,2,B00008WJE5,"I have bought all three DVD packs preceding this one, and they are all superb from every technical and artistic angle but thats where my collection will end. For me the show finished with the exit of Henry Blake and I would not want to relive its slow demise with the introduction of tearjerking scripts, less emphasis on comedy and a few excruciating new characters. BJ the family man, Charles the pompous 'straight man' and 'grandad' Col. Potter. From a brash new rule-breaking show to formula-driven banality, it all started with Season Four!",1056931200,15,545,4.870967741935484
1865671,4,B00008WJE5,"I didn't really get into MASH until my senior year at Susquehanna University when I caught the reruns on FX.  It was the final episode of Season five when Margaret/Hotlips got married and the first (hour-long) episode of season six where Frank Burns left (Larry Linville, according to rumors, didn't want to be casttyped as a whiney by-the-book villain) and Charles Winchester came in.  From then on, I was hooked.
Don't get me wrong, though.  I liked the first three seasons of MASH, but it was the characters of BJ and Col. Potter that helped win me over along with Radar, Hawkeye, and Klinger.  Now with the fourth season weeks away from coming to DVD, I'm still counting the days to see more of MASH, uncut (for obvious reasons, FX cuts out certain parts of the episodes for time).",1056067200,9,785,4.625899280575539

1865678,5,B00008WJE5,"that M*A*S*H would become one of television's all-time pride-&-joys is astonishing if not miraculous when one learns that the series only ever existed because someone at Fox figured, ""hey, maybe we can get a couple years' more mileage out of those sets we built for the movie."" yup, one of the leading candidates for the title of Greatest Series In TV History was born as a textbook cash-grab.
there's also the fact that this recipe hasn't exactly proven itself infallible. how many other movie-based tv shows have proven worth the bother? a few that worked come to mind - The Odd Couple, Alice, Buffy The Vampire Slayer - but the vast majority have only served to highlight the movie's charms by lacking or falling short of them. and for that matter, how many of those exceptions actually managed to top the movie the way M*A*S*H does?
well, time was on M*A*S*H's side in more ways that one. the Vietnam War, of which the book and/or movie had been meant as a parable, was still going all too strong. as it happened, it would be two years into the series' run that the Nixon Administration finally saw the light an ceased to beat the dead horse, but the war had already dragged so long that it might as well be two millennia. consider how the pilot began with the caption, ""Korea, 1950...a hundred years ago.""
in a more general sense, the industry in general had decided to come of age and stop shying away from controversy. (for all intents and purposes, the official date of this transition would be the premiere of All In the Family in 1970.) up to this point certain things had been strictly taboo on the small screen. much as i love many sitcoms from the '60s, the fact is, there were certain issues they were better off not bothering with, because standards wouldn't approve the episode until the issue was turned completely on it's head.
the battle of the sexes, for instance. the weakest and least satisfying episode of Gilligan's Island is easily ""St. Gilligan & The Dragon,"" in which the women demand equality. the episode not only pared the matter down to it's barest atoms, it completely distorted the characters in the process. Ginger, Mary Ann, and Mrs. Howell, whom we'd love in any other episode, are suddenly argumentative shrews, whilst Gilligan, The Skipper, The Professor, and Mr. Howell rather jarringly become proud sexists bordering on misogyny. they as much as state in so many words that they've consciously exploited the women and have every intention of continuing to do so.
later when television got Socially Relevant, something like The Mary Tyler Moore Show could explore the issue of women's rights in depth, could actually DO something with it, and it would come off as legitimate grievance and something to think about. on Gilligan and it's contemporaries, the matter was so ruthlessly homogenized that it felt like little more than a gimmicky excuse to pick a fight. and why? because The Revolution Would Not Be Televised and all that crap.
but suddenly television in general somehow found the chutzpah to televise The Revolution after all. and no series took greater or more justifiable advantage of this new leeway than M*A*S*H.
the 4th season is the turning point where the series finally came into it's own. most obviously, it actually benefited from what's usually as precarious a move as a series can make. character change-overs have a history of scuttling series, the way they mess with the ""magic."" but in the alternative reality where the 4077th was stationed, different rules applied. because let's face it, Henry Blake had pushed his flaky doofus shtick about as far as it would go, and Trapper John was a cardboard vacuum who'd never been terrible interesting in the first place. so really, the series couldn't help but prosper for the arrival of gruff but lovable Col. Potter and multifaceted family man BJ Hunnicutt.
(ironically, McLean Stevenson is often chided on the grounds that his departure from M*A*S*H is the ""all-time great bad career move"" in the history of television if not show-business itself. in fact, he did the series a truly tremendous favor by stepping aside. his character frankly wouldn't worked anymore. what the series was evolving into needed a strong leader like Potter, not a milquetoast ninny like Blake, at the helm.)
the series was under so lucky a star, in fact, that they would again beat the same odds two years later. no disrespect to Frank Burns, who was fun while he lasted and in fact may well be the quintessential ""love to hate"" television character. really, has any other character been such a delicate balance of formidable tyrant and pathetic weenie? but again, his shtick was inevitably running out of steam and approaching a sell-by date. when that happened, the void was filled by upper-class snob Charles Emerson Winchester III. he too was initially a rival of our heroes, but would adapt into an ally, even a friend. his snootiness never quite wore off, but enough of it was gradually stripped away to reveal a heart as well as a conscience.
how did the series manage to sidestep this landmine not once but twice? it's simple but profound guide was textbook common sense. the usual mistake with replacement characters is to bring in someone as close to what they've just lost as possible. but M*A*S*H's new recruits were never carbon-copies, they were characters in their own right.
later still, a similar situation arose, and the series knew not to rock the boat. Gary Burghoff, well into his 30s, felt he was losing the innocent quality central to his 20ish character, Radar O'Reilly. in the wake of his subsequent departure, they chose to simply promote the already established character of Max Klinger to his job as company clerk. it worked out well, despite the fact that Radar is the one character the series actually suffered for losing.
i don't mean to suggest that this was the only reason M*A*S*H prospered, indeed got better with the passage of time, although it does reflect a long-standing theory of mine. critics and the like are always saying that writing is everything in a series, but i'm convinced it has more to do with characters than anything else. just ask yourself, what are you more likely to do: forgive substandard writing after taking a liking to the characters, or put up with obnoxious or annoying characters for the sake of what some critic claims is wonderful writing? yes, writing is important, and everyone reaps the rewards of good writing, but let's face it, nobody TUNES IN for the writing. civilian viewers have been known to completely forget that it even has to be written!
lauded or not, writing was another significant factor in the series' maturation. the series, which hadn't exactly stayed inside the box to begin with, was now daring to push that envelope even further. two episodes in particular demonstrate that newfound sophistication.
one episode is titled simply  ""Hawkeye"" for the logical reason that he is one series regular featured therein. after his jeep rolls over and he sends for help, he treats a Korean family to a semi-garbled version of his life story. he thinks he has a concussion and is trying to keep from fainting, despite it being established that he know the chances of dying in a faint after a concussion are minimal.
in ""The Interview,"" the 4077th staff find themselves the subject of television documentary. the episode is a little marred by the opening announcement ""the following is in black-&-white,"" because hel-LO, television in the '50s was always black-&-white. the color tv set wouldn't even be invented until the '60s.
but that blemish aside, this unique episode is a mesmerizing triumph, getting up close and personal in a way more orthodox episodes couldn't. it was so well received, in fact, that a few years later the formula was recycled for the series' inevitable ""clip show."" (somehow, this empty shortcut concept was practically obligatory for much of the '70s and '80s.)
what's really unique about ""The Interview,"" though, is another thing no other episode could get away with: it was predominantly ad-libbed.
the series was becoming positively profound. once it had been simply about people in a difficult plight going to silly extremes to maintain their sanity, usually at the expense of the pomposity of military bureaucracy. from here on in the tragedy element of war would be explored with new fervor, masking for a more even balance with the humor. it was around this time, in fact, that the term ""dramedy"" was coined specifically in reference to  M*A*S*H.
it's often said that a series has to grow. M*A*S*H is one of the very, very, VERY few which actually managed to do so.",1498867200,,8667,4.8712737127371275

1865726,3,B00008WJE5,"The season that features the infamous episode, ""The Interview."" The episode that many cast members proclaimed to be the high point of the series, the pinnacle.

I take major issue with that. Instead, how about the low point of the series for Alan Alda...? How about Alda at his smarmiest. People complain that the series went down the tubes after the departure of Henry Blake and Trapper John at the end of the third season. I say nonsense. Yes, it became a bit more message orientated from time to time, and yes, Alda's character became less of a scamp and more of a saint, but only from time to time, and only gradually. But at any rate, this episode features Alda at his worst (mellow dramatic, preachy, insufferable).

On the other end of the spectrum, Gary Burghoff (the O'Reilly character) really shines here. Not too saccharine and not too cynical. I think it's his finest work of the series. Not bad for a character who frequently begins his sentences with conjunctions and ends them with prepositions.

1865778,5,B00008WJE5,"MASH was one of those television shows that I didn't watch when it was first on. I was just a kid and so maybe the sarcastic humor was just over my head back in those days. But now that I'm older, I've really started to appreciate shows like this one and ""All in the Family"", two of the true classic 1970's sitcoms. The current price for these shows make them a must have.

Season 4 of MASH is probably the best of it's 11 seasons. Colonel Potter arrives at the beginning of the season to head the unit. BJ Honeycutt also arrives and is instantly a perfect counterpart and collaborator to Hawkeye's antics. The main thing that struck me is that this season can be viewed in its totality as a self-contained look into the lives of the MASH characters. From the opening arrival of Colonel Potter, in the letters home that the characters write throughout the season, to the last episode where the unit is interviewed by a TV reporter, its like you are given a window into the world of the 4077th. You could give this season to someone who has never watched MASH and for them it would be like watching a long and powerful documentary or mini-series. Of course, they will then want to watch more because the characters quickly become endearing.

Overall, there is hardly a bad episode in this 24 episode season. One of the truly best episodes is called ""Hawkeye"" where Captain Pierce is injured in a jeep accident near the home of a Korean family and suffers a concussion. He needs to stay alert and keep himself from falling asleep and so he just keeps talking to the family. Alan Alda is the only MASH character to appear in this episode.

1865786,5,B00008WJE5,"SPOILERS FOLLOW

The fourth season of ""MASH"" is the first one that sees huge changes in casting and in tone.  The departure of McLean Stevenson was addressed by the show's creative staff in the third season finale, but Wayne Rogers' leaving was a more sudden decision that provoked a different way to look at the series as a whole.  Out of this undesirable situation comes ""Welcome to Korea,"" the triumphant hour-long fourth season premiere that galvanized the show in the wake of significant change.

""Welcome to Korea"" is a landmark show for the series, being the first of four hour-long premieres in the show's eleven year run(the fifth, sixth, and tenth season premieres also had an extra thirty minutes).  The extra time wouldn't mean anything if there weren't a good story to tell, and as the fourth season opens, Hawkeye's on R&R while Trapper has suddenly gone home.  The escalating setup features a stunned Hawkeye racing to say goodbye to Trapper with Radar in tow to welcome Trapper's replacement, Captain B.J. Hunnicutt.  Played by Mike Farrell, B.J. is a very different sort of character than Trapper, but a wise alteration to keep the show fresh.  An easygoing family man, he is a gentle counterpoint to Trapper's playboy.  On the way back to the 4077th, Hawkeye, Radar, and B.J. travel through gritty situations that bond them and indoctrinate the fresh-faced newcomer.

Though he is only in the episode as a tease at the end, Harry Morgan's Colonel Sherman Potter is immediately intriguing.  In his character's proper introductory episode ""Change of Command,"" Mr. Morgan proves an able replacement for McLean Stevenson.  I give Larry Gelbart and his creative staff credit for trying something new.  Potter is not Henry Blake.  Strict and competent, Potter is also humane, sensible and kind.  He is the best of Henry while adding his own gifts to the equation.  An Army lifer, he is doing his job the best way he can.  An essentially peaceful man with a strong sense of discipline and duty, Col. Sherman Potter is one of the best characters ever created on ""MASH"" and television as a whole.

The fourth season of ""MASH"" is the beginning of the maturation of the series.  It is the birth of a creative steeliness that helped make ""MASH"" an all-time television classic.",1281398400,,2282,4.895833333333333

1865788,5,B00008WJE5,"Season four introduced two cast members who would become integral to the show. BJ Hunnicutt, and Colonel Potter.

The first episode ""Welcome to Korea"" was the first hour length MASH episode and rightly so, showing BJ's introduction to war and to Hawkeye Pierce, particularly poignant was the scene in the field after BJ witnessed his first real carnage. The writing was understated and the acting was as perfect as MASH ever got.

I think my favorite other episode was ""Deluge"" which was a collection of fluffy  stateside shorts interspersed with some of the most gripping and gut wrenching MASH scenes ever shot on a night when everything goes wrong and the Chinese are pouring over the borders...this was Larry Gelbart's last season and has some of his finest work.

Some think that MASH ended after season three I felt it just got started 4-8 were a golden era in the show in my opinion...an opinion shared by many.

1865789,3,B00008WJE5,"MASH season 4 is a mixed bag...some good stories...and then some preachy ones. If you are a fan, you might want to

1865790,5,B00008WJE5,"I've always thought that television shows are like people. They are born, grow up, grow old, and die. In the fourth season of M*A*S*H, the show officially reached its maturity, transforming from a sophomoric, slapstick farce into a ""dramedy"" of increasing sensitivity and sophistication. Sure, the lowbrow jokes about latrines and the nurses' chest X-rays were still there, but more and more, M*A*S*H became increasingly determined to examine moral and ethical quandaries, the effects of bureaucratic stupidity on human life, and the manifold horrors of war.

The third season had ended with the departure of Maclean Stevenson's genial but weak-willed Lt. Col. Henry Blake, and in the hiatus between seasons, the nominal co-star of the show, Wayne Roger's gin-swilling, nurse-chasing Cpt. ""Trapper"" John McIntyre also elected to leave without filming a Goodbye episode. This put the writers and producers in rather a tricky position, as they had to replace two characters in short order without shell-shocking the fans. The skill with which this reshuffling was handled is a testament to producers Larry Gelbart and Gene Reynolds, who rarely saw a curveball they couldn't whack out of the park.

As S4 opens, the camp is therefore suffering under the iron-fisted but incompetent leadership of Maj. Frank Burns (Larry Linville) and his sidekick-cum-lover-cum-dominatrix, Maj. Margaret Houlihan (Loreta Swit) who have replaced the dead-and-departed Blake as camp commander. The camp's chief surgeon, subversive, and lothario, Hawkeye Pierce (Alan Alda), returns from a sake-soaked leave in Tokyo to discover to his horror that his roomate and best friend Trapper has been shipped home in his absence. In his place arrives clean-cut young doctor named B.J. Hunnicutt (Mike Farrell), who rapidly becomes Hawk's sidekick even as he struggles to acclimatize to conditions in Korea. No sooner has a new routine been established, however, than yet more waves are made by the arrival of a new C.O., Col. Sherman T. Potter (Harry Morgan), who is long  on horse-sense but short on temper. In the mean time, Father Mulcahey (William Christopher) is still struggling to save souls (and feel needed), Corporal Klinger (Jamie Farr) is still trying to cross-dress his way to a Section Eight discharge, and gentle company clerk Walther ""Radar"" O'Reilly (Gary Burgdorff) is still quietly holding the camp together with one hand while he clutches his teddy bear with the other. All against the ususal backdrop of bombs, shells, gangrenous limbs, bloodthirsty officers, and Army bureacrats.

Season Four boasted an unusual number of outstanding episodes, starting with the first, a two-parter called ""Welcome to Korea"", which introduces B.J. in true M*A*S*H fashion. [In short order he participates in the theft of a general's jeep, gets shot at by a sniper, sees a Korean girl blown up by a mine, witnesses a platoon of American soldiers turned to hamburger by mortar fire, drinks himself senseless at Rosie's bar, and passes out in Margaret's arms.] Other notables include:

""Hawkeye"" -  An injured Hawk is stranded with a Korean family that speaks no English. This episode is essentially a one man show, and almost the entire story is shot in a series of long takes on a small indoor set. Outstanding writing and acting couple with a willingness to take heavy creative risks - this is the only episode in which no other cast members appear, even in cameos, and gives Alan Alda a chance to do some first-class stage acting.

""The Late Captain Pierce"" - Hawkeye is mistakenly declared killed in action by the Army, a circumstance he finds amusing until he realizes his beloved father has been notified of his ""death."" This episode travels a brutal emotional arc as Hawkeye, unable to contact his dad, goes from said amusement to irritation, aggravation and eventually despair. A classic example of ""dramedy"" in action.

""Deluge"" - The Chinese suddenly enter the Korean war against U.S., much to the chagrin of General MacArthur...and the gang at the 4077. As Allied forces fall back from the ""Red hordes"", an unceasing flow of wounded and dying men push the whole staff to - and past - their physical and emotional limits.

""The Interview"" - M*A*S*H was often at its best when it ""stepped out of its formula"" completely. This episode is shot in a documentary format, showing the characters from the perspective of the reporter and his audience. There are some particularly outstanding performances here - Alan Alda's bleary-eyed emotional exhaustion; Larry Linville's chilling depiction of Frank's mind; Harry Morgan looking wonderfully uncomfortable and stiff.

There are a number of other first-rate episodes as well, including ""Every Time I See You"", ""Smilin' Jack"", and various storylines in which characters write home to their families, a device M*A*S*H somehoe manage to overuse without ever wearing out. There is also a very moving and well-acted story ("""") featuring Sydney Freedman and Col. Flagg in which a bombardier with a head injury wakes up thinking he is Jesus Christ.
My only beef with this product is its low physical quality. For only [...], I wasn't expecting a lot of frills, but between the shoddy transfer, the lack of A N Y special features (even a pamphlet with an episode guide) and the nasty tendency of Disc 2 to glitch up, you'd be better off buying a used version of the Collector's Edition.",1262563200,3,5403,5.136518771331058

1865792,5,B00008WJE5,"Perhaps the largest transition of the many in the eleven year run of MASH comes in this season with the addition of Mike Farrell (as new surgeon BJ Hunnicut) and Harry Morgan (as veteran surgeon of three wars Commanding Officer Colonel Sherman Potter.)

Still present are Klinger, Radar, Frank, Margaret and the ever-present Hawkeye.

The tone of the show shifted significantly.  Where Trapper and Henry Blake had been married men not above a little good-natured adultery, BJ and Colonel Potter are devoted husbands.  Even Hawkeye begins to be rebuffed by nurses.  The earlier seasons were decidedly sillier (a frequent sight was Henry Blake being nearly blown up in comic fashion).  Harry Morgan brings both a no-nonsense military professionalism and a good-natured, common sense approach to military leadership.

The one hour opening episode shows Hawkeye returning from a 3 day debauchery to find Frank Burns in command and Trapper just left.  He hikes a ride with Radar to the air base and finds he has barely missed Trapper as Radar picks up B.J.  This wise episode gives the viewer an opportunity to miss Trapper as well prior to establishing, by the end of the episode, that BJ is just as capable of standing up to ""Old Ferret Face"".  In the second episode Frank finds that his Command has lasted just one episode as he is being relieved by ""Regular Army"" (as opposed to the draftees called up into active reserve duty) Colonel Potter.  At first Hawkeye is horrified to find a 30 year career Army officer in command, but by the time they share their first operating room and first trip to the Swamp's still Hawkeye and BJ find that their new CO is a kindred spirit and his experience is a bonus.",1252886400,4,1702,4.794520547945205

1865798,3,B00008WJE5,"At the same time, Robert Altman's ""M*A""S*H"" came out. It, too found an audience, and truth be told many who enjoyed ""Patton"" enjoyed ""M*A*S*H"". It was just plain funny, and the anti-military theme was subtle. Altman walked a brilliant tightrope between a pro-American and unpatriotic premise. There is no doubt that Altman intended it as an anti-Vietnam movie. It was written by former Communist Ring Lardner, Jr. Lardner had been Blacklisted, and this fact featured prominently in the politics of the film's aura. It was based on a sexy paperback novel about surgeons in Korea. The film was set in Korea, yet made every possible attempt to convey the image that it was actually Vietnam. Many of the movie's set pieces were deliberately Vietnamese in nature and costume, for that very purpose. To the extent that it was unpatriotic, it subtly described ""regular Army"" officers as unyielding, intolerant Christians, utterly blinded by stupid jingoism. The draftees, however, are funny and attractive as they drink and love their way through a bevy of good-looking nurses, all while saving lives in the style of comic Galahads. Altman showed genius as a filmmaker. The movie avoided real controversy because it was just so darn good.
""M*A*S*H"" spurred a television show that ran for years. In the 1970s it played for its time and audience. Re-runs, however, strain its credibility beyond Altman's original themes. Two doctors played the ""bad guy."" The first was a complete buffoon. Frank Burns was prominently identified as a Republican. He is given zero good qualities. He is ugly, a bad doctor, a coward, a racist and all-around mean SOB who cheats on his wife with Major Margaret Hoolihan, who at least is given some character. She is half-Vixen, half-Fascist, naturally Republican, a patriotic American in the ""worst way,"" who worships the idols of war. Over the years the writers gave Margaret a little development. Very little. Burns was replaced by Major Charles Emerson Winchester, a Boston Brahmin, naturally a Republican whose father ""knows Truman. He doesn't like him, but he knows him."" Winchester, like Hoolihan, is allowed a touch of humanity when the liberal writers felt charitable, but generally was available for all possible bashing. Two hero-doctors anchor the show by showing their intelligence, medical skills and tolerance as direct contrasts to the war effort. The CIA is lampooned, and a military effort that in reality featured MacArthur's Inchon campaign, perhaps the most brilliant invasion in history, is also played as foolish. In the end, the TV show and the film avoid being really and actually unpatriotic because they do feature an emphasis on the basic goodness of the American spirit under stress, but you will not catch me tuned in to those old re-runs(...)",1233878400,,2792,5.125

It's still the MASH that you have grown to love but with the changes it takes a little bit for BJ and Hawkeye to get in there grove so the first bit does not feel right as the two are trying to find there grove.

1865800,4,B00008WJE5,"MASH is one of my top 10 favorite TV Shows of all time and it is a joy to see the antics of these Mobile Army Surgical Hospital doctors.  Season 4 and 5 are the transitional shows because they are getting better quality shows and better story line.  At times though, the producers revert back to the format of Seasons 1-3.  With these faults, the show remains a classic for all generation and the dialogue is rather simple to understand.  Season 4 starts to set the tone for transitional part of the show to millions of viewers with the arrival of Col Sherman Potter and Capt. B.J. Honeycutt.  Frank burns is still part of the show to add the corniness of the show, but it is very limited.

If I rated Films or TV Series based on whether I liked them, I would have rated the entire series a 5 or a 6, but I rarely do this.  Each episode is high quality and the sound is great.  They bring back the joy I originally had when I first saw them minus the commercials (which are really not that important.)  One problem exists the DVD itself dose not have a lot of features.  You can now ""play all"", but there are no filmographies or even a list of the extra and cameos that made M*A*S*H one of the best shows.  It would have been more interesting to see where all those extras went off to do.

I highly recommend the series with these limitations.

1865803,3,B00008WJE5,"After three classic seasons, the anarchic spirit of ""M*A*S*H"" came to an abrupt halt with the 1975 departures of McLean Stevenson and Wayne Rogers. Instead of pulling the plug, producers Gene Reynolds and Larry Gelbart broke away from the original ""M*A*S*H"" concept by gradually turning Season Four into a situation drama with humorous touches. The change in tone created some problems. Gary Burghoff's Radar became an inconsistent childlike figure while Larry Linville's cartoonish Frank Burns wore out his welcome. Though Mike Farrell proved an affable partner in surgery, the strong rapport between Alan Alda's Hawkeye and Rogers' Trapper John was sorely missed. However, veteran actor Harry Morgan had the role of a lifetime as Col. Sherman T. Potter - an inspired replacement for Stevenson's Henry Blake. Regardless of its uneven quality, Season Four offered some memorable episodes: ""Welcome to Korea,"" ""Change of Command,"" ""Dear Mildred,"" ""Quo Vadis, Captain Chandler?"" and writer-director Gelbart's groundbreaking swan song, ""The Interview."" Gelbart left ""M*A*S*H"" on a high note, but the series did not follow suit. The 4077th should have folded its tents at the end of Season Eight.",1192924800,4,1192,5.483695652173913

1865808,2,B00008WJE5,"I'll admit, season 4 has it's moments. But this is where MASH totally changed from it's original formula of being a screwball comedy (based on the movie's premise) to a ""dramedy."" It still had the Frank Burns/Margaret connection that was still worth loads of laughs. Even Harry Morgan showed signs of promise that his character would be similar to that of his ""Support Your Local Sheriff"" days- brilliant comedic timing. But as the season progressed, MASH itself regressed. Radar, who started off as one of the gang of connivers along with Hawkeye and the gang, began his devolvement into a complete wussy. Why the writers though that made for a good character I'll never know. Klinger, who was great as a background character, along with Father Mulcahy were given way too much camera time with little substance, much less talent, to be a credible character. And the storylines were not nearly as funny as the first 3 seasons. But to season 4's credit, it was funnier than all those that followed once Mike Farrell and David Ogden Stiers' B.J. and Charles characters had shows evolving around them and their uninspired roles. With each season to follow, MASH became less a TV comedy, to an over the top program that was more like a play. There was no longer the character Hawkeye, but Alan Alda playing the character Hawkeye in the play, ""MASH."" The writers and the actors took too much license with their material and became an insult to those who relished their original characters. By the time the final episode came around, it was time for the show to be euthanized, perhaps 7 seasons too late. I dare anyone to compare any episode from the 4th season on to one of the first 3 for comedy and clever writing. MASH simply stunk by the end of the 4th season. But as has always been the case, TV has patted more terrible programs on the back in the blindness of immediacy, handing out awards that when one looks at the recipients now they scratch their head in amazement. When in syndication I can't wait for the first 3 seasons, but they fly by fast.

1865811,5,B00008WJE5,"This was obviously a new beginning for the series as Harry Morgan came in to replace McClean Stevenson and Mike Farrell replaced Wayne Rogers. Stevenson's ""Henry Blake"" was from the ""McHale's Navy"" school of military officers, but moments of wisdom and lucidity gave him depth. Morgan's ""Sherman Potter"" was the exact opposite...played relatively straight with regularly displayed moments of mischief. Farrell's ""B.J. Hunnicutt"" was essentially a more intellectual, less oafish version of ""Trapper John,"" but he was basically brought in to be a partner-in-crime for Hawkeye. That said, the episodes ""Welcome To Korea,"" ""Change of Command,"" and ""The Interview"" are well-known highlights of the series, but ""The Bus"" (following the writers' occasional inclination to script the characters outside of the 4077th) and ""Dear Mildred"" (great ending that I won't spoil here) add up to the reasons why viewers kept coming back to this series week after week. Watching the characters evolve, especially Morgan and Farrell finding a place to fit into a well-established series, are what makes Season 4 ""essential.""",1174262400,2,1104,5.5
1865812,5,B00008WJE5,"Part 1: When the third season ended in the spring of 1975 Lieutenant Colonial Henry Blake was discharge and on his way home. Radar comes into the operating room to tell the personal the following announcement. In the traumatic and shocking last scene, a devastated Radar goes into the operating room to tell personal the following announcement Lieutenant Colonel Henry Blake who had boarded his plane and was on his way home, his transport plane was shot down over the Sea of Japan it spun into the ocean and their were no survivals. So now we jump ahead to the 4th season in September where the show opens as followed. Maj. Frank Burns has taken full charge and s giving 4077th hell with his usual military regimen as the new CO replacing Lieutenant. Col. Henry Blake after he lost his life en route home. Capt. Hawkeye Pierce arrives back from 3 days R&R in Tokyo riding in a local mans by rickshaw doesn't check in with his commanding officer and heads straight to the shower.  Radar follows him in to break to try to tell him the bad news that Captain Trapper John MacIntyre had received his orders to ship home. Radar tells Hawkeye that they tried to get him for two days and that Trapper got so drunk that he ran naked through the mess tent. Hawkeye wants to go to Seoul to bid his buddy farewell, but Frank refuses. When Radar gets in a jeep to go to Kimpo to collect a replacement doctor, Hawkeye insists on going along to try and catch Trapper before he goes Stateside, even going so far as to run a blockade. Meanwhile at the 4077th Frank and Hot Lips fawn as they look over the new man's record and envisions shaping him into their image. Once at Kimpo, Radar goes off to find the new doctor, while Hawkeye tries to find his friend before he left for home, only to learn he is 10 minutes too late. When Hawkeye meets the new doctor, a Captain BJ Hunnicutt, he was very abrupt with greeting him, still angry that he had missed Trapper. With the introductions over they headed for the jeep only to find that it had been stolen! So when Part 1 ended last week the trio was stuck in Kimpo with no wheels so now the finish to Welcome to Korea Part 2.  So with no transport to get them back to the 4077th Hawkeye decides it's time to visit the officers club, with just one setback: Radar wasn't an officer, being a mere corporal. So Hawkeye borrows some of BJ's captain's bars and gives him a field promotion to Corporal-Captain! When they emerge, they find a jeep belonging to Major-General Cornell Dickering was waiting; it didn't matter that it wasn't theirs, to Hawkeye a jeep was a jeep, so they commandeer it to get back to the 4077th. On the way back, they encounter a farming family using their daughters to check for land mines to protect their cows. A land mine explodes, injuring one daughter, and Radar braves the field to pick her up and bring her to their jeep. Having taken her to the hospital, they continue on their way to the 4077th and blow a tire. A group of locals walks by, and then suddenly disappears. Hawk, BJ and Radar barely change the tire and evacuate as a barrage of gunfire erupts. Presumably out of danger, they meet up with a group of G.I's, only to have shells rain immediately down upon them, and B.J. gets his first taste of war when they have to treat the wounded soldiers. As BJ tries to help the injured men, the physical gruesomeness of one dead soldier makes him physically sick. After a detour to Rosie's bar, they become so rip roaring drunk that only Radar is able to drive them back to the 4077th. Back at camp, B.J falls out of the jeep, landing at Frank's feet with a drunken ""What say ya, Ferret Face?"" indicating that he, like Hawk and his predecessor, Trapper John, won't fulfill Maj. Burns and Houlihan's wishes. Furthermore, Frank gets picked up by the M.P.s for stealing the General's jeep when he shows lousy timing in using it.

1865814,5,B00008WJE5,Trapper and Blake depart and BJ and Colonel Potter enter but the laughs still continue.  But the characters do evolve.  BJ with all his practical jokes is still a kinder gentler soul that Trapper ever was. So the humor is a little gentler but still side splitting. Sherman Potter is more of a commander than Blake was.  But he appreciates the talented and good humored Pierce over the excessive military stooge Frank Burns.  Nonetheless there are plenty of good laughs especially as Corporal Klinger strives to get that Section 8.  Radar is as efficient as ever and wins over Potter with his loyalty as well as a prized horse.

1865817,5,B00008WJE5,"The success of the 1970 film ""MASH"", which was directed by Robert Altman, inspired the production of one of the most successful and longest running TV series of all time: ""M*A*S*H"".  While most of the main characters from the original film were portrayed in the TV series, only one of the film's actors reprised his role for the TV series: Gary Burghoff.  Like the film, the show was about the men and women working in a fictitious U.S. Army ""Mobile Army Surgical Hospital"" (or MASH unit) known as the 4077th during the Korean War in the early 1950's.

At the beginning of the show's fourth season, two loved characters were no longer present: Lt. Col. Henry Blake (McLean Stevenson, 1929-1996) and Capt. ""Trapper John"" McIntyre (Wayne Rogers), both of whom received orders to return home to the states; but Henry's plane was shot down and he was killed in the final third-season episode making it one of the most emotional and personal episodes of the entire series.  The characters from the first three seasons who remained with the show into its fourth season included Major Frank Burns (Larry Linville, 1939-2000), Maj. Margaret ""Hot Lips"" Houlihan (Loretta Swit), Capt. Benjamin Franklin ""Hawkeye"" Pierce (Alan Alda), Father Francis Mulcahy (William Christopher), Cpl. Walter ""Radar"" O'Reilly (Gary Burghoff) and Cpl. Maxwell Klinger (Jamie Farr).  Two new regular characters were then introduced at the beginning of the fourth season to replace Henry and Trapper: Col. Sherman T. Potter (Harry Morgan) and Capt. B.J. Hunnicut (Mike Farrell), both of which remained with the show for its remaining 8 seasons.

As in the original 1970 film and the first three seasons of the TV series, ""M*A*S*H"" continued to demonstrate a lack of respect for the U.S. military by portraying many of its officers as being inept and incompetent.  This was the formula used for Maj. Burns and the departed Lt. Col. Henry Blake, but whereas Lt. Col. Blake had a very likeable personality, Maj. Burns wanted to see a more disciplined command and was often quite a stool pigeon.  Also, while being married and regarding himself as being a devout Christian, Maj. Burns maintained a romantic affair with Maj. Houlihan.  (In the film, it was while Majors Burns & Houlihan were passionately kissing with the entire MASH unit listening to them that Maj. Houlihan earned the nickname ""Hot Lips"".)  Captains Hawkeye Pierce and the departed Trapper John McIntyre were typically disrespectful of the Army, but were completely honest about themselves, which is probably the main reason why they despised the hypocritical Maj. Burns so much.  B.J., who replaced Trapper, quickly became Hawkeye's new friend and shared many (but not all) of Hawkeye's views.  As in the film, Maj. Houlihan was particularly attractive, but many weren't particularly friendly towards her because, like Maj. Burns, she wanted to see greater military discipline.  This often set Majors Burns & Houlihan at odds with Hawkeye and B.J.  Though Col. Potter was more regular Army and quite different from Henry Blake, he too was not particularly fond of Maj. Burns and developed close bonds with Hawkeye and B.J., and later with Margaret.  A special bond also developed quickly between Col. Potter and the 4077th's lowly company clerk, Radar.  As always, it was essentially up to Radar to help keep things running smoothly; but the MASH 4077th continued to have the best survival rate for any wounded soldiers treated there.  Hawkeye was an especially gifted surgeon, as were B.J. and Col. Potter; while Maj. Burns had probably barely made it through medical school.  Father Mulcahy was as polite and helpful as ever while Cpl. Klinger continued to wear women's clothes in an attempt to get a ""Section 8"", which would give him a discharge from the Army.

The fourth season of ""M*A*S*H"" that aired between 1975 and 1976 had the following 24 episodes:

1. ""Welcome to Korea"". With Frank in charge of the 4077th, Hawkeye returns after being in Tokyo for 3 days only to find that Trapper has been sent home.  Desperate to say goodbye to him, Hawkeye takes Radar with him to the airfield; but misses Trapper by 5 minutes; but they find B.J. and stop to have a drink and arrive back at the 4077th drunk with B.J. calling Frank ""ferret face"".

2. ""Change of Command"". Frank's command of the 4077th is very short-lived with the arrival of Col. Potter.  Frank then disappears for a few days.

3. ""It Happened One Night"". On a very cold night, the 4077th comes under attack from friendly artillery. Frank rips Margaret's tent apart looking for love letters that he had sent to her.

4. ""The Late Captain Pierce"". When Hawkeye's father is told that Hawkeye is dead, Hawkeye wants to return home.

5. ""Hey, Doc"".  A tank is sent to the 4077th to scare off snipers.

6. ""The Bus"".  When the bus that Radar, B.J., Col. Potter, Hawkeye & Frank are riding in while returning to the 4077th from a conference breaks down, they come across a North Korean soldier.

7. ""Dear Mildred"". While Col. Potter writes to his wife Mildred for their anniversary, Frank & Margaret have a wood carving made for him, but Radar brings him a horse.

8. ""The Kids"". The 4077th takes in orphans that were bombed out of their orphanage.

9. ""Quo Vadis, Captain Chandler"".  When a wounded soldier (Alan Fudge) claims to be Jesus Christ, Col. Flagg (Edward Winter, 1937-2001) and Dr. Sydney Freedman (Allan Arbus) have different opinions about him.

10. ""Dear Peggy "". B.J. writes home to his wife Peg about Klinger's latest attempt to escape the Army, as well as one of Frank's goofs and a visiting hard-nosed chaplain (Ned Beatty).

11. ""Of Moose and Men"". While B.J. helps Sgt. Zale (Johnny Haymer, 1920-1989) with a ""Dear John"" letter, Frank looks for Korean saboteurs and Hawkeye battles with visiting Colonel Spiker (Tim O'Connor).

12. ""Soldier of the Month"". When Frank becomes very ill, he writes a will in which he leaves his belongings to his wife; except for his clothes, which he leaves to Margaret.

13. ""The Gun"". When a wounded colonel is treated at the 4077th & his valuable gun disappears, Hawkeye & B.J. suspect Frank took it.

14. ""Mail Call, Again"". When Frank gets a letter from his wife that she wants to divorce him, a phone call that he makes to her upsets Margaret.

15. ""The Price of Tomato Juice"". Radar enlists the help of Hawkeye & B.J. to get Col. Potter some tomato juice, but he's allergic to it.

16. ""Dear Ma"".  Radar writes home about Hawkeye's camp foot inspection and Col. Potter getting hit with some shrapnel.

17. ""Der Tag"".  Col. Potter encourages everyone to be nicer to Frank.

18. ""Hawkeye"".  Hawkeye is injured in a jeep accident and finds refuge with a Korean family that doesn't speak English.

19. ""Some 38th Parallels"". Frank tries to sell the camp's garbage to local Koreans.

20. ""The Novocaine Mutiny"". After Frank puts Hawkeye on charges while Col. Potter is away, Hawkeye is brought before a court martial where several different versions of what happened are described.

21. ""Smilin' Jack"". A wounded chopper pilot (Robert Hogan) is determined to break another pilot's record for the number of wounded brought from the front lines.

22. ""The More I See You"". The camp is visited by a nurse who had a previous relationship with Hawkeye.

23. ""Deluge"". The 4077th must contend with a deluge of wounded, a fire and a rainstorm.

24. ""The Interview"". A visiting reporter, Clete Roberts as himself (1912-1984), visits the 4077th and interviews Hawkeye, B.J., Col. Potter, Radar, Frank, Father Mulcahy and Klinger.

Overall, I rate the fourth season of ""M*A*S*H"" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it.  In its eleven years of production, ""M*A*S*H"" was one of the best TV shows of its day and remains one of the best TV shows of all time.",1130025600,23,7812,4.869894099848714
1865818,4,B00008WJE5,"This season had some pivotal changes. The introduction of two new characters: Colonel Potter taking the place of Henry Blake oand BJ Hunnicut taking the place of ""Trapper"" McIntyre. These characters are far less funny and imaginative that the originals. BJ is just not as exciting. He is kind of boring, and follows behind Hawkeye all the time, pining over his wife.

Potter's change may be for the better. He seems to restore some kind of Sanity to the unit. Henry was funny, but comepletely incompetent as a unit leader. Frank was far worse.

With all that said, this was still a funny season. I think the funniest episode was ""The Novacaine Mutiny""  where Hawkeye must stand trial for being accused by Frank of mutiny when he takes over for Potter for a while. Antoher famous one was ""The Late Captain Pierce"" when somehow Hawkeye's paperwork gets mixed up and he is thought to be dead. A sentimental one is ""The More I See You"" where Hawkeye's true love who broke his heart is stationed at the 4077. ""The Bus"" was funny, showing that fixing broken body is a lot different from fixing a broken down bus. ""Welcome to Korea"" which showed BJ's initiation into the war was both very serious and funny.""Soldier of the Month"" is hilarious, where Frank gets knocked out by Hot Lips for leaving her only his clothes in his will. ""Mail Call Again"" showed him trying desparately to hold on to his wife by denying his involvement with Hot Lips. This season featured a lot of letters to home. Potter writes to his wife, BJ to his wife and Radar to his mother, all very funny episodes.

All in all, I think that season one, season 4 and season 6 are the most pivotal seasons of MASH. The former being that it is the first season and the latter because these are the seasons where new characters are introduced and many changes take place. Season 8 is also one that stands out.",1128211200,,1866,4.528189910979228
1865819,5,B00008WJE5,"Season 4 of MASH marked two distinctive cast changes - Harry Morgan's Colonel Potter replaced MacLean Stevenson's Henry Blake, and Mike Ferrell's BJ Hunnicut replaced Wayne Rogers' Trapper John. It's notable that while most shows usually fall apart after one significant cast change, MASH suffered two in one season - and still went on for another seven years.

There's a wealth of strong material this season, and Morgan and Ferrell fit right in. It's nice to finally have an authority figure that can put Frank in his place, and BJ's more of an equal to Hawkeye than Trapper was. Plus, BJ provides a fresh audience viewpoint as he hasn't been in Korea as long as the others have. The change in cast is also accompanied by a slight change in tone, which is natural - MASH as a series matured every season, and season 4 is the natural extension of the more serious moments of season 3.

Not that there aren't any funny moments, because there's still several: the introductions of the new characters, Frank Burns in a runaway tank, and an entire episode in the wilderness with a broken bus. The ""letters home"" plot device is used thrice this season, with Potter, BJ, and Radar all reporting on the daily happenings around camp. Two other notable episodes include ""Deluge,"" which is set to old news footage from the 1950's, and ""The Interview,"" a black-and-white episode where the doctors are interviewed in documentary fashion. The only episode that really misses is ""Hawkeye"", where Hawkeye has to continually talk to himself to keep from losing consciousness. MASH works best as an ensemble piece, and listening to 25min of stand-up comedy from Alan Alda doesn't work so well.

A quality season that keeps MASH in its prime, even with cast changes. Highly recommended.",1116979200,5,1769,4.870431893687708
1865820,5,B00008WJE5,"Based on a Richard Hooker novel of the same name, MASH was released in 1970 as a full-length feature film by 20th Century Fox before experiencing widespread success as a groundbreaking television sitcom in the Fall of 1972. The show's brilliant integration of drama and comedy made it one of the most celebrated shows in TV history, culminating in an eleven year prime time series stint. The 1983 series finale of MASH made history as the program with the single largest audience in television history, beating out several SuperBowls and the fabled ""Who Shot J.R."" episode of Dallas. With the proliferation of new television mediums, it's a record likely to never be broken...

The sitcom is set in South Korea during American involvement in the Korea War (with M*A*S*H standing for ""Mobile Army Surgical Hospital""). Buffered from the front lines by a mountain range and a minefield, the men and women of MASH were tasked with patching up wounded American soldiers. Unique to its genre, the cast of MASH was unusually large. Surgeons Dr. Benjamin Pierce (Alan Alda) and Dr. ""Trapper"" John McIntyre (Wayne Rogers) play the roles of excellent doctors who enjoy women and booze, while Dr. Frank Burns (Larry Linville) and Nurse Practitioner Margaret ""Hot Lips"" Houlihan (Loretta Swit) play foil to the two men's shenanigans (due to a contract dispute, Rogers' character was later replaced by Dr. B.J. Hunnicutt - played by Mike Farrell). The character of Frank Burns was also later replaced by Dr. Charles Emerson Winchester (David Ogden Stiers)...

Corporal Max Klinger (Jamie Farr) provides comic relief with his early attempts to procure a discharge by dressing in women's clothing, and Father Francis Mulcahy (William Christopher) adds flavor to a diverse cast of characters. Also rounding out the cast are Lt. Col. Henry Blake (McLean Stevenson), Corporal Walter ""Radar"" O'Reilly (Gary Burghoff), and Col. Sherman Potter (Harry Morgan)...

The MASH (Season 4) DVD offers a number of hilarious episodes including the series premiere ""Welcome to Korea"" in which Trapper John McIntyre receives orders to ship home and is replaced by Dr. B.J. Hunnicutt (Mike Farrell). Meanwhile, Pierce butts heads with temporary commanding officer Frank Burns as he attempts to say goodbye to Trapper John before he leaves (Pierce was on leave when the orders came in)... Other notable episodes from Season 4 include ""The Late Captain Pierce"" in which Pierce's father is mistakenly notified of his son's death, and ""The Gun"" in which a wounded colonel's collectable gun turns up missing (prompting Pierce and B.J. to hunt down the culprit)...

A highlight episode is called ""Jesus Christ"" if anything this

is the reason to buy the Set. I had never seen the episode before and lays down the reasons that I would like to buy the complete series as they are released.

It is amazing that these are available, there is amazing acting and character portrayls that go beyond the ""norm"" this may be responsible for Mash's success.

1865823,1,B00008WJE5,"If you are, then you should know that M*A*S*H - Season 4 is exactly where the shark was jumped for this series.

In Season 4, M*A*S*H goes from being an often riotously funny comedy to a preachy, politically correct (in a time when political correctness did not yet exist), and virtually humourless sit-com.

I remember reading a critic (I cannot remember his name at the moment) who referred to the series (after the departure of McClean Stevenson and Wayne Rogers) as becoming, ""Alan Alda's weekly morality play.""  I could not have said it better and I could not agree more!

If that's your cup of tea, fine.  For me, I purchased Seasons 1-3 as soon as they became available.  I also have the motion picture DVD and the novel by Richard Hooker.  I love them all!

However, I have no intention of purchasing the remaining seasons.  I get enough political correctness in my every day life in 21st century America.",1097798400,16,913,4.65625
1865824,5,B00008WJE5,"Other than M*A*S*H, there's only one other show I can watch repeatedly, and still laugh outloud I (Frasier).

For the episodes themselves, M*A*S*H has never been better, more convenient, and funnier (thanks to long edited scenes rarely seen in syndicated TV)! It's almost like seeing it for the first time.  I was surprised to notice that many episodes had close to five (5) minutes edited out in Syndication.

One allure of DVD's, in addition to the Sound and Picture Quality, are the ""Extras"". Other than the ability to take out the laugh tracks (Yes!), this has none. There are no cast interviews, no bloopers, no Director's/Producers/Writers Commentary, not even Cast Biographies. Even the insert is rather plan and has nothing extra to it. The episode description look as though they were written by some one who hadn't even watched the show. I was hoping for more when the DVD's came out. Like the book ""Complete Book of M*A*S*H"" was not complete in it's fullest sense by leaving out that which would have made it truly complete (the secondary story lines, etc.), this is not complete in the DVD's fullest sense...the extras we've all come to expect in them. In that respect I am disappointed. But I am not disappointed in having a whole season on only 3 DVD's! I am not disappointed in the quality of the sound and picture (much better than the Video's from Columbia House and the Broadcast versions).

This season introduces us to the series most significant new characters:  Harry Morgan as Col. Sherman T. Potter (regular Army -- God help us all!!), and Mike Farrel as Cpt. BJ Honnicutt.  While I enjoyed the first three seasons, personally, I like Potter much better than Blake, and BJ more so than Trapper, who had become rather boring (no fault of Wayne Rogers).  So this season I think the show simply got much better, both in comedy and in Drama, something it mixed better than any show before or since.

My only other complaint is with their painfully slow release schedule of only two seasons per year. At this rate, it's going to be the end of 2006 before the whole series is available.",1096761600,6,2104,4.729508196721311
1865825,4,B00008WJE5,"I'm one of the die-hards who liked Trapper and Henry better than B.J. and Potter. I suppose that, in my opinion, they were nearer to portraying the insanity of the movie. Potter was more like a real officer than Henry (who was more like the Colonel in the movie) and B.J. lacked the slap-stick of Trapper. Remember, MASH was a stab at the military and was never meant to be taken seriously. Still, this has to rank up there as one of the best series ever produced. Henry Morgan was great, and irreplaceable, in Dragnet; but comes in a distant second to McLean Stevenson (again, this is my opinion) in MASH. Trapper John was such a major part of the movie that it makes no sense to abandon him in the series without so much as a good-bye to Hawkeye (yet they did). Oh well, I'm not a politically-correct person so I guess this shouldn't make sense to me.",1088899200,,853,4.371069182389937

Especially when Harry Morgan shows up as Col. Potter.  The scene that broke him in was after surgery he said. ""Boy, I sure could use a belt.""  Ever since then he is always blasted.  Now he is a cool C.O.  I even like the words that he says.  Like when Radar gives him a horse for the Col's. Birthday and Col. Potter almost falls and Major Burns thats disgusting and potter say, ""Son, that's a tiptoe throught the Tulips.  Cause Col. Potter loves horses.  So you should buy MASH seasons with only Col.

1865828,5,B00008WJE5,"The problem with the Blake and McIntyre characters, especially the latter, was that they were way too similar to the overbearing Pierce character. Season 4 solves all that. The 20 plus episodes are all, with the exception of one or two, top rate. The first three set up the MASH that will be around the next 2 or 3 seasons, introducing Honeycutt and Potter. Then the series really gets going, showcasing all characters, including Klinger, Radar, Father Mulcahy, and even Sgt. Zale in one bizare setting or another. Larry Linville settles into his snibbling idiot Frank Burns role nicely, and, love or hate the character, this is Loretta Swit's best season by far. Sidney Freeman and Col. Flagg show up and go at it over a soldier who believes he's Jesus Christ.
The only time MASH bores me is when they spend an entire episode focusing primarily on one character, particularly Pierce. I didn't care too much for the episodes surrounding Hawkeye's father, or him involved in a jeep accident. Also included is the episode where Hawkeye meets up with his former fiance. What makes MASH great is the seriousness of the medical tasks followed by the complete lunacy of the rest of their lives. Too much hard drama spoils that, and season 4, with only mild exceptions, puts the show where it belongs: intelligent comedy.
If you can only get one MASH season, by all means, this is the one.",1066953600,7,1382,4.738589211618257

Forever a classic, I love owning the complete sets and will preorder each available edition. However, although I give the set five stars for presenting a crystal clear uncut set of MASH episodes. There are some points which could be improved upon. In the spirit of DVD, namely the little extras which are fathomable on this new digital format, I would like to see more material included. Candid stills from shooting the episodes, interviews with the cast, voice overs etc etc. As a diehard MASH fan, any little tidbit of material would be well recieved.

My sisters and I all got into the playful characters that graced the screen.  They were funny, each unique, and at the same time, they had a sensitivity about their work that was touchingly beautiful.
Now 22, I count down the days until the release of each DVD in the series.  I watch them over and over again, reliving the humor and repeating the occasional quote where appropriate.
I love M*A*S*H - the uniqueness of the characters, the situations that they find themselves in and how they get out of them, the delightful humor of them all (often without meaning to be)...  and I am thrilled that they have put this fabulous series on video and DVD.",1061942400,6,752,4.548148148148148
1865831,5,B00008WJE5,"I love seeing the series on DVD.  I have been watching the re-runs for years, ( I was too young to appreciate it the first time around) and it is so nice to see all the parts that were cut out.
M*A*S*H was a groundbreaking series in television as it is the only show that portrays the Korean War and also brought forth the combination of drama and comedy (much like All in the Family). I will never tire of this show as I have seen some of the episodes so many times I can recite them word for word but they still make me laugh.
I really enjoyed the first three seasons with Mclean Stevenson and Wayne Rogers but feel that Harry Morgan and Mike Farrell brought a lot to the show too. Also like how in the later seasons they have more Klinger and Father Mulcahy.
This season and season 5 are probably my all time favorites though because they have Harry Morgan and Larry Linville who I also loved in his portrayal of Frank Burns.
I guess to wrap it up I just LOVE this show and will never tire of it.",1061683200,8,999,4.123076923076923
1865832,5,B00008WJE5,"How does one go about writing a review on M*A*S*H season (pick a number from 1 to 11 and insert here). After all, who is there among us that does not already know what the M*A*S*H is or has not, at the very minimum seen it as they have clicked by it on the television?  Thirty-one years after it's inception, it lives on in syndication and in the hearts and consciousness of many Americans. In short, it is without a doubt one of the greatest television series, of any type, in the history of Television.
In light of all this, to attempt to enunciate the quality and merit of this or any other season, is entirely superfluous.  The entire series is worthy of collection and season 4 is no different.
The real value of obtaining the entire series is opportunity to view the entire life of M*A*S*H, uncut and in order!  Many episodes make more sense now that they may be viewed as a whole without the editing out of scenes that has become necessary in order to make them fit modern TV requirements, with the increased number of commercials.
So, if you love M*A*S*H the way that many of us do, I highly recommend picking up the entire series.  It is definitely worth the price of purchase.",1060732800,5,1186,4.426605504587156

I'm sure that Fox will continue to release the seasons on DVD that way.  For the record, it's irrelevant to buy these on video because there is no sans-laugh track option so why bother putting them out on tape.  NO ONE will buy them on tape.",1060041600,11,548,4.44

And You can view them whenever you want, with no advertising. Season 4 is outstanding, I will always love the first three seasons best, because love the Blake and Trapper parts, and the whimsical nature of the whole thing; But The Potter and BJ Parts are a great replacement and even better in ways for the above mentioned parts. Season four has many great episodes including the first one, WELCOME TO KOREA, which is a two part episode, that is seamlessly put together as one longer episode hear, which introduces the BJ Part in full and points to the Potter cheater. Other great episodes are Change Of Command, Quo Vadis Captain Chandler, Dear Peggy, Soldier Of The Month, The Gun, Dear Ma, Hawkeye, and the Interview.

Hawkeye takes leave in Tokyo where, while drowning his sorrows and having his own Irish funeral for Henry, he remembers the times he spent with Blake. We see images of Henry and the 4077th like in the episode ""Dreams"".
This is a no laugh episode so there aren't many jokes or pranks done.
Radar, Klinger, Mulcahy, and the enlisted men form a wake for Henry in the OR and in the Officer's Club.

1865840,5,B00008WJE5,"This is the season I've been waiting for -- the year that M*A*S*H evolved from a great comedy to an excellent social commentary.  The previous three seasons had focused mostly on practical jokes and other silly hijinks, along with the whiny relationship between Frank and Margaret.  Some fans consider those the best years of the show in terms of comedy.  But for me, the arrival of Colonel Potter marks the point when I began to really love M*A*S*H as more than ""just another sitcom.""  The humor is still there, but it has grown beyond mere verbal slapstick.
In addition, the anti-war focus has become more daring.  One of the most unconventional episodes is the last in the season, ""The Interview.""  It was done in black-and-white like a 1950s newscast, and the M*A*S*H characters tell the folks at home what war is really like for the people at the 4077th..  This episode received very positive feedback when it first aired, and set the stage for including more serious drama in the future.
Another of my favorites in Season Four is ""Dear Mildred,"" where Radar gives Colonel Potter a horse for his anniversary -- and the old ex-calvaryman almost cries, he is so touched by the gesture.  ""A horse, a beautiful horse...""  From that moment on, we know that this ""regular Army"" guy has a sentimental side, too.
Regarding the format of the DVD set, I was disappointed that the discs themselves were done in olive drab instead of the full-color portraits of the characters on the previous three seasons' discs.  With two new major characters (Potter and Honeycutt) arriving this season, it would have made more sense to feature them on the discs instead of a helmet and a champagne glass.  Was the olive drab intended to represent the change from flaky Henry Blake to ""regular Army"" Potter, or was it just a cheap-out?",1058486400,7,1815,4.766773162939297

1865842,5,B00008WJE5,"Once again, I am finding myself riveted to my TV to watch M*A*S*H.  I felt that Season Two was the best, but Season Four matches it.  Replacing McLean Stevenson and Wayne Rogers with Harry Morgan and Mike Farrell was a shot in the arm for the series.  Harry Morgan has got to be one of the best actors I have seen!  He can be funny as anything, be serious when he has to, or do the deadpan one-liner better than anyone.  I always enjoyed his work more than Stevenson's.  And Mike Farrell is a terrific character actor.  He too is funny, but can lay on the serious acting superbly.  Because of the changes in the show from Blake and Trapper to Potter and BJ, it helped executive producer Larry Gelbart do his best writing.  The last episode in the set, ""The Interview,"" is one of the best, if not the best, episodes of M*A*S*H.  That happened to be Gelbart's last show.  Then Burt Metcalfe took over as executive producer, and the tone of the show changed.
This DVD collection is a must-have for any fan of M*A*S*H!  (I believe there is an Amazon special where you can get Seasons Two and Four as a package - the two best seasons of the show, in my opinion.)",1058313600,15,1157,4.305555555555555
1865843,5,B00008WJE5,"I'm so glad that Fox has been good enough to release this great series on DVD, and that they have done such an excellent job. The picture quality on these DVDs far outshines the syndicated reruns on TV, and the full 25-minute-plus cuts of the shows haven't been seen in ages. As with the other box sets, the menus and functionality of the disc are very nice. I would however like to see a ""play all"" button so you don't have to click through as  many menus to see all the shows.
As far as the actual content of the shows goes, I enjoy this period in the series more than the earlier seasons. Contrary to what some other fans  think, the addition of Mike Farrell and Harry Morgan improved the show and made it a little more real and less lighthearted. Eventually these new characters really grow on you and become like old friends. The cast changes definitely move the show in a more comedy-drama direction, which I feel is part of what made this show so great, and so different from other sitcoms. A couple of great unconventional episodes are included in this season set, including ""Hawkeye""  which is essentially a 25-minute monologue by Alan Alda, and ""The Interview"" which is an all black-and-white documentary-style episode that again breaks the rules of what a sitcom is ""supposed"" to be like. Great writing, strong characters, top-notch acting talent. What more could we ask of this show?
I can't wait to buy season 5 in December. Now I hope Fox will lavish this same high-quality treatment on more great classic sitcoms like ""The Bob Newhart Show"" and ""The Odd Couple"", the rights to which I believe they also own.",1058313600,27,1622,4.6055363321799305

It wasn't just about carousing and getting drunk but found other outlets for jokes and pranks. Henry Morgan brought such a refreshing change of leadership in the role of regular army man, Col. Potter. His homey wisdom and unique turn of phrase was hilarious! It also seemed that the pairing of pranksters Hawkeye and B.J. was a better fit than Hawkeye and Trapper.

With season 4 I feel the show was getting ready to hit it's real stride. For one thing, you can't compare the first 3 season to the last 7 because the first 3 seasons were more on the wacky side like the movie. The next seven just went on to define and explore the characters more. It also let us know that war had all kinds of people in it. The change of characters allowed for a change of format. If all stayed the same there would have been no way that it would have lasted 10 years. The changes allowed for fresh and more realistic story lines. All it did was give the writers an opportunity to do what the show was meant to do, and that was to show what war was like and to have a lot of fun doing it. It stayed very funny throughout but then invented the first true dramedy. Can't wait to see the next DVD.",1057881600,4,924,4.054644808743169
1865848,5,B00008WJE5,"The preceding reviews all focus on the departure of Stevenson and Rogers as if that was the beginning of the end.  Yet these reviewers miss the fact that the broad satire and humor in the first three seasons was directly attributable to Larry Gelbart (and to some extent Gene Reynolds), the producer(s) and sometimes writer(s) of the show.  These folks were still firmly in place for season four, and to my way of viewing season four ranks as one of my favorites.  There still are some crazy moments (like Frank taking a jeep for a ride, the whole ""let's be friends with Frank"" episode, among others), along with some more serious moments.  Of course, those serious moments can be found in the preceding three seasons as well.  Gelbart left after this season, and Reynolds after season five.  To me, it was when Burt Metcale took over in season six that the REAL change took over, but even then season six was pretty funny.  Many MASH fans draw the line at whether BJ has a moustache (season seven on) or not -- episodes with the moustache typically are your late-period episode that can get sentimental and sappy.
Anyway, I will be getting this package next week on its release date and eagerly watching all of the episodes.  While I wish that a few extras could appear, for the price and the value you can't complain.  Don't let two new characters change your mind -- the show was still well-written and at the top of its game.",1057795200,6,1429,4.572549019607843

Less slapstick humor and more subtlety, the remaining seasons of M.A.S.H. are the best, with the possible exception of the very last. The annoying laugh track is used much less, and the characters are more flushed out. David Ogden Stiers as Major Winchester is a fantastic replacement for the one-dimensional Frank Burns character played by Larry Linville, and Harry Morgan gives substance to the role of Colonel Potter as commander of the camp.

1865850,5,B00008WJE5,"Season Four of M*A*S*H will always be remembered as the big transitional season, with two major character changes as well as the slow push from ""Comedy with stabs of drama"", to ""Drama with stabs of comedy"".
Obviously not everyone enjoyed the changes.  Some fell in love with the early seasons of M*A*S*H for their comical hyjinx and laugh out loud lunacy.  But the actors and filmmakers were constantly testing the boundaries, going for a much more dramatic and/or realistic interpretation of what life at a M*A*S*H station was really like with early episodes such as ""Sometimes You Hear The Bullet"", ""Dr. Pierce And Mr. Hyde"", ""O.R."", and of course the very memorable ""Abyssinia, Henry"".  They realized the positive impact these episodes were having on their audience and would continue to push the envelope with each future season.
Season Four gives way to many more serious storylines shown than any previous season.  The opening double episode: ""Welcome To Korea"" welcomes us to Captain BJ Hunnicutt as Hawkeye tries in vein to reach Trapper before he is shipped stateside.  I must admit, I wished there had been a bigger sendoff for Wayne Rogers as Trapper John McIntyre, but he refused to return for even one more episode to say goodbye properly, apparently due to feeling betrayed by the staff who seemed to turn everything into the Hawkeye Pierce show.
""O.R."" was the very first (and only) episode without a laughtrack from Season Three.  Season Four would have many more episodes without laughtracks, including ""The Bus""(and enjoyable roadtrip outting), ""Quo Vadis, Captain Chandler?"" (the famous episode of a bomber pilot who thinks he's Jesus Christ), and ""The Interview"".
""The Interview"", which was shot in black & white to give it a documentary style, is about a news journalist who goes to the 4077 because of its 97% lifesaving success record and interviews the main characters (except for Margaret Houlihan).  Some of the responses were scripted, while others were completely improvisational by the actors who even get to swear obscenities for the first time (but have them bleeped out).  It's a very haunting and realistic episode with William Christopher giving one of the best speeches in M*A*S*H history.  Arguably one of the Top 10 shows of the entire series.

Season Four marked the end of M*A*S*H for some...for others, a new beginning.  For those of you who fell in love with the later seasons like I did, I'll see you at the Swamp for a nice dry martini (and future seasons of M*A*S*H on DVD).
M*A*S*H Season Four - It only gets better!
""When the doctors...cut into a patient...and it's cold, you know...the way it is now, today...steam rises from the body...and the doctor will - will warm himself over the open wound.  Could anyone look on that and not feel changed?""

1865851,5,B00008WJE5,"I must say that this is a great season of M*A*S*H. FX takes a long time to get to each episode and cuts out for time. Harry Morgan and Mike Farrel come into this season and both rank in my top 5 characters. Season 3 is great and has put me into excitement for season 4. ""Trapper"" John (Wayne Rogers) and Col. Henry Blake (McLean Stevenson) made the show seem more like a fakey cheesier comedy but Hunnicut and Potter make it seem more realistic. This season is worth double the retail price. The only thing I regret is that BJ does not have that funny looking Mustache!",1057363200,,569,4.277777777777778

The series is wrongly very favorable to the North Korean communist side of the war,. Actually, it was shown (in old Soviet documents presented by Pres. Boris Yeltsin in 1994) that North Korea pestered the Soviet Union for the right to invade South Korea in 1950 thus beginning the whole terrible Korean War! Read ""Forgotten War Remembered, Korea"" by Bill Shinn (book here at amazon) for more on Yeltsin and the very important documents.",1511654400,,546,4.945652173913044
