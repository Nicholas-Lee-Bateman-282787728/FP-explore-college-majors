This is not  a well known movie, but it is very humorous. Dennis Farina is funny in his role as a bumbling small time criminal who can't seem to pull off any big money crimes.",1245715200,,356,7.27906976744186
7792949,5,0800109562,"if you thought the'in laws"" with alan arkin and peter falk was your  brand of humor,if ""king of comedy"" with di niro did it for  you,than ""serious money"" is perfect..a dark comedy with  incredible karma between the actors...highly recommend",965692800,3,240,5.102564102564102
