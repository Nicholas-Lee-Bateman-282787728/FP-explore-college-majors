8504434,5,1609000277,"Kids 5 and up can really benefit from this DVD. It improves motor skills, concentration and creativity while developing confidence because with crochet it is easy for kids to create a project. The animated characters are fun and take the kids through a number of lessons. At the end of a couple o hours they will be making a scarf. This DVD is something kids will come back to over and over again. It contains hours and hours of fun stuff for kids, just add yarn and a crochet hook. Kids learn at their own pace and level and there are three different teachers -- the animated characters Al and Becky Paca, a 9 year old boy named Ryan Anderson (he's a real whiz) and knitting pro Marcy Levitas Hamilton. The production values are very high no other crochet DVD offers such high quality instruction and entertainment. it's good for adults too. Also look at the Art of Knitting 4 kids. The 2 DVDs are a perfect Christmas gift -- to keep kids busy during cold winter months, making scarfs and hats for the family.",1259020800,,1010,4.464864864864865
