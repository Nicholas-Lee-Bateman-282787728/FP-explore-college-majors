Shelby is a beagle that has lived in a dog pound for as long as he can remember.  He has a habit of escaping at every opportunity, and Doug the dog catcher (played by Tom Arnold) catches him every time.  Just when Shelby was about to be generously adopted by a rich mother and her spoiled son, Shelby manages to escape once again.

Instead of running home free, Shelby gets hit by a truck and is taken in by the man who hit him since the vets office was closed for Christmas.  The wife cant stand dogs, but she doesnt get to meet Shelby as he slips out of the truck and into their basement as soon and the husband pulls into their driveway.  Their son, Jake finds Shelby and takes a liking to him and names him after his favorite magician, P. T. Shelby.  Jake bonds to Shelby right away since he doesnt have any human friends.

Between Shelby and Jakes uncles dog who is also uninvited, things get pretty hairy around Christmas dinner. Doug the dog-catcher comes by looking for Shelby and sneaks a peek of Jakes mom changing her shirt after wine got spilled on it.  Besides the relatively tame peep show, there is plenty of potty humor involving laxatives and breaking the law to take stuff that is not legally yours.  In the end there is one good lesson taught, and that is to never beat an animal under any circumstance.  There are some warm and fuzzy moments at the end about Christmas being all about family and togetherness.  Thats all fine and good but I still prefer Jesus to be front and center during our Christmas celebration.

In the end, Shelby was an okay movie.  My kids seemed to enjoy it and the flatulence humor within.  Its ninety-two minutes long and goes for $20 on Amazon.  I would recommend renting it first.",1446422400,7,1781,4.400611620795107

7414080,1,B014KEPDR6,"I had to turn off the movie when the mother declared ""Oh my God"".  Too bad.  My kids were sad.

I wish producers would be more sensitive to those that take the 10 commandments seriously.  Namely, the commandment ""Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain"". https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thou_shalt_not_take_the_name_of_the_Lord_thy_God_in_vain",1447200000,,358,5.826923076923077

8731151,5,B014KEPDR6,"Seventy-percent of the reviewers LOVED this Christmas movie. The rest were spread, evenly, between 1; 2; 3; and 4-star ratings.
What a magical cast of FAMILIAR faces! Chevy Chase, Tom Arnold, Rob Schneider, John Paul Ruttan. Chevy Chase! Where has he
been; Maryland?
This was, practically, a Christmas present from Amazon. Com. I put it in my shopping basket with a roll of WHITE---and BLACK---
Gorilla-brand ""hundred-mile-an-hour duct-tape"". The next day ""SHELBY:..."" was more than half-off! ~ ~ ~ Merry Christmas! ~ ~ ~
A great movie---certainly better than ""SANTA'S BOOT CAMP""---for the family. Gee! Cannot get enough of Bill Murray or Chevy Chase.
Only way this could've been better is if also had a GROUNDHOG!",1480550400,,714,5.163793103448276
