If you are looking for a sentimental movie about the civil war, the this IS you movie. It is from the SHOTIME network and is a very racially inclined movie. It has some harsh veiws of slaves. Still I see no reason for the movie to be rated R. It has one sex scence, but for the most part it is clean. The only foul word is 'n....'",988416000,7,489,3.803921568627451

7926154,3,B00004XPQI,"Love this movie only wish it was on DVD format. The quality of the product is okay for a VHS format but could have been clearer. I guess with HD/Blu-ray now the new viewing format, VHS is not the way to go. Still enjoyed the movie since I haven't been able to find it anywhere else.",1366588800,2,282,4.053571428571429

7926156,5,B00004XPQI,"I initially watched this movie on tv when it first came out or at least around when it first came out w/o know the name of the movie. It took me LITERALLY YEARS to find this movie (which I just found a couple of minutes ago) and I'm in disbelief that it's only available on VHS through others. It NEEDS to be on DVD! It's one of the best movies I have been fortunate to see. Great story, drama, realistic relation to the characters, great cast...I mean I just can't say enough.
I want to own this movie! :( it's defintely worth your time watching.",1338076800,5,547,4.219047619047619
7926157,5,B00004XPQI,"The film ""A House Divided"" is comparable to an excellent television movie.  Half of it is a courtroom drama, and the other half is a family drama that centers on a white master, the slave he rapes, and the child that is the result. It is performed convincingly and movingly by all the actors, both principal and secondary.  I don't understand why it is not available in DVD. It is, in my opinion, a movie worth owning.  For more information on the Dickson family, read the book upon which the film is based.",1243814400,4,507,4.43010752688172
7926158,4,B00004XPQI,"Talk about living history...  I've read all the books about this family and I live in the house David built for his daughter Amanda in 1871.  I can look out my window and see the spot where David's childhood home once stood.  I even met Jennifer Beals when she came to see the house and the land.  Although not filmed here, the movie was great - although it did take a little dramatic license.  It was known Julia held a very high position of authority, very rare for a woman, much less a black slave woman.  It was also apparent David felt much love for his bi-racial daughter Amanda.  Only two people know the truth of nature of the relationship between David and Julia that brought Amanda into existence, if indeed David was the father.  (He was married for several years and never produced children.)  If you're into historical drama, especially dealing with the relationship between slave and slave owner, watch it.  If you like the movie, read Woman of Color, Daughter of Privilege by Kent Anderson Leslie for an even more intriguing tale.",1137974400,11,1045,4.630434782608695
7926159,4,B00004XPQI,"I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  I loved the candor with which the film portrays the characters and struggles they endured in the face of unflinching opposition.  Although, these events took place during very racially charged times Miss Julia, Miss Dickson and Mr. Daly quitely and courageously pursued and obtained justice.  I was pleasantly and refreshingly surprised to get to the end of the movie and find it based on a true story!",1011052800,8,435,5.013888888888889
