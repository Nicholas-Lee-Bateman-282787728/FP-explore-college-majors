2837255,5,B000QFAFOU,"A documentary that seems more like a reinactment, '51 Birch Street' presents an excellent family affair. Being able to draw from a large stash of photos, a few home movies and videos, as well as his deceased mother's daily diary, filmmaker Doug Block discovers a lot about his family--mostly his parents--that he hardly knew possible.  Ambivalence creeps into play, for his discoveries are bittersweet. Sometimes he finds out things he'd rather not know. Generosity is also present, however, for the film wouldn't be interesting if we didn't care about the participants.  Some of the discoveries have to do with social changes occurring between the fifties and sixties.  Block narrates the family story with both emotion and detachment, but mainly approaches the film like he were a reporter.  (We find out early in the film that after his mother dies, his father is quickly on the mend, marrying his long-time secretary.)  With editing that uses good judgment and family discussions that yield interest, '51 Birch Street' is a real find.",1179619200,19,1038,5.118343195266272

2837317,1,B000QFAFOU,"Thank God this was a Prime movie.  On the other hand, there's a reason this is a Prime movie, and I'm starting to think Prime is a waste of money as far as movies go.  So, here's the entire movie- Woman dies.  Son finds womans diary.  Finds out his parents had a bad marriage, and his father is an adulterer.  The end.

 Really?  These people, those who made this film, and those who thought it was the greatest thing since sliced bread, have a ""hey, look at me!"" ""what? yes I am the most interesting person on earth"" complex like most self absorbed, try to seem intellectual types.

2837322,4,B000QFAFOU,"A fascinating documentary view of a marriage.  Very well told story of the film maker's parents and their marriage.  It's a very personal story and yet it is told in a way that really draws the viewer into the lives of these not very exceptional people.  Very skillful story telling.

Although the film maker avoids discussing much of the sociology of the time in a direct way it is implied throughout.  There are some interesting insights about how much film representation of love and relationships during the mid-century influenced women's ideas and expectations.

Overall the film seems surprisingly hopeful given the subject matter.  But not unrealistically so.",1476403200,3,666,5.168224299065421
2837333,5,B000QFAFOU,"This is a superb family documentary of a traditional marriage.  Both husband and wife were trapped in a marriage that was dead and unhappy.

Mike and Doug were also able to truly connect as father and son!",1476144000,3,317,4.163934426229508

2837335,5,B000QFAFOU,"Excellent documentary about the truth behind the director's parents marriage. After his mother suddenly dies he starts reading diaries she wrote in the 60s and 70s. I actually felt incredibly sad for her. I have read stories and published diaries of other women who married in the 50s and 60s and so many of these women were frustrated. They were expected to keep a perfect home, be a perfect mother and wife but never be an individual apart from that. They married men who expected them to cook, clean, take care of the children and that was it. Even women with college degrees Sat at home watching their life go by while their husbands lived and spent time with women who had jobs and seemed more interesting. It was a sad and lonely time for married women. I wish his mother would have found fulfillment before she died. But many women of her generation did not.",1473120000,5,865,4.551282051282051

Candid conversations with both parents, a rabbi, and family members, along with excerpts from his mother's diaries, Block weaves together the story of the relationship between two valiant individuals who just happened to be his parents. The fact that Block is also a wedding videographer plays into the  question:""What makes a good marriage?""  In the end, the tables are turned, and Block's father asks his son what all parents want to know of their children. If you are a parent, you know what that question is. The film left the bittersweet realization that there are no perfect people - or marriages - but that if you have enough love, you can make almost anything work.",1464912000,,810,5.067669172932331

2837380,4,B000QFAFOU,"Sad but true. So many stories like this are surrounding us as we grow up but we never knew, never suspected. The film was put together lovingly and with some power - I began to understand how the ""image"" of rightness was so profoundly driven into our lives in the 50's that I actually understand why so many offspring became either creative or crazy.

2837382,4,B000QFAFOU,An intimate portrait that provides some food for thought on the institution of marriage and the dynamics of family life.

2837401,5,B000QFAFOU,"I thought this was absolutely fascinating.  This might be because I saw a lot of my own family in this one.  My mother was a bright woman stuck in the house with four kids in the 50's and 60's with a husband who didn't really understand her.  It made me think about what I might want to share with my own children before I die, and how much they might really want to know.  I would love to find the book mentioned ""Finding my Father.""  I can't remember the name of the author, and have not been able to locate it.  If anyone knows, please post it.",1420934400,3,547,4.065420560747664
2837402,3,B000QFAFOU,A very small story. The filmmaker delves into his family history and finds ambiguity and mixed feelings. A good slice of life if you want to learn about middle class family life in the Mad Men era. Well told but not that interesting.,1420588800,,233,4.441860465116279
2837403,1,B000QFAFOU,"When searching crime documentaries I came across this on which is definitely not a crime documentary.  It was one of the worst documentaries I've ever seen as there was nothing interesting about the family.  It's weird that the son exposes his deceased mother's diaries, but that's about it.  I am still in awe that this show got so many good reviews.  I wish I could get my 3.99 back.  I repeat this is not a crime doc, just a guy talking about how his parents marriage wasn't perfect (like 99% of the population).",1419552000,2,515,4.494623655913978
2837404,3,B000QFAFOU,It was OK. Story about a couple who probably stayed together just for the kids.  Then the wife died. And the husband found love with a woman he knew many years ago.,1419033600,,164,4.125
2837405,2,B000QFAFOU,"Enter Mike and Mina Block, the couple that regretted all 50-years of being stuck with each other, with neither having the guts to call it quits. Mina was a woman who was going through the Feminine Mystique before there was a name to it; a bored, lonely, sexually frustrated woman who constantly complains about Mike, her inattentive, detached, and mechanical husband.  Mina had needs, energy, and was by her own admission ""too much woman"" for Mike, who probably regretted never marrying his pliable secretary Kitty.

Unfortunately Mina passes away, and before his wife is declared dead Mike finds his second wind: He reconnects with Kitty!  There we see a side of Mike not even his own children saw. The man who seemed to prefer tinkering with machines instead of being an active father/husband was now loving, tender, and seemingly born again.  With a connection this magical to pass up the two get married, much to the chagrin of his three children. who are mystified by this change.

So there you have it, the story of what happens when two people marry for no good reason other than it's the thing to do.  Two people adhering to the standards of making things work, when they knew damn well it wasn't ever going to work.  To Mina and Mike, their 50-year anniversary probably seemed like a death sentence that was commuted after Mina died. Hell, without a twinkle in his eye or a hit of remorse he told his own son that he didn't miss his late wife or even love her! The best thing that resulted from the marriage  were that the kids learned how miserably married their mother was, and how relieved their father was to not have that ball and chain keeping him from finding Kitty.",1418601600,,1682,4.63973063973064
2837406,5,B000QFAFOU,Good show.,1417737600,,10,4.5
2837407,2,B000QFAFOU,"I was born in the 1950's and my parent's DID get divorced, and it was a source of great shame for me, into my adulthood. However, I was very lucky that I was only 4, and did not have to grow up in a household like 51 Birch, where the palpable tension obviously sucked the life out of the family.

I believe I only saw 2 of the sisters on film, and they both seemed too young to look and act so worn out.

I think marriage in the 50's was difficult.  I know that alcoholism skyrocketed in women, because many women worked while the men were away at war, and when they returned, men took their jobs, and they were relegated to the kitchen, and child-bearing, and not having their own money.

Without financial independence, divorce remained not an option, and taboo for almost 2 generations, and made life very hard for women and families.

It's entirely possible these two people were never a match made in heaven, or that unexpressed anger just killed their love, maybe because of adultery, or adultery was the result. Whatever, it was a mess.

What always makes my skin crawl, are men that are just way too mild mannered.  Extremely mild- mannered men who intellectualize are even scarier.  Beware of the sensitive, new-age guys, because they are often repressing a LOT of anger, and it WILL come out in ways that are deadly in relationships.

There was SO much dreary, intellectualizing, from the interviewer, and EVERYBODY interviewed, EXCEPT his mother's friend, and Kitty, I wanted to scream.

Doug's wife seemed a lot like his mother.  When asked intimate questions, there was such detachment, and such serious, introspective pondering.  Where is the joy, or even a smile?!  And at the end, Doug saying to his dad, that he was ""getting to happy?""  Uh, Doug, I don't want to burst your bubble, but you are a lot like your dad, and your mom, so just take a bite of the cookie, already!!

I really wanted to smack any, or all of the younger men!!! The Rabbi, Mike, the therapist, just to get an honest, uncensored, emotion out of one of them!  Even Doug's toast at his dad's wedding, was SO circumspect.........My GOD!  Spit it out, or just shut up!  Couldn't he have gotten drunk, and just left ONE embarrassing family moment for everyone to hang onto for dear life, where the unedited truth was splatted out, and a real, spontaneous emotion surfaced?!

I suggest NO MORE THERAPY FOR ANY OF THESE DREARY PEOPLE!!!!!!  PLEASE!!!  Although.......Primal Scream Therapy is a thought.

I WOULD line up just about everybody in this film, except the dad, who I think has figured it out as much as possible, but the rest of you.............Get on some meds!  Get off the meds you are on! (they are not working!!!)  Get on some new meds...

Psychoanalysis as the only possible answer to fully knowing ourselves, is for people with too much money, and no lives, who NEVER get better!  NEVER, NEVER, NEVER, NEVER!!  Name one!!

Their psychiatrists sit out of their view for a reason that has NOTHING to do with the process.
They really don't want the patient to catch them doodling pictures of duct taping the patient's mouth shut, or writing, $350, $350, $350 over and over and over...............Save your money and take up tap dancing!",1416268800,3,3231,4.660777385159011

2837418,5,B000QFAFOU,"I enjoy studying people. I find the lives and interpersonal dynamics of ordinary people to be fascinating.  That being said, this story isn't a thriller or all that dramatic, but it does examine the inner lives of a couple that struggled for decades trying to reconcile their roles within social, famial and marital norms of their generation.

The depth of human fragility and the realization of what was, not what someone remembers it to be, was quite dynamic.  Family lives, childhood perspectives and the story of a marriage and it's struggles were real and that is rarely discovered in film.
Watching this film brought a lot of emotions from my own youth and our family dynamic.  I enjoyed all aspects of this well done look into one families life (with all it's twists and turns).  Family reality is quite never what we really think or hope it to be.",1387324800,4,607,4.644859813084112

Worthwhile.",1386979200,,291,5.083333333333333
2837433,4,B000QFAFOU,"I liked this documentary.  As a parent of adult children and a daughter of two elderly folks, it was interesting to watch an adult child discover who his parents actually are/were.

I just wanted to note how the first scene was brilliant.  Mina (mom) coaxed into talking to the camera with her son behind it.
Here she is in all her complicated glory, not exactly a warm woman who is self aware, clearly uncomfortable in front of a camera, semi confrontational, clearly unhappy, complicated and  conflicted with maybe life itself. My first impression ""wow  what a bitch"".  It captured so much. Unwilling to cooperate with her son in creating something that is important-- creating his art.  In my humble opinion a somewhat  emotionally selfish woman, yet an honest portrayal of who she really is.  I may have been put off by her  but visually and audibly (considering the fact that the 60's and 1970's were crazy times)---it explains everything, and in the end all loose ends are neatly tied up, delivering  a quite satisfactory feeling of knowing/understanding the truth.",1377648000,,961,4.95

2837457,4,B000QFAFOU,"Doug Block is a documentarian, a wedding photographer and film maker. He began taking film of his family as a record to posterity, like most of us do.. Initially he imagined that that ""posterity"" was merely his daughter and step son, the children of his sisters, and their descendants, a record that would be specifically relevant to his family. But his intimate history blossoms into something of more universal resonance, when his mother suddenly and unexpectedly dies of pneumonia, and his father then rather quickly re-establishes contact with a secretary of his from the 1960's and marries her, and uncomfortable questions about the nature of his parents' relationship emerge. His father and his new bride decide to move from the suburban Long Island house his family has owned since the 1950's down to Florida, and as they are cleaning out the house three boxes of his mother's diaries are found, recording her life from the mid sixties through the 90's. He decides to read these diaries, and the unintimated hidden topography of his parents' relationship unfolds.

It was no fairy tale. His parents were children of the Depression and WW II, children of Jewish immigrants, and their relationship fell out on the pattern of stunted patriarchy and suburban anomie typical of that generation; the historical experience that spawned the Feminine Mystique and the therapeutic culture. Their family was typical, and so archetypical, and that of course is why it is interesting. Doug discovers his parents' relationship was far from the ideal that they had wanted, but that they committed to it anyhow. There was emotional, and perhaps physical infidelity on both sides. But both his father, whom Doug has an abbreviated relationship with, and his mother, with whom he was much closer, decided to remain in it despite the disappointments. It was what it was. It is what it is. Such is life, such is family.

Doug and his two sisters reflect on all of this on camera, and clips of conversation with his mother while she was still alive, and extended interviews with his father as they are cleaning and moving out of their family home are juxtaposed across the material that Doug uncovers in his mother's diaries. He is slightly coy, in that he doesn't give us all the details, but he discloses enough to make it feel a bit tawdry at times. This is often high test emotional exhibitionism, but in the end it seems instructive. To me the take away message is that commitment to relationships is its own very rich reward. Most contemporary women would probably walk away from such a marriage, feeling what his mother felt. She stayed though, as did his father. And it seems to me that they were rewarded for it, despite their frustrations and unfulfilled dreams. I admire them both. Stoicism and staunchness are beautiful things, and commitment to relationship is its own fecund recompense.

There is wisdom in this film, insights to be gleaned. I give it a high recommendation. See it.",1364947200,,2982,4.924453280318091

2837473,4,B000QFAFOU,"I felt deeply ambivalent right after I started watching this documentary, wondering why a man would expose his parents' marriage to public scrutiny. It seemed almost rude, what some might call ""unseemly""..and I'm betting there are viewers who will feel uncomfortable and stop watching this film. .

But my discomfort faded as I realized that the film captured universal hopes and fears about parents, children, marriage, and family dynamics. Do we really know our parents? How do we perceive them- and how accurate are our perceptions? What if we discover family secrets after one parent dies? And how do we integrate that info into our grief?

I found these themes to be reason enough to watch this movie. As I did I couldn't help but reflect on my own parents as well as wondering more about how my children, now adults, see me...and what they will remember when I am gone.

Doug  Block, the filmmaker, was already creating documentaries when he turned the camera on his own family. Even before his mother died, he had been filming her, his father, and siblings. Then, in only a few short weeks, she went from illness to death.

Still reeling, Block watches his father make some surprising decisions and changes in his life. From then on I was hooked.

Then Block discovers his mother's journals and learns about aspects of her life he'd never imagined. He also gains new insight about his father . The journals compel him to revisit his childhood and to examine the ""reality"" of his parents' marriage ...as well as marriage in general.

Rather than capturing ""reality"" Block actually shares his own views and perceptions about his parents and siblings. It is fascinating to watch as he grapples with the ethics of digging into the past. He asks a rabbi and others  for guidance, clearly conflicted and struggling with guilt.

Ultimately the film stands as an open and honest look at one family as well as  potential challenges faced by all couples.",1350604800,3,1951,4.831831831831832

He came across as a self-absorbed man who has spent too much time in therapy and maybe not enough focused on honoring and appreciating the gifts life has given him (he appears healthy, has healthy children, a father who is willing to open his life for public viewing, work he is passionate about, etc.  And yet, he isn't ""happy"").  His parents and their relationship were compelling subjects and I am glad to have seen this film. It certainly does provide viewers with good, meaty material for discussion.  One subject that came up in my case was how to make sure I raise children who respect me in enough to not air my personal struggles and shortfalls publicly for their benefit once I am gone.  It struck me as interesting that, at one point, the filmmaker asks his mother's best friend if she thinks his mother would have wanted her children to read her journals.  Her answer was ""yes"" and I could understand why, given that his mother had spent her whole life hiding so much of herself from the world.  However, I wish he would have addressed the question ""Would my mother have wanted all of her dirty laundry hung out in nationally-released film format?"" as well.

2837480,5,B000QFAFOU,"51 Birch Street is an excellent documentary made by a man who never expected to make a documentary about his parents' marriage. The movie flows along at a very good pace and I never lost interest; the footage shot by filmmaker Doug Block is both professional and in very good taste as he explores difficult and touchy subjects in this movie. The cinematography is excellent; Doug Block really knows how to work a camera and it's great that he worked on this film to the extent that he did! I know many people will watch this film and see similarities between the Blocks' marriage and the marriage of their own parents. We don't want to see our parents as anything less than idyllic people; and we hate to think of them as people who struggle with pent up emotions or serious interpersonal problems in their lives and marriages.

When the film starts, we see footage of Mike and Mina Block celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary at their home in Port Washington, New York. Doug and his sisters think that their parents' marriage has been essentially sound and satisfying, but when their mother dies unexpectedly their father quickly remarries--to a former secretary of his at that! Doug and his two sisters are experiencing one heck of a shocker, to say the least. At first, Doug and his two sisters are dazed; and they feel it's an insult to their very recently departed mother. What happens next is even more surprising: their father tells them that he's selling their home of nearly 50 years so he can move to Florida with his new wife, Kitty.

Of course, as they go through the house emptying out its contents, things are found and people decide if they want to keep them or not. Doug is really blown away when they come upon his mother's daily diary; she kept a typewritten and extensive diary for many years. Doug initially struggles with his desire to read his mother's diary as opposed to his desire to not find out anything upsetting about his mom or his parents' marriage. Of course, Doug must also explore with others the possibility that his mother might never want her diary read before he can comfortably read it. Doug discusses his thoughts and feelings about this with several people including a close friend of his mom's before reading the diary; and the footage we get from that is terrific. When Doug does read the diary, however, he isn't always too comfortable with what he reads. In addition, Doug's father Mike has some pretty frank comments about his marriage to his late wife that we see in this documentary; and it's insightful, well done and even educational.

We get some good bonus features as well. I particularly liked the featurette that has the Block family reacting to this film; and we get a music video entitled ""I Flunk Adultery: The Music Video."" There is the theatrical trailer as well.

51 Birch Street is an exceptional documentary in that it's rare that we get such a deep, meaningful and personal look at a marriage that simply wasn't the way it appeared to be on the surface. I highly recommend this film for people interested in the psychological and social issues tackled here; and people who like documentaries in general will not be disappointed.",1247097600,4,3197,4.713774597495528

2837482,4,B000QFAFOU,"Moving, ultimately enthralling documentary about an average suburban New York husband and wife, and their family.  And, no, it isn't a secret murder or molestation or other sensational element often seen in other family documentaries that makes this one engrossing.  It's simply the sad revelation that there were secret emotional lives, laced with frustration and sadness, under the stiff-upper-lip exteriors of the married couple who are the film's subjects.  Documentarian Doug Block's approach to his parents is clever: he first makes it seem that it was his father who had a secret life- real and interior- while his mother happily toiled away with the kids.  But it's later revealed that this description better fit Doug's mother (though I'm not completely convinced Doug's father didn't have his own very-real adventures, too, to counter his frustrations).  Still, whatever one ends up believing about what went on and where the fault originated in the marriage, the documentary itself is affectionate and non-judgemental, just wanting to understand its subjects, and feel a little sad for them for all their years of underlying unhappiness.

But there's also joy and hope in the film, in the form of Doug's 83 year-old father finding ultimate contentment with an old acquaintance (possibly old flame), to the amazement of Doug and his sisters.  It's this new relationship, however, that gets the documentary rolling in the first place, as the filmmaker and his siblings ask, ""How can Dad be married for over fifty years but then fall in love with a woman from his past only three months after his wife dies?""

Good extras shed further light on this very interesting story and on Doug Block's quirky and often entertaining extended family members.  Those family members, by the way, perform the welcome function of occasionally lightening the mood in an otherwise fairly dark film.",1224460800,10,1888,5.184210526315789
2837483,5,B000QFAFOU,"The film, both internally and in its marketing, foreshadows that the story will reveal hidden scandals.  But the movie turns out to NOT be focused on the question of:  What hidden and extraordinary scandals lurk behind this unassuming exterior?  Instead, the movie's themes focus on common marital problems and patterns from that era, an era where loyalty to marriage was considered a far higher ideal than finding individual answers or fulfilments to key personal, intimate, and social areas of life.

The film reveals that neither the father or mother (the parents of the nuclear family observed in the film) were able to find fulfilment in key important areas of their lives.  The film suggests their marriage and their specific social chemistry and interactions did not sufficiently help them find, achieve, or satisfy primary and different drives they each had.

The movie seems to support this premise:  There are some couples, who no matter how long or hard they try, have trouble meeting each others' needs.  And comparatively, there are some couples who seem to amazingly easily be able to meet each others' needs.  Whether this premise is generally true or not remains open to debate.  But the couples in this film seem to provide an example of how some couples can improve each others' worlds much easier than others.

While the movie suggests both the mother and father participated in different kinds of extensive individual therapy.  Interestingly, I don't recall anyone recounting in the film that the couple did significant couples' therapy together.

I wish the mother had been given equal opportunity to give retrospective evaluations of the perspectives asserted by the father and children.  While we get to observe her answers to some broad retrospective questions and we get some narration from her diary, she is not able to give equally ""final"" and evaluative conclusions about the totality of the circumstances.  But, of course, due to circumstances clear to anyone who has seen the film, she is not able to give equally thorough retrospective commentary.

Most people who watch this film will end up admiring and caring for the father, Mike.  And while I am part of the crowd who admires much of what he does in the film to transform his life after becoming a widower, I am probably in a minority in being critical of some of the things he said.  I have trouble with his apparently honest revelation that when asked if he misses Mina, his wife of 50+ years, his clear reply is that he does not miss her.  My general belief is that if another human being gives you daily care and service for 50 or more years, whether or not the two of you hit it off on all cylinders, you should have a more tactful reply than ""I don't miss her.""

Also, the choice of ""Only You"" at the second wedding, less than a year after his wife's death, seems insensitive to the children and his deceased wife, even if the sentiment was truly felt.

But in his defense, he may have re-phrased his answer and music choices if he'd known his actions and words were going to be distributed in a major motion picture.  Nobody's perfect.  And he is humble and does not suggest he was ideal for what Mina wanted.  Also, a wordsmith he does not pretend to be.  I do prefer his honesty.  I am still so happy for him and Kitty in the transformational choices they make to change the direction of the rest of their lives.

I left the film having as much empathy for Mina's unfulfilments as I did Mike's.  I wish both of them could have found better solutions, either together or apart, many years ago.  I am a child who grew up in a home where my mother was not given emotional fulfilment by my father, so I can easily understand how a woman in those circumstances could choose to ""survive"" by living the majority of her life as both emotionally guarded, cynical, and less inclined toward romanticism toward such a husband.

I recommend watching the ""afterwards"" extras on the DVD that give each main character the opportunity to reflect further on the assertions and opinions expressed in the film.

If you read many of the other reviews here on Amazon, the word ""universal"" appears often.  It is a term that is sometimes overused or too easily given as a positive attribute to a story.  But the term is perfect for this film.  The film, and the family, succeed because almost everyone watching probably has lived in close proximity or been in a relationship where similar chemistry issues effected decades of their lives.  This is an incredibly good film that teaches universal and important lessons.  I want to personally thank each member of the family for giving the world such an intimate and honest portrait of the reality and imperfections of real marriages, real problematic chemistries, and real adaptations.",1221782400,4,4804,4.78060606060606

I then remembered and my husband and I watched the movie that night. We were absolutely blown away by the reality of what Doug Block must have been going through. First, to have such a tragic disruption and then to figure out what secrets lie hidden beneath. I was hooked. There were such honest things that his family said. Some of which totally dumbfounded me. How could a Father say such things to his own son? It made me mad, sad, and everything in between. But, that's what the film was about. Finding out the mysteries of the life you thought you knew. After that, you face the consequences.

This film is nothing if not honest. It takes a real, hard look into the lives of this wonderfully strange family and brings them to the world in a very unique and creative way. By the time it ended, I felt as though I knew each person and I missed them when it was over.

Even though I'd seen the movie, I still went and ordered it to have my own copy. I loaned it to my in-laws and they were smitten as well. They said some of it was hard to take. I agree. Without that element of slight brutality, it would have been just another journal-esque movie about a family. It's the tragedies in life that bring all people to the same level. Then, you get to know someone for what they really are.

'51 Birch Street' is a true gem in this world of boobs and beer and so-called ""reality tv"". This is what film-making SHOULD be!!",1216771200,11,1533,4.261168384879725

Mr. Block's thoughts, opinions and disclosure are rarely seen these days and are incredibly well displayed here. It's a fine line to walk between personal truth and exploitation. This film treads very carefully and quite successfully.

While watching the film, I couldn't help but wonder what would become of myself and my girlfriend: what we would celebrate, what we would regret, what we would suppress. Such a strange, emotional thing relationships are. I feel that this film made me honestly look into the future and ponder what my current relationship would hold.

One would think that learning about how a seemingly normal couple falls short of society's expectations would give birth to pessimism...but it doesn't. Quite the opposite: it made me feel good. I feel that I now know more about marriage...about women.

Definitely check this out, it'll make you think - exactly what a good documentary should be designed to do.",1200355200,4,1100,5.168539325842697
2837489,5,B000QFAFOU,"All American, all Jewish, all current and contemporary but I thought of Bergman and WIld Strawberries and
the others.  THe music, the narration, the writing,the images all resounded and interpreted even though
they were tender and objective.  I got to know Doug as well as his family and could relate to the father,the
time and fell in love with his mother from the first scene.  I think this is a lesson in documentary film making
that might equal Maysles for this time.  Of course, I am just saying what I know as I am a painter and a woman
and not a professional of that genre.  But I am so glad that I just watched this today, again, at home on Christmas Day from my point of view.  It is intelligent and thoughtful and beautiful.",1198540800,3,734,4.4
2837490,5,B000QFAFOU,"O.K. sorry that was a pretentious title, wasn't it? Seriously though, it's true. What makes this such a profound and moving piece of work is that everyone can relate to some or most of it. It is the story of all of us really. I don't know anyone who has never resented their parents, misunderstood their parents, or wondered about what makes their parents tick. I also don't know anyone who has never regretted choices they have made. Watching this film has actually given me a greater understanding and empathy of myself and of my family. That's what is so brilliant about this film. Through the straightforward and accessible production and editing style, the filmmaker has given the viewer the ability to gain greater empathy and understanding of one's own loved ones--and one's self, not just the people covered in the film. It also happens to be an entertaining and interesting story, don't get me wrong, but again where I think it becomes brilliant is in it's ability to draw you in ad make you relate your own life to that of the characters. Not all documentaries do that. It takes a lot to make a viewer stop being purely a voyeur and actually empathize on a deep personal level with the subjects. I think it is easily a 9.0/10 if not a little better.",1197676800,3,1259,4.6
2837501,5,B000QFAFOU,"Just watched this film with my parents and, having grown up a town away from the filmmaker's family on Long Island and at about the same time, I fully related.  This is a documentary to make you think about family and appreciate one's parents as the individuals they are.  It's also a reminder of how short life is, and that happiness can strike at any time of life.  Great people are shown here in a very real way.  One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.",1197158400,4,465,4.191011235955056
2837502,5,B000QFAFOU,"During my initial viewing of Doug Block's 51 BIRCH STREET, I found myself channeling my inner-documentarian, wondering how my parents might look to the outside world as subjects.  Block's thought-provoking film confirms the notion that adult children may never truly know what issues plagued or impeded their parents.  That mommy and daddy telegraphed a warm'n'fuzzy existence to their growing children, one might find the whole process of their coming clean later in life a shocking and revolting development.  Back then, our parents were larger than life.  They were bold figures.  They were there to set the example, to provide, to not show any kinks in the armor (even though, as we came to realize, they were there).  Keep the skeletons locked in the closet for the time being, please.  Later on, after I've become self-actualized and comfortable in my own skin, it might be appropriate to discover a hidden diary or strategically-concealed flaw.  Block's film, which has parental infidelity and alienation at its core, offers keen insight into the ways in which our parents carry out their lives, manage their emotions, and present to their children while an altogether different value system percolates beneath the surface.  There is no questioning the love (which radiates and permeates) but there are questions.  Block is clearly on a quest for resolution here, be it through methodical pans across the pages of his mother Mina's writing, or zooming in on the wrinkled brow of Mike, his laconic father, during a moderately-strained interview.  The family secrets, once so carefully guarded, peel away like layers of an onion.  The skeletons bounce out of the closet, announce ""I'm here!"" and gleefully pitch the key.  True to the genre, Block lets it all unfold before the rolling camera and it becomes obvious that there is so much happening on both sides of the lens.  I wondered how I'd react if I were making a documentary about MY parents.  In my eyes, mom and dad were monogamous, committed partners in life.  My dad passed first after which my mom became very expository and frank about certain things that he did, or didn't do on her watch.  These were not calamitous for the most part, just minor indiscretions made by a man who had his family's best interest front and center.  Not incriminating or uncommon to wish for a do-over, I thought.  Like Mina, she would have been a natural on camera (I'm ready for my close-up, son).  She was eloquent and enthralling.  Now a card-carrying grown-up, I appreciated my mother's candor.  After she died nearly ten years later, no diary was unearthed.  No love letters from other suitors were found.  Flaws and faults notwithstanding, their soul mating was a chain unbroken.  Learning that one's parents doubted or masked marital love can't be an easy pill to swallow.  Clearly, acceptance on whatever terms is a far more difficult proposition.  Perhaps the elder Block finds his redemption in his subsequent marriage to Kitty.  Are we left to ponder which was the truer love?  51 BIRCH STREET is the thinking son's film, a very human and very poignant documentary that proves parents are sometimes the very best choice of participants.  Well done!",1196380800,4,3207,4.996226415094339

I've watched a couple of times now, with friends, and they all feel the same. Doug Block has managed to tap into some universal themes which he is communicating through telling the story of his parent's lives. They are unique and yet their problems are so familiar. I could write endlessly on what this film is really about, how it is going to make you feel.....but you will have to see for yourself. Trust me, the money is well spent. I urge everyone to watch this and then watch again with family, friends, loved ones.....strangers, whoever.

It's not always the Clever's and Mike Block does a wonderful job of capturing all of the individuals in his family and all of their perspectives on his family. I was captivated throughout the whole film - anxious to hear truth about the inside lives of his father and mother's relationship.  I think it gives everyone great insight into family dynamics and why you are the way you are, because of your family or origin. I'm very greatful that Mikes father and step-mother and sisters were willing to allow their story to be told. A lot can be learned from this film!  Thanks Mike!",1189296000,3,755,4.463768115942029

Please believe me, this film is neither.  What a tour-de-force in storytelling and what a fine piece of movie making.  Doug Block's ""home movie"" really serves up a good dose of emotion: love to curiosity to sadness, fear, doubt, pain, jealousy and redemption.  And the beauty of it all is IT REALLY HAPPENED.  I'm asking everyone who can to watch this film.  Congratulations, Doug.  Now, can I read the diary?",1188345600,4,573,4.835051546391752
2837507,5,B000QFAFOU,"51 Birch Street is the family discussion that most families never have. But not only do the Blocks have that discussion, documentary filmmaker Doug Block has captured it all on film and expertly crafted an easily accessible documentary that is equally amusing and moving, stirring and reassuring. What begins as one man's investigation into his parent's past slowly morphs into the most eloquently constructed, universally relatable digital home movie of all time.

Ineterspersing decades of video footage, photos, interviews, and (most notably) his mother's journals, Block examines his parent's 54-year marriage looking for clues as to why his father may have remarried only three months after his mother's death. As Block slowly unearths information from his mother's journals and through interviews with his father and relatives, the film picks up steam, building towards the inevitably cathartic finale.

But 51 Birch Street isn't just an autobiographical film about Block's parents. It's also not just a study in marital fidelity (or lack thereof). What 51 Birch Street really does is examine the disconnect between parents and children, between generations, between siblings, and between friends and documents one man's journey in bridging that disconnect. 51 Birch Street is the rare film that is designed to open dialogue on many complex issues. As Block works towards his own resolutions, audience members can't help but think about questions they may feel the need to ask or to discuss.

Inevitably there are uncomfortable moments where both Block and the audience are wondering whether he should delve any further into the past, both for moral reasons and because, as the DVD cover asks: ""Do you REALLY want to know your parents?"" Time and time again Block asks himself this question, and time and time again the answer is yes. When the secrets are laid bare and the past has been discussed, what's most rewarding about the film is the heartfelt discovery that communication and discussion clearly do aid in understanding and happiness. 51 Birch Street is the surprise documentary of the year. At a time when the documentary form is increasingly being used to further political agendas, it is a digital breath of fresh air.

The bonus features here are as entertaining and revealing as the film. In a brief featurette entitled Who Knew? Block goes back to interview various members of his family, including his father and stepmother, and gets their reactions to the film itself. But the four-minute ""I Flunk Adultery"" music video steals the DVD as Block's uncle Josh Vogel shares the entire five verses to the song with the audience, accompanied by a clever music video.",1188086400,22,2682,5.187066974595843

2837509,5,B000QFAFOU,"Don't let my subject title fool you, 51 BIRCH STREET, is not the Ani DiFranco or Sarah McLachlan of personal documentaries- meaning this is a film that men and women of all ages will enjoy (assuming that they like emotionally stirring portraits of American families!) Its just that I always find myself pleasantly surprised when I see a unflinching, emotionally accurate, and unwaveringly honest portrayal of a woman by a man. 51 BIRCH STREET is all that and more. The filmmaker Doug Block is clearly admiring of his mother, Mina, yet unafraid to show her character warts and all, in the ultimate testimony to the belief that love is being able to see someone's full character, but still really love them just as they are.  Three months after her sudden death his father reconnected with a secretary from 40 years ago, Kitty (what names, Mina and Kitty!), within the year they've married and are moving to Florida!  This was obviously was a bit of a shock to him and his sisters, and after decades of his mothers diaries were discovered during the move, Doug was inspired to make the film.
