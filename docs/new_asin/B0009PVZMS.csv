2311383,4,B0009PVZMS,"This DVD set is a great entertainment value.  Unfortunately, the set advertises closed captions but my new JVC television with closed caption ability shows no closed captions for any of the titles.  The BBC productions really need subtitles for the hearing impaired.  For some reason they don't have a policy of adding this enhancement to their DVDs'.",1128729600,53,351,5.12280701754386
2311384,4,B0009PVZMS,"I don't know about Oliver Twist, Great Expectations or Bleak House but I have been waiting a long time for Martin Chuzzlewitt, Our Mutual Friend and Hard Times. Starting with MC: unless you watch alot of Masterpiece Theater you may not recognize any of the actors but that won't hurt the story which is well and clearly told about money, greed, family (relatives near and distant rather than loved ones), kindness, friendship, love and forgiveness. The villians are especially well portrayed - you just have to hate them. I picked up the VHS of OMF on a whim because I like Dickens and was absolutely delighted. The well told themes are similar to MC but without as much of the family connection. Again you're not likely to recognize many of the actors but who cares, the love story is every bit as good as the one in Great Expectations and with far fewer impediments to fulfillment. As for HT - on Masterpiece Theater it was introduced as Dickens Darkest story and it truly is. Don't watch this if you want a happy ending - there isn't one unless it is what happens to the school master's not to wise son and to the girl from the circus. I've never seen BH so have no opinion except I think I remember vaguely that Diana Rigg starred in it. On the whole a collection well worth the money. I haven't actually seen these in their dvd format but have purchase other dvd collections from this source and found the production values to be excellent for picture and sound quality. I only gave 4 stars because I couldn't tell from the picture if OT and GE are dvd's that have been previously released or older renditions of these classic stories that I somehow missed when they were originally broadcast.",1119398400,64,1698,4.552287581699346
2311385,5,B0009PVZMS,"Movies are all excellent. Such a fantastic gift to give and receive. Highly recommend.
Charles Dickens is the best. You can't go wrong with this set of DVDs.",1383696000,,157,4.642857142857143
2311386,2,B0009PVZMS,Wasn't what I thought it would be. Not like Oliver or Nickolas Nickleby. Even though they were Kind of eerie these are to dark and sinister. And always ends sadly!,1380758400,,163,4.466666666666667
2311387,4,B0009PVZMS,"If the BBC presents it, it is bound to be good.  Of the 6 books in this series, 5 were excellent, but one seemed to need more lighting and we had difficulty following the characters.  But 5:6 is still very good.",1378425600,,211,4.121951219512195
2311388,4,B0009PVZMS,"This set contains six TV movies of Charles Dickens novels that first aired on PBS in the mid 1980s thru the 1990s.  Dickens is one of the greatest novelests in world literature.  The range of plots and characters he invented has never been surpassed.  He depicted mans inhumanity to man better than any other writer in history-simply by describing economic conditions in England in the 1850s.  These TV shows are very detailed adoptations of these six novels.  The writing is good, the acting is sometimes great- but sometimes less is more.  There are movie adoptations of two of these novels(Oliver Twist and Great Expections) from the 1940s that are far better than these TV shows.  Still, if you love Dickens, and if you have read more than one of his novels you do, you should have this set.",1370563200,2,795,4.717391304347826
2311389,5,B0009PVZMS,The product is excatly what i expected and is what I wanted to buy.  I think it is a good value as well.,1251763200,,104,3.5217391304347827
2311390,5,B0009PVZMS,"I am certainly glad that the BBC didn't give us ""high paced"" cut-down versions of Dickens' novels--as one Amazon reviewer suggested would have improved these.  In fact, the films follow the novels closely, with all of Dickens' quirky characters, such as Jaggers and Wemmick from ""Great Expectations.""

Dickens had his faults, to be sure, but they are faults of the period in which they were written, e.g., the over-use of coincidences to tighten the plots, being the greatest fault to a 21st century reader/viewer.  However, Dickens' sense of time and place and his creation of memorable characters far overshadow this and make his works delightful.

The production values, the acting, the sets are first-rate in these productions.  But if you want car chases and sex scenes, you may want to look elsewhere.  Try the James Bond films.",1247961600,4,834,5.0510948905109485
2311391,4,B0009PVZMS,"I'd rate this product higher if Closed Captioning were available. Also, at least one of the programs (Oliver) is rather ""old,"" and looks & feels dated due to how it was filmed or taped, but if you can deal with that, it's a wonderful story, and well told. Really enjoyed Martin Chuzzlewit (having never seen or read it before), and I know I love Our Mutual Friend (which is the reason I bought the set in the first place).  I do love these miniseries that take the necessary time to tell the story & capture the feel & intent of Dickens.",1247270400,2,537,4.316831683168317
2311392,4,B0009PVZMS,"What a great collections, I gave to my husband for fathers Day. He was ever so very excited,  These movies are very well done and worth every penny.",1245974400,,148,4.285714285714286
2311393,3,B0009PVZMS,I was disappointed upon receiving this package. I never got to view it. I didn't open it as there were 6 movies ok but it had one missing movie disc with 2 copies of another movie. I don't know if any others had this same problem in packaging. I have returned the unopened package and received my refund.,1243900800,,304,4.258620689655173
2311394,5,B0009PVZMS,"I am reading Charles Dickens from his first book on and after I finish reading one of his books, I watch the DVD on that book from this collection. These DVD's are real close to the books. This is a very good collection!",1242086400,,220,4.1395348837209305
2311395,5,B0009PVZMS,"Most of these productions are excellent, with the exception of Hard Times which carries the label BBC Student or School, but it appears to be someones assignment and the story is okay, but the production values are low.  Cast is good and it is worth watching once.  The rest of the productions are excellent.  My favorite is Our Mutual Friend.",1239321600,,343,4.683333333333334
2311396,1,B0009PVZMS,"There is a reason that so many after market retailers here on amazon have these at a steep discount.  In my case, three of the six DVDs refused to play on my high end, very expensive Onkio DVD player.  Of those three, one refused to play on my Dell computer.  The remaining reminded me of a joke told to me by a Stanford Ph. D. mathematician-philosopher. The tools of a mathematician are pencil, paper, and waste paper basket.  The tools of a philosopher are paper and pencil.  These stories were originally serials in magazines.  Dickens had to submit so many words on a scheduled basis and did not have a firm ideal of where the story was going.  This is in sharp contrast to Kipling who would take his finished work and make several passes of cutting out whole sentences to compact the story down to a fast paced adventure.  Dickens did not do this when the stories were published in book form.

These programs are very long winded.  They could have been easily edited down to 1/2 of their length without losing any of their  content.

John Gielgud, in an introduction to an Easton Press book, makes an aside to the effect that the Dickens characters never come across in dramatizations as well as they do in the written novels.  This series is no exception. I think this is because the books have large amounts of first person narrative describing the feelings and expectations of the character.  This internal thing cannot be displayed visually.",1223251200,4,1450,4.635294117647059
2311397,5,B0009PVZMS,"Anyone who likes the novels of Charles Dickens would, I believe, like this series.  Anyone familiar with the BBC productions of the Dickens' novels would like this series.  Anyone curious about 19th century English society would like this series.  And lastly, anyone who just likes to see a good story well acted would like this series.",1205712000,2,336,4.964285714285714
2311398,5,B0009PVZMS,"Our Mutual Friend is worth the price of admission alone. It was only out on VHS tape before, but can be had on DVD here. All DVDs have great acting and great stories.",1199145600,,166,4.0606060606060606

A must see and definitely ""family friendly"".",1188518400,,110,5.875
2311400,5,B0009PVZMS,"This collection is an embarassment of riches. Each story is divided into several episodes which take time to view and absorb. So far we have only viewed ""Bleak House"" and ""Our Mutual Friend"". Both are excellent and capture the steamy world of Dicken's London. I think I am constantly amazed at the attention to detail that the Brits recreate in historical drama. And of course there is the wealth of character playing for which Britain has always been famous.  A really excellent series.",1182816000,10,487,4.867469879518072
2311401,5,B0009PVZMS,"This collection is wonderful, you can ""watch"" these novels over and over, faithful to Dickens in tone, plot and spirit -- Highly recommended.",1180656000,,141,5.173913043478261
2311402,5,B0009PVZMS,"I've just bought the collection, I've seen 3 movies so far, they're great, faithful to the books I've read. They come with cc(closed caption)so it helps the understanding. I watch a film and read the book. They're perfect for those who are really into literature. I highly recommend them.",1180656000,6,288,4.8979591836734695
2311403,5,B0009PVZMS,"The dark stories about the impossible lives of the unfortunate makes it a kind of films that will glue anyone to the chair. BBC serieses are not like any other film, and I simply escape to anothr world every time I watch.

Had to watch it in my computer though, since it was not my region( not even after I changed the region in my ""region free"" DVD player ) which also means I had no subtitles either. A good computer screen is needed for that purpose.",1178582400,6,453,4.206896551724138
2311404,4,B0009PVZMS,"My husband and I are major fanatics when it comes to literary

pieces brought to film. We have been renting some of these classic BBC films from an online rental business. We finally decided to buy the set. My husband, being a english teacher, loved several of these films. The best two out of the set  is Martin Chuzzlewit and Our Mutual Friend. It is a shame that Hard Times did not live up to the book and was only roughly based off of it. We just finished Oliver Twist, not knowing the story at all, we were on the of our seats just waiting to hear the big twist and to see how the plot works itself out. Highly recommended, even with Hard Times being not faithful to the book.",1174953600,6,681,4.190839694656488
2311405,5,B0009PVZMS,"I am a big fan of the classics English literature and especially Dickens. He is simply the genius. In my humble opinion no other English writer can be even compared with him.

And to watch this BBC dramatization is a great pleasure too - it is true Dickens - bright and sparkling on the screen as he does in every one of his books.

If you are the newcomer to the world of his books - watch the movies and be encouraged to go for reading then. You will never regret.",1168992000,10,466,4.1098901098901095
2311406,5,B0009PVZMS,"All these titles-with the exception of ""Hard Times""-are in episode form,previouly shown weekly by the BBC.The advantage of this format is the inclusion of many more characters and side-stories than the 2 to 3 hours a movie can possibly include. Throw in superb acting and directing plus intelligent editing and each title becomes an epic in its own right.

""Hard Times"", being Dickens shortest novel, is covered in one complete movie. As a bonus the set includes no less than three half hour features:[1]Simon Callow reads to a live audience from ""Oliver Twist"".The scene is possibly the most famous in all Dickens literature; the murder of Nancy by Sykes.[2]A dramatisation of one of Dickens ghost stories,""The Signalman"".[3]A background documentary to ""Our Mutual Friend"",which among other things explains the origins and purposes of ""dust heaps""without which parts of the story become unclear. All in all this set provides many hours[32 plus]of pleasure for a miniscule purchase price.

2311407,5,B0009PVZMS,"the combination of Dickens and the huge pool of actors available to the BBC produces an unbeatable package. Seen a slightly better Bleak, never a better Chuzzlewit. There's no better value than this. Do your family a favour- buy it.",1168387200,2,232,4.825
2311408,3,B0009PVZMS,"The films appear to be well done and the actors are quite good.  The quality of the film is not so good.  On two of them, I found that they did not play well at all during parts of the play, breaking into pixels and then stopping completely.  This appears to be a flaw in the DVDs rather than in the original materials.  The lighting is quite dark - but much of Dickens is dark, so how could it be otherwise.  I'm not talented at understanding the accents of some of the actors, especially the female ones, but this is my fault and not that of the materials.

Overall, they were quite good and well worth the cost.  I would buy more like this.",1168300800,5,643,4.137096774193548
2311409,4,B0009PVZMS,"Best in the series are ""Our Mutual Friend: and ""Martin Chuzzlewit"" with Paul Scofield.

2311410,4,B0009PVZMS,Excellent BBC Production of several of Charles Dickens' masterpieces. These movies would be a wonderful way to incorporate how England/Great Britain was portrayed in the 1900's.
