2546786,5,B000EYK4H6,THe 4th season is a MUST for all Home Improvement fans! It's actually better than the 3rd season and it's very interesting to watch how the different characters like Wilson progress in their lifes. But the most important factor: The jokes are still hilarious as hell!!!,1162512000,,269,4.869565217391305
2546787,5,B000EYK4H6,"An avid fan of Home Improvement, I had been impatiently anticipating the moment when the fourth season of my favorite sitcom, Home Improvement, would be released.

Call me a weirdo, but I found myself waiting at the Home Entertainment section at Wal-Mart before midnight to get this DVD, and they were stocking it a half hour before, and I grabbed it and attempted to pay for it, but the lady at the register took it and put it up and said I had to wait a half hour. So I waited, impatiently.

I finally got home with it and before I watched it, I looked at the packaging. This time, Tim, Jill, and the kids are featured on the cover, and it looks as though Tim had a mishap and accidentally sawed off part of the DVD cover, because the lower right corner is missing! The inner art is basically the same as the other seasons, with one panel listing the episodes. Disc 1 overlaps 2 again (I hate that!), and Disc 3 gets its own little slot. Jill and the kids are on disc one; Tim, Al, and Heidi are on disc 2; Tim is all by his lonely self on disc three.

The menus are basically the same as season 3, which isn't a bad thing. The theme music plays on the main menu with the options of play all, episode select, special features (disc one), and set up. The submenus, unlike last season's release, also plays on the submenus.

The episodes are all presented correctly in the order of appearance. The two-parter of the season, ""Tool Time After Dark,"" is shown as one 43 minute episode (if you select part one)... if you select part two, you start twenty minutes into the two parter and it lasts about twenty five minutes... and no theme song... this is weird. So your best bet on that episode is to just select part one.

The video quality and audio is stunningly clear, and it does not seem as though the video is over a decade old!

Unfortunately, HI still lacks in the special features. We get a 7 minute blooper reel (which luckily is NOT the same ones you get to see in the closing credits anyway).

Some minor changes and big changes are evident in season four. The boys are older, but still not too old. Jill gets laid off in the premiere and starts back to college to pursue a degree in psychology, and we meet Tim's brother Marty and wife Nancy (who Tim sees naked in an episode). We also meet the Hardware store gang at Harry's Hardware. Tim and Al go to prison for scalping tickets to a football game, Tim neglects Jill during her illness on Superbowl day, and Wilson goes on his first date in twenty years.

Another thing you will notice is that Season Four also has a new graphics scheme (the opening theme song credits, as well as the closing credits), but we still have the same theme song. This will remain until Season 7 when the music and the graphics change.

This is a very memorable season and I would give this 5 stars, despite the lack of special features!!

Don't hesitate buying this.",1149552000,18,2906,4.335174953959484
2546788,5,B000EYK4H6,"Season 4 had some big changes in the show.

It is wonderful to be able to purchase the older TV shows like Home Improvement...back when TV was worth watching and you could watch TV shows with your children without having to quickly turn off the TV because of inapropriate and imbarassing content...which sums up all of todays sitcoms.

Under 3 stars Richard Coleman remarks that the 4th season disc are transparent which is true, but I didn't get the chinese writing with mine. The most annoying thing is the sound. The music and background laughter are louder than the talking. It's almost unwatchable! The picture is also dark and a little out of focus. I noticed the 5th season discs have the same appearance but I haven't watched them yet. I wouldn't think they're pirated but I'm not sure I would recommend them.",1250553600,,622,4.513274336283186

2546910,5,B000EYK4H6,"Well, for me, I have another exciting season of Home Improvement in my DVD collection.  This season is one that I consider the peak of Home Improvement's eight year run.  Don't get me wrong, there are other great seasons, but this one continues to take audiences along for the ride.  This season, Tim continues his crazy hijinks as the accident-prone host of Tool Time, a local cable television show and the accident-prone ""man of the house.""  Season 4 has some of Tim's BIGGEST goof-ups including a segment on how to drop a four ton steel  beam on your wife's car and how to blow up a house 101.
This is the season when Jill finally gets her first (and only) long-term plot line.  She goes back to college!  Of course Tim and Jill continue to raise their three sons.  Brad, Randy, and Mark don't have major plot lines in this season, but they continue to be the life of the Taylor house, offering humor wherever possible.  They do get episodes about them, for instance ""Quibbling Siblings"" is about Brad, ""The Eyes Don't Have It"" is all for Mark, and ""It's My Party"" is all about Randy.  Of course, Season four continues to feature Earl Hindman as the all-knowing advice machine of a neighbor, Wilson, and Richard Karn again returns as the butt of Tim's jokes and his assistant on Tool Time, Al Borland.  Al features in the Halloween episode entitles the ""Borland Ambition"" and ""Bachelor of the Year.""  Debbie Dunning also returns as the Tool Time girl, Heidi, whose job continues to be to announce Tool Time and it's host.
Season 4 comes with three discs, each containing eight or nine episodes.  The only bonus feature on the set is a blooper reel that has never-before-seen bloopers.  While bloopers can be funny and entertaining (and short), I have often believed that the Home Improvement series DVDs could have had more bonus features.  So much effort went into creating this series, it would have been cool to get the cast and crew's perspectives on how the show was made.
Don't judge this DVD set by how many or few features it contains.  The real art are the episodes.  Enjoy them and savor them.  This show is one of the most entertaining shows out there and will never fail to make you laugh.  When you are done, you will be screaming for more!  Take my word for it!",1208131200,4,2278,4.564039408866995
2546911,5,B000EYK4H6,"I have all the Home Improvement DVD's released to date and they are all very funny and entertaining. No matter what issues are encountered, there is always an underlying family love that surfaces. Wholesome family entertainment.",1187827200,,228,5.361111111111111
2546912,3,B000EYK4H6,I don't know if this means its a pirate copy but the disc is see through and the title is in chinese when we insert the disc into the computer. Works alright though and the show is good.,1173744000,,186,3.9210526315789473
2546913,5,B000EYK4H6,Funny show and its great to be able to watch it anytime you want!  Who couldn't use a good laugh once in a while?,1168300800,,113,3.7083333333333335
2546914,5,B000EYK4H6,"Home Improvement was a show that has set the standard for ethical and humorus family style entertainment.  This is what Disney should still be doing today!  It would be hard to believe that most everyone hasn't seen at least a couple of episodes of this classic commedy.  The quality shines through as the bumbling antic's of the show's star, Tim Allen are as funny today as they were 10 years ago.  Its good clean FUN!  without the boring sexual innuendos and outright disgusting dialog that plague today's ""family"" TV shows.",1164931200,4,526,4.8
2546915,4,B000EYK4H6,"Being a die hard fan of ""Home Improvement"" and seeing classic,old shows (""Seinfeld"",""Everybody Loves Raymond"",""Friends"",etc.)that have been released on DVD,it is great to see ""Home Improvement"" being added to that list of shows coming to DVD. Despite the problems that ""Home Improvement"" faced before it came to the end,if it was not for HI,the standard for comedy television of today would not be as well as it is--one fact that is documented within this entire DVD set.

If you are a hardcore fan of ""Home Improvement"" and noticed through purchasing the first three season DVDS for HI how the show changed every season,you will be satisfied with this set. It is pretty much the first season recaptured,with new,original life to it. This collection of every season four episode of ""Home Improvemnt"" does a good job at not only picking up on the regular customs that every single HI episode had (what the marriage of Tim (Tim Allen)and Jill (Patricia Richardson)was like,the trouble that their sons Brad (Zachary Ty Bryan),Randy (Jonathan Taylor Thomas),and Mark (Taran Noah Smith),and what went on on Tim's ""Tool Time"" cable television show and all of the issues that surrounded it),season four of HI added more to the show. While the opening episode of season four of HI,""Back In The Saddle Shoes Again"",is a little bit dull while the two ""Tool Time After Dark"" episodes were not really needed except for the nostalagia of earlier HI seasons,this season does a good job at letting itself ""explore"". Here,not only is the mother of Jill,Lillian (Polly Holiday)re-introduced while Jill's father,Colonel Fred Patterson (M. Emmet Walsh),is introduced for the first time (with hillarious results following),showing all of the problems that Lillian and Fred faced as they got older and how the both of them annoyed each other. This helps ""Home Improvement"" be a show that is not only funny,but also has serious elements to it at the same time,which is usually what makes a comedy television show good. The episodes that are on this set also do a good job at telling more about Tim's family (his brothers Marti and Boy,and his sister-in law,Nancy,who are both documented in a hillarious and entertaining episode on disc three,""The Naked Truth""--wait until you see what happens there!!!!),which makes the show more interesting,honest,and entertaining. Seeing how Brad,Randy,and Mark progress in life as they keep getting older is documented within this set,something that every season of HI showed once step up for every season,with hillarious results each time.

My only complaint is that while this set was put together and does a wonderful job at representing the season for episodes of ""Home Improvement"",it still lacks what the DVD sets for the first,second,and third seasons of ""Home Improvement"" lacked--SPECIAL FEAUTURES!!!! While the bloopers (highlights from previously released ""Home Improvement"" episodes from the first three seasons of HI,and unreleased parts of certain previously released/unreleased HI episodes)are hillarious and the sneak peeks that were included here are worth a look,where are the interviews with the cast members,and a production look into the fourth season of ""Home Improvement""? I can't understand why the producers of the ""Home Improvement"" DVDS keep leaving what could be excellent bonus feautures out of this set-- but hopefully,once the last HI season is available on DVD,the bonus feautures that I mentioned will be there,and the forthcoming HI season DVDS will be good.

Overall,a great set that is worth the money that is required to pay for it--a job well done.",1163203200,4,3601,5.248263888888889
