If you are a prime member I would say give it a try. But I would not recommend paying
to watch the movie. Acting is subpar, the movie is 100% green screen maybe by design they were
going for this over the top look but not sure. It reminded me of Idiocracy due the future
feel and dumb downed though process of the actors.  I did enjoy  the Eminem rap video since
I'm a weird AL Yankovic fan, but that was the only part got a laugh from.  Just on this part I was tempted
to go two star as it was funny.  But I'm giving it one star due to the inability for myself and wife to endure to the end.",1381449600,8,677,3.8489208633093526
5675720,1,B00BUGZX50,I could only fathom about 15 minutes of this movie before I decided it was a waste of time.  This film is low budget and it shows with its mundane actors and crappy green screen background.  Don't bother wasting your time with this one.  It belongs in the file and forget category.,1381104000,8,281,4.365384615384615
5675721,1,B00BUGZX50,"I TRIED to give this movie a shot. The other person who gave it a bad review was right. I wish I could say it was worth your time and I generally don't review movies. If you're over the age of about 5, I doubt that you'll have the patience to watch it. To put into some kind of perspective, if you want SIFI, you'll enjoy 50's or 60's movies better. I turned this off after about 10 minutes because it just wasn't worth my time to watch more of it.",1381017600,10,448,3.934065934065934

5675723,5,B00BUGZX50,"Not to be confused with the 1990 stinker. This was produced over seven years by students with no budget, and it's a great spoof -- sort of ""The Player"" meets ""Amazon Women from the Moon."" It's no ""Some Like It Hot,"" but it definitely shows you what creative people with a vision and a sense of humor can do. Watch it, and then watch for Ramos, Phillips, and Rogers' next projects.",1375142400,,380,4.366197183098592
5675724,5,B00BUGZX50,"This film is a super creative ride through a possible Hollywood future that pokes fun at the movie-making industry of today while introducing us to amusing characters and tons of hilarious film references. If you like Star Wars, you'll especially enjoy character Rufus Lucas (George's great-great- grandson, or something like that) who speaks in nothing but Star Wars quotes! There's even an exciting light saber battle amid the flying cars. It's quite awesome. The effects are especially amazing when you realize this film was made by three creative guys with no budget using green screens and computers in their garage. Incredible! It really does have a little something for everyone, from theme-park fun to a budding romance to a dinosaur chase. Some parts will probably be a bit scary for the youngest kids (and a lot of the humor will fly right over their heads), but overall it's safe for the family. There is a drunk character and a subplot about a sleazy rich guy hoping to seduce the studio starlet, but it's handled with humor and without anything remotely graphic. And I especially enjoy the acting of the corporate executive character Lamar as he's pushed further and further to the edge of sanity. The film is a visual delight, and a wild ride. There's even a full-blown, large-scale, and well-done musical number thrown in for extra Hollywood style. If you get the DVD, you'll probably want to watch the film more than once and pause it frequently to check out all the hilarious film parody posters sprinkled throughout the futuristic movie studio. Creative and clever, Flashback is a film you'll definitely want to see and share! :)",1366416000,3,1647,4.928057553956834

To be fair, there are a couple of mildly funny jokes hidden here and there, but the price you have to pay to glean them is brutal.  The special-effects are so astronomically special that it actually works better just to remove the word 'effects' entirely.  Yep, they are just plain special.

  The acting was sometimes over the top, but again, INTENTIONAL as, again, this was SATIRE.
  Actually, in terms of low-budget films, the special effects were far better than the usual.

5675777,5,B00BUGZX50,"A studio janitor manages to win the affection of a starlet, alter time, and become the head of production in this gem of a film set in a dystopian future. It is well paced, written, acted, directed and funny as hell. I saw Flashback at a film festival and heard the film-makers speak afterward. This is no student film but it is the first feature film of a group of filmmakers, most of whom met in high school. The making of this film took all their spare change and spare time through college and grad school. I have since bought the Flashback DVD.  I highly recommend you do the same.
The film manages to satirize what the studios have become; while at the same time, it honors dozens of the great film-makers of the past and present. Knowing the history of film-making adds to the revelry, nevertheless I believe the film works on many levels for all ages and stages of cinema savvy.
The film-makers chose to shoot the film against a green screen on a leap of faith. They called their style digital origami. This put a premium on tediously crafted editing. The results in this case are very impressive. I was told they used the program After Effects. I had no idea the program had the capacity to support what they achieved. The mis en scene is a visual delight. The excellent score by George Shaw and the production numbers written by the film-makers themselves are a tip of the hat to the great epics and musicals of Hollywood from the 1930s to the present.
I wonder what they could have achieved with a budget. I hope they get a chance to show us. Still, Sweet are the uses of adversity. Speaking of spare change be sure to check under your sofa cushions, take what you find, and buy this DVD.",1386979200,,1699,4.4281150159744405

5675804,4,B00BUGZX50,"Flashback is a clever romantic science-fiction comedy which skillfully blends inexpensive computer-generated backgrounds (similar to those populating early 3-D games such as Doom) with live-action characters to create what could be described as a live-action cartoon. While the title is somewhat misleading in that time travel is far from central to the plot, what makes the film worth watching is  the lovely romance between the protagonists, driven largely by the delightful stage presence of Alexa Cappiello, who combines the potent sexuality of a young Kathleen Turner with the innocence and vulnerability of a Natalie Wood. Not only that but the movie is genuinely funny, particularly in its clever mockery of sequel making, a spot on parody of rapper Eminem and even a musical number worthy of Broadway. The special effects work almost as well as the 2-D cartoons they appear intended to imitate, and the film reminds me of nothing so much as Who Framed Roger Rabbit in its placement of live action characters in an unabashedly cartoonish world. The films one drawback is the acting, which with the glaring exception of Ms. Cappiello is somewhat amateurish.
