3064405,2,B0011ATJZA,"So obviously if you are looking at this film titled ""Naked Massacre"" you have either seen it or enjoy copious amounts of nudity and massacres. Either way, I think you will enjoy the film. But As there are no other reviews and the title pretty much speaks for itself, I won't review the film itself. But its quality.
It is a VHS transfer. There are times where the video shakes, and you can see tracking lines in the image. The actual clarity of the transfer isn't terrible. It is watchable, but I wish more information was given to let us know it was a VHS transfer. There are no special features at all. The sound quality is slightly hollow. This seems to be an ""official"" release. I just wish a better job was done on the transfer. If you can find it fairly cheap, I recommend it as its a decent exploitation flick. But more importantly, if you have a VCR, get the vhs. For you'll be getting about the same quality and VHS box art is always much better.",1338076800,4,955,4.311111111111111
3064406,5,B0011ATJZA,"Based on the horrible nurse killing spree committed by Richard Speck, a drug addicted merchant marine & petty crook turned serial killer in 1960's Chicago, and eventually became one of the most notorious prisoners in US history (thanks to his ""home movies"" shot while in prison, showing him doing coke & his ""wife"", a small black dude). However, this movie was made only a short while after the murders, so none of Speck's post-massacre activities are covered, and like the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" before it, takes the basic real story plot & builds a fictional story around (in TCM it's the Ed Gein story taken to Texas), with this film, it's the Speck murders in Ireland, right in the middle of infamous guerilla war between England & the IRA. In this ""re-imagining"" of the crimes, Speck is renamed Caine & is an highly mentally disturbed Vietnam vetren on his way home from service. Long story short, Caine drifts around the war-torn Ireland, drinking, stealing & beating prostitutes, until he eventually comes across the nurses, and after a failed break in, he leaves only to come back later that night. From then on, the movie kicks into sadistic high gear, with gory, disturbing murder scenes, usually committed with a long switchblade, there is also mass ammounts of 70's nudity & semi-sex scenes. For the most part, the movie does an decent job at re-telling Speck's savage spree, even how he missed his last victim (who hid under a bed), to his capture, which was caused when he tried to committ suicide by slashing his wrists, however, this back-fires, as he is saved & once his arm is cleaned of blood, his tell-tell tattoo of ""Born for Hell"" (""Born to Raise Hell"" in real life) is discovered & he is captured.

Overall, it's a nasty, disturbing, indie-made grindhouse-explotation flick about the deeds of a true psychopath. 5 stars if you like the genre or horror, probably 0 if you dont. Well worth the buy though in my opinion.",1322956800,7,1943,4.782738095238095
3064407,1,B0011ATJZA,"Mathieu Carrire plays Cain Adamson, a Viet Nam veteran stuck in Belfast, Ireland.  The movie makes it seem that Cain has some issues early in the film.  Cain appears to be trying to figure out how to get money to return to the United States, but appears to be having little luck.

Perhaps a defining moment in this movie is when Cain is in crossfire between British soldiers and IRA members.  Cain seems disturbed by the violence, though we are unsure of where the movie is taking us.  Remember, Cain was described multiple times in the movie as a Viet Nam veteran and being a Viet Nam veteran is supposedly good credentials for committing bizarre acts, even though generally untrue.

Cain wanders around some more and eventually ends up at a rooming house for nurses.  With only a knife, Cain manages to talk all the nurses into either tying each other up or letting him tie them up.  Cain then tortures and commits an array of perverse acts with the nurses killing along the way.

The basis for this movie was the acts of Richard Speck, who broke into a Chicago townhouse on July 13, 1966, and raped and killed the eight young nurses living in the townhouse.  The movie follows the story of Speck quite closely, including the ninth woman who survived by hiding under the bed.  Cain's capture in the movie is also quite close to Speck's real life capture.

The problem with this movie is that it is pointless and sometimes disturbing.  Disturbing can be good, but for me there was no redemption for anyone at the end of the movie, so the disturbing seemed to serve no real point.  I was looking for a message or deep meaning, and there appeared, to me, to be nothing.

If you are looking for a movie where a deeply disturbed individual murders a bunch of young nurses, well, you found it.  If you think this movie is somehow going to be enjoyable, forget it.

Not that anyone cares, but the picture quality was below average.  The sound was also below average and occasionally I had a hard time understanding the dialogue.  Part of the problem might have been the accents, but after a bit of internet research I learned that the editing of the movie is such that the dialogue was clipped in some places.

This movie also has an alternate title, ""Born for Hell.""  The alternate title does not make the movie any better.

Good luck!",1302220800,,2331,4.526315789473684
3064408,3,B0011ATJZA,"Gritty and in some ways functioning on a level with Abel Ferrara's ""Driller Killer"". NM transplants Richard Speck's  Chicago mass murder to Belfast during a turbulent war torn period in history. Even more disturbing is the director chose to make the antagonist a Viet vet and somewhat sympathetic in a ""Taxi Driver"" vein. Interesting idea not quite carried out to its fullest but nevertheless compelling. Psychological subtext seems at war with its own luridness. It would be interesting to see this film released through a company like Anchor Bay with some extras and a better transfer than whats floating around. A commentary track from the director would be nice too. Oh, and lose that title!",1271548800,,695,5.043478260869565

8241376,3,B0011ATJZA,"Evident by the lurid, nonsensical title that was most likely slapped on the final print by seedy exhibitors and greedy theater owners, Naked Massacre aims for the profound but falls victim to the basest genre trappings.
The film advertises itself as being based on the infamous Richard Speck case. Speck was an American mass murderer in the sixties who killed six female nurses during a home invasion. The film is merely inspired by the story, changing the locale from Chicago to Ireland. The switch works, giving the horror film an interesting backdrop, a war torn country besieged by the IRA, and setting it apart from similar themed movies like Last House on the Left and Last House on the Beach.
The main character of the film, not named Richard Speck though he shares certain similarities, is a Vietnam vet trying to return to the United States.
Surprisingly for a movie of this ilk, the film spends more time with the killer than with his victims. The nurses are non-entities drawn in broad strokes. The most recognizable actress, Carole Laure, is known for starring in Sweet Movie, a Yugoslavian film much more successful in blending socio-political statements with explicit sex and violence.
Once the killing starts the movie devolves into a nasty grindhouse film. Scenes where our main character terrorizes a pregnant victim or forces one woman to perform oral sex on another crosses the line of good taste and belittles the measured film that came before it.
Still, the movie is worth a look and recommended because of its  unique place among horror films. Though flawed, Naked Massacre deserves to be seen by a wider audience.

8241378,2,B0011ATJZA,"An American Viet Nam veteran, named Cain Adamson (Mathieu Carriere) passes through Belfast, Ireland on his way back to the states. While in town, Cain notices a group of nurses living together, and decides to pay them a visit. First however, he stays in a homeless shelter where we learn that he's a war hero. We are also introduced to the nurses, who are all nice young ladies, just trying to get by in life. Simultaneously, Cain reveals his darker, more violent side when he abuses a prostitute. From the set-up, it's obvious that Cain and the nurses are on a collision course. He even walks in during the day looking for a meal. The kind-hearted girls feel compassion for him, and show Cain nothing but kindness before he leaves. Sadly for them, he'll be back again, and they have no idea of the horrors they're in for. Cain is, among other things, a psychopathic, sexual sadist.  His return is a shocking, vile display of rape and murder. All of this happens w/ the British occupation of Ireland as a backdrop. NAKED MASSACRE is a deadening, hopeless film. Fans of bleak -and superior- movies like COMBAT SHOCK or I STAND ALONE might enjoy this wicked slab of madness and doom. Others would be well-advised to stay miles away from this one, especially if non-stop misogyny, humiliation, torture, and death make you ill! Loosely based on the Richard Speck case, NM definitely captures the pure terror and suffocating atmosphere of such an event. Whether that's a good thing is certainly debatable.

8241381,1,B0011ATJZA,"Don't bother - this movie is terrible.  It's loosely based on the Richard Speck murders, but none of the characters are really developed and the killer's motivation is decidedly unclear.  It has very little in the way of production values - it's almost amateurish.  Additionally, the DVD I received appeared to have been copied from a VHS tape recording of the movie with all the specks, streaks and wavy audio you get from VHS.  There were no end credits, and the disk continued to play a black screen at the end (counted in the run time) for at least ten minutes (I shut it off after that).",1340150400,,592,4.5046728971962615
