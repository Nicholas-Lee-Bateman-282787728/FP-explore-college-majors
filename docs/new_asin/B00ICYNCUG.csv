8640917,5,B00ICYNCUG,"I have Rheumatoid Arthritis. With the help of Sue and her creative, highly motivating and energetic personality, I have found my favorite form of exercise!! The water has allowed me to have little or no impact on my joints and has given me the ability to develop my strength, flexibility and stamina. Sue's videos are well designed to make each workout lots of fun,easy to follow and the results I am able to achieve have convinced me that this all over body workout can't be beat. I have tried many forms of exercise in the past, but Sue and her approach to exercise and her style of teaching with enthusiasm and expertise are second to none. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THESE VIDEOS!!",1392768000,3,677,4.603305785123967
