8316968,4,B00004ZEC5,"During one of the scenes the picture has some tracking issues, but it resolves quickly. It's understandable for a VHS.",1360972800,,118,4.95
8316969,5,B00004ZEC5,"My 20-month-old daughter sends hugs and hisses (at the ""Bad Cat"") for your Mousecracker puppet show in Sonoma last month.  We were seated too close and on the side to really enjoy the entire creation, but I purchased the video and thus far we have watched Clara and the Mousecracker each night (sometimes twice!) since your show.  Even more impressive (to me, at least) is that while out in a store after Christmas, my daughter heard Tchaikovsky's music and started screaming ""MOUSECRACKER, MOUSECRACKER.""
At her age, she particularly delights in the opening sequence where the tree falls on the set dresser; she marches with the soldiers, squirms like the snake and giggles when The Pie says hello.
So we thought you'd like to know that you've won a mother's admiration and her daughter's affection.  We'll look for your other shows to come to our town, and for more of your excellent videos.",978566400,,893,4.8618421052631575
8316970,4,B00004ZEC5,"Kids don't necessarily like what their parents like. I was pleased then to discover that my kids liked the Mousecracker video, a video I myself enjoy for its artistic merits.  My 9 year-old enjoyed the video the first time through for the pure entertainment value. Now he likes to watch the puppets and theorize how they are constructed and moved. My 6 year old likes to watch, hum with the music, and dance a little. My 3 year old won't watch anything else in its entirety. She is enthralled by The Mousecracker video from start to finish. On nights when the kids are permitted a video, she starts chanting 'Mousecracker, Mousecracker, Mousecracker!'. We are eagerly awaiting the next release from Snapdragon Video Productions.  It is sure to be another high quality, non-violent, artistic creation.",971136000,3,800,4.962686567164179
