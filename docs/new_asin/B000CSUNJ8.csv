2473547,5,B000CSUNJ8,"As the other review suggests, this is a show that you will either adore or utterly loathe.  It all depends on whether you can appreciate Andy Milonakis' unclassifiably wacky sense of humor.  I discovered this show while channel-surfing late one night, and by the end I was literally sobbing from laughter.  It is a very different kind of comedy show, consisting of short clips that last anywhere from 10 seconds to a couple of minutes, and encompassing anything and everything that Andy can think up.  In one skit he orders a pizza and when the guy brings it he acts all upset and says that Andy Milonakis died exactly one year ago today, in a horrible pizza accident.  In another he writes the world's stupidest play and then tries to get people on the street to audition for it.  Yet another has him as ""Karate Lincoln"" in a stovepipe hat, and he blocks people who try to pick the potato chip crumbs out of his fake beard.  Sometimes he freestyle raps, hilariously.  It's all very childish, beyond a doubt, but unlike shows like Tom Green and Viva La Bam, it never comes across as obnoxious or mean-spirited.  Andy is just out to have a good time, and I'm personally delighted that MTV is releasing his show on DVD, because I think it is an absolute riot.",1137110400,10,1257,4.5265486725663715
2473548,1,B000CSUNJ8,"This is by far the worst show I've seen all year and it's most certainly one of the worst shows of the 21st century. This show is idiotic, boring, stupid, and just plain dreadful. There is nothing good here, the jokes are not funny and the plot lines are stupid. I'm glad that this garbage got cancelled. This was just a new low point for American television. Thank God it's off the air. In the universe of bad television, The Andy Milonakis show is a towering achievement and may be the ultimate achievement.",1137024000,10,509,4.483870967741935

2473569,3,B000CSUNJ8,"Andy had a gray patch on the right side of his head. That's the only thing that looks old on him. His show is just a little to odd to follow. A few of the skits are funny here and there, but some just don't make much sense or are just to childish to be too amusing.

Some of the skits are a little embarassing like his man-on-the-street trying to get people's reactions. Most just look at him like he's nuts. One guy even tells him to take his pill.

It's an ok one time watch, but repeated viewing for me are not in the future.",1303689600,,528,3.9716981132075473

He is off the wall crazy and the kind of person that you can just look at and start laughing.  His opening song is hilarious, I mean where did he get lyrics like that?  Even Beck himself is probably jealous of those lyrics (See Below).

I rock peas on my head, but don't call me a pea head.  Bees on my head, don't call me a bee head. Bruce Lees on my head, but don't call me a Lee head.  Now please excuse me, I gotta get my tree fed.

You wear name brands and I make my own clothing.  I hang out with an apple who loves self-loathing.  (Apple: I hate myself)  Pancakes on my face, makes me extra happy.  I like shampoo bottles that sit on my lappy, Cause its my show you can't tell me what to do.

When life hands me lemons I make beef stew.

So, yo! I gotta go, It's time for me to get rock'n.  I put bologna in my left pocket.  Smear some cream cheese in my gold locket.  Cause its my show and I'm Andy Milonakis.  It's my show I'm Shmandy Shmiloshmakis.
It's my show and I'm Andy Milonakis.

Okay, if you are still reading this review, stop now and go buy yourself a copy of 'The Andy Milonakis Show First Season'.  I'm sure you will like this if you have a sense of humor.  Completely crazy, off the charts funny and yes he is original.  I can't really compare him to anyone, cause no one is like Andy.  Enjoy this and why you are at it, go ahead and buy his Second Season.",1190419200,3,3309,4.288492706645057
2473576,1,B000CSUNJ8,"Absurd humor is a very difficult thing to pull off. When it works, it's funnier than just about anything you can think of. And when it fails.... you get The Andy Milonakis Show.

The entire show revolves around a grown man who, for some reason, looks like a 12 year old boy (...whatever) doing weird things. Had this been executed with a little tact, or any sense of intelligence whatsoever, the possibilities could have been endless for this show. However, Andy Milonakis is a terrible performer, incredibly irritating, and the ""writing"" on the show is just about as lame and unfunny as it could possibly be.

Look, I'm a HUGE fan of absurd humor. Pretty much anything on adult swim, the Tenacious D show, Family Guy, Monty Python, Mr. Show, I live for that stuff. But leave it to MTV to pick up the worst, most watered down variant of this style of comedy to put on their pathetic network. It takes intelligence and skill to pull off a show like this, and Andy Milonakis doesn't have any of these things. Avoid at all costs.",1174953600,9,1026,4.54054054054054
2473577,2,B000CSUNJ8,"Thank God this dumbass looks like he does, otherwise he'd be broke and homeless.  He's an idoit.",1171584000,3,96,4.647058823529412
2473588,5,B000CSUNJ8,"This show is really cool. I bought this great DVD set at DVD planet on sale. I was so happy that I got to buy this. This DVD has Eight episodes of the Andy Milonakis Show.

Enjoy this wonderful DVD set.

2473589,1,B000CSUNJ8,andy milonakis makes me sick to my stomach i hate his show it is the STUPIDEST s*** ever. The show so horrible after watching some of it leaves me with a even more dislike for this weird *** adult acting and trying to entertain teenagers. Andy's show sucks and instead of wasting time with this **** be better off buying a copy of the Tom Green show. i wish i could give it no stars and my grandma did not get me this ****,1149379200,5,422,4.035714285714286
2473590,5,B000CSUNJ8,"This is my favorite new show of the past year. Probably the most consistently clever and funny ""sketch"" comedy show ever, if you can call it that. Andy seems to be taking his cues from Tom Green's pioneering work in the antisocial ""reality comedy"" and ""acting insane"" niches, but thankfully he isn't trying to one-up Tom, he just does his own thing. The use of weird camera tricks, like making Andy's head hover around, lots of marbles fall out of his mouth, or people going through his tv screen is the most original aspect. Other trademarks of Andy's comedy include making inanimate objects talk (staple remover vampire is the best), an abscence of sex references, and his obsession with food. More than half the bits revolve around food in some way. Andy's co-stars are his best friend Ralphie, who reminds me of Wesley Willis, and a couple of old people who I guess live in his building. None of them are very funny. It doesn't detract from the show, as it leaves most of the focus on Andy, but the co-stars really are not funny. The pranks on delivery men is the only kinda unfunny part. Andy doesn't get much of a reaction out of them other than a bemused look, and he seemed to bail on the bits halfway through when he realised they weren't working, so I don't know why they ended up in the show.

Anyway buy The Andy Milonakis Show on dvd. You can put your arm near it.",1148947200,3,1377,4.442687747035573
2473591,4,B000CSUNJ8,I watched an episode and didn't like it but then i watched another and really liked it. But i still say WTF.,1148860800,,108,3.9545454545454546
2473592,5,B000CSUNJ8,the reason why they should so they can watch andy milonakis on the go!,1147478400,,70,4.071428571428571
2473593,5,B000CSUNJ8,"Don't have a heart attack man!! Andy is 30 years old!! he was born '77! You don't have to be so stuck up about it either. If you don't like it, don't watch it. Don't be a jerk just because you can. Just because you have no sense of humor doesn't mean you should try to spoil the fun for others that do. Personally, I think Andy is hilarious.

Rock On!!",1145491200,,352,3.9577464788732395
2473594,5,B000CSUNJ8,hey lance did u forget to tke ur ridilin? buddy its just a freaking show! if u don't fu898ing like it don't watch it. I think its funny because its original and sometimes i like some clean stupid humor. and buddyjust cause ur some 40 year old guy living in ur parents basement writing reviews aboutshows that are ment for teneagers doesnt mean anyone ones gonna change what they think. get a life wtf man?,1145145600,2,405,4.413333333333333
2473595,1,B000CSUNJ8,"...then why is the ""star"" of this ""show"" just a kid? I honestly don't understand the mentality of hollywood. If you've got labels on the back of a dvd that's saying not to let kids watch it,then what makes hollyood think that minors are responsible enough to be part of a mature show?

 Probabally for the same reason that Wonder Showzen has 4-8 year old children on it's show and uses them as hate propoganda tools. Probabally for the same reason that Adult Swim is now on during the weekend so kids can watch it and 14 years old is now considered adult.

 As for MTV,I can see why they need a kid to entertain them,as they have infantile minds to begin with. Wasn't the whole purpose of MTV2  to create a channel JUST to play music videos?

Now we get this junk;how did this all come to be?Did some big wig at a meeting just say,""Hey I've got a great idea! Let's get some annoying little puke from out of grade school,give him a guy with a camera and watch him harrass and annoy people much older than him! Now let's give him money and fame! Woohoo!The viewing public is so stupid,they'll watch anything!""

 This little Andy jerk will follow the same path as Tom Green.

People will say he's funny for awhile,then when reality finally hits and they see that he's really just annoying,sarcastic and talentless;they'll drop him like a hot potato. He'll be yet another worthless fad to disappear.

 Yes,the fat,ugly arrogant little pug that is Andy Milonakis has the special ability to make alot of people genuinly angry just by looking at him...but it's nothing that a good old fashioned butt kicking couldn't fix. Where are his parents??Put a muzzle on that little A.D.D spaz,get him away from snoop dog and ground him!",1144454400,3,1720,4.570032573289902
2473596,5,B000CSUNJ8,"I just downloaded the season premeire of Andy on iTunes (check it out, it's free!), and I couldn't stop laughing!  My friend led me to this show and I'm very fortunate that he did.  I will get this as soon as I can, and you should too!",1144368000,2,235,3.978723404255319
2473597,4,B000CSUNJ8,I love this show. I have already ordered it. The only bad thing is that he is 30.  I don't know how he does it. create all the random and stupid stuff teenagers usually come up with. it is hilarious though. so order it! order it know!!!,1144195200,,236,4.0212765957446805
2473598,5,B000CSUNJ8,"Well I guess like a lot of people I was stunned to learn that Andy Milonaki is NOT a teenaged boy like he looks but actually in his 30's!  I mean...I was thinking where is this kids parents?  But the show, with all it's juvenile humor is quite silly but still pretty funny.  The best parts are when Andy takes to the streets of New York to interact with people on the street.  Their reactions to this crazy ""kid"" are absolutely priceless.  Andy runs down the street with a giant cow tongue hanging out of his mouth screaming as astonished onlookers watch.  Or he hands out balloons to people saying ""I hate Myself...have a nice day!""  Andy likes to have fun with pizza or Chinese food delivery guys.  In one episode he is all tied up to a chair as the delivery man arrives.  These guys normally speak little English so their reactions are really funny.  In another, Andy takes his pizza and disappears to get money, only to come back with the pizza and complain that there's a tennis shoe on it.  But that's OK because he says it's the one he lost.  And so it goes as Andy moves from one prank to another.

There's no theme to the episodes, just Andy goofing off.  Each episode has a guest star such as Carson Daly or Snoop Dog.  The reason it's so hard to believe that Andy isn't a kid is that his escapades are things you'd think only a kid could possibly come up with.  Still it's funny and the show has a lot of heart.  Andy gets to do things that I suppose a lot of us would like to do.  Great Fun!",1143590400,13,1503,4.195804195804196
2473599,1,B000CSUNJ8,"I'm an Andy Milonakis fanatic.  I saw every episode of season 1 at least 5 times.  I haven't been this stoked about a show since Sifl and Olly, or Tom Green left the airwaves.  Now this review is for the `real fans'.  See I bought Andy as soon as I got out of work.  Threw it into the DVD player, and something terribly wrong happened.  All the original music has been replaced!  The Dr. Curly skit is no longer amusing as Master P's `I miss my homies' has been replaced with some terrible crunk track that does not fit at all.  Mike Jones was removed from the Milkshake skit, Gorillaz was replaced during the Dream skit.  Even Green Day's `American Idiot' is removed from the end credits.  MTV was to cheap to license the original songs, and the skits suffer as a result.  MTV needs to be punished!  They could have at least had the decency to warn a brutha, but no, they thought they could get away with it.  So rise up people.  Do everything in your power to voice you contempt for the penny-pinching powers that be.  Keep watching the reruns and do not buy this DVD set until they release the original music.  Hey MTV, you owe me twenty bux!  On a positive note, the unaired skits are every bit as good if not better then the ones that aired, but it still doesn't remove the sour taste from within my mouth.",1143590400,31,1311,4.285714285714286
2473600,5,B000CSUNJ8,"I love this show for reasons that most people wouldn't and probably can't relate to the average viewer.  So beware.  The show is a complete stream of consciousness start to finish.  As in, welcome to someone else's brain without the explanation of why he has chosen to show you the things you're seeing.  Or even more deeply he is not in control of what you see, good, bad or ugly.  So what do you see?  Well many would say the first few episodes are the best and I would agree completely but I will get back to that.  What you see is repeated slightly different instances of teen angst; most noticeable is the theme of feeling like you don't fit in, suburban kids that love rap music, self-doubting.  But all disguised as complete insanity.  So much so that people claim the show is about nothing when I feel like that couldn't be further from the truth!  For me the most insightful sketch is about 2 jars of peanut butter, one is in love with the jelly, the other which is ""chunky"" is left out with no one to love him.  Andy tells the chunky peanut butter that he knows someone that can teach the pb how to dance, and introduces him to salsa.  They fall in love and are happy together.  Now for some people they have just witness complete and total absurdity.  For me he is acting out his angst, he is the chunky peanut butter than no one will love.  Why? Well because as we may or may not all know he is in fact 30 years old.  He has a medical condition that prohibits him from growing tall or as society has taught him, growing up.  This is his way of fitting in, to act like a 5th grader.  But does he think he is funny, frankly no, and some of his sketches say that specifically, notable the one where he is doing pancake face and Larry comes in borrows something and tells him pancake face is stupid, and that's the whole sketch.  Another good sketch has Andy go into a bird shop where he and an employee speak in a bird language to each other, then a third man comes in and speaks  bird and is accosted by a cooked chicken, then to spike the point he goes outside and says ""I just wanted to fit in"" and fly's away.  Andy just wants to fit in but is stuck at the very age when that is impossible, to big to be a little kid, and not old enough to be an adult.  A great show to read into for sure but some of the bad points are as follows.  His ideals that flourish in the first few episodes that I already pointed out, seem to diminish quickly and it seems to me like the other writers or producers only saw the absurdist comedy and attempted to recreate it but left out the deeper meaning, possibly not knowing they existed, at least at a subconscious level.  Another bad spot is we see some of the same sketches redone, like the ones with rappers are always coming in and out of the TV, while I suppose one could argue it's relating the fact that TV is your connection to famous people, I'm a little hesitant to want to watch it over and over and over.  It is possible the show said all it really had to say in the first few episodes.  Also Andy has made the bad choice of playing a character that is himself younger than he really is, while he may be a ""weird dude"", he has a more mature side and he is almost insuring he will not work much after the show.  I wish him the best of luck.  I love the episodes that are good and I think the show appeals to a young crowd mostly because they can relate to teen angst and absurd comedy, and the love of rap music.  I most certainly endorse the buying of this season which I have done already.  If anyone would like to discuss the show feel free to email me at BanditT76@aol.com",1143504000,,3631,4.15307582260372

2473606,5,B000CSUNJ8,"MTV has not had anything this great on for years. The Andy Milonakis show is ingenious. Personally, I would have to say there has never been a more amazing show since Pee Wee's Playhouse. Andy Milonakis is pure genious. His humor is quite unique, not for everyone. It is childish in nature, but is actually very superior at the same time. He makes the most ridiculous things funnier than hell. It's like a live action cartoon, Andy can make anything happen. There are no boundaries to his humor. He bends the most mundane things into the craziest comical material ever. He makes you a kid again. If you are into adult/vulgar comedy, like Family Guy, Simpsons, South Park, etc., you may not appreciate this sort of humor. However, if you like ridiculous or zany humor, this is for you. Come on, Snoop Dogg appears in an episode. Very funny.

And for those who do not know, The Andy Milonakis Show is head written by the master mind who also helped write South Park, Crank Yankers, The Man Show and That's My Bush, Jonathan Kimmel.",1139788800,8,1029,4.592391304347826

Want to know what's worse than someone who isn't funny? Someone who isn't funny but THINKS they're funny - and being given a TV show to prove it.

Whilst some would pretend to call this show ""off-beat"" and ""irrelevant"" and then blaspheme and try and mention it in the same sentence as, say, Monty Python, what other shows of this nature (obscure, wacky, ""zany"", for want of a better word) have that this program doesn't is someone funny starring in it. Oh, and funny people writing it. They seem to have forgotten that in this.

So, we have fat boy Andy doing totally, like, outrageous things dude, along with funny music (because what we are watching is funny, see?) He annoys strangers! He wastes peoples time! He shouts a lot! Hey, aren't you rolling around on the floor yet either?

Do you know what the ONLY funny thing is? Andy Milonakis himself. You see, he'd like all you MTV watching kids out there to believe that he's just like you, some goofball kid of 14. But he's not - he's 30, with a growth defect. Now, I'm no expert on comedy, but THAT, my friends, is funny.

Not sure if this garbage is getting another series or not (the first deservedly tanked) but if it does hopefully we'll see Andy's growth defect go full scale, going past the 14 year old boy look right back to toddler age and then finally obliterating him from this earth.

8102043,4,B000CSUNJ8,"Andy Milonakis and his team should be commended for their unique spin on comedy. The premise of which is certainly avante-garde in form while also being subtly sophisticated in it's attitude. Marketed mostly to children, the guise of innocence is there but the real target audience is for adult viewers, not necessarily ones who are stoned to their eyebrows, which may be the case for most irregardless, but the parents too, along with their children may find a silly appreciation for the machinations of humor done-up by TeamAndy. Take for example, the skits that involve domesticated stuff / objects you find around the home, what's he's doing is, is that he's culture-hacking household items with themes found elsewhere in life that aren't necessarily related to one another, which can really make your head spin.
I can sum things up by saying that there is a certain kind of ""jeet-kun do"" to his process it seems, for which the proverb goes, ""throw away convention and learn to totally express yourself freely without constraints"". Exactly. Whereby, within the tiny confines of his New York apartment and neighborhood, Andy and his team of neighbors and friends along with his Oz-like producers do just that -- and some.",1426809600,,1224,5.004901960784314
