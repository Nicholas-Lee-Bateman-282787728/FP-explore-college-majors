It's still funny, but it's just good for wasting extra time with.  The humor in this movie is probably out dated and would be found funny mostly by HK movie veterans.  I still recommend it if you want to see some really dumb funny Chinese flicks.  If you want really good Chinese comedy, I recommend Stephen Chow movies.  If you want Chinese comedy with a horror twist, I recommend the ""Mr. Vampire"" movies.  **Choi Keen**",1062547200,,594,4.435185185185185
