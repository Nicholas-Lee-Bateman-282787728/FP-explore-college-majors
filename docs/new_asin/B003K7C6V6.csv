Would be great to have all 48 editions!  Great yo be able to buy a DVD about it.",1384560000,,255,4.704545454545454
8398695,4,B003K7C6V6,"Unless you are a writer and read about the recent history of writing, you may not find this dvd very interesting. The program does accurately portray the depression and the unfortunate circumstances that many found themselves in. It does raise the question of whether the government should have been in the business of expanding into this area and also that the program did not have a defined role or adequate reason for being other than to provide jobs. There was no goal other than that. But, some good things did come out of it and this seems to be an accurate DVD that does not choose one side or the other...It just tells us what happened and why...You make up you own mind about the adviseability of the government having this program. It helps complete a section on my shelf about the depression and gives me a fuller picture. I found it quite interesting.",1369699200,2,863,4.6103896103896105
