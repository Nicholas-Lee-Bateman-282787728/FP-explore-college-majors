8601519,3,B00E5N8QVS,"Featuring some of my favorite Fox stars, Sweet and Low-Down is a fairly ""B"" musical with a plot concerning a musician from the poor side of Chicago that gets a break at the big time with the King of Swing, Benny Goodman. Linda Darnell, Lynn Bari and Jack Oakie are true favorites of mine and Benny Goodman' Orchestra was, at the time, the most popular band in the country.  Goodman's band (and Harry James's) probably made more films than any others in the Big Band era.

Had this film been made at an other time (i.e. before or after 1944), the leading man most likely would've been John Payne, George Montgomery or Victor Mature - all of whom excelled in those ""lovable heel and handsome guy"" roles at Fox.  But alas, these fellas were all in the service in 1944 and Fox was extremely short of leading man material. So, in this film, they cast an also-ran, James Cardwell, a real clinker (in my opinion) who is neither handsome, charming nor in any way warrants the attentions of Darnell or Bari. He's the reason why I gave this film only 3 stars. I just couldn't see why these two women would even be remotely interested in this guy, let alone chase him around throughout the film.

Also, Lynn Bari has a different singing voice than she did in Sun Valley Serenade (still not on DVD) and Orchestra Wives. In these two films, her singing voice was Pat Friday, whose singing voice matched Lynn Bari's speaking voice better than the singing voice in this film.

Like all of the DVDs in the Fox Cinema Archives series, this is strictly bare bones: no chapters, no fancy inserts, no extras of any kind - just the movie.",1389398400,7,1617,4.48639455782313
