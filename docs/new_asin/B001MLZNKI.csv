3698019,5,B001MLZNKI,"I was a little surprised by the lukewarm reception to The Lodger. It is so far above any modern-day Ripper film, it definitely deserves a look.

I haven't seen the 1940s film, but I have seen - many times - the Hitchcock 1926 silent film. I felt the echoes of it throughout the remake. As a fan of Hitchcock, I found it pretty cool that the directors didn't muck it up like so many do when they try to contrive Hitchcock-like scenes.

Simon Baker is perfectly cast as The Lodger. He looks a bit younger with dark hair and has this secretive way about him that lends mystery to the character.

Frankly, I didn't pay much attention to the shenanigans of the PD, which seemed to be a turn off for other viewers, according to reviews here. Let's face it: This is a PR nightmare for the department, so someone needs to hang for it - and that just happens to be Alfred Molina's character. It works well into this film and casts a glare of suspicion on officers who may or may not be the killer.

Overall, The Lodger remake keeps you slightly off-balance while trying to guess the whodunit. Most, I think, won't know who it is until the very last frame.",1237075200,23,1146,4.341121495327103
3698020,3,B001MLZNKI,"A string of movies has been made from Marie Lowndes 1913 book, ""The Lodger,"" starting in the silent era. The theme of an unsuspecting landlady renting a room to Jack the Ripper is an irresistible one. This latest version has a few interesting twists to offer. It centers around the investigation of a series of murders that the police begin to believe must be the work of some copy-cat Jack recreating the Ripper's murders in modern-day LA.

The film has some bad lighting and plays a little too indistinct and smudgy on the TV screen. However, the Director's occasional use of speeded-up, cut-frame action is more interesting. The technique briefly recalls the way silent movies, made closer to the time when the real Jack the Ripper prowled, have usually looked during modern viewings. It also frighteningly suggests someone's fragmented, demented slashing with a knife.

But some of the acting/directing is less inspired. Alfred Molina seems miscast as the detective and often lumbers the action with histrionics. The conflicts he has with his superior are overwhelmingly clichd. (Hasn't any police commander seen enough film to know that a maverick detective's instincts should always be trusted?) Here the conflict between Molina and his superior is so dragged-in-by-the-ears, so over-the-top - it verges on the comical. During their contrived fulminations, Philip Baker Hall almost seems to be reprising his hilarious turn as that library detective on ""Seinfeld"" who comes after ""Joyboy"" Jerry for a book that's decades overdue.

Offsetting these hackneyed characterizations is Simon Baker's seductively mysterious portrayal of the lodger, and Hope Davis' complex, intriguing portrayal of a housewife adrift in her unsatisfying life. However, if you have the time or inclination to watch only one or two of the movies based on the Lowndes' book,"" I suggest you check out Laird Cregar's classic 1940's ""The Lodger"" and what is in effect its companion piece, ""Hangover Square.""",1237075200,5,1981,5.282539682539682
3698021,3,B001MLZNKI,"The classic novel inspired by the Ripper murders gets an update and a change of venue.  The focus alternates between intriguing scenes between Simon Baker in the title role and Hope Davis, and standard cop fare with a miscast Alfred Molina as a Hollywood cop teamed with his callow partner.  They're working the Ripper angle of a spat of Hollywood killings and note such ""little known"" lore about the original crimes as the fact that Jack The Ripper was never caught.  Um...okay.  The picture's really well shot, but there are some pretentious touches of classical music playing during the murders.  The final scenes though are suspenseful and at least you don't see the resolution coming from a mile off.  I just wish the picture had focused more on the Davis-Baker relationship, as the two stars are quite good.",1234656000,6,813,4.855072463768116
3698022,3,B001MLZNKI,"David Ondaatje directed this update of the 1926 Hitchcock film.  Alfred Molina plays the lead detective Chandler Manning.  Everything is going wrong for this guy.  His wife's crazy; and maybe he drove her there.  His daughter doesn't like him much.  He thinks his partner is gay, which doesn't please him.  To top it off, he botched evidence on his last really big case.  While we're caught in Manning's downhill spiral, his partner Street is played by heartthrob Shane West.  Street is new on the job, has enthusiasm and thoroughly upsets his partner.  Manning's daughter Amanda is played by the lovely Rachael Leigh Cook.  She does a good job in her brief screen time, making us relate to dysfunctional family moments.  Police Captain Smith is played by Philip Baker Hall as a grizzly old bear who snarls through his scenes on screen.  Interwoven with this story is a family where the father Bunting is played by Donal Logue.  Bunting is always leaving the house and seems particularly unsupportive of his wife Ellen.  Ellen is played by Hope Davis.  We're never sure of what the reality is here.  She rents the room and seems to have a wad full of cash to show for it, but maybe not.  Malcolm is the lodger played by Simon Baker.  The good looking star creates an air of mystery combined with zigzag emotions.  The film left me scratching my head, not quite sure of what I'd just seen.  So I wished for a bit more clarity.  There are some nice moments in the film.  Overall, it was an average cinematic experience.  Enjoy!",1234483200,4,1525,4.650375939849624
3698023,3,B001MLZNKI,"In watching the docu on the DVD I felt using the director's words could best sum up their mission; visually compelling. An incredible B movie feel with several A list actors, the Lodger relays a modern retelling of a Jack the Ripper story taking place in LA.

The film crams together many annals of material into a couple short hours with plenty of JtR references and parallels. Molina, West and Hope give some convincing performances, and I suppose any die hard JtR fan will watch this anyway, but I find that most people will likely be bored with all of the material being left out or not explained. Technically, the crew made a fun film, filled with plenty of unique camera shots, fast forward footage, rapid close ups of Ripper memorabilia, etc.

The DVD has several minutes of deleted scenes, and a 20 minute docu on the production. Nothing new there, but maybe this will provide a brief filler for those customers always looking for that decent suspense thriller on a smaller budget. The 20 day shoot made for plenty of bad shots (heavy rain and fake thunder with clear blue skies in the background, pointless character fills, 10-15 untouched plot points that leave you asking why did they introduce them, Alfred Molina looking disinterested throughout the film, etc.). The fact that Molina and Davis have worked together before did not show through at all in this piece, so I would say skip it for their time, but maybe watch if you need your JtR fix.",1234310400,3,1458,4.69140625
3698024,3,B001MLZNKI,"As I was watching, I enjoyed it, but the more distance I get from it, the less memorable it becomes. At one point Malcolm tells Ellen, ""I'm not particular ... about food."" If you're not too particular either, then it could be just the light taste of Ripper mayhem that you've been craving since being sucked in by the disappointingly unsatisfying From Hell and other similar fare. Otherwise, you may want to give it a pass.

3698027,4,B001MLZNKI,"In the special features included on the DVD of the 2008 version of Marie Belloc Lowndes' 1913 novel the point is strongly made that the producers/director took great pains to make this new movie 'faithful to the original novel', by implication suggesting that Alfred Hitchcock had not done so in his 1927 silent movie.  I own copies of each of the three 'versions' of this tale inspired by Jack the Ripper and I'm here to tell you that neither of the movie versions demonstrated complete faithfulness to Ms. Lowndes' book.  To illustrate I must act as a spoiler here, so be advised.  BEGINNING OF SPOILER SECTION.

Hitchcock followed Lowndes' script for most of his movie, only veering off in the final scenes.  The elderly Buntings and their daughter (actually only his daughter, Mrs. Bunting being his second wife though leaving that part of it out of a silent movie makes sense) were nicely portrayed as humble serving people who were a bit down on their luck at the story's opening and who were then happy to receive the lodger as his rent money pulled their fat out of the fire, so to speak.  And Joe, the young cop with his eye on the lovely Daisy Bunting, was portrayed nicely as a well-meaning bumbler of sorts.  But as things heat up Hitch begins to depart from Lowndes' script, giving Daisy a much larger role and having her grow increasingly fond of the lodger, Mr. Sleuth.  And in the end Hitch just threw the book out the window, making the lodger not Lowndes' arch criminal who'd been convicted of earlier crimes, sent to an insane asylum, and later escaped, coping a payroll in the bargain to finance his further ""avenging"" murders; but rather a misunderstood gentleman on the trail of the avenger after his own sister's murder, who in the end gathers all three Buntings into a more comfortable life and leaves hapless Joe in their dust.

But if Hitch can be accused of tying his movie off with pink ribbons David Ondaatje, does not deserve applause for ""faithfullness"".  To begin with moving the setting from fog-shrouded London to rainy West Hollywood is questionable through not egregious.  Much is made in the 'making of' feature about the importance of lighting and so forth to help maintain the noir mood, but those efforts would not have been needed if the story had remained in London's foggy, sooty streets.  Then we meet the four principle characters of Lowndes' novel and it's like a slap in the face with a wet towel.  The old couple trying to keep things together in retirement are replaced by a young couple, the husband (Donal Logue) a security guard and the wife (Hope Davis) an unspecified ""housewife"".  The character of Joe gets a complete make-over as the great Alfred Molina is brought in, and we meet a cop who is hardly a young man, has massive troubles of his own, including a wife who's gone over the edge and a daughter who hates him and apparently replaces Daisy Bunting in the ingnue role.  Davis turns Mrs. Buntings 'dark suspicions' into hallucinations involving everything from murder to a mad affair with the handsome young lodger.  Phillip Baker Hall does a cameo as a police official who gives Joe a lot of grief but he's not allowed to play the role Lowndes created, of being the man whom the lodger almost bumps into in the wax museum, sending him flying from the London neighborhood for fear of being recognized.  The only 'faith' Ondaatje displays is keeping the lodger a man of mystery who fades into the night and goes off elsewhere (in this case Santa Monica) to continue his murderous ways.

END OF SPOILER SECTION.  To sum up I feel all three 'versions', the original novel, Hitchcock's 1927 movie, and Ondaatje's 2008 movie are worth the price of admission, if one doesn't go into them expecting the same story.  Treat them as three different pieces, each inspired by Jack the Ripper, and enjoy the thrills that each 'author' creates in his/her own way.",1433635200,4,3911,4.706744868035191

3698032,3,B001MLZNKI,"This thriller sure tries hard.  It has a Hitchcockian feel -- note the music and camera angles at certain points -- and it also seems to give a nod to David Lynch -- check out the clock on the wall while the gal waits impatiently for that clock to strike 9:30.  Presumably A.M.  But when it comes to film, you rarely should give an A for effort.

I'm giving nothing away when I say that there may or may not be a copycat killer loose in Hollywood, a copycat of Jack the Ripper.  ""Jack's Back,"" you might say in a sing-song voice.  Hasn't this idea been tossed out before?  Let me see. . . .  Oh, that's right!  There was a 1988 film featuring James Spader called, let's see. . . . ""Jack's Back""!  That's where I remember this idea from!  So I guess while this film is about a copycat, this film might be called somewhat of a copycat itself.

But this film does start out fairly strong, and while watching the first act I thought, ""This might be interesting.""  But then they make a tragic mistake in the screenplay department:  the coroner tells the lead detective on the murder case that the killer is mirroring the murders of Jack the Ripper, from over a century before.  So far so good.  But what I couldn't buy:  the detective, in a press conference immediately afterwards, admits publicly that the current killer's MO exactly matches Jack the Ripper's murders!

No. . . stinkin'. . . way!  And when I say, ""stinkin'"" you know I mean something else.  In real life, the cops would ""hold back"" this information.  Why?  Well, if you use your head you would realize that the cops wouldn't want to create a copycat of a copycat.  And also, the cops would hide this information from the media so that those cops could use it later, when they catch a suspect, to use that against that suspect during interrogation.  I'm usually not too uptight about plot elements in films having to exactly mirror what people would do in real life, but this plot element is essential; it is so unlikely that it might make you want to stop watching immediately.

Also, as you probably are now familiar, there is no longer freedom of speech in America.  The First Amendment has been trampled.  But in here, the lead detective harasses his underling by implying that the underling has an ""alternative lifestyle"" (I can't say what that lead detective really says, of course, since we no longer have freedom of speech.)  That lead detective better watch out; otherwise he just might go the way of the guy from ""Duck Dynasty"" if he's not careful.

I would say that the errors occurred way back in the writing of the screenplay.  The writer, for some reason, decided to butcher the Jack the Ripper story.  Or at least a copycat version of it.",1387411200,,2715,4.49079754601227

3698037,5,B001MLZNKI,"I have watched this DVD about five times so far and still find it absolutely compelling. It is presented as a mystery as to who the serial killer emulating Jack the Ripper really is. Given the ending, it had to be the Lodger, played by Simon Baker, although exactly how the landlady fit in is still unclear. Baker plays the role of the Lodger brilliantly. Just the right amount of detachment to be mysterious, combined with a sweet charm that makes it almost impossible to think he is a serial killer. Yet that darkness is there, very subtle, very indicative of an underlying madness that matches the overt mental instability of the landlady. I loved the part where he took down all the paintings of women in his room that were done by the landlord's mother. ""They're watching me. Their eyes keep following me. Everywhere."" (Then, apologetically) ""It's a bit unnerving."" Well, yes, since he was killing so many women, he would think that. Wonderful performances by all the actors.",1317168000,,980,4.770588235294118

3698039,4,B001MLZNKI,"When a series of gorily murdered prostitutes is found in West Hollywood, PD detective and Jack the Ripper expert Charlie Manning is hot on the case.  Charlie is a mess; his wife has attempted suicide and his daughter won't talk to him, but he soldiers on, spurred by the wrongful execution of the man who was tried for similar murders a couple of years before.  Scenes of the police investigation are interwoven with dreamy scenes of a financially strapped couple who rent a room to a mysterious man.  Malcolm the lodger, played by the inimitable Simon Baker, only interacts with the wife and it's evident she has some psychological problems.

As more and more similarities between the West Hollywood murders and Jack the Ripper's spree are uncovered, the press is demanding an explanation for the failure of the police to find the killer.  Charlie Manning becomes the sacrificial lamb for the department, though he's presented the powers that be with plenty of ammunition. In the meantime, Maloolm has taken to nighttime excursions, observed by the increasingly fascinated Ellen Bunting.

While The Lodger has some rough edges, it's a taut, well done thriller that keeps even the most jaded viewer guessing until the end.  Though the crime is solved, the ending leaves a question and a delicious chill.",1301875200,3,1303,4.976958525345622

Did she do it? Was it her? What did the husband say in the Detective's ear? Was simon baker character really real? WTH?!

Still I enjoyed myself and didn't feel I wasn't my two hours of my life. It had me guessing all the way to the end.

I even started to suspect the detective.",1292976000,,497,4.092783505154639
3698041,4,B001MLZNKI,"I bought this as I am a Simon Baker fan and love who dunnits.  Although named The Lodger, it is about a woman slipping into darkness and her relationships with the people around her, including the mysterious stranger who arrives to rent a guest room in back of the house.  The plot is suspenseful and intriguing - one doesn't have a clue who the killer is until the last frame of the movie - literally.  I  wish a little more time had been spent on the developing relationship between the Lodger and Landlord; it would have increased my interest and rounded out characters a bit more.

I found it distracting in the ""rain"" sequences to see rain pouring onto the actors with not one drop falling into the rain puddles on the sidewalk just in front of the actors.  Then the rainbows of color in the incredibly bright background (its supposed to be raining) as the door is opened to see the first glimpse of The Lodger.  Same for when they are walking towards the back house - Loads of sun casting shadows as water is aimed at the actors (raining with the sun brightly shining??).  Just annoying details that could have been easily rectified with a few sprinkles of better placed water.  Those details expose lack of attention to detail and/or very tight budget.

I have also read books on Jack the Ripper.  Anyone who knows much of the MO of the Ripper knows facts that were lost on the scriptwriters.  Again, annoying little details that weren't protrayed accurately in the film and detracted from my viewing of the movie.  I am not a detail person but I think these issues could have been resolved with a little time spent in simple research on the subject.

Overall though, this was an interesting film that left one wondering until the very last frame (literally).  Good job!",1256256000,,1777,4.579113924050633
3698042,4,B001MLZNKI,"""The Lodger"", orginally a novel about the identity of Jack the Ripper, the 19th century serial killer who terorized London prostitutes and was never caught, has been done as a play and now several times as a movie.  This latest version features a strong cast in a darkly atmospheric thriller heavy on Ripperology and loaded with suspects.

The movie opens on a rainy night in West Hollywood.  A senior detective is summoned to the scene of the horrifying murder of a prostitute.  As he and his rookie partner investigate this crime and a second similar murder, the parallels with the crimes of an earlier serial killer, just executed, and with the Jack the Ripper case become painfully apparent.

Elsewhere in West Hollywood, a financially strapped couple rent a room to a mysterious young man who pays cash in advance and insists on complete privacy.  Ellen, the wife, interacts with the lodger.  She may be mentally disturbed and we are never quite certain whether the portions of the movie we experience through her eyes are real or the product of her troubled imagination.

As the movie spins rapidly to its climax, the audience is presented with a confusing array of clues that cleverly keep all the potential suspects in play to the peneultimate scene.  The plot is further muddied by the possibility that one or more of the suspects may have been set up by the real killer.  The senior detective (Alfred Molina) is troubled by family issues and obcessed with the Ripper murders.  The landlords Joe and Ellen Bunting (Donal Logue and a superbly haunting Hope Davis) cannot entirely account for their whereabouts.  The mysterious lodger (an enigmatic, dark-haired Simon Baker) is almost too obvious a suspect.  Even the rookie partner (Shane West) is not what he claims to be.

For such a promising premise and an excellent cast, the movie never quite hits its stride as a thriller.  The drab production values seem more suited to a TV movie, while a polemic about capital punishment and an internal investigation into the senior detective seem awkward and stagey.  Nevertheless, ""The Lodger"" largely succeeds as suspense and is highly recommended as worthwile entertainment for its brief (95 minutes) running time.",1246579200,3,2220,4.975609756097561
