7844928,3,6303388000,"SPACE WARRIORS BALDIOS (1981) is a tightly paced, action-packed and surprisingly well-designed Japanese animated space sci-fi feature. Most of the animation was originally done for TV so the character movement is stiffer and much of the character design simpler than normal for a theatrical animated release. However the technical design is quite sharp, as seen in a breathtaking array of space battles, invasions of Earth, and scenes of mass destruction that are quite spectacular.
The plot has to do with a young pilot, Marlon, who flees the polluted planet S-1 to go to Earth but is soon followed by the S-1 fleet which seeks to wipe out the Earth population to make room for S-1's people. Joining Earth's defense force, Marlon pilots the robotic flying combat vehicle, the Baldios (which bears a suspicious resemblance to ""Mobile Suit Gundam""'s title vehicle), and scores some victories, although his loyalty to Earth is constantly called into question.
Marlon has some semi-romantic interludes with his love-hate counterpart on S-1, the beautiful Aphrodia, with whom he shares a love of the blue sea, and they spend moments together at broad intervals gazing at the lovingly animated rolling waves. Overall, it's well-written and consistently gripping and boasts the kind of 1970s-style hand-drawn space animation that many fans have come to prefer over the CGI and digital animation that predominates today.
The U.S. dub is 98 minutes, making it 19 minutes shorter than the Japanese version. Violence has been cut, some of the battle scenes seem shortened and it's a safe bet several important dialogue scenes are gone as well. The English dub is about average. A new release of this in a dual-language DVD in its complete version would be most welcome.",1027728000,4,1759,5.153846153846154
