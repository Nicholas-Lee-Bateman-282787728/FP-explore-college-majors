3915541,1,B002E5D5JW,"I wouldn't recommend this to anyone unless you have nothing better to do. Obviously I didn't and it was definitely a waste of time. A predictable plot and so, so acting.",1417305600,,169,4.483870967741935
3915542,1,B002E5D5JW,Absolutely ridiculous. Didn't even watch the entire movie,1412380800,,57,6.25
3915543,1,B002E5D5JW,No one should ever watch this movie. Ever. Take a nap instead.,1411862400,,62,4.25
3915544,2,B002E5D5JW,The first part of the movie offers insight into sales practices for which every consumer should be on the lookout. Then turn it off and save a couple of precious hours doing something else.,1361923200,,189,4.588235294117647
3915545,5,B002E5D5JW,"I thought that this movie was very funny and the picture quality was fantastic.
Pick this one up and you won't go wrong.",1254268800,2,120,4.260869565217392
3915546,5,B002E5D5JW,"Yes it is independent so not Million dollar polished but Is far funnier than some of the Big money fluff pieces (I'm looking at you Will F. and Jack B.).

This is very Married With Childrenesk I would love to see it made into a sitcom.",1252022400,4,235,4.108695652173913
8366826,3,B002E5D5JW,"Okay movie, good to watch on a rainy day at the beach.
Okay music, nothing really memorable, but it is music.
Okay storyline, not sure it's worth a remake but it could be a okay movie for fresh new faces or comic actors.
One good thing about this movie - it's not bad.",1491264000,,268,4.0754716981132075

8366831,3,B002E5D5JW,"This had all appearances of a low budget movie.  It is based on the antics at a small, used boat dealership.  Those in sales would probably appreciate it more due to all the phony promises the salesmen make to move inventory.  They are purchasing used boats and selling them without going over them.  Despite the cover, there is not much water in the movie as everything takes takes at the off-water sales lot.  Three stars is pushing it and I would have preferred 2 1/2.  Why? Well, the plot actually held me to the end of the movie so it is not that bad. But, limited scenery and it really does not have a great script.",1466899200,,621,4.310344827586207
8366832,4,B002E5D5JW,"Reminds me of a classic movie called ""Used Cars"" Great Sales type of movie.",1466035200,,75,4.428571428571429
8366833,4,B002E5D5JW,If you have ever been in sales this is hilarious or at least the fist 3 quarters of the move is. The end is a bit over the top. If you don't understand sales it might not be as funny.,1465516800,,183,3.6
