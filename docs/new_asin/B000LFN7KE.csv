8161896,5,B000LFN7KE,"This is a very informative video from a master drummer with scarey technical ability and clean and crisp performance experience. The section on tuning drums is very informative and the exercises on technique come from a man who knows the subject and can back it up with amazing facility. The drum solo which incorporates much of his technical skills and ability to swing is a lesson alone. Roy Burns rates as one of the great drummers of all time having played with Benny Goodman (a tough and difficult task master and leader) plus others and leader of his own big band in conjuction with Dick Grove. I recommend this VHS even tough it is now rare and I am pleased I  finally have mine. I first saw Roy Burns play as  part of his clinic tour back in the late 1970's and I never forgot his dazzling speed and the finesse of his touch. This is a valuable piece of material for the serious drummer who is genuinely interested in learning to play with correct technique, touch and facility. I am an unashamed Roy Burns fan who will alway have respect and regard for a man who really new what to do and how to do it. Roy Burns can be mentioned in the same sentence as Buddy Rich and Louie Bellson for his abilities. Should you see this Roy, thanks for the years of inspiration and memories of your visits to Sydney Australia.",1317513600,,1320,4.405737704918033
