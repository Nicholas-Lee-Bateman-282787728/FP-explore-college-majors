7822935,1,630217998X,I was not pleased with this movie. It was jerky and a bad attempt at some sort of bizarre film noir. Everything about this movie was hideous. Too much time wasted on long scenes where the characters just sat or laid around. This movie told me nothing about Frances Farmer. This movie sucks big time! I regret the purchase of this movie.

7822936,1,630217998X,"The first thing to note is that this film does not feature the real Frances Farmer as the video info states. Rather it is a biopic which makes the 1982 version with Jessica Lange look like a masterpiece.  As Frances,  Sheila McLaughlin is abysmal. In some scenes she's not even blonde! And she  looks more like Piper Laurie than Frances Farmer, who was petite and  luminously beautiful.  The film offers no greater insight into Frances than  the Lange version, in spite of the publicists claim, and the direction is  heavy-handed and humourless. A lot of the time it reads like a bad play  with hardly any character interaction or drama. There is even some  pseudo-Bergman touches which are almost laughable.  In spite of the scant  Frances Farmer titles available on video, a viewing of Come and Get It or  Toast of New York is preferable to this disaster.",957052800,10,857,4.716216216216216
