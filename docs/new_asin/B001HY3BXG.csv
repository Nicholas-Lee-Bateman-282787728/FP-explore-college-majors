8339406,5,B001HY3BXG,"The Last Pogo documents the night of the very last punk show at Toronto's Horseshoe Tavern in 1978. The Horseshoe was a decadent country & western honky-tonk, where from open until close, professional alcoholics drank redeye.. [a beer & tomato juice concoction], chain-smoking cigarettes.. it was the kind of bar that scares the pants off innocent kids walking by who spot the zombies inside..  Surrounded and isolated by a growing Queen Street West punk scene, the Horseshoe music stage took a brief shot at being a hardcore punk venue.. they had no idea what they were in for.. This raucus, giddy, independant film release is juvenile, moronic, distasteful, senseless, flawed, and violent.. it takes you there, and ends..  leaving you wanting more.  I went to high school with film maker Colin Brunton.. even then, as a teenager, he was a big city movie theater manager..  Colin was instrumental in bringing some of the rawest, vile and disturbing cult films to top tier Toronto art flick cinema screens.. Sound recordist Bob Stanton, (an accomplished bassist), was a classmate, and later played in my road band.. our high school German teacher noticed our talent first day of class.. [hysterical red-faced lady with thick german accent ]: ""You, you.. you creatures.. go..  and sit at the back of the classroom.. and stay there!"" If you have a live music DVD collection, add this rare film, it's a gem.

The bands are:
Cardboard Brains
The Mods
The Scenics
The Secrets
The Viletones
The Ugly
