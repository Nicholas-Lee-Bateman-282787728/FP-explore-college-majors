2600220,5,B000G6BL60,"It is absurd to compare this movie to the first one, as the former is a giant studio movie and this is, at his heart and in its budgeting, a small indie.  But what writer/director  James Dodson manages to do with so little money is fairly astounding.  First of all, it's prescient as hell, as he predicted months ago what is happening today in North Korea.  Second,  he manages to create Korean characters who are not mere cartoon villains, as Hollywood so often depicts them. but flesh and blood.  And third, it's exciting, intelligent, heartfelt, and, in the end, packs a fierce moral punch.",1161475200,9,593,4.653846153846154
2600221,2,B000G6BL60,"I wasn't totally disappointed in this movie.  I guess the ""timliness"" of the plot kept my interest longer.  The previously reviewed camera shaking complaints were also noticeable by me and and bothersome.  However, I was more troubled by the color.  It seemed, in order to separate the different plot themes, there was a different color tint in the filmed segments.  The political powers all had more of a yellow tint, the scenes in North Korea had more of a blue/darker tint, etc.  Maybe my machine was just farting, but, this was aggravating.  Did anyone else notice this???

Truthfully, you get what you paid for.  I should have rented this one.",1161388800,3,648,4.818181818181818
2600222,1,B000G6BL60,"This is a good example of how bad a movie can be,what a terrible sequel to a good movie in the first behind enemy lines.",1161216000,5,120,3.84
2600223,2,B000G6BL60,"I enjoyed the first film Behind Enemy Lines, but as normally goes this was a far cry from the first. Even when you disassociate the first from it. I'm really not sure to much on the story line it seemed a little washed out from the beginning, yet I didn't even make it half way through the movie.

My biggest gripe is the filming. I know effects are really nice and can add a lot of suspense and drama, but the camera shaking effect was incredibly overboard. I simply could not watch a majority of the film because it is the first movie ever to give me a headache from the shaking. It reminded me of the pieces I saw from the Blair Witch Project.

Then after having to jump forward I either lost track of or interest in the plot of the movie. There were also way to many flashbacks and it just seemed poorly organized.

My recommendation: Watch on satellite or cable before you buy, and be sure to take some Dramamine first.

(I'm pretty sure it was the filming that was shaking as part of an ""effect"" and not my player, but I'm curious to see if others have the same issue or are bothered by it.)",1161216000,8,1097,4.20952380952381

2600259,3,B000G6BL60,"US satellites discover what seems to be nuclear missiles in North Korea. A team of Navy Seals are sent in to sabotage the missile base, but the mission is aborted at the last minute, but not before a group of Seals have already parachuted out of the plane and are trapped behind enemy lines in North Korea. Meanwhile, the president tries to find the right course of action to avoid the Korean War to be resumed.

Behind Enemy Lines 2 has an interesting premise and some good political intrigue. Its weakness is the bad action scenes. They are filmed with a shaky camera, apparently to give the scenes a more ""realistic"" feeling, but succeeding only in making them hard to follow, and often annoying to watch. Shaking the camera that much doesn't make the action scenes more exciting or suspenseful, just less watchable. And this visual style (shaky camera, spastic editing, occasional weird optic ""effects"") is used not only in action scenes but other scenes as well, especially in the first half of the movie. Halfway through the movie I was annoyed by the movie and thought it would only get a two star rating, but the story became more interesting in the last half, although the bad camerawork continued.

Weak three star rating, would have been much stronger in the hands of a competent director, cameraman and editor.",1238630400,,1322,4.7685589519650655

A previous reviewer was correct in that the bullet scene was excellent and on the mark.

2600263,1,B000G6BL60,"This movie was just utterly horrible. The actors tried way too hard to look tough and the constant service bashing caused be to turn it off. Airborne School is the Army's toughest training? Give me a break. Try The Unit's Selection, the SF's Q-Course, or Ranger School. I couldn't get through half of the movie. If you want a real movie about SEALs, watch Tears of the Sun or even Navy SEALs with Charlie Sheen since that was actually written by a former Navy SEAL. And if you wanna learn what ""clowns"" Delta is, why don't you watch The Unit or read Not a Good Day to Die by Sean Naylor or better yet read Eric Haney's Inside Delta Force and see if you still believe the idiocracy of this movie. Their counter-ambush tactics they employed in this movie would make you think they were friggin weekend warriors. This isn't a B movie. It's a D movie at best.

2600270,5,B000G6BL60,"Or an overlay ---
Any movie that tells of what our Special Ops guys go through is worth watching -- even if the story line is not up to par.

There is not a complainer out there that would last in their shoes. sorry, boots.

This movie shows the emotions and humanity of our guys [not the bad ones] and yes, the one Korean who rescued? our guys turns out to be human after all.
McGill as General Vance led me to believe he was war hungry and determined to have his way.  Coyote [love that name] as president did the General justice.

And the explanations in the commentary I truly believe: The President does not have all that much athority to make a move on his own. Only in times of War.  So we should take a closer look at the men that surround him.

I could follow all the action and the whyfores and surely did not need the [shall I say demented] overlays of the frames that fluttered.  Movement was just too quick.  Seemed like a fill-in.

I enjoyed the actors even though I didn't know them - anyone that has the guts to jump out of a plane at that level has my admiration. [the real men, not the actors] but it was good realism.

Would love to see better quality of our guys exploits - be they Navy, Army, Marines or the undercover Special Ops groups.  How about the SAS, they have some good ones too.

This movie is a personal likes one - will not suit all.  But with understanding comes liking.",1187049600,3,1404,4.1940298507462686
2600271,4,B000G6BL60,"Behind Enemy Lines II: Axis of Evil sheds light (as it should do) on the inhuman Stalinist state of North Korea, a.k.a. the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (the DPRK); a country whose isolationism and harsh policies have led to the deaths of millions of its own citizens and which today continues to threaten peace and stability more than any other country in the world.
A group of Navy SEALs is called upon to parachute behind North Korean lines in order to blow up a nuclear missile site before the DPRK has launching capability.
As the team is in the process of being airdropped behind enemy lines, the mission is aborted, but not before half the team has already jumped off the plane...
The film starts off very well, immediately catching the viewers' attention.
Bruce McGill, Glenn Moreshower (from 24!), Peter Coyote, Keith David, and the rest of the older cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are yet again commendable!  It is the younger actors who are not that wonderful in their respective roles.
More relevant than ever, the movie does a good job as an eye-opener to the darkest regime out there.  The film provides the necessary background as well as an accurate, albeit short description of conditions in the DPRK.
Moreover, it could have been and it should have been much more graphic in showing what is really taking place in North Korea's ""killing fields.""
In short, the setting, the plot, the dialogues, the special effects, and the music are all very good!
Behind Enemy Lines II: Axis of Evil is a film very well written and very well presented, and it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment.",1184544000,,1657,4.830985915492958
2600272,2,B000G6BL60,"Though it is a low-budget, in-name-only sequel to the Gene Hackman / Owen Wilson film made in 2001, ""Behind Enemy Lines 2: Axis of Evil"" has one new and bold idea that is certainly interesting. The newer film tries to employ the standard action flick formula against the recent political and historical background around and since the 1994 framework accord between North Korea and the United States. The film has even a neat twist in the story, which refers to the real-life event in 2004, a mushroom cloud that was allegedly witnessed in North Korea.

The story begins promisingly. It is about the mission of the Navy SEAL team to destroy a missile site found in North Korea. When they start to drop out of an airplane flying over the target area, however, the order to abort the mission arrives.  The order came too late and four soldiers are left `behind enemy's line.' It is contrived, and considering the geography of Korea, jumping from the sky is too risky and highly implausible (going from the sea is much easier), but well, it is still OK.

Unfortunately the film goes downhill from there. The actions themselves are not bad, but they are poorly edited. Many reviewers (including me) are complaining about the shaky camera, but more problematic is the lack of suspense that was felt in the original ""Behind Enemy Lines' or ""BAT 21."" Instead of giving the thrilling scenes of how US military headquarter communicate the isolated SEALS through the radio and other media, it shows us painful tortures, one old `taxi' and a bizarre car accident on the country road. Frankly I still don't see the point of the last two episodes.

The film also shows us the game of international politics in White House with Peter Coyote's US President and Bruce McGill's stereotyped general. During the discussion on the consequences of the attack on North Korea, Ambassador of South Korea shows up, but the names of Japan and China are not mentioned in this film, which is I think very strange.

Unlike other action flicks `like ""Stealth,"" ""Die Another Day"" and, yes, ""Team America: World Police,"" ""Behind Enemy Lines 2: Axis of Evil"" tries to incorporate real on-going events into action film. It's a bold step (especially when North Korea really announced its nuclear test in 2006), but still it must be said the film's story is weak, and actions need better choreography.",1174953600,2,2364,4.827160493827161

Director James Dodson with a limited budget has done wonders with this movie. His cooperation with the writers and actors is laid out extremely well and the total overall effort, I believe is on par with the first movie .

Not every director with a 3 million dollar budget, has been able to give so much integrity and impact without sacrificing artistic merit. This movie is timely because of world politics and it is easily believable - the way Director James Dodson envisions. It is amazing to me when the first review of a movie gets a negative review and some reviewers jump on the band wagon and follow suit .",1161734400,13,764,4.610294117647059

I have seen many directors try this effect before and Director, James Dodson gets it right. This is the first time I have ever felt that a  bullet fired was really going to get ME. I kid you not - right between the eyes! No 3-D effect ever matched this shot in it's intensity. Simply unbeleiveable!

For all of you out there please consider that  this movie had a 3 million budget not 10 million like the first. ""A list"" actors were used in the first, as opposed to lessor well known in the second. BEL2 had only a three million budget AND had a better effect and a better story line!
