7719263,5,B01DLGY3EI,What a great movie. I can't say enough. I thought I would be repulsed by the content but it was told with great care. I will definitely watch it again.,1464566400,,151,4.066666666666666
7719264,5,B01DLGY3EI,What a great film. Craig Jordan is  phenomenal in this role. This movie with tug at your heart strings. Wish I would've gotten 2. I've loan this copy to all my friends.,1464393600,,168,4.25
7719265,5,B01DLGY3EI,"This is a superb film that takes on the subject of incestuous love with maturity and credibility. After a momentary flashback introduction, this movie unfolds with the reuniting of two brothers owing to the death of their mother and her funeral. Only a year apart in age, Steven (the older brother played by Michael E. Pitts) is a medical student away from home attending college in Maryland while his younger brother Nate (played by Craig Jordan) is a trainer in a local fitness center. The two brothers comfort each other both emotionally and by embracing. One senses that there is more to their relationship by their obvious mutual fondness and tenderness. And, sure enough, it turns out that since the ages of 12 and 11 respectively, they began to experiment with each other sexually and this continued to evolve into actual and total love. However, their sense of guilt and (despite both being agnostic/atheistic - thus the title of this film) a concern that their late parents might actually be viewing their sexual activity from some unseen ""heavenly abode"" causes them to make a pledge that they will terminate their relationship and move on. Steven does and is currently involved with Ray, a fellow student studying to be an astrophysicist. Nate, obviously has not, even though he has had admitted intimacy with a fellow trainer named Trent. Steven decides to delay his departure back to Maryland and instead invites Ray to join him at his parents' home. The combination of Ray's appearance on the scene, Nate's undiminished strong feelings for his brother, Steven's residual and continued love for Nate is gripping; and the viewer is transported through a labyrinth of emotional conflict that ultimately leads to an unexpected climax (NO SPOILERS HERE). At most this film should be classified as PG-13; aside from one distant shot of frontal nudity, there is no significant nudity; no F-bomb; one instance of simulated sex. Two interviews, one each
with the two lead actors are very informative. No background music gives the film a ""cinema verite"" effect. A most worthwhile and memorable kind of movie.",1464048000,50,2113,5.022792022792022

7719270,1,B01DLGY3EI,Amateurish and tedious. What could have been a pretty good ten minute short was stretched into an 80 minute slumberfest. How many long shots of an empty kitchen does a film need?

There is all aspects of mental love and physical love from the time of school age to that of young men and their total love between them.  In this story their can be no blanket judgment call, only an empathic sympathy!!  Changes in the culture is the only solution, but it cannot and will not happen over night!!

7719288,1,B01DLGY3EI,"""Godless"" is about the best description for the core issue in this film: incest (and homosexual, at that).  I obviously can't say that such a situation has never occurred in human history, but just because something has happened, or is/is possible, does not intrinsically make it worth coverage by the ""Arts.""  The very fact that the two seem to be unconcerned with the consequences evidences a near complete unbelief of a moral law giver.  Yet, we know that the more taboo a subject, the more enticing it is to our carnal nature.  I'm just not sure much more needed to filmed of the brothers multiple close-contact situations, including a reasonably graphic portrayal of an ""encounter.""  The fact that the younger brother narrates how they started (casual experimentation, not exactly unusual), but then progressed to both of them realizing they had fallen for each other.  That's no longer experimentation, obviously.  I don't know what anyone would get out of this film.",1498176000,,973,5.04375

7719293,4,B01DLGY3EI,"Well, just finished reading all the reviews of this film, and I have come to the conclusion that that there are several POV's regarding its narrative So, with that in mind, I'll add mine. Incest between two males is not a moral perversion as  it is between  a male and a female (pregnancy).But in this case we are told there is never a moral question about their love for each other as they have no religious beliefs ,ergo-no moral judgements!.. However, we are4 also told they are conflicted about it because of their love for their parents. It is for this reason they decided they would end it and move on with their lives. Unfortunately, for Nate, he suffered the loss of his mother, and the loss  of his relationship with Steve (his lover/brother) within a short frame of time, which sent him into a tailspin of depression!
The decision of Steve to console Nate by returning home with his lover, only exacerbated Nate's state of depression,  and also brought to the surface, the love they had for each other! There was a subtle insight (IMHO) about Steve's relationship with Ray as being less intense than Steve's feelings for his brother! There seemed to be a perfontary 'togetherness' between them as aRay always seemed to be on his computer, studying for his PHD and the interaction between them was minimal! However, Steve was the opposite with Nate: he seemed to sense his loss of their relationship as it existed before he went off to college. Every time they were together they both would confess their love for each other as undying and forever!  It even went further, they became intimate  only solidifying  their declaration of love! Now, the narrative that bothers me is when Steve confesses his relationship to Nate to Ray, and Ray gives him an ultimatum to cease their relationship or else he is leaving.  Steve does-which to me is a contradiction of his earlier declarations to Nate! In the real gay world, a love as intense as that between Nate and him would override any ultimatum from a lover with such a callow attitude and give Ray the door! (Note: since this is Steve's first relationship outside of Nate's, in the gay world first time relationships are fragile at best and are susceptible to an early breakup). I blame Steve for not being honest with Ray, in the first place, like Nate was honest with Trent. Steve was in denial-Nate was not. MY POV.",1492387200,4,2375,4.678657074340528
7719294,2,B01DLGY3EI,"Interesting topic - brother/lovers. It could have been an interesting movie, but the characters were weak, the tempo was painfully slow and the dialog was as stiff as cardboard. I managed to watch the whole thing (lie - i did fast-forward through some of the later tediously long static shots) hoping that the characters would present more, uh.. character. For there being only a year age difference between the two brothers, one appeared physically to be about 25, and the other physically and mentally maybe 18, It was only slightly different from most sad, soppy poorly acted gay movies in it's incestuous angle.
2 stars because I watched the whole numbing thing, but it really only deserved 1 star.",1491696000,2,702,4.907563025210084

7719296,2,B01DLGY3EI,"Disappointing, not because it was godless, but because it is soulless.  Slow moving and needing a sharp pair of scissors in the editing room.  The two characters having the least screen time and the being the most interesting were given the least to do.  The one confrontational scene with the brothers and the boyfriend on the couch had all the impact of a marble hitting a pillow.  The writing was sketchy, at best, but the two brothers were fairly game and the guy who played Steven had a real screen presence.  Unfortunately, the other supporting characters added nothing to the story.  Worst of all was the ending, which I won't give away out of respect for those who still insist on watching this.  One major warning - do not be sleepy when you watch this or you will never stay awake long enough to even see the end.  Come to think of it, that might not be a bad idea.",1491609600,,875,4.425

7719298,5,B01DLGY3EI,"Five stars for the courage, confidence to deftly tackle such a challenging subject, and for keeping the characters both human and humane and not turning them into cardboard cut outs and cheap cliches.

My best friend once told me that the important thing:  Is just knowing that someone cares.  That simple  idea has shown up in at least two films I have seen in the Amazon video project.",1490054400,2,387,4.647058823529412
7719299,4,B01DLGY3EI,"There are many good things about GODLESS, but it is marred by its glacial pace, underwritten characters and some of the acting. At its best, it is a study in depression. Nate has been in a funk ever since Steve, the brother he loved emotionally and physically, decided their sexual relationship had to end and went off to college. Nate failed in college, came home to live with his ailing mother and work as a trainer at a gym. His mother's death only makes him more depressed. Steve, a medical student, comes him for the funeral and to help his brother who spend most of his time in bed curled in the fetal position. Nate wants to renew his relationship with Steve, but Steve's lover Ray enters the scene. Nate has an adoring potential partner in co-worker Trent, but he can't get over his love for his brother.
The film doesn't judge or sensationalize the brothers' relationship. There's no grand melodrama. The problem is that only Nate is well written -- and well acted by the very talented Craig Jordan. Steve is either very confused or very poorly conceived. His boyfriend, Ray, has barely been written at all. If he knows what is going on (he listens at door at crucial moments), why doesn't he react?  In avoiding melodrama, the writer and director strain credibility.
As I said, the film is very slow. Long takes on rooms with nothing happening. Long fades to black. Perhaps the director is most interested in mood, but the film needs more tension. Other that Jordan and Garrett Young as Nate's sweet, adoring co-worker, the acting is mediocre. I blalme the director some for that. With such long takes, the actors needed guidance.
Still I give the film four stars for its honest treatment of its subject and the acting of Jordan and Young.",1489881600,4,1749,4.660194174757281
7719300,4,B01DLGY3EI,"The film engaged me beginning to end. I thought the pace appropriate, given the delicate subject matter.  I wonder whether the writers (both with the last name Lim) are brothers, and whether the script was based on their own experience.  The parents' house - in which most of the film takes place - is cramped and colorless, reflecting nicely the peril and strangeness of the brothers' clandestine relationship.  The film appears carefully conceived and very thoughtfully executed.",1489104000,3,481,5.220779220779221
7719301,2,B01DLGY3EI,"An  interesting concept and raises some basic questions about traditional morality.  But  it had a dead quality to it.  The flow was not organic and character reactions to events not realistic (the boyfriend would have run screaming).  Bad script and stiff acting.  Slow  as molasses.  Slow is ok if there is a plot and character development (see Hawaii, Pit  Stop  or North Sea Texas),  but this just crawled and the end was poorly executed. Could have  been a good short film with some  decent dialogue.",1488240000,,505,4.8

Again, the writing and direction presented possibilities but didn't allow me to figure out what was coming until the story told itself. That's pretty skillful film-making. The cast creates believable relationships. All moral judgements aside, I cared what happened to these characters. What may have been lacking in the acting was more than made-up for in on-screen chemistry. It's difficult to judge others when they are likable, real people that we want to understand.

External and internalized judgement, itself, is on trial in this movie.",1484006400,4,674,5.063063063063063

7719317,4,B01DLGY3EI,"This is one very strange and weird movie, but yet it captures the viewers attention because it's a different kind of story. This is actually a 3.5 stars.  The title is Godless because I imagine God would find it horrible that two brothers can be in love beyond the normal brotherly love.  In this movie, it's two brothers truly in love with each other, but struggles with the acceptable norm that two brothers are not supposed to be lovers.  They are well aware of what is right and wrong to society, but can't help themselves as to what is right for them.  They try to normalize themselves by each exploring other lovers outside of their own relationship, but is having a hard time breaking from what they grew up to know, which is how much they care about each other and is not afraid to share that love sexually.  The movie does a nice job showing the mental and emotional struggles between the brothers even though the beginning of the movie is a bit slow in getting to the point.  Maybe the director was trying to show how hard it is for the two brothers to show that they are lovers when their parents were around.  After their parents passed away, the story started to take shape much faster; or the movie was slow at the beginning because the director wanted to show how difficult it is to show that two brothers can be lovers.  Whichever the case, the acting was quite good and their emotional and mental struggles were brought across in this film.",1483401600,,1457,4.471698113207547

Steven has moved on and found a boyfriend, Ray who comes to stay with them.....you can guess what happens. This had potential but for a few things, The dialog is so forced. The acting by all is stilted at best. Not a real emotion among any of them, except the Mom. The story is Murky and there are scenes that just don't seem to fit or seem rational. for instance, Nate listening in at his brothers door then going to his room and taking off all his clothes and pouting??????

7719319,4,B01DLGY3EI,"There are so many long pauses and silences in ""Godless"", you may well wonder what director Joshua Lim is up to. ""Godless"" is an example of ""independent film-making."" Shot in ten days or so, the film contains no musical score. The camera just tracks in for long, extended silent takes. Yet, the silence between the characters tells us a lot about them and their emotional states. I began to wonder if ,:""Godless"" was an ""independent"" film because, certainly, no major  Hollywood studio would touch a ""downer"" storyline about loss, grief and incestuous love (yes, I mean love) between two brothers, and Lim was just doing his best with what he had to work with?
  The long silences are unnerving and jarring-- but they do pull you into the world of despair felt by Nate (Craig Jordan). ""Godless"", we learn, is Nate's ""video confessional"", revealed mostly in flashbacks, as he struggles to deal with the death of his parents and his complex relationship with his brother. Troubled by society's stigma of incest, brother Steven (Michael E. Pitts) has put considerably distance between himself and Nate by going out of state to college. But, after the death of their parents, Steven returns to help Nate during an  extended time of despair. The arrival of Stephen's boyfriend only increases Nate's sense of despair and loss. Steven has moved on, but Nate can't let go. There is another would-be boyfriend patiently waiting for Nate to come out of his despair. But Nate ""letting go"" wasn't exactly the resolution I was hoping for.
  Craig Jordan is excellent as the anguished Nate. For the open-hearted and open-minded viewer, ""Godless"" may well be heartbreaking. The tension between the brothers, and everything they strive to hide, is almost unbearable.",1483315200,3,1749,4.993127147766323

Some may talk a good game of nonconformity, but few achieve it, because secrets, in general, and familial secrets in particular are time bombs waiting to explode. Doesn't really matter what the secrets are, though some have a more powerfully devastating effect than others, secrets force individuals into the shadows and deprive them of light, air and love.

7719336,2,B01DLGY3EI,"This movie's writer/director, Joshua Lim, should have turned this project over to someone more adept at directing. Continual pregnant pauses between sentences may be construed as ""arty"" but are totally unnatural and inflict punishment on both the actors and the audience, Mr. Lim should be forced to watch Howard Hawk's ""His Girl Friday"" on a continuous loop until he understands the way natural dialogue overlaps. Lingering shots of empty rooms, primarily the kitchen, also contribute to the Yawn Factor, since the mother's house is a ""starter"" home at best, with absolutely no architectural features of note. But getting to the story itself, ""Godless"" is mainly a tale of two brothers who have been having an incestuous relationship for years. The older brother, Steven Flanigan (Michael E. Pitts), is a pre-med student in college who is trying to move on and has taken as his lover another student, Ray (Jefferson Rogers). The younger brother, Nate Flanigan (Craig Jordan) is a trainer at a local gym. (And WHY the Irish surname? Seriously, there is nothing remotely Irish about these guys.) When Steven and Nate's mother dies, Steven returns for the funeral and Nate wants to resume where the two of them left off. But Steven puts a stop initially to Nate's advances, especially since Ray will soon be arriving to comfort his partner. Aside from Ray's making the relationship a triangle, a fellow gym trainer, Trent (Garrett Young). is in love with Nate despite being rejected, and thus turns this movie into a strange rectangle of sorts. The major obsession here is on the brothers, mainly Nate, and that's a dramatic plus. But even so, a little more backstory for Ray and Trent would not have been amiss so that the thwarted passions of all the central characters (except perhaps for Steven who seems to have the best of all possible worlds) might have enlisted the sympathies of the audience. Finally, the title of ""Godless"" requires some rethinking, considering the amount of  incest found within. (Examples: Abraham and Sarah are half-brother and sister, Lot had his two daughters, and Adam and Eve's children all had one another.)  Aside from all the above, the actors do the best they possibly can.",1480464000,,2209,5.0

7719340,3,B01DLGY3EI,"""Godless"" is a slow, unevenly acted gay drama that still held my interest. The strong bond between the two brothers comes across despite awkward scripting and direction. The (apparently) extremely low budget may actually be a strength, since the limited set adds an element of stylization that often makes you feel like you're watching a filmed stage production. (Seemed pretty implausible to me that the now-deceased parents would raise two boys without even adding a dishwasher to their cramped old two bedroom home; the mother was a nurse and the father, though it's not made clear, was apparently a teacher. They would have something a little larger. But I guess having the brothers share a bedroom made the relationship easier to write.) The director's script is over-written, and has many unclear elements, but he still delivers some strong, heartfelt scenes. The acting of the older brother (Michael Pitt) holds the film together. The younger brother (Craig Jordan) has a showier role, but his acting is uneven, and he's hampered by too many protracted moping scenes. Question for the director/writer: Were you asleep in Film Writing 101 when they told you never to introduce a gun in the final moments of a movie without some earlier reference or preparation?

It's set at a melancholy moment in the two lead characters lives, just after the loss of a parent. At the same time they're dealing with decision to emotionally distance themselves from each other in a morally questionable relationship. Moral being the question. If there's a God and an afterlife then morality is factor. If there is no God then love should be the only determining factor in their relationship.

7719368,1,B01DLGY3EI,"This is basically a film about mental illness, and not a very good one. A great deal of it doesn't make much sense. Sibling incest is an interesting topic. The grounds for it are usually based in pathology within a family. In this film, its doesn't make any sense as to how both the brothers could have such wonderful feelings about both their parents. While they are presented in a positive fashion, there must have been something wrong with them for both their sons to turn to each other for their primary emotional and sexual relationships.

While the older son moved on and found a relationship outside the family on his own, and the younger one did not, but rather clung to his Mother until her death, it seemed very odd that when the older brother brings back his fiancee to the family home for his Mother's funeral, the boyfriend, even when he learns of the longterm relationship with the two brothers, is way too accepting of it as long as it doesn't continue.

There's lots of things here that don't add up ,and from the way the film is presented, the younger brother following through with his suicide attempt towards the end of the film,would have been an ending that is understandable.

A far better film where the issues of depression, difficulty in love relationships and eventual suicide, done in a way that is understandable is an Australian film called Monster Pies. A much better choice.",1469664000,4,1405,4.680161943319838

7719376,3,B01DLGY3EI,"Just finished watching ""Godless"" released by Breaking Glass Pictures.
 There is a such bare minimalism of constrained emotion and setting in ""Godless""  that I kept thinking I was watching Joshua Lim's - who wrote and directed ""Godless"" - graduate thesis movie for his Masters or Ph. D. in film studies - and that is not a good thing.
At first, it seems that Nate Flanigan is breaking the fourth wall to his viewers.  Nate, who is a personal trainer at a local fitness gym in an un-named city somewhere in the Untied States, lives at home with his mother in the family home and pines for the one true love of his life - his older brother Steven.
Prude Alert - ""Godless"" does deal the incest between brothers in an unflinching way.
When their mother dies, Steven returns home from his self-imposed exile.  When he left for college to pursue his medical studies, Steven enacted a no-contact rule between himself and Nate because he wanted them both to move beyond their physical, emotional, and sexual relationship
Through a series of flashbacks narrated by Nate, his relationship with his parents and Steven is slowly unraveled.  Nate can not move on, despite the fact that Steven apparently has as evidenced when his boyfriend comes to help care for Nate, who is suffering from extreme depression after his mother's death.
Spoiler Alert - Yes, Nate and Steven rekindling their sexual relationship again.
Nate simply doesn't want to move on and regulate his sexual relationship with his older brother in a deeply forgotten corner of his mind because he doesn't want to move forward.  Nate does tell us and Steven at one point that he has had a lover in an attempt to make Steven jealous.  Nate's lover, a co-worker, does care for him and wants a relationship with him.  Nate doesn't want to commit to anyone but Steven.
Spoiler Alert - As ""Godless"" draws to a close, it's revealed why Nate is apparently breaking the fourth wall, suggesting that people can be saved by those who reach out.despite what they willingly done.
Recommended, with reservations because I really felt I was watching someone's graduate thesis in movie making when I saw it.

7719378,4,B01DLGY3EI,"Thoroughly enjoyed this movie, but it was solely because of the performances of several of the actors. The script had some holes in it that could easily have been filled, and the pacing was DEADLY SLOW! About 15 minutes in, I realized it was a directorial choice, NOT a deficiency on the part of the actors. By picking up the pace, the movie could have been so much better. But, I got the feeling that the writer/director slowed the pace to fill the 90 minute run time. A much better choice would have been to flesh out the character of the Uncle, or the location of the gym (where Nate and Trent are personal trainers).

Without giving away too much of the plot, the two main actors - Craig Jordan and Michael E. Pitts - play brothers who are much more than that. Told in partial flashback, their relationship is the central plot point. Both turn in good performances, but Craig Jordan as Nate is the most redeeming feature of the movie. His performance is nuanced and never crosses the line into pathos. The last 10 minutes of the movie are basically his, and while the final twist did not come as a surprise, I did find my heart pounding, waiting until the denouement. That is a tribute to his performance and his skill as an actor. I look forward to seeing much more of him (as an actor - he shows all there is to show in this film, but it is not gratuitous and central to the plot).

Also worthy of mention are Garrett Young as Trent, and Michelle Gallagher and Joseph Aloysius McGinn as the mother and father. Michael E. Pitts as Nate's brother, Steven and Jefferson Rogers as Ray (and two other sides of the triangle) are natural in their roles, and completely believable.

8756383,2,B01DLGY3EI,"As much as some people like to think this doesn't happen, it does. I personally know of a couple of brothers who moved to a different country so they could be together away from their family. So naturally this movie sounded really interesting, but it could have been SO MUCH better. It feels very much like an early film school project. The camera angles are dull, the scenes are too long, and the actors behave as if they're reading off of cue cards the whole time. The only exception is Michelle Gallagher, who plays Nate and Steven's mother. All of her scenes are remarkably well done.

5/5 stars for daring to explore this topic, -4 stars for poor execution, +1 star because Craig Jordan is extremely cute.",1533254400,,710,4.590551181102362
8756384,2,B01DLGY3EI,"Long, boring and pretentious.  That said, it treats its double-whammy controversial subject matter -- incest with a dollop of homosexuality (brotherly love taken to a different level) -- quite delicately and with compassion.  The Acting is quite good although the directing pace is so slow that it feels like you're watching grass grow.  And we know these boys are experiencing a very different kind of relationship that is confusing to say the least, but they are, after all, in love with each other and from what we can tell, they have been able to consummate that love pretty much on a nightly basis given that they share the same bedroom -- a luxury most other gay teens don't have, i.e., to make love (and have sex) with the object of their desire regularly -- for all that, these guys NEVER LAUGH or even break a smile!  Even when in each other's arms, the facial expressions are pretty much static throughout -- no fun, not even much pleasure.  Seems like the director could have allow a the characters a little more joy in this story.  Yes, mom just passed away so the mood is somber, but there are plenty of flashbacks and the telling of earlier, happier times, but even then, they are STILL glum and expressionless...no levity at all; it is depressing.

Even though I give it only two stars, I would still recommend it for the attempt it makes to tell a story about the dilemma love can cause.  Cupid's arrow flies willy-nilly regardless of who happens to be in its way and many times can cause havoc for those who are unfortunate to get hit.",1530835200,,1552,4.577617328519856
8756385,4,B01DLGY3EI,"This is probably the most thought-provoking and challenging gay film that I have ever seen. Watched it again recently, after watching a similarly thought-provoking film: Call Me By Your Name. I think it affected me even more the second time.",1530489600,,241,5.05
8756386,5,B01DLGY3EI,"This is not like me and my brother, But , I am not like other people. this is a good serious film the two brothers does not bother me, you love who you love. this is not a light film the end is very serious. I was drawn in to their love for one another, personally I think they could have made it work out.",1528070400,,306,3.723076923076923

8756388,2,B01DLGY3EI,"Poor acting, poor writing, poor direction. Too many silences, too many darkened rooms. Slow as molasses. If this film has a message, it is the banality of life. How do we bear it? We go to movies. Just not this one; especially if you're suicidal, it might drive you over the edge.",1525564800,,280,4.403846153846154
8756389,2,B01DLGY3EI,"You have to love the subject matter in this film to overlook the bad acting, glacial pace, claustrophobic setting (90% of the film takes place in a small bedroom or waiting for someone to enter through a small front door, or in the kitchen), hardly written characters ---  the brothers and Ray looked so smilier that I had trouble knowing who was kissing who.....  totally woeful with never a change of pace --- in the filming or in their tone or in the look.  Could be renamed Bleakhouse.",1522540800,2,489,4.534090909090909
