8416668,3,B0045FT9X0,"Violence is a 1947 low budget black and white film dealing with the problem of veterans adjusting to a society that seemingly doesnt provide adequately for their post-war needs. In 1947 this was a major topic following the Great Strike Wave of 1945-46 and Trumans threat to take over railroads if strikes persisted. Bear in mind that 1947 was the year that the Republican Congress passed the Taft-Hartley Act limiting the ability of unions to strike.

Adorable Nancy Coleman (1912-2000) stars as an undercover reporter looking into a veterans organization that promotes violence. She was active in the 40s and then switched to TV where she was popular as a dramatic actress. Shes probably best known as Abigail Brooks Adams from the Adams Chronicles.

Familiar Michael OShea (1906-73) had a similar career to Coleman. He played mostly in crime dramas, probably because he came from a family of Policemen. Here he plays an ambiguous person who becomes romantically involved with Coleman.

Renaissance man Sheldon Leonard appears as a thug as he usually did (e.g., Guys and Dolls (1955), Pocketful of Miracles (1961). This is one of his weaker performances as an actor, however, Leonard was also a producer (I Spy, Andy Griffith Show, Dick Van Dyke Show, Danny Thomas Show), director (The Real McCoys, Gomer Pyle,  Lassie), and writer (Andy Griffith Show). He was a prolific actor who appeared in more than 50 films from 1934 to 1952 at which time he turned to TV and later developed the rest of his skill set.

Big Peter Whitney (1916-72) appears as a not-so-bright thug. Whitneys massive frame and enormous head awash with bushy eyebrows made him
a natural heavy in films like Underground (1941), Murder he Says (1945), and Three Strangers (1946). In the 50s he transitioned to TV appearing in dozens of series. He had a recurring role as Sgt. Sinclair in The Rough Riders (1958-9).

Emory Parnell (1892-1979 was a familiar face in hundreds of films and TV shows. Here he plays the head of a corrupt organization, but in his later career on TV he usually played a cowboy or a bartender.

John Hamilton (1887-1958) makes a brief appearance as a physician. He made hundreds of films and TV shows, and is probably best known as Perry White from the 1950s Superman TV series.

Monogram Pictures had produced a hit in 1946 (Decoy) and this was their follow-up, with the same director, producer, and actors, but it failed to sizzle.

1947 wasn't the best year for films. The Oscar winners were Miracle on 34th Street and Gentlemens Agreement and the box office leaders included Unconquered, The Bachelor and the Bobby Soxer, Mother Wore Tights and Life with Father. Other notable films that year were Dark Passage (Bogart), The Lady From Shanghai (Orson Welles), and Possessed (Joan Crawford).

The topic is important, but the film isnt. My favorite films about this era are The Best Years of Our Lives (1946), Till the End of Time (1946), Home of the Brave (1949), and The Men (1950).",1464825600,,2979,4.869565217391305
8416669,4,B0045FT9X0,"Diverting B-movie with a female investigator infiltrating a corrupt and murderous political organization disguised as a social welfare group for war veterans.  One pointed speech from the villain about using blind anger to manipulate voters feels chillingly prescient today.  When the heroine is nearly killed in a car accident and suffers amnesia a mysterious stranger turns up at the hospital claiming to be her fiance and convincing her that her cover identity is actually her real one.  What's his game and will the heroine remember who she really is before the bad guys figure it out and get rid of her?

Violence is fast paced enough that you don't think much about the plot holes and extremely well-acted and directed for a low budget B-film.  If you like old Hollywood B-movies Violence is probably a must see.  On the other hand, if you aren't already a fan of this type of film Violence is not likely to change your mind.",1461974400,,931,4.7875
8416670,3,B0045FT9X0,"A quaint programmer with quasi-noirish elements, 'Violence' (Monogram, 1947) adds an amnesia plot twist to an otherwise run-of-the-mill reporter-pursues-racketeers (in this case the amoral practitioners of which seek to exploit the social maladjustment of disgruntled WWII vets) scenario to mildly entertaining effect.  Director Jack Bernhard ('Decoy,' 'Blonde Ice') does manage to pull off at least one cleverly shot scene, in which a car crash is implied with equal parts artistry and economy via spectators window shopping for an engagement ring, but overall manages to deliver little more than an average poverty-row crime-drama with respectable, though unexceptional, performances (perhaps save Sheldon Leonard's, whose heavy-- a routine assignment for him at this point in his career-- stands out by comparison).  2 1/2 stars.",1414886400,2,832,5.867768595041323
