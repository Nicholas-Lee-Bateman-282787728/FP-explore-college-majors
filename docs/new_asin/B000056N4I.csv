7932257,4,B000056N4I,One of the most interesting film of the Golden Age of Hindi cinema. Only a few Bollywood filmmakers are capable today to achieve such cinematic achievement. Bollywood should go back to its roots and celebrate its culture. Kapoor has grasped Indian culture and melted it with Western cultural ideology without jeopardizing Indian identity. Beautiful acting and great songs.,1298851200,,372,5.431034482758621
7932258,5,B000056N4I,"Pre-Bollywood Indian cinema classic, over 60 years old (1951), this movie represents a milestone in cinema history, but most of all it is beautiful, inspiring, intelligent, full of exceptional music. Raj Kapoor, director and hero of the movie, declaredly was inspired by Charlie Chaplin's Tramp character, but at the same time he built what was to be the Raj/Raju iconic role of many Indian movies to come, the young, nave but well intentioned poor guy that with his enthusiasm sets out to conquer the world.

A chaste woman is falsely accused of infidelity by her husband Judge Raghunat after being kidnapped by a criminal that wants revenge for a previous false accusation of rape by her husband. Banished from her home she gives birth to her son Raju on the streets and raises him in a slum, while his father refuses to recognize him due to the suspect he is a bastard. Raj finds a father figure in Jagga, his mother's abductor, who he does not however recognize as such. Raju strikes up a childhood friendship with Rita, a wealthy little girl. However, due to economical differences and Raj's internment in prison the two are separated only to meet again when they grow up and Raj now a thief steals Rita's purse. They start an intense love story, in which Raj tries hard to live up to Rita's expectations, but Judge Raghunat who has in the mean time become Rita's mentor discloses him as a thief. Raj discovers the Judge is his father and Jagga his mother abductor. First he kills Jagga and then he tries to kill his father but he does not succeed and is sent to jail. In court Rita as his lawyer defends him calling the Judge as a witness and bringing him to recognize Raj as his son. Raj is sentenced to three years and Rita promises she will wait for him.

This impressive and complicate plot actually has the aim to deny a well rooted Indian opinion that the predisposition toward crime depends on one's caste and family upbringing. The Nature versus Nurture debate is present in other films by Raj Kapoor, who resolves it with the implication of society that ignores the necessities of the poor and thus turns them into criminals.

The movie is a family enterprise, like many other Indian movies, in that the Judge is played by Kapoor's father, the child Raj by his younger brother, Rita by Nargis his lover at that time.

Anwaara became world famous. It rapidly conquered audiences in all the Communist Countries, particularly interested in Indian movies that did not show an American influence. It is stated that it was Mao's favorite and its title song ""Awaara hoon"" was sung in Hindi and in many other languages as well and its music sung mostly by Mukesh is still played today.

Independently from it aesthetic and entertainment features, this movie is interesting because it bridges many cultural worlds. It is definitely influenced by Italian Neorealism, French Surrealism and the Charlie Chaplin figure, at a psychological level it lies between the Oedypus myth with the son trying to kill his father, the struggle between evil (bad part of Raj character)  and good (represented by his virtue but also by Rita, the feminine figure of a woman-angel), and also the Rama myth with the god abandoning his pregnant wife. Stylistically the movie contains one of the first dream sequences typical of Indian movies, that is also halfway between East and West, with Grecian columns and a well filled pantheon of gods. The lavish sets are still impressive today, as also the dresses and the dance sequences. Some scenes remain in cinema history such as that when the two lovers frolic on a sail boat and kiss, only through their reflection in the water.

Even if a classical, this movie is still enjoyable today and is really a ""must"" for all cinema lovers.",1230336000,11,3765,4.747706422018348
7932259,5,B000056N4I,"The title song Awara Hoon is very melodious. This was the first song crossing the boundaries of Indian subcontinent and reaching worldwide. The milestone song not only for the carrier of Singer but also for the bollywood as film industry.

Arabic and Eastern European singers of that era mugged up this song up and were drawing hugh crowds in their shows. Millions of peoples in China and Russia were singing along with Mukesh even without understanding the language.

PS: Mukesh is the oldest singer still being listened.",1203638400,4,522,4.988505747126437
7932260,4,B000056N4I,"I just have to comment the mistaken statement made in an earlier review. Satyajit Ray was from Bengal and is definitely not a ""Dravidian"".",1142121600,,138,4.791666666666667
7932261,5,B000056N4I,"If you're first introduction to Hindu cinema was the Dravidian Misery Master Satyajit Ray, this film will hit you as quite a different experience.  Apparently, Ray's poignancy came from the fact that the world presented in his films was much more based in reality than the previous traditions of Bollywood.  This film is often noted as a golden age classic, the veritable Casablanca of India.  While it certainly is somewhat unrealistic (what musical isn't?), I did not find it lacking in either poignancy or entertainment value.  I saw it as a modern vision of an ancient morality tale, told for a newly free and independent nation that was looking forward to a better future, not intent on miring itself with worries about the past.  I also liked the songs, especially the one about the moon and the one with that many armed Hindu goddess in the background; I thought it was a marvelous look at Hindu culture and its mixing of old and new.  What's more, this was entertainment that was at least interesting to my young kids as well as us old folks.

If you are a serious film buff who wants to have an international collection, this film, probably India's greatest old classic, is a necessary component of any well-rounded DVD collection.  I am not familiar with the quality of this particular DVD image but the fact that it is available at all is quite a surprise!

Trivia: the son in this film was also the director, and the judge was his real life father.  Rita was also his real life love interest for a time as well...",1071360000,11,1525,4.614814814814815
