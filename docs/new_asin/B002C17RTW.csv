8362794,5,B002C17RTW,"A surprisingly effective chiller featuring a man who isn't (J. Carrol Naish as Noel).  He's obedient.......to a point.  He doesn't understand jokes and/or teasing.  His loyalties are severely tested throughout this brief (58 minutes) film.  He has only one abiding alliance and he's about to lose her (Lynne Roberts as Madeline Renault) to Larry Forbes (Shepperd Strudwick).  And oddly enough, at his abrupt appearance in town, several attempts are immediately made on Larry's life.  Sheer coincidence, I think not!  Noel has no problem murdering two men for simply laughing at him.  I guess when Dr. Renault (the unparalleled George Zucco) made a man out of an ape; he forgot to put him through a course of anger management.  Instead, he taught him to speak without benefit of a treat.  Dr. Renault favors a whip.  Another failing of Dr. Renault was in thinking he had ""cured"" the unspeakable felon Rogell (Mike Mazurki).  Rogell soon proves him wrong by kidnapping his niece Madeline.  Poor Dr. Renault's day only gets worse after that.  Longue vie Bastille Day!

Love the look of this film, lots of moody lighting and close quarters.  George as a villain is always fun.  But the star of this film is J. Carrol Naish, it's a poignant performance.  He's perfectly cast as the sad misunderstood faux person Noel.  My only complaint is with the hasty ending.  Otherwise, a fabulous find for my collection!",1442707200,2,1404,4.944206008583691
8362795,5,B002C17RTW,"A real forgotten gem. It's better than many of the classic Universal 'horror' movies from that era. A good script and directing as well as great
actors in all the roles like George Zucco and J. Carol Naish make this a must have. I won't get into details about movie as someone already
did but I do agree the ending is excellent and one of the best endings for these types of movies. One of my favorite.",1426982400,,402,4.233766233766234

8362799,4,B002C17RTW,"Love has its consequences whether you are ape or man.  I cannot think of a better person to portray the character part than
J. Carrol Nash. Just as he played a hunch back in House of Dracula, he is again infatuated with a young beauty and will do anything to get her attention or love. As a house boy, with a low IQ  in this movie, he gets no respect. Then of course the boyfriend shows up and now there is competition for her affection. Poor Nash is also mistreated by George Zucco who is the gal's dad and his employer so to speak.  I will not give away the story, but I assure you that this is a well made  B-movie.

8362800,4,B002C17RTW,"FOR A B MOVIE MADE DURING WWII THIS IS AN INTERESTING LITTLE FLICK. THE ENDING WILL NOT SURPRISE YOU AS IT MAY HAVE AUDIENCES DECADES AGO, BUT ANY FAN OF CLASSIC HORROR FILMS WILL FIND THE SOMEWHAT MOREAU-LIKE PLOT INTERESTING. WHEN PUT INTO PERSPECTIVE WITH THE UNIVERSAL RELEASE OF THE CLASSIC ""THE WOLF MAN"" JUST A YEAR EARLIER AND THE LATER 'PLANET OF THE APES' FILMS THIS LITTLE GEM SHOULD NOT BE MISSED.",1347494400,3,409,4.616438356164384
8362801,5,B002C17RTW,"1942 was an interesting year for Hollywood.  Horror was once again in it's heyday and almost every studio was on the bandwagon attempting to cash in on Universal's success with THE WOLF MAN.  While some studios decided to avoid animal-people movies altogether and stay with other tried and true horror elements, some decided to try their own ""weremonster"" formulas.  20th Century-Fox decided that besides their own werewolf story (THE UNDYING MONSTER), they would monkey around with the idea.  They dusted off an old property that they had made in silent days called THE WIZARD, which was itself a remake of an early silent called BALOO, THE KILLER BABOON.  The basic storyline involes a mad scientist who through various medical means (serums, head transplantation (!)) would make a gorilla more like a man-- or part man at least.  For the new film, surgery and blood transfusion and body chemical realigning would do to have George Zucco alter his big ape into J. Carrol Naish, thus creating DR. RENAULT'S SECRET!  The film is itself a wonderful quickie at 58 minutes with marvelous performances by all performers, especially Zucco and Naish.  The film was briskly paced and directed with panache by Harry Lachman, one of the unsung heroes of the B-movies.  Makeup was wisely kept to a minimum, as no one was supposed to know that Naish was really some sort of monster.  The film was released as the 2nd half of a double bill with THE UNDYING MONSTER and did brisk business.  For some reason or another (print trouble, negative difficulties, etc.), this was thought to be an almost lost title.  Fox has done a yeoman job on restoring this film to its glory.
