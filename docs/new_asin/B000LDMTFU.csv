8610252,5,B000LDMTFU,"This is a very interesting DVD. It is very short, only about 24 minutes. The video follows a group of backpackers in Tokyo,during their stay. This DVD show some great sites, such as the Tsukiji Fish market, the Edo-Tokyo Museum, Yasukuni Shrine, and Akihabara and is worth the money for a small glimpse at what you can see in Tokyo. You will not learn very much about planning travel to Tokyo, get a guidebook for that.",1214611200,,419,4.526315789473684
