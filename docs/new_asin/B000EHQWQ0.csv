8199888,1,B000EHQWQ0,"This has got to be one of the worst visual novels I have ever played. Dragonia is one of your typical fantasy games with shallow lore and copious amounts of cliches. The protagonist, Ryu (the blue-haired dude who I swear is a rip of Ryu from the Breath of Fire series), is the obnoxious hero who can't seem to shut up. He is your typical prophecy chosen, orphaned hero who lacks any sort of unique qualities and is good just to be, well, good. Hadele, the villain (pictured on the cover with the dull blond hair), is your stereotypical evil pretty boy who just wants to take over the land just because he wants to. Every other character fits into some lame cliche: The princess is your uninspiring tomboy royal with some hints of tsundere; Tran is the random nice girl and motherly figure; Jamka's the spunky supporting character that's basically the Robin Hood of the game; and Roi/Roy, Ryu's father, is your average anime father who disappears for some plot-enforced journey.
There are no surprising twists or turns in the story-telling. Anything that comes up as unexpected is so left-field that it ends up with a ""wait, what the hell just happened?"" feeling instead of one of genuine surprise. Character development is virtually nonexistent. The characters never grow or change and everything feels so contrived and constructed, making the story very hard to take seriously. The lore is lame and so Christian-inspired that it's laughable.

Gameplay-wise, it is decent. For a short visual novel, I was surprised by the amount of choices you can make. However, the choice system is a bit annoying. Because the game is operated via a DVD disc, the player must input a password to continue off certain points instead of using save states that are commonly found in games of this genre. The manual says that for every option you're supposed to get a password, but I found several options where a password was not given. Thus, I found myself having to fast forward many times just to get to the next option. In total I found about eleven different endings ( 5 bad ones, 4 credit-rolling good ones, and 2 wtf ones). That's quite a lot for a game that can be beat in one sitting. None of the endings felt worth it, and about three of them hinted at a sequel. This made no sense to me since a sequel was never made, but I guess they thought this game was gonna hit it big enough for one. Who knows?

Dragonia is a terrible game, without a doubt. However, I did find myself constantly laughing at the poor narrative, corny VAing, underwhelming soundtrack and cheesy sound effects. This is essentially the visual novel version of a fantasy B anime/movie. I shared some laughs with friends as well. So for any who might be interested in trying this one out, I say just to get it for the laughs. There's really no other reason to play it.",1442016000,,2829,4.611111111111111
