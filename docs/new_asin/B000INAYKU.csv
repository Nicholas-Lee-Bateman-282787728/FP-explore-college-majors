8275527,5,B000INAYKU,Cliff at his usual best.,1428624000,,24,4.0
8275528,1,B000INAYKU,"This DVD is dreadfull. The combination of factual innacuracies and the poor quality and quantity of the video adds up to an awful documentary.  One expert/talking head kept confusing the songs Livin' Lovin Doll and Living Doll.  Hank Marvin is credited with the guitar sound on Move It, a song that was recorded and became a hit before Hank was a member of the Drifters/Shadows. Hank simply replicated that sound after he and Bruce Welch joined the group.

You know, there is a need for a definitive DVD documentary series on Cliff's career a la The Beatles Anthology. This is definitely not it.  Do not buy this.",1262995200,4,613,4.700934579439252
8275529,5,B000INAYKU,"The very brief, but very educating scenes on opening guitar riffs of 'Move it' alone justifies the price. I think George Harrison would agree on this.",1152576000,7,150,4.8076923076923075
8275530,1,B000INAYKU,"If you don't know much about Cliff's early career than this documentary might have some interesting information for you.

But if you are a Cliff fan that is expecting to see some really great,vintage footage of Cliff in the 1950's.....pass on this DVD. There is not ONE old clip in here that is in full. All the old clips are 30 seconds long then they cut away again. The quality of the old footage is very bad as well. Very dark and cloudy looking. Really wanted to enjoy this but it's just plan bad!",1151366400,19,501,4.329787234042553
