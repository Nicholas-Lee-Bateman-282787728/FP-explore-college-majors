3146835,5,B0015QT7AM,I couldn't agree more.  This was one of my favorite shows as a teen.  Lots of imagination.  It was sad to see it die so soon.  Can't wait to see it again.,1220400000,4,154,3.71875
3146836,5,B0015QT7AM,"I watched this show as a child and looked forward to every episode. The show was an adventure fantasy about a group of varied and despirate people who were trying to return to their own dimension after being lost in the Bermuda Triangle. I hope they release this to DVD soon. It was a fun show, along the lines of Logans Run, Lost in Space, and Sliders. A classic Sci-fi of the 70's that, like many Sci-fi shows, ended too soon.

8259465,5,B0015QT7AM,"I was around 17 years old when this show aired on NBC I think. I thought it was a very good science fiction series. Unfortunately, it didn't last long. I still watch The Fantastic Journey every chance I get. Im looking forward to getting the DVD.",1518307200,,246,4.369565217391305
8259466,5,B0015QT7AM,"I don't have this set, but I loved the show when I grew up and am hoping, hoping, HOPING that it will soon be released on DVD. Please, make it so!
It should never have been cancelled. I was so heartbroken to learn it had been. I'm throwing my two cents out there to let it be known that many people are seeing it on YouTube, bits and pieces here and there, and, unfortunately, that's the only way we can view it. :'(  Well, so many other shows that were not as good have been released on DVD... why not The Fantastic Journey? Bring it!",1475971200,3,535,4.095238095238095
8259467,5,B0015QT7AM,"Was very young when I first saw this but it spurned the imagination and I still consider this one of the best classic 70s sci-fi series. The concept was pretty unique for the time; ""Lost in the Bermuda Triangle, trapped with beings from the past and the future, and other worlds,"" or words to that effect - a great palette for some imaginative stories surrounding our central characters from the present, past, and future. I am amazed that this series is not officially released yet; have had the bootleg DVD for years (when I purchased the official Logan's Run TV series), and I even designed my own sleeve for the Fantastic Journey to complement my 70s TV collection (creating the green cloud in photoshop was fun). Later we got a better quality download of Fantastic Journey. Would rather not have to do this at all; if this is ever officially released on DVD (though I pretty well have forgotten what a DVD is) or at least for official download/streaming, I will be there with my money. This series should at least be a remaster and have plenty of background information. Varian (Jarred Martin) also made an appearance in an episode of Logan's Run. All-in-all, a classic example of 70s sci-fi.",1445558400,5,1197,4.704761904761905
8259468,4,B0015QT7AM,Short lived television series from 1977 with a large cult following.  Why is this not on DVD already?,1437523200,6,101,4.611111111111111

8259472,5,B0015QT7AM,Found a copy at Comic Con 2012. What a thrill. Loved it as a kid. Just as much fun as I remember.,1345507200,,97,3.4545454545454546

THIS WAS ESSENTIAL TV VIEWING.PLEASE PLEASE HAVE A RELEASE ON THIS.
OF COURSE THE 5 STARS IS FOR THE TV SERIES.",1336089600,,211,4.3
8259474,5,B0015QT7AM,"I'm one of the lucky ones - I video taped this series when it was last shown on British satellite station Bravo circa 1992; converted my vids to dvd some years ago.  But I would dearly love the powers-that-be who currently keep this gem of a series locked away in its vault to get it officially released as soon as possible.  This series had heart - and one of the best theme tunes ever written for a tv series!  I used to fancy Katie Saylor when I first saw this on tv in 1977 (my affections later transferred to Faye Grant appearing in the original V series in 1984).  Why is it that so much banal crap that passes for modern day tv series gets instant release on dvd, but series with some real imagination behind them in the days before CGI and large budgets are only remembered in the fading memories of us 40-somethings?  Message to DVD distributors: get a life, and get this series out there in the shops asap!!!!",1264636800,,919,4.319767441860465
