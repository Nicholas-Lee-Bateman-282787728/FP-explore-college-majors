8162618,3,B000LP505Y,"Be forewarned- this film has no English subtitles. you've got to try to figure out what's going on but since it's mostly a silent film, the action is intended to carry the story and you can figure out what's taking place more or less. I've read the other review and it's very accurate but I do want to add a point:
  Do buy this film if you are a collector. There is a cinema-history significance to it so buy it, watch it once, difficulties and all, and then put it on your shelf along with all your other collectables and let it sit there. Also, this is an opportunity to own a film featuring Wang Renmei who was one of the huge stars in Chinese cinema in the '30s and films from those stars are hard to find. Buy it to add one of her films to your collection and then watch something else. If you are the type that wants to buy a film and then watch it over and over, do what the first review suggests and buy something else. This is for collectors.",1512172800,,952,4.112903225806452
8162619,3,B000LP505Y,"""The Song of the Fisherman"", a 1934 silent film with occasional uses of sound, is considered one of the greatest films in Chinese film history.  It represented a breakthrough in storytelling and filmmaking style in Chinese films.  It became a box office success upon its release, playing for a record 84 days in Shanghai.  Though the majority of the film is silent, it has one of the earliest uses of synchronized sound in a Chinese film, memorably showcased in the heroine's singing of the title song, which is still considered a classic.  And it was the first Chinese film to win an international award during the 1935 Moscow Film Festival.  But unfortunately this DVD, made by China-based media supplier Guangzhou Beauty, is an unrestored and shortened version of the film with no English subtitles or intertitles.  The source print is severely battered and shaky.  There seems to be significant cropping on the top and left sides of the screen, and heads and bodies are often partially cut off.  The audio is also in bad shape.  The NTSC picture has a 4:3 aspect ratio but it is slightly letterboxed.  The region-free disc is single-layered, and the 56-min film was encoded with a 6Mbit/s bit rate.  The original running time according to most sources is 80min, and it is apparent that many scenes are missing on this DVD.  You never see how the bandits rob the family, how the heroine's mother is blinded, nor why the heroine and her brother are accused of a crime.  For such an important film, this DVD will sadly be a non-purchase for many people.",1198281600,5,1554,4.753731343283582
