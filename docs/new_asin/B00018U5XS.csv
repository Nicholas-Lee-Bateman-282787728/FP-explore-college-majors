1982139,2,B00018U5XS,"The 3 clip shows that make up 98% of the content on this disc just aren't worth watching. The 2 minute long ""Chibits"" special however was a real delight. Unfortunately this works out to about $10 a minute for the original content. Pretty pricy for what you get.
Buy this disk only if you absolutely have to see Chibits, or if you really can't stand having the alleged gap in your collection.",1083110400,8,391,4.444444444444445
1982140,2,B00018U5XS,"This DVD set is the final installment in the Chobits series. Unfortunately the episodes are mostly re-caps, and as I've said before in other reviews, the series really goes down hill after the first 12 episodes. Many people I've talked to were severely dissapointed with the ending of the series. So brace yourself for a likely let-down if you're a series fan.
Bottom line is if you've bought the other 6 volumes in the DVD sets you're gonna buy this one anyway, but if you're just scoping out reviews I say DEFINITELY buy the first volume and give this series a try as it's wonderful in the begining but for vol. 7 I save your $17 and give another anime DVD a try.",1080864000,8,665,4.414634146341464
1982141,3,B00018U5XS,"Take into account that this and many other 24+/- episode long series usually air on television only once per week.  The first two episodes on this disk are filler to keep the production schedule alive and to fill holes in the broadcast schedule that would be more easily abused by airing reruns.  Gladly these episodes were not put in their ""proper"" places on the American release so that the story could flow better in the DVD format.
That being said, an addicted Chobits fan like me will be happy to see even the most brief additions of new material.  Even if it is buried in recycled footage.
The first episode does actually offer a fair personality profile of Hideki through the eyes of his freind Shinbo.  And I still can't help but get a little misty-eyed during the 'battery charging' scene when Chi awakens and notices Hideki's warmth, no matter how many times I watch it.
Minoru and Yuzuki follow with their own analysis of Chi's personality.  After the flashbacks this episode closes with a very sweet moment between the two.  Now that I've seen it, I think it would have been welcome in the main body of the series and would have added to Minoru's character developement.
Finally the DVD-only episode.  This is as close to an epilogue the series will ever get.  It's worth a watch no matter how many questions are left unanswered.
The final reason to buy this DVD is Chibits.  A fun 15 minute short that reminded me of why I started watching the series in the first place:  Sappy cuteness and laugh-out-loud humor.
This disk only serves to complete the series, not the story.  Still, it's an enjoyable experience that the most devoted Chobits fan will not want to miss.",1080864000,41,1680,4.641891891891892
1982142,3,B00018U5XS,I WAS VERY DISAPONETD WHEN I WATCHED THE LAST VOL OF CHOBITS. THE ENDING WAS TERRABLE... SO YOU IF YOU LIKE CHOBITS DON'T GET THIS VOLUME..,1080777600,3,139,4.384615384615385

8008680,5,B00018U5XS,"Chobits was one of the first animes I bought. I fell in love with it. The characters are very lovable. Chobits may be one of the cutest anime series ever. Chi is adorable. The animation is very good and the music fits the mood of the story beautifully. It's fun and very sweet, but it also gets extremely emotional at times. Every CLAMP title is great and Chobits is no exception. If you like Chobits check out these other CLAMP titles: X, Tsubasa, xxxHolic, and Angelic Layer. You would really be missing out if you don't watch Chobits.",1354147200,,537,4.489795918367347
8008681,5,B00018U5XS,Got this in to finish my collection and it came in before the date given and in good condition. It was in good playing condition and no problems with any of it.,1336003200,,160,4.03125
8008682,3,B00018U5XS,"It's difficult to put this volume of Chobits in its proper place in the series - because it isn't in its proper place in the series!  Of course the actual storyline ended with the last episode of Vol. 6 My Only Person when Chi and Hideki finally come to their long and drawn-out conclusions about each other.  So what could this set of three further episodes possibly add?  Unfortunately, not very much; but that doesn't mean they're totally without merit.  The problem is a basic one to the Anime industry.

Originally, Chobits aired as a conventional 26-episode TV series.  As usual with these, the animators often look for ways to ""pad"" a story using shortcuts including clips of already-animated segments, usually in some sort of ""flashback"" or reminescence.  The ""recap"" episodes here are numbered 9.5, 18.5, and 24.5, generally indicating where in the story they originally occurred.  Of course, the individual TV episodes weren't numbered at all, and in fact, the final episode wasn't shown on TV as part of the regular series; instead it and the mini-special Chibits were released as OVA's.  ( Bandai made similarly questionable decisions with a recap episode and an OVA in another of my favorite series, .hack//SIGN. )  I can easily understand the anger and frustration of reviewers here who feel somehow cheated by Pioneer/Geneon's decision to lump these into this final and seemingly-inconsequental disc.

My solution, though admittedly somewhat of a nuiscance, is to restore these to their proper place whenever I wish to revisit this remarkable and touching series.  Rather than watching these together as a final and pointless coda to it, I ""reinsert"" them where appropriate, saving only 24.5 Hibiya & Kotoko Chat and the Chibits Special for the series ending.  Is this disc even necessary?  In actuality to the story, NO; but otherwise you miss the short-but-hiliarious Chibits and the final touching scene of the Loving Couple welcomed and congratulated by all their new friends, which serves as a sort of benediction to all their troubles.",1266710400,,2056,5.080357142857143
8008683,5,B00018U5XS,"this disk is a summary of the series, no new footage really but it does include the ""CHI-BITS"" mini feature where sumomo and belle have an adventure trying to deliver an ""important"" article of clothing to Chi.

its quite humorous and is hard to watch with a straight face. its worth getting the dvd if solely for that feature.",1183507200,2,326,4.52542372881356
8008684,1,B00018U5XS,"This DVD does not represent the entire series - I'm deeply offended by those who would rate it high simply because it's part of a series they love. I'm a big fan of Chobits too, but my rating goes to this individual DVD /not/ the series. That said, there are a few things you need to know about this DVD.

Wolf's Rain did the same with episode 4 Recollections. Recaps are silly and serve absolutely no purpose seeing as how you're into the series already and know the series well (not the case with DVD since it's the last of the series), or the series was completed long before a recap is necessary.

I suppose it does serve one purpose: extra green in the pocket for the creators.

Chobits ended with the last DVD, this is a recap which serves absolutely no purpose... what's terribly frustrating about it is the fact that it provides contradictory information to the viewer: in the last DVD of Chobits we're under the impression that persocoms have changed entirely (I won't give away the ending but it's safe to say they're no longer ""dumb bots""). Unfortunately Chi in this recap continues to act like a machine perhaps more so than she did in the last DVD!

So beside from a faulty recap, what's left on the DVD? Well, absolutely nothing!  There are NO lose ends to tie up, nothing new is presented in the way of what has changed since the major epic events of the last Chobits. Absolutely nothing, do not feel the need to either go out and rent this or buy it for that matter... there is no reason to complete your series with it... it literally contains nothing. I loved Chobits... I'm not knocking the series, but this DVD is /not/ worth a single cent or minute of your time.

There is an extremely short clip (the amazing ""extras"" everyone talks about) of the two cute mini-persocoms chasing after Chi's underwear... adorable... I guess, in reality it simply isn't worth your time or patience.",1132185600,4,1902,4.530612244897959
8008685,4,B00018U5XS,"This is more like the tidying up of loose ends from the other characters; there isn't that much new in this DVD. i didn't actually buy this, i was brave and bought the complete collection of 24 or so episodes on 3 DVDs. So this episode didn't affect me too much financially. however if you have only bought the DVD volumes seperately and you are crazy about Chobits, then i'd recommend this. Otherwise, it would be just a good idea to rent it or borrow from a friend.",1118016000,,467,4.318181818181818
8008686,5,B00018U5XS,"Reading some of the other reviews, it appears that this is one of those shows that you either love or hate, so perhaps buying the single-disc set would be a good idea if you haven't seen Chobits before. DO NOT SKIP EPISODES. Even a tiny spoiler can ruin so much, so if you're buying a single-disc set, go with the first one, even if it's not the best of the series. Also, I'd definately go with the subtitles instead of the dubbing. Chii's Japanese voice is so much cuter. *.*

The show starts with a fairly straightforward plot, but unlike most anime, the characters continually reveal more depth of personality, and they never cease to surprise you. Like the characters, the storyline steadily evolves and changes shape, revealing ever more to fall in love with. Like I said, however, the first couple of episodes are pretty unexceptional for the genre.

The show touches on several philosophical issues, like what is love, when can you say that something is alive, and what goes into making a person desirable. To me it was both deeply inspirational and uplifting, while at the same time touching and occasionally emotionally disturbing. It's wonderfully drawn, as can be seen already in the intro sequence. Although it's anime, it doesn't fall into the normal pit-traps of overly revealing clothes, nonsensical plots and simple hentai, though it does tease at times.

In this writer's opinion, the author is both poetic and deeply intelligent. He seems to have understood that what makes a story memorable isn't the uber-mightiness of the characters, and the evilness of the villains, but how deeply and profoundly it can touch you emotionally, and this is something I wish more anime-authors would understand. Safe to say, this one will stay with me for many years to come.",1099699200,8,1778,4.880794701986755
8008687,2,B00018U5XS,"I got this and watched it with a couple of friends because we love the series. However, I wish I would of read up more about it, because it turned out to be nothing but re-caps. In my opinion it's not worth it, even if you don't want to bother shelling out cash to get the last six.
With the previous DVD's, at least you have the whole thing to watch. This one was just a quick repeat of everything that happened already. Just save your money.",1086652800,8,443,4.103448275862069
