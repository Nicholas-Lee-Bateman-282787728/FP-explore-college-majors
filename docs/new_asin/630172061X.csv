346695,4,630172061X,"Slam Dance tells the story of a Los Angeles loser named Drood who looks like Amadeus and draws unfunny cartoons for a living. He has an ex-wife with an out-of-control perm who works in a day care with a bunch of kids that look like they take the short bus (one of them hits Drood in the crotch with a rubber chicken). He also has a little daughter named Bean who likes him to take his teeth out and runs in during inappropriate moments like when Drood mistakes a nude prostitute for a secretary (don't ask).

Drood is cool enough at least to have Adam Ant play his best friend. Adam doesn't do a whole hell of a lot in this movie except wear late 80s mod clothes and come out with bad jokes like ""How many surrealist painters does it take to screw in a lightbulb? The fish.""

It seems that before the movie started Drood was involved with a mysterious blond played by Virginia Madsen, who made an 80s career out of playing mysterious blonds before she was in ""Candyman."" She was recently resurrected from the dead for the movie ""Sideways"" and earned an Oscar nomination for it. I'm glad the Academy is no longer prejudiced against walking corpses. But I digress. Virginia isn't in the movie very much except in flashback sequences and a reoccurring photograph where she's smiling at two men facing her wearing scuba masks looking like they're going to pee on her. But hey, she got on the DVD cover!!! She's been murdered and Drood is the main suspect. I guess because he slept with her. Among his other problems, Drood keeps getting stalked by a skinny guy wearing sunglasses and a red Members Only jacket. The guy beats up Drood a lot and sticks a gun in his face while saying stuff like ""she thought you were so smart."" Alluding to the concept that he knew the mysterious blond.

Flashbacks seem to be the main way Wang tells the story. And he makes that very clear about 20 minutes into the movie. Problem is, the flashbacks he's showing are things that we, the audience, viewed in the first 20 minutes as well. Why does he feel a need to show us these things again? It actually doesn't help the plot along and it just makes the movie longer. Maybe that's the point. Because actually there really isn't much of a plot to sustain the running time. To fill the gaps Wang uses the aforementioned flashbacks, music montages, and long gaps between dialogue bits. The dialogue is sparse in this film which is effective for two reasons, one because it helps to maintain the strange atmosphere (which the film has plenty of) but also because the dialogue sucks, so the less of it the better. One example:

Drood: Are you going to help me or not?

Adam Ant: No! You're a selfish f%@k! I'm calling the police.

Drood: Let me borrow your car.

Adam Ant: No.

Drood: Give me the keys.

Adam Ant: No.

Drood: I said give me the f%&king keys!!

You get the point. Somehow I don't think Wang was too concerned about the dialogue, he was more concerned about being stylish. And in that he succeeds. The film ultimately makes no sense but Wang uses a lot of deliberate pausing, an effective score, and great photography to wrap around a crappy script. Hey, it worked for me, I own it. It's a great film to have on when you want to go brain-dead or when you're playing the game, ""Zombies."" Other than that, forget it.",1126656000,6,3302,4.450331125827814
346696,1,630172061X,"Apparently when this was first released it was largely ignored and it should have stayed that way.  While Adam Ant was memorable in this film, the other actors should wipe it from their resumes.  Hulce, the star of ""Amadeus"" was over-the-top, an over-emoting unbelievable character. At times the editing was confusing as the movie darted about. The only good thing I can find to say about this is that it is over. To compare this to Hitchcock is an insult to Hitchcock! Though I may stand alone in my opinion here, you may be the person who would agree with me, so, caveat emptor.",1111795200,6,580,4.5673076923076925
346697,5,630172061X,"I originally watched this movie only becuase I'm an avid Adam Ant fan. I was totally suprised at what a sleeper hit this was. I'm not sure how a movie with Tom Hulce, hot off his Amadeus film, and Mary Elizabeth Mastratonio could have been missed at the box office. Adam Ant play his typical bad boy part with great zeal. A movie that will keep you watching and wondering. Also, a great part of the Police Detective played admirably by Harry Dean Stanton.",1022544000,10,455,4.428571428571429
346698,4,630172061X,"Indie director Wayne Wang (""Chan Is Missing"") was given a shot at a higher budget film and proved to be quite a stylish moviemaker with this largely ignored thriller from the late 80's. Almost universally panned by critics at the time of release (for no readily apparent reasons) this is one movie that deserves a second appraisal; I think it's one of the better of the 80's crop of stylish ""neo noirs""--on a par with ""Someone To Watch Over Me"", ""The Bedroom Window"" and ""Something Wild"". Wang uses the classic Hitchcock ""wrong man"" scenario to push his hapless cartoonist turned murder suspect Tom Hulce through a twisty Kafkaesque nightmare with a Los Angeles backdrop. A fair amount of subtle black humor gives the film a unique flavor, as well as an excellent supporting cast. There's a bit of 80's rock star stunt casting with X's John Doe as a corrupt cop, Adam Ant (surprisingly effective) as Hulce's shady pal, and you'll have to look fast for a dreadlocked Mark Anthony Thompson in a cameo as a bartender. Not for all tastes, but a sleeper worth waking up for.",984528000,19,1069,4.691489361702128
346699,5,630172061X,"Charles Drood (Tom Hulce) is in the wrong place at the wrong time. By no fault of his own, he is caught in the middle of a tangled web of murder,  deceit, and police corruption. With few clues to go on, he must untangle  the web before it entraps him completely. The plot twists in this video  wend unceasingly right to the end of the movie. If you like Hitchcock, you  just might enjoy this video. It's one of my favorites.",967680000,6,424,4.197530864197531
346720,5,630172061X,My husband has been searching for this movie and wanting me to see it. When I saw it on here I bought it immediately!

346724,5,630172061X,"Slam Dance is noir and innovative. With Wayne Wang's unique perspective on film, it's a big budget independent film or a studio level production.

346726,5,630172061X,"Tonight as a Halloween treat for myself I watched the 1987 Wayne Wang thriller ""Slam Dance"" for the first time. Opening with Stan Ridgway's ""Bing Can't Walk"" sets a distinctly haunting and powerful mood for a beautifully filmed and engaging piece which has a magnificent sound design throughout. Tom Hulce is at the top of his game in the lead role, winning our affection for his character when those around him find it nigh on impossible. He even reprises his mad Amadeus giggle (for one scene only). Adam Ant puts in a highly creditable performance as a cad. Mitchell Froom provides the bulk of the music and production and must be quite proud of the result. Slam Dance is in the same league as ""Wild At Heart"" - and makes for a suitably challenging 90 minutes of cinematic assault.",1351641600,4,784,4.64748201438849
346727,4,630172061X,"Interesting little movie.  The Tom Hulse character finds himself on the bad side of ""The People That Really Rule the World"".  He careens through the movie trying to discover what happened and why his life is in a death spiral.  He/You doesn't figure out what its all about until almost the end leaving barely enough time to extricate himself.

Good story with good acting and the compelling song ""High Hopes"" by Tim McConnell - the artist that came to be known as Ledfoot.  A good watch every year of two.",1347753600,2,505,4.566666666666666
346728,4,630172061X,"Excellent suspence drama that will bring back memories of all those out there and wacky 1980's thrillers like Body Double.

346729,4,630172061X,"Contrary to what other reviews say about this little movie, I love it.  I saw it when it first came out, have seen a couple of times since, and recently watched it again on tv.  It still held up.  It has a quirky style and the surprise ending is wonderful!  Tom Hulce is great in it, Virginia Madsen her usual sexy self and I love the little girl who played Bean.  It's not a great movie but it does have charm and wit.  I hope you give it a try....",1206748800,2,449,3.933333333333333

 I always liked it.  It has also aged pretty well.  The plot may have been a tad hard to follow in 1987,but modern movie goers should be sophisticated enough to handle it.  All in all, a good action/suspense/mystery for those nostalgic for the 1980s.",1499126400,,382,4.4

7814154,4,630172061X,"This movie has a lot of issues, but those that are charmed by it will not need to explain themselves. It has some nice performances and some funny jokes, and perhaps some unintentional ones as well. There are some awkward pauses and a goofy plot, but this will be a no-brainer for me to purchase. The soundtrack to this movie is one of the best I've ever heard, both the 'incidental' music (which I am to understand is by Mitchell Froom?) and the songs written for or just used in the movie. They are a huge part of this movie and the absolute highlight. Bear with me.

Upon hearing the most mainstream-sounding song, High Hopes, I just naturally assumed it was a big hit before my time. But nope, it took quite a few years later for Bruce Springsteen to randomly cover it, and then even more years to decide to put it on an album. His version doesn't match the original in any way, as the flair and flavor is entirely missing from it, and it becomes blandly rockified. But the Slam Dance version is extremely easy on the ears.
Art Life by the Fibonaccis is probably what grabbed me and made me pay attention, it is used very effectively in the movie, demands attention and gives a nice punch to the action. It is even better once it's heard in its entirety.
Bing Can't Walk is brilliant, and not only introduced me to Stan Ridgway, his former band Wall of Voodoo, and the entire California art rock scene, but made me a fan for life of that genre.
The music choices are obviously meant to convey the atmosphere of the L.A. art scene, and they do so more than what the actors are ever given to do, in terms of dialogue and personalities.
Years later, the movie Drive with Ryan Gosling has done much the same with its soundtrack- and they are similar in the way they are put together. Drive has gotten quite a bit of credit for that, and this movie deserves the same.
I realize this is not a CD review, but the music in the movie makes this a must. It's textbook how to properly use a soundtrack. Highly recommended!",1439942400,,2015,4.35904255319149
7814155,5,630172061X,"Criminally overlooked little 80's noir that entertains with repeated viewings. This film has it all: Harry Dean Stanton, John Doe (former bassist/vocalist from the L.A. iconic band, X), the stunning Virginia Madsen and a personal favorite of mine, Tom Holce. Rain-slickened streets, murder and a little humor...plus just enough of an underground feel and a perfect musical score as well as beautiful cinematography by Amir Mokri. Buy the Blu Ray which has a tentative release date scheduled for Sept/Oct 2015. (A perfect companion piece with ""Shattered"" (1991) which also has a Blu Ray release date set for Fall 2015!)",1438128000,,618,5.252525252525253
