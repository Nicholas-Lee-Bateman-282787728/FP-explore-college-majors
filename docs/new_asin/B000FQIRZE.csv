2582078,5,B000FQIRZE,a wonderful gift for my basebsall loving brother.  I looked at it before I sent it and almost kept it for myself.  Phillies fans never give up,1296259200,2,142,4.222222222222222
2582079,4,B000FQIRZE,"Having been a Phillies fan since 1950, I enjoyed every second of this review of the games.  Of course, we only won one of these events.  But, seeing the Whiz Kids in action again was memorable for me.  I had the good fortune to see them at Shibe Park, then Connie Mack Stadium as well as the Vet and eventually the Citizens Bank park.  Considering I live in LA, that is pretty good, in my opinion.  Worth the cost to see the highlights of these games.  It is remarkable how close the games of the 1950 series were given the incredible roster the Yankees had.  Of course, the highlight is the 1980 series with the Royals - Rose, Schmidt, Boone, ""Lefty"", and McGraw.  WOW!!  I can die knowing I saw my team win TWO World Series.  Considering we have lost 10,000 games in our history, I will forget that and brag about the two BIG ONES.  Get this DVD if you are as much of a fan as I am.  Worth every penny!!",1255651200,4,905,4.167630057803469
2582080,5,B000FQIRZE,"I bought this DVD for my husband's birthday, he is truly a Phillies Fan, born and raised in Philadelphia!! He never saw the older games and this was a nostalgic walk for him to take with his father. Definitely recommend!",1242691200,,220,4.525
2582081,5,B000FQIRZE,"This is a terrific DVD for Phillies fan, but my main reason for writing is to correct something Thomas Magnum said above.  At the time he wrote his review, the Phillies had won 5 NL pennants (of course, the total is now 6 following their 2008 World Series championship), including 1915, which was not including on the DVD, most likely because there is little if any video footage.  I understand this information does not really change his review, but it bothers me when someone writing something for (potentially) a large audience is so sloppy with the facts.",1227657600,4,559,4.752577319587629
2582082,2,B000FQIRZE,"The label fooled me: these are not the games. These are truncated highlights.

Additionally, Major League Baseball, in their typically obnoxious in-your-face ways, have inserted their large logo onto the top right of the screen. It is extremely annoying and makes for a constant distraction. The games float around while the logo remains still - sticks out like a sore thumb. The good thing is that it cements in your mind that the MLB monopoly is worthy of contempt.",1189468800,14,467,4.9113924050632916
2582083,4,B000FQIRZE,"The Phillies have been in existence for 123 years and have only made four World Series appearances, so this DVD is something of an anathema for a Phillie fans.  It is both sweet and bittersweet as it celebrates their greatest successes, especially the 1980 championship, but also magnifies the futility of the team (the Marlins have been a team for only ten years yet have won one more title than the Phils).  That being said, this is a fine encapsulation of the championship years.  It would great if they would release a dvd of the complete 1980 World Series as it was a classic series and would a must own for any fan of the team.",1167177600,15,633,4.439655172413793

It suprised us all that he was able to remember the names of some of the players (he has trouble recognising his children and knowing eho they are)
He watches this dvd over and over again and each time is able to name off several names.",1354060800,3,298,4.245614035087719
