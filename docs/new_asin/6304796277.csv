928668,5,6304796277,A delightful film.  A little overboard with the big needle in one scene.  I am ordering the DVD because I really liked this film.  Thank-you,1106265600,,140,4.52
928669,3,6304796277,"This is just the perfect film if you're one of those people with nothing better to do on a Friday night... The plot is rather predictable, but that makes it all the more interesting to see how the whole story turns out. It's a good film for all you romantic people out there... I personally think this is one of those films where they got the characters 'just-right'... Cheers!",1096675200,6,377,4.478260869565218

928671,4,6304796277,I just fell in love with this movie the first time I seen it. I love Greg Kinnear and Lauren Holly in it.,1010102400,9,105,3.608695652173913
928672,3,6304796277,"First off let me take my hat off to the producers becasue Lauren Holly and Jill Henessy were lookin' too fine in this picture.  Particularly Jill Henessy was just off da hook!  That was almost enough just to see her.  When she came into that restaurant in that red dress...  Smokin'.
Ok.  So the movie was pretty light.  There are still some pretty entertaining scenes.  When they go to the fertility clinic and Greg Kinnear's efforts to get back to San Francisco from Seattle were both pretty funny.
For a really funny look at 'trying' to get pregnant I recommend She's Having a Baby with Kevin Bacon and Elizabeth McGovern.  Hillarious!",988243200,7,638,4.684684684684685

928734,2,6304796277,"This is a really slow movie.  I really wanted to like it as I am a fan of both Lauren Holly and Greg Kinnear.  But alas, it was poorly written and we only got about 1/2 way through it.",1413676800,,184,3.6923076923076925

I would watch this over and over!!",1390435200,,152,5.04
928738,3,6304796277,"Nice movie, but a bit predictable. Some parts slow moving. Efforts at comedic portions pretty good. Worth having in one's library.",1378771200,,130,5.238095238095238

Makes you laugh !
Loved all the characters . Would definetly recommend to a friend",1370908800,,121,4.304347826086956
928740,3,6304796277,"One of those movies you watch when your bored and it catches your eye. Follows the same plot lines as all movies like it. Couple trying to have baby- lady goes crazy and gets wrapped up in getting pregnant- in walks sexy bimbo, you get the picture. Well this movie does follow that same plot but it also has some good women empowering moments.",1369180800,,343,4.375
928741,1,6304796277,"I enjoy a good romance film as much as the next person, but this dreadful film is so forced that I could barely sit through it. Greg Kinnear who is usually very good is flat as a pancake along with his irritating co-star Lauren Holly. There are a few scattered moments (mostly from Joan Cusack), but not not nearly enough to get this awful film off the ground. I rate it 1 1/2 stars because I was somehow able to sit through this lazy comedy with no romance to be found.",1272153600,3,470,4.175824175824176

7877577,4,6304796277,"A likely made for TV or straight to video at the time movie, A Smile Like Yours is an interesting move about a couple who want to get pregnant (well the wife in the relationship wants to), but no matter how much action they get up to at home and in public places, they aren't falling pregnant.  That wife is played by Lauren Holly, with the movie coming out a year after Picket Fences ended and she was probably still one of the leading actress fantasies of male viewers, she was obviously the big name draw card. As a second drawcard in a minor role as the architect her husband never mentioned wasn't a man is Law and Order's Jill Hennessy (later in her career she'll star in Crossing Jordan). Jennifer's (Holly) husband Danny is played by Greg Kinnear, who hadn't been in a great deal before this movie but does a pretty good job.  I actually wondered for a while if Lauren Holly wasn't playing two roles, as her low self esteem sister character looks pretty similar also with orange hair and even has the fringe helmet hair cut look of Lauren's character Max in Picket Fences.  But she's actually played by Joan Cusack.

This is a light comedy which isn't an overall hilarious comedy or anything but does have some laughs, mostly in the fertility clinic, a lot with Greg's awkward interactions with the no nonsense medical receptionist/nurse brilliantly played by Marianne Muellerleile (one of the phone book Sarah Connor' victims in Terminator).  The script isn't the best in parts, I don't really understand why either secret being kept by the other partner would be something you wouldn't understand why they were keeping it, let alone get mad at the other.  The ending felt a little bit rushed to solve tension in the relationship.  There's also odd things such as at the start why was there an old lady living in a tower still under construction at an early construction stage to get offended by them having sex in the construction lift?  But overall if you're looking for a mid 90's set movie, or are fans of Lauren Holly or Greg Kinnear's work, you should definitely check this out.",1462838400,,2093,4.622641509433962
7877578,1,6304796277,Horrible! Terrible acting - Greg Kinnear cannot save this movie from Lauren Holly's acting and the terrible script.,1454716800,,115,5.444444444444445
