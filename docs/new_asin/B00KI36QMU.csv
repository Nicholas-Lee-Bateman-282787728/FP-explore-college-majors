6429786,5,B00KI36QMU,"I have been a big fan of Paul Mooney from since I can remember.

This dvd is titles a Piece of My Mind and that's exactly what he gives you.. a piece of his mind. I had the opportunity to see Paul Mooney perform a few months ago... What an honor. I have our picture on my wall. If you are looking for a cookie cutter comedian, this is not the dvd for you.

If you are able to handle the truth as Paul Mooney sees it - then this is the dvd for you.",1412467200,5,447,3.694736842105263

6429792,3,B00KI36QMU,"Paul Mooney starts off with a number of observations of black vs. white in culture and media. He shifts into observations of black celebrities and back to black and white issues. His ending, which should be a bang, was a culmination of old dirty jokes I heard back in the early 70's...and no telling how old they were. His observations while interesting, I found more interesting when they contradicted the facts and the audience applauded. I also found it interesting at how the audience howled at the old dirty jokes as if they heard them for the first time.

I didn't find his material to be as funny and original as the young crowd.

..and he also insults the British and the Queen.",1459123200,,686,4.569105691056911
6429793,5,B00KI36QMU,This was my first time hearing one of his comedy acts. He had me in tears. He tells the truth. No holds barred. And it is worth buying and watching. Best of the best. Hands down. Loved it.,1457740800,,188,3.973684210526316

Content: Hilarious. I found myself clapping along with the audience. Mooney's jokes are on-point and brutal.

Some things he points out:

When did Jesus, Moses, Cleopatra, etc. etc. become white? [When Hollywood started hiring white actors to portray these African/Middle Eastern figures.]

Black people aren't afraid of dogs, jail, or s---- no more.

His delivery is good, but... yeah. I'll leave it at that.

He's got some pointedly straight up racist material, but it'll make you laugh if you don't see it coming; on the other hand if you do see it coming, then you'll have a stony face and not laugh (which I found myself doing).

Hard to find on YouTube, streaming sites, etc. You've gotta buy the DVD.",1428192000,,1126,6.943262411347518

He is on point when it comes to racial and social issues and his delivery years ago was much better,  to the point no over the top foul language and sexual disgusting jokes.
