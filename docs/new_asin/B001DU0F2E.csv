This really wasn't a bad film; it isn't a new idea but it was a well done take.  That being said La habitacin del nio has some serious holes in the plot that shouldn't have been there and detracted from the overall story.  At the end of the movie you're left with questions that don't really have any answer.  The film starts with children playing hide and seek, and a house stealing a child by dragging him into a puddle of water, later the child emerges from the house sopping wet and walks off into the distance. The little girl who was the seeker is now an old woman who sits with a broken radio and stares at the house every day.

The story is focused on the family that moves into the house with their infant, and the parallel universe that they seem to be tied to.  It has a very good ""Twilight Zone"" feel to it that plays out through the movie with Juan seeming to be utterly insane.  The acting is well done and believable.  This isn't a slasher picture in the least though it focuses on a murder that appears to be playing itself out over and over again in the house, viewed through the baby monitor that was purchased to watch their child sleep after hearing strange noises through a hand-me-down from Juan's sister.

Juan is convincing in his attempts not to seem utterly and completely bonkers, his wife Sonia is believable at being a harried new mother with a husband who appears to be losing it.  It's well worth watching once, or renting if you can get your hands on it.  There won't be anything particularly new or innovative in the plot, as said earlier it has been done many times before - but that doesn't mean it wasn't a nicely done story.

At the end of the movie (which is very predictable) we're left with the following questions:

1)  Does the house do this to everyone, and as such is it a portal?  If not, what was the point of the entire lead up to the family moving in?

2)  When did the `other' come through?

3)  Why if we see Juan destroy all the baby monitors does he conveniently find one later?

4)  If there are two of everything, what was the point of the `other' coming over in the first place?

5)  If we're supposed to believe that they are two distinct people, why does it appear both Juan are inhabiting one single body?

Some of these, such as the first, could merely be those thinker moments that you're supposed to come away from a good film with.  Some are simply bad explanation, it almost felt like the film made it to a certain point and the director said ""We've got to wrap this up!""

Javier Gutirrez  and Leonor Watling do a great acting job, and La habitacin del nio is worth seeing if just for that.  His paranoia as a rational man and need to explain everything away even while his life spirals out of control is truly superb.  Just don't expect this to be a perfect film.",1306108800,2,2889,4.317843866171004
8294948,5,B001DU0F2E,"Even though I had to read sub-titles, this movie kept me on the edge of my seat.  No one believed Javier Gutierrez, not even his wife that something had happened in the house they are living in. He kept hearing noices from the baby monitor.  It wasn't the sound of the baby.  It was also emotional, because Javier thought he was going crazy.  He would see images of himself on the monitor harming his family, which frightened him severely.  Not to tell too much of the movie, Javier seemed at times not to be able to tell the difference between reality or maybe he was just losing his mind. See this movie.  It's chilling, and horrifying too.  As for the price, I think its a bit much.  I saw this movie on video on demand for free.  Maybe it may be elsewhere for a cheaper price.",1282176000,3,780,4.287671232876712
