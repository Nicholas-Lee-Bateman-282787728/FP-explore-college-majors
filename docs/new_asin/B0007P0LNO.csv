2224863,5,B0007P0LNO,"Let's cut to the chase: you will not find a finer sung Figaro (either on CD or DVD) than this one.  Cast is idiomatic. Bohm and the Vienna Phil are also superlative.  Now to the bone of contention:  the opera is filmed as a film (like Zefirelli's Traviata; Ponelle's Rigoletto, etc.).  For some ""purists"" (or ""fogies"" --your choice of terms, but functionally the same), if an opera production doesn't look like it's been filmed from the 10th row, it's not an opera.  If I want to see a stilted, single perspective view of an opera, I'll go to the real thing. Yes, as the Amazon reviewer notes, there are a couple of scenes in which the singers don't move their lips (to represent thinking); that ""egregious sin""

is far outweighed by the breadth of scenery, the attention to detail, and the action allowed by a moving camera with multiple, real backdrops.  Bravo Ponnelle!",1167782400,18,872,4.660130718954249

2224865,3,B0007P0LNO,"It is a pitty that legendary singers such as Dieskau, Prey, Freni and TeKanawa were completely misdirected in Ponelle's production of Le Nozze di Figaro.  The voices are obviously great as well as the impecable Vienna Philarmonic orchestra conducted by Karl Bohm (another legend).  I would like to give 5 stars to the singers, orchestra and conductor but the average, when you add Ponelle's half star (actually far too much for him), results in 3 stars.  The marvelous action of the second act is completely shadowed by an absurd and slow stage direction.  You can feel the impotence of the singers trying to ""act"" moved by their obvious histrionic skills and by Mozart's sublime music, but they are always anchored by the mediocrity of the stage direction.  Moreover, there are a lot of awaful scenes where the singers are apparently ""thinking"".  They do not move their lips but the music goes on. I do not see the point of doing so, if you watch an opera you want to see the singers singing.  After half and hour watching this film I decided I did not want to contaminate the beauty of the music and the power of the interpreters with such a mediocre stage production.

2224868,5,B0007P0LNO,"I am familiar with Jean-Pierre Ponelle from 2 other DVD releases: Rossini's THE BARBER OF SEVILLE (Claudio Abbado/La Scala Orchestra, with Hermann Prey, Luigi Alva, Teresa Berganza, Enzo Dara, Paolo Montarsalo, Stefania Malagu, Hans Kraemer - DG, 1972); and Verdi's RIGOLETTO (Ingvar Wixell,  Luciano Pavarotti, with Riccardo Chailly/Vienna Philharmonic - Decca, 1983) and was interested to try his version of Mozart's great comic opera, THE MARRIAGE OF FIGARO.  Considering this had a star line up of great singers: Hermann Prey, Mirelli Freni, Kiri Te Kanawa, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Paolo Montarsalo, Maria Ewing, Janet Perry, Hans Kraemer, with Karl Bohm/Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, I didn't see how I could go wrong. I was NOT disappointed: this DVD has everything: wonderful stereo sound (remastered for surround sound systems), singing, staging, and special effects.  Mozart's music is well served, and all the singers have great acting skills in addition to being terrific singers.

Some tempos are slightly slower than one might hear in an opera house or audio only studio version, but that only adds to the excitement and intensity of the music.  Add in also the fact that the 4 principals in 1976: Prey, Freni, Te Kanawa, Fischer-Dieskau, are handsome/beautiful (as the case may be) + great singers.  They express so well what is being sung, and Ponelle's concept to have them singing as if in thought (especially in two of Te Kanawa's arias) is very effective.  (The aria - singer's voice - is heard, but the singer's mouth does not move.)

I am no authority on Mozart operas, opera staging, or even the music, but some of the arias have been familiar to me for over 30 years.  I just know I enjoyed this alot: try to sit still and not march around the room when Hermann Prey launches into ""Non piu andrai.."" which ends Act I!  Mozart packed alot of great tunes into FIGARO, accounting for it's great popularlity 220 years after it was composed.

Subtitles are provided in various languages: the English one is useful and accurate, though inevitably some of Da Ponte's nuances are lost. The image is crisp and pleasing (unlike the flatly-lit, saturated Ponnelle ""Carmina Burana""). The sound hardly betrays its age: a relief after the ragged sound on the Losey ""Don Giovanni"" DVD.  The recitatives have a drier acoustic -- recorded on set, perhaps?  The singers are all on top form, and near ideal.  (Maria Ewing as Cherubino makes a convincing adolescent boy, even in close-up.) Bhm knows how to point every aspect of this wondrously varied score. Basilio and Marcellina lose their Act 4 arias.  Ponnelle's direction shows insight, imagination and meticulous planning.  There is only one serious miscalculation, when he has the Count strike the Countess in the Act 2 finale.

2224871,5,B0007P0LNO,"Thanks to Karl Boehm and the Wiener Philarmoniker, the music is outstanding. The staging is very precise; for example at the very beginning during the Overture, the camera zooms on the title when the music goes crescendo. The overture also shows Voltaire's book ""De l'esprit des lois"". It  indicates that the feudal society is doomed and the Enlightenment is taking over. Also, the end of Atto 1 is unbelievable when Figaro makes fun of Cherubino supposed to join the Army. The performance of Te Kanawa is flawless and I like the long recitatives where she shows how desperate she is.  This opera is incredibly modern and it is amazing that the Emperor let play this opera. The only criticism that I would make is that the scenery often looks artificial and Atto 4 in the garden (jungle?) looks totally unrealistic.",1411344000,,815,4.814285714285714

I can't really understand the backlash in some other reviews.  True or false?  You can accept German characters screaming at each other in Italian, with orchestral accompaniment, with no orchestra visible--in fact in a room not large enough to hold an orchestra.  Then what's so shocking about one more literary layer, the thinking arias, especially when it makes perfect sense in context of the drama, and the medium?

Of course, I would consider the thinking arias concept a gimmick 'owned' by this production alone and would not want to see it become a standard technique, which of course it hasn't.

In any case I would definitely suggest this is the de facto 'benchmark' version of Nozze di Figaro on video, much as I'm sure most would agree the Giulini set is the definitive version on audio.  It is most highly recommended with no caveat of any kind.",1397606400,,1020,4.691011235955056

2224885,5,B0007P0LNO,"ABOUT THIS DVD: MOZART LE NOZZE DI FIGARO, 1976, DIRECTOR JEAN-PIERRE PONNELLE. HERMAN PREY (BARITONE) FIGARO, MIRELLA FRENI (SOPRANO) SUSANNA, DIETRICH FISCHER DIESKAU (BARITONE) COUNT ALMAVIVA, KIRI TE KANAWA (SOPRANO) COUNTESS ALMAVIVA, MARIA EWING (MEZZO SOPRANO) CHERUBINO. VIENNA PHILHARMONIC ORCHESTRA, CONDUCTOR KARL BOHM. DEUTSCHE GRAMMOPHONE LABEL.

If you are looking for the best production of Mozart's Le Nozze Di Figaro, you have found it in this 1976 studio film version directed by Jean Pierre Ponnelle, with the Vienna Philharmonic under the baton of Karl Bohm. This version is perfect, the greatest by far. For me, personally, this is what Mozart had precisely in mind down to the last detail. We get the authentic flavor of Seville, Spain, in everything - the houses, the gardens, the chambers, the furniture, the costumes of both the peasant workers and the nobility. It must have been an expensive production. Karl Bohm was a Mozart expert and had conducted Figaro and Don Giovanni several times at the Salzburg Festival. Bohm's pacing is slower than most of the traditional Italian conductor versions (like Giulini) but this makes for a better performance with lavish attention to detail, adding meaning and sentiment to every scene. Every singer here is in great shape vocally and acting wise, everyone is in character. Herman Prey has a great voice and technique for Figaro, although he provides the role with a lot more seriousness and earthiness, perhaps too calculated and noble, but it is a nevertheless great performance. After all, the character is revealed to be a born aristocrat, which we can tell from the manner in which Prey performs the role. Mirella Freni is a delightfully in character Susanna, a perky, cunning and lively Susanna. More than any other soprano, Freni understood the role as being the heroine of the opera and she really doe shine throughout the whole movie. She is beautiful and sings beautifully, richly and with a lot of expression. She is simply thrilling and there's never a dull moment. Dietrich Fischer Dieskau is a strong, imperious Count, with a touch of seduction similar to his Don Giovanni. He sings wonderfully and he is in great shape here, perhaps due to his experience with Karl Bohm as conductor. Many people don't care for Dieskau but the truth remains he was a highly skilled singer with impressive range (Lieder, Puccini, Verdi, Wagner and Mozart). Dieskau is a terrific Count, one of the all-time best.  Kiri Te Kanawa, in the mid 70's, was in her prime and her Mozart roles of this period were unbeatable. She had ""the Mozart soprano"" voice - rich, creamy, lyric and gorgeous. She makes the Countess very realistic, warm, noble and touching. We sympathize with her position as the wife who has been neglected by her husband. She is angelic and yet also down to earth. I've always preferred Kiri's very warm sound to the ""colder Netherlands"" type of voice that Popp and Janowitz have. Kiri made the Countess one of her signature roles and this film shows us why. Maria Ewing as Cherubino is amazingly perfect. She is very young in this production and looks like a teenager in love, as the role is meant to be. She has a boyish charm and looks like a young boy in the most convincing way. Her voice is gorgeous to hear and she's a delight to watch.  Look no further for the best Figaro ever made. This is it. Everything about this movie is perfection from beginning to end, a sparkling comedy with gorgeous singing, authentic costume and setting and great conducting/music by Bohm and the world famous and first class orchestra the Vienna Philharmonic.",1284249600,7,3626,4.9507389162561575

2224888,4,B0007P0LNO,"Why not 5 stars?
Because this film appears old-fashioned now and could not withstand the passage of time. However, music-wise, this production is about the greatest Le Nozze available on record.
Hermann Prey, the great lyrical baritone and wonderful Mozartian of the last century, is about the best Figaro there could be (both in Rossini's Il Barbiere and Mozart's Le Nozze). This character suits him to a 't'. Every other Figaro on DVD got outshined by his by comparison.
Then we have Mirella Freni's Susanna, such a vivid portrayal. In terms of acting, even better than Lucia Popp. Freni got the right sort of characterisation both vocally and visually that many other Susannas lack. She is girlish, vivacious and wiry, depicting the very essence of the character.
In the supporting roles, Fischer-Dieskau and Te Kanawa foiled a pair of sterling nobilities. The subtle characterisation of Fischer-Dieskau in this recording offers a rather rare chance to reveal this great singer's superb stage-craft. Te Kanawa's noble figure smacks subtle pathos throughout, and wins sympathy all round.
The most difficult character to portray is Cherubino. I have seen numerous productions of this opera and never came to like ANY Cherubino on stage. Maria Ewing is no exception. However, vocally she is superb. The scene in the dressing room of the Countess, however, was a big flop in terms of direction. Did Cherubino not dressed as a woman? If there is no need to present this character in ladies' clothes, why not make it a role for a counter-tenor? Who would undoubtedly be many times more convincing.
The wwakest bit of this production that makes it 'dated' is the 'thinking aloud' in certain major arias. They undermined the score's basic set up. Mozart would not be happy with this. Not one jot.",1264377600,,1791,5.0134228187919465
2224889,5,B0007P0LNO,"I completely agree with most of the reviews submitted so far but.... how about the conductor? All too often praise is heaped on the singers and director but the conductor frequently becomes a distant third with barely a mention. Here we have one of the greatest Mozart conductors of the 20th century - Karl Bohm. If it wasn't for Bohm's sublime and insightful interpretation which shines from start to finish with integrity, this performance wouldn't be going anywhere. Bohm holds the performance together and gives the director something to work with. On the other hand, it doesn't matter how good the director is, with a lousy conductor he is just wasting his time, as more than a few recent DVD operatic issues attest to. Weak conducting allows the production to be lopsided in favor of the director which is never good as the director, often a non-musician, is forced to interpret the music. A strong performance such as this is always a partnership but the musical values should ALWAYS come from the conductor and he should ensure that they remain so. In this production Ponnelle has taken Bohm's interpretation as a starting point and built on it to a stunning effect - a true partnership.",1261699200,14,1195,4.8341463414634145
2224890,5,B0007P0LNO,"Can a line up of super star singers come together and create a lasting, meaningful production?  Well, the singing is just about perfect:  Freni is a surprisingly great fit for Susanna (her versatility is astonishing), and even the relatively newcomer (for a 1976 film) Maria Ewing is a delight; the others, Fischer-Dieskau, Prey, Te Kanawa, and even the supporting characters all sing w/ the most impressive vocalism and characterize the music appropriately.  There are moments of old-fashioned, heavy-footed tempos led by the venerable Mozartian Karl Bhm, but especially with the usual supple, stylish playing of the Vienna Philharmonic, it's all magic.

The film was staged, directed and designed by Jean-Pierre Ponnelle, the master director who created scores of opera films like this for Unitel in the 70's and 80's.  I have enjoyed most of them, but this is one of the best of the lot, one could argue, mostly because the singing is so strong.  The stage direction can seem a bit odd and funny in 2009, but very clever nonetheless, such as the scenes in first act from Cherubino's ""Non so pi"" through to the trio ""Cosa sento!""  They show the cinematic perspectives that one cannot enjoy on stage, or even films of stage productions, and convincingly delineate the musical and psychological details of the score and the libretto.  The acting is, if a bit overdone (after all, one sees the remnant of stage acting from these veteran singers), very convincing, in that it really does the job of bringing out the musical intentions of the composer.

In sum, there isn't much to dislike about this production.  The strongest element is the singing, which is just about perfect.  This, combined with a very strong production musical direction, makes for an indispensable part of anyone's opera collection.",1255564800,3,1804,5.040404040404041
2224891,5,B0007P0LNO,"This is the best rendering of ""Le Nozze di Figaro"" on DVD that I have been able to find thus far.

It should be obvious from the description, but perhaps it won't hurt to re-iterate that this is a movie. If one is looking for the feeling of attending opera in a live performance in an opera house, this isn't it. And while the singers and characters seen on the screen are one and the same, they lip-sync to a soundtrack that they recorded in a studio--standard practice for any movie musical, resulting in better sound than would otherwise be possible, and the overall result is quite good (with one exception noted below). Being a movie simultaneously confines and liberates: one can't quite escape the knowledge in the back of his/her head that what we see did not happen in real time in front of a live audience but rather was something manufactured and put into a film can. I don't mean to suggest that anything about this superb production seems disjoint, but I am simply acknowledging that in our hearts we know that this is a package quite different from the reality of the opera house. But what we lose in one kind of verisimilitude we gain in another: this is opera set free from the limitations of the stage and turned loose into a whole outside world as real as the considerable talent of director Jean-Pierre Ponnelle can imagine. I found opera in this format to be absolutely beautiful and completely satisfying.

Any casual resemblance to a stage production vanishes when Ponnelle chooses to have the singers not move their lips when they are merely thinking their words rather than singing them out loud. It's sort of a cute idea, but I found it a bit weird & jarring. Even as a film, this is opera; and the whole artifice of having people going around singing rather than speaking is inherent to the form; so I think it would have been better if the film had stuck with that convention rather than having the viewer hear words come from closed lips. If the opera had permitted these inner thoughts to have been delivered sotto voce, it might have worked; but thankfully, the producers did not distort the music to suit this device.

This DVD satisfies what is for me the essential prerequisite for a successful opera video: audio that is decent enough not to detract from the experience. It doesn't have to be state-of-the art sound; this one isn't quite; but it is plenty good enough, which is more than I can say for one of the other top-rated DVDs listed on this site, which I found to be all but unlistenable; I refer to the star-studded 1973 Glyndebourne Festival Opera production, which I review later below.

Visually this DVD has the softness and warmth associated with film itself, as opposed to the more clinical look of the straight-to-video reproduction used for most (but not all) opera-house productions on DVD. The picture approaches the limit of what DVDs are capable of, leading me to wonder if it could look still better on Blu-ray; but given that the film is not wide-screen and that the soundtrack's surround sound is simulated, it is not thought to be up to the standard expected of the high-def format. Still, any time the source is 35mm film, there is more detail available than can be presented in standard definition; so I hope that some day it isn't felt that everything has to be in up-to-the-minute twenty-first century technology to justify its release on Blu-ray.

As to specifics of the performance, I leave most of that to the other reviewers on these pages, with whose consensus I agree: this is a marvelous cast in great form, and we have the great Mozart conductor Karl Bhm at the podium of the Vienna Philharmonic. The only other assemblage on video that I know of that is as well suited to the channeling of Mozart directly into our hearts is that of the Met's 1985 production, also designed by Ponnelle, but this time as a stage production. Although not available for purchase, it is available to stream from the Met's Website for a fee.

Although I have taken care to point out the DVD's few deficiencies lest they take someone unawares, my advice is to overlook them. The only possibly good reason not to acquire this DVD is if you are limited in your opera library to no more than one performance each; then you have a terrible dilemma between buying this gem and buying a stage version; and that is not a decision I can make for you; but if you can allow yourself the luxury of two versions of the Marriage of Figaro, this should be one of them!

--------------------------------------------------------------

It seems that Amazon's computers assume all DVDs of a given opera are essentially the same product; so I am not allowed to review another version of Le Nozze independently. I am adding it here for the record because I seriously disagree with the consensus regarding&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mozart-Le-Nozze-di-Figaro-Te-Kanawa-Cotrubas-von-Stade-Luxon-Skram-Fryatt-Pritchard-Glyndebourne-Opera/dp/B0002JYAG4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mozart - Le Nozze di Figaro / Te Kanawa, Cotrubas, von Stade, Luxon, Skram, Fryatt; Pritchard, Glyndebourne Opera</a>&nbsp;and would have given it only 2 stars:

Summary: Splendid singing, sabotaged by the audio

As one of the top-rated ""Figaros"" on these pages, it should be better than this. Yes, the singing is wonderful; and almost everything about the production as seen in the theater was top-notch, although the orchestral playing was not of the same quality as the singing. The orchestra may, however, have been better than can be heard through the poor audio quality, which makes it sound as if they're all playing on cheap starter instruments. The sound from the orchestra pit is dead, while the sound from the stage is as if from a gym heard through a tunnel and then trapped in a honky old loudspeaker. Live pickup was still an underdeveloped technology at the time of this recording in 1973. There is no stereo separation and almost no sense of space; so it might as well have been mono. At first I couldn't stand it and turned it off, but then I gritted my teeth and ventured back in for about half of it. I am surprised that so many of the reviewers here have ignored or dismissed this deficiency as irrelevant. What could be more important than the sound?

Fortunately, there are alternatives, one being this delicious film by Jean-Pierre Ponnelle, which I have been reviewing above. More directly comparable is a much more recent Covent Garden production, stunningly beautiful on Blu-ray&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Le-Nozze-di-Figaro-Blu-ray/dp/B0028O34SG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Le Nozze di Figaro [Blu-ray</a>], but a little lacking in the vocal department on the women's side. To find a stage production on video that did full justice to this miraculous score, I had to return to the 1985 Met performance with Kathleen Battle and Frederica von Stade. Alas, it is not available for sale; but one can stream it for a modest price from the Met's Website. The picture quality is comparable to that on this release (not very good, but bearable), and the audio is better.

Back to the performance at hand (the 1973 Glyndebourne, that is), it is wonderful to see Te Kanawa and von Stade in their younger days, and this would make a good one-time rental, but is definitely not for the opera library if one cares about the sound. As far as the video is concerned, I did not find it particularly objectionable; unlike the audio, it is not critical to the enjoyment of the music; and it is quite serviceable in terms of showing the costumes, action, and sets. Its quality is slightly better than standard-broadcast TV, though well short of the best available on DVD.

The singing is about as close to perfection as it gets; but the ensemble between the singers and orchestra is just OK, suffering from the lapses that are all but unavoidable in live performance. If this production were available on a DVD that was of at least average quality, or if the performance itself were so miraculous as to brush aside any technical objections, it would be worth owning; unfortunately, neither is the case.",1253577600,5,8212,4.946337926033357

I read the reviews on this one and it seemed more like a movie than a Brunhilda endurathon.  BOY DID I FIND A GOOD ONE!  If ratings had six stars I would give this seven.  You will LOVE this performance.  Excellent choreography, cinematography, casting, acting, singing, scenery.  The english subtitles were easy to read and unobtrusive.  The case comes with a summary of the storyline, scene-by-scene, which is good for knowing what the story is about beforehand.  Even my 16-year old daughter and wife (who said that up to now she hated opera) both loved it.  We are now all fans of Ponnelle.  Wonderful!",1213315200,4,742,4.682170542635659

2224896,5,B0007P0LNO,"Well, a Mozart in Video. So soft, so funny, so sweet. That  is what I was looking for since a long time ago. Finally I got it and in this DVD.

Ponelle is a genius, is a mozartean as well, unfortunately he passed away before doing the Don Giovanni. What about the Idomeneo? Let's not talk about this.

This DVD has an amazing interpretation of this Opera. It's very funny. The music, conducted by Bohm is lucid and clear. What winds this orchestra has! The ""Porgi Amor"", with Te Kanawa singing is just about to take you to the Heaven.
It takes place in a beautiful scenario. Nice costumes and good number of scenes and takes.
Ponelle likes the closes and so do I. The playback is helpful in order to avoid the ugly expressions of some singers when reaching too high or low notes. However, sometimes you see a lack of synchrony, but nothing really ugly.
There is only one drawback in this recording. The frame freezing in the moment that Marcelina says to Susanna that she is Figaro's Mom. I didn't like it.
On the rest, the film is really dynamic.
The best part is, for me, the Frey's interpretation of the recitative and aria ""Madre. Madre, son morto./Aprite un pu&oacute; quegli ochi."" He did a great job here. Putting the heart in the music and doesn't loosing the humor.
Cherubino is a very nice character and is doing fine here. The susanna is gorgeous in his mood. The ""Conte"" is a rascal very well done by Dieskau. ""La contessa"" rules. Marcelina and Bartolo are really funny. So is Basilio.
After the last coda you will stay in your seat, thinking. ""This cannot finish, this should last forever"".

If you are looking for a really dynamic and funny Figaro, with amazing singers , amazing conductor and nice orchestra and, in addition, with great scene play and gorgeous acting. Buy this DVD.",1212364800,3,1797,4.554179566563468
2224897,3,B0007P0LNO,"The cast, scenery, and costumes are great, and the conducting is very good though often on the slow side.  The sound track would make a fairly competitive CD.  But this is a movie; the filming was done months after the recording.  And the movie is overdone, with one especially annoying visual effect: singers' mouths not moving when they are supposed to be thinking.  I much prefer videos of live performances to movies with lip synching (except for the superb Rattle/Glyndebourne Porgy).  The next time I get a Figaro craving I'll probably listen to one of my CD versions (Kleiber, Levine, or Solti).",1200614400,2,602,4.862745098039215
2224898,3,B0007P0LNO,"OK.... the best, and I mean BEST production of my fave Mozart opera was televised ""Live from the Met"" in 1985 [or so] with Kathleen Battle, Rugero Raimondi, Thomas Allen and Carol Vaness. It was practically flawless. It was also a Ponnelle production and practically the same production as this 1976 film. Alas the film is not flawless. The cast is great and the ideas are the same as the staged 1985 version, but on film Ponnelle does some things that just don't work. His stage craft does not hold up well on film....until he manages to give in to the stage and put THAT on film as he does with his fantastic ""La Cenerentola"" and his indeed flawless Monteverdi operas.

This ""Figaro"" seems cramped and crowded. And when characters sing their innermost thoughts, as they often do, Ponnelle puts the music and words on the soundtrack, but on camera we get creepy close ups, like Cherubino's act one aria where he looks like he's on a bad acid trip. Just to confuse you even more, it's not consistent. Sometimes the characters sing out their thoughts, sometimes they're only on the soundtrack. And how about the scene that starts the great rollercoaster of the finale of Act II. The Count and Contessa are singing, but Susanna is thinking. We hear her voice on the soundtrack blending with the others, but she's not singing like the others. Just plain weird. All this [and the bad costumes... the '85 version had great clothes however!] just make this a very uneven"" Figaro""... even though it's practically the same production as the Met's. An interesting study in stage vs film. That is if the Met would release their Live from the Met broadcast on DVD!

So, in my search for my perfect ""Figaro"", I'm getting there...but... so close and yet so far!",1192060800,6,1748,4.672077922077922
2224899,3,B0007P0LNO,"I think that Le Nozze di Figaro is one of the greatest operas ever written. I own many recordings of this work. I have bought this DVD based on the recommendations of the reviewers, most of whom gave very positive feedback about this production. Perhaps I had high expectations, but after listening to this DVD I was disappointed.

Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this DVD, but then I have not yet seen a Figaro that I have not enjoyed. The music is superb and you can't help but revel in its beauty.

This DVD features great artists. Figaro, Susanna, the Count and the Contessa are truly great. However, Cherubino or Barbarina could be better.

It is understood that Cherubino, a 13 year old boy, is to be sung by a soprano. This is the reason why this role is played by a woman, but he should at least look like a boy or young man. This Cherubino definitely looks like a woman.  Barbarina is supposed to be about the same age as Cherubino, but looks much older in this production.

The sound quality is awful, especially when the singers move around the stage. This is especially true if you have high end equipment.

This production assumes that you either know the libretto or understand Italian. If you rely on the subtitles, you will miss most of the story line. Yes, you will get a general idea of what is going on, but you will miss many important (and humorous) lines.

Overall, it is a great DVD if you are very familiar with Mozart's work and want to enjoy another production of it. I certainly would not recommend it as your first Figaro DVD. Instead, I would strongly suggest the so called ""Bohm's"" edition, featuring Mirella Freni, Hermann Prey, Kire Te Kanawa, and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau. In my opinion, this is the best Figraro production ever.",1173484800,5,1760,4.568253968253968

8049782,5,B0007P0LNO,"I heard Karl Bohm, the conductor of the music for this film, did not like what the producer, Ponnelle did to his and his orchestra's performance. Yes Ponnelle doctored it. And I agree with Bohm. But that did not deminish the beauty of Mozart's music and Bohm's interpretation. In my opinion, Marriage of Figaro is the most beautiful opera ever written. Karl Bohm brought out the best of Mozart like no other conductor can. Everything about Fischer-Dieskau (his look, his voice, and his demeanor) playing the Count, is naturally aristocratic. Who can ever find fault in his singing? I have also long admired Hermann Prey's brilliant and powerful baritone voice, delivered through his mastery of techniques, especially in the interpretation of Mozart and Schubert. I totally enjoyed his performance in which Figaro is heroic and yet folksy. Prey's display of Figaro's emotions, in the body, and on the face, is moving and genuine. I simply cannot find two men that can equal to these two in these roles.
The first thing that Mirella Freni reminds me of is Mimi, the tragic seamtress in La Boheme. I never associated her with Mozart. In terms of social status, Susanna the maid is just as lowly as Mimi the seamtress. The difference is Mimi is ill, Susanna is full of life. Never mind about the singing, I think Freni's acting of Susanna is Academy Award material. Though her singing does not sound very Mozartian to my ears, she more than made up for it with her legendary sweet voice. Yeah, you got to have something to make the count wanting to bang you.
That Kiri Te Kanawa is a first class singer is undisputed. More than that, she appears to have royal blood just by looking into a camera. She even sang for a British royal wedding. In this film she is as natural at being the Countess as Fische-Dieskau is at being the Count. Look at her at Figaro's wedding scene. So gorgeous that makes you wonder why would the Count want to bang anybody else?
I have heard many beautiful renditions of Cherubino, a role sung by a female. But no one was believable, that is except Maria Ewing. Ewing was never a gorgeous chick, sorry Maria. But she is the only believable, totally lost, hormone drenched teenage boy. That is what Cherubino should be.
I would challenge anyone to find a better cast for this opera.
Some criticize this film as bad opera. Don't look at it as opera. Look at it as film based on an opera. Opera are perform on stages. There are lots of limitations as to what you can do and what the audience can watch on stage. A film throws those limitations away. This film does just that. We see the opera on fim from more angles, more up close, than we can on stage. The result is a sublimely beautiful opera film. It totally convinced me that romantic love is devinely beautiful. Babarina by young Janet Perry, and even Marchellina, the old doctor's (Bartolo) assistance) and Figaro's mother, as played by Heather Begg, are beautiful.",1423353600,5,2941,4.6468330134357005

I'm guessing those who give it more stars have never seen the other version I saw, and so think this is as good as it can get.

I just bought the performance of this opera by The Royal Opera with David McVicar directing, and I love it...",1422489600,,498,4.1875
