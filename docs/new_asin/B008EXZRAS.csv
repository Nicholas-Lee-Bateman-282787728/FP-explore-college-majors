8527203,5,B008EXZRAS,"I mainly bought this because I saw the devil's carnival in wich marc senter, he plays bobby, was in. The price was great, the acting was on fire, and I love the story!",1371686400,,167,4.090909090909091
8527204,3,B008EXZRAS,"Sad story, remind me a lot of warrior and the movie real steel. I kind of had my fill with this one.",1370044800,,100,3.590909090909091
8527205,4,B008EXZRAS,"Ok let me start by saying I'm sold on Mark Senter. I was curious about this film because I watched The Lost and another film he's featured in and this young man has the kind of intensity and fearlessness of a young De Niro. I will be curious to see where his film career goes. This movie has pretty amazing production values for it's budget and across the board good acting and direction. The plot is a bit familiar and predictable...a kind of Cain and Able with a Fight Club setting, but it's always interesting, never boring, and intensely well acted. I like discovering unusual and suprising features and this is one I really liked.",1368403200,,635,4.530434782608696
8527206,5,B008EXZRAS,"What can I say - Marc Senter is just hypnotic - one of my favorite actors at the moment, so I knew this wouldn't be bad - he has good taste. Nathan Grubbs totally exceeded my expectations as both an actor and producer. This was a great independent film and the New Orleans setting worked really well.

My only criticism is that when films like this don't get a lot of PR, the artwork / blurb etc is really important. Thankfully I had read a bit about this project before hand so new what to expect. There are a lot of dodgy fight movies out there and honestly if I hadn't known better I would have thought this was just another one of those going my the story on the cover. Great cover shot though.

The movie was so much better than that and the relationship between the two brothers, Bobby's escalating troubles in NO and Charlies struggle to redefine himself as a man after leaving the fight game was great and understated, subtly performed and shot.",1361664000,,953,4.378531073446328
8527207,4,B008EXZRAS,Great movie filmed by a new orleaian in New Orleans !! It is a action packed thriller start to finish  !,1350172800,2,104,3.9523809523809526
8527208,5,B008EXZRAS,"Brawler is a finely crafted film with fascinating characters, charming and gritty effective settings, exciting action including some of the best fight scenes on film today, and an original and compelling score. To get a taste of the film watch the Brawler trailer available on YouTube. Not sure what this guy from Seattle who gave it one star and made all sorts of negative statements is up to, frankly doubt he watched it. From his other Amazon reviews he appears to be a cyber bully. Brawler is a great independent film, one of the best I have seen in a long time. Highly recommended.",1348876800,5,586,4.644230769230769
8527209,1,B008EXZRAS,"I will not bore you with a long drawn out, sub-par, unintelligent, poorly devised and incredibly crappy review of the movie as it has done for the last hour and a half of my life. I will simply say, this is without a doubt, beyond any hope, the single worse movie I have ever seen in my life. They have destroyed our earth by putting this onto plastic. This movie will be around forever, and a thousand generations from now, someone will find a disk and know that we were this stupidest generation to ever walk the earth because someone put this outstandingly bad piece of trash onto a disk. I feel stupider for watching it.",1348358400,3,624,4.387931034482759
