8193943,5,B000PYXQG6,"1955---SEVEN DAYS OF FALL (2006) is a PBS-aired documentary on the Brooklyn Dodgers World Series Championship, the only one the Brooklyn team has ever won.

1955---SEVEN DAYS OF FALL is a topnotch documentary. It suffers, however, from being too short (only 80 minutes), giving it a ""compressed"" feel. 1955---SEVEN DAYS OF FALL could have easily been expanded to fit a two hour time slot. The Bonus Features (really unused footage) are proof positive of this.

1955---SEVEN DAYS OF FALL is a hard to find DVD, but it is findable and affordable, and if you miss(ed) the Brooklyn Dodger era, this is a must have.

About half of the presentation consists of soundbyte interviews with aging Dodgers players and aging, indomitable fans of the team, which has been absent from Brooklyn now for fifty years, but is still lovingly remembered. It's odd to see these Brooklyn veterans wearing Los Angeles Dodgers livery at commemmoration ceremonies of the Dodgers' first world championship, and wrenching to hear the fans (wearing Brooklyn caps and jerseys and now in their sixties and seventies) recall in ""where they were that day"" tones the excitement of Brooklyn's victory over the Yankees in their sixth such contest together. The heartbreak of Walter O'Malley's selfish decision to uproot the team from its home in 1957 is still palpable onscreen.

The remainder of the film is split evenly between social commentary regarding the United States in the 1950s  and well-restored footage of crucial plays during the 1955 seven game Fall Classic. This is all brought together, and the show is based on, Jim Crawford's eponymous poem, stanzas of which delineate sections of the film.

It becomes clear from watching 1955---SEVEN DAYS OF FALL that the 1955 World Series was not just about baseball, but was about the coming together of two Americas, the America of competence, success and dominance, the ""good"" Superpower (as represented by the pinstriped Yankees), and the America of perseverance, grit, and determination, the ""little guy's"" America (as represented by the Dodgers, aka Dem Bums). If the White Collar Yankees represented a soft-handed Wall Street and Washington, the Blue Collar Dodgers represented the calloused hands of Brooklyn and the small towns of the heartland. Poet Crawford calls it, appropriately, ""a bloodless Civil War,"" and it was in fact a victory of the heart over the mind, a victory sadly made Pyrrhic by O'Malley's cupidity only 24 months later (and THIS is what they admitted him into the Hall of Fame for!)

Although the film closes with the words, "". . . moved to Los Angeles, never to return,"" if the Dodgers' victory of 1955 proves anything, it proves that all things are possible. It's time for the Boys of Summer to come home.",1196726400,16,2758,5.035087719298246
