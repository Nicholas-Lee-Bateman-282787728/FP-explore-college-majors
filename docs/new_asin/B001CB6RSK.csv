8286462,5,B001CB6RSK,"In ""3 Sexy Comedias Mexicanas Vol. 2"" we got another collection of films that are not available separately. The first title ""Las golfas del talon"" (""The High-Heeled Tramps"") from 1979 was directed by Jaime Fernandez and was a sequel to ""Las del talon"" (which is on Vol. 1 of this collection). It was a huge improvement over its predecessor (see my prior review). Here the girls were hot and there was plenty of action too. Once again the sensual beauty of Rebeca Silva came alive in a hot dance and strip number! We also got the sexy: Isaura Espinoza, Tere Alvarez, Pilar Pellicer, Zulma Faiad, Rosella, Princesa Lea, Gabriela Rios, Cristina Campos, Monica Castell, Marcela Bordes, Mariana Montiel, and other vedettes of that era (with plenty of nudity). There was even a small role by Maria Cardinal too. I gave this one 5 stars. NTSC, Spanish (no English subtitles), NR 92 mins.

The second title ""Las perfumadas"" (""The Perfumed Ladies"") from 1983 and directed by probably the best auteur of the Mexican sex-comedy Victor Manuel Castro. This film was a combination sex-comedy and crime-drama, with some pretty violent scenes. It featured the reigning queen of voluptuous Mexican beauty in Grace Renat (to see this woman in the altogether, will make you salivate and pant like a dog in heat!). Anyone familiar with these classic films will know what I'm talking about (the Mexican sex-comedies in the 80's only got better, while its counterparts in Italy and Spain were pretty much done), when I say that the women in these films: including established actresses that had no qualms about taking-off their clothes for the cameras. This one also featured Lynn May, Hilda Aguirre, the always funny Alberto 'El Caballo' Rojas, Pedro Weber 'Chatanuga', the sexy Martha Stringel, Mireya Cantu (who had a sexy striptease), and abundant nudity from our sexy vedettes: Rocio Rilke, Doris Pavel, Gioconda (she was a contortionist of sorts!), Liza Belen, Silvia del Valle, Oyuky, Gabriela Rios, Yolanda Zarco, Claudia Medrano, Agua Marina, etc., etc. I gave this one 5 stars and was by far the better of the three! NTSC, Spanish (no English subtitles), NR 87 mins.

The third and last title ""Solo para damas"" (""For Ladies Only"") from 1981 was directed by Fernando Duran Rojas. This was the only dud among the three (why can't they give us all winners) but considering how good the first two were, it didn't spoil it for me (they should always put the duds first, if they're going to include them anyway). NTSC, Spanish (no English subtitles), NR 83 mins. (BTW: the picture quality by BCI was excellent on all 3 titles, but especially on ""Las perfumadas"". Get yourself a copy and don't let the language barrier discourage you, believe me I think you will figure it out pretty well!)

Love and Peace,
