8001501,4,B0000DZ3BQ,"Welcome to the  great big world of the Little Twins. No taller than a daisy or a mushroom, Piper and Petal enjoy one adventure after another in Krockle, the magical island they call hom. Filled with enchantment and a love of animals and the environment, each story offers the joys of life, family and friendships.

THE MAGIC OF GIVING: In ""A Tim Of Giving"" it's Mischief Night, and Piper, Petal and all their friends are dressed as spirits of the Season.  In return for treats, the ""Spirits"" bestow each home on Krockle with the blessing of abundance for the coming year. But who is that spirit on the other side of the bushes - the one who seems to growl. Then in ""The Best Gift Of All"" spring has sprung! The leaves have returned, flowers are in bloom, Aunt Holly's getting married and Piper and Petal want to find the perfect gift.

TALES OF ENCHANTMENT: In ""The Magic Flute"" Piper and Petal's sleep is interrupted by the incessent sounds of chirping crickets and buzzing bees -- even the butterfly's wings are making too much noise. But harmony returns when the little twins discover the power and beauty of their mother's music. Then in ""Flying"", a squirrel helps Piper realize that believing in yourself makes dreams come true.",1101513600,4,1233,4.668202764976958
