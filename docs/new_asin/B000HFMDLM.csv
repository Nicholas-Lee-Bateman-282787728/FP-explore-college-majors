8139677,4,B000HFMDLM,"I started to view this video with an open mind. After being told that it was nothing like the Bigfoot documentaries being shown on History Channel etc. I must say that absolutely ""NO"" statements were made saying that it was. This video looks into the lives and hints on ideals and theory's of the everyday researcher and cryptid believers that you probably will not see on the television series shows. It was done to simply explain a different point of view other than the same ole Coleman's, Meldrum's, etc. I can't wait to watch part 2 to see who gets interviewed next.",1301011200,,571,4.607843137254902

8139679,2,B000HFMDLM,"This production presents six individuals that have an interest in the bigfoot phenomenon. Some had purported encounters, one of the guys is accused of hoaxing, and then there's Chandra. Ok this has nothing to do with 'proving' bigfoot exists or not. What it is, is a roughly hour long documentary on 'investigators' in the phenomenon. It's a look at the variety of everyday joes that have an interest in this. It's nothing special and the 'educated expert' does nothing more than summarize Ivan Sanderson's book on classifying unknown homonids. You get a former skunk-ape hunter, current skunk-ape hunter/hoaxer, granola girl, educated expert, a guy saying he's a paraphotographer(?!) ""looks into the P/G film, and then pacifist Chandra who wants the bigfoots to study her not vice versa (she's a bit odd).

Overall, nothing to get excited about and it wouldn't hurt you to save your money on this. I found it relatively boring and largely uninspiring.",1201737600,4,952,5.102564102564102
8139680,5,B000HFMDLM,"This is not a film about bigfoot/sasquatch.  It is a film about bigfoot researchers, and their methods.  This is not about what they have found, but an interesting sociological study about what motivates these people.  The producer lets you make up your own mind.  These are quite an interesting mix of people, from Dan Jackson who had a frightening face-to-face, to Carol Ann who is looking for evidence like a wildlife photographer.  I played this to several friends to see what they think.  Chanda came across as pretty freaky and scary, and almost all agreed that Carol Ann was the most interesting and level-headed.  You don't have to agree with them, but you have to respect their ambition to study this.

Another person shown on here was David Shealy.  David has been known as a hoaxer, but he came across as surprisingly candid.  He didn't come across as a raving madman that some people have portrayed him, but talked about local issues like lack of access to areas they would go to at one time.  He was surprisingly candid about his past.  And as the dvd says, you can make up your own mind about him.

One type of bf researcher who was not portrayed was someone who is actively hunting for a bigfoot to shoot and kill one as proof to the world.  I have heard that none of those types allowed to be interviewed.  Those types are very paranoid and don't like outside attention.

But overall, take this as a study of people chasing after a dream and what motivates them.",1186358400,3,1478,4.562737642585551
8139681,1,B000HFMDLM,"I purchased this DVD and was very disappointed in its play quality and content.  The persons interviewed were self proclaimed experts who were unable to provide any substantial information and made the concept of Bigfoot seem as if it were only a hoax.  I strongly do not recommned this DVD for purchase and as the titile of my review uindicates, it is ""Poor at best"".",1159488000,7,368,4.6461538461538465
8139682,5,B000HFMDLM,"This documentary is about six independent researchers, and it's a good one. John L. Johnsen interviews, edits, produces and directs this hour-long documentary, which follows Dan Jackson of Florida, former researcher, talking about his foray into Skunk Ape research (he is now retired from research due to a terrifying experience he had with a creature); M.K. Davis of Mississippi is profiled next, discussing his groundbreaking work into the Patterson/Gimlin film; Chanda (no last name) discusses her habituation research in Missouri, which seems to be controversial to some, but may be credible; Carol Solomon, also of Florida, who describes a dead cow she found which the buzzards wouldn't touch, as well as strange tree and grass formations she has found in her area; David Shealy of Florida, controversial researcher (and possible hoaxer) discusses his activity and research into the Skunk Ape. Lloyd Pye is interviewed last, regarding hominoids such as Bigfoot, Yeti, Almas and other mystery primates all around the world. He gives his uncensored opinions of these events. This is a well-done and well-researched documentary, and well-worth purchasing.",1155513600,5,1157,5.50561797752809
