8685855,1,B00OZOIFEK,"Bad one-liner insult comedy wrapped around very brief and weak horror elements. Nobody seems happy to be in this, and nobody should be happy to watch it.",1517702400,,153,4.703703703703703

8685860,2,B00OZOIFEK,"The film starts off with the murder of a tour guide (Omarosa Manigault) of the fictional Hollywood Movie Murder Museum. It was been decided to make a sequel to ""Freakshow"" reuniting the three stars who are all down on their luck and loath each other. They get together on an isolated island. The three women get along worse than my cats. The film moves quickly into a rather lame ""Ten Little Indians.""

The barbs exchanged by the women was fairly funny in the first scene. The second time they did it, the scene lasted way too long as the humor grew tiresome as I waited for the scene to please end. Rae Dawn Chong plays Jenny, the smart one in the group. She runs an unsuccessful animal rescue. Debra Wilson plays Darian, a woman who spends a lot of time in rehab. Anne-Marie Johnson rounds off the threesome as a promiscuous woman (not the word they used) who was once married to a lord.

The climax of the film was the reunion scene which happened early. The mystery aspect was immaterial, although it does drop soft clues. The humor dropped off a cliff when it revealed it was nothing but an endless stream of tiresome barbs. It was like putting Don Rickles on loop. (Sorry I show my age.)

I am sure there will be a younger crowd who will enjoy the ""insult"" film. I would recommend only as a rental.

8685861,4,B00OZOIFEK,"Knock 'Em Dead is a pretty funny spoof of mysteries with a decent cast. Jackee Harry pretty much stole every scene she was in and even dropped a couple of f-bombs, which was unexpected since everything I've seen her in previously was G-rated.",1425513600,,242,4.651162790697675
8685862,2,B00OZOIFEK,Boring too many sarcastic old jokes not worth the $$$ the comedy not there maybe if they had up to date stars instead of coming out of retirement stars,1421193600,2,151,4.241379310344827
