8139802,1,B000HIP3YS,"Living a Zombie Dream (1996)

 I honestly don't know what to say about this one, beyond the intriguing title.  How can you review a movie that lacks any of the ordinary threads that talented people weave into an interesting story, a story about people we can identify with and understand?  To say that Living a Zombie Dream wasted the film it took to make it, and my time to watch it, seems much too kind.  Lets count the ways.
 The acting is rubbish of the worst sort.  Man, the main character says almost nothing throughout the entire film.  And nothing makes him change his expression.  He comes home one day to discover that his brother is having sex with his girlfriend.  His expression does not change.  He takes his brother out to another part of town and forces him out of his car only to see the brother bashed on the noggin by a nut case.  His expression does not change.  He later watches his brother's brutal murder.  His expression does not change.  He murders the murderer.  His expression does not change.  His brother and the nut case come back as Zombies.  His expression does not change.  Unlikely this.
 Amon Elsey, who played Man, had the good sense to never make another picture.  The other actors might be marginally better but are still so bad that we cringe seeing them.  Michelle White-girlfriend-, Mike Smith-brother and Frank Alexander- psycho all made other films with director Todd Reynolds, but they should have known better.  Director Reynolds cannot direct his way out of a wet paper bag.
 The story is more or less random as we see in the very worst Zombie films and written by the same Todd Reynolds that directed.  A bunch of the footage is supposed to be some kind of dream sequence but we have a very hard time sifting the real from the dream.  Not the least because there is almost no dialog at all.  The expressionless Man meanders around doing stuff or having stuff done to him while we have little sense of his purpose.  The whole thing is tedious to watch. The last thing we want in a Zombie flick is boredom, but we get what we get.  When things shift from boring they shift to disgusting flesh eating.  Not that we care who gets devoured because we don't.  Most of the victims remain strangers and even the victims that we know we don't have any real connection to.
 Most of the film is shot indoors or at night and is so dark that we can't really see clearly.  In the few daylight scenes the Zombie make up is pretty good but spotty.  Sometimes it is pretty bad.  The occasional prosthetic blood squirt and good quality wounds are about the only decent things about the movie, and that cannot and does not carry the film.  A pot of guts bubbling on a stove is not a 'special' effect.
 The director in his wisdom prefers to re-run snippets of already seen film rather than go to the trouble of inventing something fresh to shoot.  I suppose it was meant to reflect the recurring thoughts of Man as he pondered the death of his brother or of watching said brother thumping Girlfriend.  Once was sufficient, thank you.
 This R rated, terrible film gets a mere one half brain, and that only because I rather liked the neck wound on Girl Zombie.
 Somehow this bucket of blood and guts nabbed an alleged six nominations at something called the B-Movie Theater Awards.  Hard to believe.
 Fans have no reason to watch Living a Zombie Dream.  None, zip, nada, zero.",1441670400,,3401,4.513957307060755

8139805,1,B000HIP3YS,"Living a Zombie Dream: 1 out of 10: I know this kind of movie. You know this kind of movie. We all do.

That kid or two in high school who wanted to become a famous movie director and got some friends together to make a film. Raised some cash from local business and parents and showed their masterpiece in the local theater one Saturday night. One of the best documentary films ever made ""American Movie"" is about kids just like that. The difference is that those kids' movie, after being viewed by friends and family, went into a trunk with the Boy Scout pictures and old report cards. This film was released on DVD.

The other difference is that those kids probably had more talent. A lot more talent. Living a Zombie Dream is a youthful (and not so youthful) embarrassment to all involved. The script is a mishmash that is almost completely without dialogue or logic. After hearing the ""actors"" line readings one can at least understand why the director Todd Reynolds stayed away from actual conversation.

Instead we have a soundtrack that sounds like something a World of Warcraft clan uses to promote its best battles on Youtube. The director also seems to be afraid of light. Every scene is bathed in darkness rendering any attempt to follow the wordless story even more difficult.

Also a personal note to lead actor Amon Elsey that's not how you kiss a girl and the less said about the sex scenes or your haircut the better.

So if you are related to director Todd Reynolds or own the house whose front yard this movie was filmed in I'm sure you have already seen it. Everyone else should stay very far away.",1259020800,4,1618,4.546391752577319
