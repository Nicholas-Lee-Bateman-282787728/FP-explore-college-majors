4242896,5,B0041KKYK6,"Gould's trajectory from hot young superstar to serious oddity-genius has elements of tragedy, and I suspect is instructive in a way that eludes me.  Genius Within is excellent in telling Gould's story.

Knowing the biography, there were still many discoveries in the film for me.  I would have liked more clinical review, even if speculative.  What were the specific meds that he was unwisely mixing?  Ever a behavioral diagnosis?  The documentary only glances at Gould's aversion to touch, which was major (e.g., there was extended litigation with an admirer who clapped Gould on the back.)

Unlikely that any Gould enthusiast will be disappointed with this documentary.  Gould's psychological dynamic probably relates to being the only child of older parents.  His deep genius, I suspect, will continue as mystery.",1299974400,38,816,5.3125
4242897,5,B0041KKYK6,"This is a truly great documentary that is basically a short biography of Glenn Gould (nearly 2 hrs. in length).  I didn't realize that there was so much film footage available of this man who was (supposedely) so shy and unsociable.  The footage that has been selected is both informative from a purely biographic point of view and from a philosophical/psychological one.  When the documentary is over, we have a very good understanding of the life and personality of this man.  And, it is not skewed to making Gould look like some sort of musical ""god.""  Rather, we get to see both the good and bad of his persona.  Fortunately, most of it is good!  And his piano playing, to quote one of Gould's closest friends, Cornelia Foss, was ""superb--no, BEYOND superb!"" As a pianist myself, I do not share Gould's taste for some types of music, nor do I feel that he played certain styles of music (eg., Chopin, Grieg) well.  But, he had his own ""niche"" and exploited it with an incredible technique and a solid understanding of the music.",1293580800,5,1032,4.631868131868132

4242899,5,B0041KKYK6,"Pianist Glenn Gould's name is common among the older generation of classical music lovers but is rarely mentioned today, though his recordings of the Goldberg Variations stands out as the best performance examples of this work. A child prodigy in his native Canada, he made his debut at age 15 and when the executives at Columbia Records saw his Carnegie Hall debut - at age 23 - in 1955, they signed him immediately to a recording contract. At age 37 he gave his final concert and moved on to producing audio documentaries for the CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Company). He experimented with ""new music"" and even dabbled in ""pop"" by producing a documentary on British pop singer Petula Clark!

This in depth film - running nearly two hours - includes lots of archival film as well as interviews with nearly every person relevant to Gould's life. All of these are connected by audio and video interviews done with Gould during his lifetime.

I only knew of the artist through the award-winning film ""21 short films about Glenn Gould"", but he was still an enigma to me. After watching this film, I now know as much as we can hope to know about this introverted, eccentric but immensely talented musical artist.

4242920,4,B0041KKYK6,"I just caught Genius Within last night on the PBS American Masters series. By the way since Gould was born and lived all his life in Canada how can he be an American master? But there it is. In any event  a self-professed classical music buff, I never paid much attention to Gould because of his severe interpretations and the repertoire he played (my tastes trended more to Van Cliburn). Most of what Id read and heard about Gould implied he was an extreme version of the reclusive, self-centered artiste: eccentric, cranky, paranoid, anti-social. As other reviewers have pointed out, more Horowitz than Rubinstein, at least psychically, and perhaps artistically, so.

And certainly those aspects are present in this sympathetic documentary, but also the human side which was in its way fairly normal, albeit with his share of quirks. What we see is an inquiring mind out of step with the uncertainties  and restrictions  of the music business, but also an affable, chatty, (sometimes) relaxed, often funny human being (case in point being the Ernie Kovacs-esque characters he impersonated in goofy home movies.) As the program implies Gould was truly a Renaissance man who happened to play the piano supremely well. Not only a Renaissance man but something of a visionary: Goulds ideas anticipated what we now accept as part of everyday life: Photoshop, CreateSpace, digital cameras, editing and altering movies to suit our tastes.

Perhaps rightly so, this program raises more questions than it answers and further reminds us of the enigmatic nature of genius. My purely musical-critical comments: I was most impressed by Gould's uncanny, and unerring, sense of rhythm.",1403568000,,1672,5.132352941176471

4242943,4,B0041KKYK6,"A lovingly put together film showing Glen Gould in all his contrary waywardness. His earlier efforts at being a concert pianist in Russia or in America. He is shown at a Bersntein-conducted event in which Mr Bernstein has to give a preliminary address to the effect that he has had to allow Mr Gould to have a leading say in how he would play the music in a way that Bernstein did not agree with. The clash of two geniuses. Gould is held in deep respect when he tours Russia,captivating audiences,he is the young maestro,bring the best of world composers,and pours himself out completely like a genius of great gifts for their benefits. There are statues of him in familiar garb that are shown throughout the film. He was an only child and was given a lot by his parents.

Gould gave up concert playing at a young age,devoting himself to recording music or doing documentaries that showed man's solitary nature,usually in the far north. The film details his earlier influences,an early piano teacher of great merit,in Toronto who showed him how to play flatly with his fingertips. This is accompanied by interviews with fellow colleagues and friends. His self presentation is eccentric:long overcoat, gloves,scarf and flat cap,wherever he takes himself. He put me in mind of one of those supersuave personas Jerry Lewis adopted in some of his films. He was suave, elegant,debonair,witty,given to bouts of humour, taking on different disguises in photos. He also took a rolled up bed and the same small stall everywhere he played.

Gould had to rise to publicising his musicianship and is shown taking on different yet characteristic poses in publicity shots and photographs. Gould's mother is shown being concerned about the place life is taking him to, especially as regards relations with the opposite sex. Glen has normal heterosexual needs and likes women a lot and is shown to befriend women he meets on his journeys. However because of the demands he places on himself,he would have been difficult to live with. However Glen loves animals and children. He lives with a married woman, Cornelia Foss for 4 years who has separated from her musician husband. Her children love him and he's affectionate to them. He watches Get Smart on TV with them and knows all the plots. He also makes one documentary on the `folk songs' of Petula Clark,intriguing! Clark says she wish she could have met him. He obviously had a crush.

Glen is shown to be an innovator in music,bringing new ways of interpreting the classics,giving Beethoven or Mozart different time schemes to revivify the music. He is shown in lots of documentary footage walking in the depths of nature often byflowing rivers,moving his arms like a composer as he walks along,or strolling on a beach. He was a bit of a hypochondriac,often recording his physical obs obsessively,and taking a heavy cocktail of prescription drugs(too many)for anxiety/depression. When he was about to learn a piece at home on his 1st take he often played with the TV and radio on full blast and asked the housekeeper to hoover too,this was to prevent him losing his concentration! There is an ultimate mystery about the man,his eccentricities often drowned his personality and he was a control freak. But if you want to see the man behind the music,this film reveals the man behind the icon.",1395360000,2,3331,4.902482269503546

4242947,4,B0041KKYK6,"It's a labor of love to recommend ""Genius Within--the Inner Life of Glenn Gould"", the new DVD that hopefully will expose a new generation of music lovers to this extraordinary pianist.

For me, who as a clueless young piano student considered Bach spinach and Debussy chocolate, the late Canadian wunderkind's supreme achievement is his Bach--vibrantly alive, but also often tender, always timeless.  If money is an object for you in the new year, you could start your GG collection with both the 1955 and 1981 Goldberg Variations (both in the DVD ""Glenn Gould--a State of Wonder""), the Partitas, Well Tempered Clavier and Art of the Fugue.  If you are a curious reader, there's a treasure of information about his tempestuous life in ""Glenn Gould, a Life and Variations"" by Otto Friedrich, ""Wondrous Strange"" by Kevin Bazzana, and ""Glenn Gould, the Ecstasy and Tragedy of Genius"" by Peter Ostwald.

4242949,5,B0041KKYK6,"The filmographer unintentionally documents Glenn and his friends living with his attachment disorder.  This thoughtful film portrays common truths, it is our attachment story too.  The creators accurately capture attachment disorder and how it impacts Glenn's: close relations, gift/craft of artistic expression, metabolic physiology, sensory over stimulation, complexities of group interactions and public performances. It is a complete revelation of a gifted person with attachment disorder that has been misdiagnosed.  While he had the benefit of a few safe people, he like many of us, lived in a society of professionals and well meaning (unsafe) humans who can't resolve their own attachment dysfunctions and blindness that follows.  If you are far enough along on your healing journey, or want to understand attachment disorder watch this film in the company of compassionate people to reap the full benefit of Glenn's beauty and grief.

4242982,5,B0041KKYK6,"A close friend recommended this documentary to me, and though I've greatly enjoyed Gould's recordings, particularly the works of J. S. Bach, it completely changed my views of this remarkable man.
  Previously, I thought Gould's life exemplified a pattern to be avoided, a mentally unstable man who became a hypochodriac, co-dependent, overwhelmed by his own intellect and quandaries, a recluse, antisocial, who died at far too young an age needlessly. Gould seemed the antithesis of the great pianist Arthur Rubinstein, a well adjusted man who enjoyed a long life,
established a stunning, fruitful career in music, and who was a great father and husband, and found how to reach his audiences both on the concert stage and left us a legacy of fabulous recordings.
  ""Genius Within"" provides a judicious, dispassionate look at Gould's redeeming qualities, and they were legion. A fascinating man, the first to recognize that recordings were essential and could best represent playing music as it should be played, that all musicians play differently. I would have liked to know him, and learned his eccentricities, hypochondria and mental instabilities only manifested in the last few years of his life, and were more a media creation than representative of Glenn Gould, who loved so many aspects of life. This documentary portrays views from his friends and peers, and, sharply contrasting to other DVD's I own, ""32 Short Films..."" and ""The Alchemist"", both somewhat disturbing and/or tedious, is a product I highly recommend to anyone wanting to know of Gould and more about the value of music.",1355270400,11,1594,5.190661478599222

I very much enjoyed this film, as most Gould fans will, but was somehow left with more questions than I had going in. Maybe that's okay and even for the best, but areas I'd like to have seen explored more in depth---certain relationships, his addiction, his philosophies---were given less space than certain other relationships etc, things I found much less germane to my love of the man's music.

It would have been nice to see more of the early Glenn and less of the latter, as his semi-tragic ""downfall"" rarely stirs the musical soul like his early triumphs (but the '81 GV are sublime), and the focus on the incidentals (the scarves and hat and overcoat, blah blah) detracts from the glory of the music at points.

There are nonetheless many fine nuggets of Gouldiana here for any fan or even casual listener. Some of the clips of him playing, as in the Eaton's studio, have moments of sheer beauty, and those alone are worth seeing this for. Likewise the love of some of his friends, though their sadness and confusion with him almost seems pointless when we could be hearing more of what really mattered: the music!

All too human being: check.
Totally unique pianist: double check.
Which matters more? I'd say the latter times a thousand, and that's the inner life I'd like to know more of via more music and interviews with Glenn, and less from those who knew him. Because after all, how many of us know anybody else's real inner life? It's all conjecture. Clearly some of these people did not really ""get"" Glenn, so their theories left me high and dry more than once.

But I loved seeing and hearing Gould himself, and the joy he took in playing. That's where the juice is, and for the moments this film shows Gould in his element we see that after all it was the music that mattered most to him. And us.",1323129600,32,1824,4.531914893617022
4242986,5,B0041KKYK6,"Though much remains to be disclosed, the information about Gould's very early years is rare, and fascinating.  One would wish for more, despite the feeling of prying into personal information he clearly did not wish to appear before his public.",1319155200,5,244,5.1
4242987,5,B0041KKYK6,"This is an amazing film. Pairing this with ""32 Short Films about Glenn Gould"" is a great look into the life of Glenn Gould. What amazed me about this film was how NORMAL Glenn came off. It was also very revealing to see those early videos with him in the studio.",1318896000,10,262,4.1568627450980395
4242988,5,B0041KKYK6,"This film about Gould, which plays itself out in the spectator's mind long afterwards, is as provocative as the indie experimental film, ""Thirty-Two  Short Films About Glenn Gould,"" is lifeless and pretentious.

Both Glenn Gould and Bill Evans lived for 50 years, they knew and respected one another's work, they played the same piano on separate recordings, and both hastened their ends through addiction to drugs.

But soon it's the differences that become more apparent than the similarities.  At one point in the movie, a former lover of Gould's is asked if the notorious eccentric could ever be ""romantic"": after a long pause, she answers: ""Sort of.""  The same might easily have been said by one of Bill Evans' lovers.  But Bill was the epitome of the Romantic artist, so preoccupied with the ""truth and beauty"" (not just Keats' but his own terms) attainable through the creation of music, that no woman or human relationship had a prayer of standing between him and his art. Even in the absence of corporeal substance, Bill, fueled by cocaine and his quest for expressing the truth and beauty from within, managed to play eight consecutive nights of music that--though recorded without his knowledge (and less than a week before his body's complete collapse) and released 20 and 25 years after his death--comprise 16 CDs' worth of some of the most mesmerizing, haunting, deeply gripping music ever improvised by a jazz musician.

Glenn Gould, by contrast, gave his 200th concert (not even the equivalent of a year's worth of performing on an Evans' itinerary), and stopped concertizing at the age of 31 (shortly after Leonard Bernstein gave his (good-natured) public ""disclaimer"" before conducting a highly unorthodox Gould performance and after I had the opportunity to hear him--along with the singing and creaking chair--in person.

Glenn Gould's life thereafter was a performance of a different nature.  He had done enough to proclaim his ""genius"" and establish a sort of cultish following.  He now devoted his life to scripting every moment, refining his skills as perhaps the greatest ""performance artist"" of them all (prior to Madonna and Lady Gaga).  From his endless re-editing of his recorded performances to his taking notes by the hour of his blood pressure to his increasingly scripted interviews (for which he insisted on writing his own questions), he came to resemble the obsessive-compulsive personality of a Howard Hughes--except that Glenn's fans ""knew"" about his idiosyncrasies.  And Glenn knew that they knew, relishing the attention even as he proclaimed his loathing of concerts and the people who attended them.

Glenn was more of a prodigy than Bill, though neither was particularly drawn to practicing.  Bill got all the practice he needed while playing in public night after night.  Gould preferred to rehearse by ""reading"" his music away from the piano and may not have required much practice--in fact, may have even been the more authentic and inarguable ""genius.""  But Bill was by far the more influential artist, the difference between the two as marked as the contrast between Gould's mechanical ""finger-tapping"" technique and Evans' powerful, emotional sonorities (his broad shoulders and huge, thick fingers comprising a physical apparatus capable of making virtually any piano pour forth room-filling, singing tones).

Glenn identified himself with George Santayana's ""Last Puritan"" (a wholly rational species); by contrast, Bill Evans was the last Romantic, identifying himself early on with the French Romantic impressionist composers Debussy and Ravel and later with the dark and existential latter-day Romantics surfacing from his own Russian ancestry, roots long buried deep within his psyche.  Gould sought nothing less than perfection, and no doubt realized his goal while becoming more anally retentive with each passing day.  Evans sought not perfection but the expression and creation of truth and beauty.  As a result, his life was untidy and messy.  His personal problems, along with his influence on all who came after him, make it hard to associate the man himself with that overused, devalued term ""genius.""  About his life's work, on the other hand, there can be no doubt: the music, from the early Vanguard sessions to the Keystone Corner ""last stand,"" is the very essence, if not irrefutable proof, of genius.",1309219200,15,4368,5.2277936962750715
