8248902,2,B00132SVW8,"This is a much re-edited version of Will Zens's ""The Starfighters"" starring Bob Dornan, with new opening and closing credits slapped on to it.  The film itself has not been remastered and is grainy and quite low quality.  Neither Zens nor any of the actors are given any credit for this.  This DVD might be of interest to fans of Mystery Science Theater 3000.",1452211200,,359,4.578125
8248903,1,B00132SVW8,"I had wanted to purchase this DVD for awhile since I flew the bird in the Air Force. It was an awful decision as the film is based on a incomprehensibly goofy plot, of all things. I enloyed shots of the airplane, but the storyline was boring and poorly produced. Don't waste a dime on this thing!",1232150400,,296,4.2105263157894735
