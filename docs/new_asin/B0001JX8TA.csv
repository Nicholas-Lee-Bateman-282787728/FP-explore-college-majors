8013265,5,B0001JX8TA,VHS. Loved the movies but the tracking wouldn't adjust. That was a little disappointing.,1472256000,,88,5.357142857142857
8013266,5,B0001JX8TA,"This video is terrific! The twin cubs (Tubby & Tuffy) get separated from their mother and spend a summer getting into all kinds of hilarious incidents. My 8 yr. old son gets a kick out of animal antics, & he laughed and laughed. It's just too bad there aren't more ""good, clean fun"" videos out there like this one!
The otter video is also pretty interesting, but the Yellowstone Cubs are hard to beat!",1461196800,,401,4.4324324324324325

8013269,5,B0001JX8TA,I figured that this would be beat to hell since it is old but it arrived in very good condition.  The picture quality was still good and was really the only one I could find.  I was very pleased.,1334620800,,195,3.9743589743589745
8013270,5,B0001JX8TA,I truly enjoyed watching the films on this VHS.  As the stories were viewed I remembered very pleasnt childhood memories of watching the films with my sibblings and parents.  The tape was in wonderful condition.,1322352000,,211,5.0
8013271,5,B0001JX8TA,I love these old movies! Disney at it's best. It's been hit and miss for them for a few years now. Too bad ol' Walt isn't around any more and Roy still isn't in charge.,1239580800,2,168,3.8285714285714287
8013272,5,B0001JX8TA,"If you have kids, or even if you don't...this Disney double feature is a must.  The Keystone Cubs(1st feature) is classic Disney fare.  The things these bears do...especially at the end is just Down right funny. The part when they are hitting up cars for food is just as humorous.  Then there are the cubs driving the motor boat.  I love this movie.  Rex Allen is the narrator.  He does a great job and did a lot of movies for Disney where he was just the narrator.  His voice is great.  Ours is worn to a frazzle and Disney desperately needs to put these great epsiodes on DVD.  The second feature ""Flash"", about an otter is equally good.  These are wholesome movies you can set before your kids and not have to worry about them seeing something that would pervert them.  I am a Christian father and am very careful about what my kids watch.  You can't go wrong with this gem...buy it and you won't be sorry!!!",1127088000,7,911,4.357142857142857
8013273,4,B0001JX8TA,"Disney animal stories are the most fun to watch. They were able to showcase the personality of animals in such a unique way. This video features 2 of their television episodes. The first is ""Yellowstone Cubs"", a theatrical featurette from 1963 that was later shown on the ""The Wonderful World of Disney"" TV show for the first time in 1965. It was popular enough to be re-shown 3 more times over the next 10 years. Placed in Yellowstone Park as the name implies, it is about the adventures of 2 bear cubs who got away from momma bear, while she frantically searches for them.

The second story was a theatrical featurette shown before the main feature in 1965 It had already shown on television in 1961 on the weekly television program which is the reverse of the usual method of showing their programs in theatre first.  ""Flash the Teenage Otter"" and his sister are born into a nature reserve, where their mother teaches them how to survive. The frolicking of the otters is a delight to watch. This is an educational, exciting, and fun nature story. Disney studios had a way of filming real life activity in the wild and adapting it to an interesting storyline with narrative and music. Our whole family enjoys this one and recommend!

I highly recommend this video and others in the series. Disney released many other titles from the TV episodes, just search on Amazon under ""Wonderful World of Disney"". The Yellowstone Bears episode was released on DVD in 2008.",1111449600,11,1463,4.70703125
