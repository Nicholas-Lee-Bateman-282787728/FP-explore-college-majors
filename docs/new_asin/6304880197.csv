7879125,1,6304880197,"I purchased this thinking it was the PBS ""Great Castles of Europe"".  It was not.  It was very amateurish with a lot of just watching the host walking.  Much better production quality available for free on the internet.  We did not finish watching it was so poorly done.",1523923200,,269,4.541666666666667
7879126,2,6304880197,There was nothing in the book about specific castles. I would not recommend it to anyone having a serious interest in European castles.,1494720000,,135,4.913043478260869

7879128,1,6304880197,"Not much scholarly information in this. Castles are not identified or used as examples of any style or features. Robin Hood legend is used as opener.  Repetitious statements about general use and life in and around the castle. Not very interesting, poor narration, and annoying music.",1449360000,3,284,5.173913043478261

7879130,2,6304880197,"This is not was I was expecting. I wanted a DVD that *identified* various castles in Europe and told something about them. This video showed lots of castles but did not say which ones they were or give specifics about any particular castle shown. It was general information about why castles were built (to protect, and later to impress) with information at the end about various kinds of weapons used during the time period.

I would have been helpful to me to have the description from the back of the case, so here goes:

""Across Europe the landscape is littered with the remnants of a bygone age. An idealized, romantic period of chivalry with glorious buildings and mighty kings. Beautiful castles can be found in every country along rivers, atop mountains and at the heart of medieval cities. But the truth is much more sinister. From the very beginning, mankind has waged war against its own kind. Over millennia he has developed weapons to kill more and more people. Running parallel to this he needed to create methods of self defense. The castle is the ultimate symbol of that protection for lords, fighters and ordinary folk. It evolved at the weaponry advanced, and amazingly, it is still in use today. From awe inspiring forts high on hilltops, to fantasy style castles with moats and mounds, all kinds of styles emerged, all over the medieval world, to combat all kinds of foe. An amazing tale of innovation formed from the darkest element of the human condition - war. Crenelations, Machicolations, Hoardings, Motes and Baileys, what does it all mean? Journey with us across Europe and the Middle East as we discover the history, beauty and power of the castle.""",1440633600,9,1677,4.819444444444445
7879131,4,6304880197,"A low flying four stars here for this Discovery Channel series on some of the greatest pieces of military architecture from the European Middle Ages.

The series takes the viewer across a range of nations and to a variety of styles of fortification. Some of the castles covered have quite elaborate histories which are delved into and it has to be said that while some of the castles shown were very much gritty combat oriented structures others seem to have been more external projections of wealth and power. Some indeed appear to have been utter follies. It makes for a nice blend of styles and brings to bear the affects of the differing social and political climates prevalent at the time of the building of the respective structures. Military buffs should probably be forewarned that there is not a huge emphasis on battles or sieges in this series but they will still be able to feast their eyes on a range of fortifications from across Europe.

There is a disclaimer on the back cover of the DVD version stating that due to the age of the source materials some issues may arise during DVD playback. Admittedly some loss of sharpness appears to have been brought about by the transfer from the original VHS but it isn't too bad for all that.

A worthy addition to the military buffs DVD shelf or for those with an interest in such large historical structures.",1376524800,,1366,4.659751037344399
7879132,5,6304880197,"I really enjoyed the series on these castles when it was on TV.  I was thrilled to find the VHS tapes.  I got them promptly, they were well-packaged, and I've already watched the first tape after receiving them this afternoon.  Thanks!!!!",1312761600,,238,4.7560975609756095
7879133,5,6304880197,"I use this series in my History class and watch as it really brings the past alive for my students.  They especially enjoy Castle Dracula and the Grey Lady of Glamis Castle.  My only complaint is that more castles aren't included.  I believe I remember when this was on TV, they did include more castles.  I would be interested in getting the additional castles.  This is well worth the investment for any teacher of History.",1147996800,3,425,4.613333333333333
