8601985,5,B00E6ESSD2,"It would certainly be difficult to follow up an underground masterpiece like Maximum Shame but in Gallino, The Chicken System Atanes produces a film that at the very least comes close to equaling that brilliantly bizarre and surreal experience.  In Gallino he dismantles even the parameters or contours of an underlying unified narrative that subliminally inhabits Maximum Shame, instead opting for a system of almost random scenes that embody a common theme and that somehow move through the contextual matrix provided by a young man named Alucinio (Octavi Pujades), who has traveled to  Antarctica to meet a woman he met in a dream; and the Poulterer (Manuel Sols), the middle-aged proprietor of a chicken shake in the middle of frozen nowhere as they engage in wide-ranging dialogue and disputation concerning the multi-dimensional nature of the universe, sexual Magick, dreams, and anal sex.  At one point The Poulterer even produces a kind of map that appears to reflect and mirror the structural principle underlying the films unfolding.  Overlapping, interpenetrating, reflecting, yet independent episodes that occur with no discernible sequence, at least in a conventional narrative-development sense, but that do perpetuate a sense of compulsive attempts to understand the nature of the universe or either simultaneously or conversely to wield power over others via wealth (An ""American"" uber-capitalist entrepreneur who dominates his French-theory spouting feminist critic with the erotic power of money and fried chicken) or other modes of discourse.  The film proceeds from one tableaux to another mocking various aspects of culture, the institutions of high art, media, and sexuality.  Indeed, each discreet sequence culminates in an encounter that mimics the dynamics of pornographic sexual encounters, with chickens substituing for the more obvious human body parts.  There are uncomfortable moments where the coercive nature of many pornographic sexual encounters is mirrored by the female character's submission to male compulsion to consume or interact with meat in question.

Letting go of your need for resolution or an experience you can easily explain to yourself is a prerequisite for enjoying Gallino.  If you want to be spoon-fed simplistic and easily comprehended images, stories and ideas, then you should be looking for Hollywood fare.  If you're willing to take the experience as it comes then Gallino has the capacity to shock, puzzle and captivate you.

It is sadly true that an influential though obtuse reviewer can harm a film's chance for finding an audience.  This is true for professional critics working at magazines and large websites and no less true for amateur reviewers on sites like this one.  There is no doubt that Gallino is the kind of film that will divide audiences, you may love this film or hate it, but unthinking and reflexive dismissal is not justified by the evidence of the intelligence and creativity that clearly went into the making of this film, albeit on a very low budget.

For you adventurous souls who possess the abilities to set your preconceptions aside Gallino may definitely be for you.

8601986,5,B00E6ESSD2,"Carlos Atanes does it again. With a film that has no boundaries and also at first glimpse seems to be totally insane, he somehow grabs the viewers attention. One of the reasons might be the sympathetic and capable actors and actresses, but then again its the everlasting surprisingness and no holds barred approach to filmmaking. In this case, its lovable. You might hate it, too.

Atanes calls Gallino, The Chicken System as a pornophilosophical film. I cant deny or agree. Using chickens as a metaphor for penis is effective and some might see it disgusting. I just say it dropped my jaw. There are so outrageous scenes that you cant stop smiling. Again: you might hate it, too.

Gallino, The Chicken System looks great visually and like in many Atanes films, the man just can direct unknown actors and actresses. Because of that, the bizarre plots just seem even more bizarre. Once again, a cinematic experience youve never witnessed before. I say thumbs up. Read more from emvg.net",1391040000,,985,4.857142857142857
8601987,5,B00E6ESSD2,"Carlos Atanes may definitely be considered to be one of the most talented underground directors in Europe today. The term underground is used for a reason: in this context the director has total freedom to unleash his pornophilosophical weltanshauung. The setting could not be more original: a poultry farm in Antarctica, where a wanderer named Alucinio and the Poulterer discuss about love, flesh, chicken, sex and the other fundamentals of life. Octavi Pujades' character reminds the viewer of the constant disorientation felt by Orpheus in Coctaeu's cinema, while the short digression into the world of commercialised chicken has echoes of Jodorowsky of Fando y Lis and The Holy Mountain. There are no words to describe the performance of Manel Solas, known to mainstream cinema for his role in Balaguero's The Nameless, and present in Atanes's previous movies FAQ and Codex Atanicus. He is the true axis around which the whole film develops, a philosopher, a madman, a poulterer, an opener of gates to new dimensions and perceptions. Special mention must go to Maria Kaltembacher, producer and actress extraordinaire, whom we can only hope will work with Atanes again.
Before the release of Gallino, I thought Atanes had reached his peak with Proxima, which I also highly recommend. Here reality and fantasy are blurred to an unprecedented degree, and something amongst the surreal topics discussed in the film almost make you think that you are about to receive a (porno)philosophical enlightenment. Whether that does happen by the end of the film, is left to the individual viewer.
Yes, Atanes is an underground movie maker and Gallino is the quintessence of what every underground film should be: visionary, free from dogmas and daring to push the limits. Atanes's Gallino achieves this, and more.",1390953600,,1804,5.202749140893471
8601988,5,B00E6ESSD2,"Carlos Atanes is an important filmmaker in the independent scene. He has a truly unique vision and manages to make entertaining, surreal, philosophical and stylistic sci-fi movies that really can't be compared to much else. That's a good thing! I have often referred to Atanes as one of the premier names in underground filmmaking and I think GALLINO, the Chicken System proves why. Though it's certainly not a movie for the mainstream viewer, but that much should be expected. If you do want something extraordinary out of your viewing, something that'll twist your mind but also keep you completely entertained throughout, then this is a great choice.",1383868800,,653,5.11214953271028
8601989,1,B00E6ESSD2,"The other reviewer is obviously linked to the film considering they have only one review and its for this piece of dren. Unwatchable, pointless, no direction. It's like something that was pieced together off a failing ""Art"" students trash can..",1377561600,,244,5.125
