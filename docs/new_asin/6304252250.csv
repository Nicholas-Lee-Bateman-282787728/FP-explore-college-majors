815496,1,6304252250,"I bought this movie because I find muscular women attractive and exotic.  This movie featured a very fit character, named Ravinhawk, but it did not meet my needs.
There is only one scene where the beautiful Ravenhawk flexes her muscles, and it's breif.  Moreover, her back is turned and it's during the night, so you don't get a very good look at her sexy back.
There is no nudity, and the movie is poorly made.  The story seems unbelievable, and does not really come full circle.  Scenes where she beats up much smaller and weaker men with her bare hands would have made this movie much better.
Don't buy this movie if you want to see a lot of female muscles.  Sorry guys, it's a let down that way.  I recommend Skin Deep for those needs, though that's only a breif scene too, but it's revealing.",982454400,3,797,4.424657534246576
815497,5,6304252250,"Rachel Mclish is totally AWESOME!!!  Rachel reminds me of a Greek Goddess.  She packs a punch in this movie.  Although, her lines are few theirs lots of action.  She doesn't really need to say much.  The movie is not only avenging her murdered parents, but about government corruption, special interest, collusion, and a toxic waste site on Indian Land.
Rachel, sophisticated,cool,calm,& collect, gets the job done as she eliminates the competition, or should I say SCUM.  Payback, is much deserved.  Way to go, Rachel!!!",970099200,6,521,5.130952380952381

7865662,5,6304252250,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie when I first saw it on VHS, back in the nineties. Previously available on DVD in Australia, it has yet to be released on DVD in the United States. Not everybody would give this low-budget movie five stars, but I choose to because I still find it enjoyable and also because Rachel McLish is a better actress than people give her credit for. Note: this Polish-released DVD is in English, but despite bearing the words REGION ALL, it will not work in all DVD players sold in the U.S. or Canada.",1453507200,2,523,4.458333333333333

John Enos 3
Directed: Albert Pyun
Writtern: Kevin Elders
Producer: Ron Samuels
This movie is not a blockbuster, but I liked it. Mostly because of Rachel McLish. It is a tale of a young indian woman (Rhyia Shadowfeather) forced against her will to commit horrific acts of violence against her parents.  Developers desperately try to pave the way to their planned nuclear waste facility on Shoshone land by killing tribal leaders and framing others for stabbings and the like.  Authorities are convinced of her slashing her parents and she is sent to an asylum.  Fifteen years later Rhyia is being bused to prison when a large bull standing on the road causes the bus to jump the rail and tumble down a gully, bursting into flames. Most would perish, but Rhyia ia no ordinary woman.  She has sculpted her body to a fine edge while at the asylum and looks like a champion bodybuilder.  She is powerful enough to match blows with a man and sets about to find the one who butchered her parents and framed her.  She is on the hunt with her eyes rolling with hate.  Rachel doesn't say much in this film.  It is as if she brought that into the character Rhyia.  As in spite of her beautiful face and body, she is just about half crazy with contempt.  So Rhyia sets out one by one to settle the score showing at times almost superhuman strength in doing so.  There are some effective scenes as she sprints about in the desert.  She takes them out by boat, motorcycle, tomahawk, leaping while being dragged by horse.  Her muscle pose in the cave is effective and atmospheric.  One comment: they say always give the audience what they want.  Rachel shows too little of her body most of the time.  Not nudity, but the audience I'm sure would like to see her back, abs, legs, lats, and other body development characteristics of such a fit woman.",1398211200,2,1846,4.548484848484849

7865665,4,6304252250,"this is one of my favs, and it is hard to find, it reminds you of how the indians had it and how they were treated and how they suffered. it is often time forgotten how it was for indians, this one and thunderheart are very good stories on the indians. you have to cheer her on to get revenge for her parents death, this is a nice little gem, a typical 80 flick.",1317340800,,362,3.9054054054054053
7865666,4,6304252250,"Bought this movie for someone else, but I have seen it  and liked it. It has a good story line, plenty of action",1299801600,,112,3.869565217391304
7865667,2,6304252250,"Well, I think just about everyone agrees Rachel McLish had a much better bodybuilding career than an acting one. In this Class B action film, she's the female equivalent of Arnold Schwarzenegger in his first action movie, ""Conan The Barbarian.""

Of course, Arnold made an incredible career out of his acting and has gone on to bigger and better things. This was it for Rachel, acting-wise. Oh, well, at least she was a two-time Ms. Olympia winner.

To McLish's credit, she looked good in the film which was made when she was about 40 years of age. How many 40-year-olds do you know are in the shape this woman was here? And, in her defense, the person who wrote the dialog for this film didn't help her out much. The screenplay is really lame. Not many actresses would look good with dialog this dumb.

Basically, what we have here is another simple revenge tale, and not one that is well-done. Not recommended.",1239667200,,911,4.611111111111111
7865668,2,6304252250,"The directing in this movie sucks.  The kids and I were like the little robots on MST3K during the whole movie.  The directing was so bad we couldn't stop commenting on it and watch the darn movie.  If Rob Taipert or Joss Wheadon directed it with the exact same cast it would have been one of the hottest female action films around.  This director didn't capitalize on Rachel's striking beauty and her physical ability to do the stunts.  Her character is very Xena and Buffy like with a dash of Linda Hamilton.  The story was OK and entertaining.  I don't blame her and the other actors for the ""average"" acting and schizophrenic photography.  It was the director's fault.  It's almost as if he had ADD or something. Amatuer.  And where's the really cool outfit Rachel was wearing on the cover of the video box?  I think all the cries for nudity would be quelled if they just put her in that outfit with scenes where you could really take in her looks and expressions. CAN WE PLEASE DO THIS MOVIE OVER AGAIN WITH A REAL DIRECTOR?!",1144800000,,1030,4.483870967741935
7865669,3,6304252250,"Raven Hawk was a bit of a disappointment, considering the makeup of the cast: John de Lancie (Star Trek's Q) and Mitch Pileggi (Walter Skinner from the X-Files) among others.  The film brings to the screen the story of an Indian girl whose parents were murdered by agents of a large coorperation, which wanted to build a nuclear waste disposal plant inside an Indian reservation.  If that wasn't enough they framed the girl and had her convicted of her parents' deaths.

In short, the acting is about average, the dialogues are below average, while the plot is above average and quite interesting; the common denominator being ""average.""

Some of the reviewers were expecting nudity and were let down resulting in quite a few low review scores.  To that, one has to add the poor dialogues and the bad choice of lines that many of the actors were given: ""She remained primitively tied to her Indian culture."" No comment is required on the use (or misuse) of the word ""primitive"" here.

As for the rating, it's not really R-Rated material as it is PG-13; no sex, not too much violence, very little blood.

In a nutshell, Raven Hawk is a low budget film and it clearly shows.  It's an okay movie, and that's about it; No masterpiece here...",1113609600,4,1237,4.668202764976958
7865670,5,6304252250,"This movie was great! The storyline was excellent and very true-to-world. Rachel McLish, was superb! She didn't say much, however... she didn't need to. Actions speak louder than words.",1101772800,2,185,5.413793103448276
