5708113,1,B00C9LNTPQ,"Okay, so I'm looking for a funny movie to watch tonight and this one comes up with a four-star rating. The preview looks pretty entertaining. I order it and sit back to enjoy myself, which I indeed did. Seems like someone said, ""I know! Let's make a movie in Santorini so we can take an all expenses paid trip there! Wouldn't that be fun?"" Well, Santorini was the only star here as it was the only thing that came off looking good. Poor acting. Horrible script. But for some reason, it was entertaining to see just how horrible it could be. People . . . 4 stars? Really? What the hell were you smoking?",1400025600,13,602,4.2894736842105265
5708114,1,B00C9LNTPQ,"If you like comedies that are not funny, this movie is for you. The lead actress is hot but there is nothing else memorable about the movie.",1399593600,2,140,4.222222222222222
5708115,5,B00C9LNTPQ,"Fun story. Loved the setting. Great acting and directing.  Great performance by Matt Pnepinto, and the rest of the cast!",1392422400,,120,5.0
5708116,5,B00C9LNTPQ,"Sweeping, eye candy views of Santorinis caldera and beaches form the backdrop for this engaging romantic comedy. Also shot in New York City,  Panepintos feature film directorial debut does not disappoint as the story takes viewers on a journey in which the principal characters embark on their individual paths to self-discovery. Plot twists and turns will keep you engaged and guessing all the way to the end of this globe-trotting tale of love, loss and redemption.  A star-studded supporting cast (including Law and Order veterans: Dann Florek, Richard Belzer and Ice-T) delivers an unforgettable performance in this indie gem!",1389744000,,630,5.353535353535354
5708117,5,B00C9LNTPQ,"This is a really cute movie that my wife and I loved watching for our date night.  We did a Santorini themed night with Greek food and Santorini wine.  If you have lived in New York and vacationed in the Greek isles, you'll love it.  The cinematography is spectacularly framed - like a series of paintings.  The shots of Santorini are breathtaking.  The acting is light and funny.  This isn't a heavy movie.  It was fun to watch the cast from SVU flex their comedic acting skills.  If you want to take a mental vacation from life for a few hours and are a fan of Law & Order buy the movie.  You'll enjoy it!  PS: The movie pairs wonderfully with a bottle (or 2!) of Domaine Sigalas Assyrtiko.",1388880000,3,692,4.294573643410852
5708118,3,B00C9LNTPQ,"I bought this movie before taking a 10-day vacation to Santorini in August.  It struck me that the movie is nothing more than advertising for a hotel in New York and one in Santorini.  It's so blatantly obvious, that I wonder who owes what to whom in real life.

The casting is good, except for the male lead.

There's not too much in the way of mainstream scenery in the DVD to make up for my negative review.  Sorry!",1377993600,8,418,4.2405063291139244
5708119,5,B00C9LNTPQ,"To write a story and visualizing the characters while doing so, and then playing out the female role that you just wrote, is truly an art.  Deirdre Lorenzo displays this beautifully in her movie as you see her acting out the part of the shattered wife in Santorini Blue.

Beginning in a modern USA city, the story takes you on a wonderful trip to Greece where most of the story takes place.  As the story develops, the beautiful photography of Santorini,Greece makes you want to book airline tickets there immediately.

It was interesting seeing many television stars acting in a movie and taking on different roles from their usual characters on television proving that acting is just that .

For an evening of entertainment pull out the wine glasses or hot chocolate cups, fill your bowl with hot popcorn and sit back for a
story of good acting, beautiful scenery and a good feeling that you spent your movie time well.",1374537600,3,921,4.695652173913044
5708120,5,B00C9LNTPQ,Santorini Blue is a fun movie about NYC-Greece love.  Cute and light with a lot of familiar actors.  I really enjoyed it,1373328000,2,120,4.409090909090909
5708121,1,B00C9LNTPQ,"Wow, that was painful to watch! Probably the worst movie I've seen ever. Acting is worse than in an adult film. Seriously.",1481241600,,122,4.590909090909091
5708122,1,B00C9LNTPQ,"Pity they didn't film Ice-T throwing the script into Santorini's volcano then looped those thirty seconds for 90 minutes because that would've been more entertaining than this movie. Stilted dialogue, awkward directing, totally charmless leads. Just terrible. We kept watching mainly because we were shocked the thing actually got made. If you're in the mood for Mediterranean with a side of quirky, watch Paul Mazursky's Tempest. Or Mediterraneo. Or Mama Mia. Anything but this unappealing mess of film.",1480032000,,504,5.4743589743589745

5708128,1,B00C9LNTPQ,"The lead actress was by far the worst actress I have ever seen in my life, it was painful to watch.  Pretty ironic she wrote and produced the movie, no doubt that's the only way she could ever be cast. Save your money. Ps. One star because it was required.",1431475200,,256,4.12
5708129,1,B00C9LNTPQ,"santorini blue. what a misbegotten piece of garbage. And I don't care how many law and order alums were featured here- one has to wonder how they've managed other past roles if this is the best they can drag out for a feature film. Direction is non-existent, and a singularly most unattractive, geeky looking main protagonist with wandering ways still in his hanes cut berriefs.  I lasted at least 45 minutes before I just had to turn it off. Not recommended for humans to watch much less rate at four stars/ Some dude out there is toking the bad stuff, since this film practically begs to be turned off after the first 10 minutes. Gross performances all around, despite having at least some things good: the view.",1423353600,4,714,4.622047244094488
5708130,1,B00C9LNTPQ,"As a traveler to the Greek Islands on several occasions, and sometimes with tour groups, I could really relate to the movie which definitely captured the problems tour leaders often have.  I had seen the movie a few times before and just had to have it on DVD.  It was great to have been at the same sites where the film was shot and the actors were superb.

The above review was for ""My Life in Ruins"" , which I had just purchased, and deserves 5 stars.

Santorini Blue was a pretty poor film in most every aspect.",1420329600,,515,4.224489795918367
5708131,2,B00C9LNTPQ,Wonderful concept if only the script writing was better and the comedic relief wasn't there.,1420156800,,92,5.2
5708132,1,B00C9LNTPQ,"The only star in this movie is the island of Santorini! Minimal plot, no chemistry between the 2 protagonists, terrible, unrealistic dialog, This is probably the worst movie I have seen in the past several years.  I did enjoy the many Law & Order SVU alums in the film, but their casting was totally unbelievable.  Dan Florekk played a typical Hollywood sleazeball womanizer, Ice-T was miscast as a therapist, with his wife Coco playing his assistant (I totally missed this one- I only saw her name in the credits), Richard Belzer played a foul-mouthed producer (with a cute dog at least). In one of the opening scenes, Felix, the main character, a scriptwriter/movie director, sneaks off for a roll in the hay with his mistress.  This scene was so cliched I thought I had mistakenly cued up a porno film! With wooden dialog, and a film-making technique that could only be likened to watching a daytime soap opera, I am literally at a loss to coherently describe why this movie failed on so many levels. Felix's mistress is so similar in appearance to his wife, that I thought they were the same person for the first third of the movie.  Felix's character was unlikable, with his heavy black glasses (to make him look more intellectual, perhaps?) and womanizing ways.  His relationships with the women in the film were shallow due to the poor writing of the script, mirrored in his character's inability to finish the script he was writing in the film.  Viewers deserve a medal if they last through the end of this film. My one word summary: TERRIBLE!",1418947200,2,1551,4.725925925925926

5708135,3,B00C9LNTPQ,"I'm being generous with three stars, but Santorini and Ms Lorenze were nice to watch.  I would describe this as a depiction of the mating rituals of the Hollywood rich 1% who can frequently jet off to the Aegean on a whim.  Watch as a blonde bombshell is alternately wooed by her selfish philandering husband, a young womanizing player, and an obnoxious geezer.  The oleaginous Panepinto must have cast himself as the leading man, because he obviously didn't get the job through talent or good looks.",1411344000,,500,4.790697674418604

Had to wonder if this was a school project because all of the associate producers listed?

5708147,1,B00C9LNTPQ,I could only watch it for about 15 minutes.  The acting was so bad it was almost funny.  The main male character who was suppose to be a ladies man was so miscast!

I don't normally take the time to write a review like this, but I decided to because I was quite taken with this film.  What a pleasant surprise!  The performances are all skillful, and the lead actress did an especially wonderful job in her role.  The well written story, combined with seeing some familiar (and some not so familiar) faces kept me invested the whole way through.  If you have the chance to see this, go for it.
