8056610,5,B000924K4Q,"This is the kind of film that the French do very well:  small budget, simple scenario, excellently acted, ending not with some kind of obvious wrapup, but with ambiguity that the viewer must resolve his/herself.  Whether you like it or not is personal.  Some people ""get it"", some don't, and I mean that without pretension.

A beautiful disheveled woman blunders into an office, assuming she is with a therapist but in fact the man is a lonely tax accountant.  She unburdens herself, later discovering her mistake, but they continue to see eachother.  Meanwhile, the staid, stalled life of the accountant is revealed, and the woman realizes that he needs her as much as she needs him.  They begin a relationship, which his disapproving, matronly secretary finds puzzling and then irritating.  There are many funny moments, all told with a subdued intimacy that is never overplayed.  There is a hilarious scene where a phobic man, whom the woman is helping with kindness, finally overcomes his fear and howls with pleasure, disturbing everyone in the building to their bemusement.

There are many threads left hanging.  They do not develop a simple, vanilla romance, as the viewer would expect with a yawn from hollywood.  The woman may be lying about certain things, there may even be some danger, or mental illness.  The characters evolve, but what happens is far less explicit than american audiences would expect, and so must be limned by clues.

I quite enjoyed this film and would recommend it.  But it isn't for everyone.",1333324800,,1527,4.956692913385827
8056611,4,B000924K4Q,"Anna (Sandrine Bonnaire) enters an old office building, goes up to the sixth floor and rings the buzzer to be lead into the office of William (Fabrice Luchini), a Tax advisor. Anna talks pretty much non-stop about her marriage, her brutish husband, and her lack of sex life. Then stops, gets up and leaves: having embarrassed herself by her ramblings. There is a problem though: Anna thinks that William is her new therapist and William, seemingly so fascinated with Anna that he says nothing to the contrary even going so far as to schedule another appointment for the following week.

Director Patrice Leconte has plowed this territory before especially in his ""Man on the Train"" and the ruse succeeds for as long as it needs to as William comes clean to Anna early on in the film. Nonetheless, Anna continues to spill her guts to William and a sort of friendship develops between the two.

Most of ""Intimate Strangers"" takes place in William's stuffy conservative office and Anna is dressed in layers of dark colored heavy clothing. But as she blossoms from the benefits of her ""analysis,"" her makeup, hair, clothing becomes lighter and more revealing: obvious but effective. William also changes and there is one odd though funny scene of him dancing solo a la Tom Cruise in ""Risky Business"" to Otis Redding's ""Try a Little Tenderness"" that has to be seen to be believed.

""Intimate Strangers"" is a strange little movie that expects a lot from its viewers but just manages to stay on our good side by treating us like we have some intelligence and taste. Though it teeters on the edge of facetiousness, it doesn't ever make the leap over.",1127692800,,1642,4.774647887323944
