The only disappointment is that it stopped after the second season? However to be fair all loose ends were completed, just wish there was more.",1493424000,,226,4.794871794871795

8653210,5,B00JQ5SZPC,"Everyone raves about Orange is the New Black  but fans of that show really need to see this series, which showcases superior writing(Julie Geary of Coronation Street, proves she's brilliant once again), smart plots, exceptional acting. This is a quirky character-driven drama that will have you watching ""just one more episode"" then another, and another. Acorn's two-season complete collection introduces the women left behind when crimes have sent the men in their lives behind bars. Interwoven storylines show how the spouses, mothers, daughters and girlfriends fare as they struggle to sweep up the mess and move forward. Emma Rigby, Polly Walker, Pippa Hayward and Natalie Gavin are the stars of the first season, and Sally Carman and Karla Crome join Haywood and Walker in Season 2. All give strong performances as they unravel the reality of membership in this odd little circle where, unlike a book club or quilting guild, their only commonality is that of being a connection to a jailed male. The 10-episode set chronicles their efforts to live their own lives while wondering about a post-prison future. Addictive and highly watchable, this series will have you rooting for the women and realizing their strength.",1465430400,,1222,5.2030456852791875
8653211,5,B00JQ5SZPC,"Prisoners' Wives Complete Collection.  This BBC television serial, a crime drama, is for fans of ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK. As written by Julie Geary, (SECRET DIARY OF A CALLGIRL, CORONATION STREET), the production  examines what happens when a criminal goes to prison, which is, of course, only the start of the story for the women in the  criminals life. This engrossing drama, in several interweaving storylines, follows the wives, girlfriends, daughters, mothers who are left behind to show up on visitors days. In Series 1 of this complete collection, heavily pregnant Gemmas (Emma Rigby, ENDLESS LOVE) perfect life falls apart when her husband (Jonas Armstrong, ROBIN HOOD) is arrested for murder. She finds herself becoming part of a strange sorority including glamorous Francesca (Polly Walker, ROME, CAPRICA), wife of career criminal Paul (Iain Glen, one of the few actors to star in both GAME OF THRONES, DOWNTON ABBEY); struggling young mother Lou (Natalie Gavin, THE SYNDICATE); respectable widow Harriet (Pippa Haywood, MR. SELFRIDGE). In Series 2, Francesca and Harriet are joined by bride-to-be Aisling (Karla Crome, UNDER THE DOME) who hopes her father will get out of jail in time to walk her down the aisle; and by mother-of-three Kim (Sally Carman, SHAMELESS), who is working  to try to prove her husbands innocence of career-ending charges.

The series is set in Yorkshires Sheffield, a town not often seen on film: last picture I can remember that was set there is a big favorite of mine, THE FULL MONTY.  And I swear I recognize a certain bench on a hill overlooking the city, which is lovely from this point of view.  It is a character-driven  ensemble piece,  in which all the characters are well-developed, none clich&eacute;d. It is intelligently written, well-acted, with a quiet humor.  As Francesca and Paul, Walker and Glen carry it, but  are supported by a strong featured cast, including David Bradley,(the Harry Potter films, GAME OF THRONES), Adam Gillen, (OLIVER TWIST), Adrian Rawlins,( the Harry Potter films), Anne Reid,(CORONATION STREET), as Margaret, Pauls accountant,  and Nicola Walker , (so superb in LAST TANGO IN HALIFAX, SCOTT AND BAILEY, also(MI-5)).  The episodes are:

Series 1:
Episode 1.  Lovely, nave Gemma thinks she has the perfect life: beautiful home, doting husband, baby on the way. But her world comes crashing down when her husband, Steve, is arrested for murder.

The box set, which I received as a review copy, consists of four DVDs containing 10 episodes for approximately 608 minutes.  It offers subtitles, thank goodness, for those of us unfamiliar with Sheffield accents.  And it contains violence, coarse language, nudity and sexual situations, not for children or the sensitive. This is a thrusting, gripping gritty drama that begins strong and ends with a bang.  Each episode is centered on one of the main women, shows what she has to do to get by without her man; the way the women cooperate and help each other is moving. Of course, I love a female-centered drama, which this is, but my husband loved it too, and we binge-watched it as best our lives allowed. Recommended.",1459555200,4,6592,5.092764378478664
