7989492,5,B0000950YN,"I was looking for ""Warm up with Traci Lords' Advance Jazzthetics"" video and took a chance with this DVD. I'm so glad I did because it's exactly the one I was looking for. All the videos in this DVD are just a compilation of 80s and 90s (?) workout videos. On one side you have two Traci Lords workouts, both are basically the same workout but one has more repetitions and she ""sings/raps"" you through the ; I find this one a little annoying. However, the ""advanced"" version on the same side only has some music and no talking. I can't say just how much I love this workout. It's great for slimming down the back and torso area especially. Some of the movements can be a little jerky but if you only follow the body movements and not her head movements you should be just fine. If you want an hour workout that'll get your heart pumping and your muscles burning without being too strenuous, then this is the video for you!",1400716800,,921,4.329479768786127
7989493,3,B0000950YN,"This review covers only side 1 of the DVD, the Jazzthetics workouts. This video makes exercise fun. I really like the synthesized jazz music. It really gets you into the rhythm of working out. On the Warm Up, Traci Lords narrates with a funny motivational rap for each exercise. TL really demonstrates great mastery of these exercise moves. Flexibility and endurance can improve by doing these exercises.

The reason I only rate this product 3 stars is because of the quality level. It is obvious that this DVD has been transferred from a VHS tape.  There is picture and sound distortion at times. They should have made the DVD from the original studio master. :(",1324166400,,663,4.756521739130434
7989494,4,B0000950YN,"i actually bought this for my mom because she had the exact same one that stopped working.  she loves it, and uses it every day.  it's pretty much like any exercise tape from the 80's.  nothing fancy.",1303862400,,200,4.351351351351352
7989495,4,B0000950YN,"This is low impact exercise, yet very effective. Gives you quite a lot of stretching and exercises all body parts. The first workout has some annoying poems but the second is without any words except transition to indicate change of exercise. This is very useful since you don't have to look at the screen. Tracy Lords looks somewhat disturbing...",1111363200,6,347,4.898305084745763
7989496,3,B0000950YN,"This DVD contains both the ""Warm Up With Traci Lords"" and ""Advanced Jazzthetics"" complete Traci Lords exercise videos from the 80's. There isn't much to say about the actual workout, but if you're a Traci fan, this DVD is essential.",1107561600,10,232,4.825
7989497,4,B0000950YN,"If you like jazz music,you will like this dvd.  It is designed to burn cellute through intensive wholebody workout.  You will get a good result if you stick on it.",1089590400,2,163,4.4
7989498,1,B0000950YN,"I bought this DVD thinking that it would incorporate jazz dance moves into the routine.  It does nothing of the sort.  Instead, I was totally blown away at how BAD it really is.  Ex-porn star Traci Lords looks hilarious doing these moves with a trying-to-look-sexy gaze.  She voices over the workout, yelling really cheesy, rhyming, ""cheerleader"" type chants...very annoying!  The music is not only 80s, like the other reviewer suggests, but reminds me of a really bad porn movie soundtrack.  It got to the point where I had turn the DVD off after the first 10 minutes, I couldn't take any more!  The other side was just as corny, the music being so horrible that I couldn't focus on the routine; it just wasn't enjoyable.  I do not recommend this for anyone, advanced or not...there are too many bouncy, choppy movements that could injure anyone.",1084924800,11,847,4.793103448275862
