8173088,4,B000MVKZ1Q,"DEADLY BREED (1989) - Early PM (Richard Pepin/Joseph Merhi) Entertainment production that delivers in the way only PM could. A crooked Police Captain (William Smith; MERCHANT OF EVIL - 1991) assigns brutal cop Kilpatrick (Addison Randall; HOLLOW GATE - 1988) to form a group of bigoted, violent vigilantes to combat street crime in a less-than-legal manner. Liberal parole officer Jake Walker (Blake Bahner; SPYDER - 1988), who believes every ex-con deserves a second chance, gets personally involved in this whole mess when Kilpatrick and his squad kill two of his parolees at jobs he just placed them at. It becomes apparent very soon that Kilpatrick and his squad act more like a white supremacy group than a band of crime vigilantes, as they seem more interested in killing Mexicans, Chinese and Blacks (in one scene, a bunch of Latino and Chinese men are lined up against the wall and repeatedly shot, St. Valentine's Day Massacre-style), no matter if they are crooks or law-abiding citizens. As more people of the non-white persuasion end up murdered (In a GODFATHER [1972] inspired moment, we watch an assortment of non-Caucasian citizens being murdered while Kilpatrick plays a classical tune on his piano), Jake seeks help from the police when more of his parolees end up dead, but the cops refuse to help him. The Police Captain (they really should have given him a name!) orders Kilpatrick to stop the killings because Jake is getting too close to the truth (""We don't kill cops, especially white ones!""), but Kilpatrick disregards his orders and has vigilante member Mr. Lewis (John Grantham) kill one of Jake's white parolees, Albert (Ron Moss), with a No. 6 piano wire. Kilpatrick and his team execute a search warrant at Jake's house and plant a gun that killed some of his parolees. Jake is arrested, but released after Kilpatrick makes a not-so-veiled threat against him and his wife, Lana (Michelle Berger), letting Jake know how easy it would be to set him up for his wife's murder. The Police Captain finally relents and orders Kilpatrick to kill Jake when he comes too close to uncovering the truth, but Albert's female cop sister, Alex (Rhonda Grey; TWISTED NIGHTMARE - 1987), joins forces with Jake after she becomes Kilpatrick's partner. Kilpatrick rapes and strangles Lana and plants evidence at the scene to make it look like Jake was responsible. When it is revealed that Jake's best friend Vincent (Joe Vance; L.A. HEAT - 1988) is involved in the conspiracy and tries to kill Jake, Alex shows up in the nick of time and shoots Vincent in the head. With Alex working from within the system and Jake working from the outside, they systematically bring down everyone involved in the racial killings (it turns out that Alex and her dead brother Albert are Jewish) in a hail of gunfire and dynamite, first at Kilpatrick's junkyard compound and then at the Police Captain's office.  Though rather restrained in the violence department until the bloody finale, director/screenwriter Charles T. Kanganis (CHANCE - 1990; INTENT TO KILL - 1992) maintains interest throughout thanks to a fast-paced script that touches on racism, religion and righting wrongs, as well as some unexpected flourishes in photography and editing. Don't get me wrong, this is strictly B-level stuff all the way (some of the sound recording is particularly bad) and contains a prerequisite topless lovemaking scene (Hey, I'm not complaining!), but DEADLY BREED is an energetic action flick that doesn't sacrifice story for action. Also starring Ron Ramirez, Robert Gallo and Kipp Shiotani. Producers Richard Pepin and Joseph Merhi still hadn't finalized their PM Entertainment VHS label at the time of this film's home video release (most of their previous films, such as EPITAPH [1986] and DANCE OR DIE [1987] were issued on the City Lights Home Entertainment label), so they co-released it with RaeDon Home Video. It is also available on budget DVD from Platinum Disc (It's long OOP, but still pretty easy to find). Not Rated.",1369958400,,4022,5.0299850074962515
