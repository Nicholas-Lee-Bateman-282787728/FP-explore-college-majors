4334411,3,B004DTLKHG,"A very entertaining thriller that is marred by a surprisingly poor transfer to blu ray. Since most of the action takes place in a dark subway tunnel, there are many pixelated scenes that do not appear to be of blu ray quality (or VHS quality) for that matter. Some scenes are fine- others great- but this discs inconsistencies in quality are too hard to ignore. Good movie though, it's like ""Wrong Turn"" in a subway tunnel.",1304467200,2,423,4.578947368421052
4334412,3,B004DTLKHG,"STAG NIGHT is a creepy journey into the tunnels of underground NY.  Refreshingly, the victims aren't sex-starved teens, but twenty-somethings.
The cast, led by Kip Pardue, Vinissa Shaw and Breckin Meyer, are quite good and the direction captures their underworld battlefield.  It's gruesome but not overly so.  While not a classic, it's a notch above most cookie-cutter flicks.",1299110400,3,377,5.4655172413793105
4334413,3,B004DTLKHG,"Stag Night is a new horror film that has a fast pace, some decent gore, good actors, and it doesn't waste much of your time running only 78 minutes sans closing credits. But it's pretty much a remake of The Hills Have Eyes or Wrong Turn, only set in a subway station. There is nothing new to see here. It's still a notch or two above that dreadful I Spit On Your Grave remake I saw last week, though. At least Stag Night has some characters to care about.",1298851200,2,455,4.123595505617978
4334414,4,B004DTLKHG,"In olden times, the night prior to his wedding, the young groom would be sent off into the forest to kill and bring home a stag, to prove he could provide for his family. Now it's about proving your manhood through imbibing massive quantities of alcohol, and looking at strange, naked women. How dangerous can a night out with friends be?

In Stag Night, groom Mike (Kip Pardue - The Wizard of Gore) is out with friends Carl (Scott Adkins - X-Men Origins: Wolverine), Joe (Karl Geary - Hysteria: The Def Leppard Story), and troublemaking brother Tony (Breckin Meyer - Clueless), to slay the modern day deer before his nuptials to Brita (Vinessa Shaw - The Hills Have Eyes). While moving to another club our stripper bound boys meet two young ladies, Michele (Sarah Barrand - Footballers' Wives) and Claire (Rachel Oliva - Dark Reality), and in the course of trying to pick them up, Tony manages to get pepper sprayed, and the group pries open the subway doors and exit for fresh air. Do I really need to tell you what happens next? I thought not. Now the stranded travelers are walking back to civilization, and split up at an abandoned station. Introduce feral, cannibal, subway family (Sorry Jerrod). And now our gang is forced into a series of running, hiding, getting caught, escaping, and fighting back episodes.

Stag Night could be a horror movie clich in the vein of The Hills Have Eyes and Wrong Turn, but the majority of the flick takes place in the subway system, shot in Bulgaria, which is a myriad of tunnels, intersections, and abandoned rooms. This system lulls us into a false sense of security, thinking that tunnels must be a straight shot between stations, and therefore easy to navigate; not an urban maze in which adults become lost and disoriented. Add the foreign design and you have an unusual journey.

Stag Night is from the Ghost House Underground imprint, and is responsible for bringing new writers, directors, and actors to the front of the horror genre. This movie, while rough with a clichd theme script, is actually an intriguing movie. The characters are somewhat your standard group of lost travelers, though Tony has some interesting moments, as do Michele and Claire. And while there are only so many things you can do with wayward travelers and inbred families, but the subway setting is especially creepy and confusing, and the subway family is an unknown factor. They are dirty, cannibalistic, and seemingly inbred, but there is another dynamic with them that is unique, and unexplained. Maybe the tunnel dwellers could shed some light on them.
I like this movie. It's not a great movie, but it is unique, entertaining, and every time you watch it you see something you hadn't before. The subway family is also an interesting aspect to this film, and I think it deserves a sequel so their origin can be explored. But I could be wrong. This movie won't be for everyone, but it's for me.",1298678400,4,2925,4.753937007874016
4334415,3,B004DTLKHG,"Did Ghosthouse only put out 2 movies this time?

I don't know if Ive just been watching too many horror movies but as of late alot of them just seem to be meshing together into one thing.  Que in group of buddies add a couple randoms, BOOM! crazy hillbillies/cannibals, add chase sequence, people die in the regular order, couple of shocks then end.  I decided to pick this one up after I was surprisingly pleased with another ghosthouse movie (Trackman I believe, kinda similar premise too)  I took a gamble and picked this one up.  And surprisingly enough I got a pretty nice experience out of the movie.  Now if you're looking for something original or anything like that you might want to skip this one by.  But if you want a pretty nice horror movie with good production values, some pretty nice scares, good acting, and no cliched shock ending give this one a go.",1298073600,4,869,4.532051282051282

There really is not much to say about this one.  VERY GOREY!!!  For a ""Ghosthouse"" horror movie it actually is not too bad though.  The best way to describe it would be if the creatures from ""I am legend"" and ""The Descent"" lived in the New York subways.  If you are into gore and a decent story this would be a good pick up.  I give it a C.

Another reviewer refers to ""Stag"" as a slasher movie.  That's not really fair.  I think of a slasher movie as having a single monstrous human or humanoid using various sharp, heavy, or pointy objects to eviscerate teenagers with the temerity to have sex or smoke pot.  ""Stag"" is nothing like that, because it's more of a contest or battle between two ""tribes"" from early on, and the focus is not on the killings--although for those who appreciate a little gore with their suspense, ""Stag"" does not disappoint.",1297987200,2,2368,8.676229508196721
4334418,4,B004DTLKHG,"I just got this today and popped it in.
What I got was a great Slasher movie about Four guys ,Two of them brothers and Two exotic dancers  coming home from a Stag party on a NYC Subway train. It gears up after Breckin Meyer's character gets maced by Vinessa Shaw's character for being a complete jerk  and they have to get off the train because of the mace.

Problem being it's the last train for hours and they end up getting stuck in the NYC subway so they have to venture into the tunnels. What they encounter are people that have lived in those tunnels for years maybe decades, some much more evolved than others. They run into four cannibalistic Neanderthal looking sub humans that roam the tunnels looking for victims to eat and oh they they also share bits and pieces with the wild dogs that they have housed in their humble abode that looks like a human butcher shop,but not at all clean or tidy. This is when the real fun begins.

Kip Pardue,Breken Myer,Scott Atkins,Carl Geary and Vinessa Shaw are all excellent in their roles,the casting was very well done. If Vinessa looks familiar it's because she played the oldest daughter in the Hills Have Eyes remake. Stag Night is heavy on the gore which is always a plus,  the lighting was well done and you could actually see what was going on most of the time.

It's  brutal and fast paced,not at all a hurry up and wait to get hacked up feel to it,I want to watch it again already.
There are some endearing moments as well so it isn't without any sentiment or meaning.

I usually don't care either way but viewing this I decided that I actually did like being endeared to a couple of these characters this gave it all the more impact. There are some really good fight scenes and a couple of surprising moments that lent to the flavor of the film..If I have one complaint and the only reason I held back a star and gave it 4 instead of 5 was the ending. I want to just pretend that I didn't see the last Ten seconds,BUT I did. I still give it 2 thumbs way up. Just think Creep meets Wrong Turn.",1297900800,5,2050,4.306493506493506
4334419,3,B004DTLKHG,"Just when I was starting to enjoy the annual offerings from Ghost House Underground, as opposed to those offered by say the After Dark Horrorfest, it looks like the films released under said banner are dwindling.  This year's edition is only offering two films so far (Stag Night along with Psych 9) which is disappointing, but thankfully, Stag Night isn't half bad.  A bachelor party goes from good night to nightmare when the groom to be (Kip Pardue), his troublemaker brother (Breckin Meyer), a stripper (Vinessa Shaw), and some others all run afoul of a crew of underground cannibals when they accidentally get off mid-stop on the subway.  What follows is the usual brand of chasing around with blood flowing aplenty, and for what it is, Stag Night surprisingly works.  The acting isn't bad, the bloody bits are satisfying, and there's even a bit of genuine surprises as well.  Still, it isn't perfect, but Stag Night offers no more and no less than what it is, which is a not half bad horror/slasher flick that delivers most of what horror fans look for in the first place.",1297728000,8,1078,4.74331550802139
4334420,4,B004DTLKHG,"STAG NIGHT

I have liked all the ""Ghost House Underground"" films for the most part but I think this one is among the best. I have watched this one more than the others thus far and each time I find it enjoyable. The best and quickest way to describe this film is that it is ""Wrong Turn"" in the subway. All the cannibals and kills you would hope for in this kind of flick. Also a ""Stag Night "" is a bachelor party.

Four friends are out for a night on the town doing the whole bachelor party thing. One of these guys will be getting married soon so his friends and brother are taking him out. They meet up with some ladies and head into the subway. Once there something seems wrong since no train is coming. So they hike down the tunnel only to witness the murder of a police officer. Sited they make a run for it and the killers are hunting them down one by one in the tunnels.

I really enjoyed this movie although it is nothing new really, we have had the cannibal and tunnel movies before [here's looking at you C.H.U.D.]. But the kills are cool and there is some suspense to be had, loved watching some friends that came to Austin watch this. Those ladies are easy to scare [love it]. This film was written and directed by Peter A. Dowling who most might know as a writer on the Jodie Foster flick ""Flightplan"". There were missteps and logic issues in the script [see that opening scene] but over I liked it. As for the direction I liked his style and felt it made the film seem a little more realistic.

The acting here was good and I think Breckin Meyer needed a role and film like this since he is usually casted as the nice guy. Speaking of that I will add that some people may be turned off by the lack of wanting to care for the characters they may feel. There isn't much to root for here except maybe one person. Still over all I had a good time with this flick and it is one of those movies that is better to watch with friends or something.",1377648000,,1953,4.145118733509235
4334421,5,B004DTLKHG,i was very surprised by this film i have been watching these ghost house pictures and this one was very good although the lead guy really pissed me off at the end what an idiot,1363392000,,176,4.057142857142857
4334422,1,B004DTLKHG,"Cannibalistic, machete wielding, homeless men, living in the NYC subway system, where they raise families, keep farm animals, and can tap into electricity and cable tv. Yes, this movie is THAT bad! I don't mind a gorefest, but this movie wasn't even scary. There was zero character development, as they spend all of about 10 minutes on a background story. It's just a bad movie, basically just a chase through the subway tunnels. We all know what's going to happen! What a waste of time!",1361664000,,487,4.741176470588235
4334423,2,B004DTLKHG,"""Stag Night"" doesn't off up a whole lot of surprises for genre fans. The basic format of the film is take the movie ""Wrong Turn"" and set it in the subway tunnels instead of the woods.

A group of friends out celebrating a bachelor party find themselves stranded in the subway tunnels under NYC with a couple girls they meet on the train. Unfortuantely for them, they share the tunnels with a homicidal cannibal clan of homeless people. The movie is chock full of horror flick cliches; the honest and honorable groom-to-be, and jackass best friend who causes the group more trouble than he's worth, the slut, the tough girl, and hapless guy who plays phone videos of his young kid, and the horny guy.

So if you are looking for something original, ""Stag Night"" isn't for you. We get the same stock characters that have milked since Michael Myers first appeared in 1978. I will say that the acting is a notch above the usual B-Movie grade, Breckin Meyer in particular plays the ""jerk"" very well.

The reason ""Stag Night"" really loses points for me is that the director doesn't seem interested in showing us the gory parts of his film. When someone has the unfortunate experience of meeting one of the cannibal homeless, the film suddenly gets all jerky, and ""Cloverfield-ish"". The director swoops and scans over the scene as if he's suddenly developed a horrible case of Parkinson's Disease. This choice is jarring to say the least.

I don't really recommend ""Stag Night"" for a purchase as there are so many other genre flicks that cover the same ground, but do a much better job of keeping the view engaged.",1351209600,,1606,4.6643109540636045

4334426,3,B004DTLKHG,"Stag Night isn't one of the more appealing slashers out there because of a few annoying problems.  First of all, the storytelling aspect is abominable.  It's so cliched that it's not even remotely interesting.  A group of young men meet a couple girls on a subway train and one of the guys in particular tries to hit on the brunette, but gets turned down by a shot of mace directly in the face.

From here, both the men and women get off the train in the middle of nowhere and find themselves surrounded by a gated fence.  Of course it's late at night, so they search for help.  Well apparently the blonde doesn't have a problem hitting on the one guy from the group that she finds attractive, so a quick kissing and sexual scene happens next.  To me this is totally dumb from a storyline and rational point of view.

While walking around, the other guy continues to criticize the brunette because of the mace shot earlier... and he does so in the most horrendous and immature way imaginable.  It was a childish way of putting someone down, and the brunette was basically acting the same way by responding with the same insults.  Bad writing.

The biggest problem I have is with the actual slashing segments.  They consist of camera shots darting around from many different angles which means the viewers will struggle to witness and feel the suspense and excitement as it occurs.  That's something I've always disliked in horror movies, and it feels cheap.  We want to *see* the murders as they happen, not struggle to search for them thanks to tricky camera angles making everything a blur.

The monsters are basically overgrown, scruffy bums who have experience swinging around enormous sharp blades.  They lurk deep in the darkness of the subway and remain there until a fresh set of victims become a part of their twisted game.  Not bad, but nothing compelling about them either.  I do like how a monster/bum would alert the other ones- by banging the train tracks with a steel pipe and the sound would vibrate and extend throughout the subway.  Fairly original.

The segment with a guy lying on the subway tracks and getting attacked by vicious dogs (while the monsters stood around and watched) was total trash.  He was screaming at the top of his lungs at the drainage hole above, but the people would continue walking down the street completely unaware of his presence.  What makes this part so bad is how the music feels totally out of place, like this is the most tragic circumstance of all-time.  Yeah right!

I can't recommend Stag Night, even though the fighting scene at the end is pretty memorable.  It's just too bland with a few problems, so it misses the recommendation mark.",1326499200,,2694,4.6687898089171975

8425914,4,B004DTLKHG,"4 friends; Mike, Tony, Carl, and Joe are out for a night on the town in New York City, having a bachelor party for one of their friends. Unfortunately for these guys, trouble seems to follow them wherever they go. After getting kicked out of a strip club for being too rowdy, they decide to find another one across the city.
They decide to board a late night subway car as a quick way to get there. While on the train, they get into a bit of a scuffle with 2 hookers when one d-bag doesnt understand the meaning of no. The hooker retaliates using a bit too much pepper spray, causing all 6 of them to have to exit the train at the next stop.
They get off of at a closed station and find themselves trapped there when the train suddenly takes off and leaves them. They begin trudging through the dirty, cold rat-infested subway tunnels to try and find a way out, but suddenly and unwillingly become the targets of a clan of savage, bloodthirsty cannibals that lurk and inhabit the tunnels

Overall: What a movie! Stag Night doesnt even bother doing the usual character background or anything like that. The film opens with a bit of a prelude before jumping right in to the guys on the town. The action is under way within the first 20 minutes or so and its full force ride until the shocking ending. The plot is unique for the horror genre but the producer for the film got a little too gore happy for my liking. Theres buckets of red being spilled almost every 5-10 minutes, some of which in over the top ways. Aside from that, the pace of the story-telling was quick and anticipating; it kept you wondering what was going to happen next. Stag Night plays up on the real-life fear and atmosphere of taking subway trains. By day its a convenient method of transportation to get from place to place, but by night there are all sorts of creeps likely roaming the tunnels and stations. For the most part, Stag Night is an adequate film but just a bit too gory for most parts",1479168000,,1970,4.353260869565218
