895148,5,630450389X,"This movie is absolutely hillarious.  I'm not that fond of cats, in fact I don't like them that much, but this movie could make you laugh every second.  Some people feel like they want to laugh and this is the movie!",952387200,,216,4.2439024390243905
895149,3,630450389X,"Ricci [Christina]is the main highlight of this wierd but funny movie.
The story is about a teenage girl with a pet cat.
One night the cat brings home a message on a watch. The message looks like  ""hell"" but turns out to be ""help"". The message is from  a kidnpped servant of a rich lady.
I won't tell you the whole story but i  will say that it was pretty good. However, I think the age group it would  fit woul be about 5-11 years.",950486400,,431,4.035294117647059

895286,2,630450389X,"Unlike others, I was grateful the story line was different then the original, giving it a fresh modern spin, but the movie was really lame. I found the protagonist rude, annoying and arrogant, and the FBI agent was a little to silly for me. The best character in the movie though was Zeke. All the different story lines going on made the movie confusing and cluttered. Nice try, but blehhh. This movie apparently was aimed for a way younger audience then the original, It be ok for children. (Its clean, and filled with cheesy physical comedy) There was just to much cheesy slapstick and confusing subplots to be enjoying for me. I don't think I even cracked a smile during this entire movie, it is just that lame. THE ORIGINAL had a much more hilarious plot.",1481846400,,759,4.588235294117647

895358,2,630450389X,"I've seen the original ""That Darn Cat"" a few times, and it always makes me laugh.  I've never been a fan of remakes, but I do like Doug E. Doug, so I decided to give this one a try.  He did quite a creditable job as the bumbling FBI agent.  He didn't try to play the part the same way Dean Jones did, but brought his own unique talents to the role.  Alas, his performance was the only part of the movie that got any solid laughs out of me.  The cast was okay, but the overall movie was boring.  It lacks the fast-paced action, the slapstick, and the panache of the original.  I agree with those that say ""stick to the original"".  It's a much better movie.",1451779200,,655,4.0625

895360,3,630450389X,"This is a pale imitation of the original.  In the original you already know who the bad guys are, and the plot is much more about how the main characters get into trouble along the way, therefore creating comedy.  But this movie seems to be about a very simple mystery that is easily figured out from the first clue they give you.  The film makers then attempting to layer one third tops of details the first movie was abundant in.  I didn't find any parts of this movie to be very funny at all, except for the background characters, who seem to have all the fun without needing the main character to help.  I probably wouldn't watch this again, and am thankful I only rented it.

895446,3,630450389X,"It's a Disney movie aimed at kids, so they'll definetly enjoy it...I did when it first came out.  Now, I watch it just for the heck of it.  I still enjoy certain parts, most prominantly any scene with Doug E. Doug.  I still laugh at the antics and complete lack of intelligence or even common sense on the part of the two security guards (are they security guards or cops...the movie confuses me on this point as they seem to have an office while there is a police station with police officers and everything, but security guards don't patrol, do they?  My head hurts.)  And of course, Peter Boyle is always fun to watch.  Finally, the dog ""Smokey"" was also very entertaining, especially when he went after any intruders on his property.  Overall, this movie is good for a few laughs as an adult.  I'd reccomend it for your kids and for you only if you really feel like it.  Enjoy.",1391212800,,881,4.422360248447205

That Darn Cat is a lighthearted heart-warming movie that is good for the whole family. The main difference between this movie and the one from 1965 is that this movie is lighthearted fun and the older one is more serious and less comedic.",1357603200,,334,4.583333333333333
895484,2,630450389X,"I remember watching the original 1965 version of ""That Darn Cat,"" and I loved every minute of that film.  I also remember loving the original 1961 version of ""The Parent Trap.""  I had seen the remake of ""The Parent Trap"" and loved it, so I thought I'd give this remake a chance.  Bad move.

The remake is so far removed from the original I almost didn't believe it was the same story.  Too many little ""mini stories"" (for lack of a better word) distracted me from understanding the main plot.  The script is bad, the acting is mediocre at best, and the story line is confusing and overly complicated.

I would advise you not to see this poorly done remake.  Stick to the original.",1265155200,,680,4.42741935483871

I know there was an earlier version with Haley Miles but this is the best.",1201132800,,145,3.8
895487,3,630450389X,"""That Darn Cat"" was a comedy that came out in 1965.  So it needed to be remade 38 years later for a new audience, right?  Wrong.

Actually, is it really a remake?  It takes the basic theme of a woman held hostage putting a watch on a cat, and the cat's owner, with an FBI agent, solve the case.  They could have taken the remake route, or they could have made a completely original story.  The filmmakers took the second route, though there is enough of the original that it really didn't seem to know what it was doing.

If that's not bad enough, this movie has elements of other live Disney comedies.  There is the car chase of ""The Fifth Avenue Irregulars"", the surprise twist of ""Trenchcoat"", and the atmosphere of an Ernest movie.

Instead of a cute and likeable young adult (Haley Mills) and a frustrated but competent F.B.I. agent (Dean Jones), this one has an obnoxious and bored teenager (Christiana Ricci) and an inept agent (Doug E. Doug).  This movie does not have the realism or the suspense the original.  The original introduced the villains early on, while this one has more of a mystery . . . but if you read the credits, it is easy to figure out who one of the bad guys is.

Some of the elements of the original are here as well, though done better.  These include an F.B.I agent allergic to cats, one person looking at the watch on the cat, and making a comment about the time rather than ask why the cat is wearing a watch (both males), an encounter with a neighbor's dog in a fenced in yard, and agents trailing the cat that . . . I'll stop; this would spoil what should have been a surprise to some of you.  All of the above were done better the first time around.

There were some good things, though.  Several of my favorite actors/actresses ended up in this, such as Michael McKean (Lenny from ""Laverne And Shirley"", Bess Armstrong, Peter Boyle, and Megan Cavanagh.  In fact, Dean Jones, the original F.B.I agent shows up, as the broke-millionaire whose servant was kidnapped, though I think it would have been funnier having him as the F.B.I. chief.

This is a fun movie, but it does not live up to the original.",1166486400,,2138,4.410714285714286
895546,3,630450389X,"A cat (in the literal sense of the word) ""witnesses"" a kidnapping, and one of his owners' (Christina Ricci) heads to FBI HQ to file a report. Naturally,(at least behind her back) they laugh at her information, but soon appoint one of their own to head the investigation. Kitty had some clues on him (literally), and the team decides to tail him (pardon the pun), hoping he would lead them to where the clues came from, which proves easier said than done.  He ends up making the agents look like a bunch of bafoons. Will the agents catch the kidnappers? Will they even figure out there was a kidnapping? Will I ever get to arm wrestle Brooke Shields? To get the first two answered, you'll need to see the movie. The latter will depend on if her agent will let Brooke accept the challenge. If you want a movie the whole family can get a good laugh in, you will want to order this one. The film is a comedy and has good action with a brush of suspense. One of the cutest scenes is when the butcher and the security guard ""run across the field"" so to speak and kiss. If you're a Ricci fan, you'll see plenty of her charming self throughout the movie. Would make an ideal Birthday/Christmas gift for anyone especially  a Christina Ricci fan.",1108598400,,1236,4.393013100436681

The only thing it has in common with the original is that a cat came home wearing a wristwatch on his neck, everything else is a totally new story that doesn't make any sense.  It appears that the current producers disliked the original plot so they added a bunch of silly subplots just to fill space.  The lady butcher in love with a security guard leaving packages of meat on his doorstep, the ""bloody twig"" clue which turned out to be a maraschino cherry stem, the person who hasn't left their apartment for years, etc. were all distracting elements that nobody would have missed had they been left out.

What I have got was a production (1997) with shallow entertainment not even amusing or funny, created loveless.
 Although the original movie exists in a restored version I don't understand why it is not yet released on DVD in place of that nonsense of 1997. Therefore I share the same opinion with the reviewer who said: ""buy That Darn Cat (VHS) in place of That Darn Cat (DVD)""!",1044748800,16,645,4.375
