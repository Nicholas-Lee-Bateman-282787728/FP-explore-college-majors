8711544,5,B00VX21U0I,"This film is based on the life of its director, Abd al Malik, and veers through the harsh realities of his life as a teen growing up in Neuhof, France, that are the perfect contrast of street violence [what he wades through daily] to philosophy and literature [which prepare him, as one of his teacher's predicted, for his spiritual transformation after he sees a close friend killed]. The title, ""May Allah Bless France!"" becomes Abd's prayer for himself and those he shares his life with as you see the trajectory of this young man and his ultimate arrival at his decision to love life, love where he is, and embrace his gifts. Beautifully filmed in black and white--a few scenes are worthy of just pausing and looking at how they were set up and taking in the beauty that sometimes only black and white can reveal. The acting is excellent, and the writing is fresh and not overdone. The score is equal to the beauty and strength of this film, and both Abd and Wallen's [his real-life love ""Nawell"" who is also a character in the film] songs are feaured. Mabrook, Abd! Well done!",1439769600,5,1081,4.577319587628866
