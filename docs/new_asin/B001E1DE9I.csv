First, Stuart begins teaching the hows and whys of B.B.'s style. Then he demonstrates licks B.B. uses and ties it all together. All the important tools are present and accounted for including the ""B.B. Box, 1-finger bends, vibrato, altered chords"" ect.

Second, Stuart binds two practice tracks together so all the different licks and phrases can be practiced on one backing track. Awesome, you'll love this!!

Third, he takes us deep into previously uncharted territory exploring the way B.B. connects phrases together. This is a jaw dropper by itself. He even teaches how B.B. moves through scales!!

If your a blues musician, beginner, intermediate, or advanced by this now!! You won't be sorry!!",1295481600,2,900,5.02013422818792

The string bending and solo phrasing BB is famous for is all here and you will find that the lessons learned here will spill over into your everyday playing.
Stuart takes time to show you each lick and then the next set is shown and repeated great way to learn. The backing track provided is well recorded and can be played to over and over. One thing that you will find is that this dvd will help in your timming and phrasing as there is 2/4 swing type beat to his playing. This can be useful in rock soloing as well and can help shape different solo structures that will help make your own solos stand out.

very well done.",1230508800,4,836,4.225
