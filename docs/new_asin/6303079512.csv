7837915,2,6303079512,"This movie was certainly not worth spending the money on, it was very uninformative for the hunter with any knowledge of hunting. It really was not worth watching for a 30 minute film. I believe they could have done a much better job on this one. I bought it for my husband for christmas, but it wasn't worth it. The deer calling that they did have on this film was all common knowledge.",977961600,4,387,4.315068493150685
