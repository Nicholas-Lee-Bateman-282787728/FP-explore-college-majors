6519240,5,B00M0GM4V0,"Nine Things About the Movie ""Fury"" (USA, 2014)

1. One of the best movies of the year, this is a film that lives up to its name. It is a bitter, gorgeous, violent, post-patriotic, post-moral examination of war.

2. Set in Germany during the last month of WWII, its about a group of five men and their Sherman tank. A rookie typist is randomly selected to join the crew when one of the five is killed. He is a gentle and religious man, and the movie follows him as the war warps and destroys everything he has believed about the world and about himself.

3. Ive never seen a war movie focused on tank divisions before, so the battle scenes are not the typical run up the hill and shoot the bad guy scenarios we are used to. The fighting is chaotic, suspenseful, and yes, furious.

4. Between the war scenes are battles of a different sort, as each member of the crew tries to maintain their sanity, if not their humanity. They each have different defense mechanisms to deal with the horrors of what they experience. Shia LeBeouf is great as the religious one who tries to increase morale by convincing the crew that they are on Gods side.

5. Did I say this movie is violent? Well, its violent. Like, really violent. But its war, so its ok, right?

6. All five of the main actors totally inhabit their characters - there is not a weak performance anywhere. But Brad Pitt deserves to be nominated Best Actor of the Year for his role as leader of the group. He really straddles the line between hope and despair, and watches over his crew like a tired father who knows more than he can ever talk about.

7. The movie drives home the point that idealism is all well and good, but if those ideals are to be maintained, someone has to betray them. The movie deliberately moves past the discussion of good versus evil - such distinctions are for people sitting at home, safe. The soldiers are here simply to kill as many people as they can before they themselves are killed.

8. There is a smoldering, smoky rage that drifts through all the characters in the movie. Rage at the enemy, rage at the war, rage at the world and rage at themselves.

9. I don't think this is a movie for the patriotic Team America crowd. Its a beautiful, merciless, tour of duty that makes you wonder whether war destroys our humanity, or if war destroys our carefully constructed polite exterior and lets humanity express its natural brutality.",1413676800,735,2416,4.4603174603174605
6519241,2,B00M0GM4V0,"Terrific acting as Brad Pitt carries a movie that could have been good had the director found a military consultant familiar with actual warfare. In addition to ludicrous scenes of GIs walking straight up into German fire while shooting from the hip, one gets the notion the director never fired an actual weapon in his own life, as we are led to believe not only do the GIs walk into battle without a round being chambered, but the tank gun as well! Every director in Hlywood gets a charge out of the ""chambering"" of the round, and it belies any authenticity the scenes might carry. Add to that the inconsistency of the characters' relationships. The tank crew jumps with respect towards Pitt, their seargent, yet in the next scene barge in on him while he's with a woman as if they own him. They enter a town with multiple dwellings yet nobody goes door-to-door to see if there are enemy troops hiding. Some enemy troops surrender and the rest are grinning at murder while getting ready to rape. Stupidity meets psychotic sadism as the clueless director vents his own emotional problems towards all things military. All soldiers save one are mere rapists and murderers doncha-know? In reality, that tank crew would be between 18 and 21 years of age. Politically effeminate, anti-American and ignorant of WWII realities, the direction gets even worse in the the final battle, which any video-war-game player could have done better; as everyone knows the weapons of a tank are barely able to control the area in front, and have no ability to protect its rear, yet we are led to believe the enemy is simply going to stay in front of it. Does the word ""flanking"" mean anything to the film-makers? Positioning the tank in a narrow road surrounded by mountains would have leant a chimera of realism to what is in reality yet another ""director who knows war from living in Mommy's basement"" and ""I hate all people in the military"" Obamanation.",1413590400,24,1938,4.736686390532545

__________________________________________________

From the director who brought us Street Kings and End Of Watch comes David Ayers war drama as five brave men enter into German grounds while fighting to end the Nazi regime. When Don Wardaddy Collier is presented a new assistant driver, Norman, he prepares him for whats to come. Norman has no training in battle and doesnt understand the consequences of war physically and mentally. As Fury and their brigade push forward into the cities of Germany, Don promises to keep his men alive and vows to do so at any cost. With heart and intensity, Fury is a feature of brutality and bravery that David Ayer masterfully succeeds.

From the opening of the film we are immediately thrust into war as Don Collier (Brad Pitt) leads his men forward after an assault on their fellow comrades. It set the stage to how clever and death defying Brad Pitts character goes to stay alive. Pitt gives an amazing performance as never does he lack in character or has never given us all of his best. He was a leader of his men and showed emotion during a dark and dangerous time in history. His interactions with Logan Lermans character Norman were intense and at times warm. Pitt showed he can bring out the best in any actor regardless of age.

This brings me to Logan Lermans performance as we watch a young man who is only familiar with typing, ends up having to fight in war with Fury. He has such a difficult time coming to terms with the consequences of war and the thought of taking a life. You could connect with him at some level as many of the audiences watching could never imagine being in such circumstances. In one scene a Nazi soldier is captured and Don forces Norman to shoot him and realize who the real enemy is and that they don't deserve life. Within that scene emotions are flying and Lerman nailed that performance as you watch him struggle to keep his faith. Second behind Brad Pitts performance and as we see by the films end a change of roles when Lerman is discovered by a Nazi soldier.

As for the remaining cast we see Jon Bernthal, Michael Pea, and Shia LaBeouf connect so well together that they each brought something to the table. LeBeouf is under-rated for his career so far and showed a lot of energy in his role as Boyd. Peas character of Trini brought comedic relief during down times after forces take over German cities. He made many of the audience members laugh when he wore a top hat and acted out of character at times. Bernthals character of Grady was that of no mercy and even challenged Don when it came to authority and leadership. All the chemistries from these men created a well oiled machine that not only made it enjoyable to watch but you could feel for them and in hopes that they survive the war.

What helped make Fury intense and drama filled were the contributions of music composer Steven Price. So much dread is felt when Don leads his men through war time and tension was elevated by Prices composition. A high note took place during an airstrike by the Nazis that ends up devastating Norman as the background piano plays over the dramatic sequence of events. The score really helped the film build suspense and delivered with the action. Steven Price has also been credited for his work in Gravity as it also dealt with disaster.

As already seen in the trailer, an enemy brigade marches towards Fury with only five men to take on an entire fleet. The last 30 minutes of the movie is intense as it delivers the goods as to why Dons men are the best of the best. And Norman by then transforms himself into a auto-running machine who isn't afraid to take down the enemy. The final sequence encapsulates the heart and dedication the actors put forth; especially that of Brad Pitt and Logan Lerman.

Director David Ayer delivers an awesome experience who shows the ugly side of war with amazing writing and a talented cast. With the help of Steven Prices score that set the mood of the film it made the attack scenes that more powerful. We cared for Dons men as they fought solo against a brigade of 200 or so and showed how much damage five men can do with so little. Ayer has an amazing talent and may see his film get nominated for Best Picture when Oscar season roles around. Its too early to say but all around you have a powerful look at war and the cost that comes with it.",1413590400,10,4412,4.5075
6519244,3,B00M0GM4V0,"As the Second World War comes to a violent close, an exhausted and haunted U.S. Army sergeant (Brad Pitt) and the devout men under his command ride through Germany in their Sherman, the apt word ""fury"" painted on its barrel.  Into their closely guarded, combat-forged fold comes a fresh-faced typist (Logan Lerman) unprepared for the claustrophobic environment and uncomfortable around violence; his coming-of-age as a soldier is the heart of the film Fury, which largely consists of scenes of the men traveling, scenes of the men acting rowdy, and abrupt eruptions of carnage, fire, and return fire.  Where this picture excels is atmosphere and world building.  The despairing, filthy, unstable depiction of on-the-ground existence in 1945 Germany is vivid and hard to turn away from.  The performances are fine, too.  Pitt ultimately just puts forth a dialed-down version of what he did in Inglourious Basterds, yet is still engaging, and Lerman is fine as the almost angelic private who undergoes one trial by fire after another.  The character's arc is hardly revelatory, but he is not as bland as he sounds on paper.  As the other (rather thinly developed) members of the Fury crew, Michael Pea is charismatic and Shia LaBeouf quietly soulful.  Then there is Jon Bernthal, who is clearly doing a great deal of heavy lifting as an actor, awash as he is in macho Southern bluster and related tics, but the character is a hard-to-endure boor for whom I never felt any genuine sympathy.

Despite the top-notch quality of the production and the able cast, Fury falls short in certain respects.  A third-act confrontation between the five-man American crew and hundreds of Nazis, while a well-crafted set piece in and of itself, plays as far-fetched and overwrought.  It is as if the picture is compensating for its earlier embrace of an episodic structure and a more slowly burning type of unease.  Earlier, there is also an extremely uncomfortable sequence finding the Lerman and Pitt characters (and later their compatriots) invading the apartment of two German women, one a teenage girl.  Complicated questions of rape versus consensual sex during wartime (and the plight of women in general) are raised here as one of the soldiers ""sweetly"" beds a person he held at gunpoint a few minutes prior.  Such questions, however, are treated in a jocular and superficial fashion as they are swept under the rug, and the highly questionable behavior is clearly not intended to negatively redefine our perception of the men and their band-of-brothers camaraderie.",1413504000,8,2557,5.086124401913875
6519245,3,B00M0GM4V0,"The good: great performances, the building of tension in the first half of the movie, and the feeling of realism.

The not-so-good: the plot rolled along tough until the final battle, when it bogged down in the firefight and killing. It went from being a gritty movie about war, comradeship and survival to just an action film, and ended on a kind of flat note.",1413504000,4,361,4.553846153846154
6519246,4,B00M0GM4V0,"""Ideals are peaceful, history is violent"", says Brad Pitt's grizzled war hero Sgt. Wardaddy. Well, yeah, so are David Ayer movies. The writer/director had made his bones showing the machismo-laden camaraderie of the boys in blue, hitting a creative peak with last year's urban street drama, End of Watch. So it's not really much of a surprise to take the same formula and present it on a much larger canvas with Fury, an endlessly thrilling and jagged edged look at brothers-in-arms fighting the good fight in WWII. It's not the most thoughtful film examination of war we've ever seen, but Ayer sticks to his strengths and gives us one of the most entertaining war movies in recent years.

Those who jump on Pitt's performance as merely him taking another crack at Inglourious Basterds' Aldo Raine aren't paying enough attention. Wardaddy's battle-weary stare and adrenaline-fueled philosophy bares greater resemblance to his Achilles role in Troy. Fury, which is also the name of the Sherman tank that would become home to a five-man crew, begins in 1945 in the waning days of the war. But as Wardaddy says, plenty more people will have to die before it's truly over, and after losing one of his men in a recent battle (his face literally splattered on the tank floor) he's more wary than ever. So he's less than pleased when fresh-faced army clerk Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman) arrives as the new assistant tank driver. Norman knows nothing about war, he's been trained to type 60 wpm and little else, and fitting into such a tight-knit crew won't be easy. There's no reason for the other members of the team: gunner Boyd Swan (Shia LaBeouf), loader Grady Travis (Jon Bernthal), and driver Trini Garcia (Michael Pena), to put their lives in Norman's hands. One weak link can break the whole chain.

Ayer's script doesn't reveal much in the way of character details, allowing room for them to be defined by actions rather than words. Wardaddy is a tough man who understands the realities of war. It means killing, pure and simple, and he immediately puts Norman through a ""trial by fire"" forcing him to kill a German prisoner. The other guys only occasionally stray from familiar archetypes but Ayer colors them in with just enough bravado and vulnerability. Swan is the team's man of faith and Norman's reluctant confidante; Travis is a southern redneck and team troublemaker; Garcia is the alcoholic with an unpredictable mood. We see each of these combustible traits play out during an extended scene, basically an interlude from the grim violence, in which Wardaddy and Norman shack up with a couple of German women after occupying their town. Played almost like a horror, or like something Quentin Tarantino would have written, what begins to look like a tense hostage situation calms into a potential romance, only to have the rest of the tank crew arrive and stir the pot. The threat of sexual violence hangs in the air heavy as death; old tensions arise amongst the group, especially between Travis and Wardaddy. It's a great scene that feels like it came from a totally different film, but Ayer is using it to explore the pointlessness and inevitability of death during wartime, and the effect it has on more than just soldiers.

But a rumination like that is few and far between. Ayer puts the bulk of his attention on the action, the chaos of battle and the sheer power of these hulking weapons of destruction. He almost glorifies it in a way, bullets whizzing by like blaster fire from a Star Wars stormtrooper. It's a little weird at first and almost takes you out of the moment but it works, and Ayer isn't afraid to show the terrible impact these high-powered shells can do to a human body. This is what Ayer specializes in; rugged, brawny violence that is fascinating even at its most disturbing. Considering how authentic his police dramas tended to be it's no surprise Fury looks great, from the uniforms down to the rusty tank treads.

What Ayer doesn't do quite enough of is show the deteriorating effects of being stuck in such a claustrophobic weapon of death. We see glimmers of it in the aforementioned interlude but other than Pitt's Wardaddy the other characters are sketchily drawn. It's good to see LaBeouf, all mustachioed and worn, playing a tougher character than we're used to seeing. Bernthal and Pena are solid but underutilized, while Lerman really shines as the inexperienced soldier clearly out of his depth. He's not a wimp, which is how the character could have come off if played differently. Of course this is Pitt's movie, and while his Wardaddy uses an economy of words we understand who he is right away. The war has forged him into a harsher man, forcing him to do things he knows are necessary but wishes they weren't. In quiet moments we see glimpses of the man he could have been without the years of fighting. Pitt has played a lot of tough guys lately (don't forget his excellent performance in Killing Them Softly) and always brings a little something different each time.

Fury is a thrill ride first and foremost, ending with the kind of big Hollywood brouhaha with big guns, Nazis getting cut down, and grand gestures of American heroism. So yes, history is pretty violent, but also makes for one heck of a movie.",1413504000,3,5268,4.797356828193832
6519247,5,B00M0GM4V0,"After just seeing the film opening day in theaters I am already anxious to get the BluRay DVD.  The movie was gut wrenching and excellent.  After more than 50 years of being a WWII Historian with emphasis on Armor, someone has finally made ""The Tank Movie"" of all time.  Also, the film goes down in history for having the first REAL German Tiger 1 ever seen live in film history.  The Tiger 131 can be seen all over YouTube at the Bovington Tank Museums Tank Fest.  Movie theaters do play the sound painfully loud and that only made the experience more gut wrenching.  To have the new recliner seats in theaters today literally vibrating from the concussions certainly didn't help.  I think what makes it worse for an Armor buff and WWII enthusiast is knowing the details and weapons capabilities of that period.  Just hearing the word Panzerfaust makes one cringe.  They certainly portrayed the statistics right in needing 4 - 5 Shermans to overwhelm one Tiger.  I also have a new found respect for Shermans as I never thought they could endure so much.  This film has now surpassed Saving Pvt Ryan as the most fierce WWII film I have seen to date.  I've read that the film makers consulted with many British WWII Tankers while making this film.  I can see and appreciate the authenticity their life's memories have contributed to the details of the film.  I rarely go to the theaters ever anymore, but this film I knew I would have to see opening day!!",1413504000,567,1454,4.5852713178294575

6519351,2,B00M0GM4V0,"Totally overrated movie.  While the tank fight scenes were fantastic, I absolutely hated the characters.  Totally over the top and unrealistic.  Brad Pitt as a tank commander?  Uh, no.  I didn't buy it.  The other characters were just so unbelievable, that I could never really get into the movie. And, of course, they mysteriously mirror exaggerated versions of Saving Private Ryan characters. Coincidence?  Nope.  And the ending?  LOL.  What a joke.  It was ridiculous.  I was literally laughing at the movie at that point.  What a shame too, because there really are some terrific tank battles in this movie.

***  SPOILERs ***
So, the tank breaks down right in the open, with zero cover, and they gun down hundreds of German soldiers.  Holding off waves and waves of enemies who have no ability to fight a disabled tank.  Yeah, right.  Give me a freaking break.  Even green troops in the Hitler Youth units would have trashed that tank in minutes.  You would think the producers would at least have the tank break down in a defensible position to at maybe give the final battle a tiny bit of realism.  But, no, the movie has to go out over the top with Transformers level action.  Oh, and of course, each member of the tank crew dies one at a time so we can all see their slow poetic deaths.  Just silly.",1532649600,,1308,4.591304347826087

6519414,4,B00M0GM4V0,"Director David Ayer wrote and directed this intense war movie entirely centered in an American tank during World War II. The characters are surprisingly complex and develop as Fury reaches its brutal conclusion. The close up shots and wide shots are really beautifully framed.

I think Brad Pitt gives a highly respectable performance as the leader of this tank unit. Shia LaBeouf also gives his best acting yet in Fury. They impressed me the most in the cast. Jason Issacs has a nice cameo as an American commander as well. The rest of this ensemble plays their part, but are not as memorable.

The music swells in a terrifying whirl of sound as Fury's grim lighting illuminates the horrors of war. Fury is gritty and realistic as you follow along multiple tank encounters. You are shoved into the tank's cramped compartments and little spaces with these characters. The cinematography is jaw dropping throughout the battles but then steps back when they are out of combat zones. Fury contains some of the most realistic and detailed wartime set designs for the German landscape and town side. The costumes are period correct and finely tuned to make each character look unique.

I only wish Fury were a little shorter and less contrived during the German town segment wherein soldiers are sleeping with the local German girls. It's awkward and awful and ruins the tone of the movie as it slows down the narrative immediately. Without this entire sequence you'd lose major character development, but it does feel like it hurts Fury's moral statements. You do see American and German troops vilified and humanized alike.

In short, I think Ayer made his best film with Fury. War movie fans will be thrilled with Fury's suspenseful onslaught, while other audiences will be engaged by the great acting and compelling story. Fury is a great war film in its own right.",1530316800,,1864,4.889240506329114

While some people have said Fury is a knock-off of Saving Private Ryan, I disagree. They're very different movies and each tells a very poignant story.  I've never been a Brad Pitt fan, but my opinion of him as an actor changed dramatically after watching this movie.  He delivers a stellar performance.

6519540,2,B00M0GM4V0,"Many aspects of the movie were very good and the Tiger tank was magnificent.  It showed some unique aspects of armored (tank) warfare VERY well.  As a war veteran and son of a WWII infantry company veteran (A-1/255th Infantry) of the 63rd Infantry Division (7th US Army) in the European Theater of Operations (ETO) I found much of the movie rather ridiculous.  The tank commander (portrayed by Brad Pitt) was very well depicted in his hatred of the Nazis and some of his flaws were believable, but some was just over the top.  The ending was so ridiculous that I gave the DVD away.  If you are looking to be entertained this will entertain you.  If you are looking for a somewhat believable account of what it was like to be a tank crew person in WWII ETO is is rather well done.  If you are looking at conduct of warfare and the difficulty of entering the first battle it is somewhat well done.  I will leave out the ridiculous parts so as not to spoil the movie for other viewers.",1524268800,3,982,4.386740331491713

It is dark, gritty, and in your face with violence in the first 5 minutes and I had a hard time accepting that it was needed for the story.  Several show times on cable tv got me past the first 5 minutes and then I saw how hard the actors had worked to make this movie.  The dialogue is strong and Brad Pitt sums it up well with this line, ""You only understand two things.  The fist and the boot!"".

The story takes place at time when the main charatcers had already survived several years of war in the tank.  There is no glory, no ramoantic drama, just brutal reality that war is dangerous and the people who fought for Nazi Germany knew what they were doing when the joined the German Army.  The audience joins through the eyes and thrd person newbie, Norman, a young private who until he saw the tank had been a typist and clerk.

The tank battles are gripping, the actor's feeling about their tank and the war are believable and the photography and camera work keep your attention.  The music is strong, martial and even Gothic and it guides the audience from humanity to killing to machine.",1519948800,,1146,4.342723004694836

 Pure Hollywood garbage, don't waste your time or money. If you want a more accurate portrayal of the American soldier, I suggest going old school. Watch Sands of Iwo Jima with John Wayne.

6519729,1,B00M0GM4V0,"I did not like anything about this movie. Very unrealistic. In the beginning it shows a tank battlefield and apparently Brat's tank is the only one that survived. A German officer comes riding by on a white horse. Very unrealistic. Of course, Brat jumps him and kills him with a knife. Later on at a regrouping camp the one fatality on Brat's tank is removed from the tank and a new recruit shows up to take his place. He has been in the army for 8 weeks. In other words he has not been able to go through basic training since most of his time has been spend travelling from the US across the Atlantic ocean landing either in England or France. He has never seen the inside of a tank, he says, but is supposed to be the assistant driver. In other words he has never driven a tank. That makes a lot of sense. They are then a group of 4 tanks with Brat in command. He is only a sergeant. I doubt that. They get into several skirmishes and end up capturing an assigned small town where they get involved with some women, totally unrelated to their assignment. They are assigned another objective and get into a fight with one German Tiger Tank which destroys 3 of the Shermans, and again Brat's tank is the only survivor. He doesn't even stop to check on casualties. His radio is destroyed but he goes on unable to communicate with his superiors. He then drives on a lonely country road that obviously has been used by a lot of other traffic, but lo and behold there is a ""lonely"" mine in the road that disables his track. He sends out a lookout who comes running back and reports that several hundred Germans are coming this way. But Brat is going to fight it out. The Germans are shown to have at least a dozen Panzerfausts, which are very effective against American tanks. With one 30 caliber machine gun able to operated from inside the tank plus his main armament of 75 mm gun, he is now able to kill most of the German force without his tank being destroyed. Totally unrealistic. Only the young recruit, untried in tank warfare, survives after the Germans decides that everyone is dead.

Colors and details are sharp and bright, and the dolby sound is theater like.  I've seen Fury on cable, NetFlix and the bluray is clearly superior.  There are enough extras in the disk for another 2 hours of video, so the disk gives 4 hours of viewing.

The cinematography of a live M4A1E8 Sherman and the Tiger 1 are among better action sequences filmed for tanks, even for a movie, so if you like this sort of thing, Fury can't be beat.  Too much CGI is used on other movies and very unrealistic if you've even seen such tanks move in life; Popular tanks movies like Battle of the Bulge and Patton do not use authentic period tanks.

Fury has pros and cons, but most viewers agree the equipment used were fairly accurate to WWII of 1945 vintage.",1512000000,4,904,4.345238095238095

In this movie, we are treated to watching a US officer force a soldier who's barely out of high school to murder an unarmed surrendering German. Later, we see the same troop of 'heroes' threaten to rape a civilian girl. My grandfathers fought in WW2 and I later came to be friends with several Germans who were children and teens when Americans marched through their country. US soldiers did not behave that way. It's easy to open a history book or read accounts of German survivors who fled west with the hopes that they would be captured by Americans rather than the advancing Russian army. Our sacrifices in WW2 made it one of the finest moments in our history. It's disappointing that Hollywood feels the need to trash even our 'greatest generation'. To top it off, the final battle had all of the realism of a video game. Hollywood needs to stick to it's comfort zone: movies about drug addicted teenagers exploring their sexuality while on multi-state killing sprees.

6519895,2,B00M0GM4V0,"Fury is being touted as a great war film and I cannot understand why - I can only think of a few redeeming qualities.  The movie follows a battle hardened tank crew with ""Wardaddy"" Collier (Brad Pitt) as the commander; after losing a gunner in their last encounter, they are assigned a virtually untrained kid, Norman, to take the former gunner's place.  With the final push into German territory, it's clear the war will end soon; however, Norman is recognized immediately from the start as a threat to Collier's promise to his crew to get them through the war alive.  So this becomes, arguably, the focus and drive of the film - Collier must turn Norman into a Nazi killer and Norman must realize the unfortunate realities of war and perform his duty, a necessary evil for the greater good.

**Potential Spoilers to Follow**

It is a given that the two characters are both characters we should become emotionally vested through storytelling; however, how this is executed makes the film awkward and winds up unwittingly villainizing even Norman who is a kid, pulled to the front via reassignment.  There is the cliche gore of war that Norman is forcefully exposed to initially, but eventually there is a point where Collier and Norman collide.  The crew pulls alongside a regiment that has a captured Nazi, begging for his life, showing pictures of his family...unarmed - essentially a prisoner of war.  Collier jumps out of the tank, brings Norman with him and orders him to perform what amounts to a war crime.  Norman refuses to the point where he tells Collier to kill him instead; but Collier does not - rather, he grabs him into a choke, forces the gun into his hand, and pulls the trigger on top of Norman's finger, killing the Nazi.

This makes me feel for Norman; he is morally righteous and victimized in the most heinous manner possible given the circumstance.  Yet, instead of building off of this, Norman is changed to the point where, after encountering another group of Nazis, with little hesitation, rips right through them.  Except this is not regarded as a job well done - the soldiers were on fire burning to death and Norman should have let them burn.  Asked how it felt killing Nazis, Norman now replies ""I kind of liked it.""

The final misguided attempt to instill in the audience an understanding of Norman's transformation is after they help capture a German town defended by Nazis.  Again, surrendering, Collier pulls the sole SS soldier out of the line and guns him down in front of everyone - okay, whatever.  Now that the resistance is gone, every woman in the town now ""wants"" sexual gratification from a foreign soldiers.  Even when two women are hiding in an apartment, Collier grabs Norman and they walk up to the apartment, forcing themselves in.  One is rather young, sobbing; Collier tells Norman if he doesn't take her into the bedroom, he would.  So to his feet, Norman grabs her hand and takes her into the bedroom - as the other woman tries to stop them, Collier explains ""they are young and alive; let them live.""  We are presented with an awkward interaction between Norman and the young girl and after some time they exit the room smiling; Norman has found his true love.

Unfortunately, once the crew has returned to their parked tank, a very random and brief artillery barrage nails the apartment with the girl in it - this utter contrivance kills Norman's love and he is finally transformed into a full-on Nazi killing machine.  The film moves on from here into a ridiculous sequence of ""tank warfare"", then into an even more ridiculous battle.  The final sequence involving Norman and a Nazi soldier left me speechless at its nonsense.

I really do not understand what I am supposed to take away from this film - war is hell perhaps..(?)  Well that's generally regarded as true and is well known; however, Fury tries to convince us of this already done theme with the logic of a sociopath and historical inaccuracies.  Of course bad things happened during World War II, but are we at the point where the German's can now be demonized to the point where we embody by force the worst type of mindset normally associated with the Nazis and apply it accordingly, yet remain ignorant of this misapplied mindset and even champion it?  I think not.  Fury is truly a terrible movie.

A side note, instead of one star, I went with two due to the amazing performance by Shia LaBeouf - an actor I've regarded in the past as without talent; however, he really did show skill in this film.",1508025600,,4524,4.691139240506329

The movie starts out where the crew is one man short because the gunner they had got obliterated in a scrabble that occurred before the film started. The movie start where the new guy joins them but he isn't game to shoot anyone. In fact, he'd never been in a tank before. And the crew seems to have lost their mojo, and the new guy is little help. He is clearly not the badass they hoped he would be. So they go on a mission, and the new guy warms to killing a few Nazis after some prodding by his tank mates. Then they're relaxing in this French town they spy a French girl in a window of a building in the town square. Next comes 30 minutes of Brad Pitt and the new guy upstairs with two French women that don't speak English, and they're all just trying to be decent folks, with the understanding that war is hell but look how much etiquette niceness we can still squeeze out of it.  The rest of the tank crew, including Tom Hardy and Shia Labeuff (whatever) finds out about this dinner with the two French women and crashes the party. Here comes the conflict because these dirty rats ain't gonna play nice if they can help it. Brad Pitt plays the big dog here and keeps the women from being raped, apparently. I turned this movie off at this point because the plot is stupid and all these actors should be ashamed. Maybe this movie gets better after the lame dinner scene but I'll never know.

6519925,1,B00M0GM4V0,"The Smithsonian Channel did a very good feature on the production of this film, which features perhaps the last living Tiger tank. The Smithsonian piece emphasized the exhaustive attention to historical detail in terms of uniforms and equipment.

Unfortunately, the plot is very sick. The hero is a red hot American armored sergeant. He carries a single action Colt Revolver like big boss, George Patton. His victim is a timid conscript forced into the hero's tank crew by the exigencies war. The hero bullies the victim relentlessly, eventually forcing his timid victim to shoot a timid, young German conscript, (not SS) with the ceremonial single action revolver, as the German boy begs for his life.

This is what real war hero's do in the Donald Trump era.

My father served in the Combat Engineers, 29th Infantry, during the invasion of Europe.  My uncle served as a Lieutenant in a rifle company on Pelilleu. Do you know where that is and what happened there? I grew up around combat veterans of WWII who returned to lives as farmers, tradesmen, and businessmen. They were not bullies or sadists. They fought bravely and skillfully, suffered unimaginably, and were killed or maimed
for life by the tens of thousands.

If you are a big fan of Donald Trump, if you fondle your AR while fantasizing about shooting large numbers of unarmed, inferior people, this movie is for you. The movie does a terrible disservice to the Greatest Generation of Americans, who were critical in winning the most destructive war ever fought on the earth. They fought for democracy, decency, and justice.

Don't even get me started on the battle scenes, I don't want to spoil this for anyone who actually wants to watch this mess so just believes me when I tell you this was the most horribly written war movie I have ever seen. It absolutely does not portray the actual way the U.S. Military operates, and I am surprised that Brad Pitt would agree to be in this movie. Do not waste your time. I would have given 0 stars if it was possible.",1505088000,4,721,4.194244604316546

6519943,5,B00M0GM4V0,"Surfing channel's I found this war movie on a movie channel, this was over a year ago. I watched it for maybe an half hour impressed with persona of the Tank Commander. I did not realize for a half hour that it was Brad Pitt. Someone else wrote not anywhere do we see this kind look at a tank crew. We get a lot of Rommel and Patton, but  this was more the story about the men who followed the orders the General's gave. The interaction between the crew members is unique, and has moments like when the Sgt. starts quoting the Bible, to the guy who is always quoting the Bible.. This was toward the end of the movie when Pitt's character could step out of his role as Commander, and afford to show who he was. I have known a lot of people who served in WW ii, including Army and Marine Sargent's and Navy Chiefs even a man who made many trips to Europe as Chief on a Merchant Marine ship.
Nothing brought the European part of the War home  to me like in the 1960's, while in London seeing just how much devastation existed walking down the streets. But the thing that got the sacrifice of these men and women in order to stop the Nazi German's. Was a trip to Normandy, over the course of many day's I visited all the beach landing sites. Starting with where the Canadians landed, the British landing sites to the beach's where the US landed. By this point I realized I was changed forever. The trip to the American Cemetery, in a beautiful setting walking passed and checking the names and rank and from which state they came from. Two thing's that I realized, one that even a little more than a decade ago, you saw Vet's and there families in many cases. The other thing was how many French families where there with the kids, teaching them about the war and the hero's that saved France. I went over the anniversary of D-Day and the entire area of Normandy has many events for the allies, while I am not really a WWII buff that trip to Normandy should be something on your bucket list.",1504224000,,1987,4.281914893617022

6519983,4,B00M0GM4V0,"Fury is a movie worthy of its name, but a film nearly ruined by an unrealistic, overly dramatic ending. Still, it's worth watching if only to be reminded that Brad Pitt and Shia Labeouf are more than just celebrities, they are actually fine actors.... I must say, though, that there is a scene in the movie that has stayed with me, and I've been clueless as to why until considering the scene more closely. In it, Brad Pitt as Sergeant Collier and Logan Lerman as Private Ellison commandeer the apartment of two attractive German women. The moment takes place in 1945, nearing the end of World War II. The sergeant is a hardened man driven to the cusp of madness by the horrors of war, some of which he has both witnessed and created; he is a man held together only by his sense of honor and duty to the Army and to his men. In contrast, Private Ellison is a boy recently plucked from the comfort of civilian life and, due to necessity, is tossed into the meat grinder with Collier and three other soldiers, all of whom are as hardened and as ruined by war as their sergeant. The two take over this apartment, and have the women cook breakfast after Ellison has had sex with the younger female and after Collier has washed his filthy, scarred body and shaves his filthy, scarred face. Eventually all four are seated at the dining room table prepared to eat when suddenly the soldiers' three other brothers-in-arms enter the home, surprised to discover they are in fact uninvited guests. After an uncomfortable few minutesboth for the characters and for the audienceone of the men reveals through a grotesque story about slaughtering horses why the moment is so intolerable to him and the two other men with whom he had entered the apartment: All three with Sergeant Collier had killed the horses as they'd been ordered to do; all three had endured the images of noble beasts bathed in blood they themselves had put there; and all three were stuck with the images and the sounds of that day, images and sounds that would perhaps never leave them as long as they continued to take air into their lungs. THEY had earned a seat at that table, in that apartment, NOT Private Ellison who had only recently joined them in hell. The scene immediately made me think about the fury caused by gentrification: It is not simply that people are enraged by affluent outsiders entering their neighborhoods, increasing rents so that those currently living in a community for as long as they can remember are forced outthat's part of it, surely. But another part of their rage comes from having endured a neighborhood, having collectively suffered there, succumbed and survived there, just to have what came from their determination enjoyed by people who were never there to suffer with them.",1500076800,,2774,4.686475409836065

I wish they could have cut about half an hour and tightened it a little.  War is hell and this movie makes you feel that.  Warning, some of it is gory.  This movie also featured talk of religion now and again.  Whether you believe in a religion or don't, you can probably find what you're looking for in this movie to back you up.  I don't believe in any religion (and don't believe in a creator god) and this movie shows the hypocrisy of such beliefs in the death and destruction of war.  What kind of a God creates people and allegedly looks after them/loves them just to have them machine-gunned to death?  It's senseless.  As for the specific supernatural beliefs of the Abrahamic-religions, these are just crazy and I don't understand how anyone can believe in them.  Conditioning, environment, and a predisposition I guess.  But believers will see it differently.",1499126400,,1040,4.473404255319149

6520027,2,B00M0GM4V0,"im a big fan of military movies and documentaries and I have to say I was extremely dissapointed in this movie. I have tried to watch it twice and can not finish it. I thought they did a great job with the backgrounds and all the equipment and tanks looked really good and the cast was decent but what ruined it for me is the special affects, I mean for a movie that was filmed around 2014 you would think they could easily pull this off but the actual combat scenes were so rediculously bad it was almost embarrassing to watch. I mean they used green and red lasers to replicate the affects of the ammunition leaving the weapons and the explosions were so terrible I couldn't stand it. The CGI affects they use now days are ruining movies in my opinion they make everything looks so over digitilized and fake. This movie had so much potential, honestly if they could go back and use Real prop explosions and get rid of the stupid lasers it would be a really good movie.

( I am aware that tracer rounds did exist during ww2 but were primarily used by aircraft and naval forces and were rarely used by ground forces. Also I truly don't believe the movie intended to portray the lasers as tracer rounds as this is so far from realistic during that time.)",1497830400,,1253,4.354700854700854

I could have figured that out and I am not a military officer nor have I ever been. I like that it focused on a tank crew, that is pretty much all I liked about it. Quite frankly, it was hot garbage. I can't even imagine how it is ranked so well by so many and even IMDB gave it a 7.6. this movie was awful. Pitt gave a standard Pitt performance, not bad but not spectacular.

It is stark and intense.  At times I wanted to know who the ""good guys"" were.  Just when I started to really get disgusted with some of the individuals, one of them would do something to restore my faith in them.  Such is life I suppose.

There were parts of the movie that did not seem realistic, especially the climatic battle scene.  For me that was the weakest part of the movie.

Blades provide leverage to loosen the nut on the pulleys. Then I pulled the blades followed by removing the spindles. My mower has just over 500 hrs on it so the factory spindles were trashed. I put the new spindles in my vise using nylon jaw inserts and pumped grease in them until it started oozing out around the shaft.

Tanks with range advantage will not come closer to you on purpose. SS Troops with just MP40's would not keep running around on foot in front of a tank that is unable to move, they would flank it. If 2 grenades go off right beside you, especially in a confined space, the next morning when someone found you it would not look like you were just taking a nap. I could go on but you get the point.

The acting was great, the look and feel was great. It felt like to me it really was that time period instead of just being on some Hollywood set. It was showing war is hell and not some video game. I just wish how the fight scenes happened hadn't been ""Hollywood"" and the director/producer hired some military people to advise them on what they were doing.
Shai at times was overacting/trying too hard, but the rest of cast did a great job.

6520169,5,B00M0GM4V0,"After I read about this movie in several german newspapers I didn't want to watch or even like it. As all the german papers and all the reviews on the german Amazon site stated, this movie depicted german soldiers as mindless meat that run into open mg fire without second thoughts. So the majority of german reviewers decided to hate this movie, and it got quiete bad comments ever here.
Well, I decided to watch it anyway, and I didn't regret it. While this movie is one of the most violent war pics I have ever seen, it offers a lot to think and discuss about after the feature has ended. Neither german nor US soldiers are depicted as saints, which is a big improvement compared to some war movies from the 70ies or so. And the crimes committed by the SS against their own countrymen are shocking even after so many years, for all of this really happened. In one scene you can see a hanged woman with a sign around her head. The text on this sign is translated all wrong in the movie. It reads 'I was hanged because I did not let my children join the war'. Took me some time to chew on that.
I have to admit, that the final scene seems rather unrealistic in part. No soldier would march into mg fire like that. On the other hand, it would not have been interesting to watch 300 men crouching through the mud and being shot at. The general setting is realistic though. It is definitely possible to defend a position like that against so many infantery soldier, there are many reports about this from WW2, especially from D-day.
So all in all, this is a really good movie. Don't expect to come out of it cheering, but it definitely leaves a lasting impression.",1491609600,,1662,4.364516129032258

There really were men (and women) like this during WWII who gave everything, and, in fact, they saved the world - for you and for me - for us all.

It's clear Brad Pitt's character has been so warped by the war that he's become what he hates, and at certain points you get the impression he knows what he is and tries to redeem himself. Unfortunately he, Pitt's character, works to mold the new guy in his own image. It's like they all lost their humanity, and they know this, so they all work together to make the new guy loose his as well, so they're all the same.",1490313600,2,768,4.446808510638298

6520215,5,B00M0GM4V0,"A glimpse of the armored warfare in Germany as WW2 was coming to its conclusion. It depicted the angst that US armored soldiers had when going up against the superior armor and main guns of the German tanks, and how insufficient their M-4 Sherman tanks were to deal with those enemy advantages. A young clerk-typist is thrown into the fray, and learns the brutality of war from one crew that has so far survived. It also shows that it was just as brutal for their enemy, and how quickly life could end for the soldiers of both sides. It also shows what my Dad had been trying to tell me; as it neared conclusion, the war was so frustrating for all soldiers on both sides who had their buddies killed with only days left in the conflict.",1490140800,,736,4.37956204379562

6520282,1,B00M0GM4V0,"If you're looking for a realistic depiction of WW2 combat, move on because this isn't it. I had high hopes when this movie was made, but what a letdown when I finally saw it. The movie is closer to being a carachiature of WW2, very comic bookesque with most major characters bearing scars, battles with all the tactics of an 8 year old playing with Army Men, and military discipline ala the Vietnam War. Yes, the story is fiction, but so was Saving Private Ryan, which was masterfully done. But not everything was bad.
The Good: Great attention to detail in using correct equipment. They even went the extra mile by getting use of the only fully functional Tiger tank in the world (Bovington, UK) for major scenes. The scenes showing the teamwork necessary inside a Sherman tank are spellbinding. Brad Pitt is very solid as the lead.
The Bad: The acting, outside of Pitt, is mediocre at best. The battle scenes are amateurish. The story is weak, from the reason a ""last stand"" is necessary to the wives tale that only a shot in the rear would kill a Tiger.
If you love seeing WW2 equipment or just any movie with things that go boom, this movie might be worth a look. Otherwise, watch Band of Brothers again.",1487894400,,1208,4.52054794520548

The soldiers in this movie are a bunch of uncontrolled, undisciplined, murderers, thieves, and rapists; completely insubordinate. Regarding the military operations represented, the plot is completely inaccurate. Tanks do not operate without infantry. Tanks are not weapons by themselves. The movie is okay as an action piece.

6520340,4,B00M0GM4V0,"It's not heavy on plot and it seems short on character development, but makes the 2 hours fly by. The movie does a good job of connecting you to the characters, you may not love them or understand why they are like they are but you still feel that connection, like you are one of the people riding in the tank. The action is wonderful and really gives you an idea of how awesome the power of these weapons were. Often I think how old these weapons were and how outdated they are to modern weaponry, but watching one tank unload suppressing fire you begin to understand just how scary being in the middle of this action is. You get to see just how outclassed the American tanks were compared to the German Tigers and feel a sense of relief when the action is over and you are still breathing. I wouldn't say this is a drama, it's pretty heavily invested into the action, and it does that action well. It doesn't overshoot and try to explain all the history and background of World War 2, it focuses on one tank over the course of a few days, and by doing so gives a very fleshed out movie experience.

Suddenly Brad Pitt jumps out of a tank and graphically stabs the rider in the EYE with a dagger).  Didn't get through it, why would one? Not one appealing character.

No one wants to sugar coat war, but why as a society are we now prone to wallowing in the depths of crassness and meanness that humans are capable of? Is this what we want to teach our kids, and export to the rest of the world?  Shame on Hollywood!",1484006400,,666,4.554621848739496

Man at his worst and best.  Excellent character development in this story about a couple days in the life of a US Sherman tank crew post D-Day, this is a completely believable band of brothers made of polar opposites (angels and devils).  Brad Pitt plays the archetypal American hero NCO, giving his all to the mission and protecting his crusty and vulgar, war weary crew.  This movie will cause your adrenal glands to squeeze, I found myself unconsciously tense, bracing for action, many times.  My wife, who usually hates war movies, hung in there for this well told story and liked it, even with such graphic violence.  I think such realistic depictions of combat are valuable POV for the 99% of us Americans who never experience way and is not in the least, bit gratuitous.

6520682,5,B00M0GM4V0,"I would say it's probably 4.5 stars for me but I leaned towards 5 for the review. I'm a fan of WW II movies and had never seen one focused on a tank commander and crew. I'm sure they're out there, but I can't recall one. I think they did a great job of what life was like having to drive in an armored shell that protected you from some things but made you vulnerable to others. The claustrophobia for me would have been awful in one of those things.

This is a smaller movie in that there aren't really any huge/major battles (a la Private Ryan) that this tank is a part of, but the final battle is pretty intense and unexpected. It's brutal and very graphic in terms of war movies so keep that in mind with your audience. There is a little bit of an interlude with some character development in the middle of the movie, but for the most part, the movie focuses on a ""day in the life"" of a tank patrol, the toll it takes on a human being, and the camaraderie it builds among the crew.",1483401600,,985,4.103626943005182

None of the characters had any redeeming qualities.  I loved Band of Brothers, Pacific and Saving Private Ryan.  I even liked Full Metal Jacket.  But that is because the characters had some humorous or real emotional moments.  None of these characters gave a s*** about each other.

The Wardaddy character is complex, especially late in the film when he reveals how familiar he is with Scripture.  That leaves the question unanswered : what in his background accounts for that and how did it shape his actions.  His command of German is also unexplained and, consequently, adds to the fascination.  I compared the mystery about Wardaddy to that of Tom Hanks' character in ""Saving Private Ryan "".

6520991,3,B00M0GM4V0,"I was hesitant to watch this movie, having been disgusted by the total fiction of Inglorious Bastards. Though still a very comic bookish, this movie was watchable. Considering how many dramatic and heroic true stories there are to be told about the people who fought in WW2, it's always sad that producers feel the need to create fictitious story lines.
 Other reviewers have mentioned the callous behavior of the characters in this movie. Whilst many minor atrocities were committed on the Allied side, there was on the whole, an adherence to standards of decency. Movies like this tend to dishonor the memory of Allied service men and women who fought that war, and also to the many of the German Military who did follow the military code.",1481414400,,741,4.834645669291339

(although his tank was a gasser- mine was a diesel beast) Put in fatigue, galling, debilitating fatigue, exposure, an unreasonable mission, little to no hope of survival, hunger, fear, emotional numbness and some cosmic drive to survive. Map reading, vehicle maintenance, dirt, always dirt, blast and smoke, main gun recoil, watching tracers, reacting to an ambush, and the endless turn-over of crews and people- they captured that in this film piece. Pretty realistic, get really, really tired, get exhausted and really hungry, get really cold and bone scared....and you're with those guys. Be advised; it's a morality play.

6521105,5,B00M0GM4V0,"'Fury' is a work of art, shocking in its unromantic directness.  Its a uniquely intimate WWII drama and a dark, stone cold masterpiece.  Early on, the wonderfully complicated tank commander Donny (aka Wardaddy), played brilliantly by Brad Pitt, casually murders a German soldier found by the side of the road as a way of teaching his newly recruited navigator, Machine(Logan Lerman), the harsh realities of the war they're in.  Ayers balances the gruesome tasks Wardaddy/Pitt must continually perform with the gruesome disfigurement such violence causes to the human spirit.  It's a simple given:  in life-or-death surroundings, everything else is lost but the will or instinct to survive, including empathy, decency, gentleness, art, and culture.  The tank crew is expertly drawn, the decisions they make are excruciating and believable, the story is riveting.  Theres a harrowing tank v tank battle scene thats so beautifully directed its actually comical.  A heartbreaking work of staggering genius, as they say.",1480550400,2,1015,5.461538461538462

6521107,5,B00M0GM4V0,"This isn't the best WWII movie by a long shot, but there's something about it that keeps me watching it over and over.

The most striking of all aspects in this movie is the cinema photography, that, in my opinion, excels in depicting the real world of war and all its inherent brutality, and the personal conflicts of the combatants. The contact scenes between opposing forces is well done and realistic, and the brief glimpses, we get, of human destruction are horrifying.

6521409,3,B00M0GM4V0,"This movie tries very hard to be gritty, gory, and realistic, letting us know war is never glorious. It succeeds, to a point. The tanks are authentic and the battle scenes are extremely well done.  The problem is the characters. Pitt and his tank crew are supposed to be cynical, case hardened, and war weary veterans but the movie tries a little too hard. Rather than eliciting our sympathy and causing us to root for them, Pitt and company come off as extremely disagreeable people whom we would rather not know and certainly will not cheer for. In Saving Private Ryan, we cared for Tom Hanks and his  band of rangers; we don't care for Pitt or his people. Pitt comes off an angry burnout barely clinging to sanity instead of a level headed, seasoned veteran. In one scene, he forces a terrified rookie to shoot a German prisoner in order to teach him what he is fighting.  He humiliates the man in front of other soldiers. I found that extremely unrealistic. That kind of humiliation would not toughen a rookie but would likely destroy any possibility of him ever becoming a fighting man.  In real life, that man would probably desert at the first opportunity. The most unrealistic thing about a movie that is trying to sell us on its realism, is the age of the actors. WW2, like all wars, was a young man's game. The average age was 23.  Brad Pitt is over fifty and all of his crew, with the exception of the scared rookie, looked to be at least in their mid thirties. This is a movie that is much less realistic than it first appears.",1477785600,,1539,4.462633451957295
6521410,4,B00M0GM4V0,"Great war flick. I thought the acting was good, the cinematography and effects were top-notch, and the story kept me interested. I think the best part was actually getting a feel of what the tank crews went through in battle - terrifying. The demeanor of the characters seemed to fit a bit more into our contemporary times, but I guess that's to be expected. All in all, worth watching.",1477785600,,386,4.608695652173913

These films take hundreds of artists and millions of dollars to carefully craft images using every part of the available frame, shooting in 2.35:1 is an important decision.

6521907,5,B00M0GM4V0,"I'm thinking that this was some fine acting by the whole cast. By that stage of the war only the fanatics were left. I used to work with some old men who fought in that. They didn't mess with prisoners. Just the way it was. This movie stresses that killing is the only way to stop what was going on. Morality took a hike for safer country, because moral folks got killed by the young German boys. I was told that often they were hopped up on amphetamines,  schnapps,  and ether. That they had to be shot in the head to stop them. This movie didn't go into that. It did show the real hatred for the SS troops. Factually history shows that a lot of them were summarily shot when captured. Most people don't realize that there was a running fight with holdouts for a couple of years after the war.

Fighting that Tiger tank showed what normally happened. American tanks were truly mismatched, and the General Staff knew it. Essentially, they threw tank crews at the Germans and they were slaughtered. American close air support and tank destroyers made the difference.  The Sherman tank was a real disaster when facing German high velocity tank Cannon. They used gasoline instead of diesel. Fury shows what happened.

I'm an armchair historian. I appreciate the accuracy of this movie. There weren't any heroes. That type of person was killed earlier in the war. Like War Daddy said.....This thing will be over when we get thru killing them.

Having said all of that, in real life Norm would have been shot. Those combat vets were extremely brutal. That's the only reason why they were still alive. That's what a real vet won't tell you. If a man can't hold up his end, he is a weak link that gets cut. Like I was told, soldiers were told they had to feed their prisoners from their own rations. So, really, the best a German soldier could hope for was that officers saw the surrender. Otherwise,  what happened to that German soldier wasn't rare at all.

All things considered, IMO, Fury is too weighed down by modern day political correctness. US troops were made out to be a bunch of classless thugs, and the technical accuracy is questionable. The movie just felt very anti-American (which, unfortunately, is par for the course in modern day Hollywood).

6522045,5,B00M0GM4V0,"Fury is a Brad Pitt movie I can sink my teeth into.  He doesn't play the pretty boy, in fact, if anything, he's anything BUT a pretty boy.  He's a survivor.  Fury is the name of a tank.  Mind you, these little WWII tanks had one thing going for 'em speed.  They were NOT exceptionally well armored.  A typical tank crew didn't have much of a life much less much of a lifespan.

I am happy to say this film shows that, warts and all.  It shows the ugliness and the kindness found in camaraderie.  Not only that, but it does it quite well.  Fury is a great story.  Of note, Michael Pea (The Shield) shows a great deal of maturity in his role.  I've always enjoyed him as an actor but this is great work.  Also, Jon Bernthal (Walking Dead) plays a man you might have a hard time coming to grips with.  But war does that to people.  Fury is a great movie and one I have watched several times and will watch several times more.  This is good stuff.",1471910400,3,943,4.0989010989010985

Supporting actors were decent. There were some awkward and seemingly contrived parts of the movie. A lot of fighting (which, yes, I expect with a WWII movie, but I just want the gunfire to be balanced with the relationship and emotion). Again, just a little lacking for me. If you are looking for good battle scenes but mediocre substance elsewhere, then this is a great movie for you. If you are looking for a buddy bonding movie, or something going deeper into the complexities of war as relates to the human experience...this may be a little ho-hum.",1471824000,2,711,4.5625

The production presented a realistic portrayal of the exhausted, filthy, half-starved, worn-out, and out times depraved members of both militaries, American and German.  Reviewers expecting character development through sentimental musings of the crew during the time of this portrayal know nothing of what the rapport would be amongst men of similar experience during the period of this depiction, weeks away from the end of the war in Europe, yet enduring the most fierce and vicious resistance of the campaign.

6522259,2,B00M0GM4V0,"Follows the standard Hollywood theme left wing filmmakers have employed since the 1960's - skeptical, steely-eyed, born-leader, hero leads lesser mortals, especially weak religious types, through the maelstrom of reality.

While I never served in combat I've read many authoritative books about it, and the relationships depicted among the men in this film is a far cry from reality. I also find it noteworthy that even with this modern-day film, and starring millennial generation types like Brad Pitt as protagonist, the enemy is the Nazis in WWII. Left wing filmmakers never like to cast their heroes in the mold of combating communists, say in Nicaragua, or North Korea or Vietnam. No the enemy has to be Nazis, who lefties like to think are right wing. Never mind that the term Nazi stood for National Socialists, precisely what defunct presidential left wing candidate and superstar Bernie Sanders advocates.

Also worth bearing in mind is that central to the plot of this film is that the Nazis had superior tank weaponry to ours. Filmmaker neglects to explain why that was. Well the reason was, of course, that developing first class tanks was not a priority for left wing icon Franklin Delano Roosevelt. While Hitler was developing powerful tanks during the 1930's, Roosevelt was developing building his welfare state called the New Deal. Not a new deal for the military, no, a new deal in government hand-outs. In the 1980's the president left wingers hate most, Ronald Reagan, authorized the development of the M-1 Abrams Tank which is now the worlds most dominant tank, and was decisive in pulverizing the Soviet-supplied tanks in Saddam Hussein's sizable arsenal.

 (The Abrams Tank was named after General Abrams, the leader who Republican Richard Nixon installed to replace Democrat appointee Westmorland in the Vietnam War. Abrams succeeded in fighting the communists to standstill while withdrawing all American forces from Vietnam. We were out by 1973 and it was only after we were out that an overwhelmingly Democrat Congress refused to live up to treaty obligations and abandoned the South Vietnamese to their fate at hands of communist north. The Sherman tank driven by Brad Pitt in this film was named after an appointee of progressive Democrat Woodrow Wilson. General Sherman led 119,000 Americans to their death in a war effort dictated by a progressive Democrat, fighting for nobody-knows-what. 58,000 Americans died in Vietnam fighting for the preservation for every freedom Americans hold dear. But according to left wingers, Vietnam was the bad war.)

I gave this film two stars instead of one because depiction of combat wherein tracer rounds are visible everywhere is realistic and good technological innovation in filmmaking. I give credit where credit is due.",1468886400,2,2791,5.193333333333333

6522349,5,B00M0GM4V0,"This is probably the best WWII movie since Saving Private Ryan. It's not better than Saving Private Ryan. But it's the best WWII movie since then.

The extreme attention to detail make this an immersive experience. Every visual is realistic and time period appropriate. The sets, the buildings, the uniforms, the tanks, the guns, etc...it's all done perfectly. Even tiny details like Brad Pitt's rank insignia on his sleeves. His character has been fighting for 3 years. He's obviously been promoted through the ranks while in Europe. So his rank chevrons aren't professionally sewn on like they would have been in the United States. They are hand sewn on somewhat sloppily, like they would have been if someone got promoted in the middle of a field and was sewing them on himself in the turret of a tank between battles. That kind of attention to detail is incredible in this film.

Another example you see like that are women wearing stockings with a seem of the back. It's not like they did close ups of the back of women's legs. But when you see a woman from behind briefly she's wearing seemed stockings. The costume designer took the time and energy to do details like that for things that are seem for a second at a time in the background. That kind of detail just makes the whole thing suck you into the film and make you feel like you're there.

Then there is the acting. They made the characters so real. The seasoned and experienced tank crew has that thousand yard stare and fears nothing. The 18 year old kid who just showed up with a new clean uniform looks terrified. (None of this is a spoiler. This is the first 3 minutes of the film) That's the way it would have been. Slowly you watch the kid with high morals learn that morality takes a back seat to staying alive in battle really quick.

The tank battles are nothing short of epic. They are so well done. They are well filmed. They are well choreographed. It's just amazing how stunning they looked and how realistic it all seemed. Even details like where the weak points of the German tanks were and such were accurate and well portrayed.

Ultimately the visuals and tanks and costumes are just what the film looks like. They are what make it visually appealing. But the story is what really sells it. The story isn't about tanks or battles. The story is about people and how people fighting in WWII committed everything to the war. Their lives, their souls, everything. It's about what men become in battle. It's an amazing film.

My only complaint is the scene in the German apartment. It just takes too long to make the point they are trying to make. It's about a 15 minute scene that could have been 5. The scene has it's place in the story. It's all part of the theme of Brad Pitt seeing himself in this young rookie tanker. I get the purpose of it. It just dragged on for too long.",1467763200,,2859,4.499036608863198

Getting back to Fury  this movie does not hold back from any of Action and the story is pretty active its not slow start to it will hook in you from the Start when Brad jumps and tackles a German Officer off his Sherman Tank named Fury .

It reminds me of a renewed respect for that generation and the costs they paid ( of personal, social, psychological and financial) for society (us) . I'm sure that is what Brad was after. He depicts an older young man, wise for his age, that is experienced from surviving the war from the African invasion until 1944 when we pummeled Germany into submission. He is aloof but aware and caring for his men's needs, hard and acutely serious about his job, yet we get glimpses of his softer side and the psychological damage he endured.

The movie has an actual Tiger I tank, the last remaining operating one in the world.  The equipment used by both sides looks quite authentic.  As a combat vet I can attest that the depictions of combat scenes are quite accurate!  I found myself ducking when I saw the tracer rounds on the big screen; the camera work is superior.

As a side note, the Sherman tanks depicted were in fact quite vulnerable to enemy fire and this is also depicted in the story line.  We should remember this side note when we talk about equipping our military today and in the future.

6522695,5,B00M0GM4V0,"The movie is probably more reality than hype, bravado, and much better than other over/poor acting skills from some previous movies "" like Saving Private Ryan"" where Vin Diesel dies a 45 second death bouncing off one thing and then another until he falls down and un-honorably dies.  The old westerns didn't even do that.  His character and acting killed the entire movie.  If you can block that out of your mind, then it was a decent movie.  Sorry for ranting and back to FURY.  Excellent movie, even considering Shia LaBoff.  Couldn't imagine him in a WWII movie.  Guess what, he was an A*Hole in it... surprise, but turned out to be a good guy underneath, committed, dedicated, and knew right from wrong.under the very difficult position of being in a war zone with many casualties.  It wasn't until sometime past half way that he didn't seem to be a total A*Hole, but you meet a very diverse crowd in the military and under situations where you may die at anytime, perhaps it is not out of character.  I would rate this an excellent WW II movie with all of the main characters involved.  Brad Pitt portrayed an excellent and slightly older leader of his crew as a sargeant.  He was just really a grunt inside like everyone else trying to survive and take care of everyone in his tank crew against odds that seemed to say they would not survive.  You live one day at a time. I would strongly recommend.  I've seen in two times.  ++++",1465171200,4,1436,4.515503875968992

6522784,5,B00M0GM4V0,"Fury is a movie about an M4 Sherman tank crew during the last few months of World War 2.

There are some technical problems with the tacticstechnical problems that are necessary to shoot a fictional movie.

As long as the viewer remembers that key factthat this is a historical fiction, and *not* a documentaryand can suspend disbelief about some of the tactical errors, this is a gritty movie that eloquently captures five tankers in combat.

I was a tanker, on the M1A1 tank with the US Army during Desert Shield & Desert Storm. I had been on active duty almost four years when we deployed. I have been on tank crews that did *everything* in this movie, at one time or another.

I've sat on the edge of the loader's hatch during a road march, with my gunner standing in nametape defilade just below me, and gave him a wet willie. Why? Because it's funny to watch a grown man flinch. Just like Grady does to Bible (well, a close analog of it with the moustache-touching). Chatted over the intercom with the Driver & TC about whose sister was better in bed, the TC's sister or the Driver's. Chocolate bar, whatever. It's all about giving each other a hard time, just like you do your other siblings.

In short, Fury is a pretty good approximation of how tanks crews act, react, and exist during combat. If you want tactically accurate, you'll probably need to watch the History Channel. If you want a modicum of understanding about how tankers think and act, this is your movie.",1464739200,2,1478,4.562264150943396

6522860,1,B00M0GM4V0,"I saw a documentary about the making of this film before I saw the film itself. In the documentary they went to great lengths to say how it did everyone a disservice to represent the German soldiers as foolish (not their exact words), then went on to make a movie that did exactly what they supposedly thought they should not do. First, in the big tank battle, for a movie supposedly trying to portray the Germans as skilled soldiers using the actual tactics of the war, has the German Tiger I crew do EVERYTHING wrong. A group of 5 Shermans is moving broadside across the Tiger's field of fire. If they were being portrayed as skillful soldiers as their documentary insisted they intended to, the Tiger would hit the FIRST Sherman, at which point the following tanks would be bunched together, stopped, with no room to maneuver. THEN the Tiger would hit the LAST Sherman, leaving the remaining 3 trapped BETWEEN two knocked out tanks with nowhere to go and ripe to be picked off before they could effectively react. INSTEAD, the Tiger hits the LAST Sherman FIRST, allowing the remainder to speed up, spread out, and turn to close the distance on the Tiger and attack it in turn. Idiotic.

THEN we have the climactic (more like anticlimactic) battle scene involving a BATTALION of SS infantry against one disabled Sherman. In any reasonably realistic battle under such circumstances, as soon as the Sherman reveals itself to be occupied, the Germans, well armed with Panzerfaust anti-tank weapons, would have freely maneuvered around the lame tank and knocked it out within minutes.

Basically, the movie makers get high marks for authenticity of uniforms, weapons, and armored fighting vehicles, and then promptly squandered that effort on an extraordinarily stupid movie.",1464393600,2,1773,4.946308724832215

6522887,1,B00M0GM4V0,"Before viewing the movie ""Fury"" I watched an interesting documentary on the making of the film.  The documentary indicated that great efforts were made by every member of the film's crew to achieve historically accurate details and also promised a rare battle scene with probably the last Tiger tank in operation.  I looked forward to watching what I hoped would be realistic movie but instead got new variation of an old story.  In this new version, American Troops are portrayed as extremely brutal but all the while justified because they are still saving the world from an 'evil' enemy.  Of course the 'evil' enemy is still the same old inept Germans and even though the US troops were portrayed in this film as war criminals that good old morale superiority still remains a constant theme in Hollywood.  This Hollywood portrayal included a scene where a US soldier raped a German girl  but still the lines between heroes and villains was never meant to be blurred in this film.  .

At first the film seems to have some basis in reality if you can ignore the opening scene where a tank commander (Pitt) leaps from behind the turret of his tank to kill a German officer mounted on a fine horse.  Typically, these types of films have two segments.  The first segment has to draw the viewer in without getting too fantastic, then slowly the second segment can begin where sensationalism will overcome realism.  And of course, this film progressively became unrealistic but the image makers know how work on the minds of their audiences with few noticing the steady transition.  Yes, the film has some interesting battles scenes early on and those scenes will thrill a great many viewers but I was very disappointed with this corny film.",1464220800,2,1737,4.791946308724833

6522892,4,B00M0GM4V0,"Fury is a good war movie. A lot better than most of the ones from my childhood. I appreciate the visceral realism of these modern war films that took their first lessons from Sam Peckinpah. War movies should be visceral, with lots of gruesome scenes of body parts flying and gore spattering everyone and everything. So what if the audience sees more gore than the average soldier! That's part of the point of war films: to horrify the peaceful audience. Much like Greek tragedy was extreme, to horrify and teach gratitude, that life isn't as bad as that portrayed: war films teach us to be horrified by it, so that we are glad we are not experiencing anything like it. Fury fits well into that genre. War films are not supposed to be entertainment, they are meant to convey a sense of sacrifice before we were even born, so that we could grow up in a peaceful world.

Technical accuracy is only there to convince the majority of the audience that what they are seeing is as good as the real thing. So that the story of the crew will be believable. So that the viewers will be invested in their fates. I found myself caring what was going to happen to them before the film was half over.",1464134400,,1186,4.415525114155251

Unfortunately, yet another attempt by the anti-American film industry to sully those that have fought to defend the very freedom that allows such lies to be distributed in the guise of entertainment.  My hope is that those that see this film will take the time to do some reading and learn the truth about how Americans helped to defeat the Axis in World War II.",1463270400,,851,4.761904761904762

6523291,5,B00M0GM4V0,"It's not pretty, but people need to know how bad it was for US troops in '44 and '45.  (And '42; hell, basically Wake Island until VJ day, with North Africa-to-Berlin on the other side of the pond).  A few bits of the movie are a touch on-the-nose, but overall, nothing is implausible.  Audie Murphy won his second Medal of Honor (which itself defies belief) holding back a German counter-attack from atop a knocked-out Sherman with a combination of the .50 and the radio (spotting for artillery), so even the slightly-implausible ending isn't without real-life precedent.  Pitt is excellent, although a bit too ""perfect"" as the American intellectual at war (think a Don Draper-type drafted to fight against an enemy with better weapons and a fanatical will to fight long after the outcome of the war had become inevitable).

Basically, this is one of the most honest war movies ever made, and I commend it that for that.  It is an abrupt departure from the sentimental (and military inaccurate) metaphor-dripping Thin Red Line, or the manufactured nobility of Saving Private Ryan.  There's no nobility in war, and there's no nobility in Fury.  And that's why you should watch it.",1461715200,,1180,4.894472361809045

6523374,5,B00M0GM4V0,"Excellent movie.  The ending was, over the top/Hollywood, but overall, a believable recreation that included the kinds of events that have been well documented from the European Theater WWII.

As to whether or not the movie was realistic, right now Im reading, Death Traps; the survival of an armored division in WWII.  This book was written by, Belton Cooper.  He was one of the men whose job it was to recover and repair damaged tanks from the battlefields during WWII (Europe).  His unit also provided what passed for the very brief training that was offered to tank replacements toward the end of the war.  He describes exactly the things that were depicted in the movie.  Fury was fortunate to even have had a five man crew by the last month of the war.  Belton describes what really happened; such a shortage of trained crews that some tanks were being operated with three man crews; commander/loader, gunner, and driver (NO assistant gunner/loader or hull machine gunner).  Untrained replacements, the likes of the films Norman character, were very common to encounter.  It was not at all unheard of for green tankers and their tanks to be destroyed on their way from the forward maintenance depot to their unit assembly areas.  The Germans were operating under even worse handicaps regarding the shortage of trained tank crews (not to mention the extreme shortage of tanks).
Similar to a scene in the movie, Belton even describes an occasion when an officer called for volunteers to recover the bodies (the pieces), and to clean up, the interior of a tank whose dead crew had been traumatically dismembered by enemy fire.
Indeed, the film makers were pretty meticulous about realism, holding a lengthy closed door meeting between the cast and actual 80+ year old veterans of tank warfare; Europe WWII.
People who claim that this movie is not realistic are simply not correct in that assessment.  There are still plenty of living eyewitnesses who will testify to the contrary.

The cast themselves are a pleasure to watch.  Jon Bernthal is perfectly cast as Coon Ass.  Bernthal (The Walking Dead) is almost unparalleled when it comes to portraying the morally ambivalent character type; the deeply flawed, not likeable, but not totally irredeemable character.  Pitt does his usual excellent job.  Lerman, Lebeouf and Pena are terrific as well.

My only complaint with the movie is with the ending.  The climactic battle is Hollywood; over the top, filled with flaws regarding the actual tactics an infantry unit would use in order to destroy an enemy tank, filled with flaws regarding the actual capabilities a lone tank would have in meeting such a threat and..not very believable.  But the worst part is that this movie would have been excellent with a more believable and accurate ending; nothing would have been sacrificed.  In other words, it was unnecessary to go where this story went and a better movie would have resulted if they hadnt.  And the final result would still have been the same!
But hey, its a movie.

There have been many, many war movies; many of them NOT very good.  Where does Fury rank?  That is endlessly debatable, for sure, but I would place it up there with the best ones; Das Boot, the serial, Band of Brothers, Saving Private Ryan, The Dirty Dozen.
Fury is an interesting look at WWII from a specific point of view, that of an American Sherman tank crew.  Enjoy it for what it is and don't let its flaws ruin a movie experience that has much to recommend it.  I give ""Fury"" five stars.",1461283200,12,3524,4.83

6523401,5,B00M0GM4V0,"There are som movies starring tank crew, so to say, but here is the first movie, to my knowledge, where the tank is more or less the main star. Brad Pitt, of course, is really the main human star, and there is an all-star cast supporting him. A very good war story, complete with romance, and excitement. From start to finish, ""Fury"" keeps one's interest and one hoping for a positive outcome. But, hey, it's one of the nastiest wars ever fought, with brave soldiers on both sides. Can't tell you how it ends, but there is a certain amount of predictability that doesn't ruin the narrative. Not in the least. If you've ever wondered what it might be light to have in the tank corps, watch this movie and hope you never have to do it. Those men had heuvos to do what they did and had to do. P.S. One of Brad Pitt's more interesting roles, let me just say.",1461110400,,854,4.277777777777778

If you read much at all about how tank fighting was, you'd realize that the chances that a few unsupported tanks would be sent to hold a crossroads would be low.  The problem was that by the end of the war, tankers realized how exposed they were with both German anti-tank missiles and better armed tanks.  American tankers began to get reaaaaaally nervous about being surrounded, cut off and killed.  Once again, I really liked the acting.

However, expecting film to be real in all respects is absurd. One purpose of fiction is to allow us to contemplate situations we may never encounter in life. Did Fury make you think? Good. Did the Tiger commander confront the American Shermans the way a true SS officer would? Who knows? In the heat of battle, right? Late in the war, on the ropes, dying a daily death, who can say what a lone tank commander, on his own facing unknown odds (yes, he could see 4 tanks--that didn't mean there weren't others) would do? You can? Right. It's ludicrous to discuss plot elements that could or couldn't, would or wouldn't happen. The reality is anything can happen and life is proof of it. Enjoy the movie for what it is: a reminder that there was much, much more to WWII than tickertape parades and kissing sailors and that the Greatest Generation, as David Ayers so aptly demonstrates, committed the ultimate sacrifice to save the world.

6523706,4,B00M0GM4V0,"Fury is a decent WWII flick but viewers who will want a large or overarching story should prepare for more of a snapshot, a few days in the life of an American mobile outfit that centers on Brad Pitts tank crew (they have to because the other tanks get fragged brutally) as they find themselves making a last stand that will only slow down, not stop, the enemy advancement.  Fury thus becomes a story of valor in the face of death and the hard cold realities of war.  It contains the requisite brothers sacrificing themselves for each other, the newbie unaccustomed to killing who has to learn that eventual reality is greater and more powerful than his cool ideology, and disparate personalities dealing with the inevitability of death and horrors of war.  As the tanks ramble across the muddy terrain they feel more like death traps or cold tombs than they do engines of terrific destruction.  This is because of how shockingly quick and easy so many of them are taken out of the game.  Its certainly not a glorification of the men in uniform, nor is it sanitized, but it fails to shock and overwhelm the senses like Saving Private Ryan did.",1458086400,2,1143,4.610837438423645

6523735,1,B00M0GM4V0,I realize movies often take liberties and imbelish. But to paint US soldiers as a bunch of filthy woman raping cowardly murderers is wrong and disgraceful to those who served during that horrible war. Same can be said of painting highly trained German soldiers as inept morons who can't take out a single tank without losing 500 men. Nevermind the youth nazi did it with one shot. Just dumb. Acting was bad. Scene having lunch with occupied German family was way too long. Yes I get it war is hell...but watching this garbage may have been worse.,1457568000,7,546,4.639175257731959

Obviously, when I received it here in the U.S. some 2 weeks later, it was from a region and in a format that was useless to me since my DVD player could not read it.

6523741,3,B00M0GM4V0,"It was an exciting movie showing the war through the eyes of a tank crew. Unfortunately I can only give three stars because of the over the top use of profanity and the fact that there were just too many characters that were unlikable. I know this was rated R and we have to expect the F-bomb but sometimes it seemed like there were more of them flying around than tracers from the machine guns. And I know that war is Hell and it can grind a human being down to his basest level, but let's not forget this is supposed to be entertainment. I'm not sure if I was more afraid of what the German soldiers were going to do to the crew, or what the crew was going to do to the German civilians they were liberating.

That said, when the fighting was going on and the crew had to be on its toes, working together like a machine, this film was on-the-edge-of-your-seat exciting. I now own this film and so I'll probably watch it again, but I may do some fast-forwarding.",1457395200,,963,4.233695652173913

Wax Figures would have had more realism or acting ability , the characters act like they are caught in a bad movie and just want to get it over with.
The Movie is a Fictional Portray of Historical events and not based on any actual Unit or Historical account,  with the idea that just filming a Tank Randomly driving along  , with no particular purpose,  with a crew that appears to be in some kind of daze or stupor is HOW U S TANKERS FOUGHT.
I CAN ATTEST THAT THIS WAS NOT HOW THE U S ARMY DID IT.

I place it on top with ""Saving Private Ryan"" although there are a few differences between the two lending a bit more authenticity to ""Saving Private Ryan.""  Still, it was amazing to watch the sole surviving German Tiger Tank in action, although there is a bit of stretch in the imagination regarding the battle between Brad Pitt's Sherman and the German Tiger.  The filming is beautiful and Brad Pitt and his tank team are fun to watch and easy to like.  The last scene, and I won't reveal the outcome, was nail-biting and again, stretched the imagination, but after all, this is a movie.  It entertains, captivates, and the acting leaves nothing to be desired.  Brad Pitt does an excellent job and does a nice southern accent.",1456617600,,766,4.637037037037037

6523930,4,B00M0GM4V0,"People decrying the historical and tactical inaccuracies are missing the point of this film. The film is not trying to tell the literal story of an actual tank crew from WWII, instead it is attempting to depict the cost of war. Brad Pitt's character, and his tank crew by extension, personifies the conflict which occurs when a civilized man is thrust into a world where brutality is survival. Someone once said that the first casualty of war is truth. This is inaccurate. The first casualty of war is humanity, the loss of truth is an extension of surrendering to the kill-or-be-killed world that is war. The Furies were Greek goddesses of justice and vengeance, hence the constant theme that the Germans deserved the rage portrayed; that justice was being enacted in their slaughter. Whether you retain humanity or whether you sacrifice it, surrendering to the basest of instincts, in order to attempt to make sense of the brutality and violence that is combat, THAT is the point of this movie.",1455321600,,996,4.864705882352941

While I hoped that Fury would be another 'Battleground' it falls somewhat short.  The script and story limits the actors in what they might bring to the screen.  As it is, the characters seem flat and 1 dimensional, as if they were stereotyped from other war films.  The real star here is the tank itself.  Writer/Director David Ayer gives us a very real vision of war within the tight confines of a WW2 tank.  Direction, then, is the highpoint of the film.

Recommended for viewers 17 and older.  'Fury' is a decent war film but won't take a place alongside some of the great war films of the past.",1454889600,,657,4.453781512605042

6524170,4,B00M0GM4V0,"Movie studios are getting more strident about promoting Blu-Ray. It would seem obvious they'd prefer to convert everybody to a single format so that they need produce only one version. Every disk has a promo for the Blu-Ray version and the packaging here highlights the fact that there are more supplements on the other format. Am I alone in finding it ironic that at the same time one is offered a free download copy of the movie one is also subjected to multiple screens warning against that very practise. The number of previews that automatically pop up before one gets to the feature seems endless and increasingly it gets more difficult to bypass them. But enough carping about packaging.

Brad Pitt produced and starred in this film but he wisely left it to someone else to direct. He's put on weight since the famous abs scene in Thelma and Louise but the camera is at pains to show off that though less defined they're still there. Pitt, of course, plays the leader of this tank crew.

The packaging again invokes Saving Private Ryan and Platoon in promoting a film about a tank crew in the closing months of WW#2. The blood and guts are graphic and we get to see them through the eyes of a raw recruit played by Logan Lerman. Shia LaBoef who played Harrison Ford's wise-cracking son in a recent Indiana Jones outing is barely recognizable as a Bible quoting/hymn singing fanatic. Although this is supposed to be an ensemble piece about the camaraderie of a 5-man tank crew it is obviously Pitt's movie.

War is hell but the message that a few men can make a difference and never give up have rarely been made more plainly. Their tank is home to these men and we join them even if we can't smell the gasoline and exhaust. We may be armchair soldiers but the experience appears realistic.

compared to Saving Private Ryan

These two very different movies have some uncanny similarities. Both are set in the final year of WW#2 among a small group of soldiers whose leader ultimately dies. Each has a name actor playing the principal role who gets saddled with a 5-ft 9-inch clerk/typist who has no combat experience and survives the war. Both young men challenge the ethics and mechanics of warfare and are horrified by the experience. Both teams operate behind enemy lines. Every team seems to need a Bible-quoting conscience.

""I was trained to type 60 words per minute.""

The language in Fury is remarkably free of profanity.

The Allies won WW#2 despite the disadvantage of inferior technology and weapons and a defence wall years in the making due to the weight of superior fire-power throwing wave upon wave of troops at the enemy. It was a war of attrition that ground up an entire generation of young men ultimately depending on old men, women, and children in an all-out struggle to defend the Fatherland.",1452643200,,2998,4.7093690248565965

We both left the theatre thoroughly impressed with the performance we had witnessed. While Fury is a fictional take on a tank crew during WWII, the accuracy of the depicted tanker life was spot on. The five male crew members all give the performances of their lifetime with star studded names like Brad Pitt and Shia LaBeouf, but gives new glory to younger actors like Logan Lerman. It was no surprise how excited I was when it finally released on DVD and took advantage of it by surprising my dad for Christmas.",1452556800,,620,4.544642857142857

6524191,4,B00M0GM4V0,"This is simply one of the best war movies I have ever seen, that coming from someone who has seen classics such as ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""The Longest Day"". On top of that I am an amateur historian (when it comes to war at least), who likes movies that have a very thorough attention to detail.
  On to the movie; The accuracy is second to none, no doubt about it. Some scenes, such as the final fight sequence are just a LITTLE far fetched, but it is Hollywood after all, so one cannot expect the kind of realism that would really have been present if this had actually taken place. It is not, after all, a documentary. Historical preciseness is also one of the things I look for in a historical fiction film, and this movie has it in spades. Scenes such as the fight with the Tiger (the personification of the Army doctrine of the time that it took four Shermans for every one Tiger, with the expectation that three of them would not survive) or the one when the Lieutenant's tank is hit with a Panzerfaust by a member of the Hitler Jugend, with him going up in flames (that really happened when a tank was hit with a weapon specifically designed to penetrate armor). Obviously, being Hollywood, there were mess ups in this context, such as how every one of the anti-tank guns that were encountered missed every shot (Being Pak 40's this would not have been the case)! The final fight was perhaps the worst instance of inaccuracy, but like I said, it is a MOVIE not a documentary!
  Acting is quite good also, with actors that have had respectable careers at the very least (Pitt's being a little better than that!). The characters did not have much development, which is not acceptable in any movie, but the rest of the movie was good so I was willing to overlook that fact.",1452124800,,1780,4.434250764525994

6524256,3,B00M0GM4V0,"Decent plot, horribly unauthentic combat.  Apparently the Germans suck at fighting because one tank basically mows down tons of Germans who for some reason are always missing with their tanks and anti tank cannons.  Additionally, no tanks in WWII ever fired while moving because you would always miss your shot, but in this movie every tank fires while moving.  Also, tanks always need troop support, so why are the tanks alone when they should be accompanied by soldiers? Everything inaccurate in this movie added up leads to a really unbelievable situation.

However the rage and ""fury"" every crew member had against the war, the world, and the Germans is believable, so I enjoyed the  raw aspect of that.

If you want a great plot and realistic combat, you should watch Band of Brothers.  Compared to that series, this is second rate.",1450915200,2,837,4.8936170212765955

Yeah, spoiler alert - a nazi soldier allows the cowardly, reluctant hero to live.  Talk about ruining the entire movie.  A studio exec probably said ""someone has to live.""

6524304,5,B00M0GM4V0,"This movie was the first war movie I enjoyed. It's characters were genuine and acted very well, it showcased the brutality and shocking nature of war in visceral fashion, and each time someone died, you felt it.

And yet, you saw what drove the characters in Fury to fight for what they believed in. You saw them risk their lives for what they believed in, and eventually choose to die for what they believed in, even as those beliefs were shattered in front of them and rebuilt imperfectly from the pieces every day. The horrors of war taxed their sanity, their willpower, their very humanity... In the end they couldn't (and you couldn't) tell if they were doing the right thing, if anyone was doing the right thing.

The music fit so perfectly, especially during the final scene, that you couldn't help but be swept up in each moment. Emotions ran high for me as the final scene played out.

So, to revisit an earlier point, what were they fighting for? What did they believe in? -- Survival? Perhaps. Good over Evil? Seldom does anything fit that pattern, and it isn't here. In the end, it wasn't Survival or Good that they were fighting for, but loss and anger. Loss of their old lives and their comrades. Anger at what they were forced to do and what they and the world had become, but most of all, fury for those whom they were fighting, whom in their minds had destroyed what they knew and forged a world of conflict and loss in it's place.

And when the anger, the fury is gone, you are left with a sense of loss beyond anything a movie could normally make you feel. You wonder at that moment, through the main character's eyes, if it all was truly worth it.",1450051200,,1667,4.437908496732026

My father fought with the 13th Armored Division in WW2, told me plenty, and he would have said the events in this film would never have happened. Encountering a Waffen SS unit carrying panzerfausts attacking Pitt's dismantled tank, and what's portrayed is a shame and an insult to your intelligence. Those panzerfaust shells would go right through a Sherman tank, my father saw one penetrate a 2 foot wide concrete wall. The script in this film also smacks of Hollywood nonsense, the portrayal of fraternization with German women was strictly forbidden. The director and writer took too much lurid liberty with this one. I recommend to pass this film up and don't waste your time. Go rent any of the ""old ones""  that are far superior and more realistic such as: ""Battleground"" (1949), "" A Walk in the Sun"" (1945), and ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" (1946).",1450051200,2,1005,4.905882352941177

I could sometimes see the boys they once were, but most of the time I imagined that their mothers would barely recognize them as they threw their former selves aside and became ferocious, relentless warriors.  Yet I also felt very proud of them, and shared their consuming fury.  I know a bit about WWll, but I had never really considered how terrible the last weeks in Europe were for our soldiers, as they fought the last, perhaps most desperate, most futile, most senseless, yet necessary, battles (Russia and the South Pacific not withstanding). What struck me was how instantly people died--here one second, gone the next. I know that sounds stupid, but it was forcefully and well done in this movie.  I also thought the complete transformation of Norman over a period of 24 hours was remarkably well done.

The movie seemed to want to talk people into believing that.  They seemed to hold up evil as kind of a virtue...or at the very least a lifestyle equally  as valuable as being good.  They even showed the new kid becoming bad as an essential part of him growing up.  Everyone isn't evil and there are plenty of people who will remain virtuous even under those circumstances.

All in all, the movie was very depressing, but not for the reasons that seem the most obvious.  If this is an accurate representation of what the US military is (or was) then we are very much they bad guys.  We're supposed to be different than this.

We can do better than this...and if you want peace of mind, even in circumstances like this, staying true to morality will get you through it better than abandoning it.",1449792000,,814,4.489795918367347

6524679,5,B00M0GM4V0,"In one way, this is a big, bombastic, noisy W.W. II movie (and I found that to be 100 percent perfectly captivating).

In another way, it's a contemplative, insightful character study. I found that the film was at its most absorbing when it was in that mode.

I was particularly fascinated by the study of the relationship between the Brad Pitt character and some of the crazier, more dangerous, more unstable members of his tank crew.

The Pitt character was definitely walking a tightrope here. He had to depend upon these guys in life and death situations. He needed their loyalty and trust, and he needed them to obey commands without question.

If he kept them on a short leash, they would have rebelled and he would have lost them and that may have cost him his own life and quite possibly the lives of innocents as well.

But if he kept them on an excessively long leash...well...just for an example, think about what they might have done to that young German girl that they ended up sharing breakfast with. If you've seen this movie, you know exactly what I mean. (That situation was masterfully portrayed from start to finish. The full treatment.)

Pitt had to find a middle ground between some sort of short leash and...a leash that was quite a bit longer. The middle ground in that situation took the form of telling them that if any one of them (the crazies) touched the German girl, he would kick their f-ing teeth in.

But when one of the crazies began to challenge Pitt a bit, at least orally, Pitt reined him in by standing up at the breakfast table and spitting his breakfast out at him. The crazy, at that particular moment, was attempting to get Pitt to loosen the leash a bit more; but by spitting his breakfast on the crazy, Pitt was reiterating his command, this time quite a bit more forcefully, that no one lay a hand on the young, beautiful German girl. (Again, this scene was masterfully written, acted, and directed.)

From time to time, however, the Pitt character would prove to the crazier members of his tank crew that he could be one of them, e.g,, his treatment of certain German S.S. men that he would encounter (his character playing judge, jury, and executioner right on the spot).

Does the above tie in with the grand finale in the movie? Does the above some how tie in with the Pitt character wanting to go up against the S.S. by his lonesome against horrific odds? What was it that Nietzsche said about staring into the void and not seeing yourself and that's what keeps you out of the void? Was Pitt burned out on looking into the void and seeing his reflection? Would obliterating the S.S result in a cleansing of sorts? What kind of thinking would that represent on the part of the Pitt character...?",1446508800,,2743,4.558943089430894

6524782,1,B00M0GM4V0,"Pure fantasy. As a diehard WWII buff who has read about everything ever published regarding tank warfare in WWII, this movie get's nothing right. From the moronic ineptitude of the German soldiers attempting to defeat a lone and immobile Sherman with rifles and bayonets (forgetting to use the antitank weapons they were shown to be carrying in abundance a few moments before) to the entire American Army not only committing atrocities against hapless prisoners, but also doing it in a truly gleeful manner and with not a single dissenting voice or even disapproving facial expression.  This movie is an insult to German and Allied combat veterans alike.  The most likely explanation is that the movie is pure politically motivated propaganda, designed to discredit not only war (which is worthy of discrediting) but also the military in general. The tragedy is the  veterans of this war, both Allied and German, were generally a courageous, self-sacrificing, and downright heroic lot.

The battle scenes are intense in showing the fear tank crews faced when staring down a Tiger or German soldier with a panzerfauss, both of which could ruin their day. This is a movie you'll want to see over and over. Brad Pitt gives a stellar performance as a battle hardened sergeant that has earned the respect of his crew and unit because his toughness, tenacity and leadership have carried them through the war.",1444867200,2,712,4.5625

6524936,1,B00M0GM4V0,"Very strange movie. I was hoping for a more interesting movie: up close with an American tank crew in an under-gunned, under-armored Sherman tank, in Europe, during WWII. There are, though, three excellent battle scenes that I bookmark and re-watch.  Excellent realism, showing shells missing their targets and ricocheting, tanks trying to reinforce their armor with phone poles.  Dialogue was pretty realistic with how guys talk to each other, with its F-bombs and emasculating banter.

The rest of the movie was just peculiar.  The strange scene where the tank crews were in the house with the French women ran way too long with no clear purpose.  The German troops marching [endlessly] toward Fury, near the end of the movie, along with the unlikely defense of the crossroads, all made for a very strange movie.

And that is why the calculated murder of the captured U.S. soldiers (apporx. 70-80) at Malmedy during the Battle of the Bulge was so shocking. The American hero, and there were many, were NOT cold heartless war criminals. They did their duty;a duty that was often horrible enough without violating the Geneva convention.

The conclusion of the film is largely unrealistic. A solitary tank would be very vulnerable to the panzerfaust, handheld bazooka like anti-tank weapon. This would have ended our heroes gallant fight quickly. Ask the Soviet Russians, who suffered 300,000 casualties subduing Berlin subject to that same weapon that even civilians could wield.

This is the only modern film i know of that deals with a  tank crew. American tanks were under armoured and out gunned by their German counterparts.

6525135,5,B00M0GM4V0,"I'm a Steven Zaloga fan. I sat here and watched this Brad Pitt war movie while Zaloga's latest bbok was on my side table. Zaloga is the a historian who writes books about tank warfare focusing in the Sherman.

I was a bit put off at the beginning of this movie when the titles set the scene by claiming that the Allies were outclassed by the better German tanks.

That's sort of true - but only sort of. The overriding fact that no one should ever forget is that we won the war and the Nazis were pounded into mush. The Sherman was in fact arguably the best tank in the world. The Brits used it very well to clean the Nazi clock at El Alamein. But that was 1942 and the movie takes place in late 1945. Lt. General Lesley McNair had made a decision to not upgrade the Sherman. He misread the position and so at Normandy and thereafter our boys were in an older medium tank facing more modern heavy tanks like the Tiger.  But remember - we won.

We won because the Germans only made about 2,000 Tigers whereas we made almost 50,000 Shermans. The Russians who also froze tank development and went with a proven medium tank - the T-34 - made 80,000 of them. So who was right about tank design depended on your Army rank. If you were a poor SOB in a Sherman or a T-34 facing  a Tiger which had a better gun and much thicker armor - you were in big trouble. But if you were a general it was probably a better decision to swamp the battle field with your simpler more conservative and proven tanks.

There are three major factors in tank effectiveness: armor, armament and automotive. The Tiger and the Panther (the new German tanks introduced after El Alamein) had much better guns than the Allied tanks. The only American tank with an adequate gun was probably the Sherman Firefly created by the British. It could knock out a Tiger at normal battle distances. But we had very few Fireflies and our field commanders didn't want them. Tanks in WWII had two types of ammunition. One kind of round specifically for tanks and another more general purpose high explosive round for softer targets. Tank versus tank combat was relatively rare. The movie gets this right. The 'Fury' shoots infantry, trucks and buildings much more frequently than it shoots other tanks. But of course if you run into a hostile tank on the battlefield anything else but a armor peiercing round won't do you much good.

But American tank commanders preferred the older 75mm High Explosive round that was better for soft targets than the newer 76mm round that was better for tanks. Partly this because that the 76mm armor piercing round still wasn't good enough to peierce a Tiger of panther's frontal armor. So how did we win?

The movie gats the tank to tank battle right. The fight with the Tiger is very well scripted. First of all it's one Tiger against four Shermans. That's about right. At Normandy a single Tiger often defeated four or five Shermans. That was very bad for our tankers morale. But Shermans did defeat Tigers albeit often at great cost.

There never were many Tigers and they broke down often - so did Panthers. The Sherman was much better automotively than the German tanks. Patton relieved Bastogne by driving great distances on public roads. The German tanks couldn't do that. They had to be hauled close on trains or trucks.  It sounds silly but it was also important that the Sherman got much better gas mileage. The Germans were always starved for fuel.  The consequence was that if tank met up on the field it was likely that there would be more Shermans that got there.

There was also a couple background scenes that contributed. There was the scene where the tankers look up to see our bombers flying over. We had concentrated on bombing airplane facilities as part of 'Operation Pointblank' up until D-Day. But thereafter we also bombed tank factories too. By this point in the war the German tanks were suffering from inferior steel. Without the alloys available the German tank armor was brittle. The late war Tigers and Panthers were not as tough as they had been a couple years earlier.

But an even more relevant scene was the one where they capture a group of tiny German school kids who are fighting as infantry. Germany was out of soldiers by this stage for the fight - especially the well trained specialty pilots and tankers.  At the time of El Alamein the German tankers were better trained than the Americans. The Brits did well but the Americans didn't. But by this time period all the German tanker Aces had died on the Eastern Front. Our guys were better.

You can see that in the film's duel with the Tiger. The German tank commander was a fool. He should have stayed at long range rather than to have close with the Shermans. None of the Shermans mounted a gun that could deal with the Tiger's frontal armor and  theGerman 88 could have knocked them out while still out of their range to do the Tiger any damage.

In close a Sherman had some advantages. The Sherman's cannon could traverse faster that the guns on the Tiger or Panther. Shermans were faster and more nimble and finally all tanks are vulnerable from behind or above. The movie gets it right, The only way a Sherman could defeat a Tiger one-on-one on an open field is a close up battle of maneuver.

Brad Pitt is brilliant. He's the American Olivier. He started as a 'pretty boy' screen ornament but has developed into arguably our finest actor. Also Jason Isaacs - a Brit - plays a yank so well I could hardly recognize him.

Altogether one of the best war movies ever made and unquestionably the best tank war movie ever made.",1442534400,,5609,4.524703557312253

The last stand is a compliment to those men who stood against the German Army there and around Bastoyn, Belgium by small units of engineers, artillery, ant-tank platoons who held up the enemy long enough to have them lose their advantage.

The camera pans up and across the crest of a small rise.  The smoking and burning silhouettes of tanks cover a debris-ridden battlefield, including a couple of Panther tanks.  A Sherman tank sits amongst the wreckage.  All is quiet.  Into this scene rides some German (officer?) on a white horse leisurely clip clopping along.  ""Do-dee-do-dee-do, just out for a morning ride.  Good thing we must have cleared this battlefield and pushed the Americans way back so I can just plod along here with no real purpose or concern.  Nothing to worry about here.""  ""Iii-eeeee!!!!""  From out of the shadows of the top of the Sherman, a wild man vaults onto the horseman, propels them both to the ground, and then stabs the horseman deep into the eye as the camera goes in for a closeup.  After pulling his knife out, we see the ambusher is none other than Brad Pitt.  He mumbles some stuff, pats the horse on the head and then hops back on the Sherman and climbs in.  We quickly discern his tank was disabled in the battle and the crew is hiding inside trying to get it fixed.  Good thing Brad took care of the only person on either side curious about how the battle came out or these guys might be in a world of trouble.

A few war crimes presented as standard operating procedure, some more odd events, and multiple f-bombs later, we get to an improbable battle at the end and we're done - bringing it all artistically together by showing a white horse again.",1440892800,19,1488,4.520599250936329

6525309,3,B00M0GM4V0,"Fury is really a film of 2 parts.  The first hour of the movie is pretty believable and realistic for the most part.  The second hour of the film is pure Hollywood and more fantasy than reality.  The actors do a good job for the most part.  The film really convenes how cramped and small of an environment the inside of the tank is.  The actors roles seem to show them as a dysfunctional family at each other's throats most of the time.

The most exciting part of the film is the duel between 4 American tanks and a lone Tiger tank.  You kind of wish the rest of the film could be this exciting.  Many other reviewers have pointed out the obvious references to Saving Private Ryan and other popular war movies and they are all correct.  I felt like we have seen this tank crew before in several different films.

I have a cousin who just got out of the US Army infantry who also saw the film.  He told me no way would a whole German Division waste that much time or Manpower on one disabled tank near the end of the film.  They would have just used a Panzerschreck or just called in a Tiger Tank or ranged 88 gun on the tank.  Worst case they would have just gone right around out of range of the Sherman tanks guns.  To continue their advance.

Another reviewer made a great point that the German who opened the tank hatch would have dropped a grenade down it first just to be on the safe side.  He would not have to really think about it just act on  instinct or would been ordered to grenade it first by his commander.  Likewise the US infantry would have done that kind of thing if the roles were reversed.  I thought the same thing while watching that scene in the theater.

Fury is a pretty decent popcorn movie.  Kind of a Debbie downer in a lot of ways.  I hope the next Hollywood WW2 film tank film is made about the battle of Kursk in Russia  the biggest tank battle of the war.",1440720000,,1888,4.1689750692520775

6525366,3,B00M0GM4V0,"One can nearly smell the muck, degradation and decay of both humans and humanity. The violence is relentless, horrifying. Fury's depiction of the conditions of war provide a compelling backdrop for the story of a tank crew shaped, deformed by the conditions of combat and war. Fury begins with the ongoing Allied invasion of Germany and culminates with ""War Daddy's"" (Pitt) men facing a dire crossroads, their collective decision and the ensuing consequences. And no, there are no happy endings. Such is war, after all.
Strong, earnest performances lend heartbreaking credibility to this most anti of war films yet you'll be left feeling that something is  amiss, some element or plot development keeps Fury from being a great, instead of good film. It is as if the screenwriters had such a compelling backdrop and story going they lost control of it and as a result Fury stumbles where it should have soared.
War ""buffs"" (strange, that) will appreciate greatly the painstakingly constructed sets, costumes and props. Pitt fans will be validated. And everyone will be impressed with Shia LaBeouf's superb performance as Boyd ""Bible"" Swan.",1440028800,2,1138,5.151351351351352

I have really never seen a such a realistic  movie about a tank division as this one,  other than similar movies such as Battle of the Bulge and Anzio . Now this is hard hitting and bloody. No holds barred and upclose in your face action. First time you get  the feeling up close how these guys felt locked in a iron clad on tracks all the time. They practically lived in it. The Shermans were good tanks as far as agility and maneuvering, but had thin armor compared to a Tiger tank. Most Shermans were scrap metal when hit by a 88 shell from a Tiger and the men inside died by fire and shrapnel. A horrific death.",1439683200,3,717,4.296296296296297

I KNOW IT WAS WAR, AND THERE WAS MUCH MORE VIOLENCE EXPERIENCED BY THOSE WHO ACTUALLY WERE THERE. BUT DOES VIOLENCE HAVE TO BE DEPICTED IN DISTASTEFUL AND SOMETIMES DISGUSTING MANNERS TO MAKE A GOOD MOVIE? I THINK NOT. BRAD PITT GAVE A VERY GOOD PERFORMANCE IN THIS MOVIE, BUT A COUPLE OF SCENES COULD HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT WITHOUT DIMINISHING THE IMPACT OF THE STORY. ONE OF MY FAVORITE BRAD PITT MOVIES WAS ""MEET JOE BLACK"" AND, OF COURSE, ANTHONY HOPKINS' PERFORMANCE CONTRIBUTED GREATLY TO THE QUALITY OF THAT MOVIE, BUT THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO VIOLENCE DEPICTED THERE, OTHER THAN BOARDROOM BETRAYALS.

Some examples include:
1. German machine gun nest firing on tanks at a distance.  In reality they would have waited till the tanks were closer to inflict causalities on the accompanying infantry and fired along with the anti-tank guns.
2. German anti-tank guns concealed and ready to ambush U.S. tanks cant even hit slow moving targets coming straight at them.
3. Tracer rounds from all sides look more like a sci-fi laser battle.
4. U.S. forces have the most AMAZING luck in every situation.
5. The U.S. tanks engage a Tiger late in the movie. The Tiger drives toward them both lowering the effectiveness of it armor and the accuracy of its fire. Of course it misses several rounds before getting a hit. American tanks hit with almost every shot. A Tiger would have stop and used its 88 cannon at a distance. Thus maximizing its armor and firing accuracy.

Picture quality is great. To be expected in this day and age but they did a good job on this one.

Sound quality is where this movie shined for me. The ricochets of large caliber anti tank guns/tank guns themselves were shaking the walls and floor of the theater I saw this in. At home, I strongly recommend using an audio system with a subwoofer to watch this. It adds a TON to the film.

The plot was....so/so. This is definitely not Hunt for the Red October type plot but it is functional. The ""love"" story sequence took a star off for me.

I'd strongly recommend this film to any war movie buff and have watched it myself approximately 5 times since it was released to theaters.",1438905600,,938,4.194444444444445

6525522,5,B00M0GM4V0,"I'm by no means a Brad Pitt fan.  Usually he comes off as someone who relies on his good looks to get by which makes him an easy favorite for the ladies (millions of ladies- seriously, millions) but it's undeniable that he totally NAILS an extremely memorable performance here.  Yes, this is another World War II movie (this one taking place in Germany).  We've all seen several of these.  However this one is particularly worth watching because of the characters.  They're all memorable.  If you watch war movies for the violent factor, well this one is exceptionally violent.

Besides Brad Pitt, you have the pushy and mouthy Jon Bernthal (obviously someone who targets the weak), the slick and equally mouthy Michael Pena, and perhaps the best one Logan Lerman.  You see Logan plays that typical baby-faced timid and frightened young kid who doesn't look at all like he belongs in a war of this magnitude and yet, here he is, totally scared out of his freakin' *mind* (and yeah, as expected, he's an easy target for Jon's character and to a lesser extent, Michael's character as well even though Logan and Michael fight together in the same tank).  Brad Pitt often guides the kid and basically turns him into a man.  He makes Logan unafraid and teaches him how to stand up and fight.  He teaches Logan that it's either kill or be killed out here, and there's no time for emotions or trivial matters such as verbal arguments.  This honestly makes Logan arguably even better than Brad's character by the conclusion, but both are pretty even.  They both share the main character role.

This movie has several really stellar moments.  Perhaps the best one is when Brad and Logan enter a house with two German women (one of them hiding in the floor) and they actually get along and have dinner with the ladies.  One of the ladies is Alicia von Rittberg.  Just one look at her and it would be impossible to even *think* about hitting on her in any kind of forceful/sexual way.  Brad senses this and that's why nothing bad happens to her.  Well I mean... nevermind!  She isn't used as a sex object, let's put it that way.  I'm surprised the women didn't retaliate with guns of their own.  I would understand if they did.  This is their country and their home after all.  Anyway Alicia is the type of girl you'd want to protect from all harm.

The one thing that sort of rubs me the wrong way about this movie is that these American soldiers took a lot of personal satisfaction in their brutal killings of the Germans.  I can understand wanting/having to kill in the heat of the moment (especially in the case of Brad since he was fighting in several countries before arriving to Germany so he's seen/experienced more than most) but these guys basically showed no remorse whatsoever.  Then again it's not like I've ever been in a war personally, so it's not like I can sit here and say for certain how I'd react myself.  Anyway another memorable segment is when the Americans get involved with a German tank out in the middle of a field much bigger than any of the tanks they're using.  This leads to some really intense and worrisome moments.

Of course, without spoiling anything major, the very best segment is the one at the very end.  The final battle I guess it should be called.  This is when some die and some live, but I won't reveal which ones.  This is when the emotions finally get the best of these American soldiers which of course intensifies the shootings, killings and surrounding explosions.  So many explosions I honestly couldn't tell if it turned to night after several minutes went by, but I figure no, since realistically there's no way given the small number of soldiers a battle could've lasted *that* long.  It's quite graphic- the entire movie (you'll see people get shot and killed often and it's never pretty of course, but it's exceptionally gruesome here with German heads being shot off their bodies, etc).  I even feel for Logan's character when they show what appears to be scattered remains of a face, and they force Logan to clean it up.  Obviously he jumps out of the tank sick to his stomach, as I'm sure we'd all be given such an assignment.

Overall there's just so much violence with memorable characters, this has to be one of the more hard-hitting WWII movies out there (up there with Saving Private Ryan perhaps, but some people really despise the Tom Hanks film for some reason so I won't compare the two).  The emotional punch is surprising since you really feel angry that this war is taking place and so many innocent lives (both American and German) are being lost, and you really want everyone to come out of this war safe and well.  Overall what a movie.  Fantastic acting all around, memorable characters, obviously the storyline is as violent as you'd expect if you've ever seen a war movie before, and I highly recommend Fury.",1438819200,,4875,4.635198135198135

6525694,4,B00M0GM4V0,"THE FILM: So many war films have been made that it's very hard to create something new or original anymore, at least as far as the drama and story is concerned. David Ayer's gritty, realistic style is pretty much a perfect fit for this type of film, but it was lacking in rich characters and emotional heft (at least to me). The story is about a Sherman tank crew during the final days of WWII who must face overwhelming odds to survive. You have Brad Pitt as the chief, Michael Pena as the driver, Jon Bernthal as the loader, Shia LeBeouf as the gunner, and Logan Lerman as a doe-faced replacement who must overcome his reluctance to fight and kill. I don't think you could have a more stereotypical group of people in a war film. Brad Pitt seems to be playing a more grounded, stoic version of his character from INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS, while Michael Pena and Jon Bernthal barely register as little more than caricatures of people. Shia LeBeouf actually acquitted himself rather nicely as a Bible-quoting soldier, which at least distinguished him somewhat from the rest. Logan Lerman, as a conduit for the audience, has a good character arc although it's one we've seen dozens of times before. From a writing perspective, FURY settles for ""been there, done that"" and it suffers as a result. However, David Ayer knows his way around action and the various battle sequences were pretty awesome. I don't think I've seen a war film centered around tank warfare, so at least that was new to me. The violence was gritty and realistic, but not overly graphic. I also thought that the color palate and cinematography helped to create a very distinctive mood and atmosphere, helped along by the often melancholy score. Aside from this, there was a respite from the violence in the middle where Logan Lerman's and Brad Pitt's characters get some development as they temporarily shack up in a house with two German girls. This segment of the film had my favorite part, which is when Logan Lerman plays a song on the piano and one of the girls starts singing along. It was the sweetest moment in an otherwise rather dark film. Thematically, I think the film was often at odds with itself. It wants you to see the protagonists as heroes, yet other than the fact that they're fighting for what we already know is the winning side, little they do would suggest that they are heroic. I'd also be hard-pressed to call any of the characters ""complex."" When it comes down to it, FURY is a rather simple war film that has visceral action and intense visuals. It should do fine for the average film-goer, but I was left wanting a little more.

THE EXTRAS: This film was a passion project for David Ayer, and it really came through with the special features they included on the Blu-ray. There is an astounding 56 minutes worth of deleted/extended scenes that are mostly additional character moments. The film was already pretty long to begin with, so I can understand why these were cut, but they still fleshed out the characters a little more to my liking and made them somewhat more sympathetic. Exclusive to the Blu-ray are three featurettes that go behind the scenes for a look at how they shot the tank action sequences, working with authentic WWII tanks, and an awesome featurette that has interviews with some actual 2nd Armor Division veterans. There's also another featurette that has the usual cast/crew interviews and a fairly large gallery of production stills. Altogether, these extras enhanced my enjoyment of the film and I suspect that I'll warm up to it a little more with future viewings.

OVERALL: FURY does not want for lack of realism, David Ayer's stock and trade, but I did find it lacking an emotional element (aside from the camaraderie) that is in my favorite films, war or otherwise. What Ayer did is to create a film (and it was shot on film) that captures the visceral nature and horrors of war, and obviously that's not going to be pretty, glamorized or romanticized. It's honest, and it is what it is, basically. Normally, I dive right into the supplements right after finishing a film, but this time I let it marinate for a few days, and I feel like maybe this was best (at least for FURY). After feeling almost bludgeoned by the film, the special features, I feel, deepened my appreciation for it, and what David Ayer and his cast were able to accomplish. FURY may not be the best war film ever made (or, according to the cover, the best one since SAVING PRIVATE and PLATOON), but it comes really close.",1437609600,2,4515,4.6708542713567835

6525732,2,B00M0GM4V0,"I have to give this two stars because the equipment is accurate.  The Shermans tanks are what the allies actually used during the war, because we made 50,000 of them.  And the German Tiger tank is actually just that, a German Tiger tank.  The one battle where four Shermans take on a Tiger, and only one American tank survives--by flanking the Tiger and shooting it in the backside--is absolutely accurate.  That is exactly what was expected to happen when Shermans took on the vastly heavier armor and better main gun (the 88) of the Tiger.  The Americans in that situation would expect, at best, a 3 to 1 loss rate.  If they played their cards right.  Overall, the Tiger tanks usually prevailed at a rate of 10 or 12 to 1.

Unfortunately the rest of the movie is awful, almost to the point of being unwatchable.  The crew of the Sherman tank ""Fury"" is head by Brad Pitt, who is a vicious, jaded killer.  The rest of the crew, except for the new addition, are cretinous monkeys, utterly repellant and horrifying.  I don't what point they were trying to make by having the crew be a bunch of monkeys, but it was not fun to watch, to put it very, very mildly.

And the final scene isn't realistic at all.  The SS unit they encounter at the end of the movie supposedly has only three Panzerfausts, the excellent German anti-tank weapon, and they all miss or malfunction from point-blank range.  That's extraordinarily unlikely.  Even in the very late stages of the war, an SS column would probably have had a tank or two, and probably two or three self-propelled guns like the Sturmgeschutz or the Jagdpanther.  But even if not, they would have been well stocked with Panzerfausts and would have made short work of a single Sherman with no infantry support whatsoever.  The final battle was, frankly, just silly.  So, on balance, there was one excellent, technically correct battle between four Shermans and a Tiger, and the rest of the movie was all complete nonsense.  And the ""heroes"" were just repellant animals who you have no sympathy for or identification with at all.",1437350400,2,2073,4.645604395604396

Where is the Hero?  Why make our soldiers of the ""Greatest Generation"" look like a bunch of murderers and rapists?  Is it to bring these actions to todays standards of ""Political Correctness""?  Is it to alter the fact that any action of this sort would not have been tolerated by any of the observers (other Soldiers, NCOs, and/or Officers) and would have led to immediate prosecution under the ""Military Code Of Conduct""?  I think pretty much that all the characters portrayed in the film tolerated what was going on and are as guilty as main bunch.

War becomes a blur of moments of shear boredom followed by pure terror praying that you would live for the next 30 seconds and the next. The realism reminded me of ""Saving Private Ryan"" with a no holds bar room brawl approach. The blood, mud, smell of crap and piss could almost be smelled by the movie goer. Watching your friends be turn into a lifeless pile flesh and bones or less. You could just feel the building of fear and excitement in your as you find yourself becoming one with Sgt. Fury and the tank crew. I wish the movie lasted longer by telling the movie viewer how Sgt. Fury helped the war while standing his ground. Of if they were seen as heroes or soldiers just doing what the Army trained them to do.

And it is about those that survived the experience.

This gritty, ultra-realistic fact-based war movie is one of the best of the best as far as raw authenticity with stellar performances from the entire cast.  Undoubtedly both Pitt and LaBeouf's crowing achievements as actors and what I hope to be an amazingly inspired, true launching point for the young Lerman.  Exquisitely written and acted, this harsh, vulgar, & unmistakably brutal depiction of tank combat was constructed out of a collective of true accounts from our brave, often forgotten, WWII veterans.  For the most part is a tribute to our soldiers who literally faced hell and death on a moment to moment basis.  Of course, The LA elite tries, through some veiled references, to portray some of our boys in uniform as barbarians and potential rapists.  That sad facet is the only blight on this otherwise well crafted and executed military feature.  What an utter shame it is that Hollyweird has such a noticeable disdain for those who provide them the very liberties to exist at all.  Director Ayer, who is known for excessively violent dribble, finally earns major credibility and his probably enormous paycheck with this indisputable success.  God bless the men and women who preserve and protect our freedoms amidst the eviscerating, unimaginable chaos, pain, and utter savagery of combat.",1436659200,,1386,5.097345132743363

6525869,4,B00M0GM4V0,"During the end of World War II, a young, rookie soldier, who was a typist/clerk was suddenly..., thrust into the front lines of battle by way of immediate assignment. Like it or not, to a weary, battle-hardened, Sargent named - ""Wardaddy"" (Brad Pitt) and his 5-man, Sherman Tank Crew. The time is April 1945 and the Allies are eager to end the war. Stationed within the heart of Germany, they are sent out to annihilate the enemy in a series of ferocious tank fights. But, the FURY (the name of their tank), bravely encounters and continues to fight against circumstances beyond their control, as well as, in the face of overwhelming odds. Too not only defend themselves but more importantly, in hopes of ending the war as a result of their heroic actions. This intense action and adventure drama, features gripping and explosive combat action with the additive of stoic faith and dialogue from of all people - ""Wardaddy."" His quickie sermon theme? Lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes and the pride of life (I John 2:16 KJV). Why? Because as they say, ""...there are no atheists in the foxholes."" War is indeed - detestable! But this compelling war film, is not. Entertaining and engaging, this film comes to it's audience in color, on a single-disc, DVD and runs approximately 135-minutes. And, as appropriate to the subject matter and story's theme, the contents are very brutal, violent in speech and action, full of bloodshed and very graphic in it's depiction of human carnage. Plus, it has a climactic, FURYous and very powerful, Sherman Tank fight..., that you won't soon forget. And, although it has a few slow spots - still and all, it is an enthralling film that is worthy of your viewing time. So, if you're into war movies, then here is another one for your collection.

The Crew of 'Fury'
'Sergeant Don 'Wardaddy' Collier' --'Brad Pitt'
'Boyd 'Bible' Swann' --'Shia Labeouf'
'Norman Ellison' --'Logan Lerman'
'Grady 'Coon-Ass' Travis' --'John Bernthal'
'Trina 'Gordo' Garcia' --'Michael Pena'
It's April 1945 the Allies are advancing through German territory, after a tank battle 'Wardaddy' and his crew head back to base, during the
battle they had lost one of their number.
They are assigned a rookie to the replace of their lost comrade 'Norman' who had only been in the U.S Army for 8 weeks and obviously has
no combat experience.
The battle weary-crew of 'Fury' are ordered to join up with 'Baker-Company' ......en-route they are ambushed and lose some of the tanks in the
fire-fight, there are only four remaining, the 'Sergeant' has to assume command of the remaining Sherman's.
They are soon back in the thick of battle facing stubborn and intense resistance, their enemy often just children defending their homeland by
order of the German High-Command.
Rookie 'Norman' has had to learn fast having to adjust his mind-set to the realities of war however reluctantly, the crew of Fury have no time or
patience for beginners, they have to depend upon each other to survive.
The town that had been designated as the target - taken, the crew have a little time to chill, but, their war is not over, they will have to go even
deeper into enemy territory and will face overwhelming odds before - their war is done........
There are several graphic and brutal battle scenes along with many uncomfortable choices during which the brutal reality of war is well portrayed.
The film is certainly worth a viewing....
Good Picture and Sound Quality throughout.
The package includes a booklet that gives a background of the making of the film along with passages about the actors playing the role of the
Tank crew.

6526086,1,B00M0GM4V0,"A movie fraught with historical and technical inaccuracies as well as being to determine whether it is a war story or a politically-correct message movie

It contains gross historic inaccuracies. There is a scene where a black infantryman approaches Brad Pitt's character to tell him to report to the former's commanding officer. There were no integrated units in the US Army until 1945.

It contains gross technical inaccuracies. Combat scenes are repeatedly framed for the camera rather than to reflect small unit tactics. Whether it is US tanks bunched together in a line when attacking a Tiger tank or SS infantry not moving widely around to attack the eponymous USD tank, it's all about image, I came away thinking the battles were planned by a video game enthusiast

Finally, let's talk about the characterizations. As mentioned, I felt the writer/director was unable to decide the tone for this film. The five man crew of Fury - both the name of the tank and an attempt to send a message that war is violent - show this to an extreme. We are presented with a group where three are battle-hardened cynics. OK; no problem here. They have a friend who has just died and it leads them to resent - maybe mistrust is a better word - his replacement.

OK again. The replacement's character is that of a nave idealist who cannot believe or accept how his new comrades react to events. His world vision causes others in the unit - though not in his tank - to be killed. His transition after this epiphany is rapid. I could say too rapid, but with no direct experience in combat, I cannot say with any certainty how a man's mind might process such events.

But, Brad Pitt's portrayal of the tank commander is erratic to say the least. His swings from a world-weary SS hating doctrinaire willing to shoot prisoners in full view of scores of US soldiers to a gentlemen seeking to aid the notional passage into manhood the new crewman and back to madman when the rest of his crew - men with whom he has served for over three years - suggested to me either Pitt's character was bipolar or the director was simply having Pitt shift to meet the needs of the current secne's messaging.

My 11 y old son watches Band of Brothers as he knows not to use the language in the series.  He does not have any nightmares after watching those.  That being said after watching Fury the first time I knew there was no way I would let him watch this true to life war movie.

I am a Vet. of the Gulf War (1/504th PIR,82nd Airborne) and a Retired Law Enforcement Officer of 15 years, so I try to keep my kids informed but not desensitized to the violence of the world through movies or games.  Simply meaning if i believe they can learn history, or morality watching an R rated or PG + movie I will let them, with me there so i can explain why you would or would not do something.

With all that being said, this movie is as close to being real as you can get without being a documentary or first hand account.

To the movie itself, Great movie, great acting, and finally authentic equipment, tactics, and terminology to a combat movie.  And that is what this is a combat movie no stupid love story thrown into it for no reason, no misuse of military assets to find a one person.

6526148,4,B00M0GM4V0,"This is a very good one, by any measure.

It was of special interest to me: as a pre-teen baby-boomer in Vancouver, I was fascinated by the Sherman Tank displayed at an Armouries building on Beatty Street. The tank that thousands of Canadians fought in, on, (and behind!) during that incredible year in Europe after D-Day, and, not so incidentally, as the Canucks, Americans and British fought their way up the boot of Italy. That Beatty Street Sherman is still there, I've learned, one of less than half a dozen that still exist in Canada. (The fact that the movie utilizes 5 original WW II tanks--4 Shermans and a German Tiger adds to the realism.) How furious was the action? By the end of the war, only ONE Canadian Sherman that had clanked ashore during D-Day was still moving about a year later, by war's end. Amazing. I'd never seen the inside of a tank, so that was a major motivation for watching the movie. Great--and unexpected--movie experience, far beyond the hardware.

Interesting story structure--we can only guess at the horrors this crew had ALREADY seen, in years of combat, prior to when the tale begins. The story is, in fact, the sad, tragic finale to their military service. Clever, too, in that we see war's horrors, not only from the tough perspective of hardened veterans, but from the perspective of the new crewman--a clerk-typist who, by his own admission, had never seen the inside of a tank, either.  That's not all he hasn't seen, as we soon learn. It's not just the horrors we are reminded of here, but--unlike most other war movies, especially most made before the 1960s--the EFFECTS of the horror on those who fought, and, also, here, the effect on civilians, the ""collateral damage"" of combat.

To say more would spoil the viewing experience of others, but be assured, this is one of the best.  Happily, others think so, too.  The movie has made almost 4 times its budget as of this writing.",1434758400,,1927,4.70326409495549

6526388,1,B00M0GM4V0,"I cannot understand how, on earth, anyone thinks this was a good movie.  It is bad on so many levels I don't know where to start. I have been in the AF 15 years, and have treated shell shocked veterans in military hospitals since 2004, to give you a frame of reference.  The movie is both bad from a plot/script/dialogue standpoint, as well as a pure military realism point of view.  FIrst, it was almost unwatchable due to the excessively foul language.  Obviously, people in the military swear.and during war they swear a lot.  But these guys were F-bombing every other word.  It really got in the way of character development.  Speaking of which, it has been a long time since I watched a movie in which I really didn't like ANY of the charactersI mean none.  Not only where they all the most despicable people (from the evangelical Shia Labouf who thought God was telling him to kill everyone, to Brad Pitt who forced the new tank crew member murder a POW and to rape an innocent German girl), but further, they all seemed to really hate each other.  I thought these guys were going to end up shooting EACH OTHER right there in the tank.  Ask anyone who has been in real war and they will tell you the only thing that keeps them going is the love they have for each other.these guys had none of that.  They kicked each other, spat on each other, insulted and physically assaulted each otheryou get the point.  And they were supposed to be this battled hardened group that had been together three years????  Watch Band of Brothersit is a much better depiction of what happened.  How do you know?  It is almost completely narrated by actual WWII vets, who did not seem to be sadistic, emotionless murders as is depicted in this movie.

From a plot point of view there was no point to the story.  I couldn't figure out what was going on from a larger perspective.  There was actually no plot whatsoever.  Where were they going?  What was the point?  The story just kept thrusting them in the middle of fights, one after the other.  Yes, this happens during war, but from a movie standpoint, what is the point of watching it?  It wasn't even interesting.  What you do end up realizing is that almost everyone of the tank crew (except the new kid) really LOVES to kill people.  War is hell, no doubt.  But there is not one shred of humanity or compassion in this entire movie.  Brad Pitt's character forces the new tank crew member to murder a prisoner of waras a large group of American GIs look on, laughing.  Did things like this go on?  Sure they did.  But many of the guys who did this, even in WWII, were eventually brought up on criminal charges.  But regardless, from a movie standpoint, it really made you hate Pitt's character.

Then, the finish it up, Brad Pitt made the absolutely ridiculous decision to stay hunkered down in his broken down tank to battle hundreds of SS soldiers by himself.  All the while trying to tell his crew to ""go hide the trees, I got this!!!""  The rest of the crew stayed, of course, and they all were killed, in the most pointless way ever.  They weren't protecting a town, or holding a important strategic position.  They were in the middle of nowhere next to a single abandoned farmhouse.  A completely pointless way to end the moviebut after watching the whole thing, I didn't mind seeing them bite the dust in the end.

Horrible things happen in war, and I am sure that all the bad stuff that was depicted in this movie absolutely happen at one point or another during ANY conflict.  But from a movie point of view, what was the point of having a collection of ALL the possible despicable acts rolled into one film?  I hated all the main characters, got tired of the bad special effects, and at the end realized it was two hours of my life I will never get back.",1433635200,18,3805,4.450072358900145

6526390,1,B00M0GM4V0,"Very realistic technology but they insulted our soldiers of World War Two by portraying some of them as prisoner shooting, woman raping psychopaths. Our troops of that generation were fighting because they felt they had a job to do to fight FOR the good. Commanding officers did not shoot prisoners nor did they order subordinates to do so nor did they attempt to persuade subordinates, young men under their command, to rape civilian women, as is portrayed in the film. Any such events were the rare exception and were not accepted as normal. Obviously the producer and writers are of a more degraded and morally bankrupt generation. It's beyond their ability to conceive of young Americans fighting under the most brutal conditions and yet maintaining their honor and humanity. For a realistic look at being a Sherman tank gunner in World War Two, read ""Another River, Another Town: A Teenage Tank Gunner Comes of Age in Combat--1945"" by John Irwin.",1433548800,8,951,4.95

6526403,1,B00M0GM4V0,"Veterans will get a laugh at the special features where the actors in interviews recount their bonding during a ""rigorous"" military emersion consisting of one week's basic training of getting up at 5 am to do pushups, eat cold food and get yelled at as if they'd fought their way from Omaha Beach together, right through The Battle of the Bulge.

Nor do I believe vets of that era would recognize themselves as represented in this film... i.e. as boorish, lowbrow, callous, cretinous murderers of unarmed prisoners and rapists of female civilians.  Behavior Russian troops were at the time noted for, not their American Canadian or Brit counterparts, which is why civilians  and combatants alike ready to surrender, routinely in the last stages of the war, fled westward toward the American lines rather than risk their fate to the advancing communists.

As for the film itself, there was obviously some great care and detailed attention taken to portray as much realism in period uniforms, equipment, in recreating a believable battle scarred German town and countryside, to portray the clostrafobic grunge kinetic stress and fear of fighting within the confines of a battle tank.  There is an overmatched outclassed outgunned encounter of four Shermans (tanks that is) with a single yet  far superior German Tiger that is particularly well done and realistic.

But the final last stand at the crossroads? Is so contrived, so over the top implausible as to stretch the suspension of our disbelief beyond any human boundary, thus taking its pyrotechnic pent up Hollywood fury on credibility and in the end vanquishing it.  Too bad.",1433548800,39,1631,5.082397003745318

6526439,3,B00M0GM4V0,"What a disappointment for any military historian to see, once more, a military story given to a ""successful"" director of another genre willing to work for an 'A' list actor, Brad Pitt, and put up with a post-Nam-era take on World War II in such a lax manner, someone who believes ""Kelly's Heroes"" or ""The Dirty Dozen"" were real. This was like a Sgt. Rock cartoon magazine meets the National Guard for maneuvers. Compared to ""Sahara,"" a real yarn with measures of patriotism and realism, this fell short leaning so heavily on Brad Pitt, embodying toughness, embarrassing laxity of discipline with his tank crew and horrific morality in one instance by conspiring and forcing the execution of an unarmed prisoner in the opening minutes of this story. We never know what division he belongs with, who's his commanding general, etc. Michael Pena, playing a Hispanic member, goes so far to play along that he dresses beyond military protocols ((in gold chain, draped outside his shirt) that he becomes a frat party buffoon off-duty. What is missing in the crew is chain of command respect. When you spot a Nam boonie in the opening scenes and Brad sports a German submachine-gun stepping down from his tank without explanation, it's a tip-off to lax authenticity. The camaraderie is false among the crew away from the tank and the hazing and bullying that envelops the new guy was absurd. This is where the leadership breaks down from the start. Brad Pitt is brutally undisciplined about his crew. Tank commanders almost never survived a single battle. For a guy who supposedly has been in a tank since North Africa, he sure could not nurture respect at all. In other scenes he just glares at unwarranted hazing, which gets ignored and continues long enough for you to realize that he has a bunch of loose cannons. Somehow, they fight as one at the end. Does this do justice to tank members? I think not. The battle array was unusually loose in the first big showdown. With 4 tanks lined up side by side like aircraft against an embedded tank? Never, it would be ducks in a row otherwise. Inside the tank, the film was at its finest. But most the time I wanted to bust his crew in rank again and again away from the tank. It was a ""diverse"" crew,(if you want points or less criticism for that), but totally false about the military caste (rank) protocols. Most soldiers had the .45 Colt sidearm that would discourage bullying. Mr. Ayers didn't have enough time to see the TV ""Combat"" series, written by veterans, where the dialogue is sparse and true and the squad discipline is tightly top-down.

. . . . .

When this film came out it got a lot of hype as a hard-edged, grim, hyper-realistic WWII epic, something along the lines of the ground-breaking ""Saving Private Ryan."" What we actually got, though, was something more like ""The Audie Murphey Story,"" with a Sherman tank manned by spunky, heroic crew who slaughter Krauts by the dozens while avoiding any bodily injury for quite some time. Oh yeah, sure, there's death and mayhem and (spoiler) a bunch of ""our guys"" die... And the battle-hardened crew turn out to be a lot less squeaky clean than the guys in war movies of old. They drink and cuss and semi-rape the frauleins of an all-but conquered Germany, but at its heart, this is an old-fashioned war movie, hyper-mythologizing Brad Pitt's laconic, war-weary tank commander, the semi-indestructible Wardaddy, a man who seems equal parts John Wayne, Sgt. Rock and Tony Soprano.

In the end, it was the super-pretentious, hagiographic representation of Pitt's character than put me off this movie -- there are some harsh, realistic touches and a few modest insights into what it was like to be in a WWII-era tank crew, but the script lays it on pretty thick, and the direction -- especially with the gooey, semi-religious score dominating so many key scenes -- is just too blunt and hamfisted to give this film much real resonance. Obviously, many viewers disagree and loved this film.  Me...? I'll stick to flicks like ""They Were Expendable,"" ""The Big Red One"" and ""Platoon"" when I want to get my fix of war-is-hell Hollywood epics.

6526556,4,B00M0GM4V0,"I asked myself: Why is Brad Pitt making this film now?  Its hardly like nobody had made a World War II film, after all.  Was it a statement in disguise about our latest wars?  Having watched the film, it did not seem so; it seemed a straightforward, fictional account of generally what it was like to be an American tank crew toward the end of the war in Europe, on the final push toward Berlin.  Germanys air power was largely destroyed, their armies had been considerably reducedbut so had the allied armies.  The German tanks were generally superior to the American ones [it was only on the Russian front that German equipment ran a poor second because the Russians had already learned how to make equipment function in Russian winters where temperatures could run 40 below zero.  The German mechanized vehicles simply froze up and would not movethe oil froze in the engines, while the Russian gear could keep on moving].  Getting a little older now, Pitt plays a seasoned platoon commander who is the oldest of the group.  And of course, he plays a hero.  I don't think this film was nearly as bloody as Saving Private Ryan, though there was blood and death and, of course, plenty of shooting.  And the film depicts some of wars strange ironies and incongruities.  Overall I found it interesting and well-made, with of course solid acting.  Pitt never takes a part he doesn't consider interesting and worth giving his all.  I give it a solid B.",1432512000,,1448,4.653543307086614

6526635,4,B00M0GM4V0,"Let there be WAR! said Brad Pitt after his wife Angelina Jolie was tapped to direct the World War II film Unbroken. Pitt stars in his own WWII film, Fury. Turns out Pitt wins this battle!

In Fury, Pitt plays sergeant Don Wardaddy Collier who commands the five-man tank crew of a commandeered German tank dubbed Fury. Wardaddys crew includes four other militarily nicknamed men: driver Trini Gordo Garcia (Michael Pea), artillery expert Grady Coon-ass Travis (Jon Bernthal), canon operator Boyd Bible Swan (Shia LaBeouf), and newbie Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman), later christened Machine. The film makes much of these alternative identities as it delves deep into the effects of war. Lermans Norman is the greenhorn of the group, having been in the army only 8 weeks when he is assigned to Pitts crew. Normans previous experience as a typist has not prepared him one bit to assume the gunman post in Colliers squad, and it certainly has not prepared him to clean up the remains of the previous man who occupied it. Now, as the US pushes its way into Germany and Hitlers forces grow more desperate Wardaddy and company are sent on mission after dangerous mission to secure German cities.  This is the crux of the films plot and while it can be viewed as modest or simplistic, it works.

Fury is directed by David Ayer whose most recent film End of Watch was a sensational piece of guttural tragedy; Fury captures that same tone vividly. While thousands of war films exist, a majority of which are World War II films, Fury rejuvenates the genre with powerful scenes of tank warfare that drip with intensity and ring with authenticity. A scene of note involves the crew facing off against a German Tiger tank where every move must be calculated to the most frustratingly critical degree or its lights out. What Ayer accomplishes with both his direction and his screenplay is that he strikes an engaging balance between the rigors of war and the humanity of its soldiers.

The sets are truly remarkable and combined with some of the camera work they can be devastatingly heartbreaking in the style of Saving Private Ryan or even Gone with the Wind. Still at times the film can feel a bit uncoordinated and even clich especially in some of the dialogue, but Fury thrives more on action and mood than it does conversation. This is also a far more bloody and violent film than I expected. Some of the horrific gruesomeness may have been avoidable, but when looking at the films overall ambition, much of it is warranted. At the end, Fury is a surprisingly refreshing look at warfare and camaraderie that is well-acted and feels unique. Angelina Jolie has her work cut out for her. B+

Fury is rated R and has a running time of 2 hours and 15 minutes.",1431820800,3,2744,4.708333333333333

6526924,5,B00M0GM4V0,"One thing made me give this movie a five star rating. A real German Tiger Tank fighting real M4s. This is the first time that has ever happened in a film. Not clever reproductions as in Saving Private Ryan's lousy Tigers compared to Kelly's Heros excellent, powerful looking fake Tigers.

I was impressed with the story until we got to the part at the end where one disabled, stationary tank fights hundreds of the SS. I wonder, why the SS didn't attack from the rear of the tank until the end of the fight? Why did one man's stomach stop a panzerfaust that had already penetrated steel? It should have gone on, round and round inside the tank, doing a lot more damage.

But there was stuff in that movie besides the real tanks to make one think. I've seen photos of flattened men in roadways during that war, this film takes that up... but the sound of a high velocity 75 fired from a pak 40, glancing off a turret, being bent or thrown into a twirl instead of going its aerodynamic way made a sound to remember. That was a first in a movie. And there was one more thing that ""war crime"" fanatics who think war is like a game of tag and everyone gets over being shot at and seeing people die, etc. The bit about shooting a German wearing an American rain coat is akin to the SS shooting Americans for carrying German equipment. Yep, cops should never do that when making a stop, but this was war with one rule: No Posion Gas. Only eclipsed by the brutality of war in the Pacific.

Still, I give it 5 stars for the bits that have never been done before, giving the end bit a pass because it seems to be what Hollywood does to a good story, including Private Ryan. The only series I've seen where things go as things went more or less was Band of Brothers, though it did a terrible job with Captain Sobel, who was really a pretty good soldier despite the errors in Band of Brothers, the book and movie.",1430697600,3,1901,4.275

Even if it was a completely different war film it would still be another amazing war movie.  Full Metal Jacket use to be my all time favorite film until Fury came out.  My favorite part of the film by far has to be the end where the Fury crew hold off the cross roads.  I will not give anything away about that part but it is an amazing part to look forward to.

The  best line in the movie is when an infantry captain says to Pitt why don't they just stop fighting, and Pitt's reply of 'Would You'?

I also was very impressed with the psychological side of having to mentally keep oneself strong and capable of dealing with ""... what one man can do to another."" (quote from the movie)... and do what you never dreamed you would or could do - war is ugly and wretched, but when one is cast into it, it comes down to 'kill or be killed"" and there is no way to make that honorable or right... so you tell yourself what you have to in order to try to survive it - ""IT'S THE BEST JOB I EVER HAD...""",1430611200,,875,3.9213483146067416

There is a lot of blood and four letter words, but those were likely also a part of the scene.  The movie is not suitable for children.

Unlike in a typical action movie, this one shows soldiers with different personalities.  Some of them talk with a very thick accent and use words specific to the military, so the movie is well worth watching with the subtitles turned on.",1430524800,,758,4.704545454545454

6527064,2,B00M0GM4V0,"This film has basically every war film cliche, just with a bit more blood and gore.
-Incompetent enemy who stupidly march into good-guy fire
-Grisly, mean abusive vet who really means well and is good at heart
-Some overly religious guy
-The green soldier who wisens and toughens up and becomes ruthless himself
-Surrounded in enemy territory (even though the enemy is down to about 100,000 effective soldiers and the Allies have about 4 million)

There was only one thing authentic about this film: people die a lot. Oh, and perhaps that the SS was rather brutal.

Otherwise, it's more of a comic book war film than a realistic one. For those who say ""it's just a movie!"", I would suggest that one recall that realistic war films are not impossible. Black Hawk Down, Das Boot, Bridge Too Far, Lone Survivor (all realistic until the last scene), any number of WW2 fighter and bomber films.  It actually isn't that hard to have a good, realistic film - especially about WW2 given that there is so much to work with.

Why not have had the story take place in El Alemein?  It's quite believable that an American unit could be surrounded there.  Or, if you want to be really creative and realistic, make it a German tank unit surrounded fighting the Soviets.  That happened probably on a daily basis.

In conclusion, my problem is not that this is a bad film - but that it was rather advertised and critiqued as a hyperrealistic war/WW2/tank film.  It is not.",1430352000,2,1455,4.63035019455253

6527131,5,B00M0GM4V0,"There is a lot to like about 'Fury,' a World War II saga about a tank and its crew doing battle against the German army in the last few weeks of that bloody conflict.
The acting is top notch, for example; the script flows evenly and the action sequences are electrifying. The direction is seamless and the photography is brilliant.
The movie attempts to recreate the weariness of soldiers who have been at war for years: The tank crew has, with one exception, been together since the earliest days of America's entry into the war. They have suffered together through the heat of the North African campaign, fought their way through Normandy and Belgium following the D-Day invasion and are now part of the final push into Germany. In this aspect the movie succeeds brilliantly as it captures the complex relationships of men from widely different backgrounds who, thrown together at random, must learn to function as a team under the most brutal conditions. Those who have not been to war often claim that it dehumanizes soldiers but that is far too simplistic a view of  what happens to troops when they are fighting for their very lives. As 'Fury' shows quite convincingly, soldiers who have shared combat experiences can love one another even when they don't necessarily like each other; can be willing to die not for some vaguely defined political objective but for their brothers in arms. They can also kill without mercy, as the movie also shows, and brutalize one another in some situations.
The story revolves around a new addition to the crew; an untried 'newbie' who has only been in the Army for eight weeks. He joins the men who take  'Fury' into battle following the death of one member of the crew who had been with them since North Africa. As can be imagined, he is not readily accepted. The fact that he was trained, not as a tanker but as a clerk who never expected to see actual combat, adds to the veteran crew's distrust of him. In the course of a few short days he must learn how to fit in, how to operate as part of a closely knit team and how to kill enemy soldiers without wondering about the moral or ethical consequences of his actions. His efforts to adjust to them and they to him lead to conflicts with his new crew mates that are played out against the backdrop of brutal fighting.
All in all, an excellent movie.",1430352000,4,2343,4.576190476190476
6527132,1,B00M0GM4V0,"Brad Pitt's big claim on this movie was that it had veteran WWII tankers on as advisors; yet when the movie was done, the vets disowned it. Want to know why? Watch it. It's not just the violence; sure, war is violent, and tank warfare is very violent. But not this kind of cartoon hillbilly violence. Anybody who has studied the history of the American armored campaign in Europe in depth (and I have) or even cursorily knows that, despite the occasional need for hand-to-hand combat, had any tank unit in any of the forward divisions behaved the way that Pitt's crew does, they would have been cashiered INSTANTLY. IT'S IDIOTIC, and all TO MAKE A POLITICAL POINT; though God knows what the point is. That war is bad? Thanks, Brad; didn't know that. I really would have loved it if Pitt had made this movie when the likes of Creighton Abrams, much less John S. Wood, much less Patton (and I'm no Patton fan) were alive: he'd be in hiding in some remote Caribbean island, now, fearing for his life.

SPOILERS
If a few youths with one panzerfaust can destroy a tank with one hit, then why can't hundreds of SS soldiers do the same? And normal Wehrmacht soldiers were destroying T34s with handheld tank grenades on the eastern front, but few hundred crack SS goose-steppers were incapable of doing the same?

6527193,5,B00M0GM4V0,"On the modern battlefield, the United States maintains a decisive technological advantage over all adversaries.  For this reason, foes of the U.S. tend to resort to tactics of asymmetrical warfare rather than go toe-to-toe against our military.  Some people are apt to believe this has always been the case, but his is not so.  Rather, the importance of this advantage has been burned into our soul from previous conflicts where we were on the opposite side of the equation.

A glaring example of this would be World War II where our Sherman Tanks were little more than cannon fodder for the better armored Panzer ""Tiger"" Tanks of Hitler's army.  This is a fact that has for the most part been skipped over in historical fiction film.....until now.  The present story takes place in the latter stages of WWII, when the war is almost over.  Almost, that is, but not quite.  In the end, the allies have sheer numbers on their side, and that is what brings victory against an adversary that is technologically superior.

Brad Pitt turns in perhaps the finest performance of his career as an American Tank commander who has a total disdain for the Nazis.  Fair warning:  this is a disturbing film.  There is a persistent myth that in ""just"" wars that the good guys never commit atrocities & the bad guys always commit atrocities.  This is a story that gives us an unvarnished depiction of the fallacy of this belief.  Pitt's character is ambiguous:  he is certainly a patriot, and yet the Geneva Convention does not seem to be something he is familiar with.

To paraphrase General Douglas MaCarthur, the hardest thing you can ever ask a soldier to do is to go into combat.  The veracity of this statement should be obvious considering that the U.S. has been engaged in combat sorties (as well as full-fledged battles) in the Middle East since shortly after 9/11  2001.  That said, should the profundity of MaCarthur's statement escape anyone, this is a sobering film which will expatiate on how this phrase was as true in previous conflicts as it is today & will be 1,000 yrs from now.  The technology used in war changes, but war itself remains horrifyingly the same.",1430092800,,2164,4.750670241286863

It has the cinematic ""edge of your seat""  combat grit of Saving Private Ryan and some excellent performances by Brad Pitt, Shia Labeouf (Transformers), Jon Bernthal (Shane --from Walking Dead) and others.  The Tank battles are excellent because they used REAL WW2  Tanks (Shermans and Tiger) from the Bovington museum in England.  Filmed overseas, so the scenery is wonderfully realistic.

6527311,3,B00M0GM4V0,"This is a brutal and extremely intense WW II action film that to me, at least, is the first time I've seen what seems to be what it really must have been like inside an American tank in the heat of battle. The description of ammo, of coordinates and movements and such must have been  meticulously researched and drummed into the actors' heads until they come across like they're really GI's operating a tank. I have to say their acting is spot on. The battle sequences are superb. However...
The dialogue is laced with so much profanity , and the behavior of certain characters make them so extremely repellant , that it ruined a lot of the film for me. My mom, who loves war movies by the way, had to leave the room about 40 minutes into the film. It's a shame, because this is the kind of film that ought be shared with a younger audience  so that they can appreciate what their grandfathers and great-grandfathers went through in World War II,  but with the way it is written I couldn't recommend it to anyone under 18 at least.
 We know war is hell, as this movie surely makes apparent, but they're too many other good war movies out there that didn't depend on such abhorrent language and character behavior to get the point across. None of the characters elicited any sympathy from me, just because their language and actions, when not in battle, was so unlikeable at best and so repulsive at worst.
 For the tank and battle sequences, the acting, and the apparent authenticity that went into that part of the film, I would give it  ***** 5 stars.  For the dialogue, peppered with such profanity and for some of the disturbing character behavior, I would give that aspect of the film * 1 star.",1429660800,,1700,4.482200647249191

It isn't as good as that film, but it is definitely a powerful piece of art that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The scene in which the outgunned Sherman tanks battle a German Tiger tank is an amazing action sequence. Shia Lebouf is actually really good in this, but some of the other acting is a bit overwrought. The final battle scene is engaging and powerful, but please engage your ability to selectively ignore elements of the implausible battle.

I never understood why he drank or what he was trying to forget.
This movie showed the horror of war and how it affected those warriors who became victims of their own nightmares. This Movie shows how each person coped with the trauma. After watching this movie and series such as the Pacific, I finally understood what my father and countless other  GI's suffered to protect their Loved ones and COUNTRY.  This movie showed the courage, commitment and compassion Needed in order for them to survive or choose to give their liVes for their country.

Also, it may be believable in the writers' offices in Hollywood, but it is not believable to accept that the SS commanders would have allowed their troops to be massacred in such numbers by five tankers.  That said, I would watch it again.",1429056000,,573,4.876288659793815

Not this one, though. This film definitely lives up to its title! It is centered on one of the most serious, consistent performances of Brad Pitt's career; like Jrgen Prochnow in 'Das Boot' he underplays rather than overplays the key role of a ruthless and war-weary commander, to very good effect. Historically, the film seems to be almost faultless, with highly accurate depictions of the technology, tactics, uniforms and equipment of late WWII in Europe. You should know going in that this film is not an upbeat, patriotic celebration of American victory, nor is it a sentimental anti-war sermon.

Tanks shoot off cheap looking backyard fireworks when they blow up? Every member of the ""tank crew"" was a total cliche. What the heck was going on with that having lunch with the German ladies scene? Why was it so long, and what was the point? Very forced and felt like it was trying way too hard for some kind of ""statement"" that you're just left wondering what it was. And I have no military experience, or knowledge of guns etc but I have to say, that in the last scene, after what is seemingly hours, surprise, the Germans have these huge rocket launcher looking things, that look like they can blow the living snot out of that tank. Be careful, these are the only ones we have, (and nobody noticed until now duuuh!) Nobody in the tank can see jack, or see the Germans sneaking up on them, yet apparently none of these get fired? These guys sneak up and then just run out into the open and charge the tank w machine guns? The Germans look like a bunch of bumbling idiots. Let's all just run head on at the tank 5 at a time and get mowed down! The final scene was the last flaw.. er straw. A perfectly organized pile of dead Germans surrounding the tank, each exactly 1 foot behind the other guy. Argh. Hated it. Worst war movie I've ever seen.",1428969600,15,1388,4.241509433962264

6527698,2,B00M0GM4V0,"I find it interesting that so many reviews comment on the authenticity of he movie.  If that were the case, I am confused by the fact the German army was able to win so many battles and fight so well when numbers of troops and equipment were against them.  Evidently seasoned SS soldiers march to the front in drill formation and singing loudly.  No worries about allied close air support or artillery fire.  When the battle begins, the SS soldiers seamed bewildered at how to destroy a single American Sherman.  Never mind the fact they had been destroying Russian T-34s by the thousands with infantry anti tank weapons. A frontal assault with rifles and machine guns must have been a new tactical doctrine they were experimenting with.  Didn't seem to work very well. They did use a Panzerfaust at least once, but the one that scored a hit must have been a dud since usually the shaped charge would penetrate more than an inch or so.  Usually it kills the entire turret crew and sets the Sherman on fire.  Oh, and the German 75mm anti tank gun crews need to get back to gunnery, they couldn't hit anything.  On top of all that, the US soldiers, who were known for their kindness to German civilians and treatment of POWs (yes I know, US Soldiers did kill POWs) were portrayed as men on the edge and ready to commit rape and war crimes at every turn. I think one review said it best, Inglorious Bastards in a tank.",1428883200,2,1415,4.474708171206226

I too quote scripture and have seen so much abuse and religious abuse from zealots in so many countries I no there is no god- I see a baby girl frozen to death from an infanticide crime scene a mile down from my house I have to live with the pictures of her crying mouth wide open with icicles formed in it and the fact she was a month or two months old and had to cry and freeze to death in the dark while rats ate her I hope she already lost consciousness by the time this happened and Homer's (The Illiad) black wall of death closed on her being forever.,1428537600,,856,4.131736526946108
6527835,4,B00M0GM4V0,"Once again Brad Pitt does an excellent job. He portrays a tank commander in this one. I have heard other reviewers call this movie merciless, realistic and violent. I think those comments are correct. Also nice job by the supporting cast. I even spotted one of the actors in there from the series The Walking Dead!

As others have said this movie isn't about right and wrong. It is about soldiers put in the position of having to do their job, however difficult, frustrating or hopeless it may seem.

I loved the various battle scenes with the tanks. Also loved the dialogue between this group of soldiers who eventually become friends.

Spolier Alert - do not read below if you haven't seen this movie yet !!!

My least favorite part of the movie was the German girl dying after just spending time with the clerk typist (the new recruit).  I thought the timing of this was a little too convenient. I know the point of this was to show that in war one minute you are here, and the next you  are not. But I did not think they way they did it worked. It seemed to follow a Hollywood formula which I dislike.

I have heard others call this a better movie than Saving Private Ryan but disagree with that. However it is still a welcome
addition for fans of World War II history. Also I heard that the tanks used in this movie (such as the Tiger) were real. How cool is that?",1428537600,,1369,4.345098039215686

The tank commander, played superbly by Brad Pitt, is a character with German Roots, who is a 'battle hardened' American Soldier who knows his enemy, and knows that the Nazis must be stopped, wherever they are met. The commander is excellent at 'reading a battlefield', and because of ever faithful care toward his men, gets them all to be courageous and determined to stay in the fight until it is over.
This story is told in the most believable manner. One learned from the movie, that the most likely way for Sherman Tanks to disable a King Tiger tank of the Nazis, was to use 5 of the Shermans, attacking from the front and sides, with the fifth Sherman disabling the Tiger tank from  from the rear. The Sherman tank crews made a remote possibility of defeating a King Tiger Tank into a probability, against all odds. Their fearlessness bordered recklessness, but for the most part, they practiced self-control, having learned discipline from on-the-job-training. They were determined.

The Fury tank commander tries hard to cling to whatever civility he has in his make-up, in the midst of an urban battle in the heart of enemy territory, by sitting down at a table with two young German women and a few of his men, and minding his manners and those of his men; he insists that the women be treated with dignity and respect, at the same time realizing that they have entered deep into hell, and that they were against all odds in terms of their surviving it.

6527994,4,B00M0GM4V0,"First. Wow, Shia LaBeouf is actually an actor! Finally, they get this archetypal character almost right- a little exaggerated, but this is like the rest of the movie.

What this movie is, Top Gun + Platoon in tanks transported back to ww2. If you are a tank aficionado,  it is rare you get anything close to realistic and dramatic tank action. You can be upset it isn't more realistic,  or you can be happy to get something. So many reviewers are put off by the inaccurate depiction of the capabilities of the panzerfaust. But when is the last time you saw a panzerfaust in a feature film? Some films depict them being slung over a shoulder. I don't recall having ever seen one used. Ever.

It is not a docudrama,  so they exaggerate some things (nearly everything- in fact they are pretty consistent in the tone of exaggeration) like the lack of abilities of the late war Germans, and the depravity of war weary soldiers desperately trying to make it home. The battle scenes are video game-ish, seemingly using the Star Wars blaster flashes to depict tracer rounds, and this is the thing I had the biggest problem with. It was just a little too much.

The content thing I had the most problem with was that they did not really capture the feel of stalking and being stalked by a Tiger. That vignette was actually done fairly well in Kelly's Heroes.

It is not as good nor as realistic (nor as honorific) as Saving Private Ryan but what is? And it isn't trying to be. It is a different sub-genre.",1428278400,,1496,4.498154981549815

(It's important to caution, though, that those w/ PTSD should approach this w/ due wariness.  Note that!)  Many of the attitudes portrayed will be impossible for those who have not been in combat to comprehend, but we wounded soldiers - of any conflict - can understand how these men felt.  This film may be as close as ""never-served's"" can get to what it feels like in combat.  For those of us who have been there, though, - in any war - we vividly relive the smells, the shock waves, and the multitude of long-accumulated discomforts (headaches, hunger, bruises, rashes, cuts, sprains, infections - and the unique dumbing effect of months of sleep-deprivation), and the constant, long-term exposure to weather that we had no choice but to experience to the full, the often disturbing sights that we've seen, and the emotional numbing that some of us would fight (others not).  The surreal life of a combat soldier at the ""point of contact"" is incredibly, definitively uncomfortable, stressful, and at times bewildering.  Those who come to accept this existence as ""their new normal"" will never readjust to peacetime.  Call it ""PTSD"", but it is really the normal and healthy acceptance of conditions that had to be endured.  The truth, for good or ill, is that none of us are the same afterward - and our families (particularly) and acquaintances can't help but notice this.  We all lapse into the ""thousand-yard stare"" frequently, even years after our wars - and thus we recognize one another.

I applaud the actors and film-makers.  This is a solid combat film: a good, honest attempt to depict combat in war.

They show the Germans opening a crate of Panzerfaust anti-tank weapons during the assault. The SS were battle hardened veterans. That tank would have been toast in short time. Also, Brad is seen on the top of the tank shooting the .50 caliber completely in the open. In reality, he wouldn't have lasted 2 minutes.

It also made the German soldier look like some worthless animal, when in fact many of the men were young boys an old man forced to fight. I was Brad Pitt so hateful, sure you have to kill the enemy, but not like a wild animal. I think there's an effort nowadays to make the military look bad, it's a Hollywood politics stuff. There was also an incident where the new guy was told to go to the kitchen, in the military there is no such word is kitchen, it's called the mess hall. I'm Brad Pitt and his crew got done it look like they massacred the whole German army. When in fact many World War II soldiers never fired their rifles. After the Battle of the Bulge the Germans were surrendering in groves. This may sound strange but I'm not sure it was a good idea to have so totally defeated the Germans.

6528343,1,B00M0GM4V0,"It's really hard for me to say this, because I really wanted to like this movie. The premise rests in one of the best places a movie premise can rest: a World War II tank movie. This movie seems like it would be awesome. It almost seems like nothing can go wrong, and the ratings for a movie like this would start at three stars and go up from there. However, the premise was handled as badly as possible. If this movie got a load of four and five star reviews, I have to think that it was out of respect for Brad Pitt and the cool idea for the movie. People saw this, and out of respect, placed it in the same league as ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Band of Brothers."" However, this movie just definitely isn't in the same league. I hate to say that, and I'm totally bummed out that it wasn't handled properly. Note to Hollywood: we badly need a kick-ass World War II tank movie to put on the shelf next to ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Band of Brothers.""

There are moments in this movie that just seem like farce and like they are pretty much out of a B movie. There are moments that are absurdly melodramatic, and a whole bunch of moments that were improved and really shouldn't have made the final cut. A lot of scenes in this movie left you wondering why they were in there, and were far too drawn out on a premise that didn't seem to fit the movie, like the whole ""meal"" scene where the tankers are eating around the table of a house in a captured German town. I have no idea why that scene was so long, or why it was in there. It built nothing and added nothing to the story. Whatever the director was trying to accomplish wasn't accomplished. There were probably two or three other scenes in there that were the same.

It is a shame, because Michael Pena is one of my favorite actors, and what he could have added to this movie was totally squandered. The best acting performance was by Jon Bernthal, but it came nowhere near to saving this movie. What this movie could have been is quite amazing, what it ended up being was down in the dumps. There were also a few scenes in there that seemed pretty inaccurate as well, especially at the end where the Germans were attacking the tank. I won't get too far into it, but it showed the Germans armed with anti-tank panzerfausts, but in three hours, they couldn't figure out how to fire one at the tank, even from close range. The technical problems with the movie could go on forever, but at the end of the day, for all things combined, this movie deserved one, maybe one and a half stars. The deal with Brad Pitt is that the women go insane over him, and he seems like a really nice, chill dude in real life, but seriously? He can't summon the intensity required to make this a good performance. He's usually got this tone like he's just chewing bubble gum and walking through a performance. There wasn't enough gritty realism to his performance, and it brought the move down a notch. I would love to see a movie with the same premise reshot, with a new script, new director, and grittier, more realistic cast. That could be epic. This movie, however, was kind of an embarrassing swing and a miss.",1427760000,43,3148,4.315878378378378

While historically this movie is probably lacking, it is still a great story with a realistic inside look to what American tank crews faced in WWII.  The last battle of the movie was fantastic. If you like watching Nazis getting mowed down by gung-ho American troops this movie is for you. A bit unrealistic though.  I highly doubt the German troops would have walked into the death trap that was set for them in the inept fashion they did in the movie but it was great entertainment.  It was a bit like seeing the Dude in every movie Jeff Bridges did after The Big Lebowski.  I kept waiting for Brad Pitt to say, ""We're gonna be doin one thing and one thing only. Killen Nazis.""

It's not terrible, but it takes a topic that has a lot of depth and potential for excitement and boils it down to something very shallow; missing opportunities to make the excitement have a lot more purpose (I'm scrambling to avoid any spoilers). The acting is solid (Pitt is well above par as usual), the effects look great, and there are a couple of nail biting moments.

Bottom line, if you like war movies largely for the action sequences this will probably do it for you. If you are more of a Das Boot kind of person, or you really got into the dialogue and character development in Saving Private Ryan I'd skip it.",1427500800,,663,4.390243902439025

Story is watered down by a tremendous amount of action but after all this is a movie about war. This is one of the best films I have seen in a long time. This also happens to be what I think is Brad Pitts best performance to date. Same goes for Shia Lebouf actually.

Pitt and crew wind up holding the crossroads with only their single, disabled tank.

Our fathers, brothers and husbands who went from every walk of life to serve during this war were good men, many of them of high moral character. We watched as much as we could of this movie and  became increasingly disgusted to see ugly acts of immorality and barbarity played out. Perhaps some of the men acted in this way, but by and large, this was not the norm.
I realize that many on the Hollywood left feel they may take poetic license because so much time has passed and many of the millions of WW2 vets have died. What a shame to put this tripe out there to paint an untrue picture of the greatest generation.",1427328000,43,778,4.402777777777778

6528889,4,B00M0GM4V0,"A warning -- this film has some very distressing scenes in it, in terms of gore and the Horror, of War. They pass very quickly, as they would in the second-by-second chaotic fury of war. But the impressions left by those moments remain. But one must consider that a film intended for wide distribution probably cannot show anything close to what it was actually like for those very young, (but at the same time old), incredibly brave men, who sacrificed themselves in the fight against the evil oppression and dogged determination of the enemy's forces.

Thank You, to the people with the vision and determination necessary to bring this forward to us, so that we can try to have a fuller appreciation of the sacrifices of the 'Greatest Generation' - This is a film worth watching for that reason.

Of course, the usual 'Hollywood' effects are there, but possibly so that we can notice some of the fine distinctions (as the people caught up in the battle would also) such as the different sounds that characterize some of the different weapons used.

It looked to me that the producers were actually able to find and utilize real surviving and running examples of some of the vehicles used instead of mocking up stand-ins.

The end of the story seemed unrealistic to me. I won't spoil it for those who have not seen it. Without survivors and witnesses of these unimaginable events, we couldn't know what these brave young men faced up to.",1427241600,,1438,4.717131474103586

6529057,4,B00M0GM4V0,"I prefer realism over Hollywood story telling.  This film is a great ""Popcorn"" type of War Movie, that in a way reminds me of the old 40's war movies.  The plot centers around a tank crew led by Brad Pitt's character ""WarDaddy""  (right away, when I see a War film with the characters all having nicknames, I know I am in for less than realism and more Hollywoodism).

There's a lot to like about this film.  It is entertaining, the sound effects are awesome (LOVE LOVE LOVE the .50 cal firing), there's suspense, tension, and afront to innocence brought into a combat scenario.

The tactics, movement, command and control structure, and even discipline are all Hollywood screen writers (by that I mean, they are not realistic, but written for the screen to be entertaining).  The combat is intense, although a bit too contrived.  I think actual combat would've seen the engagements they depict not turn out as depicted.

Still, I feel this film is worthy of 4 stars (the only reason I didn't go 5 is because of the realism factor)... I don't feel at all like I wasted my money.

I haven't addressed a story synopsis or plot lines because, to be quite honest, I don't want to spoil your viewing (if you've not seen it), and if you have, you know those speak for themselves.

I highly recommend this film if you're looking for a really really good war film that will keep you on the edge of your seat.  Just don't expect the same level of immersion as other films, such as Platoon, or Saving Pvt. Ryan...  I don't think that was the filmakers' aim in making this.",1427068800,,1561,4.512455516014235

They do their best to present the worst side of war and the worst of the men fighting it. If you cut the first hour and just go to the action, the movie might be worth watching, but not really. By the time it actually got to the action, I was already fed up with the men who were going to be the heroes and wished they were all dead. I didn't like the thought that any of them would survive to come back to society.

Frankly, I would advise everyone to watch The Lost Battalion with Rick Schroder instead. Not only does it depict the horrors of war and the digression of men into that level, it actually displays those who rise above that level and are worthy of our honor and respect.",1427068800,,775,4.132450331125828

Why is it that composers that bad get work in Hollywood? The music just sounded really cheap. I just don't understand it. I hear better music in COD. As for the editing, there where some scenes that didn't make sense that they really should have cut. If I watch this movie again, I am editing my own copy. Overall a great WWII movie and the actors are great. Just sad that the music and editing didn't equal the effort of everyone else.

My last gripe is Shia - ore maybe who ever casted him. You cast Shia as a southerner? Wow. Let's go original and have two southerners in the same tank. Not only that but the other southerner acter blew Shia away completely. Shia did a horrible job with the accent. It was almost as if he hated the character's accent as much as I did.

This very graphic story depicts WWII with gut-wrenching brutality that you won't forget. The acting, photography, sets, sound and music are top notch. Watch the extra feature after the end of the movie called ""Blood Brothers"" which explains how the brilliant director David Ayer along with the actors met with actual American soldier WWII survivors in their 90's who told them of their harrowing experiences in the war, which was used in the movie. It also explains how the 5 actors in the tank formed a bond and how they synced together in giving some of the most dramatic acting of their careers.

6529347,3,B00M0GM4V0,"This review will have spoilers but I will tell you before hand.  Great actors, poor/unrealistic script.  I love all of the actors in the movie, but the script makes them all unlikable.  A large percentage of the movie is spent talking, it is not interesting and you don't feel like you know or care about the characters (in Saving Private Ryan you learned to love the characters and the pauses helped you discover more about them, not so with this movie).  In the middle of fire fights the American fighters inexplicably stop to mourn their fallen comrades and just as inexplicably, the Germans seem to halt to let the dramatic grieving take place!  Makes no sense.  The first major battle scene is good and makes sense and has some very cool and gory parts, but the other battles do not.  Mild spoilers: Three Shermans versus one Tiger.  The Shermans back straight up, then move straight forward-no flanking, no spreading out?  The Tiger, which has a much greater and more accurate and more powerful firing range, decides to rush at the three Shermans (potentially letting them out flank him instead of just firing from a distance and knocking them out).  Spoilers: The last battle pits one sitting duck tank versus a battalion of Germany's last good SS troops.  When the troops are walking they have tons of Panzerfuste (hand held German anti-tank weapons-see picture).  But, when they get up to the tank, suddenly no one has one and they have to pull them out of crates???  When they do pull them out they only fire a couple of times.  The German SS soldiers are made to be totally inept, they repeatedly run right in front of the tank like they are committing suicide, flanking anyone?  Several of the last Americans to die stand up out of the tank for no apparent reason (example Michael Pea; plus, they didn't think to bring all the ammunition in the tank before the SS arrived?  Why would you leave the ammunition on the outside of the tank?).  Final nail also spoiler: an SS soldier sees the last remaining American under the tank (they have just killed hundreds of his SS friends) and he just walks away without shooting him?  He was SS, not going to happen.  Brad Pitt has been in some awesome movies, Troy, World War Z etc, but his acting cannot save this wreck.  Wish I would have rented instead of buying.

6529583,4,B00M0GM4V0,"Not as bad as some claim though the ending was really rather silly. Having the Germans running around like lemmings getting massacred was really over the top. Up to that point the movie was extremely realistic, especially the combat. I've watched a number of interviews with WWII tankers who thought it was extremely accurate, especially the scene with the Tiger (the fact they used a real Tiger in the scene was terrific). While yes, the tracers were badly overdone and it did seem at times like Star Wars, the tank tactics were real. One thing I have noticed on some of the reviews is how offended some people were by the portrayal of the American soldiers. They don't understand that these were incredibly brave young men placed in incredibly horrible stressful situations. As Oskar Schindler said in Schindler's list, ""war never brings out the good in man, only the bad"".  People like to keep their heads in the sand and live in denial believing that those things could never happen. But unfortunately they did, BUT that being said does not mean they weren't heroes, it does not diminish how brave they were. I have never been in a situation like that so I have no idea what it was really like to live through that kind of hell. I've had many friends and family members who served in the military and some fought in various wars (WWII, Viet Nam and Iraq) and I could not be prouder of every single one of them.

The costuming was good, the scenery was perfect, and all the tanks were real, even the Tiger. However, the rest of the film was not as enjoyable. First off, the tactics used by the Germans were just dumb and it made the finale less enjoyable. Also, none of the characters are likable, they're as bad as they're good. This plays into the main theme of the movie, which is there is no black and white in war, just grey. This film portrays the Americans to be as cruel and ruthless as the Germans. There are no good guys, and there are no real positive moments to balance the film. It's just one long dark ride to the end. Again the acting was superb, but I wasn't emotionally attached to the characters and thus didn't care what happened to them. There's also a religious tone in the film with some obvious imagery used at the end. I give this film credit for going in a different direction, however the execution wasn't totally there.

The Fury Sherman tank crew have seen way too much, way too soon yet what doesn't kill them only makes them more likely to bear down against all odds. Tightly directed with half the action taking place in the tank and the other half outside but the intensity hardly lets up. Saving Private Ryan was about the guts it took from our Allied soldiers and the nobility of their mission, big or small. Fury is more about how war is horrid but it drives leaders and this experience will bond very different men under very difficult circumstances. Fury isn't so noble as it is about how far men will push their luck. Very well done. Actors are remarkable, sets are incredible and the action is hard to watch. Very graphic.

6529872,3,B00M0GM4V0,"Such a disappointing film, it had such promise. What went wrong? Two parts could have been changed that would have turned it into a fine film.
First, the sergeant portrayed by Pitt is supposed to be a good tank commander and platoon sergeant. How do we know? The writer/director should have omitted the war crime scene and used the time to show vignettes of how the t.c. took care of his crew: extra rations or goodies (like fresh eggs or other food), keeping them off rear area working parties, getting showers, mail and other conveniences, making sure they did their maintenance, taking their watches so they could go to town or view a movie.
Second, Pitt refers to the tank as his home and the movie is titled Fury after the tank. How do we know about the crew and their feelings toward the tank or each other? Tankers eat, sleep, move, and fight together but instead of showing us these facets of daily life, the director takes us to a civilian house for some outrageous anti-social behavior. The crew doesnt exhibit anything that resembles comradeship.
The director was trying to show the dehumanizing aspects of battle and he easily could have attained that purpose and changed those two scenes of war crime and bad table manners. There were good points: Excellent pictures of tanks and tank action, uniforms and equipment were well done a little unrealistic, and good special effects, the 88 rounds screaming by were terrifying.  The tactics were not good and the final battle was over the top but that wouldnt have mattered with a different story, the story of World War Two tankers.",1426204800,,1591,4.743682310469314

6529931,5,B00M0GM4V0,"One of the best examples of the horrors of war on the personal side of fighting war. The darkness, gritty, dirty. The unnatural. It shows you during the time of war there is no good or bad there is just fight and survive. It shows you the most important is the will to survive and that in war both sides have their darkness. It's an important experience and a dark approach to the emotional side of history. There is no good or God in war, only winners and the losers.

Nazi's where evil but evil can be both sides. There is a fine line between what is good and bad. One's good can also be ones bad. One's bad can also be ones good. War is war. War is unflattering, unflinching darkness on humanity. Bad things. Horrible things. Disturbing and emotional things happen during war. Fury is a film that lets you experience the darkness of war.

What I love most about this film is that it's a personal example of war. It's the characters in the thick of it. It's not about the war itself, it's about the ordeal of a group of individuals. Yes, war is a main focus but it's the attitudes, emotions and horrors that a group of young men go through.

Brilliant acting by the whole cast. Pitt is amazing. He owns and creates a mysterious and dark persona and yet a man with a story and hidden pain and anger. I feel this was a moving experience through all the performances. Shia LaBeouf did an amazing job. Michael Pena as always creates and owns his character. Pena is one of the greatest underrated actors around. Jon Bernthal aces his part and gives the tough and often sadistic approach of a lost soul in situation that has slowly controlled him. The award and accolades must go to Logan Lerman for his emotional and very believable role that he portrayed in a flawless way. He created the character of Norman in a fantastic and heart touching way.  I understood his character. I felt his characters fear. I became a part of the ordeal through his reality of an everyday person being placed into a situation that one would never dream of.

6529933,5,B00M0GM4V0,"Why is this the best war movie ever... because it has everything. It has historical truth, great writing and acting, fantastic directing and photography, music, sound. All of the technology is modern. Movies like this could not be made in the day. The movie should help you understand what it was like to respond to the worst monsters of all time, the German Nazis. And by the way, Nazis are right wingers. Fascists think that if you are not a proper raced human who salutes the leader and obeys, you should be ""disappeared"". I liked the fact that Brad Pitt's character spoke German. He knew what the SS was. These are the Nazis with the skull as the emblem on their headgear. War is not neat and clean. Whenever there are hundreds of dead soldiers it looks like a slaughterhouse. The tanks crush over the bodies which mix like ground meat and mud. The horror requires pauses to catch your breath. Why suffer it? Because it should help you appreciate the people who saved the world in the 1940s. That's our American servicemen, the Brits, the Canadians, the Australians, the French and many smaller nations. This movie is not about the Soviet war effort, but the Nazis could not have been stopped without the Red Army. The movie is about the inferior equipment that Americans used against the ""Master-race."" Yes those Germans are incredible designers and engineers. I think the movie should be required viewing for high school graduation. It should quell any desire to volunteer for the military. War is a disgusting instrument of the one percent. This war is the war that was necessary to support. The heroes depicted in this movie were focused on one important truth, the world was doomed if the heroes failed. Every person who participated in WWII  is a hero, even the millions who were just civilians in the path of the monsters. I think this film could help prevent the acceptance of war. Here is one other important thing. The movie should make every one of us develop a more accurate way of thinking of our problems, illnesses, tragedies, and our personal disasters. Very few Americans have ever had it this bad. I viewed the movie in 4K via Sony's 4K player and TV. I love blue-ray... but if I can get full 4K, I have to do it. I will probably buy this movie as a gift for young people I want to be educated. Note there is humor and gentle love in the film. It offers hope.",1426204800,,2381,4.576112412177986

6529954,3,B00M0GM4V0,"*Possible mild spoilers below*

""Fury"" was a decent film. Not great. Decent.

The story and acting were good. The audio & visual effects were outstanding. Many of the components were there. But it was all weighed down by what can only be described as ""Hollywood moments"".

One example of this was the characters: as I said, the acting was quite good. Brad Pitt was excellent. But the characters portrayed were caricatures. The tank crew was made up of a ragtag bunch of war movie archetypes. At one point early in Act one, I thought: ""Well, we have everyone here but 'scared new recruit'. Oh wait... here he comes."" By Act two, any predictions of who lives and who dies by the end of the movie are very likely correct.

Another example: Death wish Nazis. The German soldiers must enjoy getting shot, as observed by their refusal to take proper cover when being fired upon, especially during the final battle. Simply sending squad after squad of men at the enemy in hopes that they run out of bullets is not a very sound battle plan. This isn't Gallipoli.

Speaking of combat, what is up with German grenades? Anytime a Nazi grenade landed next to one of the good guys, they practically had enough time to get their affairs in order and notify their next of kin before it exploded. But the American grenades always went off on the first bounce. If my understanding of German military gear is wrong and the Nazi potato mashers were famous for having 10 second-long fuses, then I stand corrected.

Some people aren't bothered by this sort of stuff, but I find it pretty distracting and occasionally jarring, especially when I'm otherwise engrossed in a film.

That aside, the action is intense. And even though 'Hard New Yorker' and 'Pious Good Ol' boy' had their differences with battle-scarred Sgt.'Tough-but-Fair', the character interaction during the downtime between bouts of shelling and tracer fire was fine. And of course, the real star of the move: the venerable Tiger tank.

All in all, ""Fury"" is a good WW2 movie that might have been better if its treads hadn't became mired in formulaic muck.",1426118400,2,2101,4.752747252747253

This one doesn't fall into that category for me. I had to stop watching it, couldn't get past the brutal execution scenes that Pitt performed in. It was revolting to watch. He doesn't show an ounce of compassion or remorse or human empathy for his actions or his victims. Isn't that what's wrong with our society today?

It started off slow for me but we are conditioned these days to be placed into the action immediately with sustained CG effects, blood and gore and other wiz bang cinematography, so once over that I simply watched.
I thought that each actor carried their own weight. None of them stood out to be the ""Lead"" here moving you through the story nicely, Mr. Pitt included. He seemed like ""just one of the guys"".

The film's pace is pretty similar to Saving Private Ryan as well, with a few battles alternating with slower, tension-building developments of plot.  The charge against the anti-tank guns, and especially the ""Tiger fight,"" are excellent action filmmaking and some of the best cinematic depictions of armored combat ever.  The ""last stand"" battle at the end of the film feels a bit less realistic, a bit more ""epic Hollywood,"" but doesn't spoil the film's overall effect.  Interesting note, the film's color balance has the cold, gray feel of the opening Germania scene from Gladiator.  There is a moment in Fury when Wardaddy is talking to an officer about the last remnants of German resistance, and everything from the color to the nationality of the enemy is straight out of Gladiator.  The officer says, ""Why don't they just quit?""  Wardaddy days, ""Would you?""  And it's hard not to finish the line for him:  ""Would you, Quintus?  Would I?""",1425859200,,1143,4.90625

The story is well done, it is about a tank crew during WWII and their march through the European theatre of war after having been in Africa. The crew has been together a long time and they appear to be one lucky crew. But then the expected happens, one of the crew members is killed in combat. Thus they need a replacement second driver. In comes a young private who has been in the army for all of eight weeks. The crew is stuck with him.

The story follows the crew and follows this young private into the bizarre and terrifying world of war. Lessons are learned, people die, civilians die and you see the devastation and despondency that comes from a war. This group of men are amazing and do a terrific job of hobbling the enemy in their attempt to take ground, but the price is high.

Brad Pit spooned the new guy as they shot the POW in the rear while the entire American forces watched in a massive, sweaty circle. Other highlights:  The 'dinner' scene, when the lecherous, steamy hillbilly dumps his entire load of 'schnapps' on the new guys head while everyone watches with eyes 'wide shut'.  The virgin sacrifice amid the wet, red communist bricks really shot it home. I absolutely loved how Brad Pitt tore off his shirt, then forced the new guy to read the virgin's sweaty palm before forcing her to 'surrender' to his Yankee 'might'. Boo-Yah!  The tank battle scenes were so realistic I nearly sharted. Seeing supersonic wads of molten steel slamming into the rear of that fat tiger really made me feel like I was there. I never knew a Sherman could deliver the 'goods' in such a timely manner. Those holes were huge! Some naysayers say the movie showed the Germans as being incompetent, but what would you do when you're getting 'worked over' with 20 tons of wet, dirty, furry American steel? C'mon stupid, it's pretty simple whatcha do. You take it! This is the best thing I've ever seen since Heath Ledger and that other guy went camping with horses.",1425772800,,1266,4.668161434977579

6530714,1,B00M0GM4V0,"This movie makes the point that war is ugly, brutal, bloody, cruel, dirty, and generally causing people to act in repulsive ways. If this is in any way a close simulation of real combat, it's a wonder anyone came home sane. The characters in the film all appear to be already having made that break with sanity in favor of madness as a defense against what's going on around them.

I watched Saving Private Ryan which I considered a terribly brutal film in terms of deaths onscreen, and I've seen war movies dating from 1948 onward, but this one has them all beat.  Call me a wuss...coward...lily-livered...any word meaning someone who can't take a surfeit of violence, especially in certain instances where it seemed to be uncalled for even during war, but I couldn't take this film.

I don't have any knowledge of tanks or combat in general as far as battle tactics so I viewed it just on a visceral, tentatively entertainment level. Believe me, there was no entertainment involved since that implies a certain amount of enjoyment.  All I felt was revulsion,  I watched 15 minutes and then called it quits.

The film asks questions about the morality of men's barbaric and extreme actions during war: rape, murder of soldiers and civilians, civilians killed accidently or as collateral damage, and then the other end of the scale of extreme behavior: bravery and courage. What is it  that makes men who would never think of committing any one of these acts as civilians at home, commit all of them as common place at the front? The film often shows the horrors of war as a lesson to the new guy on the crew. The lessons are harsh, violent, often sudden and deadly, graphic and unflinchingly presented. No apologies offered. This is war. This is a hard and very necessary lesson for the Millennials, and a poke in the eye reminder for the rest of us.

This one does.  The battle with the tiger tank is good action, but the German tank commander would have had to be a fool not to have kept his distance and battered the weaker American tanks into scrap.  However, the biggest weakness is all the talk about feelings.  This is world war II for god's sake.  These were men who grew up during the great depression, not modern young adults who whine to high heaven when their wifi is slow.  They didn't whine about their feelings all day long.

6530872,4,B00M0GM4V0,"Finally, got a chance to view Fury (2014), which must have been the most talked about war film last year in the States.  I decided to see Fury, after finding out that David Ayer was the director. Before, all I heard about this film was the excitement people were spreading relating to the actors that were starting in this film, and that was about it.  I am always very skeptical when it comes to Hollywood produced war movies, especially World War II films.  The reason for it is that a lot of these productions are one sided, and over-exaggerated, always making the American or British soldiers look like some indestructible supermen.  If I wanted to watch science fiction films I would go watch Terminator, Robocop or Predator.  But I am very aware of the fact who runs/controls Hollywood, and why war movies, specifically WW II films tend to show enemy soldiers (Germans and Japanese) at minimum, and once they do appear on the screen they are usually shown as incapable to do anything, and/or they get mowed down with machine guns by tens or even hundreds by the always heroic Allies.  Fury is no exception to that.  The last scene is a typical Hollywood propaganda, which is far from reality.  The movie is good, really good, and I did enjoy watching it up on till 135th minute.  Here are some reasons why I gave Fury 4
solid stars:

1. The opening scene with the German office riding the white horse amongst a graveyard of destroyed tanks and vehicles was a great way to open this film, I really liked it.  The same thing goes for the ending credits, the authentic historical footage form WW II painted over with color red, and the industrial type of metal music reminded me of the German band Rammstein.

2. In my opinion this film has three great scenes worth mentioning: the first one is a dramatic scene involving the character played by Brat Pitt trying to teach the new gunny how to kill, and he choses one of the captured German solders to make the lesson count (if you ask me that is war atrocity but at that time both sides were doing the same thing to each other).  The second scene is an action scene involving four Sherman tanks engaging Tiger tank...I don't think I have to tell how that fight ends...the last scene that made a lasting impression on me was the scene when Norman (the gunny) meets a young German girl named Emma, their encounter and the entire scene up to the aerial bombardment of the town is very moving-or- touching if you like...

3. The movie would have been a lot better if it at least two or three short dialogue scenes of German side were incorporated into the film...making the film longer, but also two sided and more interesting...",1425600000,,2678,4.552083333333333

Don't let all the big name actors in this film fool you. Plot was boring and quite generic over all. There were a couple good battle scenes but some of it just didn't make sense. Example: Near the final scene when Norman observes the company of Germans marching down the road, it shows many of them carrying panzershrecks on their backs. However when the battle ensues and the Germans are attacking the tank, none of them have panzershrecks until late in the battle when they bring out wooden crates of them. What happened to the ones that like 20 of them were carrying on their backs? In the same battle, the tank was disabled and only facing on direction, with no one controlling the turret so the inside machine gun was only facing forward. Even though the Germans were all around the tank, they only charged towards the front so they would all get mowed down by the machine gun.

Final thought: This film had some decent special effects but was just poorly thought out over all. Save your money.",1425600000,17,1022,4.579234972677596

6530941,4,B00M0GM4V0,"Brad Pitt is getting good in roles as the old ""blood and guts"" sarge in war venues.  The director took a page from S Peckingpah and didn't leave much to the imagination.  The movie is gritty, good attention to detail, good special effects, and a good reminder that war should be avoided until it can't while holding our political leaders accountable for what they have wrought.  Overall, I thought the movie had an authentic feel about it.  The movie is basically all action with the story line centered on the tank crew and desensitizing the ""new guy"" replacement.  Character development of the tank crew was excellent.  Some of the actors didn't need character development in the story such as the captain over Brad and his crew.  The orders given and the captains appearence; you knew who he was and what was his foundation.  Unless the director did thorough research on the panzerfaust, I thought most of the crew surviving the panzerfaust hit to be a notable flaw to the story.

This film is badly acted and has even worse direction (if you can call it that). It's very tedious and plodding. Plus I thought the John Wayne style days were gone when one fighting vehicle (tank, plane, whatever) could win the war. The last third of this boring movie has a disabled American tank holding off an entire German platoon. And did the director even bother watching the scenes? No. When the Germans were marching every other one had a panzerfaust (the German bazooka) BUT when they came upon the tank, not one was seen. Then the Germans only attacked from the front - with machine guns! Every time Pitt or another of the Amercans fired a shot, every shot killed a German. Great marksmanship, huh?

6531060,4,B00M0GM4V0,"War movies are one of the ways we memorialize the courage and sacrifice of our fighting men, and Fury does an excellent job of doing that for the American tank crews who battled German tanks that had thicker armor and more powerful guns than our Sherman M4s.( During the European campaign the 3d Armored Division had 648 Sherman M4s destroyed in combat and another 700 knocked out, repaired, and put back in action.) The Army had a rule of thumb that it would take four Shermans to match a single German Panther tank.  In ""Fury"" you get to see four Shermans battle the even more formidable Tiger Tank whose armor enabled it to withstand most shells and whose powerful 3.5 inch gun could penetrate the armor of a foe from a mile away. To its credit Fury does not glamorize or glorify war, showing instead how it coarsens and brutalizes even the good guys. The acting is very good, the combat scenes are exceptional, and although the plot is not particularly original, it is good enough. However I have withheld a star because of a scene that is intended to be ""romantic"" but which is preceded by enough coercion to make it qualify as rape in my mind.

The action became much more intense - the tank battles were well staged and exciting. My main disappointment is how sad this film made me feel. Seeing the horrors of war and how gleeful these men were to kill other human beings, is not a form of entertainment I care to partake in. My biggest take away from this film was how fruitless war is and how many lives are cut short just to do someone else's bidding.

When he arrives he discovers that he is in a very different world - one of callous disregard for life - one kills in order to stay alive.  The combat scenes are extremely accurate and not for the ""faint hearted""  The new replacement is treated to an insane world and is progressively pushed to wards the demand that he kill a German Soldier to prove that he is capable of killing and thereby protecting his crew.  He is introduced to the insanity of war when they enter a captured German town where the Germans are killing their own citizens.  The American forces quell the gunfire and take over the town.  They exhibit behaviour that is no better that the Nazis.  The now battle blooded soldier and his sergeant enter a house and take advantage of the sanctuary that is offered.  In the end the Sergeant protects the young man when the tank is overwhelmed by German armour.  The new man is the only survivor because of the sergeant because he is the least corrupted one of the crew.

6531243,5,B00M0GM4V0,A very well acted and brutal depiction of World War II which is often romanticized in movies. Brad Pitt is brilliant as the hard-as-nails leader of a tank squad stranded and facing certain death while defending a vital roadway for the Allied Forces. Logan Lerman plays a young recruit forced into the heat of action too soon and Brad Pitt's character must deal with keeping him alive and getting some use out of him at the same time. A surly bunch of tank mates gives young Norman (Lerman) a hard time at first but he finally comes to realize that they all have a job to do and must work together to survive. There is nothing pretty in this film and it is very graphic.

Brad Pitt does not play that nice understanding guy that people have come to expect (despite him being an actor, some will hate his character). Fairly accurate in the american tanks wore completely outmatched by their German counter parts (not the kind of thing they brag about in school). If you like combat movies, this is one to see.

I feel this movie looked at two under examined WWII experiences: Tankers (as in tank crew members and their experiences) and the final weeks of the war in Europe and how chaotic is must have been. The movie is gritty and shows some fairly graphic violence so I would say it's not appropriate for children (and some adults who are not fans of realist war violence in films). This film also used the last operation German tiger tank in its filming (no army surplus US tanks dressed up to look like German tanks, they used the real deal). So if you're a war film purist, this movie should keep you happy. Solid acting by Brad Pritt and crew.",1425254400,,687,4.375

If the idea of 5 men & a broken down Sherman Tank taking on approximately a Regiment of SS Panzer troops, and inflicting catastrophic casualties to that Regiment without hardly a scratch until the very end appeals to you, then by all means watch this movie. If on the other hand, your viewing pleasure requires the least little trace of believability, then you wil absolutely find NONE of it here. This small group of GI's stand out in the open with automatic weapons firing from the hip, and literally mow down dozens and dozens of their enemy, who just happen to be even better armed and doing all that they can to kill said GI's. If it wasn't so awful, it would be laughable! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!",1425168000,10,726,4.425373134328358
6531617,4,B00M0GM4V0,"War is hell. Sometimes in a rush to judgment we forget that aspect. Movies have taken us from semi-glossed over picturizations of war to completely glossed over versions. Where we once had clean cut movie stars fighting in backlot dirt mounds depicting war we now have the unfazed world of cyber battles fought between drones and missiles. But no matter who declares they won't send in ground troops there will always be a time when that become necessary. And thats when war becomes hell, when you see the enemy up close, when you confront the families whose ground you are taking, when death becomes not just bytes but people. FURY shows you that war is hell while at the same time showing you that those involved are still human beings.

Its 1945 and the allies are making their final push into Germany in the hopes of ending the war. Among the war weary troops fighting is Don Wardaddy Collier (Brad Pitt) and his tank group: Boyd Bible Swan (Shia LaBeouf), Trini Gordo Garcia (Michael Pena) and Grady Coon-A** Travis (Jon Bernthall). Having just lost one of their drivers they return to base and are assigned a new member, Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman). Norman isn't happy about joining the group having only been a typist prior to this point. Collier lets him know up front that the Army doesnt make mistakes and to get in and start learning whats expected of him.

Sent on a mission Ellison gets his first glimpse of whats in store. When he doesnt fire on a German soldier that same soldier ends up taking out the next tank in line. His hesitation costs the lives of a good man. Collier makes him well aware of that fact and presses the issue with him by forcing him to shoot a captured soldier at point blank range. Ellison may want to quit, may want to go home, but thats not going to happen until the war ends. As Collier tells him in the movie Ideals are peaceful. History is violent. The theme runs throughout the film.

As the group moves on Ellison is horrified at the callous behavior of the crew. He sees them joking about the deaths of the enemy. He is hazed by them and pushed beyond his limits. Their crude mode of surviving seems terrible to view but in the end it all becomes apparent why they act this way. The things they have seen, that things they have survived, have made them stronger and able to cope with all the carnage that they witness around themselves. This is their way of making it through the war. Before long Ellison will come to understand and be a part of it as well.

The last half of the film deals with the aftermath of what theyve experienced to this point and a final mission they are sent out on. Germans have been pinned down one group and are on the move. Collier and his men are to take over a crossroads and prevent them from getting through. Sent out with three tanks Fury (the name theyve given their tank) is the only one to make it there. After hitting a land mine the tanks tracks are broken and the Germans are near. Rather than run Collier points out that theyve never left a fight left. Now all that stands between the oncoming German army and U.S. soldiers is Collier and his men.

While this may sound like your typical Hollywood depiction of heroism it is far from it. The behavior and attitudes of the men involved is so crass that you find yourself at one point in the film wondering who is worse, this group or the enemy they are fighting. As the film develops you understand what drove them to this, how its a way of coping with the horrors of war they have witnessed and begin to wonder just what you might do under similar circumstances. As seen through the eyes of an innocent in Ellison you realize what man is capable of under these circumstances.

With the exception of the language for some and the behavior discussed there is nothing that is bad about this movie. The acting is great and Pitt in the lead shows why hes become a solid leading man whose abilities are based on more than good looks. Collier is the most troubled character on screen and yet shows more composure than the rest. The entire ensemble seen in this group turns in excellent performances, each given their chance for screen time and meaningful exposure of their characters.

Above all the movie depicts the horrors of war using graphic CGI combined with actual grit found in the muddy roads and country sides where the battles take place. Among the green grass and leafy trees are machines capable of unleashing death. This is a movie that doesnt glamorize combat and yet at the same time shows the need to get the job done when it becomes necessary. Its a dark and gritty world on the battlefield and no one walks away unscarred. The movie shows what I said at the start: War is hell.",1425168000,2,4730,4.467592592592593

6531834,1,B00M0GM4V0,"This film is a disgrace.  It dishonors my grandfather's generation and portrays them as a bunch of thuggish war criminals cruising around executing prisoners and raping women like it was the norm.  The attitude and demeanor portrayed by the actors couldn't be further away from the truth based on the multitude of vets that I personally grew up around and have also watched in documentaries.

Also, while some of the special effects during the combat scenes are good, the combat sequences and tactics are horrible. The German troops act like zombies that walk blindly head-on into a disabled Sherman for hours while continually being slaughtered without so much as firing a single panzerfaust that they are shown carrying, or simply flanking or bypassing the tank altogether.

I recommend Band of Brothers or A Bridge Too Far if you want to watch a decent WW2 movie.",1425168000,50,866,4.951724137931034

6531838,3,B00M0GM4V0,"Like a lot of historical movies, one not has to dwell on reality too much lest one ruin the experience. This movie is more than a bit clich and the parallels to Saving Private Ryan are more than obvious. The typist in Fury is stand-in for the translator in SPR. The sarge making his last stand in the tank turret is just a replay of Tom Hanks making his last stand on the bridge in SPR.
The likelihood of encountering a Tiger I in Europe was pretty remote as Hitler had most of them shipped off to the Eastern Front...but there were a few...by April 45, probably very few...assuming they could find gas.  Another part of the movie that was unrealistic was the German high velocity 88mm gun's effect on a Sherman. An 88mm would have gone through the Sherman's frontal armor like a hot knife through butter. The Firefly gun upgrade helped but the US didn't have a good tank until the Pershing. Another thing, what happened to all the SS guys with Panzerfausts when it came to attacking a lone stationary Sherman and why didn't they simply attack the rear of the tank?
Another thing that seemed odd was the typists instant transformation from total pacifist to crazed killer. It didn't work for me. When the typist was hiding under the tank and was spotted by an SS guy, the German inexplicably finds him and then leaves not alerting his fellow troops. Very odd.
I guess it was an OK movie even if very predictable. The meal scene with the two German women also seemed like it was more of a time filler than adding much to the story.",1425168000,,1530,4.444839857651245

6531909,5,B00M0GM4V0,"This movie was amazing. For those of your who love a great WW2 movie that doesn't cut corners and presents it as close as can be depicted in a scripted cinematic platform, this is IT. Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers were the last movies/series to really get me to ""move"" in my seat.
The action is intense and doesn't pull any punches. It is graphic, gritty and ""real"". An amazing movie that has you bonding with every character and feeling what they felt. There was no shortage of action and when it hits, it is fast and furious. My favorite movie of all time is Upon a Midnight Clear, but this move just made my top 4. Brad Pitt did an amazing job with this character and all of the other characters were solid and believable. I hesitate to say, but there really were no weaknesses to this movie.
Aside from minor realism issues of battles where you know that there is no way a bullet or 2 wouldn't make their way into a persiscope or the like, the movie stands very well on its own. You should watch it and enjoy every minute of it.",1425168000,,1043,4.2727272727272725
6531910,4,B00M0GM4V0,"It's difficult to express some of the more brutal complexities of combat. This movie does it well. What's it like to clean a tank after a mission involving horrific fatalities?  What's it like to know you can die if you stand your post? What's it like to make a choice between escape and evading (living to fight another day) while knowing your escape will be paid for with the life of a brother-in-arms, or deciding to stand and fight a hopeless battle?  The actors in this film were able to convey answers to such questions. The film also did a good job of portraying the falabilities of those we consider wartime heroes. Even the most heroic man has regrettable flaws.
On the less-than-rosy side of my review, I find it regrettable that some movie producers and script writers feel that depiction of a combat atmosphere necessitates the use of profanity in the form of F-Bombs and the S-word. Truly, such language derates the film and distracts from a loftier image of heroic warriors.",1425081600,,988,4.705202312138728

The worker told me they weren't stocking it for another couple of hours. Got home and ordered from amazon. It arrived the next day. Amazon wins my money again from retailers.
As for the movie itself, beware if you don't like graphic violence then this is not for you. If you feel like every American drafty was a stand up hero, this movie is not for you. This is a much more gritty depiction of an American tank named Fury. It follows several cliches for any war movie.

The other weak point is the movie's portrayal of this World War II tank: the Allies had insurmountable number of these against the vastly superior but limited-in-number German tanks, and the Allies had beaten their German counterparts by taking control of the skies (air support) and their very well-coordinated tactics (radio communications to relay the airstrikes and artillery targets, as well as luring the Germans to pursue them and expose their weaknesses).

6532251,4,B00M0GM4V0,Of all the war films I've seen in my life involving tanks  this has to be the best of the best. Very realistic CG and live action. But the story just threw on the brakes and stopped in the scenes where the crew was dining with the two sisters in their apartment after liberating their town. Unnecessary lull in an ACTION film costs them a fifth star. Otherwise great film and exciting ending.,1425081600,,392,4.36986301369863

I think this took away from the movie a little because it was so tightly focused on these 5 soldiers.

6532284,3,B00M0GM4V0,"I had given that movie a better rating if the trailer hadn't been that misleading.

Had high hopes that this would be a realistic WWII movie after the trailer, introduction and first minutes gave the impression that the Movie has set that as a goal. Unfortunately it turned out to be just another Action Movie whose only historic background is that the war in which it plays actually happened, also not following real world physics.

It is flooded with errors in physics and history in detail and the big picture, sometimes contradicting itself within the movie. The plot is filled with clichs, to me it seemed like the script was ready and then somebody brought a list of things that have to be added to give the movie a (fake) impression of high moral and were squeezed in. In the end it's just another one of those movies in which brave Americans slaughter Germans in masses.

On the plus side, the scenery is well built and of high technical quality, if you like plain action like there is in 300 or Rambo 3 you maybe like that Movie as well. If you're looking for something with depth and realism I wouldn't suggest it, I didn't see the whole movie as I couldn't take it anymore at one point and left until close to the end, just to see that I didn't miss a thing.",1425081600,2,1269,4.414529914529915

The only reason I'm not giving this movie 5 Stars is the movie was essentially ""Saving Private Ryan in a Tank.""  I'm not referring to the basic theme of Ryan, but pretty much all of the pacing and high points such as:  Starts out with a battle scene.  New inexperienced guy joins the team.  New guy messes up.  New guy proves himself.  There's conflict among the team when the commander wants to do something heroic, but, once the other guys are in, they're all in.  Horrific battle.  Commander dies.  New guy survives to tell the tale.  The familiarity was just a bit too obvious not to notice and, in noticing, it was a constant reminder that I was, in fact, watching a movie.

6532539,3,B00M0GM4V0,"I screened ""Fury"" last night and it fell short of my expectations.  For a film hyped as ""The Best War Film Since ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Platoon,"" it does not reach those heights.  I found myself watching Brad Pitt and not ""WarDaddy Collier.""

I found myself thinking of other war films such as ""The Dirty Dozen,"" ""Battle of the Bulge,"" ""Apocalypse Now"" and even ""Kelly's Heroes"" as films that I may wish to screen again before I would re-screen ""Fury.""  Fury does portray the horror of war and the adage ""War is Hell.""  Atrocities and horrible death, but it lacks something that better war films such as the above mentioned have previously achieved.

Men at war are not generally likable and the characters in ""Fury"" are among the most unlikeable I have seen in this genre.  Perhaps Americans are used to seeing a touch of likeability in their veterans as they are portrayed on film by some of our most likeable and revered actors.  We have seen in past WWII movies that WWII was the last ""good war"" and we had good guys ""fighting it.""  ""Fury"" may portray a nastier, to put it mildly, sense of WWII than we are used to seeing from ""our boys.""  This may be part of the evolution of warfare to the barbarous lengths which we are now seeing it taken.",1425081600,,1251,4.495575221238938

Realistic as to what real people have to do during real wars.  What stands out is how Nazis and Americans find some humanity during a time when it seems all humanity has left.  From Wardaddy's treatment of the 2 German women to the young Nazi soldier who spared the life of the last remaining crew member.  Some good on both sides.

6532722,3,B00M0GM4V0,"5 stars for the sets, props and costumes; everything else gets a 1. Average 3. The final battle was absurdly unrealistic because the Germans would have responded to the lone crippled tank's initial ambush volley by using the vast open country side to make a wide pass around it and kill it from afar - their mission, after all, was to pass on by this crossroad to attack the American support column, not to waste themselves trying to take the crossroad from a lone crippled  tank. And, the hydrostatic shocks of several hits from a large caliber sniper rifle in reality would have left Wardaddy unable to carry on a conversation, or even get back inside the tank.",1424908800,2,663,4.61864406779661
6532723,3,B00M0GM4V0,"As a cinematic experience I found the movie somewhat entertaining, especially some of the non-combat scenes, but from a historical perspective the movie was a little disappointing.  Certainly the equipment and uniforms and gritty feel of the movie seemed spot on (bonus points for real Tiger tank), but to my disappointment some of the combat scenes were a stretch.  In particular, the last act of the film was silly, where the tank was immobilized due to wheel damage, and the crew holds off an entire company SS panzer grenadiers marching and singing in column in broad daylight.  A typical squad of grenadiers would usually have a couple of shaped charged stand-off anti-tank weapons such as the panzerfaust (effective up to 100 meters), as well as possibly panzershrecks (effective out to 150 meters), not mention magnetic AT mines, demo charges, grenade bundles, etc.  In short, it would be suicidal, especially at night, for the tank crew to make a stand.  Tanks are effectively blind buttoned up, and the infantry could easily approach the tank and knock it out.  Was the scene entertaining? Sure, but realistic, no way.

Another disappointment was the scene where ""Wardaddy"" trains a new replacement to kill by executing a POW in the back, point blank.  Sure we all know war crimes were committed by all sides, but I find it a complete stretch that this action would occur with so many witnesses.  The scene was completely unnecessary and really seems to me to be a cheap shot at the integrity of the U.S. soldiers serving in WWII. It adds nothing to the film and if it is some weak attempt by the director to equivocate the actions U.S. soldiers with the enemy, it is deplorable.

Finally the whole idea of a platoon of tanks swanning around the country side, unaccompanied by infantry, is contrary of how tanks were used in WWII, especially by 1945.  American armored divisions deployed their forces in combined arms combat commands, which were broken down into task forces, and sometimes further decomposed into teams.  Tanks are extremely vulnerable  to enemy anti-tank guns and infantry in ambush (having highly restricted vision in the tanks) and would be accompanied by armored infantry as a matter of doctrine.",1424908800,,2226,4.951612903225806

Brad Pitt gives a fine performance as a tank commander on his last mission. Even with his skills the story did not really engage me. The scenes where his men are waiting around for new orders seem bland and contrived. The overall lack of real drama comes from the time period the movie revolves around. It is very late in the war, April of 1945, and the Germans were already a defeated army. Their command structure was about gone, they were running out of supplies and Hitler would take his life in a matter of weeks. This is played out in scenes where the Germans seem to make unispired or just dumb command decisions. They seem not very formidable. As I often do for films that I believe come up short, I recommend alternatives. I won't mention the obvious films, you already know about them. ""Black Book"" (2006) is an absolutely riveting WW II film that is worth your attention.",1424736000,,1047,4.574468085106383

6533126,2,B00M0GM4V0,"I found the movie disappointing for a few reasons...
(A) Brad Pitt ""Hate's Nazis"" & his home, the trusty steed, M4 went behind enemy lines for reasons not very clear @ a time it was increasingly unlikely.  However, as German fronts were collapsing exactly where the front lines, where German military units were that still felt obligated to fight & those wishing to surrender to the Western Allies wasn't always known.
(B) During the 1st half of April '45, the Allies had pretty well crushed Army group B in the ""Ruhr pocket"".  The US had made a bridgehead on the Elbe in two locations & the northern was counter-attacked & repelled for a short time.
(C) Otherwise, w/~ 2-3 wks to go, Allied firepower in the west was pretty solid
(D) German soldiers were increasingly torn between protecting/gathering their families from Soviet brand ethnic cleansing & Nazi brand ethnic cleansing & desired to surrender to the Allies (though they wouldn't fare much better, those who surrendered late).
(E) Tanks... much has been made of the authenticity here.  True, Brad's home was an M4 but gosh darn if it didn't look a lot more like an M4 British ""Firefly"" version, whom upon taking receipt in '44 immediately recognized the need for more firepower though little could be done for thin skin & tendency to be picked off by 88mm & variable high power German main tank guns often from beyond the M4 crews visual /awareness & range.
(F) Character development was really awful, just awful.
(G) I give props b/c it did demonstrate how beancounters, aware the M4 was no match for German tanks even late variants of the Panzer IV, they knew they had enough, could produce enough, had enough crews to expend in able to win the war w/a subpar tank.  The M26 had firepower & in many respects armor but was hopelessly underpowered & far to few were deployed in the theater far to late to be of significance.",1424736000,8,1886,4.688821752265861

6533148,1,B00M0GM4V0,"UPDATE 2015/03/05

Thank you for your comments! I am glad to see that some americans/canadians emphasize historical correctness instead of stupid hollywood action. I am not proud at all of what the german army did. Parts of my familiy suffered a lot during this time too. But if the german soldiers were as ""inefficient"" as those kind of films show, the war would have been over in 1940. Fury ist dumb action with a cowboy and a crying LaBeouf. A shame for all people living during that hard time.

UPDATE 2015/09/03

@American Samurai-Soldier: My grandfather was no hero at all. He took part in ""Unternehmen Barbarossa"", the attack on russia. My grandma gets 91 years old this month and told me a lot about her activity near Penemnde during the bombing of England. Both, my grandpa and my grandma, were saying, that this was a good time for 2 Young People. But 60 or 70 years later they do not feel like ""Heros"". I was given photo Albums showing both, her during ""Arbeitsdienst"" and him in Kursk. Some Pictures show russians prisoners of war, also children.
And before this time my grandfather (born in 1924) joined the SA which attacked political opponents like communists. No reason to call oneself a hero.

----------------------------------------------

First of all, sorry for my bad english. I'm a german who's grandfather was fighting for the Wehrmacht in WWII. He told me a lot about the war. But that's not the point.

Only one star, because from the german point of view the movie is much toooooooo hollywood-like. The main actor is a brainless cowboy, the germans shoot like noobs, 4 guys defend a tank against hundreds of men ...

In WWII there where no cowboys like the character played by Pitt. Shooting men who surrendered ... telling boring stories after being hit 3 times by s sniper. This should be a good movie? I don't think so at all. It's a violent stupid comic.

A german granate is exploding inside the tank Mr. Pitttt is sitting in and he suffers simply nothing. Bad ridiculous BS.

The war was much more, like shown in Privat Ryan. THIS is a good movie. Also Stalingrad from 1990 or 1991 (https://www.amazon.com/Stalingrad-Horwitz/dp/B009XTF8NI/ref=ice_ac_b_dpb?ie=UTF8&qid=1479636572&sr=8-4&keywords=Stalingrad).

This is a well produced movie and I really appreciate the tank battle with a REAL Tiger tank.  Up until the last battle at the cross roads, it's great.  They totally blew the last battle.  The Germans, as SS at that, were reduced to bad 1950s/1960s stereotypes. Continued frontal attacks with machine guns rifles...REALLY? And when the SS is first spotted singing and marching down the road, at least 3 or 4 were already carrying panzerfausts. So, why do they show the SS breaking out more panzerfausts halfway through the battle?  Why didn't the SS just bypass the crossroads and tank?  Why did it take 3 shots from a sniper to 'sort of'' put Brad Pitt down (but still alive).  The tank would have been taken out in 10 minutes.

As a now retired tank soldier with over 20 years of experience on the metal monsters, I must, however, criticize the final battle as highly unrealistic.  When the hatches are closed, tank crew observation of the exterior and ability to fend off determined close-in infantry is extremely limited, which is why tanks normally operate with infantry in combined arms teams (they protect each other).  The German infantry was shown to possess many hand-held anti-tank weapons (Panzerfaust) and there would have been no way for the Fury crew to stop a determined infantry team from quickly taking out their tank, as was shown possible in an earlier episode in the movie.

6533612,5,B00M0GM4V0,"Great movie about WWII in the last days when the allied troops fought on German land. The five tank crew served under Sgt Wardaddy played by Brad Pitt in one of his best roles. They were stragglers, hungry and tired trying to pull off a mission that became impossible if not for one man and his tank-his home. Taking a newbie under his wing the war brings out the good and bad in the soldiers.
These men will touch your soul. I don't want to give much of the story away but it was intense. As our guys went further into Germany they witnessed the civilians trying to flee the fall of each town. The threat of being attacked by civilians was high. The enemy soldiers were secretly holed up, but it was a challenge to know where and to read the signs.
At one point the guys look up in the sky to see P-47's flying over them. Gratefully, they scream and yell, so relieved to know they are in this together and maybe they all could go home alive.
My dad was flying up there, Capt. T. Allman, in a P-47 with his squad of best friends too. I like to think he made it safer for this tank unit to make it as far as they did. I understand why my Dad spoke so little about the war.  But, he would talk forever about the planes of the 365th Hell Hawks.

A movie that delves into the ultimate container, the human being, finding all that exists from the darker side of the human experience to the surrendering of ones life for his country and even thing in between.

It seemed to spend a little too much time on the gore and brutality, in many ways like the Victors, another great war II movie. What I found missing was a story I could grab onto, one that brought me into the movie something that helped me to care about the characters. I am third generation military and spent a little time across one of the ponds in the late 60s and early 70s and left the military in 1986.

As a viewer, I just didn't really feel connected to the characters except for brad Pitt and the new guy.  Saving private Ryan on the other hand, was my all time favorite war movie not because of the action and the storyline, but because of the character development and the sense of connecting to them.  You almost felt as if you knew all of them and felt their emotions before, during and after each battle scene.

6534083,5,B00M0GM4V0,"Brad Pitt can act. So can Shia. Surprisingly, both actors provide excellent performances in this top notch war drama. Surprising I say because these guys are usually overshadowed by special effects or turn in mediocre performances in past 'blockbusters'. Fury, however, is an excellent war flick, worthy of a rental - even worth purchasing - due to a very good storyline,  superb acting from all involved,  and good cinematography / special effects. It is definitely the characters though that make this movie great. As the movie progresses, you see these guys grow / bond together (especially the newbie). You also become witness to the toll the war takes on each character,  understand why each guy acts the way they do and watch a former typist turned combat soldier become a productive member of the team. Being a war movie focusing on tanks is different and provides a fresh take on the typical war genre movie. Ther is plenty of action, and plenty of 'downtime' in this movie to allow for charter development. If you expect a full out, blow 'em up type movie, this isn't it.

6534792,2,B00M0GM4V0,"As a 'war movie' it was OK, showing tank life in ways not previously done. Where it fails is in its storytelling which is way too predictable and also fragmented. We have your typical 'new guy doesn't deserve anything cuz he's ...well... the new guy... so we treat him like crap' thing going on. Watching the new guy go from greenhorn to Nazi-hating-killing-machine was almost comical. Unfortunately for this movie (and many others regarding WW2) is it will be judged against Saving Private Ryan which had more true emotion wrenching scenes to its credit than any other war movie. Period. SPR was much the superior movie in all ways. The action sequences, character stories, chemistry, etc.. were all lacking here. Brad seemed to walk through this one with a myriad of disgusted looks on his face. But never got into the charming aspects of comraderie with his men like, for example, when Tom Hanks talks candidly about life back home with Matt Damon in SPR. Everything is rage between the old guys and the new guy. The ending was flakey with it taking multiple gunshots and two hand grenades to take down the mighty Mr. Pitt which could have been much more impactful if they cut out the super-human aspect of his personna and have him be more ordinary in regards to how easily death comes to us all in the midst of combat. Let's face it, the Rambo types where they have multiple wounds, are blown 20ft into the air 3 times and kill 20 enemy in hand-to-hand combat in a single scene just isn't a realistic war movie. This was a good effort to show, once again, the incredible sacrifices that WW2 vets made plus the hardships endured to fight a war in brutal arenas.",1424390400,5,1665,4.609427609427609

Too often writers/directors pick a side in war movies. Clearly this was told from the American perspective, however I was impressed at how they portrayed the soldiers. All is not sunshine and roses, even hero's have a darkness within them. I appreciated the struggle to maintain their humanity; The struggle to be a person who will have a future if they make it home. These guys were messed up, they had been fighting long and hard and now have a newbie in their unit. This young new soldier is horrified and unprepared for what he finds when they cross German lines.

But I saw him in a movie at Sundance in 2013 called ""Charlie Countryman"" and was very impressed with his depth of character.

Beyond that, Fury was better than expected with a few ""slow"" parts.  The scenes with the women was too long and the end was....well.

Negatives *Spoilers*
- The story. I think they were trying to do a morals or something? I'm not even sure because none of it makes any sense. Crew doesn't accept new tank crew man until he kills lots of nazi's and hate them just as much as the rest of them. Ok, fine, that makes sense. But everything else? many things just seemed completely random and didn't do anything for the story. What I think is that they were going for a moral story with the whole tank crew thing but it fell flat and just didn't make any sense. However, It's not the worst story I've ever seen and could of been bearable for some good military violence.
- The characters. Very unlikable characters, at least from my personal opinion. Everyone, excluding Nooreman, just want to kill nazi's and beat down Nooreman until he becomes a nazi killing machine. The commander, who's name I cant even remember, literally forces a gun into Nooremans hands and makes him shoot an unarmed German soldier. Maybe it's just me and other WWII movies that saw Germans as people too and we are suppose to question how humane it is to be gunning down unarmed soldiers. But this was an American patriot film for sure and gunning down the nazis seems to be the main focus. I cant' even remember the names of anyone but Nooreman to be honest with you.
- The Germans seem to be incapable. Oh, but not just any German soldiers. No, this was the SS, Hitler's Elite soldiers. And 300 of them could barely manage to take out a single American tank. Where are the Panzerfausts that almost every other German soldier was suppose to have? It may be nitpicking here but 300 ""Elite"" SS troops armed with Panzerfausts couldn't take out this tank. Even with out the anti-tank weapons they just ran around in circles in the open in front of the tank. Which was only using two machine guns and one tank cannon. Maybe they are just a bunch of green newbies that panicked or something, I don't know.
- Only 1 German tank in the entire film. the battle with the Tiger is probably the most exciting part of the film and I wanted more of that. More of that epic tank on tank combat. Battling against competent German tank crews and defeating them using tank tactics. I wanted more of that! It was gripping and exciting. The Tigers deadly 88mm gun coming around on them as they try to to get around the rear. And the Tiger crew knew what they were doing, backing up trying to prevent the Fury from getting behind them. This was truely where the film shined and I was sorely disappointed to find out that was the only scene in the film that would bring that kind of exciting combat.

Personal thoughts.
Its may seem like I'm tearing this film to shreds but for the first time I thought we were going to see exciting tank on tank combat against superior German armor. It showed so much potential and as a tank enthusiast I was looking so forward to this film and I was so disappointed. It could of been better, it could of been much much better. Maybe they didn't have the budget for tanks or simply couldn't get the tanks needed for the film. But that doesn't excuse what a bad film this is and it just felt like some american patriot film mixed in with some tank crew drama that didn't even make much sense.

You may enjoy it if you like mindless violence and killing Nazis. But if you are expecting a good story or exciting tank on tank combat you are going to be disappointed.",1424304000,15,3567,4.434451219512195

Not only was it insulting to the senses, but knowing soldiers who fought in that war and were in extreme combat, they just didn't repeatedly say ""F"" over and over and over again. It wasn't in that generation's upbringing and made it unrealistic immediately at the onset.

Frankly, I thought it was terrible! The film's stars, a group of A-grade actors seem to be competing in a  competition to prove who is the most miscast, the most arrogant, the most foul-mouthed, & overall, the most unlikeable. And the storyline is another major weak point, with very little attempt to create real in-depth characters for any of the tank crew. And there is no real story at all - it's just a day in the life & death of a tank. As for the final shoot-out (with an unbelievable loss of German Lives), while it was predictable that they would die heroes all, it is simply ludicrous. What were they thinking?

6536179,2,B00M0GM4V0,"I was really disappointed with this movie.  I love history and had heard many good things about the historical accuracy.  A lot of people that gave it a five star rating are impressed by the ""realistic"" brutality of war portrayed in the film.  The problem is it's the polar opposite of what they claim are simple minded patriotic films.  If the jingoistic movies gloss over the horrors of war this film ignores the nobility of the men that fight and the cause.  My grandfather was a truck driver in World War II and spent a lot of time telling me stories.  While I'm sure he left out a lot of things he saw I could tell by the way he spoke of his buddies and the things they did that he was proud to have been part of a greater good.

It is written by an actual Screaming Eagle and shows the good and bad by someone that was actually there.  I served during the 80's and 90's and went to Kuwait during Desert Storm.  The thing about soldiers and airmen and sailors and Marines is that they are people too, not everyone has such a fragile psyche that we all turned into raving madmen.  I know a lot of Vietnam vets that are every bit as well adjusted as the next guy.

Don't get me wrong, the director/writer crafted a pretty good film.  The tank battles had me holding my breath and Brad Pitt did a great job as a conflicted, tortured soul.  The characters weren't clichd exactly.  They were just so over the top dysfunctional it bordered on parody.  Everyone was a raving homicidal lunatic on the verge of a break down.  If the Allied troops looked like that at the end of the war I don't think we would have won.  You might believe that jingoistic patriotic movies are pro-war and you may be right but this is propaganda of another type with no interest in telling an authentic, honest story.  And it doesn't do it with any subtlety or grace like M*A*S*H or even Kelly's Heroes.  David Ayer has some talent but his anti-war message is just too ham handed and bleak.",1424217600,8,2290,4.823076923076923

6536198,2,B00M0GM4V0,"I'd like to say that FURY lived up to all the hype, and that I agreed with the other customer reviewers who loved it, but I can't.  It's gritty and realistic in the look and feel of it, but that's where it ends, because in the end it's pure Hollywood bulls***.  It's rife with stereotypical characters--and practically everyone of the characters are jerks!  What's more, the German soldiers are treated, once again, as bogeymen and cannon fodder.  And are we really supposed to believe that a single, stranded tank could effectively hold off a BATTALION of Waffen SS grenadiers?  Granted, it's a shrunken-down battalion, but it possesses what must be a couple dozen panzerfausts, where one itself in the hands of a skilled soldier could single-handedly take out a tank. It was the most feared anti-tank weapon available, short of armored tank destroyers. And are we really supposed to believe that no more than one grenadier, so armed, has the wherewithal to get around the tank and blast it, once the element of surprise has been eliminated?  And on top of all that, we're supposed to somehow find entertaining or interesting the idea of Pitt's character forcing the rookie in the bunch to kill an unarmed German soldier?  That very scene is an insult to tank veterans of WW2, (my step-grandfather's brother was just such a soldier who died in the Battle of the Bulge).  It's something that I find repugnant, not to mention the portrayal of their treatment of civilians in general, and women in particular.  You'd think they were the Soviets practicing their wave of terror in captured Berlin where they raped almost every female in sight until ordered to stop or face death!  If anyone wants a TRUE portrayal of our veterans in action, I suggest they watch HBO's The Pacific, or Band of Brothers, not this latest helping of Hollywood tripe.",1424131200,4,1842,4.819047619047619

The German house scene was way over done and I didn't like the slight insinuation that one American guy might have become a would be rapist. My husband is a WW1 and WW2 historian with a museum of both but mostly WW2 and has studied it for thirty years during which he spent 23 years in the Air Force. We have ""The World at War"" series of which we have both watched twice and it portrays horrid violence by Nazis and Russians towards civilians. When the Russians took Berlin there were atrocities towards the German women so that many committed suicide. However, nothing has been mentioned about Americans committing such crimes and I think if the odd one did commit such a crime it would be rare. Of course the Americans and British were randy and some even stood in line for whores and of which case many got diseases.
  However, the savage tank and fight scenes were interesting and of course gory. But what do you want, it is a modern made war movie. I liked most the wars scenes except the last one where the sergeant and his gang  were fighting off 300 S.S.men. Somewhat unbelievable and what was more unbelievable was the scene in which the young newly branded US soldier gets let go by one of them.

The part of the movie I thought was unrealistic was when the German SS Soldier found an American Soldier hiding under his tank.  In the movie, the German Soldier leaves the American alive and just walks away.  In real life, the German would have killed the American without hesitation.  SS had a well know reputation for shooting prisoners.  They would never leave a live American soldier on the battlefield. I guess the producers of this movie decided to borrow a scene from Saving Private Ryan, where a German soldier came face-to-face with a frightened American soldier when coming down a staircase, then brushed right past him without shooting him first.  I guess the producers were trying to convey that not all German soldiers were murderers, but in real life combat situations 'shoot to kill' is an automatic reaction.",1424044800,,1000,4.745664739884393

The movie is human and confronts  the morals of combat and violence with scenes fulfilling very basic human needs.  Plus, it takes and considers what it might take to survive.  It is not the best trained, toughest or anything else you might expect, but surely those things don't hurt; it takes luck to survive as much as anything else.  I am sure my grandfather would agree; he landed at Normandy at D-day plus 2 and fought his way into Germany, wounded several times, received 3 Bronze stars.

There are a ton of low budget decisions that were made in assembling this bottom rung popcorn movie. I think with a little effort it could have been really awful and if so, could have been entertaining. Kind of like Rambo with tanks.  First, jettison Brad.  He was great as always but he gave hope where there is none.  Then make it a cheesy low budget shootemup and we could all relax and pretend we were at the drive in. Every scene was a cliche. They didn't Fire tracers in WWII. The last scene with the German using a tiny micro flashlight was silly. The characters if just nudged a little were all cartoons.

If you want to see any semblance of reality... of soldiers faithfully depicted... don't waste your money on it. I wish I hadn't.

I'm all for realism in a war movie because it give watchers a taste of the burdens soldiers in war have to carry. The ones that survive. The realism necessary for a good war movie goes way beyond the right tactics, weapons, uniforms, vehicles and haircuts. The most important part to get right is the depiction of the people, and that's where this movie falls flat on it's face in the fake mud. The cruelty and depravity depicted in this movie is way over the top. This movie would have you believe American soldiers were little better than the SS the characters in the movie professed to hate. Yeah, war does terrible things to people. Sometimes it drives them nuts and they do unspeakable things outside and beyond the terrible things they already have to do in the normal course of war. I don't need to see jingoistic or hyper-patriotic movies about Americans in WWII, but if the American forces had one thing that set them above the Nazis, it was a basic sense of decency and a basic sense of shame when some of the group didn't live up to that decency. Whatever cruelty and depravity existed in the American forces was not systemic as this movie seems to depict. Now if Fury had been intended to show some narrow aspect of the war where American soldiers didn't live up to a standard of behavior, I wouldn't be nearly as hostile towards it. American solders did commit atrocities and there is nothing wrong with showing it as another form of history lesson. But that's not how this movie was presented. It claimed to be a faithful depiction of American soldiers at war and this old soldier calls, ""bovine scatology!"" Whatever it is, it ain't that!

All the American soldiers look even more disgusting and filthy than they probably were in real life and the crew of a typical tank is portrayed as PTSD-crazy rapists and executioners of prisoners. I know this happened occasionally but not in front of God and Everyone as shown in this movie- I think the whole film went way too far to counteract the ""aw-shucks"" heroism of Saving Private Ryan. The costumes were OK but IMO way too filthy and ""realistic"" looking. The Germans were very weirdly portrayed- sad-sack prisoners in most cases but then the Waffen SS as the boogey-man. SS dressed in clean uniforms and singing as they march as Supermen do! Yet they are incompetent Supermen who can't knock out a single ""Ronson"" Sherman tank with 300 guys and a crate full of Panzerfausts! RIDICULOUS! In real life I think they would have sent a couple of sixteen-year-old fanatics to sneak up to it and blow it to bits- the Panzerfaust was no joke! Also- tracer fire doesn't look like light sabers battling in the dark- it looks like glowing points curving weirdly.

6536440,5,B00M0GM4V0,"In Fury, a battle-hardened Army sergeant (Pitt) commands a Sherman tank and his five-man crew on a deadly mission behind enemy lines.

It has been a while since I have seen a really good war movie based on WWII and this film nails it with a with its gritty portrayal of tank battles during that time. Granted it is a fictionalized account and not always set in the reality but I liked this movie.  The acting is great from both Pitt and the supporting cast of characters that have their own unique, differing personalities. The tank battle scenes are realistic and action packed. The movie does a good job at portraying the horrors of war with the battle of morality versus the sanity of the crew. The fight scenes are chaotic, full of suspense and realistically violent with a great portrayal of the anger and hatred displayed in war. The story itself although a little predictable in its ending still does a nice job at keeping the movie suspense filled all the way through. It really does a good job at showing the despair and sadness of war even if in a fictionalize way.

6536443,5,B00M0GM4V0,"Fury is a retelling of the story of the Alamo. Saving Private Ryan has met its match by this WWII film. The story of this WWII film was wonderfully imagined. To bad Ayer was not nominated for an Oscar for his cinematic efforts. So much about this movie deserves written attention. Difficult it is to pear down the many thoughts and emotions this movie elicits.

As of this movie as of other period movies I am always amazed at how an art director, I think it is the art director who, finds equipment, automobiles, clothes, and other things used in scenes that convey real authenticity of a particular period. Too often reviews are written focusing on what appears on screen without mention of production that goes on behind the camera. That production-work makes what appears on screen work well. Production value of this film is deserving of high praise. Yet writing about this movie is hard to do without mention of what occurs in front of the camera.

Of course Brad Pitt does another excellent job at acting. He was/is that top Sargent. One dimensional his character is not. Layers of the character were dramatized well when each one individually needed to surface. As well, those layers work in combination towards shaping the character of the conveyed character. One particular scene stands out. Inside the German woman's apartment. Having had cleaned himself of war grime, looking fresh, top Sargent and Noman sit at a dinning room table, waiting to be served food, very domesticated. Calmly reading a newspaper, top Sargent sits at the head of the table presiding over an unlikely formation of an instantly formed family only made possible by conditions of war. All of a sudden in comes a barbaric presence tarnishing any semblance of domestic tranquility. Other crew members drunkenly loud enter the apartment. Top Sargent quietly accepts his rowdy crew members who behave inappropriately. Norman tortuously contains his resentment at their rowdy and crude presence. Top Sargent wisely allows these crew members to misbehave but keeps a vigilant eye on them. After all these are his men with whom he has fought many battles, and together they have witnessed devastating horror characteristic of war. Having shared such horrific conditions has allowed strong bonds to be formed among them. In this scene Pitt's character conveys silent authority, both domestic and militarily. Yet when he has to he can switch on barbaric authority, which authority his men understand, for it matches their own barbaric presence. Top Sargent demonstrates he is the alpha male of the bunch.

Another screen presence deserving mention is the actor who plays the character, Norman. To illustrate his acting ability, take the scene when tank and crew roll out of camp heading towards another military objective. Norman had just moments before arrived in camp. Having been trained to be a military clerk, he now sits inside a tank for his first time saddled with responsibility as assistant driver. Not long before this moment his muses the military had made a mistake. His newly found comrades assure him no mistake has been made. Its just throwing cannon fodder at the enemy, and it's the roll of the dice whether the newbie survives or not. It's part of military logic in such circumstances. Here it is Norman's first experience of battle with a battle harden tank crew, and he is hardly prepared to go into battle let alone going into battle as a tank crew member. As the tank rolls out of camp, Norman sits in the lower portion of the tank, his head sticking out, from a distance looking quite comical, I think. Camera at mid-range close-up focuses on this face. His is a face given to the expression of foreboding terror, portrayed convincingly well.

Another time the actor playing the character Norman does well at acting. The time after the tank crew had undergone shelling in the town. It was in this town he had met the German young woman, and with whom he might have had sex. As to whether that happened is not quite clear to me. As to whether sex did happen or not happen makes no difference. A scene of them together in the apartment sitting at the table does show a bound had formed between them, a bond formed but still very innocent. After the shelling on the town, now on the road again, leaving the town, his thoughts are unspoken but obviously of her. By his meeting her and by his being with her it gave him a sense of quiet, pleasant normalcy, a respite from the  deafening loudness and insanity of war. But now he sits on top of the moving tank, lost in quiet contemplation. Moments before he witnessed a brief but lethal incident of devastatingly eruptive force. Now Norma's face conveys a deeply felt sadness, a sadness having him at the border of numbness, a numbness felt with the thought of the irreparable damage he witnessed. This emotion is convincingly portrayed by the actor. The two scenes about which I have written are very important moments, scenes, at which time qualities of character are conveyed.

This has me wondering how a casting director, producer, and director -- whoever -- would audition actors for a part such as this requiring silent conveyance of emotion.

An accurately made observation of all the primary actors in this movie would state each did an excellent job. Each portrays a character, a common men, who when placed in abnormally dangerous circumstances, who when faced by overwhelming forces greatly and lethally at odds by his presence, who then steps up to the occasion to face the challenge, and who must introspectively reach within himself to derive uncommon strength of character towards achievement of something astoundingly remarkable although it may mean his losing his life.

This not a movie about heroics. It's about duty and integrity. It's belief in fulfilling the purpose of something greater than oneself. It's about the futility of protracted war when fighting on is absurdly irrational and is evidence of maddening stupidity.

It is impressionistic, which may be off-putting to some viewers but garners kudos in my book.  Credit also to Brad Pitt for signing on to material like this.  I think this is a level at which he shines, as opposed to blockbuster fare like ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"", which he carries dutifully without bringing something exceptional to the role.  This film can be seen on several levels, the deeper of which are very consistent with the writings of combat veterans that this civilian has read.  Think ""The Natural"" meets ""Kelley's Heroes"", but written by Richard Tregaskis.  It covers no new ground, but the old ground it covers, it covers well.

I conclude that Pitt, like Tom Cruise, is a talented actor whose talents really only shine when their mainstream success permits them to indulge in quirky material.",1423785600,,930,4.885350318471337

John Bernthal plays the most convincing character of the film. Which is a very important role in any film, without a good stand out character films can be dull. The same is true if every character is supposed to be a stand out character, but the actors are unable to pull off the performance.

Michael Pena is the best actor of the film. Could not even tell for a second he was acting.

Logan Lerman he didn't get a lot of speaking rolls, but he did a fine job none the less. His role was the realism of what we would feel in that situation. It was mostly reactionary, but it added a great deal to the film.

Brad Pitt the make up artists did a fine job creating a battle damaged commander. Mr. Pitt played off the make up perfectly adding it to his character in every expression.

No one wants to die in the last few weeks of the war, but many do...and this is the great challenge facing tank commander, Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier and the crew of a Sherman Firefly, nicknamed ""Fury"". When the assistant driver is killed, he is replaced by Norman Ellison, a clerk w/out any tank training. The crew which has been together since North Africa w/Wardaddy in command, is not amused and is unsympathetic to Norman's nerves and fears. As the tank unit pushes into Germany, Norman receives a baptism of fire and the rest of the tank crew tries to survive a war that must end soon. Wardaddy, played superbly by Brad Pitt, in one of his best performances, is the epitome of the battle hardened war veteran and his crew would follow him literally into hell. The crew includes Boyd ""Bible"" Swan, played by a mature Shia LaBeouf, in his hands down best performance - my opinion. Bible's faith is treated compassionately by Hollywood standards...""Here's a Bible verse I think about sometimes. Many times. It goes: 'And I heard the voice of Lord saying: Whom shall I send and who will go for Us? And... I said: Here am I , send me!"" Logan Lerman is Norman...I look for great things from this young actor. Jon Bernthal is Grady ""Coon-ass"" Travis, evidently of Cajun extraction; and Michael Pena is Trini ""Gordo"" Garcia. Don't be fooled by the Bible-quoting crew member...this is a gritty, violent and profane war film and if that bothers you, you might want to avoid this movie.

The only thing missing from this dis-jumbled piece of garbage was the zombie apocalypse and maybe Mad Max driving back & forth in the background.  The attempt to paint Shia LaBeouf as a ""religious"" guy was embarrassing and then Hollywood sums up their opinion of the American soldier at the end where the kid is told ""You're a hero"" after everything they did, as if to make a final, and pathetic, statement that is what America considers to be a hero.

First, I'm among the 5's because I liked the film as a gripping action film and attempt at an honest portrayal of WWII combat & stress of combat. I do agree with the critics of the final scenes. More than one Sherman was called the Alamo. But those 1 star generals should a) be obliged to watch the histrionics in The Longest Day 10 times as a penance; b) obliged to re-watch Band of Brothers (which has scenes of war crimes, brutality of war, and sex); and c) obliged to read the war diary Company Commander by Capt. Charles B. MacDonald, which is a first hand account of the invasion of Germany by USA infantry (which has incidents of war crimes, brutality of war, and sex including sex for cigarettes and food by desperate females). Among MacDonald's other works is a very good history of the Ardennes called A Time for Trumpets. As for the brutalizing effect of war and killing of prisoners that's a truth. Even the 'soft guy' in Finding Private Ryan kills a guy trying to surrender in the final scenes-- and lives. I didn't see Band of Brothers or Private Ryan sniped at with the same criticisms so I attribute the negativity to negative feeling about Pitt-- I mean a guy who snipes at the haircut probably should chose different movie fare to begin with. At any rate, the 1 Star generals missed the point in the movie and character development of the tragedy that soldiers who made it from Kassarine across the Rhine had a long string of luck enhanced by competence, that ran out. My dad, who was a real WWII vet shut me up one day when I was asking him about it (in the early Vietnam era) by saying in a most serious voice, ""That's wrong. If you're in the line for long you get killed.""  The movie reminded me of that verity.

U.S.Army Tanks had any radios so they could talk tank to tank, but Germany did.
Toward the end of the movie, after the tank threw its track the whole crew had a chance to avoid a firefight. Instead (Pit) decided to fight it out.

6536608,5,B00M0GM4V0,"I originally viewed this film in the theater several months ago and was impressed- reason
for my purchase.  The realism is extra-ordinary.  It is about a WW II M 4 tank crew  on the German side of the Rhine probably about February or March of 1945 time period.  The film reveals the savageness of the SS on its own people, the transgressions, and situations faced by American combat forces in that area.

The director forces the viewer to have compassion for the German people especially for the children which are hung from every pole and building by the SS.  The brutal conduct of attacker and defended is also addressed in vivid reality.

My favorite part of the movie was the engagement of the German Tiger tank by the three American M 4s.  The tactics used in the scene  by the M 4s are probably close to the reality of the time and provides the viewer with an appreciation of the sacrifice of Allied Tank Crews during WW II.  I am not aware of the historical basis for this movie but found information that the German tank in the film is the only survivor from that period.  Historians have summarized that over 80% of German armor were subjugated by air power during the Western Front but situations as this film illustrates were common.",1423440000,,1244,4.558558558558558
6536619,2,B00M0GM4V0,"I might have liked this movie a whole lot more if (a) it had more of a story and (b) what story it did have didn't resemble wartime comic book propaganda. It starts out fine, as a grim, heads-blowing-up lesson in War Is Hell. Kind of an ultra-violent ""Private Ryan."" I began to suspect that the writer-director didn't really have a whole story, just a pitch meeting spiel and an outline, in the way drawn-out middle section, when Pitt and his tank crew lolled around a captured German town for a *very* long time to show us some things about how hard it is to remain civil in wartime -- a lesson that could have been delivered much more economically (see, for instance, ""Private Ryan""). But that's nothing compared to the last half-hour or so, when he has completely run out of plot and substitutes endless heads-blown-off comic-book carnage. At this point it's more like ""300.""  That last part and the first part don't go together at all, and having the long midsection separate them doesn't help. I was also curious to learn from this film that all American soldiers in WW2 were hillbillies, and all German soldiers moron cannon fodder. For a movie that wants to be taken so seriously, a lot of it is ludicrous.",1423440000,3,1213,4.589861751152074

6536630,3,B00M0GM4V0,"This review is full of SPOILERS so do not read if you've not viewed the film. I'm always up for a good war movie. I particularly like tanks and tank battles. I had no per-concieved notions about the movie and had not read any reviews before watching it. The scenes were very accurate as far as equipment and other such props and the way things were set up. Very authentic. The battles were loud and did justice to a big screen TV and surround system. Acting was very good, but I did not care for some of the characters. Coon-Ass was an embarrassment really the way he acted. I'm sure there were some soldiers who acted like asses during the war, there always is. He took it a bit far and gave me angst when ever he showed up. As commander, Wardaddy did not control his men very well either, unless it was in the heat of battle. I also found myself wondering what their mission was and why. The plot did not seem very cohesive to me. I had some serious issues with a few things and some of what other reviewers have said here in their mostly negative reviews. First was a discrepancy. They sent the new recruit into the tank to clean up. The blood and guts were all over the inside of the tank, along with the deceaseds face. How did he get shot?? Clearly he was not up out of the hatch or the blood and guts would be all over the outside of the tank. If he was down inside as the blood and body parts would indicate, he would have had to have been shot through the peep hole. But it was an offset set up not just an opening where a lucky shot could have got him in the face and blew it off. He was not killed by grenade as there would be little left to remove from the tank. Second, I took great offense to the treatment of the terrified German infantryman. Deliberately murdering him was a war crime. I'm not saying it never ever happened from our side, but it think it was so rare that to put it in this film served no purpose outside of making us look bad. The same goes for the deliberate killing of the SS officer in the town. No matter how brutal they were being to their own people, he had his hands up. Take him in for a trial and then shoot him. I completely disagree with one review where he keeps saying they were rapists. Emma was NOT raped. She took a liking to the young soldier and willingly went to the bedroom, sat on the bed, and started kissing which lead to intimacy. The soldier in no way forced her to do anything and she did no fighting or showed any sign that she was not in favor of what was going to happen. So that part is bulls***. The battle between the Sherman and Tiger was fantastic. One of the best parts of the film. But being such seasoned tank commanders, wouldn't you think that once the first Sherman was blow up and they backed off that they would circle around and try to flank the Tiger? No they go full forward straight towards it and get another Sherman destroyed before they wake up and start moving in a pincer maneuver. As seasoned commanders they should have known how to handle a Tiger at that point. Then this idiotic decision to stay with a broken tank and try to fight off several hundred armed SS troops? No you get back and inform command that your tanks were all taken out and the enemy is coming well armed and in large numbers, and give them a chance to pull back. I agree with the other reviews. German SS troops were highly trained and brutal adversary's. They are not going to be stupid enough to run into heavy fire willy nilly. They are going to dive for cover and try to out flank the sitting ducks in the tank. Then this insulting nonsense where two German grenades are tossed into the Sherman and the young soldier bails out the hatch just before they go off. He comes back into the tank later and the bodies of Wardaddy and the others are intact. Really??? There is no possible way those men's bodies would not be goo on the walls of that tank. Ridiculous and insulting. When the driver put the loose grenade into his gut that too was a joke, there would have been a lot more blood and guts. Then to rub dirt into the wound they have this kid hiding under the tank then he like an idiot looks up and looks at the SS Trooper and he lets him go???? Not going to happen. First, to make it half way believable they should have had him lay perfectly still covered with dirt, and had the German think he was dead and move on. Alternatively there is no possible way the SS Trooper was not going to give him up and risk having to face the wrath of his commanders and Hitler. Decent movie if you want the loud bangs and concussions of a good war tank battle, along with accurate scenes and props. The rest is just not accurate and leaves too many questions.",1423440000,,4713,4.2030905077262695
6536631,2,B00M0GM4V0,"Fury is a great technical movie looking for a great script. Besides the Star Wars highlighted tracer rounds and munitions (So red tracers = good guys, green tracers = bad guys, GOOD GRIEF) the primary failing of ""Fury"" is the horrible character development and hackneyed plot. Firstly the acting in this movie is actually quite good for what the actors have been given. The problems stem from David Ayers take on end war veterans suffering from combat fatigue. Would there be some a-holes and rage monkeys among the allied service members towards the end of WWII? Without a doubt. But to portray every single main character as was the case in this movie does a great disservice to veterans from the war and just points out that Ayers really doesn't know what to do with his story. He wants to portray how this green newbie (Norman) would become like these other tank members in a short span of time -- from the war crime forced killing of a German POW to the cliched death of a beautiful German girl that Norman falls in love with in the period of fifteen minutes -- it just doesn't work.
I could have enjoyed the technical aspects of the movie because the one tank battle and other battles were filmed, if not realistically, at least ably enough. But the final last stand battle was so beyond realism and cliched that it really destroyed whatever enjoyment that I had gotten from the rest of the movie.

The end of the war saw many children and women pressed into services, and it does an ok job of depicting the brutality and carnage of it.  My issue with the movie is that it just wasn't very good.

The final battle was absolutely ridiculous.  I won't spoil it for you, but I mean seriously.  It was absolutely ridiculous.  If you are faced with an obstruction such as a tank, you would just go around it, especially if the tank couldn't move.  You wouldn't charge right at it, wave after wave.  That, among other issues were why I didn't care for it.  I felt that the dialogue was just kind of stupid and unimaginative.

The characters go from hating one another to being totally fine in about 30 seconds.  They get mad at each other for seemingly no reason.  They allude to situations of conflict without ever really hashing it out, so we're left wondering why it was even talked about to begin with.

Well, they took a LOT of liberties with history.  The events in this movie would have been more accurate, say, in October 1944 than in April '45, especially on the Western Front.  By then, Allied forces were moving into nearly everywhere in Germany with little or no resistance at all.  The idea of undermanned American tank brigades barely able to advance without fierce, plentiful German resistance is ridiculous.

But the thing that sticks out like a sore thumb was the scene where Pitt deliberately kills a captured German infantryman, on his knees, in front of an assembly of other American tankers. This German soldier had done nothing to deserve being executed at all; he had merely been captured. Now, an event like this could have been true after the Battle of the Bulge, IF the captured German was SS, but this guy was NOT. I reviewed that scene three times.  He was German infantry, and wore nothing that was in any way connected to the SS.  If this would have happened in real life, the Pitt character would have been court-martialed.

This mostly ruined the rest of the movie for me, and that's a shame.  I wanted to like it and appreciate it.  But I'm too familiar with the real history of World War II, so, this movie, which could have been great, simply falls into a category of mediocrity for me.",1423353600,4,1332,4.629787234042553

With the exception of War movies made while the war was going on, most were great action/adventure movies. I must say that ""Fury"" is right up there with ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Band Of Brothers"" and ""The Pacific"". Today's younger generation barely knows anything about WW2. The men who fought that war were and still are the fathers of my generation. The day after the attack on Pearl Harbor hundreds of thousands of American men lined up at recruiting stations all across this nation. I'm a disabled Viet Nam Vet and every time that I go to the V.A. Hospital and see a WW2 Vet I talk to them and let them know that because of what they did I was able to have the life that I have had. I'm sick of being told, ""Thank you for your service"".

6536794,4,B00M0GM4V0,"Quick Story recap:  The story follows a tank until during the late years of WWII as Americans are making the final push into Germany.  We see their missions and the guts it takes to carry them out.  It's a graphic movie but what else can you expect, this movie strives for realism.  They accomplished that.  This film feels very similar to Saving Private Ryan in that their are similar characters fighting the same war but different objective - the religious sniper or tank trigger man in this case,  the war weary leader who is dealing with his own internal demons but hides them from the crew - the man with the conscience who doesn't want to kill, although this movie that character changes.

The acting was terrific.  I was very pleased with all the Fury tank crew members. They were very believable as a fighting unit.  I wish I could single out which actor I think did the better acting job, but they were equally good. I think I liked Brad Pitt's character the best.

Overall, it's a tense movie, well acted, and good effects. It was interesting watching a tank unit work as I have never seen a film delve so deep into the interior relationships and how guys can view that tank as home away from home.",1423267200,,1208,4.474885844748859

6536821,5,B00M0GM4V0,"Fury is a great movie.  At first I was taken aback by the graphic violence but that is what war is.  I think that many critics miss the point.

A major point the movie made was that war is hell.  It is cruel and violent.  It has no empathy, conscience or morals.  War brings out the best in some and the worst in others and can eat away at one's humanity.

With that said anyone with common sense should know that war changes a person. Innocent young men (and now women) go to war and return battle scarred physically and/or mentally.

Fury told three stories.  The first story showed the horrors of war. The second was about the comradery of the tank unit.  The Third and most important was how Norman (the Rookie) was transformed by his experiences.

6536824,4,B00M0GM4V0,"I was impressed with the performance of the principle actors in this film.  Each of the tank crew were very believable, (including Pitt), and the caliber of their respective abilities really added to this experience.  It is riveting, and I stayed on the edge of my seat throughout the show.  I must say that I had great expectations of the film, (thinking it may be another ""Private Ryan/Band of Brothers"" level of show), prior to actually viewing it and that may have contributed to my attention level.  The tank life focus was unique to anything I ever saw, and not being an expect in the technical aspects of tank warfare, I was really impressed.

What the movie did not do was include a good ""foundation"" of what was happening around them, (as Allied troops), both throughout Europe, and their immediate theatre of conflict in the same manner as ""Enemy at the Gates"", ""Monuments Men"", or the two examples I mentioned earlier.  In this, I compared the show to the ""Stalingrad"" offering of 2013.  Most of what occurs in ""Fury"" could have happened anywhere in Europe during the war, and anytime during the Spring of 1945 in Germany.  So for me, this was a drama of an American Sherman tank crew and their individual experiences fighting WWII Germans that just happens to be in the waning months of the war.  You never really realize that the events  take place just weeks before Hitler's suicide, or Germany's capitulation a week later in May.

I was a bit uncomfortable with a couple of scenes in the show.  Nothing was unexpected, and everything was certainly present during that war, but the scenes could have handled differently with the same overall effect upon the viewer.  It isn't easy to express my opinion of the show any better right now.  I will certainly watch it again sometime in the future, but I just am not as enthusiastic as I was immediately after viewer ""Private Ryan"" or ""Enemy at Gates.""  But if you like this subject matter - do watch the show!  (I have been anticipating seeing it since I first heard about it months ago).",1423180800,,2048,4.662952646239554
6536825,3,B00M0GM4V0,"Fury, a fictional WWII movie directed by David Ayer (End of Watch), strives for realism. Set in somewhere in Germany in April, 1945, the film certainly looks very real. The sky is grey and the ground is muddy with a lot of dead bodies lying. The film also uses a genuine Tiger I tank, and it moves! That alone should make the film worth seeing. Unfortunately, the same thing cannot be said about the story.

The story goes like this. Logan Lerman is Private Norman Ellison, a young army typist who has never seen the real combat. Brad Pitt is battle-hardened US Army staff sergeant Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier in charge of a tank named Fury. Norman replaces the fifth member of the crew who has just been killed in the battle.

The story unfolds like that of a road movie, about a tank crew or a pseudo-family going on a deadly mission. Brad Pitts character is like a strict father figure teaching the young and inexperienced soldier/son how to kill, for him and the entire crew to survive the grim reality of war.

I see the point, but there is something wrong with the film. While visually trying to be realistic, the combat sequence does not look very authentic, especially in the final battle scenes. I don't know much about weapons or battle tactics, but the final battle sequence  without telling much about the details  looks so impossible. Are German soldiers so ineffective?

In short, great as it looks, Fury is filled with war film (and action film) clich. I know David Ayer wanted the film to be as accurate as possible, but I think this is a great missed opportunity for that.",1423180800,2,1584,4.579505300353357

6536862,5,B00M0GM4V0,"I really really enjoyed this film, I actually watched it twice through in two days and enjoyed it just as much as the first time. What I like so much about this movie is that it does not glamorize war, nor does it paint the characters as overt heroes. What it does do as present war as what it really is, horrific. Without in the same time not going over the top. Its motif and approach is very subtle. I have read several reviews where this movie has been labeled similar to a Horror genre War story. And I am inclined to agree.
This movie is absolutely intense from start to finish, and the acting by all the actors is top notch. Especially the 5 main characters, where all the actors in my opinion should get an Oscar nod for because they all did a wonderful job.
As a synopsis of the story without giving away too much, we are given a small snap shot of 4 tankers we find at the tail end of the war pushing through Germany. There assistant driver and front gunner has just been killed and the replacement they get is a fresh recruit 8 weeks into the army that wasn't even trained as a tanker. We then follow the characters through a number of battles, where the focus of the story is very much on the Newbie, Norman.
Near the end of the film after we have watched Norman be presented with the unnaturalness of the horrors of war, and be dubbed ""Machine"" as his war name.
I very much feel that this an allusion to that man, by his nature, must force himself to not feel, to turn off his emotions and be a cold machine to kill and commit the atrocities which war requires of them. I feel this is summed up in one line said by Pitts characters to Norman. After pointing out an entire city on fire in the distance.  He says ""Many have died in this war and many more will have to die before it is over.""
The movie is very much a study of men doing what they can to hold on to their humanity by having to do something which by its extremity, killing scores of other men, who are trying to do the same in a matter of moments over and over again.
The battle scenes are intense, and the ending battle fits the title of the movie so well, as we see through these mens actions the absolute ""fury"" which they must embrace to force themselves to face their fears and continue to fight. As the Websters dictionary definition states of the meaning of the word fury, ""unrestrained or violent anger, rage, passion, or the like.""
Overall, there is so much that could be said, and read into about this film, and I honestly feel that that was the point.
This movie in my opinion is showing us for once a non cynical side of humanity, that rather than showing us that all men are monsters by nature, that we are violent, uncaring killing machines, which we certainly can be, but points out that by our natures, we have to force ourselves in many ways to be that way. That really brotherhood of man can and does happen, but points out that for us to kill one another, so brutally, forces us to have to in a way forsake our humanity, and then in some way still be able to keep it. I think this notion of war is certainly what humanity needs to keep in mind as we move into the future. That even though what these men did in the end of the film was ""heroic"" per say, what was still done was also horrific, as we watch Norman pulling away from the scene in the end of the film, he is told he is a hero as he is placed in a medic truck. And we can see on his face such a shock of mixed emotions... It really leaves the viewer speechless, at the depth of what can be taken from his situation and what he has done...
This is certainly a movie I will watch again, and ponder over for years to come I am sure. If you are a person that is a thinker and can watch a movie for more than just screaming"" MERica!!"" then you will really like this film!",1423008000,,3820,4.134408602150538

6536918,3,B00M0GM4V0,"I enjoyed this movie in the same way I enjoyed DC's Sgt. Rock comics when I was a boy:

The commander of a Tiger tank equipped with the best optics in the world and a main gun capable of penetrating an M4 Sherman at four times that tank's effective range, decides, rather than standing off where he can easily deal with the enemy to his front, to close in, to where the agile Sherman with its faster turning turret can outmaneuver his Tiger and penetrate its thin rear armor at point blank range.

An elite, Waffen SS Kampfgruppe moves to contact in an administrative column of twos with no security whatsoever.  Every other man is carrying a Panzerfaust, yet, when they encounter a buttoned-up, essentially blind, immobile enemy tank they decide to parade in front of the bow and coax machine guns, engage the tank with small arms and, until they've lost half their number, ignore the anti-tank weapon that made short work of thousands of Allied tanks.

  It is not factual to the point that it is about a specific person's life but the war and living conditions it depicts are nuts on.....
I was in The Nam the 4th Calvary Bravo Troop of the Big Red One and was a M-60 machine Gunner on a Armored Personal Carrier.

Brad Pit and the rest of the actors bring to the screen bold and cold combat, I watched their Division Patches and they are in the 3rd Armored Calvary "" AKA known as Hell on Wheels"" This is not a imaginary movie where they slay the entire German Army with 5 men......
  It is blood and guts and I feel it depicts the Armored Units and Tankers in Sherman Tanks with no BS. In case you are not aware of it the American Tanks from the Sherman to the Sheridan and others lost 10 tanks to every German Panzer they faced,
Fortunately America could build tanks faster than the German's and the sweet easy kill spot on the Panzer was a HE round up the ass of their tanks.

I was very fortunate because in Nam we did not have to face enemy Armor but we did always travel with 3 M-48 A 1's and 7 APC..  So we lived in the field and experienced many of the same terrible living conditions for over a year.....
  Rockets. Mortars and RPG's ( Rocket Propelled Grenades ) were weapons we feared and ones that are still used on today's battlefields

 I feel this book will go into history as a great honest tell it how it was for many Generations to come.
 It's not a book for kids unless you want them to be aware of the true horrors of combat.....Which I feel every person needs to see regardless of whether they go in the Military or not....Death is a breath away from all in this movie as it is on the real battlefield....

6536969,1,B00M0GM4V0,"""Fury"" is one of the WORST movies about war and American soldiers ever made.  I sat down to watch it fully expecting a movie overflowing with violence -- the title sort of gives it away, as does the simplistic ""plot"" -- but I had hoped that Ayer, a vet, would have at least performed due diligence and gotten to know some WWII soldiers BEFORE writing the script (_I_ managed to do as much BEFORE I ever used those relationships for a professional bit of work, extolling the virtues and vices of WWII veterans), but it's obvious he did not.

Without giving away ANY specifics of the story points, let me just say that at least one extended scene -- involving Brad Pitt, ""the father"" of the crew -- does for the American Army and it's treatment of prisoners of war what Abu Ghraib did for the American Army and its stance on torture.  To pretend that ""Fury"" is a valid depiction of the majority of WII American soldiers at war -- and make no mistake, with only one or two exceptions, the majority act like Brad Pitt's ""War Daddy"" character -- is to say that ""The Santa  Claus"" is a documentary about what happens at Christmas.
I came from a military family; did time in the military; and was lucky enough to not only befriend a WWII vet during the final two decades of his life, but also got a chance to interview over a dozen of them (ground soldiers, Army Air Force, Navy vets from Pearl, the whole shebang).
Pitt and Ayers try to wax poetic about the film -- how talking with the handful of vets, who fought in Tank battalions, gave them insight (and thus hinting that they gave the film authenticity), or how it's analogous to a story about a family (only if the family's last name is Manson) -- but the fact is this is just another slasher film, dressed up in WWII battle fatigues.

The CLOSEST Hollywood has come to portraying what it was actually like for WII vets was in three different cinematic outings: ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""The Thin Red Line"" (bits and pieces of it); and, most especially, and most closely, ""Band of Brothers"".

Anyone who wants to watch a piece of cinema that portrays the violence and valor of men at war should pick up ""Band of Brothers'.
It's all in there.
Anyone -- like those waxing poetic over this piece of dreck -- who is looking for the WWII equivalent of a slasher film should, indeed, watch ""Fury"".  They'll get their money's -- and moral's -- worth.

That consideration for the FURY is a big title to live up to, and it does it with humble scenes at the introduction, and with historical pieces of nonfiction about armorized action. It is always an ultimate title to be labeled as possibly the best in the category but with the use of tanks it is the reality for many that saw the movie. The FURY, might have a good chance at that title with its visual effects of war, action scenes with the armored tanks, acting, story, and memorable amount of dialogue between characters that seemed close to that time in history. The FURY has some great scenes of battle field strategy on the fly. This movie is very entertaining because plots and stories in great movies appear to get figured out at the last minute by the audience of the last man/character standing. This is true if he is the good guy in the good guy wins type of story. If the good guy has luck with him, which coincidentally he does, the audience believes more about the characters life and experience. There is an independent style noticeable throughout the FURY supporting these issues. The FURY also has a powerful story/plot/action/acting spirit that surrounds the audience's experience and point of view. Life in the military, and in a war zone was very different then, as to how it is now. There are some dark realities of war's consequences on humanity present in this film, even by the good guys.

Well, I admittedly wasn't expecting it all that much this time around, being a WW2 film; and because Pitt was the star/main-character... Boy, was I wrong!

Every single one of the main characters w/ the exception of Lerman's (and even the ""background"" soldiers) are the worst kinds of scum: Murderers, Rapists, War Criminals, etc., even terrorizing female civilians they didn't manage to rape.  WTF?!?!
Meanwhile, ""Hollywood"" & ""The Left"" wonder why films like ""American Sniper"", which ACCURATELY portray the overwhelming majority of our troops are SO successful... LOL.

I'm not going to waste my time telling you about the pace, plot, etc. -- more than enough reviews exist regarding those topics... shockingly, I've yet to see anyone call-out this crap for being, to date, the worst kind of anti-U.S.-soldier propaganda ever to be made IN America.
(i.e., you'd expect this kind of anti-U.S.-soldier propaganda from outside America; but not from within... especially, again, being a WW2 film, where you're hard-pressed to find a single instance of any of those things happening &/or being perpetrated by an American soldier -- which is ironic, since ALL those things happened (incl. Actual Torture), with alarming regularity, by the Russians, Germans, Japanese, etc. etc.!)

I've long been a fan of Brad Pitt; but I'm dumbfounded at his choice to play this role, or even to be associated with a film this blatantly awful in it's portrayal of American WW2 soldiers.

(And I repeat ""WW2"" so much, not because that's the era the film covers, but because Hollywood can't get away with the typical cop-out they use with modern war-films, by making it just a bunch of 18 yr old boys ""playing soldier"", who act out because they're not mature enough, moral enough, or smart enough, to know/act better, and so on --- But in this, surprisingly, the only mature, moral, smart-enough guy in the film, IS the 18 yr old! --- And don't for a second think, ""Well, he's only the mature/moral one because he hasn't been through what the older guys went through""... or use the PTSD cop-out as an excuse, as they tried to do in the film, as to why they're now murders, rapists and war criminals.)

Speaking of WW2 final days, it has an great scene of how Hitler has children fight for his demented goal. Shia LaBeouf gives the best performance of his career as the religious co-pilot. You will not recognize him, which means he did a great acting job. I see him nominated for Supporting Actor. Not to take away from the rest of the supporting cast who do an xlnt job.

6537107,4,B00M0GM4V0,"The movie was pretty good. But I have a few negatives that prevent it from being 5 star.
#1 While the color is magnificent, the movie is letterboxed. What the heck, this is Blu-ray made for hi-def TVs in 2015, not 1980s square glass picture tubes. C'mon Sony, you can do better than this.
#2 The movie has some propaganda aspects and Hollywood silliness to it. For instance, Brad Pitt's character carries around a nickel-plated pimp revolver instead of the issue 1911A1 Semi-auto. Even back then I think his Commanding Officer would have told him to lose it, or at least hide it. Either Brad Pitt or the Director thought it would look ""more macho"", I guess. It looks ridiculous.
#3 The Waffen-SS troops marching in the open and singing songs. Really? In 1945 the allies had air superiority and they would have been wiped out very quickly. Plus the morale of ALL German troops by then was very low. Even the Waffen-SS knew it was over, although they kept on fighting bravely and loyally. So showing them marching merrily along like they were in downtown Berlin during a 1938 parade was ridiculous. Plus they made the CO of the SS look more like a Russian officer than a German one. The officers in the Waffen-SS fought right alongside their men. They didn't just stay back and encourage them.",1422748800,,1291,4.641921397379913

6537172,1,B00M0GM4V0,"Insulting. I guess now that the greatest generation is in the ground, it's okay to go after their memory.

What is it about TV and movies these days? The celebration and insistence on coarseness, vulgarity, and barbarism, the rubbing your face in indecency and crime? Why is not meekly accepting slander some sort of naivet? Why is nihilism 'realistic' and civilized behavior in trying circumstances or self restraint considered fantastic?

In the American military, for the most part, and as a matter of official policy, we don't (and they didn't) do things like this. We don't execute surrendering regular soldiers. (Yes, they did shoot the SS troopers, but that was in reprisal for the murder of our own POWs at their hands. If you go around operating death camps, murdering your own people to keep them in the war, and abusing surrender and the protections due to medical personnel, the Geneva conventions don't apply to you.) That execution of the regular army soldier? That gang-style 'initiation'? WTF?! Don't even get me started on the rape scene. Either this tribal-morality gang ethic is what Hollywood imagines is running in our heads, or it's the only sort of reaction to hellish circumstances they are capable of imagining.

So the lesson we are supposed to take away from modern movies is that eventually people's commitment to being civilized and decent and human breaks. Why celebrate the breaking of it?",1422748800,26,1420,5.008474576271187

6537177,4,B00M0GM4V0,"This is a very good movie that could have been great. 3 stars for script and plot (actually two plot lines here) but bump it up for a very good portrayal using a combination of props and CGI for the tanks which is a difficult thing to capture and tank warfare in WWII has been very under-represented in film compared to other aspects of that war.  This is actually two films joined at the middle - the first half follows the classic lines of the ""anti-war war film genre"" and then starting with the encounter with the Tiger tank the film turns a corner and becomes more of the classic heroic war film (Saving Pvt Ryan etc).  Shia LaBeouf does a great job acting here, Logan Lerman and Michael Pena do a good job.  A little concerned that Jon Bernthal is getting repeatedly type cast - he is a good actor but seems to only get ""crazy guy"" rolls now post TV show? Brad Pitt is well, Brad Pitt.

My main complaint with this film is the portrayal of a general lack of command and control.  Not that things didn't get a little crazy near the end as we pushed out into ""the Void"" - I suspect they did - but in actuality the ratio of commissioned officers to enlisted was higher in April than at any time since Normandy. That and a line of experienced infantry slowly moving and firing M1's from their hips was good for an eye roll, but all of these points aside this was a good attempt to capture ""Hell on Wheels"" as they pushed forward at the end.

6537277,5,B00M0GM4V0,"David Ayer (Training Day, The Fast and the Furious, End of Watch, Harsh Times, S.W.A.T, Sabotage etc) wrote and directed this film that explores aspects of WW II - and all war, in fact. It is intensely brutal, unforgivingly bitter, and graphically assaulting - just like war. It is one of the better film s to capture the way war alters soldiers and the citizens of the country who are not involved. It is painful to watch: it is important to note.

April, 1945. As the Allies make their final push in the European Theatre, a battle-hardened Army sergeant named Wardaddy Brad Pitt) commands a Sherman tank and his five-man crew - Bible Swan (Shia LaBeouf), Gordo Garcia (Michael Pe&ntilde;a), Grady Travis (Jon Bernthal) and the very young 8 week in the Army typist Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman) on a deadly mission behind enemy lines. Outnumbered, out-gunned, and with a rookie soldier thrust into their platoon, Wardaddy and his men face overwhelming odds in their heroic attempts to strike at the heart of Nazi Germany. There are a few moments when battle is not active that are memorable - the episode where Wardaddy and Norman have lunch and more in the home of two frightened German women, the confrontation of Wardaddy with Norman bringing him into the realm of being a killing soldier, etc - but for the most part the film is constant fighting, grizzly unspeakably horrid, insane, sociopathic but true to war mentality fighting.

The cast is excellent - if only the adopted varying accents would allow us to understand all the lines - and kudos to Brad Pitt, Logan Lerman, Michael Pe&ntilde;a, Shia LaBeouf, Jon Bernthal, Jason Isaacs, Alicia von Rittberg, Anamaria Marina. The musical score by Steven Price is superb and the cinematography by Roman Vasyanov is incredibly realistic.

The film is very long - just like prolonged battles in war - and the end result is a crushing question of why do we continue to participate in such wastes of lives. Grady Harp, January 15",1422662400,2,1980,4.817647058823529

6537299,2,B00M0GM4V0,"Expectation is the source of all disappointment.  That being said, I had very high expectations for this movie after reading reviews from people claiming to be tankers.  I was a tanker in the M60A3 and M1 Abrams, so all the reviews about this being the best tank movie of all time intrigued me to no end.  I didn't see this in the theater and waited anxiously for the dvd release.  I excitedly popped the dvd in the player and sat down for what I thought was going to be an exciting ride..... I was disappointed.  I am not a war historian, but I did serve in a tank battalion for 6 years.  My two main complaints were the fire commands in the tank were not accurate.  The loader kept yelling ""clear"", when he should have been saying, ""up"".  Also, the Tank Commander did not issue commands to the gunner properly, ""gunner, tank front, fire!"" or ""Gunner, coax, troops!""  Later versions are, ""Gunner, Sabot, Tank, (up), Fire, (on the way).  I know this may seem like a lame complaint, but it took away from what I thought was going to be an accurate portrayal.  SPOILER ALERT: The battle and the end seemed like World War Z with zombies constantly running towards machine gun fire with no regard for tactics.  Also, only one tank battle against tigers?  I was hoping for a little more than that.

What I did like was the ""vibe"" of the tank crew.  The T.C. was in charge, but the crew argued with him sometimes.  This goes in line with Army's quasi participative leadership style, as anyone can make decisions and question, but ultimately the highest rank makes the call.  Most civilians think that military leadership is top-down and that's that, but it is quite the contrary.

6537305,5,B00M0GM4V0,"I will get into my movie review of Fury asap but I feel it is important to go over a few things first:

WW2 TANK MOVIES:  We have tons of WW2 movies, but very few focus on the tanks and their crews alone.  I will attempt to keep this is chronological order but it is late so I may have to edit my review later. OK so first we have Sahara 1943 with Humphrey Bogart.  This is an excellent movie.  The Tank itself is of the General Grant/Lee design, which is fine, but this is more of a survival movie.  No tank to tank battles occur. (BTW the James Belushi remake was surprisingly just as good in the '90's...I was shocked as most remakes suck)  Then we have ""the Tanks are Coming"" in 1951. Very enjoyable WW2 flick in B & W, but the tanks were wrong. Along comes next is To Hell and Back and Battle of the Bulge in ""55 and '65.  Same tank accurate history and war issues. Then the comedy Kelly's Heroes in 1970.  This one was very good one on the tanks, but I read and learned later that a LOT of modifications had to be done to pull it off.  Besides, who cares when it's a comedy/adventure and the tank commander is a stoner prior the 1960's...you gotta love Donald Sutherland.  The same year was the awesome movie ""Patton.""  Man did George C. Scott portray such a great US general. But the main tank battle scene, although very well done, was not the focus of the tanks so much, but a biography of Patton. Another excellent movie, from 1977, was ""A Bridge Too Far."" , which like other '70's WW2 movies had limited resources on real WW2 tanks. Saving Private Ryan is a masterpiece to many of us, but this is when CGI took over for real working WW2 tanks. Whew! OK I make it through that part.

OK, now onto the movie FURY:

First off:  This is maybe the first WW2 tank related movie when they actually used real working WW2 tanks from 1944/45. The fact that is 2015 now (movie made last year-2014) is simply mind blowing. Only a single, workable Tiger Tank is left in the world. The Sherman Tanks were real too.

I rarely go to the theatres anymore so I waited for the DVD*  I read all prior reviews on Amazon and MetaCritic and other sources. After these, my feeling was two stars.  When I finally watched it I was quite impressed as it being a good WW2 tank movie. I'm not going to go into the whole ""political correctness"" thing which I always dislike anyway. I also won't go into the rape and brutal violence thing.  War is hell. Period.  End of story.  I'm not a real Brad Pitt fan either (but not a hater either way too), but of the few films of him I have seen him in, my opinion is this was his finest. I really liked the limited use of CGI, using things we are smart enough to know always are real and digital ones we can all see through. OK I guess that's it...now onto my sorry asterisk*

*DVD...Sony I understand your are trying to protect yourself from digital piracy.  BUT FIND ANOTHER WAY!  This whole ""UltraViolet"" SUCKS!!!  I'm sure I not the first to feel this way.  The ads say ""it takes only a few seconds""  what a joke that is...more like a few hours or a $20 waste on a flick you already purchased at a retail store. If someone buys a movie, they should expect it to play on any devise with a DVD, without filling out online forms, creating passwords, signing up and registering with your store and/or a third party which will only complicate matters further!  Trying to read codes that are barely legible...if at all.  Then to get rejected by each and all due to tech issues on your end?  Plus Ultra Violet has no 24/7 phone support, in fact ZERO phone support AT ALL!!! This is going to very seriously hurt DVD movie sales of your flicks. In fact, moving forward, if I see the words ""Ultra Violet"" on any DVD in retail or online moving ahead, I will skip it and wait to watch the movie years later on regular TV instead.

Finally to my fellow Amazon reviewers:  I'm sorry about my rant on UltraViolet."" but I was hoping someone could share their experiences with this BS... as far as Fury, absolutely do I want comments back.

Take Care all, TK, over and out!",1422662400,6,4083,4.267880364109232
6537306,4,B00M0GM4V0,"War is hell and we cant imagine the feeling of being in battle. But I believe that Fury does a good job of bringing that complexity of the fog of war onto the big screen.
In Fury, Don Wardaddy Collier (Brad Pitt) does a good job an average soldier rising to the occasion. He is leading a  group of men in the finally of the European theatre in 1945.  He has a deadly mission behind enemy lines.  This cohort is outmanned, outgunned, and out strategized.  These boys struggle to make it but know they are fighting for a bigger cause than themselves.
The movie takes you to the front line and the complexity of trying to stay alive while there is death all around.  More than a war movie, it is one that shares the story of forgotten heros. The men who risked it all for freedom.  One heck of a movie. Wilson Trivino",1422662400,,814,4.253246753246753
6537307,1,B00M0GM4V0,"The movie from the start to the middle was just okay.

By the time we get to the pivotal part where the tank crew gets stuck in the middle of the road and ends up having to face off with a large group of German SS troops heading their way the film takes a drastic turn southward.

Suddenly the tank crew of five end up being the Alamo in Germany. The movie then becomes an complete over the top unrealistic battle sequence that has the crew fighting off German soldiers like John Rambo. Every scene in that last battle was unbelievable on all levels. Making a well trained and armed German force seem like they were inept at combat tactics and strategy to take out one tank was the most ridiculous part of that movie.

The last half of the film was just unbearable and I nearly walked out on it. Save your money and time by renting or buying or re-watching other movie classics as Saving Private Ryan or A Thin Red Line.",1422576000,7,920,4.275862068965517

6537330,1,B00M0GM4V0,"More melodramatic stereotypical surface deep depictions of soldiers and war made by people who have no idea what they are talking about.

Its blatantly obvious they did not get a military advisor / consultant to help them with the movie.

My issues:

1. Like always, very little to none of the language is correct.

2. The stereotypical undisciplined Americans with their brooding leader holding them together has been done to death by hollywood. Now its ""Platoon"" this time with tanks. And as always the young new lieutenant that no one listens to and is so green he has no idea how to lead.... In 1945... Placed in charge of an independent tank platoon..... Cause that happens all the time when you are near the end of the war and have a vastly superior number of tanks and men available.

3. The stereotypical incompetent Germans. amazing Germans could conquer like 90% of europe but some how cant knock out one tank and need to be two feet from it to be able to hit anything. And some how, supposedly set in April 1945 when the german army was nearly broken and fighting its way to surrender to Americans and brits can muster a complete 18-24 year old SS battalion that not only is incompetent but seemingly very happy to be going to war. Even though at the time anyone that age was either dead, had been at war for 2-4 years, or was mixed in with composite units with old men and young boys.

4. The randomly indestructible Sherman. Somehow survives a direct hit to the side by a Tiger - yes I know those who watched it will say the pipes on the side stopped it, but no, thats not what would have happened or did happen. The Sherman front armor was several inches thick while the side was a fraction of it. A Tiger shooting from literally feet away like in the movie would have not only gone through the first side but out the other side of the Sherman. Following that a direct hit from a panzerfaust, the best anti-tank rocket in WW2 which absolutely cut apart far better tanks than the sherman, not only penetrated the sherman but somehow didn't do any damage but kill one guy inside... Because that how AT rockets work? NOPE.
And referring back to point 3, can someone explain why the Tiger moved at all to begin with? All it had to do is sit there and pick the Shermans off as they closed in on them.

5. Contrived plot points with no idea how weapons work. So in a city with a LOT of high building an artillery barrage manages to plunge into a square... Except howitzers - what would have been used - don't plunge at a 60-80 degree angle they would need to clear all those buildings. And the ONE building they hit just happens to be where the guys girlfriend is?? And WHY exactly did they shoot a few random shots at that town anyway?? Thats the best they could do to make the point war is bad and good people die?
How long does it take to load a Sherman tanks main gun? It seems it goes between .5 seconds (time it took between first and second kill shot on tiger) and 30 seconds (time it took every other shot).

6. Battlefield justice by american thug soldiers. Lost count of the war crimes. Its seems to be okay to depict war crimes if Brad Pitt is doing it. I mean, its not at all slandering millions of men who did nothing like what was depicted - shooting an unarmed kneeling prisoner in the back for no reason.... really???

All things considered Id give it 1.5  stars because at least they did try to make the visual effects entertaining. But if you are looking for an accurate depiction of warfare or even just tank warfare, a good well written story, or characters you could like in any way...

This movie was fresh in a sense that we get to see battle behind the steering levers of a M4 Sherman.  Other than that, it was a complete waste of time.  The word ""honor"" has no meaning to Ayer.  What you get is a group of unlikable characters with a 30 ton tank, a weak narrative packed with bromides and cliches, a short-lived romance that really adds nothing to the story and an anticlimactic ending.

The basic story could have been so much better, but is so predictable and cliched.  Oh, yeah - everyone but the kid dies - really?  I didn't see that one coming from the second Norman appeared in the second scene of the movie.  Oh, and tank battles in WWII where the tanks are literally 25 yards apart moving in circles around each other firing furiously didn't happen.  And the last battle scene has one glaring continuity issue - it goes from afternoon to pitch dark of night in seconds - mostly to justify the beautiful shots of soldier, tanks, and smoke backlit by the orange light of fires burning.  Also, Brad Pitt gets shot by a sniper 3 times in the chest and survives to have a last heart-to-heart with Norman the kid.",1422576000,9,898,4.406060606060606

After three days I'm still thinking about some of the scenes and the sacrifices this tank crew made. And I've got to say this is the best WWII movie I've seen since Saving Private Ryan. The action is almost non-stop and I was honestly on the edge of the couch during the battles. Especially the one where they go up against a German Tiger. I could feel the tension and the fear the tank crews experienced when they fought to survive against a much faster and better armored German tank.

I think the most amazing thing about this movie was the power of each death. Even the losses of some of the supporting cast that we didn't see much of. From the first tank commander's death to the German girl in the air raid. I'm not sure how to explain it other than to say the director and writers were able to invoke a powerful emotional reaction from me in each scene, and that's pretty rare.

For instance, they do not collect all the ammo off the outside of the tank and put it where needed. They also do not develop a strong defense position.

It's just nauseating the lengths that these liberals will go to dishonour our soldiers, the men that fought and died so that they could hide safely behind their sacrifice and make trash like this against their own country.

Edit 1/30/15 - Just to help describe how clownish this movie was, there is a scene towards the end of this trash where Pitt's character has been shot 5 times at close range in the chest by a German sniper, and after that he calmly finishes closing the hatch of the tank, groans and then kinda rolls over to the bottom of the tank where the Morgan dude is already at. Into the tank comes two German hand grenades and while the grenades sit there on the floor of the tank smoking, these two discuss Morgan's escape route, he then opens the escape hatch, squeezes through the tiny opening, reaches up to close the hatch and we finally hear the pop of the grenades. Who knew that the nazis had grenades with fuses in them that burn long enough for the person they were thrown at to run at least a half a mile away? People shot in the head with their brains blown out would be going ""Ooooooo."" In one scene a hidden German soldier with an MG42 takes on this Sherman tank at point blank range and then hangs around while the tank slowly swings it's main gun around to aim at him. Americans would win the battle for the small town and all these hot German chicks, dressed to the nines and perfectly coifed, would immediately amble out of the wreckage and climb up in the tank to service the crew.

This movie will totally insult your intelligence, unless, of course, you have none.

One more add, 1/31/15, would any of you five star reviewers who loved this movie go into a town of German women and treat them the same way the characters in this movie did?

I was pleasantly surprised by the show!  What an outstanding cast and script!  Brad Pitt really is a master at acting!  The movie draws you in to a brother hood of survival where the everyday norms of a civilized society simply do not exist.

6537500,5,B00M0GM4V0,"A grimly realistic and tense war movie set in April 1945 follows the brutal combat missions of a U.S. tank crew fighting in Germany during the final days of World War II.  With the War nearly won, Germans cities and troops surrendering in huge numbers and Allied aircraft dominating the skies over the rapidly shrinking Reich, fanatical pockets of resistance continue as this U.S. tank, Fury, and its brave crew face more heavily armored German panzers and hundreds of infantry fighting desperately to stop the invasion of their homeland.  The superb acting, writing and vivid depiction of violent death make this film worthy of comparison with Saving Private Ryan.   This is one of the few war movies that attempts to depict the cramped and horrific conditions endured by soldiers inside tanks during combat.  While the acting is uniformly excellent, Brad Pitt is particularly convincing as the battle hardened commanding tank Sergeant.  Realism is somewhat muted at the very end when the dead body of the Sergeant (killed by German grenades thrown inside the tank) is actually recognizable. Another puzzling scene is following the harrowing battle with a Tiger Tank when three of the other U.S. tanks are knocked out, but nobody from Fury goes to search for survivors amid the destroyed tanks. Perhaps no film could ever really depict the ghastly horrors of combat.  Fury was a worthy attempt.",1422403200,2,1395,5.065502183406114
6537501,4,B00M0GM4V0,"When this first started playing, with the red laser beams I wondered if this was going to be some sort of Star Wars World War II mash up and if Pitt was going to emerge from the hatch of the tank and start deflecting the enemy's fire with a lightsaber while some ewoks rode logs that would smash into the sides of German tanks taking them out.  Thankfully apart from the bizarre red laser beams the rest of the movie is pretty time period accurate.  Other reviewers have found fault with the tank battle tactics and they're probably right but from an entertainment point of view they keep the story rolling and I from the inside the tank scenes definitely got the claustrophobic and unpleasant feeling of what it must have been like to endure being inside one.  Fury is basically a morals of war story, where we pretty much experience the last part of World War II, where the allied forces advanced towards Berlin, through the eyes of a young guy who is pulled from his typist job to replace a killed in action tank soldier.  Spoilers follow - It is obvious that actual war is a lot different to what the young man thought it would be, and that he clearly had a romanticised viewpoint of what soldiers need to do, likely believing that the Germans were the only ones to do some things he witnesses by our side and is asked to do. His reluctance to kill anyone without reason costs another tank crew their lives and his angry crew need him to get over that so they can survive the war and demand he shoots an unarmed German prisoner of war as the soldier begs for his life.  His morals will be further be tested with the German female survivors of a town the allied forces capture.

In a way this is your often told war tale of a newbie winning acceptance by a group of hardened soldiers that have been fighting together for years. But it's refreshing that it isn't a patriotic our side were the good guys so never did anything wrong black and white viewpoint of war.  I backpacked Europe in 2000 and 2001 and spent quite a bit of time in Germany and did hear some of the survival stories by women who were kids or young women during the fall of Germany and think it's nice that an allied country made movie actually acknowledges what they had to go through. When I and other backpackers from allied countries such as the US heard these tales we all later acknowledged we never thought about that side of things at all and certainly aren't taught about that in school. So for those women I think it's great that it is included, even if obviously the scenes in the Fury movie are a lot milder version.  I think the actresses did a great job at portraying these woman especially the woman being pulled up into the tank being told she will also be sleeping with the other guy as well.  You could see the fear and acceptance of doing what it took to survive in her eyes.  The hiding the younger girl to try and avoid the same fate also parallels the stories I was told. Obviously not all allied troops participated in this sort of thing but it's good that the fact it did happen in some towns is acknowledged.

The ending of the movie again falls into the Hollywood over the top type way of cheapening the realism in order to have a big action experience. Dumbing down the ability and skills of the enemy to me doesn't acknowledge the skill, guts and bravery that those who fought and survived as well as those who also paid the ultimate price.  But this is a standard Hollywood practice. Overall though it's a good war film and well worth watching.",1422403200,,3544,4.385670731707317

Perhaps that was done on purpose to make the character's easier to identify with, but I didn't feel any particular amount of empathy with any of the crew.

The special effects, cinematography, and lighting are all on point. Thought pace of the story was a little lethargic at times, although this would have accurately reflected the character's dispositions.

Some of what I assume is to be dramatic dialog between characters feels wasted and nothing more than filler. I often felt myself ticking off the moments until the next action scene. In my opinion, this particular film is placing a premium on historical accuracy at the expense of storytelling.

Not a terrible movie by any stretch but I expect more with Pitt as a executive producer.  Would have liked to see a stronger cast and a more compelling/fleshed out plot line.",1422403200,,995,4.8698224852071
6537532,1,B00M0GM4V0,"I am not sure how Hollywood accomplished depicting American soldiers in WW2, the most clear cut war in history, as the bad guys and Nazis as morally ambiguous or even good, but here it is folks. A ""modern Hollywood"" take on WW2 where American soldiers are a bunch of thugs invading Germany, executing prisoners, drinking, sleeping with prostitutes etc. I couldn't believe my eyes. Was this movie sponsored or made by some Nazis, pouring money into Hollywood from hiding in Argentina?

There is one scene towards the end of the movie, where one of the main characters gets overrun by an SS brigade. As you might remember from history class, the SS troops were Hitler's most ruthless, most loyal, most murderous thugs. So this American soldiers hides under a tank so that they don't spot him. But one of the SS troops has a flashlight, looks under the tank and spots the American soldier. ""He's done, gone, dead, game over."" Or so I thought. It turns out, the SS soldier smiles and leaves the American alone. OH WHAT A WONDERFUL GOOD HEARTED NAZI SOLDIER THIS IS. He only spent the last six years murdering innocents but now this most loyal Hitler follower, when he is most desperate, fighting to save Germany from invasion and his fuhrer from certain death decides to spare this American soldier hiding under the tank AND SMILE AT HIM.

There are scenes like these throughout the film. It's actually sickening to watch. The movie has no basis in history and completely sends the wrong message.

Now that we have that out of the way, and you might be thinking...well, forget the nonsense, I just want to see some good old Americans vs Nazis shootouts. Is the movie actually any fun to watch?

It turns out the film is actually really dull. If you are looking for some battle scenes or some depiction of what was happening during that time in the war, you will not find it here. Most of the time we are forced to look at a closeup of Brad Pitt (which by the way is waaaaaay too old to be playing an American soldier in WW2, or any soldier for that matter). It seems like the filmmakers paid so much money for Pitt's services that they felt like he has to dominate every single scene. I mean, I don't think there are 5 seconds in this film where Pitt is actually not shown. I mean, I understand he plays the main character but you are making a historical film here, right? Or is this Brad Pitt's ego trip film where he gets to be a soldier? If only he played a memorable and well written character. Instead he depicts some psychopathic idiot that executes prisoners of war, forces his fellow soldier to murder others and to have sex with German women at a liberated town. I mean, he is just a bundle of joy to watch. You would think he is playing a Nazi in American uniform.

To sum it all up, this movie is not only a bore, it is downright wrong when it comes to historical accuracy, it insults the viewer by showing things that never happened and it just leaves a bad taste in your mouth by actually accomplishing something that I never saw a film do before, painting American soldiers as thugs and murderers and showing Nazis as victims to borderline good guys.

6537558,5,B00M0GM4V0,"Fury"" is one of the best movies made by Hollywood in a long long time.

And notice that I'm not saying ""best war movies..."" but

Best movies.

The horror of the final months of World War II in Germany has never been depicted this well, and I only wish some more of the men who had been there were still around to discuss it, now that this movie was with us. One of those men was my father.

But first, a bit about the authenticity.

One of the worst things about many of the later World War II movies (most silly among them, ""Patton"") is that they got little or nothing right. American tank soldiers fought inside Sherman tanks, not those later American tanks (like the ""Pattons"" utilized in the movie ""Patton""). And the Shermans were decent tanks -- except against the best of the Nazi armor. In order to do a decent job with the movie, ""Fury"" had to locate real Shermans (and a real German Tiger tank) that could be used. Otherwise, everything else would have been lost to the lack of authenticity, which is what the movie had to have.

But more than that, the movie had to be authentic to the reality of the men who ended their war in Germany (and Austria and Czechslovakia, the last three countries to be taken -- and that's the correct word, not the Cold War ""liberated"" -- from the hands of the Nazi leadership) in May 1945. For the soldiers on the job with the U.S. forces during those months, the job was killing ""Krauts"", ""Heinies..."" etc. And the job of the ""Krauts"" was killing Americans (and British, Canadian, and French invaders coming from the West; or Russians from the East). Both sides got very good at their jobs.

""Fury"" takes that job seriously, depicting the job by portraying the five-man crew of one Sherman tank during that last month before Adolf Hitler's suicide and the final surrender of the remnants of the Nazi empire. It the simplest way, ""Fury"" is another ""War Movie"" (caps necessary), a buddy movies, and more. A tank crew is led by Brad Pitt (as US Army S/Sgt. Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier. As the movie begins, the crew consists of Shia LaBeouf as Boyd ""Bible"" Swan, Michael Pea as Cpl. Trini ""Gordo"" Garcia, and Jon Bernthal as Pfc. Grady ""Coon-Ass"" Travis. In the first nasty battle portrayed in the film, they have lost one of their crew, ""Red."" They receive a young replacement, Logan Lerman playing Pvt. Norman ""Ellison (who doesn't get his non de guerre -- Machine""  -- until nearly the end of the story). The tank platoon starts the movie with ten tanks, and by the end there is one. The film depicts how that comes about. The portrayal of the men doing the tank work should earn any of them at least an Oscar nomination, and their lives together inside that bucket of steel is portrayed in the claustrophobic horror that was actually experienced by U.S. tankers during those years -- and especially those final months. All that said, ""Fury"" might just have been another one of those war movies where the ""kid""learns to be a good soldier thanks to the work of the ""old man."" But this isn't ""Sand of Iwo Jima"" or any of a dozen of the sanitized bedtime stories we were told as children in the 1950s and 1960s using Hollywood propaganda that began in the 1940s.

In order to do his job, the ""kid"" has to be taught to be a killer, and he resists. Trained for a mere eight weeks to be a clerk typist, ""Logan"" is snatched from a replacement truck and ordered to be the machine gunner on ""Fury."" When he protests that his only military skill is typing ""60 words a minute,"" Wardaddy begins the replacement's new training, with the help of the rest of the family who work inside ""Fury."" Norman has to become a killer to be a good worker and a fellow soldier, so that by the time the other men bestow on him his war name -- ""Machine"" -- he has learned his trade and is doing it well. ""Idealism is peaceful,"" Brad Pitt's character tells Norman at one point. ""History is violence."" And that violence is depicted as almost never before in an American film (and rarely in others, one of which comes to mind -- the Russian ""Stalingrad""... but that's another discussion for another time).

By the time of that final battle scene, all the stages have been set, and all the cliches and pieties of previous American war movies have been obliterated or at least severely damaged. Wardaddy's life and fate are not out of ""Sand of Iwo Jima"" or any of a dozen other war myths that come to mind with alittle thought.

This is important.

One of the most pernicious bits of the historiography from the final months of World War II was the claim that the Americans were fighting ""old men and kids"" after the German Army ""lost"" its remaining major reserves in the Battle of the Bulge and Nordwind. Left out of that story is the fact that those ""kids"", some as young as 14 and 15, were fanatical Nazis who had been trained from the day they entered school under Hitler's versions of reality. As a result, they were as deadly as the men who had raped their way across Poland, France, and Russia a few years earlier.

I have a hunch that ""Fury"" will get good reviews from the remaining men (and few women) who are still around who actually lived the combat of those months at the ""end"" of World War II in both Europe and ""The Pacific."" Sadly, I won't get to have those conversations with my parents, because both -- both combat veterans -- are long dead.

My father ended his war after fighting through Germany into Austria with the 44th Infantry Division, one of the 80 or so U.S. divisions that never made it to Hollywood. He came home with one desire -- to begin that family he and my mother had promised each other when they got married a few months before Pearl Harbor. By April 1945, he was in the Army in Germany and she was in the Army (Army Nurse Corps) on Okinawa. The year 1945 was different for each of millions of men and women across the planet, but one of the jokes in our family was that they really understood the meaning of SNAFU. My mother enlisted in the Army Nurse Corps because the enlistment office promised her that she'd be there -- in Europe -- to patch up my Dad if he was hurt. Naturally, as soon as the paperwork was in, she was sent to the other side of the planet.

But they did get together by December 1945, after the G.I. protests in ""The Pacific"" demanding that ""Bring the Boys Home."" (They didn't mention the girls; there weren't many of them).

And so they got their dreams, and in September 1946 I was the first of the four children they had, keeping that promise from early 1941.

But there were mysteries we never could solve.

My father came home with a Bronze Star, a Combat Infantry Badge, and a ""yearbook"" from his regiment. My mother came home with a little mimeographed booklet of home addresses for all the men and women who had served on the island with her field hospital. Every Christmas, our home was filled with Christmas cards from all over, most of them the men and women Mom and Dad had ""served"" with.

How does that relate to ""Fury""?

Like most boys growing up during the John Wayne 1950s, I wanted the stories. We read ""Sergeant Rock"" comics and say all those movies about World War II (which got less and less real as the Cold War decade went onward).

No matter how many times I asked my Dad how he got his Bronze Star, the only answer he ever gave was ""I got lost one night and I got lucky...""

My mother, remembering her war, had nightmares until they took her over the edge. But since ""PTSD"" wasn't well known then -- and the American Dream said that women hadn't been in combat anyway -- her healing was more difficult than Dad's. He worked, his post ""service"" service being the U.S. Post Office.

But the questions remained, and over the years they only grew. What were those wars in 1945 like?

Well, little by little Hollywood is catching up with the facts that were reported early after the war, then suppressed in the lies of the Cold War.

And one of the best things about the movie ""Fury"" is that it gets those who are paying attention back to that real war that American (and British, Canadian, and French) soldiers actually had to fight after they entered Der Vaterland in early 1945, following the termination of ""The Bulge"".

The one thing that was certain, the Germans were not being ""liberated"" as the French and Belgians had been. The Germans were fighting -- virtually all of them -- and dying fanatically for the Reich. And as ""Fury"" depicts, those who had second thoughts were lynched by their own fellow citizens.

That's why, as our fathers did explain, in very few words, every major city in Germany had to be reduced to rubble. By air and artillery, and finally house to house. Not all the Germans in 1945 were Nazis supporting Hitler's last festungs. Just the majority -- male and female, adults and ""children.""

Fury does as good a job showing what those final weeks of the war in Europe were. As good as ""were like"" can offer. Because if we were paying attention, our parents taught us that war IS -- and not ""like"" anything else. Hollywood can only do so much, once Hollywood decides to try and tell a story honestly.

I wish my Dad were still around so we could watch this movie and talk about it together, but he was buried 19 years ago alongside the brewery in Newark, New Jersey. My Mom had died ten years before that, never fully recovering from the nightmares she brought home with her from Okinawa. Medicated, she wrote hundreds of notes on slips of paper about he lives, by the end believing the Jesus was speaking to her -- between bouts of writing about the broken men, women and children she used her nursing skills for between April and September 1945.

So now, Hollywood has brought us ""Fury."" It's about tankers, specifically the 2nd U.S, Armored Division fighting through Germany in April 1945. By then, Europe was a killing field from ""East"" (where the Russians were heading into Berlin) to the ""West,"" where my father and a million young men like him were heading through Germany.

One of the best things about ""Fury"" is that the men who play the tankers in it trained for their acting roles in two ways. They listened to the men who were still alive (not many) from the Second Armored Division. And then they got some ""basic training"" from Navy SEALS to give them a bit of a sense of what some of it was ""like."" I think they did a decent job in telling a brutal story that doesn't hedge on the realities those men faced in those days.

As the movie notes at the beginning, most of the U.S. tankers in Europe were doomed men. The German armor was better than the U.S. tanks, and so, as ""Fury"" shows, Sherman tanks fighting German Tiger tanks were as a serious -- and suicidal -- disadvantage. There are dozens of scenes so authentic in the movie as to make you cringe, and the dialogue is as close to ""reality"" as possible. Men at war use the ""F"" word a lot, and in all its variations. None of the dialogue is cleaned up in ""Fury"" for some politically correct later day.

There are a dozen scenes that make the movie memorable, and at least eight actors who deserve to be recognized for their work.

But perhaps the final scene does as much as could be imagined.

The lone survivor (I know, spoiler alert) is the kid' Norman, who at first refused to be a killer, as the war demanded.

""You're a hero buddy. You know that?"" the soldiers who put him in the ambulance say as the scene ends the movie. And I have a hunch that most of the men who came home from those brutal months knew that a ""Hero"" was just a young many who had gotten lost one night and ""got lucky.""",1422403200,9,11577,4.4289746001881465

6537562,4,B00M0GM4V0,"I just watched fury on Blu-ray  tonight, I was looking forward to this movie since I have not seen it in the theatre. I do not go to theatres often due to crowds or not many good movies these days. I am a interested in history WW2 to ancient life medieval  to WW2 and the wars that went through history in the past. Because I know history I may be more critical of this movie on facts and what is not. First off I would like to say that I really liked this movie , since very few movies these days are made about WW2 or ancient and Medieval anymore, Because 21st century young generation do not care about history, maybe a very few but not much. This movie is part fact part Hollywood  and some false filmmaking  about WW2. Most people who do not know history will rave about the movie, If you know history and armies of WW2 you will know there is some American propaganda in the film, even so it does not make this a bad movie. The movie has good action , though I wish it was more longer and more battle scenes. Saving private Ryan had more action than did fury it too was Hollywood to a point but more fighting scenes of combat. The Hollywood part of this movie is putting a Mexican driver in the crew of the tank in this movie, Yes there were some but very few Mexicans who served in WW2  and the character was put in the film due to more Mexicans living in the U.S. today than in the 1940s. There is nothing wrong with that but it is Hollywood and marketing purposes to draw Mexican viewers . A more realistic tank crew would have been like in the Movie Sahara with Humphrey Bogart, but that is 21st century marketing here. I also question if U.S. tank crews were so brutal in killing the enemy as portrayed in this film with so much hate , yes it was war but I doubt it was actually like in this film , again more Hollywood. Brad Pitt was excellent and so was most of the crew but I still did not bond or care about the other characters , they seemed more like modern 21st century than 20th century 1940s men would be. Again Sahara is 1940s more realistic, than this film. The propaganda part of this film is some of the battle scenes, Which by a military view are unrealistic. The Scenes were German Artillery can not hit Tanks at close to medium range . And the Scene were the Fury tank disabled fights off a German SS battalion , When you watch the film you will see the Germans with several soldiers with panzerfaust's marching to where they will fight Fury and the crew. This staged Hollywood battle would not be this way in real combat. Soldiers are not stupid especially the German SS,  The first thing they would have done was use all the panzerfausts against fury and destroy the tank with ease with it's  2 inch armor. Instead you have this big dramatic gunfight proving American bravery and firepower and heroism and superiority , thus the propaganda part of the film. This scenario would never have happened in real life in war. I just wanted a more realistic war film in this regard, from the point of view from both sides , The other thing I wish there were more tank and field battle scenes. The battle with the Tiger tank is brief  in this film , one Tiger versus several Sherman's some fact some Hollywood again, in this movie. I wish the rest of the tank crew characters were better and more likeable some were real scumbags. Many foreign films portray WW2 much better than Fury and more realistic with little or no propaganda , not glorifying war but showing the horrors of war and the soldier much better. However I still like Fury and I am glad it was made because so few movies today are made about history, so I still give it 4 stars  and it is worth watching and owning on DVD. You have to know WW2 history and armies and weapons to be more critical Like  I was about this movie , it is mostly Hollywood but still good to watch.",1422316800,,3858,4.258196721311475
6537563,4,B00M0GM4V0,"The  production value  and acting  are  all  good to  first-rate.  My  problem  with  this  film  is a  tendency  I  see  now  with  many recent  WW2  films.  The  Saving  Pvt.  Ryan cliche  ending.  This  is the  third  or  forth  recently made  big  Holywood  WW2  film  that  has  to  have a  handful  of  brave  GIs  holding  off the  Nazi  hordes.  We  first  got  this  fantasy  ending  from  Saving  Pvt  Ryan  back  in  1998  and unfortunately  it  has  now caught  on as a  required feel  good  ending  for these  kinds  of  films.  This one  had  to  have a  job  done  on  the  SS  so  our  gallant  tank crew  shoot-up an  SS  battalion!  The  film  was  good  up  to this  point,  and with  a better ending  surely  would  have  been  great.

Don't  get  me  wrong,  I  don't  have a problem  with the Germans  or  SS  getting  smeared,  but  I  think  this  has  become  all  too  predictable  and  takes  away from  what could  have  been a  really  great film  about  US tankers.  I  hope  this  is  the  last time  we  have  to endure a  GI  last  stand  against  the  Nazi's.  Something  tells  me  though  that  this  will  not  be  the case and  this  cliche  ending  has  now  become  the  required  norm.  Maybe  it  would  be  good  to  see the war  from  a non-US  perspective  for a  change too.  We  were  only  in the  last  half  of  it  after all.

6537592,4,B00M0GM4V0,"This movie isn't about being American, British, Russian or German.....its about what happens to everyday normal human beings under the conditions of war, and how fear, hate and desperation can make even the most civilized of people under these conditions. It may be about an American tank crew, but the reality is that it could have been one from any warring nation.  A very violent picture, but anyone that thinks that war is all clean uniforms, 8 hours of sleep every night, full bellies of hot cooked food, and ""please and thank you"", should wake up and understand that its about life and death under the worst of conditions. I wouldn't rate the acting as top notch, but I looked past that, and tried to see what the story was about, and in that respect, it was a great war story. Where I was disappointed was the ending with the ""shoot out at the OK Corral"" type of showdown. The movie calls the enemy ""battled hardened SS"", but the truth is that the Waffen SS of late '44 and into '45 was not even a close resemblance to the SS of '40 and '41 towards the beginning of the war. Towards the end of the war, mostly old men and boys made up the ranks, with a few veterans mixed in. That said, even these soldiers would not have run straight into machine gun fire only to be mowed down like lemmings. These soldiers with a Panzerfaust easily could have knocked out this tank and the crew with it, and with only a handful of men. The scene with Brad Pitt trying to force one of his crew to execute the German captive was interesting. Although many are offended by this scene that ""American"" service men would do such a thing, the reality is that after the Malmedy massacre of captured Americans by the Germans in the Battle of the Bulge, US soldiers attitude, bitterness and hate towards Germans grew immensely, and there was some reprisal towards the enemy thereafter. The tank charge as well towards the Tiger tank was somewhat unbelievable, as the Sherman had to get to the side or back of the Tiger in order to knock it out. Shermans running full speed ahead, and 10 feet apart would be easy pickins for a Tiger, and unless the tanks were more spread out in order to overcome the Tigers slower turret traversing speed so that one or two of the Shermans could make it to the side, or back of the tank, its seems a little unbelievable. For those that think this movie is an insult to the ""American"" service man, I repeat, these soldiers could have been from ANY country on the planet. Having heard stories from my uncles (one with a glass eye, two with legs off below the knee), what a person is capable of in times of war is unimaginable. Having seen these men break out in tears as they talk about friends lost, freezing cold, fear of bleeding to death, and watching EVERY person that they approached and wonder if they would draw a gun, a knife, or pull a grenade on them. They would always tell me that its wears on the nerves to have to do this day in, and day out. If one puts the acting aside, forgets about the  nationality of the uniforms and looks at the picture for what it is, I give it four stars!! I enjoyed it!!",1422144000,6,3127,4.371134020618556

The essence of tank crew relationships, is captured very well.

The sound effects of high velocity rounds bouncing off the slope of the beast is pretty impressive.

Tracers. Tracers. Tracers.

Violence.

Anyway, the movie is pretty dang on point. It made me legitimately miss the hell out of being a tanker. There are aspects that are unrealistic, but not too bad. A seriously awesome thing about it, is that the movie is about a crew and some event they experience. It's not one of those stories where ""the fate of the entire world depends on one team"".

At 400 meters the 76MM HVAP round could penetrate the front armor of the Tiger. For Side and Rear shots the ranges went from 800 to 1000 meters respectively.

Although I have to critique the supposed stupidity of the Germans in the final act, up until that point I felt this movie portrayed tank combat and infantry combat very well. A life can be lost in an instant from an errant round. It's loud, it's terrible. The movie also very quickly dispels with any notions that Pitt's character is an eternally righteous savior; on the contrary he is shown early on as nothing of the sort. This is not a make believe hero.

There are scant few movies focusing around tank combat and this did a great job with it.

A far better watch than American Sniper or Lone Survivor, IMO, as both of those couldn't help themselves but embellishing in the extreme and painting unrealistic (and factually untrue) pictures of their protagonists.

Shia LeBeouf is a douche, he's just gone. They try to revive him by making him a ""preacher"" so to speak, in an attempt to make us like him once more.; which I believe could actually have been done, if he played Percy Jacksons character in this movie. I think that roll would have suited him more, to grow a better connection with that character. But with Percy Jackson playing it, I just thought he was a huge Vagina. Still with better editing, writing, he could have grown on us, but his journey was too fast forwarded(even for a 2+hour movie). His portrayal reminded me of the huge vagina in ""Saving Private Ryan"", the guy who refused to fight-- Upham, or some crap. I'm sorry, but this is trying to be a WWII movie for today's audience that's more about the violence, and blood, and the whole F*** YOU awesomeness that we would want out of it....so why try to put in this character. it doesn't fit with it. Granted with a little more of a journey for him with more hardships, it might have worked, but there wasn't and it didn't. Just like Upham, I found myself yelling at him to Man up and stop being such a bitch.",1421452800,,1272,4.371308016877637

6537760,2,B00M0GM4V0,"Another silly ""Americans Are the Bad Guys"" Hollywood movie. Story is thin, but the battle effects are frightening - as they should be, considering ""Saving Private Ryan"" was made 17 years ago, and was waaayyy more frightful - and had an engaging, factual story.

Rule #1 in the military is, ""Live to fight another day"". 5 guys hanging around in a disabled tank, with 300 Waffen SS coming down the road, is simply poor script writing.",1421193600,5,432,4.684210526315789
6537761,2,B00M0GM4V0,"I had great hopes for this film. I knew in advance how picky the film makers were being with the vehicles. My high expectations quickly turned to disappointment . The film almost immediately implied that the Americans were on their last legs struggling for men and equipment while the Germans fiercely contested every square inch of ground. First like alot of American films they can't help but work in the cheese which immeadiately undermines the film. Hilariously they made out in the beggining that the Allies were at some kind of military disadvantage. The truth is that by this stage of the war the Americans had an overwhelming number of men , weapons , aircraft ,tanks and supplies. Most German towns they entered had white sheets hanging out of the windows and the Germans were keen to surrender into the British and Americans so that they wouldn't fall into the hands of the Russians. Taking tanks into towns without infantry well in front would be akin to suicide; in reality Allied crews would send in recce troops and the Allies would often simply ring up the mayor of the next town and tell him that unless all civilians and soldiers surrenderd the town would be levelled at the slightest sign of resistance. If anti-tank guns were suspected the Allies would use their plentiful artillery and air support to plaster the area first and would then gingerly advance, rather than go charging in, as in the film. At the ranges depicted, the German anti-tank guns would not have missed, even with their first shots, and Allied tank crews would not have bunched as closely as in the film - this merely gave the enemy easy targets without the need to traverse very far. The 76mm gun on Brad's tank would easily penetrate the 102mm frontal hull armour out to about 1,000 yards using conventional APC rounds, let alone the more effective but rarer APCR, whereas Brad's projectiles are bouncing off at 500! Similarly, it would not have been necessary to hit the Tiger only in the rear, as the hull sides and rear were all 80mm thick, and to engage a Tiger Allied crews would come at it from different directions rather than bunch close together, thereby giving the Tiger crew problems from the fact that the turret took 60 seconds to traverse 360 degrees. All this of course makes for a less exciting film though...
 The charecters were so clich'ed it seemed as if you had seen them before. I started to lose heart when Brad Pitt forces a new crew member to shoot a prisoner to toughen him up. We then descend into an encounter between four Shermans and a Tiger 1 - vehicles 10 out of 10 , realism and tactics 3 out of 10. The final scene was crazy. We see what looks like a fresh fully equipped SS battalion on the march ( a very rare sight in May 1945 ! ) who sacrifice themselves by continually throwing themselves in front of a static Sherman tanks machine guns, running from left to right again and again over an open field, frontally assaulting a tank with blazing rifle fire (!). All the panzerfaust ant-tank weapons we see them carrying at the start  when they march singing (lol) to battle suddenly vaporise when confronted by the knocked out Sherman. Absolutely ridiculous. Such a shame , all that trouble to get real vehicles and accurate uniforms, all that potential wasted on unconvincing scenarios. Entertaining enough to watch if accuracy is not your thing .",1421193600,17,3375,4.670588235294118
6537762,4,B00M0GM4V0,"While it is true that Fury isn't breaking new ground in the War Genre, but it cannot be said that what it does do it does very well. Acting, cinematography and production design is impressive and Brad Pitt as with the rest of the cast does a lot with their war-weary, broken and ambiguous moral-compassed characters. You can tell that they were all once wide-eyed and had a basic good in them, but the brutality of the war has beaten and compromised them to the point where if they do remember what they were like then it is just a painful reminder. Logan Lerman does a very good job as being our entrance point to this world and their painful reminder, as well as being witness to the moral decay through his eyes. The setpiece in the middle of the film taking place in the German women's apartment is menacing and tense knockout. This is an extremely violent and bloody film, so definitely not one to watch with the kiddies.",1421193600,2,926,4.452941176470588

6537764,4,B00M0GM4V0,"After the loss of a member of their crew, Gordo, Boyd, Grady, and their leader Don (WarDaddy), get acquainted with a new member Norman Ellison. Set in the year 1945 in Germany, Fury begins a dramatized tale of war.

As Fury begins to unfold, actor Brad Pitt gives an incredibly earnest performance in his role as Sergeant Collier. He portrays the character as a person who has seen and done a great ordeal throughout the course of the war; thereby giving Fury a more gritty feel. Shia Labeouf plays the character Boyd, and does REALLY well providing Fury with some affectionate moments. Michael Pena stars as Gordo and I definitely had a blast watching him throughout Fury. Logan Lerman once again proves that he in fact has acting chops and shows as much in his role as Norman. I liked his character development; with Norman at first not believing in himself to realizing that he has it in him to fight in the war. And finally, there has to be a guy everyone loves to hate and Jon Bernthal's character Grady is indeed that guy. I have to say, he did do an exceptionally good job playing the role because there were instances I had to remind myself he's just acting. As a whole, the cast delivered in a really good way for the movie.

The story in Fury is fictionally based during World War II in Germany. There were a lot of things things in terms of story that I did like, but there were a FEW scenes that I feel needed more time to develop. And while there are a lot of explosions and tank/gun battles, Fury manages to have characters that you do care for, and the sound in the movie matches the intensity of Fury's action scenes very well. The story conveys occasional christian themes/scriptures which is also likable.

Fury is not a perfect movie in my opinion , but that does NOT mean you would not enjoy the movie. All that said, I still consider the movie Fury

A Good Experience

6537870,1,B00M0GM4V0,"I am a writer and researcher of military history. Thus, straight off I will say this movie is idiotic in its portrayal of World War II. As to anything representing tactics, forget it. You won't find anything resembling real warfare. All kinds of men were soldiers in WWII; there were even types like the characters in this movie. However, these characters are a million miles away from being a truthful representation of the American soldier in WWII or the spirit in which the soldiers fought and died. The American soldier, despite inadequate basic training to prepare him for the facts of war, became a great soldier overall. The German soldier, likewise, was a great soldier. As soldiers, neither the American or German soldier was a degraded individual. This movie, then, is not a depiction of soldiers overall but a few individuals who just happened to be soldiers. Don't waste your time on this movie. It is not realistic and men and woman who served and those who have given their lives don't deserve to be equated with the falseness of this movie. Even if you do not want realism in your war movies, avoid this movie as it is simply not well written or filmed to be interesting enough to waste one's time on--meaning its many flaws get in the way of it being entertaining. If the movie had been directed or labeled a satire, a farce or a black comedy, it might pass as a genuine attempt at delineating war and, therefore, worthy of some praise. There is in war many moments of satire, farce and black comedy. If you want to see a movie in which satire, farce and black comedy are used see ""How I Won The War with John Lennon,"" ""The Americanisation of Emily,"" or ""Dr. Strangelove."" The problem with ""Fury"" is it is not well-made enough to pass as satire, black comedy or farce-- or for that matter action or commentary on war in general. If you want to see a good war movie, there are many: The longest Day, Saving Private Ryan, and In Harms Way to name a few.",1420934400,19,1967,4.52808988764045

6537873,5,B00M0GM4V0,"This is a great war movie and I saw it twice when it was here.  I hope it will become a classic.  Like in the first world war, the US entered the War toward the end.  It was obvious to all except Hitler that the 20 mile armada of D-Day would bring the war to a quick end, actually in less than a year.  The focus of the film is on these last days and the action of a Sherman tank led by Brad Pitt and a crew of dynamic actors.  There are three things I noticed in this great film.

First, the introduction of a young clerk to join the crew.  This a common feature of many war pictures.  Ambrose Bierce wrote many classical stories of his war experiences.  He went into the military as a young man and became a capable killer. These experiences change young men and sometimes transforms them into the kind of killers Patton described in his speeches to troops.  Pitt had something of the Patton disciplining but it could be argued there was a kind of slapping incident when the boy failed to kill some Germans and other tank soldiers were killed.  Pitt gave him a hand gun and told the boy to shoot a German prisoner.  The boy cried and refused to kill the German but he later came around to killing Germans without hangups.

A second aspect of this movie is the presence of a brotherhood which among the fighting soldiers always takes the highest precedence.  The Remarque novels got the author kicked out of Germany when Hitler came to power and the books were banned.  The first book on the western front reveals the loyalty of the soldiers toward each other and the main hero returns to his platoon where constant care and concern for members reveals his strong attachment. This kind of attachment is a common or universal state among soldier groups.  Platoon on a smaller scale represented the situation during the Civil War which brings me to the third observation.

Patriotism probably is not as important as loyalty to those that fight along side you.  The draft was resisted by young Americans during the Vietnam War.  The troops were divided and sometimes fought each other as in Oliver Stone's movie, Platoon based on his experience as a soldier in Vietnam.  He may have used Chris as the naive young soldier who dropped out of college and asked for combat in the front lines.  Chris had a complaint, viz. why should the rich kids not serve in war?  The upshot of this situation was the creation of a volunteer army.  Of course, it is still the poor who mostly fight in these small or ""containment"" wars as Kennan called them.

In the last scenes of Fury, the Sherman tank was stopped by a mine and a battalion of 300 SS soldiers marched rapidly toward the tank.  Pitt tells his crew he will stay and fight them, that they can leave but everyone decides to stay.  They are all killed except for the boy who at this point is well on his way to meeting his commander's expectations.  The Director of Fury, Ayer researched the tank information and gave this movie all the attributes of a classic war movie.

This movie reminded me of Colonel Chamberlain of the 20th Maine in the movie Gettysburg where he told his soldiers that ""in the end what we are fighting for is ourselves.""",1420848000,3,3186,4.455958549222798

So for me, this movie was perfect for me.  Great acting.  Great cinematography.  Amazing Tank battles which really captures what a few tank battles may have been like in WWII (after all, the German tanks were A LOT faster, more armoured, more firepower, etc).

If you're into action, wwii or semi-historical movies this (imho) is a must own movie.  I say semi-historical, mainly, because it takes a full work force of people to assemble repro everything/anything wwii and keep everything time period accurate and consistent.  A much harder, yet rewarding job that is not often recognized for what it should be.  To my untrained, yet watchful, eye I did not see anything that was out of place for this time period.

Fury also did an excellent job of showing a glimpse of hell that war is.  The physiological and psychological toll WWII took on individuals with individual personalities (and how they outwardly showed it) was very well represented.",1420588800,4,1089,4.961325966850829

But this movie has a fair amount of gratuitous gore ; after it conveys how gory war is , it then goes over the top with it .

6538457,5,B00M0GM4V0,"I would give this movie 6 stars if I could.  I've seen it three times already.  When you watch, get ready to be punched in the gut.  A one of a kind movie that focuses on an American Sherman tank crew and their particular kind of war.  You spend a lot of time with the crew in the cramped quarters of the Sherman tank and you have to marvel that anyone who fought in them came home sane.

Every actor plays his character to perfection.  They all have a dark side and some are darker than others.  Brad Pitt is outstanding as ""Wardaddy"" and Shia LeBeouf as ""Bible"" should receive Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor nods respectively for their performances.  A half step behind them are Logan Lerman, Jon Bernthal and Michael Pena who round out a stellar main cast.  Two other memorable characters, German women, are just as good with Anamaria Marinca and Alicia von Rittberg also deserving of supporting actress nominations.

The battle sequences are unforgiving in their depiction of the horror of war and how ghastly, violently and suddenly death can come.  The encounter with four Sherman tanks against one Tiger tank is one of the best battle sequences ever filmed.  I don't think I took a breath during the entire battle.

This is not a flag waving, feel good movie but it is (in my estimation) an honest portrayal of war and is a tribute to our WWII veterans as well as any who have fought for our country.",1420502400,,1413,4.515748031496063

I could blabber on about the details of this stellar production--the accuracy, the mood, the effects, etc.  No need.  Fury pulls you into the lives of WW2 tank soldiers, and you will NOT notice that you are watching a movie until the credits roll--and you get to take a deep breadth.

Fury will have you on the edge of your seat till the VERY last scene.  It is full of surprises, excellent characters, and intense violence.  When I say intense, I mean eye-opening, jaw-dropping, gory violence that only stops when one side has won completely.  Lots of cringe-worthy moments that will have you appreciating our soldiers--WW2 heroes in particular.

This movie is both WAR and history brought to life for the civilian.  Terrifying and heart-wrenching.  Stay for the snippets of historic footage after the last scene.  This montage of war videos cements how horrifying an experience that war was.  Creepy.  It completes the movie with an unsettling mood.

6538464,4,B00M0GM4V0,"A well-told tale of an ignored part of WWII, the end from the allied soldiers' perspective.  Despite the arguments about tactics, etc., I believe ""Fury"" has to be viewed from the perspective of those who fought, not wanting to be the last man to die in a war already won.  Acting is good, but not superlative.  Story is very good, with a few nods to Hollywood heroic conventions.  On first viewing I thought of the movie as quite grim in tone, but revised this view after thinking about it.  It will certainly get a person to try to put himself into the shoes of American (and German) people stuck in a war that might have once seemed heroic, but now slogging toward a sloppy end.

6538478,3,B00M0GM4V0,"This movie is likely to generate lots of mixed reviews.  I think for good reason.  It does mesh well with first hand accounts of the brutality, and ugliness of war as told in countless documentaries, books, interviews, etc.  that I've read, watched, and listened to.  The acting for the most part is good.  The fear, rage, and sadness are palpable.  From a more technical perspective, seeing a real Tiger tank on film was very cool.  I've watched videos from the Bovington tank museum of this particular machine.  It's the only running example, to my knowledge.  Most of the equipment used in the film appeared correct for the period.  The Americans were outfitted with Garands, Thompsons, 1911's, ""grease guns"", and of course, Sherman tanks.  The Germans were equipped with K98's, P-38's, STG 44's, panzerfaust, MG42's, and even some PAK artillery guns.
  What struck me as unrealistic, or not beneficial for the movie? Something that stood out, was the portrayal of all of the German troops as incompetent.  The final scene looked like the ""Fury"" crew vs 200-300 soldiers from the (not so dreaded) SS ""Three Stooges"" division.  Quite a few times we see German troops (the ones that didn't run into machine gun fire head on) outflank the tank, and then not try to attack the crew.  We also see them crouching in front of the tank, and shooting it with small arms.  You don't have to be a soldier to know that they would have zero chance of penetrating the armor with anything but a Panzerfaust, or an anti-tank grenade, in the absence of artillery, or a tank of their own.  Also, like many war films, soldiers rarely used the sights on their weapons.  Nitpicking? Probably, but if you are going to get so many things right, why not go a little further to make it more realistic?  Finally, I may be in the minority on this, but the characters were hard for me to feel invested in.  When they expired one by one, the feeling was one of ""oh well"", and little else.  It might have been a completely accurate depiction of what the troops acted like during that period.  I don't know.  Maybe that's one of the many differences between ""being there"", and hearing about it so many years later. For those of us who haven't experienced war first hand, it's impossible to know exactly how people would react, think, and feel in such circumstances.
  I have spoken with a dozen or so WWII vets, and felt respect for them, and privileged to hear their stories face to face.  I wouldn't wish those experiences on anyone.",1420502400,7,2507,4.664383561643835

It just felt off.  Little things that just made me shake my head.  I went back and watched it again and the same items jumped out at me.  So in all fairness...here are the positives and negatives

Positive
1.  The settings are amazing, the feeling is just what I would think of WWII Europe right before the end.  From the mud and roads to buildings and fields.  Awesome scenery and set work.
2.  The acting was top notch.  All the actors did a great job.  Easy Oscar performances from all involved.
3.  The tanks!  From the interior and exterior, it was wonderful to see such detail.  The tanks were as much a performer as the actors.
4.  The Tiger Tank -  I understand this is the only one in operating condition.  It was great to see it.
5.  Did I say the tanks?  Yes, my favorite part of the movie.

Negative
1.  The tracers were all wrong.  They looked like light sabers not real tracers.  Special effects needed to dial those down a notch or two.  Bugged me all the way through the movie.
2.  The kitchen scene - I understand what was being illustrated but it just didn't work well for me.  Right off Emma's dress was all wrong.  Even my husband picked up on that.  It just did not fit into the time period or the scene.
3..  The final scene - just not quite right.  The idea that a SS battalion would act so green, even if it was filled with green troops was a bit off.  They were carrying plenty of anti-tank ammo and it would have been a breeze to take out a lone disabled tank without even opening the turret.  Why didn't the boys get all their ammo inside?  The front MG should have at least had a red barrel after going through a whole can of ammo.  It just didn't set right.  Which is why I am a bit disappointed.  So close yet...........not quite there.  A few details shy of being utterly awesome.

I really do recommend the movie highly.  My husband noticed a few things, like the dress and the infantry formations but it did not bug him like it did me.  Definitely not a light hearted movie but one not to miss.

The movie seems pretty realistic and true to history and not overly sensationalized.  Little things like the lack of sleep, a flash with 'humanity' during a scene with two German women, running out of ammo at critical junctures --- all added to the realism.  My bottom line is if you like WWII movies, appreciate realism and want to get a feel for what it would be like to be in a tank and the strategies needed to outsmart and out flank a German Tiger tank (much more powerful gun), this will fit the bill.",1420416000,,676,4.333333333333333
6538753,3,B00M0GM4V0,"This movie got a lot of press when it first opened but I was unable to see it in the theaters and had to wait for the video release. I was glad that I did not pay for theater tickets. The plot was the old, very worn out story of the new guy joining an experienced team and finally coming of age and acceptance by the end of the movie. And some scenes were not realistic. For example, I very much doubt that a senior NCO would force a soldier to execute a prisoner, especially with several witnesses around. Also, the final scene was way over the top. No experienced soldier would assault the tank they way they did. They would encircle it or bypass it.

Finally, the star of the movie was the tank. But it wasn't a Sherman. It was a Pershing M26. It was possible that they were in a Pershing at that time in the war but not very likely. The first ones were delivered in February 1945 and only 20 saw combat.",1420416000,,907,4.124293785310734

The characters were not likeable and portraying WWII soldiers as vicious killers and rapists seemed extreme.  This is just a action flick for today's audiences.

If you want to see proper tactics and strategy incorporated correctly using armor and infantry during WWII there are better movies around but for the sheer pleasure of being entertained by good acting and compelling action this movie fits the bill.

Like most war movies I think it's almost impossible to accurately tell a whole story of this scale in a little over 2 hours...to follow a single tank on it's missions would be mostly boring so I would like to think that Fury was a compilation of the experiences many tank crews went through during the war....many veterans of that war have recounted their stories in books and documentaries and some are hard to fathom the actual experiences but they happened. In any case the movie is well worth watching.

 As for all the negative reviews by what appears to be very sensitive types with delicate notions of the laws of war and guilt over past history and who apparently have very little experience in actual combat situations miss the point of the movie showing the depths to which human beings can actually fall....on both sides. ""....history is violent..."" sums up the actions taken by soldiers in conflict. References to Wounded Knee makes no sense and trying to bring up Abu Grahib is laughable at best...making terror prisoners wear underwear on their heads and leading them around with dog collars is hardly comparable to close quarters combat in war!",1420243200,2,1514,4.8604651162790695

6539065,5,B00M0GM4V0,"One of the most intense war movies in a long time.  I studied World War II as a hobby for many years and the truth about our tanks forces is the exception rather than the rule.  We made up in quantity what would couldn't do in quality.  In reality, the life expectancy  in a tank crew wasn't very high.  This movie has some very, almost frightening, scenes in it that really tell how tough it was to be in a tank crew.

The characters are nicely developed without over doing anything.  You see each of them as individuals as well as a team.

Moving through Germany they encounter things that may or may not be part of the plan but their commander, played well by Brad Pitt, gets them through.

The final battle scene is one that props up the American, never say die, attitude and makes the movie worth watching to the end.

I enjoyed this movie so much it was one of the rare pre-orders (From Amazon of course) that I have made.  With over 750 movies we don't have a problem ordering movies for our home system but pre-ordering doesn't make a lot of sense.  Unless it's a movie like Fury.",1420243200,3,1088,4.279411764705882

6539167,5,B00M0GM4V0,"Probably the best war movie since Saving Private Ryan, and perhaps even better than its predecessor...similar themes of a young rookie scared of fighting and killing are explored in both movies. In Saving Private Ryan, the translator is afraid to take ammo to his friend and watches him get killed but in the end shoots the German in cold blood...which is a typical and simple resolution to the question of fear and bravery. Fury resolves with a bit more humour...and honesty. I think the action scenes in both movies are both astonishingly realistic, but Saving Private Ryan shows much more eviscerated gore. I guess Saving Private Ryan is a much more sentimental and silly, and Fury is more emotionally controlled as a movie, providing  more distance and freedom how to feel about the mindless deaths of so many innocent people in WW2.",1420156800,,837,4.894366197183099

I won't go into the fine details if you haven't seen the movie but needless to say that tossing two grenades into a closed tank's not going to leave much that's recognizable, but seeing as how Brad Pitts the star and co-producer I suppose he stipulated that the effects of the grenades would be muted.  There are many other examples of silliness in the film and I wonder how good it would have been if the writer had actually researched his topic.  I leave it to you to disagree but I can say emphatically that the idea of fixing a tank that has a blown apart front drive socket is ridiculous.

And moreover few of the German actors had any significant dialogue. The tank gunner spoke like he had marbles in his mouth, and pretty much BP did all the talking, even in German. That's my main gripe with this movie. Look to the fight with the Tiger tank to understand what I mean. Hearing the German soldier's orders spoken over the tank maneuvers just looks like amateur film making. The same thing later on in the last fight; another voice without a body to speak the words.  Also, the premise of putting a clerk in a tank is just dumb. If I heard correctly, BP directed this one, so I wish himwell on the next one. His character in ""The Counselor"" was quite interesting and it was good to see him expand his work.",1420070400,,861,4.341614906832298

We found this one glad we did it was the perfect one. I'm not old enough to remember WW II but I was born at the start I do remember listening to my Uncles tell about it, a lot they wouldn't talk about. I've read on here that it wasn't researched so they gave it one star. It was a war movie not a documentary so who cares, the point I'm trying to make is what happen to that tank crew I'm sure could have, my Uncles talked about some of the crazy things they did to stay alive and each man had his own way to make it through. There was a lot of money pumped into it,it's  not a B movie. We had pea shooting tin cans compered to the German's, a lot of our guys were killed in them because our tanks were easy to make they sent enough to out number the Germans ten to one not caring they were coffins.

6539522,1,B00M0GM4V0,"Wow, what a horrible movie! Completely unrealistic in action and in behavior. Yet another piece of Hollywood nonsense. Just to touch on a couple of things (out of many)- the Germans were depicted as insane and incompetent. They could have been replaced with video game zombies that's how unrealistic this movie treated their existence. The behavior and age (far too old) of the Americans was absurd; the script being far more appropriate for a group of Jersey 'Goombahs' than 1945 males. The music and camera work was way over the top as well, trying really REALLY hard to imitate something ""epic"" rather than the slop this is.

The one positive thing about this movie is that it's so bad it's actually friggin funny! Once we realized we we're watching crap pretending to be great it was hysterical!",1420070400,14,799,4.8321167883211675
6539523,1,B00M0GM4V0,"I stopped watching after the execution of a German prisoner of war is depicted. To those of you who never wore a uniform, (and why is that, by the way?), the execution of prisoners of war might seem to you (raised on video games and idiotic action movies) to be normal wartime behavior. It is not. We don't do that. Where and when such an action takes place, it is a violation of law. It is NOT the way the U.S. Army fights. There were some other issues with the movie up to that incident, (a complete misunderstanding of how infantry fight, for instance), but I am just sick and tired of watching the mindless garbage put out by airheads in Hollywood and the depiction of killing an EPOW as if it is business as usual just makes me want to kick the television in. I don't think the moron who wrote the screenplay intended it to be a slight against real Soldiers, but it has the same effect nonetheless. This movie is a steaming, worthless pile.",1419984000,16,945,4.344632768361582

6539534,1,B00M0GM4V0,"There is a scene early on where the newbe,Norman has to clean the melted face off the inside of the tank, apparently, the crew had been driving around for days with this mess, not to mention a mutilated body inside a very small and confined space-Go figure. But I digress, after the clean up, he drops outside on his knees and vomits on the ground which kind of sums up my feelings on this movie.

To be fair though, I have read my fair share of WW2 history, along with documentaries, actual film footage etc and am surprised to find:
1. Tracers be damned, they had star wars era blasters.
2. The Germans were not only incompetent losers, but extremely bad shots.
3. That a Sherman (They were referred to as Ronsons by the Brits) take multiple shots from a German Tiger, not to mention a few crates of Panzerfaust hits and still survive.
4. That a Nazi SS trooper could be far more humane than our guys.
5. That Lena Dunam did war movies- just kidding on this one, but not much of a stretch.

After watching this film, anyone not knowing better would have thought the wrong side won the war.",1419984000,25,1091,4.369458128078818
6539535,5,B00M0GM4V0,"If you want to understand combat culture and the reason why combat veterans act the way they do, watch this movie. Although it's set in WWII, very little has changed in the way war affects the human psyche from that war to the conflicts today in Iraq and Afghanistan. To date, this is the fullest, most crystalline l explanation I have seen of how living in a combat environment changes people, and this film could be an useful bridge for civilians and vets to cross the divide between their collective experiences. If you're looking for a feel-good story where the bad guys lose and the good guys go on to live happily ever after, this isn't it. War is hell, and the director makes no effort to sugar coat the more gory aspects of life on the battle field, including a guy whose face is literally blown off and another who puts a bullet in his own skull, and those are some of the more tame details.",1419984000,,900,4.395209580838324
6539536,5,B00M0GM4V0,Absolutely incredible! I loved this film through and through. The acting is top notch. The actors stay in character and their stories and personalities are very believable. The best film of 2014.,1419897600,,195,5.125
6539537,4,B00M0GM4V0,"Certainly worth your time. In particular the battle scenes are very, very well done. You haven't seen a tank explode until you see it here. You are sweating and bleeding inside the tank with Brad Pitt and his crew. Particular credit to the sound design and music. The music adds interesting textures in an unconventional way. I wish I'd seen this in the theatre.

Secondly, the story telling is pretty realistic and sticks to the facts: for example the German Tiger 1 tank was far superior to the Allied Shermans and the way Pitt's crew finally take one out is clever and realistic. Also the acknowledgment of the crew that the Brits and Canadians were also fighting is unusual in an American war movie. Also the story clearly differentiates the regular German army from the fanatical S.S.

My only complaint is a long sequence in the second act where they meet some local German women, give them eggs, and talk about shooting horses. It  feels long and contrived and too Spielbergian, but that is a matter of taste. I also didn't like Norman, the innocent ""Candide"" who is the focus of much of the story. He was not sympathetic, I kept hoping he'd be killed, and the sooner the better. Other viewers may be fine with him.

Brad Pitt, however, is excellent, and obviously deeply committed to the role. A gruesome and bloody movie, not suitable for date night, but a solid 4 stars.",1419897600,,1380,4.64344262295082

6539753,4,B00M0GM4V0,"As an action movie, it was very good. As history, not so much. Soldiers did not act this way in World War II. It was a different time. The movie was sort of a what would it have been like if World War II had happened today. Watching movies, one needs to suspend disbelief. Jon Bernthal's character was just a carryover from his character on the Walking Dead. Chances are, had he acted like that in World War II, he would have been arrested and court martialed of simply shot. Michael Pea's character did not exist back them, but we do need to be politically correct these days. If we remade Robin Hood today, there would have to be at least one black and one Hispanic among the Merry Men, you know. Alicia von Rittberg (Emma) was sweet, but she would not have willingly gone into the bedroom with any soldier, not matter how collegiate he might seem. The implication was there that they had sex, when Logan Lerman put his jacket back on coming out of the bedroom. Beyond all else, he was probably dirty and smelly from having been in the tank for so long. (he may have been dirty and smelly from having been on the set too long) And wouldn't a pretty girl like Emma have had a boyfriend? Interesting how when she was in the rubble, no one bothered to check for a pulse. Shia LaBeouf barely had any lines. I guess he was hired in the hopes that kids would go see it hoping that the tank would turn into a transformer. It's an interesting watch, the only boring part being the opening scene. Gravity had many plot holes, too, but it remains entertaining. It's fiction, created by a people who weren't even born (some of whose parents weren't even born) when it happened. It's not meant to be a history lesson. How accurate are John Wayne movies? If you want history, read books (hardly anyone does that anymore).",1418256000,3,1810,4.405970149253731
6539754,3,B00M0GM4V0,"If you haven't figured out who will live, who will die, and correctly predicted the order in which the doomed members of the cast will expire after the first twenty minutes, you haven't seen enough WWII films. 'Fury' is a strange beast, loping back and forth between cleverly crafted moments of shocking violence, and scenes that are thoroughly tired and utterly predictable. Still, I liked this film... parts of it. I'm an expert on World War II -- unless you need specific information about battles, strategies, tactics, borders, dates, weaponry, commanding officers, vehicles, aircraft, or who actually won (although I'm pretty sure Peter the Great's victory over Napoleon IV at the naval engagement of Cannae decided the outcome) -- and some of the scenes in 'Fury' have an authenticity to them reminiscent of 'Saving Private Ryan', a film it borrows from heavily. The raw depictions of battle in 'SPR' revolutionized the way violence is choreographed in cinema, and not just in films about war -- another example would be the excellent SF-thriller 'Edge of Tomorrow', which imagines an excruciatingly chaotic future battlefield that is indebted heavily to Spielberg's brilliant recreation of the landing on Omaha beach... those 30 minutes were responsible for giving viewers a new understanding of the horror of combat. 'Fury' is another exploration of the hell on earth that WWII made of the most beautiful and ancient European cities*. The evolution of weaponry unleashed a new level of murder and suffering, and director David Ayers reminds us of the futility and insanity behind such misery. The human toll is staggering. How many future scientists, writers, artists and musicians were fed into the meatgrinders of battle or the gas chambers of the death-camps? The cinematography is used to good effect, conveying the physical and moral weariness that hung over Europe like a fog. Everything is a washed out grey or brown, caked in mud and grease and dried blood. The skies are perpetually overcast, and every soldier has a haggard, hollow-eyed stare; the actors, sets and colors speak of pervasive exhaustion. The end is nigh, and no one wants to be one of the unlucky bunch to get killed just as Germany finally concedes defeat.

Brad Pitt resurrects a chastened Aldo Raine for his role as Staff Sergeant Don 'Wardaddy' Collier, commander of the 'Fury' and its crew, a Sherman tank that has seen action on two continents and survived the increasingly fierce resistance on the road to Berlin. When their tight-knit family unit is finally broken by the loss of their second driver and bow-gunner, they get the standard-issue farm-fresh replacement in Norman Ellison. He is -- of course -- a typist, and fulfills the same narrative function that the Upham character did in 'Saving Private Ryan'. He is the viewer's entry-point to the story, and like the rookie cop, allows the other characters to make explanations that would otherwise be difficult.

If being inside the heavy metal belly of a tank seems like a good way to ride out a world war, 'Fury' will quickly convince you otherwise. The German Panzerfauste and Panzershrecke, handheld infantry-issued tankbusters (based on reverse-engineered examples of the innovative American bazooka, brought back to Germany after their effectiveness was proven in the North African campaign), turned the protective steel womb of a Sherman or Russian T-34 into a hellish oven of flame and ricocheting shrapnel. And the American tanks were far inferior to the German Panzers, but the Tigers and dreaded King Tigers, though thankfully rare, were nearly invincible; they could destroy Sherman after Sherman with impunity, since their armor couldn't be pierced by the American tank's gun. By the time the US realized how outmatched their machines were, it was too late. They were forced to rely on their superior numbers, and hope that old-fashioned American ingenuity would make the difference, along with heavy artillery and their control of the skies -- the Luftwaffe had been crippled, thanks largely to the Brits. The disparity between the Tiger and the Sherman makes for one of 'Fury's most thrilling scenes... there can be few things more spirit-crushing for a Sherman crew than watching your rounds hit the bullseye on a Tiger, over and over, only to watch it emerge from the smoke unscathed.

While I liked seeing a film that focused entirely on tank warfare, the story isn't particularly original, and you've met all the characters in 'Fury' before. Do I have to tell you that the grizzled Staff Sergeant who started killing Nazi's in North Africa is forced to take command of a patchwork tank company? That they're sent out on a dangerous assignment in order to blah blah hold the position blah blah supply route blah blah completely cut off? Does it sound like I hate this movie even though there's four-stars hanging over my review? Well I don't. It's an excellent movie in many ways, and there is plenty to recommend it for anyone who loves realistic depictions of war; but it also demands that the viewer has forgiveness in their heart for a film that has a chance at greatness, but squanders it in the end. The good parts are really good, but the bad parts are very bad; producer interference may have been a part of the problem, or it was simply a bad script to begin with. The bottom line is that 'Fury' doesn't belong in the same class as 'Platoon', 'Apocalypse Now', 'Letters From Iwo Jima', or my personal favorites, the HBO series 'Band of Brothers' and 'The Pacific'... There is a very grim and compelling fog hanging over the first half of the story, but things suddenly get sappy, clichd and predictable. The shift is jarring at times, and sad.

Pitt is memorable as 'War Daddy', Jon Bernthal makes a convincingly beat-up redneck, and Shia Laboeuf really... has a mustache. Logan Lerman plays Private Ellison with the appropriate level of weepiness and idealism; Michael Pena rounds out the crew, and does a solid job of looking shell-shocked. I'm sorry if my ambivalence is confusing, but that's what war does to people. After a largely excellent hour and a half, tainted by disappointing moments, followed by an obligatory 'Medal of Honor' finale, I feel conflicted and a bit shell-shocked myself... my hair's too tight and my pockets hurt. If you can look past its faults, 'Fury' is well worth checking out. If not, you might want to wait and see if a 'Director's Cut' turns up. War really is hell. [68/100]

6539757,3,B00M0GM4V0,"Im a bit perplexed as to why FURY didn't leave me very moved at the end.  Its got the intensity, gore & grit of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.  It certainly seems to show our WWII soldiers at their best and their worst.  Some of the action scenes are extremely well done.  It even LOOKS like RYAN many times.  Yet in the end, I found it to be a tense and exciting film, but one that didn't have a huge emotional impact.

In case you don't know, FURY is the story of an American tank crew in the waning days of WWII.  This rag-tag gang has been together for much of the war, but are joined by a new soldier, who is not only new to their crew but brand-new to combat.  He gets a quick introduction to the horrors of war and is slowly turned from a nave, non-violent kid to a gung-ho fighter, not hesitant to kill.  The movie is saying something about not just the horrors of war, but how war changes us into less than ideal versions of ourselves.  There are several extremely loud, tense combat scenes, including a very extended final battle.

The crew is led by Brad Pitt, a wise soldier and leader with many scars and a merciless attitude.  He takes the new kid (Logan Lerman) under his wing, but his wing is not a calm, serene place.  He forces the kid to kill when killing isn't strictly needed and he basically wears him down to the point where fighting and killing become second nature to him.  The crew also has the slightly crazy, slightly religious Shia LaBeouf, the wise-cracking Michael Pena and the dangerously simple-minded Jon Bernthal.  Each actor gives an intense performancetheyre all dirty all the time, lots of sweat and plenty of tough-sounding bad language and crude jokes.

And therein lies my problem.  The movie HAS the realism and grit of the far, far superior RYAN.  It makes full use of sound.  It puts you effectively inside the tank.  But take out the foul language and the modern day grit, and you're left with a deeply clichd war movie.  Stock characters.  Predictable scenes of male bonding.  American bravery overcoming tremendous odds.  Its vaguely old-fashioned in all the worst ways.  It WANTS to say war is hellbut that message in and of itself no longer resonates.  We know that going in to the film.  It really just doesnt have anything new to say.  So in the end, it mostly feels like an ACTION movie that takes place during a war rather than a profound WAR movie with great action scenes that propel or drive the themes of the movie.

There is one noteworthy exception.  Just past the mid-way point of the film, there is some downtime.  The crew has taken over a small German village and some of the men come across a couple of women hiding in their apartment.  I don't want to spoil much about the scene, but those ten minutes of the film end up being far more tense than almost any of the combat stuff.  There is humor, pathos, tension, violence, romance and the best and worst of mankind all rolled into this scene.  It straddles a line wherein some of the Americans are almost made into villains.  I liked it very much.  (Although, I was a bit uncomfortable with a couple of American soldiers being presented in a not very nice lightbut I have to accept that not everyone behaves admirably 100% of the time, especially in wartime.)

FURY is by no means a bad film.  I recommend it (though not for the squeamish), but I believe it falls well short of the mark it was trying for.  3.5 stars.",1417737600,7,3422,4.440514469453376

6539783,3,B00M0GM4V0,"I'm not sure what to say when it comes to David Ayer's latest film ""Fury"". It's a movie that rides a fine line between mediocre and good. There were moments when I realized how great this film could have been, but those split-seconds were sparse. It's not as if it's particularly unpleasant, It's just not anything new, and none of the characters stuck out to me.

The plot is pretty commonplace, set in the heart of World War Two. We follow Brad Pitt's character, a battered sergeant nick-named `Wardaddy', who has his hands full commanding his five-man crew in their cramped tank. Dealing with the harsh realities of war and a new man aboard, a young soldier who hasn't been properly trained, they're forced to fight outnumbered and outgunned.

The movie is exactly what you might expect and that's probably why I didn't enjoy it. I was able to predict every move, all the way down to each character's arc, and it wasn't an original experience in any way. It felt as if they went down the list of every great war film collecting each trope they could and threw them in as needed.

The most redeeming aspect is the cinematography (which I found to be Oscar-worthy) but the other aspects can't match its greatness. The acting is fine, with Brad Pitt and Shia LaBeouf bringing the most to the table, but as a whole it's pretty substandard. If you're a fan of the genre you'll probably like this, but I'd recommend skipping it and revisiting classics like ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" or ""Patton"".",1417219200,3,1497,4.620300751879699

6539822,2,B00M0GM4V0,"I had great expectations for this film but I was let down. I have read a lot about World War II and I have seen innumerable documentaries and another films on the subject. After watching ""Fury"" I can say that there were only two episodes that really impressed me and were VERY realistic: the battle of four Sherman tanks with a single German Tiger tank which resulted in the nearly total annihilation of the American armor but also in a triumph of tactics over material quality, and the few moments of personal contact that the ""Fury"" crew had with two German women in their home. The other scenes were nothing more than ordinary, a boring repetition of well known war situations, but in some cases unrealistic and childish. Especially the last climactic fight was not believable because there was not a single chance that an immobilized tank could withstand for hours the onslaught of a multitude of SS infantrymen who were armed with the deadly Panzerfaust antitank rocket launchers. The enemy could blow the Sherman tank to pieces even with a few shots from close distance, and certainly such experienced and tough troops as the SS would never attack in such a silly way as pictured in the film. When the Soviets made their final dash for Berlin they lost no fewer than 800 tanks to the German handheld antitank weapons like the Panzerfaust - and they certainly were no novices to brutal close quarter battles. Also, the scene where ""Wardaddy"" forces a member of his crew to execute an unarmed POW is a shame for the director who portrays the US soldiers as cold blooded butchers. The same war crime was included and even glorified in an atrocious scene of the ""Inglorius Basterds"" and I hope that all people with dignity and humanity will not tolerate such brutal and hideous scenes becoming the norm in the Hollywood film industry.",1416700800,10,1836,4.740625

6539825,5,B00M0GM4V0,"I went to the sneak preview of Fury starring Brad Pitt (Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier) & his tank crew Shia LaBeouf (Boyd 'Bible' Swan) Michael Pe&ntilde;a, & Jon Bernthal serving in the 2nd Armored Division during the end of WWII, when the Armored Divisions were pushing into the enemy-held territories in Germany. My father served in the 10th Armored Division and was also behind enemy lines in Germany toward the end of WWII.  Harrowing experiences for American GIs, particularly when they came up against a Tiger tank, which was superior to U.S. Sherman tanks.

I was half out of my seat for most of this movie and cannot imagine the raw courage it took to man one of these tanks. The toll it took on these crews was enormous and I found the characters' personalities rang true in that some had to shut down emotionally to survive while others found solace and strength in religious belief. These callous and war-seasoned GI's were a stark contrast to the new recruit Logan Lerman (Norman Ellison) who felt every prick of conscience and froze in fear & horror. Clint Eastwood's son, Scott, makes an appearance as Sergeant Miles.

I found the scene with the two women very authentic to war. Men driven to the brink of insanity in war are known to commit deeds that would not otherwise occur (e.g., Japan forced sex slavery in WWII). Likewise, the women in the film wished to benefit (in goods) & this was not uncommon either (e.g., French women heads shaved for collaborating with Germans in WWII). While it may be discomfiting to watch this scene, it has been a part of war forever.

I put this movie on par with Saving Private Ryan minus the personal reflections of each character. While the movie presents the war without the the personal details and background of each main character of Saving Private Ryan, it was necessary to keep the movie less than 3.5 hours. This movie is a gut-wrenching experience replete with the tension & claustrophobia reminiscent of Das Boot and in keeping with what my Dad shared with me about how it felt to be inside one of those metal coffins.

Graphic, confronting, revolting, and touching all at the same time, Fury shows the worst and the best of the people thrust unwillingly into war.

I was held in its hypnotic grip for nearly all of its 134 minutes and couldn't help but note the meticulous and gorgeously grim photography, the pitch perfect performances by Brad Pitt and the rest of the cast( you can tell its based on a true story from its truly organic characterizations) and compare it to another immersive World War II film: Saving Private Ryan.
Both motion pictures have a grand scope but focus on intimate character relations in the same violent backdrop. They are both competently directed with a real sense of brooding danger and culminating intensity throughout but the difference here is that the ending seems to safe and predictable where Saving Private Ryan held its bleak vision throughout.
Still there is no denying that certain images will linger with you long after you leave the cinema and though it is not a full fledged masterpiece it is an experience, a film that may lose some of its impact if not viewed in theaters and one of the best films of the year.

Over the years I met former German panzer, infanterie and sturmgeschutz commanders discussing their view of the war.

The experiences retold in personal memoirs and in unit histories from the 2d, 3d, 6th, 7th, 10th, 11th, 12th and 14th Armored Divisions are close or worse than that depicted in Fury. Most of these books are available in libraries or in print. Almost everyday in April 1945, American units fought short vicious battles with Nazi diehards. The ability of American armor to outmaneuver German Panthers and Tigers was often restricted by terrain and German panzer commanders usually chose their ground well.  The experience of 10th AD outside Crailsheim and 3rd AD driving from Northeim to Dessau in April 1945 was similar to scenes in the movie.  Those who think that the SS in April 1945 was still a superior combat force are wrong.  As the SS expanded after 1942 conscription was the only way to fill the increased manpower requirements and offset the enormous casualties. At the end of the war SS officers testified that more than 50% of the SS were conscripted and ideological fervor had already declined even before this dilution.  In April 1945, many of the remaining Waffen SS units on the Western Front were a hodge podge of poorly-trained, press-ganged troops driven by veteran cadres that demonstrated a willingness to fight but little tactical skill. The weakness of the movie is the lack of an overall story and seemingly awkward scenes but if you talk to veterans about their experiences they often will describe events without any continuity while highlighting those experiences that stood out. Combat creates odd situations and when combat exhaustion sets in they can be unbelievable. This movie needs a prequel.",1415750400,30,2245,5.076086956521739

6539831,5,B00M0GM4V0,"You want to know what it feels like to be a tanker in a war then this is the movie for you. I was a tanker for 12 years in the U.S. Army and fought in Desert Storm as a M1A1 tank platoon leader and even though this movie was set during WWII, I felt as if it wastaking me back in time to Iraq. My crew was just like Fury's crew. My driver was from Pennsylvania and loved to drink and acted like the Fury driver. My loader was just as filthy as the loader on Fury and my gunner, although not religious was more mature and the ""goody two shoes"" of the crew. During Desert Storm my loader stepped on a landmine and was evacuated and we got a fresh face recruit straight out of Ft Knox who thought he was going to sit out the war in an easy job. I remember my crew questioning him just like the Fury crew did to Norman. I remember how this new guy thought war was just an exciting vacation until I had to lay the smack down on him. My wingman shot an Iraqi tank that had just shot an American Bradley Infantry vehicle and the Iraqi tank commander was trying to escape, but got caught when his fuel and ammo exploded. He was burning and my new loader wanted to run to his tank and help him and I wouldn't let him. I told him to let the guy burn and made him watch as the Iraqi shook and burned too death on top of his turret. After that my new loader kept to himself and did his job instead of trying to take pictures of everything thinking it was cool. You have to be hard as a tank commander because your job is to kill the enemy and keep your crew alive. Pitt portrays how a tank commander is perfectly. A tank is nasty on the inside and out during battle and it is our home and you we treat it as such. The banter between the crew is spot on also. We talk about any and everything and there is no political correctness among us.

The visual effects are just as stunning as well as the tactics. The tracers flying toward the screen made me flinch because it reminded me of my own experiences. When the Tiger tank appeared Fury and the other tanks turned their front armor to it like you are supposed to do because your front armor is your strongest and it presents the smallest profile to the enemy. When Fury ran over that mine it made me relive the experience when my own tank ran over a mine during the second day of the ground war.

If you have never served in a tank, this movie may seem like a grand adventure, but if you were a tanker like me it makes you relive the ""best job you ever had.""",1415664000,30,2495,4.008032128514056
6539902,3,B00M0GM4V0,"Superheroes do not exist. There are no men with heat ray eyes; no women that can control the weather; no webslingers or mutants. All are a part of a universe that can never exist in reality.

But heroes do.

The strength of the human spirit, both mental and physical, can be remarkable, even limitless, and war is often the best example of such instances, both humane and inhumane. The films that pay tribute to fallen soldiers and innocents give the general public only a mere glimpse into the limitless dark void of hell.

Whether its delving into the darkest recesses of the human mind and witnessing the equally traumatizing results (Schindlers List, Night and Fog), or showcasing the durability of courageousness and selflessness (Paths of Glory), cinema has tried its hardest to replicate the horrific consequences of greed and pride. Fury is one film that does just that, but stops short of the finish line.

One would not expect a serious dark, gritty war film from David Ayer, the man behind End of Watch and Street Kings, but the end result is a surprisingly competent and well-produced WWII feature. Starring Brad Pitt and Shia Labeouf no less.

Fury, like most films of its kind, has its share of war tropes, stereotypes and cliches. The few against many theme, the display of human loss, exaggerated stereotypes, melodramatic speeches; its all here.

Yet it knows how to hold itself back with subtlety and class for the most part. It throws effective scenes of violence and brutality without feeling tasteless; dramatic sequences are potent and not drawn-out to be preachy or awkward.

Everything here works to a high degree of quality. Solid performances, exceptional and intense action sequences that catch the viewer off guard; its what is needed in a war film, much less any action film.

However, the one thing that holds it back from being truly great, is the absence of backstory for the main characters. All the information that is given is that Wardaddy fought in Africa, the new recruit was an office clerk back home, and the others consist of a mexican, a southern preacher, and a redneck hillbilly.

It isn't known if some of them have loved ones or business opportunities waiting for them. All of that is left to the imagination.

Its a shame and a pity that Fury hits all the right marks except for the one that matters most. If that were not the case, it couldve been the best WWII film in years. But as it is now, its merely an exceptional film that is well worth seeing.

In terms of audience immersion, ""Fury"" does for mechanized combat what ""Saving Private Ryan"" did for dismounted (infantry) warfare - having participated in both myself, I can say honestly that this is about as close as you'll get to the sights, sounds and emotions (but not the smells, of course), that one experiences when you're engaged in the up-close-and-personal side of war.

It also offers ttremendous insight into the lives of ""Tankers"" - at least about the best you could do with a couple of hours and a dark theater.

Yes, there's a dose or two of melodrama, but by-and-large, the portrayals and the writing/directing behind them did justice to the underlying truth.

6539905,3,B00M0GM4V0,"Ill be the first to admit that Im not the target audience for a film like Fury.  I just have a really hard time connecting to war films.  Ive seen many over the years and yet the only one that I can think of off the top of my head that has really made a real impact on me was The Thin Red Line.  Ive seen and enjoyed many films about war and the effects of war, but those really aren't war films, are they?  The Cranes are Flying is a superb film, but it isn't about the actual warfare.  Anyways, my point is that I walked into Fury kind of aware of the fact that I probably wasn't going to love it.  That being said, Im always open to having my mind changed, and so I was prepared to give it its due attention and decide for myself.

My initial reaction was, this is dumb and while my opinion of the film has warmed (ever so slightly) since leaving the theater, I must admit that I still don't really care much for this movie.

Fury tells the story of a five person crew manning a tank behind enemy lines during World War II.  The crew is led by a seeming emotionless Wardaddy and contains a hodgepodge of personalities.  Theres the religious man, the slovenly creep, Mr. confidence and the greenhorn.

Thats all I got.

Seriously, the main issue I have with Fury is that there is no story.  The film just kind of sits there, with the only progression being the obvious plot points of oh no, a German and a few random scenes spliced in to try and show some sort of human interaction.  The film rests solely on the ability to convey a sense of comradery between these men, and yet it never really does that, which makes the whole film feel rather pointless.  I never felt like these men were remotely close to one another, despite all of their ranting and raving about how much they loved Wardaddy and how loyal they were, and even with the pitiful climax of unified suicide, the film tells us something we never truly feel.  Watching these men choke on clichd and amateurish dialog made me cringe in parts (many parts).  A lot of this detached feeling has to do with the fact that only two of these characters ever really feel fleshed out, and that would be Boyd, our bible thumper, and Norman, our greenhorn.  Both Shia LaBeouf and Logan Lerman handle their characters with real grit and honesty, but they aren't enough to make the film feel unified.  The character of Grody is just hard to stomach, the character of Trini is just not there (like, Pena is such a good actor and yet his character could have just stopped showing up in scenes and I wouldnt have noticed) and Wardaddy is such an enigma of a character and Pitts performance is so stone-like that he just becomes a poorly portrayed symbol, a prop and not a real character.

Fury has some moments, or I should say it has a moment, when Wardaddy and Norman encounter two German women and attempt to play house, but the moment is sullied by the uncomfortable entrance of the remaining crew.  This is a scene that, on its own, says so much, and yet the films remaining preposterous depiction of the relationships between these men make the scene ring false.

And don't even get me started on the atrocious action scenes that purposefully make the bullets and bombs look like laser beams.  This isn't Star Wars people, and the gritty realism you were trying to achieve is lost entirely in your attempt to make your war scenes look cool.

Wow, and I thought on the outset that time had softened me towards this film, but writing this review has just reminded me of how bad it really is.

So, yeah, I wasn't the best fit for this, but I struggle to think of why anyone would be the best fit for this, to be honest.  Its not that it is just a bad war movie, its a bad movie; period.  It doesnt have anything to say, at least in my humble opinion, and that is a problem.  Some have noted that this is a plus for the film, having its efforts be pretty much as aimless as war itself and yet I don't share this sentiment.  A movie SHOULD tell you something, anything, and yet Fury seems so empty.  Lerman and LaBeaouf put their best feet forward here, but they cant save a film that died a horrible death when David Ayer penned it (and I really liked End of Watch).  Thank the heavens above for the newly christened Oscar winner Stephen Price and his magnificent score, which haunts the scenery like a gift from God, looking down at a disgruntled audience letting them know that not all of their time was wasted.",1415318400,6,4464,4.335740072202166

I always loved watching the old 50's and 60's WW2 movies, though I began to recognize modern tanks standing in as tanks of the 1940's.  Kelly's Hero's was pretty good, but the Tiger was a mock up on a Russian chassis.  Then A Bridge to Far was released....wow.....actual WW2 era tanks, almost. Then Saving Private Ryan...another good mock up of a Tiger.
  My own military career sadly take me into tanks, even over 22 year period.  But I always remembered the stories my Father told me.  He was a U.S. GI, Army regular grunt, went into Europe in early 1944  358th, 90th Inf Div.  His company got whacked somewhere between France & Germany late '44 by an SS Company that include a Tiger Tank.  Everything he described, I saw in that movie.
  The details were 100%.  The insanity, humor, and horror of war, was very well shown.  There is a part of the movie where Brad Pitt's character tries to grab a piece of normalcy of regular, peaceful life.  That may be lost on many viewers, but every Vet will recognize it.

Collier must transfer the meek soldier into a killing machine and rather quickly through whatever unorthodox method as necessary.

6539972,5,B00M0GM4V0,"There is a fascination in America about World War II films. It is a genre that has dozens of films and has connected with audiences on a personal level because of the closeness Americans have with the war. Fury is a film that explores the relationships between soldiers in war and the close bonds they form. Its dynamite. Fury boasts exhilarating action sequences and top-tier performances by a star-studded cast in this unique World War II drama about the life and duties surrounding the five-man crew of a Sherman tank. Easily writer-director David Ayers best film and a new classic to put in the genre of war movies. Brad Pitt is captivating playing Don Wardaddy Collier in a terrific performance that shows both sides of the coin, the good and the bad. Pitt continues to deliver quality film work over the past twenty years and there is no sign of it letting up. Hes that good. The story is told through to the eyes of Private Norman Machine Ellison played by Logan Lerman in a shattering portrayal of innocence lost. He is the new man on the crew and we watch as he starts off refusing to participate in the bloody carnage and ends up to be a willing participant in the horrors of war. Thats the great thing about Fury: It doesnt shy away from the horrors of war. Fury is a raw depiction of what American tank crews went through in the unforgiving environment of war and the brutal acts it took to survive. David Ayers directs beautifully and his script perpetuates the raw, visceral tone of the move. You really care about these characters as the movie progresses and it makes it all the more heartbreaking when bad things happen to them. Blistering performances, a uniquely dark look at World War II, and harrowing action propel Fury into unforgettable territory. You won't be able to look away.  Id been a fan of Ayers since he wrote Training Day and wrote and directed the brilliant End of Watch. He out does himself with this one. Its the best war movie Ive seen since Inglourious Basterds, which showcases another powerhouse performance by Pitt. Shia LaBeouf, Jon Berenthal and Michael Pea give performances as raw as the action the film creates. The acting really is terrific and it makes the scenes all the more engrossing. Also the fact that they used real American and German tanks put this movie in the category of great making the tank scenes enthralling and believable.

6539973,4,B00M0GM4V0,"War is hell. The fighting men of World War II can probably attest to that better than almost anyone else living, which stands to reason that there are still World War II films being made 70 years after its ending. They're not as numerous as they once were, mostly because of the war in Vietnam and how those films seemed to envelop the American mindscape of the 1980s. But there have been so many war films made that they've started to develop sub-genres. Whether it's on sea (THE ENEMY BELOW, DAS BOOT, U-571), in the air (RED TAILS, PEARL HARBOR to an extent, MEMPHIS BELLE), and more than any other, on the ground. FURY is part of the sub-genre of war films about a specific type of combat that hasn't been featured too much: Tank combat. So writer/director David Ayer felt that it was time something like this was brought into the modern cinemascape, and gathering a strong cast, created FURY.

FURY is set during the last days of WWII in Europe where the German Army knew that they were in the death throes and sent out SS units to gather any able-bodied German to fight, including children. The title of the film, first and foremost, is the name of the tank that holds the crew the film focuses on: There's ""Wardaddy"" Collier (Brad Pitt), the tank commander; ""Bible"" (Shia LaBeouf), the gunner; ""Coon-Ass"" (Jon Bernthal), the mechanic (?), and ""Gordo"" (Michael Pena), the driver. According to the film, the average life-expectancy of a tank crew was 6 months, but they've been together since the beginning of the war. During their last run, they lost their assistant driver, and a green new recruit Norman (Logan Lerman) has been forced into taking his place. Obviously this is upsetting to the crew to have a meek and bookish soldier in their home, and this is never as obvious as when Norman hesitates to shoot children running in the woods aside a tank convoy, and another tank crew is killed. Soon, Norman becomes battle-hardened, and through the orders of their superior (Jason Isaacs), they are now the only tank crew that stands between an insufficiently protected stretch of road and a force of 500-odd German SS.

I'd like to start out with what I thought didn't work: Firstly, I wasn't particularly enthused to see that Ayer himself was directing this. Ayer's oevure of work has been mostly exposure of the day-to-day lives of Los Angeles cops, both good and bad. Writing films like TRAINING DAY, DARK BLUE, SWAT, and writing and directing HARSH TIMES and END OF WATCH are apparently much more in his wheelhouse as a filmmaker. But as the writer of the underrated U-571, he obviously can tell a compelling WWII tale. But from a visual standpoint, I had a lot of issues with this film. From the opening moments of the film, where a lone German soldier is walking amongst the silhouettes of several destroyed tanks works very well until there's a sudden strange cut, showing nothing but the bottom of the soldier's legs walking through the mud, I sensed that this was either uncertainty in editing or uncertainty in directing. However, Ayer does direct the action sequences very well, so I'll give him that. Also, some of the performances and characters bothered me. I wasn't impressed at all with Bernthal, who basically is the stereotypical Southern alpha-male that you're designed not to like until he does something heroic or kind. In fact, all the characters in this film are designed to film some sort of post-modern archetype of some sort: Bible is the righteous religious one, Gordo is the token minority wise-ass, Norman is the raw unexperienced recruit, and Collier is the tough-love papa.

There are some potential spoilers ahead, so be careful: The scene that bothered me the most to watch is the scene in the German town where Collier and Norman find two attractive German women. The whole scene is designed to make you feel discomfort, and that's fine; War films aren't designed to make you feel safe. But this scene ends on such a creepy note that you don't exactly know what Ayer is trying to do with it. After Norman has consensual sex with one of the women, the rest of the crew comes in a little later and start drunkenly harassing the women in a way that almost makes it seem like if Collier wasn't there, something very bad would have happened. It seems a little too tonally off, and it's uncomfortable for all the wrong reasons.

But once the crew gets back out into the tank, the film does really fire on all cylinders. The final battle against massive odds, while being a trope that has been played out to death in war films, is as rousing of a piece of cinema as any you might see this year. Pitt and Lerman have most of the dramatic heavy lifting to do, and it's good that each actor is up to the task. Even LaBeouf does an admirable job in a time in his career where he's essentially been written off.

After the battles have died down and the smoke clears, it doesn't seem like Ayer has really done anything different with FURY, other than taking many of the standard war film tropes and setting them in a tank, but that doesn't mean it doesn't work.

6539975,3,B00M0GM4V0,"Fury engenders mixed reviews for good reason.  But, there is something in the mood and atmosphere conveyed that Fury seems to have uniquely captured among war films.  While our reaction to the film, particularly among those of us who have served, is likely to be ambivalent and even negative at certain points, there is an overarching feeling evoked which is inexplicably real and authentic despite the otherwise glaring faults noted here and in many other critical reviews.  One key to enjoying the film is, I believe, understanding we are not seeing an historic rendering of real people experiencing actual events--in many respects Fury is a caricature of both traditional blockbuster war films before it and the composite characters portrayed in those blockbuster war films.  In this sense, it is a much closer cousin to Inglourious Basterds than to Saving Private Ryan--though Fury is certainly not overt satire as is Basterds and part of the fascination I have for Fury is that it seems to almost create its own niche among genres and predecessors.  However, the fact that Pitt essentially just recreates his Aldo Raines character from Basterds and plays it straight seems to hearken to some desire on Ayre's part for direct comparison.

A caricature is not a comedy, and a parody can and often is among the most biting and acid of social and political criticism.  It would be a mistake to view Fury as anything other than a harsh critique of the portrayal of war and the themes conveyed by the old blockbusters.  In a sense, Fury stands in the tradition of films like The Bridge at Remagen, Thin Red Line (original and more pointedly, the remake), Cross of Iron, and if anyone remembers them, Anzio and Red Beach.  I believe we can see clear tips of the hat to The Bridge at Remagen, which is very likely the closest antecedent to Fury in many respects, as well as The Big Red One and Platoon.  However, as already noted, Fury is its own vehicle and seems to comment not just on war and the impact of warfighting policy on the individuals placed in harm's way, but the films that presume to portray it.

Fury is fiction.  Fury uses the personal and tactical perspective of a WWII tank crew facing the Nazis' final, desperate, resort to total war as the Allies closed in on Berlin, to tell a fictional story and to advance the themes and points the writer wishes to make.  In many respects, it proceeds almost in the mode of the propagandistic genre of war films, rotating through a series of demonstrations of the various types of missions for which Sherman tanks may be employed, building the fictional story around these demonstrations.  In many instances, the tactical demonstration is plausible and in others (most notably the climactic crossroads engagement), the situations and their tactical portrayal are so thoroughly implausible that one neither need be a veteran nor historically informed, but mere intuition precludes the ability to suspend disbelief.  The film also employs examples of behavior by combat troops which represent attitudes, caddish and brutish behavior, and overt violations of military law and war crimes that in fact occurred; but, much like the criticism leveled at Oliver Stone for his rendition of his own Vietnam story in Platoon, the stacking of one example on another within a single small tactical unit (in the case of Fury, a single tank crew), is unavoidably distorting in relation to general experience and therefore creates an inaccurate impression.  But, whether we like it or not, these writers' intent is to bludgeon us between the eyes and force us to react.  I think he succeeds.

[SPOILER ALERT]

It is an entirely fair question to pose, as to why given access to research and most notably men who actually crewed tanks in the European theater at the close of the WWII, Ayer chose to manufacture scenarios that distract from the story itself by straining credulity.  It is documented fact that enemy troops attempting to surrender were killed by Allied troops under a variety of circumstances, as was the case for the Germans as well; but the scenario written for Fury involving the execution of an EPW is so contrived the viewer spends more time trying to figure out why the movie is going to these lengths than absorbing the point Ayer is attempting to make and why he couldn't do so by a more believable vehicle.

At the point of the climactic crossroads engagement, anyone who has been through basic training or, as commented upon by a number of reviewers, who has played Call of Duty, knows at the point the crew of Fury is immobilized and buttoned up on the terrain depicted facing what appears to be a fully equipped battalion of the Waffen SS, the engagement would have been short and the outcome inevitable.  Unsupported by infantry, it is over for Fury.  In fact, it strains credulilty that the SS troops would have approached the tank in the manner portrayed at all, without a security halt and sending a point element up to confirm an intact and buttoned up tank was indeed abandoned.  We must chalk it all off to an assumption the SS are untrained, inexperienced and poorly led, and innately stupid.

I made an effort to account for the fog of war, the effect of the initial shock and casualties following initiation of the ambush, and the fact that, historically, at the point in the war depicted, the SS battalions on the Western Front post-D-Day confronting the Allied advance in Germany were not veteran troops of the quality associated with SS combat units earlier in the war.  Nevertheless, the scenario is ridiculous and only highlighted by the final scene of the film evidencing the failure of a battalion-sized force to maneuver elements after initial contact to flank and work to the rear of the tank and kill it by any of the numerous methods the German infantry practiced very well.  So glaring is this particular tactical incompetence, one is forced again to wonder if Ayer does not consciously choose it despite its implausibility.  This is unfortunate because, with the fictional freedom to paint any scenario he might choose and with the technical advice of men who fought in Sherman tanks, it seems the film would have been better served to have set up a more plausible scenario involving a choke point or other defensible terrain.

Having observed the distracting unrealism of certain scenes in Fury, I acknowledge combat experiences are themselves surreal and the unpredictable and irrational actions that unfold in the course of war are sometiimes in fact so seemingly absurd as to defy a sense of reality.  History is replete with examples of error and madness in the wasting of men and women in combat, without regard to their generals knowing better and without regard to consequence.  Why not a fictional second charge of the Light Brigade at a fictional crossroads to facilitate Ayer's story?  Should we fault Ayer for commenting on the unreality and unhinging madness of war generally, rather than being faithful to the history of the time and place he chooses for his story and rendering tactical executions according to the field manuals?  Perhaps not, and perhaps we should forgive Ayer's technical failures in acknowledgement of his larger achievement with his film.

The atmosphere and mood Ayer creates and conveys is a tour de force.  Understanding the mentality and circumstances, of the final days of the Third Reich demonstrates the historic fact of Hitler's conception of ""total war"" dwarfs the fictional portrayal--Ian Kershaw's non-fiction account of this phase of the war and the nationalistic, cultural and attitudinal background to it in his book, The End, confirms the eerie, warped and perverse reality confronted by Allied troops fighting to reach Berlin in the final days after crossing the Rheine.  But, Ayer conveys a sense of what it must have felt like to be there.  My own personal experience under different, but somewhat similar conditions rings true.  In the midst of it are Wardaddy, his veteran crew and the FNG straight out of central casting, Norman.  They are not nihilists as some reviews suggest--but the forces they faced were certainly locked in the throws of a nihilistic craze at a national level.

The crew of Fury hope to survive the war, to see the fruits of peace, and are increasingly incensed and then enraged to the point of frenzied if not berserker behavior (also documented as a matter of fact among WWII combat troops) by the pointless prolongation of the war through an idealism personified by the SS and the perverse necessity to kill the home guards formed of old men, children and little girls.  We sense the extreme to which Wardaddy has gone emotionally to steel himself against the necessity of killing children sent to engage him by their parents and country rather than protecting them.  Juxtapose this with Wardaddy's own program to train, bring of age and protect Norman.  You feel the realization creeping into each crew member's consciousness, that they can only go home when the war ends and the pointless failure by the defeated Third Reich to surrender may preclude their living to see that end.  Wardaddy exemplifies this progression as he fights the tension between adherence to duty and therefore the Army's mission which will end the war and his promise to his crew to get them home alive. The irony is thick when Norman, Wardaddy's adopted son, chooses to stand and fight at the crossroads rather than accepting Wardaddy's urging that he evade back to friendly lines with the other crewmembers.

I have never seen a WWII film which better captures the mood of the realization that Germany is defeated and the outcome inevitable at that point in the war, while portraying the fatigue and intolerance born of anger and disgust among the Allied troops that an ostensibly civilized nation refuses to surrender, and instead unnecessarily prolongs the suffering in violation of all custom and reason.  It is a different kind of enemy and the notion that WWII Germany should behave as a civilized nation was one the advancing Allied troops found with increasing frequency to be false assumption.  What is depicted in Fury is the devolution of combatants represented by the tank crew who are decent citizen soldiers into warriors whose barbarism and desperation to end the war begins to mirror that of the enemy they seek to defeat.

We are reminded of this in the dialogue, Wardaddy's command of the German language, and his character's assumption of the role of stern father and ultimately exhibit great tenderness in the ultimate attempt to save for another day, Norman.  We can only imagine the backstory for Wardaddy, who he was and how he has become what he is now.  The fact that Ayer does not force it on us, and leaves it to our imagination is a plus for the film.

An example of masterful evocation of mood, among the many in the film, is when the armored column of which Fury is part is moving down a road.  The roar of aircraft engines overhead captures our attention and as we look up with Wardaddy, we see an entire patch of sky opened in the clouds filled with a formation of perhaps 50 or more Allied bombers as the few Luftwaffe fighters available fly up to meet them.  In that single moment, the awesome force exerted by the Allies embodied by the daylight bombing raids, is conveyed.  My personal reaction was a simple, ""My God.""  And yet, the Germans stood in the face of that force and continued, defiant, in the rubble of their burned out cities.  It, like other points in the film, is not intended to be left in the fictional frame of 1945, but should point us all to the resilience and ideological commitment of more immediate threats and what our confrontation, at a national and individual level, of those threats has done to transform our own values and culture.

It is almost impossible that Ayer is not consciously aware of The Bridge at Remagen in writing his script for Fury.  That film, released during a point of increasing disillusion with the war in Vietnam, was among the first WWII films to attempt a realist portrayal of American troops as war-weary, and exhibiting a breakdown in discipline and morale.  For those unfamiliar, the film is a fictional portrayal (with several factually accurate piece parts inserted), of the drive to take the final intact bridge across the Rheine River, featuring George Siegel in a role unmistakably similar to that of Fury's Wardaddy and Ben Gazzara as his sergeant, in a role virtually identical to that portrayed by John Bernthal as Grady Travis.  Like Fury, Siegel's character performs his duty despite uncontainable rage at the futility and unfairness of the mission for himself and his men.  In Remagen, it is the infantry that must secure the bridge for the Sherman tanks to cross into Germany--Fury returns the favor, demonstrating a fictional engagement in which a single Sherman tank and its crew fight to secure a MSR for an infantry division.

The opening scenes of Bridge at Remagen include a sequence in which Siegel's character rescues a woman from gang rape and in which, in return, she offers herself to him in a sort of twisted thanks by means of accepting a lesser evil.  Siegel's character refuses, as noted by others as much out of apathy and fatigue as any sort of chivalry, and absently moves to pick over the left over food.  The scene is clearly reflected in Fury, in which Wardaddy and Norman attempt to secure the apartment occupied by a German woman and her 15-year old niece for their own private respite--the niece is offered by Wardaddy to Norman which seems in some perverse way a reasonable trade for preserving her from the otherwise likely gang rape by the Fury's crew outside.  The meaningful looks exchanged between Wardaddy and the more mature aunt ask and answer the questions whether Wardaddy will require the same bargain of her, and both accept that he wishes only to enjoy a quiet meal of eggs prepared at a proper table.  Pitt's character, like Siegel's, cares less for sex than a moment of respite from the war which is abruptly interrupted.  It is during this scene that Wardaddy exposes his back, while washing himself from a basin of water, to show horrific burn scars.  One is reminded of the extreme facial scarring of Bob Barnett, Tom Beringer's character in Platoon, which itself was a subject of criticism as too extreme to be credible at the time that movie was released.

Again, regardless of lingering questions of how Wardaddy would survive, much less recover to remain in active service in theater, from wounds producing such scars, like Berringer in Platoon, the real point is that these men are not made of the same stuff as the rest of us.  They are marked by their experience of war visibly and invisibly, and indelibly, continuing in their seemingly blind adherence to duty in spite of all adversity.  As Barnett says, ""When the machine breaks down, we all break down, and I ain't gonna let that happen.""  Barnett's reason for living seems to be to serve the Army and trust the rest will sort itself out, while Wardaddy understands service to the machine is a means to an end:  an end to the war necessary to fulfill his promise to his people to get them home alive.  In a way, Sergeant Elias meets Barnett in a composite form in Wardaddy.  Why bring forth these images and thoughts of other war films?  Because they combine to support Ayer's overall themes.  None of these films glorify war or paint their characters as stereotype or propagandistic heroes.  Each comes with a warning to those who participate.  If not intentional by Ayer, the allusions to past films is inadvertently present.

Leaving the distraction of the unrealistic scenario aside, the mood of the final combat sequence in Fury conveys well the moments of recognition by warriors when facing decisions which will expose them to likely, though not necessarily certain, death.  Wardaddy and his crew may be resigned to the possibility of their own deaths, but the dialog reveals they never give up hope of fighting through the engagement and surviving. What we see again, in smaller frame, is frustration that the Germans will not quit and simply allow the crew of the Fury to see the end of the war.

What survives in the end is, like the final scene in The Big Red One, a moment of mutual acknowledgement that humanity and the opportunity for life may be honored on both sides of the most extreme brutality driven by any idealism.  While that moment of the film leaves us incredulous, once again there are documented instances of just such moments occurring between enemy combatants on the Western front in particular.  Ayer wishes to remind us, perhaps, reconciliation is possible and may start with the smallest of gestures between the most insignificant of participants in the hostilities.  And, perhaps his point overall is, we should acknowledge the reality of the most extreme brutality as well as the most extreme and unexpected moments of hope and restoration of our humanity, despite our incredulity.

The movie has something it uniquely seems to convey in feeling if not necessarily anything new to say in terms of the actual message. Trite messages, formulaic plot, stereotyped characters--all true.  But, there is something almost inexplicable about the film that is compelling, in spite of its faults.  You want authenticity and close historical accuracy, grab Generation Kill or A Bridge Too Far (both the books and the movies).  Fury is a different deal and should be appreciated as such.",1414540800,22,17565,4.864765100671141

Fury is well acted, and many of the cast should get awards for their performances. This movie gave me a deeper appreciation for my Grandfather, Great Uncles, and the family that I had here in the US that supported the military on the multiple fronts. They were men and women who saw great horrors, but came home and put them away and built lives.",1414454400,4,504,4.43010752688172
6539978,3,B00M0GM4V0,"Below, I will explain why I give it only 3 stars, from a thematic perspective.  It gets 3 from me instead of 1 because I admire well-done action scenes, and this movie has some very exciting ones.  It's not because they're ultra-realistic that I like the action scenes, but because they're well-staged and well-edited.

Except for the enjoyment of suspense and powerful action (but be aware that it's very intense--not everyone would enjoy it like me), was it worth the journey?  After seeing it in the theater, I was surprised by how meaningless it felt at the end, from a thematic standpoint.  The one message the movie keeps driving home is:  War is hell.  But is there some greater benefit that can be gained from experiencing the severity of war in this movie?  I'm grateful that only a little of the footage shot during World War II was in color, because the images of destruction can be mind-numbing.  The black and white helps it be more bearable.  But now movies are trying to recreate all that WWII horror in color, and this one, Fury, takes the cake.  (Before watching something like this, be sure you're prepared!!!  I only saw it because war violence never leaves images traumatizing my mind, but different people's minds work differently.  However, I can't watch horror movie previews and have to close my eyes during 'em.)  So my question is, what benefit does the movie give besides showing how severe war is and making you think about the meaning of heroism?

It is a common thing in movies today to have a twist at the end which deliberately avoids resolving a moral question.  In Fury, the question is (and I'm not telling how the movie ends, except that it doesn't resolve the question at all):  Are they heroes because they're serving a just cause, have they lost their humanity because of their animal instincts, or both?  That is a theme which has so much potential, and wouldn't need to be fully resolved, but I would have appreciated it if Fury didn't end with such pessimism and gloom.  Schindler's List found goodness in the awfulness, and 12 Years a Slave had a somewhat satisfying real-life resolution which made the pain more worthwhile, but what does this have?  (If you've seen All Is Lost, a recent Robert Redford ocean survival movie, that and Fury have the same kind of unresolved question about how much it's worth it to survive, and the same kind of unclear emotions at the end.  I do not like All Is Lost.)

So is the function of Fury supposed to be a documentary acted out in a totally engrossing way, as if you're watching how soldiers can get when they're most desperate?  (As if we didn't already know?  They get lustful for women, which becomes a quite disturbing scene in this movie; they use the f and sh words nearly every sentence, which becomes quite pitiable and annoying in this movie; and they get angry and vengeful--but only when they're really desperate or have been taught to show no mercy.)  Of course soldiers who faced the level of hell that the beleaguered American tank crews faced wouldn't be light-hearted.  I didn't expect any humor from this, and admire that the movie is true to the raw emotion that would come with such experience.  I have no problem with it intentionally moving away from the lighthearted, confident dialogue of war movies from decades ago.  I wish it had not pushed so hard to force you to feel the pessimism of the characters, though.  It is an extremely intense experience already with its level of violence, something which has become standard in war movies since Steven Spielberg insisted on realism in Saving Private Ryan.  But there should be something to compensate for the extreme darkness of the circumstances and battles.

In the dialogue, there was a lot of potential to develop themes as there are two perspectives trying to claim your attention, which are Brad Pitt's ""Do your duty and don't question authority"", and Shia LaBeouf's (for once he's not playing a rebellious character!) ""God is on our side because we are stopping the Nazis"".  Neither character expounds on his own perspective very meaningfully.  Worse, an ultra-painful character change by Logan Lerman (who also played Ham, the troubled son of Noah, in the recent movie Noah) makes the movie nothing more than a tragedy of the loss of virtue.  He starts as the stereotypical wimp who can't handle shooting a gun--which is not wimpy, but is a character cliche in war movies.  (It was an early part of Hollywood's propaganda method, intended to make the audience more eager to be brusquely confident and more afraid of looking like the wimp.)  Then he moves into treating a woman as a sex object and cursing f words constantly and enjoying killing.  The process is somewhat gradual, but it's still hard to watch.  Brad Pitt's (the commander of the tank) character has no problem with treating women as sex objects, either.  While that probably was the case with some WWII American commanders, it leaves a moral vacuum within the story.  There's no role model, and that's exactly the intent of writer and director David Ayer.  Beyond that, there's no truth:  You are supposed to recognize that neither Brad's ""Do your duty"" nor Shia's ""God is on our side"" can address the heartache that Logan feels after losing his ideals, losing his virginity (behind closed doors in the movie, not in front of the audience), losing his friends, and realizing that all his own efforts couldn't save him.  The one spoiler I'll give about the ending is that it's the mercy of the enemy that keeps him alive.

From one perspective, though, the mystery at the end, ""Why did I survive, and am I a hero or not?"", could take you toward the Apostle Paul's thinking in his letter to the Romans, about God's grace being sufficient when our own efforts aren't enough, and cleansing us from guilt.

I like how dedicated the director was to keeping a fully realistic atmosphere, and I had fun enjoying the well-staged and well-edited action scenes, but the pessimistic ending was even more of a turn-off than the persistent f words (which actually get easy to tune out after a while, to be honest!).  However, I gotta admire the acting of especially Brad Pitt and Shia LaBeouf, because they know how to take on fully developed personalities even when the script doesn't give them a change of attitude.  That is, they can embody their characters comfortably even without having to rely on the more emotional forms of expression that accompany a major character change (Logan Lerman's).

I would recommend this movie only to those who like war movies.

(P.S. - In my opinion, there's really no need to make movies that show ""how bad things were"" with utmost realism.  When you look at the Warner Brothers war movies of WWII, the Production Code wouldn't allow them to cuss or show R-rated level of violence and they still showed the effects of war with equal power.  The World War I scene on Sergeant York from 1941 was just as powerful as what they show today, without showing as much violence.)",1414454400,,7027,4.74238683127572
6539979,5,B00M0GM4V0,"This movie was great! The acting is amazing. Each character is written in a unique way and has an individual role that adds to the screenplay.

The special effect are amazing! I actually thought that the best thing about this movie was the special effect and the fighting scenes. I haven't seen such a good realization of a war movie before.

Brad Pitt is incredible as always. He was born to play such roles as this one or Lt. Aldo Raine. Yes, this movie bore some resemblances to Inglorious Basterds, but hey, it's a World War II movie situated in Germany.

To people saying that this movie wasn't patriotic because it didn't portray the american soldiers on their best behavior or as sadists, I say that they couldn't be more wrong. This movie is about the war and it does to people, to their soul and their mind. They weren't situated in a field filled with flowers, they were in the middle of a damn war. That does things to a persons mental health and stability.

The one little thing I didn't like was the length of the movie. They could have done without those 10-15 min in the end. It got a little dull by the end and the scenes were too long.

Overall I give this movie 5 stars. 5 stars for the special effects, 5 stars for the scrips, 5 stars for the acting.",1414454400,,1269,4.337552742616034

The American (""War Daddy's"") tank crew were using the M4E8 (""Easy Eight"") Sherman, which had a high velocity 76mm cannon (like the Mk.

6540044,2,B00M0GM4V0,"I mostly didn't like this film. Many parts of it rubbed me in the wrong way, even if it has also some good stuff in it. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

As I believe everybody knows, this film tells the story of an American tank (a M4Sherman, the advanced version with long 75 mm gun) named ""Fury"" and its five crew members during the last days of World War II, in April 1945, at a moment when allies were already deep in German territory. All action takes place during a couple of days and the whole story is seen mostly through the eyes of a young, boyish looking rookie soldier, Private 2nd Class Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman), who was just affected to ""Fury"" in replacement of a killed machine-gunner. Ellison never saw combat before, as until now he was all the time affected to headquarters as typist...

On another hand the rest of the crew are hardened veterans, who started the war in Africa in November 1942 and made it through France and Belgium all the way to Germany. Those four are:

- Technician Fifth Grade (T/5 or ""Tech Corporal"") Boyd ""Bible"" Swan (Shia LaBoeuf); Swan is the gunner targeting and firing the main 75 mm gun of the tank; he is a religious man avoiding liquor and fornication, and is also prone to preaching - therefore he is the butt of many, many jokes and is also occasionally a little bit resented by his companions...

- Corporal Trini ""Gordo"" Garcia (Michael Pena); Pena is the driver of the tank; he is either a Porto Rican or a Mexican immigrant - when they want to mess with him other guys warn him not to speak ""Mexican"" in an American tank...; he is occasionally prone to some limited clownery (like wearing a ""liberated"" top hat when drunk), otherwise he is just a regular Joe (or rather Jos&eacute;)

- Corporal Grady ""Coon Ass"" Travis (Jon Bernthal); the loader of the gun and the operator of the coaxial machine gun; Travis is the tallest and the strongest guy in the crew, which made him automatically the loader, as carrying 75 mm shells is not an easy thing... Hailing from the deep South, he is ugly, potty-mouthed, hard drinking, somehow looking and acting as an ape and in fact quite an @hole... Incidentally, Jon Bernthal is exactly as tall as Brad Pitt (180 cm) and only slightly taller than Logan Lerman (175 cm), but in the film he is always shown as towering over the rest of the crew...

- Staff Sergeant Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier (Brad Pitt); Collier is a tank commander, a battle scarred (in every sense of the term) veteran and a guy full of surprises, most of them unpleasant... Although the story shows almost everything through Ellison's eyes, it is in fact Collier who is the main character if the film and for that reason I will not say anything more about him to avoid spoilers.

Although I ultimately didn't like the film, I must recognize, that is has some STRONG POINTS:

1. Fighting scenes. Some of them (not all) are good, solid stuff, as in ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Blackhawk down"", ""Band of brothers"" or ""Pacific"". All scenes with tanks - by moments there is as much as five of them operating in concert- are very good! A little SPOILER here: the scene of fight against the Tiger tank shown in the trailer is a GREAT one - but this is the ONLY tank vs. tank moment. In other fighting scenes there are also two German PAK40 75 mm anti-tank guns, one German assault-gun, either a Sturmgeschutz III or Sturmgeschutz IV (as the wheels were not shown, I couldn't say which one it was) and one Sdkfz 251 armored half-track troop carrier. However Germans mostly fight as light infantry, but with many MG42 machine guns, StuG44 assault rifles and Panzerfaust anti-tank weapons.

2. Care given to military details. That was well done - vehicles, uniforms, weaponry, all this looks and feel authentic. The inside of the tank, with various personal effects and German paraphernalia ""liberated"" in successive battles, was I believe recreated quite faithfully. I particularly liked the fact that Collier uses a captured German Sturmgewehr 44 assault rifle as it makes a lot of sense - indeed, in 1945 there was no better infantry weapon than this direct ancestor of Kalashnikov...

3. Good performance by all five main actors, beginning of course with Brad Pitt. As for young Logan Lerman, well, him I didn't see before in anything, but here he really shines! But THE ENORMOUS GOOD SURPRISE of ""Fury"" is the performance of Shia LaBoeuf, an actor whom I actually HATED until this film, because he sucked in everything I saw before (all three ""Transformers"", ""Indiana Jones"", ""Eagle Eye""). Well, here he is GOOD, for a lot of reasons, not the least of which is the total absence of any ""shialaboeufing"" (you know, the infamous ""no,no,no,nononononoNONONO"")!

Among the supporting actors, I particularly liked Xavier Samuel (""Twilight: Eclipse"", ""Adore"") who plays 2nd Lieutenant Parker - he has very little screen time, but he is excellent as a boyish rookie officer, who has to command a bunch of much older, much tougher, grizzled veterans...

4. Some good one liners, beginning with ""Ideas are peaceful. History is violent"".

THE ONE HUUUGE PROBLEM

Before ""Fury"" David Ayer made EXCLUSIVELY cops/gangster movies, with Los Angeles drug trafficking street gangs always playing an important role in them. He of course wrote the ""Training Day"" (a honest film), after which he directed two very forgettable things (""Harsh Times"" and ""Street Kings"") and then he made a REALLY good cop/gangster film, ""End of Watch"". I still didn't see the one about dirty DEA agents (""Sabotage"")... And that clearly took a toll on him, because ""Fury"" IS IN FACT JUST ANOTHER FILM about a turf war between two violent criminal street gangs - it is just that those two outfits shoot it out in Europe and use tanks...

I know that this sounds crazy, but let's consider the evidence. WARNING! SPOILERS AHEAD! American WWII soldiers are presented in this film as a bunch of half-crazed barbarians who kill as much for pleasure as per duty - and even in situations in which they can use guns, they will go for a knife kill, without any reason, just for the hell of it or may be rather to improve their ""street creed""... Even more, we are told that a young soldier who arrives in a frontline unit must first undergo a ""street gang like"" initiation, before being considered as a man and a soldiers. During this initiation he must first commit a cold blooded murder of a defenceless man and then rape a young girl. Before that he is not considered as part of the outfit and even doesn't have a real name - only after those two ""deeds"" he is allowed to have a nick (a ""street name""). After watching the first half of this film for me it became clear, that the crew of ""Fury"" was in fact a violent street gang, led by a sadistic goon, seconded by a psychopathic sidekick (like Evil and Lala in ""End of Watch"").

Even before the film was released some authentic American WWII veterans who actually really fought on European theatre and were hired as technical advisors, objected to some scenes and especially those of war crimes committed by American soldiers. According to them they never witnessed or even heard about the kind of things Americans do in some of the most extreme scenes of this film - and I actually believe them. I read in my life probably a thousand of books about World War II and I believe that some scenes described in this film definitely didn't happen. That especially concerns (SPOILER AHEAD) one scene in which an American soldier commits an absolutely useless, senseless, cold-blooded, sadistic MURDER in the middle of a crowd of like fifty other guys and ALL other GIs actually find it funny and ONLY ONE objects!

I absolutely refuse to believe that such things routinely happened. Of course, as Spielberg showed it in ""Saving Private Ryan"", there were cases in which German prisoners were killed when Americans were fresh from a bloody battle in which they lost friends. Yes, there were cases in which outraged Americans killed prisoners after the Malmedy massacre of captured GIs committed by Germans in 1944 and after the death of general Rose, shot after surrendering by a panicked German at the battle of Paderborn in 1945. And yes, there were some SS guards shot by enraged Americans after the liberation of concentration camps. But the scene of MURDER in this film doesn't enter in any of those categories and I really believe that including it was an OUTRAGEOUS mistake and a PROVOCATION!

The purpose of the director was clearly to take the Great Generation a couple of pegs down, by trying to show them as less impressive than their public perception. But in fact ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Band of Brothers"" and ""Pacific"" already did this - and for my personal taste they did it much better. Here the director decided to simply go further and deeper and in my opinion he overstepped. American veterans are shown here as obscene, frequently drunk, dirty, mentally unstable sadistic murderers and rapists. Well, once again, based on everything I read about World War II on European theatre (I am not talking here about the Eastern Front), I believe that the vision shown here is not true... Also, let's not forget that those people, once returned home, build American prosperity and stability from 1945 to 1965 - how would it be possible if they were all sadistic thugs, obscene drunks, sniggering rapists and vicious murderers!? Well, the answer is: it wouldn't and they weren't.

LESSER BUT NEVERTHELESS SERIOUS ISSUES

1. Generally speaking, although some fighting scenes are good, mostly they are not, with Germans shown as utterly incompetent morons.

2. There is a moment when Americans have to decide if they stay and fight a desperate fight or run to fight another day. As they are not surrounded, their decision to stay is illogical and even ABSURD. With one extra line in the scenario, through which their retreat would be cut off, it would be possible to make this scene into a much more logical and REALLY tragic one.

3. The great finale fight was really over the top and definitely less good than the apocalyptic last stand battle in ""Saving Private Ryan"". Sorry for the SPOILER here, but in the long and vicious finale battle here Germans, who are supposed to be tough Waffen SS troops, act like total morons, keep running like headless chicken, don't even try to take cover and die unnecessarily and unproductively by bushels - in fact they literally RUN INTO machine gun fire at every possible opportunity...))) Even more, before the battle they are shown having and carrying DOZENS of Panzerfausts, weapons which could easily dispatch a Sherman tank with one shot, but in the battle they need to bring Panzerfausts in boxes from the rear and then they shoot a grand total of two of them - before reverting to machine guns and hand grenades...)))

There was a similar fight between an immobilised tank (a Soviet KV-2) and hundreds of German soldiers - it took place in June 1941, at Rosienie (Raseinai). At that time German infantry didn't have efficient anti-tank weapons and this lonely heavy tank stooped for 24 hours the whole German 6th Division of infantry. However, in 1945, with Panzerfausts available in great abundance, an isolated immobile tank facing regular German infantry would be easy meat...

4. At the end of the film there is one scene between an American soldier and a young Waffen SS trooper which DOESN'T MAKE THE SLIGHTEST SENSE, is ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS and HURTS this film no end...

CONCLUSION: for me this is not a good film. Actors certainly did a great job and there is one very good action scene, but weakness of other action scenes, exaggerated sadistic violence, anachronistic nihilism and ENORMOUS plot holes hurt this film a lot. It is definitely nowhere near the quality of ""Saving Private Ryan"" - and definitely doesn't even try to convey any kind of moral message. I will definitely NOT buy the DVD.",1414108800,,11939,4.764392839864538

This movie reveals the horrors of war and what it takes to maintain the every day freedoms we have to worship, work and strive to make a better life for those we love.  Character and courage comes through.  Not many movies entertain and provide such realistic reflections in doing so.  Brad Pitt and the supporting cast were great.

This 71 year old former 101st Abn Div and 173rd Abn Bde Sgt recommends it highly. Go see it!",1414022400,4,534,4.568421052631579
6540046,2,B00M0GM4V0,"Maybe the problem was that I just wasn't really in the mood for such a heavy, dark film.  And because of that I only got about 45 minutes into it before I walked out (I skipped into another theater and watched a different movie).  So perhaps I missed the ""uplifting"" part of the movie...but at 45 minutes in, I was left wondering, IS there an uplifting part to this movie?  There were three things I had an issue with:
1 - It was graphically bloody (one of the first scenes show you a mangled human face that's been blown off and is lying on the ground).
2 - even for a war movie, I thought the language was too much, and for me at least, it was off putting (I know it's war, and the language was rough, but it is really necessary in the movie for there to be an F word every three words?)
3 - were there any redeeming characteristics to these characters?  I didn't get through the whole movie, so maybe later on, it shows the ""good"" side of the men, but in the first half of the movie, however, all you saw were a bunch of hard, angry, hate filled men with no redeeming qualities at all.  In one scene, Pitt's character forces another to execute an unarmed prisoner.  No one protests, no one tries to step in, instead you see them all cheering and laughing.  The whole ""point"" seems to be that every person in war is nothing but a animalistic, killing machine with no conscience or decency.  And I had a BIG problem with that, because that is just an insult to the thousands of veterans who fight in our wars and yet mange to stay ""good"" men with their moral compass firmly intact.

I've read the other reviews and I know that a lot of people are giving this movie good reviews, and that's fine, everyone has their own opinion.  I can only tell you that the movie was too dark for me.  I think it's a matter of balancing the ""reality"" of war, with what the movie audience can actually stomach.  But I also challenge their depiction of a bunch of soldiers with no redeeming qualities at all....my father fought in WWII, and we have several friends who fought in Vietnam, and while they would tell you that war is bloody and awful and that it does change a man... they would also tell you that that does NOT mean that a man changes into an animal who can't recognize right from wrong, or that he lets hatred consume him.",1414022400,21,2319,4.257403189066059

6540048,4,B00M0GM4V0,"Theatrical review.  There may be spoilers.

After the terrible movie ""Sabotage,"" director David Ayer finds his way again with this excellent war film.  Set at the end of World War II in Germany, the Americans are fighting their way to Berlin.  With defeat eminent, the Nazis are still holding on.  Hitler has recalled his troops to defend the motherland.  The film focuses on the crew of a Sherman tank led by Sgt. `Wardaddy' Collier (Brad Pitt).  His crew includes `Bible' Swan (Shia LaBeouf), `Gordo' Garcia (Michael Pena), `Coon-Ass' Travis (Jon Bernthal) and a new man, Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman).

Ellison is a clerk but has been reassigned to replace a crewman recently killed in battle.  The film plays out, more-or-less, from Norman's perspective.  A platoon of 4 tank squads are sent to defend a key crossroads deep inside Germany.  One of the best scenes in the movie occurs when the relatively small American tanks take on a huge German behemoth.  The cat and mouse tactics are exhilarating to say the least.

As `Wardaddy' and his crew secure a town where they will make their stand, they venture into the village.  `Wardaddy' has become a gruff father-like figure to Norman and takes him into an apartment occupied by a woman (Anamaria Marinca) and her cousin (Alicia von Rittberg).  `Wardaddy' is looking for a nice meal and suggests that Norman might lose his virginity to Emma (von Rittberg).  She doesn't seem to object.  The complexity of `Wardaddy' is shown when the rest of the crew barge in and ""ruin a nice dinner.""

David Ayer's biography is filled with hard-boiled films.  Both those he directed and those he wrote.  ""Fury"" is no exception.  We get a taste for what we're in for with the opening scene when `Wardaddy' jumps from his tank onto a German officer on horseback and plunges a knife into his eye.  There's more to come.  At the same time, we see `Wardaddy' has another side to him.  We see Norman harden quickly faced with the savageness of warfare.

The film can be a bit claustrophobic at times as several shots are inside the tank, but comes nowhere close to another terrific war film involving tanks, ""Lebanon"" (2009).  The acting is first rate with Pitt and LeBeouf as standouts.  The film is brutal, bloody and violent.  Just like war.",1413936000,,2278,4.786632390745501
6540059,5,B00M0GM4V0,"I am not a war buff, but when I saw this movie I was on the edge of my seat for the whole movie. I laughed, cringed, and cried.

6540061,1,B00M0GM4V0,"What a cliched, absurd cartoon. Shia LaBeouf overacts in the entire film. Brad Pitt phones it in. Michael Pena doesn't realize it's 1945 World War II Germany, not 1996 Los Angeles. Battle scenes show Shermans being taken out by German Panzerschrecks and Tigers, yet the Fury manages to deflect these shells and survive numerous times, unscathed. Experienced German SS soldiers completely forget all of their tactics. There is even a scene where the main characters take part in forcibly entering the apartment of two women and rape one. After seeing Sabotage, I swore to never watch another David Ayer movie, but this film was even more absurd. I mean, in Sabotage, the DEA is portrayed as being a force full of types that look like felons that even have drug addicts. In Fury, US soldiers are portrayed as criminal thugs that murder POW's for sport and force themselves on women. David Ayer's strategy for film making is basically to make the majority of his characters detestable and trashy last class type of people, with one or two decent people caught up in the whole mess. He is a terrible writer and director that should not get any more work.",1413849600,58,1150,4.78391959798995
6540062,4,B00M0GM4V0,"The first scene of the new war movie ""Fury"" aptly sets the tone. Amid the smoky aftermath of a tank battle, a German officer rides a beautiful white horse among the destroyed vehicles. It is a stunning tableau, if only for the juxtaposition, and the viewer wonders where it will lead. It leads to a figure leaping off an American tank who tumbles and then viciously stabs the German to death.

The killer is Sgt. Don ""Wardaddy"" Collier (a hard and steely Brad Pitt) and he likes killing Germans, something, we are informed, he has been doing since 1942. It is now April 1945 and the war in Europe is one month from ending. But for the American victors, it may as well be a lifetime away. In this uncompromising film, G.I. Joe the Liberator is a filthy, ragged, apathetic wreck, immune to slaughter and virtually indistinguishable from the Orcs of ""Lord of the Rings."" They continue to slog east through Germany by inertia and survive combat, if they do, only from instinct and harsh experience.

""Fury"" could be called ""Saving Private Ryan"" in a tank. But while other war films have imitated that ground-breaking epic, ""Fury"" stands on its own. The soldiers in ""Fury"", especially the crew of the M4 Sherman which bears the name, are more beaten down and exhausted. To them, death, especially the cruel death of immolation, the fate of any destroyed tank, is as present as breathing. Dead bodies are like so much garbage. Everything is covered with mud, blood and grime.

There is one unusual and effective scene where Collier induces two German women to prepare a meal for him in their apartment as he washes his hair. It plays out as ritual. The man wants something that smacks as normal, a reminder of the peacetime world that must feel like an unattainable mirage. The scene is played out with a mix of beauty and tension.

The combat sequences in ""Fury"" are quite startling as Collier maneuvers his iron beast with the deftness of a Broadway choreographer. The noise, movement and unrelenting violence are both appalling and thrilling. It imparts the same feeling to the audience. I found myself on the literal edge of my seat.

Such a build-up makes the ending so much more disappointing. Stranded by a damaged tread at a strategic crossroads, the tank crew is forced to stage an Alamo-like ""Heroic Few against the Mindless Many"" last stand. Hundreds of German elite SS troopers foolishly run into the gun barrels of the Americans to be slaughtered en-masse with as much drama as extras being mowed down in a Rambo movie. This is where I lost interest in the film.

However, the filmmakers redeemed themselves with the final aerial shot which I will not spoil. Suffice it to say that it highlights the fact that war is more than just horror and heroism. War is, in the end, nothing but stupidity and waste; the human race behaving at its most primitive level.

Despite its flaws (is Collier hefting a not-yet-invented AK-47?), ""Fury"" remained with me after I left the theater and is a film worth viewing.",1413849600,4,3009,4.72

6540065,5,B00M0GM4V0,"FURY is incredible. This film that brings WWII closest to the reality of horror more than any other film that I have seen. There is no glory here, simply a sense of despair and imminent death in more horrible ways that can be imagined. You don't live, you don't survive, you just exist in a war. That is what kept going through my mind. FURY is an experience. I kept having flashbacks of my friend who served in the 1st Infantry division in WWII from Casablanca all the way through to Czechoslovakia. We spent many coffee breaks together and he told me many things he saw and witnessed. He told me how he felt and how others felt and acted. I saw a lot of what he said about war in FURY. I cannot explain it, but this movie hit home. I just saw it at the theater and wanted to write about it. There is one scene in the film that is just so realistic, and that is when the replacement who has only had 8 weeks of training is assigned to Brad Pitt's crew. He has a meltdown in the tank and the words he spoke were almost exactly what my 1st division friend had told me he had seen. Near the end of the war they were taking anybody they could find as replacements. It did not matter if they could see, what color they were, or how old they were. And some broke down, some ran, many didn't. The point here is that all these things go through your mind and that is where FURY hits you. It makes you think, it makes you feel and then think again. Who would ever want to be in a war? This is a one of a kind movie. You have to see it.",1413763200,345,1527,4.00983606557377
6540066,4,B00M0GM4V0,"""Fury"" (2014 release; 134 min.) brings the story of a Sherman tank and its crew. As the movie opens, we get treated to an apocalyptic scene of death and destruction somewhere in the battlefield. We are reminded that it is ""April, 1945"", and soon are introduced to the crew, led by Don (played by Brad Pitt). During the most recent battle, they lost their assistant driver and soon a replacement shows up. Norman (played by Logan Lerman) clearly is rookie, and sheepishly admits that ""I've never seen the inside of a tank"". Neither have I, but no worries, before too long Norman and the viewing audience will get to spend far more time inside a tank than you can imagine. To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, the movie is written and directed by David Ayer. who most recently brought us the Schwarzenegger action movie ""Sabotage"" and before that ""End of Watch"". I'd say that with this movie, Ayer has been promoted a couple of classes, as this is his best work yet. Second, a sizeable part of the movie takes place inside the tank, and Ayer brings is in a claustrophobic way, reminiscent of the submarine scenes in ""Das Boot"". Third, the battle scenes are nothing short of epic and when you see this on the big screen with perfect audio quality, it will all just blow you away. Beware: some scenes are very intense, almost too much so. At some point Don comments to Norman that ""Ideals are peaceful, history is violent"", and this movie is all to happy to show us history, not ideals. Third, the acting performances are outstanding. It seems as if Brad Pitt is only getting better as he's getting older. The role of crew leader/elder statesman/mentor of Norman suits him perfectly. The four other Fury crew members are equally fine, but this benefits Shia LeBeouf the most of all. Last but not least, there is a fine orchestral score in the movie, courtesy of British film composer Steven Price.

I went to see this today in one of the many theatres playing ""Fury"" here in Cincinnati with my 27 yr. old son. He also liked it quite a bit, although we both agreed that it was a lot more intense than we had expected. The early evening screening where we saw this at was nicely attended, although nowhere near a sell-out. I just read that Fury is the top-grossing movie of the weekend, taking in $23 million. This is quite the feat, considering ""Fury"" is not a particularly easy movie to watch. If you like WWII history in general and intense warfare, I'd readily suggest that you check out this movie, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, or on DVD/Blu-ray.",1413676800,16,2679,4.5675675675675675
6540067,5,B00M0GM4V0,"This movie turned out better than I thought it would. I had not seen Brad Pitt in a movie since he was asking Morgan Freeman ""what's in the box?"" So it's been a while. --SPOILERS ahead--

When I saw the previews for this movie, I was afraid the 'scared new guy' tossed in with a group of battle hardened veterans would be a repeat of Corporal Upham in Saving Private Ryan, whose cowardice got several good men killed. I was glad it didn't quite turn out that way. Private Norman Ellison at first refused to kill, in fact had to be wrestled to the ground by SSG Collier and forced to shoot his first German. I was reasonably satisfied with the way the crew finally accepted the ""FNG."" If you don't know what an FNG is, I'll tell you part of it means New Guy. I'm sure you can figure out what the F stands for.

Anyway, this movie was very realistic in many ways. The German tanks totally outclassed the Shermans.. too bad there were far more Shermans than Tiger tanks. The Tigers had superior armor and firepower, the Shermans had greater numbers and were more maneuverable. We see in one scene that one Tiger knocks out three Shermans, but the 4th manages to get behind the Tiger and knock it out, after sustaining some damage of its own. The movie was accurate in depicting Shermans as prone to catching fire. The brutality of war is on full gory display here, with plenty of blood and more than one decapitation shown. One particularly nasty scene shows a soldier's head run over and literally split like a melon. Still, if you're going to accurately depict what really happened, this is how it has to look.

The performances from the actors were all very good. I thought that for the most part, the film avoided most of the Hollywood war movie clichs, with one exception. I thought that the scene where Norman was wrestled to the ground and literally forced to shoot a POW was a little weak. Why do that when the veterans know that combat will wake him up to reality soon enough? But, on the other hand, I was pleased that they avoided the gratuitous sex scene when Norman was in the bedroom with the German girl. It's not even clear if they had sex. It's enough to know that they felt an attraction to each other, which would motivate Norman later on when she is killed. There is a lot of profanity in this movie, which I was completely ok with, because anyone who has been in the military knows that young soldiers are not afraid to have every other word begin with F.

In the end, after lots of intense combat, only a stunned Norman remains, and you can believe in his reaction when another soldier calls him a hero. Each one of the other members of the tank crew was in turn a hero, and while Norman did his share of fighting, in the end he is only alive because an SS soldier saw him hiding under the tank and spared him. Being called a hero seems to jolt him, and without him saying so, the audience can tell that Norman thinks the real heroes are the dead men still inside the tank. And the fact that it happened in April 1945, just weeks before the end of the war in Europe, makes it that much more tragic.",1413676800,141,3117,4.341337907375643
6540068,5,B00M0GM4V0,"This film really makes it about men,  not ""heroes"" that have been shown in previous well known WW2 movies. These soldiers are tired, angry, and just want to kill every SS soldier till the kraut's quit. There is a meal eating scene which shows these men taking that anger, that ""fury"" from the battle and how it affects them after combat. This entire movie takes place in a day and its the most emotionally gripping war film I've seen in a while. Everyone in this cast hit the mark. Shia surprised me, he really sold me on his character.
