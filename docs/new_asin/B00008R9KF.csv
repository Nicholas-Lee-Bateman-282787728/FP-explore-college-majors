1858262,5,B00008R9KF,"I love MY BEAUTIFUL LAUNDERETTE. I saw it ages ago in a local art house, and have never forgotten some of the scenes and the dialogue or the story line. The tale was written by a young Asian playwright of English birth and is somewhat autobiographical. It is a coming of age and love story rolled into one. Although the film is jam-packed with fine Asian actors, some of whom have very familiar faces, the most memorable character from my perspective is ""Johnny"" played by Daniel Day Lewis.
Johnny bears a strong resemblance to various young EAST ENDERS, to Sid Vicious as portrayed by Gary Oldman in the film SID AND NANCY (physical build and demeanor, Johnny isn't as violent), and some of the youths in various Mike Leigh films. If you see this film along with other DDL films such as MY LEFT FOOT, LAST OF THE MOHICANS, THE BOXER, THE AGE OF INNOCENCE, THE CRUCIBLE, and THE UNBEARABLE LIGHTNESS OF BEING, you will realize why Daniel Day Lewis is the greatest living actor in the Enlish-speaking world. When LAUNDERETTE becomes available I plan to add it to my nearly complete collection of DDL films. DDL was very young when he made this film--near the time he made THE BOUNTY in which he plays Mr. Frye, and ROOM WITH A VIEW in which he plays Cecil. He's just incredible.
At the beginning of the tale, Johnny like many of his English friends is semi-hostile toward the Pakistani settlers in London.  He feels they are somehow implicated in his predicament which is to be an unemployed school dropout with no future in Margaret Thatcher's England. Johnny offends the Asians with anti-immigrant behaviour--marching in a ""parade"" through the Asian sector of town to protest the presence of the Pakistanis in England.
Some time later Johnny and the young Pakistani boy who is the protagonist of LAUNDERETTE (undoubtedly the author) become reacquainted. The young man is attempting to become independent from his overbearing relatives and establish himself as a London businessman by opening a launderette. He succeds, and manages to open his launderette, and he hires Johnny as his assistant. Soon Johnny becomes more than an employee, he becomes a lover. Obviously, given that the Asian boy's family would prefer that he retain his culture and allow them to arrange a marriage Johnny is a problem. They had not imagined their son and nephew would link up with Johnny--the lower class skinhead who is white and homosexual. Many awkward and funny moments ensue.
The film is filled with humor, strife, growing up, ties of family, racism, religion, homoerotic love, and the struggle to become acculturated in a new society. The DVD is worth the price just to see Daniel Day Lewis with a peroxide blonde crewcut, his head covered with a baseball cap, his mouth filled with chewing gum, and naked. He is priceless.",991353600,63,2811,4.831950207468879

1858294,5,B00008R9KF,Let's take a look at the cultural mores of the 1980's in South London as a young Pakistani man and a young London man fall in love. First lets look at the very understated story. wonderfully told and explores the Pakistani population of England and brings us into it. There is also the look at the prejudices that seem to exist everywhere. As we look into this story of the patriarch of the family giving his nephew a run down laundromat to work we see the lives and tribulations of the family and others. The very slow unfolding of the love between theses 2 very different men becomes the focal point of the movie. Does love conquer all? check it out.,1457654400,2,652,4.396694214876033

1858298,1,B00008R9KF,"There's an ugly ""anti-English"" white man streak in the film that paints foreign Hindus living in London as being ""industrious, productive and discriminated against"". I found it so insidiously stupid and contrived and wondered how anyone with a brain would not take this as simplistic Indian propaganda.

It is vile and reprehensible to the maximum.

Stick with David Lean films, since they don't ostracize British folks.

This was my first time to see Daniel Day Lewis, and he is brilliant as a fascist London street punk who turns out to be capable of great compassion and love.

1858313,5,B00008R9KF,"The Criterion Collections new Blu-Ray transfer successfully preserves My Beautiful Laundrettes grungy 16mm film stock in an aesthetically pleasing way. This is the way the film was meant to be seen.

Producer Colin MacCabe interviews director Stephen Frears. He talks about how he got his start, working his way up first as an assistant for the likes of Lindsay Anderson in the 1960s and then getting regular work at the BBC in the 1970s. They discuss how Margaret Thatchers assent to power changed British cinema and television. He also talks about how he was given the script for Laundrette and his impressions of its subject matter.

Hanif Kureishi is interviewed and talks about some of the films themes. He was influenced by American writers like Jack Kerouac and J.D. Salinger, and rock n roll music like Jimi Hendrix and especially David Bowie. He also talks about the origins of his script and working with Frears.

The founders of Working Title Films, producers Tim Beaven and Sarah Radclyffe, point out that Laundrette was originally going to be a T.V. movie. They got their start with a music video company and wanted to work with film directors. To this end, they got them to direct videos and met Frears as a result. They also talk about how they got Laundrette made.

There is an interview with Oliver Stapleton, the films cinematographer. He got his start on music videos and talks about how he got involved with Laundrette. He also talks about working with Frears and his method of filmmaking.

1858316,5,B00008R9KF,"My Beautiful Laundrette stars Daniel Day-Lewis as Johnny, a homeless South London cockney street punk.
 Pakistani student Omar (Gordon Warnecke) convinces his wealthy uncle to let him take over and manage one of his money-losing enterprises, a laundry in a rough neighborhood. Omar elicits the help of former school pal Johnny, and as their plans for the business take shape, they fall in love.

 Director Stephen Frears doesnt treat this relationship as a big deal. Instead, he sets it against a background of racial divisiveness and economic desolation. Frears takes a disturbing look at the lives of Pakistanis in 1980s Great Britain. There are racial tensions between the Pakistanis themselves, such as those that divide Omar and his relatives, as well as tensions between the lower-class natives and the Pakistani immigrants.

From time to time Frears lightens the tone with humor. One of the pictures most amusing characters, Uncle Nasser (Saeed Jeffrey), is a collection of inconsistencies. Uncle Nasser is a successful businessman and a small-time racketeer who prides himself on being the patriarch of a large clan but nonetheless keeps an English mistress. Even as he flaunts his heritage, he has no compunction against evicting a fellow immigrant from an apartment if the rent is late. Mr. Jeffrey knows when the script offers opportunities for some fun and takes full advantage without undermining the films themes.

Day-Lewis (Lincoln, Gangs of New York) is an amazing actor who slips chameleon-like into his roles, with little resemblance between roles or performances. Hes outstanding here as the alienated product of poverty, joblessness, and racial animosity.

 Bonus features on the newly restored digital Blu-ray release include a new conversation between director Stephen Frears and producer Colin MacCabe; new interviews with writer Hanif Kureishi and the producers; theatrical trailer; and a critical essay.",1437350400,3,1929,5.431438127090301

1858332,3,B00008R9KF,"Not sure why this movie became a cult movie for some. It has some Humor (""I am a professional business man, not  a professional Pakistani"" was one I remember and many short similar exchanges), an overall unusual theme and not your standard movie (far from a Hollywood like feel), some interactions and dialogs treating racism and stereotypes which are I guess pluses.  I have rarely seen movies framed in an English suburbia with cultural clash. It is interesting as well to see how diverse Daniel Day-Lewis roles spanned over his carrier.
This being said, I am not one of those who will have an everlasting impression of this movie - nothing new and has far passed its time and novelty in my view and come short to treat fully and in depth either the difficulty of foreigners to get settled in a different country and even more remotely treating the nature of the relation between the characters.

1858379,4,B00008R9KF,"My Beautiful Laundrette is directed by Stephen Frears, the director behind one of my favorite films (Dangerous Liaisons) and several other good ones (High Fidelity, Mary Reilly, and The Queen to name a few). The film features an Oscar-nominated script by Hanif Kureishi and an early, stand-out performance by two-time Academy Award winner Daniel Day-Lewis (Best Actor, My Left Foot & There Will Be Blood).

The setting is a racially-tense neighborhood in Thatcher-ear London. Omar (Gordon Warnecke) is a young Pakistani who starts working for his uncle washing cars. Omar is soon allowed to run his uncle's shabby, run-down laundrette. It's around this time that Omar encounters childhood friend Johnny (Day-Lewis), a hood who runs with a small group of fascists who enjoy provoking racial violence. Omar hires Johnny to help up him fix up the laundrette with drug money he has stolen from his uncle's associate Salim.

It is soon revealed that Omar and Johnny are gay...And Salim discovers where his drugs went and Omar opens more laundrettes. None of these things will surprise you. They weren't meant to admittedly, but what this entire film seems to be is a rather complicated story told as a standard in a 94-minute timeframe.

The film's script follows a very linear plot. This, juxtaposed with the unnecessary changes in tone, makes the screenplay the weakest element of the film. It's a film that wants to explore themes of social and ethnic classes, as well as sexuality, but it never really says much on the subject. As if Kureishi knew these were important issues but didn't know why. It doesn't work as an exploration of these subjects and it's a rather complex story that had been formatted into a much more simplistic one. It made me question what exactly the screenwriter's intention was.

Beyond that, it's not particularly well-made. It has very dated near-grainy cinematography and some synthesizer music used as the score, which seems inappropriate in some of the scenes. Many films directed by Frears seem very dated due largely in part to his use of cinematography. ""Mary Reilly"" looks and feels much older than 1996 (this has nothing to do with its timeframe) and ""The Queen"" looks to glossy and done-up (another Miramax film called ""Casanova"" suffered the same problem).

If anything, I can see My Beautiful Laundrette causing a stir in 1985 when it was released especially with its depiction of Omar and Johnny's homosexual relationship. This brings me to my next subject...

This is not a gay-themed movie such as Brokeback Mountain. While ""Brokeback"" has a central theme of homosexuality and its very plot relies on it, My Beautiful Laundrette does not. It is not about two homosexual men but rather, two men who happen to be homosexual. If all the scenes of Omar and Johnny being intimate were removed from the film, it would have little or no effect on the overall story.

The best, most consistent thing about the film is the subtle, moving performance of Daniel Day-Lewis. This is not Bill the Butcher or Daniel Plainview; this is Day-Lewis in neutral. It's a performance that shows off his range as an actor and his ability to completely immerse himself in a role, big or small. He's one of the few well-known actors who walk on-screen and allow you to instantly identify the character rather than the actor. I can imagine Day-Lewis viewing that as a compliment of the highest order.

My Beautiful Laundrette is not a powerful, profound, or particularly moving film. It is neither a failure nor any real kind of achievement. It does not require an audience nor is it undeserving of one. It's simply there. Neither good nor bad, neither entertaining nor boring, but available...Should you decide to watch it.

B-

Side-Note: Hanif Kureishi did write the screenplay for one of my favorite movies of the last few years, ""Venus"" with Peter O'Toole. This is a film that wanted to explore a particular subject (in this case, death, among other things) and succeeded.",1236816000,4,3991,4.943283582089553
1858380,5,B00008R9KF,"The film covers a short period of time in the life of Omar, a young Pakistani living in London in the 80's. His father is a brilliant, well educated socialist who was famous back home but is a nobody there, so he has taken to his bed with a bottle of vodka.  His hope is in Omar, and he expects him to go to college to understand the evils of society. Meanwhile, though they need cash and he calls on his successful  brother, Nassar to give Omar a summer job in one of his many businesses.

We watch Omar as he gains favor with Nassar and gets to manage one of his run down laundrettes in a poor area of the city.  He wants to follow in his uncle's footsteps and make a lot of money.  The plot thickens as he runs into an old childhood friend, Johnny, a lower class native Brit who has turned into a petty criminal and hangs out with a group of racist skinhead types.  We follow Omar as he deals with the various personalities in the extended family, including a female cousin who has her eye on him.

Omar persuades Johnny to help him turn the laundrette into something spectacular and the project gives the film its center.  We see squalor turned into beauty as the two boys realize their dream and meanwhile we see them fall in love with each other. It's not a simple success story, though, and they have to contend with enemies in both groups--the Pakistani family and the skinheads.

There is so much richness in this small, unpretentious, made for TV film...themes of class distinction, political views, sexuality, roles of women as well as race.  The film just tells the story without preaching at us.  I found myself rooting for each of them, at one time or another, with the exception of the totally vile Salim.  The acting is terrific and Daniel Day Lewis will grab your heart. And even though there is plenty to worry us as the plot unfolds, I found myself feeling good at the end. A very human film.",1218153600,3,1911,4.367231638418079
1858381,4,B00008R9KF,"I suppose people either love this film or hate it....

The basic plot was a guy trying to do something in his life in a somewhat confusing world, were everything was not to his advantage.  Omar, a son of Pakistani immigrant, who up until the start of the movie, didn't have any direction in life.  We don't know about his history, but it'll unfold later in the movie.  We learned he is gay, and was a troublemaker when he was younger.

Anyways..., I suppose some people don't like how this movie rambles.  I for one, hate it when I sense the author of a book (or in this case, filmmaker) can't seem to make up his/her mind.  I don't think in this movie the direction is lost (it actually works for some odd reason).  The movie is sort of a snapshot of life going through a phase.  This is realism.  I suppose it won't satisfy people who like a grand plot that's meticulously devised.

Also keep in mind the movie was from the 80's when most movies' plots were thin like paper.  There are some dialogues that don't connect too well.  In general though, it's pretty good if you put the era into perspective.

Memorable characters....  This is a very difficult thing to do in a movie or a book.  I like how real the characters seem to be.  Not fake, not exaggerated malevolent or divinely benign.  They have their own self interests.  There is few political agenda in characters' dialogue (e.g., let's beautify gay people, or let's do an anti-discrimination theme).  No, they are just real people.  They don't speak words directly to the audience and feed us ideas.  They earn out affection by being themselves, not ""I am gay and Pakistani, so you owe me something.""  If you want melodrama, look elsewhere.  (And people say I am melodramatic... ;-))

I love the ending; very cute and affectionate.  Leave an imprint on me without shock value or sensual eroticism.  You'd think after Johnny (Daniel Day-Lewis) got beaten up, you'd hear some grunt about life and injustice in general.  No..., we are rewarded with a scene where Omar tried to clean Johnny's wound and they ended up not ""I'm sorry, but let's have sex"" but two guys, very innocently splash water at each other.  That's VERY original (though I sensed Day-Lewis was about to take his pants off...).  I challenge you to write a scene like that.

Life moves on, you know.  I am happy the movie doesn't give a self-pity, wound-licking ending.  (I apologize for being so unprofessional in this review.  LOL!)",1193270400,11,2461,4.607390300230947

1858386,5,B00008R9KF,"Before My Beautiful Launderette, Daniel Day Lewis was a nobody.  Afterwards, he was a force to contend with (four years later he would be an Oscar winner).

Omar (Saeed Jaffrey) is an unemployed guy who lives with his dad in a council flat in Lambeth.  But he wants to be more like his wealthy Uncle Nasar.  Uncle gives him a start by offering him a job to manage a Laundromat.  But this Laundromat is a dump and there is a string attached, Omar must date his cousin.

To make some extra money, Omar delivers drugs for another cousin. Omar decides to spruce the Laundromat up and enlists his friend Johnny (DDL).  Johnny comes up with an idea of skimming some of the drugs to fund the upgrades.  They reopen the luxury Laundromat and it is a hit.

The problem with dating his cousin is that Omar is in love with someone else, Johnny.  This is deftly handled and it hits you from the blindside.

This film is great from many different directions.  It shows insight into the Pakistani culture and the poor of London in the early 80's.

This is a great performance by Daniel Day Lewis and everyone should see it!

1858387,5,B00008R9KF,"Stephen Frears paid a felt tribute in Fassbinder' s memory through this picture. This launderette is an authentic micro cosmos that allowed to join two well opposite personalities so different in attitudes and particular ambitions.

Somehow S.F. continues exploring the advanced roads initiated by his predecessor; and even Frears lacks of the human touch that became a true landmark in Rainer, he achieves a mature film that focuses and handles the complex ambiguity of this couple in London.",1134950400,2,493,5.32051282051282
1858388,1,B00008R9KF,"Seriously, I can't believe my eyes. This film has received an average vote of 4.5 out of 5!?!? I was in the cinema tonight, watching this movie at the Gay & Lesbian film festival with my boyfriend and two friends, and this was WITHOUT EXCEPTION THE WORST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN! Why? For the following reasons:

1. The STORY - or lack of same - is HORRIBLE. Not just bad, but horrible. Someone should have told the author that when you write a story you need to: a) Have something on your mind that you want to tell the reader/receiver; b) have a red line in the movie that connects the scenes, persons and events; and c) reach a conclusion in the end of the story. Unfortunately, story has neither. The events are totally rambled up, the focus seems to be moved at least a dozens of times during the (all to long) length of the movie, sudden events come without any purpose, explanation or, worst of all, point.

2. The ACTING is INCREDIBLY LOUSY. Nothing really more to be said. Daniell Day Lewis looks nice, but the acting is just so incredibly amateur-like that I couldn't believe it.

3. The DIALOGUE is Awful. There was one - ONE - line in the whole

movie that actually worked (when the uncle says ""I'm a professional businessman, not a professional Pakisthani."" The rest just screams 'I'm an 11 year old trying to write a screenplay'.

4. The CUTTING is - I'm running out of bad words hear, so I'll just stick to horrible, cause that pretty much sums it up. When the cutting is done well you won't really notice it, but in this movie the cutting is done in all the wrong places - either too soon or too late.

On the bottom line, you might think: There might be some redeeming qualities, there must be something good to say about this movie. But there's not. Sorry. But I have nothing good to say. It just downright horrible. And no, I'm not homophobic since I'm gay, so pleasy don't bring that one up.

1 out of 5. That's a minimum. Would give 0 if I could. Avoid at all cost.",1130025600,15,1983,4.3432432432432435

1858400,5,B00008R9KF,"A Pakistani (Gordon Warnecke) in England befriends a Briton (Daniel Day-Lewis) and together, despite their racial differences, open up a laundrette. The two young men become lovers, which is kept secret from everyone else. Warnecke's father wants him to go to college, which adds to his pressures, but that is nothing compared to the racial tensions brought about by the anti-Pakistan street gangs that both boys face together. Extremely well acted with an intelligent script, despite being rather depressing.",1111190400,4,509,5.455696202531645
1858401,5,B00008R9KF,"I've seen few films with such intensity, humour and heartache all rolled into one.  The scenes flowed onto each other seamlessly, the plot complex yet perfectly led, and the Acting was just superb.
Daniel Day Lewis was unforgettable as the rough street punk Johnny, while Gordon Warnecke was equally engaging as Omar, the Pakistani boy with big ambitions.  Another stand-out was Roshan Seth, playing a drunken disgruntled Pakistani father, with no hope, no future, and little life left in his alcohol weakened body.  Seth stole the scene wherever he appeared, and not just because of the hair, seriously.
The fact that this film is partly about the relationship between two men had absolutely no influence on me as an audience.  To the people watching, it is as natural to them as it is for the two main characters on the silver screen.
At times, it is heartbreaking to watch the hatred and misunderstanding between two races living on the same land.  But what do 2 boys with a beautiful laundrette care anyway, for them, each day is a brand new day isn't it?",1069027200,12,1059,4.7650273224043715
1858402,5,B00008R9KF,"Originally intended only as a television feature film, MBL is one of the quietest but stirring movies you will see.
The story is about one Pakistani man (Warnecke) and a long time Englishman friend (Day-Lewis) who both live on the wrong side of the tracks as they grope for success in a world replete with multiple forms of discrimination -- racism, sexism, groupism, homophobia, cultural elitism, snobbery, reverse colonialism, neocolonialism and fascism -- which they successfully grapple and topple in the form of their launderette with the power of economic enterprise.
These squabbling goblins are left to each others excesses as economic success lifts them up and out of these, but many questions remain: will they subsist? Would others succeed; What does luck have to do with it?
Kureshi had [upset] all groups who find themselves part of this smashing satire, prime among them the identity conscious confused second/third generation subcontinental British kids, the same contingency that staunchly supported the Rushdie fatwa (the kind also sharply profiled in ""My son, the fanatic"").

1858403,4,B00008R9KF,"Reading the names of lists that ""My Beautiful Laundrette"" is listed on it struck me how everyone notices this movie because it has 2 gay characters... Most of the titles were something like ""Must-own gay movies"" ""Good starts to your [gay] movie collection""....
  By making ""MBL"" into purely a ""gay"" movie, these people take all the complexities of the movie that goes beyond the sexualities of the characters. There are so many themes within ""MBL"": 1980's London, the social friction and racism, the failling economy, the corrupt business practices, the consequences of Pakistanis (or any immigrants I suppose) trying to either become British or keep their heritage.....
  This movie isn't a chronicle of Johnny and Omar's relationship. Their relationship is merely one thread in the movie. The characters within this movie can't be labeled into general groups so the actual movie thatt contains them should be seen same way.

1858404,5,B00008R9KF,"I just watched this movie twice in the last twelve hours, and as I couldn't stop thinking about it, I thought I would write a review. For me the thing that makes ""My Beautiful Laundrette"" so memorable is the intentional ambiguity of the film. When you have finished watching it, you're not sure what exactly the director is trying to say to you - this is not a shallow Hollywood creation. The movie paints stunning portraits of race relations between the Pakistani and English denizens of London, the conflict between women and men, between the working and middle classes, between fascists and communists, the independent-minded, and the family-oriented, the straight and the gay. But the movie doesn't focus on any of one of these issues and presents, instead, a collage that is more composed of questions than answers.
  Also amazing is the movie's depiction of a gay relationship - the film doesn't dwell on the sexual orientation of its characters, it simply presents them as they are, with no commentary of any sort - there is no coming out, no discussing ""the relationship"", and no tears. Nor do words like gay or queer even appear in the film. The boys' physicality acts instead as a backdrop to the other events and thoughts in the movie, complicating matters further. Scenes depicting emotion are beautifully written and filmed, as is everything else in the movie, but ""My Beautiful Laundrette"" seems to have been able to show something Hollywood has yet to: that The Relationship is not always the focus of life, wether it be straight, gay, or indifferent.",1058659200,11,1566,4.883458646616542
1858405,5,B00008R9KF,"I've been waiting a very long time to be able to add Stephen Frears' wonderful, independent film ""My Beautiful Laundrette"" to my DVD collection. I'm overjoyed to once again view this well written, 'slice of life' comedy/drama. The movie casts a sharp and critical, socio-political, eye on Margret Thatcher's England of the 1980's. In the film we meet Omar (Gordon Warnecke) a young man, who is a poor relation to a wealthy Pakistani family, living in England. Omar's rather  unscrupulous, Uncle (Saeed Jaffrey)decides to do him a favor and take him into the family business. He allows Omar to make a go of an old, broken down, laundrette, which is blithley described as a ""toilet"".At first Omar seems quiet, polite and attenative. But as the film goes on we find out, that he is quite a character. He isn't one to just push a broom around and watch the laundrette fail. He has big dreams for both the establishment and his financial future. Omar enlists the help of his white, working class, pal and gay lover, Johnny (brilliantly played by a young, Daniel Day-Lewis)to make the future happen now. Together the two craftily (and illegally) finance and fix up, what can only be described as the 'Disneyland' of Laundrettes. Director,Stephen Frear's movie humoursly presents Omar's speedy rise into the business world. But it is also rather melancholic in tone and touches on a variety of serious subjects, which includes everything from politics to race relations to economic policy. The cast of the movie is fantastic and the standouts include Saeed Jaffrey as Omar's amoral, Uncle Nasser and Roshan Seth as his socialist, alcholic father. Daniel Day-Lewis is superb in his star making, nuanced performance as a gay, working class, tough guy. The DVD remaster of the film is adequate, but has little in extras. It is a movie that is just begging for a director's commentary!""My Beautiful Laundrette"" is a wonderfully entertaining film, which leaves the viewer with plenty to think about.

1858406,5,B00008R9KF,"I have been griping for over a year about ""the powers that be"" putting this incredible classic on DVD, and finally here it is -the British dramedy ""My Beautiful Laundrette"" is more than just a love story where the love is between two men; this film will make you laugh, make your eyes well with tears, and make you angry as it explores the working classes of England, as well as the racial tensions that exist between white and Pakistani people there.  It's touching, funny, romantic, charming, and full of heart.  Most of all, it's very real; many people today may freak at the sight of a young, punkish Daniel Day Lewis passionately (and I mean PASSIONATELY) kissing/making love with another man (the beautiful Gordon Warnecke), but if you can get past that, you nearly forget you are watching a movie - the characters are that real, your ability to care for them that real.

1858408,4,B00008R9KF,"This film deals with the problems of races and classes in London. But this film doesn't provoke me to anger as in Hollywood films. This film (and it may sound unusual to people who have seen My Beautiful Launderette) is beautiful and calm to me: the growing love between Johnny and Omar, the squelching sounds of their funky launderette, the aqua color, the questions that the film raises -- to me these are very impressive and seductive and calming. But my focus will be on the women. There are four women in the film: Tanya (Nassir's daughter. Nassir is Omar's uncle), Rachel (Nassir's mistress) and Omar's mother (she is talked about by Omar and Nassir in the course of the film). Nassir thinks that for people like them, Pakistani-British, their position in England is determined by wealth. The film focuses on how and others in the family want to make money. But the women don't have any money. They are dependant on the menfolk, completely. Tanya blames Rachel for living like a parasite on her father and which is the truth. But Tanya herself, a grown woman, close to Omar's age lives off her father as well. She could have helped her father in business as she points out to Omar. But business belongs to men. Nassir would give the business to his brother's son (Omar), not to his own daughter. Money and who controls it is a powerful subject in the film. Women in it don't have money and are therefore weak and powerless. At a family party, at Nassir's house, women are separated from men. Women are in a open and bright living room. There is laughter and talk there. But we (spectators) are not able to hear them. Their conversations are unclear and not translated into English. (They are speaking Urdu -- the language spoken in Pakistan).
Men on the other hand, seem to talk about important things in dark corners of the room. And it seems like women are forbidden to enter this place. Tanya defies this. When Omar first visits Nassir's house, Tanya shows defiance by lifting her sweater and exposing her breast to Omar. She is standing outside the house, and through the window lifts her sweater to unnerve Omar.
I have sympathy for Omar's mother. We got only ghostly glimpses of her from Omar and Omar's father, a journalist and activist is disillusioned by Britain. He vents his pent up anger and frustrations on her wife. Finally, she can't endure any more, and throws herself on a railway track. In traditional eastern families (and this includes India, Korea, and other eastern countries), a husband's violence on his wife is tolerated as his right. His wife is thought of as a part of her husband's possession. And when a husband keeps a mistress, she can't oppose it. But if she were to have a boyfriend, she would be kicked out of the patriarchal husband's house. In My Beautiful Launderette, I find women in this Pakistani-British family neglected. They are powerless, rejected, dependent, and victims of men. At the end of the film, Tanya leaves her father's house. She is the first one to resist against a system of patriarchy. Her father is stunned, anguished.",1049673600,13,3083,4.711111111111111

7986358,2,B00008R9KF,"I saw the video in a library, and remembered the title from decades ago. So how good was the movie, and what was it supposed to be about? The description on the case made it sound intriguing.

And the movie actually started out interestingly enough. Omar is a teenager who is part of a family from Pakistan in the Margaret Thatcher era. He is told by his alcoholic former journalist father to get a job and off the dole before he goes to college. Omar works at washing cars for an uncle who is involved in criminal rackets, before said uncle has him managing a grimy, low-class laundromat. Finding a white childhood friend who had fallen in with racist unemployed street punks, Omar hires him to help with the laundromat, as well as protect him from local thugs. A new wrinkle occurs when Omar and his friend suddenly become gay lovers who do a lot of French kissing.

Presumably this was meant to be a social message movie, but a contrived storyline and characters we do not like or care about bring things down. The sudden emergence of the gay relationship is unconvincing and seems to have been put it for shock value rather than making a genuine point about homosexuality (some gay reviewers were unhappy with this movie). Also the uncle's success came from being in the rackets rather than hard work and diligence. Is the point of the movie that Pakistani immigrants are fundamentally crooked, or immigrants cannot make it in Britain through honest work? Nobody in this movie comes across in a good light-including the people who made the movie. How this movie has been well-regarded is anybody's guess.",1499644800,,1608,4.698581560283688
