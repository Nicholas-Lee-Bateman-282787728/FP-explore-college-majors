7930353,2,B000053SNU,"""The Royal Mounted Rides Again"" is a plodding and convoluted serial from Universal. Talky--but we expect that in a Universal serial. More emphasis on plot than action--okay, that's another Universal characteristic. But, several key events take place off camera and then are only referenced by the soporific dialogue, thus contributing to the confusion. The whole thing feels as though it were being rewritten while it was being filmed. Added to this problem is the poor sound quality, which frequently makes the dialogue sound as if it had been recorded on oatmeal.

The cast is another problem. The first name in the cast is George Dolenz, who plays a grammatically challenged Mountie with a phony Quebecois accent. The name of the leading actor/hero, Bill Kennedy, comes second. Why list the leading actor after the guy playing the comic relief? Does that tell you something? Other actors of more quality--including Milburn Stone and Robert Armstrong--follow in the cast list. And we have the frequent problem that Bill Kennedy's Corporal Wayne Decker keeps getting blown up or thrown from a horse-drawn buggy going over a cliff at the end of cliffhanger, only to stand up, dust off his uniform, and walk away from the peril at the beginning of the next episode. This is the same problem posed by Columbia's wretched 1940 serial ""The Shadow""--buildings are constantly collapsing on Lamont Cranston, but he never gets hurt. Not even a scratch or a dollop of schmutz on his black cape!

And poor Rondo Hatton--the actor with that unforgettably ugly face--who sits in the same chair in the same position in the same saloon for at least ten episodes without a word of dialogue or even a raised eyebrow. Every time the action switches to the saloon, there he is, doing absolutely nothing. What a waste!

I really enjoy the old movie chapterplays, and I have a lot of tolerance for improbable plot lines and predictable cliffhangers, but this one really tested my faith. The overly complex plot line involving a fortune teller who is really the friend of the daughter of the mine owner who was killed by god only knows who and the Mountie who hates his father who is the unsympathetic owner of the rival copper mine which has a tunnel connecting it to the gold mine . . . Well, you get the idea.

If you love serials and can even stand Columbia Catastrophes such as ""The Adventures of Sir Galahad"" or the interminably awful ""Captain Video,"" then go ahead and mount up with the Royal Mounted--but be prepared to drink a lot of coffee to help you stay awake while you try to figure out what's going on. Otherwise, life is too short. Send the Royal Mounted back to the stables.",1377388800,,2670,4.785249457700651
7930354,2,B000053SNU,"I'm a sucker for old movie serials and when I saw that this one had Milburn Stone in it I grabbed it quick.  The story involves a mining town in Canada and a discovery of a hidden gold mine, Milburn Stone actually plays the chief bad guy, generally in these serials he is the hero for which he is much better suited.  Robert Armstrong also usually a good guy does a turn as a baddie.  The biggest concern about this release is the quality of the video.  I had to try to get it to play on two different machines, about half way through it just stopped playing and I had to go to the chapters to get it to finish.  Get this one with caution.  It's not the best serial out there by a long shot and it looks like this release was put together very quickly and poorly.",1371513600,,763,4.053333333333334
7930355,4,B000053SNU,"""The Royal Mounted Rides Again"" is a 13-chapter serial released by Universal in 1945, directed by Ray Taylor and Lewis D. Collins, with original screenplay by Joseph O'Donnell, Tom Gibson and Harold C. Wire.

The story takes place in Northwest Canada, near the Alaska border, around 1900.  At Canaska, mining company owner Jackson Decker (Addison Richards) sends the manager of his
copper mine, Brad Taggart (Milburn Stone) to buy, at any price, milling machinery from miner Tom Bailey (Guy Beach).  Bailey is unwilling to sell, since he has just discovered a rich vein of gold, and learning that no one else knows of the find Taggart shoots Bailey.  But Taggart is careless in disposing of the body; some gold nuggets are found in the dead man's pockets, starting a gold rush in Canaska.  The tunnel to the strike has to be blown up so it won't be located from Bailey's mine, delaying recovery of the gold by several serial movie chapters.  Corporal Wayne (Bill Kennedy) is investigating the murder, even though he is really Decker's son, chosen for his understanding of mining operations.  He is helped by Constable ""Frenchy"" Moselle (George Dolenz).  Soon Bailey's daughter June (Daun Kennedy) arrives, assuring everyone that Decker is the murderer, which is the prevailing attitude owing to his aggressive business practices.  She restarts the mill on her late father's property, to be run by Lode MacKenzie (Tom Fadden).  This is done in cooperation with the Mounties, who hope to track any raw gold that comes from Bailey's find by matching it with the nuggets found on his body.  But our bad guys busy themselves trying to avoid detection by blowing up properties, creating landslides, forest fires and generally being a real nuisance, while they try to tunnel through to the gold pocket from Decker's copper mine.

For those who like serials with simple plots, clearly defined good and evil characters, and little dialogue -- this isn't the right choice.  As a serial about the Mounties it could use more action, but considered as a Universal Western it isn't bad at all, and there are no attacks by Indians.  The cliffhangers aren't as elaborate as those in Republic's serials, but compensate by not dominating the plot, which is already burdened with complications typical of Universal serials.  In addtion to Taggart, there is a crooked saloon owner, Jonathan Price (Robert Armstrong) and his dealer, Eddie ""Dancer"" Clare (Danny Morton) who has some talents beyond cards.  June Bailey's friend, Dille Clark (Helen Bennett) is
pretending to be a fortune teller, Madame Mysterioso, to help spread rumors of Jackson Decker's guilt.  And another mysterious character, Latitude Bucket (Paul E. Burns) seems to be working on all sides simultaneously.  Taggart's chief henchman is Bunker (Joseph Haworth) with help from Kent, Grail and Archer (George Lloyd, George Eldridge and William Haade).  Inside the saloon near the office, maybe guarding the place or maybe asleep is Bull Andrews (Rondo Hatton), whose ominous features are best known from his role as the ""Hoxton Creeper"" in the 1944 Sherlock Holmes film ""The Pearl of Death.""  There is even a pair of characters, Division Superintendent MacDondald and Sergeant Ladue (Selmer Jackson and Daral Hudson) who get screen credit, but who are there mostly for the acted-out chapter introductions that Universal thought better than spoken narration or printed text.  While these add to the already talk-filled chapters they are fairly short in this serial.

Bill Kennedy isn't exactly a memorable actor, and his partner, George Dolenz isn't a lot better, but the needs here are not great, and both look fine in Mountie uniforms.  We get a stronger characterization from their boss, Sergeant Nelson (Joseph Crehan), Wayne's father Jackson Decker (Addison Richards) and certainly from Milburn Stone and Paul E. Burns.  And it wouldn't be a Universal serial without stock footage, including horse-drawn fire wagons that might have been in actual use when filmed.  We also get some of the ""lumber camp"" footage, used in the 1936 serial ""Adventures of Frank Merriwell"" and doubtless old at that time.  But most of this is well-integrated with the new footage.

VCI's edition, # 8483 is on a single DVD.  The source print is better than many from 1940's Universal serials, though a little mysterious.  The main title lacks both ""presenter"" credit and copyright, and the image isn't especially sharp.  The rest of the titles, and the chapters themselves are better, properly framed with little in the way of ""dirt"" or scratches, and the gray scale is good.  The sound is clear, with adequate frequency response and little noise, though some ""sprocket buzz"" is occasionally heard.  After the opening title, with a still-frame background, the rest of the credits look like the originals, but the transition to them puts a speed glitch in the sound.  The same copy of the credits is used on all chapters, with MPPDA certificate number 10997.  All of the ""next week"" titles appear to have been created for the video edition, not in the style used by Universal in 1945, failing to mention the next chapter number and even calling it an ""episode.""  Authenticity of the chapter titles is suspect; Chapter 12 is identified as ""Twenty Dollar Double Cross"" while the lobby card shown on the package and in the ""Photo Gallery"" has ""Doublecross"" as a single word.

""Extras"" are not numerous; the ""Photo Gallery"" consists of three pictures, the above-mentioned lobby card, a posed picture of Daun Kennedy and Bill Kennedy, and one production still picture with the two Mounties and Lode MacKenzie with Latitude Bucket.  There are ""Bio's"" of Lewis D. Collins, Ray Taylor, Bill Kennedy and Milburn Stone.  The only other item is a ""Cliff Hanger Promo"" with short clips from trailers used to advertise VCI's serial releases.

While Universal made better serials, this one holds up fairly well if approached with the right expectations.  There are some well-known cast members, the plot has interesting twists and even the recap dialogue doesn't seem too redundant when watched with at least a day between chapters.  VCI's print is decent, the sound is clear and the price is reasonable.  A good release, especially for serial fans.",1312416000,,6262,5.0751953125
7930356,5,B000053SNU,"Universal has the reputation of delivering plodding serials. I disagree. They just add more plot than Republic or Columbia, and in the strange world of serials, this seems to slow things down a little. But fans of Universal love their serials being treated in a more respectible fashion, more like an actual feature film.
Addison Richards, usually a bad-guy boss, plays the falsely accused father of our mountie hero and Milburn Stone, usually a hero in Universal serials, plays the no-good bad-guy!!! Bill Kennedy is a bland hero-type mountie and George Dolenz plays his equally bland sidekick Frenchy!!!
Character actor Paul E. Burns plays a shady character named Latitude Bucket. You never know for sure who's side he's on and he's fun to watch, pretty much stealing every scene he's in! Robert (KING KONG) Armstrong is another baddie and Ray Taylor, an old hand at these things, directs.
All-in-all, this is an interesting, well-made romp down memory lane for vetern serial watchers. Good stuff all 'round. Recommended.",1195776000,5,1023,5.131736526946108
7930357,1,B000053SNU,"Growing up, I caught the tail end of the movie serial era.  I have fond memories of a number of
Republic and Columbia serials and any with Mounties were among my favorite. Royal Mounted Rides again
was one that I had never seen, so I purchased the vhs.  I would rate this as the worst
of the Mountie serials. The plotline was very plodding and I found the characters, including the lead
lacking in interest. I like to watch serials a chapter at a time (just as in the movie theaters), but
I was often tempted to fast forward through several chapters.  The picture and sound quality of
the vhs is also poor which also diminished my interest.  Wally Cox, surfer dude, DC.",1189555200,3,669,4.414634146341464
