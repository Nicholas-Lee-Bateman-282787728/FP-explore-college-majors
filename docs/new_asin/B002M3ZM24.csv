8373522,4,B002M3ZM24,"Early in World War II, General George Marshall, Army Chief of Staff, desired to give the ordinary American soldier more knowledge about why the United States was battling Germany, Italy, and Japan.  Many soldiers did not have advanced schooling.  While they were growing up during the Great Depression, they had to focus on school and work to help their families, so many had paid little attention to matters outside the United States.  General Marshall asked Frank Capra to make a series of seven ""orientation"" films.  Capra was a famous Hollywood director who had joined the Army soon after the attack on Pearl Harbor.

The sixth film in the ""Why We Fight"" series was ""The Battle of China.""  It was released in 1944 and shown to recruits and soldiers.  It was also seen by war workers and civilians in the United States and in other countries.

The footage in this film was not shot especially for this film, which is a ""compilation documentary.""  Lieutenant Colonel Capra and his team mostly used newsreel film that had been shot by civilian journalists in China (and Japan) in the 1930s and 1940s.  Footage was also drawn from the U.S. National Archives, the Library of Congress, the Museum of Modern Art, and the Army Pictorial Center.  Films from Allied Governments and those captured from the Axis were also used in the productions.  These films were arranged and rearranged to explain official U.S. policy on the causes of the war and toward the Allied and Axis powers.

For these reasons, the ""Battle of China"" and other films in the ""Why We Fight"" series are often watched in university classes on mass communications as an example of films that aims to persuade -- or as ""propaganda.""  However the film is categorized, it aimed to demonstrate why America needed to support China, and why China was an ally that deserved American support.  A few historical notes:

Critics of the film point out that it provides a wartime snapshot of American views, without the benefit of the work of historians after the war.  Also, to explain complicated issues in an hour's time, the film simplifies -- perhaps oversimplifies -- some complicated matters.  For instance, while the Republic of China under Chiang Kai-shek had many accomplishments, many pluses, it also had many minuses - for instance, the terrible corruption that eventually eroded its support by ordinary Chinese.  ""The Battle of China"" shows all the pluses, but not the minuses.

Chinese viewers ask why there are no scenes of Communist forces that were also fighting the Japanese.  There are at least three  reasons.  (1)  Chongqing (then called ""Chungking,"" the location of General Stilwell's headquarters) and Kunming (the site of General Chennault's headquarters) were in the areas of China controlled by the Nationalists.  (2)  Americans coming into China ""over the Hump"" from India came into southwest China where the Nationalist armies were fighting.  (3)  The United States was working with China's national government.  The scenes in the film that describe the fighting ""behind the lines,"" however, implicitly acknowledge the contribution of the Communist forces.

One other problem with the film is that Capra and his team made frequent reference to a ""Tanaka Memorial"" to explain Japan's plans for conquest.  Subsequent research by historians has demonstrated that the so-called ""Memorial"" was not authentic.

This is, however, a serious film.  It brought together in a compelling way footage of China that had previously been seen in only bits and snatches in newsreels.  The narrative line about the differences between China's and Japan's modern history now seems forced to fit the film's purposes, but it could be the starting point for a good discussion and a better, more nuanced analysis.  Its footage of the Nationalist armies fighting the Japanese could prompt a review of the war in China and the many criticisms of Chiang and the KMT.  The movement of Chinese to Chongqing (""Chungking"") is another historical drama, captured in the film, worth remembering.

And there's this:  An elderly Chinese-American recalled that before World War II many Americans had a prejudiced attitude toward the Chinese living in America, thinking of them as laundrymen or ""coolies.""  The alliance during the war did much to change those attitudes, he said.  Americans saw the bravery of the Chinese people as they faced Japanese aggression, and they began to change their minds.  It may have been films like ""The Battle of China,"" showing China's resistance, that helped them do so.
