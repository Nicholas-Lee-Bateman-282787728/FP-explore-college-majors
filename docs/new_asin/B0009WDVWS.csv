I found the slow motion replay to be very helpful, and beneficial to my training. And I feel it would be helpful to anyone else interested in this type of Chinese Kung Fu. The late Ark Y. Wong was a phenomenal teacher/master of the art! Which by the way if anyone is wondering, this kind of Kung Fu is known as ""Sil Lum Kung Fu"". For those of you who don't know what that means, Sil Lum is the Cantonese pronunciation for ""Shaolin"". Shaolin Kung Fu hails from northern China, which means it's repetoire has more weapons, and more intricate kicking techniques ( jumping kicks, high kicks and flying kicks, etc. ). Whereas southern Shaolin, or Sil Lum to be precise, tends to have more deeper stances then its northern counterpart. And not so much emphasis on kicking techniques. But don't worry, obviously it has kicks in its repetoire, of course it has kicking techniques!! It wouldn't be a true Kung Fu system if it didn't! There is no such thing as the supposed best kind of Kung Fu system around. No such thing, it would be ignorant to proclaim such a thing. So if your wondering if Sil Lum Kung Fu is the right system of Kung Fu for you? Well..... I can't tell you. I feel it would be bias, immoral and just plain wrong for me to say that this is the perfect system of Kung Fu for you. I'm afraid if you wanna find out if this is the right kind of Kung Fu for you? You'll have to do it the same way I had to find out, the old fashioned way. Going out -- asking questions -- reading the books and yes, buying the teaching materials ( such as this video ) if you truly want to know if it's right for you, rather if it's the ultimate type of Kung Fu! Just to note, there are rigorous types of Kung Fu systems with a heavy emphasis on training, giving sweaty workouts! Harder, rigorous, or aggressive types of Kung Fu, don't always equate the best type of Kung Fu systems around, just different. Again, personally; I highly recommend this DVD. Get it! You won't regret it!!",1453334400,2,2112,4.3224181360201515
8067992,2,B0009WDVWS,"It's very interesting to see Ark Wong's forms. Even just seeing them is interesting and informative. His style is clearly southern chinese in origin. Simplicity rules over fancy maneuvers, which to my mind is a good thing.  On the other hand, this is the second time I'm buying this material. The first DVD I owned (Volume I) was plagued by ""damaged sections"" that made much of the material unavailable on any of my DVD players or computer.  Recently I bought volumes I and II and matters were better, but Vol II had a ""damaged section"" that prevented me seeing all of the three section staff.  I think this indicates poor quality reproduction on the part of the manufacturer. To buy 3 DVD's and have two have problems is not a good percentage! Yamazato has put out very interesting historical footage, but may have a quality control problem...",1326240000,,844,4.727891156462585
