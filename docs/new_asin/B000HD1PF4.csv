2634483,4,B000HD1PF4,"A watched this many times before my own circumnavigation and enjoyed the scenes, as well as the music.  However, after the recent viewing, I felt there were a number of topics that could have been touched on that could have provided a bit more insight to the adventure.

2634488,5,B000HD1PF4,Delightful Movie for anyone wondering what it would be like to cut the lines and set sail with the family! The effort put forward to make this film is quite amazing.,1404950400,,165,4.354838709677419
2634489,4,B000HD1PF4,the story and  pictures were beautiful the quality of filming was not bad for home made. all in all I liked the movie.,1403827200,,118,4.130434782608695
2634490,1,B000HD1PF4,"Watching this is pretty much like being forced to watch your braggy neighbor's vacation video.  It is slow, there is no sound other than dubbed over music and odd narrative.  Like others, I would have loved to learned the nuts and bolts of day to day life on a small sailboat with two teenage boys, a young daughter, and mom and dad.  I am proud that I managed to slog through to the end but being sick with a fever it didn't require much mental thought to watch.  Really, in that case, perfect for a day home with the flu.  I would like a refund, though.  I cannot believe Amazon would charge for this!",1402444800,,603,4.245614035087719
2634491,5,B000HD1PF4,"Really liked the show, kind of a throw back to the era where things kind of move slowly without a need to rush.",1402358400,,111,3.869565217391304
2634492,5,B000HD1PF4,"I loved every minute of this, and felt like I was on the adventure with the family.  Thanks for sharing!",1392595200,,104,4.2
2634493,4,B000HD1PF4,"The movie highlights the multi-year circumnavigation by a family in their sailboat.  The movie starts in Hawaii after leaving California and describes the trip across the Pacific with three young children, stopping at several Pacific islands, Australia, South Aftrica, and on to Atlantic islands, Caribbean islands, the Panama canal passage and on home to California.  It is primarily a travelogue of the trip with very little discussion regarding sailing, boat maintenance, home schooling or any of the sundry problems associated with a massive undertaking such as this.  Compacting the voyage into a 90 minute movie would be a herculean effort alone.

 This is a very pleasant movie. The photography is very good and it's fun to watch the children grow up during the trip. If you are a sailor or a traveler, you will enjoy this.",1392595200,,830,5.073529411764706
2634494,5,B000HD1PF4,"I would recommend this video to anyone considering cruising, whether you ever get to sail around the world in a classic sailboat or not.

This high rating is because this video has been an inspiration since we started sailing in earnest (back in the days of VHS).

The video is like watching the adventures of the Driscoll family. It is nicely produced, and I have watched it many times. The Sea Witch has recently showed up for sale at a local marina, so we went to see it, and we watched the video again.",1391644800,,506,4.372340425531915
2634495,2,B000HD1PF4,"Old, out dated. Not much about sailing. Some things dragged on for much to long. Not much to show for a 5 year trip around the world.",1388966400,,133,3.962962962962963
2634496,5,B000HD1PF4,"Most of us can dream of taking such a voyage.  For us dreamers, this movie helps to bring it to reality.

You can tell that it was filmed sometime perhaps in the 70's.  That does not hinder the beauty and enchantment in any way, nor does it detract from the wonderful experiences encountered by the family of 5 along the way.

The movie is complete with fantastic shots of their beautiful ketch ""Sea Witch"" under way, raising sail and doing what she does best, sailing the seas.

Highly recommended for anyone even remotely interested in sailing.",1383782400,,546,4.645833333333333
2634497,1,B000HD1PF4,I don't know why Amazon offers this 30+ year old home movie. I only made it 25 minutes and unless it got drastically better after the start it really is bad.,1377993600,,157,4.096774193548387
2634498,3,B000HD1PF4,I would have liked to see more time on the boat vs on islands. I thought it was going to be more about life onboard a boat with the whole family.,1368489600,,145,3.7096774193548385
2634499,3,B000HD1PF4,"Maybe the purpose of this video was to show that any family could set about to sail the world and film it all if they wanted too. I would say if that is what you are looking for in a movie about sailing around the world, then this film fits the bill pretty well. It has its charms. If, on the other hand, you want to see a true adventure of rare ability put into a high caliber film, get Sailing The World Alone by Emmy Award winning Laszlo Pal - this is more of the movie I was hoping for with Blue Water Odyssey.",1368057600,,514,3.9047619047619047
2634500,5,B000HD1PF4,"This is probably the only time you will ever read the words ""Blue Water Odyssey"" and Academy Award in the same sentence. It's no surprise that the two never got together. It was obviously low budget, marginally acted, and downright homemade. However, I really liked this movie. All of the scenery, especially the open ocean, is great. Also the ports that were visited are brought out in the way they were at the time. Also for me, having been the same age as the sons were then, just seeing things and some of the places in that era brought me alot of nostalgia. I had always wished my family had just thrown convention out the window and spent our life sailing around the world. As far as the filming, the Driscolls did a great job with what they had and captured the charm of their life at sea. It is definately worth watching and it may even inspire someone to actually get up, leave a hum-drum existance, and live their dream. Ah.... maybe not but it is a good film just the same. A true American documentary. See it.",1361836800,3,1021,4.407407407407407
2634501,2,B000HD1PF4,"As a cruising family, we can relate to the events(positive) and as the techno side of sailing is scant (negative).
The viewing offer should be at no charge and we would like a refund.",1354665600,2,183,4.411764705882353
2634502,1,B000HD1PF4,"Must have been filmed in late 60's early 70's over filmed
Very boring.  Just travel sites nothing to do with blue water
Cruising",1354320000,,128,4.565217391304348
2634503,3,B000HD1PF4,This is a worthwhile watch as long as one understands that it is a compilation of old videotape and lots of new digital camera shots.  At least two sailing vessels were used in the film while the narrator spoke in old 16mm film.,1351123200,,228,4.3023255813953485
2634504,5,B000HD1PF4,"While the material is quite old, the story was very intriguing and captivating.  Makes you want to sail around the world yourself!",1339977600,2,130,4.909090909090909
2634505,5,B000HD1PF4,"I held off renting this film because there were no reviews and the description was pretty thin. Finally, one night, I had an open bottle of wine and some time to kill, so I took the plunge. What I discovered within the first few minutes was that this film is quite old. Perhaps late 60's early 70's? My initial reaction was that I had made a mistake as I was expecting something more contemporary, in spite of the image of the boat in the title graphic. Yet some 10 minutes into this film, I realized I had stumbled upon something that mesmerized me in the same way that Bruce Brown's Endless Summer did for surfing. This film has an innocence that reflects the time in exactly the say way that Endless Summer does as seen today. Rather than two surfers traveling the world, this is the story of a family doing the same, except on Sea Witch, an older yacht purported to have held the record for trans pacific crossing for 18 years! There are even some odd coincidences between this film and Endless Summer, including a stop in Capetown, South Africa that includes a cable car trip to the top of Table Mountain and a safari. Similar to Endless Summer, the film is shot without any sound - with voice over, music, and sound effects added later. This actually enhances the overall effect of the experience. In any event, if you can appreciate today the absolute time warp nature of Endless Summer, then you will love this film as I did. If, however, you are expecting a contemporary film with quick action and non-stop excitement, this this is not for you. Having said that, I just about fell over when this film showed the boat under sail pulling one of the kids on a surfboard like a water ski - which is the same image used today in advertising by Outremer, a producer of high performance catamarans. Go into this film with the right expectations and you will be well rewarded!",1330128000,13,1877,4.491228070175438
2634506,5,B000HD1PF4,given the video years ago by bob and saundra.. even better i was fortunate enough to have spend several weeks in 1993 aboard Sea Witch and sailing with this wonderful couple in Tonga.  video only touches the tip of the adventures they experienced on this 5 year journey with their family.  bob and saundra if you read these reviews... that trip was one of my life highlights....  remember stephanie  haha...,1314403200,,407,4.771428571428571
2634507,5,B000HD1PF4,I watched this movie back in the early 2000s. My local Boat US store had a rental VHS copy. I must have rented it 15 times. I hope to one day do a circumnavigation. Movies like this are great for fueling the fire. I am buying a copy of this to add to my collection as soon as I get back home. A+.,1303603200,,296,3.7142857142857144
2634508,1,B000HD1PF4,"This video was old, outdated, and darn near unwatchable.  The music made you put on your eight track and get out your boogie shoes.  My wife and I watched it together at first.  I watched the entire movie but really wished I had not.  Go to Lats and Atts.  Get a more up to date movie.  Sorry to rain on the parade.  I rarely leave a negative comment but someone has to with this film.  Run don't buy.",1298851200,,401,4.051282051282051
2634509,5,B000HD1PF4,"My wife and two children, ages 9 and 13, are currently preparing for an extended sailing trip. At present not as ambitious as that undertaken in Blue Water Odyssey, whose presentation was outstanding. An extreme family adventure par excellent.
My family was concerned about how such an adventure would be but after seeing how this family pulled it off they are now ready and anxious to go. We found the presentation well filmed and extremely interesting.  We have not seen another presentation of this sort that even comes close to being as good.
I would highly recommend this video, and of its genre rate it five stars.",1286409600,3,620,4.794392523364486
2634510,2,B000HD1PF4,"Being that my husband and I are getting ready to be full time sailors, I have been reading/watching everything I can get my hands on. This was pretty dissapointing. With a copyright date of 2006 I was expecting a fairly modern sailing video, what I got was video taken sometime in the 70's! And most footage was of the cultures they encountered, not of sailing, as the title suggests. To me, it was a waste of money, i was hoping it was something i could watch over and over....NOT!! Oh, and the home produced music was most annoying.",1285891200,,534,4.459183673469388
2634511,1,B000HD1PF4,"This certainly wasn't what I expected.  The film was useful in stimulating ideas of places to visit but it was not a movie and not at all engrossing.  This is horribly produced.  There is a narrator who in a near monotone voice flatly describes what was seen and who did what.  This is effectively someone's home movie that they managed to get people to pay for.  The mono audio was also terrible, perhaps sent direct to digital from the hand held microphone used to record it.",1272412800,,477,4.5
2634512,2,B000HD1PF4,"This appeared to me to be a very dated DVD about a family that went around the world.  There is very little information about the sailing, just about the places they visited.  If that is what you are interested in then there will be some fun watching it, but it will be very dated information.  If you want to know about their sailing experiences, successes or problems with the boat, etc... look else where.",1258156800,,408,4.486486486486487
2634513,2,B000HD1PF4,"Why did I buy this?  I have long desired to go on a family barefoot cruise where my family and I would take 6 months to cover multiple destinations.  Although I have done considerable reading and research on doing so, my family has not.  Yet they need to also get a vision for what it would be like.  I bought this, as it is one of the only DVD's that seems to be focused upon this area.
What I liked about it?  It showed some of the life on the water, but mostly showed the uniqueness of the many destinations.  Since my family and I have lived overseas on a number of occasions, we really didn't need a cultural survey.  I really needed more of daily life on a boat.  Some of that is included, but only 30%.  Most of that is only includes experiences on the boat, with minimal instruction [one exception was the part about how they educated thier kids while on the trip].
What I didn't like:  I was much more intersted in it than my family.  I could hardly get them to sit still long enough to watch it, as it was rather slow.  The scenes were too long for the most part and the music played in the background, became repetitive.  I found myself fast forwarding through the movie, and didn't miss much as a result.  This is an old movie that was converted to a DVD.  Don't expect current quality standards.
Am I glad I bought it?  Yes, for the most part.  It is not a compelling video, but it does put a deposit into the knowledge bank of me and my family of what it is like living on the water.",1243468800,2,1497,4.142361111111111
2634514,4,B000HD1PF4,"I liked the music, the family atmosphere, the fact that these folks really enjoyed their voyaging (and sailing). But as other reviews mentioned, there wasn't much variety in the sailing footage and the route was pretty predictable. That's why I think I preferred the Pardeys new DVD cruising Has no Limits. That one took me to places I dream of seeing some day. Glad I bought both of them.",1240531200,,389,4.6521739130434785
2634515,5,B000HD1PF4,"This video very handsomely portrays a family's around the world sailing voyage. I found it to be a well filmed adventure which effortlessly flowed from scene to scene using narration, music, and animated maps/charts. The places visited were quite interesting and some of the sailing scenes carried the audience away on a delightful trip.
I have now watched it several times and each time makes me want to cast off and follow in their wake. This dvd, in my opinion, is well worth the price.",1237766400,,489,4.764705882352941
2634516,3,B000HD1PF4,"A 5-year sailing trip around the world is something many of us dream about. This family pulled it off. The ports of call were interesting as was the commentary. The film is done in the style of ""The Endless Summer"" with narration over a silent film with background music. The one things I thought was missing though was shots of them actually sailing. A 5 year voyage on the high seas and most the shots were of the ports of call. There wasn't a lot of video of the boat sailing at sea and based on the footage they didn't experience any hardships, broken rudders, torn sails or anything else that I am sure added some real drama to the voyage. While overall it is a nice video of a family vacation and it is well shot, I found it to be more a film of destinations rather than sailing.",1230336000,2,785,4.24
2634517,3,B000HD1PF4,"I actually liked it but I can see how other, maybe younger people would not.  It is basically a home video of their trip.  It was low budget and a bit grainy, filmed on 8 mm I think.  It is very interesting and a bit of a time travel back to the 60's.  It's not for everyone, but it was worth the but for me.",1212278400,,308,3.6923076923076925
2634518,5,B000HD1PF4,"This video begins by briefly opening a scrapbook where the family is introduced and then fades into the movie about their five year circumnavigation under sail. The movie commences in Hawaii and continues through the South Pacific Ocean islands, Australia, Indonesia, Indian Ocean, South Africa, South Atlantic, Carribbean, Panama Canal, and back to San Diego, CA. where the voyage had began.
I found the sailing scenes were well done and the interesting exposure of the family to the diverse cultures they visited extremely well done.
I have attended several presentations of voyages given in person by the people who did them but I have never enjoyed any of them as much as I enjoyed this one.
My husband and I saw this dvd with several friends and we all enjoyed it. The unaminous conclusion was that this was the best of this type of presentation that we had seen.
I highly recommend Blue Water Odyssey.",1212278400,4,907,4.858064516129033
2634519,3,B000HD1PF4,"I would rather be able to give this two and a half stars for production quality and four stars for content.

This is really a set of home movies from the early eighties.  It's about a family that meandered around the world over the course of five years.

I got this at the same time as ""Being Out There"".  They are very different films.  English is a second language for my wife, and she really enjoyed this movie while the other one put her to sleep.  ""Blue Water Odyssey"" explains by showing you, rather than having talking heads.  There is less emphasis on socializing with other cruisers, more emphasis on trying to experience the cultures of the countries visited, and you don't see them motoring.  There is good sailing footage, but it is mostly of a gale, and there is very little of the relatively gentle winds that the family apparently experienced for the majority of their time on the water.

Just a note: as far as I can tell, as I mentioned above, this was shot in the early eighties (going by clothing fashions and the cars in the background).  The actual boat appears to be the original ""Sea Witch""-- the first built to this design, which was published in the old ""The Rudder"" in 1945-- so the boat was over 35 years old when they made the trip!

2634520,5,B000HD1PF4,I found this dvd very interesting and well filmed. It takes one on a voyage around the world and seemed to bring the essence of such an undertaking to life. The sailing shots were well done and the places visited quite interesting. It really leaves a person wanting to cast off and sail in their wake.,1202083200,,301,4.392857142857143
2634521,3,B000HD1PF4,"Having met the Driscoll family, in the Hawkesbury River just north of Sydney, during their circumnavigation, this film held considerable personal nostalgia for me.  I remember them as a charming, good-looking bunch and this film confirms that memory.  It is a modest production, a bit of a home movie in fact, but that unassuming quality is charming in itself.  The film shows some of the pleasures of a trade-wind voyage, provides glimpses of beautiful, simple places far off the beaten track and of the people who live there, and, above all, creates an intimate portrait of a happy family life.  Seeing the kids grow up through the five years it took to complete this circumnavigation is cute.  It fact, that's how I'd describe this film - cute, unpretentious and a pleasant 90 minutes entertainment.",1201737600,,802,4.955223880597015
2634522,5,B000HD1PF4,"Blue Water Odyssey is a DVD which illuminates the beauty and adventure of a world circumnavigation under sail. It is an odyssey which portrays an actual voyage, bringing to life the majesty of the ocean and the exotic places that such an endeavor touches.
I found it to be a well filmed adventure which effortlessly flowed from scene to scene. The background music, narration, and animated maps/charts were exceptionally well done. The sailing scenes and the places visited were quite interesting.

I have now viewed it several times and each time has been a treat which left me wanting to follow in their wake. This is a DVD that is well worth the price.",1197936000,2,655,4.745614035087719

If you love sailing and would like to see a bit of what it's like to go on an extented journey to foriegn ports, then this is an good little film.  The film quality isn't that great by today's standards because it was filmed with a home video camera from the late 70's by the look of it.

Well done, considering when it was filmed (I'm guessing the 60's). Would have been a pretty unusual move back then - taking your family around the world in a sailboat - certainly not as 'doable' as it might seem today.

Some pretty good footage too from what must have been a fairly 'low tech' camera. Sort of reminds me of a ""Mutual of Omaha's 'Wild Kingdom'"" type  of documentary - the captain (and father of the crew) even reminds me of one of the guys from that old show.",1168300800,,612,4.304347826086956

It is like an Anthropologist family as well. A lot of these places have probably changed, yet it's an amazing snapshot of many cultures. This is probably a pioneer of this genre. I can't get over the angles and shots done with limited equipment, music, narration. This was very well done. Edited nicely, and really takes you on a safari around some important cultural places. I love the choice of subjects, and the narrative. It was like my college anthropology class, sailing, and vicarious travel. Very well done. A real must see.",1517184000,,685,4.813559322033898

8138663,2,B000HD1PF4,Sorta like a long home movie. Little attempt was made to be a sailing narrative.,1441929600,,80,4.4
8138664,1,B000HD1PF4,"Though it was interesting, it also was pretty boring. The dated music definitely detracted from the story. SO old that one has to wonder if any of the paces hey visited are even remotely the same as when they went. Really just a home movie set to cheesy music - really bad music for the most part.

Worth the price? Dunno. How bored are you?",1440633600,,341,4.246153846153846
