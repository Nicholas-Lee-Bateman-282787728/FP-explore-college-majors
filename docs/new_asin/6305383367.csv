7888493,2,6305383367,"This film may appeal to a younger crowd (I'm a great-grandfather), but I found the direction to be cumbersome, and the performances to be somewhat wooden.

I must confess that I bailed after thirty minutes, because I just couldn't get interested in the plot or the characters.",1412294400,,276,4.872340425531915
7888494,5,6305383367,"I saw some of this when I was coming home from work. When I saw that girl tied and gagged in the back of that car,I imagined I was a superheroine,and our assistant superhero was lifting up the car bumper so the bad guy couldn't get away. I've always wanted to do that. I've always wanted super powers as well as magic powers,my partner in crimefighting,our guy sidekick and guy sidekick would fight over who would untie her. Use your lazer in your bracelets,guys,or use your magic to free her,guys,ugh! Men!",1117152000,,507,4.582417582417582
7888495,5,6305383367,"I happened upon this delightful film in late December 1999 when it premiered on the HBO Family Channel. Kudos to Agard on creating a hip, slightly noirish, teen romp! I find myself watching it whenever I can! THIS IS A MUST HAVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",993168000,,246,4.880952380952381
7888496,4,6305383367,"Frog and Wombat is a movie aimed at kids who are just pre-adolescent or young adolescents.  It has a good bit worthwhile  about it--a girls-bonding theme presented in the context of solving a mystery.  The movie has some comic moments,  generally fine acting, and, if rated, would fall somewhere between a ""hard"" G rating and a ""very soft"" PG rating.
If you feel that your kids missed out on the ""small theme"" films which seemed to be present for kids in abundance in the 1960s, and seem to have wholly given way to big-budget, big special effects films in the 00s, then you might check out Frog and Wombat, a quirky little modern indy film that reminds me of those low-budget 60s family comedies.  It's not ""laugh out loud"" funny, but it's a perfectly enjoyable afternoon with the VCR.",978048000,,786,4.625899280575539
7888497,5,6305383367,I loved the film! Great acting jobs... Especially Miss Katie a very talented young girl. Katie had me nearly in tears during one scene where she is bound in the back seat of the car. Very believable character!,960422400,2,209,4.526315789473684
