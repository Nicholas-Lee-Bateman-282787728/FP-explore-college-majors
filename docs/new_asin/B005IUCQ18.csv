8475014,5,B005IUCQ18,Kelsie is an excellent instructor and I love the way she has incirporated the kettle bell into this workout.,1510790400,,108,4.7368421052631575
8475015,5,B005IUCQ18,"Great for everyone but beginners.  And, you don't need a kettle bell - any hand weight will do.  As a matter of fact, this workout is done using a three pound kettle bell.  I never even knew such tiny ones existed!  I used an 8 lb hand weight the first time, but will switch to using my 10 lb kettle bell, only because I happen to own one.  Kelsie is a fabulous teacher, you get a terrific workout, and it's totally not boring, either in the 45 minute or 25 minute express version. Yay!  If you are truly advanced, there are ways to up the intensity of the workout that you can easily incorporate, such as using ankle weights, or using a dumbbell in each hand for certain movements, rather than a single weight in just one hand.  These are my suggestions.  Anyway, I love this dvd and will look forward to doing it.  There's no dread factor here.  You can tell that all the women working out are truly enjoying themselves, and so will you!",1498262400,2,939,4.284090909090909

8475018,4,B005IUCQ18,"love the firm, love this workout.  i bought it used and it did not come with the firm kettlebell,  it is not easy to do with the 5lb kettlebell i already have, it is too big and acward to do some of the moves.  i suggest getting the firms kettlebell to get all you can out of this great workout",1417392000,4,294,3.8666666666666667
8475019,3,B005IUCQ18,"I have been practicing kettlebell workouts for over two years now. I decided to try this DVD even though I recognized that it was not a ""real"" kettlebell workout--i.e., it uses only a 5-lb. kettlebell, which is MUCH lighter than what is recommended for performing ANY type of traditional kettlebell exercises, even for beginners (more on this below). However, I really like the Firm instructor who leads this routine, Kelsie Daniels, and so I thought that by subbing a 5-lb. dumbbell, I could consider this DVD just a general strength workout and make it work for me.

The Main Menu for this DVD offers the following options: Full Workout (48 minutes) - Express Workout (20 minutes; same footage) - Bonus Features. The Bonus Features include 8 Minute Core: Strong Back & Abs - Learn the Moves - Behind the Scenes - Preview the NEW FIRM Workouts - The FIRM Believers Club.

For the main routine, Kelsie is teaching live with four background exercisers, one of whom, Alison, shows some modifications, although Alison still uses the small 5-lb. kettlebell. The kettlebell is used throughout the workout with the exception of the warm-up (4-minutes) and the four short (about 3 minute each) cardio intervals; Kelsie describes the second two of these as ""power"" intervals. The cardio is mostly lower impact, with Alison modifying the few higher-impact moves.

For the kettlebell work, Kelsie keeps things quickly and constantly moving. She starts with ""swings,"" but these are NOT true kettlebell swings as they would be taught by any certified kettlebell trainer--i.e., they are performed too slowly, there is no explosive hip pop, the form is too much like a squat, and finally, the arms move above shoulder level (something that most KB trainers discourage). On the plus side, I had no problem doing Kelsie's version of this move with a dumbbell. Kelsies also performs a move that she calls a ""side swing""; this move does not exist within traditional kettlebell work, at least not that I have seen so far.

For the most part, Kelsie uses her light kettlebell to provide a dynamic aspect to more classic strength moves--e.g., a side lunge reaching the KB overhead, a curtsey lunge with a delt raise, etc. The one exercise which Kelsie performed that WAS quite similar to a ""true"" kettlebell exercise was the windmill. (At the end of the workout, she does what she terms ""Turkish Getups,"" but her move was QUITE different from an actual Getup--which uses one forearm as a lever--and more similar to another kettlebell exercise, the Deck Squat.) Finally, this workout also includes a variety of push-ups, mainly performed with one hand on the kettlebell. (When push-ups/rows are performed with one hand EACH placed on a kettlebell, this is called a Renegade Row, but usually very heavy KBs are used for this to provide increased stability due to their larger size.) Kelsie concludes this routine with approximately 3 minutes of standing stretches, including stretching the hamstrings and side stretches.

The Bonus Core routine (7:43 minutes) features Kelise alone on the floor. She uses the kettlebell for some moves (a dumbbell also works fine) such as crunches, seated twist, and passing the kettlebell under the knees; she also performs bicycles, side plank lifts, and brief superman-type moves. The ""Learn the Moves"" segment is brief (2 minutes) but covers some basics of the kettlebell work.

As noted above, this DVD does NOT offer a true kettlebell workout. I would NOT recommend it to anyone who has never tried kettlebells before, especially someone who wants to eventually move on to other kettlebell workouts, as learning kettlebells the WRONG way can actually wreak havoc on your form once you attempt a ""real"" kettlebell workout. (For reference, most certified KB experts would recommend that those just BEGINNING with KBs start with a weight range of approximately 4-8 kg for women--that's 9-18 lbs., depending on pre-existing activity level--and 8-12 kg for men, or 18-26 lbs. Five pounds is just too light!)

On the other hand, this routine works just fine with a dumbbell, and in fact, I would recommend performing it this way, especially given some of the problems the other reviewers mentioned using the included tiny KB. Unfortunately, I found that I still did not particularly enjoy this workout. The light weight wasn't enough for me to feel like I got a significant strength session in, but I think that given the fast pace of the workout, it would be difficult to increase the weight. I was also disappointed that the quick tempo of the routine was not enough to keep my heart rate elevated, so in that respect, I felt like I didn't get a good cardio session in either. I will note that this workout did leave me feeling a bit sore the next day, which was somewhat of a surprise. I can see how some might enjoy this workout as an AWT (aerobic weight training) routine, especially those looking for a light weight, light cardio effect, but overall, this DVD just did not click well for me.",1387324800,8,5007,4.932384341637011
8475020,5,B005IUCQ18,This is a great workout. We have another kettlebell video which we alternate to mix up the routines. It's a great workout. Highly recommend it.,1361318400,,143,4.76
8475021,4,B005IUCQ18,"If you enjoy working out with kettlebells this is a good one. my kettlebells did not come with a dvd to follow along with and for me that is best, so this is a good one.",1346803200,,169,3.7222222222222223
