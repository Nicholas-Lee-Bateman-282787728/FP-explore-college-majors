8203271,4,630473381X,"This video is not just for all the Corelli fans, but also for those who are interested in the human voice in its different ways...and true, Corelli was different!
The sound here is ok, but has unfortnately some disturbing noice in every arias intro, but  when the voice of ""thunder and lightning, fire and blood"" begins to sing, you will ignore it.
Mr Corelli starts this concert with ""Questa o qella..."" in a fast tempo. Maybe too fast, beacause he sometimes is a little out of  beat and text. But he almost makes you forget about it after a glorious B-flat in the end of the aria.
""Un di all'azzuro spazio..."" from Andrea Chenier is the next and here Corelli is getting warmer. This version is superb with Corellis legatos, crescendos and decrescendos. And so he goes on to the next piece; ""O, Paradiso..."" In this one the first B-flat is taken so gently, strong and brilliant  at the same time, that it  led me to the rewindbutton twice. And what an incredible fullvoiced B-flat in the end of this aria. Corelli is in marvelous form here and after I heard these two arias, I realised that he must have been stronger than a bull.
In the ""Che gelida manina..."" he is too heavy, I think, even though it is transposed down a half tone. But in the last phrase he really demonstrates his abnormal breathcontrol.
After this one we can here a magnificent version of  ""Ch'ella mi creda..."" What a powerfull voice!
The next one from Le Cid is not so good. I think  he is a little bit tired at this point. And it may explains the very short versions of  4 famous italian songs. But here again Corelli gives enormous high notes of atomic power.
 I simply give this video 4 stars beacause of three arias who are delivered in such a powerfull and beautiful way, and for the high notes of ATOMIC POWER!",1013990400,4,1790,4.4525993883792045
8203272,5,630473381X,"In this video, for those who had not the fortune to see Mo. Corelli on  live performances, this is the only one available besides CORELLI and  TEBALDI in Concert (Japan).  I have no words to describe Mo. Corelli art of  singing.  His VOICE is wonderful, rich, bold, sweet, unreal.  The very  moment I've heard Mo. Corelli singing, I were completely fascinated by his  timbre, color and warm he placed on his VOICE.  I believe Mo. Corelli is  unique, and although Caruso were considered the King of Tenors, Mo.  Corelli, in my modest opinion, is greater than Caruso.  Someone said abouth  Franco Corelli as being the Prince of Tenors.  Mo. Corelli has no rival.  Not even the three tenors (Carreras, Domingo and Pavarotti ) make us  forgetting Mo. Corelli. When Franco Corelli, in one of his interviews, said  that in one of his performances, after singing an area for about three and  half minutes, the audience applauded him for about twenty seven minutes and  he didn't know why.  I know why, his VOICE and his performance on stage  brought the house down.  The audience and his public were completely  surrendered to the beauty of his VOICE, speccially the portamento and  sentimento he always gave to his singing.  After hearing Mo. Corelli  singing, I'm unable to listen anyonelse.  Opera is not easy, but Franco  Corelli made it live! Thank you Franco Corelli for what you left to us!  What a treasure!",969321600,17,1408,4.7740585774058575
