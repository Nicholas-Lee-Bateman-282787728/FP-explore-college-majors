6518287,2,B00M0GM72Q,"When good actors choose mediocre films, the result is ""No Good Deed"", an overwrought, formulaic 'thriller' starring Idris Elba (TV's ""Luther"", ""Thor"") and Taraji P. Henson (TV's ""Person of Interest"", ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"") as the cat and mouse, respectively.

Directed by Sam Miller (lots of British TV credits as actor and director) and written by Aimee Lagos (a relative newcomer), ""Deed"" is produced by Will Packer (""Ride Along"", ""Think Like A Man"", ""About Last Night (2014)""). Packer seems to have modeled his career after Tyler Perry - both work almost exclusively in Atlanta, both produce a lot of films every year and both create films predominantly featuring African Americans.

Packer has produced a large number of Kevin Hart's recent films. Given Hart's recent explosion in popularity, it is understandable the producer would want to latch onto the hot comic. But Packer also makes occasional forays into drama and suspense. His latest effort in this genre is ""No Good Deed"".

Both Elba and Henson are listed as producers on the film, so I would have to give credit and blame equally to them. Elba is an extremely good, moody actor who has made some great British television. He seems to be having more difficulty breaking into film. Henson has appeared in a large number of films and television series. I suspect that Packer is following the business model used by James Wan (""Insidious"", ""The Conjuring"", ""Saw""). Wan makes his films on a very low budget, attracting B level stars by offering them a smaller paycheck but a percentage of the profits. Because his films are always profitable, the B level stars get a lot of money and a boost in their profile. I suspect both Elba and Henson have similar deals for ""Deed"". And given how little the film cost and how much it has already made - both will probably make a lot of money. This would make their participation in the film a smart business move.

But is it a smart artistic move? ""Deed"" isn't a very good film. It promises a big surprise twist at the end, but this doesn't really redeem all of the formulaic material preceding this moment. And the promised big twist isn't all that extraordinary.

Colin Evans (Elba), a dangerous convict, escapes and finds his way to Terri's (Henson) home on a rainy night. Colin crashes the vehicle he stole, and uses that as an excuse to get in Terris good graces. Terri is having problems with her husband (Henry Simmons) who is away on a golf trip with his dad, so she is home alone with two kids. But she can't leave the man out in the pouring rain with a cut on his forehead. She invites him inside to dry off and get the cut treated while he waits for a tow truck. Meg (Leslie Bibb), Terri's BFF shows up; they planned a girl's night in complete with a bottle of wine and a little rain isn't going to change their plans. Initially, the two women are very flirty with the tall, dark and handsome stranger, especially Meg, but she pushes Terri to be more flirty as well. But Meg begins to sense something isn't right and starts to pay attention to the alarms going off in her head. Soon, Terri is fighting Colin, trying to save her children and herself from the sociopath.

""Deed"" works about as much as it doesn't. A lengthy prologue establishes Colin's character. We learn why he is in prison and see glimpses of his very violent nature. When he escapes, he immediately heads to his old girlfriend's house. Later, when he shows up at Terri's, we have already seen examples of his violent nature so we know it will only be a matter of time before he shows his true nature again. This is the best part of the film, and comes closest to creating some truly tense moments. Because we know what he is capable of and Terri doesn't, you just sit and wait for the moment, the trigger. Once this happens, the film becomes much more predictable and overwrought. They chase each other through the house, trying to outsmart each other. Thankfully, they let Terri get in some licks, but it isn't enough to overcome the cliched nature of this type of plotting. Colin is basically the maniac in a horror film; every time he seems to be down for the count, he... Well, you know.

Until the moment they become cat and mouse, Elba and Henson each do a fine job with their roles. Elba manages to keep us guessing when Colin will snap and become violent. Hitchcock likes to use this trick. He would show the audience a bomb in a suitcase. Then he shows a little unsuspecting boy picking up the suitcase and carrying it into a crowded pub. Then the boy leaves the suitcase and the audience sits and waits for the bomb to go off in the pub. Because we know what will happen, and the people in the pub dont, we sit on the edge of our seat waiting for the inevitable.

Henson's Terri seems more natural and normal than some other recent examples of the damsel in distress role. In the few moments she has, she demonstrates her frustration with her husband's lack of affection and his inability to help with their two children. When Colin shows up, there seems to be a little bit of playfulness, maybe she is flirting a little, maybe she is a little desperate for the attention, maybe she is just doing a good deed. Later, she shows she is tough and able to think on her feet.

There is a little bit of an edge, a bit of difference portrayed in Meg's character as well. Bibb begins to get inquisitive and seems to be Terri's co-conspirator, as they both corner the unsuspecting Colin. They have been BFFs for years, so they seem to get along really well. When they are both sitting down, enjoying some wine with their new friend, you definitely get the sense they are looking to give Terri's husband a little payback. These moments are also a bit above average. What doesnt work as well is that moment when Meg starts to suspect something is wrong. The trigger is not very noticeable to the audience and seems a bit of a cheat.

The film really falls apart, and very quickly, when it reverts to the tried and true formula used so often in these types of films. Terri and Colin chase each other around the house. Then, they move on to another location where they continue to fight. In each location, one of them would seem to have the upper hand, but they each get some licks in.

The final moments are pretty predictable and a short coda seems particularly anti-climatic.

When a film like No Good Deed contains moments that work and more narrative cliches that dont, you begin to suspect the writer, director and cast lucked onto the moments that do work. This realization brings the entire movie down a few notches and makes the surprise of those moments all the less impactful.

No Good Deed is really the type of film you would expect to see on Lifetime. If you turned it on, it might draw you in for a few moments but you probably wouldnt remember it come Monday. The factor that makes this a film worthy of theatrical distribution is the participation of the two leads. While they make the film better to a certain extent, it isn't enough to make No Good Deed worthy of your dollars.",1412208000,4,7088,4.536776212832551
6518288,5,B00M0GM72Q,Watched this thriller last week. It is comes from the usual genre of psycho killer thrillers. The good thing about this movie it had a good twist to the plot.

6518291,2,B00M0GM72Q,"Colin Evans (Idris Elba) convicted of manslaughter did not get his parole because he is a psychopathic Narcissist. He does manage to escape into the poorly developed subplot of housewife Terri (Taraji P. Henson) and former DA. Her husband is gone. Colin has anger management and hydroplaning issues as he expectantly glides into the house of Terri, as we await the home hostage plot to kick-in...something that took way too long.

Terri is no shrinking violet and goes ""Ray Rice"" all over her captor with formulaic results.

The film takes place in the Atlanta area. There was nothing really different to the formula other than that the main cast is African-American, proving that you don't have to be white to make an unoriginal film.

Parental Guidance: F-bomb. No sex or nudity",1411171200,37,780,4.938931297709924
6518292,2,B00M0GM72Q,"Sony brings a thriller from director Sam Miller in No Good Deed that stars the man himself, Idris Elba, as an escaped criminal who goes on to terrorize those from his past. Along the way, Colin Evans crashes his car during a storm and takes shelter at a house with a wife and two kids. As the wife, Terri, allows Colin to come inside while waiting for a tow truck to arrive the hostess begins to suspect that her visitor isn't all there. The night turns into a fight for her life and Colin isn't one to be played with.

I brought this up in a post I did pertaining to the trailer for No Good Deed about a month ago and how the trailer gave away much of the suspense. What you see in the trailer is really what you got and nothing different. It follows the same clichs weve seen in numerous films where an outsider is let into a home and unbeknownst to them turns out to be a murderer or an escaped convict. However, in the trailer it said that theres a twist that we won't see coming, so to that respect its a good way to keep audiences guessing. But when the twist comes, I have to say, it can be seen a mile away and inevitably weights against the film.

Starting with the acting, Idris Elba was great. You could tell from his previous films and in his acting career that he has the potential to be a bad guy and a good one at that. So when watching the movie he came across as a dangerous individual who was relentless. The film took its time setting up the story and the inevitable house invasion where Taraji P. Hensons Terri has to save not only her life but her kids lives as well.  My issue with her character, however, is that she falls victim to the same tropes in how they get held up in the first place. Her character, I hate to say, was dumb in a lot of ways and is mostly due to the writing.

If I had to sum up my biggest complaint with the film is that it all falls on people making dumb decisions. Theres another character introduced as Terris best friend named Meg (Leslie Bibb) who flaunts herself to any stranger, and good looking I have to add. Meg was the kind of person youd expect to die right away, like many others when they don't get the hint. From Terri, Meg, and Terris husband Jeffrey, they all are fed into this plot where Colin (Idris Elba) sees the errors from his victims past that is brought out by the supporting characters. But it isn't effective because of how ludicrous and cheesy it comes across as Colin comes into contact with these people.

For a good amount of time the pacing of the movie stalled when Colin reaches Terris house. Theres conversation after conversation after conversation that youd expect something to happen but it gets delayed even longer until the s*** hits the fan. And when things do go south its boring and all too familiar. As for the twist itself, when its revealed you are just dumbfounded by it. If you pay real close attention at the beginning you could get an idea of what the twist is even before its revealed.

Theres hardly any suspense to Sam Millers No Good Deed. Elba was the only bright spot who continues to impress and grow as an actor. Hes in high demand and can achieve greatness wherever he goes. Heck, I even liked him in 2009s Obsessed where he co-starred with Ali Larter. As a whole, the movie does what its supposed to do and entertain you for 90 minutes, but by the end you won't be amazed or even bother to remember the film when you get home.",1410912000,20,3434,4.25920245398773

6518602,4,B00M0GM72Q,I love suspense/thrillers and this was no exception!  The idea of letting a stranger in your house with your kids is absurd but I guess if you're a stay at home mom whose husband is a jerk and you need some attention...possible.

6518711,3,B00M0GM72Q,"The story portrayed in this film is pretty much spelled out in the trailer. Crazy escaped convict terrorizes a woman and her kids.
That's pretty much it, but there is a nasty little twist in the story that I did not see coming (although I did have a feeling). You know.... When you ask yourself ""surely it isn't this"" and come to find out .... Oh yes, it is. I have to give Colin (Indris Elba) a lot of credit for playing it super cool to make his way into the house. Although you knew he was the ""bad"" guy who is eventually going to snap, you kind of find yourself liking him for a little while (with his fine self). Terri (Taraji P. Henson) was a relatively smart women who made some serious errors at the beginning of the film, but had I not known in advance what was going to happen, I probably would not have thought that she did anything wrong. She was just trying to be nice and do the right thing. Meg (Leslie Bibb) is Terri's best friend and she drove home the point that no one knows you better than your best friend. At first I thought that she was going to be a little ditzy, but she proved me wrong. Jeffrey (Henry Simmons) is Terri's husband who does not seemed to be vested in the relationship. This is very apparent right from the beginning. I went to the 2nd showing on the day the film was released and I have to say that the theater was pretty well populated. The one thing that I have to say about seeing a film with a diverse crowd is that folks talk (out loud) to the people on the screen (myself included). Toward the end of the film I heard myself saying ""how does she think that's going to work"" and then immediately after that I said ""why does he think that worked""...... you'll see what I mean when you go to see it. Other than that, there are three reasons why I liked this film...., the great lead characters, the consistent flow of the film and finally the whole story was told in around 90 minutes. This is director Sam Miller's first attempt at a widely distributed feature film and I think that he did a pretty good job",1474243200,,2052,4.210659898477157

6519222,1,B00M0GM72Q,"Sigh. This movie isn't even worth writing a review so I will keep it short. Basically, NOTHING happens in this movie! Colin is supposed to be this tough murderer and I expected him to wreak havoc and he did nothing. He spent half of the movie flirting with Terry and her friend then he forces Terry and her kids to drive him to his ex-girlfriend's home who he has recently murdered. On top of that there is a pathetic twist. I mean, this was nonsense. I fell in love with this movie when I first saw the trailer and even the bad reviews on Amazon didn't stop me from getting it. Ironically the movie wasn't that bad to me. I've seen way worse but for a thriller it sucked. It wasn't even as thrilling as an LMN movie. It was completely disappointing. We had all this build up like Colin was gonna be so big and bad and he was more hot air than anything.

I say skip this and only watch it if you like the actors or if nothing else is on. So disappointed to finally see a thriller with black actors then it turns out to be a mess. BET would've done a better job than this.",1437177600,3,1071,4.1

Now you're asking, if it's all good, why the 4 star rating and not a 5? I don't know if I'm the only one who thinks like this, but it's the title. The title is fruitless and makes no sense whatsoever. And for that, I give it 4 stars and why I don't plan on buying it.

6519267,5,B00M0GM72Q,"No Good Deed is about a psychotic killer (or to be specific, a malignant narcissist) played by Idris Elba who escapes from a prison van after it's discovered he has to serve at least 5 more years.  He does a great job playing a professional conniving liar in his attempt to convince the jury he's a changed man, but one man in particular isn't buying any of it.

He not only escapes, he kills/shoots the police officer and the driver of the van.  He eventually finds himself entering the house of his ex-wife (Kate Del Castillo).  He has NO good intentions whatsoever.  He has vengeance on his mind, though it's interesting how he takes a calm and rational approach when having a discussion with the woman only to suddenly flip out.  He takes care of business soon let's put it that way.  Idris then turns his attention to Kate's friend by driving to her home (Taraji P. Henson, who turns out to be the main character in the movie and the woman Idris focuses on).  Of course the events leading up to Idris entering this woman's home are dramatic with the heavy rainstorm and thunder adding to the effect (coincidentally, a thunderstorm surprisingly hit my home a few minutes later adding more to the suspense factor).

Anyway, Idris basically terrorizes Taraji the entire time from here on out.  Taraji has horrible luck too, and not just because of this stranger pretending to be all friendly with car trouble (though to be fair he really *did* wreck his car... because he's mentally unstable and deliberately drove it into a tree of course).  No, Taraji's horrible luck runs deeper.  Her car alarm constantly goes off at the most inappropriate of times, it would seem neither she or her husband like to trim the front yard tree branches because they like to come crashing through the kitchen window during important questioning moments, and Taraji likes to invite friends over (Leslie Bibb) to discuss relationships and how, according to Leslie, it's a good idea to take advantage of a hot guy who miraculously shows up to Taraji's front doorstep just because Taraji's husband is out of town.  It comes across rather silly how Leslie immediately flirts with Idris and how Leslie plays the roll of someone who, shall we say, likes to experimental with her sexual adventures and doesn't live by commitments.  No, who needs those silly things!

Anyway, it turns out there's a crazy twisted love triangle taking place I guess you could say, between *all* the characters in the movie (well I mean, all the main characters- the cops aren't part of it thankfully otherwise this would be the craziest story ever).  This includes Taraji's two friends too, including Idris' ex-wife and Leslie bimbo Bibb. This adds to the storytelling and makes it more suspenseful and creative.  Now Idris has a reason to kill.  Granted it's not *that* much more creative, but enough to make the story slightly better.

Otherwise this is your typical suspense involving a crazy prisoner on the loose breaking into a home and threatening/tormenting a family, though in this case the kids aren't harmed (the description's wrong there) and the husband only appears in the beginning, occasionally during phone calls near the end and appearing once again at the very end when uh, without spoiling anything, it probably would've been better to not show up at all!  Wow what a smack to the jaw!  However he too is part of this twisted love story and Taraji finds out the hard way.  However it would appear all this love, cheating and lies is coincidental and Idris was planning to go on a killing spree anyway because that's just his nature.  It's sort of unintentionally funny how all the pieces fall into place to add more fuel to Idris' fire.

Overall, No Good Deed is pretty good.  I give it 5 stars beacause these type of movies are a no-brainer in terms of being entertaining to watch, but for those who've watched several films like this and perhaps with similarities to the Hand That Rocks the Cradle going to be imminent, those who are experienced in these type of movies would probably call No Good Deed just another typical film in the genre.  I however, love them and wish more movies were like this.",1434844800,,4181,4.740331491712707

Henson) is a lonely mother with two small children who gave up her career as a District Attorney to be a stay at home wife to her lawyer husband Jeffrey (Henry Simmons), makes small talk with her best friend Meg (Leslie Bibb) and since Jeffrey is to be out of town for his fathers birthday they plan a girls night drinking wine during a storm in Teris home. In another place sociopathic Colin (Idris Elba), who has a narcissistic personality disorder, goes before a parole board (he has been imprisoned for 5 years), is denied parole and on his way back to prison he murders the men escorting him, wrecks their van, visits his ex- fiance Alexis (Kate del Castillo) whom he murders in a rage, leaves and knocks on Terris door for help.  Terri invites the handsome car accident victim into her home. Desperate for a little attention, she doesn't realize she's entertaining a sociopathic, yet charming escaped convict. In one terrorizing night her life completely changes as she fights for her own life and the life of her children. The plot includes secrets of infidelity, the communication between best friends that is sacred, and in general a lot of hide and seek during a blistering storm.

Both Elba and Henson are in top form (physically and professionally) and this adds a flavor of that dichotomy between erotica and terror. No new ideas in this film, but it is well worth watching for the quality of the cast and the pace of the film. Grady Harp, June 15",1434499200,3,1777,4.646496815286624

6519518,1,B00M0GM72Q,"How on Earth did this Lifetime TV show get in MY movie theaters? Stock characters in a stock plot. A bad man, and a strong single woman (well, she has a husband but this film doesn't want you to focus on that too much), plus her adorable kids, in jeopardy. Oh NO! An easily avoidable hostage situation contrived to create a sandbox for this psycho cat and bad-ass mouse to play in. A film it seems, designed to communicate one thing  all men are pigs!

Take my advice guys, this is not the date movie you're looking for. :-)

This film is so exploitative it actually gets unintentionally hilarious. The two lead men are super good-looking, fine hunky specimens of maleness, yet make terrible husbands or turn out to be serial killers. Our leading lady is sacrificing a promising law career to raise her two children. Shes educated, strong-willed, beautiful, not too skinny, and will fight back when cornered. Cue the rain and thunderstorms for added effect!

No Good Deed is also incredibly predictable, because we've seen this kind of show hundreds of times already. Its the kind of film my mother would enjoy, and I could picture her shouting at the TV during the more tense moments. Its a movie length crime thriller made with a TV soap sensibility, targeted at a very select demographic, of which Im not a member. (talkiegazette.com)",1428969600,,1337,4.725321888412017

6519810,1,B00M0GM72Q,"Incredibly bad movie despite having two great actors in it.  The plot was undeveloped and illogical.  How long can an escaped prisoner who has killed two guards be on the run and go unnoticed.  Ms. Henson's character despite being an attorney for victims of male violence, is clueless and has no qualms about opening her home to a perfect stranger.  Did not working in the court system teach her anything about criminals?  Mr. Idris? not  his finest hour.  Seems he struggled to deliver a convincing psychopath.  His detachment from the character was very noticeable. A more clever and intelligent story line was needed to hold my interest.

Idris Elba, he did an excellent job with his character, which showed his vast talent to tackle what he needs, to make a movie believable.

The movie was very entertaining, left you guessing as to what would happen next. Then you find out ... no cigar, guess again. It's gripping movie, from start to finish. I recommend it.",1426377600,,581,4.631067961165049

I would have liked to see his character's outcome played out in the film.

Sorry, this was just so unrealistic it was hard to continue, especially when (possible spoiler) the main character tells this complete stranger she was an assistant DA who prosecuted domestic disturbances with men being so dumb as to make her job easy, then goes on to tell him her husband will not be coming home.

Maybe it got better, I seriously don't know, I did not continue it after about 30 minutes into it because of the stupidity of both these women.

6520179,3,B00M0GM72Q,"Its nice every now and then to find a movie that isn't pretentious, trying to reinvent a genre of film by adding far too much to it to even make it recognizable. The thriller genre has been through ups and downs over the years with too much sex added ever since BASIC INSTINCT found its niche market. So when an honest to goodness thriller without the overt sexuality comes on the scene its worth noting. NO GOOD DEED is just that film.

Idris Elba plays Colin, a sociopath about to appear before the parole board as the film opens. Suspected in the murder of five women and tried only in a case of manslaughter for killing a man in a bar fight, he explains how hes reformed and helping other prisoners to read these days. One member of the board has looked deeper into the case though and lets the rest known what kind of con man the person before them can be. We get a glimpse of that as Colin nearly loses his temper during the proceedings.

With the parole failed Colin escapes on the way back to prison, killing both guards in the process. Shortly after that we see him staling a woman in an open caf and then following her home. It turns out to be his ex-girlfriend. He confronts her about the man she was talking to and she explains he is a friend and gay. Pressing the matter the two argue, she tells him she has been with the man and in their bed and Colin kills her.

The story switches to Terry (Taraji P. Hensen), a young housewife whose day consist of taking care of her pre-school age daughter and baby. Her husband Jeffery is a successful lawyer but they rarely seem to have time for one another these days. He stops at home on his way to a weekend away for his fathers birthday. This leave Terry home alone and waiting for a night with the girls involving her best friend Meg.

The night turns into a stormy one as Colin tries to continue on his escape. An accident causes him to run off the road and nearly get killed. Walking in the rain the first house he comes to belongs to Terry. He knocks and asks if he can use her phone from the porch and she obliges, eventually allowing him into the house after they converse for a bit. She offers him dry clothes to wear while waiting on the tow truck he supposedly called and patch up a wound on his head.

The movie progresses as Meg arrives and the three of them carry on a conversation. But things begin to change and the role that Colin is playing slowly unravels. Just what is in store for the two women and Terrys children is yet to be seen. Will this sociopath kill everyone in the house? Will Jeffery return home early? Or will, as in most thrillers these days, Terry seduce her captor to save her children? Well the best way to find out is to watch this movie.

As I said the movie is a well-paced thriller that doesnt waste extra effort or time in giving far too much backstory here. At just under 90 minutes its the perfect amount of time for this story to be told. Ive often questioned if the classic films of the past could be told in under 90 minutes then why do movies these days have to come in over 2 hours? This movie realizes up front that theres no need for that and it still tells a decent mystery with a fantastic twist you won't see coming.

Both of the lead actors here, Elba and Hensen, do a wonderful job of bringing their characters to life. Elba, who of late has been seen in more hero styled lead roles, does a great job as the psychotic killer who knows how to manipulate people. Hensen, who left TVs PERSON OF INTEREST last year, does a great job as a woman who had more control over her life as well as a career in the past, only to find herself in the doldrums of being a housewife now. But hers is also a protective mother character that will do anything to keep her children safe.

When I saw the trailer for this in the theater and on numerous DVDs I had no interest in watching it. Id seen the formula time and time again and expected the same thing here. I was pleasantly surprised to see that it took that formula and added something fresh to it while returning back to tried and true structures that haven't been used in decades at the same time. The end result is a solid thriller that holds you in its grip from start to finish. Its well worth a watch.",1425168000,,4256,4.226322263222632

6520321,2,B00M0GM72Q,"The more appropriate title for this film would have been No Dumb Deed because stupidity permeates every fiber of this production.  Idris Elba stars in this thriller as Colin Evans, a convicted killer and a suspected serial killer.  Evans is denied parole by the parole board, the only smart people in the film.  While being transported back to prison, he kills the two dumb guards when he fakes a bloody nose in order to draw one of them close so he can kill them and take their gun.  Now I am no expert on the parole system but aren't hearings usually held in the prison?  Why would they take an acknowledged killer and psychopath and transport him elsewhere for the hearing?

After killing is girlfriend for cheating on him, Evans crashes his car during a rain storm and arrives at the home of Terri Granger (Taraji P. Henson), worlds dumbest mom.  Terri is having her own relationship issues with her husband Jeffrey (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.S Henry Simmons), who departs on a trip leaving Terri at home with her two young children.  Terri allows Evans in the house so he can wait for a tow truck, oblivious to the menace.  Soon Terris dumb friend Meg (Bibb) arrives for what she thinks will be a girls night.  After initially thinking Terri might be having an affair, Meg inexplicably begins flirting with Colin in a truly bizarre and uncomfortable sequence.  With friends like those

Colin kills Meg when Terri goes to check on the kids and tells her that he left.  But after noticing the phones are not working and a kitchen knife is missing, Columbo starts to put things together and suspect that Colin might not be a nice guy.  Incredibly, it gets worse.  Terri twice manages to get the better of Colin, incapacitating him but failing to finish the job or even attempt to restrain him, preferring the time honored tactic of meandering about until her attacker regains his senses.  Evans takes the children and forces Terri to drive away in their car.

Terri manages her one intelligent move by flashing her lights at a passing patrol car to get the cops attention (while Colin conveniently naps).  Unfortunately it is the dumbest cop on the force that she succeeds in flagging down and that it goes horribly wrong for him.  If this wasn't bad enough the capper is one of the dumbest twists ever which added nothing to the story other than making it even more implausible.

Idris Elba is a fine actor and has had some outstanding supporting roles in the past but this was not his finest hour.  Of course, he isn't getting much help from the inane script by Aimee Lagos and the horrendously shoddy directing by Sam Miller, in his first major feature film.  Weve seen a lot of these home invasion thrillers over the years and No Good Deed brings nothing new to the table.  A truly forgettable film.  Skip this one and watch Youre Next, Funny Games, or Cape Fear.

***SPOILERS***  **SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***

I will admit the story is a little predictable and I could call what was going to happen with the blonde friend when she came over for girls night.  But the atmosphere was really good!  It was suspenseful, and slowly built up until the situation between Colin and Terry until it erupted in a climax between the two of them.

Also the twist ending was really surprising and it shows just how far that Colin was willing to go in order to get his revenge on people who he felt wronged him.

Anyone who likes suspense movies and serial killer movies will really enjoy this.  I also enjoyed the fact that we had an almost all African American cast in this movie.  These movies are usually all white actors, so it's nice to see this movie change it up :-)

6520457,1,B00M0GM72Q,"This movie got unanimously trashed by the critics for a reason: A smart, thinking person would know this was just a low-grade exploitation fare. It's unoriginal and a waste of time and talent. People pay to see this kind of junk because it's satisfying in the way candy is satisfying, and because they recognize the stars. You don't need to lower your expectations for the film; it lowers them for you. One of the many problems with NO GOOD DEED is the straight-to-DVD look of the film. Miller is limited to only a small handful of set-pieces, and frankly you can only watch Terri hit Colin on the head and have him get up repeatedly so many times without summoning a yawn or two. The chase sequences are so poorly executed that you can see the thriller clichs coming well before they arrive. There is not one moment of actual suspense that works. All of it borrowed from better films that manage to provoke a least a minimum sense of urgency. With a thin plot, a preposterous twist, and ludicrously dumb characters, there is no good to be found in NO GOOD DEED. That's not to say that the film's stars don't try their hardest to make it work, but even they feel like they've lost interest in this nothing of a story. It's even worse for the bland side characters that are only there to get to the next plot point. How this was made with such exceptional actors and without ending up on late night cable is beyond my comprehension. If there is any distinction that this may have, it might simply be that it is one of the worst theatrically released films of the year.

I agree with the critics who gave this garbage 1 star!",1424476800,,1623,4.4280936454849495

6520502,4,B00M0GM72Q,"Good movie.  Nice to see something different in a movie with predominantly black characters.  One annoying aspect of the action (and I find this to be the case in many thrillers) is when victims strike back, briefly stunning the psycho/criminal, they try to run way too soon.  Everyone watching knows they would not attempt to run until they have followed up the first blow with something fatal to the stunned attacker.  Then the victim would be able to walk away completely at peace.  This is the classic annoyance of thriller movies.",1424476800,,535,4.835164835164835

What Colin don't realize is that Terri is far from being a shrinking violet, which makes this movie move at a suspenseful pace, and the twist at the end was one that I never saw coming.

Idris came to Taraji's door claiming the need to use her phone, once inside her home he holds her and her two small children hostage because he wants to make a point to her.

6521078,2,B00M0GM72Q,"No Good Deed got a bad rep, and with good reason.  It started off with a potentially good story.  A man gets out of prison for murder, finds his former girlfriend / fiance and kills her in a jealous rage (which you know he will).  He finds himself stranded in the rain after a car accident and comes knocking on this other woman's door looking for a phone to call for assistance.  She has no idea that this man is a killer and that he will kill again because he's a sadistic sociopath, or that the woman is really in a bad marriage and you think for a moment that this might be an erotic fantasy in the works.  Or that her woman friend comes along and flirts with him, then realizing that he wasn't telling the truth about where he actually lives because the woman friend is a real estate broker.  From then on, this movie just looses it's mojo.  A potentially good story about suspense, and there was none to be had.",1421366400,,917,4.235632183908046

As for the amazing plot twist in the end I usually have movies figured out but I didn't see this coming but it wasn't so amazing either.

6521126,2,B00M0GM72Q,"This is an example of 2 good actors caught up in a bad, Lifetime movie quality, film.  It was so generic that I can even get into all the cliches there are in this film.  The only reason why I give it 2 stars is because the actors who were in it did nothing wrong.  I'm a writer and this is an example of bad writing and possible directing.  They should have baled on the script.  I love Idris Elba, I'm not so familiar with the female lead, but she was believable as the timid housewife, until the script asks her to change character fully into the woman who has had enough midway through the film.  Where did this come from? How and when did it happen?  No explanation.  Just whatever this bad script needs to keep this psychological thriller going.  A psychological thriller that would have been innovative in 1986.  I went to see this with a friend.  She liked it a little more than I did, but we both agreed that this is something that is made for the WE channel and were not happy that we spent even matinee prices.

They go on to prove its unnecessary as they never bring it up again.  After that, Its pretty much your standard, is she going to get killed? movie you see on Lifetime.  There is not one plot point you cant see coming a mile away including the so called twist.

6521138,2,B00M0GM72Q,"Offsetting Bias Alert! I have been a big fan of Taraji P. Henson since her days in Person of Interest. But I am not a fan of Idris Elba since his days on The Wire. But it saddens me that this film is so bad. Idris Elba and Taraji P. Henson tried to carry this outing and Idris did an outstanding job but the storyline is truly inconceivable on so many levels. Sadly that is not my only complaint because it is hard for me to pay for any movie that isn't even an hour and a half. I don't give spoiler alerts but this is a classic example of characters doing the most ridiculous things to get into situations and we are asked to feel the drama and/or suspense of seeing if they get out. One surprise twist at the end does not a good movie make. This storyline is so unbelievably bad because the villain is as stupid as the hero. This film is 88 minutes long and I guarantee that you will spend 80 of those asking yourself, ""Who does that?"" At least the writer was consistent because Leslie Bibb and Kate Del Castillo are just as ridiculous in their roles.

Don't open your door without knowing who it is; don't open your door to strangers; don't leave your door open to strangers, don't invite strangers men especially a man.  this script allowed all of that to happen, I got angry about it, saying, ""don't do that', that's stupid'.  But all in all, it's a great movie.  My girl tarji P is amazing in all of her acting and to see her in this movie will make you appreciate her talent as an actress even more.  This tops the tv show.

The story was ok, but I found the twist near the end to be ridiculous. When the twist occurred, I was excited to see where it lead. Unless there was one vital line in the movie that I missed, the twist never developed into anything that pulled the movie together. I almost gave the movie 4 stars based on the role by Elba, but I found the ""coincidental"" twist didn't belong in the movie and brought the story down a level.",1420848000,,582,4.243243243243243

Idris was so convincing as a murderer on the loose and was evenly matched here with a strong opponent in Taraji as a wife and mother that happened to answer the door on the wrong night. I loved the cat and mouse, back and forth suspense and the fact that Taraji was not a helpless victim made the movie all the better.

The plot isn't my point of contention, just the numerous occasions of awkward silence that made it difficult to immerse myself in the movie. Was it the casting or director? You tell me.",1420675200,,334,4.677966101694915
6521227,1,B00M0GM72Q,"May be spoilers below.  Don't worry, this movie was as simple as a one piece puzzle.  You will guess what will happen within 5 minutes and you will be correct.

My mom and I rented this from redbox.  We both thought we had heard good things.  Well, if we did, they were 100% wrong.

The movie is about; actually, I do not even think there is a plot.  You may get a sneak peek at something that leads you to believe there is a reason for the madness, but not enough to make this a story.  A man tries to get out of jail.  He is in front of a group of people.  He is denied.  On the way back to prison, things go wrong.  The man is out.  The thing that happened, it makes no sense, it is just a random excuse to let the man get out.

The man gets a car.  Now, mind you, this would all be on the news and their would be cops all over the place.  The people he killed to get the car would tell the cops his general location.  But, nope, he still has time to do what he does.

He goes to a house.  There is a lady and her two kids there.  The lady lets the man in, eventually and he goes crazy.  That is basically the story.  There is no point to it.  This movie is full of clich&eacute;s.  Like the lady gets the man down time and time again.  As soon as he is lying on the floor, she walks away.  My family and I were all saying, just continue hitting the man lady!  Man gets back up, same events, again and again.  It is one of the stupidest movies I have ever seen.  The acting is awful, the man who is the nut barley even talks.  He is like an animal.  The way he walks and acts.  Then, when the woman has finally resolved everything, what you get?  The cops show up.  Awful, badly acted, pointless, goes nowhere and starts out there movie.

Another thing is this.  I have a thing.  90% of the movies out there need to be at least 90 minutes to be any good.  There are some that do a good job in less time, but the next day I looked to see the length of this movie.  83 minutes.  I am 100% serious.  So, if you cut out the time for the end credits and the opening of this movie, what does that make it, like 75-79 minutes long?  It is like one of those TV movies, but a step below.

If you are interested in this, I would highly suggest you rent it on demand or from redbox.",1420675200,6,2274,3.873362445414847

The plot was somewhat thin but when it got to the meat,it was juicy. The twist was worthy of on OMG and played out beautifully. The first half wasn't action packed but the characters and dialogue were done well enough to keep the viewer enticed.

The third act was full speed ahead with a edge of your seat game of cat and mouse. Taraji P Henson as Terry took what could have been one dimensional and turned her into an interesting character that we as the viewer cared about.

This film features the best ""Woman sucker punches someone"" since Clair hit Peyton in The Hand That Rocks The Cradle! I highly reccomend this to anyone who likes home invasion thrillers or great twists.",1420588800,30,871,4.465408805031447

I read that a narcissist has become emotionally stuck at the time of major trauma. A flashback showing what happened in Colin's past would have made this film more interesting. He had issues with females. Did this start with his mom, I kept wondering. I also read characteristics of a narcissist. Idris played his role well.

Because of Terry's profession before she became a stay-at-home mom, I was surprised and disappointed by some of her choices. Maybe she was too trusting because she needed a man to talk to, I don't know.

Escaped convict, manipulation, marital problems, murder - With all of this I thought the film would have me on the edge of my seat. It wasn't as intense as I thought it would be. Well, not until it was almost over. Idris Elba and Taraji P. Henson are very good at what they do. Their acting was not the problem. The film lacked substance.",1420588800,4,1084,4.520408163265306

He knocks on the door of Terry (Henson) and asks for help. This chance encounter changes the lives of both of them. There is a reason I try not to watch the trailers for movies before I watch the movie. The preview for this one makes it seem like an intense suspense thriller bordering on horror. None of that aspect takes place until an hour in to this hour and 20 minute movie. The movie drags a ton until the twist that I have to admit I didn't see coming at all. For that reason alone I thought the movie was OK, but it wasn't enough to make it all that good.
