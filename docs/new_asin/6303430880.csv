Bryon James has since passed away, we are all sorry to see a talant such as his pass on. The cast was very supportive and  Brad Johnson did most all of his stunts.  Woody Brown did all of his as  well.  Woody and I worked on the script when we were bartenders a few years  back.  Although we didn't have a large budget we did have a cast and crew  with heart.  You can email me at Mikehoe11@aol.com  There are several other  films I've directed, keep an eye out and thanks for the support!  Michael Kehoe",947289600,,608,4.025210084033613
