7854198,4,6303893902,"Tamilee Webb is a fabulous trainer and I love her tapes.  This one is a little unusual in that she comes on for the warm-up and then lets a gentleman lead you through the exercises.  She pops on again in the middle for a little aerobic (hip hop) section between sets.  Her philosophy, she explains, is that it's more fun to watch a good looking man than her.  Overall, the tape is quite good and very easy to follow.",1021766400,7,416,4.227848101265823
