8073050,4,B000A2W8UI,"Responsible for a string hit shows in the mystery, espionage, and mystery genres, like The Avengers, The Saint, and Danger Man, Britain's ITC (Incorporated Television Company) Entertainment also produced Man In a Suitcase (1967-68) a series that lasted for just one season, producing 30 episodes featuring Richard Bradford as an ex-intelligence operative named McGill.

In the first episode ""Man From the Dead"", it is learned that McGill (no first name stated) was an American agent who was disgraced about six years previously, and is regarded by some as a traitor.  McGill discovers that his reputation was sacrificed as part of a scheme to plant agents behind the iron curtain.  Rather than endanger those operatives, McGill chooses to remain in disgrace.  He makes his living doing investigative work, and other odd jobs that usually involve intrigue, and danger.  The title of the series comes from McGill's somewhat nomadic lifestyle, as he frequently travels from place to place carrying a worn tan suitcase.

McGill may travel light, and doesn't always go first class, but he is seldom in dire financial straits.  With a tarnished reputation in some circles, McGill seems to have no shortage of employment opportunities, and is sometimes selected to be the fall guy.  McGill is ruggedly handsome, but has some rough edges, and lacks the refinement and sophistication of a Simon Templar.  His prematurely graying hair, makes him look a lot older.  Because he has received a raw deal, McGill has a big chip on his shoulder, and his headstrongness seems to cloud his judgment at times.  He can be a fierce fighter, but still takes a number of beatings, and is also badly wounded on several occasions.  This may add an element of realism, but fortunately McGill appears to be a fast healer.

Operating as a lone wolf, and without employing high tech ""Bondlike"" gadgets, McGill is a tough operator who has a tendency to be stubborn, and doesn't always take the sensible course of action.  Similar to Danger Man, the series has as a dark cynical tone, with very little humor.  McGill was apparently originally conceived as more of a light hearted wiseguy, but Bradford preferred taking a more dark, low key approach, and also changed his lines, which apparently didn't endear him to many in the writing and production staff.

The adventures are set in mostly European locations, and feature a lot of variety, from different types of crimes, to political intrigue, to international espionage.  The episodes are generally well written, and pretty lively.  For those acquainted with other ITC series from the era, the stories will seem familiar, as will many of the guest stars.  And once you get used to the downbeat vibe, and McGill's at times sour attitude, the lack of happy endings won't be as much of an issue.  McGill may never be the most popular guy, but his determination and personal integrity are quite admirable.

Albert Elm's music and cues for the series, are very reminiscent of Edwin Astley's work on The Saint.  Image quality is quite good for a program over forty years old.  The 8 DVD set has a substantial set of extras on each disc, including some guest cast bios, and a great number of photos taken during the production of the various episodes.  Richard Bradford even provides a commentary, but unfortunately his memories regarding the series are not the best.  For those that enjoy ITC Productions' mystery and suspense programs, Man In A Suitcase is a series that is well worth your time, along with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Baron/dp/B001NH4CEY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Baron</a>&nbsp;(1965-66).  Be advised that this release from Umbrella Entertainment in Australia, is Region 2, and you will need a region free player to view them.  In 2011, the series was released in Region 1 in two parts with 15 episodes each, by Acorn Media (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Man-in-a-Suitcase-Set-1/dp/B0047CG94S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Man in a Suitcase Set 1</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Man-in-a-Suitcase-Set-2/dp/B005VB61HO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Man in a Suitcase Set 2</a>).",1341360000,,4258,5.49079754601227
8073051,5,B000A2W8UI,"I read a review in a magazine, which gave me the totally wrong expectations for this box set. Mainly, it tried to make out that this series had been considerably more quirky and surreal than it is, somewhat in the vein of that other famous TV series from around the same time called ""The Prisoner"".

Recently, however, I watched the whole series though again, now knowing better what to expect. This is much more down-to-earth 1960s television, though there are some surreal moments. Generally, the first few episodes have weak scripts, but then it picks up, until the end where the standard sinks again considerably.

Apart from that, the acting is good, in fact the main man Richard Bradford is completely outstanding. A much, much underrated actor. He himself complains in an extras interview that the series didn't reach its potential, but still it is head an shoulders above common standard for this kind of thing.

This was clearly an expensive project, filmed in colour, good camera work, and a very, very good transfer to DVD. The whole box set is put together with great love and care, simply the best I've ever seen of its kind.",1288396800,,1138,4.766497461928934
8073052,3,B000A2W8UI,"Unfortunatly, I was misled in the false pretention that this set was ""All Regions"" as opposed to the others that were all Region 2. It's really disapointing to buy something that says ALL REGION and IT IS  NOT. I loved that TV Series who show a character with a more abrupt profile and who wasn't into womanizing. But again, let's be honest here, Make sure ""All Regions"" really means what it says. And by the this whole schemes about ""Regions"" today is ridicululous! Why did the business did that? With the internet today anybody can order from all over the world. So I don't understand why this policy is still in force<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Man-in-a-Suitcase/dp/B000A2W8UI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Man in a Suitcase</a>",1280275200,,770,5.52542372881356
8073053,5,B000A2W8UI,"A superior 1960s TV show. Though it was only on 1 season, it left a lasting impression on me. Watching this DVD collection brought back memories and a surprise on how violent it was! McGill had to be the only hero that was shot or beat up every week and left trails of blood behind him. The extras are good, too. Loaded with voice commentaries on many episodes. On top of this, the set I purchased  was All Region DVD compatible. Highly recommended for fans of 1960s television and spy thrillers.",1240012800,5,496,4.450549450549451
8073054,5,B000A2W8UI,"Man In A Suitcase was my favorite series as a teenager and, without a doubt, Richard Bradford was easily my favorite actor.  This DVD offering is a high-tech success.  Audio and visual contents are excellent.  There are several extra features, such as commentary by Richard Bradford and accompanying history of the filming of the series.  Some of the episodes, naturally, are only mediocre, but Bradford carries the day every time.  He compensates for any other inadequacies.  Frequently, there are accomplished actors as guest stars, which adds to the enjoyment.  All in all, I would say, this is an excellent value for the discriminating viewer.",1235606400,3,647,5.163461538461538
8073055,5,B000A2W8UI,"Highly enjoyable spy/detective series made in 1967/68, featuring Richard Bradford as John McGill, ex-CIA agent forced to resign and now freelances as a pricey, globetrotting private detective.

Another fine series from the ITC Television Network, responsible for shows like ""The Prisoner"" and ""Gideon's Way,"" this is a gritty, realistic and exciting set of episodes well-written with fast-moving plots and never short on action.

Bradford plays McGill with a degree of toughness and a laconic ease so well that he seems to be perfectly cast for the role. Trained at the NY Actor's Studio, Bradford was a Method actor and claimed Brando as his inspiration; in fact, Bradford had a supporting role with the Academy Award winning actor in the controversial film, ""The Chase"" (1966), directed by Arthur Penn.  Supporting players, all fine character actors from ITC's stable, like Donald Houston, Angela Browne, and Judy Geeson, raise the bar of this rarely seen, but popular,  detective series.

Compared to 'Danger Man's"" John Drake, McGill is the antihero--a man for hire, keen and distrustful of others, with an eye for the ladies, but a man not without scruples.  Shot in color, the series is markedly violent and in the fisticuffs McGill often finds himself in, the blood flows freely. But there is more: the stories and assignments McGill takes on are interesting as they are unusual at times.  The international locales also add a bit of flair in contrast to the typical ""Mannix"" episode that was limited to that metropolis called Los Angeles.

This Network DVD set should be held up as a model of what all DVD sets should aspire to: pristine transfers from the original print (so clean they look as if they were shot yesterday), tons of extras including trailers, foreign titles, bumpers, behind-the-scene stills, a Richard Bradford interview (today, a mere shadow of the lean, handsome actor he was 40 years ago!), a full-color booklet, and more.

The set is available thru Amazon UK, but you will need a multi-region DVD player to view these Region 2 encoded discs.  Nonetheless, ""Man in a Suitcase"" is a tight and shut case to hours of viewing enjoyment.  And if the incidental music in ""Man in a Suitcase"" seems awfully familiar to that of 'The Prisoner"" it should be--both were composed by Ron Grainer.",1156377600,19,2311,5.007832898172324
