8406180,1,B003UV93SG,"Everything seemed in order. The Amazon Prime Instant Video listing had ""711 Ocean Drive"" noted as available. Full speed ahead, I thought with much eager anticipation. As I am a film noir ""completist,"" I was excited to see a somewhat hard to find title--particularly without having to buy a DVD of unknown provenance or planning a trip to some pretentious revival art house. Everything seemed in line: Movie? Available. Sign in to account? Check. Click on the play button? Yup. But then...what is this? Title not available! All of that expectation and the frisson of anticipation gone in a second.

And why? Because Amazon noted this title, ""711 Ocean Drive"" as available right up to the moment at which it would have played in their streaming player. Needless to say, a complete letdown and a big disappointment. Had this title simply been noted as ""unavailable,"" or not listed at all, I wouldn't have cared. But to get to the point of expecting content in the Prime streaming player and not getting it is inexcusable and manipulative. Bad show, Amazon! This is a big disappointment and a poor reflection on their usually good on-line service.",1390953600,2,1143,4.891752577319588
8406181,1,B003UV93SG,"I should have read viewers responses as I would not have ordered this movie... there was a long delay and I thought this was a studio pressing on demand but it turns out to be probably an illegal bootleg version as another viewer noted: the TCM logo shows up...
the movie is very good but  don't waste your time...

really disappointed by Amazon for allowing something like this to be sold through their company.

From now on I will always be a buyer beware....
I had thought that AMazon selling the item would have not allowed this to happen",1309996800,2,542,4.454545454545454
8406182,1,B003UV93SG,"I expected this would be the Sony Classics DVD-R. Instead it is a bootleg recorded off TCM. (The TCM logo shows up twice). I'm surprised Amazon offered this for sale. It is poor quality and a counterfeit.

Needless to say I am returning it for credit.",1289088000,4,251,4.456521739130435
8406183,4,B003UV93SG,"711 Ocean Drive, is a nice little ""B"" movie type gangster flick. The best part of the movie, is when the national syndicate comes to town. We get to see the kind of post war corruption that most Americans claim they know nothing about. Edmund O'brien, Otto Kruger, Don Porter, and the other ""B"" movie players are delight to watch. It's not a ""noir"", but it has  ""noirish"" elements in it. The video quality was good, but I did hear some audio anomalies early on, during some lines of dialogue.",1282953600,5,492,4.466666666666667
