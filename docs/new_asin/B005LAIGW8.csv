4719896,3,B005LAIGW8,"I've waited five long years for a sequel to Ghost Rider, but this isn't exactly what I pictured. I didn't hate this movie, but I dislike when they change facts made in the original. They showed a completely different flashback of Johnny signing the deal. I read that Neveldine/Taylor avoided watching the original, and you can tell. Some of the action scenes were decent. There were crazy acid-trip moments, and the Ghost Rider is grittier, lean and mean this time. Johnny Blaze is hiding in a remote part of Eastern Europe. He is asked by a man named Moreau to help a boy named Danny from being sacrificed to the Devil. Will Johnny get rid of the Rider forever, or will he embrace his gifted curse? If you're a fan of dark Marvel heroes, you'll like GHOST RIDER: SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE!!!",1329782400,3,786,4.581560283687943
4719897,1,B005LAIGW8,"First let me say we loved the first Ghost Rider; a simple story, excellent transitions, good acting. Along comes #2 Ghost Rider: We're excited. And it's an awesome ... letdown. The filming was jagged, with Photoshopped stills thrown in (what's up with that!), too many shots of the flaming head for no reason, a scene where he suddenly goes from nonfire mode to flamed and peeing fire (why?), his flaming chain scenes don't compare to GR#1 ... and on and on in that vein. The most insulting thing, according to my husband, was the motorcycle used didn't go with the sound of the motorcycle used, and everyone who's ever rode a chopper knows it. And when the main actor is upstaged by Idris Elba, you wonder what influence the directors had on Nicolas Cage, or was something wrong with Nicolas Cage? I think this movie was aimed at a lower age group/less critical audience. The director's fault? The writer's fault? The studio's fault? The actor's fault? Everyone raise your hand.",1329696000,11,979,4.764705882352941
4719898,1,B005LAIGW8,"Ghost rider must save boy from the Devil. First let me say I am a Nicolas Cage fan and I do not blame him for this abortion of a film. I blame the director and the writers of this pitiful excuse for a movie. If you pay full price plus the 3D charge you are in for a total rip off. I would pass on a $1.00 rental on this turd let alone the thought of paying for a blue ray copy. I fought myself not to see this pitiful movie and gave into some internet hype and radio plugs by Nick Cage but I should have went with my gut. There is no story here that is worth seeing, it is as if a 15 year old stoner came up with this plot while slamming Robitussin with his drop out buddies. This is the worst movie of 2012 so far and I pray it is the worst that I pay to see in the theater for the rest of the year. The Coup de grce is Christopher Lambert, that alone should keep you away from this turd.",1329609600,9,889,3.734042553191489
4719899,3,B005LAIGW8,"I think everyone had the urge to run outside and kick the ugliest puppy in their neighborhood when it was announced a second Ghost Rider movie was going into production starring a returning Nicolas Cage. The director of the original Ghost Rider (Mark Steven Johnson) was out and the directors of Crank (Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor) were in. Now that it's been released it's been getting nothing but a barrage of negative reviews pretty much anywhere you can think of. Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance is practically a reboot and could serve as a full on reset of the franchise if Cage wasn't attached. With everything working against this requel (that's reboot + sequel combined) and every entertainment site on the planet practically guaranteeing its atrocity, I seem to be one of the few critics in existence who was actually entertained by this movie.

Johnny Blaze (Nicolas Cage) has gone into seclusion in Eastern Europe. Johnny fights not only the urge to become The Rider, but fights to stay hidden from those who are hunting for him. That is until a man named Moreau (Idris Elba) shows up on his doorstep offering Johnny a second chance and a way to lift his curse. The offer gives Johnny a chance for revenge against Roarke (Ciarn Hinds) who's Lucifer himself in human form and the man Blaze made a deal with to become The Rider in the first place. The one catch is Johnny has to guard and protect a boy that Roarke is searching for to fulfill the prophecy of becoming the antichrist.

The main attraction to this movie was how it looked. There's this featurette that highlights just how camera oriented Neveldine and Taylor are when they come to shooting their movies. Seeing Neveldine basically risk his life rollerblading on the back of a motorcycle or hanging off of a wire along with the stuntman just to get the shot was incredibly intriguing to me. Unique perspective and fascinating camera work is something I look for in movies and Spirit of Vengeance let you know it had that in the trailers. The flaw in this method though is that even though it gets you up close and personal with the action it also feels really shaky at times. It seems very rough in comparison to dolly tracks or tripods being used. The camera work also involves those slight zoom-ins at random intervals to make it seem like the camera wasn't in the right place when they started shooting.

I'm hearing a lot of people complain about the special effects, but those are another high point. Ghost Rider's appearance is more charred in comparison to how he looked in the first movie. His skull looks scorched, his leather clothes are melted, and the steel on his motorcycle is noticeably red hot and altered thanks to his transformation. The fire looks pretty fantastic all around and there's plenty of it. Everything The Rider drives becomes engulfed in flames and the special effects crew has a ton of fun with that. Maybe it looks terrible in 3D? I was going to recommend seeing it in 2D anyway. Johnny Blaze's transformations into Ghost Rider are pretty sweet, too. Seeing his eyes sink in for the first time is a bit unsettling, but it becomes a trademark. As he holds off The Rider the majority of the movie, his eyes are the first thing to show the transformation. It was a bit reminiscent of the T-1000 being shot in the face in the steel mill at the end of Terminator 2.

Nicolas Cage is exactly what you expect him to be here. The issue is that like always he's way too over the top during intense moments and not emotional enough during the quieter ones. The best example is when Johnny Blaze and Nadya (Violante Placido) are trying to catch up with the men who took Danny (Fergus Riordan) who's Nadya's son and the boy who's set to become the antichrist. Johnny and Nadya are interrogating a man named Vasil. Notice how twitchy Cage becomes here and how crazy he becomes during his ""bad man"" and ""scraping at the door"" speech. It's pretty insane in this so bad it's good kind of way. Cage's performance seems to evolve throughout the movie and he almost seems sincere by the end of it. Cage also modeled The Rider's movements off of his pet cobra and it's blatantly obvious. His performance as The Rider is full of rigid movements, swaying motions, and quick cuts. It's very bizarre, especially when it gets to the scene where The Rider is floating around in circles on his back as if he's duplicating Trent Reznor in the Nine Inch Nails video for ""Closer.""

You'll wish Idris Elba's wine-loving Moreau had more screen time than he actually does as the Moreau character is generally pretty interesting, but doesn't really get a chance to shine. He does have a few really memorable scenes though. This will make more sense after you see it, but the ""decay vision"" gets a little bothersome. It's like looking at the action through a giant peephole or fishbowl. The evolution of the Carrigan character (played by Johnny Whitworth) is pretty awesome though.

Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance is not as bad as people are making it out to be or maybe it is and it's just really entertaining anyway. The dialogue does get really cheesy at times (""You're the devil's baby mama.""), but the story and part of the screenplay were written by David S. Goyer so that should give you a little bit of hope. The special effects are fantastic, Cage's performance eventually grows on you, and Spirit of Vengeance is a huge step up from the original movie overall. In the end, Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance is explosively entertaining and just the type of brainless fun you need to forget about a hectic week.",1329523200,4,5596,4.653185035389282
4719900,5,B005LAIGW8,"I didn't like the original Ghost Rider movie much. It wasn't very exciting, and when the action got going it was too video-game-ish for my tastes. The whole thing had the kind of generic superhero thing going on that comic adaptations have been trying to escape for a while now, and the movie overall was pretty forgettable. It only makes sense that for the sequel, the frachise recieved the perfect antidote-- the guys who directed ""Crank."" This movie is so intentionally outrageous and over-the-top that it ends up being the perfect cocktail of balls-to-the-wall action insanity. Nicolas Cage is completely unrestrained this time around, and if you love yourself a good Nicolas Cage freak-out scene as much as me, you'll love this movie.

Do not go in expecting ""The Dark Knight."" This is not a superhero movie, and it is not a serious movie either. It's an over-the-top, violent action movie with a supernatural twist. I'm amazed that it's not R-rated, but however they managed to keep it PG-13 I honestly don't care. If you like movies like Kick Ass or Drive Angry, this movie will be right up your alley. It knows that it's about Nicolas Cage with his head on fire killing people, and as such it knows not to take itself too seriously. It's the perfect mix of bad ass and funny, and the whole thing is presented in a way that feels a lot more raw and unrestrained than its predicessor. You don't even need to see the original movie to get into this one, because they did a great job of recapping the character's origin story in a way that is both funny and to-the-point.

Overall, I'm very impressed with what the new directors have done with this film, and I think it's exactly what the franchise needed. Even if the critics are trashing it and it might not do well at the box office, I really hope they come back to direct a third one. They clearly have a lot of love for his character, and at the same time they're smart enough to know exactly what it is and don't try to pretend that it's anything more.",1329523200,7,2012,4.524725274725275
4719901,2,B005LAIGW8,"""Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance"" is stunningly disappointing to fanboys. I'm a fan of the Marvel Ghost Rider comic books. I'm a fan of directors Neveldine and Taylor (loved their Crank movies). I'm a fan of Nicolas Cage. I'm a fan of mindless comic book and action films with loud explosions and soundtracks. But this movie was little better than the worst Bruce Campbell movie made in Romania for the Sci-Fi Channel. It looks like it was made on a low budget. There is little action, and what there is is visually dull. The rest of the movie is sitting around and talking.

All I wanted from this movie was some cool chase sequences, fights, and explosions. It turns out that all the good moments fit into the trailer. The car chases are dull. Ghost Rider mostly stands around rather than fights, and when he does fight it's not exciting. The 3D effect is fine but it does not add much.

""Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance"" looks like a cheap and quick made for TV movie compared to the 2011 hits ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"", ""Fast Five"", ""Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol"", ""Thor"", ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"", and ""Captain America: The First Avenger"". With so many good action and comic book movies being made now, there's no reason to spend any time or money on Rider. I went in hoping for ""Battle: Los Angeles"" and got ""Elektra"".

Reviewed 2-17-2017 after watching in 3D on opening day of its theatrical release.",1329436800,2,1432,4.6299212598425195
4719902,2,B005LAIGW8,"There's a moment in ""Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance"" where the title character is urinating a giant stream of fire, and then turns and seemingly winks right at the camera.  It's definitely an amusing moment, but it also neatly summarizes everything about this film: Though it has a dark subject matter, it's best when being goofy, and is, regrettably, not very good at everything else.

Taking place several years after the first film, ""Vengeance"" finds Johnny Blaze, AKA the Ghost Rider, riding around Europe, trying to keep the demonic spirit within him from breaking out and running amok.  Yet, when he hears that the devil himself is after a child, Blaze reluctantly takes on the task of rescuing the boy, because not only can he save the world (again), but he also has the possibility of freeing himself from his curse forever.

Despite being a sequel to 2007's, ""Ghost Rider,"" ""Vengeance"" barely feels like one.  Granted, Nicholas Cage is back, and he still turns into a flaming skeleton from time to time, but the movie has little to no connections with what came before, and feels like a music video hastily upgraded to be a feature film: the camerawork is fast and loose, with lots of miniscule zooms, the story feels barely there (who exactly made this much-talked about prophecy anyway?), and there are lots of inconsistency with it's predecessor: why is Blaze's motorcycle/outfit really different?  Why does the flashback to his contract-signing look nothing like the first film?  Why does the rider act so differently then the first time around, etc.  More often then not, ""Vengeance"" seems to be mainly focused on getting cool shots on frame, and while that can work, there's no strong backbone to guide it.  Granted, the first Ghost Rider film wasn't grade A superhero material, but it had a strong focus on Blaze's efforts to deal with his curse and trying to remove it.  Here, he just zips around makes people explode into fiery embers.

Still, ""Vengeance"" does feature some good moments.  Nicholas Cage turns in another amusing, over-the-top performance, complete with unintentionally hilarious facial expressions as he morphs between Blaze and the Rider (so much so that my theater was laughing every time he did it), and a really amusing scene involving a twinkie.  The final car chase does manage to be quite interesting, and I also liked how the film explored a little as to exactly what the Ghost Rider spirit is.

But while ""Vengeance"" does feature some amusing/cool moments of over the top craziness and action, for the most part, with it's looser and sloppy feel, and more focus on set-pieces then a focused story, it's a disappointing follow up to it's predecessor, and is ultimately not really recommended.  For die-hard Ghost Rider fans only.",1329436800,,2773,4.946120689655173

4720118,1,B005LAIGW8,"A sad departure from the first film. If this was the first installment the franchise would have sunk into obscurity on opening weekend. I will grant that the plot has potential, and that the film had a decent cast. At the end of the day however, Nicholas Cage is not the man to play the Ghost Rider. It was plausible in the first film not because of Cage, but because everything else was executed well enough to make it enjoyable. By the end of Spirit of Vengeance, however, I felt like I had just sat through two hours of an 8th grade film project. Camera angles were strange and distorted, animation was subpar, the script was almost as comical as The Wicker Man, and the Rider design was a total let down from the first film. If you are any fan of the Ghost Rider do yourself a favor and stick to the first film. Better yet, cross your fingers that some studio will reboot the franchise.

4720588,5,B005LAIGW8,VERY HAPPY WITH MY BLU RAY DVD OF GHOSTRIDER SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE. THANK YOU!!!! 5 STARS,1477526400,,87,4.5
4720589,5,B005LAIGW8,"A+ Of course it has what everyone seems to find odd, ""Cage weird."" Hello? In those scenes a demon is trying to crawl out of his skin and possess him. This film is fun and well-crafted. And it avoids the sequel problem by making a movie of a different genre - one which I thought still linked up with the first ""origin"" film very well. Hey, look, an English paper gets and A+ for doing what it sets out to do, not for being a new Shakespeare play. This film did what it set out to do very well. I was entertained. A lot. And I guess, yeah, I'd direct a third installment in the franchise no problem. I'd be happy to, and feel like I had a lot to work with, a lot to live up to, and a lot to do differently from the first two just to stay in step. Bravo. Let Cage be Cage.",1477526400,5,770,3.8797468354430378
4720590,3,B005LAIGW8,"This grittier, darker version of the Marvel Comics character Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze in this case, played here again by Nicholas Cage who seems to be becoming unhinged onscreen even as we watch) will likely please a lot of the fans of the character more than the lighter touch, brighter and poppier original. Most of the scenes herein happen at night, in lower light, and even day scenes are muted via cloud and various shadows. This dark tonality certainly fits this character but it will also make him less accessible to a larger audience. Cage is a man harried and haggard by the vengeful spirit that lives in him. Hes on edge, even psychotic, and tries to avoid confrontations because he knows whos coming. And when the Ghost Rider comes Cage barks and bites like a human bad dog (with some unintentionally bad that they're funny spfx transforming him into the flaming skull). The Ghost Rider is more like a Terminator in this film version, and he tracks down baddies including the devil incarnate who is here to claim another host body (his son, in this case). Meanwhile the plot has us follow the macguffin of Cage being freed of the Spirit and having to sacrifice his freedom in order to save the boy and stop Beelzebub.

The original had fun moments and a nice build, and was a fun and even cool surprise. I for one am an old Marvel Comics collector and Ghost Rider was never a favorite but I really enjoyed the first movie for its colorful play, Cages odd-duck daredevil, and the doomed romance between he and the gorgeous Eva Mendes. The Ghost Rider was a bad spirit hunting bad spirits and fun scenes like Blaze being thrown in the slammer were really enjoyable. However in Spirit of Vengeance we really don't get any of this. The Ghost Rider is a menace to most people, even those that Blaze is trying to help, and he never battles any wild supernatural entity except for one, and their battle is brief. Throwing in Idris Elba is a waste of that mans talent, though a surprise bit by Christopher Highlander Lambert fit this film. In concluding Ill remember that I saw this film in the theater with disappointment. I liked it better the second time around, but its not one of the good Marvel films.",1477440000,,2211,4.583333333333333

I liked the characters and I liked the attitudes. This sequel manages to be a little better than the first one, hard as that may be to believe. Cage does his usual acting job with both of his emotions; confused or sullen. By this point you pretty much stop caring what happens to him and simply watch for the FX. Now, as far as FX goes it worth watching just for that.

I'll admit the plot is a little more in line with the books but seriously, Cage? They couldn't find someone that could actually act? When I picture someone like Hugh Jackman in this it makes me want to cry.",1467417600,,738,4.197183098591549

Once again satanic spirits battle it out, this time for possession of a young kid whose questionable ancestry puts him on the short list for world domination for the forces of evil. Johnny Blaze (Nicolas Cage) in his grittier, flame-charred, greasier Ghost Rider transformation seems more focused on getting the kinks out of his skeletal neck than springing into action. Missing in action is Peter Fonda's evil Mephistopheles, replaced by demonic executive (looking more like a Sicilian don) Roarke (Ciarn Hinds).

4721063,3,B005LAIGW8,"I liked the first Ghost Rider movie. I've never read the comic books. But watching the movie, I don't think the director or writer saw the first Ghost Rider movie. There are huge differences in back story and feeling of the movie. The story had potential and some interesting new characters but bad acting, worse CGI and an odd mixed tone, undermine the good things about the movie.

However, this is one of those movies that is so over the top that it is actually kind of fun. Lense flare is so overly used in the movie that I don't think there is a 30 second stretch without it. Towards the middle of the movie during a slow stretch in the story we decided to play a little game: ""Spot the lense flare"". Needless to say our count got quite high.

Nick Cage's performance was very over the top. We thought it was probably the best, worst performance we'd ever seen.

With the right attitude adjustment, the movie is quite fun. Don't expect anything great, but if you like over the top performances and bad CGI, then you will have fun with this movie.",1459641600,,1051,4.407216494845361

4721608,5,B005LAIGW8,The first film was how he got scammed into taking A deal which in the end it was A good thing for him and bad for the giver the devil. The movie was simple and in good taste and not that frightening.  Part  2  was much darker and violent the devil wants to take possession of A boy the there are those trying to stop him on the way there's double crosses and not all evil is what it appears.,1438560000,,391,3.8625
4721609,3,B005LAIGW8,"I was pleasantly surprised by Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance, which is to say that I didn't hate it. Well, I didn't actually hate the original Ghost Rider from 2007 (itself based on an occasionally popular Marvel comic book), but aside from some neat special effects that film was pretty mediocre and I figured the sequel would be even worse. Imagine my shock when I found myself actually enjoying Spirit of Vengeance. While hardly extraordinary, the new movie is surprisingly fun.

Nicolas Cage is back as Johnny Blaze, the one-time stunt-rider now possessed by an evil spirit that transforms the unfortunate Blaze into an unstoppable beast with a thing for fiery motorcycles and a flaming skull instead of a head. Blaze is now cruising the backstreets of Eastern Europe, doing everything he can to keep the Ghost Rider at bay and himself out of harm's way. But trouble has a way of finding Blaze, and when a mysterious man named Moreau (Idris Elba) brings Blaze the strange story of a special boy on the run from the Devil (played with wicked aplomb by the great Ciarn Hinds), the haunted maverick can't turn him downespecially since Moreau promises to cure Blaze of his little problem when the boy is safe and the crisis averted. So Blaze lets the Ghost Rider come alive once again, just in time to save the kid and his mom (the gorgeous Violante Placido) from a batch of thugs. But of course, the troublefor Blaze, for Moreau, for the boy and his motheris just beginning.

While the script is hardly anything deep or profound, it is well-paced and often surprisingly witty. The script has a pleasant, self-deprecating humor underlying it all, and the various performers all seem to enjoy going along with the outlandish plot. Cage, who is a fan of comics in real life, is well-cast as Blaze, and captures the character's conflicting emotions with expert ease. Not many modern actors play villains better than Hinds, and Placido is surely on track to become one of the most sought-after actresses in the business with her rare combination of melancholy beauty and on screen intensity. There's also an unexpected but welcome role for Christopher Lambert of Highlander famethough he's nearly unrecognizable beneath a scrawl of tattoos.

Special effects are outstanding, and there are a number of out-of-this world action scenes that are major crowd-pleasing moments. The Ghost Rider himself is a fearsome spectacle, and his every appearance brings with it the gleeful anticipation that one of the movie's numerous baddies is going to get his much-deserved punishment in an especially painfuland spectacularfashion. Best of all, the script touches on the idea that we all have our inner demons to wrestle with, which is all too true, and there is even the hint that the Spirit of Vengeance is perhaps redeemable, and that somewhere deep inside even the Rider might yet harbor Good.

In a way you can't enjoy Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance if you're looking for too much, but it's not bad and at times even becomes quite good. If you're a fan of the old comic book then this is a must-see, and even general action fans probably won't regret throwing down the cash for it if they get in the right spirit of thingsthe Spirit of Vengeance, that is!",1438387200,,3248,4.846846846846847

4721816,1,B005LAIGW8,"The Ghost Rider is a motorcycle-riding flaming skeleton fueled by satanic magic, who hunts down evildoers. In other words, the most metal superhero ever conceived of.

You would think it would be impossible to mess up a concept that awesome. And yet, they managed to ruin not one but TWO Ghost Rider movies, mostly by casting Hollywood's loopiest actor as a hardcore supernatural action hero. While the special effects are excellent and Ghost Rider's rampages can be awesome, the plots are slow and riddled with gaping holes, and the second movie in particular is an incoherent mess.

""Ghost Rider"": As a teen boy, Johnny Blaze accidentally made a deal with the Devil (Peter Fonda) in exchange for curing his dying father. Of course, it didn't turn out well, and Johnny ended up with his soul belonging to El Diablo. About ten years later, Johnny (Nicolas Cage) has become a famous daredevil who is incapable of being harmed by his stupid stunts, due to that whole satanic pact thing. He's haunted by the knowledge that someday, the devil will call on him... and by his same-age-but-looks-much-younger ex-girlfriend (Eva Mendes).

Then the Devil's son, Blackheart (Wes Bentley) steals a contract that holds a thousand evil souls, which gives him incredible power for... some reason. So the Devil transforms Blaze into the Ghost Rider, a flaming-skulled motorcycle rider who brings the punishment of hell on the wicked. I guess the Devil can't defeat his wayward son, but someone who got all his powers from the Devil can. Figure that out.

And in the sequel, ""Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,"" the Devil (now played by a disgusted-looking Ciaran Hinds) is pursuing a young boy and his mother for nefarious purposes. A French priest (Idris Elba) contacts Blaze and makes a deal with him: his priesthood will.... somehow lift the curse of the Ghost Rider if Blaze saves the boy. Even though Blaze intentionally kept the Ghost Rider powers at the end of the first movie, he has now decided that they are bad and he wants them to go away.

Of course, this means that he has to go up against the Devil's minions, including gun-toting shock troops (REALLY?!) an undead demon who can cause anything he touches to rot away. But he soon discovers that both sides of this conflict are out to do something unforgivable -- so Blaze must call on his terrible powers once again, and discover what the power of the Ghost Rider truly is.

So what is the biggest death knell of the ""Ghost Rider"" duology? That would be Nicolas Cage, who is capable of great acting on occasion... but more frequently gives us memeworthy scenery-chewing and deranged laughter. He is also too old for the role (the first movie indicates that Blaze should be in his early thirties at most), and just too eccentric and non-threatening to ever be a terrifying, glorious creature worthy of a metal album cover. He's also a massive nerd and a dork, and it shows.

The best part of the story is probably the action sequences with the fully transformed Ghost Rider, which involve explosions, streams of fire, and a scene where a mining machine is turned into a vast flaming chainsaw. Of course, the mythology and rules change randomly according to what the plot demands, but.... it looks cool.

But the rest of the time, it's mesmerizingly awful. The first movie is pretty generic and bland, with the token love interest and a hole-filled plot. And the second is a mesmerizing stew of wretched ideas, bad dialogue (""You're the devil's babymama""), and editing that might give you a seizure. Seriously, I have never seen so much shakycam combined with random fast-forward and slo-mo in any movie ever, which succeeds in making an already ridiculous story even sillier.

And the movies are, quite simply, weird. There are countless bizarre things that are never explained or even played for comedy, like Roxanne consulting a Magic 8 Ball for relationship advice, or an anecdote about Ghost Rider peeing fire. It's like the movies are trying to be funny, but they play everything completely seriously.

""Ghost Rider / Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance"" reminds us why we were lucky to be spared a Nicolas Cage Superman and Batman. There is some amazing action, but it's crammed into incoherent, nonsensical masses of plotholes and insane weirdness.",1431302400,4,4300,4.886145404663923

4722361,3,B005LAIGW8,"Don't expect the quality of the first Ghost Rider in this movie. This one is very slow, though it has a great opening, it just goes downhill from there. They seem to contrive ways for Blaze to turn into Ghost Rider. Peter Fonda does not reprise his role as Roarke (the devil), instead there is an actor who does not do as good a job as Fonda did. The story seems overly contrived and predictable, it does not have the same feel as the first. Cage is older, and appears aged, worn and ragged in this film. The first thing I noticed was that Cage was just too old for this part. On one hand, that may be exactly what the writers were going for, but I felt it takes from the value of the movie. In my humble opinion.  I have been a long time cage fan from back when he did ""Raising Arizona"" But, he is just not right for this part now. He was in the original Ghost Rider, but he's just too old now. While the movie is alright, I would not give it more than 3 stars. ***Spoiler Alert*** In this story, Blaze reluctantly goes after the son of the devil, in an effort to save the child based on a promise to have his curse removed. He finds the child, has his curse removed, and then needs it again to save the child from his father the devil. How he get's his powers back and if he saves the child I will leave for you the watcher to find out, but needless to say there are better movies to watch and better ways to spend your time."" ***Spoiler Alert Over***

I would not recommend this film, it's just not worth the time. Let's hope they do another one that is better.",1412467200,,1564,4.091205211726384
4722362,3,B005LAIGW8,"Those who said this was better than the first, well, you're entitled to you opinion.  This was a half-way entertaining movie I rented because my son liked the first one (as did I). He liked this one way more than I did (he's 7).

The story is kind of lame and predictable for the most part.  There's no good segue between the end of the first one where Johnny Blaze tells Lucifer that he's going ""to own the curse and use it to protect the innocent"" (I'm paraphrasing) to him ending up living in a warehouse in some eastern Euro-trash nation.

While they may have tried to do better on the special effects, for me the result was the opposite.

The acting was over-the-top BAD, and I hate to say that about Nicolas Cage. The ""babe"" in the movie was babe-worthy but no Eva Mendes.

If you're a big fan of the first one, watch this one and make your own decisions on it's viability. I think it's worth watching but probably only once.  If you're looking for a GOOD movie to watch, move on, nothing to see here.",1412380800,,1007,4.296296296296297

Too many WTF moments, a weak script make this movie destined to suck.
The first movie was mediocre, this was WORSE!

The charred flakes coming off the Rider, his creepy odd mannerisms which lead to fear and doubt in his foes, the lightly glowing metals on his gear just short of being molten.  So many great details made this movie actually enjoyable.  Nicolas Cage needed to tone down his Jim Carrey impersonation though, that's a legitimate complaint. In most scenes, he's fine. In a few though, he escalates the annoying factor to the point of breaking the feel of the film.

Pretty bad CGI work, horrible acting by Nicolas Cage, but it was nice to see the God of Thunder for the few seconds he was on screen talking to Scorpion.

I can't imagine a sequel will be made... most likely it will be rebooted now, seeing as how everything unworthy of being rebooted is being rebooted anyway....

4722755,5,B005LAIGW8,"Frankly, I think the sequel to the original Ghost Rider movie here is much better than the first. While the first movie wasn't bad by any rate, even stretching into 'pretty good' territory at many parts within the film, Ghost Rider: Spirits of Vengeance delivers something a little... more.

It's funner. It's funnier. It's deeper. And, above all else, it has a playfulness about itself without being irreverent or outright stupid. It's a fast-paced action movie with a horror movie sheen, and many creepy moments, but nothing outright frightening. The visual effects are pretty up to snuff as well, if not great works of digital art.

I give this film five stars not because it's a masterpiece of cinema, but because it's a fun movie based off a normally shallow comic book character that has witty lines, action-packed moments, some fairly interesting character work and an oddly nice theme about it. If I had to compare it to anything, it's similar to a more 'heaven and hell' and 'grindhouse' kind of Hellboy movie, with weirdos, monsters and adventure around every corner as we follow our equally energetic and exasperated hero.

Speaking of, Nicolas Cage kills it in this film, giving Johnny Blaze, the human form of the titular Ghost Rider, a solid and likable character, while not being a cookie cutter hero type. Johnny has some serious inner demons (overlook the obvious joke), but he doesn't let them get in the way of protecting others or stopping evil... or even finding something akin to a family. Also, the whole sometimes turning into a flaming skeleton paradigm has left him a little crazier for wear.

The cast does a good job all around, with Johnny Witworth's performance as the villainous, walking wasteland Blackout being a true joy to behold. There's plenty of other fun characters within as well, who you will have to discover for yourself. Although, just as a heads up, there is a tweenaged main character amongst the cast... but don't worry, he's actually very tolerable, adds something to the cast and puts some heart into his role as well! Be thankful for the small favors, right?

To make a long story short, if you're looking to have a good time, especially with a like minded friend, and just want go for a hellacious ride with a pretty serviceable story supported by an absolutely entertaining cast, then Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance should be on your list of things to watch!",1391212800,,2412,4.844660194174757
4722756,3,B005LAIGW8,"I'm actually a little surprised that this movie got such harsh reviews. Is it good? Not really, but it is a significant improvement over the first. Yeah, Cage is terrible, and there isn't much to the story (though it is written by David S. Goyer (The Dark Knight, Man of Steel)), but it's got a STYLE that makes it worth watching.

I assume these directors got their start in music videos, because there are parts of the movie that get a little wild. There's a lot of hand-held shooting, and while many seem to complain about the special effects, I thought they were great. Ghost Rider almost had a claymation feel to him at times, with jittery movements like you'd see in a lot of modern ghost movies. Way cooler look and feel than the original.

But improving on the original isn't enough to make it a great movie. It struggles with the same problem that the two Hulk movies had... a two-dimensional character that turns into a one-dimensional monster. Nobody cares about the character, but once the monster finally comes out, you have no real attachment to it. The Hulk finally worked in The Avengers because they developed the character and made him part of an ensemble. Could this happen with Ghost Rider? Hopefully, as long as they re-cast the role (maybe Mark Ruffalo is available?).

The style and attitude of Spirit of Vengeance makes it worth watching, and in my mind elevates it above the original and many of the earlier Marvel movies (Punisher, Fantastic 4, Daredevil). It fails when compared to Avengers/X-Men/Spider-Man, but maybe it's enough to give the character a chance in the future?",1390521600,,1603,4.758992805755396

4723101,4,B005LAIGW8,"The first Ghost Rider film from 2007 was fairly faithful to the comic. When Ghost Rider came out in 1972 it was more of a general idea than a fully fleshed-out premise. This was clear as the stories changed from writer to writer and one artist to another. Ideas were added as the years progressed, like the ""penance stare"" and Blaze's growing awareness of the former angel of justice Zarathos. The book was canceled in 1983 after a ten-year run. In 1990 a new version of Ghost Rider was introduced with a different character and it ran eight years.

The first film was an amalgam of the ideas presented in these two series, mostly the first, and struck me as the comic-book come to life. Really, the only thing that was disappointing (other than Cage being too long in the tooth for the role of Johnny Blaze) was the villain, Blackheart, who was seriously scary in the comics, but fairly bland in the movie and looking totally different.

""Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance"" (2012) is a worthy follow-up with Nicolas Cage returning as Johnny Blaze. The story switches to Europe and, more specifically, Romania and Turkey, where the film was shot.

This time the devil is played by Ciarn Hinds, rather than Peter Fonda, which isn't a big deal considering Satan could presumably take different physical forms. The devil's main minion is played by Johnny Whitworth, a different character than Blackheart from the original, albeit similar. The hot female is Violante Placido, who's arguably better than Eva Mendes. Another positive is the rockin' soundtrack.

I don't mind the story switching to Europe since the locations are excellent, particularly the amazing cave-monastery, but there are other changes that I'm not so crazy about, like the charred biker jacket of the Ghost Rider, but this is just a matter of taste; I simply prefer the cool ""costume"" as opposed to the dirtbag biker look. A more significant negative is the overactive camera that's annoying and draws attention to itself. I can't wait for this ""hip"" fad to pass.

BOTTOM LINE: ""Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance"" is a quality sequel that interestingly fleshes out the nature of the spirit that possesses Johnny blaze (I'd say more, but I don't want to spoil it). People who claim the film's more ""serious"" and ""faithful"" to the comic are off the mark. It has the same quasi-serious, cartoony-horror vibe as the first film, with glimpses of humor. As radical as the first movie was (in a comic booky way), this one ups the ante and is the better for it. Unfortunately it's marred by the hyperactive camera.

The film runs 96 minutes.

4723102,3,B005LAIGW8,"This film is well , not a good movie in a lot of ways.  The guys who did 'rrank' did it. and they decided to go over the top. They even nick cage to act in a most nutty way. This was a disaster for this franchise. The ghost rider is not a campy , nutty character.  I did like the explosive action in this though but you should never encourage nick cage to go over the top, unless it's a scene or two and not every line. In the really good 'vampires' kiss' movie it worked because the character was going mad. (That's a nick cage flick from the 80's). But not in this one. The first movie was played more serious. Now if the Ghost Rider was a character that is going mad then all the weird and wacky scenes might work, but he's not , he's tormented and dark. Well we got wacky here. still this is a high budget movie and not the worst movie ever made. Seriously , people who say that have not seen the many b movies I have, or c movies, or d movies. NOthing is as bad a d movie. (people with camera and no experience), this is rather a schlocky version of the ghost rider and that's a shame.  There is a documentary on this one and some previews. The villain here was a good one , a carrion man, but they did a strange bubble effect that wasn't needed when he attacks. This movie may have ended the careers of the filmmakers, It's happened before. But they do make some good action camp flicks. They just weren't real fans of the ghost rider probably. Comics are cool and these guys strayed into a rather comedic approach sometimes.  Buy this for the great 3d conversion. And it does look great. Unlike lets say 'I robot'.  Which is not a good conversion. Or even worse the many german 3d conversions of films like 'daybreakers'. So this is entertaining , but it's also very campy and such.",1378166400,2,1789,4.173913043478261
4723103,3,B005LAIGW8,"While sticking closer to the comic book roots of the character, and with improved visuals and environments, this second installment of the GR franchise lacks the villainous touch of Wes Bentley, with no antogonists really posing a threat to GR, nor has Cage's take on the Human or Demon form of the Rider improved much on the second go around. The 3D is done well, and it does add to the film, but despite the much darker and ""hellish"" visuals in the film, they cannot hide the mediocre writing or the whimsy overacting that ruins the main character.",1375747200,2,550,4.622448979591836
4723104,2,B005LAIGW8,"The first Ghost Rider was pretty bad, but surely you can't get any worse, right guys?  ...I should really stop asking stupid questions like that: of course it could be worse!  Aliens vs. Predator Requiem proved their can be a worse film than Alien vs. Predator and so now we have Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance.  Although, I will say, as bad as it is, as someone who enjoys seeing Nicolas Cage unleashed this movie was more entertaining than the first Ghost Rider (more entertaining in this case =/= ""better"").

Right off the bat we're thrust into the story.  A French, gun wielding priest (played so over the top by Idris Elba it reaches hilarity) is in search of a boy who is to be the vessel of the Devil.  They enlist the Ghost Rider (who has moved to Europe since the first film) to help protect him.  Along the way they must fight thugs, cultists, and a villain endowed with the powers of decay.

Sound interesting to you?  No?  Let's be honest: No one actually cares about the plot of this movie.  Anyone going into this movie only really wants to see a biker with a flaming skull for a head beat around baddies for 90 minutes.  Something that was  NOT satisfied in 2007's Ghost Rider.

You may remember that the first Ghost Rider seemed to spend more of its budget of shots of Ghost Rider randomly destroying public property than actually fighting the bad guys.  Going into this I was thinking ""If Ghost Rider is actually fighting bad guys the whole time this might be more enjoyable.""  Well, he certainly fights more

Within the first two minutes Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance makes it clear that the action will be shot with the most deplorable use of shaky cam outside of a found-footage film.  The action is incomprehensible most of this movie and is highlighted by random bits of hilarity (such as the Rider spinning around slowly in mid-air for no apparent reason).  Ghost Rider converting a giant earth mover into a giant flaming buzz saw is the best action visual in the film, but inspiration like that only strikes the filmmakers a single time and they gave it away in the ads.  Towards the end there is a chaser sequence where Ghost Rider commandeers a truck and I swore they were about to do a tribute to the famous chase from Raiders of the Lost Ark, but it went absolutely nowhere.

How about Ghost Rider himself? To be honest, I like the grimy, dirty look Ghost Rider has in this film.  While technically the special effects aren't as good (Spirit of Vengeance has about half the budget of the first film) I much prefer the look of this Ghost Rider.  He looks burnt, he looks like something that came from the pits of hell.  He may not look as iconic as the traditional design used in the first film, but I feel this is a better look for a live action Ghost Rider.

This time out Nicolas Cage is off the hook, and when you let him off his chain he typically turns in enjoyable (see: crazy) performances.  If you're a filmmaker and you have Nic Cage in your movie it is a disservice to the viewers if you aren't allowing him to go all out.  Especially in something as bad as Spirit of Vengeance.  If you entered this movie because you heard Nicolas Cage was doing motion capture for Ghost Rider and ""based his performance off a cobra"" then Cage does not disappoint.

However the transformation scenes are not improved.  In fact I'd say the transformation sequences are hilarious and seem reminiscent of the special effects found in The Mask.  It is incredibly goofy and not the least bit frightening.  You could say that they're trying to capture some insanity with the character, but even then its more silly than ""crazy"".

Nothing really worth talking about once we get past Cage.  Aside from the over the top performance of Idris Elba no one else in this film is really worth mentioning.

Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance is a bad movie.  The characters are absurd, Cage and Elba are the only ones who seem to be enjoying themselves, the plot is derivative, and if you're a fan of the comics .  It is worse than the 2007 film on every critical level...but I will admit, in a guilty pleasure sort of way Spirit of Vengeance is a more entertaining film due to its own stupidity.  The first Ghost Rider was boring.  At least this one had me constantly gawking at how silly it could get.

So there you have it.  If you're looking for silly movie to watch with some friends, or are just into seeing Nicolas Cage freak out on screen you'll probably get a kick out of seeing this.  While I admit I was entertained by its absurdity I can't bring myself to score this movie any higher.  Its undeniably a poorly made, forgettable film, but if you're into this sort of bad film than it wouldn't hurt to rent Spirit of Vengeance.",1375660800,,4746,4.4825174825174825

4723184,2,B005LAIGW8,"It's not the worst super hero movie ever made, but it's still not very good. A lot of the two director's ideas for Ghost Rider are just lame. His skull is less flaming than it was in the first film, he walks oddly like he's drunk, his cheesy visual illusions are pointless & stupid, his demonic stair looks way less cool than it did in the first movie or in the comics. It was even better looking as a Super move in that crappy Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3 game. Also, even with the cheap ability to now simply touch someone to set them on fire, it seems rather easy to kick this drunken Ghost Rider's butt.

The only cool they added to Ghost Rider is an ability to touch & turn vehicles into demonic weapons that Ghost Rider can then control, but it doesn't save the movie. The plot isn't too bad by most comic book movie standards, but the writing is kind of dull & the film can be rather slow at times. The Ghost Rider's host, Johnny Blaze (played by Nicolas Cage), isn't a very interesting character to watch other than the ocassional & halarious mental break down.

So far, I actually like the filming style of the film's two director's (Taylor & Neveldine) in other films like Crank & Gamer, but I think they could have done way better with Ghost Rider. Overall, Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengence isn't the worst, but its not really good. Costing about $10 to stream it for rent on Amazon Instat Video, it's really hard to recommend this film as even a rental. I'd rather watch something else like, for example, even the first Ghost Rider movie.

When i saw it i loved and hated it. Lets start with why i hated it..................

-Dislikes-
The acting is awful and embarrassing to watch.
The plot is not really there
Johnny Blaze is aimed at kids more than teens-adults he does & says things that are just stupid immature and pointless
Ghost Rider is strange he acts strange and moves weirdly
When ghost rider wants to ""come out"" johnny acts weird and crazy
Johnny acts to strange at times.

Now that you heard the bad lets go to the good!

-Likes-
The Effects are AMAZING!
Ghost Rider looks more bad-ass in this one
I enjoyed how everything he touched turned into a ""ghost rider"" type thing.
The editing & camera angles were creative and unique
The action was top notch and exciting

As you can see this movie was more about effects than story & acting but you should watch it once.

HUGE fan of the original Ghost Rider - that Nicholas Cage, laughing aside, was a pretty good character for this, and the story was well told.  This one, maybe not so much.  Obviously Fonda wasn't involved, but there really should have been a bit of a discussion on why a TOTALLY different dude was playing the role?  Also, the story was...shall we say, kinda weak.

That said, the HD is solid, the saturation is perfect, and the sound is awesome.  So if you're a major Ghost Rider fan, grab it.  If not, Red Box is likely a pretty good option.",1372291200,,717,4.2518518518518515

4723272,2,B005LAIGW8,"Well after the first one what do you expect? Lol

I watched this on a bored Saturday night so I could have something on in the background. The bar was set very low because I had expected this to be a miserable movie to laugh at. I was moderately surprised to find that this wasn't a complete disgrace but an okay flick to have as background noise.

The acting is pretty poor and Nicolas Cage comes off the entire time like a dad trying to convince his kids he's cool. The dialogue goes from cheesy to just embarrassing, the script is shallow and boring and nothing really memorable is brought to the screen. Even the fight scenes between demons are boring. With so much material to work with they really seemed to go out of their way to do a half assed job.

However, this movie gets so bad that it becomes something to mildly chuckle at and I'm sure it'd be even funnier with friends. It's filled with a grown man acting angsty and silly, one scene is of him staring into nothingness as he broods away to a boring soundtrack. His fight to gain control over his own body is really just him screeching and yelling random things that are suppose to sound intimidating but are really just laughable at best. I mean this line right here ""You will tell me or I will eat your stinking soul!"" ...really? That's what a demon of Hell is going to yell?

This movie isn't good but knowing it wouldn't be it turned into a funny time burner. Though, as I wrote out this review and thought it over I'm going to deduct another star because it was really, really stupid lol

I got this movie for free at the library and would pay about 2-3 dollars to own it just to laugh at again.",1368316800,,1665,4.289808917197452

4723315,2,B005LAIGW8,"(Spoilers? Only a little, but yes.)

Ghost Rider 2! I loved the first movie! It was awesome! It was so cool! the story was good, the romance, the comedy, the graphics, the actors (Nicholas Cage was awesome), everything. loved.
So you can probably guess how excited I was for 2.
But I was let down after watching it. Ghost Rider 2 is good, but not no where near as good as the first movie in my opinion.
Nicholas was once again, amazing like always, but I didn't like any of the other actors. I couldn't believe there acting. Also the change of the 'satan' actor was a 'woah, why?' moment for me. (And I was hoping they would have at least said something about the girl from movie 1, but they didn't.)
But that's not the only thing I disliked about this movie.
The graphics where poor imo. Sure, Ghost Rider did look cool with the more detail to the skull and burnt look, but thats about it for me.
And the story was another one of thos cliche 'mom and and boy on the run from bad guys and must be saved' type of stories I have seen a million times.

Overall the movie was good, but I was honestly expecting more.

If your not really expecting anything majorly epic or awesome (like me), just your avrg awesome, and just want to see more Ghost Rider, of course you should watch it. =]",1367971200,,1283,4.25

The Blu Ray looks and sound great adding to the enjoyment and the supplements are OK. If you're a Ghost Rider fan, this is a step in the right direction and should appeal to fans who aren't expecting Spider Man/ Iron Man quality films. Fans of the first one seem to hate this one and vice versa, still there is a great Ghost Rider film to made and neither of the films are it. ..at least they didn't release two versions of the film on separate releases with this film.",1367712000,,757,4.256944444444445

4723322,4,B005LAIGW8,"I was in the military when Ghost Rider first hit the stands. I bought every one I could lay my hands on but they were not everywhere . I would ask and the answer was generally the same ( I don't sell enough of them ) . I have some of those comics and when comics became an investment I tried to cash them in . You know what, they were not worth anything. Some are retailed at two to three hundred now but that is only since the movies.
Anyone who reads books and then watches a movie based on that literature will say it is not as good as the book. Screen plays are not books and movies have to appeal to a large audience to break even. They are supposed to make money and of course this franchise Does. This , a good movie visually and the 3- D is pretty good on my home screen works for me. The story is secondary to the action as it should be in this type of film. I enjoyed it as I did the first mostly because it is not the comic book which is in no way literature . The writers and illustrators never claimed they were. True to the character is fine by that characters fans but truth is Ghost rider has always had a limited fan base and I am sure there are those who see the movies , buy a comic and are disappointed .  I think old fans of the comic see or imagine ourselves as lone wolves like the Rider and probably should not criticize . My rating is based on my opinion of how my taste run and this movie entertained me as it probably did for many that do not do reviews . One other thing I would like to say is , most of the shows and movies I have enjoyed the most were hated by critics and if you will check the most successful usually are.

4723478,2,B005LAIGW8,"Wait a minute; I thought the Ghost Rider could only appear in darkness and/or night?  If I'm not mistaken, didn't they make a great to-do about that in the first installment of this franchise?  In this film he comes and goes whenever he pleases or displeases, with a newly improved fiery skull puss.
As for the story, Ghost Rider takes a road trip to Europe.  Why?  Why not?  He soon runs afoul of mercenary gun running drug dealer Ray Carrigan (Johnny Whitworth, the guy who used to be in CSI: Miami), and soon learns monks can be treacherous (Christopher Lambert in a bit-bit-bit part, face totally obscured by a lot of bad notices).  There's also a new demon on board (Ciaran Hinds) with a new name to go with his sour puss.
This time, the filmmakers try to dazzle us with a few tricks such as occasionally punctuating the story with cartoon interludes/explanations and a mess of split screens.  Nicolas Cage over uses his penchant for squirrely behavior in lieu of acting (funny faces and cat calls aside, were his shorts pinching him or what?).  Half of the RULES they set up to explain things they just as quickly ignored.  There's some prophecy mumbo jumbo, and we quickly learn that even though you tell everyone you have VAST power, you still have to employ inadequate henchmen to do your dirty deeds and resort to sedation instead of overpowering your subject with your vast reserve of POWER.
Although they threw everything in their kit and caboodle at the screen it still came off as just a lot of smoke and very little fire.  (Loved the not-so-snappy rejoinders: ""road kill"" and ""go home!""  That's telling them Nicolas.  You sure put them in their place.  Next time, get a script.

4723637,2,B005LAIGW8,"Nicolas Cage's Johnny Blaze is back in ""Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance,"" but for what? Apparently Johnny is given a chance to reclaim his soul if he succeeds in retrieving a boy name Danny (Fergus Riordan), and Danny is kidnapped by a young gangster Ray Carrigan (Johnny Whitworth enjoying the role) in the pay of evil Roarke (Ciarn Hinds replacing Peter Fonda). Will Ghost Rider take his soul back? In that case, what will he be? But are you really interested?

Unlike its predecessor, which may not be a masterpiece but is still entertaining, the sequel directed by Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor of ""Crank"" fame, seems not to care about its story. Curiously, the least interesting character in the film is Johnny Blaze/Ghost Rider himself, for which the film has been made. David S. Goyer's story (screenplay by Goyer and Scott M. Gimple & Seth Hoffman) just goes on and on, not knowing where it is going.

I know Neveldine and Taylor's restless filming style and I enjoyed their ""Crank"" I thought their unique camera work might work in an action film featuring an anti-superhero on a motorcycle with a flaming skull, but somehow the result was underwhelming. Ghost Rider just needs better editing, better writing and most of all a much stronger enemy to fight.

4723718,2,B005LAIGW8,"The accursed Ghost Rider is hired by a secret sect of religious monks in the hopes of rescuing a young boy from the devil's grasp in exchange for his soul, a battle that will rage across Eastern Europe as The Rider takes on the forces of Hell atop his fiery motorcycle! CRANK directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylorn attempt to inject the same high-energy aesthetic in to the GHOST RIDER reboot, with disastrous results. SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE comes off looking like an unscripted mess, almost as if it were shot as an amateur music video for some no-name rock group. Nicolas Cage is as awful as ever. Why even bother rebooting the series only to bring back the single worst element from the original film? SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE takes a darker approach to the material that falls more closely in line with the comics, sacrificing the kid-friendly attitude from before in lieu of the increased action and horror. Ghost Rider has received a major overhaul as well, his charred skull and blistering costume being the only welcomed changes to the character. When standing before his enemies or blazing down the highway on his hellish motorcycle, he is an awesome sight to see. The remaining effects are uneven at best, and take a dive during the ugly transformation sequences. With a pointless excuse for a plot is hard to ignore, GHOST RIDER: SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE offers little more than the occasional eye-candy.

4724021,2,B005LAIGW8,"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance is billed as a sequel to 2007's Ghost Rider starring Nicholas Cage as Johnny Blaze and Peter Fonda as the Devil. But the producers apparently couldn't get Peter Fonda to reprise his role as the dark lord, so they got Ciaran Hinds (""Bill Clinton"" in the TV miniseries Political Animals) to fill in for Fonda. Other than those two actors, I didn't recognize any other cast member, and neither will you.  The producers  apparently didn't want to bog the budget down with a lot of expensive acting talent.

Nicholas Cage reprises his role as Johnny Blaze, a small time motorcycle stunt rider who makes a deal with the devil that makes him vessel of a powerful biker demon. But gone is any sense that Blaze is the modern equivalent of Evel Knieval  with packed stadiums and throngs of fans. This movie finds Johnny Blaze somewhere in Europe (it's never really clear to me) battling evil minions hell-bent on kidnapping the Devil's illegitimate son from a bunch of priests who belong to a heavily armed religious sect that is vaguely Catholic. A wine loving Afro-French priest recruits Blaze to protect the child from the forces of evil. From that point on it's a lot of death metal music and flaming vehicles.

The actions sequences weren't nearly as well crafted as I remember them being in Ghost rider (2007). The sequel wasn't nearly as visually impressive as I expected. Of course I saw the first movie in a theater, and watched the newer film on the big flat screen at home. I'll stipulate that Spirit of Vengeance was advertised as a 3D movie and I didn't see it in that format. Maybe it looked better in 3D. But the creature himself just seemed stiff and moved more like a Frankenstein monster than the savagely aggressive and more nimble creature in the first movie. Also, Ciaran Hinds's Devil seems to have only a fraction of Peter Fonda's supernatural power and must resort to hiring thugs and Euro-ninjas, and transporting himself on trains (why is the lord of evil taking public transport?) and in automobiles. In fact he appears to be a lot less powerful than the Ghost Rider himself. It's explained away in exposition, but I chalk it up to lazy writing. In the end he must resort to fleeing in a Porsche SUV while Blaze gives chase in a flaming truck.

I have no idea if Peter Fonda was even offered the chance to reprise his role. But I like to think that Fonda read the screenplay and decided to pass so as to preserve what's left of his career. The screenplay was the weakest part of the movie. The dialogue sounds like it could have been written 9th grade fan of Metallica  who asked for auto shop only to have his councilor stick him in creative writing. The absence of Fonda was a major loss. He has a lot of personal charm which made his devil all the scarier.

Ghost Rider (2007) was at least a fun interpretation of the Marvel Comics character, and had a certain supernatural logic to it. The producers of Spirit of Vengeance decided to ignore everything good from the first movie and start from near scratch. So there's no jumping his Harley over 20 busses or Carpenters music. Johnny Blaze seems to have lost his quirkiness and just gotten dark and bitter. In short, Spirit of Vengeance is not nearly as fun a movie as its predecessor.",1356998400,,3288,4.598976109215017

Cage has given Johnny Blaze a crazy, quirky aspect that makes Ghost Rider even stranger.  This may have been patterened after later Ghost Rider comics; maybe the 1990s era books.

The appearance of the rider is different as well. In the first movie, the skull was white, he worn a jacket with spikes, and hs chain wrapped around him. He was out for justice, but not ""HUNGER"" or ANGER. His motorcycle was totally different and sleeker as well as a little scary, but in the second, not as menancing as the first one.

4724321,4,B005LAIGW8,"This movie was closer to the comics than the first. It used the visual `style' from the comics, and totally incorporates it into the movie. Think Sin City..... People criticized Nicholas Cage, but he really portrayed the insanity of the Ghost Rider, and the panic instilled in the comic book character. The Ghost Rider special effects are even better in this movie.

Ciar'an Hines is excellent as Roarke (the Devil on Earth).

Best scenes...the Ghost Rider taking over the gigantic Digger Machine...AWESOME! Johnny Whitworth (Carrigan) reborn by the Devil into a creature of decay. Everything he touches, peole, sandwiches, an apple, all rots and decays in his hands. Until he grabs a Twinkie, and nothing happens. Cracked me up. And Whitworth . is even better after he becomes The Decayer

Other nice move was Christopher Lambert as the Order Priest. Perfect casting, even it was for one minute. I man, how cool is it to have The Highlander do a cameo?

As to the plot, the Ghost Rider ends up being the protector of Nadya and her son, who just happens to be the mother of the Son of Satan, Danny (Fergus Riordan). There is a lot of The Terminator 2 in the story. Do not judge this flick until you've seen it.

4724535,3,B005LAIGW8,"With the box office success of the 2007 film ""Ghost Rider"", a character based on the popular Marvel Comics supernatural anti-hero, there was no doubt that Columbia Pictures and Marvel would once again work on a sequel.

But rather than work on a sequel, producers Ari Arad and Avi Arad wanted to go in a different direction, to focus more on a reboot of the character and showcase Johnny Blaze/Ghost Rider.  So, for ""Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance"", the producers decided to bring in ""Crank"" and ""Jonah Hex"" directorial team Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor.  Brought in to write the screenplay was David S. Goyer (""The Dark Knight"", ""The Dark Knight Rises"", ""FlashForward""), Scott M. Gimple (""Life"", ""The Walking Dead"", ""FlashForward"") and Seth Hoffman (""Prison Break"", ""House M.D."").

Actor Nicolas Cage would reprise his role as Johnny Blaze/Ghost Rider and Ciaran Hinds as Roarke.  Starring in the film are Violante Placido (""The American, ""Che ne sara di Noi""), Idris Elba (""Thor"", ""28 Weeks Later"", ""The Wire""), Johnny Whitworth (""Limitless"", ""3:10 to Yuma"", ""Empire Records"")  and Fergus Riordan (""Fragile"", ""I Want to be a Soldier"").

VIDEO:

""Ghost Rider: Spirits of Vengeance"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1).  The great news is that the film looks fantastic on Blu-ray.  Shot on digital, the film features wonderful detail from the CG work of Ghost Rider, to the clarity of details of Ghost Rider's jacket, Johnny Blaze's transformation, the use of fire and flame effects and much more!  The colors are vibrant and videophiles should be pleased by the detail of the film.  With that being said, the weakness which many people felt about the film is shooting the film via handheld.  Many disliked it, I personally was not too bothered by it.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

As for the lossless audio, ""Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance"" is presented in English, French and Spanish 5.1 DTS-HD MA and an English-Audio Descriptive track plus Catalan 5.1 Dolby Digital.  As one would expect from an action-driven film, this film is immersive.  The soundscape in you room is filled with audio from all over, thanks to its use of directional sound coming from the surround channels.  From the Ghost Rider taking control of various vehicles (including one behemoth vehicle), a chase scene with many crash scenes and explosions and windows and glass shattering, to the many guns being fired in the film, especially heavy artillery, the lossless soundtrack is fantastic!

Subtitles are in English, English SDH and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES

""Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance"" comes with the following special features:

  Directors Expanded Video Commentary - A video commentary featuring filmmakers Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor.  While the two are shown frequently during the commentary, we also see a video of the film but also a smaller video section in the corner featuring the actual filming of a certain scene.  There is no doubt that Neveldine and Taylor bring a lot of humor to the audio commentary, but depending on one's taste, some may find it funny and others may find it annoying.  But it's an informative but off-the-cuff type of commentary that you usually don't hear in a film.
  Deleted Scenes - (11:20) A total of six deleted scenes.
  The Path to Vengeance: Making Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance - (1:25:00)  A six-documentary which can be watched in full or by each part.  Featuring ""Blazing New Path"" (8:31, Discussion of not wanting to make a sequel but a new film/reboot), ""Patience is Not a Virtue: Pre-Production"" (25:31, working on the script, hiring the cast and more), ""We Will Burn This City to Bitter Ashes (8:50, about filming in Eastern Europe), ""To Hell and Back: Production"" (23:41, from shooting the film, makeup and more), ""Walking in Both Worlds: Post-Production"" (15:32, the digital effects of the film) and ""The Fires of Hell Will Purify You: Release"" (8:41, test screenings, promoting the film at Comic-Con and more).
  Previews - Sony Pictures Home Entertainment trailers.

EXTRAS:

A code is included with the Blu-ray release to watch and access the full-length movie  via the cloud through Ultraviolet.

JUDGMENT CALL:

As a comic collector during my child up to my college years, ""Ghost Rider"" was a title that I did purchase and collect.  And to tell you the truth, when this sequel came out, I was a bit excited because I thought the film would feature Danny Ketch and the character known as Vengeance.

But instead, it was a film to showcase Ghost Rider, his powers (using newer technology than what was used in the first film) and showcase Johnny Blaze and the battle he faces each day with the demon inside him. And while I did like seeing the craziness of Johnny Blaze, thanks to Nicolas Cage's portrayal of the character, the film was all action with a storyline that seemed to be created around the action.

We have the cool Idris Elba show up as the often inebriated priest Moreau, but unfortunately, his character was never fully developed.  We see the beautiful Violante Placido as Nadya, who was featured heavily in the first half of the film but yet she nearly disappears for the second half until the end.

So, I was bit surprised because I expected a lot from David S. Goyer, who did a fantastic job with the screenplay of ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Batman Begins"", but the film seems to embody more action as his previous screenplays that he did for films like ""Blade"" and ""Blade II"".  But I wouldn't be surprised if the screenplay was rewritten and retweaked for budgetary reasons and molded for the directorial style of filmmakers Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor.

Personally, having read the ""Ghost Rider"" comic books, the film really needs to take a darker step forward.  While the visual effects of this film was good, having a story with Ghost Rider around a young boy, just doesn't seem right.  It reminds me of Marvel comic books of the '80s when Spider-Man, Captain America and other superheroes would hang out with children (which was understandable as the demographic targeted was children), but in today's superhero films, I definitely don't want to see a superhero film that revolves around a child, especially with a dark character such as Ghost Rider.

While the popcorn action will definitely entice those who expect Ghost Rider to kick some ass, the step to a more darker Ghost Rider was cool to see visually, but the action and visual effects can only go so far.  Personally, they need to get out of the Roarke storyline and possibly consider focusing on a storyline featuring Ghost Rider vs. another Marvel hero (which usually happens in the comic books), a hero that possibly Marvel may want to look into giving the character its own film.  May it be the return of Blade or Iron Fist/Luke Cage, Dr. Strange or even Ghost Rider vs. Vengeance if need be.  And both working together in taking on a greater evil.

As for the Blu-ray release, ""Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance"" does look and sound great on Blu-ray, that is a major plus!  And whether or not you enjoy the humorous video commentary by filmmakers Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor, at least the guys are able to defend the film and even have fun joking around about the film despite how many critics disapproved of the film.

Overall, ""Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance"" was a step forward in terms of visual effects and going for a more darker feel, but its storyline was taking several steps backward.  To have a bad ass character such as Ghost Rider featured in a screenplay that revolves around a kid... what a way to dampen the enthusiasm for fans expecting so much from an iconic Marvel Comics antihero!

Ghost Rider deserves much better, as has the other Marvel superheroes have received in their own films.  A better storyline to balance out the incredible action.

""Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance"" will appeal to movie fans who love films (especially Blu-ray releases) with plenty of action.  Just don't watch this film having high expectations, or else you will be disappointed.",1352419200,,8034,4.906666666666666
4724536,4,B005LAIGW8,"Nicolas Cage returns as Johnny Blaze, a man who made a deal with the devil and has regretted it ever since, but when a mysterious man seeks him out and asks him to protect a boy being pursued by mercenaries, Blaze sees his chance to finally rid the curse that turns him into Ghost Rider in the presence of evil. Only the mercenaries aren't just working for anyone, and the task will put Blaze head-to-head with the very evil he's been running from.

There's really not much to say about `Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance' other than it's a fun, mindless ride directed by the guys who did `Crank' and is shot in the same quick-cut, hyper-kinetic vein that they used in that film and it really injects some intensity into the action, that and the improved special effects make for some impressive set-pieces. I can't really speak to character development, because there's little of that and the story is on shaky ground as it is, but then that's not really why you see this film. It's perfect for if you just want to see something where you don't have to think too much.",1352332800,,1067,4.5
4724537,5,B005LAIGW8,"HI
this movie was one that going in to,i had NO HOPE FOR. Having said that.....I LOVED IT.

WARNING SPOILERS FROM HERE ON.IF YOU WANT TO BE KEPT IN THE DARK ABOUT THE PLOT LEAVE NOW

THE RIDERS newest adventure picks up 8 years after the first(however the origin is changed)with johnny blaze living a life of
torture. Blaze is hired to retreave a boy. Who turns out has strong ties to blazes power and its originator.
now the magority of critics hated on this movie from its lousey special affects to cages overacting.
I disagree. Sure the cgi isint the greatest but the rider looks great...I believe that A LOT of the probs people had with this tale of action and fire was CHRISTIAN background. When the first movie came out there was flak. This one got it worse. ANTICHRIST,HEAVEN AND HELL,
BIBLICAL BASIS. People aren't going to like that.
Any body familiar with GHOST RIDER are going to know this and it is this reason that ghost rider is one of my all time fav heros.
i find that 90 percent of people i talk to can only complain about the basis..THOR is one of my favs also...he is based on a NORSE GOD yet people don't complain about that do they? People don't like things when they hithome to hard...i am in no way one of those people that like to throw GOD in peoples face...andthor and the norse legends are very intersting to me. ilove that movie..and the comics... but that is my opinion on this movie.. now ill get to good and bad

 PROS
the action is very well done...
cage has realy taken to the role(cage has a GR tatoo and is a fan of the character)
the story is a place were the movie shines.
 pretty much everything about this movie TO ME was awesome
his skull is chared leaving behind the white fresh kull of the fist movie
there are alot of little hints to the comics as well as to the BIBLE
the acting was imo very well done

CONS
 THE RIDERS outfit has changed he nolonger has the spikes and buckles

The blu-ray for this one was so clear and crystal in sound. If only all movies come out with the same blu-ray treatment this one did. The action was non stop. I loved the fact that the ""Crank"" creator's Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor did not add a sappy love story to this one unlike the other one. They know how to make good fast paste action. I can only hope that with Neveldine/Taylor and Nicolas Cage retuning they will make a direct sequel to this one. I put it like that because the action style and camra movements is what seperated this one from the other one. Plus different filmmakers other than Nic.

He does not add to the film at all.  Not that it matters too much, because the script is bad, the acting is bad, the special effects are so so.  The actions scenes are decent though.  On Blu-Ray, this movie is a lot easier to stomach than the big screen.  Here you can FF to the good parts and ignore the bad.  Still, you have way too much of Nicolas Cage and not enough of the Ghost Rider.  A similar problem with the first movie.  When I pay money to see a film called the Ghost Rider, I want to see the Ghost Rider, not Nicolas Cage!!!!  The might have just as well called the movie ""Johnny Blaze, w/cameo's of the Ghost Rider"". If you must see this film, then Blu-Ray is certainly the way to go.",1351555200,,982,4.057291666666667

4724629,4,B005LAIGW8,"Ghost Rider:Spirit of Vengeance(released Feb/12) stars Nicholas Cage as the Ghost rider,Johnny Blaze,Johnny Whitworth as Ray Carrigan,Fergus Riordan as Danny,Ciarn Hinds as Roarke,Violante Placido as Nadya,Danny's mother,and Idris Elba as Moreau. This installment of the movie franchise(yes,you bet there will be sequels),is a film onto itself,that is you don't need to have seen the first to get this one. Also it has a far greater sense of humour and a more balls-to-the-walls dynamic than the previous venture,and I liked it.
The plot finds the Rider in eastern Europe. A black Frenchman by the name of Moreau is after protecting a boy named Danny and his mother Nadya. They are on the run from one Ray Carrigan,who works for none other than the devil himself,this incarnation going by the name of Roarke. The pair don't stop to accept Moreau's help as they're too busy fleeing from Ray,and just by the skin of their teeth.
Moreau seeks out and finds the Ghost Rider and asks him to help him to find and protect Danny,and in exchange he will rid Johnny Blaze of his inner demon. The bargain made,they set out to find and confront Ray and his boys,and get Danny back. At one point a confrontation of gigantic proportions takes place in a quarry. Ray has rendezvoused with an arms dealer who allows him the use of a bunker busting bazooka. The Ghost Rider appears and Ray goes to work,but nothing stops the Rider who ends up tearing the entire contingent of men there apart,using an immense digger that comes to life in flames. Ray is seemingly dead and the Rider has both mother and Danny,safe for the moment.
They arrive at a monastery where the monks hide the boy and his mother for their own safety and the Rider undergoes a cleansing ritual of sorts within the monastery's catacombs. Before he does we learn that it was an ancient angel that was taken down to hell and turned mad,that now inhabits Blaze's body. When the Rider comes out,the demon within is gone,as Moreau promised,but the monks are now bent on killing the boy,as he is the child of Satan and must be taken care of before the devil comes to inhabit his body. Before the monks can perform their duty,Ray re-appears,now risen from the dead by the devil and given enhanced powers. He kills each monk but Johnny and company are powerless to stop Ray from taking the boy to Roarke.
The scene switches to Turkey at an ancient site of ruins,where the devil will transfer himself into Danny. Johnny and Moreau storm the ceremony and the shooting begins. Moreau is killed in the ensuing struggle by Ray and Johnny is captured and about to be killed by Ray also. However Danny stops Johnny's death by seconds,walks up to Johnny and taking Johnny's head in his hands gives him back his Ghost Rider powers once more. Roarke and Ray,however,get away with Danny.
A high speed pursuit takes place in which Ray is killed and the vehicle with the devil and Danny is sent out of control and ends up upside down at the side of the road. The Rider whips out his chain and sends the devil back home,and then revives an apparently deceased Danny with the good spirit of justice from the original angel inside of him. The Rider himself now appears in blue flames,riding into the distance. Fade to black.
I love the sense of humour in this film and the much more intense dynamic that Johnny/the Rider exhibits;harkening back to the comics. We see Johnny's control,what he ever had of it,is now not as strong as it used to be,as the spirit within has grown much stronger since we last saw him. We also learn about the ancient spirit that inhabits his body,that IT was driven mad,which explains Johnny's ever perverse and growing behavioral change. Also someone has FINALLY explained and shown,what happens to such a character as the Rider,when on fire and in his full glory,when he has to go to the washroom!! He explains it to Danny,and I won't give away the answer if you haven't seen it,but it is to die for,so to speak. There are some plot weaknesses in the film,such as Moreau's back story and Nadya's disappearance and sudden reappearance from Eastern Europe to Turkey. I am wondering whether an extended version might help explain these two points better.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include deleted scenes only.
All in all a step up,I think,from the original film as it pushes the whole kit and kaboodle up a notch,with some interesting developments in Blaze's character and alter ego. The story and its elements harken back a little more to its comic book origins,and along with the Rider's epic battles and off-kilter attitude it also has a nice sense of humour about itself. 4-4 1/2 stars. On fire and recommended!!",1348272000,,4734,4.718599033816425

4724724,1,B005LAIGW8,"The first Ghost Rider was a classic B movie. This was is so bad it's not even close to being in that ""so bad, it's good."" Forget figuring out why anything is the way it is like why is the Highlander (Christopher Lambert) a monk with scriptures tattooed in what looks like Latin all over his face? Or why Stringer Bell from ""The Wire"" is suddenly the Ghost Rider's best buddy or how he survived getting killed in the first ten minutes? Was it just me or when his motorcycle flew off that mountain curve, wasn't he a goner?

The most laughable thing is the movie starts out with ""Eastern Europe"" showing up on the screen like the movie exists in the vastness of the entire eastern half of Europe. I guess they were trying to snag that lucrative ex-Communist bloc market and not offend any one country for this mess. The worse thing about all this is how boring the movie was.

Throw in the lead actress is no Eva Mendes and looks more at home at a goth concert, and GR2 lost me.

The extras are, well, there are none on the DVD release of this. Maybe with the Blu-Ray edition you'll get an explanation of how the Ghost Rider ended up in ""Eastern Europe"" as the onscreen animated segment only showed me a motorcycle ""driving"" across the Atlantic Ocean.",1347753600,,1249,4.375

It just wasn't entertaining for some reason. the kid ( The Devils son) was not a cute sympathetic character you could warm up to, he was a cold little emotionless boy. Johnny Blaze did not appear as the rider nearly enough, and the film as a whole just didn't draw you in. Cage did a good job as usual, but the story just lacked something. It felt more like a sy fy channel movie than a theatrical big movie. And when the devil is plaaning the big end of the world body changing ceremony, he only had like three guys standing gaurd with guns! HE'S the DEVIL!! Wal Mart has better security than that??!!

4724972,1,B005LAIGW8,"But even if Mike Nelson & Co. never get together to tear this movie apart, it's still watchable in a so-bad-it's-good way.

Everyone knows Nicholas Cage will take any project that comes his way, but this one was particularly ill-conceived. There is, in fact, no story to be found in this movie. Oh, there's a vague outline for a terrible story here, and that's what they used as a shooting script. See, the Devil has a son with a Gypsy woman (or something), and he wants to take over the kid's body because his current body is only human and dying, but the kid's body is half-devil and immortal, I guess. There's a mobster guy who looks like a 24-year-old Jim Carrey (with a slightly better haircut) who is tasked with retrieving the kid for Satan. And Ghost Rider is there for some reason, and an African guy who, I think, used to have devil powers, but prayed them away, maybe (I guess that's supposed to be some kind of cultural commentary). And the mobster turns into Edgar Winters at one point, and gains the power to make things moldy. No, really. He takes a sandwich out of a lunchbox as he drives and makes it moldy. Also, he kills the African guy by making him moldy.

Nicholas Cage looks about 20 years older in this movie than he did in the original Ghost Rider. He also has begun to look like k.d. lang with a receding hairline, which is weird.

Now that I think about it, Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance has no Vengeance in it. It's wholly lacking in any kind of Vengeance, even the Spirit of it. It does feature some extremely jerky camera work, though, and bizarre visual asides. The CGI is singularly lacking, and seeing the terrible special effects it becomes obvious that most of the film's $57 million budget went towards Cage's salary and Botox injections. We do get to witness a scene that goes on for like, five minutes, in which we watch Nick ride his motorcycle and have some kind of spazz-attack while his face repeatedly changes into a semi-skull and back, which is somehow less dramatic than you'd think.

Also, apparently, the Ghost Rider pees fire. No, really. I'm serious! They show it like, three times. I couldn't say why. You'll just have to watch it if you don't believe me.

The best scene is one in which Nicholas Cage has lost his powers to Ghost-Ride because he prayed, or something, and Satan is about to kill him, but then the kid (who doesn't want to be possessed by his devil-dad, I guess) vomits fire on Johnny Blaze's face, which makes him able to Ghost-Ride again, only now his head-fire is blue instead of orange. So, there's that.

The best thing I can say about this movie is that I made it all the way through, which I can't say for The Green Hornet. Anyway, if you do decide to watch this, it'll go a lot easier if you take a shot of tequila every time Cage looks mournful and regrets his Ghost-Riding.

4725092,3,B005LAIGW8,"I get a kick out of the editorial review for this flick - ""(it) is unable to thread its diverse elements, which include ... assorted exorcisms, rituals, and come-and-go powers, into a cohesive and believable film.""  A believable film about a guy with his head on fire.  Somehow, I don't think believable is what we should be looking for.

Coherency would be admirable, and, unlike some other reviewers, I thought this installment of Ghost Rider made perfect sense within the logic of its own universe.  Cage as Blaze is enlisted to help protect the Devil's son, whom old Scratch needs as a new vessel for his powers; and the only ones that seem capable of stopping the transfer is an assembly of coven-like monks led by Christopher Lambert (Ha!) - but they need the help of the Ghost Rider to do it.  In exchange for his help, they'll exorcize the Ghost Rider demon for him, once the Devil gets his due.  As one might guess from thousands of other movies, that deal is probably not going to work out, and in the end, Blaze is forced to re-rent the spare room in his head to the demon in order to save the day.

I get it.  In fact, I saw most of it coming once the parameters of the movie were established at about the thirty minute mark.  But there's a sort of manic energy about the whole thing that made it fairly entertaining.  That, and the fact that the film got such poor reviews that my expectations were flatlined.  Reading other reviews, it seems that either people don't like that this (sort of) sequel departs from the tone of the first, or that it doesn't conform to their idea of the source material, or that there's a kind of 'piling on' now that it seems safe to pan the flick.  I think the second reason is the only one that might hold water - if you've been following this character for years, I think you have a right to expect certain things.  You're the reason the franchise ever got off the ground in the first place.

I never really got into the whole Blaze character before, and thought that the first flick really dumbed down a bare-bones (ha again!) concept in the first place.  This one goes darker, albeit at the expense of much character development.  I like the drunken priest Moreau (Idris Elba, also known as Heimdall in the Thor franchise) best here - everyone else is pretty much cardboard.  So, thread-bare characters, threadbare plot, lots of crazy energy.  Pretty much like any other empty-headed action flick.  Great for a Sunday afternoon rental.",1345420800,,2484,4.5415730337078655

4725096,1,B005LAIGW8,"This movie takes the crown of Worst Superhero Movie Ever Made from Catwoman.  I cannot understand what they were thinking when they allowed this ""film"" to be released into theaters.  It should have been shelved right next to the 1990's Fantastic Four movie, so Marvel could pretend it never happened.  It is so bad that the Sci-Fi Channel would have been embarrassed to release it as a made for TV movie.  It's not even worth a $1 rental from Redbox.

I can find positive things to say about other lackluster superhero movies like Dare Devil, Electra, Batman Forever, Batman & Robin, Superman Returns, Green Lantern, X-men 3, Fantastic Four 1 & 2, and Ghost Rider 1.  There is something to like about all of those movies.  I really want to say something nice about this movie, but I can't.  I can't even say that it is one of those movies that is so bad it is good.  It's not even a train-wreck spectacle that you should see to believe.  It truly is that awful.

This movie is an incredible disappointment and makes me ashamed of being a fan of the Ghost Rider comic books.  It has no redeeming moments.  You might like this film if you enjoy movies with ill-conceived plots, horrible acting, and mediocre CG.

UPDATE: January 14, 2014 - I've spent some more time with this movie, having watched it 7-8 times, now.  I've got some advice to improve your viewing experience.

Most importantly, I recommend that you watch this on DVD instead of Blu-ray.  The lower quality actually makes the CG look much better, whereas the hi-def exposes every flaw.  I cannot stress this enough.

Secondly, The movie is slightly better when you sit down to watch it with super-low expectations.  While it is well deserving of the 1-star rating, it helps to just accept some of the poor decisions they made for this script; such as putting Ghost Rider in Europe and casting Nicholas Cage as Johnny Blaze.  I now see what they were trying to do with Ghost Rider's history, but they failed.  A lot of the changes still don't make sense with what you know and love about Ghost Rider, but if you can deal with it and enjoy the eye-candy, then you might actually be able to sit through the entire thing.",1344988800,3,2180,4.5501285347043705

The most under-rated performance in the movie is Johnny Whitworth.  Perhaps best known for Empire Records, he plays against type as one of the villains, Ray Carrigan, and he is amazing.  He makes decisions with the role that makes him scarier than he is written.  There is a casual evil to his performance that was wildly successful.

Heck, even though I've never seen it, I'd bet the ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Man-Thing/dp/B0009A409S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Man-Thing</a>"" movie probably wasn't even this bad. (That's one of my all-time favorite Marvel characters and it's killing me not to watch the movie, but I've just heard so many bad things that I can't bring myself to see it. But if anyone ever threatens to make me watch ""Ghost Rider 2"" again, I'll probably ask for ""Man-Thing"" as a reprieve.) I'd almost be willing to watch the Steve Martin/Laura Dern fiasco ""Novacaine"" again before I'd watch this piece of garbage. (Ouch, it hurt just to say that. I still can't see how Martin and Dern ever agreed to make that piece of... <shudder>. Have to go find my happy place now.)",1343260800,5,1983,5.473856209150327
4725280,1,B005LAIGW8,"I wasn't a big fan of the 1st one but this one doesn't even measure up to that low standard.  It's probably one of the worst comic book movies made since CGI made them laughable & many of those were probably better.  I'd rewatch Catwoman over this easily.

Spider-man & the most recent Hulk movie are good examples where focusing on the human character as much or more than the heroic persona can really work.  This is the exact opposite.  It spend way too much time telling a bad story with Johnny Blaze.  This movie may've been better with more actual Ghost Rider clips but I'm not even sure about that as those weren't even that entertaining.

I usually don't give out 1 star reviews but this isn't even worth a rental IMO.  I'm sorry I bought it except then I'd still be anticipating it.  At least now I know.

4725452,3,B005LAIGW8,"This movie was pretty enjoyable, so don't get me wrong when I mark this at only 3 stars...it isn't because the movie wasn't entertaining.  The reason I gave this only 3 stars was for a few simple reasons:  Firstly, the special effects in this movie, particularly during bits of the ghostrider scenes, were a little hokey...I think they could have used a little more work.  Secondly, although the motorcycle in this 2nd movie is probably more accurate to the comics, I don't think they should have changed it up.  Sure, the motorcycle in the first movie was a made up creation that didn't quite resemble the motorcycle from the comics...but it was bad@$$, and when something's brought to the movies they change things all the time anyway, and often they're pretty cool changes, though sometimes not...but that motorcycle in the first movie was awesome!  Thirdly, I hate to say it, I think a lot of the acting was lacking a bit, even on Sir Nicolas Cage's part.  Don't get me wrong, he did ok through a lot of the movie, but as much as I love the actor, there were parts of the movie that his acting was not that great, and some of the supporting cast's acting was only ""okay"" at best.  However, I would have to say that the awesome Idris Elba's performance was sensational...probably the best in the whole movie.  I expected that though, because he's awesome in Prometheus, Takers, and The Losers.  All that being said, the movie was still enjoyable, and I'd probably eventually buy the movie at a used price...but it wasn't quite as good as it could have been.  With the technology they have now a days, you would think they could have done this a little more justice, but oh well.  It's still worth at least a watch.",1342224000,,1717,4.578431372549019

4725514,2,B005LAIGW8,"The movie I am now reviewing is called, ""Ghost Rider 2: Spirit of Vengeance,"" and its starring Nicolas Cage, Johnny Whitworth (played in ""Limitless""), and Idris Elba. This movie came out on February 17, 2012. I actually got the chance to watch this movie in the movie theater. Honestly, I thought the first Ghost Rider movie wasn't bad. Even though a lot of people I talked to really didn't like it. When I saw the previews for this film (Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance). I was thinking to myself, ""I have to see this."" I thought the first one wasn't bad and it looked like the second coming of the Ghost Rider series was going to be even better.

This movie is about a dare devil named Johnny Blaze. Johnny Blaze has made a deal with the Devil, and he is trying to figure out how he can save humanity from the Devil and not kill everyone in the process as he does it.

To break this movie down and come up with a couple sentences or a paragraph to describe it was way more difficult for me then it was suppose to be. This movie is a mess! There were just too many things going on that had me confused. I, to a strong degree, almost didn't understand the plot to the movie. Granted I wasn't a big fan of Ghost Rider comics, there may be something's that I need to understand about the Ghost Rider. I don't think all the understanding in the world could have this film. There isn't a ""we are the world"" song we could sing to save this film. This could have been a movie that could have had a basic plot and my have been successful. This movie needed more action! People want to see what the Ghost Rider can do. There were very little action scenes and the one that they gave us wasn't really that great. There's moments in this movie were I'm still trying to figure out what is going on. Then they threw a kid in the mix. Not a good idea to me. Unfortunately, what ended up happening (that I saw coming) was the kid was getting to much attention in the movie. I think I could have come up with a plot better than this and I didn't even read Ghost Rider comics as a kid. It simply sucked and it even sucks more that Nicolas Cage had to be apart of this awfulness.

Some things that I did like about the movie (besides the previews) were there were some cool scenes in the movie. Seeing Ghost rider on fire and a chain rapidly coming out of his mouth was awesome. There was one scene in the movie that I liked and thought was funny. It was the scene when Johnny Blaze was trying to get some guy in the hospital to corporate. Being though he was Johnny Blaze just started going crazy and transforming back and forth between Ghost Rider and himself. I also thought some of the camera views were nice. You could tell the director put a lot of work into that.

My final rating for this movie is going to be a 4 out of 10. This is an extremely low rating for me. Its very rare I rate movies this low. That should tell you something right there. Don't see this movie on anything. If your super curious or a big Ghost Rider fan than you have my blessing to catch this on Netflix, or borrow it from one of your friends.

4725520,3,B005LAIGW8,"Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.

This was another film I missed when it was in theaters, but in a way I'm kind of glad. I didn't know it was from the creators of ""Crank"" until I saw it on the cover. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed Crank in all its awkwardness, but that style of film doesn't work well with Ghost Rider. It literally felt like Ghost Rider and Crank had sex and this is what they gave birth to, it's really weird.

""Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance"" is the sequel to 2007's ""Ghost Rider"" It starts off with a little comic animation briefly going over the history of Ghost Rider which is good for those who may have missed the first film. I thought that was kind of cool. First thing I noticed once the film started was the lack of Eva Mendes. So from the get-go I was already a little disappointed. As the film progresses not only is there a lack of Ms. Mendes, but it falls victim to a pretty bad story and some awful acting. I felt Nicholas Cage did a pretty good job in the original film, but here he just seems really bad. He looks weird, and his acting is very poor.

I also noticed that they used a different person to play the Devil, but they kind of explain this further in the story. That the devil can take the body of any individual he pleases. I personally felt Peter Fonda did a better job in the original, but nothing you can do about that now. The story is basically about the devil trying to transfer his essence into the body of this little boy, his spawn, Danny. Johnny Blaze (Cage) makes it his duty to make sure this doesn't happen.

Visually the actual Ghost Rider looks phenomenal and is a big improvement from the original, but the style of filming that was present in the Crank films, is present in here. It's very odd and consists a lot of slow motion, and sped up sequences. It's honestly something that's hard to explain in text.

Overall Score: 5/10 - Honestly if you're looking for a good action film then I suggest you give this a try, but if you're looking for a film with a good story, good acting, and good filming then I recommend you skip this. As I said the Ghost Rider looks amazing, but the story is really bad, and unfortunately is paired with some terrible acting. Had they gotten the original writers from the first film, and used the Ghost Rider in this film the end result would've been a much better experience.",1341273600,2,2385,4.314732142857143

Special Effects were great, I liked the actors and the acting and it didn't have a drawn-out feeling like some other super-hero flicks (Such as the Hollywood, butt-kissing recent Batman movies).

4725575,1,B005LAIGW8,"I first want to say that when I saw the trailer for the Ghost Rider, I had no idea it was a comic book series. I'm not into comic books by any means, but I do love Marvel and DC movies. For the most part, they're well produced and packed with action. The greatest comic based movies are the ones in which the main character first discovers or receives his or her powers (Ghost Rider, Iron Man, etc). I love the often comedic, awkward transition from regular, every day person to super human.

I'm a huge fan of heavy metal music, and you'll usually find me adorned with skulls in one way or another, and I have a motorcycle, so naturally, I was pumped to see a movie about a flaming skeleton who rode a sick, flaming motorcycle, and hunted demons. The first Ghost Rider movie grossly exceeded my expectations. I loved every minute of it, and I've nearly worn out my blu-ray copy of it. I didn't get a chance to see Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance in theaters, but when it came out on blu-ray, I bought a copy believing that it would be just as enjoyable, for me, as the first one was. Only a few minutes in, I knew it was going to be horrible, and after suffering through the entire movie I felt compelled to read some reviews to see what other people thought.

Apparently Ghost Rider was a comic book series from the 70's (I was born in 1985), and Spirit of Vengeance closely followed the story line presented in those comics, so the people who are really into those comic books hated Ghost Rider and loved Spirit of Vengeance. As I mentioned before, I wasn't aware it was a comic book series, so whether or not the movie followed that series was of no matter to me.

Right off the bat, Spirit of Vengeance brings it's viewers up to speed on the Ghost Rider story in a wannabe-Tarantino style, but instead of using cut scenes from the first movie, they reenacted scenes from Ghost Rider using different actors, in different situations. As I watched I found myself saying, ""Wait, that's not how it happend..."" The movie goes through a few major plot points of Ghost Rider, then tells another story of how he changed how he felt about being the Ghost Rider, then tells the story about how he ""fled to Europe,"" all in the opening two minutes. As the movie begins, we find a completely changed Ghost Rider character, with a different bike, a different outfit (what happened to the ""nice jacket?""), in a different country, and with a different outlook on life. And when Nicholas Cage changes into the Ghost Rider, the skull is different, the flames are different, the bike doesn't change much (except for some flames coming out of it in a few places), and he's basically wearing charred, black leather pants and a charred, black leather jacket. Already, the awesomeness of the character has been reduced to nothing special. And now, anything he rides changes into a ""Ghost vehicle"" that he can wield however he pleases.

These are all minor points, nit picking I suppose, but overall the movie was just horrible. The acting was terrible, the plot was ridiculous, the characters were never properly introduced, I could go on and on. It may sound like no big deal when I say the Ghost Rider's appearance was different, but imagine if you watched Iron Man, as it is, then watched Iron Man 2 to find that Robert Downy Jr. wore a green suit and never mentioned any sort of reason for the change. After reading the reviews of this movie, I can say one thing for sure. If you loved the comic book series, and hated Ghost Rider for being so apart from the comics, you'll probably like this movie. If you loved Ghost Rider, however, I can almost guarantee you'll hate Spirit of Vengeance. It's not Ghost Rider 2 by any means. It's someone else's idea of how the Ghost Rider comic book series should've been portrayed in a movie.",1341100800,8,3816,4.5021645021645025

The main point to this is really cool eye candy and wild special effects. This is delivered, but unfortunately the benefits are drowned out in the mess that made up the editing.
The premise was clever, and they made the Ghost Rider a darker figure than before. This built expectation as the film progressed but it failed to deliver.
The build up to the reveal was too long. Even if you feel you take take anticipaton the prolonged event of transformation went on far too long and began to deflate the tension they were hoping to build. The scene of Nicolas Cage combating his terror of what he is while mounted on the bike riding off out of control as well went on far to long. They established what was happening, we get it, yet it continues, and continues, and continues. It nearly becomes an insult.
As mentioned in other reviews, the animation sequence seemed to be taken straight out of Harry Potter. I initially thought, ""So what, maybe they just like the way it looked"". The problem was that it was placed disjointedly, feeling as if it really didn't belong and one of the many producers insisted that they needed something like that and the director put it in just to shut him up.
If you are going to watch this, rent it. If you're going to purchase it wait until it hits the eight to nine dollar range. Any more cash will spell regret.",1340668800,,1462,4.438661710037175

Just a whole bunch of really stupid scenes poorly shot and edited.  Overall, the acting was poor, the writing was poor, and the cinematic direction was crappy.

4725639,1,B005LAIGW8,"The film opens by showing you some unfamiliar people in an unfamiliar place. It continues to do so throughout the entire length. It gives you flashbacks to a film that never existed and pretends that the first Ghost Rider is entirely different, or was just never made. Hence it being a ""pseudo-sequel"". It tries to recap a back-story that nobody is familiar with.

Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance continues to add new characters and plot-lines while not giving you time to really care about any of it. It goes from plot to plot too rapidly to allow for time to make  sense of the story, not that it would be all that easy to do so with loads more time. It seems to care too much about the action to even try to build up any kind of depth to the characters, leaving them all very dull and lifeless. The directors of the film, Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor, seemed to throw all cares away and aim this film at a non-existent audience of mindless zombies who want nothing but mediocre action and second-rate 3D. They seem to think that audiences have forgotten that true cinema is made up of deep, coherent stories and characters.

Many people, such as myself, went to see this film because of the entertainment that the first film brought. Many expected a sequel of some sort. We expected the film to continue the story of Johnny Blaze (Cage) and his quest to use the rider for the good of mankind. Instead we got a story about a man hiding out in Eastern Europe, feasting on the evil deeds of people, and trying not to go insane. While people wanted something that was even slightly reminiscent of the first film, they got a reboot that just used the same lead actor and confused the masses.",1340496000,4,1693,4.472491909385114

4725641,1,B005LAIGW8,"I won't waste your time comparing this travesty to the even worse previous film. I'm just going to jump right into why this film isn't worth your time. Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance is a total mess. The story is paper thin and poorly told. You won't know whats going on until well after the first hour, and even then whats happening isn't very interesting. Nicholas Cage is given a lot of crap for this performance and, while he is moderately terrible, it isn't entirely his fault. This movies dialogue is atrocious, sounding stiff and unnatural the entire way through. No one is given anything remotely interesting to say, so why is there so much talking?

If all that wasn't bad enough the one reason anyone might want to see this film, the Rider itself, is terribly mishandled. Though the directors were clearly going for a darker, more brutal Rider, this one just comes off as spastic and goofy. Cheesy camera tricks, and the Riders laughable roaring kill any chance of the character actually being threatening. while the effects for the rider are greatly improved over the previous film, all it does is turn people to ash. While that may sound cool, it happens so quickly it loses any impact it might have had otherwise.

Now for the few good parts: The fantastic Idris Elba is the only likeable character in the film, but unfortunately is not given nearly enough screen time. The main antagonist, not Roark but Carrigan, early on was very impressive as a villain. In the previous film, the antagonists were pasty emo nothings that put me to sleep, so I was very impressed to see the film give a plain old vanilla mortal the chance to show that he could take on the rider; and then half way through he is transformed into a pasty, emo villain.

Nothing about this film works. The action is clunky and unsatisfying. The story is pitifully anemic and goes nowhere. Nick Cage hams it up for all he's worth, killing any chance at a mood, and the Rider is a twitchy, boring mess. Unless you are a die hard Ghost Rider fan, stay far away from this film. If you are a die hard Ghost Rider film, just read the comic, and stay far away from this film. Do not buy.",1340409600,3,2162,4.524296675191816

I do admit that Nicholas Cage is not my favorite, but he pulled it off in this one. Having said, there was one scene that displayed his overacting neurotic moniker.

The acting was forced and fake, the cinematography was tactless and unartful, the computer generation was poor, disgraceful, and cheap.  The sound quality (I have an astounding state-of-the-art professional home theater) was inconsistent and frustrating to amend (which was impossible).  As an audiophile I was disgusted with the sound.

The PLOT!  The plot was atrocious!  Predictable - and UNIMAGINATIVE.  I've watched predicable movies before (and been tickled by their quirky nuances).  At least the predictable movies had a decent plot.

Plot improvements could have been made if scenes and explanations were coordinated, made sense, and helped the viewers to sympathize and give a crap about the protagonists and situations.  There was an extreme focus on action without plausible build up or resolution.

A fan of hero movies, I wanted to enjoy this Ghost Rider flick.  Normally my expectations of hero/action movies are low and I find many movies a delight, some which don't always receive the highest reviews.  Even to my standards, I consider this very, very poor.  I rate even Ninja Assassins far above this movie.

This is not a movie I would describe as ""good."" It's more along the ""okay"" range. I rented it when I was home and wanted only to watch a movie and surf the web. So I got Ghost Rider II and did just that. The acting is generally decent, although Cage is probably the worst in this film - as far as acting goes. But it's based off of a comic book (and a marginally popular character, at that), so my expectations aren't really high. This movie is a decent watch, so long as you keep your perspective. It's got fire, action, fighting, and a steady pace. Is the story line well thought-out? Nope. I agree with another reviewer who said this is Marvel's worst movie product so far; they could've done better. But still, it's not a waste of time either. I'm not someone who'll continue watching a bad movie. I just turn them off and would rather waste the rental money than continue to waste time after having already wasted the money. This movie, I watched until the end. I actually didn't rent this particular movie from Amazon, so I'm on the fence about whether it's worth 4 dollars. Maybe if you just had the urge to see it and it was last on your list of rentals - then it'd be worth $4. Otherwise, check out John Carter or Sherlock Holmes or Safe House.

4725839,3,B005LAIGW8,"This is an OK movie as the sequel to the first Ghost Rider movie.  It is more in the line of following the original comic book series and it is easy to see how tortured Johnny Blaze (Nicholas Cage) is trying to keep the demon inside under control. He is dragged into a conflict when the devil tries to have a son on earth to become a new vessel for all of his power.  The young boy is being guarded by monks and Moreau (Idris Elba) to keep the devil from fulfilling an ancient prophecy.

The devil's minions strike at the monastery to kidnap the boy but he is saved by Moreau and the boy escapes with his mother.  Moreau recruits Johnny Blaze to help save the boy with the promise of removing the devil's curse on Johnny that makes him the devil's bounty hunter for evil souls...

There are some good chase scenes in the movie and the special effects are not bad.  The acting was where this movie was weak for me and Nicholas Cage just seemed to do everything over the top of what was necessary. He is an enigma to me in that some of his movies are really good and others I just wonder how he became a lead actor.

The sad part of this movie was that the script had real potential and it would have been easy for the young boy, Danny (Fergus Riodan) to be set up as the Ghost Rider's replacement or a formidable enemy for a revitalization of the series with new blood.  Nicholas is not getting any younger and his acting in this movie is one of the things that brought it down to a lower rating.  Perhaps it was the Director's fault for the over acting.

4725840,3,B005LAIGW8,"This sequel opens cold with several different groups trying to gain or retain custody of a special child. Why is he special? I don't think I'm spoiling it for you to state that he's the devil's child. Watch for Anthony Stuart Head in a cameo as one of the monks guarding the child. One of the factions, represented by Idris Elba as a renegade priest, decides that the best way to track and protect the child is to bring the Ghost Rider in on the scene. He finds Johnny Blaze in a depression spiral, and disappointingly there is no explanation provided as to how he wound up separated from his compadres in the first movie. Moreau (Elba) convinces Johnny to find and protect the child, both for the child's sake and his own - he promises Johnny that he knows how to remove the curse of the Ghost Rider for good. The rest of the flick is a series of chase scenes, battle scenes, back stabbing and bonding interludes. Cage hams it up, clearly having some fun with the B movie tropes and some of the more overwrought dialogue. Elba is excellent and gets plenty of screen time, and Johnny Whitworth provides plenty of comic relief and not a little menace as the secondary antagonist. Ciaran Hinds is woefully underused as the main antagonist. I understand you don't want to pull out that big gun until you're darn good and ready, but he really needed more to do. Violante Placido and Fergus Riordan are fine as the mother and child at the center of the action. There are a lot of amusing visual touches that remind the viewer that this movie is based on a comic book, and there's a bit of a revelation as to exactly what the Ghost Rider really is. The story does not have nearly as much pathos as the first movie, but it's an entertaining time waster.",1339977600,,1746,4.425465838509317
4725971,2,B005LAIGW8,"I was a fan of the first GHOST RIDER film that starred Nicholas Cage as the motorcycle rider who sold his soul based on the Marvel comic character. Not many were fans of the film and were disappointed in the direction the film chose to follow. But then fans of an original piece of fiction seeing it come to life on the big screen rarely find it satisfying. Never having been a major fan of the comic, I found the movie well made and entertaining. I can't say the same for GHOST RIDER: SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE.

Johnny Blaze (Cage) is still possessed as the devil's spirit of vengeance, a wraith like character that searches the globe to collect the souls owed to the demon. Looking for a way to void the contract he signed when he was young, a contract that tricked him as the devil is won't to do, Blaze is told of an opportunity to break free.

Approached by a monk named Moreau (Idris Elba), he's told there is a young boy who needs his help. For his protection Moreau agrees to assist Blaze find release from his contract and the chance to be completely human once more. Of course he takes the offer.

The story follows the two trying to protect the boy along with his mother. Along the way we get bits and pieces of just who the boy is and why he needs protecting. Comic fans will know right away that this character is important to the Ghost Rider mythology. The boy's name is Danny Ketch and in the comics he too became the Ghost Rider. But none of that comes up in this film, just that he is the offspring of someone completely evil who has come to collect before his next birthday.

So what's good about this movie? Some of the special effects are good while others are lackluster. The story seems weak. The worst of it all is twofold. First there is Cage's acting. I like Cage. I've enjoyed many of the movies that critics have hated. But here he overacts to such an extreme that it's noticeable. It's as if he showed up and staggered through the role just to get a paycheck. Watching this made me realize just how bad he could have been had they chosen him to play Superman like they considered some years ago.

The second worst thing is the direction. A director should be able to coax a decent performance from each and every actor in a film. Here the acting is negligible. But worse than that are the attempts to show action that don't work in the least. I'm not a fan of the whole hand held camera that gets tossed around technique. It's used to extremes here. A word to all directors and cinematographers: if you just make a camera jump around and look sloppy it doesn't make a scene look like its action packed. It just makes it look like you can't hold a camera steady. Stop doing it. We paid money to watch a movie and would enjoy being able to tell what we are looking at rather than some stupid attempt to look artsy.

There is no way I can recommend this movie, even for Cage or Marvel Comic fans. The best moment in the movie revolves around a rather tasteless joke that is still funny.

I didn't like it at all.",1339977600,6,297,4.673076923076923
4725973,4,B005LAIGW8,"I don't know where I read it but I'll agree with whomever said it that Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance is to Ghost Rider as The Punisher: War Zone was to The Punisher..a better take, overall, on the comic book character but in movie form. Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance begins when a monk, Moreau, alerts Blaze that a woman named Nadya & her son need protection from the very devil that created the Ghost Rider. Blaze feels obligated to help and that's where our new adventure begins.

Most of you will notice that this film bears very little resemblence to the previous Ghost Rider film that came out in 2007, although Nic Cage reprises his role as Johnny Blaze/Ghost Rider. I hate to admit it but it took a couple of viewings to agree that this is a better film than the first. It's better in the fact that the action is more frantic and intense than the first. My only gripe would have to be that Nic Cage's performance is predictable in this movie. It seemed like he dialed this one in, instead of really giving a Grade-A performance. It was nice seeing Christopher Lambert on screen again. The last time I seen him was in Mortal Kombat, I'm afraid.

Despite negative reactions to the movie, I thought it was pretty decent movie. If it were given a bigger budget, I'm sure we would have seen a more robust movie by  Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor(whom most of you know as the directors of Crank). As it is, though, I loved it. I hope this isn't the last we see of ol' Ghost Rider. He's one of my all-time favorite Marvel characters that's deserving of some screen time.",1339977600,,1577,4.431034482758621
4725974,5,B005LAIGW8,"Overall a fun comic book movie, though quite different from the first Ghost Rider movie.

Nicolas Cage reprises his role as Johnny Blaze, a stunt bike rider who made a deal with the devil to save his father.  As expected, the deal did not go as planned, and Johnny is cursed to walk the Earth possessed with a violent and powerful spirit who exacts vengeance upon evil-doers.

While attempting to escape his curse, Blaze encounters a powerful child, the spawn of the devil, who's mother also made a poor choice in contracting with the devil.  Blaze discovers that if he protects the child from the devil that he can be released from his own curse as well.

The film is filled with tons of stunts and comic book action.  It was fun to watch, though I figure it is easier to understand if you had watched the first film.  Like many superhero-type films, you will be disappointed if you expect much more than a popcorn-munching good time.

This movie is in effect a remake of the 1st movie in that the ""deal"" is explained and Johnny Blazes' past as well, to a degree.  To compare these two movies would be like comparing Christopher Nolan's 1st Batman with any of the previous Batman movies, (save for Tim Burton's 1st one).
They are not sequels so the comparison is mute.
This one is darker, but not as dark as it could have been due to the PG13 rating, although the directors get a shot in about the ratings in the ""Extras"" section. (""Movies with ""R"" ratings don't make money!  Although ""The Hangover"" made more than a 100 million""(?).)
I enjoyed the movie, have watched it more than three times and since I'm on disability I can watch movies all day.
I wished they'd kept the original ""Chopper"" but that's OK too.  The bike in this movie is equally gnarly.
The important thing to remember is this is NOT a sequel, but a re-telling of the original story. The directors could have reduced the ""crank-ness"" in some of the shots, but it seems to be they're thing.

I was one of the few people that actually liked the first Ghost Rider film. While it was no work of art, I thought it captured the look and the feel of the character pretty well. This latest effort really has no soul, its all over the place. I like Nic Cage as an actor, but I really wished he had stepped aside and let someone else take the role. Ghost Rider is one of the most powerful and feared heroes in the Marvel universe but in this film he is depicted as a twitching skull-faced clown. The first film was a hell of a lot better.

Do you like the Carpenters listening, jelly bean popping, simple, silly Johnny Blaze? Did you really like GR 1? (This does not match the comic version of Ghost Rider). You will not like (probably) GR 2.

Do you like the hard, gritty, tortured Ghost Rider from the comics? Then GR 2 is for you!

I hated Johnny Blaze in the first movie because he did not match the comic at all. GR 2 is a reboot, to a more comic book like, Johnny Blaze, and I was excited to see the real Ghost Rider come out. Now, if only Marvel had the stones to make a R rated GR...maybe for 3? The Marvel Knights series is a mature comic line and it just can't be done right at PG-13. I do think, however, that the time has come, and the audience exsists, for the gritty R rated comic book movie. Here's hoping!

I do have to add that they should pick a new Ghost Rider for their re-boot. Nick Cage is eyeball rolling cliche and quite ridiculous. If it were any actor other than he who performed like he does in GR2 he would have been called an amateur. They found the perfect Hulk for the Avengers after 3 tries, maybe they can find the right Johnny Blaze.",1339891200,,1141,4.172727272727273

The soul stare is not as cool as the first and when he does it, it takes forever!!! I guess he has better control of his power now becuase he can be the rider in direct sunlight. Nicolas Cage is such a bad actor. Yes he has some high making movies but all those movies make him...not the other way around. Still the same charater as all his other movies....to bad he can't come up with something new like Blue Steal! lol The only redeming quality to this movie is he can transform whatever he's driving into a flame vehicle...including giant trench diggers! which was pretty cool. The movie wasn't even funny...didn't even have any cheesy 1 liners(maybe 1)! The rider kills the bad guy Ray but the devil brings him back to life and gives him the power of decay. Now everything he touchs decayes, except a twinkie which has probably been done in 1000 movies. The fight scenes the characters are transported back and forth between what seems to be like a 12th dimension. This to me was just stupid!

I love the Rider but as with any book, comic, whatever...I don't care if it stays 100% true to those as long as it is good, has good acting, fun to see, or has a decent plot....This movie has none of that!

Everything else:  the script/story, direction and acting were all horrible. The shaky-cam/hand-held stuff simply does not work and belong in a movie like this.

He was pretty nutty in this film, I could tell he was having a good time with it. Script was okay, musical score was neat, CGI was pretty good to excellent, but I will never understand why movies have to be so loud during action scenes, and quite during dialog.
Could have done without the comic book/Cage voice overs, but that just added to the campy atmosphere of the movie for me. Good actors without over acting. Of course there is never enough of the female skin for this sexist pig. Could have used just one shot of the leading lady in a wet t-shirt or coming out of a shower.

4726200,1,B005LAIGW8,"The first ""Ghost Rider"" movie for all of its flaws was still cheesy fun. This ""reboot"" (it's a reboot according to the directors not a sequel although if you've got the same actor playing the same role I'm a bit perplexed as to how it could be a reboot)""Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance"" does have some moments of cheesy fun but it's mostly joyless compared to the first movie which at least had fun with the character (or at least more fun than what we see here).

Johnny Blaze (Cage) gets roped into protecting the child of Satan with the promise that he will be cured of his afflication kissing the Ghost Rider goodbye. Predictably he finds that he needs the Ghost Rider just when he wants to get rid of him.

""Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance"" isn't the worst movie ever made but, like the ""Crank"" movies that these directors made, it isn't exactly a good movie or even decent. It IS fun seeing Nic Cage chew the scenery although it's almost to the point of badly overacting pushing the boundary even of the first film where he appears almost restrained by comparison.

Some sequences take place (particularly the climax) during daytime and the Rider's only supposed to appear in darkness--I believe it's supposed to be dawn but it looks closer to late afternoon to me.

Cage is matched for bad acting here by Ciran Hinds who is, well, just BAD. There's a lack of fun in his performance although it's clear he was trying to go for the cheesy over-the-top approach that Cage used, his role isn't quite as showy and he isn't given as much to work with which makes his portrayal as Satan  flatter by comparison.

The Blu-ray looks quite nice--nice detail, sharp looking and the film which was shot digitally with a Red camera (I suppose you could call it beta testing since the camera hadn't even been released yet) gives the directors a bit more flexibility in shooting the movie. According to the featurette it allowed them to use traditional 35mm lens which probably complimented the look of the film.

Audio is immersive and dialog is clear throughout. Subtitles are in English and Spanish and, like other Sony releases, the subtitles are placed on screen under the character saying the dialog which helps for those who are hard of hearing in keeping track of who is saying what.

The special features include featurettes on the decision to reboot--the departure point was a David Goyer script that was written BEFORE the first ""Ghost Rider"" film. The directors liked the elements and it was rewritten by Goyer with a pair of writers that worked on ""Flash Forward"" the TV show. We also learn WHY the film was shot in Eastern Europe and the challenges (including the destruction of an abandoned factory that they were going to shoot at but were assured would still be there when they returned)of shooting on location including the disconnect between local government and their liaison). We also get behind-the-scenes footage that's quite interesting documenting the issues they faced (including shooting on a bridge that was supposed to be blocked off for a stunt but had heavy traffic during the entire shoot).

We also get some deleted and extended scenes that wouldn't have added all that much to the movie but are interesting to see.

""Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance"" surely was one of the worst popcorn movies of this year. The film lacks the cheesy over-the-top badness of the first movie and the smaller production suffers by comparison compared to the firsts film (which was epic by comparison). The redesign of the Ghost Rider is interesting and this film is certainly darker than the first it just isn't as much fun.",1339804800,16,3632,4.750793650793651

Literally one of the worst things I've watched. Not even entertaining enough to elicit a mystery science theater response. The plot is confusing and the plot holes are about as massive as Nic's acting presence. I had a hard time following any of it. The effects weren't awful in some respects, but most of them were weirdly pointless and nausea inducing. The characters beyond Nic Cage were just awful, with some in particular acting as if they were trying to compete with Nic's hammy acting and they failed miserably. Look, I liked the first one, I'm one of the few who did. The plot was coherent, the actors were decent, and Nic's crazy persona was at the perfect level to fit the role. So it had its redeeming qualities. This film has none, even if you are a fan of Nic Cage like me, do not waste your money or your time.

Ghost Rider is the best comic character ever!!!  With that being said, that is the only reason I gave this movie a rating of 3 stars.  I am a huge Ghost Rider fan and this movie really disappointed me.  Moreau was a good character, Carion was a good character, Nic Cage was good too (when they didn't have him ""extreme"" acting and jittering around)...even the mother was a good character in it.  Unfortunately Sony screwed this movie up so bad by changing Danny's story line, they could've easily made this into the Spirit of Vengeance comic line w/ Blaze losing most of his power but still helping out the new rider, and Danny becoming the new Ghost Rider would've been a great lead into future movies...but instead they came out with this mixed up decayed script and filming that was an ultimate failure.  Ghost Rider doesn't levitate, he doesn't drive a crappy looking bike, his biker gear/clothes don't look like burnt marshmellows would...the direction of this movie was horrible as it was made by the people that did Crank as a movie of Crank.  While I love Crank it was not the way to do a comic movie, too jittery way too often in the movie...made it cheesy and lame.  This movie should have had more ties to the first since that one had a much better story, and again...it really didn't.  Ultimately, if I wasn't a huge fan of Ghost Rider I would've never seen this in theater or bought the bluray (so I guess they win since I did still buy the bluray).
Another disappointment was Best Buy had an exclusive steel book case if you reserved your copy early.  I reserved mine as soon as it was available and there was supposed to be combo disc sets as there are with most movies these days.  When I went to buy the movie I was told that it was a last minute change by the company to make more money by only selling individual discs...WTH?  My kids follow my lead and look up to me and they like most of the same things I do.  I am a huge Ghost Rider fan, so they follow suit.  How disappointed they were to see the bluray didn't come w/ a DVD copy for them to watch in their room.  Another disappointment since there is no way I would ever pay double the cost for this movie.  I will have to wait for it to join part 1 int he $5.00 DVD bin before they ever get a copy to watch on their DVD players...what a let down.",1339545600,5,2445,4.237068965517241
4726309,4,B005LAIGW8,"Maybe peoples standards are too high I thought the movie was pretty solid.  The only possible critique I can think of is the idea that the devil's physical form is less powerful than the Rider because he's possessing a mortal host.  Well...  The devil is a fallen angel/demon possessing a mortal host but so is the rider.  They're estranged family in that sense the playing field is a little more level but it should still be tilted in the Devil's favor so physically assaulting the devil should be a bad idea.  The plot was fairly straight forward which I liked.  Often the over complicated plots don't work and the script gets so wild they're less satisfying and a guy with a flaming skull for a head seems perfectly sensible in comparison.

I got more of a sense that this was how ghost rider should have been done in the first place. the first film came off as trying to hard to get as close to the original ghost rider(comic book) as possible, but this film is more of the darker ghost rider. I would compare it to the punisher and the sequel War zone. the first film did the OK origin story and the second film gets more into the meat of the character. all the people complaining about Cages acting in this film seems way off to me, i mean, how would you act if you were possessed by the ghost rider.

It has plenty of action, special effects and the same type humor as the first.  It is a sequel so it can't have the same story line as the first. I will admit I did like the first much better but usually sequels aren't as good as the first any way.  The character is still the same and at the end of the first he did say he was 'owning the power' so of course we expected a different story line. We figured it wouldn't pick up exactly where it left off and there is plenty of explanation to fill in the gaps.

Now it has shown up on PSN almost 2 weeks early and I still had some money in my account so I bought it for $5 and decided if I didn't like it oh well, it didn't really cost me anything.

Now after seeing it I have to admit I personally loved it. It had exactly what I wanted, a lot of action and it was fast paced and to me the Ghost Rider was a lot creepier in this movie than in the first. I get why people complained about the acting, I personally only had a problem with Ciaran Hinds who played the devil. His character was very corny, but Nicolas Cage's acting reminded me a lot of how he performed in Face Off which again did not personally bother me. I also agree the kid he is protecting and his mother were not interesting characters but I was glad not only was she not a love interest but the Ghost Rider wanted to kill her, interesting take on the female character in this movie.

I hope as this comes out on video more people see it and enjoy it as much as I did. as I stated I do understand the critisizms but if you just watch it for an enjoyable action movie and some interesting humor it is pretty good.

4726599,5,B005LAIGW8,"Ignore the naysayers, in fact, I invite them to re-watch the movie with a few points in mind (spoilers, below).

Don't expect brilliance, it's a fairly linear plot, delivered in a somewhat campy way with your typical pacing issues, as a bonus it's pretty clear the cast generally had quite a bit of fun making the movie.

In particular, the Ghost Rider was excellent in CGI-mode, there were some clever twists added that made him feel like his own character and added quite a bit of life.  There were also some subtleties that were probably missed easily that I caught after a second run-through.

Also. . . the classic Nic Cage crazy, not only does it work, but it BELONGS.  The problem with the movie is they don't tell you why until it's almost over, and most reviewers make up their mind long before then.

If you want to have your intellect challenged, read a book.  Movies aren't good for that.  If you want some fun emotions and a great ride, then this is far better than most higher ranked movies.

*SPOILERS*

There are three entities, not two.  As it's revealed later in the movie the Ghost Rider is the Angel of Justice, trapped, driven insane, and turned into the Ghost Rider.  If you go back to the 'over the top' Nic Cage crazy moments, you'll notice that they're happening when he's doing something genuinely good and fighting the Ghost Rider.  So, Apparently 'Angel of Justice Driven insane'='Nic Cage Crazy'.  That makes the scene with the informant make a lot more sense.

I LOVE that the Ghost is . . .a somewhat insane Ghost. I gather that it's weakness is simply focus, when it doesn't see anything that's either a needed vehicle or a nice tasty bunch of evil goodness in human form, it gets bored and leaves a sore Mr. Blaze.  The first scene nicely made him 'alien', with his movements and the way he seems to sense more than anything.  The scene at the construction yard makes this nice and blatant, and shows he doesn't obey the same physical laws.  I think also the 'weakening when there's no Yummy Evilbites to see' explains that bit at the end where he blacked out briefly when fighting Carrigan (especially with his two powers of decay AND darkness).

The bit where Danny does his own contract with the fire breathing was absolutely awesomely done.  If somehow the had a six year old girl in pigtails. . then that moment would have been iconic.",1338681600,3,2373,4.578199052132701

Now to the film, I saw this in HDX on VUDU, and enjoyed it...to a point.
It's a complete change in direction from the first film, doesn't seem to follow on at all, and even the garbled comic book intro doesn't really resemble the events of the first movie.
It's done in a different style for sure, that's not necessarily a bad thing, but it does have a rock video, muddled feel.
Budget constraints obviously were in the driving seat, compared to the acting in the first movie, this is definitely worse, even Cage looks tired and bored most of the time, delivering lines as if they were on cue cards.
The story is laughably stupid and predictable, and any actors of note who appear tend to plod through the thin script.
All that said it has a ridiculous charm, this time out the Ghost Rider is much more of a diabolical maniac, and the transformation scenes with Cage trying to hold the beast back are a good laugh.
Quite a bit of action, some very good special effects, especially on the VMax bike they used will please fans of the genre, and I suspect the choppy camera work, flicking in and out of black screen, and slow motion make it look and feel like a comic book storyboard.
Locations for shooting are all Eastern Europe, again obviously driven by a small budget, and although the special effects are good, the whole thing is a bit ridiculous.
I enjoyed it as a stand alone movie, without the depth or story of the first movie for sure, but eye candy nonetheless.
When I first saw the trailer for this last year, I had expected a big budget sequel, and I didn't actually see or here of a theatrical release, which after seeing what's on display might explain the straight to DVD production feel.
3 stars, if you like this kind of stuff, it will generate a couple of hours of harmless fun, if you're looking for a meaningful sequel, don't bother.",1338595200,2,2105,4.413881748071979
4726605,2,B005LAIGW8,"Ghost Rider has always been a niche character for Marvel Comics. The character was born out of an earlier Marvel character named Night Rider. After Marvel writers Roy Thomas and Gary Friedrich and artist Mike Ploog had rein-visioned the character into Ghost Rider during the early 70's it has always remained on the extreme fringes of the Marvel Comics universe. This wouldn't stop Sony (which owned the film rights to the character) to go ahead and adapt it for the big-screen. 2007's Ghost Rider by Mark Johnson was the first and failed attempt to turn the character into a film franchise. It still made enough money despite a near-universal panning of the film by critics and audiences alike. This turn of profit is why Sony once again dipped into the Ghost Rider well and come up with 2012's Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance.

This ""sort of"" sequel ditches Mark Johnson and brings in the dynamic (and I'd say somewhat insane) directing duo of Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor to helm the film. It brings back Nicolas Cage for the role of Johnny Blaze/Ghost Rider. Working from a script by Scott Gimple, Seth Hoffman and David S. Goyer one would think the film had nowhere else to go but up especially with the wacky and frenetic filming style by Neveldine/Taylor. To say that this sequel failed to do anything but finally give this film franchise a final nail in it coffin would be an understatement.

Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance ditches pretty much most of what transpired with the first film and tries to retcon things for the sequel. I'd say this would've been a good idea seeing the first film was truly awful, but what the sequel ended up doing was confuse things even more. The film tries to turn the Ghost Rider persona from just a spirit of vengeance but an angelic being called the spirit of justice which had become corrupted. We get the Devil in the form of Roarke (played by Irish actor Ciaran Hinds) searching for the young boy Danny who is to be his perfect vessel.  Johnny Blaze comes into the picture after being recruited by a drunk French warrior-monk by the name of Moreau (Idris Elba whose performance was one of the lone highlights of the film) who promises to exorcise the demon from Blaze in exchange for finding and saving Danny.

This would've been a good premise if it had several more drafts of it worked on. Though there's still a chance the film would've still sucked in the end. Even the direction from Neveldine/Taylor (Crank, Crank: High Voltage, Gamer) failed to add any heat to the proceedings. They come up with some unique camera angles and action sequences, but gone was the hyper-realistic and frenetic style they've become known for. Their previous films were not stuff to write to one's film critic circles about but they at least had a sense of fun built into them even if their stories defied any sort of logic.

Even the performances by the cast seemed to be something that barely reached the level of one-dimensional. Nicolas Cage tries to channel his inner crazy by way of Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans, but it's too little too late to save the film which never found any sort of footing on the side of competent. Really, the only good thing worth of note was my previous mention of Idris Elba as Moreau who chews the scenery every time he shows up on the screen like it was his last meal. This performance alone wasn't enough to save the film or even make it somewhat entertaining.

Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance was not worth seeing in the theater (especially in 3D though that part of the film was actually quite well done despite being a post conversion) and I'd be willing to admit that it's still not worth seeing on video unless it was for free. What could've been a restart to the series with the inclusion of Neveldine/Taylor instead gives this franchise it's death-knell and most likely help Marvel get the rights back from Sony.

4726607,2,B005LAIGW8,"Nicolas Cage returns as Johnny Blaze in Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance, a sequel to the wretched 2007 movie Ghost Rider. I've never read a Ghost Rider comic and I despised the first film, but actually looked forward to this sequel for a number of reasons. First, this sequel boasts an entirely new creative team and delivered an impressive trailer. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, I've become a huge Nicolas Cage fan. Directed by Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor, the creative minds behind the Crank films, the two are known for injecting their work with a lot of energy. It's with sadness that I report Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance is an uneven, poorly written film only slightly better than its predecessor.

Johnny Blaze is hiding out in Eastern Europe, struggling with the curse of being the Ghost Rider. He's approached by a monk named Moreau (Idris Elba) who wants Johnny to help protect Danny (Fergus Riordan), a young boy being hunted by the Devil (Ciarn Hinds). Initially reluctant, Moreau promises Johnny that his assistance will give him the one thing he wants back most in the world; his soul.

Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance is a complete departure from the first film in tone and style; much darker, yet somehow taking itself less seriously. While Mark Steven Johnson (a very hit & miss writer/director) wrote and directed the first film, the sequel has Scott Gimple, Seth Hoffman, and David S. Goyer handling writing duties. The latter had a hand in writing two terrific comic book-based sequels, Blade II and The Dark Knight. A deeper look into his filmography reveals he's quite the hit & miss writer himself, with films like Demonic Toys and The Crow: City of Angels under his belt. The script successfully strays from the tone of the first film, but is ultimately the film's greatest weakness. It's poorly conceived and ham-fisted, with a story that could serve as any run-of-the-mill, straight-to-video action flick.

The manic direction of Neveldine/Taylor and the mania of the great Nicolas Cage keep the film watchable. Full disclosure; Neveldine/Taylor have never made a great film and some could argue they've never even made a good film. They've directed Crank, its sequel Crank: High Voltage, and Gamer. With the exception of the latter (unseen by me), these are fast-paced, over-the-top, mindless action movies that accomplish exactly what they intend to and are so ridiculously fast-paced and entertaining, I can harbor no ill-will towards them. Their last screenwriting credit was for Jonah Hex. Remember that movie? You don't need to. The Neveldine/Taylor name is not exactly synonymous with high-quality filmmaking, but they are high-energy filmmakers with talent. If they had a good script, they could pull off something spectacular. They do a better job on Ghost Rider than Mark Steven Johnson did, bringing their trademark ""action-movie on amphetamines"" style to it. The fun, animated sequences scattered throughout are a nice touch that I'm sure are entirely their creation.

Then there's Nicolas Cage, a rare actor capable of elevating the worst material. It's easy to say that Cage's recent track record of bad movies is to blame for how ineffective this movie is, but this is likely the Ghost Rider film we'd get with or without him. With him, it's occasionally amusing trash. Without him, it would just be trash. Neveldine/Taylor can only do so much to make it trashy fun, but the amateurish script automatically relegates it to garbage-status. Cage, as usual, elevates it by going over-the-top and having fun with it. It's clear that Cage enjoyed making the film more than I enjoyed watching it, but his boyish, maniacal glee make passages of Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance worth watching. Even Cage can't turn water into wine, but he's an actor that never fails to amuse.

The special effects, including the design of the Ghost Rider are much better; grittier and more appropriate to the character. Hinds is a great actor who does what he can as the Devil, but the main villain is Ray Carrigan (played by Johnny Whitworth), who later becomes Blackout. Blackout may be an interesting villain in comic book form, but on film he's just a moderately amusing, inept villain with the power to decay anything he touches. In its brief running time, Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance races through mildly entertaining action sequences and an uninteresting, predictable plot to eventually reach a disappointing anti-climax. The Ghost Rider character lacks enough depth to ever be a part of a film as impressive as The Dark Knight, but there is potential there for a bad-ass movie. This sequel, while much better than its predecessor, not only fails to live up to that potential but fails to live up to a standard of mediocrity.",1337990400,3,4775,5.016393442622951

I was lucky and only spent $2.00 to see Spirit of Vengeance and was very disapointed in that and if I was hard up for money I would have asked for my 2 bucks back.

4726711,5,B005LAIGW8,"I love comic books and even more, comic book films. Finally, a chance to see cool artwork and badass characters come to life. This movie is just that, bad-ass. The 1st Ghostrider sucked so bad, I cant fathom why so many prefer it to this one. The chemistry between Eva Mendez and Cage felt forced and awful, the effects sucked, and the only two good things about it are the occasional Cage ""freak out, and Sam Elliot. Nicholas Cages earlier work shined and popped because of his over-the-top freak outs. Finally, we see this again here, he brings out the inner kookoo again and I love it! The special effects are 10 times better in this film. The comedy is less cheesy and more ""comical"". Idris Elba is an excellent touch. As much as I like Peter Fonda, Ciaran Hinds was freakier as the Devil(Roarke). This film had a budget of 57,000,000$ and took 2 years to make. That's funny, because its looks and sounds better in many ways than the 2007 version which cost 75,000,000$ and took 6 years to make. The ""Crank"" directors have a gritty quick-motion way of shooting. Its not meant to be compared to The Dark Knight, which unfortunately every hater seems to think is the holy grail of super hero movies. Yet, there have been many incarnations of Batman in the years of comics, and many of them were over the top and cheezy. I still love them. There IS NO comparison however, Batman isn't even the same UNIVERSE, DC and Marvel are very far apart. I LOVED this Ghostrider and had a BLAST watching it, its great popcorn fun. Haters will Hate. What do they expect, the source material comes from a 20 cent comic from 1973, its not Ben-Hur or Lord of the Rings.",1336435200,27,1654,4.4801324503311255

Its definitely not for everybody but i do think that if you are a fan of ghost rider its at least worth watching. I went into it thinking i wouldn't like it based on all of the bad reviews but i thought it was well worth going to see.",1336348800,10,648,4.0310077519379846
4726713,3,B005LAIGW8,"Something you'll notice if you read any of these reviews is that a good portion of the 'bad' reviews compare this movie to the first Ghost Rider movie.  Well, I have a problem with that.  I have been a long time fan of the Ghost Rider going back to the Original 70's comics.  The first movie which purports to give us the origin of the Johnny Blaze Ghost Rider has next to nothing to do with the source material at all.  The first movie turned Johnny Blaze into a goofball who eats Jelly Beans out of a martini glass and keeps the powers of the Ghost Rider against the will of the Devil.  If you like that then you are no fan of the Ghost Rider.

Johnny Blaze was a hard drinking, tortured soul who was tricked by the 'devil' and turned into the Ghost Rider against his will.  He spent the entire run of the original comic series doing everything he could to be freed from his curse.  Johnny Blaze doesn't listen to the Carpenters.  Johnny Blaze doesn't watch TV specials about monkeys.  He's not got time for that crap.

This movie, while it does have it's own problems, plays closer to the 'real' Ghost Rider in every way.  Blaze fights the demon for control constantly.  He seeks an escape from the Spirit of Vengeance at every turn, but he uses the Ghost Rider to his advantage at times.  THIS is the spirit of the original book brought to life.  Not the campy crap-fest that the first movie was.  While the writers did take some creative licence with characters, parts of the origin, and pretty much completely ignore the first film (thank god), they build a rider that is much more like the one we see in the pages of the Ghost Rider comics.  This movie brings us a darker, more menacing Ghost Rider.  When the Rider is on screen, he's unsettling.  He revels in the destruction and death going on around him.  He laughs maniacally as he uses massive mining machines infused with hell-fire to destroy his enemies, and toys with them like a cat would a wounded mouse...

The 'enemies' of the rider in the first film were epic emo-fairy failures.  They are easily dispatched and offer no real challenge for the Rider.  Well, the same can be said about this movie, but at least here they are outmatched by the rider because they are mere mortals facing off against a demon/angel of vengeance/justice.  When the 'heavies' show up in the form of Blackout and finally the Devil, they aren't much of a challenge either, but then again they put up a better fight than the ones in the first film.

Blackout is not the Blackout from the comic, but here he is realized better than most comic book movie villains.  He puts up a fight but there's never really much danger for the Ghost Rider from any of the bad guys.

Where this film falls apart is that the story is at times confusing, Cage often jumps into 'Crazy Cage' mode and ruins some scenes, and a lot of the dialog is just silly.  Where it succeeds is the Crank-style mayhem that is unleashed whenever there is action going on, the visual effects of the Rider are ramped up and embrace the dark side of the Character.  The Flaming Skull in this go around is LEAPS AND BOUNDS better than in the first.  In every way possible the Rider is BETTER rendered here in character and appearance.

See this if you are a fan of the Ghost Rider and not the first Movie that tried to make the Ghost Rider into a Spiderman style super-hero.  THIS is the heart of the Ghost Rider.  Dark, Gritty, Campy and FUN!  Now if they would just ditch Cage and get a decent writer to give a third movie a go...",1335571200,165,3536,4.380952380952381

4726717,5,B005LAIGW8,"The first ghost rider wasn't really a complete film in that it felt like there was something ""missing"" from the movie.  It felt rushed in the way that a studio gets a script, director and cast then pushes out a movie without fitting all of the pieces together.  Ghost rider 2 worked and I look forward to the next.

The script couldn't have been more excellent.  It was tailored to the cast and crew beautifully because all of the characters were fun to watch and I never had to squint my brains acceptably by only giving the movie partial attention, or through drinking/heroin in the eye balls.  I liked nick cage's drive angry for it's campyness but this had campy in spades and, at the same time, was fun to watch.  I can't think of anyone better to play blaze than nick cage because it's obvious that the part was quite literally written for him (which also is apparent with all of the other cast and crew members).

4726860,1,B005LAIGW8,"Oh my god? How did they make make a even worse movie with ghost rider in it? They made Spirt of Vengeance!

Okay, I saw this movie and it didn't make sense based from the first movie. The first movie ended with Johnny wanting to keep his powers and didn't want to give them up to the devil. The the devil wanted to take his powers away because he did a good job and he didn't need to have the curse anymore. Well, in this movie he is trying to get rig of his powers and is the exact opposite of what he wanted to do before? What? What a changed!

If Johnny didn't want his power anymore, he could had just went to the devil and say, hey, I don't want the powers anymore, you can have them back! The devil will take them back with ease. The devils wants the powers back, it's not like he wants ghost rider to get in the way anyways. But, no that's doesn't come to mind in the writers mind at all huh.

In the ending of the first movie it looked like Johnny had control over his powers and would only grow stronger with them. But that didn't come to the writers mind either. So, in this movie, he is losing control has loss control because he kept the ghost rider from coming out for so long. It just doesn't make sense.

I really didn't like the fight scenes in this movie. They looked so lame. I actually like the first movie fights more and that is a under statement already.

Spoiler Alert!!!

If I get over the story from the beginning and totally forget it then it's okay after that. The Ghosts Riders trys to save a boy from bad men and if his does he will get his curse lifted from him. Johnny learns that the Ghost Rider gets his powers from an angel that got drag to hell and became a prisoner there. The angel grew more and more twisted the longer he was there. Then, the angel wasn't a angel anymore and become a spirt. That is, the spirt of vengeance. After some time, the devil will use this spirt powers to put into people and that person is the ghost rider. Johnny after losing powers of course needs his powers again because he not strong enough to fighter bad guys without his powers. So, it turns out that the boy he saved is the devil son and he gives johnny his powers back.

One more thing I should point out. If the devil's son has the devil's power as well, than the son can just take away Ghosts Riders powers anytime he wanted to. So, Johnny is pretty much on easy road, if he really didn't want his powers anymore.

Okay, well that's a great story plot, it just didn't make much sense if you look at the first movie. This movie is a rental for sure.",1334361600,3,2574,4.12375249500998

4726973,3,B005LAIGW8,"No other character in the Marvel Universe is more suited to the manic, bipolar antics of Nicolas Cage than the Ghost Rider, which is why the 2007 film turned out to be so disappointing. Directed by Mark Steven Johnson with all the flair of dry toast, all of Ghost Rider's most unique genre attributes were frittered away in a bland attempt to follow in the phenomenal success of Batman Begins. With Johnson mostly out of the picture, the rapidly produced sequel gets a much needed fuel injection with the twin duo of Neveldine/Taylor behind the camera, bringing with them the same chaotic energy that led them to success with both Crank movies.

Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance is a more complicated beast, and for the most part Neveldine/Taylor are up to the challenge.  More in tune with the character's dark, pulpy roots, the supernatural grindhouse feel will be a welcome reminder to fans of Cage's underrated Drive Angry.  After a brilliant, Mignola-esque animated sequence zipping us through Johnny Blaze's deal with the devil that transformed him into the Ghost Rider, we learn he's been hiding out from civilization out in eastern Europe. His hopes of keeping the demon inside him locked away are quickly dashed with the arrival of Moreau(Idris Elba), a gun toting, hard drinking warrior monk who warns him of the Devil's(Ciaran Hinds) plan to attain a new host body. To do it, he'll enlist another damned soul named Carrigan(Johnny Whitworth) to kidnap the son of Nadya(Violante Placido), a woman he also struck an ill pact with. The Devil is a hell of salesman, apparently. He's always closing. The promise of eternal redemption is all Blaze needs to sign on for his most dangerous mission yet, playing the unfamiliar role of protector.

With a trimmed down budget, this version of Ghost Rider has a tougher, meaner look to it. The lack of polish makes the flame-headed biker all the more visceral and terrifying, especially when he's got some poor thug in the grip of his soul destroying ""Penance Stare"". The action scenes should be where the film really shines, but unfortunately the directors don't go far enough. While some of it is pretty awesome to behold, like when Ghost Rider jumps in a giant construction vehicle and lights it with hellfire, others are uninspiring.  Undoubtedly they've got a better grip on what makes the character tic, but you expect Neveldine/Taylor to go absolutely ape dump on a movie like this, and sometimes it feels like they held back.

Essentially shot in exactly the same manner as Crank, it's when the Ghost Rider is on the open road that are the brightest spots. Sure it's a little dizzying with all the jump cuts, speed ramps and other crazy camera tricks the directors typically employ, but it works to give the film a distinctive look. Even during the rare times when the action slows down, there is rarely a dull moment. A self aware sense of humor, such as when Ghost Rider starts urinating hellfire, occasionally works but often feels a little forced.

Cage gives the sort of performance you'd expect for a movie this insane. He's constantly ""on"", flashing his teeth at every opportunity and always looking as if he's about to snap and jump off the cliff or something. While that may not work as often as he employs it, that's exactly the mode Cage needed to be in for this role. What's more entertaining is Idris Elba, who appears to be trying to match Cage for scene chewing honors. His chatty, wobbly Moreau is a total 180 from the strong and silent guardian he played in Thor.

 While it's not a great movie, fans of Ghost Rider will leave the theater far happier than they did five years ago. There's still a better film to be made, and perhaps it'll happen in a few years with a slightly better script.

4726975,5,B005LAIGW8,"Yes, this movie did cost less to make than the first, but you wouldn't know it if you saw it.  Most of the expenses of the first film were in the development of the cgi which was simply still being worked after already delaying the first film as long as they could.  This final tweaking of the cgi has made a huge difference and those who found themselves surprised at any disapointment they had over how boring such a realistic human skull could still be would probably enjoy another look.  The final tweaking one might sense was missing before looks to be there now.

I've been a fan of this character as long as Nicolas Cage has been and I knew next to nothing about the actor or his other works til I learned he was going to play my favorite comicbook character.  So I'm able able to take his appeareace in this movie at face value.  (So to speak.)

While I never cared whether whoever would play the role would actually look like Johnny Blaze I could only hope whether he had any idea what it was that made the character and story of the original comicbook work, as least for me.  When I heard he wanted to do a story with a DaVinci Code theme I wanted to dance around the room, especially since I had already just seen his work in ""National Treasure"", which impressed me even more than ""Face Off""

While the story in the movie is being protrayed more quickly and concisely then in the comicbook and therefore has some unaviodable changes, I believe I can still see tbe same basic plot elements I enjoyed so much in the orignal version, and if I'm not mistaken this is only the beginning of a rip-snorting, dares-you-to-think-outside-the-box tale, and what many people aren't saying is that this script was almost the one they went with the first time, *and* more in keeping with the original comic, much as I enjoyed the first film for looking like it otherwise still had those same basic plot elements.

If most of what you know about religions in general and the history behind them is what you learned from the Media, past and present, and are smart enough to know it, then I recommend you buy this dvd so you can watch it again and again in the detail in which it was meant meant to be seen.  You might even notice some clues that could be hiding in plain sight.  At least I like to think so.  And if I'm wrong, I know I'm going to still have a lot of fun trying to guess what may happen next, cause it's that kind of film folks, and it's been way too long since I enjoyed paying to see any film over again while it was still in the theaters.

My credentials?  Well, I've been around long enough to remember when the word ""sequel"" mean't ""sequel"", and you can take that for whatever it's worth to you.",1331769600,7,2711,4.330039525691699
4726976,4,B005LAIGW8,Summarize the movie into one word......EPIC! The movie technically is not a sequel but a reboot/re-imagine of the Ghost Rider character. The story takes place in Europe where at first you see the company logo then you see a beautiful helicopter angle of Romania and you see Idris Elba's character riding the motorcycle to his secret headquarters and then you see Carrigan and the movie takes place where insanity is everything and insanity does count in this movie. I can't wait to get this on Blu-Ray so I can watch over and over again.,1331769600,7,537,4.723404255319149
4726977,2,B005LAIGW8,"** This review has MINOR spoilers **

The devil demands his due in the second Ghost Rider film, Spirit of Vengeance.

The movie is very heavy in special effects and sometimes they work quite well.  The man having his motorbike shot out from under him and keeps firing at a car as he slo-mo's off the ledge to his apparent death was very funny.  And I said to self, ""Man that's corny.""  And not worth the premium 3D price I paid for it either.

Nicholas Cage returns as the Ghost Rider, trying to suppress his demon so he travels all the way to Europe.  Why Europe?  Who knows?

A pretty girl who has also made a deal with the devil has a child who is now of age and the devil wants him as a new body for his power.

We meet a bounty hunter and his gang who just happens to be her ex-boyfriend and is hired by the devil to carry out the kidnapping and eventually becomes a hellish thing that can make anything decay - except Twinkies!  The Twinkies thing was funny for obvious reasons.

Piss  Fire and Other Silly Scenes:

Yep, we have Ghost Rider, albeit in a dream sequence thing, pissing fire and nodding and laughing.  Pretty immature and silly and adds nothing to the plot.  More a demonstration of the prowess of the computer compositors but that's about it.

What's with David Goyer?  He writes Dark Knight but this film is on par, in a bad way, with Jumper.  More effects and not much of a story.  And no appearance by Stan Lee!

Bottom Line:  The first film was better - more humorous without the toilet humor.  With Vengeance, there was not much in terms of 3D so save your money.  The backstory of the Rider having been an angel of justice was cool.  And the power to turn any vehicle into a hell-fire buggy was fun.  Just not a lot here.  Lots of flash and little substance.  Some corny lines and a whole ""cult in the desert"" thing that made no sense to me.  Who were these guys was not really explained.  Sorry Cage, back to basics.
