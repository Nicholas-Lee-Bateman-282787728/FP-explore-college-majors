7207704,5,B00Y4S7H4Q,"I bought this DVD in order to work up to doing the entire&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ultimate-Yogi/dp/B007OYK32K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ultimate Yogi</a>&nbsp;program.  It contains three practices, and each is just over 50 minutes long.  Each one builds on the previous one in terms of difficulty (or so it has seemed to me), which makes them nice to use to build up your strength.  I love all three of these so far, and highly recommend this disk!

As a bit of background, I used to take bi-weekly yoga classes about fifteen years ago, but no longer have the time to attend live classes.  I own about ten yoga DVDs (my current favorites are the Raviana Kundalini ones), but, as mentioned above, I've been looking for something that was more of a system, instead of stand-alone DVDs, and thought that this particular Yoga Foundations disk would be a good way to work into the Ultimate Yoga program.

Since I have a bit of background in yoga, I've found that the poses are very easy to follow along with.  If you're new to yoga, this DVD also comes with a very nice booklet that details all of the poses, so you can read more about them before or after doing the three practices.  If you're brand new, I would also say to repeat practice 1 a few times before moving on the second and third practices.

Travis' voice is also very soothing, and I love how he explains everything so that you can listen and follow along, instead of having to peek up at the screen.  With some yoga and workout DVDs I own, the cueing is such that you constantly have to look at the TV to see what is going on.

All in all, this is a great DVD that should be useful for beginning and intermediate yoga students.

Namaste!",1357862400,26,1758,4.727868852459016
7207705,5,B00Y4S7H4Q,"Let me give you some background info about my experience with yoga before I talk about the DVD. This will help you understand why I went into such detail and am giving this such a positive review. I have a very extensive exercise video library. I own a wide variety of exercise styles. When I became interested in practicing yoga I started taking a beginner class at a local yoga studio in my neighborhood. The experience was invigorating and breathtaking because it always left me feeling very stretched, relaxed, and like I had challenge my body to do things it had never done but in a good, non-dreadful way. It truly was a beginner class and the focus was mainly on the physical with very minimal spiritual undertones; just want I wanted!!

Unfortunately, I had to stop taking the classes because it was very expensive and the hours the studio operated wasn't really conducive for me so it was like a waste of money (I was paying $100 a month and was really only able to make it on Saturdays consistently because they closed at 7:00pm and I'd just be getting home from work around that time). Anyway, I opted to invest in some beginner yoga dvd's knowing that I wouldn't get the same effect of being in a yoga studio as far as the atmoshere, having an instructor walk over to me to correct my poses, or the networking with other beginner yogi's, BUT I thought I would invest in a dvd hoping to at least get the same physical benefits from it. Going to the gym to do those classes was not an option as I found the few times I had a gym membership and took those classes that they were not able to be consistent with the level because every week there were different people in the class so we never really flowed or built upon what we had learned the previous week like when I was going to the yoga studio.

Anyway, I would read reviews about the different yoga dvd's, view them on collage video or youtube thinking that by viewing the dvd's in advance, I would be able to make an informed purchase. Well let me say this, up until I purchased Travis Eliot's ""Yoga Foundations"" I have experienced three things with most of the beginner yoga dvd's I have invested in thus far: 1.) Most of the beginner yoga dvd's are either to slow with extreme emphasis on the breath and someone who has the attention span of a 2 year old such as myself gets so bored and distracted from nothingness that I lose interest within the first 5 minutes of the dvd. Don't get me wrong, it is very important to focus on the breath as it is a very intrical part of doing yoga; however, dragging the breathing sections out for more than 1 minute becomes a distraction and affects my interest level 2.) Some put too much emphasis on the spiritual aspect of yoga; I'm not looking for that, I'm already foundated in my beliefs, 3.)Calling a yoga dvd beginner yet doing a pose where you want someone who is inflexible like me to be able to connect my fingers on both hands behind my back, or asking me to do a pose in some weird position that only someone who has practiced yoga regularly, at an intermediate level could do, is not realistic!!!

See the thing about me is that I have always exercised intermittently for years so I am not a beginner to exercise. I am just a beginner to yoga, but not a beginner beginner so I needed a pace that was perfect for me, and the poses had to be challenging but realistic for where I am. By golly I finally found it with Travis Elliot's ""Yoga Foundations."" This is a wonderful dvd. It has three levels each about 40 minutes or more and they all build upon the previous workout. You do poses that a beginner can realistically do or work themselves into. He talks you through the poses and everything he was saying made me think about the connection between my body and my everyday life in general. His voice was not annoying and you see each person practicing the poses at their own level so you get to see different variations and modifications that may be more closely suitable to what you can do. I wish I had found this yoga dvd about 15 yoga dvd's ago. I would've saved some money and been much further along in my stretches and poses but it's all good. Sometimes you have to experience the bad in order to know what the good is and appreciate the good when it finally comes your way.

I know that any form of exercising can be challenging when you are new to it or trying to go to the next level. I strongly believe we should aim to challenge ourselves to do better each time but it has to flow and make me want to come back to it and this dvd accomplished that.  The pace was not too slow, not too fast, and it was not spiritually driven. I cleaned up my living room, put my yoga mat in the middle of the floor, cut the lights out and practiced the moves with just the light from the t.v. shining in. At one point, when I closed my eyes, I almost felt as though I was in a yoga studio. When I finished I felt rejuvinated, invigorated, stretched, and happy. I slept like a baby that night for the first time in a long time. To me, this is what an at home experience to a yoga dvd should feel like. Namaste!!!",1357776000,59,5126,4.3022774327122155
7207706,5,B00Y4S7H4Q,The cd is not rushed and you are able to follow the instructions very well.  Travis has a very soothing voice and doesn't sound rushed or grating.

He is crystal clear, I rarely have to look at the video to understand what I am supposed to do. He is great at reminding of how and when we are supposed to breathe.

7207721,5,B00Y4S7H4Q,"I like this video very much. Travis' voice is pleasant, instructions are clear. It's a little high level for me at 68, but I modify it mainly by not holding the poses as long.

I'm not new to yoga, but I've never stuck with it long enough to really get the benefits. This supplements a chair yoga class I go to.

7207728,5,B00Y4S7H4Q,"Great foundation for Travis Eliot's Ultimate Yogi series! I first purchased Ultimate Yogi, but as a total newbie to yoga I found it difficult to keep up with the Ultimate dvds since I had no knowledge of poses or proper form, and they move fairly quickly through those. So I purchased this Yoga Foundations dvd, and it is perfect! Travis walks you slowly through the poses, explains proper form, and really gives you time to understand and accomplish, without making you feel like a loser newb. He encourages everyone to listen to the wisdom of their own body, and proceed at their own individual pace. He really put me at ease ..... made me feel and understand that the connection with my own mind/body/spirit during my practice of yoga is paramount, and that 'keeping up' with the models on the dvd is secondary. Just THAT knowledge, spoken by him, made a huge difference .... gone went 'performance anxiety' and I was able to get out of my head, and get into my heart. What a difference!

Also, there are 3 levels that you progress through at your own pace. This dvd is well done, Travis is encouraging and informative, and has created in me a love and appreciation for yoga. I actually look forward to getting up every morning and hitting my yoga mat! I get such a deep sense of peace and strength that carries with me through the rest of my day. Thank you, Travis!!  :)",1412726400,3,1374,4.536290322580645
7207729,5,B00Y4S7H4Q,"Wonderful DVD for building a proper and solid foundation in yoga. Travis Eliot does an excellent job of making sure you're taught the correct way to move through each pose. You have the option to choose to do each of the three classes with or without music. The tutorial goes through 3 different difficulty levels of downward dog. I found this to be really helpful since downward dog is like your ""home base"" in yoga.  The first, a modified downward dog, would be great for someone who has no yoga experience. The second requires a little more upper body strength, and the third is an advanced variation. I purchased this DVD as a prerequisite to the Ultimate Yogi program also instructed by Travis Eliot and am so happy I did! The classes last about 45 minutes and I feel great afterward!",1410048000,2,789,4.595744680851064
7207730,4,B00Y4S7H4Q,"If you are a complete yoga noob buy this. These are excellent training DVDs.

Travis' instructional style is methodical, well-paced and pushes you just enough without going too far.  The three foundation classes aren't meant to be taken one after another, move forward only after you've mastered the previous one. But if you are interested in pursuing the 108 day set (The Ultimate Yogi), this is the logical prerequisite. I feel far better prepared after several weeks with this DVD.",1407196800,3,484,5.0375

7207733,4,B00Y4S7H4Q,"I have several yoga DVDs with which to compare this one to...whilst they all cover a similar range of skill and technique, Travis Eliot's style is a bit more talkative during those moments that you would expect there to be silence. Once an instructor has told you what to do and how to do it you would expect to see some dead time whilst you go ahead and perform the move...with this DVD Travis would keep on talking, saying anything related or unrelated to fill in the time.

I can imagine for some people, this would be annoying but somehow it works for me... he is  a very charmig person on camera... for some reason I kept thinking that jhe has the same type of accent as Matthew McConnaughty. Kind of works for me....",1403568000,7,722,4.380597014925373

7207737,5,B00Y4S7H4Q,"I used to do yoga A LOT, but then I moved, got a new job, started school again and consequently fell off the bandwagon. When I decided to pick the practice up again, I also decided to get some new materials and inspiration (since it had been years since I bought a new yoga DVD). I searched pretty thoroughly and ultimately decided to purchase Yoga Foundations with Travis Eliot. BEST DECISION! Travis Eliot is one impressive yogi, but this DVD is so accessible to EVERYONE, whether you've done yoga before or not.
The DVD is made up of 3 full classes, each increasing in difficulty and intensity. I'm taking my practice slow and deliberate and admittedly I haven't even done the third class yet despite having the DVD for three months. This is a purely personal choice, in that I don't want to progress to the next class level until I have mastered the previous class. When I did the second class I found out that my plow pose isn't anywhere close to where it used to be. But after a few rounds with the second class my toes barely touch the floor, and that is so exciting! I'm sure the third (and most intense) class will be just as fulfilling as the first two. After sticking with the DVD for a couple of weeks to a month I promise you'll notice more space in places like your hamstrings and shoulders.
I would recommend this DVD to everyone and anyone. Travis makes yoga incredibly accessible and he is truly inspiring. It doesn't take a ton of time before seeing progress. Three classes on one DVD also means you can be picky and choosy about what to practice any particular day.",1401062400,3,1584,4.4655172413793105
7207738,5,B00Y4S7H4Q,I got this for my partner. She had been wanting a good yoga series in which the verbal cues were enough. She dislikes having to look up to see where she should be in a particular movement flow. The Travis Eliot discs were so good we searched out his 108 day plan and she's going to start that soon. Never been happier with a purchase.,1400630400,,334,4.153846153846154
7207739,4,B00Y4S7H4Q,"I like this Yoga CD as an alternate to four other yoga CDs that I rotate during the week. I generally do the third session, but gravitate to the second if I need a bit of a break and walking has tired my legs. It is not necessarily for beginners, but could be. I can answer from that point, as beginners vary in health and flexibility. It took me a while to get used to Travis talking all the time, but eventually it becomes part of the whole process and his constant reminders do help, when the mind drifts or you forget the proper purpose of the yoga pose and the integration of body and mind.",1400371200,,595,4.137931034482759
7207740,5,B00Y4S7H4Q,"I bought this in order to prepare for the Ultimate Yogi series. I really enjoyed it. Challenging but not overly so. Travis gives crystal clear directions on how to enter positions, and how to transition. He also gives you slight variations or alternates to take in order to be able to not over exert yourself if your body is telling you not to enter that position. I used it for about three weeks before transitioning to the Ultimate Yogi, and it served me well. I plan to hang on to it to use for some variation in my exercise routine.",1400025600,2,536,4.37

I have been doing yoga off and on for about 12 years, but because I am never consistent I always have a period where I want to go back to basics.

I love that I don't even need to look up at the TV b/c he's explaining exactly how to move and pose.  His voice is calming and after doing the first session I feel like I had a massage.

7207751,5,B00Y4S7H4Q,"The Ultimate Yogi is an awesome yoga program.  However, if you are new to yoga, I do not recommend you start with that.  Those routines are made to be challenging.  You go through many of the poses quickly, and not many instructions are given.  If you are new to yoga, I highly recommend that you start with Yoga Foundations.

In the first video, Travis will introduce you to basic yoga movements and poses, as well as the concept of synchronizing your breaths with the movements (which is really the crux of yoga).  After mastering the basic, you can move on to the second video, which introduces you to many of the ""intermediate"" yoga poses.  Travis takes plenty of time to explain how to do each pose correctly.  I suggest you use this video until you are very comfortable with each of the poses.  Finally, the final video introduces you to more intermediate poses.  Furthermore, it shows you how yoga can actually become a challenging workout.  After mastering these videos, you will be ready to start the Ultimate Yogi.

Please try to make this a part of your daily routine.  Not only will yoga increase your strength, flexibility, balance, and fitness, but it's also been proven to decrease cortisol levels, which hinders muscle growth and increases aging.  So in 20 years, you will be more fit and will literally have a younger body.",1385596800,2,1340,4.719827586206897

Also, it was distracting to face away from the television, especially as a beginner.  So I would recommend watching the series first before attempting the poses.

I've contacted the seller about whether or not the tutorial covers more poses.  I'm hoping my DVD is damaged...otherwise this may be a return as it does not cover what was advertised.",1384905600,6,666,4.53781512605042

7207757,5,B00Y4S7H4Q,I just love this DVD. Travis Eliot has a way of making you feel so relaxed that you feel you can do it. He is very reassuring and doesn't ask you to push pass your limits. I have had this help me with my back significantly. Once I get through this DVD I plan to go n to his cross train DVD and then eventually to his 108 day Ultimate Yogi. I did some of the UY at a friends house and I worked out with a good sweat without feeling like I was killing myself. A good challenge with rests if you need them.

The meditation elements are divine. I feel like I am doing the very best exercise I can do when I follow this video. It does not strain your muscles and allows you time to immerse into the poses. The coaching is perfect for my building a foundation in yoga. This video is also a huge time saver. Instead of fighting traffic in the heat and rain, I can go home and relax into the best exercise ever! I can hardly wait to try all of the other Ultimate yogi videos.

Hmmm, I guess in fairness I should mention that I thought the level one ""workout""--if you can call it that--was pretty enjoyable and relaxing aside from the issues noted above, which kept making me want to crack up throughout the routine. Not sure that's very good for my chakras.

7207763,5,B00Y4S7H4Q,"I needed to switch up from a dull stretching routine I'd followed off and on for years. Selected theTravis Elliot DVD upon recommendation from my sister who practices his Ultimate Yogi series. For background, I'm 66 years old, very active and in good shape already, but suffer the typical stiffness and soreness due to age. The 3 lessons on the DVD become progressively more difficult, and I almost quit after #2. REALLY...Plow and Shoulder Stand? I couldn't even get my knees and hips to go in the seated position. Now I'm glad I went back to #1 and started over, and by gosh 3 weeks later I'm pretty close to doing those more difficult poses. Listen to Travis when he says to listen to your body and go with the flow. I've purchased 2 more of his DVDs and am making good progress on the Cross Training. I'm presently rotating that session with the Yoga Foundations 2 and 3 sessions and practicing every day. I practice in the mornings and am left energized for my day of gardening, mowing and a long walk, rafting or whatever.",1366416000,7,1028,4.532258064516129

Four students of various levels participate and Travis leads the class as an instructor, observing and adjusting the students poses as necessary, with tips on how to improve your pose. I have been practicing yoga at home for over a year and have purchased and tried several DVD's with varied success. I have narrowed my weekly workouts to four different DVD's and of those,this is my favorite.  The practice has a nice flow with one pose moving fluidly into another. There are three levels with classes lasting approximately 45-60 minutes, all suitable for beginner or advanced beginner and varied enough that you can use just one or alternate. Although Level 1 is the easy beginner level, I find the poses and breathing exercises in it so beneficial I still incorporate it into my workout. I have no problem doing Level 2 or Level 3 (the only pose I modify is plough which I modify with half plough) and believe they are .

This insert provides the sequencing of poses for each of the three routines as well as offers additional form and alignment guidelines for some of the postures.

Eliot teaches live to a small class of background exercisers.  Sometimes he briefly moves through a few postures, but in general, he is walking amongst the group.  One thing I found confusing was that he seemed to alternate between sometimes mirror cuing to the viewer and sometimes NOT doing so; even the class members appeared uncertain at times as to which side they were supposed to be on.  Similarly, I thought Eliot came off as somewhat inexperienced, both as a video instructor (in addition to the cuing issue, he would also sometimes have you faced AWAY from the TV, which was awkward) and also in his general yoga instruction.  Regarding the latter, I just noticed that he didn't provide much detail on alignment, nor did he give cues such as to change the crossing of your hands in postures.

Eliot did have a nice, easy-going manner, and I am sure many people would find him soothing as well as enjoy the relaxed vibe of these practices.  I don't believe that Eliot provides quite enough instruction for those brand-new to yoga, so I would suggest that this DVD would be best suited to those at an experienced beginner level.",1361923200,12,3363,5.25607476635514

7207767,5,B00Y4S7H4Q,"I have been anti yoga for a long time as I've never found a class or video that I've enjoyed.  I always felt like I had to be able to move into the positions immediately, and that if I wasn't flexible or able to hold myself up only with my pinky (I exaggerate), I was a failure.  After reading the reviews and watching a clip of the DVD, I decided to try this video.  OMG, changed my perspective and started to impact my life in so many positive ways.  One of my goals this year was not to attract or cause negativity, and this DVD has definitely helped in my success (yes, we're not even done with January, but considering the type of job I have and my family, that's saying A LOT).  Since trying it on day one, I have felt healthier, both mentally and physically.  Travis' instruction is PERFECTION.  I could close my eyes through this ENTIRE workout and not have to look up to see how to get into the moves.  The DVD has three workouts, the first focuses more on strength and foundational poses.  The second still has a lot of stretch moves, but starts to bring in strength, and I just did the third workout yesterday (going on my third week) and it is more cardio and strength.  I have NEVER been able to go from plank pose, into a pushup pose to the floor...EVER...the third workout has a few moves where you go from plank, to pushup, to cobra, to downward dog, and I was able to do the pushup component EVERY time.  Even though the third routine WORKS you out, I did not get tired or exhausted during the workout, and felt great after.  I also am amazed at how the time flies...most of the workouts are close to an hour long, if not longer, and I can't even tell.  Other workouts I'm counting down the minutes and can't wait until it's over, with this, I just shut down my brain, do the moves to the best of MY ability, and come out totally relaxed and ready for the world.  I find myself looking forward to the next workout, and have done at least 6 days a week.  I find myself making time.  Travis is PHENOMENAL...LOVE him.  Soothing, awesome instructor, keeps it to the routine, and guides you through the moves so you tailor it to the best of YOUR ability.  Highly recommend.  For the price, you're getting an AMAZING deal.  I bought the Ultimate Yogi 108 day program, and look forward to starting that once I've mastered this foundational DVD.  I am calmer, can control my stress and just take everything with a grain of salt.  If you're truly wanting to learn yoga, relieve stress, build strength and stamina, you will not be disappointed.",1358899200,52,2551,4.360169491525424
8717526,5,B00Y4S7H4Q,"I bought this item YEARS ago and just realized I never left a review! Preposterous considering this program changed my life.
I was at the end of my rope...
Back and hip pain from lingering skeletal issues issues during pregnancy (all of my bones in my lower back and hips would literally come out of place randomly and had to be reset by a chiropractor ) left me pretty much crippled. The strain on the rest of my skeletal system trying to keep moving caused other things like disc slippage and nerve pinches. The lack of ability to bend and move well was wreaking havoc on my health. I was plagued by CONSTANT pain and deep depression.
I was desperate.
I needed something soul felt and heaven sent.
I needed hope... and encouragement.
I needed healing.
Because I was ready to give up and die... at 36.
It was that bad...
In a last ditch effort to reclaim my life, I began researching...
Looking through all of the health and wellness programs available, I decided I wanted to try The Ultimate Yogi.
Knowing I was in no state to throw myself into an intense program unprepared (as well as afraid to invest in a costly program that I wasn't sure I could even DO), I bought this to test the instructor as well as build up my strength and endurance.
I was afraid, but fiercely determined to do my best.
I decided 30 days should be enough time to prepare my body...
I participated for 30 days, daily...no matter how sore I was. I followed his instruction to the letter, easing out to child's pose whenever I needed to.
At the end of 30 days... I ordered the UY program but did another 30 days of Yoga Foundations...
I was afraid to hurt myself...
At the end of those 30 days, I was afraid I still wasn't ready...that I might never be...
I had joined the UY Facebook group and saw that a large group of members were starting the 108 on Jan. 8th...just a few days away...
I threw fear to the wind and joined that round.
For the first week I could hardly walk, but I was there...on the mat...every day. Start to finish.
Weeks 2-4 I was developing flexibility, endurance and strength at an surprising rate. By the end of the second month... astonishingly, I was strong, capable and happy. I was master of my body once again! The rest was just pure joy. Indescribable happiness, satisfaction and contentment. With this video and the Ultimate Yogi, if you think you can, you will.
My deepest thanks to all involved.

I love Travis Eliot, I use some of his you tube videosto practice yoga and decided to buy this one, I love the 3rd part, his voice is soothing, and he knows his stuff, he glides you through the sequence with a natural flow so you are always facing the screen and talks you through each pose and each pose prepares you for the next, he  moves slow enough  so you actually get just enough stretch out of each pose but fast enough so you get a nice work out, but your not feeling like your running a marathon.

I just retired, so now I have time to devote to learning and practicing the routine.  I have a ballet background, and am fairly flexible for my age, so I decided to try learning Yoga from a DVD in the privacy of my home.  I watched it many times before trying the poses to learn what to do without being able to watch it while doing it.  I had also viewed a Rodney Yee instructional pose video first.  Between both, I was able to learn and practice the poses in Foundations I and II.  I Love Travis' calming voice, the music, and instructional content of the DVD.

The DVD is geared toward those new to yoga and the instruction is awesome. Even though I started out with limited flexibility I was able to do all his moves. He does encourage the use of a yoga block if you are not flexible. Everything flows very smoothly and by the end of the DVD I feel awesome. I was a little concerned at the length of the DVD as my attention span isn't that great but the time flies by and I don't even realize the time while doing the DVD. I have truly become more flexible already and will def try more of his DVD's in the future.
