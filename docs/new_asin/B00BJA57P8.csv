8569473,5,B00BJA57P8,"At 80 minutes. this is the shortest of the SWSCA DVDs that I have watched so far.
Given the length of this DVD I think that the sale price is more appropriate than the regular price.
The instruction is excellent.  The fact that these finishes can be created with just paints is amazing.
The materials used require safety precautions such as a respirator and a well ventilated work space.
While I am certain that the techniques demonstrated here can be used with other materials, I mention the safety precautions because this is not the kind of project that can be duplicated exactly in your living room or craft room etc..  If you wish to use the exact materials used in the video then you will need an appropriate work space.  The first few steps in the process according to the video utilize materials that are commonly used for painting cars.
Again an excellent instructional video just not a do it in your apartment kind of project.",1482451200,,936,4.626506024096385
