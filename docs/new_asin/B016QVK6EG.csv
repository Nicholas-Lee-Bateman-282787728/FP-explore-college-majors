8737150,3,B016QVK6EG,"Axe is total crap and no it's not ""so bad it's good"" ...it's so bad it's AWFUL. If you listen to the directors commentary and watch the extra documentary you'll see that it's amazing a movie was even made. The director had never even been on a film set and hadn't been to film school. They shot it in a week for $25,000 and it shows. It's frustrating though because you can clearly see that if they had had more time and a bigger budget Axe aka LISA LISA could have turned out well.

So after watching Axe,hating it, and rating it a 3.0 on imdb i didn't expect much from the directors next effort...but i was pleasantly surprised. Kidnapped Coed is a huge leap forward in writing, directing, and acting. It actually kept my attention the whole way through. It has some great scenes but still suffers from a rushed shooting schedule and a paltry budget.

The best thing about this release is the 90 minute documentary! Yes, the documentary about the making of these two films is actually longer than either of the films themselves lol. Any fan of 70's cinema will enjoy watching it. Check it out.",1469404800,3,1095,4.47
8737151,5,B016QVK6EG,"Lovingly restored films and brilliant overall package and design (including a CD of the film scores and commentaries and writings by Stephen Thrower, author of Nightmare USA: The Untold History of The Exploitation Independents) make this one of the best Severin films releases if not one of the top blu ray releases of the year!

Highly recommended for fans/interested parties of: Independent American Genre Films, Regional Filmmaking, Horror, 1970s film, film history etc.",1466208000,2,473,5.47945205479452

8737155,5,B016QVK6EG,"BOTTOM LINE: If you're of fan of grindhouse films, exploitation movies or obscure ephemeral cinema then this double feature of AXE & KIDNAPPED COED is a most definite MUST-OWN. It's such a tragedy Friedel only made these two quirky films. The talent was there to give us so, so much more. It was everyone's loss. Let's all just be grateful that at last these two movies are available, complete and in such terrific shape, along with such a wealth of well-produced bonus content! A standing ovation to the crew at Severin Films. 5 STARS!!!

AXE (aka Lisa, Lisa): Lisa is an attractive young woman who lives in a remote farmhouse, spending all of her time caring for her invalid grandfather. The loneliness of living so far from civilization and the exhausting pressures of being a full-time caregiver for the old man are taking their toll on Lisa's fragile mental state. Then three lowlifes on the run from the law break into the farmhouse one evening and ravage the poor girl. Her psychological stability was already precariously balanced and these hoods have unknowingly pushed it past the tipping point. Now for Lisa, it's payback time.

KIDNAPPED COED (aka The Kidnap Lover, aka Date with a Kidnapper, et, al.): Small-time crook Eddie Matlock kidnaps young Sandra Morley, the college-age daughter of a well-to-do local businessman. Eddie intends to use the ransom money to turn his life around AND do better by his ailing mother, who lives in a rundown nursing home. What he thought would be a simple caper turns into a nightmarish ordeal; both he & his young hostage are put through all kinds of hell ...and they end up falling for one another.

THOUGHTS: Prior to this new Blu-ray  release, I did not know of Frederick Friedel's film AXE, and while his first film is rougher on almost every level than KIDNAPPED COED it still ranks miles above much of the selfsame exploitation fare produced in & around the same time period. Friedel's photographic background is his greatest strength as a director. His shot composition, (with ample help from cinematographer Austin McKinney), is consistently compelling. That and the fact that he knew literally NOTHING about the movie-making process actually becomes more of an asset than a liability. His two films don't follow the ""traditional"" structure of most motion pictures and it's because of this that they're so fascinating and refreshing. I rented KIDNAPPED COED decades ago. The sleazy cover art & exploitative title implied at least a few cheap grindhouse-style thrills. Those I got, but what I did not expect was that COED would be so against type and surprisingly refreshing, especially from a visual perspective. The plot was fairly straightforward 70's grindhouse fodder, but the atypical execution of said plot was so odd that it immediately drew me in and held me spellbound for the entire running time of the film. What I thought would be a mildly offensive time killer filled with a few gratuitous softporn shots and penny ante action sequences turned out (happily) to be nothing of the kind. Yes, there are low-rent action gags & some sex, (a brutal rape scene early on and a brief consensual lovemaking scene later, both without nudity and mostly off camera), but it's the visual look of the film and the askew ""road picture"" style that make this minimalist wonder truly fascinating to behold. I was so impressed by KIDNAPPED COED that I made a copy and held onto it for decades. Several years ago I discovered COED on DVD thru Something Weird Video on a double bill with the decidedly lesser psycho flick HITCHHIKE TO HELL. It was cool to find COED on disc so I could finally pitch my ratty old VHS, but I never in a million years thought I'd ever see this unusual and visually arresting film receive a full-blown remastering on high-def Blu-ray. Wow. Just ...wow.

THE BLU-RAY: This Blu-ray from Severin Films was on several mainstream reviewers' lists for best home video release of 2015. After getting a chance to sit down and watch both films a couple of times and go through the impressive amount of bonus content, I certainly can see why. This is one of the best rescues of forgotten cinema I've ever seen. The good people at Severin are to be lauded for their efforts to unearth these two forgotten gems and restore them to as close to ""premier screening"" quality as we're ever likely to see. Severin really went the distance with this terrific Blu-ray offering. First, the films themselves: they are in amazing shape here on this Blu. I had never seen AXE before but my DVD version of KIDNAPPED COED simply pales in comparison to this Blu-ray edition; a massive jump in both video & audio quality, plus it's properly framed now rather than in a crudely cropped pan & scan format. This is probably the nicest these flicks have ever looked. Solid picture, with minimal artifacting, pixelation or crush (video noise). Colors are robust and the blacks are solid & inky. Mid-tones are sturdy as well. Audio is level & strong. Both simply look & sound great. Some dirt & debris remain BUT so does good old film grain. Calmer heads must have prevailed at Severin's studio, as the technicians thankfully didn't go all gonzo with DNR/Digital Noise Reduction during the remastering process. Hooray!

Now the really exciting news. For fans of movies & movie making this hi-def release will entertain, inform & delight. First thing you'll want to do is screen the documentary ""At Last... Total Terror!"" This outstanding 65+ minute featurette tells the incredible true story of how naive young first-time director Frederick Friedel came to create his two films, the unfortunate chain of events that lead to them essentially being stolen from him, and the amazing 30+ years(!) later rediscovery, eventual reunion & happy ending that came about (also quite by chance). It's one of the most interesting documentary featurettes I've watched in my many years as a film fan & collector. Another brief piece features Stephen Thrower, author of the excellent reference tome Nightmare USA, discussing both films. Thrower's research for his book indirectly lead to the original elements for Friedel's films being discovered, secured & re-introduced by Severin Films. (Thank you Mr. Thrower!) The original theatrical trailers for both films are also included, along with TV & radio spots and a full-length audio commentary track for EACH film w/director Fred Friedel, producer Phil Smoot & makeup man/film crewman Worth Keeter, (now best-known as director of a slew of ""Power Rangers"" episodes!). The two commentary tracks are a lot of fun and very informative. Although these three guys had not seen each other in over three decades you can tell listening to them reminisce that they all have a fondness for the time spent making the films and obviously a love of the films themselves. The other big bonus on the Blu-ray is the combo film BLOOD BROTHERS, which has AXE & COED spliced together into one loose narrative, in which the two male leads (both played by Jack Canon) are now twin brothers who go on a rampage on the same day. It's the only thing I haven't watched yet, but will eventually. The last gimme is a separate CD of soundtrack music cues from both films along with other misc. cuts as well. All told, this is an exhaustive amount of primary & secondary content. You will really get your money's worth with this purchase! What pleasantly surprised me was that despite having near seven hours' worth(!) of material on one single-sided Blu-ray, neither film suffered from compression issues. This top notch, packed-to-the-gills Blu-ray of AXE & KIDNAPPED COED comes highly, highly recommended.",1452384000,11,7657,4.913446676970634
8737156,4,B016QVK6EG,"*I received a review copy of this set in return for an honest review

In all my years of film-watching (which total about thirty-five now), I had heard the name Frederick R. Friedel only a couple of times, usually in passing conversation.  Friends of friends had heard of his works or had seen them onscreen, but had no idea how to obtain them.  Ive always been curious about what the man had to offer; he was supposed to be a legendary auteur, of sorts.  Now, thanks to the fine folks at Severin Films and CAV Distribution, my curiosity has been satisfied, and the rest of the world can see the genius that is Frederick R. Friedel as well.

AXE and KIDNAPPED COED are presented in HD on a double feature Blu-ray that comes with a slew of Special Features and a CD of the original motion picture soundtracks.  If you are any kind of Grindhouse nostalgia lover or horror fan, this two-movie collection is a must have for your collection.

I enjoyed both films, however I have to admit AXE is my favorite between the two.  KIDNAPPED COED had a different sort of feel, more like a crime drama rather than horror.  AXE kept a foreboding tone throughout the whole film, and it constantly kept me on edge.

Both films are shot well, particularly when you consider Friedel was a new filmmaker around this time.  He manages to capture some interesting camera shots that help enhance the mood hes trying to create.  Likewise, he does a great job of capturing the casts emotional states onscreen as well.

And speaking of the casts, Friedel puts together a winning team for each film.  In AXE, viewers are treated to Leslie Lee, who portrays the enigmatic Lisa, and Jack Canon as the bastard Steele.  In KIDNAPPED COED, we get to see Jack Canon again, this time alongside the talented Leslie Rivers, who plays Sandra Morely.  Although these are lower budget pictures, Friedel does a great job of utilizing the talents of everybody onset.

The special effects are laughable, but only in that it is very obvious the production team uses red paint as blood.  The liquid is bright red and very fakebut I suppose it made a statement for its time.  Still, I think chocolate syrup might have achieved a more realistic feel.

Nevertheless, this AXE / KIDNAPPED COED double-feature is a real treat, and fans of grindhouse horror and exploitation films will want to snatch this up immediately.  In addition to the digital restorations, the Blu-ray contains a nice batch of Special Features, including:

* AXE feature, new 2k transfer from Original Negative
Audio Commentary with Writer/Director Frederick R. Friedel, Production Manager Philip Smoot, Makeup Artist Worth Keeter & PA Richard W. Helms

8737157,4,B016QVK6EG,"AXE: A Low budget, dark and gritty rural film about 3 criminals who murder and terrorize their way through the backwoods of the Carolina's and find themselves hiding from the police in an old isolated farmhouse where they meet Lisa, a young girl who lives alone with her paralyzed grandfather. She was young and beautiful. She was innocent and mysterious and She wielded an AXE. This is HER story of revenge and survival
For a low budget exploitation horror film, AXE really succeeds in creating a terrifying atmosphere for suspense and mystery. The horror and gore might be on the mild side, but when it appears, it's effective and rightfully disturbing. The acting ranges from raw talent to dreadful, but it seems to fit rather realistically in the backwood Carolina setting. Jack Cannon and Lesile Lee provide the strongest performances with Lisa being the true stand-out talent. It's sad that she gave up acting after only one film, her talent really shines bright in this forgotten classic.

Yes, this movie has a slow pace and feels rather drawn out at times, but it makes up for it in the clever photography and over-all story. It will never win any awards, but it's certainly worth the time spent for any true student of film and exploitation films of the late 70's.
NOTE OF INTEREST: This film was banned in the UK and labeled among the Video Nasties for several years before finally being released in it's complete uncut version. After viewing, one might wonder why it received such harsh treatment as it's content is rather tame.....but still very effective.",1445040000,8,1569,4.854477611940299
