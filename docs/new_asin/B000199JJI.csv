1980423,5,B000199JJI,"This is a mystery set in the 1930s and involves upper class people.  The plot is very complex an convoluted with plenty of red herrings. The style of directing and the music remind me of the Petherbridge dramatizations of Lord Peter Wimsey.  In the first half of the two hours the players ham it up and over play their parts.  It had the aura of Monty Python.  I could imagine the players snickering under their breath as they made their characters look like silly asses.  In the second half they are more dead serious as the dead bodies become more thickly strewn about.  In general, I prefer this one to the Periot and Miss Marple dramatizations.",1094256000,13,648,4.543103448275862

1980564,3,B000199JJI,"It's the 1920's. Breakfast is almost over at the Chimneys, a manor house in Sussex. Lady Coote is renting it, and her god-daughter is visiting with friends, as well as Rupert ""Pongo"" Bateman, her husband's secretary.  The only guest not up yet, at quarter to noon, is Gerry Wade, who does love his sleep-in. So all the youngsters, the 20-something flappers and ministry upstarts, decide to play a trick on Wade. They go into town and buy eight alarm clocks. That night, in the midst of the after-dinner cards and dancing, Bateman tells his boss, Sir Oswald: ""Good news from Swansea, Sir. The tests are conclusive. It works.""

The friends wait until Wade is asleep, and set all the alarm clocks in his bedroom, gleefully anticipating Wade's consternation in the morning. It's hard to believe, but in the morning, they're all assembled in the breakfast room and Wade has not come down. After eight alarm clocks going off in his room!  The butler, Tredwell, interrupts their breakfast, looking as put out as he ever has. They have found Mr. Wade. And the reason he didn't come down is that he's dead.

The renters return to London and Chimneys' owner, the Marquis of Caterhan and his daughter, the thoroughly modern Lady Eileen (aka ""Bundle"") return home. When Bundle realizes that Wade died in her bed, she determines to look into his death. Unbeknownst to her, some of the party have already started looking into it. Was the death connected to their ministry work? Or to Sir Oswald's secret tests?

""Seven Dials Mystery"" is a 1981 British made-for-TV movie. It is filmed on sets, not locations, The acting is campy, though that is deliberate. There is humor, especially from Sir John Gielgud's character, the Marquis. But, overall, for someone who loves Joan Hickson's ""Miss Marple"" and David Suchet's ""Poirot"", this movie seems almost a melodrama. I actually have it on DVD from way back when, purchased because it had the name ""Agatha Christie"" on the front. It is a very easy romp, as long as you don't expect it to be a serious mystery.

The prior year, 1980, they aired a longer and, in my mind, better Agatha Christie story:

1980566,5,B000199JJI,"Borrowed this movie from the library as a youth and loved it.  Got the book, and then got this DVD.  I'll admit that when I first watched it, I had no clue who the killer would end up being.  I was quite surprised, but it works.

After two young men die (one by an overdose, the other by being shot and hit by a car), a young noblewoman begins to investigate the mysterious ""Seven Dials"" that had been mentioned by both men just before their deaths.  Is it merely an underground nightclub in London, or is it something else entirely?  A near theft at a house party has many people asking ""Who done it?"" and several people almost pay the ultimate price to find out the answer.

As usual with a Christie production, setting, costumes, and characters are spot on for this time period.  Video quality might not be up to today's standards, but was probably the best possible given the age of the source video material.  Not a significant deterrent to enjoying this movie.",1424822400,2,966,4.474285714285714

1980570,3,B000199JJI,"The Seven Dials Mystery is one of my favorite Agatha Christie stories, but I was disappointed by this adaptation. On the positive side, it stays true to the story and features good acting by John Gielgud as the Marquis of Caterham and Harry Andrews as Superintendent Battle. This story focuses as much on character development (even minor characters) as plot, and the Marquis is a funny, quirky character, as is Lady Oswald Coote, played completely different than written by Joyce Redman.

On the negative side, this is another cheap production, similar to Partners In Crime, The Agatha Christie Hour, and the Joan Hickson Miss Marple movies. The indoor lighting is horrible and glaring, like a cheap theater production. It clashes with the old English houses in which the story takes place. The switch from videotape to film when transitioning from indoors to outdoors is painfully obvious, and disturbs the continuity. James Warwick was cast once too often as the ""leading man"" in a Christie story, and his performances are pretty much all the same. The makeup/hair stylist department made no effort to make the men in this production look like they belonged in the 1920s. In every production he's in, Warwick has the same obvious 80s haircut. The women are caked with horrible, cliched 80s makeup, including a lot of blue over the eyelids. These may be small points, but they are what separate good Christie adaptations, like David Suchet's Poirot and Geraldine McEwan's Miss Marple, from mediocre ones like the Seven Dials Mystery.

Overall, it's worth watching to see Gielgud and the faithful story adaptation, and the negative points tend to diminish after the first viewing.",1412121600,2,1681,5.064981949458484

1980615,3,B000199JJI,"""Seven Dials Mystery"" was adapted from the 1929 novel of the same name by Agatha Christie. This adaptation was made in 1981 for London Weekend Television. A group of men who work for the Foreign Office are vacationing with their friend Jimmy Thesiger (James Warwick) at Chimneys, a country estate owned by the Marquess of Caterham (John Gielgud). Among them is Gerry Wade (Robert Longden), whom they tease for sleeping in very late. Ronnie Devereux (John Vine) and Jimmy arrange to place 8 alarm clocks in Gerry's room as a joke. Gerry still fails to get up the next morning...because he has died in his sleep of an apparent overdose of sleeping medication. Ronnie suspects foul play and promises Gerry's comely sister Lorraine (Lucy Gutteridge) that he will find the killer. Meanwhile, Lady Eileen ""Bundle"" Brent (Cheryl Campbell), in whose bedroom Gerry was staying, has found a letter addressed to Lorraine that mentions the ""Seven Dials"", and she's determined to understand what it means.

This adaptation is reputed to be very faithful to the book. Indeed, it contains a lot of extraneous dialogue and scenes that a tighter, wiser editor would have relegated to the cutting room floor. The production values are pretty low, and the film has a ""stagey"" quality. This was made after ""Why Didn't They Ask Evans?"" (1980) for London Weekend Television, but ""Seven Dials  Mystery"" is less polished. The cast seems well-suited except for the heroine Lady Eileen, who is campy in all the right places but too shrill and wide-eyed to be tolerable. Much of the problem stems from the fact that Cheryl Campbell was too old for the role of a bubbly, intrepid young aristocrat. It strikes me as odd that the this novel would have been chosen for a television production, as the mystery is implausible and silly even by Agatha Christie standards and not very interesting. I found the first hour or so a bit dull, but the pace did pick up. The transfer on the Acorn 2004 DVD is poor. Some scenes are grainy, and my disk has light pink and green bands running across some frames.",1403136000,,2068,4.806179775280899
1980616,5,B000199JJI,"In excellent condition.  Received quickly.  Well done and true to book.  So grateful that no scenes were cut!  In future, I'm going to try to stick to Acorn Media/Granada film producers.  They seem to be the only ones who stay pretty true to the book and don't cut scenes.  Amazon, please make it clear who the producers and film makers are!  Some of the versions on the market are so far from the original story, one would not recognize it!  I am going to start returning movies that are not what was advertised.",1399075200,,513,4.440860215053763
1980617,3,B000199JJI,"Published in 1929, THE SEVEN DIALS MYSTERY begins with a house party of ""bright young things"" in the country.  When one of their number is habitually late for breakfast, the others play a prank on him: they purchase eight alarm clocks, set them to go off at intervals, and have them placed in his room.  They are amazed when the alarms have no effect on the sleeper--and then, to their horror, find their friend is dead from an overdose of chloral.  Curiously, the clocks that were placed around the room have all been set on the fireplace mantel, and instead of eight there is only seven.  When Lady Eileen Brent (known to her friends as ""Bundle"") becomes involved, she soon uncovers several references to ""seven dials.""  But what does it mean?

From time to time Agatha Christie (1890-1976) tired of writing the complex murder mysteries for which she was so famous.  By way of a change, she would turn to a type of novel that might best be described as a sort of romantic thriller, with THE SECRET ADVERSARY and WHY DIDN'T THEY ASK EVANS perhaps the most famous of these.  Christie herself described THE SEVEN DIALS MYSTERY as ""light hearted"" and commented that she found it easy to write.  Unfortunately, 1981 BBC adaptation manages to miss the light hearted quality Christie intended, and while there enjoyable moments here and there--most particularly John Gielgud as Marquess of Caterham and Cheryl Campbell as Bundle--but it feels leaden and slow, and for once the period charm that frequently adorns adaptations of Christie novels is largely missing.  You'll want to see it if you are Christie fan, but it is not especially memorable.

1980620,4,B000199JJI,"Another televised version of an Agatha Christie book I'd never heard of before this.  The story is fascinating enough to hold one's interest for 133 minutes.  The transfer is pitiful but not to the point that it can't be easily forgotten once you've become fully engaged with the story.  The plot involves a great deal of hidden meaning, which remains hidden until the big reveal.  There weren't many clues to follow but a lot of suspicious people to take into consideration (all false leads, laid on a bit thick).  Two murders, several failed attempts at the same, and a preposterous villain, matched every step of the way by a bizarre amateur sleuth: Cheryl Campbell as Lady Eileen Brent (or Bundle).  Campbell's performance just fell short of slapstick.  She played Bundle as an overcharged dizzy dame given to dashing about, poking her nose into everything.  When she wasn't giddy she was jittery with anticipation, like a madcap bird searching for prey, desperate to be in charge, never once doubting her ability to solve the crimes at hand.  (She didn't, but it wasn't from want of trying!)  The best feature of this movie was the performance by John Gielgud as Bundle's dotty dad (with an undeserved passion for golf).  Plenty of humor, some intrigue, and decent performances by most, make this an enjoyable experience.

This one I'm keeping in my Agatha Christie collection to watch again.",1368921600,2,1397,4.923076923076923

1980667,4,B000199JJI,"Less serious than ""Why Didn't They Ask Evans?"", this full-length filmed version of the Seven Dials Mystery fits neatly along the shelf with the Tommy & Tuppence series. Twenties styles and Gay Young Things men and women, supported by idiosyncratic old codgers, are the hallmarks of these Wodehousian look-a-likes (though inferior to that Master of Humor and to the written Christie originals). Nonetheless, as a great fan of Wodehouse and Christies and of the better adaptations for film of their works, I still found the atmosphere and performances entertaining, although quite lightweight in character. One reviewer put it aptly in mentioning the aura of the stage play about it; however, I saw that as a winning feature for the production rather than a defect. The stage does whimsy so much better than the inherent realism of the screen permits.
At any rate, I should think Christie fans will want to see this airy version, while the general viewer, in the mood for totally unrealistic farce, will have a good time with it.",1340323200,,1027,4.976744186046512

Gerry Wade (Robert Longden) seems to be a late sleeper it makes one thing that he may be dead when the story starts. Well his friends with the help of an extraordinarily smart Rupert 'Pongo' Bateman (James Griffiths) bring in eight alarm clocks to help Gerry wake up. Looks like they may have been a tad late with their scheme.

People are starting to die. Marquis of Caterhan (John Gielgud) wants to know why his daughter Lady Eileen 'Bundle' Brent (Cheryl Campbell) ran over a man Ronny Devereux (John Vine) and shot him. As the man is dying he mentions ""the seven Dials"" and Jimmy Thesiger (James Warwick). She assumes that she is meant to tell Jimmy of the something or someone called the seven dials. From there the plot thickens.

The seven dials theme plays through the whole story. We see it in clocks and clock towers; it turns up on paper and dieing breath. Is it a location or a cabal and does it really have something to do with the mystery?

As with many of Agatha Christies stories there are so many characters that you need a score card. Also there seems to be plots inside plots. Everyone could have done it and yet it is always the last person you suspect; or should I say usually the last person you would suspect. The film was adapted from the Novel by Pat Sandys, has the added benefit of the feeling that it is a play.

The film is packed with well known British actors and sometimes it is hard not to think now where have I seen this person before. Noticeably absent is Francesca Annis, yet the main female character player Cheryl Campbell is well remembers for her role in The Murder at the Vicarage (1986).

Woodhouse is welcome, if surprising, considering all the murders taking place in the film. So the tone jumps around, too. Not familiar with this Christie work, but suspect is very early effort in her vast canon. Far inferior, of course, to recent film version 'And Then There Were None,' also available on Amazon Prime.  Was fun to see John Gielgud in fine form, in a small role -- he lighted up the screen every time he appeared!",1484697600,,564,4.744897959183674
