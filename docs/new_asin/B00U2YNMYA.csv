7028214,5,B00U2YNMYA,"As of now, Raiders Of The Lost Shark has a one star rating. However, my review will change that. The other reviewer mentioned the bad acting, but this is a low-budget B-movie. I thought this movie was good, campy fun and I laughed more while watching it than I did while watching Sharknado. My five star rating might be too generous because at no point did I think to myself that I was watching a great movie.

It's a movie that was not at all worth the time spent watching it, even though most of it was boredom. The cover has more effort put into it than any point in the actual movie, and the CGI was so bad they literally used a hand puppet at one point and it thematically fit.

Great movie to put on in the background while doing other things. When you get distracted and want to watch the movie for a bit, you'll watch it for a few seconds and immediately go back to whatever else you were doing.",1475452800,3,660,3.925373134328358

There is nothing worth watching in this mess.  I don't think anyone in it could actually be called an actor.  The shark was pathetic and stupid.  This looks like someone watched a video of how to make a movie, bought a video camera from a pawn shop and rounded up a few people out on the street as some of the characters.  The other main characters are like rejects as actors from porn movie.  This just stinks.  I keep thinking I've seen the worst movie possible but then here comes another to top the list.

Think of this as an Asylum film without the budget or talent. Starting with an extremely unappealing double date and the first encounter with the shark, you think the film has to improve but you would be wrong. The film then goes into a protracted backstory about Professor Carly Reynolds (Candice Lidstone), whose college class is not well-attended (but, hey, it's Friday!), and a confusing flashback about why she's scarred for life. Clearly The Dragon Lady (Catherine Mary Clark, who's in the running for worst performance ever in a shark movie), who controls the island, must be to blame. The Dragon Lady, who is also known as Janet, wants Carly's help on her island to kill an allegedly prehistoric shark, but there are lots of pesky strings attached. Words cannot express how wooden Clark's performance is.

There's a pointless subplot about an uptight lazy sheriff (Lawrence Evenchick) and his comic relief deputy doing nothing to assist anyone ever, and a deeply disturbing performance by Scott McClelland as a boat captain (""This isn't my hand!"") The most annoying part of the movie is in French with subtitles, and if you wonder why it's annoying, you'll just have to watch it and then thank the non-acting of Faith Rayah. While all that is padding the running time, Carly and Janet go to the absolutely hilarious super-secret world headquarters of Dragon Lady Enterprises (or whatever it's called) where, via amazing surveillance footage, Carly spots her students on the boat to Shark Island, although later there is a confusing point of contention that it's actually a peninsula. Why? Who knows? Carly knows that she has to get to the island to save her students and they take Janet's plane (which is never seen) while all but one of her students become shark chow. Do not miss the riveting scene where the boat captain asks the students ""Anybody want a bag of complimentary nuts?"" Speaking of nuts, you may well be driven nuts when you hear the captain's rousing version of ""1,000 Bottles of Beer on the Boat"". Don't say I didn't warn you. I particularly like the scene of the students stopping to make a cellphone call while swimming away from a shark in the lake. Fortunately the one student who makes it to shore turns out to be a shark hunting genius.

Because of some crazy experiments the shark on this peninsula is able to fly. And it's radioactive. And it is remote controlled by what appears to be a garage door opener. While an idiotic flashback explains more of Carly's background, the special effects are less than reinforcing when it comes to the horror of losing your sister to a prehistoric, flying, radioactive, remote controlled shark. On the island they meet a mad scientist (No way!) named Dr. Howell, played by Richard Groen, which is appropriate as his performance will definitely make you groan. After the shark brings down Janet's plane, there's an odd confrontation leading Janet to proclaim ""I own the island, but I've never been her before!"" What? This all leads to an unimaginable double-cross (don't ask), more inaction from the laziest sheriff ever, and a dramatic conclusion that will not surprise or delight you in any way.

While ""Raiders of the Lost Shark"" has one of the best (if not the best) title of any B-grade shark movie in history, it is undone by its terrible production values, acting, and script. Even though I know this movie is a tongue-in-cheek effort and not to be taken seriously (at least I sure hope so), it's hard to enjoy even for camp value. As a bonus, there are some trailers for other films on the DVD, and while some of them look promising for fans of trash cinema, others just look like fresh pain.",1440028800,14,3974,4.731601731601732

7028371,1,B00U2YNMYA,"Ive seen worse movies than Raiders of the Lost Shark  but not many, and not in a pretty long time.  The only creativity and actual thinking that seems to lie behind this wretched film is limited to the title.  Man oh man, this is a stinker.  True fans of bad movies might relish the excruciating experience in a twisted kind of way, but I fear that even the short seventy-one minute runtime will be much too much for the average mainstream viewer to possibly stomach.  And don't go getting overconfident two-thirds of the way through this thing because that is when the film really  and I do apologize for this  jumps the shark.  I don't think the person who wrote the movie summary even watched the film because the summary really isn't very accurate.  The cover image definitely has no relation to the actual film.

We start with an abandoned lake being guarded around the clock by pairs of true yokels.  Why would you need to guard an abandoned lake?  Well, these yokels find out.  Then we go to a professor telling her class of four whole students about megalodons while pausing to experience flashbacks of her own terrible experience on the island (which isn't even an island).  Learning the story, three of her students naturally decide to check the place out for themselves.  Meanwhile, the owner of the lake property comes calling our professor for help.  Throw in a sailor channeling Blackbeard, a mad scientist, and the absolutely worst shark special effects you will ever see in your life, and you're left shaking your head in disbelief, partly just to make sure you still have a brain left to rattle around above your eyes.  And the sheriff?  Oh, good lord.

Apart from the entertainment factor inherent in its pure and utter awfulness, there is nothing good about this film.  When I say that bad movie lovers might get a kick out of watching it, I do not mean that in a so bad its funny kind of way  more like an I watched Raiders of the Lost Shark and lived to tell about it kind of way.  This one definitely earns a notch in any bad movie lovers belt.",1438560000,5,2066,4.527027027027027

The acting and special effects are bad by design and budget. Think ""Sharknado"" with only one shark and no ""nado""
