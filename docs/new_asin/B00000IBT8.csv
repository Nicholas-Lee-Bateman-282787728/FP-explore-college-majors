7909788,4,B00000IBT8,Wery good to see local trains with local people. Music can take off the film.,1169769600,,77,4.2
7909789,3,B00000IBT8,"This is a harmless, pleasant video showing a lot of southern Asia.  The best thing about it is probably the children.  The Travel the World by Train series shows us lots of adorable little kids of different countries.",1142812800,,217,4.684210526315789
7909790,4,B00000IBT8,"Like all the TWBT DVD's (there are 10) this one has excellent video quality - sharp, good color, professional narration - but it really tries to cover too much ground in an hour. You get a glance of the train station, a few shots of the passengers and a scenic view or two from the moving train, and then you are at the next location, maybe with a shot or two of a few famous sights. There is NO ""railfan"" data about the types of locomotives, rolling stock, etc. Overall, I believe you do get your money's worth but look elswhere for in-depth coverage of the countries visited or the details of train operation.",1064275200,8,611,4.368421052631579
