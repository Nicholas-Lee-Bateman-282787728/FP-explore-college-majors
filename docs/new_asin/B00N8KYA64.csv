6614003,4,B00N8KYA64,"I decided to watch this film for a comparison piece against several other Western WW2 films for a graduate class. This was the film I chose for the Japanese perspective and I am glad I did! A lot of commentary has been made about this film being pro-right wing or pro-kamikaze or even supportive of Japan's nationalistic image and their ""victim"" perspective of their place within World War Two that many other countries accuse them of (specifically, not representing their position within the war properly with war crimes, etc.).

However, this film is nothing of the sort. Despite its premise (and its novel form) originally written by a far right-wing nationalist and friend of the Prime Minister of Japan, this film prefers to focus on a 26 year old and his sister learning that their grandfather is not actually related to them by blood, and that their true blood-related grandfather died as a Special Attack Force pilot in the final days of 1945. While the film does some rather high-budget battles scenes, including Pearl Harbour, the Battle of Midway, and several aerial battles, most of the time the ""enemy"" is none other than the internal struggles of the pilots and their position within the Japanese army and their dwindling numbers as their superior commanding officers begin to implement more and more drastic techniques and plans to win the war or go down fighting.

Particularly, the film follows how Miyabe (their grandfather) is considered a coward by his fellow pilots because of his beliefs and thoughts on being a) a perfectionist and b) not wanting to die, and by extension, his fellow pilots to die because he feels that they can benefit Japan's uncertain future and help reshape their country into something they could be proud of. It's only when the grandson and granddaughter find two colleagues of their grandfathers who had a much higher opinion of Miyabe that their perspective of their grandfather changes and they begin to understand the deep emotion instability the war caused within him, especially as it progressed and Miyabe saw friends of his die in front of him.

I know that many will find this film hard to watch because it's not American, or an Allied Forces film that shows how the ""good guys"" won and that Germany and Japan were the enemies - in fact, there is only one scene in ""Eien no Zero"" that shows the American forces they fight, and even then, it's extremely complimentary. This film is not pro-Japan, pro-war, or anything -- it is a film about how war tears people down psychologically, and how important it is to be able to move on and make an impact on the world if you want to change it.

I strongly suggest that people give this film a chance, and realise that when it comes to war, there are no winners -- just people in terrible, desperate situations who try to do their best for their countries, their beliefs, and their families.",1416614400,31,2887,4.768
6614004,5,B00N8KYA64,"The Eien no zero is well made movie.  Traditionally, the Japanese war movie was dwelled into self-pity from the war guilt.  But this movie was successfully beyond this mold.  It is worthy to watch,",1416528000,2,197,4.735294117647059
6614005,4,B00N8KYA64,"To begin, I am a Sansei with limited, if not crippled Japanese language skills. The story line is a real stretch, considering the time line, 1941-42 to present day with surviving and non-demented aviators recounting their Pacific experiences. On a historic note, the two major actions depicted are quite accurate and the CGI is light years ahead of such Toho epics as 'I Bombed Pearl Harbor' and Toshiro Mifune's 'Admiral Yamamoto'. The carrier Akagi is the focus of the early campaigns and the depiction of her fatal damage at Midway is very accurate, confirming eye-witness accounts from both sides. Additionally, the Zero aircraft depicted are accurate, down to the cockpit instrumentation and mid-late war landing gear modifications. Someone on the film really did their research, although I admit that my knowledge of such details is clear evidence that I spent too much of my youth making models and reading books about the Pacific War.",1414540800,4,942,5.123376623376624
6614006,5,B00N8KYA64,"This is one of the most powerful movies I have watched in a long time. It is a sensitive look at intergenerational connections-- the power of love-- the power of relationships. The reviewer who panned this movie wishing he/she could have the two hours back obviously didn't get the subtilities of a really excellent movie -- well written-- and well produced.
I believe this movie repesents the potential of what effective and long lasting movies can do.. Of coures, there were not Marvel Comic Book characters--  worlds blowing up -- or extended sex scenes so some reviewers will find it boring and banal..

If however, you are after a touching and meaningful movie experience-- please check this out.",1414281600,6,701,4.932203389830509
6614007,1,B00N8KYA64,"I would give this movie zero stars but I don't think that's an option.
It's not just the acting that sucks---it's a truncated storyline, contradictory messages about protecting family, the value of human life, and killing people.  It's also a nostalgic look at the second world war that portrays Japan as a victim not an aggressor. Well, that's what we would expect from the power hungry nationalist ass that is the author of the book that this film is based on. No wonder he and Prime Minister Abe get along so well.
The movie gets points for having one kamikaze survivor discuss what a pointless and idiotic strategy it was to send young men to their death---and how it was tremendously ineffective. You do get a glimpse of Japan's war mentality at the time.
However, the final scene---which I won't spoil for you---seems to contradict any positive message the film might have had and left me feeling like: WTF?",1409702400,11,913,4.7421383647798745
6614008,5,B00N8KYA64,what a fantastic view of the importance of life as the grand kids try to find out more about their grandfather that was supposedly a coward for wanting to live so bad when the Japanese government was forcing pilots to end their lives for the good sake of honor and country. a magnificent love story in an age of the greatest of all wars!,1444953600,2,337,4.28125

6614010,5,B00N8KYA64,"A very good WWII movie that put Michael Bay's poorly made Pearl Harbor to shame.
With their limited resources, the Japanese movie makers sure know how to make great WWII movies.
This movie is by no means glorifying Imperial Japanese aggression during the second world war, but more about remembering and honoring those who made the ultimate sacrifice following orders and also their families.
I will recommend this movie to all rational minded viewers.",1437523200,4,452,5.121621621621622
6614011,4,B00N8KYA64,"Good story, and having looked into two uncles. One WW2 the other in Korea, Great computer graphics",1434499200,,98,4.823529411764706
6614012,5,B00N8KYA64,"I am a wounded combat veteran myself (of a much later war, and one equally as futile as this one was for the Japanese).  I mention this because it likely colors my views on such films.  I did not find this movie to be overly long, as at least one other reviewer had noted it as being, but my fairly unique background causes me to be quite patient, and little in need of violent excitement.

This movie was very sensitively written, heart-wrenching, tear-jerking, and absolutely superb in all respects.  I highly recommend it.

But having written this, as other reviewers have noted, it is true that this film does leave two issues unresolved: 1. Japan's responsibility for initiating what all other countries on the Pacific rim consider to have been an unprovoked war of aggression; and 2. Japan's long-continued honoring of convicted and executed war criminals found responsible for indisputably heinous acts or decisions. And it is also clearly true that this film will not help the Japanese to accept that their countrymen were responsible for very well documented massacres, genocide, torture and execution of POWs, Unit 731's always-lethal medical experimentation (including vivisection) on non-Japanese captives, and many instances of the most grotesque racism - issues at the forefront of current Korean and Chinese concerns/anger.  Unfortunately, the film will no doubt encourage some Japanese to continue an attitude of victimization instead of accepting that their forebears were the enthusaistic perpetrators of this genocidal racism. This film ennobles that same military.  So, while the film itself is quite fine, it may encourage an unhealthy perspective: Japan's dodging of responsibility for widespread war crimes, long before any ""tit-for-tat"" response of the targeted populations had occured, and hence completely unprovoked.

Should the film be judged for its failure to address all pertinent issues, though?  I recommend the film - but I also recommend that viewers gain a perspective of the valid concerns of Japan's millions of victims or their surviving relatives.  Japan has a substantial moral debt, and this cannot be safely ignored; history cannot be ""whitewashed"" w/o, at the very least, political consequences, if not retaliatory violence from its victimized neighbors.

This is one of the finest movies that I've seen.  The filmmakers were most brilliant!",1429920000,12,2385,5.347593582887701

6614016,5,B00N8KYA64,"As a grandfather and retired military, I found this film very touching.  The story of the two adult grandchildren who search for the truth about their Kamikaze grandfather's service during WWII communicates the eternal tie of family bonds in all cultures.  It painfully portrays the impact of the conflict between love of country and love of family. This film courageously challenges the Japanese culture's WWII ""die-for-the-emperor"" warrior code.  As an aviation enthusiasts I appreciated the air battles which are skillfully computer generated.  The A6M series of fighter planes and their accurate color schemes will please scale modelers.  This is a beautifully crafted film which makes us think of important things in life.  Especially today, December 7th.",1417910400,17,760,5.508620689655173
6614017,5,B00N8KYA64,"It's a shame that the one star reviewer who wants his precious 2 hours back and the pompous 'Variety' propaganda blurb which he invokes to back him up in his comments can't appreciate the subtleties and beauty of this excellent movie, and both not just seeing it through their own biased nationalistic perceptions. It shouldn't strike anyone as ""portraying Japan as a victim and not an aggressor"" at all. It definitely does portray that all human beings caught up in a vicious war of any kind are all victims, regardless of nationality. And it definitely depicts the total insanity of the kamikaze strategy as sheer madness, futility and murder, as voiced by several of the characters in the movie.

Because the Allies (the good guys) fought the Japanese (the bad guys), reviewers like those mentioned above that have been brought up on John Wayne type Hollywood brainwashing have to instantly see any Japanese attempt to portray their own human feelings and sufferings as not worthy and something to be dismissed merely as Jap propaganda. They are the Japs, the bad guys, after all, so there's no need to say any more about them, is there?

The title Eternal Zero is not just referring to the name of the Zero fighter, but rather immediately tells us that the eternal 'O' powerfully symbolises the continuity of all life  an 'O', without beginning or end  another subtle and profound recurring theme which is prominent throughout the film. From this perspective, the final scene that bothers above lone-star and Variety so much really does give you something to ponder. All said, 'Zero' should be seen as a profound Japanese anti-war film.

This is a moving, well-told story with interesting plot surprises, beautifully-filmed with masterful CGI that is actually a pleasure to watch, and is above all, a very humane movie.
Beautiful, moving and poignant...this film deserves to be seen.",1416873600,10,1887,4.977777777777778
8676581,5,B00N8KYA64,"This is one of my favorite air combat movies. Great story and great visuals. The flying sequences are relatively restrained and aircraft speed is realistically portrayed, unlike in Hollywood movies. My only complaint is the unrealistic flying physics in some aspects of flight, such as turns and formation flying, but such flaws are common in Hollywood movies too.",1526515200,,364,5.293103448275862
8676582,5,B00N8KYA64,"Great film about a kamikaze pilot trainer who ultimately joins the wothless sacrifice out of solidarity and dispair.

8676583,5,B00N8KYA64,"This is a pretty good movie. Its way better than the crappy ""Pearl Harbor"" re-make. Has a ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" feel to it.
