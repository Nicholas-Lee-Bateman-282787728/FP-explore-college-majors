2759613,5,B000N6UF1A,F Troop is a good mix of history and the U.S. military of old. In other words a true dipiction of how the west was fun.,1203206400,,119,3.6153846153846154
2759614,5,B000N6UF1A,Fns of the show from the 60's will love to remember it and anyone looking for something funny and non PC will love this. The quality of the acting and writing is high and because there were only 2 series made it doesn't wear out its welcome. Fun for all ages. The indians weren't real indians but hey the cowboys weren't real cowboys either! They were all real comedians though!,1189814400,,378,4.414285714285715
2759615,5,B000N6UF1A,"The show is funny but it is $10 cheaper to buy seasons 1 and 2 separately. What is the advantage of buying this complete set?  Anyway F Troop was hilarious and Jane was cute.  Way ahead of the great comedy Blazing Saddles.  Don Rickles as Bald Eagle is worth the first season alone.  Many episodes showcase great comdic actors like Harvey Korman as a German officer introducing balloning to the American Cavalry.  If you are young look for reruns, then you will want the DVDs.",1189555200,5,476,4.552941176470588
2759616,4,B000N6UF1A,"My husband and I, with friends, recently rode on motorbikes from Albany Western Australia to Tasmania and back.  We saw so many places and covered over 10200 kilometres and often couldn't remember just where we had been or where we were.  Trudy, one of our fellow riders joked and said we were like the 'Heckarwe' American indian tribe from F-Troop who took their name from being similarly lost and saying to each other ""Where the heck are we"".  Of course, we all fell about laughing, and from that moment on, the Heckarwe featured frequently in our travels.
We reminisced about enjoying F-Troop nearly 40 years ago.  On our return, I investigated buying some DVD's of the show.  Couldn't find any available in Australia, so tried Amazon, and voila! there they were.  Being impulsive I ordered the complete First Two Seasons package.  I then had some reservations about my actions as I had found that shows much enjoyed when I was younger somehow, never lived up to the memories and seemed quite tame and silly when viewed many years later.
Anyway, the arrival of the F Troop DVD's was eagerly anticipated.  Hooray! They were just as funny.  I sat there laughing as much as I had when I first saw them.  The humour was still good and I found the gentle, totally un-violent F Troop a refreshing change from some of the shows being produced nowadays.  I fully recommend a trip down memory lane with Capt. Parmenter, Sgt. O'Rourke and Corp. Agarn.  Great stuff.",1187827200,34,1458,4.719367588932807
2759617,5,B000N6UF1A,"F-Troop is one of the most hilarious shows i have ever watched! I watched the entire first season in one night. I almost laughed myself silly! If you love a good laugh, F-troop the first two seasons is a must have for comedy lovers and for people who want to relive their youth. This show is suitable for all ages.",1183507200,10,314,4.25

Neither side wants a confrontation, and in fact they are co-existing just fine with their various business deals and other arrangements.  The characterizations are broad and the comedy slapstick and I defy you not to laugh when you watch it.  The show was on for two years (the first year in black and white).

2759702,4,B000N6UF1A,"FTroop is one of those classic old comedies which are actually funny because they're so ridiculous.

Overheard by nearby cavalry and F-troop's leader responds - You're the Heckawi?  We're the settlers!) relic from my childhood.  This running spoof of frontier westerns would be worth owning and viewing if only for Paul Lynde as the Singing Mountie,  Wrangler Jane and Corporal Egarn's many, many cousins (all roles played by Larry Storch).  Add in the satirical parody of our commercialism and the less than stellar treatment of native Americans  (O'Rourke's various enterprises) and it is all in fun, lighthearted and without many socially redeeming qualities.

It's amazing that these are only 2 seasons. In todays times, with cable sitcom standards of 13 episodes per season; this show would have run for 4-5 years. 39 shows per season... Holy crap batman! I finally feel like i got my money's worth on a DVD package. The writing is slick and to the point; the acting is fast and professional, and Wrangler Jane is still my favorite 60's sitcom girl.

The show has a lot of good clean laughs, such as Hakawi Chief Wild Eagle mentioning something about the law and saying , ""me sue.  Wait a minute, me no Sioux, me Hakawi.  Wild Eagle make funny"".

So, for those who want to re-kindle their younger days or for those who want to discover good no obscenity humour I commend 'F Troop'.  Larry STORCH as Cpl AGARN is a show stealer among his fellows and very funny.

Series 1 has six disks { try saying that without your teeth in } in B/W and series II is in colour.  Its worth the cost.

LARRY ""CORPORAL AGARN"" STORCH, lovable ham that he was, stole every scene he was ever in (except maybe the ones with the hilariously chicken-hearted Heckowi Indians). KEN BERRY's naive, klutzy CAPTAIN PARMENTER was no match for MELODY PATTERSON's rawhide-wrapped sexpot WRANGLER JANE, and FORREST TUCKER held it all together with rugged con man charm as SGT. O'ROURKE. Even the second bananas, from tone-deaf bugler DOBBS and myopic VANDERBILT to Alamo veteran ratchet-jaw DUFFY added much to the merry mix. That's not even counting the roster of kitschy guest stars, including PAT HARRINGTON (as B. WISE, a takeoff on GET SMART), DON RICKLES, HARVEY KORMAN, JULIE NEWMAR, PHIL HARRIS, MILTON BERLE, VINCENT PRICE, LEE MERIWETHER, HENRY GIBSON and many more semi-legends. Broad slapstick, poorly aimed cannons, and slapstick mayhem were the rule, not the exception at FORT COURAGE...whoever said ""War is hell"" probably never saw F TROOP!

But fortune fovors the stupid, and both sides are far too cowardly and inept to actually do any harm to one another except by

With 6 disks per season, you are able to choose around if you want and also you can choose what episodes per disk you you like to watch.

2759744,4,B000N6UF1A,"A concern with this F TROOP set: My copy of Season 1 had TWO defective DVDs out of six! This May 2008 repackaging includes all 12 discs as originally issued. Let's hope Warner's quality control has improved since '06.

F TROOP aired 65 half-hour episodes between 9/14/65 and 4/5/67. Only the show's second season is in color. Also, things really picked up steam part way through the first year, with Season Two having the lion's share of ""classic"" episodes. Primary cast was Forrest Tucker as Sgt. Morgan O'Rourke, stand-up comic Larry Storch as Cpl. Randolph Agarn, dancer Ken Berry as Capt. Wilton Parmenter, and 17-year-old (at time of premiere) Melody Patterson as Wrangler Jane Angelica Thrift.

Other series regulars: Frank DeKova as Chief Wild Eagle, James Hampton as bugler Hannibal Dobbs, former cowboy star Bob Steele as Trooper Duffy, Joe Brooks as near-sighted Trooper Vanderbilt, Ivan Bell as Duddleson, John Mitchum as Hoffenmueller, Don Diamond as Crazy Cat, Ben Frommer as Smokey Bear and (for six season 1 episodes) Edward Everett Horton as medicine man Roaring Eagle.

SYNOPSIS--
Wilton Parmenter receives a medal and promotion to captain after inadvertantly winning a Civil War battle with a sneeze. Parmenter is then sent west to command the most inept bunch of soldiers ever. Fort Courage's bugler can't play anything but a bad Yankee Doodle, their lookout is practically blind and Parmenter's sergeant and corporal have a thriving business with the local tribe, the Hikawis, who manufacture souvenirs and moonshine for them. Chief Wild Eagle's second-in-command, Crazy Cat clearly wants the top job while tribal elder Roaring Chicken is well into senility. Parmenter himself is quite the opposite-- a babe in the woods who often bungles things up and trips all over himself. None of this clumsiness deters trading post owner Calamity Jane-- she practically throws herself at ""Wilton"" whenever she can.

2759745,5,B000N6UF1A,F Troop's cast compliment eachother completely to produce an Old West comedy that the whole family can enjoy.  My only disappontment was that the series only aired two seasons.,1238371200,,176,5.068965517241379

2759747,5,B000N6UF1A,"There are positive messages in these fine shows underneath all the wonderful foolishness.

For one thing, the power of kindness. Everybody is kind to one another. Captain Parmenter is kind to all of his men, including the lowest ranks. He's kind to the town drunk and to the gunfighter who wants to kill him. He even tames the angry renegade Bald Eagle with kindness. In turn, O'Rourke, Agarn, and Dobbs are always kind to him (""Are you all right, sir?"") and his men watch out for him.

Parmenter is brave. He always leads the charge and faces every problem. He does his duty and pushes the others to do theirs. He tries to do the right thing. He keeps going, no matter what happens. And he *does* succeed in his job of keeping the peace in the area. (He just doesn't understand why.)

Wild Eagle doesn't kowtow to the white men. They come to him for help and advice. He keeps the pressure up on O'Rourke and outsmarts him regularly. The chief uses his intelligence, shrewdness, and drive for the good of the people he leads. He, too, is successful... his tribe is prosperous and at peace.

O'Rourke's crooked schemes fail, his noncom club warehouse regularly going up in flames. However, his kindly schemes succeed.

Lots of messages in this show.",1211846400,,1248,4.6289592760181

8175433,5,B000N6UF1A,"I recently purchased the F Troop Seasons 1 and 2 DVD set.  F Troop's humor seems to translate well to today's tastes, at least it does to mine, and doesn't seem dated at all.  It is an inherently funny show, and never makes you grimace in embarrassment for the show's actors.

What really made F Troop a great show was the cast:  every one of which was a valuable contributing asset.  Forrest Tucker (as Sargeant O'Roark), while essentially the straight man, I really like the way he carries himself.  He was a true professional at his craft, and had the exact  demeanor of a calvary sargeant, and boy can he ride a horse.  I didn't think all that much of Larry Storch (as Corporal Agarn) when the show originally was broadcast, but now I realize just how talented he was.  No wonder they wrote all those different character parts for him to play.  Ken Berry's (as Captain Parmenter) pratfalls are often amazing to watch.  How he avoided getting hurt on occasion while being so doggone funny is amazing.  (Maybe he did.)  Melody Patterson (as Wrangler Jane) sure rides a horse well, and really contributed to Parmenter's ill-at-easeness (is that a word?).  She was perfect in her role.  James Hampton (as Bugler Private Dobbs) is one of those persons who is naturally funny, even when he's just standing there.  Frank de Kova (as Chief Wild Eagle of the Hekawis) was something else.  Hard to imagine the series without his hilarious antics.  Getting kind of long winded here, but the remaining few cast members each contributed immensely to the overall quality of the show.  There's not one poor perfomer in the bunch.

Some comedy shows from the 1960s have kind of sunk over the years and seem dated, but F Troop stands tall and proud and funny as hell.",1521072000,,1754,4.651465798045603
