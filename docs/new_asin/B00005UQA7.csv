7955315,4,B00005UQA7,"Blake Pickett (as Josie Hunter), born around 1969, is playing the part of a very unhappy stripper/prostitute who's lost custody of her daughter because of it. She hates her jobs but can't break away from her lifestyle. She does a great job of portraying her character's unhappiness. There's rarely a smile on her face.

There's full frontal nudity with Blake and another stripper in here and her breasts are natural. See them here, bit.ly/17vAcTA

The soundtrack is beyond terrible and sounds like it would be from 1987, not 1997. Very adult contemporary and Kenny G-ish.

This isn't the best movie but with some reworking would make a great adult movie. Blake is now a photographer: bit.ly/1iyaxcj",1383177600,,698,5.0
