In that it was Kate with her favourite carols (and one or two? written by her) from South Yorkshire (where I also live). It was a treat to hear her lovely, Yorkshire accented voice that adds something extra to these old Christmas songs, along with her banter with the audience,and  complemented by the excellent brass section that have played with the band for some years, and made up of royal guardsmen, plus her usual excellent band, combine in the lovely Royal Hall in Harrogate, to make a lovely album worthy of Christmas and will not disappointment.
