8645808,1,B000VA3JBQ,"I purchased this as an accompanying gift with the Hasbro iggle piggle doll which is great.  However, the DVD was late in arriving and then could not be played in the USA but only in Europe I was told.  It would have greatly helped to have this explained before I decided to purchase since it was a gift for a 1st birthday and therefore was incomplete.  We were greatly disappointed.....",1304208000,,386,4.485714285714286
8645809,5,B000VA3JBQ,"For an adult first seeing this, the reaction is complete bafflement. There is no continuity or perspective, no dialogue beyond a few strange noises and words, and plots which would barely last through an 8 page board book let alone a half hour TV show. But put an 18 month old in front of it and you will see it from a whole new perspective...

The intent of the program makers - who were also the brains behind Teletubbies - was to come up with a show for very small children which was pure entertainment with no intended educational aspect, which I would say they have achieved admirably (though inevitably for this age group, where everything is a learning process, it's impossible for them to not learn anything at all from it). It is a combination of colorful, exaggerated, uber-simple characters, melodies and sounds in a beautiful fantasy forest landscape setting. Because of its simplicity and repetition, the characters and situations become familiar and recognizable to small children very quickly and I have yet to come across a tiny who didn't light up at the sight of IgglePiggle or the Ninky-Nonk after just a few viewings.

Sadly the US versions of these DVDs have been withdrawn but it is possible to find the UK import versions, which can be played on an all-region DVD player, or through a computer using a universal format media player. ""In The Night Garden"" is supposed to be arriving in the US within the next year to 18 months (time of writing is March 2009), probably on PBS, but it is well worth trying to hunt down the DVDs in the meantime if you have children in the 12-36 month age group.",1236902400,6,1615,4.623693379790941
8645810,4,B000VA3JBQ,This DVD is for Region 2 (Western Europe) and will not play on a US DVD - unless you pay to unlock it.,1227139200,,102,3.4782608695652173
8645811,5,B000VA3JBQ,"Our daughter is 13 months old, and she absolutely lit up the first time she saw the program on British television. She loves Uppsy Daisy most of all. We bought the DVD's while on vacation and hoped to get a DVD player that would be able to play them; now, we'll just get the US versions.

From an adult perspective, by the way, this is probably the most surreal video I have ever seen. Hearing the Shakespearian voice of Derek Jacobi intoning ""ninky nonk"" while a little blue guy falls over the place, a rock creature cleans everyone's face, and a young girl has an inflatable skirt really makes you wonder about the production team's extracurricular activities. But the kids certainly love it.",1200873600,3,694,4.642276422764228
8645812,5,B000VA3JBQ,We got this for Christmas from UK for my 18mth old and she loves it!  She is thoroughly entertained by it especially the dancing towards the end!  We'd never seen the show living in the US but her 20mth old cousin was addicted so bought it for us and it was an instant hit!!,1200182400,2,274,4.055555555555555
