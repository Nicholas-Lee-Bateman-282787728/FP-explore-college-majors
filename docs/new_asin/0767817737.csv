11811,5,0767817737,"I recently saw this film again after several years and I enjoyed as much as I had done when I first saw it when in was released onto video at the end of the 1980s.  The Seventh Sign was not your run of the mill horror  film.  What it lacked in blood, guts and gore, it made up for other ways.  The acting was excellent; Demi Moore was brilliant as the pregnant young  woman about to give birth to the first soulless child who will herald the  end of the world.  Jurgen Prochnow in turn was superb as God's witness on  earth and even Michael Biehn gave credence to his supporting role as Demi's  disbelieving husband.  Many Jacobs who plays the young Jewish boy Avi also  deserves a mention, all in all the entire cast were brilliant. This is a  much under-rated film as it is intriguing, atmospheric, and well put  together. If you get the chance to rent, buy or borrow this film, then do  so, it is well worth it and you won't be disappointed.",948499200,12,944,4.259887005649717

11848,4,0767817737,"The Seventh Sign is a unique horror.  For some reason I've never heard about it until now, and what's especially surprising (to me at least) is that Demi Moore would star in such a movie.

I had to do some research in order to write this review because otherwise my review would have been too vague and probably inaccurate if I hadn't (not that it's anything to write home about either- admittedly my mind shuts down when religion becomes the subject because that opens the door to an overwhelming amount of information).  It's about the character of Jurgen Prochnow portraying Jesus.  He comes back to Earth.  At first it seems his mission is to cause Demi's character harm and in particular harm the baby inside Demi's belly which is why Demi constantly visits the hospital for checkups and worries something might happen to either her or her baby.  Complications arise frequently- some of them real others in Demi's mind.

However without spoiling too much, Jurgen's character arrives to intervene.  He finds himself battling a mysterious ageless priest (Peter Friedman) who wishes to cause harm to Demi's baby.  Throughout the movie we see Demi constantly sneaking into Jurgen's room because he's renting a room on Demi's property and she suspects something is suspicious with his attitude.  She becomes nervous upon finding out all the paperwork he has up there related to the Apocalypse.

Demi's husband (Michael Biehn) often thinks Demi's crazy whenever she tries to explain Jurgen is trying to destroy her baby and/or the world.  She discovers many notes that lead her to think bad events are coming for everyone because sudden earthquakes and damaging hail storms start occurring out of nowhere.

When Demi searches for answers by knocking on the door of a family who she believes can offer help, she unintentionally has a conversation with Manny Jacob's character who walks by and overhears the chaos Demi accidentally causes with the upset family.  He explains that she's disrespecting the family by doing certain mannerisms that are against their religion, and due to a twist of good luck, Manny happens to understand and interpret the language she's looking for answers from.

What makes the Seventh Sign so good is the atmosphere and writing.  There's never a dry moment in this movie, right down to Demi thinking she sees Jurgen everywhere around town, to the amazing conclusion that you'll probably see coming but won't mind because it makes sense in the context of the story.  There's another element to the story that involves a young man who murdered his family and is set for execution, but to be honest it's really confusing trying to understand how this all ties into Jurgen and Peter's characters.

Simple put, while I'm skipping over tons of information here, Demi has to sacrifice someone for her baby to live.  It's really sophisticated and though the story was confusing to follow at times, I never seemed to get *too* lost.  The atmosphere, characters and writing continued to impress me the entire time, and with heavy emphasis on Exorcist-style religious scriptures in the writing which is an easy comparison to make, I'd say the Seventh Sign is a fantastic movie but on a slightly lesser scale than the Exorcist in creepiness, atmosphere and writing, but then again the Exorcist is a horror classic so it would be really hard to out-do that movie.  It comes close though.  Great movie.

There's many layers of storytelling to a film like this, and whether all the religious information is real or fiction I wouldn't be able to tell you.  Either way I highly recommend this movie.  Even if you know next to nothing about the religious stuff explained here, this shouldn't present a problem in understanding what's going on.  Demi playing lead role in a movie like this is just amazing to me!",1463616000,,3821,4.912772585669782

11857,4,0767817737,"I like this movie.  I'd say it falls in the religious or metaphysical realm, and it's a story that's been told many times in multiple formats.  Demi Moore is believeable, and Jurgen Prochnow is fantastic, as always.  It really doesn't give the details that most of the other stories do...almost as if discussing a religious story might be so offensive to the movie watchers, that they prefer to avoid almost all of the actual biblical lore.  It's a nice movie for a quiet evening, but it's really not that deep.",1457913600,,511,4.644444444444445

Jurgen Prochnow's incredibly nuanced performance as a man with a great and powerful secret; as well as the performance of Peter Friedman, a man haunted and cursed by a terrible and ancient sin. Demi Moore brings a deep poignancy to this movie, especially at the climax, where the fate of the world hangs upon her simple, but drastic, decision.  By today's standards this would not be considered a ""good"" movie; no CG special effects, car chases, explosions, or eardrum-shattering soundtrack. But if you like a thoughtful and character-driven story that touches upon faith, myth, and the incredible dichotomy of the human spirit, than this is movie you may well enjoy...",1430265600,2,749,4.944444444444445

11911,4,0767817737,"This is a decent apocalyptic themed movie.

I have been a fan of the genre, ever since I saw ""The Omen"" back in 1976.  If you like these types of movies, you should also check out ""Revelations"".  This movie, ""The Seventh Sign"" is not as good, in my opinion as The Omen, Omen II, Omen III:Final Conflict, and Revelations.  However, it is well-made and the acting performances were very good.  Perhaps one of the most solid performances from Demi Moore in her career.  Michael Biehn and Jurgen Prochnow also lend their talents here.

The end of the world is coming, according to the signs.  River water turning to blood, ice in the desert, and the moon changing colors are all signs that the end is near for mankind.  The premise here is that the supply of souls in heaven has run out, and when the first soul-less baby is born, the destruction of mankind will be irreversibly set in motion.

The story takes place in Venice, CA.  Of all places for mankind to prevent the apocalypse it had to be here, right?  Well, you have to be willing to buy into it, naturally.  An exotic setting, perhaps somewhere in old world Europe or the Middle East would have been my preference, but California is what we have.  Abby and Russell Quinn play a young couple who is trying to have a child.  Their first attempt ended in stillbirth.  One day, a stranger claiming to be a linguist arrives in town and asks to rent the couple's garage loft.  Not long after, a mysterious priest starts meddling in the couple's affairs, doing everything in his power to ensure that Russell's client (he is a lawyer) faces execution for his crimes.

11952,4,0767817737,"The Seventh Sign is a pure religion sub-genre addition. Some may instead view as more of a drama but the horror elements are there and it was classed in our genre.

 Indeed it does not have a high body count, much gore, or attempt to really frighten - but it does deal with a terrifying premise: the apocalypse. It also has some disturbing images woven throughout and is darkly themed. It is more of a horror meant to disturb and deeply interest than lightly entertain or terrify.

 Demi Moore is surprisingly exceptional in the role of a woman who wants a baby more than anything in the wolrd. Michael Beign is her husband, a man attempting to save someone off of death row. We love when either of these are on screen and they both shine. Michael Beign is the gorgeous type of guy already familiar with horror - from The Terminator and Aliens to other sci/fi, disturbing roles. As far as I know this is a first for Moore but she conveys fear well and causes sympathy. What also helps is that her character is actually interesting. We see her side of things and get into her mind a bit, making the movie play out even better.

 The plot itself is that the apocalypse has come around and it all evolves around the upcoming death of an unmentioned person/situation who we later see in the movie. The movie involves an old poem/source called ""The Gulf"" which is also known as the hall of souls. A mysterious stranger comes to town and rents out the room subletted by Demi Moore's character Abby. It is shown by the very start that he is the ressurected Jesus, who has come to start the signs and cause destruction. After each seal is broken another nightmare ensues.  An a subplot there is a situation involving Abbys unborn child - apparently before this pregnancy she had not been able to carry her last infant to full term. Her mental stability is based on the survival of her pregnancy and the stress of the events coming forth are not helping. We get to see her flashbacks, dreams, fears, excitement for children, worries for herself, ect., while she is trying to figure who this stranger is and if he's in any way part of everything that's going on. Other mysteries insue and we as the audience are drawn in and held tight. The husband Michael is out of the picture a lot of the time working at his job but he is apparently worried about the health of Abbie. When he's there he adds, when he's not the plot continues without fail.

 So overall, if Abby can figure out this mystery, she will be the woman that gives the world a second chance and stops the end of all mankind.

 Unfortunitely she doesnt know what the hell is going on and we follow her through different confusing paths. She thinks ""Jesus"" is actually some madman into some sort of strange rituals at first and then keeps evolving her opinion. Her emotional problems don't help her at all but are a great addition to the film.

 Along with unusual dreams and freaky flashes, beautiful music and story emotion on all levels, the Seventh Sign is a classic religious film often overlooked.

 People not of the Christian faith may have a little more trouble losing theirselves in the plot but if so I pity them. To me watching a movie effectively comes with the ability to open your mind to the beliefs and settings of the characters, no matter how foreign or alien the situation appears to you. I can watch The Craft or another film based on pagan religion, satanism, and what not - there is no reason an athiest cannot enjoy a film speaking of Christianity in high terms. Just my opinion though. Turned off by a film by the content alone seems sad, like you lack the ability to truly ""Just watch a movie"". If you don't enjoy religious sub-genres at all then of course avoid. But if you enjoy some give this one a chance.

 If I can accept strange outer space films, giant lizards, made up lands, creatures that don't exist..then I can watch anything and believe in it for those two hours.

 In the end The Seventh Sign is summarized as a powerful story that is emotionally wrenching throughout, and a jarring ending you will not forget.",1379635200,3,4102,4.489247311827957

11954,5,0767817737,"I first saw this movie when it hit the theatres back in the day when the only reviews were from movie critics on television and in the local paper.  No one really knew anything other than Demi Moore was in it and she was actually pregnant.  When the movie ended the entire audience got up and left the theatre in absolute silence.  I've never had this experience again.  The movie was food for thought.  It's based on the 7 signs of the apocalypse found in the Bible and The New Testament but it is applied to the current day's happenings with explanations throughout the movie plot to help people who are not familiar with those teachings understand.  With that being said it is not a bible thumping movie.  You are taken through a whole chain of events (with a couple of twists) with the story being centered mostly around this young mother who is pregnant and her attorny husband that unknowingly are participants in the revelations.  You may be able to guess the end of the story as it approaches but it doesn't soften the impact of the message.  It you're a thinker, it leaves you speechless.

11963,3,0767817737,"A series of tragic world events seem to signal the End of Days as prophesized in the Book of Revelations, with a pregnant housewife left to decide the fate of the world in THE SEVENTH SIGN! Demi Moore stars as expectant mother Abby Quinn in this religious thriller, which never manages to generate any real excitement or suspense. The large scale of ideas that are presented become siphoned by the rather narrow scope that director Carl Schultz fails to overcome creatively. We are only ever allowed to see the aftermath of each disaster, but we never witness the actual onslaught or destruction as they occur. What we are left with, instead, is Moore's character wading through a long series of discoveries that are as bland and predictable as they are tiresome. Jrgen Prochnow plays the only memorable role as the mysterious wanderer, David Bannon, with passable performances from Michael Biehn and Peter Friedman, as well. The final reveal in the end will come as little surprise, and offers even less logic or explanation. Only fans of other religious thrillers like THE PROPHECY or STIGMATA will find any interest here.

I am not really a religious person so don't know to much about how closely it follows biblical prophecies but one thing I know is that I can relate the messages in this movie (I know not the same things is occuring but the essense is the same) to what is going on in humanity at this time. We are living in a time of chaos and regardless of what race, color, religion you are the world needs healing. And Demi Moores character Abbi does a great job of bringing healing to the world.

12007,3,0767817737,"Released in 1988, ""The Seventh Sign"" is a creative take on the Bible's end-of-the-world prophecies: Apocalyptic judgments seem to be occurring all over the world as an unbelieving California couple (Demi Moore and Michael Biehn) are preparing for their first child. A mysterious stranger rents an apartment from them and Demi slowly discovers that she and her baby are the focal point of the end or possibly humanity's second chance.

Jesus Christ Himself is one of the main characters and this is one of the best depictions of Christ in film, if not THE best. He's by far the most interesting character in the movie (I'd tell you the actor playing the role but I don't want to give away who the Messiah is as the movie keeps it kinda discreet, not that it's too hard to figure out). I just wish they gave JC more screentime and dialogue since he's so intriguing; it would have made for a much more compelling picture. As it is, the film focuses on Demi and she's just not that interesting a character.

I enjoy movies that make you reflect and try to figure out. This is such a film. Some have criticized that the story is nonsensical, but it's all there clear as a bell if you reflect on it.

One reviewer criticizes that the film lacks substance, yet the story deals with nothing less than the salvation of humanity via sacrifice, faith, hope and love; plus Jesus Christ Himself is a major character. I think this qualifies as substance.

If you're having trouble figuring the story out ask yourself this question: Why is Jesus Christ attracted like a magnet to Demi and her baby? Once you have that figured out the story makes perfect sense.

I'd also like to point out that the film is expertly made on practically every level. This ain't no low-budget fare.

People seem to have trouble categorizing ""The Seventh Sign"" because it's so unique. I would say it's a mystery/horror film, but don't think ""horror"" in the sense of a slasher flick, ""Seventh Sign"" is more classy than that. Although there's loads of dead bodies and blood there's hardly any cussing and no youths getting naked.

As far as Biblical eschatology goes, the story gets it fairly accurate up to a point but then takes a creative turn. If such creative license with Christian prophecy offends you then stay away. Regardless, keep in mind that the main message of the film is completely Biblical, i.e. salvation only comes via the spilling of blood and faith, hope & love.

Unfortunately the film has a bit of a tedious vibe despite the numerous intriguing aspects, which is a major flaw considering it only runs about 90 minutes. Again, they should have given JC more screentime and dialogue as he is definitely the most interesting character. Because of this tedious vibe I give the film an overall strong 3/5 Stars or C+ (if I was in a better mood I'd give it a weak 4/5 Stars or B-). In other words, although ""The Seventh Sign"" has some undeniably great elements, overall it's neither great nor horrible; it's somewhere inbetween. Regardless, it's very worthwhile if the subject matter piques your interest.",1245196800,5,3084,4.698148148148148
12008,4,0767817737,"This Apocalyptic thriller is pure entertainment. It centers around the seven signs that signal that the end of the world is nigh. When those signs start appearing around the world, the only question is whether the world can be saved. It seems that the answer to that question lies in the grasp of one person. Who is that one person to be?

A very young Demi Moore stars as Abby Quinn, a pregnant woman with a history of miscarriages. She and her husband are eagerly and hopefully awaiting their baby. He is a lawyer who is passionate about his clients. One, in particular, the Word of God Killer, has some significance in how events unfold in the film. The Quinns live in a lovely home with an apartment over their garage that they rent to a mysterious stranger (Jurgen Prochnow) who purports to be a teacher of ancient languages.

Unfortunately, Abby has some issues, as well as a penchant for having a recurring dream that figures prominently in things to come. As the events unfold in the film, one has to suspend belief, as Abby does things that no one having a high risk pregnancy would do, and the plot spirals into being almost ridiculous at times. Still, notwithstanding its deficiencies, the film manages to entertain the viewer and keep one's interest.

The film has some excellent performances, including that of Peter Friedman as a man of the cloth with a long past. It is Jurgen Prochnow, however, who steals the entire show as David Bannon, the mysterious teacher of ancient languages who seems to carry the weight of the world upon his shoulders. Who he ultimately turns out to be is entirely believable. His performance is so compelling that those sharing a scene with him fade into the background. While exuding sensitivity and caring, he also manages to be one of the sexiest men on the silver screen. His performance is what makes this film worth watching.",1242777600,5,1875,4.710365853658536

Of course, as far as I've been able to determine, there is no such thing as the Guff (unsure of the spelling).

Clearly the Fundamentalists were too busy threatening to firebomb the theatres playing The Last Temptation that season to note the film's own unique interpretation of a p***ed-off Christ who has lost all patience with humanity: ""I came as the lamb but I return as the lion.""

12057,5,0767817737,"At my risk of appearing insensitive and boorish, read the lowest ratings of this great film, look at how they are worded, notice the poor spelling, the outright hostility, and you will see the character of the type who disparage this kind of drama.

It's not about the Bible, and it's not even about Jesus; they are secondary elements in this story of a very troubled woman with a history of medical and emotional problems, and an act of unconditional love, on her part, as well as the Savior's. I believe one of the aforementioned reviews calls leading lady Demi Moore a ""trailer camp bumer"" and they say she was ""choosen"" to save the world. What's a ""bumer?"" And how is someone ""choosen?"" This is what our High Schools turn out, year after year. That can be even more frightening than most movies. There's no ""trailer camp"" here. She and her husband live in their own home, and rent out a room above the garage. And it's not above some landlords and/or landladies to root through someone's belongings, wrong as it is. She is a seriously flawed human being, flawed, but in the end forgiven. She's not a particularly pleasant person, but why should she be? To sell more movie tickets? (""Moore"" tickets? I just kill myself sometimes!)

Jurgen Prochnow is an interesting choice of actor to portray Jesus, namely because he doesn't look like Ted Nugent. And at no time in this film is he called by name. ""Fundies"" who would like to nit-pick will tell you that this is inaccurate, because he didn't return on a great horse, and didn't judge the world; didn't make himself seen by the whole world at his arrival. There is nothing anywhere that says he can't appear to somebody to see them through a hard time in their life, in preparation for the ""Great White Throne Judgement."" He was ready, but willing to back off if anything could avert it. And, why not a regular, nondescript woman for the fate of the world to hinge upon? That kind of reasoning would think, ""What? A stable? The King Of Kings wouldn't be born in a filthy stable!"" When you listen to someone criticize, consider who is criticizing, and how they are doing it; it puts the whole argument into perspective.

One scene, a very important scene, one that any ""Christian"" should take note of, has the Jesus character visiting the retarded boy in his jail cell shortly before his scheduled execution. This was obviously a death-penalty state, the law of the land for a capital crime prescribing capital punishment, and while this condemned boy was praying in his cell for forgiveness, Jesus himself appeared to him. And without a word, he placed his hand on his shoulder, looking at him as an understanding father would, as if to say ""I know your heart, and I forgive you."" It's a moving scene.

It's not the events themselves in this story that should be seen as central, the timing of such events could arouse interest in observant people, and in this story, it would be God's creation suffering ""labor pains"" as the character portrayed by Demi Moore was experiencing said pains.

The imagery in this film is a character itself, central to it as any of the actors, scenes of dead soldiers and civilians a reminder of how ""evolved"" we are in today's world. There's a lot to be taken from this film, if you would only watch it as a story of sacrifice and devotion, and not one of religious dogma.

As a P.S.; The last book of the New Testament is called ""Revelation."" It's singular, there's no final ""s,"" it's ""The Revelation To John,"" if you want to get technical. It's not called ""Revelations.""",1121817600,17,3555,4.625990491283677

(USA - 1988)

Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)
Theatrical soundtrack: Dolby Stereo

Carl Schultz' supernatural drama is a very low-key affair, despite its apocalyptic premise (the impending birth of a young woman's unborn child threatens to unleash God's Final Judgment on the world), but it establishes and maintains a genuine sense of impending doom all the way from the opening scenes in Haiti and the Negev desert in Israel, to an uncompromising climax in the execution chamber of an American jail.

It failed at the box-office, partly because it doesn't live up to its ""Omen""-esque potential, and partly because it's simply too clever for mainstream acceptance.
