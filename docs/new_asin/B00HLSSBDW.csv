8742264,5,B00HLSSBDW,"Wow! The students in my class were so engaged! It was easy to facilitate. It would be nice to have more DVD art lessons in the series available as I would definitely invest in the whole series for my class. Perhaps more are in the making soon! The integrated subjects makes this DVD useful to use for core subjects as well as a stand-a-lone art lesson. It easily meets the Art Standards required as well. I could see using this art lesson, which is hands-on, for higher grades as well as younger grades, as there is something in it for all age levels. Excellent DVD!",1411948800,,566,4.4
