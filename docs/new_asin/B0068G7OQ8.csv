8591302,5,B0068G7OQ8,"The activities presented by Mr. Jozak truly address the needs of the modern player.  It is no wonder that players who come of age in Dinamo Zagreb's youth academy go on to become technically sound, as Modric, Kovacic and others have.  Often the conversation among soccer experts gets bogged down in tactics and formations, but I prefer to focus on simpler questions when coaching my players and planning my training sessions.  Are you moving without the ball, and where are you moving to?  Can you assess what should happen next?  Is your touch refined enough to keep up with the game?  These are all aspects of the game which this DVD addresses with practical drills and many, many variations of them, probably more than you'll ever need.
The game footage which helps to reinforce why these situational stereotypes must be mastered is well thought out and complements the instructional portion well.
Along with the helpful U6, U8, and U10 DVD, I'm looking forward to the third DVD coming out soon (sometime in 2013).",1373414400,,1017,4.8497109826589595
