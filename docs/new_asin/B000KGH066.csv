8156578,1,B000KGH066,"Like a student film with zero budget.

Rent a bus. Trick 10 actors to board it.  Make up a ""demon"" idea. Make the actors disappear with little real understanding why over the 90 minutes of the movie. A few amateur fights. Stereotypical characters. Terrible locations - bus, diner, fake town in the middle of nowhere.

From what I recall (just finished watching it):
* Nothing scary.
* No horror.
* No blood ... except a finger scratch.
* No humor.
* Took itself too seriously. Not even ""so bad it's good.""  Just bad.

Spoiler - the demon switches bodies through the movie, but we don't have any way to know it until the last 15 min because there is a blue sparkle in the eyes.

I watched this to see Natassia Malthe. Waste of time. This film makes the BloodRayne films seem like Oscar winners. I can't say anything bad about the acting. The writers/producers need to find another job, however.

Think anyone rating this more than 1-star must be related to someone working on the film.  The IMDB rating, 3.2, is a little high, IMHO.",1431129600,,1031,4.505376344086022

8156580,3,B000KGH066,"With an assortment of strange characters, Devil's Highway (2005) is a film that initially seems like it might have some substance, but after taking you on a meandering ride with a few dark moments, it grinds to a halt, before fizzling out, leaving a busload of loose ends.  The cast do a pretty good job, but after a decent setup, the writing flat out fails to deliver.  Minor spoilers follow.

A bus bound for Las Vegas is motoring through New Mexico.  After introducing the various passengers, the story kind of focuses on Joe the bus driver (Robert Miano), Randi (Kacia Brady) an apparently troubled teen, and Max (Tim Kelly) a young man apparently turning his life around.  Periodically, the bus stops so the passengers can take a break or get something to eat, but something evil is present, and along the way, several passengers fail to reboard the bus.  Reading from a newspaper, Max recounts a story concerning Old Highway 13, and the town of Iron Forge, which is supposedly cursed, because a man was lynched there.  Since misfortune seems to plague the area, the stretch of road is known as the Devil's Highway.

To save time, the bus takes Old Highway 13, but soon runs out of fuel in the middle of a desert.  The driver discovers that someone has deliberated punctured the fuel tank, and heads off to the abandoned town of Iron Forge to look for some fuel.  From this point, the film goes straight down the tubes, particularly in the dialog department.  While the story wasn't great, things were at least mildly interesting.  As people leave the bus, they easily fall victim to the evil demon that has been on the journey from the very start, travelling from person to person.  There are a few tense moments but the violence is mostly off screen or shielded in some way.  What little excitement there is, peaks as the chicken-hearted group attempts to flee.

While Devil's Highway sets the stage pretty well, what occurs isn't very convincing or scary, resulting in a film that sacrifices key characters, and just has no strong finishing kick.  Budgetary constraints may have been a factor, as the film has numerous fadeouts and cutaways, rather than featuring action.  The final result may have you questioning whether the investment was worth the time.  Rating: 2.5 stars.",1326758400,,2285,4.785714285714286

8156582,2,B000KGH066,"Moody but muddled mishmash of satanic silliness.  A group of travelers on a bus headed for Las Vegas find themselves sharing the road with some kind of demon who kills people and then takes their places.  The demon is supposedly a witch whose lover was lynched several years earlier.  The script is so disheveled, however, and it's hard to keep up with what's going on right up to the inevitable twist ending.  Shane Brolly, Al Sapienza and other actors are defeated by the contrived premise.  For fans of the genre only.",1176854400,2,521,4.681318681318682
