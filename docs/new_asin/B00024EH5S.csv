8156278,1,B00024EH5S,"Chris Young (PCU, Book of Love) plays a kid who has just shacked up with his new roomy played by Kristoffer Tabori (Brave New World, Braker). Tabori's neighbors consist of tough guy George Segal (Just Shoot Me, The Cable Guy) and his wife Tanya Roberts (That 70's Show, Sins of Desire). Young becomes fascinated by Roberts and eventually starts to worry about her because her and her husband Segal have alot of fights. Young even bugs their apartment so he can listen to their conversations. He then becomes more closer to Roberts and eventually the young boy sleeps with the mature woman. Things get heated and twists and turns begin to happen. Pretty lame movie with terrible performances by all and Tanya Roberts as a love interest? Please, come on. Segal shouldnt of been here. A waste of time this movie is. Boring as boring can be. Dont watch it is my advice but if you do I warned you.",1147910400,2,892,4.58125
