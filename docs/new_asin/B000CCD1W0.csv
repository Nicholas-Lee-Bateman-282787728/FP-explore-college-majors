That being said, I am the fat guy that keeps being knifed, shot drown and choked. I give away many copies signed by me. If you can find an unsigned one it is worth a fortune.",1381190400,,308,4.15
8166730,4,B000CCD1W0,"I was blown away by this little movie. It's definately a guy flick (Guns, Action, Violence, Rough Sexual Situations) but having said that, my girlfriend loved it too so go figure.

If you like Men being men and kicking ass and takin' names. Get this one. Drink a beer and yell at your tv!  Killer.",1147651200,5,297,4.381818181818182
