6303997,5,B00IXPQUCQ,"Having seen countless UFO documentaries I can say without hesitation Mirage Men is the most interesting and thought provoking of the lot. Most UFO diehards will probably hate it, because it doesn't support the ""aliens are here"" theory (and the fact that Linda Moulton Howe comes off looking more than a little nutty), but it does have some very interesting and plausible explanations for some of the more nefarious stories that have floated around for many years. Check it out, if you have an open mind.",1402790400,3,503,4.8604651162790695
6303998,5,B00IXPQUCQ,"In reading the former reviews, my sense is that the viewers missed the point of this engrossing multi-level tale of intrigue, conspiracy, and obsessions. For someone like myself, with no knowledge of the people and events explored in MIRAGE MEN, the film is immensely successful in engaging viewers in a story about government secrets and alien theories while embracing underlying themes of ambiguity, illusion and in the end, elusive truths. What is impressive is that MIRAGE MEN introduces us to many different, complex and imperfect characters and their stories in a very clear fashion (not an easy feat) taking us on their journeys that twist and turn in surprising directions always stranger than fiction. Another strength of this documentary is that it doesnt judge its characters, highlighting many forms of disinformation and presenting the maze of occurrences that may or may not have taken place over time in a manner that encourages the viewer to question and reevaluate his/her own initial presumptions at various points throughout the story. For me, the film became more about questioning our perceived truths and existing beliefs than believing wholeheartedly in any character or claim. For general audiences, this seems perhaps the best way to appreciate what MIRAGE MEN, the film (not the novel) offers, and, I think, perhaps why the filmmakers decided to make the film? By the end I felt like I had met some fascinating folks on a roller coaster ride that made wondering about the incredible capacity of human imagination and perception even more the issue than government machinations and visitors from outer space. What could be more fun and compelling?",1402704000,23,1672,5.196296296296296
6303999,3,B00IXPQUCQ,"Just finished watching DVD. If you are new to this subject it might be worth watching. If, like me, you have been following this subject for a long time, you will not see much new here. Disinformation specialist Richard Doty is highlighted. He has zero credibility in the field due to his work, yet is given a good deal of screen time. I suppose if you want a primer on how disinformation can be effective, then this might hold some interest for you. Does not answer any questions about UFOs, but does show how government disinformation specialists have muddied the field.",1402617600,2,572,4.673267326732673
6304000,3,B00IXPQUCQ,"I had read Mirage Men so I was very interested in the documentary of the same name which follows the same content as the book. The documentary was decent but it almost seemed like an 85 minute preview for the book. Much is presented but there is not a clear narrative to wrap it all up. I understand that the riddle has yet to be completely solved but the ending just seemed abrupt and silly.

If you have been following the Paul Bennewitz saga in ufology there are several fascinating interviews well worth the documentary. If you have no background in the subject, you will just be very confused. Mirage Men assumes that the watcher is well read on the UFO subject.

Of particular note is the interview with the late Gabe Valdez, New Mexico State Policeman resposible for investigating much of the cattle mutilation phenomenon in the late 70s and 80s. The interview is just presented in almost random snippets but Gabe says some things that make you wish you had access to the unedited tape. He makes it clear that the mutilations are the work of at least 2 intelligence agencies and then goes on to say that he KNOWS there is a secret base around Dulce NM because he has seen the entrance, and entrance large enough for trucks.

If you have read the book ""Mirage Men"", this is a good follow up but it will make you want to reread the book to make sense of the interviews. If you have not read ""Mirage Men"", ""Project Beta"", or ""Dulce Base"" I would skip this until you have. Without some background this documentary will only confuse you.",1402444800,,1539,4.489285714285714

6304002,5,B00IXPQUCQ,"This review is for the film itself, as I watched it online.

MIRAGE MEN chronicles the testimony of an ex-Air Force counterintelligence officer's efforts to promote the UFO mythology as a cover for secret aviation technology developed during the Cold War. That's just the beginning. Did the government have a secret program to fan the flames of UFO paranoia? What was the NSA doing beaming radio traffic into the homes of private citizens? Is the subject telling the truth now, or is he still running interference for the Air Force?

The film features multiple experts in the field of UFOlogy, including filmmakers, journalists, and researchers. Everyone has a different point of view, and a different take on the truth. This documentary has more than its fair share of twists and turns. We even hear multiple perspectives on the same events, with radically different interpretations.

The production values are slick, the interviews in-depth, and the questions explored thought-provoking. Anyone with an interest in the Cold War, UFOlogy, or intelligence operations will find a lot to enjoy.",1398384000,41,1092,5.228571428571429

The sick glee he took in helping to drive another human being into committing suicide is despicable on so many levels.  Shocking, actually.  He acted proud of his achievement.  And all for what?  Do convince Mr. Bennewitz that alien contact was real or to convince us that it is not?

It's amazing to me all that the film makers did NOT include in this production.  Doty stated that that Jesus Christ was ""given"" to humanity by extraterrestrials to steer our course in a better way.  He presented this to Linda Howe.  And so much more.  But apparently, the film makers didn't want us to fully appreciate what kind of a paid government sicko this Doty guy really is.

6304074,4,B00IXPQUCQ,"For the last 8 years or so, Ive gotten more UFO information than the average sane person probably should. From old interviews with John Lear to reading older books like Missing Time by Budd Hopkins, and skimming through the Dulce papers and even glimpsing at the infamous Matrix books, Ive gotten a lot of info from various places. Do I believe all of it? At this point, I don't know any more. I don't go around proclaiming to know anything or state that any of it is factual, although I do believe in a couple of key points that, believe it or not, are actually similar to what can be found in the Bhagavad Gita. One should be cautious when reading any information on anything UFO related. John Lear himself said that the majority of the community is nuts, and if you visit one message board on aliens, you can see for yourself.

I heard about Mirage Men just a few weeks ago while listening to The Joe Rogan Experience, and it sounded really interesting, so I got right to it. Its hard to give a plot summary for this one, since it covers so much ground and I don't want to ruin any of it. The main thing is that it covers one man, Richard Doty, a retired agent who worked for the AFOSI, and basically gave out bad information to people who were a potential threat to special projects that were being worked on. One man he gave the info to essentially went crazy, and while Richard even tried to talk to him as a friend and not as an agent, it was too late at that point- he was convinced everything Doty told him was true. We also get to see interviews and speeches with other people that Doty gave information to, including Linda Howe, a prominent figure in UFO research who you cant help but feel bad for when you watch her segment.

Doty claims that UFOs and the publics interest in them is what helped the cover up for special projects like air crafts and other testing done at various bases. Because of how the whole alien thing is perceived, there was never any need to get defensive about it, because as we all know, most people think you're nuts when you start talking about this kind of stuff. One thing that killed me is when Doty explains that some of the information he put in documents to give to people was true, but it was mixed in with a bunch of lies too, because thats the best way to do it. This is mentioned when Linda Howe is talking about some papers that she was shown, but not allowed to take any notes on. For whatever reason, the filmmakers didn't have her elaborate on that, except for one key part she talks about. I wouldve loved to have heard more about what she read, and im sure she didn't forget any of it.

There are a lot of different things covered in Mirage Men. Just when I was starting to think to myself, oh thats cool but what about, they got to it. This documentary more or less shuts down a lot of what UFO researchers believe in. Exceptit goes without saying, that this guy could also be saying all of this on camera just to throw people off even more. Lie about lies you told. It can work. The main thing here is to just watch the documentary without sticking to any beliefs you may have when it comes to the subject, and see what you get out of it. As much as some of the things Ive read have haunted me over the years, I still won't say that any of it is factual. Its just a belief.

4 out of 5 stars because some of the music was so overdramatic that it was irritating, and because interviews with key people like Linda Howe couldve been more fleshed out. I feel like they didn't let a couple of people say as much as they shouldve.",1449360000,2,3583,4.241581259150805
6304075,3,B00IXPQUCQ,"This documentary was fairly well made, and I really have no problem with it per say except that it didn't really flow well. It's all over the map and sometimes I would have to pause it and back up to see if I missed something. Well, no I didn't miss anything, it's just that we jumped from channel 5 over to channel 8, and then while trying to process the point of of jumping to channel 8 we are now over on channel 12. So, it was a bit confusing at times, however it was still worth my time to watch it and I would recommend it.",1448668800,,529,3.953271028037383
6304076,1,B00IXPQUCQ,"Disclaimer  It is possible that I hated this because I watched it while I had a bad cold and did not feel well.  But I watched other movies this week feeling much worse and I didn't hate them,

I think this film is an excellent torture device.  If you need to interrogate someone and have the time, strap them to a chair, keep them awake, and put this movie on loop.  After 2 loops, they will probably tell you what ever you want to know just to stop playing this movie.  It is painful and drones on and on saying the same thing over and over.... and over and over..... and over and over......  STOOOOOOOPPPPP IT, PLEASE!

Maybe I'll revisit this one and see if I feel different it about it, but I doubt it.",1446854400,3,707,4.185185185185185

6304078,3,B00IXPQUCQ,"So my problem is not with the content or production of the movie. My problem is, why should I trust people like Doty to be telling the truth now. When for a very long time his job was lying to protect the truth from getting out? Sorry I don't buy that every UFO case was just smoke screens to protect top secret military testing of advanced aircraft. It does not explain all the World sightings over the decades or the documented sightings of objects even before man flew anything. I have no doubt that Doty is telling some truth in his interview. Obviously the government's in many Countries have certainly contained any information or investigations of UFO's. The movie simply affirms the obvious that government is totally involved in controlling the UFO phenomenon in a attempt at discrediting and skewing what is fact, fiction and so called government attempts at protecting top secret projects. As Agent Fox Mulder says ""the truth is out there"" But probably not much of it is in this movie. Only more skewing of what is truth, half truths and questions about credibility from everyone. Its entertaining but hardly a movie that resolves any questions about what UFO's are and if they are from Earth or somewhere else.",1444348800,6,1222,4.768867924528302
6304079,4,B00IXPQUCQ,"If you've got an interest in UFOs then this is worth a look.  Not so much because you'll be able to say that there must be real extraterrestrial races who do randomly appear in UFOs, but because you'll be convinced U.S. government agencies do have an involvement in the field.  They even use their own agents to be vehicles of disinformation within certain people in order to cloud perceptions.  You meet one such tool in the government's arsenal who may have been the main perpetrator of such, Richard Doty.  Doty is interesting if due to no other reason that he largely contributed to one prominent businessman losing his complete sanity.  In the end the looming question has to be why the government has obviously gone to such lengths to discredit folks over something as filled with smoke and mirrors as the UFO issue?  Thus you'll have to be, likely, even more confused with the age's strangest enduring phenomenon after watching.  A documentary where hard facts are impossible to piece together, but a truly interesting presentation of so-called ""high strangeness"".",1444003200,,1071,4.949720670391062

Although I kind of felt like I was watching one of those faux documentaries that they have on Animal Planet, like The Mermaid lol.  The most disturbing to me is how the government gaslighted that poor man (Paul B.?) in a terrible, evil manner and drove him insane. I have no doubt that our government and others in the world are covering up UFO information. I have always thought we were a product of alien experiments, after all there are millions of years between us and the dinosaurs... and unless things are fossilized everything decays pretty quick or destroyed by who knows what. I often wonder if aliens manipulate and watch us for entertainment value. It's pretty obvious that our technology has been artificially advanced over the past century, no way could we have come up with a lot of the military, energy, aviation, weapons, communications, computer technology on our own. Unfortunately much of it is not beneficial to us as a species, hence the feeling we're being manipulated for entertainment value or some unfathomable experiment-as they're not helping us much with environmental, societal or health issues. I know UFOs are real because I saw one and I doubt it was our new technology for a variety of reasons. The universe is forever and who knows if there are endless dimensions too, it's ridiculous to think there aren't billions of life forms that normally don't mess with primitive species like us, or they're primitive themselves and can't do space travel.",1441584000,2,1562,4.916666666666667

Subject: Mark Pilkington

Richard:

Steve Lawson, a senior DIA official, told me, point blank, that a name check revealed that Mark Pilkington, a British Citizen and Independent Film Maker, is a MI6 source. He was used to spy on other film makers and is currently a source of information to British Intelligence on Crop Circles.  He is paid by British Intelligence and has been since October 1998.

Now this brings up an interesting dilemma for you.  Mr. Pilkington has a film, with you in it.  A copy of that film can be obtained from the DIA.  Now, tell me how the hell DIA obtained a copy of Mr. Pilkington's film?  If you have problems with that question, I think I can answer it. The DIA has a source within British Intelligence.  Now, the second question is this.  Why would the DIA care about a film made by Mr. Pilkington?  I cannot answer that question.

If I was you, I'd be careful of my ""circle of friends"".

6304097,5,B00IXPQUCQ,"Fascinating. Well done.

Now we know for sure that the US Government created the ""MJ-12"" documents. They did a really, really good job of it. Good enough to keep a large contingent of UFO researchers running in circles for *years* trying to decide if they were real or fake. We know that ""they"" must have spent considerable time and money faking these documents - it took the work of experts to do this. Doty says he was just the ""delivery boy"" - he had nothing to do with the actual creation of the documents which ""came in a package from Washington"".

So the question we are left with now - the question we *must* ask - is why? Why did some organization within the US government (probably the CIA but we do not know for certain) feel it *needed* to spend the time and effort to create the MJ-12 hoax? Just to confuse and befuddle a bunch of ""UFO nuts""? If they really were all just ""nuts"", why not let them rant & rave & rock & roll - and completely ignore them? If there is ""nothing to"" the UFO phenomena, why pay it any attention at all? How did the organization that created these elaborately faked documents *justify* the expense of doing so? This took a team of skilled, professional,civil servants, whose salaries were paid by the US taxpayer, at least several weeks - more likely months - to put together. Those ""professionals"" sat around spending your and my tax money (probably a few $100K worth at least) creating fake documents that purported to ""prove"" that UFOs are real, we have recovered several crashed alien vehicles including occupants, that presidents Truman and Eisenhower knew all about it, etc. etc.

6304099,5,B00IXPQUCQ,"Fascinating.
Is the UFO phenomena and intelligence operations to hide military technology that has been glimpsed?
Are UFOs real and is the idea that they are an intelligence operation disinformation to hide that fact?

Are UFOs an ongoing psychological warfare experiment? Is the focus on the USA really hiding that the human race as a whole is being manipulated into an outcome that has been determined by an international shadow state?

Is the fascination with UFOs internationally a symptom of the empty space at the heart of the technocratic processed mind and too a symptom of the loss of belief in a spiritual life, especially Christianity?

Or...  is our fascination with UFOs a collective sense... that the Universe is a mechanism that preserves steps towards and then consciousness itself, elevates intelligence?

Does ""spirit' really mean the vast interconnected web of conscious life in the Universe?

And asked in the documentary: are we being processed to accept that humanity is just one new civilization among many already relatively near by in our Galaxy?

Some of my questions here are not asked in this very interesting documentary.
Humanity questions, it is what we do more than even love or hate.

That process of expansion of the known... is a basic fact about our mystery as a species on this planet Earth.
Is our origin as a species not just a part of the evolutionary pressures on this planet,  but a part of what is conserved by the Universe... mind, knowing?

My own take is that UFOs as a psychic phenomena, both from the government disinformation side and from the true believers perspective,  are a collective psychic reaction... to the trauma of the loss of myth, as humanity's psychic core belief in spirit and too a symptom of our mal-adaptation as a species to a over populated technocratic world where every aspect of our being is defined in terms of mechanics... and not in terms of soul.",1439769600,,1923,4.904320987654321

6304143,5,B00IXPQUCQ,"As a child in the late 1970s, my  mother told me a story that she had heard from a military officer while she worked as a secretary for an Army air defense base in the early 1960s. I'd recognize the story later as the Roswell Incident. Since then, I've always had an interest in the UFO mystery. But having later become a US Air Force historian, I know that much of the UFO mythology is just that. I've also heard from respected sources and read enough to know that at least since 1947, the UFO phenomenon has been an excellent cover for classified aerospace technologies. Test flights of a strange looking aircraft like the B-2? UFO of course! And you saw that ""UFO?"" Well surely John Doe, UFO witness, you're a nut. You saw Venus. Nothing to see here Soviet/Chinese intelligence.

Mirage Men is only the tip of the iceberg about how the intelligence community can exploit and foster UFO stories. The CIA's own historian in 1997 wrote that 50 percent of all of Project Blue Book's unexplained sightings were U-2 and A-12 aircraft. Yet the CIA needed the Air Force to cover that fact up.

What is most amazing is that even though the Doty-Bennewitz story has been public knowledge for over 25 years, there are still prominent UFO researchers who refuse to admit they were played--and still are being played. For the US intelligence community--who have a real need to distract attention from black projects--it's really the gift that keeps on giving.",1434931200,,1449,4.696850393700787

6304154,4,B00IXPQUCQ,"Enjoyable but then gets convoluted when it seems to go into this area of 'cover-up to cover-up the cover-up'. I'll have to rewatch to see what the filmmaker was really driving at, or if he was just trying to present all angles in an objective (?) way. It's always seemed very obvious to me that the UFO phenom, particularly Area 51, was fed in some way as a red herring for experimental craft (otherwise, how would drones have been developed, a craft for which legal framework doesn't really exist yet, but they're already in use). That always seemed the obvious explaination, instead of some Govt. collusion with aliens (?!). I always wondered how articulate & educated people could see otherwise, and this film shows how there's no fool like an educated fool. But then...

...But then we seem to go into the weirdness rabbithole of counter-disinformation (?), or in Linda Howe's excellent quote ""A hall of fractured mirrors with a quicksand floor"". I don't know if that's her phrase or an old aphorism, but it's brilliant. In general, I had the feeling that the filmmaker was entertaining the pro-UFO angle to humor people so that they'd appear in the film, as Linda Howe says she won't appear if it's going to discredit UFO researchers and say it's all government disinfo. I'd like to read Pilkington's book to see where he really meant to go, versus what was a useful angle to take in a movie. But what's great is that it does seem to show how someone involved in any kind of 'spook' activity, could just go nuts out of sheer confusion and paranoia. Psy-ops indeed! It reminds me of the comedy ""Burn After Reading"" in which the George Clooney agent character no longer can look at strangers without seeing nefarious intent- a tourist with a camera, a person waiting for a date, etc, all appear to be spies to him. He no longer can tell what's what.

This film puts a toe into that territory of mind-messer-upper (I can't write the real term here). The end quote is pretty great (won't spoil it) and it leaves each viewer to use it in service of whatever the bias is; therefore it's like a rorshack: If you start watching with belief in UFOs, you'll come away with that & see the conspiracy as hiding that truth. If you start out with the bias that it's military psy-ops for aircraft development, you'll come away with that opinion.

There are a few noteworthy researchers in this movie, but never put to good use.  Never engaged and plumbed for their knowledge.  Often the film mocks these people by showing things like an old woman inflating a giant alien, conferences barely attended, and alien-themed businesses not being patronized, while they are talking.  At one point--and I poop you not--the camerman pans to look up an interviewee's NOSE!!!  And hangs there admiring his nose hair!  More than once the documentary shows us the dark and dirty halls of a hotel!  For NO REASON!  LOL.  If those few things don't clue you in to how much the film makers actually cared about this ""documentary,"" maybe the film's horrible and pointless interviews will.

The film revolves around Richard Doty, the guy on the cover, who was a professional liar employed by the government to discredit and confuse those who get too close to secret projects.  He is partially responsible for the mental unraveling and death of an innocent man.  If you believe anything he says.  Because today he now knows aliens are real and the videos on Youtube of alien interviews are real, etc.  Blah blah blah.

A liar who may be lying about lying to get other people to believe lies that turned out to be true is probably still lying.  Where I come from, guys usually punch these types in the face, take them into the back of the deli, and . . . share sandwiches.

As Linda Moulton Howe explains in this film, the UFO community is ""a fractured hall of mirrors with quicksand floors.""  Infiltrated by government disinformation agents, genuine fools, genuine nutjobs, and debunkers.  And perhaps people who just want attention and the joy of causing trouble?  Huh?  Mr. Doty?

6304191,2,B00IXPQUCQ,"There are great documentaries and there are bad ones. The good ones take you on a path of discovery involving a topic you may know little about and hold your interest from start to finish. The bad ones have one of two problems. The first is that they take a subject no one cares about and do a bad job of gaining your interest. The second is when they take what could be a very interesting story and turn it into something so boring no one can stay till the final credits. MIRAGE MAN falls into this second category.

The topic at hand is UFOs and aliens, something that many find of particular interest. It seems everyone can find someone they know who has seen something odd in the sky or who claims they have seen a UFO. This movie tries to explain where the whole hysteria of flying saucers stems from. According to this film it all came from one man, Rick Doty.

Doty was an agent of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFSOI). When an electronics whiz and UFO researcher named Paul Bennewitz began looking into transmissions he was receiving word got back to the Air Force. What Bennewitz was actually receiving was transmissions from secret Air Force tests being conducted. But this was at the height of the cold war so they wanted him to steer clear of what he was hearing. Rather than threaten him they sent Doty who worked alongside Bennewitz and allowed him to believe that these actually were messages of alien origin.

Passing along false information they carried out a charade that lasted decades and that almost all UFO information has stemmed from. Photos and leaked documents were all false and passed along to Bennewitz and others with the hope that it would lead people to think they were either crazy or perhaps on to something. Of course it was UFOs and not the secret projects being formed and tested in those deserts. What better way to camouflage what was really going on?

The problem came when the tiny story began to expand and become bigger than they ever dreamed it would. The government went so far as to hire members of the groups searching for the truth about UFOs to help them. Many weren't even aware at the time just how involved they were. But here is where the problem with the movie comes in.

To begin with the movie is done is such a straight forward way with nearly non-stop interviews with the most uninspiring and bland people that it nearly puts you to sleep. The other problem is how the stories unfold which becomes confounding to the viewer. There are items that Doty being interviewed says were stories concocted to be passed along but then he backtracks about later and says there was some truth to. By the time you're done listening to him you're not sure if there was UFO technology being used and backtracked or if it was all faked. Then again that was what his job was to do for all those years.

In the end your own personal beliefs will not be shaken by this film nor will they be confirmed. Like the ever elusive Bigfoot and the long seen but never found UFO, it all depends on your belief. Until either of these is sighted I'll have to take the side of the skeptic. When you find either of them please let me know.",1405382400,2,3183,4.469879518072289

This film is more of an interesting case study in human psychology than it is aliens. I heard ""In every lie there's a grain of truth"" over and over. That to me is so amazingly funny, it boarders on sad. In every lie there's nothing but lies. There's no rule that says you have to tell some of the truth if you lie. It doesn't make the lie more believable at all. People who think there's some form of truth in every lie are trying hard to keep their egos from being bruised. They're basically saying, ""Yes, I know I'm being fooled and being made to look stupid, but I'm sure that part of this is true because I have to believe it is.""  Seriously, if people believe the government in the 1940's allowed humans to go to an alien planet with a mess of aliens and come back with samples, you deserve to look stupid. What's more believable? That an alien race, billions of light years away came to this backwater, no where blue rock, interacted with a comparatively mentally retarded species and then take the time to help cover it all up.. for no reason at all. Or that some bored guy who can't let go of his job lying to people and making them look stupid copied the plot from a movie and sent it to ""believers?"" What magical spell would Spielberg hold that would allow him to have such amazing information to make a movie about? Ohhh, that's right, it was the government telling a lie that had ""truth"" in it.

For UFO nuts, I would say that this documentary is a interesting watch, but not necessary if your hoping to expand your knowledge on the topic.  What I do like as that this documentary, is that it does stray away from the questionable topics that have been all the craze in recent UFO shows like abductions, under ground bases, alien hybrids etc..

6304208,5,B00IXPQUCQ,"Truth, as the saying goes, is often stranger than fiction. When it comes to the UFO phenomenon and the topics associated associated with it, that would most certainly appear to be the case. Based on the book by Mark Pilkington, the documentary film Mirage Men certainly proves that the real world can produce tales as strange as any you are likely to encounter in a science fiction tale.

Mirage Men explores more than sixty years of government involvement in the UFO phenomenon but it doesn't so with the typical conspiratorial overtones. While it touches upon everything from rumors of secret government bases to crashed UFOs, it really looks at something just as compelling: how the phenomenon has been manipulated, especially by groups and agencies within our own government.

The main focus of the documentary is Richard Doty, a former agent of the Air Force Office Of Special Investigations (AFSOI). The documentary looks at how Doty and some of his colleagues in the 1980s were responsible for helping to foster much of what is today part of the lore that has become synonymous with UFOs. For example, it presents what one interviewee calls the sad, strange, horrible true story of electronics engineer and UFO researcher Paul Bennewitz who, having filmed and recorded transmissions from what he thought were UFOs, was targeted by Doty and his colleagues to the point of being driven virtually insane, having come to believe an alien invasion was imminent from underground bases in New Mexico.

The Bennewitz story is just the tip of the iceberg. The documentary explores the efforts Doty and his colleagues made around the same time with others including UFO researcher William Moore (one of the original investigators of Roswell) who made a Faustian bargain that involved him spying on others in the UFO research community in an attempt to get information out of the government and investigative journalist Linda Moulton Howe who Doty handed documents claiming humans had been genetically altered by aliens. There's also an exploration of cattle mutilations with the odd origins of that sideline of the UFO story and ends by exploring the alleged human/alien exchange program Project Serpo, which appears to be just the latest addition of disinformation to UFO lore.

The question the documentary really tries to answer  is a simple one: why do any of this at all? Is it just a series of cover stories to protect any number of things from the early development of stealth technology in the 1980s to drones in more recent times? Is it to cover up what the government actually knows about UFOs? Or is the truth somewhere in the middle perhaps, having been perhaps irrevocably distorted by the need for national security?

In the end, Mirage Men doesn't have all the answers nor claims to have them. What it does present on the other hand is a fascinating look at how the UFO phenomenon, whatever the truth behind it might be, has been  manipulated and often so by the very government that claims they don't exist at all. Ultimately then, Mirage Men shows that the truth might be very well out there but it may be stranger than anything we could imagine.",1403222400,13,3160,4.917448405253284
6304209,2,B00IXPQUCQ,"This movie explores the disinformation campaigns waged by the military to confuse the public and destroy the reputation of Ufologists. Since there really is not much interesting footage or any stable ground in this movie it begins to feel like the very disinformation propaganda that it is discussing.
Even Doty's own words were  ambiguous...he seemed to imply cover up because of military secrets and then he would imply cover up of UFO activity.  I have to admit by the end I was not trusting or even paying attention to what anyone was saying.  Once this is free on amazon prime I may give it another glance to see if there are any clues in the contradictions.  The disinformation mantra of a lot of information with lies and truths mixed together was repeated frequently.  It seems like the director was trying to get the viewer to feel the uncertainty cast by disinformation campaigns even about the movie itself.  If that was the intent then it worked wonderfully and deserves a couple more stars.  When it is all said and done you realize just how absolutely easy it is to cast doubt on just about anything to the point where the real truth can be lost forever...and the whole truth is known by no one.  How much of history, what we hear on the news, what our government tells us, what our employers tell us, is disinformation?  A whole lot more than we realize.",1403136000,2,1369,4.62396694214876
6304210,5,B00IXPQUCQ,"If you have ever wondered about the existence of ET-UFO's & Military Top Secret Weapons in the Sky, or ET Contact with Military, or Cattle ""Mutilation"" (really precise dissection) Deaths faked as ET-UFO abduction ""experiments"", or how Military PSYOPS were used during the heights of the Cold War aimed at American citizens to uncover domestic or foreign spies and confuse ""the enemy"", or how the NSA (or other secret agency without legal warrants) got involved with monitoring & signaling domestic citizen(s) about ET-UFO disinformation (against the law), then this amazing documentary touches on all these probabilities that also 'actually happened'. IT IS REAL. Life is far stranger and confusing than tall ET-tales inside this nightmare of psyops-madness.

Personally, since I've had an interest in ET and UFO's and its decades long controversies involving military bases or within flying distance of these bases, I found myself profoundly affected by this incredibly insightful and spooky documentary. There are no ET-UFO sightings or direct investigations in Mirage Men, but it is a 'must see' to begin to understand your own probable conflicted beliefs about these subjects.

All of the following is no longer a review but my own theories and ideas about what is going on with ET-UFO's and the Military Industrial Complex using the ET-UFO TV-Hollywood science fiction connection for serious and real PSYOPS directed against the American people and its enemies.

The Military Industrial Complex and ET-UFO Hollywood and Science Fiction TV/Internet has saturated our brains with ""religious"" fantasy-science beliefs so much that the Military PSYOPS now use these ET-UFO beliefs to create and cover-up all kinds of Black Oops using psychological warfare deception techniques.

The cattle mutilation deaths were Military Black Oops to test possible bio-weapons and/or radiation exposure experiments over a period of decades. Transporting and dropping the cattle from Stealth Helicopters created the ET-UFO ""freaky connection"" as part of more Military PSYOPS to confuse & cover-up these black oops. These are very serious ""psychological crimes"" committed against society at large that also harmed ranchers both psychologically and financially. All this madness was fueled by the Cold War and secret weapons test programs??? We need REAL DISCLOSURE that also reveals the faked-out ET-UFO PSYOPS and cover-up.

I have no doubt the Military can now project 3D images in the sky to fake ET-UFO's, use directed electro-magnetic EMP (or other invisible) pulse-weapons to shut-off automobiles or computers and any electronics, send some type of energy-wave forms to project sound and confusion inside our brains to the point of disorientation and loss of consciousness, and can now confuse radar to track these UFO-3D images in the sky. All of it is done under-the-cover of being ET-UFO related sightings that camouflage black military oops and aerial weapons. This is the pinnacle of psychological warfare.

Think about it seriously!

I definitely do not believe in any recovered ET-UFO crashes! The 'real' ET-UFO will land without crashing! Only humans crash their UFO's.

Yes, I believe in intelligent life forms far more advanced than humans exist somewhere in the universe possibly in vast numbers and varieties. It is certainly possible that our planet has been visited by an ET being(s), but we have no proof of that already happening with ongoing verifiable contact with ET. Some people believe this is happening now, but I think the military is using these ET-UFO popular conspiracy beliefs to cover-up using psychological PSYOPS weapons programs -and- also as a ""double-cover"" for really advanced flight-weaponry well beyond our typical understanding of weapons applications or appearance and shape.

If ET is already here, then I doubt ET is going to let us in on the secret as to why it's here now. ET can disclose its presence if it wants to, right? So, we just have to wait and see what happens regarding that possibility regardless of any alien and/or government conspiracy. In the meantime, our Military Industrial Complex is making trillions of dollars off ET-UFO PSYOPS and weapons... thanks to our science-fiction belief systems supported by the trillion dollar TV-Movie Hollywood Matrix. ET wins no matter what. Follow the money for the human aspects. The military, Hollywood, science research, and space exploration already make trillions off ET and UFO's. :)

This amazing documentary helped me form such a wild set of conclusions that I wonder if I'm PSYOPS confused too??? Lol. :))",1403049600,2,4598,5.35595567867036
6304211,5,B00IXPQUCQ,"Amazing documentary. Just like the world of counterintelligence, it shows how the UFO community is haunted by a wilderness of mirrors. The documentary has taken a very complex subject, UFO disinformation campaigns, and presents it in a way that the viewer is not steered but allowed to make up his or her own mind. I highly recommend it. Especially recommended to anyone who lives in New Mexico and has heard the infamous stories of the Dulce Base.",1403049600,13,448,4.8311688311688314
6304212,5,B00IXPQUCQ,"It's curious that reviewers have criticised this film for being 'ambiguous' or not coming up with definitive answers about UFOs. Richard Doty is at the centre of the film not because of his 'credibility in the field' but because he he is a totally fascinating character, full of contradictions possibly a patsy, possibly a disinformer of the highest order. The film is not so much about UFOs but about how and why people believe what they do and how the government attempts to construct these beliefs; there is no hard evidence here as there are only stories within stories. Those looking for the 'truth' of ET encounter will be disappointed, but those will to take the journey through a maze of myths and counter-myths will be rewarded by this ingenious, if at times frustrating, documentary.",1402876800,26,793,4.881481481481481

8646161,3,B00IXPQUCQ,"Interesting subject matter, but I had to take off some stars for filmmaking which is so amateur as to be distracting - random or pointless cutaways, distractingly irrelevant archival footage, terrible freeze frames, bad lighting and composition (eg a bright lamp in a room with an interviewee or someones bag distracting you in a corner). But still, interesting when there are strong sources (as opposed to ufo historians or management consultants). Overall worth a watch but not as groundbreaking as I hoped. Glad someone made this but definitely needed higher production values.",1517702400,,580,5.315217391304348
8646162,4,B00IXPQUCQ,"I just watched Mirage Men for the first time and found it to be very interesting and thought-provoking. As an editor of a UFO newsletter in the late 1990s, I conducted an e-mail interview with Richard Doty discussing a number of different UFO incidents. I thought it would be useful to hear what he had to say, even though I suspected that some of his answers contained disinformation. With Doty, it's hard to know what is true and what is a lie. This becomes very clear when watching the film. If someone acknowledges that they were involved in spreading government disinformation, how could you ever trust anything they have to say?

And yet, I was intrigued with Doty's account of the Roswell crash in the film, which I believe to be an accurate depiction of what occurred in terms of two crash sites and the second crash site only being discovered in 1949. And his description of an AFOSI briefing on UFOs and aliens he said he received in the 1970s meshes with other accounts by whistleblowers of similar briefings. Was he actually telling the truth about what took place in the briefing? Possibly yes, but it's impossible to know for sure.

The film covers all of the key disinformation activities Doty was involved with in the 1980s, including the tragic Paul Bennewitz affair, the role of ufologist Bill Moore, and the alleged presidential briefing document shown to Linda Moulton Howe. It also covers the MJ-12 documents, Dulce, the Holloman AFB landing film, and even the more recent Project Serpo alleged government-alien exchange program controversy. It's my opinion that the disinformation was used to keep UFO researchers away from critical UFO-related programs, rather than non-UFO related advanced technology programs. For example, Bennewitz apparently stumbled onto the NSA's Project Sigma at Kirtland AFB in New Mexico, an ongoing project to communicate with aliens! He was targeted with UFO disinformation to protect this UFO-related project. Also, Linda Howe was targeted with disinformation to undermine her investigation into alien animal mutilations. In my opinion the film is well worth seeing and I recommend it strongly.",1514505600,,2146,5.09375
