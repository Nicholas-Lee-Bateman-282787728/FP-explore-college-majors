Better than a dam REALLITY Show!!!!",1391731200,,116,4.476190476190476
1412469,5,B00005AACP,"Louis Gosset Jr is outstanding in this movie.  This movie is a classic. I encourage all of you to purchase it and sit back and enjoy everthing out it.  My DVD player UP-converts; thus this really looked wonderful.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Inspectors-2-A-Shred-of-Evidence/dp/B00005AAA5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Inspectors 2 - A Shred of Evidence</a>",1357430400,,403,7.375
1412470,4,B00005AACP,Good movie; gets going a little slowly but if you hang in there... Solid.  Can't beat Lou Gossit Jr. and I'm becoming a Jonathan Silverman fan as well after the Weekend @ Bernies. I prefer him in this genre of films.,1268870400,,216,4.2682926829268295
1412471,4,B00005AACP,"Great follow up to ""The Inspectors"". If you enjoyed it, you will definitely want to catch this one. I bought both based on reviews here at Amazon and I was not disappointed. Quite the contrary in fact. I found both movies very enjoyable entertainment. The acting is great, and the story, directing, and camera work are first rate. This movie revolves around identity theft. A ring of identity thieves is uncovered when one accidentally dies in a car accident. The investigation unfolds to a leader that is not only smart but deadly. I truly wish this had been a TV series or they made more movies. I think there are many more stories that could be told about the United States Postal Inspectors. This is another Showtime movie with good production values. Excellent quality DVD and great replayability.",1208736000,2,802,4.818840579710145
1412472,5,B00005AACP,Outstanding and realistic portrayal of agents of the oldest federal law enforcement agency. Quick moving story based on actual case files. A very good procedural show on how cases are investigated in the federal system. Gosset and Silverman capture the personalities of Postal Inspectors and the tenacity they exhibit when solving cases. Michael Madsen as the bad guy -- what more do you need to say!,1162684800,,400,5.075757575757576
1412473,5,B00005AACP,"This was a great movie!  It was suspense, action, and comedy all rolled into one.  The two main characters have a great rapport, and the plot is very realistic.  Identity theft is the fastest growing crime in the U.S. and something we are all easily susceptible to.  If nothing else, this movie will teach you to buy a shredder to dispose of all your junk mail.  :-)

I also enjoyed the first Inspectors movie, but found this one to be alot more interesting.  The Postal Inspection Service is a fascinating agency - they are a federal law enforcement agency, equal to the FBI and DEA in power and prestige.  Though smaller in size (only about 2000 agents nationwide), they have the highest conviction rate and have been in existence longer than any other federal agency.

If you are interested in the Inspection Service, I would also recommend the Discovery Channel documentary titled ""The Feds - U.S. Postal Inspectors.""  Its a little hard to find and only available on VHS at this point, but very interesting.  One of the stories told in the documentary was the inspiration for the first Inspectors movie.",1135987200,,1107,4.7434554973821985
1412474,4,B00005AACP,"This movie is a gem. IT goes away from the old cliche of ""expert investigator with a novice investigator"".Instead of it, both Gousset and Silverman has solid roles and the chemistry between them is amazing. Madsen plays a terrific bad guy, also withou customary cliches. All in all, it's a simple and atisfying movie that does not try to be more than it is.",995068800,4,357,4.59375
1412475,4,B00005AACP,"This is the second in an underrated series about the U.S. Postal Inspectors. While the first movie was a little over the top what with its focus on letterbombing, this sequel covers the frightening new crime of identity theft. Michael Madsen is terrific as the criminal, but Lou Gossett really shines as the cliched but true character of a lawman who has seen it all.",992217600,3,367,4.661538461538462
1412476,5,B00005AACP,"This movie covers a crime most people know nothing about.  Indentity fraud.  At least they don't know about it until it's too late.  The Inspectors did a great job by adding Michael Madsen (many gangster movies, THe Big Apple) to the cast.  He always play an excellent bad guy and doesn't let you down here.  I see an Inspectors 3 in the future.",987465600,3,345,4.412698412698413

7935102,5,B00005AACP,"This film deals with ""Identity theft"", and that it is not a victimless crime. The people who steal your information, be it from the internet, or your mail, are not harmless. If they see you are trying to break their rice bowl, they won't stop at anything to stop any authority pursuing them. They ain't nice people. I hope they make an Inspectors 3. J.
