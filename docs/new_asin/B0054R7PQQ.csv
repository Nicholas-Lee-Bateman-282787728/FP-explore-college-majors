4570653,3,B0054R7PQQ,"Fake, paid, 5-star reviews have become rampant on Amazon (and Yelp, and other online sites -- there are companies that specialize in selling fake online ""reviews"").

Now, THE GRUDGE, the first of the series, deserves 5 stars. It's one of my Top Five horror films of this century's first decade (2000 to 2009). However, the sequels are dreadful. Number 2 is really bad, and number 3 is (astonishing, but true), even worse. So as an average, the two sequels really drag down the original's 5 stars. I'm being VERY generous giving this set 3 stars, considering the two turkeys in it.

The original is a masterpiece of horror. Innovative, in that it introduced a new ghost concept to American audiences, one that became a cliche -- a pale white girl, crawling about in herky-jerky fashion, with stringy black hair covering her face. Yeah, it might already have been a cliche in Japan, but THE GRUDGE popularized it in the U.S. (even more so than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ring/dp/B00AEFYYH6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ring</a>).

I love THE GRUDGE's use of sound and music. Sarah Michelle Geller finds a boy sealed up inside a closet. Nothing inherently scary about that event, yet the filmmaker's use of sound and music convey Geller's terror. Her character later tells a detective that, though there was nothing actually strange (logically) in the house, from the moment she entered, she sensed that something was ""not right."" Through sound and editing and lighting, the film effectively conveys this ""feeling"" to the audience, to the extent that we feel it too.

Editing and staging are also brilliant, especially when Geller sees the ghosts of previous owners -- I discuss this use of editing and staging, with selected stills from THE GRUDGE, in in my book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Horror-Film-Aesthetics-Creating-The-Visual-Language-of-Fear/dp/0786449721/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Horror Film Aesthetics: Creating The Visual Language of Fear</a>.

However, the sequels are dreadful. Done on lower budgets. With none of the original's artistry, or atmosphere, or originality. None of the original's taking advantage of its Japanese locations. (In the original film, we sense the American characters psychological dislocation over being strangers in a strange land, which heightens their anxieties over the ghosts.)

The GRUDGE sequels are as dreadful and impoverished (impoverished in both budget and creativity) as those awful&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mimic/dp/B0077PTWCI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mimic </a>&nbsp;sequels. Just going through the motions, in clunky fashion, on a low budget.

Instead of buying this 3-film GRUDGE set, I recommend you instead buy a used Blu-Ray edition of GRUDGE, which seems to be selling pretty cheaply. Then rent these sequels on the cheap, if you're really curious. Although after seeing #2, you won't look forward to #3. I only watched #3 out of curiosity and optimism -- but my optimism did not pay off.",1441670400,5,3103,5.851769911504425
