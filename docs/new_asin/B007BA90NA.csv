8513725,5,B007BA90NA,Love this! I wished there were more? I'm not able to find additional seasons where season 2 took off? There was a prior taping that had many seasons...I found this one first. I hope they will continue this particular group because they literally stopped right at the start of the German Blitz and now I don't know what happens to the characters.,1422576000,3,345,4.580645161290323
8513726,5,B007BA90NA,"This is an awesome series. Love watching it. I have an all regional DVD player to watch it on, and it's well worth it. For all you wishing you could order a DVD but don't because it's in the non-usa format....do yourselves a favor and just buy an all regional DVD player. I got mine for under $55. brand new (from Amazon.com) and that's all I use now. I can watch any movie with any format on it. Upstairs Downstairs.....great story plot.",1410998400,2,438,4.353658536585366
