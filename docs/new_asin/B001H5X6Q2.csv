3624198,5,B001H5X6Q2,"We have several other Elmo DVD's, including the Pets, and Great Outdoors and others...but this is by far my 16 month old daughters favorite one! When REM plays she jumps and claps, its so funny.",1328400000,,194,4.571428571428571
3624199,5,B001H5X6Q2,"We're relatively new to the Elmo movie world, but we LOVE this video.  It's so much more interesting and tolerable than most of the Elmo's World material.  It's got fabulous entertainers on it, great songs and scenes, awesome energy.  It's the only DVD that I look forward to watching with him.  Definitely 5 stars!",1288828800,,315,4.777777777777778
3624200,3,B001H5X6Q2,"My 17-month-old son loves Elmo. This video is good, but we prefer ""Best of Elmo 2.""",1283731200,,83,4.25
3624201,1,B001H5X6Q2,This dvd contains 5-10 minutes of new footage but is mostly recycled old Sesame Street clips (without Elmo in them).  My 2 year old Elmo-obsessed daughter was not interested at all and asked to watch another movie instead.,1259107200,4,222,4.842105263157895
3624202,5,B001H5X6Q2,"Our two year old grandson loves Sesame Street and Elmo, and the Valentine's Day DVD is no exception.  The story line is easy for him to follow with his favorite characters.  This was a winner for us to watch more of ""Mo.""",1237420800,,221,4.238095238095238

watches it often.",1234569600,,88,4.5625
3624204,5,B001H5X6Q2,"We rented this DVD and it's really cute! Both my 18-month-old (who is currently obsessed with Elmo) and 5-year-old loved it and neither of them minded any old material, because kids don't know or care about thiat kind of stuff. They wanted to watch it over and over again.",1232323200,4,272,4.571428571428571
3624205,4,B001H5X6Q2,"Only 10-15 minutes of new Elmo material. All the rest is 10 years old or older. REM and Trisha Yearwood are from Season 30 (1998). Not your typical Elmo's World video. I was disappointed. BUT!!--It was all new to my toddler, and the old bit with Grover asking children to explain ""love"" is very sweet. Worth adding to your Elmo collection, but don't get too excited about ""all-new"" material. I'd also recommend picking it up at your local Wal-mart for $9.99, instead of paying Amazon $12.99 (as of 01/13/09).",1231804800,10,508,4.719101123595506

3624228,5,B001H5X6Q2,"Placing your child in front of television for any extended duration of time is never a good thing especially within the first five years of their lives,  Although if you or your significant others need a brief reprieve then this is the video to give you the time to recover your energy.",1401062400,,286,4.5
3624229,4,B001H5X6Q2,Daughter asks to watch this one over and over.  She loves Elmo and loves the whole Valentine's Day theme with all the love and hearts and what not.  Good dvd!,1358380800,,158,4.233333333333333

3624231,5,B001H5X6Q2,"What a delightful video for preschoolers.  Our grandchildren are 15 months and 19 months, and they both adore this video.  I like it because it explains different kinds of love:  loving friends and loving your mommy and your daddy!  How do you show it, giving hugs to mommy and daddy.  The language is understandable to a tiny child.  Elmo's valentine heart blows away, and Elmo chases it!  This tiny bit of drama is just the right amount to make the story enjoyable!  Avery and Charley don't tire of this Elmo video.  We have watched it many, many times!!!",1356652800,,557,4.6020408163265305

3624235,3,B001H5X6Q2,My 18 month daughter loves Elmo. This video is good but doesn't have the same format as her other Elmo videos so she doesn't get to try to sing the songs and such. Still worth the $.,1328572800,,182,3.945945945945946
