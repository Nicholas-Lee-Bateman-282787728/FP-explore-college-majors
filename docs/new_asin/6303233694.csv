8589689,4,6303233694,"This was the 1st episode of the series that really hit the ""fantastical"" aspects of the series.  It started 2 draw away from the inital premise of the series, which is the co-existence of mutants  & humans 2gether....  Now, they have a new foe, Mr. Sinister, &  that is the theme of the whole 2nd season.  Wolverine & Jean's romance  is tested, as Logan is saddened by her planned marriage (I don't want 2  give the whole thing away)....
I wish there were more episode on the  tape, but a solid series is indeed a solid series....",960595200,3,530,4.391752577319588
