97698,5,0790729342,"A fan of action films will undoubtedly side with The Road Warrior as an all-time great.  And that person would not be wrong in doing so, either.  In  my opinion, The Road Warrior stands beside Hard-Boiled as the greatest  of all action movies.
But I think what so many people fail to consciously  recognize is how The Road Warrior stands the test of time not just as an  action film, but as a film, a term which is not limited to genres and  categories.  The Road Warrior transcends the conventional action film by  creating a completely believable setting of the cliched post-apocalyptic  world.  The setting is imperative in a film like this; and Max's world of  roads and desert wastelands is as believable as the far more popular one  that happened ""A long time ago in a galaxy far, far  away....""
The Road Warrior is not to be missed, not only by action  fans, but film fans.",922579200,,880,4.515923566878981
97699,4,0790729342,"I was quite surprised by this film, which I only saw for the first time about a week before this review was written.  I've seen a lot of early-to-mid-eighties action films, such as Commando and Invasion U.S.A.,  as well as the original Mad Max (albeit in its messed-up American version),  so I wasn't really expecting too much from this.  It completely blew me  away.  George Miller and company took aspects of some of the best genres  (e.g., samurai, western, etc.) and made a modern myth.  They also managed  to make one of the most satisfying climaxes in film history with the final  chase involving the tanker truck.",921456000,,620,4.710280373831775
97700,5,0790729342,"He has about 10 lines in the whole movie. Everyone around him is always  talking and yelling, but Max says nothing.
This is still the world's best  action film, and in widescreen, it makes more sense because you can see  what's really going on in every shot.
I remember reading as a kid that  this film was made for about $4 million, which was huge compared to the  original Mad Max budget. Kevin Costner and James Cameron should learn some  lessons from Kennedy/Miller",917568000,,469,4.590361445783133
97751,4,0790729342,"Thunderdome is second best. Fury Road is ridiculously pointless and everything in it, it owes to this one. What's to say?

With the ""Fast and Furious"" sequels, the producers seem to believe things can only get better if the stunts get more ridiculous and impossible.  The best ""Fast and Furious"" film to me is still the first one.  You can actually tell there is a guy hanging off the side of a truck.  The stunts are real.  They do not rely on computer graphics.

97782,5,0790729342,"Books could be (and likely have been) written about what makes ""Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior"" such a great movie: George Miller's unique vision of a dystopian wasteland filmed to perfection in the Australian outback, a litany of well thought-out characters even among bit players, the oft-copied but rarely duplicated way that Miller manages to set the mood repeatedly with little if any dialogue, and of course the cars and epic chase sequences.  What you end up with is perhaps the perfect post-apocalyptic story: a lone man who lives by scavenging in the wastelands, hardened by the events of the first ""Mad Max"" film, and still driving the last of the V8 police interceptors.  A series of events quickly leads him to an ethical crossroads: does he stay with the band of ""civilized"" people fruitlessly guarding the last working oil pump and refinery for who knows how far, against the band of marauders camped at their gates?  Does he make a temporary bargain and run off with his small reward from them to once more disappear into the wastelands?  Or can he find another option?  The answer is well worth the time spent reaching it.

Spoilers follow, so if you haven't watched this yet, do please stop reading. :)

There is so much more to this movie than even the most detailed reviews here will reveal.  The symbolism throughout: the distant raven's cry heard as Max enters each scene, foretelling the death which hollowed him in the past, and follows him thereafter.  The beautiful, nuanced characters found on all sides of the conflict: the idealistic Pappagallo who leads the motley refinery crew, preaching hope and humanity all while being surrounded by death and futility; the opportunistic Gyro Captain who survives the wasteland through cunning and killing while exuding insanity from every pore, but who ultimately shines through as perhaps the most sane individual there; and perhaps the most brilliantly complex villain in non-""Batman"" film history, The Humungus, a muscle-bound behemoth who lords over a band of ruthless killers yet quotes 18th century German poetry (in German), repeatedly shows patience and practical thinking in achieving his goal, and carries around an immaculate revolver in a case filled with military medals from numerous nations.  Plus of course the scene-stealing dog (named ""Dog""), who was rescued from a local animal shelter, trained for this film, and then retired to a life of luxury with one of the cameramen.

This is barely even scraping the surface.  I've seen very convincing arguments that the entire story was a modern interpretation of ancient Greek tragedy (Miller's parents were Greek immigrants), lengthy commentaries on how avant garde the film was in casting women, homosexuals, and physically handicapped persons in strong roles (without dwelling on doing it), and of course numerous discussions on the political and environmental criticisms neatly wrapped into the back story of the picture (again, without being in-your-face about it).

In short, which truthfully would have been two paragraphs ago, this is so much more than just the quintessential post-apocalyptic action thriller, as evidenced by the numerous ""best of"" lists it continues to find itself on.  This is a testament to exactly what a talented visionary with a (very) limited budget is capable of producing, and a film which rewrote its genre and redefined exactly what a ""hero"" can be in movies.",1504224000,,3424,5.112903225806452

97785,5,0790729342,"Where are we going? Where have we already been?

Sometimes a movie is so raw it hurts. This is the case with The Road Warrior. There is a good possibility you love this movie. It's great and it's crazy. This is the second entry in the Mad Max series and the high water mark in the original trilogy.
It is, arguably the best action movie of all time.

It takes place in the twisted metal future. The original Mad Max set the tone that civilization was slipping. Part one is a great movie as well. When you watch it, you get the feeling that things aren't looking so bright. The Road Warrior took the concept to a completely different level. It completely confirms that notion presented in the original.

Max surfaces in a wasteland and discovers a commune of people striving to survive. The group is attacked by an evil gang that will stop at nothing to steal their resources: the precious juice/gasoline, that essentially fuels existence.

The gangs nightmare leader is pretty u forgettable Lord Humungus. Find a more evil character. Not possible. Max assists the survivalist to head out in the dusty wastelands to hopefully escape to find a better, safer life in the far off distance.

The car chases are violent and classic. Max is a unique one of a kind character. He cared about the good of humanity but he always made sure to look out for number one. This film has wheels.",1501891200,,1377,4.558704453441296

Special features are pretty minimal, though I'm admittedly not sure if there are other versions of this movie with more of them.  Likely not.

The audio was pretty crisp and solid.  The video was overall pretty well done, though there were a few points where it kind of showed that it's up-converted and remastered.  Still, they did a better job on it than a lot of older movies getting Blu-ray releases, that's for sure.

I'd say it's definitely worth picking up to upgrade off a VHS or DVD, and if you're just after a copy of the second Mad Max movie for the first time for your collection, the Blu-ray is probably your best option.",1465776000,,798,4.506944444444445

98049,5,0790729342,"This 1981 sequel to Mad Max is actually better than the original.  It takes place in a world where civilization has completely broken down.  Even the Main Police Force of which Max was a member in the original no longer exists.  He still has his old police car but it's all beat up.  The only remnants of civilization are roving bands which fight with each other.  There are still some working vehicles around so the main fight is over what little gasoline is available.

This sequel was filmed in the desert outback of Australia where the desolation matches the ongoing fighting.  It ditches the mushy parts in the original and basically has non-stop action.  There is very little dialogue, it's all action.  It looks realistic because it features people we can relate doing things we can relate to instead of the fantasy shown in most action movies today.

This movie also features the then new practice of adding odd characters to adventure films.  Here we have an odd character flying a gyrocopter and a feral boy who can imitate wild animals.  Nevertheless, this must be the best action movie ever made.",1464912000,3,1108,4.7434554973821985

 I appreciated the first one but The Road Warrior is where the Mad Max movies really hit their stride. A fantastic post-apocalyptic setting (Broken Hill to be precise) with crazy villains who look the part too and some of the best action scenes you will see especially the super charged finale.

The cars are more wastelandy, the dialog is better with some decent catch phrases, and the action sequences have more explosions and polish. the villain is someone you can hate without hearing a sad back story.

Glad I decided to buy it.  The picture is vastly superior.  Worth the upgrade.  My biggest complaint is that the movie starts with ""Mad Max 2"" as the title instead of ""The Road Warrior,"" which is what I saw it as when it was in theaters in the US.  Wish there was a choice, but not a ""deal-breaker"" by any means.  Also, it's divided up into only around ten scenes, so it's a bit harder to navigate.

I knew nothing about it, but the handsome young Aussie, Mel Gibson, was the hot new actor and I was intrigued by him. I thought his first big U.S. movie, The Year of Living Dangerously, was brilliant. The first Mad Max movie was too campy for my taste. This one blew me away! The premise was believable. The characters were outrageous. It became an instant Sci Fi classic that has influenced subsequent movies and even music videos.",1453593600,,515,4.431578947368421

98179,5,0790729342,"This movie is perfect. Not only is it the best of the original three, but it is also one of the most complete and killer action movies of all time. The original was very good (4/5), but it was rather slow at times. This film however, gets going almost immediately. The story is totally unique which helped craft a style way ahead of its time. Once you get into the story, it grips you til the very end. The action is intense and pretty brutal, and that's an A+ in my book.

All in all, this movie goes down with the other action EPICS liiiike.... Escape from New York, The Terminator, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Unforgiven, Dirty Harry, Alien & Aliens, Dawn of the Dead, Assault on Precinct 13, Star Wars trilogy, Die Hard trilogy, The Professional, GoldenEye, Natural Born Killers, Tombstone, North by Northwest, First Blood, The Fifth Element, Evil Dead, and so forth. A certifiable CULT CLASSIC.

But I must bring up the one thing I absolutely HATE about this movie is the Gyro Captain. He serves as the.. ugh.. ""comic relief"" in what is already something of a dark comedy. He honestly does nothing but interrupt the flow of the movie with sheer obnoxiousness. Utterly pointless and unbelievably annoying.

That's the end of my rant. Don't hesitate to buy this movie.

As for the movie, I must admit, I've had a minor obsession with it. I own a VHS copy and watched it so many times, it was unplayable. I really
enjoyed the desert post apocalyptic story it presented. It was a modern western, with a lone cowboy, a town trapped by outlaws. So if for some
reason you  have never seen this awesome movie (and perhaps not of fan of the genre but of westerns) I really suggest this movie. The plot
is a theme that has been revisited a thousands times, in stories and ballads, but beautifully played out here.",1442793600,,747,4.328571428571428

98336,5,0790729342,"I first saw this on HBO back around '83 and it blew me away! I taped it (on Betamax no less) and watched it a bunch of times. Somehow, I went until just a few years back without seeing it again. Usually a movie you find great at age 13 is not nearly as good as you recall if it's 30 years later. This one totally is! The editing, cinematography and dramatic characters give it a sort of comic book vibe (and I don't read comics) without taking Max himself too far from his original identity in the first film. It's non stop action, and unlike so many potentially great movies, this one doesn't just reel you in as one thing at the outset then try pandering to the masses with a predictable outcome or lessening violence as it moves along. It truly is awesome! One of my all time favorites. I always found this one better than Mad Max. Like, not even close to me, but I know others think differently. Up there with The Thing, First Blood, Jaws, Escape From New York, Dawn of the Dead. Oh, and another great Gibson flick that's pretty overlooked is Apocalypto. That one's great too for many of the same reasons I just stated here. Think what you will of the guy, he knows how to (usually) make good, uncompromising films.",1439596800,,1219,4.327510917030568

98397,4,0790729342,"I  like  it. You  got  the  Gyro  captain  (Bruce Spence) who  max  forces  a  partnership  with,  Kind  of  makes  him  into  a  slave,  claiming  the  fact  he'd  just  wind  up  making  a  mistake.  &  the  Humongous  guy  who  sort  of  looks  like  a  warrior on  Beast Master  or  Conan the destroyer.  &  his  gang,  which  includes  Wez (Vernon Wells) a  guy  with  an  animal  instinct  &  will  face  a  battle  head  on,  even  if  it  means  he's  staring  the  Grim reaper  in  the  face!  I  found  a  lot  of  his  faces  that  he  makes  his  expressions  annoying!  But  he  does  give  a  whole  new  meaning  to  the  word  fear,  &  would  make  a  good  Boogey man.  Max  (Mel Gibson)  has  got  to  be  about  600  miles  or  so  from  the  Halls  of  Justice  from  the  original.  Out  in  the  middle  of  nowhere  where  it  is  nearly  impossible  to  escape  the  vicious  gangs  with  your  life!  Your  lucky  if  your  not  killed  or  raped!
The  Gyro  captain  tells  Max  about  a  place  where  you  can  get  gas  as  much  as  you  like  if  they  let  you.
All  Pappy Gallo  (Mike Preston) cares  about  is  a  far  off  destination  where  they  are  safe.  &  can  live  in  peace.  So  he  tries  reasoning  with  Max.  But  Max  doesn't  want  any  part  of  their  problem,  All  he  wants  is  to  leave  &  have  his  car  back.  What  gave  Pappy Gallo  the  right  to  take  it  away  from  him  anyways?!  So  they  make  a  deal,  Max  agrees  to  bring  a  rig  big  enough  to  haul  the  gasoline.  When  they  didn't  agree  to  the  Humongous's  offer,  he  said  he'd  kill  anyone  who  tried  escaping.  The  humongous  wanted  the  whole  compound,  the  diesel  the  gasoline  &  wanted  them  to  walk  away  &  he'd  spare  their  lives.  After  a  little  maintenance  Max  fixes  up  the  rig,  the  humongous  does  try  to  destroy  it  after  he  gets  on  the  highway.
Max  gets  his  car  back  &  all  the  juice  he  can  carry.  But  doesn't  get  very  far!  His  car  tumbles  down  a  huge  hill  after  he  gets  attacked  by  Wez  &  its  destroyed  ready  for  the  junkyard.  They  kill  his  dog.  Poor  dog!  &  seeing  his  only  way  out  max  is  rescued  by  the  Gyro captain.  Was  Max  supposed  to  be  dreaming.  The  Gyro's  voice  was  real  low  as  he  said  (relax Partner)!
So  he  steps  up  (Let  me  drive  the  rig).  Didn't  have  choice.  Out  they  go!  &  they  blow  up  the  whole  compound!  &  have  the  gang  hot  on  their  tail!  Every  warrior  protecting  the  tanker  max  is  pulling  with  the  rig  gets  killed.  Pappy  Gallo  dies  too.  Shortly  afterwards  the  war  is  over,  the  incredible  chase  is  over!  The  voice  of  an  old  man  narrates  the  beginning  &  end  of  the  movie  claiming  to  be  the  Feral  kid.  Who  was  voiceless.
Afterwards  I  often  wondered  how  Max  was  gonna  travel  being  as  it  is  he  no  longer  had  his  car. &  I  do  feel  bad  for  the  loss  of  his  dog  too.  In  my  opinion  they  didn't  have  to  kill  off  the  dog.  His  mission  was  done.  But  he  was  for  sure  stranded  in  the  Wasteland!  Knowing  Max  he'd  come  up  with  a  way  to  travel.  But  his  V8  car  was  totaled.  One  thing  baffles  me.  &  old  guy  narrates  the  beginning  &  ending  of  this  movie.  Did  Max  tell  his  story  about  his  past.  As  far  as  I  know  he  didn't.  He  never  said  where  he  was  from,  &  the  plot  for  that  script  for  the  old  guy  claiming  to  be  the  talkless  ferrel  kid  is  ridiculous.  The  part  where  Max  ate  a  can  of  dog  food  is  disgusting.  Always  left  me  wondering  if  he  saved  any  of  the  food  for  the  dog.

Even though I just seen Fury Road , it lacks Max or shall I say Gibson but Ill get back to that later . Road Warrior had the elements of a good film , a fast car , a cool dog and great stunts . The budget was a lot better than Mad Max , though the costumes are like from football players. shoulder pads and such . Miller created in this chapter Max living in the wasteland  and gas is worth more than any life as this gang of marauders with Mohawks  want the fuel guard by a bunch of civilians  as Max works His way in since the fuel dump is a goldmine but the people cant get out . So the people fill up a tanker as they must try and make a break for it . Gibson must have only 30 lines in the whole film , but the car and the dog make up for it . Now  after this film came out Thunder Dome which wasn't as good as the other two and put the film on halt for any sequels till  30 years  Miller made Fury road . In that film Gibson didn't come back and Tom Hardy picked up the role . I see a few reasons why Gibson may not had come back , Max in that film is more a secondary character and  crashes His fast car within 1 minute of the driving it  an spends the next 40 minutes tied to a truck even though the stunts outdo all of the others an more with visual delight  and is a good film , it may appeal to more of the video game adults nowadays than the core audience who grew up on Max , that's just my opinion folks .Road Warrior is the best Mad Max  film with Max as the lead character. and made Gibson a international star and this film rocks .",1436313600,,1649,3.7262247838616713

98687,5,0790729342,"What is the greatest car chase scene ever made? Bullitt? Ronin? Duel? Or The French Connection? The question is hard to answer, but Mad Max 2 would not be a bad choice. If you haven't ever seen it, well, you are just missing a great thing.

If you haven't seen the original Mad Max, don't worry. You don't have to, because Mad Max 2 (aka. The Road Warrior) is sort of a stand-alone film. It is about Max Rockatansky (Mel Gibson) roaming alone in the post-apocalyptic world where civilization has collapsed and everyone fights for gasoline.

In the wasteland a group of people are defending their oil refinery from the gang of marauders led by 'Lord Humungus' (Kjell Nilsson). Max approaches to the defenders and offers help in exchange for gasoline. The story (which was perhaps inspired by Kurosawas Yojimbo) is fast-paced, and the film seldom lets up thanks to director George Millers skillful storytelling.

The film is full of interesting characters including the Gyro Captain (Bruce Spence) the Feral Kid (Emil Minty) and a motorcycle rider Wez (Vernon Wells), one of the most memorable villains in the movie history. The beautiful cinematography by Dean Semler (who went on to win Oscar for his work for Dances with Wolves) is another plus.

But of course, the Australian film has been remembered for its terrific car action and you will be amazed at the dangerous stunts. This is how an action movie should be like. Please watch the movie and you will not be disappointed.",1432166400,,1479,4.811023622047244

This is the film where everyone fell in love with Mel Gibson. He was absolutely gorgeous and heroic. He was in a post apocalypse society and fighting with the bad guys at every turn. They all were in road vehicles and used downed vehicles to get their gas. But that was about all that was left. He also has a great dog who sits shotgun with him throughout his driving scenes.

There are great villains in this movie too. This is edge of your seat action and the minutes absolutely fly by.

It is almost impossible to believe that Mel Gibson has become such a hated figure today. Some of his drunken ramblings were posted online which his then girlfriend had taped (while he was divorcing his wife). He sounded like a complete and utter wreck. This was a guy who had everything. It is really very sad and it seems likely he will just eventually die of his alcoholism.

98813,5,0790729342,"The post-apocalypse action movie that has come to define the look and feel of almost every post-nuclear apocalypse story since (I'm looking at you Fallout). Sparse dialogue, music, just pure story-telling through environment. Seriously, other than the voice over in the beginning and end, and some general lines most Road Warrior's story-telling is done through costumes, sets, action-set pieces, just the very look and feel of the movie. And it is awesome. There is a reason that almost every post-apocalypse looks like Mad Max (the leather, the repurposed hockey pads, the vague S&M gear, the mohawks, etc) and that reason is that Mad Max made the look 112% effective by crafting a near perfect film using these sparse elements. It is nothing short of glorious.",1430956800,,763,5.112
98814,5,0790729342,"As a child of the 1980's there were two go-to action films when you hit the local video store; ""Die Hard"" and ""The Road Warrior"". Nothing beat getting together with your buddies for a night of mayhem with Mad Max and John McClane. When I first saw the original ""Mad Max"" film I was too young to appreciate the raw aesthetic of the film, and found it kind of slow, but there was nothing slow about ""The Road Warrior"" and it still stands as one of my favorite films.

Amping up the kinetic energy found in Miller's original film, ""The Road Warrior"" takes up a few years after the events of the first film. Max is cruising the highway, more of a loner than vigilante, and it seems the final threads of society have finally unwound. Gas is now a precious resource, and in the Australian outback, gangs now rule the land. ""The Road Warrior"" begins much like the first film as Max is fighting off a band of marauders in a frantic high speed chase. The car carnage is back and shown in Miller's distinctive style, Max deals with this small group of would-be scavengers. The action only takes a pause as Max stops to soak up the last few drops of gas dripping from a wrecked vehicle. It's not long before Max is on the move again, and he finds a refinery. Unfortunatley the refinery is under siege by a large gang lead by a huge hockey mask wearing guy called The Hummungus?!?!

The action is non-stop, the carnage filmed in imaginitve and creative ways, and once again, Miller keeps his foot on the pedal when it comes to camera movement and creative shots. Just a fun action movie, with no CGI, no geen-screen special F/X, just good old stunt work and excellent direction. Highly recommended.",1430870400,,1686,4.470779220779221

98841,5,0790729342,"The ultimate post-apocalypse movie!  If you have not seen Mad Max 2 (a.k.a. The Road Warrior) then you have missed out on one of the best sci-fi action films ever made.  This Blu-ray has a great price and offers a pristine letterbox version of the movie which is essential to take in the stellar cinematography of Academy Award Winner Dean Semler as well as the incredible 13-minute action sequence finale.  Movies like Mad Max 2 are not made anymore.  This film was made with no special effects trickery or CGI, everything is 100% practical and 100% dangerous.  The movie is a terrific homage to classic Western movies like Shane and Eastwood's No Name Trilogy where a drifter gets entangled in a situation that will end up turning him into a hero/savior.  It earns my highest recommendation.

This Blu-ray is light on extras but there is a audio commentary with director George Miller and an introduction from film critic Leonard Maltin.  Recently the podcast Don & his Amazing Friend also did an online audio commentary of the movie which brought additional information about the rare sequel that raises the bar on the original.

98846,5,0790729342,"If the original ""Mad Max"" is ""Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope,"" then ""The Road Warrior"" is ""The Empire Strikes Back."" Rolling with the success of his previous film, director George Miller got the support of a major studio, creative freedom and a substantially larger budget to bring his sequel to life. ""The Road Warrior"" is bigger than its predecessor in just about every way and becomes one of those rare cases in cinema where the sequel is even better than the original.

The film takes place after the events of the previous film, wherein rogue patrolman Max (Mel Gibson) roams the highways of the desolate future with only his dog by his side. When he gets mixed up in a feud over some much-needed fuel, he finds himself re-connecting with his human side in an effort to help out the less fortunate. After all, you never want to see perfectly nice people get murdered by a man in assless leather chaps.

Gibson himself has less to say and more to do this time around, and yet oozes a great deal of charm and charisma. He is joined by a gaggle of new characters that includes (but is not limited to) a rabid rugrat appropriately named The Feral Kid and an unlikely sidekick with bad teeth who goes by the name The Gyro Captain, and not because he's a big fan of greek sandwiches. The plot is admittedly thin, but no matter. The action and the incredible set-pieces are the true star of the show. ""The Road Warrior"" is a true action picture, run through a Western filter. At some point, the characters stop doing that thing they do with their mouths and just let the action speak for itself. The last 30 minutes contains just a few sentences of dialogue, making room for some of the most epic and over-the-top action this side of the 1980s. ""The Road Warrior"" is, in a word, crazy -- and not the kind of bad crazy that its star would come to embody thirty years later.",1429488000,,1872,4.438953488372093

Its motifs and tropes have been emulated time and again, spawning numerous derivatives (we wouldn't have Tank Girl, for example, without Mad Max) as well as an annual festival in the California desert called Wasteland Weekend.  The film is such a classic by now that to review it is almost redundant.  Suffice it to say, if you've seen it recently, you know how good it is.  If it's been a while, give it another look:  I've seen this movie dozens of times, and it holds up remarkably well.  Every time I watch it, I notice another little detail, or a moment I had forgotten.  Sure, it's a bit dated, but unlike computer-generated special effects or rubber prosthetics, this is a movie made of leather and steel, fire and dust, all of which age very well indeed.

99067,5,0790729342,"Mad Max was an awesome movie in so many ways: it gave the world a new superstar, Mel Gibson, it wowwed with high-speed footage despite its low budget, and it moved us emotionally despite its simple premise.

The Road Warrior has a lot of expectations to match, and it does it by shifting gears: it ups the ante on the post-apocalyptic world (probably with the appearance of a much bigger budget for costumes, setting, explosions, and most importantly four-wheeled destruction). It also expands the range of sub-characters, and gives us something new - a flying machine!!

This film takes away Gibson's dialogue and emotional range, turning him into a John Rambo or Dirty Harry (or maybe Michael Meyers/Jason Vorhees) of Australia's post-apocalyptic desert world, but Max here at least comes up with a mission in life, which is to help a team of scientists escape siege by a brutal gang of desert marauders dressed in punk gladiator bondage gear. Great final 20 minutes of battle, cool side-kick (the Feral Kid), nice dog companion (for a while, at least), and two surprises at the ending. Loved it.

One thing that's not a surprise is the demise of the Humongus, who meets a similar end to The Toecutter (sans bugging-out eyes, though... too bad).

It will be interesting to see what the 2015 revisit to the Mad Max series, Fury Road, will be like, as it will the the first film without Mel Gibson in it! ""In a post-apocalyptic wasteland, loner Max meets Furiosa, a woman who wishes to cross the desert"". The film has lingered in development hell for 25 years, with Gibson apparently losing interest in the project in 2000 when he was at the height of his powers; things are different today, and it would make sense for the disgraced star to go back to Australia to make a film with his earliest collaborators, but it looks like even they don't want/need him. Let's see how it turns out - here's hoping it isn't a disaster like the fourth Indiana Jones film, which was also a revisit after many years away. I hope it turns out to be more like The Road Warrior, though, and less like the inferior Beyond Thunderdome!

Beware - this version has no bonus features of note; Mad Max, at least, comes with the full gamut of cool items, including commentary, movie posters, etc.",1416009600,,2271,4.681704260651629

99205,4,0790729342,"The Road Warrior is pure action filmmaking. Pure action, like pure horror, should be purely visual. The action film should not rely on dialogue but on images. The Road Warrior remains the ultimate model for the action film. It is representative of everything that is great about the genre. It uses the medium the way it was intended, the way it best serves a story, through images. There is something wholly pure about it on a very basic filmmaking level. It is easily a great action film ever made because of the audacity of its images, but it is the best action film because its audacious images are presented lyrically, for they are rhythmically sound and poetically able, and powerfully revealing and otherworldly in both communication and conveyance. Action filmmaking should be regarded as a supremely visualist venture. The Road Warrior tells everything visually.

The Road Warrior mythologizes Max. This adds a whole 'nother level of wonderment to the piece. The Road Warrior makes Max the stuff inherent of mythology, like a long gone hero of the ancient world. As if told by Homer, by the storied bard himself, of Max's myth. From the very beginning, Max is presented as folklore and legend. This is how the story first unfolds. It first shows itself in the guise of epic myth. What follows is a manic fable of truly heroic deeds, misfortunes, and triumphs.

The central themes of heroism, self identity, absurdism, survival, hope and soul are all carefully constructed, idealized, and expressed. Several of these themes are inherent of the post-apocalyptic nightmare but others are wholly unique to the film's whims. Self identity and absurdism are entirely distinctive qualities of The Road Warrior. Self identity is expressed by Max, and how he doesn't long for one yet wars with his undying sense of self. Is a greater understanding of self beneficial to one's survival? The problem of self identity is also expressed by the world itself. The dark and twisted wasteland. Unsure of its place in this misbegotten new age, the environment itself seems uncertain of it's boundaries and desired characteristics. The theme of absurdism is rampant in The Road Warrior. As Camus once said, ""Existence is illusory and it is eternal"". The film meditates on absurdism and adopts it in a manner philosophically transitory. Shifting beliefs and allegiances, self discoveries, abound and alter the path to enlightenment. Forever carving out the highway on which The Road Warrior treads.",1407542400,,2486,5.075794621026895

99242,4,0790729342,"MAD MAX 2: THE ROAD WARRIOR is about on-par with the first, slightly edging it out due to increased focus on character (even if the plot is about as thin) and bigger, more spectacular stunts.

 This time, the world (or at least Australia) is in the full-on post-apocalypse and looks like a desolate wasteland, for the most part. Biker gangs still roam the countryside, only now they're more vicious and more outlandish as far as their fashion choices go. It looks they got their clothes from an S&M shop sometimes. They also rape and pillage as they hunt for that precious commodity, gasoline. Max has also changed since we last saw him. He's more grizzled and looks almost war-weary, and instead of policing he's been reduced to scavenging like everyone else. The only difference between him and the others is his code. On his travels he meets a group of survivors guarding a treasure trove of gasoline, only they don't have the means to transport it. So they enlist his help, all while being threatened (and eventually attacked) by a vicious gang led by a freak named Humongous.

 Story-wise, the movie was about as thin as the last one. However, this time there are more characters and a smattering of humor as well. The characters that stood out the most to me were the Gyro Captain and one of the gang members with a red mohawk. There was also a feral child who provides some of the film's more endearing moments, and forms somewhat of a bond with Max. Generally speaking, I thought that the ensemble nature of this film is what makes it work. Sure, the stunts and special effects are excellent (and improved), but it was nice that the film didn't just rely on those elements to tell the story.

 Still, I do have a couple minor complaints. First, it looked like some of the action sequences were sped up. This might be too much of a nitpick, but it gave off a silent film vibe that didn't exactly mesh with the overall tone of the film as a whole. Second, it took until about the halfway point for the narrative to really take shape and gain some focus. Not that there wasn't anything to like beforehand, but (and this is where my expectations were a little undercut) I was led to believe that the film would be a little more singular and direct than it actually turned out to be.

 Still, I thought that the film and world it established were very well-realized. Also worthy of mention is the rousing score by Brian May (not of Queen). Overall, this post-apocalyptic action film isn't quite what I expected (but closer than what the last one turned out to be), but it's a fun ride that doesn't pander to the lowest common denominator of the audience. Highly recommended.",1407024000,,2677,4.5741127348643005

99272,5,0790729342,"I first saw this film in a theater back in September of 1983.  I remember thinking, wow.  I can safely say I had never seen anything like it.  It was like some demented western without the horses.  Freaky characters, frenetic action, a reluctant hero.  The plot involves the struggle to find oil/petrol so nomadic marauders can continue to drive their vehicles in search of food and more fuel.  As luck (or plot device) would have it, there just happened to be an isolated oil refinery in the middle of a wasteland.  The intrepid antihero Mad Max stubbles across it with the forced aid of the Gyro Captain.  It's under siege.  Everyone wants what everyone else has.  And yes, Max wants his share of it also.  It's a world of mercenaries.
Mad Max 2 (The Road Warrior) is an exciting movie.  The camerawork is outstanding.  It has a certain undeniable style going for it that I could well appreciate.  Yes, the plot is a little worn-out from overuse in many a western.  There isn't much in the way of dialog.  Most of the characters have no redeeming qualities; this is humanity at its lowest, desperate to survive.  In this instance, the meek do not inherit the Earth.  This is a world for the savage and the sneaky.  My favorite character is the Gyro Captain (played by Bruce Spence).  I kind of wanted to know what his recipe for snake was but he never bothered to share it.",1401494400,,1375,4.512195121951219

99379,5,0790729342,"Much as I hate the later Mel Gibson, I love this paradigmic film. Made in 1981, Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior represents the apotheosis of a certain genre of Australian films devoted to cars and more specifically to wrecking them.  Director George Miller saw the elements of a great story in the tradition of old American westerns and the mono myth in this bleak tale of a beleaguered oil refining community that seeks to break out of their enclave and move to more hospitable surroundings.  See John Ford's immaculate Wagon Train for a similar film about pilgrims led by a flawed hero.  The adversaries in this film are a biker gang on steroids, anarchy made flesh, if you will, with war paint,  mohawks, lots of leather and custom cars and bikes. They rape, murder, and steal.  Enter Max and his wacky sidekick, the gyro captain, a pair more deranged than almost any save for Blondie and Tuco in the Good, the Bad and the Ugly.  Max seeks only more gas, a philosophical position of total nihilism. unwilling to engage in any sort of communitarianism with the white-clad denizens of Texaco Prime (or whatever you want to call it), Max engages only with a Feral child who is equally empty. A nearly wordless film, Miller, like the greatest of directors, manages to work with visuals to tell his story (an art seemingly lost in the current cinema with the possible exception of Nicholas Winding Refn), combining epic sweeps of desolate landscapes with tightly edited chase sequences, including  the bravura climax of the film.  I can't help think that CGI has hurt storytelling somewhat.  I have yet to see a CGI film with the primal energy of the Road Warrior.  Now, remastered, the film looks as good as it did on the big screen back in 1981.  I still pine after Virginia Hey, the warrior woman who dies on the tanker truck.  Certainly as good or even better than most Sci-Fi post apocalyptic dystopian films.  Too bad Miller didn't work in this vein more often.  Alas Beyond Thunderdome hasn't the focus or energy of this film.  A world masterpiece from that brief time when Australia produced some excellent films.",1376524800,4,2115,4.709239130434782

Lord Humongous remains one of the most intimidating bad guys you're likely to see in a movie. The stunt work and car chases are top notch. Gibson shows just enough of the character's humanity to make him sympathetic but not enough to make him unrealistic for the harsh world in which he lives.

99485,5,0790729342,"Addendum to my review of the inferior 2007 blu-ray (Max against blue and orange clouds on the cover). This review is for the superior 2013 remastered blu-ray (Max against grayish clouds on the cover):

Warner gets it right this time! The color saturation in this Australian ""Mad Max 2"" print is still a bit dull compared to the richer color of the American ""Road Warrior"" print Warner used to make the old 1996 DVD, which I think, minus the resolution of blu-ray, is still a perfectly fine transfer, but the color timing is thankfully toward the warm end of that old transfer and away from the cold blueish tint of the inferior 2007 blu-ray transfer.

I reckon this is as good as this film is going to look on blu-ray. Dean Semler's ""magic hour"" (before dawn and after dusk) cinematography is once again a pleasure to look at, and the night scene when the Feral kid makes wolf calls to distract the baddies from killing Max is once again DARK, as it should be, not as dark as I remember it being in cinemas, but still pretty dark!

Best of all, the 5.1 surround mix containing the omnipotent 360-degree surround effects has been reinstated.  Superb!

Avoid the 2007 blu-ray like the plague. It is a sub-par transfer. Read my comments below:

+++++

While I love this film, I am not happy with the blu-ray of this action masterpiece. While the Aussie ""Mad Max 2"" print has plenty of detail, it lacks the rich, saturated color and contrast of the print used for the earlier ""Road Warrior"" American print used for the DVD. It looks like a work-print rather than a first-generation print made right off the original camera negative, which is what Warner should be using.

There appears to be a limited exposure lattitude/contrast range between highlights and shadows in this print. The blue Aussie skies look mostly white, and the night scene when Max accidentally falls into a crevase and drops the gas cans he's been carrying alerting the Lord Humongous' dogs of war, and the Feral kid distracts one of the nasties by making wolf calls, looks unnecessarily brightened up to the point where there is horrendous grain visible swimming around and the left side of the screen is faded blue.  Horrible!

To top it off, the soundtrack, while discreet stereo and very clean, seems to have lost its omnipotent 360-degree surround effects that are present in the 1997 Warner DVD. This is especially evident in the shot just preceding coming out of the blower in the beginning, when we are propelled head-over-heals from the past mono prologue back-story into stereo surround present, what would be a spectacular effect!  Gyro's helicopter coming in from the surrounds and in various fly-bys is also gone.

Hopefully, Warner will put out some mondo edition of this release in the future, which will, hopefully, include both this Aussie ""Mad Max 2"" version AND the American ""Road Warrior"" version, with all the special features of this release plus some new ones, and, hopefully, the American Road Warrior version will be from a better print, as this Australian print is inferior.

Creatively, the only differences between the ""Mad Max 2"" and ""Road Warrior"" versions of this film are:

1) The opening zoomed-in title in the Aussie version says ""Mad Max 2"" and the design of the title looks cheesy like the original ""Mad Max"" title.  The superior zoomed-in ""Road Warrior"" title is in chrome with a flare across it.

There are two more moments of ""ultra-violence"":

2) There are two additional shots of Wez, Humungus' lead ""dog of war"", pulling the steel crossbow arrow out of his arm, a shot of the arrow tugging at his severed flesh and a shot of his face reacting to the pain, which the American MPAA apparently thought were too gory and painful, so they had director George Miller excise them from the American ""Road Warrior"" print.

3) A closeup shot of the boomerang that the Feral kid threw in Wez's boy-toy's head, another shot the American MPAA also apparently thought was too gory.

Otherwise, the ""Mad Max 2"" and ""Road Warrior"" versions of the film are identical, and I'm perfectly happy with the American ""Road Warrior"" print.  Looks like I'll be holding onto my old Warner DVD, as minus the resolution of high-def, I find it to be a better presentation of the film!",1344902400,2,4263,4.758480325644505

99509,5,0790729342,"Movies don't get more exciting and heart-pounding than George Miller's The Road Warrior (1981). Released theatrically in the same year as Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), The Road Warrior is every bit as influential and exhilarating as Steven Spielberg's cliffhanger bonanza. That it was made on a meager budget of $4 million proves that great movies can succeed on quality, not quantity.

As every action fan knows, The Road Warrior is the sequel to the apocalyptic original, Mad Max (1979). In the original, Mel Gibson played as a patrol cop who lost his wife and child due to a brutal gang and exact vengeance on them Charles Bronson-style. In the sequel, Max, along with a feisty mutt, goes on the run, searching for gasoline to keep his car going while avoiding dangerous outsiders who control the alluring highways. Max comes across a band of rebels, whose attempts to escape to safer, higher ground have been thwarted and imprisoned in an oil refinery thanks to a sinister motorcycle gang led by the evil Humungous. In exchange for gas, Max offers his service to the band. But like Ethan Edwards from The Searchers, in doing so, Max discovers something that he lost a long time ago...his own humanity.

I've stated many times that The Road Warrior is a great action movie. But words cannot describe how exciting and well-done the action scenes are. But I'll do the best I can in that regard. The opening scene where Max encounters Wez and his posse is riveting enough but the scenes where Max drives a semi-truck back to the compound while dealing with the motorcycle gang and is ambushed after ending his services with the band are also exciting.

Then there's the final car chase where Max uses a trucker as a decoy to lure Humungous and his army away from the escaping oil marauders. Joining the pantheon of great movies with great car chases such as Bullitt (1968), The French Connection (1971), Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Diva (1982) and Speed (1994), this final car chase is simply mind-blowing. At the hands of an amateur exploitation director, the action scenes would come across looking confusing and sloppy but thanks to Miller's tight direction, great pacing and exceptional editing, these action scenes are both easy-to-follow and engaging without being overwhelming to a normal moviegoer.

But to talk about the action is to overlook the acting and visuals, which are also the key ingredients to the movie's success. Cinematographer Dean Semler, who would go on photograph the likes of City Slickers (1991), Dances With Wolves (1991) and Apocalypto (2006), creates an apocalyptic Australia, a vast world of desert landscapes and empty highways where danger lurks behind every intersection. The costumes and makeup are also stylish, with the punk mow-hawk elements worn by Humungous' army being the standout. Humungous, in particular, looks like a real menace with his hockey mask, lack of wardrobe and his enormous muscle mass. Like Star Wars, the technical staff in The Road Warrior successfully bring to life a ""used future"", a future that is neither pristine or polished but gritty and cynical, appropriate to the movie's apocalyptic theme and setting.

Because the movie conveys the meaning and acting through visual means, it's no surprise that dialogue is not heavily emphasized here. It's actually a smart move by the filmmakers because the dramatic scenes wind up being more resonant as a result. In a scene before Max and the obnoxious gyro captain enters the oil refinery, the two look down on the carnage ignited by Wez's gang on a group of innocent bystanders. As the gyro captain looks on, we see one of the gang members shoot an arrow at the woman who is offscreen. The scene then cuts to gyro captain's reaction and his horrified reaction speaks volumes. Similarly, Max spends less time talking than observing his surroundings and thinking about his situations. But like Clint Eastwood in Sergio Leone's The Man With No Name movies, when he talks, it feels eventful. When Max expresses his services to the good marauders and later tells them he will drive the truck, you get the feeling that you're in the presence of a real-life hero.

Speaking of expression, the acting in the Road Warrior is very good and over-the-top. Typically, I can't stand performers that overact but in this case, it's actually appropriate. Most subtle of these performers is, not surprisingly, Mel Gibson. As Max, Mel Gibson portrays a quiet loner with a nihilistic outlook on humanity. But by the end of the movie, as Gibson discovers his humanity, he becomes a warmer, more likable main character and Gibson's acting helps his character fully developed throughout the duration of the picture. On the other side of the spectrum are the villains Wez and Humungous (played by Vernon Wells and Kjell Nilsson) and Gibson's companion Feral Kid (Emil Minty). Wells is wildly over-the-top as the crazed lunatic biker that slaughters his enemies without ever being fazed by arrow shots. When The Feral Kid murders his male lover, Wez snaps and becomes a raging psychotic in a manner that could have been laughable but is actually riveting to watch. Nilsson is the quintessential main villain: towering, immense and with a voice (presumably dubbed) that epitomizes psychological warfare. As the Feral Kid, Minty brings an animalistic quality to the character but also a youthful innocence that makes him an endearing character. The Feral Kid can be as child-like as E.T. (as seen when Max gives him a small musicbox) and as vicious as Rambo (what he does with his boomerang) and Minty makes that character change work without being sloppy and awkward.

The Road Warrior stands as one of the best action movies ever made. Unlike many action movies that come and go because of their inability to create intelligent stories without resorting to pyrotechnics and fast-cutting to keep audiences awake, The Road Warrior works because of its gripping story, memorable characters, exceptional pacing and, of course, the action scenes themselves, makes it a breed apart from other stuntman movies where story is less valued than the stunts.

Don't walk away from this movie.

99516,3,0790729342,"I've been on a kick lately of viewing films from my youth.  The Road Warrior is such a film.  I used to love it, the post-apocalyptic vibe combined with cars and trucks tricked out into mobile weapons.  In college, I even wrote a term paper on the entire Mad Max trilogy, discussing how it applies to the philosophies of Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau.  You know, man reduced to a state of nature and then behaving little better than the lowest of animals, then inevitably forming new tribes, then communities out of the ashes.
Today, my affection for the film has waned.  Rest assured, I still believe it to be a fine piece of work with an artful and surreal atmosphere to it combined with kick ass action.  I just cannot enjoy it that much for it seems too close to becoming a reality for my tastes.  In the Mad Max films, there were wars that helped to ravage the globe and a nuclear exchange of one magnitude or another is alluded to.  Despite that, major reason cited for society's downfall is that the oil ran out.  We are perilously close to that today and...if I may be so bold...nearer to our own Mad Max scenario.  An additional reason for my dwindling affection for this film is...let's just say it involves a dog.
Yes, I used to love it.  It's easy to love a movie like this when you're 18 and have no one to worry for or protect besides yourself.
Addendum: Fans of Farscape will enjoy seeing Virginia Hey as a warrior woman.
It also occurred to me that the character of Mad Max may actually be saner than the real life Mel Gibson",1300924800,2,1539,4.383802816901408

99538,4,0790729342,"The Dec/81 release of The Road Warrior starring Mel Gibson was an instant success;coming off the heels of its predecessor Mad Max,it couldn't have done otherwise. On the surface this film is eye candy for those who delight in violence,mayhem and crash after crash in their films. Underneath it all is a smart film continuing on from Mad Max and fleshing out Max's character and his raison d'etre. It was filmed in an out of the way location in Australia and it took the franchise to a whole new level.
The story finds Max traveling the roads alone,fending off the odd attack on his vehicle and looking,always looking,for that precious commodity....gas. He comes upon an auto-gryo(a simple,open-air one seat helicopter)in the middle of nowhere. As he approaches it its' owner jumps out of his hiding place and gets the one up on Max. As he attempts to steal Max's ride his dog(""dog"")jumps out of the car and pins him down. The gyro captain(Bruce Spence) tells Max of a fuel refining station not too far away where he can get all the gas he needs. Max and his now captive(the gyro captain)come to a large hill overlooking the refinery and they witness a large gang of desert marauders trying to gain entrance and ultimate control of the refinery,which is heavily guarded by a rogue band of individuals. The leader of the marauders is a fierce some looking,though articulate,individual wearing a Jason-like mask called Lord Humungus(Kjell Nilson),while his first lieutenant is a mohawk-headed ""dog of war"" called Wez(Vernon Wells);Max and the harassed populace will have many frighteningly close encounters with the latter. At this time some of the guardians of the refinery seem to be trying to make a break out but it is all for naught. Max and the gyro captain watch in horror as a couple are hunted down;the man fatally shot and the woman gang raped and shot. When the marauders leave Max sees his chance for more gas and arrives on the scene. The man is barely alive and offers Max all the gas he can carry if he can get him back to the safety of the refinery.
Max delivers on his promise but the man he ""saved"" dies and the people there do not trust him. Lord Humungus offers the settlers their freedom and lives if they will just walk away from the refinery. As they discuss the pros and cons Max offers to go back to a rig he found earlier the day before and drive it back so the settlers can take out their large tanker of fuel that they guard. The deal is struck and Max and ""dog"" walk back carrying full jerry cans,followed by a young boy about eight years old,named the ""feral boy""(Emil Minty),who wields a deadly steel boomerang and becomes quite attached to Max. Along the way they meet up with the poor gyro captain who is dragging a stump Max left him chained to. Max of course loads up the hapless captain with the jerry cans,and eventually they arrive at their destination.
It is now daylight and Max knows this is going to be a suicide run back to the refinery,having to go through the marauders territory. Undaunted he sets off along with the aide of the captain piloting his gyro-copter. Through a harrowing ride Max makes it into the compound followed by some of the marauders including Wex. After an intense struggle they are all killed or driven out. The truck is not in good shape and it will take about 12 hours to fix. The settlers ask Max to stay and drive the rig out with them but he refuses,insisting he has fulfilled his end of the bargain and just wants to go. This he does next day but not far out from the compound he is jumped by the marauders who take him down. He is thrown from his overturned vehicle and in bad shape.""Dog"" dies defending him while a few moments later his car blows up killing two marauders. The rest leave thinking there is no one left alive. Just as Max faints he sees the gyro captain coming in for a landing near him. Next thing he knows he is back at the refinery. The settlers have voted to leave and this is when Max gets involved in the fight and volunteers to ride the rig full of fuel.
At the appointed time Max leaves in his rig(with the feral kid aboard),while the settlers leave in another direction. The marauders all head for the fuel tanker,as was the plan. The refinery is now open and undefended and the few who go in to take it over are blown to bits when a deliberately timed explosion occurs destroying everything with it. Max in the meantime is harassed every foot of highway he rides. All the settlers who come along to guard the tanker are killed. In a fiery explosion both Humungus and Wez are killed at the same time. However Max cannot outrun all of them and his tanker is flipped over spilling its' precious contents. The remaining marauders turn and drive away as we see Max crawling out from the drivers cab. As the gyro captain comes along Max looks at the spilling ""fuel"";it is sand. Max was the decoy and the actual fuel is safely on board the buses the other settlers traveled in!
The movie fades out as the narrator of the film(in actuality the feral boy now grown up;the film being his reminisces)tells us that this is the last he saw of Max. The last shot is of Max standing sideways in the fading light on the highway,camera pulling back...and fade out.
The Road warrior left a huge impression at the time of its release and still impresses today. Well directed with fleshed out characters,interesting scenes and stunts to die for. The stunt work in this movie is still to this day studied very closely by stunt schools worldwide. The film plunked Max firmly down into the dystopian world we knew from Mad Max and gave him a richer canvass on which to ""paint"".Characters liked Humugus and Wez and their interaction with their fellow marauders and Max,gave a good part of this film its life. Also Bruce Spence as the gyro captain gave the film a bit of comedy relief at crucial times,playing his part brilliantly. Of course the Wachowsky brothers when they made their classic ""Matrix"" movies,didn't forget The Road Warrior and especially Bruce Spence,and put him into the memorable role of The Trainman.
Technically speaking the film has been transferred well and is clear and crisp but at times it shows a little too much grain for my liking. It needs a good remastering to really make it shine. This DVD includes both widescreen and fullscreen versions,with the fullscreen version being WAY grainier then the widescreen one. Included are the theatrical trailer and some interesting production notes. It comes in a keepcase.
All in all a movie must-have for this series of films. Mel Gibson's character sets the somber tone of the film and the film's future setting gives the viewer a bleak look into a possible world future,where oil is the equivalent of gold. The action is violent and intense to which,thankfully,there are no filmic apologies given. It's an in-your-face actioner guaranteed to please all the way.",1293408000,2,6907,4.620829943043124

99542,5,0790729342,"In the barren wastelands of the post-apocalyptic future, one man stands above the rest: his name is Max, the Road Warrior. Introduced originally in the Australian trash and tumble actioner MAD MAX, creator George Miller transports his lead character into an entirely different environment for this second adventure. The world has been ravished by war, and all that remains are roving bands of marauders that scour the roads in search of fuel. Max, a lone warrior, battles his way through the packs of motor gangs with nothing to live for but revenge. His journey leads him to a remote oil refinery, whose leader acquires Max's help in leading his people through the treacherous desert in exchange for fuel. Miller's high-octane action sequences and explosive car chases across the Australian outback have served as a standard model for future filmmakers, with unforgettable scenes that have been copied and stolen repeatedly in the decades following its release. It is THE ROAD WARRIOR's wild costume designs and outrageous characters that set it apart from so many other imitations, especially seen in the frightening, larger-than-life villains Toadie and The Humungus that lead the feral hordes. Relics from the Old World are twisted and reformed to create the misshapen fortresses and gnarled body armor of the future. Although the plot and dialog are noticeably thin, Miller has drawn from the basic story structures used in cultures around the world to create an epic tale of good versus evil set in a futuristic landscape that offers a universal appeal to all viewers. Along with its predecessor, THE ROAD WARRIOR is a must-see film for all action and sci-fi fans, and a staple 1980's classic!

The apocalyptic aspect of the story as well as the awesome stunt work had a profound impact on me then. Now it stands as a true cinematic classic especially when you consider how much CGI is overutilized these days. It also became the template for Mel Gibson's acting career by playing the reluctant hero who only gets involved when he's pushed too far. This is also a great example of how an older film is supposed to be transferred to blu-ray. I would probably upgrade more older films from DVD but it seems to be very hit and miss with the older titles.

99576,5,0790729342,"The Road Warrior is a pretty incredible film that is not only the best of the Mad Max Trilogy, it's actually the only one of  the three that can be called a film of true quality.  The first Mad Max was nothing more than laughable B-movie fodder, while Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome was simply a watered-down mutation of the second film for the gullible American audience and the greedy Hollywood executives hallucinating on dollar signs.  This second film, The Road Warrior, stands on its own two feet-and it stands the test of time.
  The Road Warrior is far from your average action movie.  Unlike the glamorized violence of movies like Die Hard or Lethal Weapon, this film presents us with violence that is brutal, ugly, and unapologetic in its nihilism.  Dr. George Miller's direction is ungodly in its brilliantly calculated madness.  One can say that it has its own Chaos Theory.
  The Road Warrior succeeds, not just in the action, but also in the acting.  The cast manages  to flesh out its off-beat characters with a script of very little dialogue.  This is especially true with the character of Max, who is at the center of all this mayhem and who must have the least amount of dialogue of all the other main characters(the Feral Boy being the exception).  As Max, a charismatic and very young Mel Gibson gives a strong performance of quiet rage and smugness that gives his character the self-possession of a watchful cobra.  It's easy to see, in retrospect, how this young actor became a star.
  I know that as of late, many people have been hurling various expletives towards Mr. Gibson since his 2006 DUI arrest.  He has been called a bigot and a drunk. I find it puzzling that Mr. Gibson is now Public Enemy No. 1 by saying some insensitive comments (and no, I don't believe that he abused Oksana like she claims) while people like Woody Allen, Roman Polanski and Stephen Collins seem to get sympathy from both people in the industry and joe public.

While bombarding viewers with hardy action, it also grazes topics such as emotional solidarity, women's independence, and immigration and overpopulation; and consists of a Hollywood-famous car chase that belittled any chase anyone had ever seen (including that of Bullitt) prior to the recent releases of the Bourne flicks.

I would have liked to have had more in the Special Features (such as a documentary/interviews to view). But, the commentary is really insightful!

I recommend this purchase if you don 't own this movie for home viewing!",1260316800,3,593,4.5327102803738315

I remember seeing this with my Dad the day it came out. Then we saw it again over 20 years later in Austin's classic movie house, the Paramount, just before my old man went to the great fuel depot in the sky. I've shelved my dvd since then but I'm glad I checked out this version; it's a very fine transfer.

Not much to add to the rest of the reviews here. It's one of the great action films and has all the things that make a superior b-movie great, minus the bad. It does feel like a b-movie, in all the right ways. The next Max felt like a studio blockbuster and that killed it; this one keeps to its Ozploitation roots, to its credit and benefit.

I'd sure like to have seen a making-of doc, etc on this blu-ray version---the studios sure can be cheap. Just commentary and a weak Maltin intro? Pathetic; this film deserves a lot more, as do blu-ray buyers. But hey, times are tough for the studios: so many pirates that they're only having yet another year of record profits. So, clearly they must skimp. Wouldn't mind seeing Max take on some of them studio CEOs, actually...",1260057600,7,1091,4.31219512195122

The blu-ray quality on this movie is the best I have seen for a live-action, non-special effects movie.
The very first scene in the movie is a road moving past you at high speed as if you are straped to
the hood of a car.  The picture is perfectly clear.

The movie itself is also very entertaining and fast pace.
It is a real unique movie that is hardly made these days.",1253318400,3,454,4.183908045977011
99607,5,0790729342,"I've been a fan of this movie ever since it came out. I've always been disappointed with the mediocre image quality on the DVD edition of the Road Warrior. It always lacked detail and looked grainy; I feared that the original print of the movie was of low visual quality.
  I recently got a 46 inch Hi-Def LCD set and had watched the DVD on it. The image was bigger but no better.
  The Blu-Ray version of The Road Warrior ( or Mad Max 2 since this is the original Australian version,) is far superior to the DVD. There is far more detail and the colors are more saturated. I found the widescreen scenes of the Aussie desert quite stunning. This film is easily worth the discounted price it sells for on Amazon.
  Since this is the original Aussie version of the film, there are about ten more minutes of the movie which were trimmed out of the U.S. version. While the Aussie version doesn't move quite as quickly as the U.s. version, it is more complex and interesting.
  The added detail of the Blu-Ray makes the road battle finale even more dramatic. You have to admire the fearlessness of the stuntmen as they are thrown dozens of feet through the air during those amazing crashes. As this was in the days before CGI, what we see is more or less what really had to happen in front of the camera. Obviously some scenes have dummies getting crushed under wheels, but those are brave guys driving down that narrow road with that huge tanker.
  Sadly, the Special features are rather sparse. We do get a commentary track with director George Miller and the director of photography. While I could have wished for a making- of featurette, the Blue-Ray commentary is far better than the zero features of the DVD.

Events culminate in one of the greatest chases ever committed to film.

Director George Miller made this classic action film with great economy.  Characters such as the Gyro Captain (Bruce Spence) and the Feral Kid (Emil Minty) are established quickly and efficiently, gaining our instant sympathy.  There are also plenty of unexpected laughs and some genuinely moving moments.  ""The Road Warrior"" is a perfect example of a cast and crew who kept their eye on the goal--non-stop thrills and excitement--but saw that as no impediment to delivering a fully rounded, character driven film.

I've been a long time fan of this series (and by series, I mean 'Mad Max' and 'The Road Warrior', not that abortion of a movie 'Max Max beyond Thunderdome').  Anyway, this is the Australian release titled 'Mad Max 2', not 'The Road Warrior', so it has a slightly different intro, and they do refer to Mel's character as Max, not as the 'man with no name' like they did in the U.S. version.

Not a lot in the way of extras here.  The picture is very grainy when viewed in hi-def.  Not anything you can do about it; it was a limitation of the time since it wasn't filmed in hi-def.  Still, the film looks good despite it's age and the sound is good.  If you don't have it on DVD, you can certainly pick it up in that format cheaper than this was ($13).

99648,3,0790729342,"Road gangs rule the wastelands in the post-apocalyptic aftermath of civilization's finale. The most valued commodities: oil, gasoline, cars and guns. Mel Gibson stars as the now iconic Mad Max--the quiet wandering scavenger, humankind's mysterious last hero. The plot is simple: The Road Warrior must decide between escape or to stay and defend the peaceful gasoline making tribe from the tyranny of a wasteland gang.

As each action scene is skillfully 'wiped' to the next, the tension builds and the dramatic quality of the theme is rooted. The question is: Can these people escape the wasteland and journey toward the rumored last haven of civilized humankind? Or will they be hunted down, raped and murdered like animals by the whim of gang-rule.

Despite the gruesome action and sometimes campy dialogue, the theme of the film is complex: the right to one's own life. This is portrayed in the conflict between the producer tribe and the thieving gang: the creators vs. the destroyers; and Max walks the the middle line as an individual standing against tyranny, the defender of that right to life (his own), and of that dream of a better place. Max can't escape his past as a policeman, as an arbiter of justice, but can he escape the gang's brutality and live to scavenge another day?

Through Max we identify with the fight against tyranny in defense of a future for humanity, and as we do, a new hero mystique is born: that of the brooding and cunning last remnant of humankind's ideals. Also, a warning rises to the surface of this film; a warning about gang rule and human corruption and where that may lead us.",1221782400,2,1621,4.802867383512544

When I fired this baby up and ""Mad Max 2,"" the original Austrailian title came up instead of the U.S. ""Road Warrior,"" I almost fell out of my chair!  The clarity and crystal clearness of the picture was everthing I've been dreaming for.  I couldn't believe that a film this old could ever look like this.  The sound in my 5.1 theater is even better.  My wife who hates action flicks even sat through with me and was impressed.

Sure there isn't much extras on the disk, but who has time for those?  The film is what matters most.

The story is about the ultimate anti-hero, a broken man who wanders into a post-apocalytic wasteland battling scavengers for gasoline.  This film has the most amazing stuntwork and car chases.  It has been cloned, copied and is pretty much an important model for all science fiction post apocalytic action films.  I just can't believe director George Miller went on to make ""The Witches of Eastwick"" and ""Babe.""  This is a must buy for Blu-Ray sci-fi fans!

99678,5,0790729342,"This is really the one that started it all. The movie that every other post-apocalyptic film has ever tried to live up to but never could. The Road Warrior is the best of it's kind and is still top of the heap in this style of film. Among the many clones that have come out since, none come close to The Road Warrior. I much prefer this one to the original 'Mad Max' and it's way better than it's weak sequel 'Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome'. I've watched this movie many times over the years since the 80's and it holds up as well today as it did then. There's just nothing else like it.

The Road Warrior starts as every movie should, with action. This one in the form of a chase. It soon becomes apparent that fuel is the most precious resource (not too unlike today), and gangs of insane madmen are running wild everywhere seeking control by violence and by possessing said fuel. Max soon finds himself in the middle of a fuel dispute between 2 warring factions. One who controls a fuel depot surrounded by a guarded outpost and the other, a sadistic murderous gang who'll stop at nothing to gain control of it by killing anyone and everyone who stands in their way. Eventually allied with one side, events come to a climax in the form of a spectacular multi-vehicle chase that ranks among the greatest in movie history.

Max is a complex character. Once a former cop but now a man alone trying to survive in a desolate wasteland, still haunted by the loss of his wife and child who were brutally murdered. Struggling with moral decisions in an immoral world. A world where it's survival of the fittest. After being alone for so long, we find out if any of his old self still exists. Can he heed a call for help and work with others or will he continue to only look after himself?

Suprisingly, the leader of a large murderous gang named Humongus is deeper than you'd expect. He's a massive monster of a man. So hideous that he has to wear a hockey mask to cover what must be a disfigured face. He's clearly leader by size and strength but also brains. Constantly trying to outwit the group who guards the precious fuel, he deviously negotiates with them over a microphone, using anything and anyone and playing on their hopes and fears to try to convince them to come out.

The video on the Blu-Ray is outstanding. This is a very good transfer as it's light years beyond any other offering on vhs and dvd. The image is sharp, clear and mostly clean of dirt. There are more details than have ever been seen before. Whether it be by skin and clothing textures or the beat up vehicles and desert scenery. The colors look much more vivd too. Excellent overall. Unfortunately, the audio is still very front loaded. It's basically a stereo mix. The sounds, especially the motors of the cars, the dialog and sound effects are clear and sound better than they have before but I feel this movie really deserves and overhaul in the form of a real 5.1 mix. There's enough chases, gunshots and explosions, to make you imagine how good it could be with a dramatic remix. Seeing as how well it worked for 'Blade Runner', it could be done here. Overall though, it still sounds good enough to get you involved with the picture.

This is a classic film that's lost nothing over the years. It's still fun and defintely worth a look if your curious. If your already a fan, the high def versions (which are identical) are an easy, no brainer upgrade over previous versions. Another impressive addition to your catalog.",1200355200,,3500,4.4882260596546315

I couldn't believe my eyes. If you have a HDTV you will be visually stunned. It looks like it was shot yesterday in HD format. Seriously though, this is a prime example of what blu ray can do for older films if the proper care and attention is taken during the digital transfer. That said, when i bought this blu ray, I also bought the Patriot shot roughly 20 years later, and it looked like a regular DVD. Good movie, but why didn't it look as sharp as the Road Warrior?

99681,5,0790729342,"In a world that has been destroyed by War Max(Mel Gibson) is on his own.  The sequel to Max Max starts off when a small intro for those who are unfamiliar with the story.  The setting is Post Apocalyptic Australia.  The dry, barren landscape makes the perfect home for this world of destruction.

The story begins with action and the pace doesn't let up from there.  Max is being chased by a group of violent road pirates.  Out to steal the most valuable resource in this new world, fuel.  Fuel becomes scarce as people still use vehicles in this barren landscape.  Max has been toughened by the War and then losing his wife and child.  This toughness makes him able to take on these bandits.

On Max's journey he meets a comrade who at the threat of dying is more willing to show him the way to a fuel refinery.  The refinery is the most valuable commodity in this world.  It then becomes Max's toughness that gains the trust of the people who live in the refinery as they are threatened by the large group of road pirates.  Most of the story continues in this direction and the action is never lacking.

The Blu-ray version of this movie is beautiful.  The picture is excellent and the sound has been greatly improved which make this movie even more enjoyable.  The extras that are included are rather limited.  You get an intro, the theatrical trailer, and commentary.  Thankfully the movie looks great so that is more than worth it.

If you love action and good fast paced movies The Road Warrior is excellent.  This movie set the pace for the action genre.  There is little dialogue and all the stunts are real.  In the age of digital effects this movie is a breath of fresh air.

That tells you the way time builds human understanding. As a kid I assumed that the world was a good place, but now I know it to be equal parts good and evil. Few films showcase this eventuality more artfully and powerfully than the Road Warrior. This is an amazing production and I truly envy you if you've never seen it before.

The Road Warrior is both entertaining and deeply enlightening. There is more truth in its portrayal of human nature than a million self-help books and a hundred Hollywood movies. Civilization's veneer is thin. Without police and a government we would revert to shameful behaviors and attempt to survive by any means necessary. Max and the Gyro Captain are great but I still think that the feral boy character steals the spotlight from everyone else.

Besides that, most of the places now do not allow you to pump and then pay, because so many people are stealing from the pumps.  They call these ""Driveoffs"" and we need a guy like the one Gibson plays in this movie to chase them down!

The nice thing is in this movie is that on these roads you do not have to worry about a speed limit.  So yeah, sorry peoples but the radar detector you just got would be worthless in this film.

The part that is not realistic is of course the roads themselves.  C'mon peoples everywhere you go they are always having detours due to construction and road repair, in reality if this kind of thing played out, you would get a flat tire from all the potholes and debris that would fill up on the road over time.  I mean really where are the streetsweepers?  You have to be realistic even in a Science Fiction environment, but hey no problem, it is still good.",1186790400,,1043,4.123762376237623
99719,4,0790729342,"The second film of the trilogy is getting off the banality of the first one with its rape, infanticide and vengeance. Here we get to a world that is a real war to the death of one tribe against another and there is no law anywhere close. It is war for survival hence for the only thing that has some value in this desertic world where you can only move safely in motor vehicles, hence with gas. A fight for a tanker of gas, that's what the stake is. Mad Max gets on the side that controls the tanker in order to get gas for his car and he manages to serve them in a way and be accepted, though he tries to go away on his own when the service is finished. But he gets wrecked and has to be brought back by some accessory to the action who has some kind of unidentifiable flying object, some kind of ancestor of the chopper. So he will be the hero of the essential part of the film, the chase after the tanker. We will follow it with anxiety especially since a tanker like that is a bomb on wheels. The successive attacks against the tanker will be creative and some people will die on both sides and the driver will be seriously endangered by the attackers, to the point that he will not be able to avoid the final crash. And surprise, surprise, the tanker will not explode. The good old valueless gas had been transferred to the school bus in which the women were traveling. But the wreck of the tanker will incite the attackers, or what's left of them, to go away. Strangely enough they will not verify the content of the tanker and will not be able to think that the gas was somewhere else: these attackers are barbarians somewhere, hence they are intellectually retarded. And the final leg of the migration to safety could start and Mad Max could disappear in a mirage in the desert like some sand on a wind. Entertaining but in no way too intellectual: you will not get any nightmares nor headaches. Just funny after all. But that kind of chase will be imitated galore in the coming years after 1981. And that's probably one reason why it became cult: it was one of the very first films to work on the technique of shooting and editing such a chase.

99721,5,0790729342,"Hehehe I knew you could;-)  Mad Max, when it came out in the states was seen as a post-nuclear war vision.  One where the US and Russia wipe each other out, but the rest of the world just faces the economic collapse that the two superpowers war causes.  The Australian perspective was more to do with the energy crunch of the Opec embargo, one that hit Australia very hard.  Mad Max is more of a 'peak oil' series than a 'post nuclear' series.

And we are facing the beginnings of that dark future now.  It could be 20 years, it could be tomorrow.  Once the fuel prices spike high and stay that way, the panic it will cause will alone be enough to disrupt, possibly destroy civilization.

I will say right now - this Blu-Ray disk does the movie justice.  The transfer is fantastic in both audio and video.  When the camera is low to the pavement at 100mph, you can see the texture in the road.  You can see the nasty, stringy hair on top Lord Humongous.

Filmed in Australia by George Miller, this sequel to their original film, Mad Max, is a post-apocalyptic demolition derby.  It was created before the dawn of CGI, and all of it's stunts are for real, and breathtaking; particularly a stunt where one of the road predators is thrown end-over-end out of his crashed vehicle.

The Blu-ray version of the movie is brilliant, the film probably never looked as good in it's initial theatrical run.  There is no comparison between the Blu-ray and DVD images.  The colors and detail in this HD presentation are spectacular.  There are moments in the film where the focus is somewhat soft on the edges, but I suspect this is a flaw in the principal photography and not the new transfer.

I remember seeing this movie in the theater.  I don't think even the film as shown in the theater contained this much detail, as I noticed details in the movie that I had not seen before.  It's a excellent picture.

The sound is good, but nothing like blockbuster movies from recent years, because Road Warrior was made several years ago, and not exactly on a huge budget.  Still, it's the best sound quality you're likely to hear for this movie.

Some purists may enjoy the fact that the movie is shown with the title ""Mad Max 2"" rather than ""The Road Warrior"" at the beginning, but I don't like it.  When I saw the movie in the theater it said ""The Road Warrior"", and had a bright shining metal effect.  I wanted to see THAT, not something that was originally shown in Austrailia.

It's hard to define why this film, the flaws of which are many, is a classic, but that is what it is. Mel Gibson returns to play Max in the (sort-of) sequel to Mad Max. Plot then gets cheesey, characters are cheesy, the villains (led by the Humungous) is double the cheese, and so on.

But if it is cheesy, it more than makes up for it in atmosphere. In a remote part of Australia, the filmmakers create a world entirely their own, and it is generously shared with the audience: a place of simplistic good vs. evil stuff, but a world, nonetheless, and one is drawn into it while viewing the flick. It is that atmosphere, a sense of ""somewhere-else"" that draws a person in... and keeps us there.

Plenty of violence and stunts involving cars, trucks, and the occasional helicopter, too.

There is no character development in this movie but, quite simply, there doesn't need to be: every role is perfected from the start, and most of the actors live up to the parts they ae given.",1162684800,2,1033,4.421052631578948
99780,5,0790729342,"Following the success of MAD MAX, director and writer George Miller re-teamed with Mel Gibson to make this follow-up to one of most successful and profitable independent movies in history.  Originally titled MAD MAX 2, the movie was retitled ROAD WARRIOR for the American release because though MAD MAX had been a huge success overseas, it hadn't made it beyond art house theatres in the U.S.

For those who have seen MAD MAX, ROAD WARRIOR offers some subtle nods to the past film, such as certain designs in Max's outfit and the famous Interceptor that he drives.  Yet, ROAD WARRIOR isn't the type of sequel that requires the viewer to have seen the previous picture.

The vicious and gritty world of Max Rockatansky has taken a turn for the worse in ROAD WARRIOR.  The world is even more chaotic and petrol has become more precious than food or water.  Max has become a lone wanderer, traveling from place to place, fighting just to survive.  He believes that his past days as a man of law and order and who fights to do the right thing has been put behind him.  After an interchange with some new bandits, Max finds himself in the midst of small group of good and honest people who run a small oil refinery.  Appealing to his sense of law, goodness, and justice they convince him to help them in making their escape from a cut-throat gang of bike terrorists with their entire fuel supply.

ROAD WARRIOR was the movie that basically introduced Mel Gibson to U.S. movie audiences and it was the film that made him a star.  It was the most successful of the Mad Max films and for good reason.  MAD MAX was a very good post-apocalyptic movie, but the movie had its limits.  For instance almost 2/3rds of the planned chase and action scenes were cut from MAD MAX for budget restrictions.  In ROAD WARRIOR the filmmakers were able to do many of the things they weren't able to in MAD MAX.  Almost a third of the movie involves a massive chase sequence with a giant tanker, motorcycles, dune buggies, and sundry other vehicles.  The action sequences are intense and full of adrenaline.  The script is a more concise than in MAD MAX as well as less complex.  Max's character is established early on and because this is just one incident in the legend of the ""Road Warrior"" very little other characterization is needed.  The acting in the film isn't anything extraordinary, but it's not as cheesy as it could have been (see the MAD MAX BEYOND THE THUNDERDOME for that).

Overall an exciting post-apocalyptic movie that is full of action and a massive car chase in the desert.  Recommended for fans of sci-fi and action movies as well as people interested in Mel Gibson and films that have a side note in movie history.",1158969600,3,2712,4.5850622406639

The audio levels are too high for the music and certain ""effects"" (explosions and car revs) as compared to the dialogue.  When you turn it down so the music is at a tolerable level, then you can't hear anyone saying anything!  And once you turn it up enough to hear the dialogue, WHAM! The music, or an expolosion is Exageratingly Loud!

I hate it when they say that this has been ""Digitally Remastered"" and yet the remastering sucks!  In this case, it's the sound.  I don't know if there's an older release, or maybe a new one in the future that fixes this. I purchased a brand new copy of the DVD in August of 2006, and the DVD case says Copyright 1997, so I guess in 1997 is when they transferred this, and haven't bothered with it since.

99783,5,0790729342,"`The Road Warrior', directed by Kennedy - Miller, and starring Mel Gibson, is one of those movies which seemed to appear out of nowhere and become, much to critics' embarrassed admission, an important work of fantasy / science fiction / adventure, thereby making its title actor into an important cinema star.

The importance of `The Road Warrior' has grown with the years, as it has spawned numerous imitators, most especially Kevin Costner's `Waterworld', none of which are quite as good as the original. Even the sequel, `Mad Max, Beyond Thunderdome', with its higher production values, iconic presence of Tina Turner as the primary heavy, and somewhat more interesting story manages to quite match the raw impact of `The Road Warrior'.

Most of the movie's success may be due to the same effective mix of two or more genres that we see in `Alien' and `Blade Runner'. While both have strong elements of science fiction, where the back story is driven by a fictional scientific premise, which the authors run with to see what may happen, if only .... And yet, these two movies are more the traditional horror movie and the traditional thriller, but elevated to a higher level by the great mix of qualities.

Of course, `The Road Warrior' is itself a sequel to the original `Mad Max', however the connection is tenuous both in story line and in shared back story. I was never really sure `Mad Max' was really supposed to be happening in some post-apocalyptic Australian world (told by survivors of an `On The Beach'), or just in a run-down corner of Australia, which happens to be experiencing a bit more motorcycle gang outlawry. The mythic road warrior character certainly shares enough in common with Max of the first movie to see a continuity, but unlike movies like `The Matrix' trilogy and the `Lord of the Rings' series, one looses nothing from `The Road Warrior' if you did not see `Mad Max'.

Just as `The Road Warrior' may be borrowing some cachet from `On The Beach', it also seems to owe something to `Lord of the Flies', another `lets see what happens in a post-nuclear holocaust' movie. One can interpret this as the way things end up if the lost boys of `Lord of the Flies' grew up and got wheels.

And, unlike `Mad Max, Beyond Thunderdome', `The Road Warrior' benefits from a very simple story, exquisitely scripted, if not to excellently acted by the supporting cast.

Just like `A Hard Days' Night', `The Road Warrior' manages to transcend the conventions of its genre, the say way as an Andy Warhol silk screen of a Campbell's Soup can turns something ordinary into art, thereby becoming a new paradigm of artistic expression, to be imitated by its successors.",1154649600,,2680,4.802603036876356

99816,5,0790729342,"The Road warrior, or to call it by its other name - Mad Max 2 is one of those very rare animals, a sequel that manages to be better than the original. Mad Max was a good film but its budgetary constraints showed. The Road Warrior takes the strengths of Mad Max and integrates them with higher production values. The result is an even better looking film than the original, packed with even more scintillating and jaw dropping stunt sequences.

In the plot of this film, civilisation has collapsed completely. Survivors scavenge for food and fuel, ruthlessly eliminating any competition by any means that they can. Mel Gibson plays Max, a former Highway Cop, now eking out an existence in his former pursuit car - a V8 Interceptor. Cruising the blighted countryside, he searches for fuel and food, so as to survive.
His only companion is his dog and following the events depicted in the previous film, he has become a cold, untrusting, and withdrawn loner.
He encounters a character called the Gyro Captain (amusingly played by Bruce Spence) who pilots a mini helicopter. The Gyro Captain shows Max an oil refinery under siege by an army of thugs, sporting Mohican hair cuts. This pack is led by a psychopath called Humungous who wants the refinery and its fuel for himself. Defending the refinery are a group of ordinary people who want to flee the waste lands and set up a new life in a quiet part of the country.
Max falls in with this group and helps them in their battle against Humungous and his cronies.

The road sequences are stupendous and are a real white knuckle ride to sit through, especially if you have not seen the film before. There are no CGI effects in this film and what you see is all stunt work and it is brilliant. These car chases are peppered throughout the film, culminating in a massive chase involving a huge and amoured fuel tanker, pursued by scores of marauders in souped up vehicles.
Great to watch in the cinema, this film is equally superb on a home cinema set up. Picture is bright, clear, and pin sharp. Sound is 5.1 and it is superb.

99817,5,0790729342,"Later to be known as a man of dignity, honesty, and fragility, Mel Gibson is known to most ignorant men as a pansy. However, for the select few who can actually bare the man, we always come to our senses to watch this film whenever time is on our side. Once Mel was known for his survival instincts, keen street smarts, and his signature everyman-for-himself attitude. This movie proves that in all aspects...

Max Rockatansky is the protoganist on the verge of collapse. His wife and child were murdered by a group of bikers, only later to be almost fully exacted on by Max single handedly.. He now runs life on the highway with his faithful canine and the champion Pursuit Special Interceptor. Suffering from disillusionment, society seems all to desperate in his eyes...just as desperate as he is to stay alive in search of pertroleum. What you will find throughout the movie from here will only bring you driving plot sequences and entertaining scenes that will keep you watching the whole way through. All the action never gets old, many instance come up that will make you have that tad laugh you want to let out, and the ending chase will leave you wanting to explore scene selection the next time around.

The best way to sit through this is with an open mind, so be aware of things that you might not see in a normal action film. Now since this is science fiction, there will be many skeptics upon stupidity and pointless aspects to this film, but hopefully you will understand the true concept about this movie and everything that fills it.

Anyways, this is a exemplary masterpiece in every way possible for a film. This is Mel the way he wanted to be portrayed in the beginning...raw, tough, and in your face. He makes sure you understand what kind of hell he has been through, and this movie is a veteran example of such reality. I highly recommend adding this to the library which you have forged, as it only reigns as an essential piece in film history. If you already purchased it before, give it another round.

I'm going to share a little Howard Tuttleman secret with you.  I've never tried dog-food, but I'm highly considering it because of this movie.  In the future, when we are scavengers and have to sur-vive, I may have to do things that I'm not normally inclined to.  This includes sharing a meal with my dog-panion as M. Gibson does in this movie.  The reason that I'm so casually admitting this is because I'd like to warn you, the reader out there, that my genious detects a 5-SKULL future-nightmare on the horizon and this movie depicts it very well.

Some may think this is just one of those end-of-the-world-drive-around-and-stuff-blows-up-movies, but it's not.  Way back when whenever this movie was made, they knew that there was going to be an oil crisis and a big war and from what I hear-around, that's kind of like what's going on....right about now, and it's the type of major event that I've been preparing for, A FULL-ON URBAN-WAR-ZONE. But like I said, it's just a warning.

In this movie, the dog does such great tricks.  It's like him and the Road-Warrior are of the same mind.  Oh how they trick people together.  Unfortunately the Dog-Warrior eventually takes an arrow for M. when they are attacked by ogre-ish Harley-Bopper types.

Unlike in Flight of the Navigator where the boy chooses a space-ship to replace the bond that he had with his dog, M. chooses a savage boy who he treats like a dog.  Actually, now that I think about it, this dog-boy catches frisbees just like the dog from F.O.T.N.  Amazing!  I think I've just mined a great big hunk of brain-gold on this one! LOL!  But seriously, I will look into frisbees as ammunition later.  WHOA!  I mean as in not now, this is NOT the end of the review.  I almost submitted by habit!

I give this movie 5 stars because I feel it is my destiny.  Later.

99820,5,0790729342,"The Road Warrior AKA Mad Max II.

Many reviewers have articulated the fine features of this film. Allow me to throw a few of my own unique ones into the pot.

Collapse of Western Civilization: I don't think its been done better. The screenwriters set it up with excellent reality making it entirely credible.

Use of visuals: One of the beautiful aspects of the film is that it uses visuals and music instead of dialogue to tell the story in many scenes. That results in 100% brillance. So often today films have to overkill the dialogue. This is done with taste and quality. Its a lesson to modern filmakers.

Tension: The music score is perfect augmenting the feeling in the scene that accompanies it. The editing is also flawless.

Story: As a person who understands human nature the story is entirely believable. Western civilization falls, all hell breaks loose it becomes kill or be killed leading to anarchy. Thus, the ""sane"" world becomes rapidly devoured up by chaos.

Acting: No weak performances. All the characters flesh out wonderfully.

Many would consider this not a ""chick"" flick. (I can't believe I typed that cliche) It is a deeply intense drama that brutally represents of what the world would be like if anarchy ruled. It might turn off some for that dark protrayal. For me personally, I view this as a post apocalypse ""Gladiator."" Gladiator had many of the excellent film and story traits this film has.

Simply put - Probably the best example of the post apocalypse genre in terms of story, film making and editing. If you don't have it you are missing an excellent piece.",1137974400,2,1594,4.75
99821,4,0790729342,"MAD MAX 2: THE ROAD WARRIOR has to be one of the most intense action films ever produced. There's very little I might add to this already popular movie. Both fans and critics are unanimous in their praise for what is the BEST chapter of the MAD MAX trilogy. Having this said, it's also EXTREMELY sad to see the kind of DVD treatment this highly innovative film has received. Unlike the special edition of the MAD MAX DVD, this one is austere at best: a ""passable"" dolby 5.1 mix and subtitles. That's it. Picture quality is only mildly ""acceptable"" (dark scenes are highly pixelated and hard to understand!). No director's commentary, no behind the scenes, no nothing. For a movie that's being praised as a LANDMARK in science fiction and billed as influential as STAR WARS, the DVD that's available is a crying shame. Why has nobody ever bothered to release a special edition is beyond my reckoning. We see so much ""trash"" being released as a ""special edition"" and yet we still have to wait for a defenitive DVD of MAD MAX 2. My review, as you might have guessed, is about this most criminal offense. I's rate MAD MAX 2 with an 11 (yep, it's a VERY entertaining movie) but the DVD truly stinks.

Let's hope Mr. Miller comes to his senses and releases a worthy DVD package for the film he will most likely be remembered BY!",1131840000,3,1322,4.508333333333334
99822,5,0790729342,"This movie has capitvated me since I was in the fifth grade as a kid. My buddy and I saw it edited on TV and had to see the real deal.

The muscle cars, the heroic character of Max, the setting, action, all makes for a real genre of movie that had never before been viewed....

The Max character develops so much in this movie unlike the stupid Thunderdome.  Mad Max, which I love, didn't show us the depth of Max that Road Warrior reveals.  He is a bitter person, an angry person, a loner.  But by the end of the movie, his humanity drips out as does his heroic spirit.  He gets railroaded pretty bad in the movie, which often happens to heroes.

The chase scene at the beginning of the movie blew me away, the camera angle coming down on the Ford flying down the highway. I'll never forget the first time they showed it and then you see that white stripe in the middle of the road flying 100 mph at you.  Wez, the insane mowhawk lunatic pursuing Max (played by Vernon Wells, no, not the baseball player, another actor lol) is truly perfect for the part.  The chase scenes are perfect, the acting is great, etc.

I really love the atmosphere of the survivors trapped inside the oil refinery.  It's very clostrophobic, nerve-wracking, and affective.

This movie set the standard for the modern day action film in so many ways.  It was an instant classic with me...still is. Buy it!",1126310400,6,1381,4.389763779527559
99823,5,0790729342,"I watched this movie again last night before writing this review and all I can say is WOW!  I first saw it when I was too young, about 10, and have watched it about 50 times in the last 20 years.  I own it on VHS and DVD, and the quality of both is good.  I could write a book about how great this movie is and how much I love it.  If my house burned down and I could only grab one movie, this would be it.  It is done so well.  I'll discuss the overall merits of the movie. Everybody knows the plot, so I won't discuss that in detail other than to say the plot of the movie is amazing and creative.  It is a compelling social commentary on human nature in times of survival (in times of chaos, some people band together for good and some band together for bad).  We are presented with both, in shades of gray.  For instance, Max is our ""hero"" but he is looking out for himself first and foremost and is a reluctant hero in the end.  The introductory narration and concluding narration are creative, add some insight to the movie, and are outstandingly well done.  Next, the casting and acting were first rate and the dialogue is precise and compelling.  Much of what happens isn't explained with dialogue, but instead with shocking facial expressions which are more powerful than words (a few great examples: the Gyro captains facial expression watching a woman be raped, beaten, and killed; the Warrior Woman's expression when she sees people being tortured and burned; and the Feral kid's expression when he sees the two good guys pulled from the tanker and run over and then when the bad guy is shot by Max, and again his fear at being on the hood of a moving semi truck).  Now, if a great creative plot accompanied by first rate acting and casting isn't enough of a reason for 5 stars, add to the mix the following:  This movie boasts not one, but several of the best car chases ever to hit the big screen.  Better than Bullet, Ronan, The Bourne Supremacy, etc.; even as good as or better than Mad Max!  Not only are the car chases phenomenal and creative, but the vehicles are super cool.  Can you think of cooler vehicles than Max's V8, the orange Ford truck with the dart guns mounted on the back, Humugus' truck, and the several other creative muscle cars presented?  And, to go along with the amazing car chases and cars, the stunts are better than ANY MOVIE I'm aware of.  No computer graphics here.  These were true live stuntmen who broke many bones making this movie.  It's crazy good and the action is basically non-stop.  The video angles are great too and we're given the ""benefit"" of a view from above by the Gyro pilot.  And the characters are creative, memorable, touching in their own ways, and are developed VERY well in such a short time.  Wez, for instance, is one of the greatest movie villains of all time in his many berserk rages and ruthlessness.  And, add one of the all-time best movie musical scores written by Brian May.  It's really moving and compellingly done and fitting for the movie.  The costuming was very creative and first rate too.  But, with any movie it isn't perfect and after watching it many many times I've noticed a few imperfections.  But the imperfections are petty and don't detract from the movie in any way.  My only complaint is that the extras on the DVD are less than good.  It was done very cheaply.  But I won't hold that against the amazing movie because extras are just that, extras.  And, some of the voices were dubbed and it would be nice to have the original version as well as the dubbed version on the same disc, like what was done with Mad Max (where you are offered the Australian version and the dubbed version).  If you like this movie, I recommend the original Mad Max as a 5 star movie which prequels The Road Warrior.  I do not recommend ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"" because it's a very disappointing sequel and I rate it at 2 stars (see that review for more information).",1125532800,5,3948,4.421052631578948
99824,4,0790729342,"Although The Road Warrior is technically the 1981 sequel to 1979's Mad Max, it does quite well as a stand-alone film. The narrator explains the events of the first film at The Road Warrior's beginning. The world has been degraded to desert-stricken chaos, and ""Mad"" Max (Mel Gibson) is the road warrior, a lone traveler across the desolate roads. He has lost his family, and as a result lost most reason to live. He is a ""shell of a man"", as the narrator explains. All he knows is survival. And, seeking to prolong that survival, he is in search of the holiest of possessions in the post-apocalypstic world: gasoline. The only ones able to survive in the new world are those with the skills of the road, as all other are destroyed and robbed of what little they have -- especially the much needed fuel. Max runs into trouble in the form of a murderous gang that are determined to become the rulers of the wastelands, lead by the barbaric Humungus. The gang's most recent plans are to over-run a small community of desert-dwellers for their fuel. Without originally intending to do so, the road warrior befriends the community and ultimately sees that they must all work together to defeat the gang and Humungus. With the help of a feral child, the goofy side-kick, and the group he now feels obligated to protect, Max takes on the enemy with road-raging speed, down-n-dirty combat brutality, and primitive determination, packing The Road Warrior with gritty action that's satisfying to any fan of the genre. As one of the most classic action characters, Mel Gibson has marked his place in cinematic history with The Road Warrior, and we can relive the adventure time and time again through DVD. So strap on your leather, grab the nearest sawed-off shotgun, hop in your dirt-caked hunk-a-junk car, and refuse to let the legend die!",1124668800,5,1830,4.7578616352201255

99857,5,0790729342,"There was a period when I would tell people that the last decent Western I saw was ""The Road Warrior"" (nee ""Mad Max II"").  I am sure there were other decent Westerns in between ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" and ""Dances With Wolves,"" but that would take research and the whole point of the comment was that ""The Road Warrior"" has the sensibilities of a classic Western.  There have been attempts to turn Westerns into Science Fiction, but just because you put ""High Noon"" in outer space as they did in ""Outland"" does not mean that it has the soul of a Western.  Films such as that are reduced to gimmicks, and you do not have the sort of resonance you get by, say, updating Shakespeare (e.g., Orson Welles and John Houseman doing ""Julius Caesar"" in the 1930s in a fascist setting).

What I find most fascinating is that director George Miller is able to extend what he created in 1979's ""Mad Max"" into the post-apocalyptical world of this 1981 sequel (continued in 1985's ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"" but not to be followed by the planned 2005 film ""Mad Max: Fury Road"").  The film opens with an explanation of what happened, which also works in scenes from the original ""Mad Max.""  Basically, we had Mel Gibson back as ""Mad"" Max Rockatansky, but now civilization has collapsed.  We assume Max is no longer a cop because there are no longer any cops (or he is in the wasteland of Australia where cops no longer dare venture).  In the first film Max is motivated by revenge as he pays back the bikers who destroyed his family, but this time his only concern is survival, which means finding petrol to keep his car going (not that he has any where to go).  But the key thing here is that in this New West just think ""gas"" instead of ""gold.""

Max and his dog are wandering the wasteland in his black V8 interceptor and after an initial encounter with one of the gangs that roam the area, he stumbles upon the Gyro Captain (Bruce Spence), so named because he has a small gyrocopter.  When he finds out Max is after fuel the Gyro Captain leads him to an oil refinery being besieged by what has to be the most powerful outlaw gang in the area, led by The Humungus (Kjell Nilsson), whose hockey mask predates Jason Voorhees by several years and who is announced by his Toadie as ""The Ayatollah Of Rock-And-Rolla""!  Inside the fortified refinery is a group that is trying to preserve civilization, but Max could care less.  They have a tanker that they are filling with petrol and that is all that matters to our hero, who is busy playing up the big anti-hero chip on his shoulder at this point.

The plot has to do with how Max eventually comes to play the requisite role of the hero, but what makes this film memorable are the action sequences.  The temptation is to describe the main ones as ""car chases,"" but when you see these you are not thinking Steve McQueen in ""Bullit.""  Instead your are thinking of John Wayne in the original ""Stagecoach.""  In other words, what would Indians chasing cowboys be like if they all were driving souped up desert buggies.  Yet even with all the hot rods and tankers this one is going to come down to Max against Wes (Vernon Wells), The Hummungus' right-hand attack dog, who wears a big Mohawk, keeps a young blonde guy on a chain behind him on his chopper, and is as strong and as athletic as he is psychotic.  Actually, Wes upstages The Hummungus as the film's villain.  Then there is Emil Minty as The Feral Kid, who must have a fascinating back-story somewhere in the recesses of Miller's mind, and Virginia Hey, the future Pa'u Zotoh Zhaan on ""Farscape,"" as the Warrior Woman.

The leader of the people dressed in white, Pappagallo (Mike Preston), wants to use the petrol to start a new life up north (I would head for the Great Barrier Reef for the fish, but what do I know about survival?).  Implicit in that goal is the notion of what sort of new world can be created from the ruins of the old one, and while that is the pot at the end of the rainbow for ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"" as well, it is not a real concern.  This film comes down to the action sequences, and there is a sense in which the entire plot is simply an excuse to put these characters in crazy looking vehicles and tear on down the ribbon of highway at high speeds.  However, a lot of people who have enjoyed ""The Road Warrior"" have not minded.  Wes is an unforgettable villain, there are other quirky characters, and the crashes are pretty spectacular, especially since this is the old days and none of this is CGI.  When it comes to films where they put the pedal to the metal, this one is hard to beat.",1109462400,2,4615,4.419126328217238
99858,5,0790729342,"This movie, the second in the Mad Max trilogy, is easily the best of the three.  Visually, it's very distinctive.  The first movie showed a society breaking down in the post apocalyptic world.  By this movie, it's broken down.  The first movie showed the immediate aftermath.  There were still working phones, power lines, people trying to go on with their normal lives, etc.  There was even a police force, of which Max was a member, trying to maintain order.  Now, society has descended into complete anarchy.  Civilization's infrastructure has broken down completely.  In the first movie you saw shops, service stations, hospitals.  Now you see people scavenging in a wrecked world.  Max's car is no longer a gleaming black vehicle, but a delapidated, dirty old beater, its engine still in top shape, but its interior stripped, and its body covered in dust, battered and old.  Max's leather police uniform is no longer immaculate, but torn and patched.  Visually, this movie set a new standard, and like ""Star Wars"" and ""Blade Runner"", changed the way movies in its genre were made.  Even the setting works in telling the story.  Where the first film featured country with trees and green grass, this movie is set in a blasted desert, further accentuating the sense of collapse.

And this movie's quality doesn't end with the visuals.  It has a great, exciting story, very reminiscent of the pulp adventures of old.  It's hero, a wanderer, a uniquely skilled and deadly loner, is a mythic archetype.  The actors are all perfectly cast.  Mel Gibson, with only a few lines of dialogue, turns in a compelling, emotional performance, showing the transformation from the happy, loving husband and father of the first film, to the wounded, burnt out shell of a man seen here.  In this film, Max is a tough, fang-scarred old wolf, who has absolutely nothing to live for, but whose survival instinct, combined with his toughness and resourcefulness, just won't let him quit.

The other characters in this movie are also unique and memorable.  Bruce Spence's gyro captain is a likeable opportunist.  Mike Preston's Papagallo is the determined, idealistic leader, in over his head, but trying his best.  Vernon Wells makes a great, flamboyant villain.  And Kjell Nilsson is the Humungus, whose face we never see; leader of a vicious band of trash, whose hulking physique, and savage followers seem at odds with his articulate speech, and ostensibly conciliatory manner.  The story and characters elevate this movie over the host of low budget imitators that followed.  But the film is not short on action either.  And George Miller was a gifted director who put to film what remain the best car chase scenes ever shot, right down to this day.  Action lovers will find plenty of excitement with this movie.  It's a terrible shame the third film wasn't very good, as it killed the prospects of a long running series.  This is sad because Max, wandering lone wolf that he is, is a character who, like James Bond, Sherlock Holmes, or the Conan of the old pulp magazines is eminently suitable to a series of adventures.",1107734400,160,3107,4.904030710172744

Why is it that this turbo charged import from down under has more resonance for me than these high-profile domestic releases?  I did see the original ""Mad Max"" on it's initial release in 1980.  It was a huge international success while it was a cult favorite here in the States.  I remember first hearing of ""The Road Warrior""(or ""Mad Max 2"" as it was known outside North America) in a long piece in Time magazine in the spring of '82.  Time's critic hailed it as ""Apocalypse! Pow!"" and went on to rave about the film's virtues.  Later in the year he put it on the list of the ten best films which was no small feat.  I finally got around to seeing this film in August of that year as the bigger releases were winding down their runs.  To say I was blown away is an understatement.  ""The Road Warrior"" had energy and imagination to burn.  Director George Miller did with a fraction of the budget what other director's with bigger largesse could only dream of.  The film's basic premise, a group of post-apocalyptic survivors holed up in an oil refinery while rampaging hoards of leather-clad hoodlums hover outside looking for the smallest fissure to crack this fortress and take the ""juice"" is a compelling one.  The exodus of this band from the Outback to the promised land while the marauders attempt to hi-jack their trucks is viscerally exciting.  Throw in a burned-out mercenary anti-hero, Max(Mel Gibson), and you've got a classic on your hands.  One can marvel at this film and say that Miller has created an original work but his influences are subtle.  I can see him paying homage to Ford, Leone, and Kurasawa here.  What also distinguishes this film are the rich characterizations.  Aside from Gibson whose star was starting to grow with this film memorable performances are turned in by Bruce Spence as the Gyro Captain and young Emil Minty as the Feral Kid.

It's funny, Waterworld used almost the exact same plot except on water and it was a very poor movie, whereas this is a very good movie.  A lot of that can be attributed to the acting of Mel Gibson as the taciturn loner Max, and Director George Miller, with his flair for car chases.  The plot is simple: Max is a haunted loner who drives perpetually through the outback of Australia.  He comes across a refining station, defending their oil agaisnt hordes of marauders led by the Humongous.  These marauders are, for lack of a better word, rather gay.  The same trend existed in the first Max film, and why George Miller must make his villains homosexual is beyond me.  Perhaps he thinks the audience will hate them more if they are sexual deviants.  However, this is the only flaw (aside from un-neccesary and sometimes grating sped-up footage) in the film.

In any event, the defenders of the refinery need someone to find a rig capable of towing their gasoline tanker, and ultimately drive it.  Max is eventually enlisted in both tasks.

This film is a visual feast, with flame-throwers and razor-boomerangs, colorful characters, lots of crashes and explosions, sweet cars and great car chases.  Up there with Aliens for best action movies ever made. 8/10",1098144000,5,1488,4.724806201550388

Although the opening scene in this film starts off where the first one ended, there isn't much continuity between the two films.  The first film is set in a rather civilized setting where Mad Max is exacting revenge on an average biker gang that killed his family.  In the 'Road Warrior' there are no towns or any signs of civilized life other than a small group of squatters holding an isolated oil well and refinery.  The settlers are continuously besieged by hordes of punks/anarchists on bikes and muscle cars who want the installation as a criminal base of operation.  Although at first coming to the settlers as an opportunist only looking for gas, Mad Max finds his humanity and helps the settlers free themselves from their attackers.

99863,5,0790729342,"Before Mel Gibson became such an immense Hollywood icon that he could make a film of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ on his own, he was an Australian movie star who made a number of that fantastic film nation's best movies...and none of them were bigger or better than ""Mad Max 2"", released as ""The Road Warrior"" in a North American market that (save for a few raving cult film devotees like myself) generally never knew there was a ""Mad Max 1"".

 George Miller and Byron Kennedy have reinterpreted the American Western in a fashion similar (though hardly as literal) to that of Sergio Leone's own ""Spaghetti Western"" visions and Akira Kurosawa's samurai epics...and Mel Gibson (as ""Max"", of course) wraps himself in the Clint Eastwood/Toshiro Mifune anti-hero cloak as naturally as any role he has ever undertaken.

He is the apocalyptic loner who rides a supercharged black car instead of a pale horse...of course, feeding the car is more of a challenge than feeding a horse, and that is the cycle that Max finds himself trapped within when salvation is offered in the guise of an extremely quirky set of characters ranging from Bruce Spence as a gyrocopter pilot to a besieged town based around an oil refinery who are terrorized by a band of motorcycle brigands with whom Max forges an emnity within the first five whiplash minutes of the movie.

 That's the plot, and it works, even in this post Cold War world in which we live now. It works because the action in this movie is absolutely unsurpassed anywhere. It's set at a breakneck pace that only lets up long enough for the viewer to catch his/her breath...and by the time the movie is over, it is impossible to believe that 95 minutes could go by so quickly.

 And the action is all that more amazing when considering that all of it was handmade and carried out by real people...real CRAZY people. This was before the age of big budget CGI special effects; there are no blue or green screens here (most of the budget was in the cars)...they lined it up, they shot it, and it is an absolutely amazing string of events around which the film's star has perhaps two dozen lines of dialogue at the most. And it doesn't even matter.

 This is the film that helped launch Mel Gibson in the USA. It wasn't the critical success he found with the more mainstream ""The Year Of Living Dangerously"", but it put US moviegoers on notice: Watch out for this Gibson dude; he's a major up-and-comer, fair dunkum. Easily one of the most re-watchable movies I own and I can't recommend it enough to anyone who THINKS they know great action movies.",1091664000,,2860,4.616141732283465

99886,4,0790729342,"This _may_ be the best movie of the Mad Max trilogy.
I like a good postapocalyptic thriller as well as the next guy, but _Mad Max_ just wasn't it. In order to pull off a movie along those lines within the constraints of a tight budget, you pretty much have to be John Carpenter (whose _Escape from New York_ is, to my mind at least, a much more appealing movie than the one that launched this trilogy). It was a very cool idea, but too many of the seams showed and there wasn't enough cool stuff to sustain it in spite of its flaws.
_The Road Warrior_ is a different deal. It's a _much_ better movie than its predecessor, and it's sufficiently self-contained that you don't have to have seen the earlier one in order to enjoy it.
You probably already know the story here. After a nuclear war, what remains of human society is teetering on the edge between civilization and barbarism. Max (Mel Gibson in his pre-_Lethal Weapon_ breakout role) is a tormented loner in this world, hovering somewhere between hero and anti-hero as he wanders aimlessly around the Australian Outback in search of 'guzzline' to keep his car running. (You'll have to watch the first film to find out exactly why he's so tormented, but the first few minutes will give you the general idea.)
The plot itself revolves around that selfsame guzzline, of which there's (naturally enough) a widespread shortage. I won't tell you anything else in case you haven't seen it yet.
It's well done. Sure, there's quite a bit here that's designed to appeal to the sensibilities of fans of monster truck rallies and professional wrestling. But there's also a pretty well-realized view of a postapocalyptic civilization and of what it would take to keep that civilization from falling completely apart. I remember reading somewhere that the film relies heavily on Joseph Campbell's writings on myth; I think that's an accurate call.
Watch for Bruce Spence as the Gyro Captain. _Matrix_ fans will recognize him as the Trainman from M3. I'd also be remiss if I failed to mention that this movie, like the first one, was nicely scored by Brian May (of Queen).
I think the third film, _Mad Max Beyond Thuderdome_, has higher production values, more swashbuckling, and a better score. But _The Road Warrior_ is still, in my not entirely humble opinion, the best of the three.",1072483200,5,2329,4.738916256157635
99887,5,0790729342,"The Road Warrior is one of those rare sequels that actually improves in every concievable way to the previous movie.  The first Mad Max was well concieved, but ultimately, the low budget hindered it in many places.  Not so with the Road Warrior, the story, the characters and especially the action are more exciting and interesting than the first.
Developing the post-apocalyptic theme of the first Mad Max, Max is wondering around the Austrailian desert looking for gas and eventually helps a group of people trying to protect their home, possessions and above all gas from a ruthless gang of bikers who look like they were cast from a local leather bar.
While the story sounds fairly generic, the characters and plot rise above what one would normally expect from B-movie action/adventures.  However, the real selling point, of course, is still the action.  The chase scene at the end, in my opinion, has never been equaled in cinema as far as sheer terror, dread and excitement as the bikers slowly try and demolish the semi-truck driven by Max.
Although the DVD itself is given the spartan treatment as far as extras are concerned, the movie itself is more than enough to warrant purchasing it.  A worthy addition to any action fan's library.",1068163200,2,1246,4.8584905660377355

It's the second of three in a series, and although I've never seen the first one, I can say that this one puts the third one to shame.  The Road Warrior is Max, played by a young Mel Gibson, an ex-cop struggling to survive in the post-apocalyptic backroads of Australia.  Civilization as we know it is on the brink of perishing, as gangs of men terrorize the highways in pursuit of the most valuable commodity in these times: gasoline.  Max happens upon what appears to be the last of the civilized world, a group of 20 people banded together raising chickens who also happen to be producing petroleum.  While producing this petroleum, this group find themselves forced to live barricaded from a savage group of motorists that surround their fort-like community and the petroleum producing facility it contains.  Max makes a deal to help them find a way out of this home that has become a prison, but his life is on the line if he can't complete his mission.
The casting is perfect, as is the story, dialogue, plot, script, wardrobe, and cinematography.  Even after twenty years, it is still one of the best action movies you'll find out there.
On a side note, after its release, it won the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards for best foreign film.

One tagline reads 'In the future, cities will become deserts, roads will become battlefields and the hope of mankind will appear as a stranger'. I remember skipping school in the early 80's to stay home and watch this one on cable, Such a great movie that has lost none of it's appeal even after 20 plus years. This is the story of a man, once an officer of the law, who now roams the highways of post-apocolyptic Australia searching for gasoline and maybe a reason to exist. In this time, gasoline is the most valuable commodity, so much so men kill for it. Mel Gibson plays Max, in the role that made him known worldwide. During his travels, he comes across a small settlement that is actually producing petroleum. This settlement is besieged by a group of motorized, murdering, mauraders who want all the fuel. Knowing that the fuel is life, the people in the settlement defend the fuel, but their strength and ability to hold out against this powerful force is becoming less and less each day. Max strikes a deal with them for all the fuel he can carry provided he can get a truck for them so they can haul their tanker of gas out of the wasteland and find a better life in a fabled coastal land. Max fufills his end of the bargin, and leaves the settlement with his fuel, but is attacked and left for dead. Having lost his car, he decides to drive the tanker. This sets up one of the most amazing highway battles ever filmed, as the settlers have turned the tanker into a moving fortess, and the marauders will stop at nothing to stop the tanker and get the gas. This movie is what I would call a nearly pefect example of excellent casting, story, dialogue, plot, script, wardrobe, etc. to make up a near perfect movie. Everything in the movie works so well that your entire attention is focused on the screen, even after multiple viewings. This is actually the second in a trilogy, Mad Max being the first and Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome being the third, but, in my opinion, this one is the best. It's raw, gritty, sometimes humourous and competely enthralling. On a side note, what's up with Warner Brothers and their crummy cardboard packaging? It just seems so flimsy and cheap.

99925,5,0790729342,"I first saw this film in the spring of 1981, immediately after hearing Siskiel and Ebert rave about this follow up to another Australian film I hadn't yet seen.  I was game, and the second I saw it I was hooked.  I had seen movies before that dealt with the world ""after they dropped the bomb,"" but never before had any of those films had such style and attitude.  It wasn't until I saw THE MATRIX in 1999 that I was to see another futuristic film that would have as much of edge.  Even today, this movie has a power and primal simplicity that few can match.
Storywise, the film had a great deal in common with other films--especially Westerns--that feature an anti-social loner as the central hero.  Mel Gibson's ""Mad"" Max Rockatansky (a role he will be reprising next year in MAX MAX IV) is almost a copy of Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name, except that in this instance we know his name and we know something about what made him made from the first film.  Mel Gibson makes this movie work.  His laconic self-isolation, his cynicism, his lack of anything except a grim determination to continue to survive and find another liter of petrol gives the film a magnificent bleakness.  To be honest, it isn't quite easy to tell why he is the good buy and not just as bad as the gang of the Humongous, why he isn't as bad as Vernon Welles's Wez.  But we accept it, and in the end he turns out to have been on the right side.
I heard George Miller interviewed once about the music used in the film.  Despite the punkish look that nearly every character in the film assumes, the music is bland, uninteresting orchestral music, just barely above the level of Musak.  According to Miller, this was intentional.  He felt that in some movies, the music draws attention away from the action, so he used music that was almost impossible to focus upon, forcing all the attention back on to what was happening onscreen.  Oddly enough, since then the music has become more interesting to me than it had before.
I know this is a bit of heresy to hardcore Mad Max fans, but of the three films made so far, this one remains by far my favorite.  The third was watchable, but not really very good, and the first one, while good, lacked the simplicity of story that I think makes this second film so great.  Also, I find the undubbed version to be almost impossible to make out at times, and the dubbed version sounds far too silly.  But maybe I prefer the second because I saw it first, and so many times since.",1053734400,2,2491,4.394335511982571

Sequel to the blockbuster Mad Max, this is the pivotal road rage flick.  Set in post-nuclear holocaust Austrailia, Max is a wandering survivalist who ends up defending a group of refiners from the savage Humongus.  The chase scenes are some of the best ever and the crashes make you want to walk to work for a week.  The characters are memorable and the story keeps you asking for more, and you get it.  Mel Gibson performes incredibly as the merciless Max, who's character has evolved into a cold, indifferent persona, thinking only of himself.

99928,5,0790729342,"There are certain movies that become classics the moment they are released.  ""The Road Warrior"" is such a movie.
While not necessary to understand this movie, it is helpful to watch ""Mad Max"" to understand how Mel Gibson came to be the person he is in this movie.  In ""Mad Max"" we see Mel's family brutalized by a motor cycle gang in a post-apocalyptic Australia.  After exacting his revenge on the gang, he drives off into the sunset, literally.
""The Road Warrior"" shows Max still essentially a nice guy, but interested in continuing to drive into the sunset.  At the beginning of the movie Max is in serious need of a gas station, and finds one in the middle of the desert, besieged by a gang of hot rodders led by an apparently deformed Humungus.
The story line is simple.  The people at the desert refinery want to pack up their gasoline and move off to a place where there are more people, food, and perhaps some remnant of civilization.  Max wants a tank of gas.  In order for the desert people to look for the better place, they need a semi tractor to carry off their gasoline.  Max still wants his tank of gas.  Here is where the two needs meet.  In exchange for helping the refinery people, Max will get all the gas he can carry.
Max seeks out and finds a semi tractor, and manages, as part of one of the best chase scenes of all time, to get the tractor back to the refinery.  With a variety of violent interludes, comes the time to move the gas, which involves another, even better chase scene that lasts pretty much to the end of the movie.  The last chase scene is best experienced in surround sound with the biggest screen you can find.  Turn the sound up.
Each incident in the chase is carefully choreographed so that the viewer won't miss a minute of action, of which there is a lot from the time that everyone bails out from the refinery.  Arrows, guns, car (if you can call some of these behemoths cars) wrecks, creative death, all ending up with a few of the bad guys remaining, a heavily injured Max, and the refinery people heading off to find some semblance of civilization.
This review does not do this movie, which was one of the movies that launched Mel Gibson's carrer, justice.  This movie is one that would take a book to describe.  It's easier to watch it.  One of the best and most potentially realistic of all post-apocalyptic movies, this movie is science fiction as it can be: well-plotted, logically sequenced.

Mel Gibson returns as Max, who has become a laconic wraith wandering a war-ravaged wasteland in search of gasoline. He must choose sides when he comes across a refinery under seige by a band of pillaging maniacs. His journey from mercenary to savior provides the haunting, inspiring subtext for the film, while the spectacular stunts keep your eyes fixed on the screen.

Max fears the job will soon transform him into one of them, but it's when his family is cut down by a gang that Max is truly pushed over into psycho territory. The film ends with Max completing vengeance on the killers and, like all avenging angels, rides off into an uncertain sunset.
This is how 'Road Warrior', second in the Mad Max trilogy of films, begins. Years have passed since the first film, a nuclear war has robbed the world of it's resources, and Max - No longer the humble family man - travels the blasted landscape burnt out and alone. But when a community of villagers is threatened by a vicious band of ruffians, Max's buried soul is slowly drawn out from his ruined identity.
'Road Warrior' is a great film. It uses a tried and true story, but one that is so simple that it is a part of almost every culture. It's every much a western, as the hero faces down the classic posse of villains in a high octane showdown. It also contains threads of the samurai mythos, a lone warrior with his own code of honour, yet bereft of a master and oweing nothing to no one. Also, like Lucas' 'Star Wars' films, many have drawn parallels between this film and the writings of Joseph Campbell.
Mad Mel plays Max perfectly, silent and stoic. This was the role made for Gibson, and it would be a shame if he didn't return to it in the rumoured 4th film. The rest of the actors are great as well, proving once again that Australia is a hidden wealth of acting talent just recently mined again with Crowe, Jackman and Pierce. 'Warrior' also gains credit for it's ingenious art design, it's deep innovative look of a leather jacketed, ruggedly punkish, S&M design that has so often been immitated.

99955,4,0790729342,"There are a lot of loud, whining engines in THE ROAD WARRIOR.  There are people being killed, maimed and immolated.  Of the characters who survive this tale, very few come through without scars.
It's a post-apocalyptic nightmare where hope fights despair.  The irony of Max's character is that even though he's one of the good guys, he's probably the most desperate of the lot.  This is the tale of Max's pain and how he rose above it to become a legend.
This is not the same Max we saw in MAD MAX.  This Max has been poisoned by tragedy and loss, and the anger of the past has refined into a tiny hard ball of self-involvement.  It seems fitting that civilization fell so soon after Max suffered his losses--almost as though when Max lost his place in the world, the world changed to find a new place for him.
THE ROAD WARRIOR touches on one aspect of the end-of-the-world scenario that has always fascinated me:  if the world ends, how many of the survivors will know how and why it happened?
These people don't have time to contemplate that--the once-civilized world has become an enormous hunting ground where the prize is the precious little bit of gasoline that remains.  With the world in shambles, the only things left for most people to do are eat, make love, drive really fast, and die.  In the midst of all these lost souls, one small group has manufactured hope by restarting a refinery and producing enough gasoline to allow them to escape to a better place.
THE ROAD WARRIOR is so far removed from the fallen civilized world it replaced that we don't even get a sense that any of these people even remember what the world was like before.  We haven't got a clue what any of them did prior to the fall.  (Yes, we know Max was a policeman, but we know that from MAD MAX--it's never really touched upon, here.)  In THE ROAD WARRIOR, the conflict has been distilled to an abstraction, with the good guys as desperate in their Hope as the bad guys are desperate in their Despair.
It catches you up from the beginning, rocking your screen and your sensibilities with high-speed stuff that, for once, isn't mindless.  How long can you survive in a world where people are willing to kill you for whatever gasoline remains in the tank of your car?  You bet you'd run, and run fast and hard.  It's a horribly Darwinistic world where the desire to hold on to some small facet of the past drives people to lives so pointless they don't even bother to ask why they're living this way.  Heaven help you if you actually want to take the tools of the past and use them to build a real future.
This is, no question, a 5-star movie in my mind, but it's a 4-star DVD--the print used for the transfer is grainy, and it seems like the illumination was inconsistent.  The whole thing feels a bit washed-out.  Special features?  What's that?  For a legendary film like this, it's criminal not to have given us substantial bonus material.",1019001600,,2928,4.499054820415879

99958,5,0790729342,"This is easily one of the greatest action movies ever made (and, personally, I think it's one of the greatest movies ever made, period.)  It is also one of those rare movies that defines its genre, and yet, at the same time, transcends its genre.  Actually, you have three different genres being represented in this film that, in the years since, have become intertwined as the norm for this type of movie because of ""The Road Warrior""'s influence.  You have the much-copied post-apocalyptic wasteland, populated by barbaric savages and helpless victims; you have the classic western and the classic western's ""reluctant hero,"" represented here by Mad Max, the drifting loner, scarred by his past, who only comes to the aid of others when it serves him; and, of course, you have the spectacular car chases, amazing stunts and crashes and huge explosions of the modern action movie.  ""The Road Warrior"" brought all three of these elements together, and you can still see them in movies today, such as the much-inferior ""Waterworld"" and ""The Postman"" (man, Costner must've liked this movie too--you'd think he'd get it right eventually.)
And, as an action movie, ""The Road Warrior"" has yet to be topped.  All of the stunts, chases, crashes, explosions you see on the screen are 100% real.  No computer enhancement, no technical junk -- when you see a guy drive into a car on a motorcycle and he flies about 75 feet through the air, it's real.  And when I say this movie transcends its genre, I'm talking about the style in which it's directed.  All of the action becomes almost operatic because of the expert direction and musical score.  It comes across as a beautiful-looking action movie, in spite of all the violence and carnage.
  I wouldn't hesitate to rate ""The Road Warrior"" as one of the best action movies of all time and Mel Gibson's Mad Max as one of the greatest (if not THE greatest) action ""hero"" in cinema history.  If this movie were made today, the writers would probably have him cracking lame one-liners throughout the film, but, instead, Max hardly speaks at all (the strong, silent type that also goes with the western genre) -- his actions speak for him.  I wish Hollywood at least attempted to make action movies and action movie heroes like this these days (well, come to think of it, I guess they did attempt it with ""Waterworld,"" and that became one of the biggest money-losers in film history, so I guess the moral is:  Don't try to duplicate perfection.)",1010620800,,2481,4.779859484777518
99959,5,0790729342,"The best of the Mad Max trilogy (its predecessor was the cult classic ""Mad Max"" itself and its successor was the oft-maligned ""Beyond Thunderdome""), the post-apocalyptic ""Road Warrior"" remains a gripping adrenaline-boosted thrill ride nearly two decades after its release. It's been shown dozens of time on cable channels but still is fresh and vivid.
The key to its power is the stripped-down nature of the narrative and the use of character archetypes. We don't know much about Max, and we don't have to. He's a wanderer, a loner, a lost soul. We've seen this character many times before, and we already know his motivations and that he'll end up doing right, despite his apparent amorality.
The villains are duly villainous, and indeed, memorably vicious. The good guys are appropriately virtuous, but, as the twist ending shows, cleverer and more brutally pragmatic than they seem.
Mel Gibson, at this relatively early point in his career, is rightly low-key and subdued, and avoids the self-congratulatory smirkiness of his recent films. Bruce Spence as the daft and opportunistic Gyro Captain also turns in some nice work. Virginia Hey, who later memorably portrayed Zhaan in TV's ""Farscape"", has a small role here as a warrior woman for the good guys. And who can forget Emil Minty as the Feral Kid? (Actually, I just like saying ""Emil Minty"".)
But really, characters aside, what carries the movie is the epic car chase in the finale, one tanker truck and its handful of defenders versus a convoy of motorcycles, pickups, and dune buggies. Everything about the chase scene is done perfectly, from the performances to the effects to the musical score. This high-speed kinetic ballet careens along full-throttle through a pyrotechnic nightmare of devastation and chaos. It has yet to be topped.
Fittingly, the movie ends on a melancholy note, with Max still in the wilderness, a man alone. The now-aged Feral Kid, the narrator, provides the coda: ""As for the Road Warrior...he lives now, only in my dreams.""",1006214400,3,2012,5.045045045045045
99960,4,0790729342,"In the year 1981, a sequel to the 1979 film ""Mad Max"" was released in Australia and later in America. Mel Gibson returned in his role as Max Rockatanski. But this time more like an anti-hero and a post-nuclear hero rather than a future cop. This movie is quite different from the first. The story has changed a bit by making it during a post-apocalyptic time period as the result from a nuclear war in Australia. This movie seems like it is just an action movie. There is lots of action in it. Max still has the Canyonero he did at the end of ""Mad Max"" but loses it in this movie. This time he has a traveling companion which is a dog named Dog. He is killed later in the movie which is something Max loses as well. This story is during a time when gasoline is rare and almost impossible to find. Humanity has no hope and a compound of survivors is guarding the last tanker of fuel. Max does happen to become the key to helping the people sneak it out without the scum outside getting it.

It is by far the best of the three with a great storyline that takes from the first of the series and progresses it to the third nicely. The story as a whole is better if you have seen the first of the series but it may not appeal to the US audience as much.
As for action there are not a lot of movies that can touch this classic for realistic action that enhances the story as opposed to detracting from it.

99963,3,0790729342,"The second of the Mad Max trilogy, The Road Warrior, has some of the most exciting chase sequences ever filmed, but as a story, it lacks the intensity of the first film in the series. Perhaps this was inevitable - the first film ended with the background and character of Max established, with his world destroyed. The Road Warrior stays true to the first film in that there are no radical departures in setting and tone - but there are no great surprises and an air of predictability hangs over the film. The action is almost non-stop and very impressively filmed. It does leave the feeling that there's not much else to offer apart from the action, while some of the characters, such as the Gyro Captain and Humungous, seem overly cartoonish and detract from the dramatic impact that the film tried to maintain throughout. A rare quiet moment between Max and the Feral Kid, a small boy who clearly had lived all his short life in the post apocalyptic world, was the highlight of the film for me; Max clearly saw something of his own son, killed in the first film, in the Feral Kid. More of these moments, to offset the relentless action sequences, would have made the Road Warrior a better all-round movie. Although a brief recap of the first film is included in this movie's opening minutes, I'd still recommend that the original Mad Max is viewed before the Road Warrior.",996883200,3,1375,4.616326530612245

But director George Miller had been watching a lot of Westerns and realized why people had gravitated to the Max character.  Slowly he came up with the idea for the sequel and went to work, this time with a bigger budget.  The film takes place shortly after the original film, where by this point, society has decayed almost completely and all that matters is survival from the biker gangs who crave gasoline to power their vehicles.  And in all this chaos is Max, an ex cop, gone mad from the loss of his friends and family.  It's interesting to point out that Max had humanity in the 1st film, then lost it after his losses, so in this film there is very little humanity...just a dog eat dog world with every man for himself.  Max is a burnout.  My favorite scene is when Papagallo (Mike Preston), the leader of the small group with gas, starts attacking Max, asking him if he enjoys seeing each day blur into another out there on the road and what was it that burnt Max out.  And when Pappagallo realizes it was loss that did this to Max he lets him have it by saying ""You think you're special?"" and godes him to the point where Max punches him to the ground.  A nerve was struck.  That scene is so powerful and is one of the reasons why this film is such a winner.  The sets, characters and locations are first rate, giving a real feel for a desolate wasteland.  If you haven't experienced this movie, rent it on DVD and watch the Widescreen version (2.35:1).  Although I recommend seeing the original Mad Max first, it won't hurt if you don't, thanks to the nice recap at the beginning of Part 2.  Because Mad Max was not a big hit here in America they decided to call the sequel ""The Road Warrior"", but everywhere else in the world it's known as ""Mad Max 2"" or ""Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior"".  This was done because Americans might not go see a sequel when they've never even heard of the original.  The trailer you get on the DVD in the USA even refers to the movie as ""Mad Max 2"" and one thing I found interesting was that the Humungus has a different voice on the trailer from the voice he uses in the actual movie.  Did he get dubbed?  The DVD looks and sounds great thanks to Warner Brothers, who remastered the picture and sound quality.  One disappointment is that the latest VHS release included a retrospective documentary on the film that is not included on the DVD.  Let's hope they include it on the next release soon.  I love all three Mad Max movies, but I will admit that Mad Max 2 is the best of the trilogy, not to be missed.  See how Mel Gibson became an international star.  See Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior.

100034,4,0790729342,"According to the production notes that come with this beautifully restored version of the film, the filmmakers read books by Joseph Campbell before writing the screenplay for The Road Warrior.  What they had tapped into intuitively with the first movie, Mad Max (1979), they brought to full consciousness in the sequal.  It shows.  The Road Warrior is about story telling, it's about how culture, religion and the myths of the hero evolve in the primitive conditions of human beings fighting to survive upon the earth.  The characters are archetypal, the situations are primal, the technology has been reduced to what would remain in the wastelands after an atomic war.  There is so much at work here in terms of universal themes: the tension between ID And civilization, order and chaos, civilized religion and paganism, mind and body.  These themes would reappear in the 1985 sequal Beyond Thunderdome as Tina Turner attempts to carve a city out of the wasteland, the mind-body split coming in the form of Master Blaster, but that's another movie). Here things are grim indeed: A policeman has been reduced to scavanger and seems indifferent to the attempts of the refinery tribe to rebuild society (as Max puts it in Beyond Thunderdome to the tribe of children wanting to return to their city of birth, ""There's nothing left. It's all gone!"")  The brutal mass-murdering Humongous, a cross between a WWF wrestler and Doctor Doom., is a vile evil villian but his voice cracks when he confesses a yearning for an end to violence and pain.  We get a sense that the morality of the Mad Max world is complex and not easily reduced.  Although the two-dimensional characters are grinning, savage beasts of violence, at least they are honest.  It is the good guys who betray Max in the end.  And the last image of Max standing in the wilderness, without car, without dog, without home or safety, left to find shelter in the midst of nothing, existing now only in memory, is one of the greatest and most powerful moments in film history.",982713600,,2030,4.838150289017341

100037,5,0790729342,"Action movies remind me of the true beauty of motion pictures, how a story can be told through visual arrangement and motion across the frame, instead of dead dialog and two motionless actors conversing.  Those movies are like filmed plays, while others draw from their silent black & white roots, telling stories without words.  Road Warrior contains one of the finest examples of this - such a small moment, a minor obstacle overcome, yet which dances boldly across the screen like a painter.
Here is the magic, shot by shot.  Halfway through the final chase sequence, a red hotrod approaches Max's big rig truck from behind with intention to kill him.  In a shot that has been copied many times, Max emerges from the cab and thrusts his shotgun into the camera - forced perspective, moving right then left, back to front in a zig-zag across the screen.  Bad guy's head explodes like a firecracker, and we are treated to a scream of delight from Max's wild wolf-boy friend - an animalistic reaction to violence ironically given from a child raised by animals.

That little story is closed by the famous and almost peaceful shot of one man flipping head over heels in a horizontal fall, again in forced perspective flying at the camera.  Now another series of jump cuts as we jump back to the red hotrod and it's fight to stay out from under Max's huge wheels.  In a beautiful play of movement, the car dances in front of Max's truck, darting back and forth in front of Max and our screens like a dangling carrot, until we have a third masterful forced-perspective shot: the camera approaches the grill of the truck, then moves up and into the cab at Max, when Max finally ends this car's misery by nailing it in an explosion of gasoline and metal bits.

Known widely as the film that launched Mel Gibson to international fame The  Road Warrior is an incredible exercise in creating a pure adrenaline  rush.
Set in post-apocalyptic Australia, the loner Max (Mel Gibson)  travels in his car through the outback with a dog as his companion.  He  encounters a man known as the Gyro Captain (Bruce Spence) who threatens to  kill Max.  Max, however, reverses the position and becomes the aggressor.  In a desperate attempt to save his life, the Gyro Captain tells Max about  an oil refinery not far away.  Max, with his dog and hostage, reaches the  refinery and observes.
It seems like a relatively stable place but the  real problem is a group of bizarre warriors led by a hockey masked muscular  man known as the Humungus.  His warriors are vicious people who will stop  at nothing to get that oil and the entire refinery.  He offers a deal to  the people inside:  Just leave everything behind and he will offer them  safe passage.  He gives them 24 hours to decide.  Max, though, offers the  people another deal.  Let him bring a rig big enough to haul the tank of  gas and in return give him as much gasoline he can carry.  They accept the  deal and from here Max must bring the rig back and defend the fuel against  Humungus and his warriors.
It's not often you find films this exciting.  The Road Warrior features not one, but two of the best car chases in film  history (the other three go to Raiders of the Lost Ark, Ronin, and The  French Connection).  The first major chase in the film involves Max  attempting to bring the rig into the refinery while Humungus and his men  try to stop him.  The last fifteen minutes features one of the all-time  ultimate action sequences:  a near fifteen minute long chase with the  entire gang after Max and the gasoline.

Even though the actors were speaking  in English with Australian accents, they were dubbed over with American  English-speaking voice actors. Thanks to this,  `Mad Max' had a Hong Kong  martial arts action film feel. Also, the props, vehicles, and sets had the  look of being more improvisation than design.
Then along came `The Road  Warrior'. The difference was amazing. It is easy to see why this `Mad Max'  entry is considered the high point of the trilogy. Much more elaborate  sets, vehicles, etc. The action sequences are tighter, and more exciting.  And, thanks to using the original character dialog, rather than dubbing it  over, you even get to hear Mel Gibson in his actual voice, with the slight  Aussie accent! It made for an interesting ride.

He barely  survives, in fact, and the last we see of him is standing bloodied but  unbowed and defiant amid a field of wreckage-at sundown, appropriately  enough.
There are so many great characters and lines in this movie that  it would be impossible to review them all in 1,000 words.  I will just  mention Bruce Spence as the Gyrocaptain, and Emil Minty, as the Feral Kid.  Spence is the ""sidekick,"" bringing a bit of comic relief in a wonderfully  acted part.  Minty is the sort of surrogate for the son lost in _Mad Max_,  and the spiritual hand-off from ""father"" to ""son"" at  the end of the story is poignant.
There are some great plot twists for  anyone lucky enough to be seeing this for the first time, as well as irony  by the bucketful.  Perhaps the strongest point of the film is its gritty,  unsentimental realism.  The bad guys don't win, but neither are they  totally wiped out.  The ""heroes,"" in large part, don't survive.  The  spiritually flawed somehow eke through, leaving us with a bit of a murky  moral.
A brooding soundtrack and excellent cinematography round out what  is in every sense a classic film.",959126400,,1624,4.573426573426573
100084,4,0790729342,"This is a very very great movie,and it has the value to have created one of the coolest heroes of all the times (The first one is a sort of prologue,for me...) ,but ev'ry one knows the THIRD ONE -MAD MAX BEYOND  THUNDERDOME- had MORE success and was ...simply the BEST. ""Road  Warrior"" is pure action and visual impact. Several years after the  first one's events,there was a great World War that leaded to the total  collapse of each form of civilization. There were nuclear exchanges too,but  we viewers will see their effects on the environment into ""Mad Max  beyond thunderdome"" scenario. However,Max is becoming a loner psycho,a  scavenger  wandering into a not-specificated Wasteland (probably following  an ecological disaster occurred prior the first ""MAD MAX"") in  costant search for food and...FUEL !  .He will meet a compound of  survivors,attacked  by a weird and bloody band of Marauders. All the events  connected to this small fight will lead Max to the way of  REDEMPTION.
""Road warrior"" is an intense movie with a bit of  poetry in it,and the BEST CHASE SCENE of the Cinema history,but there's a  lack of a substantial plot,one thing you can find into the MASTERPIECE of  the series,MAD MAX 3. Yes,this one has created the myth of Mad Max,but the  third one is incredible !  Mad Max purists (like me) have  UNDERSTOOD the lesson,and there is a critical revalutation of the third  one,that however was a box-office smasher.",958694400,,1439,4.8838174273858925
100085,5,0790729342,"The second of the Mad Max series, the  Road Warrior(Mad Max 2 in Australia) takes place months after the events of the first movie, and finds Max(Mel Gibson) rogue in a world nearing a post nuclear age. Roving  biker gangs, looking more like a twist between hell's angels, bad WWF  wrestlers, and barbarian warriors, terrorize a small oil community, hoping  to gain the fuel which has become more valuable than gold. Max helps the  fledging group, only more for himself than anyone else. This is a high  powered movie, incorporating some of best stunts and car chase sequences in  the series. Superb.",958521600,,600,4.823529411764706
100086,5,0790729342,"In 1982 this epic action film was released here in America as The Road Warrior.. In Australia and Europe it was Mad Max 2. The film that made Mel Gibson a movie star. A landmark action film that has been emulated  considerably since it's release.
The world has finally caved in after  wars and social decay. Australia has become an epic wasteland where it's  remaining survivors hunt down the remaing gasoline. A bizarre and vicious  pack of barbarians led by Lord Humongous kill any and everyone who gets in  their way of the precious fuel.  Max now a loner and roams the land for the  fuel becomes a reluctant ally with a motley but tight knit group that has  established a small fuel depot. An epic battle ensues when the ragtag group  decides to transport its fuel to ""The Promised Land""
This  explosive and spectacular film still lives up to the critical and public  applauds here in 2000. Mel Gibson's Max is a futuristic take on Clint  Eastwood's Man with no name. Bruce Spence as the Gyrocaptain, Mike Preston  as Papagallow, Virginia Hey as The Warrior Woman and Emil Minty as the  memorable feral kid are some of the standouts in the film. Brian May's  exciting music score adds to the tension and action of the film.  George  Miller created an epic masterpiece and all but the greatest  ""sequel"" ever made. This DVD edition is a must have for action  film fans",957139200,8,1371,4.590909090909091
100087,5,0790729342,"The Road Warrior (or Mad Max 2 as it is known in Australia) is a non-stop rollercoaster ride of a film. Better than the original, which most sequels fail to do (this sequel has no soppy romance that was necessary in the  original), this film explodes with total action and carnage. The final  chase scene is the most exiting in the anals of motion picture history. The  original Mad Max is set during the fall of civilisation...In Mad Max 2  civilisation has gone, and a new order has taken over. With more crashes  than the original, and more action, this film is a classic action  flick...the third film is, in my mind, nowhere as good as the original or  this film.",956016000,,668,4.471074380165289

100089,5,0790729342,"This was Melvin Gibson's finest film.  Though he later starred in some mega-dollar, Oscar-quality hits (Bird on a Wire, The River), The Road Warrior represented the absolute pinnacle of Melvin's acting career.  The  first movie, I think, in which Melvin's voice was not dubbed (so as to  render his heavy Outback accent decipherable to American viewers), The Road  Warrior showcased Melvin's full theatrical range - talking, frowning,  walking, and driving vehicles.  Melvin demonstrated an unparalleled ability  to bond empathetically with other characters - his dog, the helicopter  pilot and the Feral Kid - in a fashion calculated to bring tears (both joy  and grief) to one's eyes.  The Road Warrior is, for thespian Melvin Gibson,  an extremely hard act to follow.",954720000,3,770,5.2727272727272725

Exciting, atmospheric film with ample violent action.  Sometimes presented on TV with an overdubbed ""Americanized""  opening and closing  narration, which is laughably inferior to the  original.  Not just a superior action film, but a thought-provoking and  oddly sensitive work as well.  Often imitated, never duplicated.  Highly  recommended.",953596800,2,501,5.648648648648648

A broken man, Max, finds what he thinks is a quick deal and winds up  becoming the hero. Classic western influence, with a slightly hipper rap.  The costumes and vehicles show inspiration and have been copied time and  again. When Max says, ""You wanna get outta here, talk to me"" he  proves why he is now a box office smash.
