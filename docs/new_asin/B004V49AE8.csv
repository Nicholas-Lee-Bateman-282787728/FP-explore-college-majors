8506208,2,B004V49AE8,"While there is a good amount of flesh on display (mostly female), the director is rather skilled in spoiling the mood... inappropriate music, unnecessary jarring scenes, and there is very little eroticism.

The main actor doesn't do much except growl alot... avoid this if you have other options",1375142400,,295,5.145833333333333
8506209,1,B004V49AE8,I first rented this movie from Scarecrow on Laser. This is probably my favorite all time Erotic Chinese flick. Unfortunatly the DVD didn't play. It sticks during the first 10 minutes. I have to forward the movie 10 minutes tobe able to see the rest of the film. I wonder if other DVD copys do the same? I am returning mine...,1158969600,,325,4.344262295081967

8506211,4,B004V49AE8,"I'll be buying this DVD (hopefully courtesy of an Amazon prize for first review!) for three reasons. Firstly, I've seen it already and think it more fun and deliciously sexier than Erotic Ghost Story One. The acting is ok,  the settings and special effects are pretty good, and it's a huge romp  almost the entire family can enjoy (ok, my wife thinks it very silly and  tedious; perhaps I see more in it). Secondly, there's no real violence on  show. Just  supernatural silliness;  violence and sex shouldn't mix, and in  this film, the tongue is placed firmly between the cheeks. Thirdly, the  actors are in extraordinarily good form. Or forms. Very good forms indeed.  There's no pornography here, just some mild erotica and an over-the-top  story and a whole lot of beauty. Good almost-clean fun, in fact.",963187200,23,808,4.8321167883211675
