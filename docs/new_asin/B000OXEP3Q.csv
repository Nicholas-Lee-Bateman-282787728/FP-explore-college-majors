How does one person's mind have this much creativity?!?  Naphtalia is totally wonderful!  You'll laugh, you'll be in awe and you will most definitely want to start playing with your own set of eyes!!  This would be a perfect gift for a person of *any* age, and after watching this enchanting and hilarious DVD I dare you to try not to play with your eyes!!",1231545600,,479,4.459770114942529
