Big Daddy: A good for nothing man decides to take care of a child that suddenly appears on his doorstep.

50 First Dates: A man who dates many women from out of state suddenly falls for a local girl who has a strange problem: her memory resets every night.

Mr. Deeds: A man who supports his hometown from a pizza place inherits millions of dollars from his dead relative. A newspaper girl follows him around pretending to be a damsel in distress to get inside scoop.",1363824000,,527,4.46875
