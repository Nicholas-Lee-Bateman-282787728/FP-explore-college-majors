8149420,4,B000JBX0PC,"The great jazz pianist Dave Brubeck and Yale University's Ezra Laderman come to talk about a project they are both a part of. It involves composing a work some part of which is in the spirit of a great composer they most love. Brubeck takes Bach as his 'composer'. He explains that Jazz musicians most love Bach because of his power of improvisation, and the part it played in his composition. Laderman also says he might have chosen Bach but chooses Schuman. He contrasts his own 'gentle composition' with that of Brubeck's 'blockbuster' work. Charlie Rose asks Brubeck at seventy- three if he does not think to give up performing. Brubeck says he does eighty one - nighters each year and performing is what he loves most best. One irony of his career as composer is that his most famous number 'Take Five' was not composed by him but rather by his saxophonist Paul Desmond. He speaks about his own composition and his gratified that MOD records has promised to bring out all he has written. This is a quiet intelligent conversation.",1211673600,,1034,4.686813186813187

He says that when he begins a novel he has a certain image in mind, and a clear idea of the end. The knowing the beginning and knowing the end gives the work shape. He is grateful that the Rabbit material has proven so rich. He speaks about the third novel ""Rabbit is Rich"" as somehow the easiest to write, and a favorite.
