6667228,4,B00NLZACG8,"Loopy de Loop is frequently described as Hanna-Barberas lost character. He was a relatively long-running character (debuting in 1959 and ending in 1965), but unlike popular HB characters Huckleberry Hound, Yogi Bear, and The Flintstones  whose prime-time series ran approximately during the same time as Loopys run  you couldn't see Loopys adventures on your television screen. Loopy de Loop cartoons were only shown in movie theaters.

Barely mentioned in most animation histories (and, oddly, almost not mentioned at all in most books specifically about Hanna-Barbera), Loopy de Loop is animations lost er wolf. His trademark self-introduction, I am Loopy de Loop, the good wolf, tells us a lot. Unlike most stereotypical fictional wolves, known to be bad, evil, sneaky, ferocious (theres even a really annoying song about big and bad wolves, produced by another animation company), Loopy is kind, friendly, helpful, and a self-appointed good Samaritan. Or, as its frequently quoted in the cartoons themselves, hes kind, considerate, and charming. For that, he is rewarded by the very people he helps by being run out of town or beaten up  just because hes a wolf. (Kinda like a lot of Casper the Friendly Ghost cartoons, frankly.)

His most prominent trait is his mangling of the English language in a very bad French-Canadian accent. Like most other Hanna-Barbera characters, he is naked (hes a wolf after all), except for a hat (a classic toque style, in this case), and something around his neck (here, an ascot). There are a total of 48 Loopy de Loop cartoons on this two-disc DVD-R collection. Thats over five hours of Loopy de Loop cartoons. They are fun to watch in small doses, but I don't recommend watching the entire set in one sitting!

Some of the things you will witness watching these cartoons include Red Riding Hood with a shotgun; Loopy thinking he is a dog after a visit to a psychiatrist; various neer-do-well wolves who do not like Loopy because he is nice; a walking egg with a shotgun; Loopy frequently being shot into space; Loopy attending a people party, where all the partygoers are apparently Peter Lorre, Ed Sullivan, Jimmy Durante, and Maurice Chevalier imitators; hipster wolves; elderly Musketeers; a horse that talks like Jimmy Durante; a huge tough-guy mouse; and a lot of John and Marsha references (a very popular Stan Freberg novelty single of the era). Notable creators on the series include voice actors Daws Butler (who voices Loopy), Don Messick, Paul Frees, and Hal Smith. June Foray (Rocket J. Squirrel) and Jean Vander Pyl (Wilma Flintstone) provide practically all the female characters. Later in the series, both Janet Waldo (Judy Jetson) and Mel Blanc (do I have to tell you?) make cameo voice appearances, for all you completists out there.

One of the more interesting things about the Loopy de Loop series is that since it was produced as a handful of individual cartoons over a number of years (as opposed to the usual series method of getting an order for a season of 13 half-hour episodes, and having them produced by the same creative team all in a short period of time), is that the animation and design of the series fluctuates quite a bit from cartoon to cartoon  further making it a unique Hanna-Barbera series. Since this is presented by Warner Archive (under the Hanna-Barbera Classic Collection banner), it has not been restored to the extent that the more popular (and first released) HB series were, but the occasional cartoon with some scratches or uncorrected color is a small distraction when opposed to not having these officially available.

8679059,5,B00NLZACG8,"This is it. This the cartoon that changed my life creatively in 1988. Studying in college to be an animator, up to that point I just hadn't gotten around yet to creating any new original characters that interested me. But although I had once thought at the time that I had seen pretty much everything HB had ever done, I accidentally stumbled across this cartoon for the very first time that year.

The idea of a goldhearted French hippy wolf devoting himself to doing good for others despite cruel stereotyping against him due to his being a wolf instantly hooked me, and I've specialized in wolves ever since. Some episodes are better drawn than others, of course (all depends on personal taste and the artist), but all are still very much enjoyable.

They simply don't make them like this anymore... sadly.

It's wonderful to finally see this collection available for purchase, and I for one am leaping at the opportunity to get it! Now if only it were available digitally as well... ;)",1504828800,,989,4.705202312138728

8679065,3,B00NLZACG8,"The cartoon was good but I would have preferred if the packaging was as in the former Hanna-Barbara's releases eg Penelope Pitstop, Wacky races. This one is a DVD-R ie probably printed out only when the orders come in.  While it makes sense for WB, I would have liked it in the former more sophisticated packaging.  Also previously the cartoon would come in its original airing format ie there would be other cartoons featured ie between two episodes of Loopy DeLoop.  That would break the monotony of having too much of Loopy although that was the primary reason I bought this DVD.  Nonetheless I am not too unhappy but would then this should have been offered at less than USD20 which would have made more sense.",1432512000,5,714,4.642857142857143
