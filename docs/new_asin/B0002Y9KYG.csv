8034604,4,B0002Y9KYG,An early work that is a typical B-movie that William Holden was forced into by movie studios that simply either didn't care or had no idea of his vast range of talent.,1377734400,,167,4.25
8034605,5,B0002Y9KYG,"Meet the Stewarts is a delightful, romantic comedy starring William Holden and Frances Dee.  Mr. Holden's character, Mike is a lawyer who was financially supported by his sister.  Ms. Dee's character is Candy, a spoiled. pampered, and rich daddy's little girl.  Grant Mitchell is wonderful portraying Candy's father.  He honesty believes that  Mike is only interested in marrying his daughter for her money.  Mike loves Candy dearly but doesn't want to marry Candy because of her money.  Mike poses the question to Candy if she can live on budgets. Candy replies, "" I don't know if I can eat them, but I'm certain I'll love 'em.""  If you have seen the movie ""Woman of the Year,"" you will thoroughly  enjoy the cooking scene in Meet the Stewarts.  It is definitely more hilarious.  Candy has no intentions of living on a budget, and seemingly disguises it ... UNTIL the banker comes to visit ... Candy spent a portion of  the  mortgage payment on a new dress.  Can Mike forgive her?  Will Candy run back to her daddy?  or Will Candy find another way  to prove to herself, her daddy, and Mike that she will survive on a budget?  Why does Mike brawl with another man?  I encourage you to purchase this movie.  It is a relatively short film.  I wish it was on DVD.  Enjoy all the one - liners!",1193184000,2,1289,4.537117903930131
