2583321,3,B000FS9FGW,"Ken Stott looks the part of Rebus more than John Hannah, and Claire Price DEFINITELY looks the part of Siobhan more than Gayanne Potter.  The supporting cast is equally effective, and the stories (Ian Rankin's The Falls and Fleshmarket Close) are translated to the screen reasonably well.

Still, things are definitely lacking here.  Gone was every ounce of Rebus' ongoing personal narrative, and the stories are much weaker for it.  Gone also was that sense of self-destructiveness that is so very Rebus.  These two stories have been reduced to simply average British mysteries.  Not bad by any means, but no where near as gripping as Hannah's Rebus.  If you're looking for Ian Rankin's stories to come alive on the screen, pick up John Hannah's Rebus.",1155945600,40,753,4.976
2583322,2,B000FS9FGW,"The gentle man on the cover is not John Hannah of The Mummy Fame there is another Rebus which includes author Ian Rankin's Scottish Detective Rebus Hide and Seek, Knots and Crosses  and Tooth and Nail are the 2nd, 1st and 3rd books which introduce Rebus.  The 1st 3 Scottish TV series were named the same.  I first saw them while living in Dundee I'm not sure if this was the first attempt at portraying Rebus but this is not the succesful Scottish TV series like Taggart",1149033600,2,471,4.390804597701149
2583323,5,B000FS9FGW,"Set in Scotland this is a BBC television series starring John Hannah as an Edinburgh Homicide Detective. Well written and very well acted. Shows the seedy side of Scotland the tourists don't see. The Scottish accents are hard to understand at times but the story lines more than make up for it. Highly Recommended..!!.......Additional Comment: when I did this review there was no photo of the set posted so I made a mistake....here's the correction....the original ""REBUS"" starred John Hannah and is more ""gritty and realistic"" than the later versions starring Ken Stott as ""Rebus"". Both are the same character with two different actors and filmed at different times....both are good but the ""original"" with John Hannah I believe is better. Sorry for the confusion.",1148342400,24,765,5.128
2583334,5,B000FS9FGW,"Even though this was back a few years, I loved the acting and the action in these DVDs.  I believed all the characters, also how they played off each other.",1370649600,,156,4.2
2583335,5,B000FS9FGW,"My husband and I really like all the British mysteries, but this one is a bit different.  It makes you think about it.  There is a lot of discussion after we have watched Rebus.",1363651200,,177,4.176470588235294
2583336,3,B000FS9FGW,"I love watching TV shows that take place in other countries.  In this case, we have two mysteries that take place in Edinburgh, Scotland.

The show is comparable in a few ways to Wallander (the English version).  The detectives are similar in age and marital status.  Wallander is a bit depressed, but Rebus is generally upbeat.  Both are dedicated to their job of solving complex murder cases.  Both are frequently interrupted by calls on their cell phones, and I was amused when I heard Rebus' ringtone, because it bears a striking resemblance to Wallander's.

A problem I have with Rebus is that I had a lot of trouble understanding what was being said by many of the characters.  With the first episode, we could understand enough to follow the story with no problem.  With the second episode, between the somewhat mumbled lines and the thick accents (Scots and Kurdish), I could not follow the story.

The normal solution is to turn on English subtitles.  Unfortunately, there are NO SUBTITLES on this disc, at least not the one that we got.  Obviously this is a problem for those who are hard of hearing, too.

I travel a lot and am used to hearing a lot of different versions of English and a wide variety of accents.  But Scots is one of the more difficult accents.  They also use different words, or maybe slang, or maybe we just weren't hearing it right.  I imagine this is less of a problem for UK viewers than it is for Americans.

I liked the characters, I liked the first story, but with this much trouble with the dialog, we won't be watching more of this series.",1357257600,,1578,4.5587188612099645
2583337,4,B000FS9FGW,"This  follow up to the pilot starring John Hannah introduces a steadier, less destructive Rebus in the person of Ken Stott. I found it refreshing and less distracting than Hannah's take with more focus on the story and fewer poorer choices in his personal life. For fans of Brit fiction this has the excellent writing, execution and production values that most American TV can aspire to do.",1346198400,,390,4.82089552238806
2583338,5,B000FS9FGW,"Excellent - never boring; very subtle. Ian Rankin's writings are genius !! The book is usually better than the movie, but in this case the televised episodes do not lose their edge.",1341014400,,181,4.6875
2583339,5,B000FS9FGW,"Most of this story takes place in Edinburg, Scotland.and any one who has served on a PD  will  recognize the loner cops, the slightly bent. The booze and confusion of working cases. Rebus has his  peccadilloes and has a number of stumbles but you relate to his character. Give it a try.",1330560000,,286,4.461538461538462
2583340,5,B000FS9FGW,Ken Stott is great as the curmudgeonly aging detective paired with the attractive and smart Sioban. Often gruesome crimes leave Stott at odds with the rules of police work and he plays the rogue cop oh so well. The cinematography paints an interesting portrait of Edinboro (sp?)as well. Too bad they didn't keep making the series.,1264204800,,330,4.910714285714286
2583341,5,B000FS9FGW,Why are the British so good at these murder mysteries?  You will want the entire set.,1261353600,,85,4.3125
2583342,2,B000FS9FGW,"This is a jolly Rebus without the heft of soul or grittiness needed for true Rebusness.  Stott, though he might look the part, is too full of himself, he sports a self-satisfied air that is almost anti-Rebus.  The Hannah Rebus is far closer to the real thing plus it has Cafferty.  Hannah is perhaps not ideal but he is a good enough actor to pull it off.  Skip the Stott and go for the Hannah Rebus.  That's my advice.",1221868800,4,419,4.253164556962025
2583343,5,B000FS9FGW,"""Rebus,"" is another superb British crime drama/police procedural television series, based on the work of best selling Scottish author Ian Rankin.  We've been seeing this series on BBC America, though it is not a British Broadcasting Corporation production; rather one by Independent Television (ITV).  The series is set in the beautiful tourist city of Edinburgh, capital of Scotland, as are the author's works; however, in this production, as in the books on which it's based, we see the beautiful tourist city only in passing, on our way to such menacing high-rise subsidized housing, council housing as the British call it, as ""Knoxland,""where the action takes place.

Rankin's first Rebus novel, ""Knots & Crosses,"" was published in 1987, to great critical acclaim.  He was accredited with helping to create ""tartan noir,""a Scottish take on the usual mystery; tougher, bloodier, more nasty-minded, and delivered with that sardonic Scots humor. Since then, he's won the prestigious ""Edgar,"" and become the United Kingdom's best selling mystery author; his works have been translated into 22 languages.  Luckily for us all, he's published quite a bit, so that the TV series has his actual works on which to be based.

  The novels used for Set 1 have been adapted for TV by Daniel Boyle (AKA Danny Boyle), greatly talented Celtic writer/director, who's written such series as ""Hamish Macbeth,"" ""Inspector Morse,"" and ""Taggart,"" and has given us such movies as ""Trainspotting,"" and ""Twenty-Eight Days Later."" He conveys the tension and atmosphere of the originals admirably; gives us many plot twists and turns, and the ironic local wit.  Location photography in the city of Edinburgh is excellent, giving us its damp, cold, foggy ambiance.  Disk 1, ""The Falls,"" concerns a really unhappy high profile family.  It gives us the Glasgow-born Sharon Small, who plays Detective Sergeant Barbara Havers, loyal sidekick in the ""Inspector Lynley"" mystery series, as Miranda Masterson, Rebus's current love interest. Disk 2, ""Fleshmarket Close,""concerns recent immigrants to the U.K., and native-born racist bias against them.

This production has been happily recast from the previous series that starred Scottish actor John Hannah.  In his place, we have Ken Stott, a much-admired TV actor, as Detective Inspector Rebus.  And let me be the first to say that, pleasant as I find it to look at Hannah, he may have been too slightly-built to play a police officer, and too pretty to play a hard-bitten, hard-drinking eccentric man.  Stott is a revelation, bringing great gravitas to the brooding cop.  Detective Sergeant Siobhan Clarke has also been recast, with Claire Price; so has Detective Chief Superintendent Gill Templer, a former lover of Rebus's, with Jennifer Black.  And there's a further very welcome development indeed: the addition of subtitles.  If you love Scottish mysteries, and aren't familiar with this series, it's time to get acquainted with it.  And I think you'll find it's a keeper.",1211068800,26,2998,5.273684210526316
8126022,5,B000FS9FGW,The discs arrived promptly. And they were as promised. The shows themselves were quite enjoyable.,1526688000,,97,5.533333333333333
8126023,5,B000FS9FGW,"DI John Rebus the most famous fictional Scottish detective. The books written by Ian Rankin have been turned into a series. Ken Stott seems to be the best representation of the Rebus I know. Rebus is for the underdog, and he will break rules, forget what his superiors ask and do what is right in his eyes,

Ahhhh, Rebus and his good friend, DS Siobhan Clarke, work well together. She is the only one who really understands him. However, as time does not stand still, Ian Rankin's new character DI Malcom Fox, heading The Ethics and Standards Division' makes his appearance,and he is shocked, shocked,,I tell you, to find Rebus back on the force. He dredges up all the old complaints, none of which went anywhere when Rebus was on the force. The cat and mouse game continues. I actually resented Fox in this novel, at first...

We get to meet Rebus's daughter as he travels to the north of Scotland on this case. He is trying to resurrect their relationship. We also see a great deal of Scotland, the north country and get to meet the people. This is a time when Scotland is attempting to exert it's independence, and we see the issues from all sides. This is a fascinating study of a man who was let out to pasture, trying to regain his foothold. Rebus has not changed much, his habits remain the same, but I do detect a little empathy in the man. He is trying to deal with the changes in the workplace and the computerization of his workplace.

Rebus is the man who loves the music, the whiskey, the man who pays little attention to the niceties of life. There are some tell tale signs that Rebus might be working with his unit again.. He is also privy to every bad duck in Scotland, and can often get them to help him in some cases.

Highly Recommended. prisrob 03-19-17",1489881600,,1773,4.446153846153846

8126027,4,B000FS9FGW,"I like the show.  I checked it out from the library before buying.  Than I began reading the books.  I think Ken Stott makes a better Rebus than John Hannah did in his REBUS collection.  Neither does a very good job of casting the secondary characters, and of course the stories aren't exactly like the books.  I know they can't be too faithful to the novels, but it still bugs me.  Like the Dalziel and Pascoe series, I wish they would not mess up a good book if they can't do it right - just write their own screen play based on the characters so you know ahead of time there will be a lot of changes.  Even so, It is a good rather gritty series and worth seeing.  But read the books = they are  better.",1406851200,,705,4.087591240875913
8126028,5,B000FS9FGW,"I have now read all of Ian Rankin's Rebus books.  They are complex in terms of multiple plots, but move right along with no excess verbiage like some authors.  They seem very realistic, though I am sure they exaggerate the crime scene in Edinburgh.  The city itself in a major character in the books.  Some find the language offensive, but I think it is realistic, unlike what you hear on US TV.  This UK TV series is based on Ian Rankin's books, but not verbatim.  Unlike the earlier series, the atmosphere is the same as in the books, including the swearing.  Ken Stott and the other actors are exactly as I pictured Rebus and the other characters from the books.  My only complaint is that the DVDs have CC instead of subtitles, and my BluRay player doesn't read them.  Sometimes the Scottish English is a little hard to follow.",1402617600,,831,4.523489932885906
8126029,1,B000FS9FGW,"I thought it was a pretty bad interpretation of the novels - the city of Edinburgh did not feature - in the books Edinburgh is more part of the action, the dialogue was indistinct and the actors mumbled. Ken Stott's ample figure did not reflect the hard smoking sparse eating character portrayed in the novels",1395619200,,309,4.636363636363637
8126030,5,B000FS9FGW,"The crimes are just as depraved and dangerous and disgusting but the solutions don't necessarily require gunfire by the police investigators as in our crime dramas in the U.S.  Often the worst violence is perpetrated by the offenders themselves against themselves, but mostly the offenders are just caught and society is brought back to a kind of equilibrium by a squad of professional human beings.  These officers of the law are just like you and me but with an awsome responsibility to the society we live in.  Ken Stott as Rebus brings Ian Rankin's characters to life showing the love they both have for their city and families and friends.  You just get to want them to succeed to make this world a better place.",1389398400,,717,4.712
8126031,5,B000FS9FGW,"Ian Rankin's books about Detective Inspector John Rebus' work on the ""seedy side"" of Edinburgh - the underbelly if you will - are riveting.  Unlike many filmed versions of books which never match the written versions, the series (4 box sets total) of Rebus are an equal match to Rankin's books.  You'll see modern Edinburgh as never before.  Highly recommended.  And a great transaction from the seller.",1371168000,,403,4.970149253731344
