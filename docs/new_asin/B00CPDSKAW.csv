8584454,5,B00CPDSKAW,"The RARESCOPE 10 MOVIES (5-disc) box set from BCI/Eclipse includes:

Kings of Fists and Dollars
A Sword Named Revenge
The Dream Sword
Chinese Godfather
Duel of Karate
Amazons and Supermen
Hero of the Time
Big Rascal
18 Shaolin Riders
Fast Fists

Several of these films were not released individually, so this is a nice box set for the price. Though similar to the Flicks With Kicks box set put out by Rarescope, these box sets do not share all the same titles. However, the Rarescope and Kung Fu Theater Present 20 Movies Collection contains all 10 of the films in this collection.",1416009600,,581,4.686274509803922
