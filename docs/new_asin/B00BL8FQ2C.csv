8570230,5,B00BL8FQ2C,"During the 1960s many action movies were made in Italy with stories about the Roman Empire and the Greek city-states. Some of the stories were base on true facts, others on mythology, and others were original. Always entertaining, featuring some well known stars and gorgeous ladies, with lots of actions and romance, they are now hard to find in any condition, and when you can get them, they are not restored at all, so don't expect the picture and the sound to be pristine! Duel of Titans is based on the legend of the foundation of Rome by brothers Romulus and Remus, at the very beginning of the Roman Republic that later became the mighty Roman Empire. This particular film gives you two super-star muscle men for the price of one, Steve Reeves and my good friend Gordon Scott (who portrayed Tarzan in some of the best movies ever made about the ERB's jungle man). You'll have a good time, and you may become interested in the fascinating history of the Roman Empire. Get it if you can, and have fun!",1394064000,7,1006,4.56353591160221
