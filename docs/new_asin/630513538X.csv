972499,5,630513538X,"I remember seeing this in the theatre in 1997 and being stunned by how good it is--films rarely depict life in such gritty real life fashion (no matter how uncomfortable it may make people).

Minh, the [...] Amerasian son of a black GI is comfortable with his sexual orientation, in contrast to the uptight, closeted middle class white men in the film. It's his skin color that causes him problems; his encounters with African Americans make him feel like an exotic alien. Meanwhile, he's rejected and quite cruelly by the Vietnamese community in Memphis which results in his act of violence against the one person he encounters who may have an honest interest in him.",1145664000,4,668,4.808695652173913
972500,1,630513538X,"If you like light entertaining movies this is not for you. If you like interesting characters this is not for you. If you like an interesting plot this is not for you. The creator of this rubbish even imagines he is an oscar winning cinematographer - and with his cruddy camera, film and scenery he clearly is not anywhere near to being that. Don't pay more than $3.",1142380800,,366,4.397058823529412

972502,1,630513538X,"A muddled and insulting film. Low budget doesn't have to have an influence on the script or how a film is directed. The problem with this film is certainly not its low production value. In a day and age where discussions are taking place in the top ranks of the US government about changing the constitution to officially discriminate against, gays, we certainly don't need people out of our own ranks creating pieces of entertainment, which show gays as purely dysfunctional human beings.
In The Delta, we have two very vague character studies: one of a 17 year old, upper middle-class kid who vacillates between seeming perfectly happy in his heterosexuality and going out to pick up guys. We never understand this character. There doesn't seem to be any conflict even though his situation screams out for it.  Shayne Gray is charming, but that doesn't help a script, which was doomed before it was filmed.  The other character is a bitter and confused Vietnamese/American/black man, who claims to search for love, but turns to a murderer, when the young man abandons him. We are left with his act of murder without ever understanding what drove him to it, or what really makes this person tick.  After 95 minutes it simply ends and you are none the wiser why it was even written.
Verdict: it puts gay film-making back 25 to 30 years.",1077753600,12,1336,4.75
972503,3,630513538X,"The film's twist on the Huckleberry Finn/American West motif is well-done and commendable.  Similarly, the burgeoning relationship between the two young men is initially well-dramatized.  However, Minh's character lacks development, and potential dramatic use of his disenfranchisemnt (half-black, half-Vietnamese, gay, poor) is unexplored.  Minh's character arc lands him the only place he could end up: risking what little he has to avenge his abandonment.  Yet we are left wondering the complete reasoning behind his decision, and, in fact, we do not know Minh's name until the movie is almost over.  Without due psychological exploration of Minh, the movie's pace is jerky and the film left being somewhat cryptic, which would be to the film's credit if it seemed intentional.",1042329600,11,780,5.5210084033613445
972504,3,630513538X,"It isn't clear what motivates our boy.  If it is lust, it is a lazy river lust.  He cruises a gay pick-up spot but rejects the advances of an adult, but only after following him to a motel room.  He then cruises a teen haunt and pals with a mixed race guy who harbors his own demons.  They steal his family's boat and have an adventure, but never truly connect.  In the end there is a murder and a shower scene in the nude, but they only add to the confusing, surreal tale that is The Delta.  Haunting, but in a lazy, Delta sort of way.",987120000,26,536,4.009433962264151
972505,4,630513538X,"A compelling character study -- revolving around the confused relationship between a 17-year-old Memphis student and a slightly older Vietnamese immigrant -- that makes for a fascinating tale of sexual, social and racial  differences and injustices. Lincoln (Grey) is a sensously handsome youth  who, though having a girlfriend, cruises the city's parks after dark for  clandestine sexual encounters with other men. There, and later in a peep  show store, he meets Minh, a talkative but very troubled young man and the  son of a black American GI father whom he has never met, and a Vietnamese  woman. Minh takes a liking to the shy Lincoln and they soon set up a  strange, quasi-sexual friendship that quickly results in a boat ride deep  down the Mississippi Delta in a modern quasi-Tom and Huck  adventure.
These two opposites -- Lincoln, the privileged white teen, and  Minh, the poor foreigner -- for a bond that inevitably leads to trouble.  The film suffers from poor sound, but for adventurous filmgoers, it should  not be a disappointment.",964742400,10,1048,5.02906976744186

7883865,1,630513538X,"There was absolutely  no reason to make this film.  The main character was your standard repressed southern gay  (yawn)  with no distinguishing personality.  He meets a Vietnamese immigrant who you  think might be interesting, but they  go on a boring trip  with no purpose and part strangely  for no apparent reason.  the immigrant does nothing but tell this guy about strong feelings he has for him -  even though he  knows nothing about  him.  There's  not a genuine  emotion conveyed  in the entire film.

SPOILER: Then the immigrant kills some poor schmo for no apparent reason.  What a POS film.  A 'classic?""  no way.",1483142400,3,624,4.8076923076923075

7883869,5,630513538X,Thang Chan played rather a good part & Shayne Gray playing the cute shy guy lovely can see why it had high rave reviews in 2001,1365206400,,127,3.923076923076923
7883870,1,630513538X,Take all the negative reviews left by everyone and believe them.  This movie is so bad...it's worst than bad.  I would not even give it the star I gave it...but had to rate it somehow...which is why it got the one star.  The actors are boring...the plot ( what plot ??? ) is nonexistent...everything about this movie sucks!  Don't waste your money on this one...I got rid of my copy...would never watch this kind of inept film again.  It does not depict being gay in a positive way...rather it shows the ugly side of it...very ugly side.,1360972800,,537,4.494845360824742
7883871,2,630513538X,"The best thing about this movie is Shayne Gray who should have a successful career ahead of him.

The worst thing about this movie is that it is almost impossible to understand what Thang Chan is saying.  Chan plays John or Minh Nguyen, a half Vietnamese half African American.

This movie really needs English subtitles so that the viewer can know what Chan is saying as well as some of the other actors whose voices are drowned out.

One synopsis said that Shayne Gray who plays Lincoln Bloom is a handsome student ""from a wealthy Jewish family.""  I saw nothing in the movie that indicated that Lincoln was Jewish or from a wealthy family.  He drove a run down older car.  His father's house is small and apparently from the 1960s.

I found the ending quite disturbing.  It came from nowhere.

Except for watching Shayne Gray, I really do not recommend this movie.",1327795200,,866,4.601307189542483
7883872,1,630513538X,"? This film left me with a huuuge question mark.
WHAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF CREATING IT?
The plot doesn't exist (well, for some maybe). We have some characters, but we really don't have a chance to know them. To learn something about them.
Yet again a movie, where all gays pictured, aren't likable. One is a closet case, straight? bi? I haven't the foggiest.
The second becomes a killer, after being rejected...
It's one of the films that won't do good to gay community.

Above all of that, the quality of sound and picture is really poor. Low budget is low budget, but it doesn't mean that you don't allow viewers to hear dialogues in your film!",1309305600,,644,4.4576271186440675
