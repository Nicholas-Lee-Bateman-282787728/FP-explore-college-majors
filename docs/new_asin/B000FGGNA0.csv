2565294,5,B000FGGNA0,"I enjoyed this quite a lot.  The cast is uniformly excellent: in particular, Charlotte Rampling, who is not in the film all that much, makes a strong impression and the lead Laurent Lucas does a great job as a man trying to wade through a series of bizarre incidents that wind up blasting a huge hole in the veneer of pleasant bourgeois success that is his life and relationship with Charlotte Gainsbourg.  Lucas is not always the easiest actor to connect with but that reserved and distant quality serves this particular film very well.  The script has some nice twists and turns and gets at some fundamental questions about how, despite one's best efforts to control one's life and environment through ritual and rules and containment, things are by nature precariously balanced and always potentially in jeopardy of collapse.  It's also pretty funny and should appeal to people with an appropriately dark sense of humor.

Several reviewers have commented that the second half of the film disappointed them; I did not find such a fall off myself and thought the narrative went in the right direction and resolved itself quite satisfyingly.  If you have a fondness for that strange feeling of unease that can come over you in those sorts of thrillers where a dreamlike quality of unpredictability directs the proceedings, you should try this one out.  It's well conceived, smartly executed, well directed, and well acted.",1169337600,3,1422,4.974683544303797
2565295,4,B000FGGNA0,"Strange, ironic, compelling, subversive and disturbing.

Visual and verbal metaphors abound, both intended and found.

Great looking and wonderfully unsettling.

What's really going on here as seemingly perfect lives start
to come apart soon after a lemming is found clogging a kitchen sink?

See it without knowing anything more and you're in for a
noirish French cocktail with a twist of Lynch and Hitchcock.",1167782400,,410,5.359375
2565296,4,B000FGGNA0,"Nightmares have never been so decidedly well scripted as in LEMMING, another bizarre creation by French director Dominik Moll ('Harry, un ami qui vous veut du bien', 'Intimit', 'Le Gyncologue et sa secrtaire') and writer Gilles Marchand ('Feux rouges', 'Qui a tu Bambi?', 'Bon voyage', 'Les mes clines', 'Joyeux Nol').  As played by a superlative quartet of actors - Charlotte Rampling, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Laurent Lucas, and Andr Dussollier - the film is no easy path to follow but one that in retrospect seems to fit together like a Chinese puzzle.

The story involves the 'model couple' who invite the rogue older couple to dinner where a belated arrival heralds the singly strange behavior of the boss' wife.  When the outrageously 'eccentric' wife subsequently is thwarted in a seduction of the model husband and the model husband fails to immediately communicate this embarrassing encounter to his young wife, the nightmare begins: the tale embraces suicide, alienation, adultery, philandering, murder, abandonment, a car crash - all seemingly related in a linear sense.  But as it turns out, in the end of the film the events appear to be the fodder of a nightmare that could only have been induced by a simple initial guilt of lack of communication.

The 'lemming' of the title refers not only to a Scandinavian rodent that is found in the plumbing of the young couple's kitchen, but it also is part of the nightmare of the concept that lemmings 'commit suicide' in their migration from their overpopulated Scandinavia to the oceans of death beyond their home.  In retrospect each piece of the bizarre story is laid very carefully in the opening of the film, at times a bit occult but the pieces are there.  Rampling and Gainsbourg are their usual beautiful and gifted selves in very tough roles, and the entire cast is on target, succeeding in catching us off guard at every turn.  Perhaps this is not a 'great movie', but it certainly is a fine exercise for the mind and gives further evidence that Dominik Moll is a formidable artist.

2565297,3,B000FGGNA0,"A mysterious undercurrent runs through ""Lemming"" and carries you along like a branch thrown into a river.  The film's overall creepiness and twisted sexuality calls to mind nothing else but David Lynch, but at least ""Lemming"" stays in the realm of the mostly-comprehensible, and even attempts to explain the Lemming at the end, perhaps spoiling the effect.  It was only after a nights sleep that all of the puzzle fell into place, rendering the movie quite a thinker.  Realistically, ""Lemming"" warrants 3.5 stars, but that option is not available.",1156118400,,547,5.123595505617978
8122404,1,B000FGGNA0,"Only got to watch the first 45 minutes of this film because the DVD screen-froze and would not play - obviously damaged or manufactured with a fatal flaw.  But, since I was 7 days past the return time limit, I cannot return and/or exchange it.  No matter because it is horribly written and limp but pretentious acting.",1455062400,,318,4.56140350877193

8122406,4,B000FGGNA0,This film explores the dark side of marriages and lets you know it is being told by an unreliable narrator.  Certain scenes are obviously symbolic dreams.  Others may be based on crucial conversations that the narrator (and the audience) are not privy to.  What we know for sure is that characters make bad decisions to distract themselves from intolerably unpleasant feelings about what just happened to them.,1378684800,,410,5.08955223880597
8122407,2,B000FGGNA0,"The acting is good, and it's creepy enough to hold your interest, but the ending
was a letdown, I'd say - movies, especially thrillers, don't have to be realistic and logical, but the ending just seemed too unrealistic to me, and as somebody else pointed out, tacking on Mama Cass singing
""Dream a Little Dream of Me"" as the credits roll didn't help.  Another one I'm happy that I saw on TV.  Worth seeing once, I'd say,
and it's now erased.  The test of a good film is: would you recommend it to a friend?  Even if I had a friend who liked thrillers, I'd say, ""You can skip this one.""",1350345600,,585,4.243243243243243
8122408,3,B000FGGNA0,"A suicidal lemming shows up in a drainpipe before the boss's wacky wife commits suicide in the nice young couple's apartment. Things go very wrong from there. It's funny at times and a little creepy, too. The meaning is somewhat lost, but you'll enjoy the classic French meaningful looks with minimal dialogue, if you like French cinema. I had no idea Charlotte Rampling spoke French so well. She was hot back in her Woody Allen days. Too long by 30 mins, but still worth watching.",1228953600,,481,4.670588235294118
8122409,3,B000FGGNA0,"You know that there is going to be trouble when Charlotte Rampling as Alice, wife of Andre (Richard Pollock) walks...no dangerously slides into the home of Alain Getty (Laurent Lucas) and his wife Bndicte (Charlotte Gainsbourg): dark sunglasses perched on her patrician nose, hands in her pocket, mouth in a snarl and nose literally up in the air. Though she doesn't say it, you know she is thinking: ""So this is how the other half lives. Huh?""
Andre is Alain's boss so both he and Bndicte are on their best behavior but Alice doesn't adhere to the niceties of social behavior as she (Charlotte Rampling), whose sparing but provocative venting cuts the evening short as before long she hurls a glass of red wine into Andre's face: so much for a quiet, serene dinner between work friends.
That night, Alain extracts from his sink pipe a lemming (to which the title refers and which is indigenous to Scandinavia); the next day, Alice tries to seduce Alain at work, if ""seduction"" is even the correct word here as Alice blankly asks scared to his core Alain, ""Do you want to sleep with me,"" by which point the weirdness train has officially left the station.
Director Dominik Moll, who also directed the terrific thriller, ""With a Friend like Harry"" knows his way around this material and he has cast his film perfectly: Laurent Lucas (playing a role here very similar to one he played in ""Harry""...a man perplexed about the unusual circumstances with which he is confronted), with his wide expressive eyes and face gives us layers of truth as his performance unfurls. His Alain is smart, kind and loving and he is the one around which all the action revolves.
Unfortunately, Charlotte Rampling leaves the film early and her departure leaves a gaping hole in the film.
Moll is dealing with a number of things here: sexual desire, mostly misdirected, voyeurism, sexual fantasy yet, unlike as in ""Harry,"" which had a delectably nerve-jangling quality, whenever he searches similar veins in this scenario he succumbs to a kind of pride of perversion: showing us but not revealing anything knew about his themes.",1203724800,3,2105,4.85
8122410,4,B000FGGNA0,"This DVD from Strand Releasing comes with the English subtitles always present.  If you are able or want to try to follow the original French without the subtitles, they are ever-present and difficult to ignore.  Except for that, the DVD is well produced, and the format is wide screen.",1195171200,,286,4.816326530612245
8122411,4,B000FGGNA0,"Just as a lemming inexplicably wedges itself into a young French couple's plumbing system - so a woman's hatred and bitterness insinuates itself into this couple's lives, into their psyches.

I wouldn't say this movie goes so far as to have a David Lynch quality, as the DVD jacket touts. The unfolding here is much more realistic, less surrealistic than Lynch. But there is a preternatural element at work in the dynamics between the main characters.

This is an adult movie - adult in the sense that the director allows time and space and the unsaid to create the tension. It's not just one onslaught of weirdness after another, like you find in a lot of would-be thrillers. The suspense is this movie is intrinsic.

Charlotte Rampling is fascinating, as ever. She and all the actors have that sterling ability to concentrate. It's this quality that raises acting into a true art.

""Lemming"" isn't dubbed. You will have to read English subtitles if you don't speak French. And the subtitles are printed so large that they spilled off the edges of my TV screen on occasion. But since the dialogue here is so succinct and paced, you won't find the mood being broken by having to read subtitles.

Subtitles and all, this movie is absorbing - mesmerizing.",1174262400,3,1253,4.755760368663594
8122412,4,B000FGGNA0,"If there is an influence in this attractive film by Dominik Moll it's Edgar Allan Poe and Edward Albee, rather than Alfred Hitchcock. Revealing more about the Poe influence would spoil the film, but it will be clear to anybody when they finish watching.

All in all, this is a strong effort by Dominik Moll, who directed the similarly intriguing ""With a Friend Like Harry"".

That was a superior, probably near great film. Lemming is a very good one, and anyone entering it should be warned that this is not a conventional thriller, but rather something of a metaphysical puzzle, with very malignant undertones and ominous happenings (like the disturbing appearance of the creature which gives the film its name).

In less able hands, the film could border on the cliched and the pretentious, but Moll knows how to weave a compelling story with appropiately eerie touches. At every step of the way, a most disturbing surprise arises, and there is no peace for the young middle class couple (Laurent Lucas and Charlotte Gainsbourgh) unexpectedly assaulted by the chaotic life of a much older and sinister couple, played by Andre Dussolier and Charlotte Rampling.

The film is greatly helped by the presence of the great Rampling, in full bitch goddess mode. Although her appearance is relatively brief, she is the ravaged, brutal, mysterious heart of this film.",1170460800,5,1359,4.973568281938326
8122413,4,B000FGGNA0,"Lemming is one of those films that really gets under your skin.. It is so strange and desturbing as it borders on art-film and suspense thriller.. The plot does call to mind David Lynch (lost highway in particular),but the flavor is distinctively french.. The first part of the movie is truly well done - as we are thouroughly amused by the very subtle discoveries of the lemming and the amazing character - pollock's wife (who has such chilling eyes behind those glasses).. Though the lemming does have some less than perfect moments - I just can't stop thinking about its characters..",1170201600,,586,4.811881188118812
