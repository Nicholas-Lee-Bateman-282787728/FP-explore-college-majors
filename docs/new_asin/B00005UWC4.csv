8472839,3,B00005UWC4,"After seeing toxic avenger part 2, I hoped that part 3 would be little gorier and better....Well, it was a little gorier. Some reviews say this movie sucked, I don't think it sucked that bad. The beginning was great though, At the Tromaville video store five thugs come in to kill the innocent people in there. The store was owned by Jewish people who made me laugh in the beggining. Anyway, I will tell you the gore in this movie.. A guy's hand gets torn off after being shoved into a VCR, another guy's intestines a pulled out while toxie skips rope with it, another thug is strangled by the intestine, another thug gets his faced erased while getting strung up from a VHS tape, Satan gets his skin pulled off and his head ripped off and that's about it for this movie. Thereason I gave it three stars is because the one part where toxie melts made me sad and the beginning fight part, the rest of the movie just lagged on as toxie works for Apocalypse co. Claier and Toxie get in an argument which upset me. It's not the greatest to show your friends for the first time if they have never seen the first toxic avenger. Pick it up at a garage sale uncut or regular because I didn't see much reinserted gore.",1148256000,,1209,4.330396475770925
