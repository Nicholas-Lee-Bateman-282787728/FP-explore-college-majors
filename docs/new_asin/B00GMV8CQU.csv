6087679,5,B00GMV8CQU,"""The Armstrong Lie"" (2013 release; 122 min.), originally intended to document the comeback of Lance Armstrong in 2009 after a 4 year absence from the sport, instead is now the chronicle of the astonishing fall from grace by Armstrong, leading to his lifetime ban and stripping of his 7 Tour de France victories. As the documentary opens, Lance is talking to director Alex Gibney just hours after Lance has confessed the Big Lie on the Oprah Winfrey show on January 14, 2013. The documentary then goes into depth as to how Armstrong was able to get away with the Big Lie for so many years, while also looking back at some of his major accomplishments, most notably his survival of almost fatal testicular cancer that had spread to his lungs and brains in 1996, and his subsequent return to professional biking and winning the Tour de France an unprecedented 7 consecutive times. The documentary also gives insights as to why (and how) Armstrong came back in 2009, and doing an extended one-on-one interview with Armstrong in June of '13 to confront him in depth with all the facts and allegations.

Several comments: first and foremost, more than one person interviewed made this comment: ""the doping was bad, but the abuse of power was worse"", and ""it's not about the doping, it's about the power"". Indeed, by now it is well documented that in the 1990s, all of professional biking was immersed by doping, EPO in particular, very similar in the way baseball was immersed by steroids at that time. ""A generation of riders used EPO"", comments someone. Most of them were caught, but not Armstrong. How? By massive intimidation (some say ""bullying"") and very advanced doping techniques, as it turns out. It wasn't until after his comeback in 2009 that many finally dared to speak out, most notably former teammates (and disgraced dopers themselves) Floyd Landis and Frankie Andreu. It is the latter and his wife Betsy who are most damaging to Armstrong. How? Just watch! Yet despite all that, we also see Armstrong doing good, with his never-ending battle against cancer through his Livestrong Foundation, raising hundreds of millions of dollars and giving hope to even more people. Which makes all of this even more of a Greek tragedy.

As an aside, the documentary contains great ""behind the scenes"" footage of the 2009 Tour de France comeback. Watch team manager Johan Bruyneel go ballistic when Alberto Contador goes attacking from a group containing his team mate Armstrong. Priceless. I don't know how well the documentary will play for audiences not particularly interested in professional biking. Having grown up in Belgium, I am a lifelong fan of the sport, and I found this documentary riveting and the 2 hours just flew by. This movie played briefly last month at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati and I couldn't wait to see it. The screening I saw this at was not particularly well attended (only a handful of people). Doesn't matter. This is a must-see documentary, even if you don't care for professional biking or the Tour de France, as it is a fantastic study of the fall from grace of someone who used to be an icon in today's society. ""The Armstrong Lie"" is HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1388707200,59,3211,4.857664233576642

I felt that his talents and determination led to supreme hubris - and few of us should judge (even though we do).  Everyone's character and faade would be tested under this type of limelight - and if not that way, then another way.  Granted, there are many people who transcend their darker side and are true heroes.  I'm compelled to give Lance kudos for finally telling the truth.  His long history of strident, forceful, denials must have made it almost impossible to confess.  It's never to late to do what is right.  Question his motives, but regardless he subjected himself to the consequences of his actions.  And make no mistake he's paid a VERY high price - in terms of money, losing his medals, banned from the sport he truly loves, and finally crushing criticism and condemnation which few people could endure.

6087717,5,B00GMV8CQU,"I think this documentary shows just how ruthless Lance Armstrong really is. I truly believe he is a Socio path  As a cancer survivor, I can say that while I was going through my cancer treatments, a drug rep gave me Lance's book to read. I believe it was called ""It's Not All About the Bike""  He admired Lance and thought I would too. I read the book but came away thinking what an arrogant individual this man was. I had a conversation with a man who actually met Armstrong in Aspen. They attended the same party. He pretty much told me the same thing. He was arrogant and wouldn't give most people the time of day. Even now, today, he says he is sorry for all the lives he tried so hard to destroy but when I heard he tried to get his girlfriend to take the blame for the car accident he was in while in Aspen, I thought to myself ""He will never change. I just don't think he is capable of truly having feelings and compassion for anyone. He has no conscience. I also watched another documentary on him called ""Stop At Nothing"" which was even better a showing his true self than this documentary. I have always felt it wasn't that he doped. Most of the riders were doping. It was how he treated people and the lengths he would go to destroy their lives that made me dislike him so much.",1466121600,7,1288,4.2105263157894735

6087732,3,B00GMV8CQU,"I loved Alex Gibney's other documentaries and it pains me to write a negative review; however, this documentary just did not rise to the occasion. So much was missing, like what (if any involvement) did Livestrong have with the ongoing cover-up.  No mention of ""we tried to interview Livestrong"" or ""we contacted Livestrong but were told"" nada!  I remember one single comment in the documentary from someone about Livestrong ""being part of the cover-up"" but nothing to confirm or deny or to explore that further.

Way too much time of the film was spent on the 2009 footage of Armstrong whining about everything.  The time spent on that often repetitious footage should have been used to answer other questions, such as: What impact does doping have on the body and mind?

Was Armstrong doping before he was diagnosed with cancer, and if so, could the doping have impacted that cancer (good or bad)?

What is this lawsuit with fellow-doper Floyd Landis and the government against Armstrong all about?

Why wasn't Landis asked ""You lied about not doping for years and then came out of the closet.  Was this solely so you could help force Armstrong out of the closet?""  There is a lot in common between Landis and Armstrong and this documentary barely touched on that dynamic!

Armstrong (all by himself) comes across as a total schmuck in the documentary (except the scenes where he is with young cancer patients).  But there should have been more emphasis on how many people and fans and cancer patients and donors he let down.  We don't get that in this documentary and it is a huge void.

Instead of showing clip after clip of the races (which made for excellent cinematography), we should have  seen interviews with Livestrong or former Livestrong recipients and/or board members and/or employees; even ONE would have been better than NONE!

We should have seen more details about the lives of fellow racers and their families that Armstrong likely helped to destroy.  Viewers get a flavor of what happened from some of the interviews, but it is so edited down that viewers don't really get an accurate idea of how huge the negative impact of Armstrong's lie had on those victims.

We don't hear from the fans either.  People like me who don't follow sports, let alone bike racing, looked up to Armstrong because of his foundation and his battle with cancer.  I believed in him when he was lying his ass off and defended him on social media at the time, even bought the yellow bracelets in bulk.  Interviews with fans would have been a nice addition to this documentary.

This film could have been so much better, especially considering the phenomenal talents of Gibney!",1452729600,,2673,4.805251641137856

6087765,4,B00GMV8CQU,"This was fascinating to me for a couple of reasons. First, the filmmaker clearly started to make one kind of movie (about the comeback of 2009) then had to change directions as the evidence of cheating was gushing out in a tsunami over the next few years. I find that very intriguing, from an editorial standpoint. The filmmaker expresses how he felt being lied to directly to his face for the initial period of filming. I think he (the filmmaker) responded to this turn of events pretty well, considering the planning that goes into making a film of this scale. He makes very good use of the pre-revelation footage, and you can see how effortlessly the lies come out of everyone. It's disgusting, but fascinating, Like a train wreck.

Secondly, I was fascinated by how unremorseful the cyclists of the Postal Team are. Post-confession, they gleefully recount tales of the doping, sounding quite pleased with themselves. They still see themselves as rebels or cowboys, not privileged well-connected cheaters with zero moral fiber. I know that Tyler Hamilton and Floyd Landis have both earned heaps of well deserved public scorn, but at least they seem to have a modicum of shame. Whereas Hincapie and others are positively cheerful. The cheaters, amazingly, even seem to float the idea that they would have won without the cheating. Too bad - you can't have it both ways! If you were that good, why did you have to dope? That's the whole problem with cheating. We'll never know. It's interesting to navigate this terrain with a tween who is into cycling.",1435536000,2,1554,4.842105263157895

6087781,1,B00GMV8CQU,"The contributors who seem to comprise a pack of grudge carriers (including admitted dope takers) who wouldn't last the first few minutes in a court of law - if it ever got that far.

I found myself casting my mind back to a sunny and sweltering hot August afternoon in Carpentras in the heart of Tour country in Provence, at the foot of the renowned Mount Ventoux, the killer climb, in 2008 or thereabouts. I was staring into the street window of a photographic nostalgia/memorabilia shop wherein many photos of famous cyclists were displayed, some signed, some modern, or so, technicolour, and up-to-date, some vintage and black and white. Not one photo of Lance Armstrong - not a mention, as if he did not even exist.

I thought then - as I do now of this unrelieved pile of acrimony and accusation - a sense I was witnessing Schadenfreude (now) and pure jealousy (then) - certainly aberrant, immoderate reactions to a man and his bike.

You can put that down to a certain type of occasional French patriotism taken to the extreme, but this film in question here is pure hatred. What is laughable is that every so often, to leaven the pervading bile and venom, the producer attempts to weave in a theme of betrayal while at the same time explaining continuously along the way Armstrong was in fact operating in a bent field. They were nearly all at it - INCLUDING THE PO-FACED BROADCASTERS, COMMENTATORS AND TEAM MACHINERY AND CORPORATE SPONSERSHIP WHICH CREATED THE CLIMATE OF MEGA MONEY, INHUMAN COMPETITION TO WIN AT ALL COSTS AND ADVERTISING AND BRANDING. And they did that to keep their bums on the seats that were paying their wages so they kept their mouths shut very firmly about something they were only too willing to gab about later to absolve themselves.

Of course, allowing at the editor's whim, a pop up appearance by Lance every few minutes, does not guarantee balance. There is no balance here, it is entirely one sided.

But as Lance says, the last word has not been written. I certainly would not take this film with more than a very large pinch salt I usually add to my meals, though I am constantly told not to, and it certainly would not form any part of my own personal assessment of Lance Armstrong and what he brought to a somewhat moribund unglamorous sport.

A much more interesting and helpful DVD would have been ""Cycling and Sport: The Lie"" where Lance and his errors, as the ultimate end product of a much wider deceit, and how it did sting, could be explained and discussed IN CONTEXT.",1425081600,2,2519,4.63677130044843
6087782,4,B00GMV8CQU,"This riveting documentary follows Lance Armstrong's rise to Icon and tracks his stunning fall from that pedestal. Much of the material here is now sadly familiar, but what makes this film so fascinating is we see what a vengeful bully Mr. Armstrong becomes as his cheating threatens to be exposed. He destroys those who question him, intimidates those who don't like him, and worst of all, hides behind his cancer diagnosis and recovery and uses that to take ""Victimology"" to a whole new level. Curiously, there are no comments from his ex-wife Kristin or former fiance Sheryl Crow, which is surprising given the complexity of his deception. Both women had to see or hear something that was going on.

In our justice system there is a concept called statutes of limitation.  After a certain amount of time, you have to leave people alone.  If they cannot bust someone within a year, then they need to forget it.  We don't need a bunch of vindictive losers running around trashing all our memories because they uncovered some sordid truth behind the whole thing.  If we are going to start stripping titles from any athlete or team that used PHDs then there won't be any titles left.  Same with everything else.  Who wants to know that our favorite movie stars were really huge jerks on the set?  It's entertainment.  This is entertainment.  Lance entertained us.  The thing is to catch cheaters when they are cheating and if you can't do that, move on.  What this movie really exposes is the jealously that surrounds someone that is good looking, cool and successful.  Betsy Abreu is so holier than thou it is almost nauseating.  No wonder Lance ""hated"" her.  If it weren't for Lance, nobody would have ever heard of her and her second-rate-cycler husband.  Greg Lemond is pathetic.  All the whiners in this movie are ugly and vindictive.  Tyler Hamilton is an exception, as he told it like it is and is not sitting around crying about how he was victimized by Lance.  Tygart from the USADA is last guy to try to get himself famous by finishing off Lance.  I guess he showed him!  Please.  What did they accomplish by doing that?  Are people going to be more clean because of that?  Of course not.  If you want people to be clean, you need to come up with tests that bust them in the act.

6087826,4,B00GMV8CQU,"Pretty good and exhaustive documentary about Armstrong's perfect lie scandal and the corrupt system around him. My sister and brother-in-law happen to be amateur judges in this sport and watching this made me realize I know next to nothing about it or its subculture. And a subculture it is: the community, back deals, feuds and friendships, endorsements and the passion make up a world that most Americans know nothing about - ironic, since Armstrong is the most famous, and infamous, cyclist who has ever lived.

This project actually started out as a comeback doc for Armstrong, until the evidence against Armstrong became so clear that neither director Alex Gibney nor anyone else who wanted to believe it could fool themselves any longer. It does a marvelous job explaining how this ruse could be carried out for so long - because everyone who knew about it refused to say anything until either put under oath or through plain jealousy for falling out of favor with the industry. The irony is almost too much, in spite of this being such an open secret and there being so many characters making too much money out of this farce, the lie could have probably survived for ever had Armstrong not made the 2009 comeback. The pesky allegations would eventually have disappeared as Armstrong's story became legend, but he couldn't resist the lure of coming back.

As the rest of characters take center stage and say their peace we realize how petty, vain, vindictive many of them are (this through their own voice) and Armstrong was just the most visible actor. The Andreus, especially the wife, a particularly odious and unpleasant character, fare even worse than Armstrong. I was left wondering if the doc had done a good job at explaining their anger toward Armstrong or if it indeed had, and we were just seeing pettiness at its worst.

TAL is a great jambalaya of human drama, too many twists and turns no one but diehard fans would care about, but interestingly, it is about deeper things too. Initially, I got caught in the drama of little details and facts, and then remembered it is just about a sport. The clich follow-up to that would be ""it's not like this is about curing cancer or anything"" but in an odd and positive way, it was! People became interested in the story because Armstrong's survivor tale. He became the cancer afflicted hero and the cancer research ambassador. This combined with his preacher-like certainty when denying EVERY doping allegation for OVER a DECADE, while NONE of the testing showed any abnormality (now we know the UCI cover-up). This wasn't just the most profitable lie in sports history, it was also the best lie too. No one wanted to kill that golden goose, well, no one who was still benefitting from it.

Director Alex Gibney is honest about finding himself falling for the myth, we all did. I always thought Armstrong was an arrogant ass but I rooted for him for beating a disease that has hit people so dear to me and disproving vicious critics (some of them really low-lives). At the end, the picture of Armstrong is not simpler but more complex; not only is he an arrogant ass, he's a narcissist too in love with his image and self-importance who found a thousand justifications to believe his own profitable lie. Yes, he raised hundreds of millions in aid to cancer patients and families, THAT, you can quantify. That, however, is a weak excuse for cheating your way to the top and destroying livelihoods and reputations by justifying staying there because you've also done some good.

Like many people I saw Lance Armstrong as an almost superman who had it all: meaning, world fame, millions of dollars, credibility, a survivor tale, a gorgeous rock star girlfriend, a jet set lifestyle and uncanny self-confidence and certainty. And as I watched him crumble in the interviews and ridiculously trying to salvage any justification, I actually liked him more. He was more relatable and real than the BS superhero he was so intent in being seen as. I realized how weak his sense of self was. I recognized the drama; like me and many others Armstrong was a boy who grew up without a father, and had to figure out on his own, while still a child, how to be a strong man for a single mother. So he became strong and overconfident and he excelled. Then he got sick, but survived, he trained harder and cheated and put winning above everything. And then, the guy who loved to win at all cost and destroyed livelihoods along the way, lost. Big time.",1417651200,2,4494,4.734355044699872

Here is a guy that was beloved by the whole country and he was cheating.  And denying it the whole way.  His still extremely impressive story of surviving cancer and getting back where he could compete is still highly compromised by cheating.  And the fact he made millions of dollars cheating kind of bums me out too.  It makes me suspect anyone that I might have thought was a hero in the past, especially in sports.  And the whole idea can people who play sports even be heroes anyway?  I think the whole incident, actually series of incidents over years is a black eye on our country much less cycling.  And he would have got away with it too if it weren't for those meddling kids.  Well, if it weren't for the fact he was so egotistical he thought he could come back in 2009 and win.

The sport destroyed itself, Lance Armstrong was just a major player and made the lie so big it could not be contained. Corruption ran from the head of the cycling organization right down to the people who filled water bottles and got towels for the racers. They all knew. Many of the people calling for Armstrong's head were themselves either cheaters or the spouse of a cheater who had been caught and punished. Only after being caught did these people speak out again Armstrong and they seemed more determined to get Lance for his ruthless attach against his accusers than they seemed to be concerned with trying to clean up the sport in general. As I watched this movie it seemed as though all of them were inside some little bubble of self deception that none of them seemed to recognized.

6087899,4,B00GMV8CQU,"THE ARMSTRONG LIE is a fascinating documentary.  Shot over a period of four years, it purports to investigate the oft-repeated claim that cyclist Lance Armstrong was a cheat, and that every single one of his Tour de France wins were achieved by taking drugs.  Alex Gibney's narrative begins as a defense of Armstrong's behavior, but as different elements of the truth emerge, so the filmmaker has to keep readjusting his position.  Gibney is obviously a fan of Armstrong (as many people still are), but as the seamy details of what the cyclist did in order to win his races gradually emerge, so the filmmaker gradually understands how wrong-headed he has been give his unquestioning support.  Armstrong emerges as a thoroughly unsavory character, pathologically unwilling to acknowledge the truth about himself, and always looking to manipulate the media so that he emerges in a positive light.  Even his so-called 'confessional' interview with Oprah looks like a deliberate attempt to rescue his reputation.  As the narrative unfolds, so Gibney gradually comes to understand the truth about his subject, and realizes to his cost that much of the film has unwittingly helped to obfuscate that truth, portraying Armstrong instead as a man more sinned against than sinning.  It is only right at the end that Gibney admits the truth of Armstrong's motives, and how Armstrong himself has deliberately duped the filmmaker.  As a result THE ARMSTRONG LIE is a film that is more about media manipulation than anything else, revealing just how persuasive - and dangerous - a person Armstrong actually is.

Love him or hate him (strong words), the story is fascinating.

I really like how Tyler Hamilton lays it out in his book, The Secret Race.  Tyler makes it clear how one gets caught up in this mess and presents it in such a way that you might understand how it would be difficult not to be drawn in.

The Armstrong Lie shows the face that was being presented during the time that the scandal was in full swing.  He ruined lives and was mean -- sometimes vicious.  But powerful and exciting as well.  He did a lot to raise money and awareness for cancer.  But now, must live with a shadow of shame.

6087903,4,B00GMV8CQU,"Well, I finally broke down and watched The Armstrong Lie.  Id been waiting for an opportunity to watch the documentary about the unparalleled collapse of probably the single sporting hero I admired above all others.  But instead of watching the film surrounded by friends, I just plugged it into the old DVD player after the kids had gone to bed and worked my way through it alone.  The DVD copy itself was the only one on the shelf, and my thoughts are that this is simply a story that people really don't want to acknowledge.  Sure there is plenty of debate and anger going on out there regarding Lance Armstrong...but there are so many contradictions on every level that most people seem to want to dig no further than their first superficial emotional reaction.

My superficial emotional reaction?  Sadness.

The film starts out with some highlights from Lances wins, and man...theres a hearty hollow echo of nostalgia for each and every one because I remember when they happened live and I remember how I thrilled to watch them then.  Theres the moment when Lance dropped Pantani on LAlpe dHuez, and the moment when the spectator got too close and slammed Lance to the ground when his handlebars caught her handbag strap, and the moment when Joseba Beloki crashed in front of Armstrong leaving Armstrong with no other choice than to go offroad down the side of a mountain.  It was strange watching those moments again in the context of seeing Lance as a cheat.

Then they showed some scenes of Lance with his head shaved struggling to push out a couple miles on his bike, and I couldn't help but remember what a blow it was when we learned he had cancer.

But lets be clear, this isn't a pro Armstrong film.  Its called The Armstrong Lie and the fundamental theme of the movie is how Armstrong cheated.  The driving force of the film as it was originally conceived was to document Armstrongs return to racing in the 2009 Tour de France.  To this day, Armstrong insists that he did that race clean, although the film documents how a spike in his red blood cell count has been taken as an indication of an illegal blood transfusion (Armstrongs explanation is that the blood sample in question was taken immediately after the Ventoux stage when he was dehydrated and it wasnt...blah, blah, blahsorry, but you cant trust anything he says).

In terms of the doping, lying, bullying, this film doesnt show you anything new.  However, there is a reason to watch it, and that reason is the footage that was shot of Armstrong during non-racing moments in the 2009 tour.  Weve all seen Armstrong charging to the finish in pursuit of a stage victory, but weve never seen him in the recuperation moments after stages that have gone well orin the case of the 2009 tourpoorly.  The truth is that Armstrong has such a well-polished public persona, that its rare that you get a glimpse of the actual man.  Hes always on, always demonstrating a refined image that is very much under his control.  I think one of the things about Armstrong that made him easy to portray as a villain is that we don't know who he is.  What were allowed to see is always coldly calculated.  That was especially apparent during the infamous Oprah interview when he seemed to be able to work up some tears or drop his boyish smile on cue.  But in The Armstrong Lie there are moments filmed in hotels between stages where you see a different, and I think, more honest side of the man.

Armstrong reflects on the 2009 tour candidly at one point and says he doesnt know if he wasn't more dominant because he was older, or because he wasn't doping, or for some other reason.  I found it interesting that he listed age before his lack of doping (although, again, there is debate over whether he doped in 2009).  In that tour, Armstrong found himself in a battle with his own teammate Alberto Contador which continues throughout the race in absurd ways even though Contador early on proves himself to be the better rider.  For example, there is a moment in the tour where Johan Bruyneel tells Contador not to work in a breakaway because he doesnt want an accelerated pace that might risk pushing Armstrong off the podium.  Contador responds by attacking, and Bruyneel is left slamming his headset against the dashboard of his support car.

Really, Contador was in the right.  Its stupid to risk the overall classification of the Tour so a weaker teammate can get on the podium.  But thats the Armstrong effect, the guy makes the regular rules irrelevant.  Armstrong even defends some unconventional tactics at one point by saying, were doing it that way because Ive won the Tour 7 times!

But there are a lot of moments in that 2009 tour that clearly demonstrate the party is over.  At one point, Armstrong is sitting on a hotel bed watching the results of the initial prologue.  Hed briefly been in first place, but one by one his rivals post better times.  Its compelling to watch Armstrong sit there and seethe as he sees his result bettered.  He doesnt do, or say anything, but I think in that moment you understand Armstrong and theres something in the anguish he feels that isn't wholly despicable.  He looks like a very frustrated ten year old boy who is resolved to not allow his pain continue no matter what the consequences are.  Its like a silent temper tantrum with all the emotion of a child and none of the rational maturity of a reasoning adult.  How is it that a guy like Armstrong who had accomplished so much at that point still could get worked up into such an unpleasant emotional place?  It seemed like nothing in his life had taken the edge off, and yes, this is a person who is compelled by something to put his own personal health at great risk just for the fleeting joy of having the best time in a bike race?

As the race develops and Contador pulls away, Armstrong admits he feels tension for the Spaniard (the Spaniard claims the feeling is not mutual, but he pressures Armstrong on the course every chance he gets).  The only moment that Armstrong looks like he finds a bit of peace is when he accepts his chances of winning are gone, yet he manages to win a place on the podium (again, maybe with the help of a blood transfusion).

At the end of the film, I didn't feel anger against Armstrong, but sadness.  This is a guy with an emotional hunger that will never be filled.  I really wish the film, or the media in general, would start discussing what the long term effects of Armstrongs doping are.  Did this guy willingly sentence himself to an early grave for his fleeting glory?

Or who knows?  Maybe he just wants to be paid attention to?  Maybe hes grateful for this scandal because its kept him relevant over the last year.

I think, though, that the people who don't think Armstrong has been punished enough might enjoy this film.  You see the guy suffering and I at least realized that this is not an emotionally healthy person.  His treatment of people along the way cannot be justified, but the attack/win at all costs component of Armstrongs personality was never a secret.  The film doesnt justify anything, but I think it helps give you a better understanding of why events played out as it did.  In a scandal as wide reaching as this, understanding is about all you can hope for.  Hopefully peace will come to all the players, maybe further down the road.",1399680000,11,7361,4.581359816653935

6087908,4,B00GMV8CQU,"As others already commented, the documentarian started out thinking to make a positive documentary about Lance's comeback to the Tour de France after already winning 7 times.  Armstrong, long dogged by allegations of ""doping"", insisted that his 2009 race would be absolutely clean, and that he would post his blood results online.  Unlike his last win in 2005, he finished in third place that time, but continued competing in other cycling events.  Before Gibney could finish his documentary, Armstrong ended up appearing on the Oprah show and confessing that he had indeed used various banned substances for every one of his 7 victories in the Tour de France.  This put quite a different spin on Gibney's documentary, so in addition to the footage he had from the 2009 race, he interviewed several of the persons who had publicly accused Armstrong of doping despite his vehement denials, others who admitted it under investigation--and Armstrong himself as to how he now felt about the ""doping"".

Armstrong comes across in the 1:1 interviews as fairly candid (after all, he admitted almost everything already on Oprah) though not particularly repentant.  One of his ""justifications"" was simply this: everyone who was a serious competitor in the Tour de France, in the years that he won, was doping.  Those who were not doping were simply from countries or teams who lacked the expertise to do it without getting caught, and they didn't win or come close.

His detractors say: it wasn't just about the doping.  It was the sheer ruthlessness with which he went after anyone who tried to tell the truth: destroying any chance of their being involved in international biking competitions, threatening lawsuits, personally attacking their character and so on.

And then there's the cancer foundation.  Several hundred million dollars raised to help children with cancer, through the foundation he began.  And the great boost to competitive bicycling due, more than anyone else, to Lance Armstrong.  And his amazing recovery from metastatic testicular cancer, going on to win 5 more Tour de France races afterward.

I have not been any enthusiast of bicycling, let along competitive racing.  I thought the documentary might be a good portrayal of the character of someone who competes (and wins) at this kind of world-class level, which it was.  There is a single-minded, ruthless determination to win that tends to characterize many at the top of international competitions (and businesses).  In that sense, the Armstrong ""story"" is perhaps emblematic of the entire culture of competition and what it tends to give rise to: some of the best, and some of the worst of human behavior, all wrapped together.

I note there are at least 2 other documentaries out now on the same general topic.  This one was enough for me.  It's a complex story and one that can't be reduced to simple ""good"" and ""bad"" (like life itself).  Well done.",1398816000,,2924,5.037422037422037

6087921,4,B00GMV8CQU,"Even though the Lance Armstrong cycling records: SEVEN Tour de France victories are the stuff of legend, many of these subsequent insights are not. Begun as a puff piece to tout the fame and exalt the integrity of his amazing life, this movie provides much of the missing pieces from his successes and shocking elements of his humiliating failures as the documentary makers realized Armstrong's secrets had been hidden in plain sight the whole time.

""Win at any cost."" This is not only true in business, but also in today's cycling community. We can see how a newcomer evaluated the cycling world and realized he must compromise his beliefs. ""Don't bring a knife to a gunfight"" is his rationale. We see how Armstrong leveled the playing field because of a well-established tradition of heavy drug use in the sport. ""Everyone was doing it.""

""People want the beautiful lie more than they want the ugly truth."" Even while accusations were flying, the officials, the public and most of all the cancer survivors, denied the possibility that he used drugs. We have to remember the investment the cycling organizations had in Armstrong's fame plus his earning potential for bicycles, shoes, sports wear, sports drinks, etc., etc., etc. No one wanted to believe the rumors. Millions wore the iconic yellow wristband. Did you have one?

We evaluate the good and the bad:
  * Greatest hoax perpetrated on the sporting public - vs - Hundreds of millions raised for cancer research.
  * Alpha dog dominates team and sports - vs - Loving father who tries to protect his children.
  * Cancer survivor with adoring public - vs - Accusers who speculate cancer was caused by performance-enhancing drugs.
  * Adamant denial of drug use - vs - Full disclosure and admission of guilt.

This is Alex Gibney's fascinating documentary and believe me, I have NOT told you everything. This is a complicated tale, one in which you will switch sides many times.

It was painful, pathetic, and simply unbelievably sickening regarding the depths we tolerate our ""heroes"" to fall before, or even if, we scream ""ENOUGH!"" I have heard so many people say: ""But everyone was doing it..."" True. That is indisputable. However, not ""everyone"" was lifted into the superstar stratosphere of Armstrong where his name (not to mention his FOUNDATION) symbolized so much more than a sport. There will be more like Armstrong. There certainly were others who preceded him (did he arrogantly think Pete Rose was just dumb?). Until our culture finds its ethical compass and stands up and say ""NO MORE"" will we participate in making you a gazillionaire demi-god, there will be PLENTY more seeking to ""live the dream"".",1397433600,,775,5.0625

He was arguably the worlds most recognizable sports hero/celebrity in the world. During production Gibney who admits totally buying into the Armstrong myth initially Is forced by events to realize that his idol is a doper, liar and emotionally twisted villian!

Lots of interviews with those involved in the Armstrong scandal are included, with the most interesting one being of Armstrong himself.  He is STILL living in either denial or still trying to deceive others  as to just how bad his cheating and treatment of other people were.

This doc was supposed to highlight LA's comeback to the TDF but quickly backfired when the doping/lying/bullying/bribing/controlling/womanizing/ accusations got serious and quickly exposed LA's shady dark side and always in charge ego.  The camera work and ""in the peloton"" action shots are high quality with snappy and creative editing.  Throughout the movie we get to see LA in a dark room.  In his house? He somewhat adds to his minor league confession about his win at all costs motto as he orchestrated the biggest and most methodical and expensive PED program ever recorded. Festina Affair anyone?  But so were most of the other riders with a so-called ""omerta"" where the riders will never reveal the secrets behind the elixers they use to produce there incredible performances day after day!  So with Michele ""Dirty Doctor"" Ferrari's medical and training plan - $$$$$) he was always one step ahead of the Testers (UCI Verbruggen had a donation from LA to purchase and EPO test machine after he tested positive at the 1999 TDF Prologue he won and on a later stage at the Tour de Suisse). So after all of the hard training and legal/non-legal substances ingested, he might gain a mere 10% advantage on his rivals.  There is some great retro footage of LA in his teens and starting to reveal his ""take over the world"" attitude. Poor Georgie finally has to spill the beans on his not so squeaky clean image. I'm glad to see David Walsh finally getting some respect after all of his ""witch hunt"" and lawsuit years.  He just couldn't crack LA's stone faade no matter how much evidence he had piling up in his corner.

6088034,5,B00GMV8CQU,"Most documentaries begin with a premise (thats a kind word for bias, I suppose), and then nail the point home over and over. In some ways The Armstrong Lie does the same, but I found it far more fair and reasonable than most documentaries, and in its defense it tells you right in the title what the movie is about and where its going to go.

We all know Armstrong doped throughout, at the least, his first seven tours (he maintains he didn't in 2009), and this documentary didn't share anything new in that regard.

Armstrong is: really nasty to people when he targets them. The way he treatedand even suedpeople who were in fact telling the truth is a terrible mark of character.

Armstrong is: still a spectacular athlete. I don't particularly hold his drug use against him, and he still believesand I agreethat he won the Tours. We have to have sport cleaned up, but everybody was doing it, so his use didn't necessarily put himself ahead of them. Even in 2009 at the age of 38 to come in 3rd at the tour, even if he was on drugs on blood transfusion, is a remarkable feat considering others almost certainly were also (Contador got caught up in doping shortly thereafter).

Part of the problem is that during Armstrongs reign in cycling, a cyclist had to cheat to be competitive. Its unfortunate he went to the lengths he did to cover it up, specifically in regard to a few people who were close to the matter like his former teammate and that teammates wife.",1395014400,,1464,4.492481203007519

Alex Gibney and Frank Marshall created a balanced movie and it keeps you thinking post viewing, that is quality!!",1394928000,,448,5.507246376811594

My husband always believed in him and he did not even finish the film due to his disgust with LA.  It really bothered him and I can imagine others being upset too.  This was a good overview and a good place to begin looking closer at the issue of blood doping and the sport of cycling.  I understand the reason why  the top cyclist did what they did but that does not condone the lying.  Even more so, the treatment of outspoken team members by Lance.

Gibney does about as good a job as you could do with a guy who lied for so long then decided to tell the truth when it was convenient for him. No matter that he's a scumbag and should be thrown out to sea. Alex Gibney is a master storyteller and this time he was part of the story. Great editing, great shooting and he buried Armstrong.

Clearly Alex Gibney intended to make a film glorifying Armstrong's 2009 comeback.  Armstrong's 2013 confessions blew that idea to bits.  Gibney has acknowledged he then had to decide whether to produce a film or just ""to junk it all"".  Little would have been lost had he chosen the latter.

On this topic I much preferred firstly ""The Secret Race"" by Hamilton, Tyler and Coyle, Daniel followed by ""Wheelmen""  by Albergotti, Reed and O'Connell, Vanessa.",1394323200,2,612,4.771428571428571

Lance is the kind of man who can truly say ""I won"" or ""I beat you"" and believe it. Neglecting the regular injections of stimulants, hormones and blood boosters, this guy is the closest thing to superman we are likely to see in our lives.

6088066,3,B00GMV8CQU,"Armstrong's accomplishments (and methods of accomplishing them) were headlines for years.  You probably know someone that has Livestrong bracelet tucked into some junk drawer or still wear it.  Yet, while in the place to receive more information than any other journalist, the director fails to break through any more of the person that was seen over the years.  Maybe it is too much lingering resentment or some missed sense of justice: but Armstrong never breaks.  The director, for all his access, cannot shake Armstrong, which may speak to the cyclists character.  If you're looking for the guilty man, some form of repentance, you have come to the wrong place.

The information about the world of cycling and the history of the tour is interesting.  It brings into light all sports which aren't even primarily thought of by most of the world in a competitive context (running, body building).  This, more than anything, the rise and fall of a star athlete from an obscure sporting world.  The overall cinematography isn't that exciting; but the editing paced enough to keep the viewers attention from drifting too far away from the screen.",1393977600,,1144,5.01058201058201

Very interesting documentary for the realists, like me.  The movie does an excellent job of demonstrating how we can root for our athletic hero no matter what he/she does.  The documentary lets the viewer get a bit closer to the Armstrong legend persona.  But not too close, because Armstrong is always the player.  Armstrong is always in charge.  For those who cycle, it's a must see.  After seeing the movie I jumped on my Specialize and did a 50 mile ride...I was very motivated.  Go Armstrong!",1393632000,,636,4.9245283018867925

It is a more focused look at Armstrong's individual history--from a teenager to current time.  Great historical footage is mixed in--including great race footage.  The story feels slightly repetitive at times--but that is just how Armstrong's story unfolds at times.  I feel the producer was pretty fair-minded to Armstrong.  The movie allowed Armstrong to push the ""everyone was doing it"" myth/excuse without any real push-back.  Small criticism.  Overall entertaining and informative--especially for someone not into cycling.",1393632000,,618,5.442105263157894

6088071,4,B00GMV8CQU,"The Best Thing about this DVD is I can see with my own eyes how Armstrong constantly lied with a straight face to everybody questioning him about his doping. It vividly shows his personality. No words can describe it. You have to see it with you own eyes to see the real person below the surface.

The second best thing is to watch Dr. Michele Ferrari on film. He is the doctor who helped Armstrong win by doping and evading doping tests. The film did a good job of explaining clearly how Armstrong used EPO and blood transfusion supplied and initiated by the doctor. Dr. Ferrari was convicted of doping assistance in Italy. However, after 2 years he was acquitted. It is too much for Italian justice. It is amazing to see him, on film, calmly brushed off the criticism of doping by saying ""EPO at that time has been used for years by other teams.""

I agree with other viewers that this DVD does not offer anything new. However it is interesting and convincing to see with my own eyes the admission of guilt, the lying with a straight face, and the criticism brushing-off  by the perpetrators. ""A video clip is worth a thousand words"".

This DVD missed a lot of details that I found from the news and video clips on the Web. For example, it just said he ruined lives of many people who tried to expose his cheating but it did not specify how. Consequently, I did not felt bad for those people as when I read about them on the Web. Probably the director thinks those subjects have already been talked about too much in the news and books.

Right at the beginning, the director Alex Gibney said he wanted to know why Armstrong tried to come back to Tour de France in 2009. Had he not done that, he would not have fallen in disgrace. In the end, Armstrong did not give the director a clear answer.

In short, it is definitely worth watching. It is a good supplement to other sources on this subject.",1393372800,,1896,4.387464387464387
6088072,3,B00GMV8CQU,"A little self serving to Lance Armstrong for sure! I'm personally in the minority who always thought Lance doped and I didn't really care either. I never saw him as a cheat personally. It was just par for the course in my opinion. The UCI should be abolished, Lance should be forced to pay out to the individuals he crushed, and corporate sponsors should all be forced to pay back all the millions of $$ in earnings they saw from their 1 nut wonder boy to organize a new organization for the sport of cycling. A cycling organization made up of riders who police each other while more evenly distributing the wealth to all team members. All of this would be in a perfect world!

Most people have no clue that while this d#@khead was racking in millions many of his teammates were living at the poverty level. The whole system is F'ed for the guys who play by the book. Lance was the Oracle of doping in cycling period, and we as a society made it that way. The more he cheated the more he made. To think his sponsors didn't know is so naive. Shame on Trek, Nike, Oakley and everyone else who profited from this guy and then turned their back on him when it was convenient.

If you're a mindless minion who has to idolize people and enjoys branding themselves with those individuals and their ""marketers"" than this should be your wake up call. I think we have some real moral issues as a society when we witch hunt these people after blindly building them up like this. Maybe in some F'ed up way it's how people relate and can feel better about their sheepish existence.

The silver lining in this whole situation is not that you're all mindless minions, its that there are some real facts that did do some real good. Take these facts to your next lunch break when someone asks why you're wearing your live-strong bracelet again. Fact, this is the only person in any sport who has brought so much to cancer awareness, support, and research. Fact, he gave hope to so many who died and survived cancer. Fact, an alarming number of middle-aged, fat, lethargic people prevented disastrous health conditions and got up off the couch to do something with themselves in a more positive way. Fact, the numbers of positive influences he had on people and society far out weigh the negatives of finding out he was just another flawed human being(all be it a real d!@khead) like the rest of us. Fact, More money was made by a select few individuals and corporations in the cycling industry during his tenure as the ""Oracle of doping"" then at any other time in their existence.

So, take that to the water cooler! Watch this movie if you'd rather waste 2 hours of your life vs the time reading about it. Some of the videography is worth it too!",1393372800,,2730,4.475903614457831
6088073,4,B00GMV8CQU,"Like many of you, I was a complete Lance Armstrong fan. I was receiving chemo and radiation therapy for breast cancer in 2004 at the height of Armstrong's fame. I proudly wore one of the first 'Live Armstrong' yellow bands, and one of the research projects I was involved in was funded by Live Armstrong. It wasn't until 2010 when the rumors of Armstrong's cheating and doping became too much to ignore that I finally admitted my hero was a cheat.

In this documentary, Alex Gibney follows Armstrong on his comeback to the Tour de France. Along the way we follow Armstrong as Gibney films everything he can. This started out as a positive spin and ended up as the truth spin. Two hours and three minutes of the lies, then the truth as Armstrong sees it. The people he hurt and lives he destroyed. We meet everyone from the Italian physician who fashioned the doping that was not traceable, to the cyclists involved and the trainers and everyone but Armstrong's family. I wonder how they deal with this mess. What do they think of their father. He spun the winnings so many times that he actually came to believe he won Le Tour honestly. Why everyone was doing it, doping. It wasn't the doping as much as the abuse of power. The constant lying, the constant cheating.

The documentary is well done, featuring Armstrong admitting to his doping, but at the same time saying he won those seven yellow jerseys honestly. All of his medals, all of his trophies have been removed. Any trace of his winning has been removed from Le Tour history. The mistake he made, he says was to return in 2009 for the last race. People were after him, and many were bound to get him. We hear from those people, and at the same we hear from Armstrong refuting any cheating claims. The lives he destroyed from his bullying tactics is apparent with many of the people interviewed. Armstrong did not have to be so vindictive. For ten years he tried to beat down his opponents, and his detractors, and he won. In the end it is Armstrong who looks the fool. He is being sued by various organizations for hundreds of millions of dollars. He can no longer compete in any bicycling races, he is looked at as a cheater. The Live Strong organization withdrew any connection to him. What is left for Lance Armstrong?

We follow Armstrong from his cancer diagnosis through the end of the tour in 2011, and finally his moment of truth with Oprah Winfrey. We believed his lies, but no more. I have no pity for Lance, he deserves whatever comes his way. It will be difficult for anyone to believe in heroes from here on, what a lasting legacy.

Any cycling fan will enjoy the back stage pass and even casual observers of the sport will enjoy it.  It wasn't as bleak as I feared and I still felt upbeat after watching it.  Yes, Armstrong was a doper and liar, but he is still the greatest tour rider to ever live.",1392768000,,503,4.319148936170213

6088132,5,B00GMV8CQU,"Loved Lance and a great movie, he was such an inspiration but I knew there had to be more involved in the constant ""controversy"" following him all the years; plus, it seemed incredible his strength, but too I figured if he's doping then why can't they make it stick?? Unless like all corruption ""everybody's getting something!!"" Bingo! Great movie if you liked & followed him as I did; I have a problem w/ all of it, but to me corruption is everywhere + unfortunately/especially where big bucks are involved, money & power. I just hate that the youth get a raw deal w/ someone they look up to when this stuff happens. At least great stuff was accomplished through Livestrong.",1392508800,,675,4.633333333333334
6088133,4,B00GMV8CQU,"This documentary admits its own biases, and attempts to give an objective view of Lance Armstrong and his Tour De France wins. Lance was my hero, and he still is to some degree.

6088134,4,B00GMV8CQU,"Watching Lance Armstrong justify his use of performance enhancing drugs was interesting and somewhat convincing. His argument boils down to ""everybody's doing it, so I'd be a fool (and a loser) not to."" But seeing how he lied with such conviction, over and over again, and how he trashed people and wrecked lives, while interesting, was sad and rather depressing, perhaps because we've all had to deal with guys like this at one time or other. It's all about them, and if someone gets in the way, they're regarded as nothing more than road-kill that doesn't even warrant a glance in the rear-view mirror. Armstrong seems like a sociopath, albeit a rich one. He may be banned from competing, but he's made his millions, and this documentary gave me the impression that Mr. Armstrong has no self doubt and no regrets. Yes, this doc is about biking competitions, but it's really a character study. I enjoyed it, although I do think it runs a little bit too long.",1392508800,22,959,4.714285714285714
6088135,4,B00GMV8CQU,"Compelling documentary.  No new facts, but a bit more insight into ""The Lance"" persona.  One thing I was not prepared for was my first tug of sympathy when Lance was at his most  fragile and vulnerable after the stage at Verbier, Switzerland 2009 TDF when Contador assumed a commanding lead.  How completely different Lance was when he allowed for an honest, vulnerable reaction when he felt he'd let himself down and his fans down.  Lance, if you'd only been this way (totally honest, let your guard down, and vulnerable)when you decided to ""speak your truth"" to the authorities, it might've turned out differently....  But a defensive, narcissistic Lance always resurfaces... which is a Lance that always disappoints me.",1392422400,,722,5.076271186440678
6088136,5,B00GMV8CQU,"I learned that I know very little about cycling. While watching this documentary it was apparent that everyone from ALL ranks of cycling were using performance enhancing drugs/methods or knowingly profiting from the tainted winnings.

Lance Armstrong just happened to have a better doctor (EPO/blood transfusion), more money, more fame then most cyclists. He bankrupted ANYONE who challenged his claim of cycling ""clean"". Watching him in this documentary it was obvious that Lance Armstrong is sorry he got caught NOT sorry for being unable to win ""clean"". I wonder if he cares about how this will affect his children? I have a feeling he could care less about the effects of his lies. Lance Armstrong is a sociopath.

It was funny to watch some of Lance Armstrong's teammates turn on Lance, when they themselves were ""doping"" but acting in front of the camera as if they were trying to rid the cycling world of drugs and corruption. A bunch of narcissist's and sociopaths turning on each other and fighting in court and in the media.",1392422400,,1034,4.902857142857143
6088137,1,B00GMV8CQU,"Bob Dylan once wrote ""When there is too much of nothing, nobody can look"", and ""The Armstrong Lie"" is two hours of nothing.

Gibney set out to create a piece of film charting Lance's triumphant return to the sport, and a few years later when Armstrongs world crumbled around him was left with a pile of useless footage. His decision was to take his fawning puff piece about Armstrongs ""clean"" return to the sport in 2009, bookend it with some stuff about doping, What we end up with is a film about Lance's comeback (which incidentally Gibney seems pretty convinced was clean), a few doping anecdotes and not much else. Its less the ""armstrong lie"" than Alex's stupidity in actually believing the lies.

The entire film lacks conviction. The ""cast"" include, George Hincapie who just wants to smile and say they only doped a little bit, Michele Ferrari who is portrayed as, ""a very nice man"", a few US journalists who just want to be in a film, Dan Coyle (book to sell), David Walsh (book to sell), a brief cameo by Jonathan Vaughters, and the Betsy/Frankie double team. Now, Betsy, I love her, but seriously, put a film crew near her and quicker than you can say EPO, her hair is done, her makeup is done, and shes reciting ""EPO, Human Growth Hormone, Testosterone, and Cortisone"".

Notable in their absense are Tyler Hamilton, Floyd Landis, Greg Lemond, Emma O'Reilly, Paul Kimmage, Travis Tygart, the list goes on of just who isn't in the film as opposed to who is in it.

Whats perhaps the most annoying is the basic factual errors that pepper the film. That Armstrong sued Walsh and Ballister and won 1.5m (when it fact it was Times Newspapers). Gibney tells us that Armstrongs publication of his 2009 blood values convinced even his biggest critics he was riding clean when in fact his 2009 figures were widely viewed as being suspicious, so much so that Armstrong quickly removed the figures from his website. And the errors don't stop there, they come thick and fast in what increasingly becomes a determination to bill the 2009 return as Armstrong looking for redemption and doing it clean (despite what the USADA report said in regard to his 2010 values).

Fool me once shame on you, but not content with being fooled once and lied to in 2009, Gibney went back and allowed himself to be fooled again in 2013. Wether it be the ""lance coming back clean to prove the doubters wrong"" to the home videos of Lance being tested twice in the same day by USADA and the UCI (Which if you consider that he was in fact a cheat and a fraud, being tested heavily kind of comes with the territory) you find yourself wishing that the producer would just open his eyes and smell the roses.

The Armstrong Lie is less about the Armstrong Lie and more about Armstrongs determination to control the narrative. He was trying to control the narrative in 1999. in 2001, in 2005, in 2009, and in 2013 with Gibneys willingness to let him do so, he controls the narrative again.

As Dylan said, ""its all been said before, its all been written in the book, but when theres too much of nothing, nobody can look"".",1392249600,18,3093,4.582278481012659

8624893,4,B00GMV8CQU,"Lance Armstrong was a cancer survivor and a cycling champion who won the Tour De France seven times. When he finally comes clean about his actual doping, it's hard to feel sympathy when he has lied for so long and to millions of people. I guess he thought he could get away with lying about his drug use (illegal in the sport) but he wasn't the first or alone. There were others and plenty of people in the sport were aware about it.

The two hour documentary helps explore Lance Armstrong not just as a liar but as a flawed human being. His fall from grace was tremendous and heartbreaking. To be at the very top of your game only to lose everything, Lance Armstrong may come across as likable or unlikable. I don't have much care either way. He is after all a human being who made choices and must live with the consequences.

The DVD comes with deleted scenes and a Toronto Question and Answer session with Alex Gibney but Lance Armstrong was not in attendance.",1530576000,,964,4.410112359550562

If everyone is doping (and it was made clear in the movie that everyone was doping), then the guy that finishes first wins the race.  Lance won those races.  Lance made people millions of dollars.  The sport was aware that it was overrun by doping.  Armstrong tried to compete clean in a sport that was not clean by everyone's assessment.  Was he suppose to continue to lose or play ball?  It says alot that his titles were taken but were not passed on to the ""true"" winners because of allegations of doping as well.  Armstrong was used and then he was made a scapegoat.
