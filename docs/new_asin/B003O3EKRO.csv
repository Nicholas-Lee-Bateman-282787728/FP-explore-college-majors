4161626,3,B003O3EKRO,"This is a Mexican movie with English subtitles. It is set mostly in a vineyard area on the coast of Baja California. The story is about a playboy and the son of the vineyard owner who seems to be an accomplished winemaker but with wild tendencies. One night after partying hard, he wakes up not being able to remember the previous night, but with a women in his bed and a marriage certificate on his nightstand. She claims they got married in a drunken party (Las Vegas-style). He is horrified but eventually agrees to let her stay until they are sure she isn't pregnant. The next few weeks are rough as she doesn't allow him to continue in his wild ways but also doesn't allow him to touch her. Eventually their relationship begins to thaw a bit and the end is a fairly standard romantic comedy ending. There is nothing terribly original about this movie. The beginning is a bit uneven and cheesy but it eventually settles down into a decent story. Some things are inexplicable at the beginning. For instance, why would the girl apparently trick the guy into marrying her and insist on staying with him but then act as though she despises him and not allow him to get near her? Some of these things resolve themselves in what is something of a surprise twist near the end of the movie. The film isn't terribly raunchy but there are numerous suggestive scenes and the girl wears provocative clothing around the house. In the end, most of the characters seem likable and the movie isn't terribly bad. In my mind, it isn't a romantic comedy classic, but it's serviceable. For those who don't know Spanish, the title is a play on words. Recien casado means ""recently married."" The title recien cazado sounds almost the same but means ""recently bagged.""",1373760000,10,1749,4.627009646302251

4161628,5,B003O3EKRO,"Subtitles don't even phase me when it comes to this movie and I highly recommend watching it sub, not english dubbed!.  It's fun to watch and I enjoyed the cast.  As long as I'm enjoying the movie, I have no problems reading all of the subtitles. Highly recommend this movie to anyone who just wants to kick back with their significant other and enjoy a light-humored movie.",1372032000,,374,4.567164179104478

4161630,4,B003O3EKRO,"Esta pelcula la compr yo para ver si era algo que fuera til para mi clase de espaol avanzada. Los temas de amor, de ser fiel a una persona, de matrimonio inesperado y de burlas ya han sido todas exploradas un sin fin de veces. Sin embargo, ""Recin cazado"" fue divertido y estoy contento que lo compr aunque no s si lo pueda usar como hay dos o tres escenas en las cul se ve brevemente el pecho de la actriz principal. Como enseo muchachos de secundaria tendra yo que estar algo pendiente de esas partes de la pelcula para poder pararla momentneamente, cubrir el imagen en la pantalla, y despus seguir adelante. Para una clase al nivel universitario si es que la pelcula sea para un grupo de adultos jvenes ya no sera ningn problema. Como maestro de espaol siempre ando buscando pelculas que sean entretenidas y que aguanten el inters de los muchachos. Se ti gustan las pelculas de comedia y te gusta rer, hay poca duda que por el precio que se paga por esta pelcula que estars contento con la inversin de esos cuantos dlares.",1367107200,17,1024,4.423280423280423

4161632,5,B003O3EKRO,"As I couldn't find ""Cazado"" translation in either Spanish  (Mexican, Castillian) or Portuguese until it was spelled correctly as Casado, it took me a long time to find the DVD but I am glad I persisted.  This is a charming meet cute comedy/romance - great for a rainy Saturday afternoon.",1363910400,,287,4.72

4161634,5,B003O3EKRO,One of my favorite movies. Spanish movies are very hard to find. Here I was able to purchase and enjoy the movie!,1358208000,,113,4.181818181818182
4161635,5,B003O3EKRO,"I teach Spanish at the university level and I occasionally show a movie in Spanish to the class. My students thoroughly enjoyed this movie. They thought it was very funny and laughed at all the funny parts. Sometimes when I show a movie, I don't have time to show the entire movie. After watching the beginning of Recien Cazado, the students kept asking me when I would show the rest of the movie. They really wanted to finish watching the movie. The students also liked the fact that they understood what the characters said when they spoke. The subtitles were very well translated.",1356652800,,583,4.669902912621359
4161636,4,B003O3EKRO,"No a movie for deep thinkers, but is funny enough.  But I've been working on using this to learn Spanish and it is good for learning some of the language, the rhythms, etc. with the language.  The dialog is distinct and clear.",1356480000,,226,4.357142857142857
4161637,5,B003O3EKRO,"The movie Recien Cazado is exactly what I expected since I have seen the movie previously.  It is a very good love story with a twist, however the voice over tracks are lousy, so I advise reading the subtitles instead.",1349913600,,218,4.45
4161638,5,B003O3EKRO,"I saw this movie at first because it has Jaime Camil and he has a sense of humor that I love, Ihave seem him in 1 novela and another movie...
When I saw this I decided to get it since I love latino comedy and specially habla Hispana.
Let me tell.......it is so comical that I am going to download an Iphone version So if I'm stranded somewhere horrible or boring I can laugh my butt off. :-)",1349568000,,391,4.0256410256410255
4161639,5,B003O3EKRO,"This movie had me laughing out loud from beginning to end.  It ends appropriately and with good humor.  I recommend this for a valentine's evening romantic get-away movie.  The bits of over-acting only added to the mood and overall theme of the show.  Yes, a love story AND a comedy.  I do not know how the actors and actresses kept straight faces through the filming.  Will watch again.",1328918400,,387,4.617647058823529
4161640,3,B003O3EKRO,"The movie's plot is simple: a bachelor who is addicted to one-night stands and is terrified of commitment gets drunk one night and ends up married to a complete stranger; he then tries to get disentangled and ends up loving the girl. This movie is a pleasant fluff piece and the plot is totally predictable and has been used several times in one way or another.

The scenery is gorgeous and so are the girls. Alexa especially is a knockout, with a very expressive face. I do have a couple of minor complaints and that is, first, the guy is supposed to be a chick magnet, but he is dog-ugly (maybe by Mexican standards, he is supposed to be good looking); second, his appealability to girls would have been more convincing had it been low key and not so blatant (What's New Pussycat achieved this very well by making the girls' aggressiveness not so absurd).

If you don't understand Spanish, the subtitles give a good translation.",1325548800,2,930,4.596385542168675
4161641,5,B003O3EKRO,I've seen this movie many times and it never gets tiring. Es una pelicula que no importa cuantas veces la mires no te cansa. Sera porke Gabriela Vetgara esta asi de buenota???? Se los dejo a su criterio.,1320883200,,203,4.368421052631579
