7938738,1,B00005JH94,"I saw this at  the American Film Market, while i was working/ slaving at it. HAHA.  well,  it is awful.  I sat and watched it with the actors and the film maker.  and poor Ernest Borgnine.  Of course had to tell them i liked it.  but it was god awful.  Very fake looking and hokey. A very poor rip off of ET.  Even Mac and Me is better.  But they did give out stuffed turtles at the screening and i still have it.",1324252800,,413,3.8674698795180724

7938740,1,B00005JH94,"I cannot even mention this movie while keeping a straight face. It is so, so terribly and disgustingly pathetic that even kids will cry from the pure sadomaschist images seen on screen. The people didn't even try to make Mel believable; it's like the production desiger said, ""let's take some of this crap latex and stick it onto some metal parts. Take apart this Electo-set motor and form it into a turtle."" Seriously, did director Joey Travolta honestly think the mechanical turd was convincing? You can freakin' see the skin flopping around over the mechanics! And the visual effects are so, so poor that you'd think Uwe Boll would use them in his next mockfest. Ernest Borgnine was definitely on drugs to believe he could save this atrocity. Miss this, and if anyone tells you to see it, kill them.",1143244800,2,802,4.735714285714286
7938741,4,B00005JH94,Not a great movie but Ernest Borgnine brings a credible performance and the story is touching. Likely appeals to the early grade school kids.,1109376000,3,141,4.916666666666667
7938742,1,B00005JH94,"This movie is too painful to even review. Don't waste your money. This is not a kids movie, it's a torture device. This movie should be prescribed to people who suffer from insomnia.",1005264000,3,182,4.545454545454546
