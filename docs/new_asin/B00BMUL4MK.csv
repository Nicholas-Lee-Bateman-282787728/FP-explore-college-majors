5652644,2,B00BMUL4MK,"Volcanoes, earthquakes, ice cyclones, ash clouds that will block out the sun for years and make Europe uninhabitable...it's just another mundane day for almost all of the actors in this movie. We have all heard of overacting, but this is underacting at its most glaring. Except for the French girl (who is probably Hungarian, since her name is Eastern European and the film was partly filmed in hungary)everyone here seems pretty calm and collected. The hot French girl Angelique (Zsofia Trecsko)can't speak English very well, but she does manage to be the only character who gets the fact that there is a very strange and dangerous change in the world going on, namely the extinction of all life in her native Europe. She does a great job in her mute fear. Everyone one else is super casual about the following: the Earth opening up, so they have to run/drive/fly to escape, the Tour Eiffel is about to fall and kill some of the main characters, mega hail falls from the sky, and of course, the brother and the sister keep falling and having things fall on them with nary a scratch or broken bone. The young wife of the father (everyone in all movies and TV is either getting divorced, is divorced, or just got remarried after a divorce...the global divorce rate must be 556%) takes an excruciatingly  long rolling fall wherein she hits her head on a rock, and after pops up, literally smiling broadly, and happily exclaims, ""It beats walking."" There are countless such moments such as these. But, horrible acting with one exception aside, the special effects weren't bad, and we enjoyed yet another disaster movie that takes out the Eiffel Tower. The movie's non-stop pace helps keep the mind off the poor acting. We like these weather/earthquake/tsunami/things that are genetically engineered fall from space types of movies, so I'll give it two stars. If you don't like this genre, or find Asylum films objectionable, stay clear.",1370649600,8,1933,4.857575757575757

5652646,1,B00BMUL4MK,"This may be one of the worst movies ever released. The vast majority of the film is pent insulting the intellect of the audience. Most of the dialogue is concentrated on pounding the premiss into the heads of an audience the writers obviously consider to be prepubescent and too mentally deficient to grasp the initial concept of the film. Watching film is utterly excruciating due the the drawn out nature of material events and the constant pounding of of already explicitly expressed concepts. Cultural competency, in its most fundamental form, is totally absent as characters portray themselves as stereotypical archetypes of various countries. This film will make you stupider for watching it. An ass raping is preferable to viewing this travesty.",1369785600,,752,5.223140495867769
5652647,5,B00BMUL4MK,"This is a must for Asylum fans. All others avoid this film. I couldn't stop laughing.

The film follows a typical Asylum formula for disaster films. While the world is coming to an end, parents try to reunite with their children. On your Asylum column marked ""Disasters"" please check the following: volcano, ice age, hail, earthquake, sun blockage, ice cyclone (hand write ""ice"" in front of cyclone, then check).

The German scientist (Ivn Kamars) speaks with an accent. The word ""model"" he pronounces ""moe-doe"" until 12 minutes into the film when he begins to pronounce it correctly. Like many films, it has subscripts showing the location which are typed in with accompanying typing noise in the background. In the first few instances the typing noise needlessly continues after the letters appears.

Dad must travel from England to France. He manages to get a car with the steering wheel on the left side and finds roads where he can drive on the right side. Who would notice a guy driving in England on the wrong side of the road with a car with the steering wheel on the wrong side?

This film also boasts one of the worse uses of a defibrillator. The operator used it over the clothes, no lubricant. Ryan (Marc McKevitt Ewins) is immediately revived after that.

The film makes for a great drinking game too. Everyone needs to do a shot every time Ryan is knocked to the ground. SPOILER: After doing a half dozen or so shots, you will need to do three quick ones at the end.

The acting and dialogue are typical Asylum grade. It promises to be hopelessly bad.

No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. 5 Asylum stars for lovers of bad films (1 star for everyone else) This was a stinker.",1367625600,20,1680,4.617449664429531

And it has the classic older male and very young female lead actor pair-up which probably wouldn't occur in real life (35 year age difference - really?), but holds up the typical Hollywood sterotypes where older men always attract the much younger female.

5652678,3,B00BMUL4MK,"This is a charming little movie redolent of Plan 9 From Outer Space. Imagine, if you will, a director who wants to make a Euro version of the classic disaster movie but only has a budget of around $1,000. What's he to do? Hire his friends, make do with the most cheesy ""special effects"" imaginable, and hope for the best.

The result is unintentionally hilarious, from the dire script, atrocious ""acting"" and comical model aircraft to the risible effects and camerawork. It had me laughing out loud every few minutes. There are multiple scenes where supposedly the world is coming to an end but in the background you can see regular people just going about their business because the producers didn't have enough money to film on closed streets. Or the incongruity between ""the traffic is jammed everywhere"" statements and then a long shot of a single car driving along an empty main road. But I'm not mocking the movie. It's so earnest and so well-intentioned that you can't help liking the fact that they tried so hard to get it made despite lacking practically every component necessary. In its own way it is truly a labor of love and as such, despite everything, quite admirable. The net result is that you end up watching a movie very much like one your own eight-year-old would make with her school friends if someone gave her $1,000 and a couple of weeks of spare vacation time. You can't help liking it even through the most cringe-worthy moments.

So if you have a wry sense of humor and 90+ minutes to kill, I can honestly recommend this budget flick as a pleasant way to spend the time.

And unlike its slick big-budget Hollywood counterparts, there's no gratuitous violence or pretentiousness. Just a group of film makers desperately trying to get everything into the can before the cash ran out and the school holiday came to an end.",1423612800,,1846,4.691358024691358
5652679,2,B00BMUL4MK,"""100 Below Zero"" is one of those movies that purchase and watch you can't believe that you bought it and spent the time watching.  The basic deal of this movie is on scientist believe that a new ice age is coming. He has people who don't believe him but of course soon he is proven to be truth. The center of the ""average person"" going through the new ice age is a ex-military man meeting up with his kids are in the center of the event (of course) and there is some family drama but in the end dad get there to save the kids and they live happier ever after new the new warm zone.
I really like these crazy weather, end of the world movies but this one was really not that good. While they had the key elements, One tough military type, a family have drama, and a friend that has the escape route.  The action was almost funny at time. If you like the genre, do yourself a favor and skip this movie.",1416700800,3,900,4.0790960451977405

5652722,1,B00BMUL4MK,"This may well be the worst disaster movie The Asylum has ever made  and thats saying something.  Im probably the worlds biggest Asylum fan, but even I will admit the company turns out some embarrassingly bad films  especially over the past couple of years.  100 Below Zero is nothing but a horribly cheap film with bad acting, a terrible script, and absolutely abysmal special effects that could very well have been thrown together in a week.  Its particularly sad to see a decent actor like John Rhys-Davies pretty much announce to the world that his acting career is officially over.

A volcanic explosion in Iceland triggers a series of earthquakes and further volcanic explosions along some tectonic plate all the way across most of northern Europe.  Its just the type of disaster scenario that some forgettable scientist projected four years ago  but, aside from a video chat room full of his loser friends who are far too young to have the responsibilities were supposed to believe they have, no one cares what this guy says apart from some NATO colonel (Rhys-Davies).  NATO, by the way, is apparently a two-man operation operating out of what appears to be someones home.  Enter our main characters, former Air Force colonel Steve Foster and family.  Steve is flying to Paris alongside his new young wife to meet his son and daughter  until hes grounded in London.  Meanwhile, all heck is tearing loose in Paris  the ash cloud arrives, the temperature plummets, earthquakes rock the city, etc.  Fortunately, I suppose, all of this takes place on a day when the entire Paris population consists of about six people.  Will Foster get to Paris in time to save his kids from an inundation of snowfall, horrible winds, and record cold?  If you can bring yourself to care what happens to any of these people, you're obviously a better person than I am.

Fosters two twenty-something kids obviously inherited none of their fathers toughness and survival skills.  Ryan, for example, actually falls over unconscious at one point after being lightly bumped by a passerby.  Get used to it because Ryan falls down a lot  I mean a lot.  Dont even think about playing any type of drink every time Ryan falls down game because alcohol poisoning is no laughing matter.  This guy cant take two steps without doing a header.  If falling down were an Olympic event, he would win gold and silver.  His sister falls down a lot, too  but shes got nothing on her big brother.  The guy is a falling down fool.

If you watch this film, just sit back and try to enjoy the absurdity of it all.  Who knew that normal people wearing summer clothes could even survive at a temperature of 100 below zero?  Apparently, as long as you rub your arms up and down from time to time, you don't have to worry about frostbite or anything.  Heck, you don't even see anyones breath in this environment.  Why?  Well, the half a million dollar budget obviously didn't allow for any kind of decent CGI  or a halfway decent plot.  The bulk of the movie consists of bad actors standing in front of green screens and failing to convey any sense of their supposed environment.  Unless you love laughing at embarrassingly bad movies, steer clear of this one.",1389830400,3,3216,4.710951526032316

Anything other than this is just a bunch of people with the IQ of goldfishes, lucking out and surviving a major disaster, while smarter, less annoying people, die. I don't understand why the director took such a slow, leisurely pace with the actors. You are trying to go through a disaster, there is no sense of urgency, the female lead (Lacey) has a patently absurd ability to stand there, stamp her feet with bad acting, or just panic needlessly. The stepmother also does nothing but panic and annoy her new husband with her inability to withstand stress. For the amount of time they spend trying to build characters, everyone is 2 dimensional and you'd feel no sympathy for these people to just die in the cold.

5652748,4,B00BMUL4MK,"My friends and I find that Asylum films are hit or miss.  They are all horrifically bad, no doubt, but about half fall into the so-bad-it's-good camp, and the other half fall into the oh-god-shoot-me-now camp where they are just plain boring and painful.  This one was definitely in the former.  It is glorious to behold in the full splendor of it's awfulness.

The space in between the cgi that looks like it's out of a 90's computer game and the cookie-cutter disaster flick plot is filled with the wondrously bad acting of the lead characters, who constantly (I repeat, CONSTANTLY) randomly fall over in the fakest way possible in the middle of a scene in what I can only assume is an attempt to indicate to us that there is an earthquake.  Then you have the german scientist who insists on saying the word model over and over and pronouncing it moe-dell, while repeatedly saying that he does not like to engage in hyperbole when people ask him what exactly is going to happen based on his weather moe-dells (the writers clearly were looking for the word hypotheticals).  Oh, and the person he talks to most of the time is Gimli from Lord of the Rings, who they somehow got to play a pretty large part as a war general inexplicably in charge of something to do with weather in Europe.

The science is absurd, but who cares what is causing it, because whatever it is gets us cgi earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tidal waves, and even an ice tornado that tears apart the Eiffel tower.  At one point ice balls the size of volleyballs rain from the sky, and one of the main characters saves someone from getting hit by soccer kicking one out of the sky.  How can you not love a movie like that?

When dad and step-mom are grounded Britain, they get a car and dash through the Chunnel. In case you didn't guess it, Chunnel floods and they miraculously outrun the flood into France. Bro spends a lot of time getting knocked down and hitting his head but manages to avoid injury, including when he was electrocuted. When a giant hail stone is falling toward bro in his first of many fall-and-can't-get-up scenes, Sis manages to get to him in time to kick the giant hail stone away--with no injury to her foot (must have been protected by those expensive summer shoes with no socks. Sis gets trapped under a light, wooden bookshelf my 8th Grader could have lifted with one arm but Bro can't even budge it. He has to search for a steel pipe for leverage. Sis and another young lady run around in the freezing weather in tight fitting summer clothes. They had coats for a short time but robbers took the coats, apparently, so the ladies could show off their figures for the rest of the movie. They manage to avoid hypothermia, frostbite and generally being turned into human popsicles when that is what would have happened (for as cold as it was supposed to be, not one scene of frosty breath). It was also pretty silly having bro, sis and other young lady slide down a steel cable from the Eifel Tower into a helicopter while somehow avoiding the rotors. Don't look too close or you'll see the traffic in the background although Paris is supposed to largely abandoned or the lack of snow when there should be inches of it. And on and on and on. I only finished the movie as my kid and I were having such a terrific time making fun of what I would call complete and utter nonsense.",1518134400,,2040,4.413793103448276
