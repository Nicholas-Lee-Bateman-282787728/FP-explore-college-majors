2662441,5,B000IONJI8,"After months and years of waiting, it is finally coming!  Ever since the release of Season 1, Airwolf fans such as myself have only grown more hungry for the next couple seasons.  Myself and many others, I'm sure, actually signed an online petition begging Universal to release Season 2 on DVD.  I'll be the first to sign for Season 3 when the time comes.

Airwolf was the most brilliant show of all time - and it was truly ahead of its time.  Even today, a slick, black, Mach 1+ attack helicopter with retractable chain guns, rocket pods, turbo thrusters, infra-red imaging, etc. would be an incredible addition to our military.  This show stands apart from others because instead of a man being the hero, it is a machine.  It is a show that when you watch it, you think to yourself, I've got to get one of those - and you sit in awe, salivating, as you watch it in action.

Even now, I'm salivating at the thought of purchasing Season 2.  I recommend this show for anyone looking for a great 80s action series.  I would give it 4 thumbs up if I could.  Instead I'll give it 5 stars.",1158883200,15,1084,4.343283582089552

Today, there are radio control flying reproductions as kits of this helicopter,
and it certainly is most striking. I am building one with all working lights
including strobes, opening doors, scale initerior, and retractable landing gear.

2662525,4,B000IONJI8,"If you like menacing machinery, Airwolf is great.  Personally, I've always found the 'wolf in sheep's clothing' concept ludicrous, since this particular helicopter looks sleek and menacing no matter how one tries to disguise it as some sort of civilian aircraft.  Airwolf most closely resembles an orca (aka killer whale) with a propeller beanie -- a weird picture, but unquestionably deadly, and the image of an apex marine predator somehow translated into the air.  So I've always wondered why anyone would choose to face and try to fight her, instead of turning tail and running (or in this case, flying) away as quickly as possible.  Of course, then Bellisario and Company would have had no stories to tell...",1386720000,,713,5.016949152542373

2662529,3,B000IONJI8,"Had the net been around back in the mid-1980's, there would have been an interesting debate on which was the better vigilante show, Airwolf or The A-Team.  Both had lots of bullets flying from former military men, rarely hitting anyone (though Airwolf had a much higher body count), characters cracking wise to lighten things up, and enough do-gooding to satisfy most viewers.

Airwolf changed direction from the first season, when it was an espionage show with international intrigue.  It showcased new technology, and seemed unlike most shows on TV at the time.  But I guess the ratings weren't good enough, so the network (CBS) forced a move to more domestic situations.  This was not to the series' benefit, and it made for a lesser show, as it was always 'bad local man wants to rule over the locals', a scenario that The A-Team was already mining, and without an advanced chopper.  It led to the marginalization of Archangel (Alex Cord) and Marella (Deborah Pratt, wife the show's creator), who seemed to be in about 1/3 of the episodes, with less screen time than usual even in those.  Introduced in this season is Caitlin O'Shaughnessy (Jean Bruce Scott), who Dom and String help out in one of their vigilante missions early on, and sort of attaches herself to them.  She seems to exist to give those guys someone to talk to, and lend a female presence.  Scott isn't bad in the role, poorly written though it is, and she's attractive without being too obviously eye candy.

Ernest Borgnine as Dom is in a lot of ways the heart of the show, the cranky old man who's the only one String seems to listen to.  His cranky old man tendencies get a little too much screen time, he's the main character in more episodes than you'd think, but it's always nice to see Borgnine in action.  The same cannot be said for Jan-Michael Vincent, who has three facial expressions:  A goofy smile that's seldom used......studied indifference (the dominant one).....and a scowl, which befits this most hostile of characters.  Vincent's struggles with drugs and alcohol are now a minor legend, but it's hard to tell here if that's the issue here, or that he's just not a good actor.  It's certainly worth noting that nothing he's done other than this and Winds of War (for which he was not hired back for the sequel) have endured.

The villains and damsels in distress were almost uniformly bad, as were the local heroes who needed String's and Dom's help.  And I mean bad, not that the dialogue they were given was Shakespeare to begin with.  The contrast between the acting of then and now is  rather jarring, almost 30 years later.

Airwolf isn't a bad show, but you can understand how it only lasted three seasons (sorry, like most fans I don't count the fourth season on USA Network).  If only it had stuck to the original premise.....

The reproduction is very well done. It plays well on both my Blue Ray player and my DVD player. I could not be happier. Everyone did a fantastic job on this and everyone should be congradulated and commended for all their hard work and efforts to bring back something so many of us enjoyed for a very long time. I can at least say Thank you so very much for releasing it so we can enjoy for a long time to come and at any time. Sincerely and thankfully, Suzi",1344902400,,707,4.160583941605839

2662549,5,B000IONJI8,I really like Airwolf. It was on tv when I was in high school.  Compared to all the violence and other garbage that's on now this is a lot better to watch and there aren't any commercials either..  Back then there wasn't many commercials anyway.

They freeze midway. I have tried on two other DVD players and on my computers and it does the same thing. Amazon will not usually refund or exchange after 30 days, but they made an exception for me and I received 20% off (after over a year of having these DVDs.) They did offer me a full refund, but the collection is so cool and at least I know the DVDs I have do work (except for the ones mentioned above.)

Good show.",1223164800,,335,4.21875
2662573,5,B000IONJI8,"Over the last year, I've been borrowing my Dad's copy of the first season of Airwolf. Watching it sure brought back memories of the 80's. Well, for our anniversary, my wife ended up giving me season 2. I don't recall seeing all of the episodes in season 2, so it's been fun to continue to experience the world of Airwolf. While I'm still not done watching the season, there definitely have been some good, classic episodes.

One of my favorites so far is about another ""super"" helicopter called the HX-1 that was stolen. It didn't look quite as cool as Airwolf, but definitely had some of its same capabilities (especially weaponry). It, of course, is stolen, so Hawk and Dom are expected to go and ""take care of it."" I'm not going to spoil the rest of it, but definitely a good show.

With this season, Airwolf obviously continues to grow. The premise is typically the same for most episodes, but with the addition of characters in season 2, it still makes it worth your while.",1219881600,,978,4.551136363636363
2662574,4,B000IONJI8,"Second Season was much lighter than first season and did not have the same moral content. I loved 1st season and Jan Michael!!
In 2nd season, Airwolf was used for some local problems....which I found rather unbelievable.  Also, in some episodes Jan Michael looked VERY thin and his acting was not as good as the first season. I quess his alcohol problem was taking over at this point !!!  Even so, the episodes were enjoyable.
  My 2nd season DVD from Amazon was missing 6 episodes. They were on the jacket but not on the menu. They offered to refund my money but I liked the episodes that I received... so I just kept the DVD.",1218585600,,627,4.426086956521739
2662575,5,B000IONJI8,"Wow. This is even better than I remembered it. All that beautiful action footage, feature-quality aerials for the Lady (even if some were B-roll from previous episodes from the 1st season) mixed with tremendous performances.

Stand-out episodes included: 'MOFFETT'S GHOST' (The late David Hemmings reprises his role as Dr Moffet in this gripping ""ghost in the machine"" script), 'HX1', 'FALLEN ANGEL', 'SHORT WALK TO FREEDOM', and the awesome 'SWEET BRITCHES' guest-starring The A-Team's Lance Le Gault (Col. Decker) as a corrupt sheriff being the stand-out episode for me. One of the most satisfying aerials of the season too with a rocked-up Airwolf main theme thundering over the moody visuals.

Pair this with the new, digitally-remastered 'Airwolf Themes' soundtrack from Amazon's MP3 downloads section and you've the perfect package to take you into the world of Hawke, Santini, Archangel, (the newly-introduced) Caitlin and the Lady herself. A++",1211241600,,951,5.506849315068493
2662576,5,B000IONJI8,"Ok, I know everyone is entitled to their opinion but to say that there probably won't be a huge fan following? Well, let me correct you, there is a GIANORMOUS fan following, just look online at all the fan sites & forums, all the obsessed fans out there! I'm glad that they put this on video but the downside is that some footage was cut compared to the original airing. This sometimes takes away from the show, especially if I KNOW there used to be a scene that's no longer there! The ppl who put these together REALLY should've kept ALL 3 season's episodes intact! Example: I keep seeing scenes on the intro preview or closing credits that wasn't in the video iteself as well as I know, pretty much, each episode by heart from way back when so I know if/when something goes missing. The only thing about these episodes is the editing. I keep finding editing mistakes & 'bloopers' for lack of a better word which makes it seem kinda rediculous because the editors SHOULD've caught that; but other than that, IMO, the series w/Jan COULD'VE & probably WOULD've lasted longer than 3 seasons if he had put his person issues aside & just done his job but he didn't & I'm just glad that they FINALLY released all three seasons now. I DID notice, however, on the season 1 case, there are scenes on the backside which include the season 4 cast which is a REALLY really stupid thing to have done, in fact, I find it QUITE insulting. In conclusion, GET the dvds. If you love Airwolf, GET the dvds! I watch the episodes over & over, drooling over Jan & the Lady! I never get tired of this show!",1207612800,5,1584,4.391156462585034
2662577,3,B000IONJI8,"I got what I wanted, which is Season 2 of Airwolf.  I always liked Airwolf when I was a kid, but now that I watch them after 20 years, I see why the show was cancelled in their 4th season.  Still, I am enjoying the ride back to my childhood.  I do have one issue, and that is with Disc #3.  I tried 2 different DVD players and I am unable to get a few of the episodes to play.  I will be contacting Amazon regarding this problem.",1205193600,2,429,3.8295454545454546
2662578,5,B000IONJI8,"Still my favorite but like season 1,3 this DVD set is no frills of any kind, just the shows complete.",1201824000,,101,4.1
2662579,4,B000IONJI8,"This 1984-85 Season of AIRWOLF DVD is awesome along with the fact that this Superchopper series 2nd Season is even better than the 1st Season, since this season of this show is more upgraded, more sophisticated and has more action than the First Season does along with the fact that AIRWOLF's 1st Season was only an abbreviated season, since this show didn't premiere on CBS until Sunday January 22, 1984.

In addition to that, the Second Season is when Jean Bruce-Scott joins the case & crew as Hawke(Jan-Michael Vincent) and Dom's(Ernest Borgnine)spunky fellow pilot(Caitlyn O'Shaunessy), which made the episodes of AIRWOLF more interesting and enjoyable than the First Season along with AIRWOLF showing off more features too.

Therefore, I think this is the second best season of AIRWOLF that made its debut in January of 1984, but the Third Season is even better than the first 2 seasons throughout AIRWOLFs whole 2 1/2-year run on CBS, despite the fact that this show didn't last very long and started getting a drop in ratings during this 1984-1985 Season which resulted in AIRWOLF's cancellation in the Spring of 1986 which was when KNIGHT RIDER was cancelled too.

It was also interesting seeing guest stars in this 1984-1985 Season like
*James Whitmore, Jr. in the ""Sweet Britches"" episode before his co-starring days as Hunter & McCall's ornery fellow officer (Det. Bernie Terwilliger)on the police drama HUNTER

*Jared Martin in the ""Santinis Millions"" episode during his co-starring days on DALLAS

*Mills Watson in the ""Eruption"" episode after his co-starring days as the doofus Deputy Perkins on SHERIFF LOBO

*Lance LeGault playing a crooked Sheriff in the ""Sweet Britches"" episode during his co-starring days as the ornery Army nemesis(Col. Decker) on THE A-TEAM & his co-starring days as Magnum's disgruntled Navy nemesis(Col. Green)on MAGNUM, P.I.

*Jennifer Aniston's father(John Aniston) in the ""Short Walk To Freedom"" episode before his co-starring days on DAYS OF OUR LIVES

*Anne Lockhart in the ""Random Target"" episode after her co-starring days as Sheba BATTLESTAR GALACTICA

*Nick Campbell in the episodes ""Prisoners Of Yesterday"" and ""The Inn At The End Of The Road"" after his earlier co-starring days as THE HITCHHIKER, which was of course before Nick Campbell was replaced by Page Fletcher

*Jeffrey McKay during his co-starring days as Magnum's gullible Navy buddy(Mac Reynolds)

*Noble Willingham in the ""Natural Born"" episode before his co-starring days on the police drama WALKER TEXAS RANGER

*Martin Milner in the ""Severance Pay"" episode after his co-starring days on ADAM-12

*David Graf in the ""Sweet Britches"" episode during his co-starring days in the POLICE ACAMEDY flicks

*Arte Johnson in the ""Severance Pay"" episode after his co-starring days on the GONG SHOW

I also couldn't help finding it intriguing how Jared Martin and Joseph Ruskin not only both guest starred in the ""Santini's Millions"" episode of AIRWOLF, but they coincidentally also happened to both guest star in the ""Knight Of The Drones"" episode of KNIGHT RIDER that same season.

Therefore, we used to be able to watch Super-Autos every weekend back in the Winter of '85 since ABC had STREET HAWK on Friday nights at 9PM, CBS had AIRWOLF on Saturday nights at 9PM, and NBC had KNIGHT RIDER on Sunday nights at 8PM which all coincidentally just happened to be Universal owned TV shows that were all filmed at Universal Studios in Hollywood on top of that even though the supercar series KNIGHT RIDER, this superchopper series AIRWOLF, & the short-lived supercycle series STREET HAWK were all in competition with one another & despite the fact that STREET HAWK had stole a lot of viewers away from AIRWOLF & KNIGHT RIDER, but then STREET HAWK hit a speed-bump after only 9 weeks since it didn't get the ratings ABC wanted which was probably due to the fact that STREET HAWK was too closely related to KNIGHT RIDER & AIRWOLF since it gave viewers too much of the same thing every week, giving us too much competition, & redundancy since they all premiered too soon after one another on top of that since KNIGHT RIDER debuted on NBC in the Fall of 1982, AIRWOLF debuted on CBS in the Winter of 1984, and then lastly STREET HAWK debuted on ABC in the Winter of 1985, but had tanked & cancelled in the Spring of 1985 with no 2nd Season underway.

This season also reminds me of the days when CBS's motto was ""CBS: We've Got The Touch"", since that was their slogan on CBS from September of 1983 thru August of 1986. The only problem I have with this AIRWOLF-SEASON 2 DVD is for some reason it freezes and skips on the ""Santinis Millions"" episode and the episodes didn't come with a brief summary of each episode displaying their original air-dates unlike the AIRWOLF-SEASON 1 DVD.

For instance, the original air-dates to each of these 1984-1985 Season episodes on CBS was
9/22/84-SWEET BRITCHES
9/29/84-FIRESTORM
10/6/84-MOFFET'S GHOST
10/13/84-THE TRUTH ABOUT HOLLY

By the way, I just got word that the Shout Factory will be releasing short-lived STREET HAWK out on DVD on Tuesday July 13th, 2010 which should give all you high-tech TV program viewers something else to look forward to.",1201132800,5,5611,5.1326754385964914
2662580,3,B000IONJI8,"At the start of this season I was really getting into this show. The stories seemed to really start the season off with a bang, and kept you going for at least 5-10 episodes, and then something happened. In my opinion they dropped the ball. The season started off well, and then took a dip, and kind of went back to the boring style of episodes like in season 1. I find it really hard to sit through some of these episodes. (The American Dream is a good example of a really boring episode.)

The only episode I remember being decent from around the middle of the season is Santini's Millions, and then it takes another kind of nosedive. I heard the reason they changed mid season like this is because they wanted to present the show in a more hip fashion, kind of like Knight Rider, so they changed the direction of the show. I always preferred the episodes that focus on things that happen in the U.S., rather than the boring episodes that take place in other countries. I realize it's a military type show, and all that, but I think the stories are more relatable on american soil. Like the first episode of season 2. It is nothing short of amazing.

Since the first half of the season was so great, I give it a 3 out of 5 because it is better than season 1, but not quite a solid season by any means. Too much of a roller coaster ride in terms of episode quality, and the writing.",1196294400,4,1383,4.254752851711027
2662581,4,B000IONJI8,"i gave it a 4 out of 5 cause it's still has cheesy lines in it. the acting is getting better too, they're not so stiff anymore. still excellent helicopter action.",1184544000,,162,4.258064516129032
2662592,4,B000IONJI8,"If you like Season One Set, you must add Season Two Set.  It has 2 of my favorite episodes: Moffett's Ghost and HX-1. We see Airwolf out of control, then pitted against another equally advanced helicopter. There were some interesting background story lines about the Hawke and Dominic, but they were never expanded upon...

Season Three Set is just around the corner to complete the collection.",1178928000,,394,4.954545454545454
2662593,4,B000IONJI8,"Airwolf may have seemed like a show about a miltary helicopter who could do anything. Piloted by Stringfellow Hawke (Jan Micheal Vincent-in his finest acting hours) and Dominic Santini (Ernest Borgnine), this helicopter saga had a human touch.

This second season Airwolf came into its own. The first season defined the character and the copter. The second season had great character storylines, which was less on hardware and more of emotional software

These 22 episodes were intelligent well done TV..I can wait for season three which comes out soon

Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD",1176681600,11,581,5.293478260869565
2662594,5,B000IONJI8,The second season is better than the first airwolf fans. The show goes into more repair work on airwolf. Satini is more comfortable with inflight systems. Kati<jean scott> is a good third party member. Worth the money for fans.,1175817600,6,227,4.846153846153846
2662595,5,B000IONJI8,"Airwolf was a great series even though it stretched our technology back in those days.  I always enjoyed the action scenes and the capabilities of the Airwolf especially now as you compare them to today's rotating wing aircraft.  If you like action and Special Ops Think-tank ideas, you will enjoy this series.",1173571200,5,310,4.9423076923076925
2662596,3,B000IONJI8,"And it's not quite as good as season one.  But that's okay, it's still a worthwhile addition to an Airwolf fan's collection.  The overall quality has its moments but isn't up to the level of the first set of episodes.  Marella was taken out, only recurring in the rare guest appearance, which was too bad, since she was a great character and knew as much about Airwolf as anyone involved.  Caitlin O'Shaughnessy was a fine addition, nice and spunky, well-played by Jean Bruce Scott.  Archangel's character suffered, acting less like a suavely pleasant yet potentially dangerous spy with ambiguous loyalties and more like an ineffectual whiner.  Worst was the change in String's character from wounded loner with a fear of romantic entanglements to a man-about-town with plenty of female action.

One positive note was there was a fair amount of emphasis on the story arc involving St. John Hawke when there wasn't undue focus on human interest plots. (Blame the network for interfering with Bellisario's vision for his show.) And though there were groaners like Out Of The Sky(a country singer's hubby is out to get her---who cares?), there were also great episodes, such as Moffett's Ghost, where the evil inventor of Airwolf returns as a computer virus trying to destroy his creation so nobody else gets to use it.

Overall, though not as good as the first season, this DVD is a must for those interested in having the entire series done by CBS.  It does include the introduction of Caitlin's character and there's more St. John stories than the first go-round.  We recommend this as a slightly flawed but still essential part of the phenomenon that was Airwolf, and a great trip back to the best part of 80's TV.

The episodes are Sweet Britches, Firestorm, Moffet's Ghost, The Truth About Holly, The Hunted, Sins of the Past, Fallen Angel, HX-1, Flight #093 Is Missing, Once A Hero, Random Target, Condemned, The American Dream, Inn at the End of the Road, Santini's Millions, Prisoner of Yesterday, Natural Born, Out of the Sky, Dambreakers, Severance Pay, Eruption, and Short Walk to Freedom.  (There are a good deal more than the first season, since this is a full as opposed to a half-season.)",1172361600,10,2201,4.871313672922252

2662599,5,B000IONJI8,i recommend this dvd boxset for any fan of airwolf or the 80s it has some of the best episodes from airwolf's 4 year run. More better is to come with the hopefull release of season 3 on dvd,1169596800,2,189,3.871794871794872

They hardly make TV shows like this anymore??",1169164800,,179,4.933333333333334
2662601,5,B000IONJI8,"Airwolf roars back for its second season with 22 episodes.  They did a little better this time around on the DVDs, adding the title theme to the main DVD title page.  Still, it would have been nice to have had some commentaries by the writers/directors/actors.  Or at least to have had the episodes digitally remastered as so many programs are having done now days.

Airwolf was one of the great programs I enjoyed growing up and ended tragically short because of Jan-Michael Vincent's drinking problem.  I wish they had picked another actor, or been more stringent on getting him help.  At any rate, Ernest Borgnine's portrayl of Dom Santini is first rate, and still makes me laugh to this day.",1169078400,8,695,4.75
2662612,4,B000IONJI8,"""Airwolf"" is high flying action that stands the test of time. If you are into other series from the 80's like ""A-Team"" and ""Magnum P. I."", then you will like this one. Actors are great, and the helicopter is ""cool, fantastic, etc."" Good adventure and action for the whole family.",1168300800,,279,4.6
2662613,5,B000IONJI8,"First off, I want to assure everyone out there that this is not going to be a review so much, more like an ""Airwolf Editorial"". I think that I can speak for many people when I say that this show was one of, if not, THE show that us late 20s / early 30s types miss the most from the 1980s. It was THE show that used the ""Super Vehicle"" concept (calm down, all you Knight Rider fanboys out there, I know that this show was two years after K.R., but Jan-Michael Vincent vs. ""The Hoff""? Airwolf vs. K.I.T.T.? Please...) This show, unlike most of the other 1980s swill that appealed to me when I was in grade school, STILL appeals to me. Granted, there are continuity errors, military aircraft and vehicles are sometimes named incorrectly, the sometimes cheesy acting and plots, and the dated Cold War mentality. If you strip all the bad stuff away, you are still left with a show that was casted more or less very well (Ernest Borgnine RULES!!! He was the ultimate buddy / father figure that has yet to be topped in ANY show), GREAT flying footage, and a KILLER soundtrack. Hey, I'm 30 years old, but when I hear the synth-driven title score, I still grin like I did back in '84. Watching the show now evokes an odd mix on nostalgia and the grim knowledge of what happened to two of the main stars. J.M. Vincent faded into obscurity fueled by alcoholism, and the chopper later crashed and killed her entire crew in the early 1990's. I could go on and on, but I'm sure that between my thoughts and the thoughts and reviews of others here on Amazon, those who know nothing on Airwolf will have a very clear picture of what this show was all about. BTW, Donald Dube, Battlestar Galactica was produced by Glen A. Larson in the 1970s. Also, if any suits from Universal are reading this, DO NOT wait almost two years before releasing Season 3!!!

""Dom, give me turbos!"" - Stringfellow Hawke

""(Fill in the blank), String!"" - Dominic Santini

""RRROOOAAARRR!"" - Airwolf (when turbos are engaged)

Yeah, I'm a geek :)",1167177600,33,2004,4.452316076294278
2662614,5,B000IONJI8,"I hear so many people say 80s television was nothing but junk. Especially when talking about sitcoms this is true... full of beautiful people thin stories, and cars exploding at the drop of a hat.

There are some exceptions!

1> Stingray

2> Miami Vice

3> Airwolf

On the surface, Airwolf was a rip-off of BLUE THUNDER. With a few changes... They hired above average actors, spent GOOD money altering an actual helicopter (Bell 222, adding a second door, and the fake weapons)... and all the weapons that I remember the copter having were believable.

The thing I liked most about the series was the characters. Even in the pilot, the copter was shown very little, the people were most important.

Hawke had an almost empathic understanding of the `copter, he just didn't trust people.

Santini was probably as good as Hawke, when he was younger. Now he is Hawke's only friend, and father figure.

Archangel couldn't be trusted in or out of your sight. I liked his character because you never knew what he was going to do... or if this was the day he would try to stab the heroes in the back.

The copter wasn't a gimmick to get people to watch the program like the other advanced-hardware programs (KNIGHT RIDER, STREET HAWK, BLUE THUNDER, VIPER). All these programs ended because people got bored with the gimmick... KNIGHT RIDER lasted a bit longer than the others because they kept changing the beautiful mechanic that would fix the car. AIRWOLF ended because one of the stars had a personal issue that was wrecking the shooting schedule.

The only place where I think the show is lacking is the aerial combat. Even in the early 80s, it was too expensive to do good model shots, so most of the time they reused old footage of airplanes/copters exploding. Seeing the same shot over and over is one of the things that killed another Bellisario production BATTLESTAR GALACTICA.",1166918400,9,1879,4.733128834355829
2662615,5,B000IONJI8,"I agree there should've been more of Mr. Borgnine on Airwolf.  But to clear up an urban legend run amok, he's very much alive as of December 16, 2006.",1166227200,5,150,4.172413793103448

2662617,5,B000IONJI8,"While it's true Jan Michael Vincent's alcohol addiction killed this show, it was still fun to watch while it lasted.  The second season Episode 'Fallen Angel', written by guest-star and later Belasarius' wife Debra Pratt was a gem, involving a plausible cold-war plot-line, cool gunship sequences and some laugh-out-loud humor.  The most amazing thing (to me) is the entire episode was shot on the Universal Back-Lot yet it does a pretty good job of convincing they actually went to East Germany.",1164758400,6,496,5.111111111111111
2662618,3,B000IONJI8,"Solid characters but never too deep. As this show does not bear close examination. But that is okay. It is not supposed to.

I am no scholar of military aircraft but the fanciful notion of a supersonic helicopter with a range of several thousand miles, a ceiling of sixty or seventy thousand feet, armor that is nearly invulnerable to machine gun fire, the ability to turn on a dime do immelmans and overhead loops, not to mention the incredible stealth capabilities, stretches disbelief enough but it all falls apart for the slipshod and inconsistent writing regarding the helicopter's armanents.

I don't know how long the Airforce has been using the AIM-120 AMRAAM but flares have no effect on it as AMRAAM stands for ""Advanced Medium Range Air to Air Missle"" and it is radar guided not heat seeking. Sidewinder air to air missles were improved to all aspect heat seeking capability meaning they ignore flares from all but perhaps a forty five degrees field of fire. If you got a sidewinder on your six the chances of a flare diverting it were vastly reduced.

""Hellfires"" are air to ground anti armor weapons. ""Mavericks"", the AGM-65D or whatever the current version is if they are still in use are also guided air to ground missles. Both of these were regularly written as air to air ordinance.

Of course the scripts would not have been nearly as interesting if writers were constrained in such a manner.

Some of the best and most interesting stories were the ones involving the intelligence operative known as code name ""Archangel"", aka Michael Coldsmith Briggs III who always appeared in his trademark all white suit, and was played with such style and panache by actor Alex Cord.",1162598400,3,1689,4.810344827586207
2662619,5,B000IONJI8,"Finally, Its coming !!!! Ever since the release of Season 1, I was eagerly expecting Season 2 to come out in the next 6 months to a year, but to take nearly 2 years to release Airwolf - Season 2, it is ridiculous !!!! I'm sure that Universal should release Seasons 3 and 4 on DVD very soon.

Airwolf was the most technologically brilliant show of all time - and it was truly ahead of its time. A fast, black, Mach 1.1+ attack helicopter with retractable chain guns, hell fires, turbo thrusters, infra-red imaging, etc. would be an incredible addition to U.S. military. The flying Airwolf helicopter was in actuality a Bell 222 or a Bell 222B. A retractable rocket launcher, known as the ""ADF Pod"" (ADF standing for All Directional Firing, as the pod could rotate 360 degrees to fire at targets at the sides and rear of the copter) on its belly. It is a show that when you watch it, you think to yourself, why didn't the U.S. military build such attack helicopters in large numbers. It is an awesome show to watch.

Even now, I'm excited at the thought of purchasing Airwolf - Season 2. I recommend this show for anyone looking for a great 80's Action TV series. I'll rate this DVD set 5 stars.",1162166400,4,1193,4.418181818181818
2662620,5,B000IONJI8,"WOW they finally released Airwolf Season 2 on DVD and yet what is strange is that other shows that were out during the 80's are well past Season 2 on DVD.

As another person said I'll sign a petition for season three. In fact we should get one going now and have them release season three and four as soon as possible.

If they were to ever make a movie about Airwolf they had better stick to the story line of the TV show insted of trying put their own silly ideas into the movie. Given that they were SO SLOW with the DVD release I would not be surprised if they release the movie in the 2125.",1160697600,4,595,4.033898305084746

The U.S. government realizes that this is another Firefox jet but now in the form of a helicopter which means we must have it before our enemies do. They send in Hawk and Santini, helicopter combat specialists, to steal the Airwolf. After gaining the ""superchopper"", Hawk hides it in a remote desert location to keep this lethal weapon out of ANY government's hands, including America's! However, Hawk agrees to fly missions for covert purposes for America. That is the basis of this loved series. Teens that watch this on other channels to this day get ""hooked""on this show!
