8739861,4,B017NE757G,"Titli is a sad portrayal of the times that we are living in and a stark description of the people who have not been blessed by the economic mobility in the developing world.
Love Sex aur Dhoka can easily be counted as one of the best films in the last decade, the co writer of the film Kanu Behl gets his chance to direct this film and he takes us to Delhi and introduces to a family of car jackers.

Titli which means Butterfly is the  name of  youngest of  three brothers, who wants to escape the miserable existence that he has with his brothers and dad. He plans to buy a parking space in a new shopping mall. However the booming real estate derail his plans as the price of real estate has gone up. He tries to borrow it from his brother, the crazy and hot headed Vikram.
These crazy brothers are in the business of crime, and they keep on doing things that are revolting such as making Titli marry to a girl of their choice even if he does not want to...but the movie is about dreams and escape which is surrounded hopelessness, pain and squalor.
There is a scene in the film when Titli injects a numbing solution in his wife's arm because he plans to break it so that she wouldn't be able to sign on some important papers. The direction is so good that I was forced to cover my eyes.
An important debut for Kanu Behl, a director to watch out for.

Titli is a young man stuck in the shadows of his chaotic, domineering family. His older brothers make their living through violence and deceit, and Titli finds himself following helplessly in their footsteps to keep the family together, even as he dreams of owning a business and leading an honest life. When Titli's brothers marry him to an obviously depressed young woman in hope of bettering their fortunes, the reluctant newlyweds begin to hatch a plan to escape and go their separate ways. But as unexpected twists and turns complicate their plans, Titli finds himself using the same lies and force he abhors in his family - and leaves him wondering whether the ends justify the means, and what it really means to do the right and honest thing,",1457740800,2,832,4.818181818181818
