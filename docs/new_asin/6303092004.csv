567254,5,6303092004,Ann Blyth & Edmund Purdom they are fantastic together . I love these type of love stories i can watch them over & over again.,1364774400,,125,4.04
567255,5,6303092004,"Adventure and love, want more do you want.  Excellent movie, and great acting.  Both male and female roles require strong performances by the actors, and it was achieved in the movie.",1364083200,,183,4.870967741935484
567256,5,6303092004,"I saw this excellent movie there is a good fifty years with a first-rate cast, including Edmund Purdom I knew personally. I regret that Europe DVD in French is not distributed as a lot of other published among others by Warner, especially in his collection ""Warner Archive Collection"". While many Europeans have mastered the English language, unfortunately there are many others who do not have this privilege, also young people who have not yet learned this wonderful language. I think Warner catalog so prestigious, but other majors should make an effort since there is still great potential in French.",1362960000,,604,5.111111111111111
567257,3,6303092004,"Edmund Purdom and Ann Blyth appeared together once before in The Student Prince - a beautiful love story between a Prince and a bar-maid - with great singing by Ann and the dubbed voice of Mario Lanza; this time out, although not as enchanting a love story, at least this one has a happy ending!  Good supporting cast with David Niven as the properly evil villain, and George Sanders as a strangely un-absorbed King Charles 11. Lots of action and sword-play to keep us entertained.",1353024000,8,481,4.658823529411765
567258,5,6303092004,"""The King's Thief"" does not seem to be a very well known period piece, and watching it, it is indeed a puzzler. The cast is fine in a lavish production by MGM having to do with court intrigues at the time of England's King Charles II, and the direction goes at a brisk pace in its very brief  78 minute duration. Edmund Purdom in the title role is less wooden than usual, Ann Blyth is gorgeous, as usual, and, unexpectedly, David Niven relishes his turn as villain without any hammy acting from this very classy player. The CinemaScope print is very good and so is the Stereo sound. You will have a ball if you love costumers, all things Cinemascope, and the kind of fun swashbucklers they don't make anymore.",1352851200,17,709,4.453846153846154
567259,5,6303092004,"I was unaware of ""The King's Thief"" until seeing it as an Amazon recommendation when I purchased ""Swordsman of Siena"".  It looked like it was right up my alley, since I'm a fancier of good swashbucklers, so I gave it a try.  I love it!

The author of ""Swordsmen of the Screen"" was critical of the casting of Edmund Purdom and David Niven as the hero and villain, respectively, but I disagree.  I think both are splendid in their roles.  The plot concerns the Duke of Brampton (Niven), trusted adviser of King Charles II (George Sanders), who is in fact plotting the King's overthrow by removing his loyal nobles one by one.  Charles II unwittingly colludes in his own undoing by placing sole and implicit trust in the Duke of Brampton.  The duke has a little book detailing the nobles he is falsely convicting of treason and dispatching, and this book falls into the hands of a former soldier turned thief, Michael Dermott (Purdum).  A very exciting and involved plot follows, full of action (including two rapier duels), a daring prison escape, some romance (unfortunately, the most implausible aspect of the story), and humor.

This is an excellent swashbuckler and a fine film altogether.  All the actors acquit themselves admirably, the score is rousing, the costumes gorgeous, and the story and action are well executed.  I strongly recommend ""The King's Thief"" for swashbuckler and classic movie fans.",1350777600,4,1407,4.894514767932489

567414,5,6303092004,"Loved, loved, loved the movie.  I loved the story line, the actors were excellent, loved the excitement ... just everything about it.  The black and white dogs used in the scene with the King were absolutely adorable.  Does anyone know what kind of dog they were?",1404345600,,263,4.673913043478261
567415,4,6303092004,"I had never seen (or even heard of this movie) until I read its reviews.  I ordered it and wasn't disappointed. There were a few scenes and actions parts that I've not seen in any other movies.  An interesting plot and acting was well done. The last time I saw Edmund Perdom was in the movie ""The Egyptian"". This is a different character portrayal. David Niven, George Sanders and even a young Roger Moore round out a full cats of stars.",1402790400,5,437,4.382716049382716
567416,5,6303092004,"THE KING'S THIEF TAKES THE VIEWER BACK WHEN MGM MADE GREAT ADVENTURE MOVIES.  THE CAST IS AT ITS BEST.
ANN BLYTH, DAVID NIVEN AND EDMUND PURDOM ARE WELL CAST.  THIS IS BIG BUDGET MGM.  NO EXPENSE SPARED. GREAT FUN HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1398038400,5,233,4.634146341463414
567417,5,6303092004,"This is a fabulous transfer! The picture is clear and the colours are very vibrant! The audio is very crisp and the film is presented in the original widescreen instead of the pan-and-scan of the old VHS tape. The film is along the lines of ""The Three Muskateers"" and is a fabulous adventure film!",1391990400,7,297,4.518518518518518

567420,5,6303092004,"Period pieces, pretty people, great costumes. Great when TV is awful (which is often.) I especially like Anne Blyth. She's one of the few of that generation who is still alive.",1375660800,,176,4.709677419354839

7838438,3,6303092004,"Typical MGM glamor film with a somewhat silly plot.  David Niven looks embarrassed, but Ann Blyth is radiant.  Fun to get a look at the young Roger Moore pre-Bond!",1506988800,,163,4.586206896551724
7838439,3,6303092004,Costume drama by folks beyond their prime with well-worn production values and overly saturated technicolor to make you think it has greater substance than it actually does. Fans will be pleased enough. Casual viewers will find it lacking I'm afraid. Definitely a product of its era.,1499385600,,283,5.173913043478261

7838443,1,6303092004,"Really, really bad.  I was looking for an old film which I later found out was called The Highwayman staring Wanda Hendrix and Phillip Friend,, and I ordered this one thinking it might be the one I was looking for. It wasn't, and I have been disappointed to find that The Highwayman is basically unavailable and not even in either actor's list of films.  Wonder what that is all about?",1459123200,,385,4.485714285714286
7838444,5,6303092004,"Based on historical fact, although I can not attest to its accuracy Hollywood has never been known to let the facts get in the way of a good story.  Even when the facts may be a better story!  But I can say that I am very pleased to add this movie to my collection.  I love history & anything sword related & this movie has it all !!!  Set in the post Cromwell era under the reign of King Charles the 2cnd this movie is full of court intrigue, romance & enough Swashbuckling to satisfy lovers of sword play like myself.  Filled with stunning color & opulent costumes & set designs & great acting by all casted in this film. With stars like Ann Blyth, David Niven , George Sanders, & a very young Roger Moore you would expect good acting & Edmund Purdum doe's more than hold his own he shines playing the infamous highwayman Michael Dermott!!!  I don't like to go into great detail about the storyline & spoil the movie, but I will say this movie is very entertaining on all levels!  As far as the product itself it comes in a very sturdy case & the picture & sound quality are great!!!  I even commented to my wife how the bright vivid colors are superior to most modern movies!!!  Yes I am very happy to add this awesome adventure movie to my collection & very surprised I have never seen it before.",1458345600,6,1300,4.252032520325203
