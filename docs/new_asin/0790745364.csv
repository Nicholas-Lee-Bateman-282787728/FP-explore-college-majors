Regarding wrong RC. I received my copy last Friday and checked  it out today. Short 6 can be played on our DVD players in Europe. So I hope  Amazon changes the region code ASAP.",941500800,4,336,3.985074626865672

Franky Goes to Hollywood  is the funniest thing I've seen since I don't even know JUST FLAT OUT  FUNNY. Keep it up guys I love what your doing!
