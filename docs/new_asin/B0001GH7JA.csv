8012188,4,B0001GH7JA,Classic euro trash camp: People moving their mouths out of sync with words...check.  Lots of interesting visuals from another time period...check.  Tantalizing plot with occasional nudity...check.  Worth every penny. Caroll Baker (Babydoll) is the mysterious 'Baba Yaga' and George Eastman is such a hottie! Delizioso!  Weird alert for this great Italian film is the dominatrix doll...huh? And the spell placed on Valentina's camera. Just pure fun with film.,1232496000,,458,5.6911764705882355
8012189,4,B0001GH7JA,"This review refers to the St Clair Vision release of ""Kiss Me Kill Me""....
Valentina is a successful Italian fashion photographer who walking home one night after a party comes upon a helpless dog in the street surrounded by candles and with a curious marking on its forehead.
Within moments a long black car pulls up and as an eerie piano piece is heard on the soundtrack, out from the car steps a woman dressed all in black and speaks with the photographer.
Valentina, shaken by the dog and this mysterious woman agrees to be driven home by her.
But Valentina continues to feel uneasy as the woman states that their meeting was ""preordained"".
Arriving at Valentina's home the woman turns to her and says ""Don't forget my name. My name is Baba Yaga"".  The name Baba Yaga means witch in Russian folklore.
And forget her name she will not for Valentina is haunted that very night by a nightmare wherein she dreams she is held captive by several Nazi soldiers one of whom cradles a cat in his arms and instructs the ones holding Valentina to lead her to a black hole in the ground and just as she is about to be dropped in she wakes up.
The next day Valentina is back to work shooting a model but someone is at the door. Valentina has an unsettling sixth sense it is the strange woman she met the night before. And it is. Baba Yaga comes in and invites Valentina to her home. Valentina notices the woman caressing her camera in a curious fashion and is asked for a personal piece of clothing which she takes for herself, reaching up Valentina's leg to snap off a garter hook which she toyingly brings to her lips.
The next day, after a disturbing incident involving Valentina's camera and a model she is shooting, Valentina reluctantly pays Baba Yaga a call at her home. It is a very spooky house that Valentina finds herself approaching-shuttered windows, tall gate and walls,  and once inside finds Baba Yaga sitting in the dark in her rocking chair stroking the cat in her arms-just as the foreboding Nazi had done in her nightmare.
Baba Yaga encourages Valentina to walk freely about the old home with her camera to photograph whatever she would like and it is then that Valentina discovers a deep dark hole right in the middle of the floor-also just like in her dream. The ticking clock on the wall has no hands on its face.
Up in the attic Valentina sees a doll and is overcome with another strange erotic dream/spell that is broken when Baba Yaga reaches the attic. The doll is given to Valentina and is told to always keep it nearby.
From this point on the movie continues its suspenceful path with which I do not want to completely give away.
But I must mention the excellent music throughout the film and the chilling performance of Carroll Baker.",1197331200,2,2755,4.519038076152305
8012190,1,B0001GH7JA,"If you are looking for Kiss Me Kill Me with Stella Stevens and Bruce Boxleitner, this is NOT IT.  Both Blockbuster and Amazon have the wrong cast for this movie version.  This KMKM is an Italian Fetish movie, not exactly what I was looking for.  The KMKM version starring Boxleitner and Stevens has never been made into a retail version.",1135209600,2,337,4.583333333333333

8012192,2,B0001GH7JA,"Unlike most Italian horror movies of the seventies which were notorious for some of their almost incomprehensible plot lines, this movie has a plot you could connect with the dots.  This is not necessarilly saying a bad thing, but in this film's case, a simplistic plot of a lesbian witch trying to control a young woman via a doll and a cursed camera needed some bolstering through either some inspired acting or some kickbutt special effects.  Sadly the dearth of both is painfully obvious in this film.  To give Corrado Farina his due, however, his witch movie anticipated Argento's brilliant Suspiria by more than five years.  Some of the same elements are in this film:  creepy dream sequences, almost psychedelic flashbacks (and flashforwards!) and some inspired lighting in Baba Yaga's house.  Isabelle De Funes is passable as Valentina, a player who is played by someone more expert-the lesbian witch, Baba Yaga.  Lose the close-ups on her doe eyes, and keep her clothes on and I have to wonder how magnetic she still wouldn't have been.  The hero, Arno, is so stereotypically macho that you will pray for his death half-way through the movie.  The witch, played by Caroll Baker, could have stood for more fleshing out.  Surely, keeping a dominatrix doll, cursing a camera, and concealing a gateway to hell on the first floor of your home begs a little insight into some motivation!  Much of this problem may be due to the editing of the version I saw, which may have rendered parts of the film nearly nonsensical; like, for instance, why Baba Yaga is even bothering to waste her time on Valentina at all-it isn't for sexual reasons.  The strengths of the movie are in Corrado Farina's frenzied direction.  His blend of dream sequences, flashbacks and flashforwards (not to mention a very catchy title sequence!) Is the true reason to ride this movie out until the end.",1053216000,2,1877,4.846394984326019
8012193,4,B0001GH7JA,"Italian horror movies invariably seem to have a special look, sound, and feeling of baroque creepiness that make them successful. I'm not so sure that Kiss Me, Kill Me (aka Baba Yaga, aka The Devil Witch aka Black Magic) is really that great of a movie, but its dark atmosphere makes it satisfyingly effective. Based to some degree on a dark comic strip, the movie's noticeably surreal quality is greatly enhanced by a haunting musical score as well as the use of grainy black and white pictures of events unfolding at certain critical times. Isabelle De Funes plays Valentina Rosselli, a photographer living in Milan. On her way home one night, she encounters a very strange lady who calls herself Baba Yaga (played by Carroll Baker). This stranger tells Valentina their meeting was predestined, and she quickly insinuates herself into the life of our protagonist. Baba Yaga, we quickly learn, is some type of witch, and she certainly looks the part in costume as well as appearance; her pasty complexion and almost-white eyebrows standing out in contrast to her red lipstick-coated mouth does make quite an impression. Valentina tries to go about her work, which involves photographing semi-nude women, but Baba Yaga gradually puts her under her spell. She has strange dreams; quite unusual things begin to happen when she takes pictures with a camera that Baba Yaga has fondled; a strange doll Baba Yaga gives her begins to seem like something more than a normal doll. The tension and suspense is carried along quite nicely throughout, but the conclusion falls a little short of making this film an unqualified success.
This is a movie best suited for adults because it does contain a fair bit of nudity, but the sex, violence, and gore is actually rather limited. Gory and erotic are not words I would use to characterize this film at all. In fact, there is essentially no blood to speak of, and the one scene of violence is not as extreme as it might first appear. Kiss Me, Kill Me generates its horror from the atmosphere it creates, and in this endeavor it is largely successful. In one very nice scene, Valentina watches an old silent movie about a golem, but the golem connection to the doll Valentina is given may be lost on some viewers lacking a foundation in old-fashioned horror. Still, though, the doll in and of itself is creepy enough to be effective. If you don't have an interest in horror at all, there is a good chance you won't enjoy Kiss Me, Kill Me. For horror aficionados, the movie stands ready to help meet your daily requirement of creepiness, but your rations of blood and gore must be obtained elsewhere.",1049846400,3,2634,4.7785087719298245
8012194,4,B0001GH7JA,"A somewhat strange offering that is based on folklore and erotic Italian comic books, Kiss Me, Kill Me is a first rate film set in modern Milan.
Baba Yaga (played wonderfully by Caroll Baker) is a witch who tries to seduce and control a beautiful photographer, Isabelle De Funs (Valentina Rosselli). There is a love interest for Isabelle, Arno Treves (George Eastman), who also acts as a hero in the appropriate parts. Also involved is a doll that seems to sometimes be human, and who happens to be clad in leather and ready made for bondage and s&m sessions.
Isabelle meets Baba Yaga one evening on the street and is invited to Baba Yaga's house sometime. She takes her up on the offer and discovers in the house a hole in the floor that seems to have no bottom. Baba Yaga gives Isabelle a doll that she says will protect her. Baba has also fondled a camera belonging to Isabelle which then seems to cause bad things to happen whenever someone is photographed with it.
Throughout the movie Isabelle has dreams that are filled with eroticism and violence. A lot of these dreams are shown in very grainy film or as a set of grainy stills. Pretty effective camerawork all through the movie and the sets, acting and dialogue are better than average. The are a lot of [body parts] in the movie and also a whipping scene. Very little blood and no gore.
The dvd version released by Diamond Entertainment is bottom of the barrel, but the price is cheap enough at [money] that it makes buying the movie worth it. I read at one review website that the movie would be released in early 2003 by synapse films with a few minutes of added footage and hopefully a better transfer, but they do not mention it at the synapse website. I'm glad I own it and I would definitely recommend this as an interesting addition to any horror dvd collection",1034812800,,1829,4.5120481927710845
8012195,3,B0001GH7JA,"This is hardly a priceless advice, since this DVD seems to be out of print. However, I suggest not buying this edition and go for the deluxe edition by Blue Underground<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Baba-Yaga/dp/B000092T66/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Baba Yaga</a>. Just so you know, this film is actually Corrado Farina's cult ""Baba Yaga"". I've seen this copy and you shouldn't trust it, as it's literally mistake-packed edition. Umberto Lenzi has NOTHING to do with this film, the aspect ratio is not respected (the film is horribly maimed by pan&scan). The Blue Underground edition features  juicy extras such as the never-before-seen scenes originally cut from Italian censorship, plus about 10 minutes of stuff cut prior to first release (featuring Italian popstar Franco Battiato!) a lenghty interview with Farina himself, a vintage documentary by Farina on Guido Crepax (the author of the comic book on which the film is based) and even an easter egg with Tinto Brass. And the screen ratio is respected.",1032480000,9,1048,5.67515923566879
8012196,5,B0001GH7JA,"This is a very fine Italian Giallo (Stylistic Crime Hottot) with a artistic bent. Bottomless pits to hell, domonmeatrix dolls, and a cursed cameria. I especially recommend this one to people who are blood shy. Unlike most films of this gengre it it is virtually blood and gore free. The quality of most Diamond DVD's is also pretty good. This one is no exception.",1018742400,,363,4.6875
