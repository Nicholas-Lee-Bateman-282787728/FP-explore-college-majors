To most folks these are just old black & white movies.  But, they are incredibly great movies. If you watch these movies the theme in all of them is the little guy against the establishment.  The little guy always wins. Here's where some great actors got their start and later moved to be Hollywood stars. You will need an All Regions DVD player - which I bought on Amazon (love Amazon!), get one and it opens up foreign films with great scripts, true life situations and whole genre of film that you miss. There are two DVD sets and they have some great not to miss movies. I had two of the moveis already in this set, but it's worth every penny.",1363996800,,778,4.358620689655172
