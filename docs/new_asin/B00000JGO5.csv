8250756,4,B00000JGO5,"I loved watching Toonsylvania after Animaniacs when I was a kid.  It was so wrong, but so funny.  I even watched it and laughed as a college student.  I laugh now as I watch with my own kids.  (Okay, only my 10 year old really gets the humor, but it's fun to laugh together.)  I wish, wish, wish they would reissue this on DVD because after all these years not only do we not regularly have a VCR connected to a TV, the tape I've owned since the early '90s is pretty worn out.  I hate to buy another VHS because of the VCR issue, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed for DVD...  Or streaming! Streaming would be GREAT!",1380758400,2,615,4.117647058823529

8250758,5,B00000JGO5,"lend an ear (or an arm or any body part for that matter) for this hellishly hilarious ""toonsylvania"" movie which is comprised of episodes from the FOX cartoon show. Join Dr. Vic, his assistant Igor and  the monster Phil in several shorts featuring gastrolintestinal  cannibalistic babies, werewolfing grandmas and much muck more.  The best  ""parts"" are the segments featuring that loveable zobie family  ""the Deadmans"", Deadger, Stiffany, Ashly, Fred and his stuffed  dog will kill you with their zombie antics!  anybody for a big bowl of  maggot-ronie?",960940800,7,553,5.275862068965517
