8522037,5,B007USWD1E,"I absolutely loved these workouts when I had them on VHS years ago and I was so happy to find it here on DVD! I've done other upper and lower body workouts and while I feel sore, I never feel as sore as I did the day after doing this workout! 3 days later and I'm still in pain . . . but a good pain. Kathy Smith knows her stuff and her classic stuff is the best!",1493856000,,363,3.6666666666666665
8522038,5,B007USWD1E,"Best balanced workout ever. Bought this to back up my last copy which I have been using for about 16 years.  Alternate between aerobics, upper body and lower body. Thanks to it, I am in great shape.",1469232000,2,198,4.351351351351352
8522039,5,B007USWD1E,I've gained weight.  I'm turning 60 in November.  Many of the exercises were popular in the 80's when I was in the best shape of my life!  I feel totallly comfortable with these excersises because they work!,1440201600,7,207,4.54054054054054
8522040,5,B007USWD1E,"I have the original VHS. I was so sad when my player died.  I was thinking of having them copied to a dvd when I found this.
Kathy will always be my first choice.",1439856000,4,162,3.764705882352941

8522042,5,B007USWD1E,Such a great deal that I had to take advantage of! I was looking for just one of the workouts to replace the VHS I once had & got two more with this great combo! Kathy Smith is one of the best video instructors & is great with her instructions. I will always recommend her workouts to others!,1421020800,3,292,4.051724137931035
8522043,5,B007USWD1E,Nicely done.  Even though I am in my mid sixties and out of shape I could still do the workout in the modified version.  Looking forward to doing the standard version in the future.,1418774400,2,181,4.294117647058823

8522046,1,B007USWD1E,"From what I can see, the DVD content is great.  I am a huge Kathy Smith fan, however I returned the first DVD and will do the same with the replacement as both read  ""skipping over damaged area"" when the disc is loading.  I have tried different DVD players and it still does not work.  Very disappointed.
Would love to skip the DVD altogether and stream to my Kindle.",1392681600,,367,4.27536231884058
