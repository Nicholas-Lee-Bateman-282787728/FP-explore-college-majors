Maybe the BEST of The Asylum,Or are they becoming better filmmakers or Am I drinking more ???
Muldoon does Sinbad (not the comedian,shh) well,But you would think the umpteeenth Grandson would still have that trademarked beard.
Svenson does hve some good scenes and finish,hint-hint.
The show stealer is Sarah Desage,Who steals all critics hearts ?
So,OF COURSE,She is married to director.
Creatures are really good,Crab-Whale-Cyclops-Flying serpents and we even starting cheering the re-acurring creature-SQUID !

4093699,2,B00396954O,"Adrian Sinbad (Patrick Muldoon) owns a shipping company among other things. While attempting to pay a ransom in the Indian Ocean, he get marooned on an island that is not an island and then an island that is an island. This island has an all male utopian society with fully automatic weapons but no football. Sinbad must perform seven poorly defined tasks to save the world and get the island babe (Sarah Desage) even though he is dating a supermodel and has an assistant with obscenely big ears (Kelly O'Leary).

This is an Asylum film, so don't expect too much. The movie was one continuous head scratch, WTF  adventure. Nothing made sense, but I imagine this would be the type of film I would have loved in my tween years.

4093700,4,B00396954O,"I remember many years ago watching the old 1958 Sinbad movie ""The 7th Voyage of Sinbad"". I have to be honest with you, I thought that was really chintzy and boring. The special effects were great and they're still great but I didn't like the acting at all. Sinbad being a swashbuckler was great but the whole premise at the time just didn't catch my eye at all.

Now, fastfoward to the 21st century and here you have The 7 Adventures of Sinbad!! With not only monsters but with guns too!! Now we're talking!!! Sure, this is an Asylum film and yes, this is a B movie, but so was the 1958 movie. Only difference is that it took a whole year to make a lot of the stop animation scenes just for that movie in 1958. With today's technology, you can bang out some pretty decent stuff within a week or so with the right software.

Personally, this was a strong release for Asylum and one of their better products. CGI wasn't that bad. Believe me, I have seen much worse (A la ""Megalodon"" bottom of the barrel CGI). Anyway, I thought the story had a very good flow and chemistry to it. I really liked it a lot. Just one complaint. I just wished that the cyclops had better detail to it but then again, when you have a deadline of 2 weeks, then ya gotta cut some corners!! The gun battles and fight scenes were really good to be honest with you!! My all time favorite scene was when Sinbad got mugged by a giant crab, lol!! Now that was classic!! The giant crab took his briefcase!! You don't see that every day now do ya??!!! It had a bunch of laughs for me and of course you can't take this too seriously but it is a fun movie!! I don't know about you but this was definitely worth my money!!

4093714,3,B00396954O,"I have been collecting all the Sinbad films. The major problems with this film is that it shouldn't have been set in the contemporary era. Sinbad belongs in the remote legendary past. It was poorly edited, much happened without explanation, and things happened without explanation. The lead actor, Patrick Muldoon, was wooden and passive when he should been more intense. Loa looked too much like a knockoff of Leela from Doctor Who, and was pretty useless in the film. However, it had its moments and was not as horrible as other reviewers have said elsewhere. I felt sorry for the death of the poor Cyclops. The worst part was the ending: a scene tacked on for no reason and no explanation. The special effects were poor, but frankly the special effects on the old Roger Corman films were even worse. I gave it three out of five stars, as I realized it was a poor film, yet I enjoyed parts of it.",1393545600,,898,4.549382716049383

4093716,2,B00396954O,"Here's a Sinbad clearly modeled after Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark; a wealthy corporate honcho, sans super armor suit, who finds himself lost on an island filled with giant creatures that really don't do much of anything.

Then, later, it turns into a kind of military rebel movie, with some unexciting pit fighting overseen by a Dan Haggerty-looking dude who appears to have been pulled out of a crack house and given a few lines to read.

The creatures really don't do much more than Harryhausen's did 50 years ago, which is to blink their eyes and growl a lot. But they are occasionally impressive, especially the flying dragon-type things that eat one guy but are apparently frightened away by sharpened sticks. However, the devilish monster protecting some mystical volcano stones looks like a heavy metal LP cover come to badly animated life.

Oh, and the stones: They hold the secret to escaping the island; which is to say, they can get really hot, for no apparent reason. So, Sinbad uses them to create steam and power a hot-air balloon and fly away. Why, I don't know, FIRE would have worked just as well demands a suspension of my disbelief this movie didn't work hard enough to accomplish.

The last third of the movie is so incomprehensible, it's quite likely it was written and directed by someone who spoke no English at all, and who was sniffing glue. It has something to do with a giant squid, Sinbad in a submarine, a bad guy clearly inspired by Jeff Bridges' villian in ""Iron Man,"" poorly rendered tornadoes, an earthquake scene the producers lifted from one of Asylum's dopey disaster movies, and, just for kicks and giggles, Armageddon.

Worth the couple of bucks I paid for it, for the few laughs I got at its expense. Only fools and Dan Haggerty would pay more.",1327104000,6,1786,4.711538461538462

4093719,3,B00396954O,"""The 7 Adventures of Sinbad"" is remarkably coherent, especially since it should make absolutely no sense.  The movie contains a rich scion, modern-day pirates, a hijacked oil-tanker, vaguely-relevant monsters, and ""Apocalypse Now"".  And ""The Abyss"".

The script moves along at a good pace, and the body count grows at a surprising rate.  The deaths of characters gives a small amount of realism to a far-fetched series of events.  The script does not make any great use of the Sinbad name and its potential --- it's just a way to fake out the Prince of Persia fans.  ""The Original Prince of Persia"", indeed.

The movie looks lush and exotic.  Some of the monsters, such as the crab and the whale, bring a sense of danger or awe.  Some, like the roc and cyclops, are more pedestrian.

I would have rated the movie higher than three stars if it had had more and better music, special effects, and camerawork.  Additionally, I did not feel a great emotional attachment to the characters.  Still, ""The 7 Adventures of Sinbad"" is an adventure that is better than most Asylum movies.",1284940800,4,1077,4.762162162162162
4093720,3,B00396954O,"One of my favorite fictional characters is the legendary Persian mariner, Sinbad the Sailor, from the Arabian Nights. Depending on when you ask me, 1974's THE GOLDEN VOYAGE OF SINBAD is likely to be among my top ten movies of all time, and I'm a big fan of most of the other cinematic voyages of the character as well. Hell, I even like the 90s syndicated TV show, and paid way too much to buy the Canadian DVDs.

So, when I found out that The Asylum planned their own Sinbad film, to ride the coattails of this summer's PRINCE OF PERSIA, I was interested. Admittedly, I was less interested when I discovered that they were making a contemporary, 21st Century version of the character, but I was still willing to give it a chance. I'm glad I did.

THE 7 ADVENTURES OF SINBAD (2010) introduces us to Adrian Sinbad (Patrick Muldoon, STARSHIP TROOPERS), the young CEO of a major shipping company. When one of the company's oil tankers is hijacked by pirates in the Indian Ocean, his partner Simon Magnusson (Bo Svenson, INGLORIOUS BASTARDS) sends him out to negotiate and pay off the hijackers. He arrives just in time to see a giant, tentacled creature drag the tanker beneath the sea before a storm crashes his helicopter. Soon, he washes up on the shore of a tropical island - along with a handful of survivors from his helicopter and the tanker - where a mysterious woman (lovely Sarah Desage) tells him that an ancient prophecy says that he must face seven trials and save the world. Then the island is revealed to be a gigantic monster.... and he's off.

Co-written and co-directed by Ben Hayflick & Adam Silver, THE 7 ADVENTURES OF SINBAD is definitely one of the better action fantasies to come out of The Asylum.

The filmmakers may have contemporized the story (including some uncomfortably timely stuff about crude oil spills) for budgetary reasons, but they clearly have an affection for the Ray Harryhausen classics of the 60s and 70s. The script is thin, but the performances are much better than usual for an Asylum picture, the Chris Ridenhour musical score is excellent, Mikey Jechort's cinematography is professional and slick, the Belize locations are lush and picturesque, and the CGI creatures are really quite decent - especially for (all together, now) an Asylum film.

The monsters - which include such classic critters as a giant crab, a cyclops, a kraken, a flock 'o rocs, etc. - may lack the personality and charm of Harryhausen's stop-motion beasties, but they're reasonably well-designed and animated, and much more detailed than I expected.

Muldoon, the latest in a line of very whitebread Sinbads, may lack charisma, but he acquits himself adequately in the lead, while Svenson seems to be a bit more animated than usual as Sinbad's treacherous partner. Sarah Desage is quite good, and makes for some sexy eye candy, as well.

The Asylum's DVD sports a fine 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen transfer, 5.1 Surround and 2.0 Digital audio options, a ""Making of"" featurette, deleted scenes, gag reel, and the usual Asylum trailers.

I was quite pleasantly surprised, and would rate this among the studio's best productions. It's a surprisingly solid fantasy B-movie adventure with some decent production values and acting, and reasonably cool monsters. If you can handle your Sinbad wielding a machine gun instead of a scimitar, you might enjoy it.",1280880000,13,3369,4.887915936952715
4093721,1,B00396954O,"I would have liked this review to be about the Asylum's take on a true film classic, the 7th Voyage of Sinbad. Unfortunately, I am forced to write about an issue with the Asylum's DVDs. This disc would not play in my blu-ray disc player, nor my standard DVD player. It would lock up at the count of 13 on both play-back devices. I would chalk this up to a bad disc had I not had the exact same issue with the Asylum's ""The Land that Time Forgot"" On this occasion I tried two different discs with the same exact problem. Also rented the same film from Netflix and that one displayed the same symptoms. Even tried it on a third DVD and it still would not play.
