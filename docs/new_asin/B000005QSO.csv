1184842,5,B000005QSO,"This is the reason I don't watch romance anymore. None of the garbage being chewed out anymore can compare to epics like Man from Snowy River. A solid live story that doesn't rely on crassness or gratuitous sex to sell itself. This movie is truly timeless. No matter how many times I watch it, somehow it gets a little better. Bruce Rowlands score is truly epic. I dare anyone to listen to it and not find themselves humming it periodically throughout the next week or so. The  cinematography is incredible, the perfomances solid, the Australian landscape is beautiful, and the horsemanship is simply incredible. This is the kind of masterpiece that studios have sadly forgotten how to create.",1511136000,,693,4.872881355932203

The good Lord promised me an Australian woman for my  wife when he comes back  she is my soul mate  . Her name is Jacqueline she is about 5 feet tall with long brown curly hair ,brown eyes  and pale skin .She' s from Melbourne , Australia . She is the most beautiful I will ever see .I can hardly wait to meet her. This movie and all involved I  own a deep gratitude . I'm going to invite all of you to come to my wedding  in God's Kingdom. May the good Lord Jesus bless all you. Amen",1510704000,,647,3.748148148148148

1185086,5,B000005QSO,"I purchased this DVD years ago along with the second DVD as well and never took time to review it! Now, I will!  I can relate to the movie based on the fact that I grew up on a 7000+ acre cattle ranch with 3000 head of Hereford in Colorado.  Horses were the most important piece of my dad's ranch, and I learned at a very early age(5 years) to ride, rope, corral and all the fundamentals of ranching.  Of course, watching Tom Burlinson do his horsemanship was something to really see!  He was extremely impressive.  What people do not know about Tom was, before he made the movie, he had never ridden before.  He learned the skills rapidly and he became a very impressive horseman in my eyes!  The movie itself was breathtaking to say the least.  The movie brings back memories for me growing up and learning the skills required to work on a ranch.  Oh, to be young again.  Kirk Douglas was as always, magnificent in performing two roles; Harrison and Spur!  The just don't make movies like this anymore!",1488672000,,1004,4.4316939890710385

1185553,3,B000005QSO,"The Man fromt's interesting enough Snowy River is an Australian effort that came out in 1982.  It's no Shane or even Jeremiah Johnson, but it's interesting enough (PG) for young audiences, perhaps even family, though it's a little much rawhide and occasional stampedes for pre-teenagers.  The plot's predictable enough- young cowboy coming of age in the 1880's.  Kirk Douglas (I have to say, obviously the box-office draw in a case like this), plays two leads simultaneously, brothers from the U.S.-one a self-made wealthy rancher, the other a now grizzled prospector seeking that gold-strike of a lifetime.  The hero, Jim Henry (Tom Burlinson's debut) slowly (and I do mean slowly, by most Western standards) develops into a self-respecting outback hombre, defying the wealthy Harrison's (Douglas) eventually shaky hold on his (Harrison's) daughter, Jessica (Sigrid Thornton, the love interest), while claiming the long-awaited manly nod of approval from the prospector Spur (also played by Mr. Douglas).  You get the expected occasional breath-taking sky-scapes and cast of cowboys (I speak as a yank galoot here, I suppose), galloping pell-mell over the landscape to secure the rancher's prize escaped horse.  It would have made a good Walt Disney production way back when.  I still wonder about Jim's achievement of manhood over exteriors as large as this one.",1467936000,,1364,5.375586854460094

1185768,5,B000005QSO,"Great family movie. Sure, it has a couple of cheesy scenes, but what movie from the 80s doesn't? Good, clean story line. It has a little of everything - adventure, action, romance, intrigue, mystery...",1457308800,,201,4.9411764705882355

1185774,5,B000005QSO,"We were newly engaged and got to the theater to see newly released Star Trek-Wrath of Khan--so disappointed it was sold out. So we walked across the street to the only other movie theater in Alamogordo New Mexico. It was playing something called ""The Man From Snowy River"" starring...well, no one we knew except Kirk Douglas. Ah well...we were on a date, let's go in.

We left that theater so happy. Great story. Gorgeous camera work showing the glories of Australia's mountains and the wondrous beauty of its wild horses--the brumbies.  And then, hard-working young man trying to make his place in a hard land meets...the glorious and unforgettable Sigrid Thornton. Nothing like a ""boy from wrong side of mountains meets girl from wealth and privilege"" for date night-right?

Kirk Douglas camps up his roll in this lovely movie, but the real star of this fine piece, is the herd of wild and stunningly beautiful horses that provide the motion, the driving force, and the awe-inspiring beauty of this movie. Even today, 34 years since its release, it still brings joy.",1456876800,,1068,4.889502762430939

The terrain dangerous and completely breathtaking.  The pounding of the hoofs to the music.  Then, the horses hit snow and the pounding stops, the music goes to the tinkling of a piano, only to rever back when the horses move on to solid ground.  It is so beautifully done.

1186279,5,B000005QSO,I have always loved this movie.  I have probably watched it more than any other movie that I own.  It is nice to watch it in Blu-ray format.  Everything is much sharper & the sound quality is better.,1435276800,,199,4.184210526315789
1186280,5,B000005QSO,"As of now, this is the only ""complete"" series DVD set of The Man From Snowy River offered. This 90's era television series was also known as Snowy River: The McGregor Saga when aired in North America. This series was based from the poetic writings of Banjo Paterson, illustrates late 1800's life in rural Australia, includes a great cast of unique characters, brings high action and drama during individual episode stories, and an interweaving continuous long term story. The primary Aussie cast members are spectacular and well chosen for their specific roles, and a few North American actors make a notable presence as well. Very well known stars such as Josh Lucas, Guy Pearce, Hugh Jackman, Dean Stockwell, and Olivia Newton John each find their way into multiple episodes of the series. Andrew Clarke is nothing short of stellar in portraying the lead character of Matt McGregor during each and every episode of the entire series run. This series was produced with a healthy budget, and the production quality clearly displays this aspect in a very strong way. The scenic cinematography, close up camera work, pacing, editing techniques, film quality, sound recording quality, props and sets, are all top tier. This series will appeal to a very wide variety of persons, for many different reasons, and is completely family ""safe"". Many persons will find themselves watching two or three episodes at a time, as the story and pacing flow nicely.

This particular Anniversary Edition complete series DVD set is of very high quality. Each of the four complete seasons is housed in its own separate DVD multi disc case, and then, those four cases are placed within a nice quality outer slipcase cover sleeve. The video and audio have been re-mastered for this special set. Overall, on a scale of 1 through 10, I would have to suggest that the offered picture quality is a solid ""8.5"". The colors are brilliant, the contrast is highly dynamic, and the picture resolution clarity is excellent. The audio quality is just as nice, with great sound clarity, no abnormal background noise, and plenty of volume range (more than you will use). The combined four seasons, the complete series, spans 14 discs within this stellar DVD set. These discs are formatted in an actual resolution of 576P, and use PAL format color application. These discs are Region 4, and will ship directly from Australia when ordered. You absolutely MUST use a multi-region or region-free DVD player with integrated PAL to NTSC conversion in order to view these discs on a North American television. I played them using an inexpensive Pioneer multi region DVD player (with PAL conversion), and they displayed perfectly on a 47"" 1080P HDTV. Playback from the discs was always perfectly smooth without any concerns.

ONCE AGAIN, YOU MUST HAVE A DVD PLAYER CAPABLE OF PLAYING REGION 4 discs, WITH PAL to NTSC conversion, IN ORDER TO VIEW THIS MATERIAL ON A NORTH AMERICAN TELEVISION!!!

As of right now, the absolute best pricing of this set can be found by way of a website that uses a very colorful four letter name (yes, you know the one). While there happen to be multiple sellers offering this set through that particular site location, one specific distributor (the muses australia) will send this brand new set to your North American mailbox for a total sum of just under eighty five US dollars. At that price, this is a very nice set to have (or gift). Hopefully, pricing through third party sellers at this particular site location (Amazon) will become more competitive as time goes on.

This is a 5 star Region 4 DVD set, of a 5 star : four season-complete television series. GOOD LUCK!!!",1435276800,,3663,4.893719806763285
1186281,5,B000005QSO,"A beautiful, memorable coming-of-age tale set in Australia's pioneer past. Some lovely music, unforgettable imagery, and a truly delightful love story.

I've never seen such incredible horse chase scenes in any other movie. Obviously, I'm not into horses, but those scenes are so gripping and memorable I feel compelled to write a review and say so.

But there is aught between the two brothers over a woman, who died so long ago, leaving an only daughter. Jessica Harrison is that woman's daughter, and her father struggling to decide her future, when she has much of her father's independent spirit in her. Jim Craig is a young Scottish man who lives high in the mountains with his father. His father was killed in an accident. The other Scotsmen come to see him, advising that he has to prove himself down below to be able to be considered worthy to live up here. Craig winds up working on a ranch for Harrison, and serves him faithfully, but not until he steals Jessica's heart. In the end he rides off, vowing to return after he's got something to show for himself and claim what's his.

1186999,1,B000005QSO,"The original movie comes as a two-sided disc which gives you the choice between wide-screen and full-screen--no good.

The second part comes in full-screen only even though it says it's digitally mastered.

The original movie is excellent but the second one falls short.  First of all two important characters are conspicuously missing:  Spur and Rosemary.  What were they thinking?

Burlinson did a great job but not even he could not save the poor script.  Dennehy and Thornton were given very weak parts.

The worse thing about the 2nd part is the hairdos.  Why did they give Burlinson a stylish hairdo and ruin Sigrid's?  It's laughable and ridiculous.  It didn't fit.

SPOILER:  Since when did women move in with men in the 1880's without being married?  If Jessica was masculine in the first one, they made her even more so in the 2nd one.  You can't make scenes romantic when the female characters look and act like men.  When will they learn the truth?

Stick with the original but skip this set.  If you can get it in Blu-Ray, you won't regret it.",1423353600,,1056,4.708791208791209

1187584,5,B000005QSO,"The movie skillfully chronicles the transformation from being orphaned as a young man, to growing into full adulthood.  I loved it!  And I loved the horse scenes.  It's not technically savvy (it was made quite a while ago), but the story is charming nonetheless.",1404000000,,262,4.909090909090909

1187586,5,B000005QSO,It is still worth the time and the quality is much better than the old VHS that the family use to have.,1403740800,,103,3.727272727272727
1187587,5,B000005QSO,I first saw this movie when I was but a lad. And watching with my boys at the same age as the character really helps drive home the point of what is expected to do the responsible thing.,1403740800,,186,3.9210526315789473
1187598,5,B000005QSO,This was a great story for my tween daughter and I. She loves horses. It helped her to understand the importance of standing up for one's self and becoming self reliant,1403654400,,168,4.451612903225806
1187599,5,B000005QSO,"Love this movie.  Love the scenery and the music, and the real men. Great one to watch over and over again.",1403654400,,107,4.095238095238095
1187600,5,B000005QSO,always have and always will love this movie. The second one wasn't nearly as good as the first..but it's pretty darn good too,1403568000,,125,4.478260869565218
1187601,1,B000005QSO,As soon as we started watching the Man from Snowy River God's name was taken in vain. So into the garbage it went. We wouldn't even give it to someone else because we do not approve of the language content. Such a disappointment.,1403308800,,229,4.348837209302325
1187602,5,B000005QSO,this is an outstanding movie.  Terrifc scenery and photography. Really impressive action and especially the riding scenes and the quality of the action,1403308800,,151,5.565217391304348
1187603,2,B000005QSO,"We watched ""The Man From Snowy River"" based on all the five star reviews. It was our first time seeing it.

Sadly, the movie seems like a 1970s-era TV movie and doesn't hold up. The story is thin, the acting so stilted it feels like a high school play, and saddest of all, Kirk Douglas' acting is possibly the worst. He plays dual roles as brothers -- one who is over-dramatically tortured and the other who is darned near a charicature of Walter Brennan. Both are painful to watch.

I don't watch movies these days filled with CGI, but I do have expectations of betting acting and stories from my films. It's a shame, because it made me realize how we used to be satisfied with simpler things, but unfortunately, it just doesn't work any longer.",1403049600,,746,4.477941176470588
1187604,5,B000005QSO,"customers who bought this also bought 'the pioneers' by the australian group 'wallis & matilda', a musical setting of A. J. 'Bango' Patterson's poems, including a musical setting of 'the man from snowy river'.
the movie adds a little (a lot actually) to the original poem, covers every necessary clich&eacute;, and gives kirk douglas a chance to show off.",1402704000,,355,5.033898305084746
1187605,5,B000005QSO,always a good classic to rewatch.  we used to own the movie.. not sure where it went. thanks for having it available,1402617600,,116,4.2727272727272725
1187606,4,B000005QSO,"Interesting similarities between our west and Australia's: the gold rush, the rise to wealth and power through taming the land and the resources.  Kirk Douglas is always good but so were the supporting cast. Good, tight plot with no gratuitous elements and the photography was gorgeous.",1402617600,,286,5.217391304347826

1187619,2,B000005QSO,"I had higher expectations when I considered the ratings that convinced me to watch this older movie.  I was disappointed.  The story line was plausible but predictable.  The acting was a surprise, largely mediocre, from old stars to new faces.  The scenery was impressive, but couldn't redeem the whole.  As I finished the viewing, I was reminded of the Car Guys sign off statement:  ""Well, you've wasted another perfectly good hour . . . .""",1402444800,,441,4.8133333333333335

1187659,5,B000005QSO,"How many times have you heard of a poem being made into full blown movie? When ""Banjo"" Patterson write about the people in the outback Australia trying to make a living in some of the most desolate land in the world. he was not looking for fame on a movie set. He wanted to let people know of the struggle and the grit they lived.  Man from Snowy River was not how the poem truly was written but it was the basis. Man's  struggle to be excepted for him/her self, not stereotyped. I'm sure Banjo would have thought the poetic license a bit overboard, but  it made a better story.",1395964800,,578,4.236363636363636
1187660,3,B000005QSO,"I watched this at the request of my boyfriend (it's one of his favorites). It's good, I did like it, parts of it were super cheesy, but overall I have a positive impression of the movie.",1395705600,,186,4.194444444444445
1187661,5,B000005QSO,Spectacular scenery and amazing footage of not only the Snowy River area of Australia but of some pretty amazing horses and some of the things you have to see to believe.,1395619200,,170,4.516129032258065
1187662,5,B000005QSO,classic  movie the mountain range that makes you want to move down under i long to visit the snowy river riding a horse,1395360000,,119,4.173913043478261
1187663,5,B000005QSO,"This movie is simply stunning.  The cinematography is amazing, from beautiful shots of the mountains to some sweeping panoramic shots at the ranch.  You truly get an idea of the scale of both the Snowy Mountains and Harrison's spread.  On the other hand, it is wonderful at the close-up facial shots, too.  The music is remarkable, stirring, and even incorporates a bit of ""Waltzing Matilda"" into the original score.  As for the story line, this is classic poor boy-rich girl encounter, yet it has enough twists to keep it original and not formulaic.  Jessica is not a spoiled rich girl and was already a tomboy long before Jim arrived on the ranch.  The only very small nit I have is that I think they lean just a bit too heavily on setting up the shadowed backstory of Jessica's mother and the two brothers.  It's relevant, but you get ""something happened - but we don't talk about that"" so many times through the movie from everybody from main characters to the hired help before you actually get the details that you are beginning to expect that it will never be told.  I think a few less ""buildup"" conversation bites would have set it up just as well.  But that is a minor nit with what is unquestionably my favorite movie.  The scene where Jim is breaking in the colt as Jessica watches is gorgeous, done entirely as a musical montage, no conversation - nor any needed.  That is a very close second favorite scene for me to the chase.  And the chase.  Suffice it to say, it merits all the praise it has received.  An incredible, heart-pounding, gloriously equine extravaganza.  Predictably, the hero wins both the day and the girl.  But even the cynical by the end of that day's ride would probably have to admit that he has thoroughly earned it.  I wish I could rate higher than 5 stars.  My all-time favorite movie.",1395187200,,1823,4.570987654320987
1187664,5,B000005QSO,"Great film, great acting. One for the ages. Great family movie, or just for a quiet night in. Perfect for horse lovers, and people who love the country.",1394582400,,152,4.464285714285714
1187665,5,B000005QSO,"Got this for my Cinema Studies class.  Amazing, only one of eighteen students had seen it.  They loved it of course.  We talked about the sound quality compared to movies from the 30's and 40's.",1394496000,,194,4.485714285714286

I'll try again for them next rainy day.",1393286400,,311,4.098360655737705
1187684,5,B000005QSO,"You can see it as a ""chick friendly"" western or as a ""male friendly"" horse movie. Either way it's a winner. I'm a big fan of Australia-themed westerns, Kirk Douglas, and (pre- plastic surgery) Sigrid Thornton, so this is a really nice combination. An outdoor western with excellent cinematography unmatched until Silverado many years later. Check it out. You will not be disappointed.",1392940800,,384,5.111111111111111

One of the best photographed movies, I have ever seen.  It is just plain beautiful.  The editing, the story, and the acting are all superb.  It is hard to find a movie with the values, that this one portrays in  today's marketplace, and the musical score is out of this world.  I have the CD of the sound track also.

The serenity of the blue skies, the multi-hued greens of the meadow grass and forest trees and the gray granite prominences are suddenly transformed.  The speed and fury with which the clouds roll over the mountains and envelope the horizon, pushing a blinding mist and a pelting rain, create a terrible respect for the forces beyond human control.

1188102,5,B000005QSO,"The Man from Snowy River is one of my all-time favorite movies.  It has everything--an interesting story, a beautiful setting, colorful characters and a script where every line sparkles, either deepening the characters or else advancing the plot.  Set in rural Australia in the late 1800s, it tells the story of a young mountain man who must go down to the plains in order to make a living.  In the process, he makes the transition to full manhood.

The blu-ray transfer is acceptable.  On the positive side, the level of detail is good--much sharper than a DVD--which is what you want with a movie that has spectacular cinematography like this one.  You can see individual strands of hair and blades of grass.  Blacks are deep, and blues stand out.  On the negative side, however, there is considerable film grain in lower light shots.  And some of the brighter day shots look a bit washed out; they would have benefitted from a bit more color saturation.  Nevertheless, this is still a considerable upgrade from the DVD version.  If you love this film, you will want this version of it.

Parental Advisory: This film is quite tame by modern standards.  There is some mild language, a couple of accidents where people are hurt, and a minor plot element involving suspected adultery.  There is also a fist fight, and a couple of kissing scenes.  Most parents would find this movie acceptable for their school-aged children.

Unfortunately, this edition contains no special features other than the original trailer.

As mentioned above, The Man from Snowy River is one of my all-time favorite films.  It is a must-see, especially in this blu-ray edition.  Perhaps one day the studio will digitally remaster and restore it, giving us a pristine verison of the film.  Until then, this is as good as it gets.",1358035200,,1804,4.833333333333333

I named my daughter after Jessica in this movie...Ha, carful whom you name your kids after!!!

The rural grazing life in the Snowy Mountains has hardly changed since Banjo Paterson traveled the high country and wrote his famous ""Man from Snowy River"" poem. His poetry is an authentic voice of a frontier society in which song and campfire recitation were much appreciated entertainment.

""And the Snowy River riders on the mountains make their home,
Where the river runs those giant hills between;
I have seen full many horsemen since I first commenced to roam,
But nowhere yet such horsemen have I seen.""

Andrew Barton Paterson was born in New South Wales and was the son of a Scottish immigrant. Paterson was a poet, journalist, lawyer, jockey, soldier, farmer and one of the best-loved figures of Australian literature. His poem is the basis for this gorgeous movie about the treacherous terrain and bands of wild, stampeding horses. He also wrote Waltzing Matilda, which is lovingly woven into the soundtrack.

The Man from Snowy River Movie tells a more in depth story of a cattle baron Mr. Harrison (Jessica's father) who has had a long quarrel with his brother Spur. Kirk Douglas plays both roles. When one brother finds his fortune, the second goes searching for gold. This is a story based on a time when families tended their sheep and cattle. Ghost towns from the gold rush still haunt the landscape.

Set against the untamed Australian Outback, a love story unfolds between Jessica Harrison ( Sigrid Thornton) and Jim Craig (Tom Burlinson). Jim seems to have a way with horses and Jessica is a bit of a brash filly herself.

She has her own ideas regarding a woman's choices in life and choosing the path she will take in her own career. She defies her father and runs off to find Jim. Her anger towards Jim over a horse riding accident is like a summer storm that quickly disappears once she experiences the excitement of forbidden love.

Her father, Mr. Harrison, has not yet learned that there is a beautiful place inside each person where we are either nurtured or destroyed. He seems emotionally destructive and Jessica rebels because he won't let her follow any of her dreams. He seeks to trap her in his own wishes and thinks she should settle down into a domestic lifestyle.

Jim and Jessica are soul mates with hearts as wild as the horses running free through the snow. While at first they fight their mutual attraction, Jessica seems clearer in her thinking after she almost dies and realizes there are just some things in life worth fighting for.

Equestrian Heaven with an impressive conclusion! You must see this movie once in your life if you love horses. The wide-screen edition is highly recommended!",1355702400,,2813,4.769547325102881

There is an absence of pornography, and foul language; with a strong example of affection, responsibility, and taking initiative. This is a great movie to show young children between the ages of 5 and 9 years, to help them subconciously want to become better individuals than society would have them become.
This movie also indicates that conflict does nobody any good, but sometimes may be necessary to achieve one of the overall goals.",1351296000,,490,4.845238095238095

I was in the mood the other night to see this again, so I purchased the digital download.  I've purchased a number of movies this way and in general I've been very happy with the quality.  Note: I haven't purchased any HD versions of the movies I've downloaded.  This movie was the exception.  The video was grainy and the audio sounded tinny and harsh.  The movie wasn't high enough resolution to fill the screen on my laptop.

1188145,5,B000005QSO,"I've been a fan of this movie since I first saw it in theaters in the early 1980's.  I rented the VHS as soon as it was available, and upgraded to the widescreen laserdisc in the 1990's, and then the DVD.  So I've seen this film in all its incarnations!  And I have the soundtrack CD too.

So believe me when I say that this film has never looked better.  Watching this Blu-ray gave me one of the greatest feelings I can have when watching a favorite movie: the feeling that I'm seeing it again for the first time.  So many scenes were filled with details that were new to me.  So many shots took my breath away for their clarity.

The grain mentioned in another review is part of the film; meaning that the film itself is ""grainy"".  Having grain isn't a sign of a lack of care or skill in creating the high definition video and Blu-ray, it's a sign that the film is being presented properly.  There are things that can be done to process the high definition video to reduce visible grain, but this is not widely acknowledged as an ""improvement"", and kudos to Fox and everyone else involved for not going this route.

Great movie.  Great Blu-ray.  Highly recommended!",1338163200,,1167,4.397196261682243
1188146,5,B000005QSO,"This enchanting western, an expansion of the A.B. (""Banjo"") Paterson poem from writers John Dixon and Fred Cul Cullen, was one of the most successful Australian productions of the `80s. Director George Miller (the ""other one"" of ""Neverending Story"" fame) fashioned a stirring adventure with Tom Burlinson as a young man from the Australian highlands who has to prove his mettle to rancher Kirk Douglas after the death of his father. Burlinson falls for Douglas' daughter (Sigrid Thornton) while trying to retrieve his steed, who joined the ""brumbies,"" a collection of stampeding horses who roam the countryside.

Gorgeously shot, ""The Man From Snowy River"" is a romantic, old-fashioned film with a beautiful score by Bruce Rowland that supports every aspect of the picture. This is a decided throwback to the genre's early days - not a revisionist western - and on that level, nearly every aspect of the movie works. Burlinson and Thornton are likeable and generate sufficient chemistry, and even though Douglas and fellow top-billed cast member Jack Thompson were mostly added for name value, their performances are likewise amiable (Douglas in a dual role that was later recast - with Brian Dennehy - in the 1988 sequel ""Return to Snowy River"").

Fox's 1080p AVC encoded Blu-Ray transfer is just spectacular as well: crisp, detailed, and perfectly rendered. In fact, I'd go so far to say this is one of the best catalog discs I've seen in the last couple of years. The 2.0 DTS MA soundtrack is a bit problematic with sound effects that frequently overwhelm the dialogue, but it's still acceptable. The original trailer is the sole extra.",1337212800,,1639,5.044280442804428

1188149,5,B000005QSO,"Saw this one as a college student in the early 80'a and fell in love with the crack riding displays and the music. The story is a simple one that is popular in all countries. Unspoiled lad from the country becomes an orphan due to an accident involving a horse. He is quickly made to realize by the mountain men that he will have to toughen up a bit and then come back to make his way. He goes to the low country and starts looking for work . He runs into a crowd surrounding a horse and it's handler and ""rescues"" the handler from being trampled by the stallion. The handler turns out to be the lil firecracker of a daughter (jessica) to the local rich land baron. The story of how he becomes a noted horse handler derives from his working on the barons lands and falling in love with said firecracker. She is willful beautiful and determined to make her own path as much as he is . Watch this breath taking spectacle of a movie and enjoy some of the best horseback riding and scenery you have ever seen . The actors take back seat to it all but manage to hold their own. Kirk Douglas is in a dual role in this one as the Father and the uncle of Jessica. Watch and judge for yourself. This one is completely clean and suitable for all ages. Side note this was the first soundtrack I ever bought in my life . Loved the rendition of Fur elise but ended up loving the whole cassette.",1336435200,,1381,4.156716417910448

""Famous"": the security feature of the Australian ten dollar bill features the text of the poem in microscript. Banjo Paterson graces the obverse of the bill.

I was very sorry Australia declined to make the text of another Banjo Paterson poem their national anthem. Quintessential Waltzing Matilda was deemed not serious/dignified enough.

1188167,5,B000005QSO,"There is a magnificent artistry throughout the filming and direction of this wonderful movie.  Pair that with a unique, lilting soundtrack, and it's a picture that is surely qualified to take it's rightful place among the Classics; and while it is not about the American West, it is as wild and beautiful, possessing all the qualities of the best of the best Western movies.

Like the ""Mountain Mahogany, a hardwood shrub that adapts to grow in the harsh environment of a high country, so are the characters of each of the prominent players in this film.  The story is about the complex relationships between strong people sharing same blood but possessing vastly different personalities, goals, values; and the destined entry of another, newer strain of blood, equally strong - as nature brings out her master plan for the family.  A successful Australian rancher and his crusty, rough and tumble gold miner brother, both up to their ears in what motivates them, more alike than not, yet poles apart due to the conceptions they have of each other's lives and what has transpired there.  A beautiful, willful and headstrong daughter of one brother, whose birthright is under a cloud of suspicion by her equally stubborn father, fired by unreasonable jealousy of his wife and his brother - Kirk Douglas takes on the dual role of both;  and a young mountain lad, played by Tom Burlinson, sharp, responsible, capable, coming into his own and ready to prove it to those who will respect him for what he is - a gem in the making and not necessarily all that rough around the edges, either.

Supporting the superb entertainment value of this movie and it's human element, the photography is simply outstanding.  Shots of pale evening skies, silhouettes of the young lovers with the horses against the horizon, all are evidence of the director's high degree of talent;  vast 360 views of high mountain scenery  - all serve to add a surreal dimension to the tale, drawing the viewer in.  It even comes complete with one highly unlikely and even impossible action ride down a perpendicular mountain cliff.

During this ""coming of age"" quest for acceptance into a family he wants to provide the next generation through - but on his own merit and not on the back of someone else - the ""boy from the mountain"" becomes ""The Man From Snowy River"".",1326326400,,2333,4.805

1188192,5,B000005QSO,"This movie is poetry. Interestingly, it is based on a poem by A.J.(Banjo) Paterson, who is a character in the  movie, though not the main one. The two main characters are Jim Craig (played by Tom Burlinson), an 18 year old who is on his own after the death of his father, and a young woman Jessica Harrison (played by Sigrid Thornton) who is about his age, and is trying to break barrier as a woman growing up in the 1880's. Kirk Douglas has a double role- Jessica's wealthy father (Harrison) and his poor brother (Spur) who lives in the mountains, and keeps searching for gold. While Jim works for Mr. Harrison, Jim and Jessica fall in love, but the main story is about 18 year old Jim proving himself to be a 'man' by doing the amazing - rescuing Harrison's colt  from the brumbies (wild horses).  The feared Stallion that leads the brumbies is a character in the movie, and is very effective.  The master of the horses (Lovick) has done an astounding job throughout the movie.

 The side story about the two brothers and their past makes the movie fuller and richer. Kirk Douglas, though not the lead character in this movie, is brilliant in his two roles. Thornton and Burlinson are outstanding in the roles of the young lovers who must overcome their class barrier. The horse riding is brilliant, particularly when young Jim goes down a very steep slope while everone else watches him.  The music is a perfect fit to the movie. It is powerful during the horse chase, and melodious when Jim and Jessica are breaking in Harrison's colt.

Jack Thompson does justice in his small role as Clancy- the horse expert, as does Terence Donovan as Jim's father at the beginning of the movie. Lorraine Bayly is very effective as Jessica's loving aunt Rosemary who fights for womens emancipation in the 19th century.

The original score by Bruce Rowland is extraordinary. The music fits the scenes so well; it really adds to the impact of the movie. The cinematography captures the magnificence of the Australian Alps and makes this movie a visual treat.  The editing is superb. One example is when Rosemary, Jessica's aunt is telling her about her father's past, there is lovely music in the background, and the scene is followed by a group of horses running. That is the kind of sequence that makes this movie so artistic and poetic. This movie has no weakness. Everything seems to be perfect.

This is one of my favorite movies. It has a sequel (Return to Snowy River) that is also very good. Both are a part of my movie collection.",1298073600,,2527,4.618303571428571
1188203,5,B000005QSO,"This film is a gem! I'd rank it as one of the best films I've seen.

1. There is a quality of naturalness about the film...it makes sense as depicting people who really could exist, the heroic, the good, the not-so-good, and the evil, and situations and events as real as well.  This is a rare quality in a film.

2. The landscape is unfailingly beautiful.

3. The plot is a tremendously successful imaginative expansion of Banjo Paterson's poem of the same name. The part of the movie that depicts the poem fits perfectly with the rest of the movie.  You wonder how it's all going to come together...and it does.

4. The music...ah! The piano piece associated with the heroine is a gem, and the rest very fitting and lovely.

5. It's a great love story.

6. There is a technical perfection about the film that I'm not qualified to analyze.  Somehow, it *works*.",1297555200,,862,4.509677419354839

1188205,5,B000005QSO,"I can't tell you how many times I've seen this movie. For pure romance, feel... everything, it's one of my few favorite romantic movies and I don't watch a lot of them. It's beautiful to look at - the scenery is incredible, the characters are deep and well-developed. Horse people are the greatest people my brother used to say. You can see it in this movie, a tough, gentle, passionate feel. Jessica and her strong guardian, the tough feminist reformer that reminds me of old America (though it's Australian here), clashing with her strong-willed father over love. Jim is the young ranch hand who grew up in a rough mountain environment, grieving over his father's death, trying to earn his way, and is now working on her father's farm. He's also willful and tough and has big dreams. Their personalities are alike and they seem bound to clash or love each other. The people here are tough like the land and it all comes together in a grand, sweeping romance. The music is incredibly beautiful - I was inspired to learn the Snowy River theme on the piano and used to love to play bits of it. I still get a great feel from the scene where they train the stallion together as pictured on the cover. Strong, good people who love and endure. Everything about this movie reminds me of home and all I loved about it. If you grew up on a farm or ranch, around animals and prairies, this will ease your homesickness, or celebrate your love if you still live there. The sequel is good also - rare for a sequel to movies like this, both worth watching. I hate Hollywood, but I sure have trouble giving up some of my old - or any - movies, they're so much a part of my life. I think I'll keep them, but work on dismantling their exploitation of people's lives and stories.",1296950400,,1762,4.424615384615384

1188210,5,B000005QSO,"Kirk Douglas is outstanding in the dual role of estranged brothers, but the real star is the movie's hero.

Jim goes to work for a wealthy rancher (one of Kirk's roles), and comes to love his daughter. The rancher doesn't think that Jim is good enough for his daughter. When conniving ranch hands release a valuable horse, hoping for it to be blamed on Jim, he finds a chance to prove himself to everyone.

The story is dramatic and satisfying, the scenery is top notch, and the music is unforgettable.

1188236,5,B000005QSO,"THE MAN FROM SNOWY RIVER has earned its place as a unique and inspiring Western.  It was the first Western I ever saw at the cinema (I was about 7 years old at the time), and I saw it at a time in my life when all I was interested in were spaceships and lightsabers.

I recently watched it again for the first time in many, many years.  Once again, the mystically poetic music captured my attention as did the beautiful Australian scenery.  But also for the first time, I noticed one of the strong core themes of this movie: stay focused on the goal and keep going.  That's what the hero, Jim Craig, does all throughout the film.  Even in times of hardship, unfairness, and heartbreak, he always keeps his virtue and courage fully intact.  My favorite--and probably everyone else's favorite--scene is where he keeps chasing the horses (or ""Brumbies"") down the steep mountainside even after the older and more experiences horsemen gave up.  Given the kind of determination and rigid focus that Jim Craig had, I think he would have ridden down that mountain even if it were on fire!

This is one of many things that make this film great.  And once again, I will add that the music is wonderful.  ""Jessica's Sonata"" has now become one of the most recognizable piano pieces, even though many people would not know where it originated from.  It's the kind of music that stays with you long after you've seen the movie.",1259539200,,1413,4.563492063492063

1188242,5,B000005QSO,"This film is just as wonderful today as it was at the time of its release. A terrific story of an old romantic rivalry, a legendary wild horse, and a young man from the high country is played out against the rugged but gorgeous Australian landscape. It is cinematically beautiful, dark silhouettes of horses and two people falling in love captured in front of the orange and blue hues of the majestic plains.

Tom Burlinson is great as the young man trying to earn his right to live in the high country after a legendary horse named Stallion causes his father's death in a stampede. Kirk Douglass has a dual role here as Tom's friend, a crusty but lovable miner who has been working the same claim for years, and his brother, a rich cattle rancher he goes to work for.

Sigrid Thornton is beautiful as the daughter of the rancher, her dead mother being the key to the long years of hatred between he and his brother. Burlinson and Thornton begin an innocent but very real romance cemented when he saves her life in a storm. Her father, of course, is against it, but Tom's chance to prove himself comes when an expensive colt who may have ties to Stallion gets loose and starts running with the wild Brombies.

This is a beautiful and romantic saga that has an ending full of hope, which is really only a beginning. It is grand adventure and sterling entertainment that everyone in the family can enjoy.

1188256,5,B000005QSO,"This film is just as wonderful today as it was at the time of its release. A terrific story of an old romantic rivalry, a legendary wild horse, and a young man from the high country is played out against the rugged but gorgeous Australian landscape. It is cinematically beautiful, dark silhouettes of horses and two people falling in love captured in front of the orange and blue hues of the majestic plains.

Tom Burlinson is great as the young man trying to earn his right to live in the high country after a legendary horse named Stallion causes his father's death in a stampede. Kirk Douglass has a dual role here as Tom's friend, a crusty but lovable miner who has been working the same claim for years, and his brother, a rich cattle rancher he goes to work for.

Sigrid Thornton is beautiful as the daughter of the rancher, her dead mother being the key to the long years of hatred between he and his brother. Burlinson and Thornton begin an innocent but very real romance cemented when he saves her life in a storm. Her father, of course, is against it, but Tom's chance to prove himself comes when an expensive colt who may have ties to Stallion gets loose and starts running with the wild Brombies.

This is a beautiful and romantic saga that has an ending full of hope, which is really only a beginning. It is grand adventure and sterling entertainment that everyone in the family can enjoy. The romance between Burlinson and Thornton is old-fashioned and charming. The action sequences, especially the chase of a wild herd through the high mountains and snow, are beautifully filmed.

Whether or not you are fond of horses, the storylines will captivate you. I've been around horses all my life and never have seen daring riding like this! No stunt men here - just amazing horsemen from Down Under. If you don't get chills up and down your spine while watching some of the scenes, you gotta be dead.

Perhaps sound is now mixed for the younger people who suffer hearing loss from the music (I use that term loosely) of their times, but if so, I don't see how they can make out the dialogue.

But who can pick apart a thoroughly enjoyable movie that is such a treat to watch.

The music is some of the most beautiful I've ever heard. The soundtrack is definitely one of the highlights of the film. And of course, I can't forget one of the most incredible scenes I've ever seen in any horse movie, which is where Tom Burlinson gallops his horse down an unbelievably steep mountainside. My family and I have always wondered if this was actually done by a stunt rider, or if it involved trick photography. Either way, it is a very impressive scene, and will leave you in complete awe.

...all, cinematic and character delights - as you will find ""THE MAN FROM SNOWY RIVER""...
Technically a ""10"", this Aussie (and World) classic, may leave you none-the-less breathless. George Miller's direction, Cull Cullen's script (enhanced by John Dixon and David Bradshaw's, ""A.B. 'Banjo' Paterson"", whose original poem is the essense of the film), Keith Wagstaff's absolutely stunning cinematography and Bruce Rowland's original and heart-tugging music (particularly, the piano solo, ""Jessica's Theme"") may bring tears to your eyes with this simple, Down-Under western plot -- but it took a world-class editor like Adrian Carr to put this gorgeous film into the top ranks of movie-watchers the globe over. Carr's timing of Wagstaff's photography and Rowland's music is the stuff legends are made of...just, dare I say it, ""Professional Grade""(!)
It didn't hurt to have a made-to-order cast. Burlinson is quietly, and wonderfully, cast as the young male hero, ""Jim Craig."" Kirk Douglas hasn't played a better role - and, as a double. Terence Donovan played the quietly strong, short-lived role as Burlinson's father, ""Henry."" Sigrid Thornton was exemplary and believable as Tom's love interest, ""Jessica"" (the woman is beautiful) and the venerable Jack Thompson was magnificent as ""Clancy"" - the range-wise, ""horse-magician"" glue that holds the whole film together.
The subtle British humour Americans are so used to is sometimes raucous in the film - more the better from Chris Haywood's
""Curly"" (...""Ah'm studyin' to be Supavisa!"").
If you can't get an empathetic rise and a teardrop over the cornea through this wonderfully crafted epic, then pop-a-top from a 12 oz. curl of your favorite brew, pull back the handle on your Lazy-Boy and turn on the Wrestling Channel...you dolt.
Filmed in 1982, it's still a true classic 22 years later.

Kirk Douglas insisted on re-writing many of his lines, and refused to step off his horse with the entire cast at the end of the movie in homage to The Man From Snowy River. The entire end scene had to be re-written. Little wonder that Brian Dennehey was cast in the role in the sequel.  Enjoy both the original and the sequel.  And be sure to get the soundtracks.  Bruce Rowland created two of the best movie scores you will ever hear.",1080000000,,878,4.4375
1188300,5,B000005QSO,"This movie is a classic and a must-see. Based on Banjo Paterson's iconic poem of the same name, The Man From Snowy River will always hold a place in my heart. It tells the story of Jim Craig, who lives a tough life in the mountains and has the riding prowess to show for it. The storyline is cleverly adapted to also interest the audience through romance and other action, but it stays true to the poem in the most crucial scenes. This movie always sends shivers up my spine ^_^. For anyone seeking to understand Australian culture and character, this is an essential movie to watch - although it may not be how many Australians are perceived now, these men still exist and should not be forgotten :)",1079654400,,700,4.434108527131783
1188301,4,B000005QSO,"This is a good example of a ""family"" film that doesn't play down to any member of the audience. It also takes the Western in an interesting direction by moving the setting to Australia (it's based on a poem by an Australian poet). The dramatics are sometimes creaky, especially the twist that most viewers, even the young 'uns, will see coming from miles away, but the absolutely gorgeous photography makes up for it. The scenes of stampeding horses and the wranglers chasing them are literally breathtaking, and the widescreen transfers captures is all. Kirk Douglas is also excellent in his dual role and brings and American earthiness to the production.
This DVD features an excellent sound mix. Although not in 5.1, the Dolby Surround is crisp and lush for a back catalog film that otherwise has no special features on it at all. Bruce Rowalnd's wonderful score certainly deserves this deluxe treatment. And at this price, how can you resist the appeal of The Man from Snowy River?",1075680000,,985,4.869047619047619

The characters depicted in the movie are very real and believable with strong screen presences such as Kirk Douglas and Tom Burlinson. Tie that all up with the beautiful scenery of the Snowy Mountains and the award winning soundtrack of Bruce Rowland, make this DVD one of my all time favourites.
Saying that, don't waste your time or money buying the sequel. It is possibly, one of the worst movies ever made.",1072051200,,491,4.52808988764045

It is a beautiful Australian movie that runs with the brumbies through each story line of a young mans and womans rite of passage, the stale feud between brothers, petty coworker battles, a mine showing color and horses running and snorting everywhere.  So saddle up with some popcorn and ride this movie into its vistas of green, mountains, fog and snow to a nice musical score.  You will need the mountain horse that Spur gives you and a really cool dog to cross Snowy River. Hold on when you see how a real riders rides down the mountain.",1065916800,,730,4.432835820895522

Sure it has great cinematography, fantastic scenery and a GREAT cast but this motion picture is true literature. It's based on a poem by A.B.Patterson (perhaps Mr Patterson, a character in the movie). The story is about a young woman who's father plans to sell her to the highest bidder. The hero's initials are J.C. (look familiar) who comes DOWN to the low country (Earth) to free the young woman (the church) from Old Regret which is ""The sins of the fathers being visited upon the generations"". He chases down the horses which symbolize merciless FATE. He doesn't swing the heroine up into the saddle at the end but goes to prepare her mansion, promising to return. This is one of the best examples of biblical allegory ever. The Snow in Snowy River refers to something Isaiah promised. Another great thing about this movie is that Jim Craig is considered a hero not because he can kill but because he can WORK. DO NOT miss this movie.",1047600000,,1005,4.558011049723757

He'd received a stick horse for his birthday when he turned 3, and soon after when he watched the movie he'd ride right along with Jim (he's got all the choreography down pat).  He's pounded away miles and miles right in front of the TV, so much that we joke that we'll have to replace that part of the carpet before the rest of the floor.  The best thing is that I don't have to worry about what he's seeing.  No swearing, violence, or anything else you'd normally have to worry about.

To be completely honest, this movie is a ""chick flick"". The main themes in the movie are the romance and the horses. The action sequences aren't that great and the plot is relatively simple.

However, with that said, this is a well done chick flick. The acting is superb and I can just imagine how much fun Kirk Douglas must have had playing the dual roles his plays in the film. The setting is breathtaking spectacular and the score is moving. The directing is well paced and some of the scenes are unforgettable.

However, as stated before, the plot is thin and there really aren't any action sequences (even the chase at the end isn't that impressive) and therefore the movie only gets 4 stars instead of 5.",1037664000,,855,4.6118421052631575

The DVD (which contains both widescreen and full screen versions) features a magnificent visual transfer, and a thunderous, sumptuous orchestral soundtrack. The cinematography, especially the helicopter shots of horseback chases and Australia's vast, pristine, alpine scenery, is spectacular. The recreation of pioneering life is very believable, and the dramatic story is very engaging, with comical moments and nothing offensive (why can't they do that these days?).  And did I mention that the horses are gorgeous?
It would have been nice to see a feature about the epic poem of the same name by Andrew Barton ""Banjo"" Patterson, but that is easily found on the Internet.

1188311,5,B000005QSO,"This is something primal and Earthy about this film.  The horses, the terrain and the people all seem crafted from the same dirt.  Each character, man, woman or horse, display the same strength of will and personality.  An independent Australian film, ""The Man from Snowy River"" has the unmistakable mark of personal vision and integrity.
The story and themes are typical of Westerns; a poor boy from the mountains courts a wealthy man's daughter, the same boy seeks to prove himself as a man by succeeding where his father failed, an older man mentors the boy and sets him on the right path.  However, atypical of American Western films is the strength of the female characters, and the somber mood of the film.
The acting is top-notch.  Kirk Douglas does a suprisingly good turn in a dual-role, playing the brothers Spur and Harrison.  (when I first saw the film I didn't realize that they were the same actor.)  Each actor fits his/her role perfectly.
Of special note is the score.  I dare you not to get goose bumps during the finally, when the orchestra plays.
Not many extras on this DVD, but a film this good doesn't really need them.  ""The Man from Snowy River"" remains one of my all-time favorite movies.  Highly recommended.",1017964800,,1234,4.724299065420561

The film has such amazing scenery:  from scenes in the mountains with the clouds low around them, to the beautiful shots of the river, the scenery helps make the film so fun and wonderful to watch.
The acting in this film is very good.  Kirk Douglas does an amazing job as the father of Jessica, who just wants her to live a proper life.  She, on the other hand, wants something more from life, and eventually, falls in love with Jim, the stable hand who lives in the famed Snowy River Country of Australia.  The themes of love beyond class, and a young man comming into himself, this is one of those classic films that you just want to see over and over again.

1188315,5,B000005QSO,"The rural grazing life in the Snowy Mountains has hardly changed since Banjo Paterson traveled the high country and wrote his famous ""Man from Snowy River"" poem. His poetry is an authentic voice of a frontier society in which song and campfire recitation were much appreciated entertainment.

""And the Snowy River riders on the mountains make their home,
Where the river runs those giant hills between;
I have seen full many horsemen since I first commenced to roam,
But nowhere yet such horsemen have I seen.""

Andrew Barton Paterson was born in New South Wales and was the son of a Scottish immigrant. Paterson was a poet, journalist, lawyer, jockey, soldier, farmer and one of the best-loved figures of Australian literature. His poem is the basis for this gorgeous movie about the treacherous terrain and bands of wild, stampeding horses. He also wrote Waltzing Matilda, which is lovingly woven into the soundtrack.

The Man from Snowy River Movie tells a more in depth story of a cattle baron Mr. Harrison (Jessica's father) who has had a long quarrel with his brother Spur. Kirk Douglas plays both roles. When one brother finds his fortune, the second goes searching for gold. This is a story based on a time when families tended their sheep and cattle. Ghost towns from the gold rush still haunt the landscape.

Set against the untamed Australian Outback, a love story unfolds between Jessica Harrison ( Sigrid Thornton) and Jim Craig (Tom Burlinson). Jim seems to have a way with horses and Jessica is a bit of a brash filly herself.

She has her own ideas regarding a woman's choices in life and choosing the path she will take in her own career. She defies her father and runs off to find Jim. Her anger towards Jim over a horse riding accident is like a summer storm that quickly disappears once she experiences the excitement of forbidden love.

Her father, Mr. Harrison, has not yet learned that there is a beautiful place inside each person where we are either nurtured or destroyed. He seems emotionally destructive and Jessica rebels because he won't let her follow any of her dreams. He seeks to trap her in his own wishes and thinks she should settle down into a domestic lifestyle.

Jim and Jessica are soul mates with hearts as wild as the horses running free through the snow. While at first they fight their mutual attraction, Jessica seems clearer in her thinking after she almost dies and realizes there are just some things in life worth fighting for.

Equestrian Heaven with an impressive conclusion! You must see this movie once in your life if you love horses. The wide-screen edition is highly recommended!

1188316,5,B000005QSO,"""The Man from Snowy River"" is a movie I'm sure you'll fall in love with just as I have. Actor Tom Burlinson plays Jim Craig, a mountain boy from the Victorian Alps of Australia. Ever since his mother died he had been living with his father, Henry Craig (Terence Donovan). But when Henry is killed, Jim must go down to the flat lands to find a job so that he can keep up his place. Since Jim's horse, Bess, had joined the wild Brunby horses lead by the 'black stallion', a good friend Spur (Kirk Douglas) gives him a mountain horse, Denny. When he reaches the flat lands, he is hired by rich and powerful Mr. Harrison (also played by Kirk Douglas) as a stable hand. Though because he is a mountain boy and everyone says away from him, some even openingly making fun of him like Curly (Chris Haywood), Jim makes friends with the lovely daughter of Jessica Harrison (Sigrid Thornton). They begin to fall in love but when a dark and long kept secret involving the Harrisons is brought up, will they still be able to be together? And will Jim be able to prove himself not as a lad, but as a man... a man from Snowy River?
As a Hollywood Reporter quoted, ""A movie for the eyes as well as the heart,"" I most certainly agree with him! The Australian mountains are beautiful and breath-taking. There is not one place that you would want to skip or fast forward. And besides that, you have action and adventure, romance, magnificent horses, and absolutely terrific acting. Though Tom Burlinson and Sigrid Thornton are perfect for the part of the two lovers, the person who really shone in his role was veteran actor Kirk Douglas. He was wonderful and it must have been fun for him to play two parts in the movie.
There is also a sequel to this movie, ""Return to Snowy River"" in which Jim Craig returns to Snowy River after a few years. But many things have changed, but does that mean that Jessica's love for him has changed? Another marvelous movie though I was somewhat disappointed that instead of Kirk Douglad playing Harrison, they had Brian Dennehy play the part.
