8394587,5,B003D0HA2U,"Mickey Spillane and Henry James are two radically different authors and I love them both. Unfortunately Henry is very high brow/intellectual/subtle and not for everyone. I loved Daisy Miller, Henry's story and the movie were great. Sybil Shepherd was outstanding and then some and captured the  story as if by magic. Great cast, writing and direction.",1430524800,,351,5.267857142857143
