I recommend this for the dino scenes  but there are many other fine nature scenes as well.",1461542400,,244,3.784313725490196

8414854,3,B0043FQIUE,"If you are an Irwin Allen fan and a Ray Harryhousen fan you get a double pay off here. The highlight is 12 minutes of dinosaur footage. While this is primitively compared with his later work it is enjoyable to see his early work under the supervision of Willis O'Brien. One of the commentators to an earlier review has however, noted that some footage is missing from this print. Most of the feast is wildlife footage sometimes with 'comedic' overdubs in a style which was once common to children's television like the UKs Animal Magic or the Disney wildlife films. It's a bit annoying but there is some good footage. I suspect most of it was not filmed especially for this movie as some is in black aNd white and the quality of film stock is variable. I should warn the squeamish that there is a bullfight and some footage of whaling. The real highlight for me was the lovely score by Paul Sawtell of Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea fame and the mono sound is actually quite powerful and rich.",1444780800,2,994,4.437158469945355

8414856,5,B0043FQIUE,"I was very happy to discover this movie. For over 40 years it was thought to be the 'lost' Ray Harryhausen film (other studios bought it out and chopped it up for the nature footage) but evidently one decent print survived. Now my collection of Ray's flicks is complete. It was something I never dreamed would happen, so I'm delighted. Who cares if the actual info is extremely dated? I grew up with this puppy!",1364947200,5,411,4.493333333333333

8414858,3,B0043FQIUE,"I recently purchased this movie on DVD. After viewing it, I have to say that the only reason anyone should buy it is for the Willis O'Brien/Ray Harryhausen dinosaur sequence. The rest of the film is oddball animal footage with allegedly funny voice-overs, and believe me, it gets tiresome fast. If you're only interested in the dinosaur footage, you should know that it's much cheaper to pick up a DVD copy of ""The Black Scorpion"". The dinosaur sequence from ""The Animal World"" is included as a special feature on the ""The Black Scorpion"" disc. It was also recycled in the movie ""Trog"". ""The Animal World"" is only a must-buy for the most diehard Harryhausen fans.",1299715200,13,663,4.773913043478261
8414859,5,B0043FQIUE,"Before Irwin Allen did those science fiction TV series like Lost in Space and The Time Tunnel, and way before he turned his talents to theatrical movies like The Posiedon Adventure, he tried his hand at this documentary about life on earth.
Yes, the science in it is somewhat antiquated by our standards, but this turned into an interesting film detailing the progression of life on earth.  Willis O'Brien, who did the original effects for the 1933 KING KONG lent his talents for the dinosaur sequences in this film.
Excellent photography, complete even with some humorous elements involving a fight between a predatory spider and a beetle (you won't believe which bug wins!) provide for an entertaining film from half a century ago.",1292284800,3,733,4.959349593495935
