5198342,4,B008ZQ4W5U,"I was enjoying this movie a lot until one of the characters told the central character, 'You had every possible advantage'. I thought, what? The main character here is overweight, balding, unattractive and has no social skills. Talk about DISadvantaged. So after that I couldn't understand the tone of the film - it lost me.

I think the writer director is trying to discuss the American Dream and examine the fact that most Americans are excluded from achieving it. It is interesting that Americans BLAME these individuals for their failures and refuse to consider the political realities that have led to the situations they see, and in this sense the movie is the story of a murder. But it is the tone which is the problem here, since I don't accept that the central character had any chance at all in life and he is not to blame for his outcomes.",1350432000,,850,4.629139072847682
5198343,2,B008ZQ4W5U,"It's conventional wisdom to say that Tod Solondz has a jaundiced view of humanity and that his films are strange, sick, negative things.  We know that he dwells on unpleasantness, and at least once (""Happiness"") it lead to work that expanded the vocabulary of film.  I've been thinking for years, while sitting through movies of his that I didn't really like or enjoy, that he's entitled to work with this palette of misanthropy and that good things might occasionally come from it.

But this film really bugged me.  There was genuine humor in it.  There was some genuine skill involved in creating this.  But I don't discern any point to watching this, unless it's to be prelude to a suicide attempt.  Repeatedly, Solondz makes films that are like a mutant child of Werner Herzog and Rainier Fassbinder on a bad day.  That analogy probably makes his work sound interesting.  But I think that Fassbinder and Herzog each had a lot more to say.  Fassbinder sees life as motivated by masochism and sadomasochism.  Herzog sees life as a cold struggle with a harsh world, worth examining.  Solondz just seems to see life as a drag or a joke.  I can't recommend this film to anyone.  In the end I find it sophomoric.",1350345600,5,1210,4.672985781990521
5198344,5,B008ZQ4W5U,"I liked this film.  It reminded me of Solondz film ""Storytelling.""  I like the characters and I like the way they all have faults, some of them more severe than others.  It's too bad this film didn't get a wider thearical release.  It only stayed in San Diego one week, and I couldn't make it that week.  I'm looking forward to purchasing the blu-ray when it is released.",1349654400,3,371,4.397058823529412
5198345,5,B008ZQ4W5U,"I'm conflicted about this movie. On the one hand Todd Solondz is one of my favorite directors, his movies are intelligent and they always make you think. Dark Horse was no exception, I find myself thinking about it long after I've watched it. It's a sign of a great film when it can make you do that.

But as entertaining and stimulating as I found Dark Horse to be, I completely disagree with its overall message. Dark Horse addresses the trend in our modern society that young men are moving out at later ages. I think this complex issue is simplified in the film. There is no mention of the current economic situation or the fact that we've had a very high unemployment rate for going on six years. Indeed the unemployment situation is so bad that it's looking like this could turn into a ""lost decade"". Nor does the film address the systematic bias that schools today have developed against men, and why so many more women are going to college today than men. Schools are feminine places run by women, and over the years they've taken away things like dodge-ball for example and have started punishing boys for being boys. There's also a lot more grants and scholarship opportunities for women.

The character of Abe is such an unrealistic figure who you'd never see in the real world. What makes him so unrealistic is that he is staying at home because he CHOOSES to. Abe has a wealthy family, a good job, and supportive parents. He drives a $50,000 Hummer. This is directly in contrast to us men living with our parents in real life. Most of us WANT to move out, but we can't because we're poor and we can't find jobs. If most of us men in this situation were even wealthy enough to own a Hummer like Abe, we would rather move out and sleep in the Hummer then stay living at home. And none of us have parents that are as supportive as Abe's, that was so unrealistic how his parents kept throwing money at him, hooked him up with an awesome job, and even offered to help pay for his house, and yet he was still living at home. Most of us in this situation are not getting any support like that. I'd venture to say that most young men living at home are actually paying their parents money for rent instead of vice versa.

This is a movie that was written by a rich old person who doesn't understand what it's like to be a young man in modern day society. Solondz has no idea, back when he was our age you could get a gallon of gasoline for a quarter and wages were so high that a fry cook could afford to save up for a house.

Abe is portrayed as a failure partly because he doesn't have a college degree. Yet, what does it say about society, that everyone HAS To get a college degree now or they're worthless? Librarians have to get college degrees now! Soon, even janitors and cashiers will have to have college degrees. ""Oh, you're trying to become a janitor? you need to go a degree in Janitorial Science!"" It's ridiculous, whatever happened to apprenticeships and learning on the job? And most of the people who have college degrees don't even remember most of the stuff they learned in college!

But Dark horse doesn't touch on any of these issues. It oversimplifies things to the point where it's comedic in it's oversimplification. The messages of the film are two-fold. The fist one is ""if you live at home you're a failure"", the second one is ""men who live at home do so because they're lazy and immature"". The film really does make it as simple as that.

Not only were the messages simple, but they were also contradictory and poorly thought out. For example, Abe is criticized for his toy collecting, with the film saying ""toy collecting is a pathological response in a society of consumer capitalism"", yet Abe is also criticized for not buying his own house. Isn't the fact that everyone has to go out and buy their own big house by the age of 30 more of a pathology of capitalism than toy collecting is?

I guess the biggest question this film left me pondering is ""what defines success""? The film's idea of success is clear, if you, like Abe's brother Richard, get a college degree and move out, you are a ""successful front runner"". Never mind the fact that Richard works as a doctor overcharging and exploiting sick people in order to obtain that ""success"". By contrast, if you don't get a college degree and live at home, no matter how nice and funny of a person you may be, you are a ""dark horse that failed"". And if you collect toys you're also a failure because you are a ""pathological capitalist"",  Never mind that many would say the obsessive focus on status symbols like home ownership  are also pathologies of capitalism.

If anything, watching and contemplating Dark Horse, with its staggering oversimplifications, has made me believe the direct opposite of what the intended message was.",1349308800,4,4818,4.502288329519451
5198346,2,B008ZQ4W5U,"Hard to like the movie because the lead actor must be a stage actor because it's as if he is standing on a Broadway stage.
He's movements and speaking is so over the top that you can't enjoy the movie.
Farrow and Walken are great..but, the lead actor who plays the character Abe is really bad.
I don't know why Soldhonz would cast him...did he not give him a screen test?",1348704000,3,371,4.23943661971831
5198347,5,B008ZQ4W5U,"Yeah I said it. I enjoyed this more than The Master which I saw on the same day as this. The Master was beautiful in many ways but this movie leaves you with so much more. Justin Bartha deserves an Oscar nomination for bringing this miserable character to life with out making him annoying or any more ridiculous than he needed to be. Donna Murphy was also incredible and deserves all the supporting actress awards that will be bestowed upon others.

No one makes movies like Todd Solondz. One of the only true independent filmmakers out there. Shoe string budget, unconventional storytelling, great performances and respect for the audience. Check this out while you have the chance. I would love to see more films like this (that are only released in a handful of cities) receive the accessibility and cost effectiveness of the digital format. Doesn't replace seeing it in the theater but if you live in bum-f*** Utah this might be your only shot.",1348358400,10,949,4.751515151515152
5198348,3,B008ZQ4W5U,"If you know something about films of Todd Solondz (""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" ""Happyness""), you know what you are going to see in ""Dark Horse."" His latest film is darkly funny, but the subject matter is no longer as unsettling as before.

Jordan Gelber is Abe, a thirty-something single male who refuses to grow up and meet the challenges of life. He is ""working"" at his father's company (actually, he is looking at eBay for action figures), living with his parents (Mia Farrow and Christopher Walken).  Abe meets Miranda, recently divorced, and starts dating her. Overjoyed Abe later learns that she has her own issues. Then Abe falls into a downward spiral fuelled by despair.

We have seen someone like Abe in recent Hollywood movies. Abe is a much less likable version of Mark Wahlberg in ""Ted"" (or the talking Teddy bear), or Zach Galifianakis in the ""Hangover"" franchise. Todd Solondz sheds light on this type of character in his characteristic way, but what we get not particularly unique except for a few insightful moments.

Todd Solondz, who is also the director of ""Storytelling"" (where Selma Blair had appeared), has a knack for creating an unusual narrative structure. Sometimes Abe's reality is taken over by his fantasy, the gimmick doesn't end here. Donna Murphy's character Marie, Abe's office coworker, gradually begins to play a more and more important role as the film unfolds.

The idea is good (with the brilliant final scene), but its potential remains unfulfilled. ""Dark Horse"" is clearly a change of pace for the director, but fully a satisfactory one.",1379462400,2,1577,4.980988593155893

Some of the ""imaginary friends"" also say and do some odd things, but ultimately it doesn't go anywhere that ""Punch Drunk Love"" didn't do first and do better.  I found it very hard to care.",1368403200,,423,4.467532467532467
5198351,5,B008ZQ4W5U,"Todd Solondz has at this point firmly established himself as the preeminent chronicler of the rotten underbelly of suburbia. His characters are often vile, deplorable, riddled with insecurities; they tend to be delusional and manipulative. Solondz takes the peripheral characters, the ones who would usually only be around to solicit our pity or to give us a few sadistic laughs, and places them front and center, warts and all. He doesn't diminish their faults, nor does he force us to sympathize with them -- he is uncompromising in detailing their each and every flaw -- and yet, by the end of a Todd Solondz film, we do; so fully drawn are all of his characters that we cannot help but have a vested interest.

In his best work, Solondz achieves a delicate tone pitched somewhere between sympathy and pity. We can hate his characters for how horribly they treat those around them, but ultimately, they are doing the greatest damage to themselves. Whether overwrought or oblivious, his best characters all possess one fatal flaw: debilitating self-involvement.

In this regard, the protagonist of his latest film Dark Horse may be the ultimate Solondz schmuck. Abe Wertheimer, played impeccably and without vanity by Jordan Gelber, is in many ways the sad reality of the glorified Apatow man-child. An overweight thirty-something who still lives with his parents Jackie and Phyllis (Christopher Walken and Mia Farrow), Abe is a case-study of arrested development: his tiny polka-dotted bedroom is adorned with action figures, Simpsons DVDs, Dr. Who cast portraits, and Gremlins lunchboxes; his wardrobe consists primarily of novelty T-Shirts, offset by the occasional sports jersey; he ""works"" at his father's real estate firm, buying Thundercats figures off of eBay while Marie the secretary (Donna Murphy) clandestinely picks up the slack; and he drives around in an obnoxious bright yellow Hummer, the only consumer vehicle large enough to make him feel like a child.

At a wedding, Abe meets Miranda (Selma Blair), both of them having apparently been seated at the leftovers table. The only two who remain in their chairs, he leans convivially in to strike up a conversation. ""I don't dance,"" he tells her; she remains staunchly disengaged. In an act that's less love-at-first-sight than wounded-animal-means-easy-prey, Abe awkwardly and insistently wrestles Miranda's phone number from her.

Abe thus far seems little more than a harmless, dimwitted buffoon. But his seething anger and puerile disengagement from the adult world, we will learn, never stay repressed for long. The next morning in his father's office -- where Abe is the only employee to not dress business formal -- Abe becomes petulant and confrontational when his father requests the spreadsheets he had given Abe to finish some time ago. Unable or unwilling to accept his responsibility or to admit his shortcomings, Abe storms out of the office. He drives to Toys `R' Us to return an action figure which has a tiny scratch on it; after being told he cannot return opened merchandise, Abe bellows at the clerk ""You'll be hearing from my attorney!"" and storms out of the store. Later that night, Abe grows impatient during a game of Backgammon with his mother; she is winning, and he storms out of the room.

Abe locks himself in the bathroom and calls Miranda, who is distracted but agrees to see him on Saturday. When Abe arrives at her house, he learns that Miranda has forgotten about their date; this does not dissuade him however, nor does the brutally jilted conversation once she gets home, and he rather impulsively (in a manner somehow both impish and bullheaded) asks her to marry him and to come have tacos at the mall. Her silence is the only answer we need.

Miranda is quite a damaged soul herself, however, and several days later calls Abe to apologize and to invite him over. She tells him that after a long Skype with her ex Mahmoud (Aasif Mandvi), she realizes that it's time for her to leave behind her childish notions like suicide, ambition, success, and self-respect and instead settle down, get married, and have children. She doesn't want Abe, but she wants to want him, and for a guy like Abe, that's enough. ""Oh my god,"" she says after their first, tentative kiss, ""that wasn't horrible. Things could have been so much worse.""

Once Abe introduces Miranda to his family, however, the discord between his intentions and his reality grows. In a masterstroke, Solondz gives voice to Abe's long-suppressed self-doubt in the form of a series of dreams in which Marie arrives as a deus ex machina to give Abe perspective. These sequences are both jarring and comedic in the way they upset the narrative and make the audience question what they are seeing. But more so than that, they illustrate Abe's increasing panic, frustration, and retreat from reality. When Dream Marie first arrives, she hands Abe a stack of paperwork she has completed on his behalf and casually advises him to stop pursuing Miranda, who is too good for him. As his waking self becomes more aware of his own deficits, however, Dream Marie becomes a sexualized guardian angel and mother surrogate who alternately seduces and teases Abe, forcing him to confront his deepest desires and insecurities.

The film's other great running gag is its music; horrid teen pop of the Taylor Swift variety, the songs at first feel incongruous to the tone of the film, until it is revealed that all the music is diegetic, stopping abruptly whenever Abe turns off his car stereo. Like a low rent Greek chorus, or a pre-game pep talk from the Glee club, Abe listens to vapid, emotionally shallow, and superficially uplifting top forty music that is in stark contrast to his repressed accountability and lingering fears regarding adulthood. He confides to Marie that he wanted to be a singer, but now he's too old even for American Idol. His ringtone is a particularly awful tween number that borrows the chorus of ""If I Could Turn Back Time"", an apt theme song for a sad, lazy man devoid of irony or will.

For a man so crippled by his own arrested development, it does Abe no favors that his younger brother (Justin Bartha) is a successful doctor living on the opposite coast. Abe fixates upon the height markings their parents made of them on the door frame while they were growing up, knowing that height is the only measure in which he surpasses his little brother. Abe did not finish college; he has not moved out, moved up, or moved on from his childhood. He represents the worst aspects of both nepotism and capitalism: the consumer who has no desire to grow into a provider. He ascribes value to dates and numbers, but doesn't know what that value is. He has a linear understanding of progress, and cannot separate age from accomplishment. He will always be in the shadow of his younger brother, of his parents, of his past failures, because he is unwilling to step out from underneath it -- a cloud may just as well be an umbrella on a sunny day.

Solondz, of course, has no interest in saccharine redemption for his characters. Some may consider it cynicism, but he's too compassionate a filmmaker to deserve that label. Rather, Solondz is an unflinching realist. His films can almost be considered cautionary tales, highlighting the dangers of resigning yourself to circumstance. He is an objectivist insofar as he does not let his characters survive their transgressions without reprimand, but he is an adamant subjectivist in portraying the internal dimensions of such transgressions. Abe's narcissism is unforgivable, but it's not incomprehensible. He has become so adept at making himself both volatile and helpless that his loved ones have no choice but to coddle him.

When we look into the abyss of mankind, we have two choices: resignation or resolve. Abe may not be able to achieve the perspective or the drive necessary to drag himself out of his self-dug ditch, but this is not true for all of mankind. Why should film only portray the winners? As he has done so many times before, Solondz reminds us that understanding is not absolution, and forgiveness does not come without repentance.

5198354,5,B008ZQ4W5U,"There is nothing like getting two dysfunctional people together to create a successful quirky indie. What I liked about this film more than many of the others in this genre such as ""Jack Goes Boating"" or ""Greenberg"" is that I felt comfortable laughing at the plight of the main characters.

Abe (Jordan Gelber) works for his dad and lives at home with his parents (Mia Farrow/ Christopher Walken). He still collects toys and hasn't reached his maturity potential. He lives in the shadow of his successful brother (Justin Bartha). At a wedding, Abe meets Miranda (Selma Blair) a shy, overly medicated woman once married to Mahmoud (Aasif Mandvi). Abe is supported by his secretary (Donna Murphy) who becomes his imaginary conscience.

The setting takes place somewhere in New Jersey between Eagles and Giants country. The title ""Dark Horse"" is a reference to Abe. His dad likes dark horses. i.e. like the old days when the Giants would lose, but cover the point spread. Abe proposes to Miranda on their second meeting, which she ponders over in her medicated state which is apt for the tone of the film:

Miranda: ""I want to want you.""
Abe: ""That's enough for me.""

I liked the toy details and shirt selection of Abe. Indie movies pay attention to background details. Although I would have to ask Todd Solondz (writer, director) what real toy collector would remove the Gimli Toybiz figurine from its pack?  The ""Toys R Us"" store logo is blurred out, apparently there being some legal issue. The film gave me a few laughs, worth a view for indie fans. Acting was great.

If you don't like Indie films based on quirky characters with little action, then this is not for you.

5198356,4,B008ZQ4W5U,"Dark Horse is the latest film from Todd Solondz and is a markedly different animal from his previous films. It still maintains his misanthropic spirit but it's lacking much of the provocative material that so often brings attention to his work. That's not to say Dark Horse isn't provocative; it just shows Solondz at his most gentle and forgiving.

Solondz has long had a knack for great opening scenes and this is no exception. Abe (Jordan Gelber), an overweight and balding man, sits at a wedding next to Miranda (Selma Blair). He begins hitting on her, completely unaware of her disinterest. Following her outside, he asks for her phone number and seems oblivious to her obvious reluctance to give it. From here Abe goes home and we see he epitomizes arrested development. He lives with his parents (Christopher Walken and Mia Farrow) in a room filled with action figures, he works for his father but brings nothing to the company, he blames all of his problems on the failings of others; he hates his brother Richard (Justin Bartha), a successful doctor, feeling that he received special attention that Abe didn't. In one scene he reacts childishly after trying and failing to return an action figure that has a scratch mark on it. Despite her obviously medicated state, Abe attempts to court Miranda and eventually asks her to marry him. Meanwhile, whether real or imagined, Abe is often confronted by Marie (Donna Murphy) a much older co-worker at his father's company, who warns Abe of his potentially disastrous decision making.

Much of Dark Horse seems to function in and out of reality and fantasy. Solondz works this creatively to his benefit in one sequence where Abe goes to a store that is clearly Toys ""R"" Us, but the logo is blurred out (probably due to companies being skeptical of allowing their trademarks in his films). Essentially the film is a coming-of-age story told from Solondz's skewed point of view where, of course, no one actually comes of age. It's his most straight-forward, ""friendly"" filmmaking effort and the first to really contain a glimmer of hope. Solondz writes the most despicable characters and he seems to take glee in seeing how despicable he can make them. In Dark Horse he seems to like his characters and even sympathize with them. It's a testament to his own ability as writer/director and the acting of Gelber that Abe is made into a tragic character that we actually empathize with as the film progresses. Walken also impresses, in a more subdued role than he's inhabited in some time reminding us that he is an actor capable of subtlety.

While overall much different from Solondz's typical fare, it still solidifies him as an artist at crafting awkwardness and characters who are astoundingly dysfunctional in social situations. It's his most conventional film with many of his familiar themes explored without the dour characters and subject matter. Of course it's still peppered with his penchant for irony and finding the absurdity in real life. If it fails to be as brilliant as his other works it's because it's too simplistic; lacking in the dark complexities of his previous films. It's an impressive display of his range as a filmmaker, but falls short of being a masterpiece. Regardless, Dark Horse is a film that deserves the attention of those who have admired Solondz over the years and even those who gave up trying.",1353110400,6,3383,4.890243902439025

He asks her out once then proposes marriage. When a series of events begins Abe's life takes a strange turn. Having never seen a movie by Solondz before I was expecting this to be a comedy. I couldn't have been more wrong. The movie is OK but it's pretty depressing and Gelber does a really good job in this you really feel for his character. Selma Blair also does a pretty good job and they was she plays you are as confused about her as Abe is, which is probably the point. The acting really drives and helps the movie but to me the movie is just to slow moving to make it a high recommend. If you like Solondz movies then you will like this I'm guessing.

8533065,5,B008ZQ4W5U,"Probably my favorite of all Todd's movies, barely beating out Happiness.  I don't get all the comments saying something to the effect that Solondz' schtick is portraying completely unlikeable characters, since I often like and relate to them just fine, just seeing them as flawed and human and, in most cases, just doing their best to make sense of things in their own way and survive this world, as we all are.  Characters who seem too perfect just make me depressed because I know I'll never be like them (and in most cases wouldn't want to be), yet that's what society puts on a pedestal.  No thank you.

And Abe is one of Todd's most relateable and likeable (yes likeable) characters yet, so I don't get the comments calling him a ""loser"", etc.  And who ever said characters have to be likeable?  Must be nice to be a ""winner"" like these reviewers, huh?  Probably the people saying that stuff fear the introspection required to look at their own lives so they just judge others.  Or they hate in others what they also hate in themselves.  I know this is a Type A, capitalist, Trump-loving society, where people get judged harshly just for trying to be an individual and stay true to themselves and their ideals (could definitely relate to Abe when it came to how his family treated him, especially his so-called ""alpha"" brother...""tough love"" isn't always the answer, people) but not everything has to be about ""losing"" and ""winning"".  Or ""growing up"" (I've tried it and, believe me, its not all people make it out to be).  So I'll just correct you all's ""pathetic"" judgments and change it to ""sympathetic"" - how's that? :P

Loved the opening scene where everyone was dancing except Abe and the girl - right there was when I knew I'd like him.  Conformity is overrated.  And what's wrong with being an adult and still liking a little cheesy, catchy pop music?  The world is serious and scary enough as it is.  Nothing wrong with wanting to escape.  Anyway, personally, the older I get (I'm 40) and the more I experience of life's highs and lows, the more I gravitate to quirky, offbeat, indie ""dramedies"" like this.  The stories just feel more real, human, and relateable than most Hollywood stuff.  Right up my alley.  Highly flawed but basically good hearted people just trying to do their best.  Sign me up.  So if anyone out there has ever felt different from the herd, ever felt lost, alienated, or like they don't belong in this world, I'd definitely recommend this movie as, while I wouldn't call it ""sentimental"" by any means, its definitely the most (dare I say) hopeful and has the most heart of all Todd's movies.

""This is my car!"" his dance announces. ""This is my totally cool, expensive car! Yep! I'm cool!""

Abe pumps his arm in the air after throwing his soda can in the trash, free-throw style. He checks himself out in the mirror for too long and you know, you just know, he's dying to blow himself a kiss.

Trouble is, Abe, who is expertly played by Jordan Gelber as a phlegmatic yet oddly sympathetic oaf, has little to boast about.

A graceless thirtysomething manchild, he lives with his parents in a little boy's bedroom filled to the brim with toys.

He's desperately lonely, depressed, and harbors such enraged self-loathing you almost feel sorry for him when he unleashes his hatred on his hapless parents.

Abe's dad, Jackie (an amazingly zombielike Christopher Walken), is an automaton whose success as a real estate developer seems to have come at the expense of his soul, his heart, his passion. Abe's mom, Phyllis (Mia Farrow), is a perpetually exhausted housewife who looks ready for the knacker's yard. She's also Abe's only friend.

Abe is the quintessential Solondz character, a master at self-deception whose existential despair is sugarcoated with shiny toys.

As Dark Horse opens, Abe is offered an unbelievable opportunity to reverse his fortunes when a woman he meets at a wedding actually gives him her number.

Miranda (Selma Blair in a deliciously angst-ridden performance) is slim, attractive, stylish. But she's just as messed up as Abe. She's a lost soul, a narcissistic depressive who lives inside her head.

She makes clear she's not in the least bit attracted to Abe, yet agrees to go out with him. She says yes with the melancholy conviction of a prisoner being led to the noose. She acknowledges that it's time she ""gave up on my literary career, hope . . . independence, self-respect. I should just get married.""

She looks shocked after Abe kisses her for the first time. ""Oh my God,"" she says, ""that wasn't horrible!""

The film enacts an odd - and, at times, oddly endearing - love story between the unlikely couple, characters whose kind Solondz has put under the microscope since his 1995 breakout, Welcome to the Dollhouse. Happily, Dark Horse retains some of the earlier film's charm, making it a much more successful film than many of Solondz's recent offerings.

Solondz here restrains his tendency to turn his films into pitiless autopsies of middle-class suburbia, films told by an artist who seems to feel nothing but contempt for his own characters. With Dark Horse, he tempers his ironic gaze and satiric edge with real humanity.",1474588800,,2876,4.941908713692946
