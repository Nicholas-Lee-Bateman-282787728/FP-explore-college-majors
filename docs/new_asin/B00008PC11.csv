1857646,1,B00008PC11,"After seeing Black Book I was interested in seeing other movies about the beginning of the German invasion of Holland. I tracked this one down, but what a waste of time it was....It's very confusing when attempting to show the atmosphere in Amsterdam at this time. Hard to know the motivations of some of the characters, and in the end the only interest for me was seeing the Australian actor, Peter Finch, in an early role before he gained international stardom.
Finally it's drab, and should be avoided!",1190332800,2,505,4.75

I have been told this story many times by my father since I was a little girl and now through the magic of VHS and DVD, I can see the movie version of what happened. It is a really wonderful story and the movie really does it justice!!",1085702400,15,319,4.0
1857650,5,B00008PC11,"This excellent British historical account of snatching Dutch industrial diamonds out of invading Nazi hands in May 1940 is
based on ""Adventure in Diamonds"", and I think much better than the book. The decisions and fears of the  Dutch and Jewish diamond merchants of Amsterdam are excellently and incisively portrayed,as are the British SAS Major Dillon and his Dutch ""assistants"",and the ""Fifth Columnist"" Nazi sympathizers
in the Dutch Army. Eva Bartok is outstanding in her portait of a
Dutch woman helping the small team racing the clock and the Germans to gewt these diamonds, needed for tank, weaponry, and
ammunition production, off to Britain. The black and white film, and the photography, emphasize the mood well, as do the actual
scenery in Ymuiden and Amsterdam. Learn some exciting true  history !",1068508800,33,809,5.1679389312977095
1857661,2,B00008PC11,"Unlike American movies about World War II which stressed big action scenes, British films of the 1940s and 50s tended to be low key and realistic, in large part due to budgetary constraints. However, for those looking to see what really happened, they can be quite revealing. Unfortunately, as Operation Amsterdam reveals, revealing is not the same as compelling.

The film is based on actual events in the early days of World War II. In the spring of 1940, the Germans launched their attack of France through the Netherlands and Belgium. The Dutch were ill prepared to do battle with the Germans and the country fell in a few days. Before Amsterdam was occupied however, a secret British intelligence mission sent two Dutch civilians (whose families were in the diamond business) and a British officer from England to Amsterdam. Their mission was to take as many industrial diamonds as they could back to England so the Germans couldn't use them in the war effort. Aided by a local woman they meet at the harbor, they have to make their way inland to Amsterdam, persuade the jewelers to let their diamonds go, and also get back to the coast without being caught. In a clever twist, it's not the Germans trying to stop them but Dutch police and troops, whose rationale is never made really clear.

The premise is interesting, and I'm sure that the mission must have been incredibly dramatic and dangerous for the actual participants, but the drama and danger never quite translate to the big screen. Instead, we get a couple of staged shootouts on what seems to be a back lot, some very low key discussions among the jewelers, and the beginnings of a tepid romance between stars Peter Finch and Eva Bartok. A PBS documentary on the subject would have been more interesting.

Ironically, the only powerful scenes are at the very beginning and end of the film when we get to see the panic among the fleeing Dutch civilians trying to make their way to safety. One scene at the end of the movie involving an attack by German aircraft is particularly harrowing. These scenes give a glimpse of what the actual invasion must have been like. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie seems dramatically inert and obviously staged in comparison.

Fortunately for viewer, the audio and sound quality of the DVD (it is a black & white film) are quite good, considering the age of the movie and the obvious lack of money spent on any restoration.",1391299200,,2429,4.735224586288416
1857662,1,B00008PC11,Terribly slow plot. Very little action. No suspense. I was a bit tired when I started watching this film. It put me to sleep. Only redeeming value is seeing Peter Finch in an early role.,1358208000,,186,4.3428571428571425
1857663,5,B00008PC11,"What a great old WW II war move they don't make them like that anymore. I like that this move takes place in Denmark just as the Nazi's are moving in. We don't learn a lot, in school, about what happen in Denmark at that time and this move gives us a little insight.",1323388800,,266,3.9444444444444446

1857665,2,B00008PC11,"You never connect with any of the characters. You do not dislike the characters; they are just kind-of bland....like....uh...Sweden!

I give 2-stars to any movie I do not keep to watch again 10-years from now.

Some very unique and realistic bombing-raids are a highlight of the film.

Britain sends agents to bring Amsterdam's industrial-diamonds back to Britain, and out of the hands of the approaching German-army. There are many German-sympathizers in Amsterdam. The agents do not know who to trust. This is not an espionage movie like the movie's title implies. It is a simple plot of the British-agents trying to get through the German-sympathizers mostly by avoiding them.

Some shoot-outs. There is not anything strikingly bad about the film. Some things are done well. It was ok, just didn't grab me. You have to have some characters with personality for a good film. War movies with personality are: ""Where Eagles Dare"", ""The Great Escape"", ""Escape from Sobibor"", ""Wild Geese"", ""Patton"".",1295481600,,997,5.173913043478261

1857669,3,B00008PC11,"One day you have a picnic in the park, the next day your own countrymen turn against you as spys.  You don't know who to trust and that comes thru in this film.  I didn't particularly care for the acting or the script, and some moments seemed to drag, but the point was well made and I'm not sure of any other film that speaks to these issues.

A good addition to your war film collection.",1237420800,,389,4.092105263157895
1857670,3,B00008PC11,"It is the early days of the war in Europe and the German war machine is victorious on all fronts ,moving across Holland on the road to eventually occupying Amsterdam .The British government is greatly concerned that e Germany will get its hands on the industrial diamonds being held in the city and at the direct instigation of Churchill they mount a mission to try to spirit the diamonds away before the Nazis get their grubby little paws on them
The mission team consists of a British army Major (Anthony Quayle)and two Dutch civilians with links to the major diamond magnates in the city (Peter Finch and Alexander Knox ).On arrival in Holland they find chaos with the roads blocked with refugees seeking to get to England and Luftwaffe raids common .There is doubt about who can or cannot be trusted and talk of spies(fifth columnists)is rife

They commandeer a vehicle and its driver a suicidal young woman -Eva Bartok -and drive to Amsterdam where the response of the diamond merchants  to their plea to be handed the diamonds is mixed .The Jewish community fear reprisals and some believe the diamonds would be safer in France as they believe the French army cannot be defeated by the Germans (Obviously not students of history-they fail to realise that the French response to occuaption is traditionally ""Occupy Paris-certainly sir .I presume that will be another 30,000 for dinner tonight then"")

Things move to a climax with the men seeking to retrieve the diamonds from a safe as the Germans attack the bank building

The middle of the movie sags a little but it opens and closes well and benefits from some evocative moncchrome  photography of a deserted Amsterdam

It is well acted especially by Eva Bartok and throws light on a neglected area of the war highlighting in particular the exemplary courage of the Dutch nation

Its not an especially exciting movie until near its end but it is enjoyable and is recommended to those seeking a new slant on the war/espionage picture",1196208000,13,1990,4.818181818181818

7986275,3,B00008PC11,"PLOT: 3 people try to remove all the diamonds from Holland to stifle the German efforts.

1940~ The phony war is over and the Germans are on the move. They are ""hours"" away from taking Holland. A group of 3 men are taken from England to Holland to remove diamonds and especially the ""industrial"" diamonds that would aid the German War efforts. Industrial Diamonds are used to bore and help tool and dye machines to make weapons. Convincing the Diamond Merchants this is a good idea is difficult and they end up relying on a girl....lovely Eva Bartok to move around Amsterdam. All 3 men suspect Bartok could be a German Spy.  As German fifth columnists/spies  dressed as Dutch Police and Soldiers hamper their every move, They finally decide to blow up the vault that is on a time lock and remove the rest of the diamonds themselves. Peter Finch is very good as a Dutch diamond expert. The scene stealer here is Bartok who's Jewish fiance is battling the Germans. Some good car chases. This movie moves way too slow. At times you have to work to keep watching. I would give it 3 STARS~",1492300800,,1084,4.520408163265306
