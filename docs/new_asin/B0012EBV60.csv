8245399,5,B0012EBV60,"ONE OF MY FAVORITE SERIES, I'VE WATCHED IT SEVERAL TIMES.  LOVE CAROLINE QUENTIN.  IT'S A DRAMA, BUT HAS LOTS OF FUNNY MOMENTS AND GREAT SUPPORT CHARACTERS AND ACTORS.",1383350400,,167,4.928571428571429
8245400,5,B0012EBV60,Wonderful characters. Wonderful actors. Nice to see a modern British show that isn't a costume drama or a detective show.,1367798400,,121,5.1
8245401,5,B0012EBV60,Very well done.  Caroline Quentin surrounded by a terrific cast.  I hope there will be more of this series.  Thanks for a terrific show.,1356566400,,136,4.583333333333333
8245402,5,B0012EBV60,"I was pleasantly surprised what a great series this is! I didn't know anything about it but it came through as a ""should see"" by Amazon because of similar movies I have purchased in the past.  I know Series 2 is out on DVD but not for the American zone.  I gave Life Begins to a friend who also enjoys British series  and she absolutely loved it too. I give Life Begins a definite Thumbs Up!",1341360000,,391,4.118421052631579
8245403,5,B0012EBV60,"I bought this dvd knowing nothing about the show. It was cheap and I needed a few more $$ on my order to get free shipping. WOW, have I been pleasantly surprised. It is an undiscovered jewel. I spent all day yesterday watching it and will watch the few remaining episodes today. I would put it in the comedy/drama category. Women ""of a certain age"" will be able to relate (especially if you're divorced).",1314316800,,404,4.472972972972973
8245404,3,B0012EBV60,"All of Caroline Quentin's work is worth a look and Life Begins is no exception.  The viewer should know, however, that this is not-very-comic drama.  There is occasional humor that is more comic relief than truly 'comic'.  Maggie Mee's husband abruptly announces that he is unhappy.  He moves out and soon there is another woman in his life.  Maggie gets a job in a travel agency and, eventually, there is a new man in her life.  Along the way we have a lost job, the threat of another lost job, an abortion, a drug overdose, a case of Alzheimer's, sexual temptations, a Blair Witch scene in the woods and sustained tension.  By the last episode Maggie's ex-husband (who is living in her lover's house) describes the situation as akin to a French farce.  There is little joy and little humor in the initial episodes, though things lighten up a little bit as we move toward the third season conclusion.  Caroline Quentin makes it all worthwhile, though the largely unrelieved pain of the initial episodes make this closer to docudrama on the difficulties of modern life than actual comedy.  The fact that CQ/Maggie's life is in constant turmoil makes the plotting frenetic to an annoying degree.  This seems to be part of CQ's screen persona; her struggles with her kids and the general disorder of her life recalls her performances in Blue Murder, a series that is more successful than Life Begins because it remains faithful to its genre and does not annoy the viewer in the way that Life Begins sometimes does.

Recommended for those who like to see characters whose lives are more addled than their own and who appreciate good acting in the face of uneven scripts.",1310083200,3,1667,4.730103806228374
