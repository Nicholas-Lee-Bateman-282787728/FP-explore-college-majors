4134208,5,B003KWWDIC,"This is an exceptional film.  Jeff Turner and Kelley McCormack are fascinating individuals. Both are obsessed with and in love with 80's pop sensation Tiffany.  Jeff has aspergers and believes he can travel through time and read her thoughts.  Kelley is a transgendered individual who's sad life is only made happy by her unrequited love for Tiffany.  The more you learn about these characters, the more the mystery deepens.  The documentary has several twists and turns.  The final revelation of Jeff's new relationship is shocking and hilarious.  There are several highly quotable lines in the film.  As bad as you feel for these two sometimes, they can also be very funny.  The extra features on this disc are really great.  The commentary by Jeff and Kelley is quite revealing and there are several deleted scenes and extra footage to fill another doc.  I loved this movie.  I urge everyone to see it.",1283385600,5,905,4.881578947368421
4134209,3,B003KWWDIC,"Every second of this should have been Jeff talking.  It's really hard to find someone with such a complete lack of self awareness and an obsessive inability to see other points of view.  Kelly, on the other hand, seemed thrown on the plate at the last minute like a sprig of parsley on a Denny's grand slam.  I doubt ""she"" even listened to Tiffany in the 90's and 2000's.  I also cannot help but suspect 80's pop star Tiffany herself was secretly involved in this documentary behind the scenes.  There's no such thing as bad publicity, especially if you keep releasing albums decades after 99.999% of the population stopped listening.",1388016000,,634,4.7272727272727275
4134210,1,B003KWWDIC,"I am surprised that the reviews on this are generally 4 stars. i gave this 1 star because it was so upsetting. These 2 men are clearly mentally disabled with a side of delusional tendancies. I did not buy this movie, but as a child of the 80's i was curious to see what kind of people still worship Tiffany after 20+ years. It seemed maybe the filmakers for this wreck were in on the joke and the ""stars"" of the movie were not.",1358985600,3,427,4.095238095238095
4134211,5,B003KWWDIC,"I read reviews on a number of sites about this documentary, some good and some bad. I think the bad ones were from people who really don't ""get"" this film or documentaries in general.

It's not an expensive piece of work and focuses on just two individuals but strays from them to include a few people around them who talk about their friends, as well as a couple of others who are just embarrassed by them.

Uplifting? No, it's sad in places but overall a phenomenal work and well worth the hour.",1354406400,,497,4.391304347826087
4134212,4,B003KWWDIC,"Ever thought about wanting to be a fly on the wall in a looney bin, where here you go. The two main characters are bat shit crazy, and lovable and disturbing and awe inspiringly weird. I could give two shits about Tiffany or her career, but to watch the train wreck that is a couple of her fans is priceless. This movie is full of cringe worthy moments, the moments that are hard too watch because they are so overly embarrassing for the people on the screen. A true gem!",1352073600,,471,4.2444444444444445
4134213,3,B003KWWDIC,"This documentary has a good premise; it has two good character studies; however, it doesn't really have a flow and it doesn't really go anywhere.  I would like to have heard more than the viewpoints we did - maybe from Tiffany herself - or some mental health professionals.

Even if there was no one who could specifically comment on the two persons in the film, a general overview of cases similar to these and the implications on society and from society where these are the complexes we produce would have been nice, and created more substance.  It's kind of a ""look at the freaks"" thing, and that's never good.

Kelly is the standout of the film.",1347408000,2,650,4.577586206896552
4134214,5,B003KWWDIC,"A fascinating  and endearing portrayal of human pain and the triumph of will over soul crushing sadness.  And seriously, who wouldn't like a katana and 6 white flowers as a gift?",1326067200,,178,4.709677419354839
4134215,5,B003KWWDIC,"Whenever I feel like a socially awkward misfit I just pop this into the DVD player and am reassured how normal and well-adjusted I am.

It must be accounted a major failing of this film that they weren't about to get Tiffany herself on camera to talk about these two gentlemen.

Despite that, a riveting, though cringe-inducing film.  I wonder if all such pop stars have legions of weirdo stalkers, or if for some reason Tiffany has attracted more than her share.  If so, I wonder why.

One disappointment is the quality of the photography:  it's like the whole thing was filmed on a iPhone or something.  They certainly didn't use a professional movie camera.  This is a bummer, since the idea for this film was brilliant and deserved a full 35mm film camera.

Another drawback of this film was that it was poorly edited.  The sequence with the two principals going to Las Vegas made sense, but for nearly every other part of the film, it felt like the editors had just dropped any scene into any position.

Note that this is a very short film:  64 minutes.  Even at that it seems a big long.",1315008000,4,1093,4.4873096446700504
4134216,3,B003KWWDIC,"This is a view into the lives of two people who are big fans of the pop star Tiffany.
You discover the problems of these people and how they handle problems. Part of that
is to obsess about someone who brings them comfort through music.

This film shows you a peek into the alternate thinking that drives these people.
It is a thought provoking film. It won one award for best documentary.",1288396800,3,389,4.402777777777778
4134217,4,B003KWWDIC,"""I Think We're Alone Now"", a documentary following the strange misadventures of two obsessed Tiffany fans, is an entertaining doc but fails to provide anything of real substance. Jeff Turner and Kelley McCormack are two misfits who's only joy in life is going to Tiffany concerts and plastering their walls with Tiffany pictures. For those of who don't know Tiffany, she was a pop singer in the 80's who was fond of singing her chart topping hit ""I think we're alone now"" in shopping malls across the U.S! Jeff has aspergers and thinks he can communicate with Tiffany via a device that looks like the time machine from ""Napoleon Dynamite"" and Kelley is a transsexual marathon runner. While watching the documentary, I definitely got a ""Look at the freaks!"" type chuckle but I quickly realized that they were just a couple of tragic and lonely people. With that aside, there are a few moments that you can't help but laugh at. After one Tiffany show the director decided to interview a random Tiffany fan. When asked why she goes to Tiffany shows, the fan simply states that Tiffany reminds her of the simpler, happier times of her youth. Then! out of nowhere, Jeff comes in and starts rattling off stuff about how he and Tiffany are the best of friends and how she fills his soul with light.. The look on the unsuspecting fan's face is absolutely priceless. In another scene, Jeff and Kelley go to a Tiffany concert and are hanging out in their hotel room together where they proceed to try and ""out stalker"" each other. Their conversation is pretty hilarious. So! while I enjoyed ""I think We're Alone Now"" much in the way someone would enjoy watching a train wreck, I felt that it didn't really have a point other than being a freak show. It can also be seen that there are a lot of sad lonely people out there that don't have any hope for happiness other than a delusional fantasy. Heartbreaking or hilarious, maybe both, I guess ""I Think We're Alone Now"" is all in how you look at it.",1288137600,9,1987,4.584269662921348
4134218,5,B003KWWDIC,I stumbled across this DVD by accident and was surprised at how much I liked it. I generally don't watch a lot of documentaries but I became enthralled in the story  and tragic life of the main character. This is one of my favorite movies now I am glad my friend brought it over to watch.,1283731200,4,288,4.142857142857143
8399061,5,B003KWWDIC,"Great documentary,  it just puts it out there with no bias, shows it all:  the good, bad, scary and light heartedness even of being bat shite crazy obsessed with a performer.  I came into this film with no real idea,  thinking for the most part that they would be harmless obsessives but the level of delusion and addiction was very scary.  I kept thinking, so what happens when they feel betrayed by their target... what happens when they feel the target has cheated on them?  well, we've seen what they can do, happens all the time now, the fans killing/attacking the stars.  What also came thru was how absolutely entirely miserable these people were.  I felt sorry for them.  There also was the shocking moment when one obsessive moves onto another target to stalk, after decades of 'faithfulness'.  would love to know the psychology of that  moment.

anyway, a great, touching, sad and alarming look into these peoples delusions and motivations.",1527206400,,950,4.832298136645963

8399067,4,B003KWWDIC,"I have been a true fan.  I have traveled across state lines and even crossed oceans to see my favorite bands (that's another story of course), but there is a point where you have to balance between what is really happening and what is just a fantasy.  There are some out there who are unable to separate themselves from this fantasy world, make it all about them, and are just absolutely, positively, bat s*** crazy.  Here we meet two people, Jeff and Kelly, who are clearly unstable, lonely, and rather sad.  They have hitched their wagons to 80s pop princess Tiffany who claim spiritual connections to her.  Jeff has been diagnosed with autism, lives on disability, and spends his days seeking out people to lecture about God, Tiffany and conspiracy theories.  Kelly is a struggling transgendered person who has been popping hormones for years, doesn't like himself very much, and never quite explains himself to others as to why he loves Tiffany so much.  This documentary was more depressing rather than uplifting as I'm sure that viewers will determine.  Jeff and Kelly get together to go to a Tiffany concert in Las Vegas, but Kelly doesn't like Jeff very much but sticks with him because he doesn't have a lot of money.  Jeff is so lost in his own world that he doesn't see anything but what is before him, and truly believes that he is Tiffany's friend rather than a stalker with a restraining order against him.

It's rather sad to see two people who are so unhappy with themselves that they have latched onto a celebrity as their means of giving themselves validation.  They believe that if she loves them (which she does not), then they will be important.  Kelly does not seem dangerous, but Jeff is truly delusional.  We look at this and remind ourselves that there are people out there in the world who are lonely, unstable and living in a fantasy world.  Always remember that there are people out there who are unhappy and unable to connect to people, and decide to get lost into their own world of anger, neediness, and terrible thoughts.  You wish that somehow Jeff will awaken and say he's not going to be on this path of thought anymore and move on from it, but he never will.  I will always think of this when I hear of someone being stalked by a former boyfriend/girlfriend, that there are those who are truly so unstable and make it all about them rather than considering the feelings of the victim.  I knew a man who stalked his former girlfriend for YEARS and YEARS thinking that she would come back, and when she married another man he got violent.  Remember that stalkers make it all about them rather than the victim, even though they are saying that they just want to be friends or they are looking out for the victim's welfare.  Jeff is certainly one of these people, Kelly not so much but during the Vegas jaunt he showed himself as a user.",1418256000,,2869,4.579256360078278

I now take solace that Tiffany is not meant for those two bozos in the documentary, but for all of us Tiffany fans who have fallen hopelessly in love with her and her music.

No longer must I cry alone, in front of my candle, at the altar in my bathroom, to my CDs and LPs.  No!  I can proclaim my love to the world on Amazon.com (Prime! of course!) and let everyone know that Tiffany loves everyone, even better than Jesus!

Wait?!  Where'd everybody go?!  Mom?  Mom?",1388361600,2,584,4.284403669724771
