8112718,5,B000EQ5U6E,"I am getting deeper into the Blues Harp after playing it off and on as a side instrument for decades - I am now playing it as my main axe in a band and, and although I am no Walter, Butterfield or Smith I do play in public and people dig it. Okay - so what? This - I know the good stuff when I see it, brother, and this is the good stuff. Yes, this is not a ""how to play blues harp from scratch"" DVD. It doesn't claim to be! The title says it all, Amplified Blues Harp Demystified. This is for harpers who want to go electric or have gone electric and would like some tips on that arena from a guy who is considered among his peers to be one of the greatest authorities on the subject, period. Read the many blues harp lists, blogs, websites out there - Gary Smith is known not only as a terrific player, but the man when it comes to the history and application of guitar amps for blues harps. Great overview here of amps, mics, electric harp technique - and contrary to what others have said, there are some dandy playing tips too. I picked up something in a minute that I had been struggling with for a month. Thank you, Gary! btw, I don't know him, have never met him, have never seen him play in person, have nothing to gain here, etc. One thing that people have carped about this DVD is that Gary plays more than teaches. Got news for you - you can learn more by listening to this master play than you can by him telling you how to do it - if you open your mind and your ears. There are enough good tips here on playing to satisfy a decent harmonica player - and I cannot imagine that this would not inspire a beginner, give them a sense of what to shoot for. I could listen to this guy play for hours, so I am buying this after renting it on Netflix. If you are a beginner or wannabe - there are now tons of sources to learn how to play. Youtube. Or sign up for David Barret's incredible course online - that will keep you busy for years. Or learn the name Gussow - he will show you what to do, and the right way to do it. But don't miss getting this DVD to hear great amplified harp and get an idea of how to get ""that sound"". Here is the experience of years, here are the pearls of wisdom that can only come from that rare person who found his calling early in life and dedicated his heart, soul and life to it. Any ten minutes of this is worth the measly 20 bucks you will pay for it. Delicious! Thank you, Gary Smith!

8112719,2,B000EQ5U6E,"Gary Smith sure can play, but this will disappoint as a instructional video. The quality of the video is so poor it looks like a screen capture. That's neither here nor there where content is concerned, but come on, it's a $22 DVD. Interesting stuff about mics and harps but nothing you can't get in better detail online. ""Demystified"" is a promise too far. You can find it on Netflix. Try it there before you buy it. Lots of varied tunes to play along with - about half of the hour-long DVD. Maybe this is all there is to say about amplified blues harp. If that's what you're after, get it.",1290384000,,591,4.333333333333333
8112720,5,B000EQ5U6E,"Gary Smith is the real deal. He's one of today's greatest blues harp players, and alas, not very widely known. He's totally cool and laidback (though a bit uncomfortable in front of the camera), he knows his stuff - and the result is a video which is a sheer pleasure to watch and learn.

This video focuses exclusively on amplified harp, and covers the following:

* An overview with of some of the best-known mics, amps & harps (a quick overview of Chromatic too), including Smith's recommendations, preferences and ample demonstrations.

* Harp techniques: correct embouchure, tongue blocking, tongue flutter warble, using the mic for effects. I wish he had more techniques.

* Playing with a band.

* Copying solos from the great masters.

* A tiny bit of blues music theory.

* Various tips.

He demonstrates many of his points, so you get a clear idea of what he's talking about.

In addition there are 13 jam sessions, in various styles. That alone is worth the price of admission.

His CD, ""Blues for Mr. B"" is one of my favorite blues CDs ever. It's available on Amazon. I only wish he'd record more!!

Note that the Amazon description indicates the video is 60 minute long. This is a mistake. The main DVD is shy of 2 hours + a 20min bonus section of his performance at David Barrett's Harmonica Masterclass. (The first 5 min or so the sound is out of sync with the audio, then the song is repeated.)",1157846400,14,1410,4.577689243027889
