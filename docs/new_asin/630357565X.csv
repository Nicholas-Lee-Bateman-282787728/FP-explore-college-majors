7850192,5,630357565X,"It's Tango, It's Tango...March it out!!!

That's the tagline for this video. I loved it, and it's a lot of fun. It's instructional, and it taught me about basic Latin Dance moves... My sister stole this from my collection, than my other sister abducted it, and still has it! I bought mine from K-Mart in 1996.

The tone after-session is wonderful! The video is actually a ""Cult Classic"" in the Gay Community. They put on arobic shows using this flick! I reccomend this for anyone of any fittness level. It's a lot of fun hating on the sexy Russian co-dancer for being too pretty and fitt.",1211673600,,588,4.537735849056604
7850193,4,630357565X,"This has Giselle with Daisy on an outside basketball course doing the cardio portion. This is mostly old style aerobics. I was very disappointed that there was only 1 cha-cha & samba portion of a larger straight aerobics routines & only for 3 seconds each time done. I got this because I LOVE Giselle from Zumba... she is so young here. She teaches in slow tempo first to show you how a few times, then full tempo.
Next is the weights portion on a platform in someone's very expensive backyard pool osasis (Daisy's? The directors?) with hand weights. After is using a chair for some simple leg lifts and working on the mat for basic ab crunches, reverse sit ups, etc. It ends with a nice stretch of the neck, back, etc. with some yoga poses & basic stretches.
In  addition, Daisy teaches you about diet tips & takes you on a informative w/humorous trip through the supermarket complete with comedy music.
This is great for someone who is new to exercise & like aerobics or for a light day for those who workout regularly wanting to do it all: aerobics/weights/abs/stretch. For those who don't like old school cardio/weights workouts like me, skip it.
I gave it maybe too many stars accidentally, but Giselle does have a great personality & good body awareness, and the workout gets straight to the point, no extra talking in between. Compared to other videos, it's pretty good.

To get an idea of Giselle Roque de Escobar's personality, check out her  Giselle ABCDs for Total Body Fitness on collagevideo com for a clip since that one has the same style format.",1182124800,,1561,4.648550724637682
7850194,5,630357565X,I think this is a fun video and a fairly easy workout. It's great if you are just starting out. I find it easy to stick to.,1179100800,,123,3.5925925925925926
7850195,2,630357565X,This video does not work up to breaking a sweat.  It is for the extreme beginner who wants an introduction to working out.  They go over the steps too slow and do not spend enough time actually working out.  The dance steps are simple and few.  I bought this video because it was recommended as a dance video.  It has your typical workout moves and two very basic latin dance steps.  It is a slow going work out video that does not keep you engaged.,1064793600,4,449,4.223529411764706
