2669935,5,B000JCEB0O,"I have been in love with The Black Stallion since I was a little kid.  I watched this show as a child when it aired on the Family Channel back in the 90s and loved it then.  I was so excited when the first season came out on DVD and I received it for Christmas.  I'm an adult now, and I still love the series.  I can hardly wait for the rest of it to come out on DVD.",1173312000,3,367,3.607594936708861
2669936,5,B000JCEB0O,"WOW!  I'm so excited.  This is a wonderful series.  Good, clean entertainment for the entire family.  It starrs the great Mickey Rooney.

2669938,5,B000JCEB0O,"I'm writing this before the DVDs are even released because I was a huge fan of this show when it aired on television. This is a great show loosely based on the books by Walter Farley. Though it pulls details more from the movie than the book (main fact that comes to mind is concerning Alec's father) Still it's a great series, and I will be estatic to finally own it.",1161648000,6,368,4.197183098591549
2669941,1,B000JCEB0O,"Unfortunately I expected something a little more like the movie.  The horse was beautiful but the acting I couldn't get over how bad it was.  The episodes were of unreal happenings.  The actors were always yelling, which is the main thing I think of now when remembering anything about it. The sound was poor but I would have put up with that if the shows were okay to watch. I only could watch two episodes. Sorry to other fans, but I wish I had known before I had seen this.  I must re-watch the movie so that I can try to get this out of my mind!",1402531200,,549,4.102803738317757
2669942,1,B000JCEB0O,"I tacked this onto an order, looking for something different and kid-friendly for my 5yo.  I should have previewed it first.  The first episode starts with Mickey Rooney having what seems like a heart attack, in the hospital, etc.  It gets worse from there.  I could try to get past the terrible acting, but I just don't care about the characters or plot.  At all.  I'm going to hope my daughter forgets about the 'horse show'.  I may even hide them.  Or tell her somebody stole them.",1399420800,,484,4.482758620689655
2669943,5,B000JCEB0O,"If you're looking for a series that you can watch as a family w/o all the swearing and sex of today's shows, then this series from the early 1990's is it! It is family oriented, and holds my 2 little girls interest and me and my husband's as well! This is a family favorite of ours!",1377129600,,282,4.053571428571429
2669944,5,B000JCEB0O,"the actors are great, the storys and plotline are great! it gets off to a slow start, but after the first few episodes it really starts to come together! i would wholeheartedly recommend this product!",1374019200,,200,4.742857142857143
2669945,4,B000JCEB0O,first disc went for five hours with the numerous episodes i was so involved with the stories the five hours flew by.i am getting the other series.suitable for an older child and above complicated stories in part but great entertainment,1363737600,,235,4.9
2669946,5,B000JCEB0O,My son was excited to receive this set for a gift! He had been wanting it for awhile when he saw my daughter's.,1357862400,,111,3.869565217391304
2669947,2,B000JCEB0O,"1. Very LOOSELY based on Walter Farley's book and set in 1990's. The original book was published in 1941 and the premise that a horse while obviously an extremely well bred animally with predominately Arabian bloodlines but with no papers could be raced on any thoroughbred circuit does not update to the 1990's.
2. Old TV shows are not made to be viewed multiple times or on a large screen, so that plays into the lack of quality:  acting, production, directing, use of stock footage.
3. The biggest problem in this series is The Black is the lead character, and they never established a strong lead character: A) Suspension of all reality: They used so many different horses to portray The Black, sometimes different horses in back to back scenes.  Sorry, but horse lovers are going to know the difference between breeds, and I swear in one episode they had a huge Thoroughbred MARE and a few scenes later a Friesian!!  I'm pretty sure they were using black dye on bays, and half the time the horses still looked brown anyway. B)The Black was a huge personality and had a special bond with Alec.  There was no effort made to find a horse to bond with the actor to portray The Black.",1275350400,2,1184,4.570754716981132
2669948,1,B000JCEB0O,"I read all the black stallion books over and over growing up.  I liked the movies okay.  But this series is a travesty!  I've watched six eps of the first series and have yet to see a race (and it's not as if it starts where the book did).  They talk about racing; they seem to be on the fair circuit, which is a huge problem for me.  The acting is horrible.  They yell at each other all the time.  Alec is unbelievable.  Mickey Rooney makes William Shatner's Denny Crane look restrained.  Every plot is like an after school special.  This is not the black stallion and Alec Ramsey I grew up with and I'm not going to bother to finish this series because I'm so disappointed.  Buyer beware.",1236816000,6,690,4.271317829457364
2669949,5,B000JCEB0O,"I was so glad to find out this series has finally been released on DVD (though disappointed the company refused to allowed TVShowsOnDVD to announce it or even list the released on their site).  This is a great show I grew up watching on the Family Channel and I can still remember so many episodes from it.  A great classic for all ages, which is a rarity in this age of nothing but toilet humor and stupid pranks.

Despite the lack of features, on the whole this is a great release.  The audio and visual are great.  It has closed captions, though not as a language track so you'll have to activate them with your TV instead.  The embossed cover is really nice.  My only disappointment is that the chapter stops are very meager.  You can only jump from episode to episode rather than scene to scene.  You can't even skip the opening sequence.  While it is a nice song, after 26 episodes it can get tiring.

Still, I highly recommend this release as well as the season two set that is out.  I hope they will release season 3 to finish out the series, and maybe follow up with Rin Tin Tin K-9 Cop (which aired together with this show and I believe was made by the same company)",1186790400,7,1176,4.295454545454546
