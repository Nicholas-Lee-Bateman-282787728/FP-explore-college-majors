3076770,5,B00125WAU0,"I recently watched this version and found it most enjoyable. It follows the Pilcher novel much more closely than the other film with Landsbury which I did not like at all. She looked nothing like Penelope,in my mind I had always pictured Penelope looking more like Colleen Dewhurst, but Vanessa Redgrave and all of the cast were wonderful.",1440028800,,339,4.862068965517241
3076771,5,B00125WAU0,The Shell Seekers starring Vanessa Redgrave is exceptional. A sweeping story of three generations in England. Anyone can enjoy this fine film. Fans of Vanessa and British films will like this the most.,1429401600,,201,5.121212121212121
3076772,3,B00125WAU0,I was disappointed in this film as to the performance by Vanessa Redgrave.  After seeing her in A Rumor of Angels I think I expected the same.  She was so good in that film.  The video was delivered quickly and in great condition.,1420070400,,230,4.3023255813953485
3076773,3,B00125WAU0,"I love Rosamunde Pilcher's books.  She has an extraordinary gift with words, a poetic artist.  This DVD does not touch the beauty of this story.  The focus, even on the cover, on the glamor of Olivia & her 'glitzy' representation  is a weakness. Olivia's relationship to Cosmo was special & he was much older- not Mr. Too Handsome.  Too much valuable time wasted on Ambrose, the rat.  Much more time needed to tell the true deep relationship between Penelope & Richard.  Penelope's father is well done, but I can't believe they left out Penelope's mother, the gay, charming & loving Sophie!  There is such richness in the WWII story including Doris & Penelope's reason for 'joining up'. What a shame it's all left out.  At least Danus & Antonia are there. Sweet Antonia as a modern jealous teenager is a poor substitute.  I would not recommend this DVD as a representation fo Rosamunde Pilcher's excellent book.",1414800000,,911,4.782051282051282

3076793,3,B00125WAU0,"Vanessa Redgrave is the perfect Penelope.
Realizing it is so hard to truly adapt a novel into a film, this version leaves much of the progression out - surely due to lack of time. Great story - but felt rushed through.",1354060800,,218,4.341463414634147

3076796,5,B00125WAU0,"Vanessa Redgrave is perfectly cast in this beautiful movie about a woman looking back on her life during WWII while continuing to make a difference in the world in the present.  Set in a small English village with side trips to the Mediterranean and the seaside at Cornwall - I will watch this movie over and over just for the atmosphere, but the plot kept me entralled beginning to end.",1339977600,,387,4.5285714285714285
3076797,1,B00125WAU0,"I was looking forward to this film, as I have read The Shell Seekers many times.  I was extremely disappointed.  The story is butchered and if you hadn't read the book, I imagine you'd be very confused.  People form different images of characters in their heads.  I'd pictured Vanessa Redgrave as Penelope, and I thought she was good in the part, although instead of long thick hair, hers is thin and short.  Other characters and the story line were changed almost beyond recognition.  Nancy is much thinner than described in the book, with brown hair, and Olivia is a glamorous blond.  Olivia is living in Ibiza with Cosmo when Penelope leaves the hospital and comes to Ibiza as part of her recuperation.  Antonia is 18 years old when she meets Olivia, and is sour-faced, jealous and hostile as Olivia feared.  She is totally different from the wonderful girl in the book, smirking or scowling much of the time. So many of the wonderful details are missing.  For example, Can D'Alt is not a rustic farmhouse out in the country, but a fancy pretentious mansion surrounded by other mansions.  The big party thrown for Penelope at Can D'Alt is a glittery catered affair.  Penelope doesn't wear that beautiful embroidered Moroccan caftan with the stunning earrings of Aunt Ethel's.  She wears an unattractive dress and a red and white shawl and no earrings at all.

It is difficult fitting a book into a 2-hour film, but I was disappointed because you never see Sophie at all, nor Doris.  For economy, they're simply written out of the story.  And the painting ""The Shell Seeker"" was much smaller and was awful - no bright colors of the sea and sky, but rather dull and badly painted.  There is no magical time at Tressilick when Penelope and Richard are alone before he leaves!

I recommend NOT watching this film but reading the book again.",1338681600,,1839,4.7115987460815045
3076798,3,B00125WAU0,"I didn't like this very much, although anything beats the earlier version.  The great Vanessa Redgrave mostly hangs around looking ethereal.  21st-century blondes are cast throughout where I expected brunettes, Nancy isn't plump or petulant enough and both Richard and Danus look like Bristish wets.  Noel wasn't bad and the scenery was lovely.",1333584000,,344,5.452830188679245
3076799,5,B00125WAU0,"This 2006 production of Rosamunde Pilcher's beloved story The Shell Seekers is well-cast and is a more faithful adaptation than the 1989 adaptation starring Angela Lansbury as Penelope. Though the 1989 adaptation has been reviled as taking far too many liberties with the storyline, I would say it is worth watching if only for Angela Lansbury's performance. However, this recent adaptation starring the glorious Vanessa Redgrave as Penelope is in a league of its own. Ms. Redgrave delivers a truly gut-wrenching performance as a woman who despite having had some missed opportunities in life, and having some very ungrateful and greedy children, continues to maintain a positive outlook on life, and strives to do the right thing.

This adaptation, at a running time of 3 hours, is also much longer than the 1989 version which only ran at 102 minutes. The result is a movie that follows the book quite closely, and takes its time to develop the characters, whereas the 1989 version felt rushed and left the viewer feeling dissatisfied with the way the book was interpreted and a sense that shortcuts were taken , to the detriment of the story.

The story of The Shell Seekers deals with Penelope Keeling, who is independent and strong-willed, and though recovering from a heart attack (she is 68 years old), refuses to let her bullying children pressure her into selling some prized paintings left to her by her late father, the famous artist Lawrence Stern (played by the great Maximillian Schell). Out of her three children, only Olivia (Victoria Smurfit) is nice and loving towards her mother. The other two, daughter Nancy (Victoria Hamilton) and son Noel (Charles Edwards) are portrayed as spoiled, petulant, and greedy, constantly berating their mother for not selling the art pieces, and trying to put a guilt trip on her for being inconsiderate. They play their roles so well that I could not help but be utterly disgusted by their callousness, and felt like smacking them! Luckily, there are others who see Penelope for the kind, generous soul she is, namely daughter Olivia, and a young orphaned guest, Antonia (Stephanie Stumph), as well as part-time gardener with a secret, Danus (Lukas Gregorowicz).

The movie weaves seamlessly back and forth between the past and the present. Many parts of the movie involve the older Penelope reminiscing about her youth (played by a luminous Maisie Dimbleby), and how circumstances during WW II lead her to marrying the weak-willed mommy's boy, Ambrose (Toby Fisher), and her passionate yet brief love affair with the love of her life. I was totally engaged and absorbed by the events in the past and present, as both are told in a compelling manner, and could not help but care deeply about the young and old Penelope. Both actresses, i.e. Ms. Redgrave and Ms. Dimbleby play their roles with conviction and charisma, resulting in a fine production that I will watch many times over, and will treasure for a long time.",1310860800,,2969,4.969818913480886
3076800,4,B00125WAU0,"As another had said it follows the book pretty closely, much much better than most book to movie projects.  The cover had a different photo on it and inside was a slip of paper saying it had been copied in Mexico.  To be honest I came very close to returning it. I thought it was odd when it had the different photo.  I don't like supporting illegal things even if they are cheaper.  The movie itself was good and for the most part characters were well cast.  Redgrave does a superb job.  As always nothing matches the book but it was good and of course England is always a perfect setting.",1309564800,,590,4.27027027027027
3076801,3,B00125WAU0,"This remake of the original version with Angela Lansbury playing Penelope is really a nice and enjoyable film. I guess there are no disappointing movies as long as Vanessa Redgrave plays in them.

Many parts of the movie involve the older Penelope reminiscing about her youth (played by a luminous Maisie Dimbleby), and how circumstances during WW II lead her to marrying the weak-willed mommy's boy, Ambrose (Toby Fisher), and her passionate yet brief love affair with the love of her life. I was totally engaged and absorbed by the events in the past and present, as both are told in a compelling manner, and could not help but care deeply about the young and old Penelope. Both actresses, i.e. Ms. Redgrave and Ms. Dimbleby play their roles with conviction and charisma, resulting in a fine production that I will watch many times over, and will treasure for a long time.",1310860800,,2969,4.969818913480886
3311297,4,B00125WAU0,"As another had said it follows the book pretty closely, much much better than most book to movie projects.  The cover had a different photo on it and inside was a slip of paper saying it had been copied in Mexico.  To be honest I came very close to returning it. I thought it was odd when it had the different photo.  I don't like supporting illegal things even if they are cheaper.  The movie itself was good and for the most part characters were well cast.  Redgrave does a superb job.  As always nothing matches the book but it was good and of course England is always a perfect setting.",1309564800,,590,4.27027027027027
3311298,3,B00125WAU0,"This remake of the original version with Angela Lansbury playing Penelope is really a nice and enjoyable film. I guess there are no disappointing movies as long as Vanessa Redgrave plays in them.
Like the 80's version this one has been filmed in Cornwall, UK, as well. Wonderful locations!",1285545600,,289,4.918367346938775

It was longer than the previous version that I had with Angela Lansbury starring, but I didn't feel the emotional tug with this film as much as I did with the earlier version.  This one may be more true to the novel, and I am glad I purchased it, but I prefer the Angela Lansbury version.",1457395200,,335,4.138461538461539
