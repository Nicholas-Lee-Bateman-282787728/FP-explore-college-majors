8575300,5,B00BY8DFT0,One of the weirdest surf movies you will ever love!,1508112000,,51,4.2
8575301,5,B00BY8DFT0,"It is a simple beach movie, but a good one. I don't know why Bobby Vinton didn't star in other beach movies because he did a fine job in this movie. A great movie to add to your beach movie collection.",1469145600,,201,3.926829268292683
8575302,5,B00BY8DFT0,"Surf party was released in 1964. Starring Bobby Vinton, Patricia Morrow, and Jackie De Shannon. Fun for baby boomers who love these films.",1436140800,2,138,5.043478260869565
8575303,4,B00BY8DFT0,"I don't own the DVD, but I do know the movie having just watched it on TV. It's a quiet low-key little surf movie that doesn't try to do too much (which is a good thing as far as I'm concerned), but just moves along in a nice easy manner. It doesn't try to be all things to all people, something that plagues modern movies. It's very relaxing to watch, a nice little time capsule of time and place. Patricia Morrow is very appealing in this movie, her only leading role in a movie. She would later be on the soap opera Peyton Place. And Bobby Vinton does a very nice job in his role. A cool breezy little surf movie for people who like ""out of the way"" movies.",1435449600,4,660,4.084615384615384
8575304,4,B00BY8DFT0,"I did like this movie, but I would like it better with some kind of soundtrack if it exists.",1432166400,,92,3.8947368421052633
8575305,2,B00BY8DFT0,Low budget job ! Probably much better surf movies around for the time !  Wouldn't really recommend it to anybody !,1376611200,,114,4.428571428571429
8575306,5,B00BY8DFT0,"It is cool to see this Bobby Vinton beach party film finally show up on DVD.  Although the movie was shot in black and white, and could have been better colorized, nevertheless, Surf Party is a great addition to anyone's Sixties ""beach"" collection!",1369872000,4,248,4.767441860465116
