1634181,1,B00005NHIL,"First things first, for those that are concerned (and I'm sure you will be as I was), Toshiro Mifune is NOT playing the Yojimbo character from the Kurosawa movies. The title is purely a cash-in, though I'm not sure if it is for the modern Western market or the original title translates as such and was designed to con the Japanese market. The only other film I know of where Mifune genuinely plays the Yojimbo character is ""Ambush at Blood Pass"" which was the film the both actors completed after this one. In all respects, this is a bad film sadly. It has a few nice moments but its clear this was a commercial venture utilising the two most famous male Japanese actors and characters at the time. In all honesty, I know little about the Zatoichi character, but imagine that the original film must be far superior to this. I couldn't really recommend this film to anyone unless you're a hardcore fan of Japanese Cinema or of the two actors. There are many, many better films of the genre to choose from. Even ""Ambush at Blood Pass"" which is not a great film is still significantly superior to this one. ""Zatoichi versus Yojimbo"", like many Japanese films of the time seems confused over what audience its aiming at. The result is an unsatisfactory soup of part comedy, part slasher, part period drama, part morality tale which limps from moment to moment. As said previously, some of these scenes are nice in themselves, but the overall effect is somewhat bland with some scenes almost cringe-worthy. For the uninitiated, always try a Kurosawa film first, if not (and you are interested in Samurai films from an historical perspective) then you may prefer to look at the films of Mizoguchi or Kobyashi. If you just want to see a good samurai flick with Mifune in it, then you may want to look at films such as ""Red Lion"", ""Samurai Assassin"" or ""Samurai Banners"" which are more rounded films and are currently available. As said, I don't know much about Zatoichi, but I would imagine the original and early films are better than this one and worth the effort. Still, I hope this proves useful, it would have saved me money!",1019260800,21,2124,4.621693121693122
1634182,4,B00005NHIL,"I found this movie to be a very well made entry into the Samurai Genre in general and Toshiro Mifune's recurring, hard-drinking, crafty, and irrascible ""Yohimbo"" character. Not to disrespect Katsu Shintaro, who very deftly played the Blind swordsman Zato-ichi, I'm more of a Mifune fan since I have yet to see any other actor bring a comparable presence to a Samurai flick. His dominance of personality and fighting skill is second to none, as it's pretty difficult to have both qualities in such abundance. He doesn't carry this movie, but he really doesn't have to since it's story line with its' twists and turns and comedic points are real good. It's very cool to see how Zatoichi and Yohimbo's relationship gradually developes and evolves to where they both respect each other while showing great disdain for what the other character is all about. But that still doesn't keep them from going at it in the end.
  Ultimately, as Samurai flicks go, it's an artful look into the Samurai world. It's very reminiscent of a well-made western from European culture, Although Eastern culture, to me, is much more profound. Their Samurai movies are more grounded in spiritual and moral issues. That's the key factor in determining the overall enjoyability of a movie. And this one was definitely that - As well as being a lot of fun.",1011312000,7,1328,4.845814977973569

1634184,1,B00005NHIL,"You would expect a movie like this to be much more interesting. Two renowned actors playing their seminal roles, meeting each other in an action movie reminiscent of the Clint Eastwood-Lee Van Cleef era. Instead,  the movie is tedious, dwelling on a depressed and irascible Yojimbo and a  character conflict that is more annoying than significant. When Yojimbo and  Zatoichi square off against each other, it's hard to explain why they'd  really want to -- it certainly isn't for bragging rights or honor or to  ensure that the good guys win. The ultimate resolution of the story and  discovery of the hidden treasure is somewhat interesting, I suppose, but  hardly makes it worthwhile to sit through the length of the movie. The only  real reason to see the movie is for the curiosity factor of catching  Zatoichi and Yojimbo together.

1634200,5,B00005NHIL,"Two of Japans brightest stars shine brighter still in this tale of mystery, betrayal, and sword play.  Starring Shintaro Katsu and Toshiro Mifune playing the roles they made legendary.  As the story opens we find Zatoichi seeking retirement from the cane sword and he seeks a town from his youth that is free of dice and blades (and apparently smelling of plums).  Here he meets a drunken ronin (master-less samurai) and his town overrun with corrupt politicians and yakuza.  Its up to Zatoichi and the Yojimbo (who isn't quite what he seems) to sort out the riff-raff.

This entry in the series follows alot of the same formulas as the earlier Zatoichi films but I like to think that ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"", is what Katsu and Mifune thought.  The story goes that they both got together and decided to each be in a film that the other would produce.  The result was ""Zatoichi Meets Yojimbo"" and ""Incident at Blood Pass"" (also avilable here but not as good if you ask me).

Anyway this is a good film with a great soundtrack courtesy of Maestro Akira Ifukube.  I would recommend this film for anyone who loves Zatoichi, Toshiro Mifune, or just samurai action films in general.",1276387200,,1186,4.636363636363637
1634201,5,B00005NHIL,"The fact that this movie exists, and that it is actually good, is a rare surprise.  When two characters are as popular and famous as Katsu Shintaro's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zatoichi/dp/B00073K7JY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zatoichi</a>&nbsp;and Mifune Toshiro's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yojimbo/dp/B000K0YLZ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yojimbo</a>, the temptation to throw them together into a single film is often too great to resist for movie studios, but the results are usually a disaster. They are gimmick films at their hearts.

Fortunately, this one was done right.  The 20th installment in the 26 film Zatoichi series, ""Zatoichi meets Yojimbo"" (original title ""Zatoichi to Yojimbo"", meaning ""Zatoichi and Yojimbo"", the ""meets"" was thrown in there for Western audiences), teams up two of the titans of the samurai genre, three if you count director Okamoto Kihachi (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sword-of-Doom/dp/B0007989YS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sword of Doom</a>).  There is an easy comradeship between them, and Mifune's star power does not overshadow Katsu's lead.

The story is pretty typical of the series.  Zatoichi is weary; he has broken his famous cane sword, and seeks refuge in a village he passed through some years ago.  In a nod to the original Yojimbo film, the once-peaceful village finds itself in the middle of a gang war where two rivals fight for control of the town.  Zatoichi's appearance makes him a wildcard, as both sides bid for his service.  But then into town comes a rough and ready character and apparent drunkard willing to also sell his sword to service.  The two play off of each other, circling around for the inevitable battle.  Of course, there is more to the story: The beautiful prostitute Umeno (Wakao Ayaka&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Red-Angel/dp/B000GI430E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Red Angel</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Manji/dp/B0001XAKR4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Manji</a>) is capturing both rival's hearts, a secret stockpile of gold is to be found and fought for, and a third rival comes to town in the form of Kishida Shin (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kill/dp/B000AQKUC2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kill!</a>&nbsp;) as gunslinger Kuzuryu, the nine-headed dragon.

Admittedly, the plot isn't going to win any major awards, but one doesn't really watch the Zatoichi series for the plot.  They watch it for Katsu's easy charm, and the fun familiarity that only comes with a long-running series.  Mifune's drunken swaggering is a great counterbalance to the Zatoichi character.  This isn't exactly the same character from Kurosawa's classic films, but close enough.  There is one nice in-joke, where he is referred to as Shijuro (forty-year-old), setting the character ten years after&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sanjuro/dp/B000K0YM0O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sanjuro</a>&nbsp;(meaning thirty-year-old).  The showdown between the two isn't quite as dynamic as I was hoping for, but the ending was very satisfying.

Mifune and Katsu would meet again just a few months later after the release of ""Zatoichi meets Yojimbo"", in the Inagaki Hiroshi flick&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Incident-at-Blood-Pass/dp/B00073K7KI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Incident at Blood Pass</a>.  Mifune would again reprise the Yojimbo character for this film, although Katsu was a mountain-bandit Gentetsu.  Mifune clearly was not opposed to a good team-up, as he would meet&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Magnificent-Seven/dp/B000059TFW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Magnificent Seven</a>&nbsp;actor Charles Bronson a year later in the Western&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Red-Sun/dp/B000ROAPTA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Red Sun</a>.",1234137600,,4143,7.382113821138211

1634203,4,B00005NHIL,"This 20th entry of the Zatoicihi series finds the legendary actor [Toshiro Mifune] in the role of Sasa. The character Ichi [Shintaro Katsu] is tired of killing and decides to go to the peaceful and tranquil village he rememebers in the mountains. However, this is not the same tranquil village that he last left. Sasa [Mifune] does not like Ichi at first, but eventually comes to respect Ichi in this very long [116 minutes] Zatoichi episode.

I like everything about the Zatoichi films. And what's not to like about Toshiro Mifune? One of the greatest actors ever. But this episode is more of an average to above average outing of the Zatoichi films. Maybe I came to expect too much from such outstanding persona's of the samurai cinema. The film does not disappoint as a Zatoichi film; however, with two excellent stars one would expect something greater.

This film is more part dark-comedy, and long-drama, than one is used to in most of the other Zatoichi films. And as fans of Ichi I would definetly recommend this movie. However, do not expect too much from the title--as this is more of an averge Zatocihi film. Above average considering the fact that there are some good qualities to the film, and does star the great Toshiro Mifune.  However, I did expect more of Mifune's character than he gave to the film.

1634204,5,B00005NHIL,"No other Zatoichi film compares to this one. All the actors in the film do excellent performances.

If two great actors who play two great characters who argue to each other (and laugh too) as not being funny, then I don't know what funny is.",1151712000,25,341,4.7
1634205,4,B00005NHIL,"""Zatoichi Meets Yojimbo"" is the 20th film featuring Shintaro Katsu as Zatoichi, the blind masseur by trade and gambler by nature, but the first that I have ever seen of the 27 films that were made, mostly in the 1960s and 1970s.  Like many Western viewers who come across this film it is from the perspective of familiarity with Toshiro Mifune's Yojimbo character.  However, while there are obvious similarities between Sasa Daisaku, the yojimbo (body guard) that Mifune plays in this 1970 film, I really do not find it to be the same character from 1961's ""Sanjuro"" or from the 1962 sequel ""Tsubaki Sanjuro,"" who was named Sanjuro Kuwabatake.  The key difference is that Sasa shows more emotion, is more likely to get drunk, and is not ahead of the game this time around (in other words, he has a bit of Kikuchiyo from 1954's ""Shichinin no samurai"" in him); I have seen the argument that Sasa is Sanjuro in disguise or undercover, but I am inclined not to accept the idea or the proposition that the older Mifune is playing a more world weary version of his classic samurai gangster.  Besides, the names of both characters in the title are occupational descriptions and not their given names.  Since the film is directed by Kihachi Okamoto rather than Akira Kurosawa, the match up would seem to favor Zatoichi, but do not think that this is simply some sort of samurai film version of ""Freddy vs. Jason"" that climaxes with a fight to some sort of finish.  Just appreciate going in that you are probably at a disadvantage in not knowing the background of both characters, because that is going to keep you from fully understanding this film.

Ichi, tired of the blood on his hands, returns to a peaceful village from his past, only to find that he is in the middle of yet another gang war.  On one side is Masagoro (Sakatoshi Masakane), head of the Kobotoke Clan and renounced son of Eboshiya Yasuke (Osamu Takizawa), the wealthy silk distributor who is now the other side.  Masagoro knows his father has been staling gold, so he hired Sasa to find the gold for him.  The rascally Ichi does not want to get involved, but that changes when he learns about the hidden stolen gold.  Sasa is promised a fortune for killing Zatoichi, but that does not seem as important as getting drunk.  Clearly the yojimbo feels nothing but contempt for Masagoro, and he actually seems to have feeling for Umeno (Ayako Wakao), who has been reduced to a common prostitute by her debt to Eboshiya Yasuke.  She wants the drunken yojimbo to ride the town of the yakuza and that appears to motivate him more than the money.  Of course, this puts him on a collision course with Ichi, and a swordfight between Zatoichi and Yojimbo will figure into the resolution of the story, but the key part of director Kihachi Okamoto's film are the circuitous paths by which they come to that final confrontation.

Obviously the two master swordsmen start off as enemies, and while they do not become friends it becomes clear that would never happen given their natures.  So the story rings true in that regard.  The sword fights do not come until the last act of the film, but that is necessary since once these two draw their swords that will bring things to a head and a conclusion (but notice the difference between Katoichi and Yojimbo in terms of how they dispatch the quartet of swordsmen who jump them).  As always, the film is filled with interesting supporting characters, and the one that stood out for me was Hyoroku (Kanjuro Arashi), who was once the chief of the peaceful village, but who made the mistake of hiring the Kobotoke Clan to protect the peasants during a time of famine and drought.  After the gang took over the village, he became the coffin maker for the village, carving each lost a jizo.  Still, the emphasis is on Zatoichi and Yojimbo, and it is the former, with his Columbo-like bumbling, who proves to be more central to the film than the latter, as Mifune comes across as playing his character with a hand tied behind his back.  If this were not my first Zatoichi film I might be inclined to round up, but at this point I cannot read between the lines on the character enough to justify going higher on the rating (I might change my mind after checking out some more Zatoichi films on DVD).  In terms of DVD extras there is a trailer for ""Lone Wolf and Cub"" (the series was produced by Katsu), some detailed character biographies, and some interesting liner notes that cover the history of the period and focus on the yakuza.",1149552000,63,4521,4.610972568578553

1634207,5,B00005NHIL,"A fan of Kuroswawa's YOJIMBO movies is liable to be dissappointed at the character played by Mifune in this film. Kurosawa's Yojimbo is a powerful, frightening mater of the sword. Mifune's character in this film is a down-on-his-luck samurai with a serious drinking problem and a long-time love interest. He may be tough, but he's NOT the same character at all! Beyond Mifune's signature unshaven looks and bravura style there is no reference to the Kuroswasa films (a pity!). And, as a matter of fact, the character in this movie DOES have a name.

Nevertheless, once you know what (not) to expect, this movie is a ball. It's tremedously entertaining and both of the stars are in perfect form. Okamoto's cinematography is, as always, terrific.

The film seems to have been meant to be somethign like The GOOD, the BAD, and The UGLY- an ironic instance of the imitated imitating the imitators. It falls short of that incredibly high level and perhaps shows the difference between talent and genius (although Okamoto's other films do blur that line). But if this is no masterpiece its a solid classic well worth its cult reputation. Thanks to AnimEigo for a great DVD of the one at last.",1123200000,28,1186,4.8088235294117645

1634209,5,B00005NHIL,"This is like the epic of the Zatoichi series, the blind swordsman movie to end all blind swordsman movies, even though there are still a few to come.  With not only the most complex plot of any I have watched, it is very very deep in character developement, due to the many characters involved.  The most imposing of characters is the mighty Toshiro Mifune reprising his role as Yojimbo (The Bodyguard).  With Japan's two most famous Samurai colliding in one classic movie, you just can't go wrong.  The interaction between the two is usually hilarious, as they are sometimes friends and sometimes enemies.  I guess I would agree the story is basically more about Yojimbo, but the movie as usual is Master Ichi doing his unbelievable antics.  The story revolves around two warring factions and a cache of hidden gold.  One faction is led by the elder leader of this village, and the other is led by his evil Son.  The Son hires Yojimbo in the conflict, and the Father hires Ichi.  But nothing is really as it appears, as all is revealed in the classic moralistic climax.  This is the longest of the Zatoichi series I believe, with a running time of nearly two hours.  This is a huge story, and it never ever gets boring, as the two Samurai play against each other until the end.  If I had to recommend ONE and ONLY ONE Samurai movie excluding ""The Seven Samurai"", from all the ones I have seen, it would be this movie.",1109289600,13,1418,4.517647058823529

Comparing this film to the likes of Yojimbo, Aka Hige, or The 7 Samurai isn't really appropriate.  It would be like Classic American Western to Spaghetti Western, both are western genre but not really comparable.
Toshiro Mifune (the bodyguard) and Shintaro Katsu (the blind masseur Ichi) hook up as opportunists playing two yakusa syndicates against each other. Does this sound familiar?
The predictable theme and general story line lets the really subtle relationship build between Ichi and the Yojimbo.  It evolves to be a bit more complex and fun than the typical Japanese morality play.",1084320000,6,744,5.032520325203252

The picture quality is fantastic and the movie is fun too. Katsu Shintaro turns in his usualy good performance as Zatoichi, and Toshiro Mifune is always fun to watch, especially in roles similar to Yojimbo.
This DVD has some good extras, great video, and good audio. Add all that to a good film, and there's no reason not to buy this DVD!",1063497600,9,376,4.544117647058823

7947265,4,B00005NHIL,"Toshiro Mifune and Shintaro Katsu are great as usual. This is a serious story with some tongue-in-cheek nods to earlier samurai films Toshiro had starred in, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I had already seen it many years ago, but was moved to watch it again after going to see Rogue One. I'm almost certain Rogue One is making its own nod to this movie with its characters Chirrut Imwe (a blind 'swordsman') and Baze Malbus (a 'bodyguard').",1483228800,,439,4.641025641025641
