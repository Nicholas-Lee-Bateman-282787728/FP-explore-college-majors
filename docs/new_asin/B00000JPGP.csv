1236167,4,B00000JPGP,"This film is like a bomb with a very long fuse. It starts slowly, moves at a gentle, almost maddeningly slow pace, and then suddenly rips you to shreds.
Very few WWII movies are told from the German perspective. This one has the added, almost unique advantage of having been shot 10 years after the end of the war, when the wounds of the war had not even stopped bleeding. Although it is shot on B/W film, the violence is extremely graphic and no attempt is made to spare the audience the horrible result of bullets going through human bodies. In other words, if you are looking for cartoon violence, look elsewhere. This film was written by people who understood that bullets make holes.
""Die Brucke"" is the story of six schoolchildren who are drafted into the Wehrmacht in the spring of 1945, given one day's training, and then thrown into battle when the war is hopelessly lost. A well-meaning officer and an equally human NCO conspire to have them detailed to a useless objective -- a small bridge in the little Bavarian town where they grew up and, only days before, played Cowboys & Indians. Unfortunately, the war does not pass them by, and the boys are too naive to understand that their cause is lost and that people who are shot to death do not get up and keep playing afterwards.
The young ""soldiers"" are alternately pathetic and frightening with their mixture of boyhood enthusiasm, decency, cruelty, and mischief. One minute they are playing pranks, the next cold-bloodly shooting down an American soldier who tries to get them to surrender. They grasp far too late that their elders don't care what happens to them, that they will receive no medals for their heroics, and that there are people in their own army who are bigger enemies than the Americans are.
The film may be too slow in the beginning for American audiences, but the payoff is well worth it. With an obviously limited budget and resources, director Wicke does a first-class (surprisingly graphic) job of pitting his kindergarten soldiers against American tanks and displaying the disgusting mayhem that follows. All war films are said to be anti-war films, but most American and British pics from the postwar period depict combat as a thrill-ride and the Germans as human targets who are equally sadistic and stupid. ""Die Brucke"" puts human faces on the men (often boys) in the Nazi uniform without making apologies for Nazism (this film rarely passes up a chance to scorn the Nazis who preached 'holding out to the last round' and then hopped the fastest train away from the battle). People who somehow found films like ""Where Eagles Dare"" entertaining should watch this DVD and then try to find the humor in slitting a teenage conscript's throat. I would recommend the film to anyone, but especially as an insight onto how things looked and felt on ""the other side of the hill.""",1046131200,154,2860,4.7565392354124745
1236168,5,B00000JPGP,"Now avialable on DVD, this little masterpiece of a film has, up to now, been all but forgotten. Yet it seems to have created quite a stir back in 1954 when it was released... less than ten years after the end of WWII, and already the Germans were asking themselves hard questions about war, blind adherence to authority, militarism, etc. Black and white, the DVD offers both English Dub and Sub versions of the film.  The acting is first-rate, the uniforms, weapons and sets are quite good, and the story is rivetting.
Suposedly based upon a true story, we are offered an open and painful tale, full of self-criticism and honesty.  Almost as graffic in places as Saving Pvt Ryan.

As part of their training, the boys are told it is their responsibility to defend the little bridge next to the school.  They drill with surplus helmets and other war-play gear, and practice vanquishing imaginary invaders.  At the end of the war, with the German army in full retreat, the kids believe it is their sober duty to defend the bridge.  They take their positions with their token weapons as the unsuspecting Allies cross.  Tragically, they fight bravely, but are overcome.",975628800,10,600,4.666666666666667
1236170,4,B00000JPGP,"One of the few post-war (1959) German films to depict actual combat against the Americans, ""Die Bruecke"" (The Bridge) was shot on  location in Bavaria in black-and-white with a low budget and mostly local  actors.  Still, it tells its story well and avoids the blah-blah,  angst-ridden, self-psychoanalysis that plagues much German cinema. Set in  the last days of World War Two, the film tells the story of a group of  teenage schoolmates drafted into the home guard and assigned to defend the  bridge into their village against the approaching Americans.  Their leaders  are middle-aged WW1 veterans (who recall their own combat experiences with  bitterness) and die-hard Nazi fanatics (who can't admit the war is already  lost).  In simple, realistic scenes the director portrays the futility,  confusion, terror and waste of all war, and the hopeless anarchy that  existed in 1945 Germany. A well-wrought little gem.  Too bad it hasn't  found a larger American audience.  Compares favorably with ""A Walk in  the Sun,"" which is at least available on VHS.",967075200,14,1057,5.153846153846154

1236195,5,B00000JPGP,"I liked very much this 1959 German war movie, which didn't age at all in 55 years. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

The action of this film takes place in the very last days of Word War II, on 27 April 1945, barely three days before Hitler suicide. The place of action is a small German town, in which people  try to cope with hardships of war time life the best they can, when in the same time the war is mercilessly advancing towards them - indeed, American troops are not far... It is at that moment that seven young local boys, none older than 16, receive their mobilisation notices. Those seven characters are:

- Hans Scholten (Folker Bohnet)
- Albert Mutz (Fritz Wepper)
- Walter Forst (Michael Hinz)
- Jurgen Borchert (Frank Glaubrecht)
- Karl Horber (Karl Michael Balzer)
- Klaus Hager (Volker Lechtenbrink)
- Sigi Bernhard (Gnther Hoffmann)

Obeying the orders, they report to the barracks, and receive uniforms and weapons, and after only one day they are afected to guard the bridge in the middle of their own town. What they don't know is that the bridge is not supposed to be defended at all, just  to be destroyed and then the troops are to withdraw further east - in fact, their commanding officer gave them this ""mission"" to take them out of harm's way, seeing no reason to waste young lifes in the last days of a lost war. But the fate will decide otherwise...

This is a very good film, with solid scenario and very well filmed battle scenes. It was very deservedly nominated for the Oscar of Best Foreign Language Film in 1959 - it was facing tough competition as another excellent war film, Italian ""The great war"", was also nominated, but very sadly neither of them won.

""Die Brucke"" is a black and white film but it absolutely doesn't hurt it, in fact, it gives it a unique special charm - which is COMPLETELY ABSENT from the pathetic 2008 remake, a horribly lame thing I sincerely advise to avoid!

This film is based on a novel written in 1958 by Gregor Dorfmeister, who actually survived a somehow similar experience himself in 1945. The film was made by Austrian director Bernhard Wicki, a man who had all reasons to hate Nazi regime, as during WWII he spend some time in Sachsenhausen concentration camp - when he was released, he ultimately escaped to Switzerland in 1944.

Even if the story is heart-breaking and war is portrayed here in all its merciless cruelty and also sometimes petty stupidities, as far as I am concerned and unlike what can be sometimes read about it, I do not really see this film as a great pacifist and anti-militarist manifesto. It is anti-war, that much is certain (NOBODY is pro-war), but anti-militaristic it is not - in fact it is surprisingly intelligent and moderate everytime when real soldiers appear - on both sides.

German soldiers are a tough, battle-hardened lot, quite cynical also, but none of them - and especially none of the officers and NCOs - want to see those young boys die. In fact they ALL want them to survive and ALL try to take them out of harm's way...  And once the fight is joined and American soldiers realise that they are facing children, they will also try to stop the massacre and keep the butcher bill low. In fact, unlike in so many more recent - and much, much less intelligent - films, REAL soldiers act in this film quite humanly and reasonably.

It must be also said, that all pacifist that he was, Bernhard Wicki was also a guy and therefore he simply COULDN'T resist playing with cool military toys - and as result those seven hastily conscripted Volkssturm soldiers pack IMPRESSIVE heat! Panzerfausts were indeed widely available and generously distributed in 1945 but very few (if any) seven man strong Volkssturm squads would have not one but TWO (!) MG-42 general purpose machine-guns! Even more stunning, one of those younglings carries (and uses in fight ) a Sturmgewehr 44 (the direct ancestor of AK-47), which in 1945 was THE most modern and the most powerful weapon an infantryman could lay his hands on (and in this film it is a real, full-blooded StG44 that we see, NOT its ersatz poor-cousin, the Gustloff Volkssturmgewehr).

The Volkssturm troops never received such powerful rifles - in fact they faced a shortage of infantry weapons and many of them went to battle armed with antiquated rifles or even hunting shotguns! The boys in the film however were lucky to get one fully automatic StG44 and six standard issue Mauser 98 rifles, in addition to two MG42s and a generous supply of Panzerfausts. I must precise that it is NOT A CRITICISM - to the contrary, I am glad the director ""up-graded"" this little Volkssturm squad, because it makes for some impressive military porn!

For an anti-war film this movie shows also one helluva battle! Sorry for the SPOILER here, but those seven younglings will fight like tigers and the poor Americans, who thought that war is more or less over and were confident in the armor of their tanks, well, they are in for a big surprise in this film... The long, bloody and merciless bridge fight in this film is a TERRIFIC battle scene, one of the best I ever saw!

So bottom line, this is an EXCELLENT war film which is also a very good and very intelligent anti-war film. Tragic, heartbreaking but also impressive. A rare thing which is a must for all amateurs of war movies AND also for all pacifists. Go get it, enjoy the military porn and cry over fallen little heroes - and I guarantee that you will never forget this great film!",1396915200,3,5511,4.626407369498465

1236209,5,B00000JPGP,"This is a powerful anti-war film told from the German perspective.  Unfortunately, it is also history.  At the end of the war,underage boys straight from Hitler's Jugend indoctrination are sent off to battle along with elderly and crippled men.  Germany is literally scraping the bottom of the barrel.  Many regular Wehrmacht soldiers put up desperate last ditch stands but usually had the experience to recognize when it was time to retreat or surrender.  Less so the Hitler's Jugend boys.  There were times when children literally prevented more experienced soldiers from retreating at gunpoint, which is alluded to in one of the last scenes of this film.  Theirs--according to their true-believer training--was to do or die and, unfortunately, many of kids died exactly as depicted in this film.

The first part of the film is slow, letting you get to know our boys and their families before they are ordered into the military.  The intent is, clearly, to give the viewer a personal feeling about the humanity of these star crossed teenagers.  We get to see boys of different economic circumstances; some from troubled homes.  We see boys filled with naive patriotism, 'Fur Volk und Vaterland.'  They are told that even one inch of precious German soil is worth their lives--and--the boys believe it.  Still they're only boys.  One poignant scene has the boys shooting and throwing rocks at tin cans perched on 'their' bridge as a preamble to military action.  They think it's an activity that readies them for battle.

At the same time the boys are genuinely dangerous precisely because they don't have the sense or training to pull back when the situation warrants.  They defend their inch of the Vaterland.  The battle scene is intense with considerable realism.  Two Sherman's are destroyed by panzerfausts and the tanks are destroyed exactly as advertised i.e. a small entrance hole through armor; a short delay: and then the thing explodes like the death trap it was.  Men and boys go down with wounds that have ripped out entire parts of their bodies.  It isn't glorious.  One humane American soldier, recognizing that he is fighting children, tries to get them to surrender but makes the mistake of calling them 'Kindergarten kids'.  One immature boy, hugely offended by the insult, mows him down.  An interesting film.",1337040000,5,2330,5.023498694516971

They are ordered by their commander to guard the bridge, which keeps them from the fighting on the Americans on the distant front line.  It was done (unbeknownst to the kids) to save their lives.  But the Americans illogically come down their road to their bridge.  The teenagers think they have to guard the bridge to save the lives of their families, friends, and retreating German soldiers.

They fight to the death, over a worthless bridge that the Americans didn't want anyway and retreat from.  But the teenagers didn't fight for Hitler, or Nazi ideology.  They fought because they had a sense of honor. They fought and died for those they loved.

Their faith and belief in their misson is such that they fire at the demolition squad ordered to blow up the bridge, setting the stage for the finale battle.

1236234,4,B00000JPGP,"""Die Brucke"" or ""The Bridge"" is a powerful 1959 West German anti war film directed by Austrian director Bernhard Wicki depicting the last waning days of the Third Reich.  In a small provincial town a group of seven naive and idealistic 16 year old schoolboys seem unaffected by the approaching impending onslaught of the advancing American army. With great enthusiasm they're only too happy to be enlisted into the ragtag remains of the decimated German army.

The day after their conscription they are thrown into the fray without any training to defend their town against the advancing army.  In a sympathetic gesture their commanding officer orders them to defend an unimportant bridge slated for subsequent demolition to keep them out of harm's way.  Their protective squad leader is mistakenly killed by military police before he can order them to abandon their position.

With an unrelenting, patriotic fervor they defend the expendable bridge against a superior force that ultimately and pointlessly cuts them down.

This disturbing movie chronicles the horrific destruction of a whole generation of gullible, immature and malleable youth who were seduced by an ideology that used them as unsuspecting cannon fodder.",1199145600,4,1223,5.310880829015544

1236237,4,B00000JPGP,"Other reviewers have praised this film at length, so I don't have much to add there.  However, none of the other reviews addresses the question of how the DVD itself looks.  Here are my impressions:

This DVD was made by a small company called Belle & Blade, which mainly distributes war movies released by other home video companies.  I'm a little apprehensive of buying DVDs from such companies because they sometimes border on bootleg quality.  (I won't name names.)  Happily, this release of ""The Bridge"" is a pleasant surprise.  While not in pristine condition, the print is very good, with excellent contrast and sharpness.  The DVD is not progressively encoded, but it looks fine on regular tube TVs.  (You may see some blurriness during action sequences if you watch it on a computer or another HD source.)  For a DVD originally released in 1998, it holds up well.

It's worth pointing out that Belle & Blade has transferred two separate versions of ""The Bridge"":  the original 102-minute German-language cut and the slighly abbreviated 100-minute English dub.  There are some differences between the two, and I prefer the German-language original.  My biggest complaint is that you can't turn off the subtitles when you watch the German-language version.  In my opinion, all subtitles ought to be optional -- that's simply one of the advantages of the DVD medium.  (And other reviews are correct:  the subtitling is not completely accurate.  But it's not bad.)

Furthermore, ""The Bridge"" has been such an important and influential movie (particularly in Germany) that it deserves an extra feature or two.  Belle & Blade has thoughtfully included the intro by Chet Huntley that accompanied the film's showings in the United States in 1960.  (It's of historical interest because Huntley sets the film up as a rejection of totalitarian government, with anti-Communist overtones.  That's an obvious misreading.  ""The Bridge"" is primarily about the contrast between youthful idealism and the brutal reality of war, and it can be read as an out-and-out anti-war film.)  Still, it would have been nice to hear a military historian provide a commentary track, or perhaps a current German director or critic could have been interviewed about the film's importance.  Not to mention that most of the actors who portrayed the boys are still alive and working.

With the above caveats, I recommend this DVD.  I don't know if Belle & Blade's other releases are of similar quality, but you should have no worries about this one.  I do think that the Amazon price is much too high, though, so keep an eye on the Marketplace sellers.",1159747200,22,2625,5.013888888888889
1236238,4,B00000JPGP,"Yes, the movie starts slowly and builds, but this is fairly routine for foreign films of the era.  The Bridge was made on an extremely low budget and the movie reflects this, with the homemade tanks at the end being almost comical in their appearance.  Still, the story overpowers the movie's short falls.  If you're a student of German WWII history or an enthusiast, this is a ""must have"" movie.  I would like to see a major motion picture in the league of ""Stalingrad"", ""Downfall"" or ""Das Boot"" done with The Bridge.  The book places more emphasis and details on the battle at the bridge which the movie kind of moves quickly over, but again, I think this was a production and cost issue when the movie was made.  If someone doesn't make a big screen big budget remake of this movie, they're missing a golden opportunity.",1140739200,10,823,4.5646258503401365

1236240,3,B00000JPGP,"THE BRIDGE is a fine B&W WWII movie that is set in a village deep in Western Germany. All of the action occurs the last week of April, 1945.
This Movie is unique because of the time, location, and entirely German perspective of this tiny War story.
The eight kids who are assigned to guard, then defend, the bridge are 16 year olds. The climatic battle with the American Armored patrol is very well done (for the most part). What is interesting is that, because this is a German made film, the American soldiers and Sherman Tank gunners are all very bad shots (except for an American sniper with a scoped rifle). Where as in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (an American made film), the German Wafen SS troops and Tiger Tank gunners who attack the bridge at Ramelle are also very bad shots!
Still the action is riveting for a low budget, foreign film. Unfortunately, the viewer has to wait an hour for the final battle, because most of the picture is character development, and it consists largely of teenagers yelling at their parents, which can be very obnoxious to listen in German dialouge.",1060819200,20,1081,4.606217616580311
1236241,5,B00000JPGP,"Jean Yanne (french cinematographer/writer/actor, now living in California) made the only pun I know which can be translated in about 10 languages -and understood around the world-: ""As well the smallest unit in length is the millimeter, as well the smallest unit in weight is the milligram, as well the smallest unit in intelligence is the military.
Boris Vian, another french cinematographer/writer/musician (d. 1958), said the only way to get rid of military people would be to gather them on a very large meeting place rigged to be blown up, but also said there would still be a problem: getting rid of the one(s) in charge of the fuse.
If this movie was shown in every school to every kid 13/16 old, anyone wanting afterwards to join the army for the fun of it (or even for the glory) should be categorized as a very sick jerk and get cold showers in a straight-jacket for at least 5 years, and, if not cured, be used as compost.
I saw this movie when it was released in Paris in 1960 (I was 16), and have since recommended it relentlessly as the 1st war movie to be watched, since it's the only one I've seen which unmasks in the most accurate way the insanity/irresponsibility of trigger-happy warmongers, as well as irresponsible manipulation of young minds by people who should not be in charge of anything, not even themselves.",1054684800,18,1336,4.665254237288136

7913021,5,B00000JPGP,"I don't have to review this since there are some here but DAMN, this has to be the most accurate movie out of those where children were forced/volunteered to fight part of military who still believes the war is already lost but consumed by propaganda. The children has always been true victim to propaganda since their minds are still developing.

Anyways, the movie.

It started off slowly but as soon as it reaches the climax, it never fails to shock you (as Come and See has in 1985 which affected millions in Eastern Europe to receive medical and psychological help) and (Beast of No Nation which erupted support of children forced/volunteered to fight in armies in Africa). The German kids still believed they'll win the war but that war broke them so much they'll never gain innocence again. The GIs and tanks were spot-on especially with low-budget.

What you'll never seen before is a boy's face full of mud, dirt, blood and tear as he saw his comrades experienced not even full-scale hell of war. When a GI shouted at them to go home and berated them by calling them kindergarten, one kid on MG42 replied with bullets at him. In the end, the children discovered the true enemy has not been the Americans...

The gore is spot-on when a man received fire from rear of a panzerfaust, some gunshot wounds, a MG42 round ripping out a GI's intestines.

I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in watch children fighting in wars and who wishes to look through the eyes of the kids in hell.

7913025,3,B00000JPGP,"This isn't a bad war movie, especially considering when and how it was made. It has an evocative atmosphere, with fog and smoke swirling about, especially at night, adding to the terror of guarding a bridge waiting for the enemy to show up. The first half hour is decidedly tedious. Yes, it's true the story needed to establish the background of small-town German youngsters being dragooned from their semi-idyllic into becoming cannon fodder for the Nazis to slow down the Allied advance. But it went on too long.

The movie redeems itself with the battle scenes, which are nicely done, although I've never seen American tanks who look anything like the armored vehicle used here. The premise behind the battle is hard to understand. Evidently to protect these youngsters, who were drafted literally the day before and received almost no training, they're assigned to an experienced corporal who is told to have them ""guard"" a small bridge (in their own hometown) which is going to be blown up anyway in 24 hours, right after the first American tanks have crossed over. Presumably this will minimize exposing them to danger at a time when the war was fast approaching its end anyway.

First, I don't get why you'd blow the bridge AFTER some of the enemy has crossed over. This isn't sound defensive strategy.

Second, assigning these 7 ""kids"" to a bridge which is known about to be approached by substantial enemy forces, including armor, is hardly keeping them out of harm's way.

Third, evidently they gave no written orders to the corporal, who is waylaid in the town when he goes looking for ""coffee"" by military police who are probably going to execute him, so he runs and then gets shot down dead. If the corporal had written orders he would have avoided these consequences, which left the 7 kids entirely unsupervised.

Fourth, there is a demolitions unit assigned to the bridge but they're hiding in a basement in the town, watching for the first Yank tanks to cross, and while they know the kids are guarding the bridge, they do nothing to try to communicate with them. In fact, they express frustration during the valiant fight between the kids and the Americans, lamenting that the Wehrmacht WANTS some Ami tanks to cross but the kids are doing such a good job fighting they're holding up the enemy advance.

Fifth, it's unreasonable that these youngsters would handle themselves so well. Sure, they might have had the spirit and boldness of youth but where did they learn to shoot automatic rifles, machine guns and panzerfausts? There's no indication they could have learned all this in their ONE AFTERNOON of military training. (It's mentioned repeatedly they were all called up just the day before.)

The acting quality is mixed. There's a bit too much melodrama at times, especially in scenes involving soldiers being injured or killed. A couple of the scenes are laughingly bad, as when one boy discovers his father in bed with the fraulein that he moons over himself.

All in all, well worth watching once, and certainly notable when considered in context of when and how it was filmed.",1442707200,2,3105,4.845283018867924
