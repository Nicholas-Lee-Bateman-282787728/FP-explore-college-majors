The Gomi vs Penn fight alone is worth 14.99. Then throw in Tank vs Cabbage II, and Lindland vs Frykland, and its well worth the price. This is awesome that ROTR is putting this out.  Also the fight with Riggs vs Kendall Grove is interesting to see, Kendall before he was on TUF....buy this one quick guys, you don't want to miss out!!",1204588800,4,478,4.230769230769231

8247981,5,B0012VCMT8,Tank is one of my all time favorites glad I could find this DVD at a great price!,1433289600,,81,3.5555555555555554
8247982,4,B0012VCMT8,Haven't finished all the events yet but the first couple are good with some excellent fighters.  It is nice to see some of the fighter you see on UFC event in earlier fights in there careers.,1403654400,,191,4.305555555555555
8247983,5,B0012VCMT8,"Great cheap 5 event set that has a lot of fights from fights before they were big. My favorite fight is the Bj Penn vs. Takanori Gomi. That fight alone is worth it. It was right after BJ Penn left the UFC, so the were #1, and #2 respectively.",1368662400,,242,3.9591836734693877
8247984,5,B0012VCMT8,"ROTR once was Hawai'i's number one MMA orgainization. This set will definitely prove why. Of the five fighters on the cover (Anderson Silva, Jake Shields, BJ Penn, Tank Abbott, and Tankanori Gomi), only one fights more than once (Penn fights Gomi and Rodrigo Gracie), giving a lot of variety where none normally exists. Among the other notables on this disc, you have TUF 3 winner Kendall Grove, Matt Lindland, Carlos Condit, Royler Gracie, Joe Riggs, Gilbert Melendez, and Cabbage Correira. The quality wasn't all that bad, and the fights were what you would expect from a smaller promotion; the fighters who enter the cage are in it to win it. This event set is very much worth your time. The only thing that disappointed me is that the Welterweight tournament's finals at ROTR 9 were not included and are not on DVD anywhere that I could tell; if anyone knows where it is, let me know.",1295654400,,888,4.698717948717949
8247985,5,B0012VCMT8,"Many soon-to-be well known MMA stars, great fights with very few ""dogs"", and a lot of content for the money. I'm good-to-go on this one...",1284249600,,138,4.56
8247986,4,B0012VCMT8,"Fantastic 5 disc set for under 15 dollars that I can't gush enough about. You get the epic BJ Penn/Takanori Gomi bout and just a whole slew of other MMA stars fighting before they made the ""big time."" Dana White even gets some microphone time as these events were something he deemed worthy to see.

Realistically, this may not be something for the only UFC fanboys, but to the initiated - grab this before it goes out of print. Check the roster of fighters: BJ Penn, Takanori Gomi, Gilbert Melendez, Jake Shields, Carlos Condit, Joe Riggs, Matt Lindland, Frank Trigg, Anderson Silva, Yushin Okami, Cabbage, Kendall Grove, etc.

All the fights here are not worthy of my hyperbole, but if you like MMA fights, you can't beat the value here.",1278720000,,739,4.676923076923077
8247987,3,B0012VCMT8,"I got this collection because I like to watch MMA.  BJ Penn is one of my favorite fighters.  Gomi vs Penn is a classic.  A few bad things tho, the sound quality on some of the earlier ROTR is horrible.  The camera angles are crappy at times.  During the Rodrigo Gracie vs BJ fight, the camera looks into the crowd(during a fight) instead of THE fight ARRGGHHH!!!  Other than that it was an ok collection.  If you are a casual MMA fan, I wouldn't recommend it because there are a lot of fighters that you may not have heard of.  For hardcore MMA fans only.  Hawaii in the HOUSE!!!",1220313600,,579,4.238532110091743
8247988,5,B0012VCMT8,I have been wanting to get these hard to get fights for a long time. The price was great! I am very happy with this video set.,1211846400,,126,3.7037037037037037
8247989,4,B0012VCMT8,"I just received these last week and while I was disappointed in the quality and some of the match ups, the price makes them worth while. ***NO SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW***

The Good: The production quality, fights, and recognizable fighters get better with each event. Notable names from Pride and the UFC show up more and more frequently (Penn,Gomi,Gracie's,Tank,Cabbage,Kimo,Trigg,Silva etc.). Hawaiian rules allow for knees on the ground, ouch. Lot's of fights, each event about 2 hrs. each. Great value.

The Bad: Still nowhere near Pride/UFC quality dvd's (better than King of the Cage dvd's). Early events are mostly unfamiliar Hawaiian fighters (granted the event is in Hawaii) that aren't all that great and make for some lackluster fights. The referee makes some questionable calls. He'll stop the fight alot to check cuts that aren't that bad and stand up fights when there's action on the ground. He looks like a poor mans John McCarthy.

The Ugly: The commentary on ROTR 4 is absolutley awful, among the worst I've ever heard, but it get's better with each event. The atrocious editing and camera work in ROTR 6. In the main event Penn vs. Gracie, the camera man moves from the fight, not once but TWICE to see a fight in the audience when the main event fight is still going!!! And the fight before that one has a great TKO finish but we don't get to see it as we're given a nice shot of the referees butt in front of the action. Both of these screw ups thanks in part to the wise decision to have only one camera shooting the action. Can you say amateur hour? The pre fight interviews on ROTR 7 are hilariously bad too.

The Verdict: I can't tell you how disappointed I was when I fist popped in ROTR 4. The audio/video quality was terrible, the majority of the fights were no names and boring and I thought I'd been suckered in to buying a KOTC clone. But the events, fights, and production quality really do get better with each event. I'll save you some time on ROTR 4, just watch the Paul Buentello fight and the Penn/Gomi main event. The Penn/Gomi fight is awesome and one of the better fights you'll find anywhere. The price saves this set and warrants a recommendation. If it cost much more, the rating would only go down.",1208217600,7,2241,4.595
8247990,5,B0012VCMT8,"I seriously can not imagine why you would pass on this. A outstanding package, 5 events for under $10 (currently). This wouls still be a bargain at $40, in my opinon. Unlike a lot of the current wave of lesser known (i.e. non-Pride or UFC) releases, this one really delivers with quality fights and a ton of ""known"" fighters. It doesnt feel cheap and isn't loaded with a ton of poor quality fights just to bulk up runtime (I'm looking at you King Of The Cage). As someone else mentioned, the Penn/Gomi fight is worth the price of admission alone, but there is so much more here. I'm shocked at how little this is selling for, and really encourage any MMA fan looking to branch out, or looking for something to tide you over until the next Pride/UFC release, to purchase this. You cant go wrong, and I PROMISE you won't feel burned like I have in the past with other ""bulk"" MMA releases (Cage Rage, KOTC, etc). This is pure quality and I am really happy to have in my collection. BUY THIS!!!",1207872000,14,990,4.385869565217392
