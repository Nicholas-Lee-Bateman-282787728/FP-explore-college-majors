1409657,5,B000059TP9,"This has to be one of my favorite parts of being a Sailor Moon fan ever! To have all three of the Sailor Moon movies at home, and what's even better, they're all dubbed in English. Although the movies and the shows are better in Japanese, I perfer English for my little sister's sake. She loves Sailor Moon but can't read the subtitles very fast (that's because she is distracted by the movie). So my mom has to read it to her. But don't get me wrong! I love these movies. Sailor Moon R - The Promise of the Rose is my favorite. But the rest of you Sailor Moon fans can decide for yourself which one you like best. It's a great sereis to have, especially if you are a huge SM fan like me (that's why I picked my name)!",996796800,6,718,4.063380281690141
1409658,5,B000059TP9,"The first one has a lot of flashbacks to explain what was going on in the present, the second one made me cold because of the snow princess, but it was cool to see Luna as a human, even if it was only for one night. The third is the best. The Outer Senshi (excluding Sailor Saturn) appear and fight off the Sugary Dream faes and defeated Badiyanu. (With help from a good Sugar-Dream fae.) I saw all of the third movie, but only half of the other two. I saw all three in Japanese. They were subtitled, but oh, so hard to read. Even in wierd language, they were terrific. Now, to buy the ones in ENGLISH...",992563200,2,604,4.127118644067797
1409659,5,B000059TP9,"Sailor Moon gets a bad rap for being too girlie or too sugary and not enough Dragonball Z-y.  Sailor Moon IS a great anime and here's why: Its funny-the animations, reactions, storylines and interactions are humorous for just about everyone. Especially the subtitled movies. Great stories-With the exception of the Sailor Moon S movie about Rini and the children getting abducted by this piper,they have great story lines that could give any studio film a run for their money.  Great role models-These characters are role models for anybody of any age. They are all different with different strengths and weaknesses giving them depth and realism. I reccomend these for anyone, especially someone who wants to delve into anime and doesn't know where to start!",992131200,,758,5.104838709677419
1409660,5,B000059TP9,"My older sister got each of the tapes in this so I have seen each of them, and they are really good. Plus the fact that all three are in a box set is really cool, and since my sister took each of the tapes with her when she moved out I want to get this so I will have my own set because I don't see her very often, so I don't see the tapes very often. So this set is a total must have for a Sailor Moon fan. '.~",991872000,,411,3.4782608695652173
1409661,4,B000059TP9,"Well, people may be disappointed for this since this is in edited dubbed format.  But to be honest, it's not really that badly dubbed!  Pioneer did a VERY good job when translating the script, with practically NO changes!  And the editing jobs were minimal, but understandable.
For example, one of the edits is when the original opening theme is replaced with screen shots of the movie with the English dubbed opening.  It's a neat sequence of screen shots, but I don't understand why Pioneer didn't just slap the theme song over the Japanese one.
Another one is the music replacement.  The majority of the background music is replaced with DiC's synthesized music.  It doesn't sound really all that bad, but the original stuff is more pleasing to the ear.
And of course, the scene removals.  Scenes that were thought to be too violent were removed from these movies.  Some of the edits are questionable, but some are understandable.
Some of the treats are that the majority of the original dub voice overs have returned to do these movies, and they did a very good job by providing their talents to these films.
My personal favourite is Sailor Moon R, but I also enjoy Sailor Moon S and Sailor Moon SuperS.  And it would be a great package for any young Sailormoon fan to enjoy!
For the older fans, they can either purchase the uncut subtitled edition, or the special uncut DVD, which includes the uncut version of the dub, along with the original music and no scenes removed!  At a price like this, it's a great buy!",985132800,8,1518,4.651685393258427
1409662,5,B000059TP9,"The fist movie in the Sailor Moon Trilogy is Sailor Moon R: The Promise of the Rose. It is an interesting love story with an interesting turn of events. An old friend of Dariens, a alien named Fiore, returns to earth. When he finds out that Darien cares for Serena more than him he tries to Destroy eveything on Earth. The second movie is Sailor Moon S: Hearts in ice. In this film an evil snow witch, princess Kaguya, tries to freeze over the Earth and turn it into a dark desolate Place. Meanwhile Luna has fallen in love with Kekiru, an astrloger who belives there is a Moon Princess. And the third movie is Sailor Moon Super S: Black Dream hole. In this fairy tale like version of Sailor Moon, A witch Named Badiyanu is trying to steal all of the Pink Sugar Heart Energy From the Children of Earth. But her main target is Rini, Sailor Mini Moon. Can the Sailor Scouts Save her? This trilogy is the best three movies I have ever seen. So join Sailor Moon, Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, Venus , Neptune, Uranus, Mini Moon and Pluto in these amazing movies",982454400,16,1051,4.36734693877551
7934336,5,B000059TP9,I have been a Sailor Moon fan since I was a child. I love this series and I was super excited to find this original set. The movies work great in a VCR.,1457049600,,152,3.6363636363636362

7934338,5,B000059TP9,"i got this for my friends birthday as a ""joke"" present because when we were little we were obsessed with sailor moon. it was very inexpensive and it looked so cute in the box set. def would reccomend for sailor moon fans who have not seen the movies!",1225843200,,250,4.229166666666667
7934339,5,B000059TP9,"The dream box set is awesome. All of the movies have happy endings, and the stories are great. If you buy this set I think you will very much injoy it.",1033171200,,151,3.903225806451613
7934340,5,B000059TP9,"My daughter loves Sailor Moon so I brought her these videos, she made me watch them with her. I wasn't to happy about it but I did anyway and i found myself crying at them with her. The Brilliant music mixed with the amazing graphics was breath taking it all went together so well it had our emotions going. I advise a box of tissues there are some really sad and sweet bits in all these films. I think that the first one has the best effect with the music mixed with a scene, the second one my daughter tells the creator of sailor moon helped with it, and the last one has definatly the best graphics and drawings and the best story. We love these videos and would never part with any of them. Incredible vewing not really for boys though.",1018569600,6,740,4.21830985915493
7934341,5,B000059TP9,"Well, let me just say that these videos are brilliant. I have watched them so many times! My favourite is, well, all of them. In the first one, the cassinians are trying to take over Earth, and Sailor Moon and the Scouts go to space to stop them. Something happens and Serena is forced to use Silver Crystal Power. I won't say more.
In the second one, an ice witch wants to freeze Earth. Sailor Moon and the Scouts say they will not give up. Serena must use Silver Crystal Power, I won't say more.
In the third, Badiyanu is kidknapping children and is using their dream energy to take over Earth. They take Rini, so Sailor Moon and the Scouts go after her. Sailor Moon must follow Rini to death to save her. It is very emotional. They all are.
They are MUST haves. I love the Sailor Scout's powers in the last one.
Buy it.",1011139200,,822,4.24203821656051
7934342,4,B000059TP9,"This is one of the best boxed sets ever! Three of the greatest Anime movies ever! First is Sailor Moon R, Promise of the Rose, excellent story! Simply brilliant! Then Sailor Moon S, Hearts In Ice, very interesting plot and character design! And my favourite, Sailor Moon SS, Black Dream Hole, this one is by far my highest in regard, with entertainment from beginning to end. I've never seen anything like it! If you like the series, you'll LOVE the movies!",1010102400,,457,4.654320987654321
7934343,4,B000059TP9,"Hey all you Sailor Moon lovers out there! I bought this set after not watching Sailor Moon for 3 years and the first thing I thought was WOW! this is something I missed. I didn't really like the first movie. It had NO plot what so ever. but in the second movie the action starts!!!The third movie was sort of, well, it had the coolest plot out of all of them but it missed romance like the rest of them but it shows how much Serena loves Rini.
So all you guys ad girls who haven't watched Sailor Moon for a long time, give this a try.
It's not as old as you think it is.
P.s. Buy DUBBED IN ENGLISH. I think you'll probably understand it better!!!!",1005350400,,647,4.0625
7934344,5,B000059TP9,"I don't own this set, but I saw all 3 movies dubbed into English.
All of these movies are the best movie I have ever seen!
All 3 movies are very good.
But, my personal favorite is Black Dream Hole.",1002499200,,197,3.95
