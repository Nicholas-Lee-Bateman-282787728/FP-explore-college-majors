First are numerous kama vs bo suburi or one-step, that seems to be what was the only training around at one time, at least for kama.  Then 1 kama kata & applications, then 1 bo kata with applications/bunkai (however, the bunkai are only remotely related to the technique int he kata, then going on to other potential moves that the technique could lead to but that aren't in the kata).  Somewhere, I've read that it was corrections, of what not to do, but I think that was a comment made by someone who just assumed since they were diferent from the kata, that they were correcting mistakes, rather than expanding the further potentials from the technique.  Also though, the bo kata has a resemblance to mainland Japanese techniques, NOT Okinawan, so I'm not sure of it's legitimacy as Okinawan.  Since the founder seems to be the author, it wouldn't be traditional so maybe he went to Mainland Japanese martial arts to get the techniques that are just dubbed Okinawan because he is Okinawan and returned home to Okinawan but really from the mainland???  If just interested in Bo, good techniques, if interested in research, historical, or style, it seems unrelated to any ""Okinawan"" anything, least the Bo portions.  Seems there's 2 volumes thogh.  Maybe they will one day come out with more, to go beyond 1 kata per weapon (hates the ""beginner"" this and ""Introduction to"" that, tapes that never have the advanced in an ongoing series, kinda like a cliffhanger ""to be continued"" that you never see part II).  Anyway, just my impression of the video.",1021852800,2,1600,4.789090909090909
