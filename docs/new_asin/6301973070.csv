402207,4,6301973070,"NOT OF THIS EARTH was a 1988 remake of a 1950s Corman film which was widely touted as the first legitimate role for Traci Lords after she was exposed having been underage in the porn industry.  It's cheesey drive-in fun!  Traci and the cast do a good job with what they have, and the production is fun and never takes itself seriously.  It's about a space vampire who comes to Earth for blood, and he hires a nurse (Traci Lords) and a manservant to help him out.  But they both uncover that he is not what he seems and they try and stop him with some help from their friends.  Nudity and cheesey horror abound, but Traci does not get racier than her infamous blue bikini!
The whole thing has b-movie writ large!  You can see camera crews reflected in cars, a portrait moves around the house to EVERY room, and inserted footage from other Corman classics (Galaxy of Terror, Humanoids from the Deep) stand out like sore thumbs.  But for some reason its a hoot, and very enjoyable.  Fans of Traci will love it, and she really shows she can act.  Anyone who can make me believe she's a suspicious nurse of a space vampire deserves the Oscar on effort alone!  Meryl Streep never did that!
The extra on the DVD is the commentary by Corman veteran director Jim Wyronski. He's so funny on these things - he did a similar good job on the commentary for VAMPIRELLA (another Corman produced movie about a sexy space vampire!).  So pop some popcorn and get ready for a cheesey good time.",1086048000,17,1475,4.425925925925926
402208,1,6301973070,"I bought this dvd for 2 reasons. Monique Gabrielle and Jim Wynorski .If not for the audio commentary-it is completely unbearable. Luckily,the one actor who had character was the commentary co-host. After Death Stalker II,I know Mr. Wynorski is/was capable of much more. This was sad really.",1020211200,8,290,5.191489361702128
402209,5,6301973070,"Jim Wynorski is quite possibly the finest B movie director ever.  His Sorority House Massacre II is a masterpiece of slasher horror.  Deathstalker II's incredible contrast with the rest of the series pushes a good movie up another notch.  Jim W. does it again with Not of this Earth.
The opening scene lasts about 2 or 3 minutes and after seeing it, you just know you are in for a treat.  The credits are better than ten other B movies put together.  They show an amazing array aliens, space combat, and special effects.  The best part is that the credit sequence really has very little to do with the movie you are about to see.  That kind of attention to detail is hard to find in big budget movie, and in a B movie it is practically unheard of!
Traci Lords plays a very attractive nurse who is hired to take care of the mysterious Mr. Johnson.  Mr. Johnson is does an incredible job as an emotionless alien, and the resulting comedy is priceless (or without value, depending on your point of view).  Anyway, I got a kick out of Traci's coworker, Jeremy, the surly bodyguard/driver/cook who wears leather no finger gloves and a nice looking chauffer uniform.
I recommend this movie to any fan of cheesy science fiction.  It is entertaining throughout.",1014940800,37,1253,4.57847533632287

Thankfully, some of the props used are left over from the origianl film with Paul Birch.  A Black 1956 Caddy, the ol interplanetary screening room..and even the annoying salesman selling vacuum cleaners..same sport coat ..same cleaner?

402258,4,6301973070,"Jim Wynorski is, by far, my favorite B-movie director. I like, and appreciate, the fact that he has no illusions about the type of movie he is making and what his audience wants to see. This particular film, Not of this Earth, is from the era in which he was working a lot with legendary producer Roger Corman, and in fact, is a remake of an older film Corman himself, directed (I think) back in the day.

The story is pretty much incidental, lets just say there's special effects, NUDITY, cheesy dialog, NUDITY, a guy with glowing eyes who constantly needs blood transfusions, and oh, yeah, did I mention NUDITY?

No one watches a Wynorski movie, or a Corman movie for great film making. We watch for pure fanboy entertainment, which Wynoski always delivers on.

One of the standout elements of this film is Tracie Lords, this being her first mainstream role since her porn debacle. It's amazing, I was too young to know anything about porn when this movie came out yet I have always (like everyone else) known Tracie Lords as ""that actress who use to do porn!"" Its a shame that that still follows her to this day, as she has proven to be a pretty talented actress, even showing a few glimmers of her talent here. With that being said this is a Corman\Wynorski flick so there are copious amounts of nudity, several scenes, of which, consist of Tracie Lords herself, one of which has a pretty funny continuity error in it. She really is, particularly back in the eighties, a stunningly attractive woman with a killer body! But she isn't alone in regards to the gratuitous nudity aspect of this film, there are several scenes with several other actresses who strip down, including a bubbly blond in a pink bikini who might have very well stolen the show with her amazing ASSETS!

Being how I still prefer DVD's over any other format, this special edition is the only way I have ever seen this film, having never seen it in a theater or on VHS and the good folks at shout factory didn't disappoint, as they rarely do, on the special features with not one but two very entertaining audio commentaries, as well, as an interview with the star, herself, Tracie Lords. I actually watch the film more times with the audio commentary, particularly the one featuring star Tracie Lords, than without. The overall DVD is well put together, with the one exception being an unfortunate homophobic slur that the director himself utters out on one of the commentary tracks, and nearly does it again on the other track, catching himself before doing so. It is shocking to hear nowadays, as I'm sure it would've been bleeped out now, although it was probably no more ten years ago when the commentary track was recorded. With this one exception, the DVD is pretty topnotch!",1437177600,,2755,4.639344262295082
402259,5,6301973070,"I had been hunting like crazy for this remake of a cult classic and like always found it on Amazon.com. Amazon.com for a large company does really good at stocking rare weird or hard to find DVD titles.  Not of this earth video quality is7 or 8 out of a possible 10. Sound quality is equally 7 or 8 out of a possible 10. The video is not painstakenly remastered to awesome standards but the film is largely intact, color is good, saturation is good, there are no artifacts on the copy.  Sound there is no buzz or hiss, the vocals are clear and the effects are clean. The film shows its age a bit but never so much that it interferes with enjoyment of the movie.  The acting well the star was a former adult film star and it shows in her style. Not Of This Earth works as both a horror movie and something fun to laugh at.  Not Of This Earth  has some down right creepy moments so it is legitimate horror and sci fi blended together to create a unique experience for sure.

When I purchased Not Of This Earth  the price was not out of this world high it was very reasonable. This is the perfect movie to watch when you aren't trying for something too serious and just want to have a spot of fun. Not Of This Earth is the kind of movie you watch on a rainy, snowy day when the real world has just gotten on your last nerve and you want to watch something weird to recover your good humor.",1435190400,,1386,4.111111111111111

It was Traci Lords' first non-porn film and she looks great in a bathing suit sitting by the poolside. Story-wise, the plot is not much different than the original film, except this time there is much more humor. But, oh boy, if you want to see Traci Lords looking her greatest (most of her porn films were pulled from circulation since she was under-aged when she appeared in them and used a fake birth certificate), you must purchase this film. It is not the greatest film ever made, but it is a little piece of film history. The print used in the film (by Shout!

402285,5,6301973070,"From the makers of Chopping Mall comes Not of This Earth!

Plot- A strange man comes to a hospital looking for blood. Upon discovery that his blood is strange, the doctor sends nurse Nadine (Lords) home with him. She must give him a blood transplant once a day. Soon things get out of hand, and it's discovered that the strange man is actually a member of a dying alien race, that must transport blood to the home world for survival...

My thoughts- This is one of Jim Wynorski's better movies I must say, and possibly the funnest. Lords does a decent job, Arthur Roberts does a terrific job as Mr. Johnson, Ace Mask does a good job as Dr. Rochelle, and  Michael Delano isn't too bad as a vacuum salesman. The rest of the cast isn't worth mentioning. The effects, I think are actually pretty cool. The movie doesn't take itself that seriously, and is super cheesy, but that's what makes it fun. My only issue with the film is that it uses stock footage from other Corman productions, like Humanoids from the Deep; however it's only a little bit so I don't mind it that much. It does have its fair share of both intentional and unintentional hilarity. It's a b-movie, but a great b-movie. There are much worse Corman productions out there, i.e. Attack of the Crab Monsters.

Fun Facts- The opening credits feature a montage of clips from various other Roger Corman movies, including Battle Beyond the Stars (1980), Forbidden World (1982), Galaxy of Terror (1981), Humanoids from the Deep (1980), Battle Beyond the Sun (1959) and Piranha (1978). Sample footage from each of these movies appears numerous times throughout the movie as filler footage, as well as two full-length scenes from Hollywood Boulevard (1976) and ""Humanoids from the Deep"". Becky LeBeau's scream was done by Michelle Bauer. Director Jim Wynorski made a bet with Roger Corman that he could shoot the movie in twelve days. Wynorski finished the film in eleven and a half days. Angel Tompkins did the voice of Rebecca Perle's Davanna Girl character.

Final Word- Worth a look for B-movie fans and or Roger Corman/Wynorski fans.

402317,2,6301973070,"Not of This Earth (Jim Wynorski, 1988)

I first saw Not of This Earth not long after it came out on VHS. The draw, needless to say, was former porn star Traci Lords, in her very first non-porn flick. (Say what you will about underage porn stars, but when that news came out in the mid-eighties and I realized Traci Lords is only six months older than I am? That was a very powerful thing, and probably one of the defining moments of my psyche vis-a-vis sexuality; but that is another review, and considering most of Traci Lords' porn films were destroyed for being kiddie porn, well, it is most likely a review I will never write, and you will never read.) As a side note, it was also the movie that introduced me to the wild and woolly world of Jim Wynorski, who over the course of his career in low-budget sleaze (who else would give Traci Lords a break in the film industry?) has directed both some of the best (oh, come on, you know you love Dinosaur Island) and some of the worst (The Bone Eater) bad movies you are ever likely to have the misfortune to see. Not of This Earth, which I re-watched recently to see if it held up to my twenty-five-year-old memories, is closer to the former than the latter. Though I rush to add that best is a term I am using very, very loosely here. It's still an awful movie, but it's the kind of awful movie that you rent knowing without a shadow of a doubt will deliver you a wonderful time.

Plot: the sinister Mr. Johnson (Up in Smoke's Arthur Roberts) shows up at the office of Dr. Rochelle (Chopping Mall's Ace Mask) desperately needing a blood transfusion. He is attended to by the good doctor and his nubile nurse Nadine (Lords). He then ropes them into the movie's silly plot: Mr. Johnson is a vampire. Not just any vampire, but an alien vampire who plans to enslave Earth for the purpose of providing blood. It is up to Nadine and  hunky cop Harry (Tammy and the T-Rex's Roger Lodge) to stop the evil aliens from harvesting Earth's blood supply.

If you've ever seen a Jim Wynorski movie, you know this is crap. Wynorski has been specializing in bottom-of-the-barrel exploitation trash his entire carer, and Not of This Earth is no exception. However, Wynorski claims in the entertaining documentary Popatopolis (2009) that of the over one hundred movies he had made at the time, not a single one of them failed to earn back its budget. Not bad, not bad at all. If you make dreck, people will watch it. I'm not going to say you need to rush right out and see thisI strongly suspect there is a you had to be there aspect to this film to make you understand its importance in the late-eighties film industry (Lords was the first porn star to launch a successful mainstream career, and that has everything to do with Jim Wynorski)but as far as being a trip down nostalgia lane? Can't beat it. **",1401926400,2,2840,4.41412213740458

402365,4,6301973070,"""Not of This Earth"" is the low budget, cult film from 1988 with Traci Lords, Rebecca Perle, Becky LeBeau, Roxanne Kernohan, Ava Cadell, Cynthia Thompson, Kelli Maroney, the WONDERFUL Belinda Grant, and a few other actors, who make a Sci-Fi drama about aliens who teleport to Earth for blood transfusions (they are not vampires, and there are no vampires in this film - they are outer space aliens).  This is predominantly a T & A flick, and THIS one delivers.  Not just one or two quick glimpses, not just one woman, and not just once or twice.  This isn't another one of those teaser-only type films.  The acting is hokey, but better than the majority of cult B-movie efforts, and the babes are worth the purchase of your own DVD of this film.  Traci Lords gets down to the altogether, but from the left rear angle.  There is still ONE thing left to the imagination, but not much.  There are other films by this same title, but made different years and DEFINITELY not the same cast or purpose for the film.  Oh momma, nowhere close.  This one is R-rated, and justified to be R-rated.  (spoiler alert) Don't buy this just because Monique Gabrielle is in it, she plays a cameo role as a whacko, fully clad.  Also, pay no attention to the opening scenes during the credits at the start (until the young couple making out in the car), those earlier space battles and grotesque aliens are NOT part of the film.  A great film, hands down, for what it was intended, but needed just that one slightly higher effort to merit 5 stars.  4 stars is all I have, even for Traci.",1333065600,4,1565,4.487632508833922
402366,4,6301973070,"The first film was made 30 years before this remake and was in black and white. It was also directed by the man himself! (Roger Corman)

But this remake was only produced by Corman, but was still a very nice cheesy remake. It has everything you can expect in an 80's Corman flick. (Violence (there wasn't really any gore though), naked girls, stock footage, weird soundtrack.

The story is simple. A mysterious stranger named Mr. Johnson moves into the LA area. He always wears a black suit and sunglasses (Because he's the space vampire). He hires a thug named Jeremy to do most of the care-taking while hiring a nurse named Nadine to care-take his well-being. They soon realize after some time that Mr. Johnson is an alien and eventually stop him from having his race harvest mankind as food source.

I am surprised however, that this DVD did not come with a booklet like Galaxy of Terror, Forbidden World, Death Race 200, etc.. It's a fun film still, if you're Corman fan, this is an essential...",1314316800,,999,4.632768361581921

He hires a nurse named Nadine (Traci Lords) who is a total fox to help him give him transfusions of blood from the blood bank and he has his own hired assistant named Jeremy (Lenny Juliano) to help him with his work. However Mr. Johnson has a dark secret as he is an intergalactic vampire who kills people by draining their energy with his eyes then draining their blood with a sharp device so he can deliver the blood to his dying alien race and the bodies keep coming.

Co-starring Roxanne Kernohan of Critters 2 fame and Monique Gabrielle, this is an entertaining, cheesy and bloody comical remake of Roger Corman's 1957 Sci-fi horror movie. Produced by Roger Corman and from the director of Chopping Mall Jim Wyonrski this one blends a unique take on vampirism like the original but not in a traditional manner but a space vampire take. The syntheizer score by Chuck Cirono is a nice touch and this one offers blood, nudity, sex and everything to please a guy including miss Lords in the buff. It's a sleazy movie but great fun for any Sci-fi, horror, Corman and B-movie fan, i always enjoyed this since i was a teen and Miss Lords is a sex goddess all the way.

Exciting 67 minute Sci-fi horror quickie from Roger Corman that was part of a double feature in 1957 with Attack of the Crab Monsters. This is the best one of the two movies so far! co-starring Dick Miller, this movie is the first movie to be about a space vampire despite The Thing from Another World did it first. The vampire ailen in this movie requires no fangs or stake killing as it has blank eyes to drain people's lifeforces out instead of drinking their blood and for the victims blood they don't drink it they drain it with devices and use them for their transfusions. The acting is suprisingly good and the effect on the flying bat-like octo creature is laughable yet but this was the 50s, this movie went on to inspire many space vampire stuff such as Vampirella comics, Planet of the Vampires, Colin Wilson's Space vampires, Lifeforce, Buck Roger's space vampire episode and more. It even inspired 2 remakes and gained a cult following over the years on Cable and TV but never came out on DVD in the US until now.",1306108800,2,1646,4.5608108108108105

Ok, 'Not of This Earth' won't go down in sci-fi history.  Space vampires come to Earth to determine whether humans are a suitable food source.  The head vampire visits a local health clinic complaining of anemia (what else?).  The good doctor agrees and assigns his nurse, Nadine(Traci Lords) to move in with the blood sucker so that she can administer regular blood transfusions.  That's enough of the plot.  Lots of topless girls, beautiful old cars and hokey sci-fi elements round out this 1988 release.

This film was pretty obviously made to capitalize on Lords' infamy as a teenage porn actress.  Despite that, Traci actually does a good job in the role, outperforming the rest of the cast of 'B' movie ""regulars"".  It's all camp and Roger Corman.  If you like these types of films, you really need to add 'Not of This Earth' to your collection.  I laughed out load and had a good time watching it.

402383,4,6301973070,"So here we have Traci Lords' first legitimate film, and a Roger Corman film at that!  It's also directed by all purpose schlockmeister Jim Wynorski!
This is a remake of a Corman film of the same name, made when remakes were actually good because the folks that were making them were fans of the original film, as opposed to today where some flunky, having never even heard of the original film, is hired by the money grubbing companies(Platinum Dunes is top offender) to vomit all over the legacy of a classic for the sake of the almighty dollar.  Sorry for the run on sentence that went off on a tangent, but when I think of all that modern remake stuff, steam comes out of my ears.
But I guess was there was a bet between Corman and Wynorski, where Wynorski would have to complete his film within the same amount of time(12 days) that it took Corman to complete his version.  Wynorski won the bet(on the commentary he said he made this film in 10 days), won a car, and we all got Not Of This Earth.
It's the story of an alien from a dying planet(A very good Arthur Roberts)on Earth to sample our blood and see if it's worth harvesting.  He enlists a nurse(Lords, probably the sexiest nurse in film history) to stay at his home to give him daily blood transfusions.  Well, it's only a matter of time until Lords and her cop boyfriend(Blind Date's very own Roger Lodge) stumble onto the truth and must stop the alien vampire.
If you're familiar with Wynorski's brand of sex comedy/horror/sci-fi/fantasy schlockiness, you'll know what kind of film you'll be getting into here, as it's Wynorski through and through.  It's cheap, it's silly(intentionally), it's full of Corman stock footage(the title sequence alone is half of the Corman Cult Classics Collection in about two minutes), and best of all, it's just fun.
Shout Factory have done a good job again giving us a Traci Lords interview(Sweet mercy, this woman is hot!  Maybe even moreso today than then!), and a commentary with Wynorski and Lords.  They sound like they had a lot of fun doing this movie.  Wynorski sounds quite smitten with Lords, then and now, and who can blame him?
Lords bares a little skin here too, the only time she ever would in her legit film career, so there's even more incentive to see it!",1292025600,4,2271,4.587654320987654

402386,5,6301973070,"Former adult film actress Traci Lords stars in her first mainstream film role as a nurse wearing a skin-tight and super- short uniform in this 1988 remake of Roger Corman's rarely seen NOT OF THIS EARTH.

This remake is purebred camp. Lords is entertaining to watch and turns in a very credible rookie performance onscreen. It's well worth your time if you're in a lighthearted mood.

The plots of the original and the remake are identical. The aliens' mission is a simple one: to suck the blood of the human race, to short-circuit our brains with direct eye contact, and to collect various specimens for study and experimentation back on their home planet.

Roger Corman created a 1957 film that transcended its science-fiction genre and became instead a period-piece artifact of Middle American Cold War paranoia, McCarthyism and race tension.

In the original, those who are not of this earth are humanoid creatures who speak in suspiciously thick Eastern European accents, behave mysteriously, dress in undertakers' suits, Ray Ban sunglasses and homburg hats (and MUST have inspired Belushi and Akroyd in creating the Blues Brothers).

In the earlier film, Corman makes a piercing social commentary when his Iron Curtain outworlders categorize our species either as ""humans"" (whites) or ""subhumans"" (people of color).

Unfortunately for the original, most viewers over the years have seen the aliens' labeling as an example of racism rather than an indictment of it. As a result, the original NOT OF THIS EARTH is never broadcast and is only available through very limited outlets.

Lords' film limits its social commentary to important issues, like beer and burgers.

Besides Lords' recommended 1988 comic remake there was a dramatic version made in 1995. The 1995 remake with Michael York is absolutely forgettable.

So have a good time watching Traci learn how to act in wardrobe, and if you can find the 1957 original definitely give it a viewing as well.",1118793600,16,1963,5.090342679127726
402387,4,6301973070,"Roger Corman is executive producer and schlock-meister Jim Wynorski is director of 1988's NOT OF THIS EARTH, a campy remake of the campy Corman-directed classic.  And in typical Corman style, it offers everything a B-movie fan could want: A goofy tongue-in-cheek plot that is barely more than a re-hash of the original; cheesy special FX, a good number of which were lifted from other Corman films; mediocre acting from some of the supporting cast; and lots of gratuitous female nudity.  And also as with most films in which Corman has his hands, it is LOTS of fun to watch.
Gorgeous former hardcore adult-film star Traci Lords--here in her first ""legit"" starring role and the last role in which she completely disrobes for the camera--portrays a private-care nurse who unwittingly assists an extraterrestrial vampire in draining low-lifes and bimbos of their blood so that he can send the vital red stuff back to the hungry folks on his home planet of Devanna.  It doesn't take long, though, before the nurse and her policeman boyfriend (Roger Lodge--yes, THAT Roger Lodge) begin to suspect that something strange and dangerous is going on.  But can they solve the mystery quickly enough to save the city's remaining low-lifes and bimbos?
During the shooting and post-production of this film, there was a lot of hullabaloo about Traci Lords being cast in the lead role.  Many thought that casting the former star of XXX-rated films was just a gimmick to gain publicity for the project, and while it did indeed do that, Ms. Lords' performance in NOT OF THIS EARTH is top-notch and professional and acquits her of the charges of being nothing more than shapely eye-candy.  And for the most part, the other actors do a great job of supporting Ms. Lords.  Arthur Roberts--looking like one of THE BLUES BROTHERS (1980)--delightfully parodies the stoic, awkward, out-of-his-element extraterrestrial that has become a sci-fi clich.  As the alien's clueless butler and chauffeur, Lenny Juliano has good onscreen chemistry with star Lords and really hams it up.  And actor Ace Mask, playing the doctor who assigns Lords to work with the alien, is delightfully quirky and a real hoot whenever he's on the screen.
The only odd casting choice is that of Roger Lodge for the role of Lords' boyfriend.  Filmgoers may recognize Lodge from his gig as host of TV's flaky syndicated dating show BLIND DATE.  While Lords' performance in this film demonstrates why she has become a ubiquitous presence on TV and on film, Lodge's performance demonstrates why he's been relegated to hosting a low-brow late-night TV show.  Traci Lords and Roger Lodge in bed together?  That ineffable mismatch is like something from Lodge's BLIND DATE.
Rumor has it that this film came about as the result of a wager between Corman and Wynorski that the younger director wouldn't be able to shoot an adequate remake if restricted to the same 12-day shooting schedule and a similar budget.  Well, Wynorski rose to the challenge and actually succeeded.  So yes, this version of NOT OF THIS EARTH is a cheap production with lots of cheap tongue-in-cheek  humor, cheap over-the-top performances, cheap FX & recycled film footage, and cheap busty bimbos--not to mention the beautiful and classy Ms. Lords--providing gratuitous eye-popping T&A.  Nobody has tried to deny that the film is a cheesefest.  But it's a highly entertaining cheesefest nonetheless, and in many ways it is better and more fun than Corman's original.
The DVD treatment of NOT OF THIS EARTH from New Concorde is pretty cool, especially considering that the film itself is a low-budget quickie.  The disc offers a nice digital transfer of the film, generally free of filmic or digital artifacts, in what is apparently the film's original aspect ratio of 1.33:1.  As for bonus material, an optional feature commentary with director Wynorski and supporting actor Lenny Juliano is a real hoot--often times funnier and campier than the film itself--and Wynorski also manages to relate some interesting and humorous anecdotes regarding the making of the film and points out a few technical errors.  Also offered is the requisite original theatrical trailer.  All in all, it's a great DVD value.
In short, viewers who love low-budget B-grade SF and horror movies will enjoy the 1988 remake of NOT OF THIS EARTH and will certainly want to add this cool DVD to their collections.  (Fans of gorgeous Traci Lords will want to give it a spin, too.) But those who don't comprehend the entertainment value of watching well-crafted schlock should probably spend their money elsewhere.",1089072000,81,4598,5.044914134742404
