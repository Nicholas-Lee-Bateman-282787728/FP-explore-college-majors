8516305,5,B007GF8WZM,"Incredibly insightful movie. Admittedly, at only 4 minutes running time there isn't much in the way of character development or, for that matter, plot. But it is beautifully filmed and the characters are bigger than life. The difficult subject of frontal lobotomy as a cure for personality flaws is handled with skill and precision, just as a good lobotomy should be conducted. In our plastic surgery culture, it takes only a small leap of faith to accept the movie's premise. I am a convert, and will be scheduling an appointment for my wife's procedure soon. Highly recommended!",1439942400,,580,4.989690721649485
