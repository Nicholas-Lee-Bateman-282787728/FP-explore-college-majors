It does offer only very basic information. In fairness to the CD, it is #1 in a two part set with the second CD being advanced strategies. This does not make the CD bad, however, the cost of the CD (even used) might be better spent on a book where one would get much more info or for free on the internet. I would have preferred only one CD with a little more advanced info on it along with some basic info, yet, that is not the fault of this basic part 1 CD. If someone wants a basic overview of the E-mini index futures market and prefers the information presented to them on a CD, this might be applicable - just know you will be getting basic information that you might be able to find online if you were willing to invest a little time.",1324339200,3,879,4.176470588235294
