8017390,4,B0001WTUHQ,"I bought this movie from itunes after reading reviews on Claire Forlani's perfomance. I had to see it for myself and i must say that her perfomance of a drug addict is one of the best i have ever seen! I am a big fan of Forlani's. I've watched most of her movies and there are times when i forget that she is actually british and not american. Her new york accent in this movie is flawless. Forlani plays an undercover police inspector who infultrated a drug ring. Her character, Monica, has become addicted to herorin. As the movie plays out, she takes an elderly lady hostage while she is in search of a package that an informant mailed to himself. Forlani's portrayal of Monica, going through withdrawal symptoms are flawless. I am not good with describing but there is one review written by a practicing attorney in LA on IMDB that you must read to get the full detail on why Forlani's performance deserved an award.

[...]reviews its the forth review down titled ""Undercover drug agent becomes pawn in major betrayal of mob boss who exacts great vengeance""",1317254400,6,1061,4.613756613756614
8017391,4,B0001WTUHQ,"Loved this film Clare Forlani playing an interesting dark role, murder mystery then Lauren was just brilliant great acting by both.",1263686400,5,131,5.285714285714286
8017392,1,B0001WTUHQ,The only good thing about this movie was Lauren Bacall. She was great as usual. The sound quality sucked on this one. The story was very slow. Don't waste your money.,1184112000,6,166,4.387096774193548
8017393,4,B0001WTUHQ,"I think Ms. Forlani does a great job capturing the American accent and playing a character that seems so against ""type.""  I've seen her in other movies and on tv (Meet Joe Black, The Medallion, CSI: New York) but this role really spun my expectations sideways.

I was impressed with the scenes between her and Ms. Bacall, and I think they played off each other's talents convincingly.  Definitely an examination of a ""day in the life,"" as Ms. Forlani puts it.  There isn't a great external journey or quest or adventure, so much as the film seems like a voyeuristic peep show watching characters spinning in place, or if anything, spiraling down out of control.",1171324800,7,661,4.721739130434782
8017394,3,B0001WTUHQ,"very good cast.liked technique of plot line jumping. Had some holes w/credibility as pertaining to monica's addiction, and not being able to be detected by her law enforcement superiors.

liked low-key production, in this day of special effects, it was refreshing. Claire Forlani was beautiful as always.",1123891200,5,304,5.468085106382978
