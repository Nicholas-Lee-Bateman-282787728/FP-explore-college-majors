8001195,4,B0000DIZPK,"Basically this is about 7 nice-looking ladies stripping totally nude for the camera, each for around 5 minutes. They're all in some kind of lush Hawaiian-looking setting, often near a swimming pool or some other water. The camerawork is quite competently done. One very nice feature of the DVD is that you can use the angle control on your remote to choose between 3 different cameras - one very close, one a little further back, and one lurking around in the bushes peeking at the ladies, if you're voyeuristically-inclined. All the ladies are very sexy and good at posing for the camera. There's also a ""behind the scenes"" section that's fun, showing the filming being prepared, and with one of the models interviewed a little, but it only runs about 5 minutes darn it. And there's a nice gallery with 24 photos of the ladies. But about that 180-minute run time listed on here - they must have added up the time of each of the camera angles to get that, because realistically the DVD runs about a third that long. So, to me this DVD isn't anything exceptional, and I'd prefer more variety, but it's well-made if you like the format, and at a very good price too.",1154563200,11,1164,4.574162679425838
