7009878,3,B00TI5RQL4,"The Woman in Black continues the story many years after the first film (with Radcliffe) with Hammer's The Woman in Black 2, and offers plenty of creepy atmosphere and the horrific, looming presence of the vindictive, never forgiving woman in the black dress, forever haunting the isolated mansion. The story did a decent job explaining why a school of orphans would reside in this house during the war, and when the horror begins, the evil ghost doesn't spare anyone, though she does take her time. If you're looking for more scares and a decent storyline to continue this theme, the Woman in Black is worth a look, with an interesting plot starring a female teacher who discovers the evil entity and attempts to get everyone out before it's too late. There were a couple scenes that were horrific and generally frightening, satisfying the search for horror in this film. (Trivia: The original star of the outstanding made for TV movie The Woman in Black makes a guest appearance in this film).",1426291200,29,994,4.818713450292398
7009879,3,B00TI5RQL4,"I really enjoyed the first one. This one was not nearly as good. The movie was way to dark for me to enjoy. I mean literally dark. Most of the scenes were shot at night and i could barely make out what was going on. It was very slow and uneventful. The acting was decent and it was well shot, but that's not enough. Watchable at best !!",1425859200,3,336,3.9558823529411766
7009880,1,B00TI5RQL4,"I'm not really even sure why I watched this movie to start with?  I was bored by the first one, but I'm a Daniel Radcliffe fan, so I was able to make it through.  This movie, however, is just extremely boring!  It takes us back to the Eel Marsh House, only 40 years after the events of the original.  Some children are brought in to live after being evacuated from London during World War II.  Apparently, it is this sudden disturbance that causes the haunting in the mansion to return.

I guess I wasn't fully paying attention, but I thought that the original had pretty much wrapped up the ""haunting"" and was very surprised (not in a good way) to see that a second one was coming out?  A sequel to the orginal ""Woman in Black"" is like the sequel for ""Blair Witch Project"".  There is absolutely NO REASON for it to exist.  Honestly, I can't believe I even made it completely through without turning it off.

Don't get me wrong,...the movie, itself is really well filmed, acted, all that good stuff.  It's just that the story is so completely boring that nothing could make it worth watching, in my opinion.

Final Verdict:  HARD PASS on this one!",1425254400,5,1147,4.456730769230769
7009881,2,B00TI5RQL4,"I have to agree with the first review this movie is predictable and slightly boring, The first one was far from the book which I own and loved but at least the movie still kept the essence of the book. I too love the horror and suspense genres so having watched my share of horror films I have to say if you want to get scared keep away...honestly wait for redbox or until the price drops I promise you will find the movie in the discount bins before you know it I went to my dollar theater to watch this one and well yeah it was worth the 1.90 I paid but not more than that in my book and also ironically I too liked cabin in the woods..So if scares are what you are after this little lemon won't do it. rent an old classic and enjoy.",1425168000,,735,3.972972972972973
7009882,3,B00TI5RQL4,"The first film is a masterpiece of horror! I love the book, the 1989 movie and stage play! As an extension of the Woman in Black universe, this is a fine entry! Great? No. Entertaining? Most definitely! Far better than many horror sequels and carries much of the same unsettling atmosphere of the first! While the first had scares a plenty, the sequel is quietly reserved and seems more interested in tension rather than scaring you although the final act will definitely give you a run for your money! Definitely recommend. Will it be memorable 10 years from now? Probably not. But that's not the point. Enjoy it for what it is. You could do far worse!",1424908800,28,653,4.589743589743589
7009883,2,B00TI5RQL4,"I was excited to see this movie as the preview made it look pretty creepy. Sadly, however, I was sorely disappointed. While my sister and nieces found the movie to be scary, I was just bored the whole time. The movie was predictable, not creepy, and all around kind of dumb. I found myself rolling my eyes a lot and I just wanted the movie to be over with. I feel I should say that the horror genre is my favorite when it comes to movies and I have seen a ton of them in my day. I'm also not scared easily by horror films, but I do get goosebumps from time to time if something is truly creepy. I genuinely want to like every horror movie that I see since it's my favorite genre but the truth is, there just aren't that many good horror films. Obviously I can't speak for every horror lover out there when I say that this movie was dumb, especially considering that I loved Cabin in the Woods when a lot of people thought that it was dumb, but I would definitely not recommend this movie. If you liked the first movie, do yourself a favor and skip this sequel. The story isn't new and the characters are annoying. You'd be better off renting some obscure horror movie from redbox than wasting your time on this film.",1424822400,4,1216,4.223175965665236

7009912,3,B00TI5RQL4,"THE WOMAN IN BLACK 2
ANGEL OF DEATH

I absolutely loved the first The Woman in Black film and thought that is was and still is a classic. That film actually creeped me out, there were a few times I had genuine chills while watching that. I love Hammer films and their comeback was excellent thus far. So I was super excited when I learned that they were making a sequel to that great film.

The events of this film take place forty years later during World War Two. Two teachers take all of their students away from a London that is being bombed. They are fleeing to the safety of the house we all remember from the first film. A house that you can only get to at different times thanks to the tide that covers the road. Along the way they meet a British soldier who is stationed at a nearby airfield. The house is old, creepy and broken down looking but it is all that they have at the moment. Things soon take a turn for the worse as the Woman in Black shows herself to one of the teachers and starts to take the children one by one, using one of them in particular. So it is up to the teacher to protect the children from not only the war, but the Woman in Black as well.

This over all was a good film and director Tom Harper moved things along at a nice pace and the story by writer Jon Croker was an interesting one. With that said the film just lacks something, the tension and dread of the first film is not there really. The first film legit actually creeped me out, this one never had that moment that did that to me. I did like the movie and found it a fun watch but that was about it. I did also enjoy the special features on the Blu-Ray, particularly the making of. There are also a few other good looks at the film and a deleted scene. Unfortunately there are no commentaries, I would have loved that. Still over all it is a good film but far from Hammers best.",1473120000,,1875,4.1035422343324255

I liked ASPECTS of this movie, the overarching story mostly but, quite a bit of plot points, reveals and even motive's didn't make sense in the contexts of the story, especially near the end. Its as if they forgot that there was even a first movie and the rules established by that first movie. (SPOILERS - Am I suppose to believe that the woman in black orchestrated this entire event from the beginning, before any of these characters even saw her or set foot on the island? that's not how it was explained in the first movie and how the hell did the woman in black know about the main characters past? Is she some type of psychic ghost now? Can she read minds? does she know the past of everyone in the world? These are only two of the many inconsistency's in this movie's plot that it has made between itself and its predecessor.) Its like this Woman in Black2 was only ""loosely"" based on the one from the first movie, as if they took everything that was really good from the first movie and threw it all out the window in favor of more modern scares and shock value that are seen in every American horror movie of the early 2000s and they just aren't all that memorable.

P.S. The acting was good and the story was also pretty intriguing but, that can't save it alone. They should have stuck a little closer to home, Less jump scares more atmosphere building, sticking to the rules that have already been established. What made the actual villainess so intimidating in the first movie was the build up, the fact that we only caught small glimpses of her every now and again and we didn't see much of her till the 3rd act, there was no build up here so there was little payoff.",1446422400,,1768,4.37386018237082

7010019,2,B00TI5RQL4,"Woman in Black 2: Angel of Death was apparently a book that came out a few years ago - not written by Susan Hill like the original, I may add - and then snuck it's way into a movie adaptation shortly afterwards. Being a fan of the first book, the London stage play and the BBC movie and the Daniel Radcliffe movie was quite good too, I thought I'd give this one a go. I had quite low expectations to be honest, especially going by the universal panning it seems to be getting from all critics and audiences about, but it wasn't completely as bad as I thought it'd be. The World War 2 setting was well done and looked good, Eel Marsh House was as creepy as ever and the story was well written and a good reason to revisit the house. However the scares were very predictable, the acting  from the unknown cast wasn't great and the ending was just ridiculous.

This is an unnecessary sequel that doesn't expand on the original really at all. Although there was a theatrical release it does unfortunately feel very ""straight to DVD"". It's an average movie that was  a mildly enjoyable watch, mainly due to it's source material but as a horror it is pretty average. Not one I'll be watching again.",1438732800,,1192,4.384615384615385

7010049,3,B00TI5RQL4,"'1941' London is bombed night after night, the young are evacuated, separated from their loved ones for an undetermined
period.
The film tells of a small group of children accompanied by teacher 'Eve' (Phoebe Fox) and headmistress 'Jean' (Helen McCrory)
who are allocated a placing in a remote location and the run-down 'Eel Marsh House'
'Eve' is a caring soul and try's to comfort the children separated from their loved ones in particular 'Edward' who'd lost both
parents in the blitz, young Edward has not spoken since.
'Jean' is more hardened and shows little in the way of emotion.
On the Journey to the home, 'Eve' had shared a carriage compartment on the train with airman 'Harry' (Jeremy Irvine) who
promises to look in on 'Eve' when he can.
The house with all it's empty rooms is an eerie place, dark and run-down, along with a 'Spirit' that is less than welcoming......
From the outset, 'Eve' has trouble sleeping, she has recurring nightmares that stem from both her past and the feel of the
location she finds herself in.
Young 'Edward'(Oaklee Pentdergast) is seemingly the fist to encounter the restless Spirit, though he doesn't even write down
what he's seeing..............
When death visits, their survival chances were probably better in blitz-torn London...........
The film rely's heavily on the atmosphere of the remote and dark location to build the tension.....
I must admit that i was surprised some that they made a follow-up to the 2012 'Daniel Radcliffe' film, curiosity got the better of
me when seeing this one on sale at the shop.......though having now watched it, i have to say you almost certainly won't lose any
sleep after watching this 'Hammer' offering....guess you could say it does have it's moments.

7010119,4,B00TI5RQL4,"This reminded me a lot of ""The Others"" (Nicole Kidman) - an atmospheric period piece with a supernatural angle. It's NOT a typical horror movie, but it IS a very good atmospheric flick.

I think a lot of the negative reviews are from people who expected a typical ""scary"" movie. I don't blame them - this was certainly marketed that way, and from that viewpoint it's pretty disappointing. There's nothing remotely scary about this movie. A little creepy at times, but nothing that will make you jump or give you a sleepless night. The PG-13 rating alone tells you that this isn't going to be a gore-fest. If you're expecting something like ""The Conjuring,"" ""Insidious,"" or ""Mama,"" then probably give this one a pass (you might be disappointed).

But if you look at this as a suspenseful period piece, then it's actually very good. Set during the Blitz (WWII 1941), a group of children are evacuated from London along with their two caretakers to a remote house in the country. If you saw the first one, then you'll already know the setting and the background story of the Woman in Black. However, this isn't so much a sequel as it is a spin-off, so you don't necessarily have to have seen the first one in order to appreciate this one.

Visually, it's stunning. The style is completely British, and the way it's shot reminds me a lot of typical BBC period pieces. It moves slowly, relying on a creepy atmosphere to build suspense. The characters are compelling and well-acted, and you're slowly drawn in as their personal tragedies and backstories are revealed. It does have the ""horror/supernatural"" angle to it, but it's more about the tragedy of the Woman in Black than it is about a vengeful ghost.

I took off one star only because a significant portion of the movie is shot in the dark - literally. I watched this in a pitch-black room on an LCD tv and I still couldn't see what was going on a lot of the time.

Personally, I thought this was an excellent movie, and I actually liked it better than the first one. Like I said, this reminded me a LOT of movies like ""The Others"" and ""The Awakening."" If you liked those, then you'll probably enjoy this one as well.",1433548800,,2169,4.565552699228792

No character, charm, plot or atmosphere to this one. It just drags on with characters that are sooooo uninteresting and lackluster you end up not really giving a crap about them. The other aspect is that the film is poorly lit. I realize the film has a lot of scenes that take place at night, but a good director and cinematographer know how to light the scenes as to be viewable and pleasant to the viewer while still retaining the ""spooky"" night look. About 75-80 of the movie takes place at night and darken rooms so it got annoying real fast that we all had a horrible time making things out.
The only redeeming quality is they did a excellent job on the period piece set's costume's and characters of WW2 England.

7010147,3,B00TI5RQL4,"This story is good for generally all-around creepiness and a few instant shock spots.  The storyline of a group of children taken to the countryside for their own protection during World War 2 is different, though why anyone in his right mind would place them in a deserted mansion on a spit of land accessible only at low tide, a place where there was no electricity and no caretaker or any way to communicate if help was needed, is beyond me.

The plot follows the general outline for this type of tale. We know who's going to get killed and exactly why and can almost pinpoint when. The picture is dark throughout, highlighted mostly by candles and lanterns and while this adds to the atmosphere, it also makes it difficult to see, which in my case, didn't add to the scariness but was merely irritated since I had only the accompanying music to go by to determine when something dire had happened. I'd prefer to have been able to at least see a bit of it.

My Opinion:  Okay but nothing new.  All in all, it's a good night's scary viewing but it may leave the viewer with a sense of disappointment.  If so, he can wait for The woman in Black 3 and see if that helps.

This viewing was from a DVD rental and no remuneration was involved in the writing of this review.",1432252800,,1270,4.3559322033898304
7010148,4,B00TI5RQL4,"This movie is very dark...and I mean that literally. Most of it takes place at night with only the illumination of kerosene lanterns or candles. While this provides a definitely creepy atmosphere, it's very difficult to see on a television screen although I imagine it worked well in theaters. I spent a good part of the movie guessing what was happening and the ending is still up in the air except for the result.

It's very easy in this one to tell who is going to be victims and exactly in which order and the ""villainess"" barely appears except in fleeting glimpses in all that darkness. (If you have floaters or any eye condition, you may mistake her for part of your problem and miss her completely.)  It's a good story for mounting tension and generally eerieness and the reason for the characters being there is different enough.  I don't remember many stories based on children being evacuated to the countryside during WWII for their safety so this one is unique in that respect. Surprisingly, very little previous information is given on the apparition herself.

Even with the background storyline, the atmospheric sets, etc., going for it, I still had a sense of disappointment at the end. Perhaps it was because--unless I turned off all the lights, tuned the TV to its brightest, and watched it in the dark, which I definitely wasn't about to do--I wasn't able to see what was going on but a third of the time.

Since the first movie was set at the turn of the century and the second in 1941, I have no doubt there'll be a Woman in Black 3 to bring it into the present century. Hope they have the electricity restored by then.",1432252800,,1639,4.580204778156997

One movie I saw had a ghost that went around in bed sheets...so even if this movie isn't great, it is more entertaining than other movies.

I liked the plotline better in this movie than in the first, but somehow the movie felt thrown together and timid.  It made you think it was going in a certain way, but it never resolved in a satisfactory way, I felt.  I don't mind if movies switch angles, but I want them to end strongly.  The movie felt timid--like it was afraid to go down certain paths because it worried it was going to offend a certain group of people.  Frankly, I saw nothing in the movie that should have caused offense.  In the end, I wasn't sure whether this movie wasn't just put together because they felt there needed to be a sequel.  This is the problem with horror movies.  Sometimes it is better to have one movie.

The one bright spot for me was actress Helen McCrory (she played Narcissa Malfoy in the Harry Potter films).  I liked her battle ax character.",1431302400,6,1131,4.384615384615385

At least the actors ages seemed right. I thought that Daniel Radcliffe was too young to be portraying a lawyer with a four year old son in the first movie (he would have been a teen when his son was born and his first scene made it appear that he had been a lawyer for a while prior to the start of the movie  - probably impossible for a young man of his age even in the story's time frame). #2 had some good moments, but it lacked ""edge of the seat"" suspense.",1431216000,,633,3.984251968503937

Very predictable plot; agree with others who said the film was much too dark in places when action taking place (this is England at night during a full blackout but come on); actors did a fine job.  Would like to testify to the fact that they would not have been able to stand the stink of a rotting house with rising damp. That alone would drive them out. They would probably have to camouflage the bus and sleep there. being able to tolerate damp has nothing to do with being a Brigadier General. It has to do with movie license. I could not be distracted from this unlikely premise that they would stay in that house.

Felt very sorry for the little boy. Now that we know that backstory though, not sure why the ghost is hellbent on killing as many people as she can. After all, they don't seem to be joining her in the afterlife, or do they? I also wonder if they will move the setting ahead another 50 years which will put it in the middle of the 90s. But unless a considerable amount of time and expense is spent on the house which is pretty far gone already, there won't be any setting but the graveyard left. But maybe the ghost tidies up once in a while.  Not that bad of a movie but not a patch (ha ha ) on the original.",1430611200,,1314,4.395061728395062

7010261,2,B00TI5RQL4,"The woman in black makes the mistake of confusing dark and murky with moody and atmospheric. Some of the scenes are swathed in such darkness that it's impossible to be clear on what's happening. While there are a few jumps here (I counted two) most of this is stuff that we've seen before. Consequently, there are no surprises.

The woman in black is, for dubious and unclear reasons, haunting young pretty Eve who has a secret that is shocking for the time period but merely a ""meh"" by today's standards. Along the way, the woman takes lives and induces delusions real and imagined.

My beef with the woman is that (as in the movie prior) Eve has done her no wrong. So why she's trippin' out over Eve's secret remains a mystery. Speaking of mystery, in the first movie, we wondered who ""the women"" was. In this one, we know who she is. We just don't know why she's hurting these people. But I digress. The movie is only remotely interesting, and that's because of the acting of the leads, and in spite of the fact of the forced romance.

Perhaps if the woman in black had spent more time choosing her wardrobe, we would have a slightly better movie. As is, it's just an unnecessary sequel dressed in inappropriate clothing.",1430438400,3,1224,4.529411764705882

7010387,4,B00TI5RQL4,"When I saw WOMAN IN BLACK 2 at the movies, I was sorely disappointed because I was expecting a traditional sequel to the first film as the title implies. Turns out that instead, WIB2 is an atmospheric ghost story in the tradition of Henry James or Algernon Blackwood that borrows the main character from the first film for its own purposes. For today's audiences the movie is enigmatic to a fault for there's no way you can follow it or take it all in in one viewing. However home viewing is a completely different matter where you can take the time to allow the story and the characters to envelop you. If you are able to do this then WIB2 can be a rewarding experience.

I remember thinking as I left the theater that anyone who hadn't seen the first film would be at a loss as to what was going on but after talking to several people who hadn't seen it, they found WIB2 really unnerving because they DIDN'T know what was going on. In fact ""newbies"" found it far more effective than those already familiar with THE WOMAN IN BLACK who, like myself, came with their own set of expectations. WIB2 is not a 21st century horror film which is how it was marketed and which is why so many people have given it such a low rating. INSIDIOUS, THE CONJURING, PARANORMAL ACTIVITY or even the first WIB, it definitely is not. Think of it as THE TURN OF THE SCREW updated to contemporary standards.

Its old school approach of editing and sound effects to achieve most of the scares (although there are a few visual jolts as well) will put off most of today's horror fans who demand more graphic mayhem. Those fans will find this movie very boring indeed but if you appreciate atmosphere and an ever increasing since of dread coupled with a slow realization of what's going on then this is the movie for you. WIB2 is a film that grows on repeated viewings so that you can appreciate how it gets to where it's going just as much as what happens when you get there. Only the ending falters but that can be forgiven considering what has gone before..

The period look of the film is gorgeous (it's set in WW II England), the performances are solid, and the soundtrack is very effective. The script is layered and hard to follow which is why it needs to be seen more than once. I've just finished my 3rd viewing and can now revel in most of the details. Although the Hammer Films of today is not the Hammer of old, they are following in the footsteps of the original company by issuing a quality product made for comparatively little money. WIB2 is English to the core and so if you enjoy all things British especially those things that take the BBC / MASTERPIECE approach than this is a movie for you. Others will want to check out something else.",1429401600,9,2732,4.405940594059406

7010422,3,B00TI5RQL4,"I guess that's really the bottom line if you're thinking of watching this movie. It's not a bad movie. As a period piece it is very well done. The overall storyline is much less depressing than its predecessor. The characters are all intriguingly flawed people whom you want to see get it together. But it's just not scary. The movie is set during the blitz attacks on London in World War II. A pair of caretakers are escorting a small group of children into the country to get them away from the danger of the bombing. They are given use of the infamous Eel Marsh House for their charges. You'd think the doctor who sets up the tenancy would know better, and there are some creepy conversations that the heroine, Eve, has with him that imply that in fact he does (I don't think I'm spoiling it that the first movie is about the danger this ghost represents to the local village children) but that story thread is not really followed to its darkest conclusion. It's one of several story threads left dangling. Like the one about just exactly what the traumatized child Edward really means to Eve. Again it's heavily implied but never outright stated. This movie never really manages the sustained dread from the first film. It's lighter in tone and even the ghostly visitations are lacking in suspense.

7010431,2,B00TI5RQL4,"While WiB2 starts off solidly enough in the Hammer horror tradition (a collection of white, middle class people are driven to the middle of nowhere to get terrified and/or killed in creative ways), it loses its way around the mid-point and quickly descends into a disastrous mess. The 'lack of spooky' at the beginning can easily be mistaken for an attempt to build suspense but it turns out there are no horrors or plot-twists waiting - aside from a couple of CG jump scares, the once-terrifying lady of the title has been neutered into a generic ghost that can barely alarm the kids in the movie.

There's nothing at all new here as the scenes veer between English wartime school drama and replaying ideas from the first film. Some of it makes absolutely no sense and you get the feeling that the director wanted the movie to end almost as much as the audience. It's a real shame since the book and stage play are really first class yet the key elements here could have been derived from any horror franchise.

I really liked the first edition of this film but the sequel is just a poorly directed horror with absolutely nothing going on for it. The sets weren't anything new, even the sound was not scary! The ghosts are shown as either children grouped together (I mean I can make scarier faces than that. Give me three minutes.) The film uses a lot of black and darkness to try and evoke horror but eventually falls flat on its face. ""Angel of Death"" will go straight to the list of those lousy horror re-runs on tv.

8701870,4,B00TI5RQL4,"I don't think the sequel was meant to be more scarier than the first but was meant to explain who the woman in black was and to tell a story about these children during WWII who were taken just like children before in earlier times.  It leaves us all wondering if the house is still standing and are children still dying today when a person sees the woman in black?  I liked the second one just as much as the first one.  Let's face it, neither movie makes really is plausible.  Who would put children in a rotting home where they could fall through the floors?  And what town full of folks who lost their children would let any stranger even near the property in fear of losing more children.  Both movies are good stories, though, and maybe the third one will be in modern times.",1522368000,,781,4.315068493150685
