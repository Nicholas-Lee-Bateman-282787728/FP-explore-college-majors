I keeping watching to see if there will ever be a DVD release for the US. I'm hoping it will happen soon since an actual movie is about to be released. It would be great if they rebooted the series and cont. where it left off.  I mean come on, we have AVATAR The Last Airbener on DVD",1474502400,,432,3.9655172413793105

You are earning much on streaming video but you will earn much more if old region 2 videos are converted back to region in all fare region should always be and region 2 optional,1438646400,,300,4.101694915254237
