3772172,3,B001R10BJG,"The Burrowers presents an age old problem for monster movies that dates back to the ideas set forth in Jaws in that the film is a lot more effective when you don't see the monster itself. Its a shame in my opinion that the movie stumbles so badly on this point as I thought everything else in the film for an independent horror film was top knotch from the direction by JT Petty to the cinematography and production design itself.
The basic story sets itself with a rescue mission started after settlers discover the remains of people who they believe have been attacked by indians. Four civilians join up with soldiers to travel out and search for missing women who still may be alive. Disgusted with the soldiers inhumane treatment of an indian they capture they part company with them only to find themselves attacked by the creatures one night with one man poisoned and dying slowly.
Whats great in all this is that Petty does setup a pretty good mythology for his creatures that have been arounds for centuries feeding on the buffalo. With the encroachment of settlers into indian lands slaughtering the buffalo the creatures come out to feast on flesh be it indian or otherwise. And as I said for the most part when the creatures are hidden enshrouded in darkness and obscured in the forground they do have a mysterious nature being somewhat creepy that fades at about the hour mark when their revealed with a combination of bad CG and just bland design that just takes all the mystique and creepiness and loses it.
Which is sad. Like I said the initial story works with an alright twist at the end. The production design is good for what little is used. The actors are all good in their roles-although William Mapother and especially Doug Hutchison seem to be laying the cowboy accent on too much. And Petty takes his time building suspense and thrills until the final moments. A special note should also be made of Phil Parmet cinematography which does used a darkened color palette that works for the setting of the film and shoots night scenes with very little light where actors melt into the darkness surrounding them are hide in the light as the creatures stalk the outside.
In the end one thing made the movie a disappointment for me. It might not effect some others and I'll still say the film for what did was well made and inventive which is a rarity these days.
The disc from Lionsgate is good if skant on extras. The image and sound are all topnotch while extras consist of a commentary and two small featurettes.",1240272000,,2532,4.616407982261641
3772173,3,B001R10BJG,"My wife and I just watched this movie after we saw that it had been highly acclaimed by the first two reviews that were posted.  I'd have to say that I would definitely disagree with the person who said that this could be the best horror movie of 2009.  My wife and I both thought that this movie was just so-so and to be honest, it was actually a little boring.  The movie started off slow as was stated by someone else and took a while to get to the climax, but the end wasn't all that great and kind of left in a strange way.

What I did like about the movie was that it was well produced and was mostly shot in some really nice settings of the country how it would look like in the old days which was really nice and the cinematography was good.  The acting was pretty good and the story was alright.  The creatures looked kind of cool but didn't really show up till the end and weren't really all that freaky.  Overall I would say that it deserves a 3 star rating but my wife and I both felt a bit let down afterwards.  It was a decent movie though, I don't want to bash it too much but it definitely wasn't the 4.5 star movie that it was cracked up to be when I checked it out on amazon.",1238025600,5,1193,3.9831932773109244
3772174,5,B001R10BJG,"Every once in a while a horror movie comes along that stands out. The Burrowers is one of those movies. From the minute it starts, you feel you're watching something you haven't seen before. In this era of ""me too"" movies, that's the highest compliment I can pay it. Thank you Hollywood for sending us something different. The acting was top notch, the plot was great, and I was completely entertained from beginning to end. I bought this one, it's not a rental.",1237334400,,462,4.578313253012048
3772175,4,B001R10BJG,"I didn't know what to expect when I put the DVD into the player, but I wanted to give it a shot based on what I read in the product description. When the movie finished, however, I knew this was going to be the best horror movie of 2009.

For some reason, I felt like I was watching a long X-Files episode even though the movie takes place in the 1800s. As a matter of fact, the guy who played the commander of the calvary was the same guy who appeared as ""Eugene Victor Tooms"" in the first season of the X-Files.

I understand it had a run at the Toronto International Film Festival but I don't know how it did.

I don't want to make any more comments about this film because I don't want to ruin it for you. I will say that Hollywood needs to make more horror movies like this.

One more thing, FEARnet is showing the prequel to this movie called Blood Red Earth. It runs for 18 minutes. Check it out. That's what I'm going to do right now.",1236384000,7,942,4.075675675675676

3772225,4,B001R10BJG,Its an interesting take on a horror film that keeps the storyline moving at a good pace with a number of clever twists along the way. The creature effects are good and the Native American back story adds a lot to it as does the military leader that just wants to kill Indians. Its not a Tremors and its not a Bone Tomahawk but is more a story of what goes wrong when you mess with the food chain. I wouldnt hesitate to recommend this as a unique horror movie that is well worth a viewing.,1492819200,,488,4.09375

3772232,3,B001R10BJG,"I came across ""The Burrowers"" completely by accident. Looking through Amazon Prime for something entertaining while my favorite shows were on hiatus. ""The Burrowers"" is ""Bone Tomahawk"" eight years before that film. When a group of settlers are murdered and one woman taken, a rescue party (Clancy Brown, William Mapother, Karl Geary, Doug Hutchinson, Sean Patrick Thomas) sets out to bring her back and provide justice. They quickly discover they are out of their depth when something seems to be hunting them in the open prairie.

I haven't seen the Blu-ray (which, at the time of this writing is import only) nor the DVD so can't comment on any special features on those sets if this has been placed under those versions by Amazon. The transfer is clean looking. This was shot on film which benefits the gritty look of the project. Audio features a nice sounding, robust transfer. Dialog is clear and directional effects are often subtle (unless we hear a gun go off or the creatures).

A taunt, entertaining thriller written and directed by J. T. Petty, ""The Burrowers"" works well although the CGI could be a bit stronger for the film. Considering the budget (it was produced for around $7 million based on reports), Petty manages to assemble an impressive cast that helps bring the film to life. The performances are excellent all around.

This film deserves to be seen. It's a fun horror thriller.",1492300800,7,1402,4.882352941176471
3772233,4,B001R10BJG,Not bad at all. It was difficult to see the night s ends but other than that the spfx were good. Burrowing creatures that soften the innards to eat and burn up in the sun.

It manages to be a period-set piece with horror elements that feel genuine (unlike say Cowboys vs Aliens or Cowboys vs Dinosaurs that depend on their ridiculous juxtaposition for justification). The Burrowers is a slower-burning, historical horror that relies more on a constant tension and atmosphere over jump scares. Characters are a little stereo-typical and a lot morally flexible, backed by solid dialogue and storytelling. It all comes together in a way that keeps you intrigued and works all the better for its unique premise",1491782400,6,599,5.25

If you wait for Doug Hutchison's vicious cavalry officer to get his, you'll wait in vain. Nothing happens to him, while the woman's son suffers a horrible fate.
The creatures look like gray aliens walking backwards, but manage to be scary in places. If only the story did something with them, other than having them eat people and get dissolved by sunlight.
If you are curious and can watch it free, go ahead, but don't waste money on it unless you like nihilistic stories where everybody dies and it's all pointless.",1483401600,,756,4.868217054263566

3772263,1,B001R10BJG,"I bought this because the cover looked good...big mistake! Set in the 1870's, Mr. Coffy narrates about a girl who he plans to marry. Some families are attached by ""something"" and Coffy's girl goes missing. Members of the community get together with an army captain and his small regiment to rescue those taken, assuming the Indians are responsible. At some point, the army go their separate way and left are Coffey, tough guy, guy courting some woman, her young son, ex-slave. They start finding huge holes in the dirt and eventually find a girl that was taken. She has been buried and is in a coma like state. They hear something scratching inside her shoe.  They never find out what it is and it's never explained. They have the young son take the girl to head into town. Later that night, he gets attacked and buried too. The rest ride around, get attacked by Indians and loose the tough guy. Nothing much happens.  Many scenes are at night and it's so dark you can't see what's going on. I got bored I just skipped over some parts. Unfortunately, I did watch most of it and it just didn't make much sense. The army captain focuses on killing Indians which had nothing to do with the attacks. Everyone from the group dies except Coffy. He gets on his way and the camera shot shows another hole out of his sight and there is a woman mostly buried in a coma-like or dead (probably his fiance). Soon after, he gets to the army's campsite where he's met by the army captain and says nothing about has happened. The army captain goes on and on about killing Indians. He just turns into a mindless mute and just lets the captain blame the Indians. During the movie, you see the so-called perps for 10 seconds, but nothing is EVER explained. I enjoy movies where there may not be an explanation for every little thing, but usually enough is given so that it makes sense. This movie did not do that. After it was over, like others have stated, I could not get that 90 minutes back and just wondered WHAT WAS THAT? Not really sure what they people who put this together were going for.

3772350,5,B001R10BJG,"'The Burrowers' is a narrative collision of Larry McMurtry's uncompromising, entertaining tales of the American Frontier, and the inventive, troglodytic monstrosities of Neil Marshall's film, 'The Descent'. This is high-caliber historical horror, a sub-genre with very few notable examples; but Dan Simmons has mastered the material in literary form with novels like 'The Terror' and 'Drood'. This relatively unknown 2008 release written and directed by J.T. Petty is one of the most original, exciting, and terrifying horror films of the last few years, despite being largely ignored.

'The Burrowers' takes place in the Dakota Territory in 1879. When a caravan of Irish Immigrants is attacked and the survivors are believed taken by Native Americans, a search party sets out after them. Clancy Brown and William Mapother play hardened Indian fighters, and David Busse plays the young Irishman with personal reasons for finding the missing settlers.

They soon learn that the killers they're tracking aren't Native American, and in fact, aren't even human. Nightmarish creatures the Ute call 'Burrowers' once fed on the great herds of Buffalo that traversed the plains. Now that the Buffalo have been wiped out by white hunters, they have adapted to feed on the ever-increasing numbers of European settlers moving westward. Petty has envisioned horrific creatures that are fast and silent and rarely seen, nocturnal 'burrowers' who move under the cover of the grass and hunt in packs. They immobilize their prey with a toxin and bury them alive, allowing the poison to partially liquefy tissues without killing them. When they can finally eat their half-digested meal, the person is paralyzed but conscious, aware of every hellish, excruciating moment.

The brutality of the film is both shocking and historically appropriate, and the plot moves with a harsh, natural momentum that is very unpredictable. The characters have all the inconsistencies and contradictions of the real world, and the absolute hopelessness and mercilessness that afflicts the plains is as much a creation of man as it is these terrifying monstrosities. I think the bleak authenticity of the film turned off some viewers, as much as the violence. It's not perfect, by any means, but the iMDB rating of 5.8/10 is far too low, making 'The Burrowers' one of the most underappreciated horror films of the decade.

The Burrowers does it's share of borrowing, but never steals anything. it is in it's own right a new classic of the horror genre. The film has a great cast including resident loony Doug Hutchison('Tooms' from X-Files and 'Percy' from The Green Mile to name a few of his roles). Besides the cast, it has a a quality look to it with excellent pacing for those who like a simmering boil. With no CGI(YAY!:-D)and interesting looking monsters, this film plays like one of those classic old monster films from yesteryear. It has elements of Tremors, Motel Hell and Attack of the Giant Leeches, but is played totally straight.

3772359,3,B001R10BJG,"I gave this 3 stars for the concept. Monsters with clearly understood natures is rare in horror movies these days--these hunt for food, pure and simple. No monsters killing for ambiguous reasons, except for movie makers' insatiable appetites for gore. While the premise was interesting, I could not go higher on the stars. The acting was mixed, mostly mediocre to bad. There were also things that made no since. The heroes set off in search of the missing people but have no trail to follow or apparent destination in mind. Nor is there anything at the attack site to give them clues as to which tribe might have made the attack, therefore, who to pursue. Would the cavalry have dispatched such a small group to pursue ""hostiles""? there wasn't even a full troop! Also, the Burrowers poison their victims, bury them in shallow graves at the attack site, then come back after the venom has softened them up for dining (not giving much away, it is soon apparent). Got it. But in the case of Coffey's fianc, her jewelry is found days away from the attack site in a collection of other items being carried by Ute hunters, who apparently know how to kill the monsters. My main beef with the movie is the sound. One moment, the volume would drop too low to hear, then it would become painfully loud.

I know the job of advertisers is to promise a great product to make everyone rush out to buy it, and unfortunately there are those who fell for it hook, line and sinker here.

A few of the death scenes were creative, but overall the movie was just not good. Save your money, this movie will probably be on the Sci-Fi channel shortly. The creature effects are rather good, and it was refreshing to see only a partial use of disappointing CGI but it could not make it more watchable.

3772366,5,B001R10BJG,"The past few months, this strange compulsion has overtaken me: sit and watch a bunch of really, really bad independent horror movies.  Why, you ask?  Why would anyone put themselves through such torture?

Because of THE BURROWERS.  I decided to watch it one night, on a whim; I wanted a creature feature that I could turn on and tune out.  Except tuning out was next to impossible to do.  THE BURROWERS has a very simple premise: a family of settlers has been murdered, the women and children taken.  Presumably by Native Americans.  Enter the rescue posse, led by an amoral soldier, one of the missing girls' paramours, and some duty-bound citizens.  What they encounter is beyond anything they ever expected...or could hope to survive.

THE BURROWERS is, in many ways, relentless.  Suspend your disbelief enough--and, with such realistic acting and cinematography, that's pretty easy to do--and you'll completely buy into this story.  It's a small film, but fierce.  Some very disturbing imagery, and an underlying moral ambiguity that stays with the viewer afterwards.  THE BURROWERS is as realistic as a creature-feature (for that's technically what it is, though you may have trouble believing it, it's so good) can get.  It gets under your skin and stays there.  Hardly a conventional horror film; if you just want blood and guts and bikinis, go elsewhere.  This is the cinematic equivalent of ""literary horror.""

3772367,4,B001R10BJG,There is a lot of story to this film. That is in spite of the torture of an Indian and some dumb cowboy attitude to the film. For a lot of the film the creature isn't seen. Then there is a big finale towards the end. In general this is more of a creature film than a scary Halloween film. And most of the action is in the last 25 or 30 minutes. Unfortunately even though the ending has a somewhat happy end. There is still a surprise letdown at the end. They should have spread out the action through the film and they could have done away with the stupid he-man cowboy stuff which got in the way of the adventure and the story as well.

3772373,3,B001R10BJG,"The Burrowers (J. T. Petty, 2008)

When The Burrowers isn't trying to be a monster movie, it's actually quite a good tale; it spends a good amount of time examining white-Sioux relations in post-Civil War America for the first three-fourths of its length, and while I'm sure it cleaves rather loosely to the reality of the situation, it presents its case in a pretty convincing fashion nonetheless. Petty (S&Man) does a decent, if not stellar, job of trying to convey the complexity of the situation, and oddly, the film put me in mind of Meek's Cutoff more than once as our little party wanders around looking for the would-be fiancee of Fergus Coffey (Hamlet's Karl Geary), as well as the women and children of her family and neighboring homesteaders, all of whom vanished without a trace after the menfolk were dispatched in a bloody fashion. The local militia, of course, in the person of Henry Victor (The Green Mile's Doug Hutchinson), assumes the Sioux to be the culprits, and sets out for the local reservation with a small posse of mixed military and civilians to do some questioning. We find out how Victor  and ""his Indian"", Ten Bear (The New World's Anthony Parker), question folks when the party happens upon a lone Ute, Dull Knife (Hidalgo's David Midthunder), and apprehend him. (As I get older, I find there are some scenes I can't watch...) The party is repeatedly harassed at night, though, and eventually, they realize that what's after them doesn't really resemble the Indians they're used to...

...and that's where the movie gets conventional, predictable, and silly. If it had stayed in The Searchers mode and given us a mundane explanation for the disappearances (though perhaps one a little less politically incorrect than The Searchers have us), it might well have risen above genre conventions and become something pretty special, in the same way S&Man did. While the last quarter of the movie is nothing special, it's worth a gander for the first three-quarters. Also features arguably the most solid performance I've ever seen from William Mapother (The Grudge). ** ",1358812800,,2095,4.9601139601139606

There are two reasons why I gave it two stars instead of one:  1) the creatures were well done. While they never had me jumping in fear, they were pretty cool for B movie monsters. 2) It was fun spotting familiar actors.

3772379,4,B001R10BJG,"The Burrowers follows a small group searching for a family that they believe might've been abducted by Indians; what they (eventually) find is much more terryfing. The film is a mixture of the western, drama, and horror genres. Although it's often referred to as a horror film, it doesn't only rely on horror to entertain.

The story is thoroughly interesting and entertaining. This is coming from someone who usually dislikes western films. (I have only enjoyed a few, though.) The movie blends drama, mystery, and horror with a western setting; and it works well. You don't actually see the Burrowers until later in the film, although you do see them creeping in the unfocused background; ultimately, I did like the design of the Burrowers, but the effects could've been better. It's a fairly slow film, but it was able to keep me engaged most of the time. The acting was great, the music was also great but not actually what you would expect from a western, and it's shot very well (camera angles, etc.). The ending picks up the pace a bit and is also brutal, in a way.

The Burrowers is a great western/drama/horror. As of 10/28/12, this film is available on Amazon Prime Instant Video and Netflix Streaming.

3772380,3,B001R10BJG,"I was really excited to watch this film after reading all of the highly-rated reviews.  It starts out very strong, is well filmed, and has a pretty good production value.  The introduction spends just enough time establishing characters that you actually care about them a little, which is always a nice change of pace for a horror film.  This is not one of those gore-heavy slasher films, so if that's the standard you measure horror by, don't bother with this movie.  I personally prefer to let the horror speak for itself, and I think there was the right amount of blood without being excessive or unbelievable.  The cast is also pretty good, which includes the ever-awesome Clancy Brown.

I see a lot of comparisons made between this film and The Descent, although I'd say the later is a better film overall.  What I do think both films have in common is they run out of momentum towards the final act.  The Burrowers spins an entertaining yarn to a point, and then abruptly cuts the thread.  I honestly felt cheated by the end of this film.  It's almost like they ran out of time, and just wrote, ""The End,"" before the story was actually finished.  If the film hadn't been as good as it was up this point, I wouldn't have cared.  Instead, I'm frustrated, because I think it deserved better from the director, editor, or whoever made the decision to just cut it off.

This is definitely worth a rent, and by not being horrible, is likely better than 85% of the other horror movies you could have rented.  If you go in not expecting much, you'll be pleasantly surprised.",1350777600,,1573,4.571428571428571

We have the western setting complete with pioneer settlers, Indian conflict and the military. The writers and director managed to create dimension with the characters through using fairly accurate historical elements. Secondly, Production Value is key to a good movie experience.

That is great for a short radio drama --but for a horror movie, PLEASE!  I won't give many spoilers, but I found the execution here to be ultra lame. It isn't horrifying, it is a corporate diversity class pushes the point of the white man's evil against so-called Native Americans.

The story line is disconnected and the whole thing becomes rather pointless. As far as the creatures....I think they spent every bit of $10 for two used bug costumes at the Salvation Army Thrift Store in Hollywood.

I noticed several continuity issues but they are minor compared to the lack of overall continuity. Also, with all due respect to those who are proclaiming a love for ""period"" horror ---here's the problem with that: If I see cowboys and Indians being surrounded by some giant flesh-eating grasshopper looking bug monsters ---it's not the same as when I see someone in their home alone in the dark and the attic door starts to creek, and slowly open. Horror works best when the audience is thinking ""what is that happened to me right now?"" I can identify with the lone person in their house, just thinking about the possibility of my attic door opening makes me shiver as I write this. But people in the Old West of 1879??

 ""The Burrowers"" is an original little film to say the least. It makes a pretty damn good western, & commentary on how whites treated the Indians badly in the late 1900's. It makes for a nifty little horror film, as what the white settlers & Calvary thought was a Indian raid & massacre of a family, is not what happened, to their horror.

Very good acting, directing, & pacing compliment this film, with enough of a spooky soundtrack to intensify scenes just at the right moment. The creatures are a bit tough to make out in the dark, but in retrospect, that probably enhances this film too.

If I had to liken ""the Burrowers"" to any movie(s), I'd call it ""the Mole People"" on steroids, meets ""the Searchers."" Though no where near as good as film as ""The Searchers,"" (not many westerns are), it digs up ""the Mole People,"" & buries them for good!

This film is entertaining but disturbing on several levels... for the attitude of those in charge for Native Americans, the anguish of men who've lost families without no explanation of why, and the slowly-dawning admission that something lurks on the Great Plains that's a dangerous to everyone. Forethought and careful construct appear to have gone into this film which could be a social commentary of the settling of the early West as well as a horror story.

When settlers' homesteads are attacked and the women and children carried off, marauding Indians are immediately considered responsible and the local army officer in charge gleefully intends to wipe out every Sioux, Ute, or whatever he can find, no questions asked, summarizing up the general white attitude toward the Native American population at the time.  No matter that the Indians are also being slaughtered by the ""Burrowers"" and that a few are relatively friendly.  In the tense atmosphere of the search for missing loved ones, it's more shoot-first then worry about the consequences, which makes for a general mass of confusion and overall loss of life.

A well-constructed and thought-out production, with no real heroes or villains in the piece, but simply people seeking answers.  Good camera-work and some beautiful and haunting visuals.

Then comes the gut-punch of a family abducted by...something. To the director's credit, we don't see the somethings until well into the middle of the film.

But The Burrowers is less interested in the creatures, who are interesting but not groundbreaking, and prefers instead to focus on the conflict between the American Indians and the Northern occupational forces.

After tagging along with a military train led by psychopathic Captain Henry Victor (Doug Hutchison), they pick up African-American cook Callaghan (Sean Patrick Thomas) and decide to venture out on their own in pursuit of the kidnappers.

The kidnappers, of course, aren't the Indians but ancient beasts that paralyze their prey, bury it, and then eat them later. They are a byproduct of the war over the buffalo, which was their usual prey until the White man drove the buffalo to near extinction. All told, the monsters take up twenty minutes of the film.

The rest of the story is the unpleasant realities of war between the whites and Indians.  The Whites make no distinction between Ute (the ""bad"" Indians) and the Sioux (the ""good' Indians). Military forces use torture on their Indian captives.  Indians bash the faces in of fallen foes.  And no one has any compunction about shooting a man's horse.  This isn't the Wild West of the movies.

By the time the Burrowers are revealed, it's clear that humanity has inflicted far worse on each other. Sure, the Burrowers are disgusting, frightening, and predatory - but in comparison to the horrors of war, they're the lesser of two evils. The Burrowers ends on a nihilistic note, a welcome change from typical man vs. monster films. The fate of the protagonists is appropriately awful enough that it burrows into your brain long after the movie is over.",1315440000,,2295,5.0

The Burrowers does it's share of borrowing, but never steals anything. it is in it's own right a new classic of the horror genre. The film has a great cast including resident loony Doug Hutchison('Tooms' from X-Files and 'Percy' from The Green Mile to name a few of his roles). Besides the cast, it has a a quality look to it with excellent pacing for those who like a simmering boil. With no CGI(YAY!:-D)and interesting looking monsters, this film plays like one of those classic old monster films from yesteryear. It has elements of Tremors, Motel Hell and Attack of the Giant Leeches, but is played totally straight.

3772419,5,B001R10BJG,"THE BURROWERS

This has got to be one of the best blends of westerns and horror ever with a great story and wonderful acting. This is one of the most fun flicks I own and really enjoy it; writing and direction is spot on as well. So blend all of that together and you have one great film, really fun movie. Also throw in some great sets and locations and it makes for the perfect movie of its kind. Does it seem like I am just saying the same thing over and over just a little bit different each time, I hate that.

The film follows a group of men who meet up with some soilders after they all agree to go after a renegade group of Indians. Why are they after these Native Americans you might ask, well it is because they slaughtered a group of people on their ranch, or did they? The film follows this group as the dig deeper into the land after these murderers only to be ambushed by these unseen Natives. But the Indians seem to have a supernatural quality in escaping, maybe they aren't even human.

This movie is the perfect blend of westerns and horror films because it takes itself seriously enough to make them both fit. That is the best thing about this movie since most films that try to be this movie fail. They fail because they don't take both seriously, usually only one making the rest feels campy. The western part of this movie feels like a really good western, actually a classic one to be honest. The story of these guys after the rebel Indians is very entertaining, in fact if that would have been the movie it would have great.

The horror part of this film is also wonderful as the takes it time to build up and lets us get to know the characters. It also feels like the classic horror films from back in the day, writer/director J.T. Petty did an excellent job here. The cast as well was pitch perfect here with every one of them delivering an excellent performance. I honestly was not expecting this flick to be as good as it was, really surprised and happy. I recommend this film to any western, horror, or just movie fan out there.",1303948800,,2057,4.293814432989691

3772422,4,B001R10BJG,"With a foreboding darkness that exudes uneasiness comparable to the tense atmosphere in The Descent, director J.T. Petty smartly utilizes pitch black, starless skies to create a sense of claustrophobia even though the characters are in the wide open plains of the Dakotas during the late 1800's.  With no ambient light for hints or clues, the characters must stay close to the glowing ring of nighttime fire or risk being picked off one by one into the darkness by what quickly becomes a living nightmare.

I really liked the build up for this movie.  Each detail is cleverly crafted and given incrementally.  The people snatched up in the middle of the night leave no blood, no real struggle.  Those who are found after capture lie in shallow graves, are borderline comatose, and have bizarre wounds, the likes of which even the Indian legends of burrowers can't describe.  Initially and uniformly suspicious of local Indians, a civilian group of hunters - led by Irishman splits from their military escort because they believe the locals are not to blame.

Even the final reveal is rendered in dark contrasts to the otherwise sepia-toned Western film.  There are details that allow the viewer to fill in the mental picture and create an anticipation - always greater than reality - that creates an even greater sense of dread.  I didn't particularly care for the conclusion, but not all movies can be wrapped in a bow.

Relying less on the stylized pastoral landscapes of typical Westerns and more on the gritty, realistic isolation of that time-period, the greater sum of suspense and mystery overwhelms the ridiculous inclusion of a Manifest Destiny angle.  I highly recommend this Western/Horror hybrid.

The story is about a group of pioneers searching for missing children and women - they seem to feel the missing persons were abducted by Indians. What they run into are called Burrowers which eat rotting corpses. They bury their victims alive and then eat them once they are rotten enough. Sounds pleasant enough right ? There are a few horrific scenes & a few jump out of your chair jolts. There wasn't any over the top gore at least by my standards.
The film is set in the Old West. I keep wanting to label it the dark side of Tremors actually.
Personally I thought the film was okay - good but I just wasn't into the characters, maybe a little too bland, maybe a little too 'western' for me. The performances were fine, but as with some films the characters don't grab you. Im not really into westerns so that part was a minus but the horror elements made it overall fun to watch, at least toward the 2nd half of the movie. It does drag out for a while until we get to see out supernatural night crawlers..there were some slow points but when the monsters come around things pick up.

Writer / Director J.T. Petty unleashes this highly original and thrilling creature feature set in the Old West, which features stunning cinematography and equally impressive performances. Petty creates an authentic period piece through his careful scripting, the characters' individual cadences, costuming, and a washed out color palette filled with mild earth tones. THE BURROWERS also builds its own unique mythology surrounding the underground dwellers that mixes Indian folklore with the horrors of Westward Expansion. These twisted creatures are hinted at frequently but kept just out of sight long enough to build a rising tension that keeps the film moving at an excellent pace while maintaining a plateau of suspense. When the Burrowers are finally revealed, their computerized design is hardly noticeable thanks to a clean design and key lighting. THE BURROWERS is a rare example of pure originality that is not often seen in the genre, and is sure to appeal to Gothic Horror fans who can appreciate its brooding atmosphere and mood.

So I popped it into the computer, settled in a for a look and wow...Clancy Brown and the dude from LOST are in this movie!?! It got my attention straight away and before I knew it...I'm actually watching this horror flick set in the Dakota territory. Yes, there are monsters, but true to form, the scouts and cavalry are looking for bad injuns. Of course the Indians already know about these here monsters that are making folks disappear.

I particularly liked the mangled translations of the one guy who understood Sioux. It's realistic and it ultimately hurts the scouts as they search for the disappeared. It was a nice touch that added some depth to this film.

Not to rehash the plot as better reviews give you the story in more detail, but I do want to point out that this movie really worked well as a western. And I actually found myself enjoying it more as a western than as a horror flick. I really enjoyed the encounter in the woods with the Sioux Indians. Overall, a really well done scene with varied terrain and an outcome that wasn't what you would have expected.

And finally, the harshness of the people, the monsters, and the unrelenting plains really gave this flick the grittiness of a solid western. There are no happy endings and the final scene really was pretty horrifying to me. Can't imagine going out that way.

3772429,4,B001R10BJG,"A horror movie set in the old west, The Burrowers is in the gritty, hard-edged end of the westerns spectrum, and taps into suspense and deadly monsters on the horror front.  When a frontier family is found savagely murdered - with some members missing - it's assumed they were killed by Indians and the survivors have been taken captive.  A posse led by John Clay (the always effective Clancy Brown) quickly forms to track down the abductors and rescue the survivors.

  Things start to go from bad to worse when the hunt is commandeered by the cavalry and its thuggish commander.  The original intent of John and company is to go after whoever's responsible for the massacre and the abductions; to the commander, since Indians were responsible, it's an excuse to shoot up any Indians they happen to come across.  Heavily armed and outnumbering the members of the original posse that they're riding with, the commamder and his goons turn a hunt for justice into a debacle and, unable to stop them or to stomach them, the original posse splits off to try and return to its original mission.  Neither party is prepared for the fact that it wasn't Indians at all who took part in the massacre, but something totally unknown to white men.  Some of the tribes know of the tales of these 'burrowers', and one rider who gets captured by the cavalry could have possibly given them some information about the creatures, but having been blindsided while minding his own business, then tortured at the commander's orders, he's little inclined to help his captors out.

  One of the captives is found alive - just barely breathing, paralyzed and buried alive in the middle of the desert.  As the hunt continues, it becomes clearer that they're not dealing with a group of renegade Indians, but the posse has no choice but to continue on and try to find the rest of the abductees, and whoever or whatever took them.  Which leads them closer and closer to the home territory of the legendary 'burrowers'.

  The Burrowers is a very good movie in its own right, with an added virtue.  This is one that could prompt fans of westerns to start checking out horror movies, and horror fans to give some westerns a try.

3772431,2,B001R10BJG,"This monsters meet Cowboys/Cavalry/Indians movie was disappointing.

Good Points
1.  Good film backdrop.  The surrounding scenery was as dead looking, desolate and as ugly as the monsters.

2. Several characters were likable such as the forlorn love lost cowboy looking for his girl, the young cowboy and the black ex-slave cowboy starting his life over.

Bad Points
1. At the start of film a family of 1 man, 2 women and 2 children run and hide in a cellar while 1 man  stays behind to fight.  The wooden cellar door has obvious cracks and those hiding can clearly see the sky/stars. They also hear the scuffle and the man left above screaming in agony and fear. The viewer cringes at the obvious stupidity of the hiding people who instead of shutting off their lantern instead allow the light to SHINE up into the night through those cracks to pinpoint their exact hiding place.

2. The young cowboy taking the paralyzed girl (from toxin the monsters gave her) removes her from the wagon so both of them could sleep far apart on the hard cold ground with no blankets and a fire. It would have made more sense to sleep in the wagon close to each other for body heat and safer also monster or no monsters .  With the horses still hooked up to the wagon and them laying in the wagon bed, if the monsters attacked, the spooked horses would have warned them awake giving the cowboy time to jump to the seat and get the horses to run. The horses may have bolted away on their own also so all the cowboy had to do was crawl from the bed to the seat and grab the reins (loosely tied to the seat). Either way, they get away. But then the point of the movie was to have them laying on the ground so the monsters could get to them easier since they are ground burrowers and are not very tall or built to climb into a high wagon bed, or chase a wagon pulled by horses.

3. Film Inconsistency #1: The Burrowers are supposed to bury their victims alive and eat them only after decomposition has begun.  Yet on several occasions, including the young cowboy (fingers moving as being eaten), the cowboy on the fallen log (actually screaming while being eaten) and the young paralyzed girl, the victims are eaten alive.

4. Film Inconsistency #2 When forlorn cowboy leaves his shot in leg cowboy friend and 2 Indians for help, he is seen riding off with TWO horses.  But, later is seen traveling towards the Army camp with just one horse.  What happened to the 2nd horse?

5.  The army and the cowboys grab the first Indian they find in this vast wasteland and torture him by cutting off his testicles (? Couldn't watch this scene) to get him to say where the 'kidnapped"" family was when the army had no clue if this Indian was even involved in the kidnapping.  The cowboys stood around and let it happen and only the black cowboy had the heart to try to feed the Indian.

6.  The forlorn cowboy acted stupidly by bringing back the army (when he knew what happened to the first Indian #5) to ""help"" the uninjured female Indian (they captured her but she helped them anyway to save herself), the male Indian injured while trying to kill the cowboys but who saved all their lives by telling forlorn cowboy how to kill the creatures and the black cowboy who was accidentally shot in the leg.  I KNEW watching this film that if he didn't find a settler family or Indian family to help them and brought back the army, the army would kill the Indians.  Sure enough the next scene is the 2 Indians hanging side by side from a tree.  The forlorn cowboy knew the army doctor was little more than a quake so there was nothing they could do for the injured Indian anyway.  Logically, he should have told the 2 Indians to stay put and left them one of the 2 remaining horses. The injured cowboy and forlorn cowboy could have ridden out on the last horse for help.  If the Army was all the help they could find, then forlorn should have secretly ridden back with food/water to at least give the Indians a chance at life.  In retrospect, the black cowboy didn't fare so well under the army either as they killed him cutting off his leg.  The only person who benefited from getting the army was the forlorn cowboy.

7.  All the decent people died in this film except the forlorn cowboy.  It would have been a nice touch to see that arrogant cruel army leader eaten by the monsters and some of his cruel men with him.

8.  Lame rather abrupt ending.",1263600000,4,4417,4.396063960639607

3772433,4,B001R10BJG,"From my review in RedFence Magazine:

""The cinematography in this piece achieved a level far beyond most indie fodder. Likewise, the filmmakers have fashioned fresh dialog, true characters, and time-period detail without succumbing to stodgy, history-spouting caricatures. J.T. Petty wrote a daring plot, opting for a series of late-night suspense sequences rather than the normal sweeping flow of most Westerns. This keeps the audience lost in the dark, placing them inside the exhausted heads of the main characters as they fight a losing battle, night after night.

On the whole, this film may be too bleak for its own good. When a Native American reveals that the burrowers eat human flesh because the settlers depleted their normal supply of buffalo, the film turns into a not-so-subtle metaphor for Manifest Destiny, and I found it hard not to squirm with physical and philosophical discomfort as the burrowers crept through the tall grass to claim their victims.

With modern audiences moving away from darker fair, and the constant battle for ticket sales that Westerns have fought since the 1970s, it's no wonder The Burrowers dug itself deep to the bottom of the DVD clearance pile at Wal-Mart.

But it's a shame. When great underground films stay below the surface, we're left with the hollow reboots and remakes that live in the neon lights of sprawling, corporate mega-plexes.""",1262736000,4,1390,5.164444444444444

Don't get me wrong - there are great payoffs and big scares (there's actually one moment in particular where I screamed like a little girl in the theater), but when I think about the film the characters really stuck with me.  And that's a big deal, as so many genre films don't bother with characters, preferring snappy prime-time-sounding artificial dialogue played out by two-dimensional over-groomed 20-somethings.

This film, on the other hand, plays out in a very realistic (and suspenseful) fashion and allows the characters to get under the audience's skin so that when someone's in danger, we actually care.  The acting is top-notch all the way around, and it will pull you through the deliberately-paced film without wanting to take your eyes off the screen.

3772438,3,B001R10BJG,"A Western-Horror-Monster movie hybrid? Consider me interested. I would love to see an old-fashioned Western gorefest with six-shooters a-blazing against several out worldly creatures. ""The Burrowers"" attempts to bring such a premise to fruition; it would be very cool to see monsters menacing the western genre. However, director/writer J.T. Petty has other ideas and goes in another way in portraying our flesh-eating antagonists in the film. One may say it is another take on the vampire myth.

Dakota Territories, 1879. When the Stewart family disappeared in the night, foul play at the hands of the local Native Americans are suspected. A prairie tracker named Will Parcher (William Mapother) hooks up with the local army led by Henry Victor (Doug Hutchinson) to try to find the missing clan. Joining the search is an outlaw named Clay (Clancy Brown), a former slave named Walnut, a boy and a lovesick young man named Coffey (Karl Geary). They cross the wide landscape looking for clues, Parcher and the men uncover living bodies in shallow graves; still alive but unable to move or even speak; they are proof that something demonic is going on. They learn that a mysterious pack of blood-thirsty creatures are now on their trail, looking to render them motionless, bury them alive so their organs can be liquefied and then eaten alive...

J.T. Petty resists the temptation to present us with a film whose potential for blood and gore is ignored in favor of characterization. While this is a monster film, and its key target audience would be horror fans, Petty tries to give his audience a quiet and moody tone than just presenting a visually stunning, fast-paced gorefest. His approach is to be commended, as we get to know the characters a little better and we may be subjected to some surprises in the western genre. Too bad we don't really get to see much of a gooey lunch buffet, but the direction does try to be methodical, as we see our heroes encounter other obstacles such as Indians to make things a little more complicated for our protagonist; yes, this is where some gunfights begin.

The characterization is decent enough, as we see our characters interact; they are still a squad of archetypes though. The screenplay does tend to favor emotional behavior and hysterics to generate a few scares. However, male bonding and conversation doesn't really aid in the development of suspense, Petty's intentions may be good but the script just fails a bit in mixing in its horror and dramatic elements. The film gets to be a bit of drag, unfortunately when there are no Native Americans or when the ""Burrowers"" aren't around, the film becomes somewhat of a bore.

The creatures looked like they are spider-like hairless, flesh-eating creatures. They do look creepy, and they are fascinatingly almost human-like. Their appearance does have that B-movie inspiration, and thankfully instead of CGI, Petty and company utilizes the use of puppets for their faces. But the creatures are animated via CGI, so when they move it gets a little cheap. Their habits are undoubtedly disquieting, as they cut your neck, poison you with their saliva, then as soon as you are immobile; they bury you, waiting for your insides to rot so that they may feed on your gooey innards while you are still awake. Kind of freaky if you asked me, some qualities seemed very similar to the Komodo Dragon and to the myths of vampire lore. The creatures can be driven off by bullets, but it won't kill them. The only way would be to drug them with bait and spear them to keep them in place until dawn. The only vulnerability they have is sunlight, and no, they don't sparkle as in the abysmal vampire movie ""Twilight"". Petty also brings the Native Americans to bring the `white man's' abuse of natural resources that leads to the creatures into preying on humans.

Petty goes into some historical unease as demonstrated in the film's last act, but instead of serving up some sympathy, it may just confuse the occasional movie watcher. I guess it would be because of the film's uneven direction and somewhat slow-moving screenplay. There are also several distracting elements and plot holes in the movie that any kind of climax that isn't carefully fleshed out may tend to frustrate and leave a dissatisfied sensation. I did look at the climax as a way to show that humans are capable of stupidity and hostile acts as monsters themselves. To its credit, ""The Burrowers"" attempt to do something compelling and different, but it was obvious that the film became hampered by its budget. It is a satisfying diversion but won't really stand out because of its lack of thrills and suspense.

I know the job of advertisers is to promise a great product to make everyone rush out to buy it, and unfortunately there are those who fell for it hook, line and sinker here.

A few of the death scenes were creative, but overall the movie was just not good. Save your money, this movie will probably be on the Sci-Fi channel shortly.  The creature effects are rather good, and it was refreshing to see only a partial use of disappointing CGI but it could not make it more watchable.

Overall the film does not take you anywhere. Even in the final moments, which is one of the most anti-climactic horror endings in all of horror films.

A constantly boring creature-feature Western.

Do yourself a favor: do miss this one.",1249862400,6,887,4.478260869565218
3772442,4,B001R10BJG,"I had mixed feelings upon entering The Burrowers; a direct-to-DVD horror/western from writer/director J.T. Petty.  Though it is occasionally slow moving and doesn't quite pick up until a quarter of the way through its running time, The Burrowers is a surprisingly good that not only mizes the best elements of the horror film and the western, but ends up leaving quite an impression by the time the credits start to roll.  The story of the film revolves around an assembled posse that includes Doug Hutchison, Clancy Brown, William Mapother (yes, a trio of Lost vets), Karl Geary, and Sean Patrick Thomas; all of whom set out to recover a family that has vanished and has presumed to be captured by Indians.  Needless to say, they all discover that there is something much, much worse going on.  The best aspect of The Burrowers is that the film is actually quite suspenseful.  There aren't any of the ""fake scares"" that horror flicks these days are usually populated with, and instead Petty opts for some good old fashioned scares to go along with the more blood-curdling and violent moments.  Not to mention the fact that the film is beautifully shot with some gorgeous cinematography that really makes it seem as if the film is taking place back in the 1800s West.  The only real flaw with The Burrowers is how long it takes to really get firing on all cylinders, but despite this, the film remains something special indeed for a direct-to-DVD horror flick.  Considering we get horror crud like Hostel 2, The Unborn, and countless others released in theaters, it's a shame to see something like The Burrowers not get a theatrical release.  Hopefully though, it will find the following on DVD that it so rightly deserves.",1244073600,2,1723,4.813559322033898
3772443,4,B001R10BJG,"The Burrowers belongs to a new style of movies in the horror genre, a combination of monster thrills and old wild-west action westerns. As such, it represents a curiosity worth exploring by any fans of horror.

What I found particularly interesting, aside from the concept of slimy creepy crawlers, is the honesty and innocence with which the characters greeted their fate  - an utter acceptance of the possibility of death, which is in sharp contrast with the sanctity of life characteristic of the modern day horror films.

The movie begins with a grizzly action scene - murder of a family in a little house on the prairies of Dakota.  The scenes curiously resemble the hide and seek qualities we've seen in `The Village' and the mysterious peasant deaths in The Brotherhood of the Wolf. And as the family is destroyed, the viewers adventure begin. We suddenly embark on a trip with the group of cowboys whose task is to find a survivor to this violent incident. And the deeper the group advances into the Indian territories, the more they face attacks by unknown and unseen monsters.

Soon the mystery begins to untangle as the of main character, a brave Irishman, begins to put the pieces together. This act of boldness is the first venture into the possibility of the impossible - imagining that their troubles are caused not by viscous Indians, but by something supernatural and a lot more dangerous.

As one by one the characters meet their fates, the viewers are drawn deeper into the dark mind of the movie creator where fear, death and feeding converge.

At the end of the movie one is left with a sense of outrage at the primitive mindset of the men in charge. We glimpse the rage and weakness of all immigrant in a land where rules are either scarce or nonexistent.

High grade for the acting, concept and representation. Movies in similar fashion:

) The Village
) Brotherhood of the Wolf
) Predator
) Wild Wild West",1243900800,3,1929,4.717261904761905
3772444,4,B001R10BJG,"This is a great film who did not get a theatrical release... sadly because the cinematography is gorgeous and the whole project is many times superior to other horror films who actually get a wide release.

The director here did an excellent job recreating a western scenario where a group of men go on a journey in search of a family of settlers who were (they think) abducted by indians - when in fact, the abductors are a breed of underground creatures who feed on the humans they keep paralyzed under the earth.

The characters are great, the actors are great, cinematography is top-notch, music is great... everything is perfect.

...but the only thing that prevents me from giving this film five stars was a strange taste of ""I've seen all this before in other films"". Don't get me wrong, because I DO think this film is a true labor of love superior to most of the junk we see today. But somehow the utilization of elements we already saw in films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Descent/dp/B000IHY9TS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Descent</a>&nbsp;(the group of monstrous flesh-eating humanoids...) or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tremors/dp/0783226837/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tremors</a>&nbsp;(...who live under the earth) left me a bit unimpressed and disappointed. The idea that came into my head was that this film was a great combination of formulas I've seen before BUT under a (unusual) western scenario.

Maybe that's why it did not get a theatrical release.

STILL... this is a gorgeous horror film that even being a mixture of other films we all have seen before, still manages to keep you interested all the way until the end - thanks to a master director who clearly has great taste.

So if you are looking for a superior work of horror, give this DVD a try.",1241136000,21,1880,5.421232876712328
3772445,4,B001R10BJG,"""The Burrowers"" reminds why the serious horror fan must continue to scour the endless flood of direct-to-DVD releases. These films are generally lousy, usually quick, craft-free cash-ins, but sometimes a quality film slips through. I suspect the well-crafted ""The Burrowers"" slipped through because it is completely unmarketable. It's a rare horror-western that will leave many conventional horror fans wondering when the monsters will show, while those looking for a western may find the horror movie climax off putting. It's not merely a horror-western, but a moody art western and a slow-burn, atmospheric horror film, both of which will turn off much of their fan base. As such, ""The Burrowers"" is hardly a flawless film, but it's surprisingly novel and ambitious, particularly for a non-theatrical release. (Though, with a budget of 7 million, it's actually quite a bit more pricy than many theatrical horror movies.) Thrills may be in short supply, but it's a gorgeous, strange film, that steadily generates sense of dread.

Like many of your modern, artier westerns, ""The Burrowers"" has a thin story. In the Dakota territories a large family is attacked, with some members killed and others dragged from their home alive by an unseen, monstrous assailant. The locals assume this was an Indian raid and send out a search/retribution party to retrieve any survivors, though this party slowly discovers that the conventional narrative does not apply.

""The Burrowers"" is a gorgeous film, and the sepia-tinged photography takes full advantage of the New Mexico landscape. Petty also displays a great range visually, sometimes abandoning the slow, steady style for a bit of fast paced action or a conventional horror scene. That said, the film is also quite dialogue and character heavy, with the main weakness that, though well acted, the figures are somewhat clichd and not overly compelling. Irishman Coffey (Karl Geary) is the central everyman character, whose fiance-to-be disappeared in the attack, while Henry Victor (Doug Hutchison) is the brutal, bigoted military man and Will Parcher (Will Mapother) is the gruff, no-nonsense sort who has difficulty accepting the surreal nature of the task. (There are a few other stock characters, like the sympathetic black cook and the young, nave kid who needs to prove himself.) The characters are ultimately quite likable, when they're supposed to be, but they're never quite compelling. Related to this, the film is sometimes irritatingly PC, rehashing the same old tropes about abusing the Native Americans, killing the buffalo, racism etc. For once this material is genuinely related to the story, but it's still heavy-handed and repetitive. These elements are secondary to the mood and horror, but had they been handled more adroitly they could've lifted it to another level.

The strongest aspect of ""The Burrowers"" is the slow build, where the trappings of conventional European civilization are steadily stripped away as the party moves further from home, and the natural finally bridges the supernatural. Director/Writer J.T. Petty is careful not to give away much initially, building detail after detail: the mysterious wounds; the lack of the blood; the bizarre damage to nearby foliage and soil; the vague Indian tales of the burrowers; the paralyzed, buried-alive victims. Were a viewer to miss the first 5 minutes of the film, it might take 45+ minutes to realize that there was anything legitimately supernatural occurring. This is what I like best in horror, the almost imperceptible slip from the real to the unreal, and ""The Burrowers"" executes this transition with special care.  When we finally meet the creatures they are not particularly stunning, in the final analysis, but this is an inevitable disappointment. If nothing else, the creatures are better than most and surprisingly good looking for such a low-budget film.

The conclusion will, no doubt, split audiences, as many will likely find it disappointingly conventional. The climax is merely solid but the film has a terrific epilogue that redeems it, and that brings the film back to its roots. ""The Burrowers"" ends not in horror, but in a bleak, hopeless melancholy driven home by the final shot. It may not be what most horror or western fans are looking for, but it has an impact. Check it out.

3772446,5,B001R10BJG,"I had heard some buzz about writer/director J.T. Petty's latest film, ""The Burrowers"", but had no idea what to expect when I received my copy from NetFlix.  I was amazed by this film - not since Alex Turner's brilliant period horror, ""Dead Birds"" (2005), has a movie really given me hope that the horror genre has not been taken over by CGI garbage, PG-13 crap and pretty 20-something ""actors"".  And I was surprised to discover that ""The Burrowers"" has ties to ""Dead Birds"" - the creatures in both films were designed by Robert Hall and his company, Almost Human.  No wonder I was so unsettled.

Set in the Dakota Territories in 1879, the plot revolves around the mysterious murders and disappearances of settlers in the area.  Knowing Indians MUST be the culprits, an Army outfit, led by Henry Victor (""Lost"" and ""X Files"" actor, Doug Hutchison) as well as some Indian trackers led by William Parcher (""Lost"" and ""The Grudge"" actor, William Mapother) and John Clay (Clancy Brown, another ""Lost"" alum!) head out in search of the kidnapped settlers.  After disagreements break out between the Army and the Indian hunters, the two groups go their separate ways but Mapother and company are soon to discover that what they are hunting is FAR more dangerous and horrific than they ever imagined!  Along with the Indian hunters are Irish immigrant Fergus Coffey (Karl Geary), whose sweetheart, Maryanne is among the missing, an ex-slave, ""Walnut"" Callaghan (Sean Patrick Thomas) and a young man, Dobie (Galen Hutchison), whose mother is being courted by Parcher.

The film unfolds slowly, letting the sense of dread increase as characters are picked off, one by one.  And when all hell finally breaks loose, the wait is definitely worth it.  Petty (""S&Man (2005), ""Soft for Digging"" (2001)) knows what scares us and he also knows that most horror fans want something new.  ""The Burrowers"" might best be described as ""The Searchers"" by way of Neil Marshall's ""The Descent"".  Petty's cinematographer, Phil Parmet, who DP'd Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"" (2007) and ""The Devil's Rejects"" (2005) gets that ""antique"" look just right.  And Robert Hall's creatures...I will leave it at that.  There are images from this film that will stay with me for quite a while.

I know that many horror fans won't have the patience for a film like ""The Burrowers"" (much like ""Dead Birds"").  But for those fans famished for something truly unique and horrifying, ""The Burrowers"" is for you.  Bravo, J.T. and company!!  This one is a keeper!",1240531200,66,2510,4.949880668257757

The horror of this story is visceral, bleak, and uncompromising. It is not a wall-to-wall gorefest, but once bad things start to happen they do not stop.
