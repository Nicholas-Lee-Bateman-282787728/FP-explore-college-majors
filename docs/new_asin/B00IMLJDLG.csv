6281612,5,B00IMLJDLG,"I am an advanced skier - who seldom writes reviews - and as I thoroughly enjoyed Klaus' first DVD got this one as soon as I heard he had created a new one.

When I went through the table of contents was not very impressed ... after going through it in detail and following his drills and areas of focus, I must say it has indeed improved my skiing. Great filming which makes it even easier to follow as he combines different angles. I strongly recommend this DVD even if you feel you are a good skier.

The only complaint I have is that it came out at the end of my skiing season :)",1396569600,,582,4.052173913043478

8643368,5,B00IMLJDLG,"Ski teacher myself. I gave it to a friend of mine as a present and I got one for myself to give to the kids (so that it is not just dad talking). I like the fact that Klaus teaches skiing by not getting into any ""religious"" nonsense like carving vs old-style etc. He teaches ""music"" by teaching you the meaning of ""scales and scale progressions"" and showing you how these skills are used. It is up to you to decide what type of ""music"" you are gonna play yourself on the slopes.",1456012800,2,478,4.150537634408602

8643370,5,B00IMLJDLG,I flat out think Klaus is the best ski instructor I have ever seen.  In addition I don't think there is a prettier more graceful skier anywhere.  Today when ski instruction starts at $150/hour you can't go wrong.  i guarantee it.,1450483200,,229,4.536585365853658
8643371,5,B00IMLJDLG,"This second DVD from Klaus Mair is actually self-contained. We learnt so much from the first video and from Klaus himself. But interestingly, he again starts from square one proceeds systematically. What he has done is add in (and you have to progressively watch this to get to those parts) some key elements of racing, no gates, just the types of turn initiations, transitions, and control and then goes on to show you some critical factors which come into play in skiing steep terrain, moguls and powder. I am personally partial to the first video, as I just thought it was a masterpiece. This one has more information for advanced and expert skiers, and if you can ski even half as well as Klaus, you are an expert. Don't try it at home but Klaus can ski most inbound terrain anywhere switch, i.e. backwards. What is best about him is that he is patient, friendly and picks up on your weaknesses. If you watch carefully, and pay attention, you are going to become a better skier, I'd bet on it. His drills, some are known , others are quite original actually and a lot better than the standard fare out there.

There is only one Klaus Mair. A class act who created the best ski instruction series of videos yet. Will be hard to top this for any instructor. And it is rare to see someone ski with such, grace, finesse and tesla-esque aggression, therein lies the hard part, it is going to be very hard to ski like Klaus, but we can all try, that is the goal.",1435968000,2,1460,4.4275092936802976
8643372,5,B00IMLJDLG,"Several of us purchased this DVD. We're all full certified PSIA Ski Instructors. We loved it.... Granted, it's nothing we haven't seen or discussed before amongst ourselves and students. However, Klaus puts just a little different spin on it that caused us all to cough up the money to buy it. The ski sequences are great and Klaus does a great job explaining some complicated aspects of skiing in the simplest of terms.... Great job Klaus....",1428451200,2,443,4.842105263157895
8643373,5,B00IMLJDLG,Brilliant DVD!,1420156800,,14,6.5
8643374,5,B00IMLJDLG,"I love this new DVD, it is amazing !
I loved Klaus's first DVD (From Blue to Black Diamond) also !
In the introduction, Klaus Mair says this about his new DVD:
""Please excuse if the Video and Audio quality is sometimes not great, The focus of this low budget, sponsor free production lies in the content and to assure that the lesson are the way I want them, I am doing all the editing myself. Sofa Ski School is a product of Ski Instructors that want to make knowledge on how to ski accessible to a bigger group...""
So, I find it quite impressive that along with explaining  the complex movements of skiing in such simple and easy to understand terms and concepts, that Klaus also edited this DVD himself to produce a fiercely informative DVD with such spectacular shots and views of such beautiful surroundings. I found no issues by the way with either the video or audio quality, especially as Klaus points out, this DVD is about the content and that is also why I wanted to buy it. I thought the editing was very professional looking and the graphical video aids that Klaus used to explain his precise instruction was very very good.
I reckon I am pretty much an advanced intermediate skier also. In the past I got one or two private ski lessons costing maybe 60 to 80 bucks each for 1 to 2 hours. Those lessons were quite good and I took from them one or two points to work on. The downside though was that I never felt it was value for money for me. With Klaus's DVD's however, the value for money cannot be described because I have them for life and can watch them again if I forget anything. And as one other commentator similarly pointed out, every time I watch the DVD's over, I always pick up additional information that I might have missed the first time*, which therefore improves my skiing level further and further each time.
*Actually I think it is not so much having missed information the first time, but rather as I improve as a skier by using and repeating the instruction drills given by Klaus, that when I watch his DVD's again I understand more and therefore observe more each time. The result being; continuous improvement.
I have recommended this DVD (and his first DVD) to others and will continue to do so. I feel the way Klaus describes the different basic fundamentals of skiing in such easy to understand ways along with his precise demonstration and graphical video aids totally hits the mark.
I love skiing and the more I improve by watching Klaus's DVD's, the more I love skiing. We are going skiing in a couple of weeks and I cannot wait, especially to try out Klaus's tips on skiing the bumps.
Happy New Year, from Ireland!

8643375,5,B00IMLJDLG,"This DVD is definitely worth purchasing, I bought this last year after having the first DVD Blue to Black Diamond. Blue to Powder is a great DVD for all level of skiers. I am an Advanced Intermediate skier - last season I was able to ski the bumps, and now that the new ski season is here I have watched the video over again and am finding more skills that I would like to focus on, (such as hip positioning). You can never outgrow this DVD - as you watch this over and over you tend to  pick up new information that will help your skiing.",1419984000,,539,4.084905660377358
8643376,5,B00IMLJDLG,"Great DVD. Starting from the fundamentals, DVD teaches you how to improve your skills. It has some extra modules on powder, bumps/offpiste.
It has helped me a lot and my progression has increased significantly. Additionally DVD has been recorded in Trebelcone a great ski resort in New Zeland, where the landscape is really beautiful. Sure you will enjoy it!",1418860800,,358,5.084745762711864
