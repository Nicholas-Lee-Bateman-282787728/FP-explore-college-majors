5657312,5,B00BNAE4DU,"I had expected ""Ring of Fire"" to be another made-for-TV type of (typical) disaster film, but this is really an incredible delight, filled with action, suspense and great acting from the entire cast! With all the oil and gas drilling, fracking, etc. taking place on our planet, ""Ring of Fire"" is certainly possible, which lends credence to this (potential) end-of-days miniseries. ""Alias"" star Michael Vartan leads a great cast.",1369008000,13,427,5.202898550724638

5657328,3,B00BNAE4DU,"And by that I mean the camera work, not the volcano. This isn't the worst disaster movie I've ever seen, but there were a few drawbacks that makes this a 3-star movie at best.

Let me first say that I have a serious weakness for disaster movies, and I have an incredibly high tolerance for cheesy special effects, lame characters, and ridiculous plot lines. I've got everything in my collection from Asylum movies, 80s made-for-tv movies, Sci-Fy channel flicks, and Hollywood blockbusters. I generally love them all (even the really bad ones).

That said, this was a tough one to like, mainly because the camera work was atrocious. I think they shot the entire 3-hour movie using a cheap hand-held camera, and the person holding the camera was *way* over their coffee quota for the day. I expect the camera to shake during earthquake sequences (and it did), but I don't see any reason for shakiness when two people are sitting on a couch talking (and there was). It just got worse as the movie went on, and by the end I was actually a little queasy.

However, the bad camera work aside, Ring of Fire was pretty standard fare as far as disaster movies go. It's a typical ""unethical corporation"" vs. ""scientist trying to save the planet"" scenario. In this case, it's an oil tycoon who illegally drills deeper than he's supposed to in a national reserve, and he accidently hits a large magma chamber. That sets off a chain reaction in the Ring of Fire, which will ultimately destroy the world if not stopped. The resident geologist, along with an environmental activist and a whistleblower, step in to save the day with a hokey, 'just-go-with-it' plan.

The special effects were good in some areas, lame in others. The digital effects of the volcano and ash clouds were really well done, but the pyrotechnics involved with the lava bombs and ""shaky-cam"" earthquake sequences were really lame. I'm pretty sure they were running through plastic trees at one point, lol. Overall, I'd give the special features a solid 3 stars, on par with other tv disaster movies.

The acting is also good in some characters, weak in others. Ring of Fire is worth seeing for Terry O'Quinn, especially if you're a fan of Lost, and Michael Vartan, if you're a fan of Alias. You'll probably recognize a few other faces as well: Ian Tracey (multiple tv shows, including Da Vinci's Inquest, Continuum, & Bates Motel), Agam Darshi (Sanctuary), and Brian Markinson (multiple tv & movie roles, Mad Men & Continuum). Personally, I wasn't wowed by Lauren Lee Smith - either her acting OR her character, but I've seen worse. Overall, I think there was a lot of talent on set, but they could only do so much with weak subplots and boring dialogue.

Speaking of which - you'll feel all three hours of this movie. It's slow to get going, mainly because they have so many character subplots to explain (the geologists' aneurism, the grieving parents who lost a child, the environmental activist who lost custody of her son...AND her estrangement from her father, etc.). Once the volcano pops, the pace picks up and it gets more interesting. However, the last 45 minutes were torturously slow, mainly because they had to wrap up all those subplots they introduced in the beginning AND save the world at the same time. I think this is one film that would have greatly benefited if a few of those minor storylines had been edited out.

Overall, I'd put this one at a solid 3-stars. If the camera work had been decent, I would have give it 4-stars. If I find it in the $5 bin at Walmart I'll probably buy it just to add to my collection, but otherwise it's worth seeing on Netflix and then forgetting.",1435536000,,3660,4.6827371695178845

The scientist that knows all the answers, the evil corporate type who is only thinking about making money and the daughter of the evil corporate type who is the against him and trying to save the Earth.  There are a few more sub-plots in this movie who are trying to make it until the final credits roll.

5657359,1,B00BNAE4DU,"I would have given this movie 3 points, maybe even 4, despite the doubtful non-science behind and the misleading title. The first part was entertaining and had promise. The second part was not watchable at all. I fast-forwarded in good hope that they'd find the tripod that they lost at the end of the first part, but to no avail. Calling this nonsense (the more correct term starts with a b) of the constantly shaking camera reality format just stinks. I couldn't watch it, and I'm convinced that I'm not the only one who gets a headache from this (you pick the term).
Save the money, rent it if need be, and call yourself lucky if you can watch it without getting a serious headache.",1393113600,,685,4.488
5657360,1,B00BNAE4DU,"Seldom have I seen a movie whose science is this weak, whose premise is this far fetched, in which the story is so unfathomably unbelievable as to be almost unwatchable. The idea that a single volcano, long been thought to be extinct, having it's magma chamber drilled into, could trigger the entire Ring Of Fire to destabilize and cause a global extinction level event is ... well, it's on a par with the flat earth theory and an earth centered cosmos. Forget for a moment that one volcano erupting would in fact ease pressure in any connected system, not increase it, and just wonder at how the entire Ring Of Fire could be made to unstable globally, yet the very local 'fissure' they use to 'relieve' that pressure didn't already blow under the same forces ... and yet, miraculously, a simple sonic 'bomb' was able to do it. I'm mostly shocked that any studio spent money on this without having a science geek at least tweak the baseline premise so as to make it possible for the watcher to suspend disbelief. No, sadly, the story premise is so poor that the rest of the plot is entirely unsustainable and the actors, while putting in a valiant effort, are unable to carry any sense of plausible drama or sincerity throughout. This is two hours of your life you can't get back - so spend them watching something else, or better yet, go hiking with your kids, because there's more excitement and danger in them there trees than there is in this movie.",1392508800,,1453,4.57088122605364
5657361,1,B00BNAE4DU,"There's no point in even addressing the dubious science involved in this disastrous doomsday flick because it immediately gets lost in a vain attempt to maintain some semblance of suspense/action throughout.  There are just too many characters, too many subplots, to address in three hours of mind numbing nonsense.  Michael Vartan looks stricken from start to finish, Terry O'Quinn just looks bored, while Lauren Lee Smith is all over the place trying to get a handle on what her character is all about (an angry daughter, extreme protester of everything, deadbeat mom, publicity seeking glory hound, witless wonder.............).  It literally takes forever before anything of interest actually happens.  Everyone has ulterior motives, everyone acts sneaky and suspicious, and just when you think it couldn't get any more complicated, out of nowhere an ex-con brother to one of the minor characters shows up.  Sure, why not, they had three hours to kill (and a lot of insignificant people to dispatch).  In a word, this movie is ponderous.  It slowly grinds to the inevitable expected outcome and perhaps the dopiest final shots ever slapped on film.  You know you're in trouble when you hear an actor spout horrific dialog like this: ""Our environment is bullied every single day.""",1392422400,3,1283,5.194174757281553

5657367,1,B00BNAE4DU,"I tried to suffer my way though this thing TWO TIMES before I just gave up and put it in my Half Price sell back box; I just hope they will give me a few pennies back for it.

Whenever environmentalist nut jobs try to make a ""disaster movie"" they just can't help putting more goofy liberal environmental politics and selfish fat cat oil tycoons into it.  Since liberal environmentalist think most of us are stupid they try too hard to get their liberal point across that ""people are killing the planet"".  They overdue the junk science not thinking about how much the plot of the movie will positively bore everyone who might have bought this movie because disaster movies interest them.

I have a Science degree in Environmental Pollution Control Technology so these liberal talking points were not even comical to me.  This movie was a terrible investment and I am so glad I didn't spend more than $5 in the used buy back table at blockbuster.",1380067200,2,944,4.595238095238095

8571458,1,B00BNAE4DU,"This is a pretty predictable story where the crusaders of goodness-and-all-that's-right in the environment world triumph over the big bad meanies.  There are some pretty far fetched hero-geologist sequences that are just plain ludicrous.  But he's gonna win because he has that hot crusader babe as a love interest now.

 Try these two puzzlers.  The geologist gets lowered into a superheated magma flow to try to set off a sonic bomb that will blast a deep duct chamber through to the ocean to vent not only the surrounding area, but it all over the Pacific rim it seems  In order to blast it, GeoDude has to be lowered in a titanium sphere built for space reentry and thus strong enough for magma, right?  Molten lava that would melt ordinary metal.....so they lower this sphere down deep into a blast hole and......How come the cable off the regular crane didn't melt?

The other puzzler is a matter of flow and vent speed.  This happens somewhere in the US reachable underground through some distance to the ocean (don't recall how far they are but let's assume California).  They blow the sonic bomb and not one minute later, the whole pacific rim is saved - all the fire lights go out on the computer and everybody is saved!  It just can't happen that way.
