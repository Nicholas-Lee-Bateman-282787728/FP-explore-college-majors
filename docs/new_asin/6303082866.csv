556619,2,6303082866,Meh. Very euro-centric humor. If you love flying and are enamored with pre World War 1 aviation and Benny Hill you may find this entertaining. I watched it once and gave the DVD away.,1517616000,,183,4.411764705882353

556669,5,6303082866,"I had seen the movie when it it hit the silver screen, over half a century ago.  My grand-children simply had to see this remarkable bit of slapstick and aviation, all rolled together.  Even the 4-year-old stayed glued to the movie - he likes plane crashes.",1504915200,,257,4.565217391304348
556670,5,6303082866,"Great movie, the kids loved it! It is long though but an intermission is provided in the original release in order to restock on popcorn and drinks or use to the bathroom after holding the previous mega sized fizzy drink ;-)",1504569600,,224,4.487804878048781
556671,5,6303082866,"This movie has survived me over the years since I first saw it as a young college girl after a night working the graveyard desk at UPI Manila. Actually, it's more like, this movie and I have survived each other. And in my old age and decrepitude, ""Those Magnificent Men"" remains my all-time feel-good favorite.

I have enjoyed this film from the very first: The fabulous period costumes, the marching music that has become a staple with Air Force bands everywhere, the vintage cars, the lighthearted love-triangle, the slapstick humor, the wide-canvas sceneries, the quaint flying machines.  Much later as a young mother, I happily took my young children to it but whether they enjoyed it as much as I did, I don't know.

I happened to have married an Englishman (now deceased) from Sussex, so the humor I had missied in earlier viewings I later caught up with and added to my enjoyment.  Many, many years later I finally bought the video to show it to our young grandson, and again, I was surprised to see fine details I had missed.  For example, in the scene where Lord Rawnsley was showing London and Paris on a 1910 world map, I noticed that all the English colonies were of the same color code as England, and the United States with its one colony were of another color.

This movie must have been so expensive to make as it spared no details.  If you want to know about the flying machines used in this movie, you can read about them in Wikipedia under the film's title.  Apparently they used either the originals (borrowed from museums) or reconstructed models following their original blueprints.  Not all the machines could fly, but the ones that could were fitted with more powerful engines.  Dozens of professional pilots had volunteered to fly them for the movie and for fun.  And a crew of aircraft engineers and repairmen worked full-time on them during the shooting.

More than 2,000 extras dressed in Edwardian costumes and owners of vintage cars in the south of England came out to show off their vehicles.  It must have been a feast filming on both sides of the channel. One nice touch was when the Frenchman was flying across the water when someone on a small boat below called out, ""Bon Voyage, Monsieur!"" a subtle reminder that win or lose, he was coming home.

Having grown up in Asia, I was amazed at how the various actors gamely acted out their comical  nationality stereotypes, not caring how their countrymen back home might feel.  Once in Munich visiting the Messerschmitt Museum, I asked our German guide somewhat diffidently what he thought of the film, ""Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines.""  The answer came as so much a hearty laughter shared by other Germans around us. I've never felt more confidently affectionate with this film since then.  Political correctness was so far off the horizon in that movie no one would ever believe the concept of xenophobia would dawn upon the west 100 years later.

So freely we savor the stereotypes: the stalwart Englishman who would not kiss a lady because he was in uniform - Richard Mays (James Fox); another with bad teeth - Sir Percy Armitage-Ware (Terry-Thomas), still another who had to have a cup of tea even way up on a windmill deck - Fire chief Perkins (Benny Hill); a Scotsman on his way to Glasgow, having lost his way to Paris - MacDougal (Gordon Jackson); A Navy leutenant wearing a 9-foot muffler around his neck and his passenger, the first dog to fly.

An amorous Frenchman, Pierre Dubois (Jean Pierre Cassel) who thought all attractive women look alike; Dubios's ""second"" and ""wrong frog"" chief French mechanic - Jean (Davy Kaye);

An opera-singing Italian Count Emilio Ponticelli (Alberto Sordi) and his prolific wife Countess Sophia (Zena Marshall) with 10 little children in tow.

A heroic gung-ho American cowboy in Levis - Orvil Newton (Stuart Whitman) and his investor and assistant George Gruber (Sam Wanamaker);

The by-the-book German Colonel Manfred von Holstein (Gert Frobe) and his obedient but hapless assistant Capt. Rompelstrosse (Karl Michael Vogler);

Definitely not the least, the counter-stereotype, highly intellectual Japanese who spoke with an Etonian accent - Yamamoto (Yujiro Ishihara)...I could go on.

The danger the magnificent men risk in flying their machines was not glossed over, either; in at least three episodes: The initial spat between Richard Mays and Patricia Rawnsley over her father's strict prohibition never take her up; George Gruber's fear not of taking off but of Orvil Newton's different ways of touching down; and when a Ponticelli son told his mother that his father was up, his mother tearfully sobbed, ""Yes, but he will come down again.""

""But Mom, you've seen it only fourteen times,"" my son knowing I'd like to see it again.
I assure you it's been more than that.",1504137600,,4817,4.858190709046455
556672,4,6303082866,"The aircraft are the stars. As for the people; the movie pokes fun at the turn-of-the-century national stereotypes (militaristic Prussians, aristocratic British, cowboy Americans, sex mad Italians, etc.)",1501459200,,203,6.285714285714286

556710,5,6303082866,Another old movie that is full of laughs. You must see this movie that was based on a true event. Many British comedy actors provided the reason for many of the funny situations.

556715,5,6303082866,Great to see old flying designs in the air. The commentary describes their efforts to use old designs that really flew!

556773,5,6303082866,"One of our family's favorite movies. We watched the Great Race a lot as kids, and this movie is very similar. This is a movie about various individuals, as representative of their countries, trying out new airplane designs, at the beginning of the century, by a cross channel race. FYI, there are stereotypes of the ""typical American"", ""typical German"", ""typical Frenchman"", etc. But, they make the movie funny and personally, I did not find them insulting. There are several scenes before the race even starts that have a ""keystone cop"" type comedy feel.",1483488000,,555,4.978494623655914

556841,1,6303082866,"Amazon used to use Microsoft Silverlight for HD videos. And if you didn't have it, they'd prompt you to download it first. I paid for the HD version of the film and, without warning, after opening it which was also the unwritten legal agreement that I'd purchased a rental, then was informed that I only had the SD version. And the streamed SD version is worse than a VHS tape in quality! They said I didn't have an Amazon approved device, with vague lies about the right combination of HDMI cables and internet. And I can't demand a refund. It's a scam. I'm not sure where you can rent an honest version of this film, streamed online, because YouTube has the same thing, which is why I came over to Amazon, but at least YouTube explained it up front.",1476576000,,751,4.410071942446043

The film is based upon a true story and it is remarkable how fragile and flimsy those planes were, yet people willingly got into them to experience the miracle of flight. The director of the film had replica aircraft built and flown in it, mixed in with green screen shots. A timeless gem. Gert Frobe nearly steals the show as a German general who ends up flying the German entry in the race to Paris.",1444262400,,579,4.471698113207547

557882,5,6303082866,"This is one of my most favourite comedies. I saw it no less than five times in my life and every time I liked it even more. A wonderful, merry, intelligent and heart-warming film. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

In 1910, at a time when aircraft were still fragile and unreliable contraptions, Lord Rawnsley (Robert Morley) a British newspaper magnate, decides to sponsor an air race from London to Paris, offering a shocking 10.000 pounds as the prize. That immediately attracts numerous intrepid competitors, of which no less than fourteen will finally qualify to participate. Here they are, in order of starting numbers

Number 1: Richard Mays (James Fox); a very formal Army officer, Mays is also courting (well, sort of) Patricia (Sarah Miles), the daughter of Lord Rawnsley

Number 2: Sir Percy Ware-Armitage (Terry-Thomas, splendid as always!), a ghastly character and a vilainous cheater

Number 3: Orvil Newton (Stuart Whitman) from Arizona, a brilliant (but so colonial) pilot; the only American in the contest; he also courts Patricia, in a much more direct way than Richard Mays...

Number 4: Lieutenant Parsons (Jeremy Lloyd), a Royal Navy officer; a rather likeable fellow, who flies with his pet dog, ""The First Flying Dog in History""

Number 5: Harry Popperwell (Tony Hancock); his plane is somehow mysteriously named ""Little Fiddler""

Number 6: Captain Rumpelstoss (Karl Michael Vogler) and later Colonel Manfred von Holstein (Gert Froebe, absolutely wonderful!); those two Prussian officers from Imperial German Army were mandated by the Kaiser in person to win - at al price!

Number 7: Mr Wallace. As I couldn't even find the name of the actor who plays him you can reasonably assume, that his participation will be short...

Number 8: Charles Wade. Same thing as above...

Number 9: Mr Yamamoto (Yujiro Ishihara), an extremely impressive Japanese pilot, flying a splendid airplane. Mr Yamamoto is one of the favourites in this race.

Number 10: Count Emilio Ponticelli (Alberto Sordi, hilarious!), an Italian aristocrat who survived a record number of crashes, but who is also one helluva pilot. The count is also married to splendidly beatiful Sophia (Zena Marshall), who gave him nine children and who every day begs him to finally stop flying...

Number 11: Henri Monteux. Same thing as points 7 and 8.

Number 12: Pierre Dubois (Jean-Pierre Cassel), a brilliant (but so continental) French pilot whose two main purposes in this race seem to be to sleep with every woman he meets and especially to troll the Germans...)))

Number 13: Mr Mac Dougall (Gordon Jackson), a proud Scot flying an airplane named ""Wake up Scotland""

Number 14: Harry Walton. Same thing as points 7, 8 and 11.

For the needs of this film the director requested that authentic flying replicas of some of planes which really existed in 1910 are build - and those planes were really used! For that reason this film gives really a great feeling of authenticity.

There are many other treasures in this film, like national stereotypes, Benny Hill as fireman, air crashes, slapstick humour, romance, sexism and sexual harassment, German military, Courtney (the low-class butler of Sir Percy), ""La Marseillaise"", blunderbusses, national stereotypes, Catholicism, sabotage, promiscuity, fistfights, guineas, female underwear, one HUGE navigation error, white cliffs of Dover, diarrhea, cultural shock, practical jokes, national stereotypes, Neanderthal man, French kissing and last but not least Brigitte (Irina Demick), Marlene (Irina Demick), Ingrid (Irina Demick), Franoise (Irina Demick), Yvette (Irina Demick) and Betty (Irina Demick)...)))

I absolutely LOVE this film! It is one of the best comedies EVER. To watch ABSOLUTELY!",1412812800,,3750,5.284511784511785

558209,4,6303082866,"One does not have to be a vintage aeroplane enthusiast to appreciate this delightfully absurd movie revolving around the historic 1910 London-to-Paris air race, although I doubt the actual event was quite so entertaining. The humor sparkles with classic British wit, much physical comedy, while never veering off into the realm of slapstick.

Produced in a time long before the advent of CGI or sophisticated wardrobes, the period costumes were excellent, even the dubiously constructed planes go a fair way in recreating the atmosphere of Edwardian England. This is a movie that is not meant to be taken seriously; all the same, it does do a far better job than any 1960s production I am aware of in keeping true to the era.

Anyone who appreciates solid acting, the variety of which simply does not exist in any form in modern movies, I dare say this will be a treat to watch. For such a silly comedy, there were some nice moments, and more subtleties than I would have expected. The cast made a superb effort so that the physical scenes are cute without being stupidly so.

I have seen a similar films from the time period which I found to be unwatchable for all the overly saccharine silliness. Thar be only clever dialogue here. I am also a little surprised this is not more popular with the Neo-Victoriana crowds, since the cinematography allows for such a realistic peek into the mechanical ingenuity that marked the early twentieth century.",1398038400,,1448,4.807228915662651

558213,4,6303082866,"Hey...fact is this movie was a product of the 'feel good' and 'family friendly/funny' movies of the mid 60s.  Period.  Movies like this along with the ""Great Race"", ""Its a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" (did I get enough Mads in there), ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"", and ""The Love Bug""were designed to entertain folks...young and old....in a rather straightforward, slap stick funny way. No social commentary...or improbable comic book action heros and villians here.  That's right!  A 'pure' movie without a complex, frenetic plot and action sequences designed to overwhelm, over stimulate and over kill ..  You wont' be 'programmed' with and great 'moral to the story' social messaging or liberal political statements within this piece.  You know...the kind that started to come to the screens  in the troubled/turbulent late 60s and early 70s.  Some of those anti-establishment flicks were darn right too realistic ...""inciteful"" and depressing..anyhow.  Not very uplifting! :-)

Back to ""Magnificent...."".  A fun, colorful and pretty movie that uplifts -- if you allow it to.  And if you like aviation, airplanes and old 'flying crates'...and American spirit, determinatino and 'ingenuity' this is worthwhile viewing/cataloguing just on that.  No stupid, amped up/hyped up absurd non-realistic CGI graphics and flying sequences here!  These were REAL flying machines actually flown by some brave stunt pilots....expressingly made from scratch or modified for the movie (re-incarnations).  Don't believe me?  Just go to Rhinebeck NY and watch their live ""Flying Circus"" flying re-enactments originally created/staged by some guy named Palen.  I did....and saw several of these 'crates' still flying shows there.  Check it out on the web!

OK....so the movie is long (with real ""Intermission"" interlude) and unfolds slowly...with some predicable funny scenes, hackneyed characters and nefarious plots.  Lots of great actors here though....funny ones too.  And the scenes ... well....they were actually well scripted and filmed....and required actors to 'ACT' and memorize their lines.  No 2-second 'scene' clipets here....or blue screen synthetic acting with TIGHT/TIGHT face shots and two or three word long ""lines"".  Real 'ol fashioned' thoughtful and entertaining acting here.  Yes, Dorothy, they really don't make movies like this anymore....and probably NEVER will again.  So enjoy this classic family entertainment movie...and collect the others of this vintage and 'innocent' Hollywood period.  It's sort of timeless...and makes you wistfully think of simpler times, motivations, agendas, romance and flying machines.

Enjoy it!  It's a real time-piece and is fun to watch.

558894,5,6303082866,"Reviewers have an understandable tendency to compare ""Those Magnificent Young Men"" with ""Those Daring Young Men"" and ""The Great Race."" A surprising number, in my opinion, consider ""The Great Race"" the best of the three and ""Those Magnificent Men"" as still funny, but the weakest of the three. I would like to argue for the exact reverse ranking of the three. ""The Great Race"" is watchable, and funny, if cartoonish slapstick is your preferred form of comedy. Every character in the film, but most especially the three leads--Jack Lemmon as the villain, Natalie Wood as the ""liberated"" female reporter, and Tony Curtis as the Dudley-do-Rightish hero, is a caricature as opposed to a fleshed-out character. The fight scene in the saloon could have come out of a Three Stooges film, and the film as a whole operates just a cut above that level of humor.

""Those Daring Young Men"" also leans heavily on the slapstick. But the slapstick is served up with a lighter touch than in ""The Great Race"" and the budding romance between Schofield (Tony Curtis) and Armitage's cousin (Susan Hampshire) is deftly handled and a delight to watch unfold. Both of the ""young men"" films play liberally with national stereotypes, but the characters representing Italy, Germany, France, etc. are not two-dimensional cartoon cut-outs--as the characters of ""The Great Race"" are. They are easily recognizable as stereotypes, and yet they retain individual personality as well--although more so in the ""flying machines"" film. Two things, in my estimation, make that the better film than ""Jaunty Jalopies."" First, there's the fascinating nature of the planes themselves. These really do become independent characters within the film, in a way that the jalopies never do in the sequel--perhaps because antique cars are so much more commonplace for us, even today, than are antique ""flying machines"". (To call them ""planes"" almost misidentifies them, given how little they have in common with what we now mean by ""planes"".) And second, there's the even more interesting romantic triangle between the Stuart Whitman, Sarah Miles and James Fox characters. If farce is your cup of tea, you'll prefer ""Jaunty Jalopies"" to ""Flying Machines"". But if you prefer your comedy to be grounded in believably human behavior, you'll give first prize to the air race.",1349481600,,2322,5.142857142857143
558895,5,6303082866,"""Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines"" is one of those movies that you couldn't care less what critics have to say. As a measure of its success it was spawned by ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" and followed by ""The Great Race"" and ""Those Daring Young Men in Their Jaunty Jalopies."" I'm just enough of an old geezer that I attended the openings of all these movies back in the day. If critics ever take into account audience reaction to assist them in determining a film's success it should have been clear to them in the early stages that ""Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines"" was a hit just by listening to the seemingly continuous laughter.

559102,5,6303082866,"CHARACTERS.  This movie discloses events leading up to, and including, a competition where about a dozen aviators in the year 1910 fly from England to Paris.  The main characters include a wealthy British newspaper publisher (he sponsors the event), his lovely daughter, the fiance of the lovely daughter (a handsome British aviator), an American cowboy aviator from Arizona, and Terry-Thomas (plays the bad guy).

SOURCES OF MILD CONFLICT.  Amusing tension arises from some mild attempts by the American cowboy to win the heart of the lovely daughter.  The fiance and the American trade punches briefly, but what we see barely qualifies as a fist-fight.  Amusing tension arises from Terry-Thomas' behavior in sabataging several of the airplanes of the competing aviators.  Amusing tension also takes the form of the lovely daughter disobeying her father, by riding motorcycles, and by going up in an airplane with the American cowboy.  The most dramatic episode occurs when the girl joins the American cowboy in his airplane, but is forced to take the stick, because the American needs to leave the cockpit to walk out on the wing in order to repair a broken strut.

SOURCES OF COMEDY.  Comedy arises from repeated stereotypical behavior of Germans, e.g., the behavior of Germans in adhering strictly to protocol and repeatedly consulting instruction booklets for even the simplest of tasks.  Comedy also arises from the trousers of various people being pulled down.  On a couple of occasions, a woman's dress gets pulled down, revealing her bloomers (we don't even see her bare legs).  On one occasion, a man's pants fall down.  In this case, a strut on the man's airplane broke while the plane was in the air, and the pilot (the cowboy) needed to walk out on the wing and fix the broken strut with his belt, but this causes the man's pants to fall down.  More comedy arises when a man is clinging to the back of an airplane when the plane aloft, and he inches his way forward, and manages to tumble into the cockpit, face down.  His head gets inserted towards the floor of the cockpit, and the man's two legs jut upwards, and wiggle about, one to the right of the pilot's head and the other leg to the left of the pilot's head.  (Ha, ha, ha, so funny I am in great pain.)  Another amusing moment occurs where a plane makes a forced landing in front of a convent.  At first, the nuns refuse to help the Italian aviator, and insist that he leave at once.  But the Italian aviator is clever, and proclaims, ""You wouldn't want a Protestant to win the race, would you?""  At this point, the head nun instantly changes her mind, and commands all the other nuns to come to the aid of the Italian aviator.

EYE CANDY.  But best of all, the viewer is treated to a continual parade of turn-of-the-century aircraft, some with improbable conformations, such as an airplane with circular, donut-shaped wings.  We see close-ups of engines.  We see dozens of crash landings  --  into a sand dune, into a sewage treatment pond, into the English Channel.

SUMMARY.  The movie is a storehouse of juvenile humor.  Every ten or 15 minutes, there is an airplane crash where nobody gets hurt.  The pilot just falls out the airplane, lands in the grass, and proclaims something like, ""whoops"" or ""upsy-daisy!""  There are no bad words in this movie.  Understanding the movie requires only the shortest of attention spans.  The quality of the image in the DVD is excellent.  The movie brings to mind the continual action and calculated chaos of, IT'S A MAD, MAD, MAD, MAD WORLD.  In FLYING MACHINES, I liked every minute.  (But in MAD WORLD, there were a couple of sequences that I thought were irritating and annoying.)  FLYING MACHINES also might be compared, to a small extent, with Spielberg's fine movie, 1941.  In both movies (FLYING MACHINES and 1941), a beautiful young woman becomes attracted to men because the result is a trip in the man's airplane.  At any rate, the intellectual level of FLYING MACHINES is somewhere between that of SPONGE BOB and TELETUBBIES.  Also, the comfort level, as it applies to the comfort of young children, of FLYING MACHINES is also somewhere between that of SPONGE BOB and TELETUBBIES.

If you are a parent of a young child, there is only a handful of other suitable movies that I can recommend.  In particular, I recommend WONDERFUL WORLD OF BROTHERS GRIMM, also with Terry-Thomas (as the bad guy), and with Buddy Hackett, Russ Tamblyn (WEST SIDE STORY), and the adorable Barbara Eden.",1270080000,,4506,4.797402597402598

Plot
An air race is planned from London to France. Fliers from all the world arrive. The race is on... and slapstick comedy, romance, incredible stunts, heroism and villainy are sure to follow.
Violent Content
Nothing serious. There is a lot comic action involving plane crashes and even a gun duel, but there is no blood and it is all handled in the typical Laurel & Hardy fashion. No one is killed although there are a few close calls involving planes in the air.

Sexual Content
This is where the film loses a lot of its kid friendliness. There is a lot of innuendo. A Frenchman played by Jean Pierre-Cassel seduces a string of woman (off-screen, but we hear many jokes about it) and insists on greeting pretty woman with a slap on the bottom. At one point, it is implied that he has a roll in hay (quite literally) with a French woman. The main character (played by Stuart Whitman) accidentally pulls a woman's skirt off (she is wearing modest period underwear) several times.
The most explicit sexual content and the closest the film comes to nudity is a scene in which a man paints a nude woman. We see the model's bare back almost down to her rear, and all of her legs. From a far out view we see her completely nude from behind. This scene is brief, and she covers herself with a towel almost immediately (not the most modest towel, but she is covered), but most parents will probably want to use the remote there.

Language
There are numerous d-words and h-words
Morales
Womanizing, drinking, and cussing are commonplace. Whitman and James Fox eventually make up their differences and become friends. Whitman risks losing the race in order to save another flier. The bad guy loses in the end. Pure love is idolized. A female character is a feminist.

Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines is a huge movie. When it arrived in theatres in 1965, it was a huge hit wiping out similar films such as The Great Race and even It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, World from two years earlier as the most success epic comedy of the time.  One of the best of it's genre, Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines is a fun movie, that most people will find quite fun.
However, I find it difficult to recommend because despite the lable ""family movie"" it throws in some objectionable content (chiefly Irina Demich naked from behind).  Now I realize that unless your kids live a bubble it's unlikely that they have not seen things ten times more damaging than this, but more than this, there is an untypically sleazy attitude towards sex in this movie that I can't really condone.

559169,4,6303082866,"The earliest days of heavier-than-air aviation were romantic indeed, with the aviators of the time being the cultural equivalent of today's astronauts.  In that context, an air race is organized from England across the English Channel for a variety of airplanes, in order to see which designs would advance the art of flying.

Invitations to the race are sent worldwide, and entrants from many countries bring their airplanes to the starting field, and al,l practice before the race is scheduled.  Of course, each entrant's hangar and vicinity reflects the entrant's country, and the cultural differences make a fine contrast.  However, what's interesting is that while the culturres are contrasted, nothing is done maliciously.

The film was shot before GCI, and many of the old planes actually were airworthy.  There are numerous views of colorful models of early airplanes in flight.

But this is a comedy, so many of the situations are humorous, but the humor is gentle, provoking chuckles rather than belly laughs.  Once the race actually starts, the difficulties that some of the contesnders face are believable, but humorous.

The very end of the film is not as effective as when the film was first released, but that shouldn't affect the film's basic story.  It's a film that can ve viewed by the whole family, but it's not the standard ""family film.""  Just a lot of fun.",1233532800,,1379,5.004385964912281

559172,3,6303082866,"Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines is the British version of The Magnificent Race but it's more like a ripoff. The film uses the real life 1910 event as the basis for the movie but there aren't any similarities beyond that. It's directed & co-written by Ken Annakin, I have yet to find a reason to recommend anything in his name.

The film has a large pool of stars but almost all of them are B-list entities. The story centers on Orvil Newton (Stuart Whitman),an American from the wild West, who enters the contest. Patricia Rawnsley (Sarah Miles) is the female lead & is the daughter of Lord Rawnsley (Robert Morley) who is the publisher of a newspaper & the one who offers 10,000 pounds to the winner of the London to Paris air race. Richard Mays (James Fox), a British competitor, sort of loves Patricia & is expected to marry her but Orvil changes this when he begins to court her, thus, we have the love triangle.

Sir Percival Ware-Armitage (Terry-Thomas) is the main antagonist, equivalent to the Lemmon role in The Great Race. Thomas is okay in the role but it isn't written nearly as well; he also has a sidekick, Courtney (Eric Sykes), that's inept but not nearly as funny as Falk in the equivalent role of The Great Race. Benny Hill has a small role as Fire Chief Perkins.  The cast includes Gert Frobe as Manfred von Holstein, the German contestant who's never flown before; Alberto Sordi as Count Emilio Ponticelli, the Italian contestan who's unhappy with every flying machine offered to him; Jean-Pierre Cassel as Pierre Dubois, the French contestant who's amorous with every female; & Yujiro Ishihara as Yamamoto, the Japanese contestant. There are other contestants that don't figure in prominently. Irina Demick plays several roles that the French aviator keeps hitting on in different locations. Red Skelton has what amounts to a cameo role but is really more, his appearances are limited to the opening & closing scenes.

The movie goes on for an intolerable 137 minutes, way too long for the lack of quality presented here. Many of the characters are merely caricatures that are not interesting. By the time you get to the end of the film you really won't care who wins.

559238,5,6303082866,"Set around a fictional 1910 London to Paris air race and the rivalries of the pioneer aviators it attracts from all around the world to risk life, limb and some dodgy back-projection in the Paris sequences, Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines, or How I Flew From London to Paris in 25 Hours and 11 Minutes began life as a project on pilots Alcock and Brown for Alexander Korda. Director Annakin had already reconstructed many of the vintage aircraft before the producer's death took the project with him.

As with The Longest Day, the story provided 20th Century Fox with a great opportunity to increase its foreign box-office prospects by populating the film with popular actors from around the world, while its episodic structure and the sheer size of the cast meant that many could film their parts in a matter of days, keeping the budget manageable. As a result, many are so brief that blink-and-you'll-miss-them (Red Skelton, Tony Hancock, Benny Hill).

If it is typical of the international co-productions that were to follow it, it is atypical in that it is also quite funny and highly entertaining. This despite studio chief Darryl F. Zanuck wanting to play down the comic aspects of the film, cutting many early scenes from the script and the rough-cut and building up the rather lukewarm romantic triangle with Stuart Whitman and James Fox fighting over Sarah Miles.

The colour in the casting is definitely on the sidelines. Gert Frobe is memorable as the pompous Prussian learning to fly ""from ze book of instructions,"" as is the briefly seen Tony Hancock as a less than successful inventor whose real-life plaster cast on his broken foot was written into the script to provide one of the film's biggest laughs. But, despite the large ensemble, the undisputed star of the show is easily Terry Thomas at his most caddish as the archetypal cheat and rotter Sir Percy Ware Armitage, making a great double act with Eric Sykes as his put-upon chauffeur that was surely the inspiration for Dastardly and Muttley.

Ron Goodwin's catchy score and Ronald Serle's cartoons catch the mood perfectly, and the planes - built to original specifications - are quite wonderful to watch while the spoilsports among you will have fun looking out for the modern cars (such as the Land Rover clearly visible about an hour into the film) and the Sixties ferries in the Dover and Calais sequences.

Although the Movietone newsreel covering the filming is not included, the NTSC Region 1 DVD has both the full and teaser trailers are alongside an on-camera interview with Ken Annakin, whose audio commentary is carried over from the laser disc release. The remainder of the extras take the form of text and production stills, sketches and even technical specifications and blueprints for the original planes and their reconstructions.

Letterboxed throughout, even in the fullframe pretitle sequence, although the print has been taken from a 35mm interpositive, it is closer to 70mm projection ratio (it was shot in Todd-AO) than 2.35. This does not affect the picture greatly, but becomes very noticeable on the end credits, which boast players such as 'm Wanamaker.' That said, aside from a slight milkiness in a few Shots, the clarity of the print is quite superb. However, one joke is lost as the sign on Jeremy Lloyd's co-pilot, 'I am the first dog to fly', is illegible. Twilight Time's excellent limited region-free Blu-ray transfer has no such problems and is the best I've seen the film look outside of its 70mm Todd AO screenings. It also includes an audio commentary by director Ken Annakin, an isolated score track for Ron Goodwin's excellent score, 2 TV spots, teaser trailer and full theatrical trailer and booklet and is well worth tracking down.",1198886400,,3761,4.943037974683544

One of the great classic, British humor films of all time.  Top comedians and character actors of their day give wonderful examples of the way the Brits perceive and imagine other nationalities behave.  All built around the early days of flying, the pompous upper class played by Robert Morley, the free-wheeling Americans and, in particular, the British scallywag played so well by Terry Thomas ably assisted by his flunkey Eric Sykes. Not to mention the Fire Chief played by Bennie Hill in a style he is the out and out master of.

If you like to laugh, this is for you.

The amorous advancements of the Frenchman toward the Brigitte, Marlene, Francoise and the other personas assumed by actress Irina Demick flew over my daughter's head, and she enjoyed the slapstick antics of the Germans and the villain, Sir Percy. She has watched it enough times to have paid for repeat rentals (and then some).

The film is quite long by today's standards, but the catchy theme song and action sequences keep the young ones requesting it week after week. It helps if the parents have seen it years ago as children, but even first-time viewers will enjoy the plot line and dated stereotyping of the American, British, French, Japanese, German, and Italian pilots.

559365,5,6303082866,"As cartoon lovers have likely noticed, Hanna-Barbera has recently released (Dick) Dastardly and Muttley and Their Flying Machines and The Perils of Penelope Pitstop on DVD. Now imagine these cartoons came out first, and someone later decided to make bad spin-off live action movies of them. Delightfully, however, it's the other way 'round. These movies came first, and they're not bad at all. In fact, they're exceptionally good, this one being the best. Of course these films may not have inspired the H-B cartooons, which have plenty of other inspirations in the melodramas they play from.

I don't think viewers watch this film, or the related films The Great Race, Those Daring Young Men in Their Jaunty Jalopies, for the plot but for the look, the style, the cartooniness without being cartoons, which predicts Monte Python but displays the best of the sense of style at the height of '60s movie making. Gerald Searle's opening titles and the opening theme music (which even now I remember) perfectly echo these sensibilities. As another example consider the cartoon intro to Blake Edwards' Pink Panther, so affecting that it spun off its own cartoon series by DePatie-Freleng. There is also a quite decent companion film about a moon launch (the title of which escapes me).

559368,4,6303082866,"Two films were made in 1965 that both catered to the current interest in turn-of-the-century history and wacky humor: The Great Race and Those Magnificent Men. The latter also catered to the fascination with anything British, and, in this case, includes some of the top British comedians of the day: Terry Thomas, Robert Morley and Benny Hill, to name a few. Director Ken Annakin has taken his love for aviation history and infused it with a host of wonderfully funny characters engaged in a partially historical race: a flight from London to Paris in 1910. At a time when people were literally obsessed with flying, there were some incredibly weird machines being put into flight, and many of them appear in this film. All the planes used were authentic reproductions of actual planes, built on spec with the original materials, but souped up a bit with more powerful engines.

Even though there is a strong English flavor to everything in this film, it is truly an international race, with French, Italian, Japanese, German and American pilots participating. Stewart Whitman plays the American cowboy pilot flying a plane modeled after the Wright Brothers' machine. Sarah Miles is beautiful as Stuart's love interest, and is also pursued by suave British pilot James Fox. Robert Morley plays her father, and the sponsor of the race. Terry Thomas is the dastardly villain who is not above sabotaging his fellow competitors' planes, and Benny Hill plays an early version of an airfield controller. Other notables are Alberto Sordi as the rich Italian pilot, whose enthusiasm for flying is only matched by his enthusiasm for child-bearing; Gert Frobe as the German pilot, who does everything by the book, and to marching music, which he produces without the help of instruments; Jean-Pierre Cassel as the Frenchman, who is infatuated by Irena Demick, no matter how many different women she appears as; Eric Sykes as Terry Thomas' man Courtney; Yujiro Ishihara as the Japanese pilot; and Red Skelton as a variety of comic flyers from pre-modern times.

It's amazing how many parallels there are between Ken Annakin's Those Incredible Men and Blake Edwards' The Great Race. One might almost think they were looking over each other's shoulders and stealing from each other. But there is quite a different flavor to each. Those Magnificent Men is strongly British and very realistic, whereas The Great Race is very American and a spoof on early film comedies, like the Keystone Cops, as well as more serious white-hat melodramas. As wonderful as both films are - especially for art, costume and other technical departments - it's hard to believe that the only Oscar they won was for sound effects, which went to The Great Race. But, when you consider that they were competing against The Sound of Music and Dr. Zhivago, maybe it's not so hard to believe. In their own right, though, they're both still wonderful.

559372,4,6303082866,"Would you like to take a ride in my ornithopter?  No?  How about a quick jaunt in my aerial steam carriage?  Maybe a lift in my oscillating monoplane?  It's hard for many of us to imagine when airplanes were not the efficient, quick, safe, and somewhat affordable mode of transportation that they are today, but there was a time when the technology was still in the experimental stage, back in the early 20th century, and that's when the film Those Magnificent Men and Their Flying Machines, or How I Flew from London to Paris in 25 Hours and 11 Minutes (1965)...whew!  That's one heck of a title...

Directed by Ken Annakin, a British director who gained acclaim working on such Disney films like The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men (1952), The Sword and the Rose (1953), and Swiss Family Robinson (1960), Those Magnificent Men (shortened for sanity's sake) stars Stuart Whitman (Call Him Mr. Shatter) and Sarah Miles (The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing).  Also appearing are Robert Morley (The African Queen), Gert Frbe (Goldfinger), Eric Sykes, Benny Hill, Yjir Ishihara (Japan's most popular film, TV, and recording star at the time), along with England's most recognizable gap-toothed character actor Terry-Thomas (his most famous roles involve him playing an upper-class British twit, as he does here).

The story is pretty straightforward here...basically, a rich (in both money and snobbery) English newspaper owner named Lord Rawnsley (played by Morley) happens upon an idea, one which would increase his paper's circulation greatly, of having an aeronautical race from London to Paris, with the winner to receive not only a large sum of dough, but the prestige of being the first man to accomplish such a daring feat.  Applicants from all over the world begin appearing, most for the money, but some for the honor of their respective country.  Orvil Newton (Whitman), arrives from America, Colonel Manfred von Holstein (Frbe) from Germany, and so on and so on...and lest we forget native Englander Sir Percy Ware-Armitage (Thomas), along with his less than able henchman Courtney (Sykes), a pair of bounders (Sir Percy being the bigger bounder of the two) who will stoop to almost any form of chicanery in order to win the race.

As far as grand, epic comedies go (the film runs roughly 138 minutes, but there is a lengthy intermission about halfway through, for those of you with the weak bladders), this isn't the best in my opinion, but it's certainly not the worst.  My favorite has always been It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World (1963), with others being Around the World in 80 Days (1956), The Great Race (1965), Those Daring Young Men in Their Jaunty Jalopies, aka Monte Carlo or Bust (1969).  As with any of these films, Those Magnificent Men... has a few separate storylines going on at the same time that tie themselves up by the end, the main one usually being a romantic plot, here being a tepid love triangle between Patricia Rawnsley (played by Miles), whose father is sponsoring the race, Orvil, and a local man named Richard Mays (played by James Fox, who, by the way was involved with Sarah Miles in real life, around the time of the making of this film).  I had read somewhere that the makers of this film had originally hoped to get Dick Van Dyke for Whitman's role, but couldn't for whatever reason.  Casting Whitman as the male lead was a serious boo boo, as Whitman is one of the most unfunny, uncharming, and unwatchable actors I've seen in a long time.  Come to think of it, the entire movie isn't really all that funny, but it does give effort and it has a lot of charm.  The working replicas of the old-timey planes are really wonderful, along with the various authentic vehicles displayed, i.e. motorcars, motorcycles, etc.  The aeronautical shots were excellent as was the scenery, the Cliffs of Dover, the Eiffel Tower, etc.  I was kind of disappointed Terry-Thomas didn't have a bigger part in the film, as his on screen time probably ran about 15 minutes total at most.  He plays the pretentious, foppish English twit better than most any other actor I'm familiar with...Come to think of it, I thought there was an awful lot of comic talent appearing in this film, with so little of it actually used  (I'm still stuck on the whole `casting of Whitman as the comedic male lead' thing).  The rest of the fliers, from various countries (which country made extremely obvious by not only their clothing but manner of speech), fills out a good deal of time.  The stereotypes presented (an uptight German lacking a sense of humor, an animated Italian who has like 15 children, an overly amorous Frenchman) are goofy caricatures of themselves, and, while probably not entirely funny, they probably wouldn't offend except for the most sensitive.  The special effects in the film are pretty obvious, but the scenes to watch are the ones with planes actually flying.  All in all, this is just good fun, and a really good-looking film that can be enjoyed by all.

The wide screen picture on this DVD looks really good, and the sound quality is superior.  Special features include a full commentary by the director Ken Annakin (use the Force, ken, use the Force...a lame attempt at humor, to be sure), a theatrical Trailer, a TV spot, various still galleries featuring the actors, the planes, the visual effects, and storyboards.  There is also a feature containing conversations with the director.  I was surprised to see the amount of special features available here, and beware ye who enter the still galleries, the number of photos seems endless...

What makes this 1965 Action Comedy so Grand is the attention to detail by Director Ken Annakin who had 6 replica flying machines built by real aero - engineers from the original blue prints and specifications.  The accuracy of these replicants even proved the critical pilot weight limitations.

559424,4,6303082866,"Other than being a great movie about early aircraft -- which have a tremendous charm of their own -- and being a very funny movie, this movie really is about national stereotypes.  There is the American who's a cowboy, the German who's regimented and military (and Goldfinger, no less), the Italian who sings as he flies, the French who aren't particularly fastidious about details....and on and on.  The word stereotype has become stereotyped, itself, as some sort of evil thing at this point in our history.  However, in 1965 when this was a ""road show"" (you needed reserved seats purchased ahead of time to see it) and shown in deluxe Cinerama venues it was a very unique enterprise.  The comedy was IN the pitting of these stereotypes against each other in nationalistic but good-natured fun.  As far as that issue (stereotyping) is concerned, this movie shows us that the pendulum has swung way too far in the ""other"" direction and we all take ourselves way too seriously.  I think that's what the movie is about (today) and the scenery, the vistas, and the ancient aircraft are the props around which this comedy of nationalities plays itself out.
A unique sort of fun -- not unlike ""It's a Mad Mad World..."" or ""The Great Race"" all of which were created around the same time.  I will be pleased to view it in DVD splendor in widescreen format and surround.  It's an old friend that I haven't visited for a long time.

559426,5,6303082866,"""Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines"" delivers non-stop entertainment from beginning to end.  The accomplishment of delivering entertainment bang for bucks resulted in impressive turnstile activity for this highly unique international aviation spoof when it debuted in 1965.  It became one of the year's top grossers.
International director Ken Annakin spun an ingenious script with Jack Davies, resulting in an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay.  The film generates entertainment on several levels, 1) as an aviation spectacle, 2) as a hilarious spoof, 3) as an entertaining love story with a two men and a woman triangle as the men compete in a race, 4) as a clever drama in which another competitor seeks victory through cheating.
Several years prior to this film Annakin won his spurs as a master of international spectacle with his masterful direction of the toughest battle sequences of Darryl F. Zanuck's ""The Longest Day"" about the D-Day invasion of 1944.  This time the story centers around a bold stroke by newspaper publisher Robert Morley to win favor through offering 10 thousand pounds to the winner of a London to France airplane race over the English Channel.  The fact that this occurs in 1910, the early days of aviation, gives the film an interesting twist.  The movie is well worth viewing for the inventive aviation sequences alone, culminating with spectacular shots of the British and French countrysides.
Stuart Whitman and James Fox have more incentive than winning the lucrative first prize money.  They vie for the affections of Sylvia Miles, engaging in numerous strategy gambits along the way.
A director whose filmmaking activities took him to countless nations and every continent, Annakin had the right credentials to present a clever spoof in which the national identity characteristics of the competitors representing the many countries involved are satirized in a manner that is constantly humorous and never mean-spirited.  The German team is shown demonstrating maximum scientific precision while France's aggregation displays interest in dalliances with beautiful women along with fine wine and cuisine.
Terry-Thomas is in sidesplitting top form as a cheating competitor determined to win at all costs.  In that this is a comedic spoof rather than serious drama, his antics are more akin to those of a naughty but still delightful boy rather than a sinister heavy.  Again, the premium is on having a good time, carrying humor to its zenith.
Comedy master Red Skelton entertains in a cameo appearance, while Annakin and Davies create an interesting situation for Irina Demick as the versatile actress tackles no less than seven roles.  As such she becomes a female equivalent to British male stars Alec Guinness and Peter Sellers in the domain of multiple role challenges.  Another comedy great is also showcased prior to his long television reign, the incomparable Benny Hill.
The Annakin-Davies team succeeds in one of the most challenging domains, creating a spoof in which many comedic and scenic balls are tossed in the air.  To their credit, not one of the balls is dropped as the story twists provide consistent interest and the comedy remains perpetually enriching.",1077926400,,3241,5.257751937984496

Because of the full screen edition, you only get a partial view of the great flying panoramas. What were they thinking not producing it in Widescreen version? Never-the-less, it's better than nothing. Buy it, you won't regret it.",1075766400,,357,5.172413793103448

559469,5,6303082866,"""Those Magnificent Men In Their Flying Machines"" is another one of those long near-epic length films of the 1960's. (Don't you just love it?) All of the world's greatest aviators including Stuart Whitman, Gert Frobe, and Terry-Thomas are to meet in London and prepare themselves for a London to Paris air race. The result: hilarity and wackiness all leading in to one giant misadventure that will have you in stitches. By the way, when the German aviator is marching with his soldiers he imitates a brass oompah band! Hysterical sounding! Check this one out. Satisfaction guaranteed!",1057968000,,583,5.083333333333333

559473,5,6303082866,"I don't watch a lot of comedy, but this movie holds a hallowed place in my collection.  Part satire, part laugh-out-loud humor, part romance (there's a definite triangle between Orvil Newton (Whitman), Patricia Rawnsley (Miles), and Richard Mays (Fox)), and part headlong thrills-and-chills excitement, its two-plus hours fly by, not just because of the vintage airplanes, which in themselves are worth the price of the video--I can't imagine where they found them!  And the cast, as has been mentioned, brims with experienced character actors whose like doesn't seem to exist any more, even though to some the characters may seem almost stereotypes--easygoing cowboy-turned-aeronaut Newton and his skeptical, down-to-earth partner George Gruber (Sam Wanamaker), stuffy-proper British Army officer Mays, tomboy Patricia, chauvinistic newspaper magnate Lord Rawnsley (Robert Morley), double-dealing Sir Percy Ware-Armitage (Terry-Thomas), amorous Frenchman Pierre Dubois (Jean-Pierre Cassel) to whom all females (Irina Demick) look alike, patriotically-proud German Colonel Count Manfred von Holstein (Gert Frobe) and the hapless young aide Capt. Rumpelstrosse (Karl Michael Vogler) whom he dragoons into piloting the Fatherland's entry into the race, and the opera-warbling amateur enthusiast Count Emilio Ponticelli (Alberto Sordi) with his apprehensive wife (Zena Marshall) and huge flock of children (are there six? eight? eleven? they don't stand still long enough to be counted!).  (British comic Benny Hill is a delight in his small but vital part as Fire Chief Perkins.)  It isn't rated, but it doesn't need to be.

No other movie gives you that feeling ""of being there in the early days"" when flying was still dangerous and exotic - hell most people saw it but could not blieve it was possilbe. This movie leads you down that very adventure and does so wit a lot of humor. Escpecially Gerd Foebe's statement""There is nothing a German Officer cant do"" despite the fact he has never flown an airlpane and attemts to do so with written instructions gives this movie the insight wittyness that is hard to find.

Made the way movies should be made (what else should you anticipate from Ken Annikan?) - no overt sex, no foul language, no bloody gore - I know that won't please the liberal-minded proponents of sex and language, but it will, therefore, be a movie which you can show to your kids - a wonderful family movie.  This is really a great movie, from Stewart Whitman to the slippery character played by Terry-Thomas, from Count Ponticelli to Sarah Miles, from London to Paris.

It seems to be one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, yet it was a very good old fashioned, innocent, and more professional humor than most other comedies. I think it is a work of art and should be added to DVD format. Being that much of my family is German, Gert Frbe was my favorite character. A funny and warm resemblance of the Prussian gentleman of the time. All the national characters were funny too. Terry Thomas was wonderful and gave me plenty of laughs. The Frenchmen and the Italian (Emilio) were great too. You will just feel naturally happier after you watch this movie. Don't even hesitate to buy it!",1002067200,,693,4.507936507936508
559708,4,6303082866,"My wife and I just finished watching ""Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines"" with five teenaged boys. I was afraid that the attention of these boys would wane at some point during this 2-plus hour comedy/adventure, but they enjoyed it from beginning to end.
At one point they were fascinated with all the antique airplanes, both in the prologue with Red Skelton, and the wonderfully rebuilt classic planes used in the race from London to Paris. Then they were splitting a gut over the Keystone Kops style slapstick humor, and they chuckled at the nationalistic stereotypes. These teens are also really into music, and I heard them humming along with various familiar tunes used in the soundtrack.
So, while this comedy is a throwback to a more innocent era, it still held the attention of a roomful of teens, as well as my wife and I. I must admit that I'd never seen this hilarious film in its entirety before, and now I wonder why. I'm sure we'll watch it again sometime in the future.",998092800,,996,4.6647727272727275

To call it priceless would be to do it an injustice. The wickedly funny devious and  completely bungled antics of Terry Thomas alone provide motivation to watch  this movie. The introduction video of the attempts made by men to fly along  with Red Skelton playing the cave man obsesses with flying are simply  hilarious. Primarily very 'pukka' as the English would say, there is enough  humour in this movie for anybody in the family to enjoy. A must for comedy  fans.",957139200,,597,4.5327102803738315
