8647107,5,B00J0DY6GC,"The four episodes on Volumes 4 and 5 are all from the same week, Tuesday through Friday in order.

From Volume 4:

Show #1 features harmonica virtuoso Larry Adler performing with the band (for those who have complained about the band music issue), as well as an early appearance by ""Bill"" (later Billy) Crystal among other guests (Charlton Heston, Michael Landon and Lisa Farringer).

Show #2 includes Orson Welles (always a great guest), Susan Clark, frequent visitor Sam Blotner, and a truly funny appearance by John Byner. I've always loved impressionists, very popular back in the 70s in particular.  Byner does a number of personalities (including Bing Crosby and James Stewart) as they would sound as emergency room doctors.

I'll review Vol. 5 on its proper page.  I do highly recommend getting both.",1399161600,2,807,5.030075187969925
