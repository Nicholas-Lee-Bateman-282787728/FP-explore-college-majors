8397363,5,B003IGZJ40,"I bought this DVD while I was in Hawaii, and it is a charming collection of interviews with people who love the plants and little creatures of Hawaii. I loved the school children singing about the happy face spider, and I laughed at the old woman singing to her taro plants to make them happy. (I think that will be me in a few years!) Hawaii has some amazing plants, and I want to buy some of Dr. Beatrice Krauss' ethnobotany books after seeing her in this documentary. This DVD is a treasure for naturalists and people who love Hawaii.",1507334400,,537,4.38
8397364,5,B003IGZJ40,"I just watched this documentary a week ago on a flight to Hawaii (where I live) ~ Wow! what a joy~ The film makers have captured the deeper essence of the islands, the wisdom of the Hawaiian elders~ the wisdom keepers who live in deep relationship to nature, to the elements & who still know how to enter the forest in sacred reverence to gather medicinal plants, flowers for hula~ or to listen to the birds that live there...  There is a sanctity to living this way that brings great beauty & reverence to living here in the islands~ It is a treasure that the film makers have recorded the precious souls who are featured in this documentary~ may we learn to remember what they are teaching & through their wisdom, find our own place on this earth~ walking with respect, honoring and awareness to the subtle majesty in all life~ Thank you to the film makers... this film is a gift for all choose to receive it~

(& yes~ the critic who gave the film 1 star is correct... it is not purely a film about the 'sounds' of the forest~ as they had hoped. That is true~ Rather it shares the deeper 'voice' of silence & nature & the essence & mystery of that... Enjoy!) :)",1371513600,,1163,4.330275229357798
8397365,5,B003IGZJ40,"If you love Hawai`i then this is an absolute must buy.!
Presented by Eddie Kamae. It is not just a very interesting environmental documentary on
the preservation of the Hawai`ian rain forest. But about the unique native birds and adorable
creatures that live there.
Saving this rain forest is crucial.
There are also ancient chants and hula performances by the ""Halau O Kekui"" in the fern forest.
It runs for 52 minutes. Has a good quality picture and sound.
A Superb DVD. One of the best I have ever seen filmed in the Hawai`ian Islands.
Highly recommended.",1301097600,4,558,4.762886597938144
