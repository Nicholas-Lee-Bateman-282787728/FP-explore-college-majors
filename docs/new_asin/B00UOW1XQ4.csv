7066229,5,B00UOW1XQ4,"I was on the fence about this show when I first started watching it, but the more the show I saw the more of it I liked.  It really a cute family show.",1448496000,,151,3.5757575757575757
7066230,5,B00UOW1XQ4,"I enjoyed this interpretation of Jane Austen's characters. It was fun to see her characters from different novels in the same show. It was really interesting how they envisioned these characters in the modern times. Elinor is an accountant, Emma is a divorce lawyer, Lizzie is a realtor, and Marianne is not sure what to do with her life.",1445472000,9,338,4.745762711864407
7066231,3,B00UOW1XQ4,"A modern take on Jane Austen's characters, made into a series of 10 lightweight, Dove apporved episodes.

This is, indeed, a very loosely based on Jane Austen story that intertwines some of her most favorite characters, more like their names with bits of their traits:: Emma. realtor Elizabeth Bennet, lawyer Darcy, Mr. Knightly, sisters Elinor and Marianne, Collins, and a few others. Fit for a 30 minute time slot. the humor, stories, romance are simple, non-offensive and, at times, slow.  It's a low budget affair, but the shots, editing, and acting are fine if uninspired; however, there are cute parts, and it's family friendly(I'd rate it G), but the kids aren't going to sit for this.

Filmed in Utah, if you like Sun World Pictures' movies, e.g. Civil Love, Scents and Sensibility and many others, you'll probably like this, and, definitely, recognize their actors.",1443744000,6,874,5.055555555555555
7066232,5,B00UOW1XQ4,I enjoyed this new TV show and am disappointed others do not. Shona is wonderful as Emma as are all the characters. I would love to see it continue.,1440547200,4,148,4.137931034482759
7066233,5,B00UOW1XQ4,I love this series. It's super cute and really fun to watch. I hope they make another series,1522713600,,92,4.166666666666667
7066234,5,B00UOW1XQ4,Finished watching season 1in less than a week! C'mon season 2!,1522540800,,62,4.7272727272727275
7066235,5,B00UOW1XQ4,"Absolutely LOVE this show. It's light, CLEAN!, an easy watch and perfectly fine to have on if children are around. They're short and sweet.  So if I miss something I can just replay it and not lose an hour of my time catching up. The characters are cute to watch and I would love to see how the characters develop more!!!! Hint hint! Next season please!!! :)",1521849600,,358,4.343283582089552
7066236,4,B00UOW1XQ4,"I'm a Jane Austen Addict. Austentatious was humorous and modern yet, I wished in today's age, the characters would have reflected the diversity in society and the diversity in Jane Austen's fans. Her fan base is international and multicultural.",1521244800,,244,5.282051282051282
7066237,5,B00UOW1XQ4,So cute and funny and clean! I can't believe the season didn't even wrap up though! Bring it back!,1520380800,,98,4.2105263157894735

7066239,4,B00UOW1XQ4,"I'll be honest, the acting is sub par, but I enjoyed the story line and really hope that they can get the funding for season 2.  It's so hard to find shows I can watch with my kids without feeling the need to filter stuff out.",1518998400,,226,3.9130434782608696
7066240,3,B00UOW1XQ4,"It's a cute adaptation, and reasonably well done for what seems like a small budget. It doesn't really seem like the characters really have much in common with their literary counterparts, however (which is supposed to be the whole point, right?). And while it is cute, the pace is so slow, with no real plot. They all just wander into each other's offices all day with random life/job problems. I got through episode 7 but since there isn't a second season, and nothing seems to be happening, I think I'll just go rewatch the Lizzie Bennet Diaries and Emma Approved.",1518912000,,567,4.68
7066241,4,B00UOW1XQ4,"Great to watch with my tween daughter.  It got so  much better as the season went on, looked a little more professional after 2nd episode.  We need a season 2!!",1517011200,,160,4.266666666666667
7066242,5,B00UOW1XQ4,Was very family  oriented  and the actors were awesome. Cant wait to see more  episodes in the near future.,1515110400,,107,4.526315789473684
7066243,5,B00UOW1XQ4,"Absolutely loved this! I super hope that they make a second season, but even if they don't, this is ridiculously cute and enjoyable to anyone who likes Austen adaptions.",1511827200,,169,4.862068965517241

7066245,5,B00UOW1XQ4,"Very cute! Great adaptation of Austen's characters - kept their individual personalities but brought it to modern day, and interacting with each other, well thought through! I think Austen fans will love this just as much as I did! Hope there is a season 2 and more!!",1505088000,,267,4.702127659574468
7066246,5,B00UOW1XQ4,"Cute, sweet, innovative and clever for a low budget show. Austen fans will enjoy it.",1504137600,,84,4.666666666666667
7066247,5,B00UOW1XQ4,"I dearly love all things Jane Austen, And this series was adorable!  The characters relationships to each other and their personalities flowed really well in this adaptation.  My friends and I are clamoring for season 2!!",1503014400,,221,5.111111111111111
7066248,5,B00UOW1XQ4,Loved this show! Wish they would make another one!!!,1502928000,,52,4.888888888888889
7066249,5,B00UOW1XQ4,This was super cute. Would love to see season two. I would love to see closure at least.,1502755200,,88,3.9444444444444446
7066250,5,B00UOW1XQ4,"This show is awesome!!!!!!!!! Ok you need to understand the acting is not oscar calibur, and its low budget but if you LOVE jane austen movies and LOVE HALLMARK you will ADORE this!!!! It is such a creative and amazing idea!!!!!! This needs a seaaon 2!!!!! What is this show doing here???? Its a cute little diamond that is so hidden!!!!!",1502668800,,338,4.557377049180328
7066251,5,B00UOW1XQ4,I've always wondered how Austen's heroines would interact with each other and I've always been a fan of modern day adaptations so naturally this was a dream come true! It's a difficult story to tackle I think because it's not just a modern day adaptation it's also combining 3 different stories. I thought they did a surprisingly good job with it! It takes a good imagination to find ways of making all the stories combine with out it getting sloppy or too busy but they managed. Modern day adaptations of Austen novels are always cheesy because it's just the nature of the genre and I'm not saying this wasn't a bit cheesy because it was but the cheesiness was delicious and fun and not distracting like I've seen it in other adaptations. I really loved it and I'm so sad that there isn't a season 2 yet I'm dying to know what happens and how other characters will be portrayed.,1502668800,,879,4.5
7066252,5,B00UOW1XQ4,"It's cute.  No, it isn't Jane's original work--it's modern and some artistic license has been used, but it's kind of fun.  I love that it's clean, (one thing I'm sure Jane would appreciate compared to some of the other crap made from her works!!) and it has some originality to it.  I just barely found it a week ago and am disappointed that they don't have another season in the works.",1502409600,2,386,4.408450704225352
7066253,5,B00UOW1XQ4,season 2 please!!!,1502236800,,18,5.333333333333333
7066254,5,B00UOW1XQ4,I. LOVE. THIS!!! This is such a cute adaptation of Jane Austen's novels. I love the idea of weaving the story lines together. I binge watched the season and I NEEEEEED Season 2!,1501977600,,177,4.393939393939394
7066255,5,B00UOW1XQ4,For a low budget indie type of thing....pretty stinkin' good. great acting.,1501804800,,75,5.333333333333333
7066256,5,B00UOW1XQ4,I loved this! I wish so much that there was a second season! It was seriously soooo good and 100 percent clean! Something to watch as a family. The story is super cute. It has a modern day setting but all of the main characters are main characters from Jane Austen's books. I am a huge Jane Austen fan! They don't have a second season out because they don't have the funding which makes me sad. I just binge watched the whole thing in just a couple of hours and wish there was more!,1501459200,3,482,4.138297872340425
7066257,5,B00UOW1XQ4,I love all things Jane Austen and this might just be the best thing ever! Interweaving the stories and making all the girls best friends just feels so right and I really need there to be a second season! I need closure at least! Please make more!!!,1501372800,,248,4.297872340425532
7066258,5,B00UOW1XQ4,"A very clever way to bring the characters of Austen into the new era. The nods to the story are amazing. Second Season, where are you?!",1501286400,,135,4.230769230769231
7066259,5,B00UOW1XQ4,Loved it. Wish there was a season 2,1500508800,,35,3.5
7066260,1,B00UOW1XQ4,"I can't believe this has 5 stars. I couldn't make it through an entire episode.  Bad acting, terrible writing, awful casting--and Emma's accent is so fake and she keeps dropping it. How on earth did 111 people give this an average 5 stars?! This is the worst Austen remake I've ever seen--and I watched the entirety of scents and sensibility.",1500422400,3,342,4.7
7066261,2,B00UOW1XQ4,"If you are a fan of Jane Austen, do not watch this. (The BBC Pride & Prejudice is my favorite. If I ignore how the character of Elizabeth Bennet is supposed to be, the Keira Knightley version is entertaining. I can only guess that the producers or actors bribed 100 people to give this terrible series such a ridiculously high rating!!!)  This conceptually-interesting modern-day mash-up of multiple Austen novels is the equivalent of a poorly-written and developed sitcom that's not that funny. The only reason I played it all the way through was because I started it while taking a dinner break, and it made me want to get back to my work sooner!

You also get no real ending in 10 episodes, and it's too bad to be continued; so, you'll also never find out what happened to the characters.  Not that you'll really care because they are fairly one-dimensional--and when one does ""grow"" there is not much motivation or reason shown for it.",1500336000,2,939,4.678787878787879
7066262,5,B00UOW1XQ4,"Super cute, funny, and clean.",1500249600,,29,5.0
7066263,5,B00UOW1XQ4,"Absolutely, perfectly adorable!!! This was the best modern twist of all the stories I've ever come across. The characters are so cute, so perfect, and the way they are taken from the book to weave into each other's lives is brilliant. Desperately hoping for season 2. I want to have a girl's night and binge watch as many seasons as they will make.",1499990400,,348,4.5396825396825395
7066264,4,B00UOW1XQ4,"Poorly acted & produced but still interesting enough to binge watch when you're bored.
as of this reviewing, there is no plan for season 2, so I would suggest that you actually  don't watch season 1 because you will be disappointed that so many relationships & questions go unresolved",1498262400,,284,4.795918367346939
7066265,5,B00UOW1XQ4,Need season 2!,1497830400,,14,4.0
7066266,1,B00UOW1XQ4,"This was pretty bad. I expected it to be bad but the good reviews made me curious. Now that I've seen it, I really don't understand how the rating could be so high. Law of small averages I suppose. The characters seemed so off what I would have envisioned their modern day counterparts to be. Even Clueless was a better modern day Austen adaptation than this. In any single Austen book there is more character development and social interplay than this medley of three different Austen books.",1496620800,4,492,4.666666666666667
7066267,5,B00UOW1XQ4,"Fun, clean show. I wish there were a second season! (Kevin's wife)",1496016000,,66,4.583333333333333
7066268,5,B00UOW1XQ4,Bring back Season 2 please ....or at least wrap up the story... Such a nice show. Really enjoyed the characters and their costumes. I want to see how long Marianne lasts in Paris! Good clean show. Great concept ...especially for us Jane Austin fans (and there is a lot of us out there !! )... a great show with global appeal!,1495324800,2,325,4.344262295081967
7066269,5,B00UOW1XQ4,I like the characters and I hope this is a show that will continue.  There are few shows now that offer quality entertainment.  This is one of them.  I recommend it.,1494115200,,165,4.258064516129032
7066270,4,B00UOW1XQ4,Some cheesy parts in the show but I really enjoyed it.,1492905600,,54,4.0
7066271,3,B00UOW1XQ4,Not enough Darcy & Elizabeth.,1492300800,,29,5.0
7066272,1,B00UOW1XQ4,My one star review is only due to the fact they used lighting in this production and you can see images.,1492041600,3,104,4.0
7066273,5,B00UOW1XQ4,"OK, so the cheesy factor is definitely there! But it is fun and clean and that is very important to me. I also think it is a unique portrayal of some very beloved characters. I would love a second season. Someone pick it up!",1491609600,,224,4.113636363636363
7066274,4,B00UOW1XQ4,"I enjoyed the storyline more than some of the actors performances. I found that I wanted the show to be longer too. I recommend for those who like The Lizzie Bennet Diaries, but I like this better. Waiting for season 2.",1490659200,,219,4.365853658536586
7066275,5,B00UOW1XQ4,"I didn't think I would like this at first, but once I started watching I just couldn't get enough of it. I was so very disappointed to find out nobody would pick them up for season 2! Hopefully they can get it crowd funded. As for the storyline, if the idea of a modern version of Emma, Pride and Prejudice, and Sense and Sensibility in the same show doesn't appeal, then maybe this isn't for you. For me, it was like watching something similar to a sitcom but that I actually enjoyed.",1489968000,3,485,4.282608695652174
7066276,4,B00UOW1XQ4,"At a month post-partum, I need mindless entertainment while feeding the baby at night. And this met that criteria. It is clean, mindless entertainment. BUT I almost stopped watching it because it is not the best production quality and the acting can be a bit amateurish. The characters are likable, but they could be MUCH more complex and interesting IMO. They are caricatures, but still fun to watch if you don't take the Austen thing too serious. There is actually some serious potential in some of the scenes. Like when Mr. Knightly deconstructs a date the women are over-analyzing...or a series of unfortunate blind dates for Emma that end up disastrous, But some dialogue is totally unnecessary and other times lacks depth. You feel like you're sitting in on a meeting. Could benefit greatly from better pacing. Also, this is a ""clean"" show but clean does not need to mean whitewashed...and with this series, it does. Everyone seems naive and too retro for 20-30 something characters in 2015...and don't get me started on the fashion choices, which all feel very last decade. Would love to see Christians offer entertainment that is clean but still offers depth. This doesn't do that. However, I still watched it. I went back to it like that bag of chips you know you shouldn't finish but you do anyway!!",1489795200,2,1309,4.848214285714286
7066277,5,B00UOW1XQ4,This is a fun to watch. I really enjoyed watching this. Great Story!,1488931200,,68,4.3076923076923075
7066278,5,B00UOW1XQ4,"I have always been an Austen fan and have read and seen everything by and around her. I really loved this season, but was sad that it had ended the way it did without a next season. I hope season 2 comes out soon!",1488499200,,213,3.8636363636363638

7066281,2,B00UOW1XQ4,"I was hoping to like this but, boy is it bad.  Filmed like a high school student's film project and acted pretty poorly as well.  One of the most annoying things Emma's accent --the actress goes back and forth between Australian, American and some sort of British accent.  Painful.",1488326400,,281,4.6938775510204085
7066282,5,B00UOW1XQ4,So amazing! A transformation of my favorite authors works to present day! I love that I can watch it in front of my 2 & 5 year old girls and not worry about bad language or raunchy behavior. Hopefully season 2 comes out soon!,1488153600,,225,4.136363636363637

7066284,5,B00UOW1XQ4,Such a fun show to watch! Loved the characters and clean humor! I'm hoping there will be about 10 more seasons. :) I stumbled across this and will be encouraging all my friends to watch it and rate it so there will be a second season! (See the fb page.),1486771200,,253,4.08
7066285,4,B00UOW1XQ4,I truly enjoyed this interesting combination of Austen storylines. Here's to keeping hope alive for a Season 2!,1486512000,,111,5.222222222222222
7066286,4,B00UOW1XQ4,"A delightful take on classic stories. It's no Lizzie Bennet Diaries, but I am very much hoping for another season to see how they adapt the stories with these lovable characters.",1486425600,,178,4.774193548387097
7066287,5,B00UOW1XQ4,"Also hoping for season 2. I love the good, clean humor and storyline. It's light-hearted, cute, and enjoyable. It's entertaining seeing the character ties to characters from Austen's books play out in ""real life.""",1486080000,,213,5.294117647058823
7066288,5,B00UOW1XQ4,"Just found this on Prime. Flew through season 1. Light and fun for Austen fans.
Mine stops at episode 10...is that right? It says there are 15 episodes but only shows me 10. Please tell me there will be a season 2! So much fun. Sure it has flaws but overall it is like a more chaste and romantic modern Austen take on Sex in the City. Want more.",1485475200,,345,4.0144927536231885
7066289,3,B00UOW1XQ4,"The only funny moments are the unrealistic dates Emma has with a couple of nuts.  Otherwise, the series is fluff -- quite bland, and I agree with another reviewer who says that the main characters differ little in personality.  The Austen character names are the only resemblance this production has to Austen -- this comes across more like the series ""Friends,"" but with less interesting characters and situations.  The use of Austen's name just appears to be yet another of the many marketing attempts to capitalize on her brand.  Unfortunately, it lacks the insight, depth and wit that is the hallmark of that brand.  The series is tolerable, but only just, and I wouldn't waste time watching another season.",1485129600,,711,4.9411764705882355
7066290,1,B00UOW1XQ4,"As an avid Austen fan I was willing to give this a try it is horrid.  The main issue being that the actors are way too old.  Some of these women look like they are in their 40s.  I don't have a problem with fall winter romances with older actors, but don't take classic characters and destroy them just to try to do something new.  Acting and writing was equally terrible.  I would have preferred individual adaptations perhaps 2 episodes each of the different stories more like a mini series.  They could have even reused actors in them whatever, but this had way to much going on and not in a good way.",1485043200,,604,4.300884955752212

7066293,4,B00UOW1XQ4,"While I am a Jane Austen devotee, I do not think she would mind in the least that Sun World has made a light little show loosely based on her wonderful characters. I enjoy things I can watch with my kids - short episodes that are not demanding nor require me to fast-forward or explain. Certainly hope the seasons continue.",1484438400,,323,4.4
7066294,1,B00UOW1XQ4,"I am shocked at the positive reviews and all the 5 stars. Did we watch the same show? I couldn't last past the first episode. Really bad writing, over acting, and silly scenes. To add insult to injury, Darcy is unattractive! Do yourself a huge favor and give this a miss. I wish I had.",1484179200,4,285,4.2
7066295,5,B00UOW1XQ4,"It is so refreshing to see a well produced and acted production without any of today's current ""worldy"" culture and agenda affecting what I watch. It is definitely a series that I would love to see more of and hope the Season 2 will be on it's way soon!",1484179200,,253,4.183673469387755
7066296,5,B00UOW1XQ4,"I watched the entire season one in an evening. LOVE it! Good clean fun and a wonderful modern adaptation of the characters from Jane Austen's books. Collin cracks me up! Love Knightly. Adore Emma, terrific job, really captures her. You can't go wrong with this!",1484006400,,261,4.822222222222222
7066297,3,B00UOW1XQ4,"I think the show has potential for a Season 2, and I would enjoy watching it. The plot is fine as long as you're not expecting a Jane Austen-type show. It's unclear why the show is called ""Austentatious."" Most of the characters' personalities and appearances are so similar that it's confusing. They all dress in the same style. With faster paced, more clever writing and more noticeable differentiation between characters' personalities, the cute romance story lines could carry the show. Filming and sound seemed fine to me, two things that can be intolerable in low-budget productions. Acting was OK.  I'm happy to see a clean movie.",1484006400,,636,5.0

Elinor as an accountant - absolutely, and romantic Marianne a jobless floater..  . all of it makes So much sense. It's entertaining, delightful and fun.

Imagine if Jane Austen's characters lived in 2016. That's the charm of this show! ""Her characters"" go through the same day to day things that we all do. They go on bad dates, have family struggles, are virtually stalked by Mr. Collins and fall in love. I totally recommend this show to everyone and anyone! It's an increadibly family friendly, feel good show.",1477353600,,513,4.775280898876405
7066345,2,B00UOW1XQ4,"I can't believe people liked this show. It was almost painful. I realize budget must have been low, but we can do better than this. I think the woman playing ""Emma"" does the best job of the central characters, but her English accent mysteriously disappears in the blind date sequences. So bizarre. And ""Elinor""... you're a professional accountant, why are you wearing jeans to work??

I can forgive just about anything when it comes to Jane Austen adaptations. Her characters and stories are so wonderful that you can get past a lot but wow, what a spectacular waste of time.",1477353600,4,575,4.75

7066357,3,B00UOW1XQ4,"Forced and annoying in so many ways, but lightweight enough to watch when you have the blahs.  There have been so many 'updates' both on screen and in novels of late that Austen is more like an industry these days.

These young women eat take-out on the couch with each other on most nights.  Of course, all are slim and stylish.  They live in a generic city, so the setting and class issues are murky and vague, not clever or lush.  The actor playing Grant Knightly is impossibly Right for Her, while almost all the other men are ciphers or annoying.  The women are types.  They don't lack talent; they lack a good script.

Given that all have smart phones......why do they not look men up instead of brooding about myriad What Ifs the way one had to in Austin's day?  Does Darcy have a wife, a sister, a mother who needs a house?  Does the IRS guy have a Facebook presence?

I didn't know what The Dove Network was.  Now that I do, it makes sense that there's nothing edgy at all to gnaw on.  That said, I admit I'd watch a second season.  If and when I get the blahs again.",1475366400,4,1076,4.236453201970443
7066358,5,B00UOW1XQ4,I love this mash up of three Jane Austen novels. I will warn you that the stories don't wrap up in one season. I hope the second season comes out soon.,1469404800,2,151,3.903225806451613
7066359,2,B00UOW1XQ4,"First off, I'm a huge fan of Jane Austen (as if my name weren't clue enough)!
 I've read all of her major novels (& working on her short stories), and have seen MANY movie & miniseries adaptations (including some modern day versions), biographies, documentaries, etc.

This production was highly disappointing, primarily because aside from their names, and a couple minor details, there is really no connection in the storylines to Jane Austen's novels!  Add to it the fact that these characters are so far off from what I would envision their modern day counterparts to be.  Also, the storylines themselves are either juvenile, or mundane.

**SEMI SPOILERS AHEAD**

This ""Marianne"" (the same actress who plays the lead in ""Love Finds You In Charm) is extremely immature, and doesn't see the importance of holding down a job.  (Granted her book counterpart was a mere 17 year old, who was a bit over dramatic, self-centered, and narrow minded at times.)  Given the book versions interests, couldn't the writers have at least made her an aspiring musician (or actress), budding novelist (or poet)?  At least some decent life goals, and not an airheaded flake?

The British actress playing ""Emma"", and her actual portrayal of her character seems more fitted for ""Lizzy Bennet"".  The chosen profession however is totally unsuited for her character (at least in comparison to the book version),  Modern day ""Emma"" would be more suited as a ""wedding planner"".

""Knightley"" is semi-convincing, but it's not really clear what he does, other than bring ""Emma"" ice cream, and hang around in social settings.  He also seems more suited for ""Edward Ferrars"", but this actor already played that part in the movie ""Scents & Sensibility"".

The least appealing female character of this adaptation is ""Eleanor"", and ""Elizabeth"" not far behind (pity too, since they're 2 of my favorite JA heroines).
This ""Eleanor"" is somewhat obnoxious, and a control freak (especially in episode 1).  I don't envision a modern day ""Eleanor"" as a tax  accountant,  but rather a counselor/therapist, or some sort of artist (painter, photographer, interior designer).
And this ""Lizzy"" is a real estate agent...come again?!  A attorney maybe (which would have made more sense to conveniently play off this ""Mr. Darcy""-- who is also an attorney).  But since the novel's version has a love of books, modern ""Elizabeth"" would make a good English Literature or History Professor, or even a museum curator.

This ""Edward Ferrars"" (an IRS agent), is also miscast and misrepresented!
In line with his book character's personality (who only desired a low profile profession, so he could live a simple life), a modern E.F. would have made a good school teacher, or pastor.
""Brandon"" they made a nurse... go figure!
Finally, why on earth did they throw ""Mr. Collins"" into this mix, when he's one of Austen's most annoying characters?!  This one is a geeky creepy stalker!  (I'm frankly wondering when Lizzy is going to get sick of it, and slap a restraining order on him!)  It would have been far better to replace him with ""Mr. Wickham"" or ""Willoughby"".

To sum it up...  it's just a bunch of 20-30 year olds eating and drinking, and making small talk, or dealing with 1st world problems (such as trying to put an exercise bike together, or trying to trap a mouse on the loose in their apartment, or whining about a broken toe).

As you can see, I'm really not impressed with this modern loose adaptation.  It's more atrocious, than ""austen-tatious""!
If you're a fellow ""Janeite"", just know this isn't anywhere near what you're hoping or expecting from something that claims to be associated with Miss Austen.
The only real positive thing this has going for it, is that it's family friendly.",1468108800,3,3746,4.979099678456592

7066361,4,B00UOW1XQ4,"I agree with the viewer who said she found it really cute.  I  thought the actors were very likable.  The characters were not hopping into bed with each other but were depicted as first developing relationships with possible love interests and getting to know them....I consider myself pretty modern and jaded but found that very refreshing...so sick of comedies that depict everyone talking trash and ""doing it"" as soon as they meet.  The friends were depicted as very supportive of each other.  I found it engaging and depicting Emma as a matchmaker as she was in the novel, and Elizabeth as an agent for Darcy as he purchases a home for his sister a creative way to present the characters.  Hope it renews for Season 2.",1464048000,2,722,4.690476190476191
