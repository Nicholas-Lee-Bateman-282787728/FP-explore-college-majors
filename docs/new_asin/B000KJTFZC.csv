2692099,1,B000KJTFZC,"This film is single-handedly the worst piece of crap I've ever wasted the time watching. Editing, shooting, effects, makeup, acting, directing...every single aspect of this film was terrible, disjointed, unorganized and poorly exucuted. The worst of them all is the horrible wannabe actor/director who played the cab driver. A little fairy-like, pixy lad like him shouldn't be allowed near a camera under any circumstances. Some people have the gift of good storytelling...he doesn't. The best part of this film is when it was over and I threw it in the garbage. Fortuntely, I had a free copy. Save your money and buy movies, folks, not trash like this.",1175040000,3,653,5.055555555555555
2692100,5,B000KJTFZC,"I love horror movies and this one did not let me down.  I was expecting a low budget experience for an indie film but it wasn't anywhere low budget.  The plot was good, characters likable, and very funny at times.

I would recommend this movie to all horror film fans.",1173225600,5,268,4.32
2692101,5,B000KJTFZC,"Twisted and playfully macabre, ""Bit Parts"" is every Plain Jane's schadenfreude.  In the film directed by Dave Reda, young Hollywood starlets with perfect lips, eyes and breasts are lured, one by one, to a remote warehouse location where `bad things happen to beautiful people'.  Here, vanity results in death, as each girl is systematically harvested for her attributes.  Dr. Cranston (Christopher Page) is a plastic surgeon driven mad with guilt over his disfigured daughter, Maggie's accident (humorously played by Michelle Angel).  Blood mixes with laughter as the shady doctor attempts to surgically attach various, desirable parts to his willful daughter's crumbling body. As the film progresses, it becomes increasingly clear that Maggie is a lost cause in the beauty department.  All in all, ""Bit Parts"" is a grisly riot!  Sarah Gordon, as concerned sister Brenda Martin, is positively luminous and Dave Reda as cab driver Bobby Dumont keeps the film both charming and light. These two characters combined, provide viewers with enough level headed heroism and whimsy folks rooting for them until final moments of the film. ~ Part horror, part suspense, part romance and comedy, if perfection exists, ""Bit Parts"" comes pretty close.",1172966400,6,1238,5.355670103092783
2692102,4,B000KJTFZC,"I thought that this was a good little indie horror film with a good story. It's not your typical ultra-bloody slasher film, but I found that refreshing. The acting was good all around and I liked the look of the movie, which looked like it was done on film rather than the DV, which is what a lot of these low budgets are filmed on. The director's commentary was funny and worth checking out.",1172966400,2,392,4.3108108108108105
2692103,1,B000KJTFZC,"Really low budget.  Horrible acting.  I just couldn't finish it.  I will watch anything that remotely qualifies as horror, but this movie doesn't even warrant someone's time or energy of placing it in a category.  The quality was on par with that of a 500$ cam-corder.  It was just unwatchable, I have no clue why any one would say that this movie is ok, or worse ""great"" or ""fun"".  Don't buy it, don't rent it. If some one offers to let you borrow it, slap them. I used to use customer reviews as criteria for buying movies, I guess I got reminded just how many stupid people there are out there.  Tu che idiots, tu che.",1172966400,4,621,4.301724137931035
2692104,4,B000KJTFZC,"I wandered into the Camera Theatre, decided to check this out, and was pleasantly surprised... It's a fun horror film that's not cheesy like you would expect for an indie flick.  I'm not the type to get scared at the movies, but watch horror for the comedic value, and I more than got my money's worth... It has a nice blend of Shock, One-Liners, and some great laughs... A great movie worth watching.",1165276800,6,401,4.493150684931507
2692105,4,B000KJTFZC,"After watching NBC do an impressive segment on BP I decided to take a chance and have a look during its theatrical release.  After all, it isn't every day a tv station does a story on an indie thriller.  So, imagine my surprise when I turned my tube on and saw these BIT PARTS dudes interviewed on a major network.  I had to see what the fuss was about.  With its mix of originality, gore, chills and comedy I must say that I too am a believer.  BIT PARTS rocks!  I applaud all responsible parties for choosing not to make another run of the mill cookie cutter 'mad slasher versus teens in the forest' turkey.  This pic is hardcore horror and its unique premise more than demonstrates- wouldn't want to give too much away but let's just say that it centers on a nasty plastic surgeon with a seriously diabolical bedside manner.  And by enlarging the dvd cover I see the clever tagline THIS IS NO ORDINARY NIP & TUCK.  Truly a great homage to the successful FX series and I couldn't have said it better myself.  Kudos to Dave Reda for his expert out of the box directing and for tackling a subject that is topical, fresh and one which hasn't been done to death (pardon the pun).  And a special rock on to Tim Alexander of Primus for some seriously butt kicking music.  Thank you NBC for giving these talented filmmakers the exposure they deserved.  Take a chance everyone.  Once you watch BP you won't look away!",1165017600,6,1411,4.397683397683398
2692106,4,B000KJTFZC,After seing a segment on NBC 11 I went to see this movie at a theater in San Jose and I was quite impressed.  It had a great combination of suspense and gore with a few laughs for good measure.  The cinematography gave the movie that extra erie feel to it while the effects enhanced the gore.  The actors did a good job making the characters and story believable.  To make sure I hadn't missed anything I stayed for the second show.  I am happy to find that it is finally available on DVD.,1164931200,4,489,4.159574468085107

8157394,3,B000KJTFZC,"I got the movie for one reason; and one reason only. Sarah Gordon and I went to the same high school together. In 2022, I plan to take it with me to our 30th reunion and have her sign it. Of course, I hope she will by a few of my book and make it an even autograph exchange. As for the movie itself, Sarah Gordon carried the movie from the moment she came on screen. You might think I'm saying this because of my past with her; but no, truly, I felt she was the strongest member of the cast. I would recommend this movie to anybody for a little over an hour of some weird horror movie action.",1396396800,,592,3.941666666666667
8157395,3,B000KJTFZC,"Bit Parts (Dave Reda, 2006)

I have to say that when I watch microbudget horror films these days, I go into them not expecting much. It's a pessimistic policy, but not a terrible one; that way, when you come up with something really good, you're pleasantly surprised, and you're never too disappointed. I'd like to say that Bit Parts is something special-- another Deadbirds or something-- but it never quite gets to that level. Still, for the amateur production it obviously is, it surprised me in just about every way.

The plot, as noted by All-Movie Guide, is a riff on Eyes Without a Face, Georges' Franju's 1959 thriller: after a car accident, a plastic surgeon (Christopher Page)'s daughter (Michelle Angel) is left horribly disfigured, and he lures innocent, beautiful girls to his home to use pieces of them to reconstruct his daughter's body. When Brenda Martin (Sarah Gordon) falls into the trap, her sister Melissa (Molly Fix) and the cab driver (played by Reda) who took her to the supposed movie audition from which she was kidnapped try to find her while she's still alive.

It suffers all the problems one expects from a microbudget flick, but perhaps not as much as most; the acting isn't A-list, but it's surprisingly good for a production of this level. The script isn't as tight as it could be, but it's quick and grimly funny. The camerwork is of surprisingly high quality, and the music (supplied by Primus drummer Tim Alexander) fits in quite well. Yes, it's derivative and kind of silly, but that doesn't make it any less fun. Certainly worth killing an hour and a half with. ** ",1194825600,3,1603,4.755395683453237

8157397,5,B000KJTFZC,"This movie kept me entertained. I found it scary and funny. The characters pulled me into the movie. Excellent acting, with the exception of the daughter and doctor, kept the movie believeable. LA appeared hot and sleezy, which accurately depicted the loneliness and desperation felt by many young actors there. Overall, a very good independent film.",1176249600,3,350,5.267857142857143
8157398,1,B000KJTFZC,"This movie was complete garbage!!! I cannot believe this thing made it out of the trash can. This movie is amateurish in every way.

8157399,5,B000KJTFZC,"Bit Parts is a wonderful low-budget film that blends horror and subversive humor. I review horror films for a living so I know a few things about what makes a great film, especially in the horror genre.

Bit Parts has an original story (owing some plot points to the classic French horror film Eyes Without a Face), great character development, is professionally shot and looks great, has some great black comedy throughout and the gore (though there isn't much) looks great!

The main reason I enjoyed this film was the social commentary it presented on plastic surgery and the L.A. lifestyle. Getting lured to phony auditions is something that could really happen in L.A. and the plastic surgery angle is dead-on.

Most of all though, this is an entertaining and enjoyable low-budget film.  Highly recommended!",1175212800,7,812,4.992592592592593
8157400,4,B000KJTFZC,My wife and I are always on the lookout for up and coming directors. Looks like Dave Reda is on his way to becoming a great director. This movie has an original story line and not like the cookie cutter crap that all the other indie film makers are putting out. Not only is the have a great horror value but there is a few great one liners thrown in will have you laughing out loud. Definitly worth checking this one out and I love how it came out in the super 16 film. This movie is very good and i'd love to see another film by this director on a mega film studio budget. Good luck on your future Dave. Loved the movie.,1175126400,6,621,4.016129032258065

Okay, please make me feel better and tell me you all are friends or family of the actors or director. But I guess they accomplished their goal at making a HORRID film. I guess the saddest part of all of this... after returning the movie, I still spent six bucks on shipping.",1175126400,4,440,4.353658536585366

I'm not a huge fan of horror films, I must admit, but I'm glad I had the opportunity to come across this one.  I thought the characters were great as well as the storyline.  As other reviewers have mentioned, I also liked the 70's-esque film style.  Another wonderful release and win for small, independent film-making!

TAGLINE: THIS IS NO ORDINARY NIP & TUCK

What the back DVD says:

Dr. Cranston is a successful plastic surgeon in Los Angeles until his daughter is horribly disfigured in a car accident that he caused. To ease his remorse, he tirelessly labors to replace the magled features of his sweet Maggie. Wanting his daughter to be perfect, Dr. Cranston seeks women with the perfect nose, perfect eyes, or perfect breasts for his daughter.

72 min's. Written by Jon Rosenberg produced and directed by Dave Reda who also stars in the movie.

My viewpoint:

AN INDIE FILM WITH SOME PROMISE OF FUTURE MASTERPIECES.

The movie is a perfect Indie horror movie with some amazing written parts that have an original touch of humor and horror mixed together. The direction for a new comer to the movie world Dave Reda is by far some of the best I have seen when it comes to Indie horror movies. The acting is very strong at times and sometimes can be a little corny and bad. The over all aspect to the movie is a well put together first time approach.

I was amazed at the opening. The dark approach and grainy feel to the camera lens gave it that realistic appeal to life. It was acted out like you and me who is reading This would be average people living out there lifes and going about there daily business.

The makeup was not half bad. The low budget appeal could be seen at times but does not effect the over all outcome to the movie. I think the only bad things at times was the added cornyness to the story. Such as the daughter Maggie playing that spoiled little rich girl type feel, which at times got on my nerves. The other odd approach to the movie was the father, clearly insane and really the movie did nothing to explain how he was simply falling apart, but living at the same time, but what do you expect from a simple Indie low budget horror movie.

I am floored at the original feel of this movie. It's a fun ride with so so acting and so so storyline. I would give it a watch to support Indie cinema, which is the most important thing any horror fan can do this day and age when it comes to the horror world. Rent it, buy it, spread the word so that Indie movies never die. The best thing a horror fan can do is pass up the big budget horror that tends to be trendy and just plain bad or so PG MPAA snore fest and give a new director the welcome mat into the horror world.

For Indie Horror fans it's a great watch. Go into IT like approaching a low budget movie with a director and writer that love's horror and wished to make a half way decent movie. Buy it and support Indie Horror.

AND NOW FOR A PERSONAL THOUGHT FOR HATERS OF INDIE HORROR:
