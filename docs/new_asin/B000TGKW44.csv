2899218,3,B000TGKW44,"Spending time abroad offers an escape and changes people.  Lorena Bobbitt considered returning South America after a famous maiming controversy.  Some say Michael Jackson and Michael Richards are abroad after receiving bad press.  Gary Glitter ran to Cuba after nefarious charges came against him.  This documentary at first seems to dance around the subject, but then it straight-up says FLW's career had fallen in the US because of the news of his flagrant adultery and so he started doing work in Japan.  This work is a two-way street:  FLW influenced Japan and Japan influenced him.

Some FLW documentaries just focus on biographical facts and his designs.  This work also spoke about the effort it took to get buildings erected.  It spoke of a lack of materials in Japan and about corruption among real estate figures there.  The work goes further by detailing that man FLW designs were never erected and some buildings that did go up were destroyed by fire or earthquakes, though they fare better than typical Japanese structures.

This documentary shows how Japonisme influenced not only Impressionist painters, but also architects.  Though FLW said the art of Japan influenced him, rather than the architecture, still this call from the East is strong.  If you love looking at woodblock prints, kimonos, and photos of Japan from the early 1900s, then you'll have a soft spot for this work.

The work has diverse interviewees: whites and Japanese, male and female, possibly some age diversity too.  Because I associated Will Smith with films and David Stewart with the Eurythmics, it was easy for me to be surprised that others have these names, even though they are common English-language ones.

My problem with this documentary is that it is TOO LONG.  They could have wrapped this up in 60 or 90 minutes; two hours was excessive.  Perhaps though, this was made for FLW enthusiasts and Japanophiles who would want lengthy discussions on these topics.",1201305600,4,1960,5.03416149068323
2899219,5,B000TGKW44,I knew that Wright was influenced by Japanese art and architecture.  I had no idea how much he had influenced them.  A very nice movie.,1198108800,5,135,4.36
2899220,4,B000TGKW44,"An informative account of the history behind Frank Lloyd Wright Japanese Buildings although if one is seeking to understand the specific influences that Japanese art, culture, philosophy and architecture had on Wright you will be disappointed...it is rather sparse.  Never-the-less one is provided with much information.  I have discovered that no one source about Wright provides a well-rounded, informative discourse.  This video will suppliment other Wright on Japan sources.",1193702400,12,478,5.898550724637682
2899221,5,B000TGKW44,"There's a lot to like about this movie, and not much to complain about. A quick pace, great images and a good cubic mile of stuff you didn't already know. I gained new perspective on Frank Lloyd Wright's work -- all of it, not just the buildings in Japan. And, an added bonus, you'll meet Arata Endo, possibly the most likable, engaging character you'll ever meet in a historical documentary.

Obviously, the whole point of Magnificent Obsession is the visuals. The movie delivers just what a Wright fan wants: lots of drawings, historic photos and architectural models. Though it doesn't lack for scene-setting cityscapes or photos of the main actors, architectural images occupy the majority of the screen time

This historical documentary puts architecture before biography. Details of Frank Lloyd Wright's life aren't ignored, but focus of the film is true to the subtitle: Frank Lloyd Wright's Buildings and Legacy in Japan -- the filmmakers aren't concerned with Wright's character flaws or scandals beyond how they affect his work and life in Japan (in fact, there's a story of a bit of surprising post-war generosity on Wright's part that contradicts the popular image of a spoiled spendthrift). There is no sugarcoating of Wright, but the film is focused on Wright and Japan.

The film doesn't end when Wright leaves Japan. He served as a mentor to a number of young Japanese architects, and their work reflected his influence, through, and after World War II. The film follows their work, and the fate of Wright's buildings through to the present day (be warned, the footage of wrecking balls taking down the Imperial Hotel is agonizing to watch -- there's no V-chip for architectural desecration).

What I like best about the film -- what makes it stand out as a valuable documentary -- is the context it wraps around Wright's work in Japan. We see Japan begin to emulate European styles (and we get a glimpse of just how grotesquely out of place they were); we see Wright arrive with new ideas, new techniques, and an enthusiasm that fires a generation of young architects; those same architects develop Wright's ideas and create their own remarkable buildings and, eventually, play a role in preserving Wright's own additions to Japan's built environment.

So, simply, the film is great; it's beautiful, polished and thrillingly educational. It isn't meant only for Wright groupies, architecture fanboys or building nerds; it's an actual, honest-to-goodness great documentary: quickly paced, lots of character and full of interesting sights and ideas. So even your non-fanatical housemate/spouse/copanion will enjoy it.

The webiste for the film has some great background information, a trailer and a guide to further reading (if you've already seen the movie, note that the website has information on the musicians who contributed)
The film has its own legacy -- The Wrightian Architectural Archives Japan, a non-profit dedicated to preserving Frank Lloyd Wright's buildings and legacy in Japan and a site worth exploring.",1192924800,18,3036,5.148073022312373
2899222,5,B000TGKW44,"Magnificent Obsession

There is a vast amount of Frank Lloyd Wright material out there, much of it covering the same tired biographical territory. Fact.

Then along came Magnificent Obsession (no not the one with Rock Hudson). Magnificent Obsession, Frank Lloyd Wright's Buildings and Legacy in Japan is unparallel in regards to its subject matter. Although any Wrightophile can tell you that Frank Lloyd Wright was enraptured and secretly influenced by Japan, there is a gaping hole in the literature detailing the years he spent visiting and working in Japan.

One would expect to see rare footage of Wright in Japan as well as visuals of the Imperial Hotel and the private residences he built there. You won't be disappointed. What you may not expect to learn is the degree of influence Wright had on the country that he himself took so much inspiration from, the long-standing relationships that were formed and the Japanese iteration of the Wright's nature-based organic architecture. The film is well researched and is rich in detail regarding the architects who worked with Wright such are Arata Endo, his chief draftsman on the Imperial Hotel as well as modern day architects who discuss how Wright's pervasive influence is still a powerful force today.

I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in Frank Lloyd Wright, modern architecture or Japan.",1191456000,26,1365,5.135135135135135
2899223,5,B000TGKW44,"I was fortunate to see this informative and visually arresting film when it debuted in Chicago at a sell-out showing in Frank Lloyd Wright's  Unity Temple. I didn't know much about Wright beyond the usual, general knowledge surrounding his life and major works.  But because I lived in Japan for a couple of years, I became curious about his own years in Japan and what this film might make of crosscultural influences.

The film was richly textured and extremely informative, far more so than the usual PBS or A&E documentaries. I didn't realize that Wright worked on so many projects in Japan, or that he had such an enduring impact on Japanese architecture. If you're interested in Wright or architecture, you'll thoroughly enjoy the visual appeal of and informative narrative in this DVD.",1190073600,7,792,4.93984962406015
2899224,4,B000TGKW44,"I had the opportunity to see this film when it was screened a while back at the Siskel Theater in Chicago and, I must say, I was quite impressed.  While I'm not an architecture expert, I am a Frank Lloyd Wright fan and have been to Taliesin and any number of FLW homes and buildings.  ""Magnificent Obsession"" is a convincing argument on FLW's profound impact on Japanese architecture and how his fusion of East and West is still influencing today's leading Japanese architects.

This is an educational film but it's also just beautiful to watch because of the endless visuals.  Many of the images are historical stills that, because of the editing, look like actual film footage.  Despite the long running time the overall quality of the images, writing and narration kept me engaged.

Although the focus is on Wright, there's a great deal of information on his apprentices and other Japanese architects who followed of his organic design principles.  There's also some heart-wrenching moments related to the fates of some of these architects and the tragic fate of FLW's masterpiece, the Imperial Hotel.

I would rate ""Magnificent Obsession"" a ""Must See"" for any Frank Lloyd Wright fan.",1189555200,6,1187,4.959595959595959

8209244,5,B000TGKW44,"Nothing is as grand as to see two worlds connect through the artistry and creative endeavors of individuals that found a common ground to see one vision come to fruition.  The life of renowned architect Frank Lloyd Wright is one example of a man that not only had a vision that first came from his individual ideas but became influenced and inspired by what he experienced from other architects and creations.  The documentary Magnificent Obsession:  Frank Lloyd Wrights Buildings and Legacy in Japan centers on the life of Frank Lloyd Wright and how he arrived in Japan in 1905 as well his architectural designs built within the Japanese landscape beginning in 1913 and the influences reverberated decades later in the United States in the modern buildings and homes that he designed.

Frank Lloyd Wright and many architects of the late nineteenth century became fascinated with Japanese artistry through woodblock prints and Ukiyo-e as a result of expositions and fairs that not only exposed the arts but Japanese architecture such as at the Chicago Exposition that included a reconstruction of a Japanese Pavilion.  But it was Wrights visit to Japan in 1903 that finally inspired and sparked his interest in the countrys architecture that shared similar qualities to the designs shown in his Prairie homes.  From that point on Wright infused that inspiration into his designs and work where he traveled off and on for over a decade to Japan with the design and building of one of his most monumental buildings the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo.  With collaborative efforts from his architects at Taliesin and Japan, especially Japanese architects Aisaka Hayashi and Wright enthusiast and kindred spirit Arata Endo 48th Samurai, Wrights stamp of design in the country was now in place.  He would go on to design various homes and a new American embassy about the same time as the Imperial Hotel.  For the curious, what did Wright have in his design of buildings that others may not have during the turn of the century?  He set aside the Victorian designs and completely immersed his ideas and the appearance and structure of his buildings and homes within a natural setting, aesthetic interests, and materials closely aligned with nature.  Emulating images in the woodblock prints that he so embraced, his designs showed nature at the forefront  hug the earth, geometrical shapes and low designs, and integrate the exterior and interior; this was represented in Wrights approach to organic designs that meshed unity and harmony and philosophical interpretations.

Beyond the history of Frank Lloyd Wrights experience in Japan, the documentary contains much detail of other key contributors to Japans modern buildings after the Meiji era.  With the beautiful soundtrack that backs the visual images of photographs, drawings, paintings, and film footage of the time period and a small portion of re-enactments, the DVD is visually interesting; one minor note, it may have been useful to have captions under the names of particular individuals that were not interviewed in the documentary and under the photographs of historic buildings that no longer exist.  After watching this enormously informative documentary viewers may entice their interests in the artistry of Frank Lloyd Wrights architectural designs or delve much deeper into the culture, history, and landscape of Japan.",1385251200,,3375,5.2011070110701105

8209247,2,B000TGKW44,"I'm sure I'm as much of a Wright aficianado as anyone else here else we wouldn't have purchased this DVD. Therefore I can *not* understand all of these 4 & 5 star ratings. Yes the in-depth stories were interesting enough , but the material gathered would've been far more appropriate for a paperback book with photos and *not* a full blown DVD at $26. This production apes the Ken Burns style of hostoric storytelling without the quality in writing or casting of voiceover and the production looks little more than a college-level video term paper at best. (  I mistakenly gave it 2 stars and when I tried to correct my rating to 1 star Amazon's Edit page didn;t offer that option )
  My main point should be *obvious*. One of the core value-added feature of *any* DVD on archiotecture is full use of the *visual* medium itself and there is *nothing* in the way of *digital video* shot of the actual remaining structure of this most beautiful work of architecture , as it stands totally accessible *today*,  which was mercifully saved from the deconstruction in 1968 and lovingly reassembled in a park in  Nagoya, Japan.
  Any authoritative production short of delivering a living walk-through tour hardly deserves production on aDVD and certainly *not* at the cost of $26. So , by all means, save your money and walk away from this piece of sub-standard production. Whom among any group of FLlWright lovers would argue that what made Ken Burns' *Frank Lloyd Wright* DVD such aquality DVD to own was in no small part due to the sumptuous video shoots actually *experiencing* the Wright structures themselves. Obviously there wasn't enouhg money in Ken Burns' budget covering *all* of Wright's work & life to send a crew to Nagoya , Japan. However you'd think a DVD devoted *exclusively* to the Imperial Hotel would've addresseded this gap or what's the point of a DVD.
  Bottomline: Short of that *no* DVD on this subject is worth a damn *without* such a living tour using the medium to its fullest ( I guess that would mean HD on BlueRay at this late date) . I mean you can get a taste of this in the form of an amateur's video tour on YouTube for crying out loud.
  So save your money for when someone actually does. Who among us Wright officianados wouldn't buy such a DVD even if it was a Japanese production *without subtitles* , but offered a translation as an accompanying booklet ( which the material of this DVD could serve as) . Knowing the reverence that Japanese culture has for living works of art right down to the subtlest detail *that* would be *the* loving view documentary that the Imperial Hotel deserves. Anything less is not worth preserving in the DVD medium. Case closed!",1233878400,8,2694,4.674418604651163
8209248,5,B000TGKW44,"Frank Lloyd Wright's Imperial Hotel in Tokyo (completed 1923) is world famous, but few are aware of just how much time he spent in Japan, how pivotal that hotel was in his career (indeed his relationship with Japan), the other buildings he designed for Japan, or the lasting influence he had on the many Japanese architects who studied under him and worked with him.

Unlike bleak buildings of concrete slabs (modern Japanese public schools leap to mind) and the monolithic towers of cities today, Wright's organic designs emphasize the unity between man and nature. His buildings are scaled to be comfortable places for people and are built of local materials, looking as if they grew out of their surroundings.

But this documentary isn't just about buildings.  It is about the people who became Wright's students, colleagues, and friends, who carried the concepts of organic architecture forward in Japan.

Arata Endo was one of the Japanese architects who studied Wright's philosophy. This helped him to build his ideal view of organic architecture: ""to find a point where humans and architecture meet, to make architecture the art based on everyday lives, and not to classify architecture into practicality, science or art.""

The works of Wright in Japan, and the relationships he developed are meticulously laid out in this film with photographs, film clips, and perhaps most importantly interviews with architects, historians and others who were part of this chapter in history.  Though it is a very detailed documentary with much information to impart to the viewer, it is logically organized and the art and music used throughout the film make it a joy to watch.

Magnificent Obsession is an important film as it fleshes out a little covered, yet crucially important dimension to the story of his work.  It is a must see for anyone wanting a full understanding of Frank Lloyd Wright, organic architecture, and the legacy he left on both sides of the Pacific Ocean.",1210464000,,1973,5.049230769230769
8209249,4,B000TGKW44,"In past publications,Mr. Wright's experience in Japan has been difficult to track and has remained mostly mysterious. This cd remedies this. Thorough and well researched,it is an excellent addition to the collection of the serious Wright fan.
 The footage and documentation about building the magnificent Imperial Hotel is extensive and it clearly shows how Wright set up his studio in Japan and who worked with him there. I was fascinated to find that many students and architects who assisted Mr. Wright during his time there were deeply affected by his design philosophy and have continued his explorations in their own work. I was also excited to hear about and see images of the numerous commissions he created while there of which I was not aware.
 I would have liked to see more photos or film footage of Wright during his stay. Wright and Mamah Bortwick visited there and while this visit is mentioned there are no photos to support it. Considering the renewed  academic interest in Mamah and her inspiration and support of Wright I would have hoped some new documentation could have been flushed out of Japans' Wright archives.
I learned a great deal and would definitely recommend this to individuals who wish to learn more about this excellent and endlessly fascinating architect.",1204416000,4,1291,5.0233644859813085
