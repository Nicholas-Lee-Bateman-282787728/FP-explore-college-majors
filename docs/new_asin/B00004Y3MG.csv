7926494,5,B00004Y3MG,"I love the Jack Reed series of movies. As a former priest operating in the corrupt atmosphere of Chicago's machine politics, Reed is a fascinating character.

He is witty, smart and uncorruptible.

There is a great quote about Reed in this movie as Reed confronts a killer, played by William Sadler. Sadler. Sadler is talking about the person he always wanted to be, from the time he was a kid, Alexander the Great. He asks Reed who he wanted to be like more than anyone else in the world as a kid. Reed replies, ""St. Francis of Assissi.""

That is a role model that I'll bet no other fictional tough-guy detective has in any other movie, unless he is an actual priest.

Brian Dennehy played Sergeant Jack Reed in this film, and in five other films. Dennehy is excellent in this role.

These six films are hard to find. I could not find a region one DVD of this, so I bought this one in PAL format. These films are hard to find, but worth the effort. I think these are all made-for-TV movies, which may be part of the reason they are so hard to find.",1359244800,,1049,4.304568527918781
