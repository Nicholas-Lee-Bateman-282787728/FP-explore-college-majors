7735110,5,B01EHDSTIU,"This show is hilarious if you're into 1) Fantasy football, 2) Raunchy, 'bro' humor, and 3) Shock value. The comedy style is that of throwing a ton of over-the-top jokes at the wall and seeing what sticks. Even though some really miss the mark, I find myself laughing out loud at least once each episode. The real allure of this show is the back and forth jabs the characters take at each other. Sometimes they are downright ruthless. Even though the show goes of the rails at times, it's still worth watching due to those random hilarious moments. Kevin, Rafi and Ruxin are by far my favorite characters. Andre can be a pretty good punching bag too.

If you like football (especially the fantasy variety!) and immature, raunchy humor like me...you'll love ""The League"".",1473984000,3,769,4.7388059701492535
7735111,5,B01EHDSTIU,"One of the best comedies of recent. You don't have to like fantasy football, or even like football for that matter, to enjoy the show. I never watch or play either, and absolutely LOVED the entire series. Some of the best comedic writing and acting on television. The show will be severely missed.",1473984000,7,297,4.622641509433962
7735112,5,B01EHDSTIU,"If you know someone that is into fantasy football and has a sense of humor, they will LOVE this.  Its all based around a fantasy football league that all the main characters are in.  There are numerous cameos of current and former NFL stars as well.  The humor can be a bit raunchy but I think its hilarious....",1473984000,2,311,4.327586206896552
7735113,4,B01EHDSTIU,Excellent set including all seasons of this hilarious show.  You don't have to like football of fantasy football to enjoy this hilarious show.  I wished they put this out on Blu-ray but it is what it is.  There are some seasons that they did put out on Blu-ray for those who are looking.  And don't let Stephen Rannazzisi's incident about 9 11 stop you from watching the show either.,1467417600,2,383,4.507246376811594

I was already a fan of Nick Kroll and had seen the commercials for this show but never managed to watch an episode until it was no longer on the air.

The packaging of the boxed set is not fancy, but, is more than adequate to store the DVDs. This is a very funny show with some outrageous characters. If you're even mildly interested in fantasy football, or even if you're not, this is a wildly entertaining television series. Not a must-have series, but, you won't regret getting it, if you do.",1534636800,,505,4.326315789473684
