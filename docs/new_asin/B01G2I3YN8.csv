8762145,3,B01G2I3YN8,"Highlight of ST. CLAIR's BLOODY HORROR COLLECTION very well may be Dario Argento's ""Profondo rosso,"" a sanguinary exercise also known as ""The Hatchet Murders."" Others here include a vintage Euro-bloodbath written by and starring Paul Naschy, plus one featuring Patrick O'Neal and John Carradine, and similar frightmares.

ST. CLAIR DVD multi-packs are reasonably priced, and offer fine quality video/audio transfers of unrestored public domain material. Discs are single-side recorded, plastic storage cases fairly sturdy, movie liner notes appear on box's back cover and most DVDs include bonus items, such as movie trailers, bios and poster galleries.

It features the goreish ""Bloody Pit of Horror,"" ""The Devil's Nightmare,"" ""Sisters of Death,"" ""The Vampire's Niece"" and more!
