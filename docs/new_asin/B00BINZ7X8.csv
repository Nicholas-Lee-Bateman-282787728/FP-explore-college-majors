8569064,5,B00BINZ7X8,"A film by the Italian RAI.TV in Italian with English subtitles. I was interested in Perlasca when I watched an old TV (Italian RAI.TV) interview from the 80's. I ordered this film on Amazon from OxfordshireEngland (a UK vendor/Amazon) at a reasonable price ($14.31 USD) and it took a couple of weeks to arrive to the USA. The DVD is from Region 2, it won't play on my DVD player, but it does on the VLC player and/or the Power Media Player (PC's). It can be converted to another format if you have the right program. Schindler is more famous because of Steven Spielberg's film, but Perlasca saved even more Jews. His remarkable story was not known until 1987. The sound is a tiny bit off due to the Region 2, but it does not interfere that much. I liked it very much. You can watch it on Amazon.com if you have a Prime Membership. The Prime Membership is one of the best deals on the WWW, if you don't have one - get it. Either way you win with Amazon by ordering it or watching it online.",1471219200,,989,4.26595744680851
