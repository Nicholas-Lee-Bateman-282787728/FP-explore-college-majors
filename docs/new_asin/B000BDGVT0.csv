2414347,4,B000BDGVT0,"I saw this movie when it was at the theater. Being well acquainted with the life of St Therese made me realize the liberties which the film makers took in the film and how fluffy they made her seem, yet when the movie was over, I was glad that I had seen it. It is an uplifting movie, a movie that makes you question what you hold as valuable. There are funny scenes and sad scenes, but the theme that runs throughout is joy. The movie was not as deep as I expected, and if you have more than an introductory knowledge of her life you will be disappointed, but as a summary of her life it works. I would recommend it to those who desire to have a glimpse of her personality, freed of all of the false Jansenistic overtones some movies give her, but do not take it as a completely accurate interpretation of the woman.",1136851200,71,817,4.177215189873418

I really could not get a true feeling for the characters. It seemed as though the movie skipped much too quickly from one scene to another and that some of the scenes were unimportant, thus leaving out scenes that would have added more to the understanding of Therese.

2414368,3,B000BDGVT0,"I am middle-of-the-road on this movie. I love St. Therese very much and I know she loves me. :-) One thing that does come to mind, and has for years, is that the director or producer said years ago that they did have an actress for the part of Therese who was an exact double of her in appearance, but decided to go with Ms. Younce who is prettier, to draw more moviegoers (I am sure that they also chose Ms. Younce because she can act and did so). That has been unsettling to me, as I have really been curious as to whom this other actress is and how she took that comment...and what she looks like! I wonder how the movie would have been with her in it. Yet, St. Therese is in Heaven with her perfect humility and I feel that this other actress is being humble and gracious wherever she is. Yet still I feel curious! The music is absolutely beautiful and was composed by an actual Carmelite nun. What I do get from this movie is the love that existed between St. Therese and her family...between her and her father (which to me is an excellent foundation for the love that our Heavenly Father has for us). She brings her experiences and love of Our Lord to Carmel, ready to give EVERYTHING to Jesus.",1445817600,,1201,4.248908296943231

2414396,5,B000BDGVT0,"Thrse is a feature film that tells the story of Thrse de Lisieux's life and work. It tells the story of a young girl who fell in love with Jesus Christ and demonstrated a path of spirituality through the actions of unconditional love, human compassion, and her ""Little Way"" to the modern world.

Thrse Martin was born in 1873 to a working-class family in France. When she was only four years old, her mother died, sending the child into a cycle of depression. At 14, she experienced a spiritual epiphany and decided to devote her life to God as decided to become a Carmelite nun, and when she was told she was too young, she traveled to the Vatican and personally appealed to the Pope to allow her to join the order. Entering the monastery at a time when winds of intellectual and spiritual change were sweeping the world, Thrse came to see the simple but sublime life of the nuns as an inspired path to spiritual contentment, and she wrote a powerful book about her religious awakening, The Story of a Soul. Published a year after her tragic death in 1897, Thrse's autobiography gained widespread acclaim, and the girl known as ""the Little Flower"" was canonized as a saint in 1925.

This is an inspiring true story is told through simple narrative which invites the audience to self-introspection. Also,it allows them to apply such spirituality in their own modern lives.",1417824000,,1372,4.6887966804979255

2414408,5,B000BDGVT0,"I love this movie.  Several people have disagreed, but such is the critique of art.  Everyone sees things from their own perspective.  I believe it shows much of what was in the heart of St. Therese.  It shows her deep love for God, and how she never lost her love of her family.  It displays how she had to come to terms with a love of God that would separate her from family and the life she had always known at a very early age.  It also shows how once she made the decision to follow God how she was enveloped in a great serenity, and lived perpetually in love.  What I liked was in little snippets of the movie you will see Therese's ""Little Way"" very well exemplified.  I like it because it shows this theology of hers through her actions, and it doesn't draw a tone of attention to the situations that exemplify this aspect of her; if you have read about Therese this is how she, I believe, would have wanted her ""Little Way"" displayed.  Over all a deeply enriching movie, for me at least, and also I believe a wonderful movie for anyone discerning a spiritual vocation.  You may like it and you may not, but it is definitely worth the time for you to decide for yourself.",1412294400,7,1179,4.27027027027027

her own bad temper and feelings of self-importance, and she had to deal with not only the loss of her mother at an early age, but also her father's descent into madnessl--I was hoping to find a more accurate depiction of the struggles of this all too human being.

2414442,5,B000BDGVT0,"A beautiful film on St. Therese of Lisieux, a 19th century French bourgeois girl who became world-famous through her autobiography after dying young of TB in a convent. As an independently produced Catholic indie, it is primarily hampered by a so-so lead performance by amateur actress Lindsey Younce, whose stilted delivery evokes high school theater. Early scenes of family interactions follow ""The Story of a Soul"" (autobiography) pretty closely, but the inexperienced Younce is so unexpressive/wooden and petulant that some of these moments are painful to watch. Nevertheless, the mysterious source of strength in Therese's short life -- a cheerful joy for life rooted in faith despite her many sufferings -- emerges gradually as she loses her mother to an early death, her father to mental illness, and finally her own life to illness.

If nothing else, Younce plays her deathbed scenes with heartfelt depth, making up a bit for the lack of gravitas throughout the rest of the film. In the final illness scenes, it feels like we're watching St. Therese rather than Younce, saving the performance. There are other highlights. Director Leonardo DeFilippis achieves a rich cinematic look augmented by a beautiful film score that helps carry us through the inconsistency of Younce's frequent church-pageant acting flourishes. He also plays Louis Martin, Therese's father, with a studied sensitivity and warmth that is a highlight of the film.

Overall, the film is superior to Alain Cavalier's celebrated ""Therese"" (a 1986 French winner at the Cannes Film Festival) inasmuch as it gives a more straightforward narrative of this woman's life. Cavalier's film has greater depth, a better lead actress, and a more beautifully subtle treatment of the source material -- but its European minimalism, vignette-driven narrative, long periods of silence, uncomfortable religious sexuality, agnostic distance, and lack of context may puzzle some viewers who may desire a more straightforward treatment of Therese's life. This newer film, while inferior in artistry and acting to that of Cavalier, is better for narrative coherence and may be more appealing for English audiences since it lacks subtitles. It is suitable for family or church viewing and appears intended for that audience. Unlikely to appeal to non-believers, it is nevertheless calculated to be uplifting for believers, and I for one have come to appreciate it from that perspective. It may also be preferable for American audiences and younger viewers who find the French minimalism of Cavalier's film bewildering. The Little Flower still awaits a truly powerful cinematic treatment, but this film is probably the best of the bunch for now. Incidentally, Amazon needs to correct the date on this product listing: This ""Therese"" came out in 2004, not in 1986 as it says on this page. It seems someone at Amazon confused the date for this ""Therese"" with the Cavalier ""Therese"" of 1986.",1381622400,,2943,5.286324786324786
2414443,5,B000BDGVT0,"Last week I finished reading The Story Of A Soul, which is the autobiography that was written by St. Therese of Lisieux O.C.D. I read the 3rd edition that was translated from the original manuscripts by John Clarke O.C.D. and published by ICS publications.

And as I was reading her autobiography, time and time again, I kept coming across events in the book that I remembered seeing in this DVD movie, which was a very pleasant confirmation to the authenticity of the visual presentation of this movie about the life of Saint Therese.

Therefore, I highly recommend this movie.

I only wished the film makers would have made the film longer by presenting more events that took place in the life St. Therese after she entered Carmel.

I purchased this DVD on Amazon and was quite happy with my purchase. Well, that is, I was happy with my purchase after Amazon sent me a replacement DVD since the first one they sent me would not play.",1379203200,,935,4.614457831325301

2414461,3,B000BDGVT0,"Therese was a 15-year-old French girl who entered the convent and died in her 20's from TB.  She became a saint after she wrote a journal about her life, her calling as a nun, and how she found God.  These journals were published initially for novices (nuns) and then the general public, and became immensely popular for her ""little ways"" to serve God, something people thought was a valuable insight on how an ordinary person could become more Godly.  The book [The Story of a Soul] is still widely sold today and worth reading, and the monastery where she died is the number two location in France for religious tourists.
The movie, however, concentrates on her upper-class childhood with servants and a doting father.  The father has a lot of screen-time and I didn't think it was important. I wanted a lot more of the film devoted to Therese's ""little ways.""  The aspect of her actually writing her famous book as she lay dying of TB was glossed over in the film with a few quick shots of her writing in a journal, and I think some people watching the movie would not realize that the book she wrote was her major contribution to this world.  I waited for the scene where she gets the old, ugly, broken water pitcher and tries to love it because it also serves God's purpose - and it wasn't there.  So most of her book's message was skipped.  The agony of her dying lasted over-long, and was so immensely sad I don't think I'd ever watch the DVD again.
Pluses - The film is in English, the actress playing Therese has a really sweet smile, and the costumes are wonderful.  Being a fan of her book, I guess I had to watch the film at least once.",1312416000,5,1648,4.412541254125412
2414462,1,B000BDGVT0,"Like many here I was very excited to watch this film and sat down with two of my children, girls ages 7 & 10. This truly is an abysmal movie please don't waste your money and time. Many say the acting was not much better than a high school production, I say much worse! I have been to a number of excellent High school productions recently and this movie was not in the ballpark. There was no character development of any kind and definitely no examination or understanding of the interior life of St. Therese. Her family life consisted of all the sisters exclaiming ""Yes, dearest papa!"" constantly and you could see the actresses thinking ""I must walk around in a saintly way."" My children were dumbfounded and said they didn't seem normal or like a real family - sadly true. The portrayal in this film is of a girl and family saintly from the womb. Why they bothered going to the convent and weren't just assumed into heaven asap is one of the many mysteries of this production. I feel that St. Therese is made simpering and clueless, all her great humanity and passion is missing. There is no depth of understanding of the spiritual life at all and Therese is reduced to a cardboard cut-out. Definitely not an evangelistic tool, as it makes Catholics look like we all have lobotomies.",1298332800,9,1287,4.551724137931035

2414464,3,B000BDGVT0,"I don't want to be too hard on those involved in the making of ""Therese"".  While I recognize that the Church has no shortage of internal enemies, since and as a result of Vatican II, I disagree with those who theorize that the film was produced by wolves in sheep's clothing.  I believe, rather, that the people involved had their hearts in the right place.  And, indeed, the film is anything but execrable.  It is, however, superficial, inept, and misses the mark completely.  Therese of Lisieux is an extraordinary saint, as well as a Doctor of the Church.  Both she and the faithful deserve considerably more than this movie offers.

In addition to the film just not capturing the essence and importance of St. Therese, the acting left a great deal to be desired.  The young actresses (Lindsay Younce in particular) have charm and are appropriately, if somewhat awkwardly, earnest.  Still, the amateurishness is palpable; I had the impression that I was watching a high school production put on by reasonably talented seniors.

There was one scene that I found jarring.  When the young nuns put on a play, they shed their habits for costumes.  Fair enough.  But they all have long hair.  It should have been made clear that they were wearing wigs; a young lady's hair is cut short once she enters a religious order.  This was true in St. Therese's time.  It remains true in our own, assuming that we're referencing a traditional community, such as the Carmelites of Colorado Springs, and not a post-conciliar one (dying out, thank God) where the women dress like 1950s prison matrons.

Still, the movie is wholesome, and I reservedly recommend it.

FYI:  According to the traditional calendar (I pay no attention to the ""reformed"" one), St. Therese's feast day is October 3.  She's always well worth praying to, but especially on that day.",1294444800,,1842,4.824281150159744
2414465,5,B000BDGVT0,"A wonderful movie. Lindsay Younce is a very good
actor and it is like Theres by herself play in
the movie. She said in an interview:""I felt like Theres
stand beside me when I act.""
Very identic places, a wonderful soundtrack and the
movie shows the whole live of the little Queen.
her parents and sisters were play by very good actors, too.
The scene when she died shows how she looked good in
the last minutes of her live and she died with a smiling
on her lips. And the illness was a very hurt one, it was
Tubercolose. One of the best movies I ever did see.
5 Stars for this authentic movie.

2414468,2,B000BDGVT0,"I do not own the movie; I rented it from my local Blockbuster Video store last year.  This film of Saint Therese of Lisieux from her childhood to her death at 24 from tuberculosis is a bore, which is something I don't like saying about any film of this genre.  Why must saint movies be done with so little character conflict in the storylines that they risk putting both Catholics and non-Catholics to sleep? I have some knowledge of this particular saint's life and, like Saint Bernadette Soubirous of Lourdes, Therese Martin of Lisieux was not a bland individual.  Look at the photo taken of her just before she entered the Carmelite order at age 15.  Her vibrant personality leaps out at you and it continues to do so in a later photo of her where she's wearing her habit.  Unfortunately, I agree with those who reviewed the acting in this film; the performances are yawn producing.  Even the scene where Therese's widower father Leonard happily shouts to her, ""My queen, I caught a fish!"" only made me shrug and think, ""So you caught a fish.  Big deal.""  The saving grace of the film are the production values, as the sets and costumes are flawless.  I just wish the script had been able to match that flawlessness.",1235692800,3,1219,4.580645161290323

2414477,1,B000BDGVT0,"For anyone who has read The Story of a Soul, Therese's letters, or any of the well-done biographies about her and her family members--this movie is going to be a massive disappointment.  Biographically, it is grossly inaccurate which in turn distorts beyond recognition the spirituality of Therese's ""Little Way.""  For example, in the movie the adult actress plays scenes that ought to have been done by a child actress.  Therese was overly scrupulous as a little girl (until age 13 or so).  To have an adult Therese whimpering about having eaten too much cake (and worrying if she's therefore a glutton) makes her seem absurd.  Another scene, once she's a nun, in the washroom where another nun repeatedly splashes water in Therese's face is the opposite of what happened in reality.  In the movie, Therese grits her teeth, tries to overcome her irritation, and ends by giggling sheepishly and splashing the other nun back.  Gag.

What the real Therese tried to do was offer up lovingly and cheerfully the minor irritations (and at times major suffering) caused by her fellow nuns. In her autobiography, she describes how difficult it was for her to put up with being splashed inadvertently by a zealous nun who washed the laundry next to her.  Therese did not splash her back.  She did not draw attention to the incident.  She silently battled her irritation, ignored the splashing, and did not in any exterior way let the other nun know she was bothered. At the same time, interiorly, she did her best to focus on loving God and her fellow nun. She tried to keep herself from getting absorbed by her feelings of irritation.  One of the hallmarks of Therese's ""Little Way"" is that she sought to deal with the little, petty incidents of daily life with charity, humility, and cheerfulness, regardless of her feelings and personal preferences.  As others have mentioned, this movie is indeed poorly shot and poorly acted but those are minor faults considering the biographical and spiritual substance of this movie depicts what is essentially an Anti-Therese.",1190851200,120,2059,4.933333333333334

2414480,5,B000BDGVT0,"This film was as true to the Saint as possible without being theological and going on and on in a ponderous way, which wasn't what Therese was about. The music was composed by a Carmelite Nun, given special permission to leave the convent for a week and her father directed the orchestra. The Canticle of Love is exquisite and I bought the CD just to listen to it.  The acting was excellent, but yes it was a little stilted, but then have you ever been around nuns or holy people, they are very ofter formal and quite conservative in their behavoir and in their affections. Especially those in contemplative orders. They live so much on the interior.  They are warm and loving buy highly disciplined, as was her family. And in their interactions, I doubt seriously if they were ever overly familar or disrespectful, but quite the opposite, overly respectful and very sweet and loving and respectful of each others privacy. Thus you have a film that modern society thinks impossible, but I think it's quite possible that people behaved that way, high souls are quite capable of loving sweetness and great discipline of character and action. I loved the music, the beauty and the acting, expecially of the father. I found this movie inspirational and dear and I would imagine it would be very hard to do more, since the major part of her life was spent inside with God and Jesus, and how can you access ecstacy, and how can you portray, bliss and interior joy. It's not possible for a human unless they have experienced it themselves, and who but Saints have done this?So, I think they did a beautiful job.",1185235200,9,1604,4.644366197183099

And everyone who knew her is transformed by knowing her.

After the events of the film, the diary becomes a best seller, and the girl is canonized in 1925. I cannot imagine a better way to put this story on film than the way this company and cast have done it.

I was so shocked as scene after disappointing scene unfolded.  The music was beautiful but became monotonous after a while, as it never changed ambiance.  The costumes deserve great credit but the acting in most part, especially the scenes inside the monastery, were clumsy and childishly scripted.  The acting was stilted and forced.  It seems that no attempt was made to really understand Carmelite comportment and behaviour.  The scenes of scorn from the nuns, the ungainly gestures and the ludicrous 'dance' into the refectory were totally uncharacteristic of instinctive religious behaviour.  The nuns also appeared to 'stride' around, as can be seen in the garden scene.  There is not one single scene of St. Thesea attending Mass, or any beautiful shots inside a church, or Cathedral, etc.  These things are all very important.

An over exaggeration has been applied to the concept of French family affections.  The eight year old ill Therese was played by a grown girl, which looked rediculous, especially with full length shots of her writhing around in her sick bed in a very unladylike manner!

Stay on the safe side and buy the older movies on St. Theresa!",1173484800,24,1425,4.957805907172996
2414485,3,B000BDGVT0,"`The'r'ese' embellishes well its subject matter.  Beloved by many, the saint is framed in a film that captures beauty fitting for ""The Little Flower"".  There are many heartwarming moments throughout to nourish the soul.  Containing some elements of her autobiography, `A Story of a Soul,' but narrating less than the previous film from 1986, this `Therese' reinacts key scenes of her life more fully.  Wisely, the treatment is only occasionally langorous, and  is mostly well edited.  To accommodate a modern audience, they seldom dwell on any one scene too long.  The acting won't win prizes in the history of Catholic cinema, but with a few wooden moments, they wisely try not to over dramatize her story, even when exceptional developments come to ordinary lives.  There are even some surprising special effects in places that work well, especially without a blockbuster budget.  Nevertheless, with the drama accentuated by Sr. Marie Therese Sokol`s, OCD, beautiful score, they are playing for an old-fashioned movie appeal.  Directed by Leonardo Defilippis, whose performance as her father, Martin, is the best in the show, and the screenplay written by his wife, Patti, 'The'r'ese is an admirable effort.  The comraderie between the sisters is captured well enough, and progressively, the dramatic tension grows somewhat.  There are some cutesy scenes as well that almost reminded me of films like `The Trouble with Angels,' but it is hard to imagine a film about The'r'ese that could do without it.

Overall, `The'r'ese' is a good film about a Catholic saint that should be considered for mainstream consumption.  Whereas 1986's `The'r'ese' makes a good one-woman impersonation, like a stand-up narrative, this `The'r'ese' at least has the drama that was begging to be made.",1172448000,3,1780,5.26595744680851
2414486,2,B000BDGVT0,"...because I feel I'm being, in some way, sacrilegious but this film was a very poor attempt to portray an extraordinary person, at least in my life.  I am a Catholic and have been devout to the St. Therese of Lisieux for most of my adult life and I was really looking forward to this film.  Like many of the other reviewers, I have also seen the French film of the same title and found it a far more rewarding experience than this new production.  The movie plays out like a religious Anne of Green Gables, with a Hallmark film quality that manages to gloss over everything to the point of making every character come across as one-dimensional cut outs of piety and wholesomeness.  Having read Story of a Soul, I know that Therese was not a faultless divine creation, but rather a very human woman with an extraordinary devotion to, love for and faith in God.  Everyone is so saccharine sweet and perfect that it bordered on the sickening.  It just wasn't believable.  Even more so, using the same actress to portray Therese from the age of 14 to 24 was an insane idea (Lindsay Younce was 21 at the time of filming).  Not only do we not witness her spiritual growth but there is no sense of the passing of time. The acting is a bit pedestrian and the dialogue an exercise in stilted screenwriting, the music hockey and contrived, but the production values are high and the movie has beautiful look to it.  No doubt everyone's heart was in the right place but this is just not the kind of film that will really shed any light on Therese Martin, woman and Saint.",1170115200,56,1561,4.43006993006993

I have great love and respect for St. Therese of Lisieux because she was tender yet courageous, gentle yet determined, and most of all, holy in spite of intense personal trials. The movie revealed virtually none of this and made her appear superficial, almost to the point of silliness. I had really expected more depth and a more mature treatment of such a remarkable life.",1169164800,19,523,4.822222222222222
2414488,3,B000BDGVT0,"I gave this movie three stars because it was about Saint Therese, not because of the quality of filmmaking. I was very dissapointed in this film. The quality of acting was poor and sometimes the dialoge didn't makes sense. Also, and to me personally the most annoying aspect of this film, were the inaccuracies regarding monastic life. I mean, if someone is going to make a film where the main character spends the last eight years of her life in a monastery, you'd think they would become at least marginally familiar with monastic culture and customs. Also, the actress who played Saint Therese, and the actresses who played her sisters did not resemble the actual people. I couldn't understand why the director chose the same actress to play Saint Therese as a child and as an adult. The acting of Leonardo diFIllipis was so odd it detracted from the viewing experience. I think perhaps his style of acting is more appropriate for theater. In this film it is just comical. The historical innaccurices abound in this movie, and anyone who is familiar with the life of Saint Therese of Lisieux will notice them. Carmelite life is rigorous, and was even more so at the time when Therese was living. Where is the manual labor and silences?  Where is the affectionate, warm and pious family atmosphere of her childhood? Why was the portrayal of her last illness and death so romanticized? This woman suffered from a terrible illness, tuberculosis, and died horribly.  Where were ANY of the beautiful last conversations? Where were the community politics? To give credit where credit is due, I think that the filmmakers were trying to make a film that captured the spirit or spirituality of Saint THerese, rather than a strictly historical drama. However, they failed miserably. If they had succeeded they would have made a masterpiece. I think the best thing about this movie was the costume design and set design, which was pretty good. I'm still waiting for a great movie about Saint Therese, and I hope that it will be made some day; this not that movie.

There is so much known of this popular Saint already that expectations run high and consequently the film not satisfying for all.  I was pleased and appreciative that the film captured as much as it did of her short life, relationships with family and religious sisters and her rich spirituality and her heroic death.

It flows with the mood for each new scene and one can visualize the parts of the movie simply by listening to the music,written and performed by one of the Carmelite nuns. Secondly, the photography,scenery and sets are top notch realistic from the gorgeous French countryside to the grill inside the cloister.
Thirdly, while this is a short film, it gets the saint's life and mission portrayed concisely with the very human aspects highlighted, which so many times is neglected when the lives of the heroic virtuous are recorded. Yes, it leads one to ask more questions, such as: what are more of the details of her life at home and her life as a nun during her short life? What about the years that she was placed in charge of the novices? Was she really homeschooled and for how long? How did her father's health progress from a generous,charitable,wealthy yet simple man to one whose life ended with a mental disorder or dementia?

2414501,3,B000BDGVT0,"I was very eager to watch this film, as I find most films about saints to be extremely inspiring and compelling.

This is a simple film about a simple woman, Therese, who is a young French woman who finds an immediate connection with nature and people.  She uses her ""Little Way"" to perform small acts of compassion and kindness, even for those who are not grateful for the help she bestows.

The film is great in its simplicity, and it would have worked perfectly, it didn't come up a bit short.  At an hour and a half, the film is not nearly long enough for the viewer to truly grasp and appreciate the young Therese.  Nearly half of the film is spent on her childhood.  This isn't bad or wrong, but at an hour and a half, it doesn't leave enough time to really get into depth of her life, especially while she is at the monastery.

The film is made in the tradition of ""Song of Bernadette,"" which is still the best film made about a saint to this day, in my opinion.  The ""Song of Bernadette"" is also about two and a half hours long, giving the film-makers and the audience more than sufficient time to really fall in love with Bernadette.  This is what I was waiting for with this film, but it didn't happen.  At 25, Jennifer Jones was able to really bring out the simple, child-like qualities of Bernadette.

I'm also afraid that Lindsay Younce, while a good actress, just isn't able to wholly grasp the character of Therese.  I don't think it's necessarily her fault.  It's quite a task to act as a famous saint.  I still remember Ben Kingsley's statement when first offered the part of Gandhi ""I can't play Gandhi.  NO ONE can play him.  He's larger than life!""  And yet, he was able to tap into the essence of Gandhi.

There are some very sweet and tender moments in this film.  I love the relationship between Therese and the senior nun who tries her best to make Therese's life miserable.  When Therese smiles at her, the nun asks, ""Why do you smile?""  ""Because I'm so happy to see you,"" replies Therese who quickly disarms the nun with these sweet words of love.

I really feel that if Leonardo had stretched out his film for at least another hour, and really dug a little deeper, he would have had a masterpiece, without question.  It's beautifully photographed, and the relationships he shows between Therese and her father as well as with her sisters is wonderful to see.

Don't get me wrong, this is not a bad movie by any means.  It simply isn't enough.  I feel that Leonardo's attempt to make a simple film was admirable, but even simple films can run longer than an hour and a half!",1151625600,12,2600,4.409663865546219

I will buy more copies as gifts for friends who share my sense of humor and will enjoy this gentle roasting of St. Therese.  On the other hand, it brought the life of Therese to my attention.

2414504,1,B000BDGVT0,I have waited for this movie to be in released in DVD. This film did not do justice to St. Therese's life. If you really want to feel the miracles in St. Therese's life. It is better to read the book Story of a Soul by John Beevers.,1148428800,11,232,3.8541666666666665
2414505,5,B000BDGVT0,"I myself did not know much about St. Therese before this movie.  I do not claim to know a lot now ... but, through this film, I have been intrigued enough to want to learn more.

There are those who say that it is impossible to condense ""The Story of a Soul"" into a movie.  This is very true.  But, let's think about that statement for a moment.  Is it even possible to condense a life into a book?  To have the WHOLE story one would have to write every day's activities (the entire day) into a journal.  The book would be at least 365 pages long for every year of a person's life.  I say even ""The Story of a Soul"" cannot (technically) cover all of St. Therese's beautiful life.

That being said, why not start with a brief introduction?  Of course, the movie is never as detailed or as intimate as the book, the book is never as detailed or as intamate as the life!

If you are the type of person who studies your faith, yet you have areas other than St. Therese you prefer to study at this time, why not a brief introduction through this movie?  It is great for the whole family.  Regardless of what anyone says this movie makes you stop and think.

Some inacturate reviews state the cinematography is lousy and the acting worse.  Because of these ""ugly"" reviews I expected my DVD of Therese to be cheap movie making. I was shocked that anyone could say such ugly things about a movie that was so beautifully shot.  The cinematography is well shot. The acting is excellent. The settings are beautiful.

Don't hesitate! The fruit of this movie is inspiration, and isn't that what St. Therese herself would want - to inspire you?",1146528000,8,1630,4.362126245847176
2414506,5,B000BDGVT0,"It is not reasonable to compress the ""Story of a Soul"" into a movie, there is too much material there.  This film does accomplish the goal, however, of bringing to life one of the most beloved saints (and doctor) of the Catholic Church.

It is a little saccharine, but then, so are parts of her book.  After all, her ""little way"" was about treating everyone at all times with love.  In our jaded day, *that* is saccharine.

But it is also a formula for holiness.

That is what this movie is about.  It is more than a film about a simple girl who became a young lady, a nun, then died a painful and premature death.  It is really about how this simple girl, in a nearly anonymous little French town, became one of the most important people in the history of the Church.  And she did not even know it while she walked this Earth.

If you are enjoy action flicks and like to see the Arnold Schwarzenegger shoot up the bad guys, you will be disappointed.  If you are looking for simple, light, and mindless entertainment, you will be equally disappointed.  If you want something that will make you think, that will inspire, that will influence your thoughts, words and deeds, this is the move for you.",1146182400,10,1197,4.415525114155251
2414507,4,B000BDGVT0,"THERESE is a contemporary retelling of the life of St. Therese of Liseux. The film tells the basic story of her life and quotes from her writings are used to narrate the story. The story is told from a reverential and pious perspective which for some films gives an unrealistic quality, but for THERESE, it's actually helpful. The viewer connects with the saint's life and witness. In some ways it has some of the same strengths of the St. Francis of Assisi biopic BROTHER SUN, SISTER MOON but on a lesser scale than that of producer Franco Zefferelli.

Perhaps what sold me most on this film was not the film itself, but the story behind the film which is an additional feature to the DVD. For everyone involved, the production was a labor of love. It was obviously a small studio with a limited budget, yet the scenery was lush, the acting sincere, and the musical score helped the film flow. The purpose was to tell the saint's story in a memorable way and this the team accomplished rather well.

My guess is that this film will be viewed primarily by people interested in Catholic spirituality or in a religious educational setting. Either would be a perfect use for the film. We get a glimpse of Therese's struggles and successes. We see her mature form a child who is at times overly curious about religion to a woman of deep faith. She also teaches us, to paraphrase from a modern expression and book title, not to sweat the small stuff and how not sweating the small stuff can actually lead to holiness. It would be perfect to be viewed by a large group with the possibility of discussion afterward.",1146009600,25,1608,4.560553633217993
2414508,5,B000BDGVT0,"Such are the words that St. Therese of Liseux utters as she lies on her death bed in the final minutes of the movie. The incredible story of one of the world's most beloved modern-day saints is something that cannot quite be conveyed in its entirety in just a 96-minute film, but the direction this movie takes is immediately evident when you begin watching.

From the film's opening moments, where a very young Therese says ""Oh Mama, how I wish you would die, because I want you to go to Heaven,"" to the painful recognition of human suffering in the climatic final scene, we are introduced to a young girl who just may have had more to her than most people come to believe. As human beings, we tend to view the saints as strong, credible, and virtually flawless souls that we could never hope to emulate.

And it is a shame that so many of us tend to feel that way, because the saints were not perfect. In fact, some of the very best of them became saints through the human mistakes they overcame, not the sins they avoided.

With this phenomenal gem of a film, the viewer gets to witness an amazing sense of hope in seeing the story of a girl who was certainly not perfect and was even a normal human person. From the tiny 5-year-old child who kept the death of her mother bottled up inside to the dramatic girl who dreaded school, and from the immature, needy teenager to the loving and selfless young adult she came to be, St. Therese clearly experienced a significant metamorphosis in her life. She was born to two devout Catholic parents that also happened to be very wealthy, and as the youngest of five girls she was about as pampered and spoiled as any ""baby of the family"" you might see today.

There are a lot of things about Therese that might surprise you. She was a child who loved dressing up in pretty outfits and enjoyed playing with her sisters. She was a kid who struggled to cope with the sneers of the ""popular"" girls in school and found joy in being at home, dancing and laughing with her family. She missed her mother greatly, pouted when her beloved oldest sister left home to become a Carmelite nun, and even had a nervous breakdown when she realized she couldn't deal with it all. She was a little girl who loved having dessert after dinner, picked flowers, and looked forward to the presents that ""Santa Claus"" stuffed in her shoes.

It is a breath of clean and pure fresh air to watch little Therese grow up, mature, and develop a strong and loving relationship with God. It is empowering to know that while she did grow into a woman who put others before herself and was constantly giving, she was not always that way. It is even more incredible to see her talk about and live out her ""Little Way,"" something that helped her recognize that while she was not perfect and could not do everything exactly as Jesus did, she could do her part by focusing on the little things with the utmost love and sacrifice.

This film definitely does leave a lot of information about Therese's world. The fact that her parents actually had 9 children and lost 4 during infancy is one part that is not discussed. There are also many tiny elements of Therese's incredible life that are left out, but then again I don't think they were looking to paint a complete portrait here. The makers of this film obviously worked very hard to make this an appealing story to contemporary audiences. Given the fact that the world we currently live in is nowhere near the same as it was when the saints lived, that must have been a very difficult thing to do, and it was obviously a tremendous success. They knew that they can reach people by bringing out the emotional, human side of this wonderful saint. You can walk away from this film feeling lighter, less stressed, and with the knowledge that maybe you really could make a difference. I enjoyed every minute of this movie and by the time it ended, I was inspired to see that we are ALL not only called to live better lives, but ENABLED to live better lives. Just because we're imperfect does not mean the Lord is not confident in our ability to do good things, and that's exactly what this film seeks to illustrate.",1145664000,20,4169,4.464566929133858
2414509,5,B000BDGVT0,"My husband and I took our 2 oldest children (5 and 6 at the time) to see this film on the day it opened in theaters. Although somewhat disappointed in the film's quality in the theater (seemed rather grainy), we were very pleased with this film as a whole. I believe it was rather fortunate that my children needed a visit to the restroom during the ""death scene"", for I (as the one who remained in the theater) found this scene very emotional. We left the theater anxious for the DVD release.

When the announcement arrived that the DVD could be pre-ordered for a Valentine's day release, I immediately ordered 4 copies: one for ourselves, and 3 others for family and dear friends. All who received the DVD (none had seen the film in the theater) were moved and inspired while viewing it.

When my husband and I sat down to enjoy the DVD presentation with all five of our children, the results were quite surprising. The 2, 4, and 5-year-olds were ""glued"" to the screen! Our oldest, who had missed the death scene in the theater and is now 8 1/2, ""went to pieces"" when Therese died! I myself, even knowing what was to come, found myself weeping as Therese went to be with the God she loved with every fiber of her being!

I found the actors to be very ""natural"" in their portrayals of the Saint, her family, and the many religious she encountered throughout her short life. This is what made this film so refreshing: it's simplicity allows one to ""think beyond the film"" and allow the Holy Spirit and the imagination to run wild!

And considering that Luke Films does not have the financial resources of a Mel Gibson, they produced a beautifully inspiring film for the entire family to enjoy that was heartily endorced by the Vatican and our beloved Pope John Paul II!! There can be no better earthly endorcement than this!

I recommend this film to everyone. Since television and movies are the farthest reaching media in today's world, doesn't it make sense that we should promote more ""heart and soul-healthy"" films such as this one? Luke Films has given the ""Little Flower"", St. Therese, yet another opportunity to reach out to even more souls by ""spending my heaven doing good on earth!""",1145577600,12,2193,4.59846547314578
2414510,3,B000BDGVT0,"I was very excited to see this film in the video store, but on the whole was quite disappointed with it. Comparing it to the actual life and writings of St. Therese is like comparing one of the saccharine pictures of her to an actual photograph. Nice - maybe inspiring, but superficial and insipid when placed next to the real thing.

One of the big mistakes I think the makers of the film made, unless their goal was an introductory hagiography, was to attempt to portray Therese's entire life, at least beginning shortly before her mother's death. Even a relatively uneventful 15-20 years cannot be covered in any depth in an hour and a half. Also, even though she has a few crying spells, she is still shown as an almost perfect human being right from the beginning, so I didn't really get a sense of her spiritual struggle and growth. In addition, the passivity with with she is portrayed almost completely dilutes the power of her ""little way.""  I believe that the French film mentioned by one of the other reviewers concentrated on the period of her illness and death, and was able to show her life and personality in much more depth.

A couple of things that could have been brought out or portrayed even in this version: the fact that Therese was made Mistress of Novices, entrusted with the spiritual direction of women who were sometimes older than herself; her relationship with the saintly old Mother Superior who died during her time at Carmel; and more than a glancing reference to the writing of the manuscripts that were published as _The Story of a Soul_.

However, if this movie inspires people to go out and read Therese's writing (I also recommend the biography _The Story of a Life_ by Msgr. Guy Gaucher, which is where I first encountered her), I suppose it will have fulfilled its purpose.",1145491200,106,1812,4.653125

This movie will encourage anyone to have a closer walk with our Lord. There is a ""desert place"" for every child of God, a little haven where Jesus is lovingly waiting...from which He is calling. Let us do as Ste Therese did and answer that call! I do not think that it is a movie only good for ""school viewing"", and if you are concerned about the narrative part, don't be, because it is just occuring from time to time (not like some movies which have so much narration that they look like a documentary). It is a great and touching movie for all ages!",1144800000,4,817,4.243589743589744
2414513,5,B000BDGVT0,"Saint Therese was definitely an excellent role model for today's youth and adults alike.  This movie is an excellent rendition of her very holy, but short life.  I hope it will inspire many to be as selfless and gracious as she was.",1143072000,6,232,4.5
2414514,1,B000BDGVT0,"I was floating on air when I heard out about this film, but my heart sank when I saw it.  All the reviews that liken it to a film made for a school project, or a home movie production aren't too far off the mark.  It's a little better than that, but just based on the quality (and not the topic) I can't think of a studio in Hollywood that would put this film out without an absolute hope of not only tanking, but getting heckled worse than Kevin Costiner.  Yes, let me put it that way, Kevin Costiner's films look like Citizen Cane in comparison to this film.

The good new is that I can highly suggest an outstanding French film on Therese (also entitled Therese) that I own.  It's a very basic stage-style production, but it doesn't purport to be anything more than that.  The sets are basic, but the acting is much better than this!

If you're interested in learning about St. Therese, I'd highly suggest that you start with her own writings.  As far as Catholic writings go I put them up there with those of Augustine and Thomas as absolutely essential.  But fear not, Therese was no scholar, her writings can even be read by young children.  I suggest you start with Story of a Soul, and then work on to the ""essential writings"".",1142640000,16,1235,4.353711790393013
2414515,1,B000BDGVT0,"I was so excited to see this film, and yet so disappointed with it.  This was such an amateurish film, I could hardly believe it was being shown in a movie theatre -- it looked more like a film school project.  The point-of-view of the story bounces around (either told by a narrator or told by St. Therese herself), the acting is terrible, the cinematography is worse, and ultimately, the story is so poorly told that I'm sure it did not do justice to St. Therese's life.  The movie version of her story is still waiting to be made.",1142553600,14,533,4.363636363636363

2414517,1,B000BDGVT0,"I was hoping that this would be an inspiring and beautiful film.  Unfortunately it was sooo cheesy.  The acting is awful.  So forced and ridiculous.  The girl who portrays Therese has an unmistakable mustache and it distracted me the whole time.

I wish someone would make a great Therese film.  She is such a wonderful saint.

I'm sorry, but I just thought this was terrible.",1141948800,9,376,4.6923076923076925

AFTER READING SEVERAL GOOD REVIEWS,I RAN OUT AND BOUGHT THERESE-

2414519,5,B000BDGVT0,"This film as an unprecedentedly REALISTIC view of a saint I have read about for over 40 years. One must realize that life in the 19th century was not convenient or easy--and the convent life depicted reflects various aspects of that. Also, French culture at the time of her life was tolerant of much innocent, physical demonstrations of love among family members--also depicted in the film. I found this movie to be one of the most beautiful I have ever seen about her life. To one unfamiliar with the history and French culture of the 19th century, the sets would appear to be stark and barren. If we of the 21st century are appalled by that, I invite you to visit the Carmelite convent where Therese lived and died--compared to that, the sets used in the movie were luxurious! The acting was done with reverence, and the scenes depicting her death were awe-inspiring (and brought tears to my eyes)! A definite good work on the life of a Saint and Doctor of the Catholic Church!!",1141689600,22,980,4.605714285714286
2414520,5,B000BDGVT0,"I really enjoyed this movie. It was very well produced and directed. The acting was also very good. One of the things I really liked about it was the option to see the movie with a running commentary from the director, giving one a better insight into St. Therese's life.

This film is a must see. It should have been nominated for a few Oscars. Hopefully it will be out in Irish cinemas soon as St. Therese is a very popular saint here.",1141430400,6,437,4.265060240963855
2414521,1,B000BDGVT0,"St. Therese is my favorite saint and I enjoyed reading her autobiography.  However, I was extremely disappointed after watching this film. The film maker did a horrible job in things such as historical details, and I have to say, the costumes are so badly made [especially the cassocks of bishops and even the pope's], which is totally unacceptable.  Moreover, actors' acting is terrible (Frankly I don't know if that could be called acting). In conclusion, the story of St. Therese itself is inspiring, but the film is utterly a disaster. Don't waste your money on this dvd, it is not worth it! The film maker and actors should have done a much better job. What a shame!",1141084800,7,671,4.726495726495727
2414522,5,B000BDGVT0,"This is a very good intro to St. Therese's life.  It is one of the only current movies out there that does not need edited before the family can watch it.  My 2,3,4,and 5 year olds will sit through the entire movie.  The music in the movie is wonderful, and you can't buy it anywhere for less than 15.99.  What a deal!  It begins with her life as a child and ends at her death of 24.  It shows briefly some of the trials that she faced in order to show her ""little way"" of doing things in order to become a Saint.  We can all take an example from this movie on bearing our crosses, the power of family prayer, and doing the little things to work with GOD.",1140912000,13,655,3.9923076923076923

2414524,5,B000BDGVT0,"This film does a fantastic job of closely following her autobiography ""Story of a Soul"", as its outline.

It could of been longer, but just the same it's a beautiful film.(It also comes with a small booklet. :)

Yay, Therese!",1139788800,16,345,4.532258064516129
2414527,5,B000BDGVT0,"This is the kind of movie we Christians have been dreaming about for a long time to come out of Hollywood. THERESE is a fabulous, very visual historical movie, in the same cinematic style as a Merchant-Ivory movie; such as ""Room with a View"" or ""Howard's End"" yet told with a beautiful, deeply spiritual theme.

Anyone familiar --or not-- with the story of St. Therese will discover why THERESE is a mesmerizing, fantastic tale of very real Christian Virtue, struggle, and ultimate triumph. Moreover, this film is more than a rich, moving experience, told in a warm, gorgeous cinematic style. THERESE has changed many lives, for the better.

THERESE is a deeply moving, enchanting, and very rewarding film to watch. Thus, it is impossible to view just once or thrice. This is also a movie you'll want to share (and buy) for friends and family.",1139356800,19,843,4.8068965517241375
