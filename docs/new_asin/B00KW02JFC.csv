6451941,3,B00KW02JFC,"It's my own fault; I was too excited when I ordered this and thought I was buying the two volume set. I ended up getting only Volume II. I didn't realize that it was only half of what I wanted. I wish I knew what happened to Volume I...
Anyway, these official Bonanza DVD's are excellent!! There are bonuses on practically every DVD, like interviews and behind the scene photos of the episodes. I thought I was going to have all of them, but I am missing only Volume I of the seventh season...",1431302400,,493,4.25531914893617
6451942,4,B00KW02JFC,"I have always loved Bonanza, even at a tender age. I was fortunate to speak with both Landon and Greene, in the 1980s. This season is better than the first four or five- despite the fine performances of Pernell Roberts in past shows. Many honest fans would admit that the first 40 or so episodes (1959- 60) were substandard. The pilot had three of the Cartwrights ""singng""/ shouting  the Livingston and Evans lyrics to the theme song. (smartly, Roberts abstained).  And the characters sometimes seemed self-impressed and  impersonable. Fortunately, NBC kept the series, and the cast grew impressively. Season 7 is noted for ""Inheriet The Wind"" a 2-part  pony express show that was actually presented as a movie overseas. Here, we get to see the leads at their best:  Ben-,the strong yet wise pa, ""Hoss"", the nurturing and compassionate mid brother, and ""Little Joe"", the more hot-headed brother. I am looking forward to future seasons with David Canary as ranch hand/ forman ""Candy""- a hard-nosed army-brat turned cowboy who seems to need the kinship of the  Cartwrights.",1422489600,,1071,5.022598870056497
6451943,4,B00KW02JFC,"Part 2 is definitely the better half, with 19 episodes compared to part 1 with 15, and all of the strongest episodes are in this set. In general though, this season is not as strong as the earlier ones, quite a few of the storylines have a familiar ring to them, for example, we've already seen Little Joe falling for every pretty girl he's seen yet another time, likewise Hoss being courted by another pretty gal and even Ben being charmed by a pretty lady, and then again there's the immigrant settlers that want a piece of the Ponderosa as their own, and so on. The absence of Adam is greatly missed, the man in black was usually involved in the more adventuresome stories, going after gunfighters, etc, not spending too much time as his brothers chasing women. So this season has much more dramatic and comedic episodes than in the past, but there are still a few gems that make this a worthwhile effort and fairly good overall entertainment.

Best Season 7 Episodes

17. Ride the Wind -- Part 1
18. Ride the Wind -- Part 2
- A 2 part saga about the Pony Express rhat is also included with its theatrical version on disc 5, so you would probably want to save this one for a later time to watch it again. This is a great Calvary VS Indians episode done on a grand scale, just like an old time John Wayne western with beautifully photographed outdoor scenery, action and chases.
20. Peace Officer
- Eric Fleming, formerly the chief boss of Rawhide, guest stars in one of his last appearances before his tragic demise, as a gun killing hired marshall in one of the best episodes ever of  Bonanza,
21. The Code
- Little Joe is challenged to a duel by a professional bounty hunter and the town places bets on him forcing him to make a very difficult decison in one of the season's most tense episodes.
30. The Fighters
- Hoss goes into the boxing ring to fight a professional champion in one of his most exciting episodes.",1414800000,2,1921,4.4209039548022595

8662044,4,B00KW02JFC,"Good collection of episodes.
I mainly purchase this for ""RIDE THE WIND"". Wanting to compare the 2-part episode with the movie version.
And for Eric Fleming. The nearly forgotten lead actor of RAWHIDE. It seems I am not the only person on AMAZON who likes Fleming.
What surprise me is that I enjoyed the Wayne Newton episode. Usually I don't care for his singing style. But the story and his singing was well done.",1439424000,2,413,4.594594594594595
