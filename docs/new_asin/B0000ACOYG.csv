1904867,4,B0000ACOYG,"Martin and Lewis pull out the stops for these live TV shows.  Better than their movies. Would have rated it 5 stars except for the sound quality.  Because of the primitive recording equipment of the 50s, some lines are hard to catch. The included movie is typical ML comedy.  Picture quality is OK, but not as good as others I've purchased.",1176163200,3,340,4.540983606557377

1904869,2,B0000ACOYG,"STRICTLY FOR DIE-HARD FANS ONLY.  THE EARLY ""JERRY LEWIS"" WORK GETS ON MY NERVES, HIS TALENT IMPROVED TOWARDS THE MID 1950s IN HIS FILMS WHEN HE CREATED A CHARACTER THAT EVOKES SYMPATHY AND LIKEABILITY.  BUT HIS EARLY WORK IS TOO MAD, THAT NASAL VOICE HE USED TO ADOPT IS SOOO IRRITATING.

FOR LEWIS GENIUS, BUY ""THE DISORDERLY ORDERLY"" ""ARTISTS AND MODELS"" - BETTER CHOICE THAN THESE TV APPEARANCES ON ""COLGATE COMEDY HOUR"".

THE SHOW CHOICES WERE SO RANDOM TOO.

1904870,4,B0000ACOYG,"Martin & Lewis.  I didn't get get ""it"" when I was younger because by the time I was watching the old movies on reruns they were already a non-team.  Only by watching these old Colgate shows can a person recapture the magic that made them headlines.  Jerry's was the free spirit of nonsense but he needed Dean to pull him back into line once in while and if you watch carefully (very carefully) you can see the dynamics of how they worked off each other's best comic features.  Terrific comedy team that was at their best when they forgot the scripts.  This is one of the better collections.",1138233600,10,590,4.425925925925926

In my excitement of recieving this I opened the package and later on learned that I could not return opened packages...So, It was a total waste for me. I did not get what I wanted at all.",1125532800,23,298,4.067796610169491
1904872,5,B0000ACOYG,"This is a wonderful selection of the Martin and Lewis Colgate Comedy Hours.  The show used revolving hosts, and Eddie Cantor and Martin and Lewis were by far the most popular.  For those that are only familiar with the team through their films, this collection will be a revelation.  The duo's television appearances are only a slightly toned down version of their live act-and that was legendary.  The show dates are not indicated on the packaging, so here they are: 1-2/4/51, 2-1/25/53, 3-11/4/51, 4-4/29/51, 5-12/19/54 (next to last appearance), 6-11/13/55 (last appearance and the next-to-last episode of the show), 7-No date can be found, but it is the 8th Anniversary of the team on the Comedy Hour, broadcast from Atlantic City.  The set also includes trailers for some of their films-great stuff, especially for the films filmed in VistaVision, where the process is promoted as much as the team.  (""Bigger, Brighter, Funnier!"")  Grab this one!",1078531200,39,951,5.096774193548387
1904873,4,B0000ACOYG,"This is a fantastic collection of seven episodes of the Colgate Comedy Hour featuring Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis.  The telecast, with Dean and Jerry as hosts, ran from around 1951-1954.  This collection is filled with several funny skits and memorable songs, as well as a stellar supporting cast of classic
Hollywood film stars.  We are also treated to vintage Colgate commercials, as these specials are left entirely intact.
As a bonus the duos classic ""At War with the Army"" is features on disc one, and disc five finds ""At the Movies with Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis"", where several of the comedy teams sixteen feature films are featured using the original (or re-release) trailers.
In short, this collection is a great start to what will hopefully lead to Dean and Jerry's entire cinematic catalog being released to DVD, as well as that of comedian Jerry Lewis's entire solo career.
A treasure for any fan of the duo, or a lover of good entertainment.",1065052800,67,956,4.817073170731708

And to top it off, it includes the movie ""At war with the Army"". If you are a Martin & Lewis fan, you'll love this DVD collection. And if you're not a fan, you might as well become one. I've been a big fan of Jerry Lewis since I can remember, and here he shows why he's considered America's best comedian. Well... to me, he's the best.",1063756800,23,508,4.1938775510204085

7996655,4,B0000ACOYG,"The chemistry between Dean Martin the crooner and Jerry Lewis the clown was electrifying. After their first screen appearances in the 'My friend Irma' films 1949-50. 'At War With the Army' 1950 is their first full feature starring vehicle, which would launch the duos Hollywood careers with a string of movie comedy classics. If the 30's belonged to The Marx Brothers, the 40's to Abbott & Costello, then the 1950's lay claim to Martin & Lewis.

They are incredibly funny and this DVD does us a service by showing what an electric live act they were - and the price was reasonable. Transfer quality is good enough, considering the master materials. What would have bumped my review up? At least some extras, especially interviews, even brief ones (for example, Jerry Lewis pal and classic comedy buff Peter Bogdanovich and the authors of The Jerry Lewis Films, James Neibaur and Ted Okuda).",1398297600,,497,4.724137931034483
