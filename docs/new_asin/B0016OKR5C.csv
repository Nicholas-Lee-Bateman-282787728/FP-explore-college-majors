3162340,5,B0016OKR5C,Great informational DVDs. Very nice behind the scenes documentary. Well done all the best rides in the motogp series. Awesome,1394668800,,125,5.3
3162341,5,B0016OKR5C,"Great documentary.  Perfectly captures the changes in the sport as the move was made from 500cc two-stroke engines to the four stroke litre bikes that we have today.  You will get to see the pioneers that helped make the sport what it is today as well as the future cast of riders that are now the ""old men"" in the paddocks.  Highly recommend part two of this documentary series if you are a motogp fan.",1394236800,,403,4.346666666666667
3162342,5,B0016OKR5C,"Whether it's the novice rider or the seasoned track star, this race documentary does an amazing job recounting the history of Moto GP, arguably the fastest sport on Earth.  For those not in the know, Ewan McGregor of Star Wars fame is an avid motorcyclist having done several adventure series and makes a perfect host in the matter.  The movie goes into detail regarding the key players, the technology, the controversy of the race series.

This double set is nice because it goes into further detail regarding the top three charismatic icons of the racing  world.

All in all, a great pickup or gift item for the race enthusiast.",1359244800,,630,4.743119266055046

3162347,5,B0016OKR5C,"I haven't been going to road races for a few years, so I had lost track of most of the MotoGP riders and many of the AMA riders that transfered to MotoGP.  These guys were just starting to make names for themselves during the last seasons that I attended. These DVD's give a great overview of not only the riders, but the big changes in the sport. At the same time you can get involved in the competition going on for #1. Much better than reading about it. Maybe not as good as being there, but worth every penny!",1219968000,2,513,4.181818181818182
