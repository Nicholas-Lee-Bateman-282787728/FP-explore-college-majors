8238739,3,B0010W2PT6,The DVD was ok but most of it was silent. Buy the other Iowa Class historical DVD on Amazon. It's a mom-pop outfit and the only part of this DVD w/sound is included on that other DVD for half the price. I think the merchant is Campbell and sons.,1394582400,,245,4.020408163265306
8238740,2,B0010W2PT6,"I purchased this for video about the Iowa Class Battleships and only got some of what I wanted.  The last long stretch of video is a USO show with Bob Hope showing Ann Margret which obviously has nothing whatsoever to do with an Iowa Class Battleship.  If I could copy the DVD I'd remove these kinds of distractions and leave only the information about the Battleships I sought to purchase.  You can find better than this, and much of this can be found Free on You Tube.  The film is almost all black and white.  This is disappointing in that these ships still exist and the last time they were active color film was a common enough medium that some of this should have been in color. the film quality is poor in many segments, even when Black & White.

Remember that it is unlikely that a Battleship will ever again be active.  The turrets that control the huge naval rifles are a complex, and extremely dangerous environment, evidence the terrible casualties onboard Iowa, when Turret Two Exploded, that were blamed initially on a crew member thought, mistakenly to be a saboteur.  Though the U.S. Navy purposely botched that investigation, detailed examination later showed that it was inconsistent with the evidence that the explosion had been caused by a detonator extraneous to the turret and gun room.  In fact after testing the more likely scenario that the powder bags had been mistakenly over rammed by a poorly trained member of the gun crew, that was seen as the  far more likely cause of that terrible tragedy onboard Iowa.  These films allow us to see a technology long gone and unlikely to ever be seen in use again.

Modern Hollywood has had access to the museums that are these ships and they have produced films of people firing the main guns, and even men hand carrying a projectile.  That is all fictional, and impossible once you see the reality of this film. A turret required a minimum gun crew of 79, and more often than not, a hundred men and more to operate each 3 gun turret.  The projectiles (bullets) weigh from 1900 to 2700 pounds each.  No chance a half dozen men could lift one onto their shoulders and carry it, as one hollywood action film shows. Incidentally it took a crew of 2700 to take an Iowa Class Battleship to war.

There is NO Film of the Modernized ships with cruise missiles adapted to fire on Beirut during the Reagan Administration.  Those missiles may render such films ' Classified ',accounting for that lack of film.

Incidentally, there are information sources on line that explain much that the films do not.  One example would be the deterioration of the hydraulics in the turrets and the leakage when the ships were returned to DryDock and refitted.  These ships were launched in the early 1940's so they have deteriorated significantly in 70 years, as one should expect.  The fire control shown is what was world war two technology. I am sure when the guns were aimed in the 1980's serious electronic advances were installed to aim the guns more precisely.  But the loading and firing would not have been different because they are still bag guns.",1352592000,,3103,4.665441176470588
8238741,5,B0010W2PT6,"We are battleship fans and just in awe of their magnitude. The film was well worth the price of admission when the film explained the operation and loading of the big guns. Wow, 1940 technology put together without the use of computer aids. Definitely a winner to keep in any collection of these magnificent ships.",1330905600,,314,4.7272727272727275
8238742,3,B0010W2PT6,"This dvd was given by me to two of my adult, out-of-state sons who'd visited, and gone to the Battleship New Jersey with me.
  A dvd specifically about the New Jersey was not available, so I sent this one about the, ""Iowa Class"" battleships, which includes the NJ.
  My sons, reluctant to complain about a gift, said that the action videos are extremely interesting since they'd seen the ship; but not in action.  The down side is that there is no audio, which was not explained in the, ""product information"".
  Be that as it may, the recipients are happy to have the dvd in light of the scarcity of anything similar available today.",1283299200,2,633,4.548672566371682
