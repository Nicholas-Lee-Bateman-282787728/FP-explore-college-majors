8352086,1,B00265T7LU,"I was not impressed by this workout. Does not live up to the DVD's title at all. This may be good for the elderly, but it is much too gentle for your average person. I have found pilates and yoga DVD's to be much more effective.  For the first 11 minutes of the 32 minute DVD I was wondering when we were going to work the back out.  As mentioned in the other review, the narration trails the demonstrator's action and there is no exercise ball as shown on the front cover.",1297036800,3,473,4.130434782608695
8352087,4,B00265T7LU,"The cover of this workout is a bit misleading as there is no use of any exercise balls in this video.  None the less, it is a good back workout and my lower back actually feels better when I run now as I have been doing this workout 2 times per week.  Relaxing music, but the naration is a little off from the instructor (the original is in german).  It is a good back workout - this is not a calorie burner type workout - very relaxing with some challenging moves, but again, I think , effective.",1254182400,8,497,4.103092783505154
