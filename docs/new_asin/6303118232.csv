562226,5,6303118232,"After watching ""New Jack City"", ""Sugar Hill"" is definitely a similar, but milder, pared down version of the former, still with the stark realities of street life and the drug trade being the common denominator. While in New Jack, Wesley Snipes character ""Nino"" is a cold,bloodthirsty,womanizing, and heartless druglord. Snipes' role as Carmello in SH is much more conservative in terms of his mannerisims, attire, and he is compassionate, humane, and sympathetic, but still not forgetting that he is first and foremost a drug kingpin who needs to take care of business. Ironically, Carmello must care for his ailing father, whose life is in shambles as a result of abusing the same product that made his own son rich, and eventually succumbs. I would even go on a limb to say Nino from NJC could be regarded as being re-incarnated in another life in this film as another character(Carmello). Carmello eventually tires of his life as a dealer, and realizes that there is more to life than the jet set lifestyle, wealth and material things.

Eventually,Carmello is given another chance at redemption, but must live the rest of his life with a crippling injury that was inflicted by his own brother, who eventually dies as well. Carmello starts over far from the concrete jungles of NYC with a new wife and child.  The remarkable Clarence Williams, Ernie Hudson, Vondie Curtis-Hall, the lovely Theresa Randle, Abe Vigoda and other actors add to the depth of this film. Even after 10 years, this movie still hits home.",1098835200,7,1514,4.933333333333334
562227,4,6303118232,"From Covenant Avenue to St. Nick-Harlem, once
the mecca that African-Americans lived, breathed and
thrived in, has become a pocket of infestation, a neigh-
borhood in hell, a timeshare in Vietnam. There's a war,
children, a war of values, of ethics, of lives, of genera-
tions and, ultimately, the spoils are simply blood, mate-
rial goods and empty futures. Wesley Snipes stars in the
new film Sugar Hill, which follows Roemello, a mid-
level drug kingpin, through the course of what seems to
be a week. Roemello is tired, but why he is exhausted is
never made clear. The film, directed by Leon Ichaso,
takes an unflinching look at both yesterday's addicts
(Roemello's parents) and today's (Roemello's brother
and partner Ray N athan) .The central theme is whether
or not Roemello will choose the true love of his girl-
friend Melissa, played with a defiant presence of char-
acter by Theresa Randle, or his surrogate father Gus,
mafia lord, supplier and the man who attempted to kill
Roemello's now-decrepit father. A battle over territory
ensues between Roemello and a competitor brought in
by Gus.
Roemello's father, played by Clarence Williams III
(who will be overlooked for an Oscar due the film's
release date), dealt drugs, supplied his wife's habit
(which leads to her death) , and lives in a walking death
of memories, regrets and heroin when the film opens.
Ray Nathan, played by Michael Wright, is the clingy,
needy older brother who relies on his Georgetown-
educated brother to balance his street insanity with
calculation and diplomacy. We then begin to see that all
Roemello is, all he has trusted, has abandoned him. Seen
this way we can finally understand why he's looking to
distance himself from his past. But the past is a curious,
vengeful, entangling animal tha t stalks all of Roemello' s
attempts to leave behind a vicious life for...? Well,
Roemello is never quite clear about where he'll go.
Sugar Hill is not one film, but several, and not one
story, but a legion of tales that fold into one another and
entangle tentacles of power, greed, lust, loyalty and
even family values. Two criticisms of this film are, one,
Roemello's character is made peripheral to the business
he actually controls. In a sense, we only see his hands
dirtied twice by murder. One is understandable, though
unjust, while the second is both unjust and inevitable.
Roemello, for all that his character embodies as an anti-
hero, becomes heroic as a drug dealer. His sense of
honor, supposedly gained through experience, makes
his moral caliber above those he deals with, and this is
where the film falters. How can the audience relate to
a good man who commits such a vile act as the extermi-
nation of his own people, his own father through
providing drugs? Is this a good man? Secondly, the film
also falters in that we, the audience, see the shadowed
results of murders-some not even shown. The audi-
ence can't visually connect to the crimes of the film
actually being committed by those we're supposed to
feel something for. In fact, a split occurs between the
good-bad guys and the bad-bad guys. Too many loop-
holes of justification and reverse condemnation perme-
ate the film. Are we, as an audience, so often spoon-fed
pabulum entertainment that we can't handle a mature
film where the characters redeem themselves not into
angels, but at least into something better than what
they were before? Do we need the hero going off into
the sunset so badly that we're willing to justify murder,
drug dealing and racial supplication just to feel good?
Make no mistake, Sugar Hill, even with it's intermit-
tently hard-soft hitting, is a film that needs to be seen, that
needs to beunderstood, and whose complexity and shades
of grey needs to be revealed and delved into. I highly
recommend it and feel strongly about the film, but I do
resent the soft-shoeing around the total impact that could
have been made. It's rated R, we're all adults, so let's live
in reality.",1024012800,14,3973,4.835535976505139
562228,4,6303118232,"After reading how the critics panned this movie I wonder if they watched it.  The movie has a very dark yet thoughtful feel to it.  If we understand that critics rarely have talent as actors or screenwriters we can see how this nice movie could be so underrated by them.  Wesley Snipes plays his role with a warm compassion for those around him.  Michael Wright does overact quite a bit but he probably had a few years to go to become a good actor.  Clarence Williams III was superb as the father.  Theresa Randle is very good as the girlfriend.  I almost fell in love with her myself.  She seemed like the perfect woman.  The rest of the movie is straight gangster done by a black cast except for Abe Vigoda who played his part excellently.
The opening scene and the scene about the mother and father is very good and sets up the whole movie.  Especially the scene with the father and the thugs on the roof, which is fantastic.  We understand so much about Roem's motives from that scene that we appreciate his later life and his rage toward the things which affect him later.
I usually don't like movies which are from the nineties but this one stands out.  It is worth watching.",1005436800,11,1181,4.416666666666667
562229,5,6303118232,This is a very good adult movie. My advise is to not let children under 15 view. It tells a true moment in life that can happen to anyone. It took me a long time to find this movie and I am glad to see that it is so widely being produced. It is one of Wesley's best. A must see.,1003104000,,278,3.5737704918032787
562230,5,6303118232,This is a well acted drama starring Michael Wright in one of the best performances of it's kind. It also stars Wesley Snipes as a drug dealer who  is having a crisis of conscience because he is dealing the same drugs that  killed his mother and doing business whith the men who almost killed his  father(Clarence Williams the 3rd). This movie starts out slow but quickley  picks up speed. Highley recomended.,965433600,2,408,4.704225352112676

562514,4,6303118232,"This is a movie I can do without watching with Wesley Snipes. Wesley Snipes is my favorite actor, but my all-time favorite movie with him is Passenger 57, an action movie with him that came out 2 years before this movie. I find that movie with Wesley is alot better than this movie Sugar Hill, and it's totally different. This movie Sugar Hill was very violent, and I don't find that it was a good movie in my opinion. And some of the scenes I didn't like, including the very last scene. So I would just stick with watching the movie Passenger 57, which is more of my favorite with Wesley Snipes, or any other movie that's my favorite with him. That movie Passenger 57 is not as violent as this movie Sugar Hill, and Wesley did play a good and better role in that movie.

I remember back in 1994 when this movie Sugar Hill came out in theaters, I was a kid and I couldn't watch it. But now with me seeing and watching it as a grown man, I realized how violent it was and understood why I couldn't watch it as a kid. And kids can't see or watch this movie, because it's very violent. And not only that this movie is violent, but it also has alot of profanity languages, and kids don't need to watch movies like this with profanity languages. And although I'm now grown, I still choose not watch this movie. And I don't think that this was Wesley Snipes's best movie. I would say that I didn't even really like the Wesley that Wesley Snipes was in this movie Sugar Hill. I pretty much like him as the Wesley from Passenger 57, or from any other movie that's my favorite with him. Wesley Snipes played a drug dealer in this movie Sugar Hill, and that's not a role I want to see him play. A good role is what I want to see Wesley play, and I don't find that a drug dealer is a good role for him to play.",1456272000,,1799,4.14

563080,4,6303118232,"Though I can rarely take Wesley Snipes seriously (in anything) this film has always stuck out to me as being one of the most effective examples of modern film noir that I have ever seen--also, one of the most dead on commentaries about drug use and the poverty of the inner cities.  The mood that runs through it is, by turns, hopeful and funereal.  At no point did I honestly think that Roemello Skuggs (Welsey Snipes' character) was going to escape Harlem, or that his older brother Ray (Michael Wright) were going to make it out of their harsh upbringing.

The story is complex and the anger pretty intense, but it's clear from the outset that all involved are doomed in some way.  Even Abe Vigoda, of Godfather fame, who plays Gus, an Italian mobster who was close to Roemello from childhood, seems a bit worn and, well, old.  This is the moral of the film:  drugs make everyone who participate in them prematurely old, wasted, and greedy.

When Roemello was a child, his father (a heroin addict played with masterfully painful believability by Clarence Williams) was a dealer for Gus, and became hooked on his own product.  Gus employed Roemello instead, who became his own employer, for a time leaving his old neighborhood.  He returns to aid his older brother, a hopeless dope fiend.

The plot, though, is not what is as important here as the *mood*, which is absolutely masterful.  The atmosphere is pure noir, and though it is clearly set in the present, it has the magical sheen of a 1940's film.  Recommended viewing for all lovers of film, despite the occasional preachiness and hamminess.",1388534400,,1601,4.719424460431655

563261,3,6303118232,"This is the story of two young men in Harlem who watch their mother die of a heroin overdose and their father crippled by the Italian gangsters who bring drugs into the neighborhood, and who (in Snipe's case anyway) excel in school and win university scholarships, but who nonetheless return to work as dealers for the same gangsters who destroyed their family. The script takes a lot from the Godfather trilogy. Some of the performances (including Wesley Snipes') were quite good, and the cinematography was excellent. I was particularly struck by a shot of Snipes standing on the roof of a building in the Sugar Hill neighborhood that he and his older brother control. There were some lovely shots of Mount Morris Park in the Autumn and of other attractive parts of Harlem, to the point that I found myself wondering if the cinematographer knew he was supposed to be filming a gritty crime drama. There were still plenty of ugly parts of Harlem in 1993-1994 when this movie was made, but they don't often show up on the screen here. A realtor could use clips from Sugar Hill as a promotional video for ""beautiful Harlem.""

Some scenes are overacted, including the opening scene with the mother's death. Some cliches are visible (e.g. the young boy who wants to be a tough gangster like Snipes, and whom Snipes chases away, and who inevitably gets shot to death by Snipe's enemies before the end). The biggest problem with the film is that it tries to fit too much material. The history of drugs in Harlem, the tension between the brothers, the fall of their father, the dating life of Theresa Randle, the metaphorical (and at one point literal) chess game between Snipe's gang, and the Italians, and Ernie Hudson's newly arrived gang from Red Hook. It's too much. Somebody should have fixed this at the script stage, or in the editing room.

What's left is enjoyable, but this is not a great film.",1337731200,,1899,4.716867469879518

Not the gritty Wesley Snipes that everyone remembers from ""New Jack City"" but nonetheless a great performance.  I compare Snipes to Pacino in the aspect of how he changed gears from Ruthless in Scarface to a person trying to leave the life in Carlito's Way and of course the romantic plot that showed a different side to each character.  At the same time, both were able to still show some of the punch that made those two movies hits in the streets.  Snipes is at his best as he is trying to leave his troubled past but each time gets pulled back by the ghosts that haunt him.  Great performances by Michael Wright, Ernie Hudson, Abe Vigoda, and Clarence Williams III!  A must have to your Gangster Film Collection!!!",1298246400,2,800,4.513888888888889

563313,5,6303118232,"I have always loved this film and will always love this film till my dying days. It reminds me of a time when Black cinema broke the mold with the stories that were told and how those stories were told. Sugar Hill is a well written and well acted tale film noir drama that never got the respect it truly deserves.

Roemello(Wesley Snipes) wants to break free from a world of crime but is constantly dragged back in. He cant live a normal life or have a girlfriend in it because something bad is always happening around him. His brother Raynathan(Michael Wright) is very high-strung and causes some of Roemello's problems plus he has to deal with his drug-addicted father A.R.(Clarence Williams III).

Wesley Snipes best performance is Roemello Skuggs. This movie proved beyond the shadow of a doubt that Wesley can act as well as play a serious role. Michael Wright is good as Raynathan even though he can get buckwild at times. Clarence Williams III is excellent as their drug-afflicted father A.R. He was always a great actor that never got enough credit for great roles such as this one, Hoodlum and Deep Cover. Theresa Randle is is pretty good as Roemello's girlfriend Melissa. She is innocent in the sense that she is not numb to death and violence and actually feels pain upon seeing something like for instance a dead body. Melissa is gorgeous as well as likable. There are also some strong performances by Abe Vigoda and Ernie Hudson.

I love the setting of the movie as well as the cinematography. Director Leon Ichaso has an eye for things and you can see that as you watch this movie. Its a shame that the movie didn't do well and the director never did another movie again. I would have liked to see another movie from him.

There's no time for redemption, there's no way out for your elusive dreams, in many ways this film is very close in spirit to Carlito's way where any man can be able to escape from his past.

This movie is a potent Noir, but viewed from the opposite side of the street. If Spike Lee captured all our attention about the strong tension among Italian and niggers Empire about the distribution and sell of angel's dust and other candies, the film gets out from the simple anecdote and returns over and over about the fatality that hovers all this family, mother and father have been destroyed and two brothers build an Empire from the ashes of the fatal addictions.
