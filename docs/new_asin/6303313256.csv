7842936,4,6303313256,"This video contains a couple of good numbers by Al Hirt, along with an older version of the Bob Crosby Bobcats, doing ""March of the Bobcats"" and a version of ""Big Noise from Winnetka"".  Crosby, now white-headed, leads the band, but the only stalward from his original group is tenor sax great, Eddie Miller. Scatman Crothers is also featured, and a composite Dixieland group.  It's in color and displays variety of musicianship, but isn't the greatest example of Dixieland around.",1170288000,,480,4.9875
