1079929,5,630576333X,"Happy, Texas is a real delight: a very smart comedy with a uniformly strong cast that draws much of its appeal from the relationships between the characters.  William H. Macy brings genuine sweetness to the role of  Chappy, the lovesick sheriff, and Steve Zahn is out-of-control funny as  Wayne Wayne Wayne, Jr., but Jeremy Northam steals the show in a complete  departure from his roles in films such as ""The Winslow Boy"" and  ""An Ideal Husband.""  His dance scene with Macy is one of the  funniest in the movie, and he and Ally Walker generate real chemistry  together. I hope we'll see  more of him in contemporary comedies.  I've  enjoyed this movie a number of times and never get tired of it.  Definitely  a home video library requirement!",959817600,,744,4.71875
1079930,4,630576333X,"I would have rated this one three stars, were it not for the acting brilliance of William H. Macy, who is fast becoming a legend in his own time.  He makes an average 'We're No Angels' knockoff above average.  Overall the movie is entertaining, but the female cast was grossly  underutilized.  Each of the scenes containing children, with the exception  of the final, redemptive frame, played out like afterthoughts, thrown in to  provide perfunctory embellishment.  And the joe who played the Texas  Marshall with 'a secret of his own'--didn't he play opposite Linda Hamilton  in the 'Beauty and the Beast' series some years back?  His turn in this  flick was, quite frankly, a campy disappointment.  My advice? Go to 'Happy,  Texas', if you can't find a copy of 'Mystery Men' at the video store.",959644800,,797,4.858208955223881

1079932,5,630576333X,"When I first walked into the movie theater, I wasn't quite sure what to expect from this movie.  What I found was a wonderfully entertaining and hilarious movie.  The plot is original, the acting is great, and the script  is hilarious!  I really loved it!",958867200,2,255,4.6
1079933,3,630576333X,"The guys in this film are dumber than dirt but they get the women anyway so the women must be really dumb or hard up. If you liked the elegant Jeremy Northam of 'The Idal Husband', 'Emma' or the 'Winslow Boy' buy those  DVD's first. William Macy's character (the lawman) is sappy and I found him  very unappealing (buy Fargo instead).
The film has the depth, class, and  humor of 'The Three Stooges.' Older kids might like the film because they  can laugh at a guy holding a squashed Armidillo, but you might not want  your kids to see it.",958262400,,539,4.35
1079934,5,630576333X,"I was reluctant to see this movie--I expected gay jokes, slams against Southerners, and criminals who get away with crimes just because they're the heroes of a modern-day movie.  But the writer, Ed Stone, is clearly  much smarter than all of that, and so is Happy, Texas.  I saw it once, HAD  to get my husband to see it, then he, who has an even more critical eye  than I do, insisted we take our friends to see it the NEXT week, and now  we've just bought it again on DVD.  We can't get enough of it.  It's as  hilarious as The Pink Panther and as intelligent as Shawshank Redemption.  See it, see it, see it!",956880000,3,611,4.189655172413793
1079935,5,630576333X,"""Two aspiring novice writers/directors go to Sundance Film Festival and become inspired to make their own movie for a future festival.  They do and it is highly received. Miramax buys it and releases it to critical acclaim in theaters and on DVD.""  This plot sketch, the actual story  of how director Mark Illsley and writer/producer Ed Stone triumphed in  their project, ""Happy, Texas,"" is at least as interesting as the  actual movie plot.  You get both stories in this excellent DVD release:  the bonus features, including director commentary, alternate takes, making  of..., videos and more are well worth the extra price of this loaded DVD.  If you want to learn how fire-in-the-belly untested movie makers make their  dream come true, then this is it:  a film to remember, especially since you  will feel you were there during the shooting (because of the inside  information about the production).  On another note, one has to admire  William H. Macy, currently hot in films and able to command high salary,  who was, nevertheless, willing to sign on to a 28-day, independent movie  shoot at scant pay, portraying a 300-pound Texas lawman. Macy almost steals  the show from the entire group of solid performers.  See this movie on DVD.  It will make you ""happy.""",956361600,5,1269,4.9523809523809526
1079936,5,630576333X,"A late 1990s indie twist on the classic Billy Wilder movie featuring Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis in drag to avoid being killed by mobsters.  This time the protagenists, Harry (Jermey Northam) and Wayne Wayne Wayne, Jr.  (Steve Zahn), nonviolent escapees from a prision work crew, pretend to be a  gay couple who coach contestants in beauty pagents.  They are embraced  (literally as well as figuratively) by the residents of a small town.  This  film is really, really funny with standout performances by William Macy,  Jr., Steve Zahn, Moe Gabney and the little beauty pagent girls.  Britisher  Northam is a very convincing American conman who finally has to take  responsibility for his actions. Rent it, buy it, whatever it takes to see  it.",956275200,,744,4.959349593495935
1079937,4,630576333X,"What a delightful movie. I heard about this when it was released at the theatre and I was expecting something quirky and zany. It is testament to the direction of Illsley and to the great acting that the story is really  brought to life.
A simple story: prison breakout, the fugitives are  mistaken for gay children's pageant organisers, they plan a bank robbery  but are changed by the charm of the inhabitants of Happy, Texas.
This is  real laugh out loud stuff: Steve Zahn trying to teach kids to dance (based  on an MTv video), Jeremy Northam (in a character that is a million miles  from An Ideal Husband) as the subject of the local sherrif's affections  (played by an always brilliant William H Macy), the theft of the RV (which  gets the main characters into the fix in the first place) and the car chase  (with a tow truck).
The DVD allows you to see the scenes Illsley deleted  and listen to his reasoning. It is easy to see just from this how much  effort went into story and character development. It has certainly paid  off. These are people you meet for 98 minutes but they are formed well  enough for you want to meet them in real life.
I highly recommend  watching this movie and I guarantee you will get one of the best renditions  of Bjork's ""Its so quiet"" you are likely to see.",956275200,34,1297,4.413502109704641

Shot in just 29 days on a shoestring budget, this film's acting, directing, script and comedic timing are so clever and incisive that it has attracted an almost cult following, especially among Steve Zahn fans.

There are plots within plots that all pull together in the end to make a perfect film.

The greatest things about this film were Steve Zahn's acting while trying to teach pre-teen girls how to dance, and William H. Macy's stunning performance as Happy's town sheriff who comes out of the closet.

1080689,5,630576333X,"HAPPY, TEXAS is a delightful film, earnestly and honestly directed by Mark Illsley and acted with professional finesse by a talented cast.

Jeremy Northam, who usually plays stuff-shirt gents (Mimic, Gosford Park) stars as Harry Sawyer, and Steve Zahn, who is proving to be a marvelous comic actor, plays Wayne Wayne Jr., two small time cons who escape from a chain gang.  They end up stealing an RV which is owned by two gay pageant directors, who are delighted to have it stolen.  They head off for an island getaway, waiting to report the stolen RV after the insurance rates go up.  The boys end up in Happy, Texas, where they are greeted by the townspeople who hope that their expertise will help them to the state finals.  Zahn is shocked when he discovers the contestants are little 5 year old girls.  Northam and Zahn go along with the ruse so they can rob the local bank.  But, wait...Northam finds himself falling for the bank's manager, played joyously by Ally Walker.  Zahn meanwhile is falling for the pageant's local director, Ileana Douglas.  Next thing you know, Zahn is making outfits for the girls, and Northam doesn't want to rob the bank anymore.  And if this weren't enough, the town's sheriff, played to the hilt by William H. Macy, comes out of the closet and admits his attraction to Northam.  They go out on a date at a Dallas gay bar, where they dance their little feet off.

What distinugishes this movie, however, is the direction that takes a humanistic, straightforward approach.  When Northam rejects Macy later, it's a poignant and touching scene.  Macy is brilliant in this role, and it is his honest performance that keeps his feelings for Northam real and honest, and not slapstick or comic.  Throw in Ron Perlman in a small supporting role, and you have a movie of rare honesty and emotion.

A hit at the Sundance Festival, it should've done better in release, but at least you can get it on DVD and relish in its

Naturally, the in fact straight Northam falls for the blonde clerk of the local bank while Zahn teaches little girls how to win a beauty contest.

For the past seven years, they've been shamed at the annual Little Miss Fresh Squeezed beauty pageant. This year, however, it's their turn. They're going to make Happy proud. To aid in their efforts, they hired Steven and David, a pair of traveling pageant professionals, who drive from town to town in their dilapidated motor home, teaching little girls to be beauty queens.
Little do the town's residents realize, though, that instead of the homosexual couple they were expecting, they got a pair of escaped convicts (Jeremy Northam and Steve Zahn), who stole the motor home -- and its owners' identities.
The cons, too, have no idea what they've gotten themselves into. So while they try to keep their cover, David (whose name is really Wayne Wayne Wayne, Jr.) teaches a handful of little girls to sing and dance.

Happy is a wonderfully sweet, totally odd little ditty of a film. A FIRST rate cast with an easy directing style filled with very real, funny, quirky and  off the cuff characters that well ALL know. Just look around your own hometown....You know people just like those in Happy....We all do!!
Macy really makes Happy, TX-------William H. Macy is one of our most talented actors working today. I was really hoping for an Oscar nod for his work.

1080783,4,630576333X,"A case of mistaken identity causes concern, conflict and consternation among the residents of a small town in Texas, the results of which are often unexpected but always hilarious, in ""Happy, Texas,"" directed by Mark Illsley.  A comedy of incidents and errors, it illustrates what can happen when trust is placed in the wrong quarter; and interestingly enough, the good things just may outweigh the bad, depending upon which side of whose fence you're standing on at the time.  One thing is certain, before it's all over there are those who will know a lot more about themselves, as well as some of the others in town, and one way or another Illsley makes sure that there's plenty of laughs in it for his audience along the way.
Harry Sawyer (Jeremy Northam) and Wayne Wayne Jr. (Steve Zahn) escape from a Texas chain gang along with killer Bob Maslow (M.C. Gainey), to whom they just happen to be shackled.  When Maslow takes it on the lam, Harry and Wayne steal an RV that belongs to a couple of gay entrepreneurs, David (Tim Bagley) and Steven (Michael Hitchcock), who are en route to Happy to produce a beauty pageant.  For personal reasons, the couple do not report the theft of their vehicle.  Meanwhile, as this pageant is a big event in Happy, the local sheriff, Chappy Dent (William H. Macy), is on the lookout for David and Steven, and when he spots their RV, he personally escorts them into town, where Harry and Wayne (who quickly catch on and become ""Steven and David"") are welcomed and handed some money.  It doesn't seem like a bad gig considering the alternatives, so they take the money and go along; after all, how hard can producing a beauty pageant be?  Suffice to say, being perceived as ""gay"" is going to be the least of their problems over the next few days.  And with that, the merriment begins.
Humor is the main course served up by Illsley in this rather off-beat and quirky feast of funniness, which often takes the road less traveled to come out a winner.  It's a comedy with a twist rarely associated with the prevailing attitudes among the folks residing in the good state of Texas, wherein ""macho"" holds sway and those who wear a badge must necessarily conform to the shadow cast in the image of no less than John Wayne.  With Illsley's offering, however, we get to see the other side of the coin, and it's refreshing, as well as funny.  In the end we realize that ""nature"" will have it's way in every conceivable way, shape and form, and there's no getting around it; it's a little thing called ""life.""  Illsley, though, is not attempting to make a statement with his film, or even send a message of any kind.  This is first and foremost a comedy; Illsley's intent is clearly to entertain and to make his audience laugh, and in this he succeeds.  He begins with an interesting concept, builds a good story and populates it with some bona fide ""characters,"" brought to life by a solid cast of talented actors.
William H. Macy just may be the best character actor alive, and his portrayal of Chappy helps to make the case even stronger.  His resume reads like a who's who of a cross section of the earth's population:  From his memorable turn as Jerry, in ""Fargo,"" to ""Mystery Men's"" Shoveler, Walt the director in ""State and Main,"" Lawrence in ""Focus"" to his poignant and unforgettable performance as Bill  in ""Door To Door"" and everything in-between, Macy makes whatever character he's playing unique, perfect and interesting.  He's a star who can carry a film on his own, or give the kind of support in a smaller role that elevates whatever project he's working on to a higher level; and there are very few actors around who can lay claim to that kind of range and success.  As he does with Chappy, he has the ability to make his characters convincing and entirely real, bringing them to life without any discernible trace of Macy the actor to be found.  Chappy Dent, for example, is a sheriff in Happy, Texas, with no connection whatsoever to a guy named William H. Macy.  It's the highest compliment one can pay an actor, and Macy deserves it tenfold.
In the realm of character actors, it must be noted, too, that Steve Zahn is well on his way to establishing himself among the best of the best.  Like Macy's Chappy, in Wayne Wayne, Zahn creates a character with a decidedly unique perspective on the world and his own place in it.  And, like Macy, Zahn has the ability to disappear into a role.  Consider some of his characters, from Lenny in ""That Thing You Do,"" to George in ""You've Got Mail,"" Fuller in ""Joy Ride,"" to his role here of Wayne, and you would be hard put to find any semblance of the ""real"" Steve Zahn.  He has yet to establish his ability to carry a film on his own, but he has certainly demonstrated how invaluable his presence can be to any film.
Of the entire cast, in fact, it is leading man Jeremy Northam, known predominately for period piece dramas (Mr. Knightly, ""Emma,"" Sir Robert, ""An Ideal Husband"" and Ash, ""Possession,"" for example), who seems to be the fish out of water here.  As Harry/Steven, however, he rises to the occasion and gives a convincing performance that is yet another ""plus"" to the film.  it's a role somewhat against type for him, but he pulls it off nicely.
The supporting cast includes Ally Walker (Josephine), Illeana Douglas (Doreen), Ron Perlman (Marshal Nalhober), Jillian Berard (Maddie) and Paul Dooley (The Judge).  A feel-good film made for fun and frolic, ""Happy, Texas"" may take a side door to the humor, but it finds it and makes good on the promise of what ""comedy"" is all about:  Plenty of laughs.",1032048000,11,5596,4.590361445783133

Visit slightly either side of the city and you find some of the most unique and genuine people in the world....The people of Texas...I learned to keep my mind and my eyes and ears open and have found a little of HAPPY TEXAS in all of us...From the people who work the ranch to the business leaders of the city these people in the movie are right out of the real Texas small town areas...Trusting...loving...and above all ""Dont ask Dont Tell...Wherein lies the reality of Texas, I have heard many great stories about the ""Boys who live down the street"" and the real genuine relationships between neighbors...Where being a good neighbor is all that matters and your identity is not important as long as your ""Good People"".

1080790,2,630576333X,"...""Happy, Texas"" turned out to be just the type of film that keeps you awake while you watch it but is forgotten soon afterwards.
The reason I had wanted to see this film was William H. Macy, who was brilliant in ""Fargo,"" ""Magnolia,"" ""Boogie Nights,"" ""Twenty Bucks,"" and the like. Macy plays the closeted gay sheriff of the small town of Happy, TX, who goes by the name of Chappie. This was the only unexpected twist in the movie--when he ""came out"" to ""Steven,"" or one of the pretend-gay child beauty pageant organisers who come to town. The rest was sort of like ""Waiting for Guffman"" by Christopher Guest, but more slapstick-y, more predictable, and more...well, ""so-what.""
Watch ""Happy, Texas"" on a lazy Sunday while nibbling on crackers or talking on the phone, for that way it will have fulfilled its purpose beautifully.",994550400,,828,4.7972027972027975

A highlight of the DVD was the extra footage and the deleted footage that did not make the movie.  Along with these two features is the directors reasoning for cutting the footage.

How can one possibly PURCHASE a film based entirely on someone else's opinion?  It's beyond me!  We are all ""critics"" - merely giving our ""opinions"" - and 99% of us do not get paid for this act!!  Anyway, since very, very few comedies make me throw my head back and laugh from my ""gut,"" I was so surprised and pleased when this little ""feel-good"" gem did just that!  Steve Zahn's performance is the ""glue"" that holds this film together!  He is zany, sweet, silly, and ""eats up the scenery"" in a somewhat understated way - if that's possible!!  I was surprised to see the accomplished actor Jeremy Northam (""Emma,"" ""An Ideal Husband"") in this small, underrated bit of confection!  But he is the perfect foil for Zahn's craziness!  As has been previously mentioned, Bill Macy is his usual excellent self!  And Illeana Douglas is marvelous (as always)as the frustrated kiddie beauty pageant director and the object of Zahn's  repressed affections!  The scene when these two FINALLY ""connect"" is a stitch, and bears comedic resemblence to the steamy love scene in ""The Postmas Always Rings Twice"" - but without the flour!!  So fellow movie lovers, don't BUY this because I loved it!!  Rent it or watch it on cable, and make up your own minds!!

The two guys who played the pageant directors were so dumb and ignorant, that it insulted me beyond belief.  I had no compassion or feeling for them either way.

1080940,2,630576333X,"Like so many quirky independent comedies of recent years, `Happy, Texas' is a film that does everything but sit up and beg, then roll over and play  dead to be loved. Yet, for all its scattered moments of whimsical charm,  the film merely demonstrates that a cute premise and a genial tone are  insufficient compensation for an underfed screenplay that fails to generate  many substantial laughs.
Since even the premise itself lacks real  freshness, the movie must finally be judged on the quality of its  execution. This is the umpteenth version of that old chestnut in which two  fugitives on the lam find safety by impersonating individuals with  personalities completely antithetical to their own (we've seen them many  times before - disguised as women, priests, nuns, cruise directors, choir  directors, you name it ). Finally unmasked for all to see in their  nakedness and shame, such characters inevitably find their redemption in  the generous attitudes and forgiving hearts of the people they may have  deceived it is true, but also touched in some deep emotional way.
Following slavishly in the footsteps of all these previous films,  `Happy, Texas' fairs badly in comparison since, although it sets up a  situation rife with farcical possibilities, it never really finds the manic  energy or ingeniously convoluted and multi-layered plot structure necessary  to the success of such a film. Steve Zahn and Jeremy Northam charmingly  portray chain gang partners who, suddenly finding themselves escaped  prisoners, stumble into a small Texas town where they are immediately  mistaken for a gay couple hired to direct a little girl beauty pageant. The  scene in which the two macho men discover the `truth' about the men they  are impersonating is genuinely hilarious and betokens many more laughs to  follow. Yet somehow, they never manage to develop. For one thing, the men  essentially go their separate ways during the majority of the film's  running time so the comic tension that exists between them simply  dissipates. In addition, the beauty pageant concept is a dud since having  these girls be of such a young age gives the men's forcibly repressed  heterosexuality no room for comic play. Thus, the comic possibilities  inherent in being a straight man trapped in a gay man's body seem strangely  underplayed and unexploited. Moreover, both the conventional romances  between the lead characters and their respective women and the  `unconventional' one between Northam and the suddenly smitten gay sheriff  (William H. Macy) fail to result in any real sparks or passion. In fact,  the movie as a whole simply lacks energy and imagination.
As director and  co-writer, Mark Illsley ruins many of his most promising comic moments by  relying on overly emphatic reaction shots and routinely holding them for  just a beat too long. More than anything else, movie comedy succeeds or  fails based on the delicate rhythm that is established between the spoken  word and the edited image. Perhaps, it is this lack of comic grace more  than anything else that keeps `Happy, Texas,' likable as it is at times,  from fulfilling the promise of its premise and really soaring into comic  greatness.",964569600,5,3205,5.119922630560929
