I can't describe this move, but it gives you the best example and feel of the DADA movement. I've seen it about 30 times and always see something new, It is that good.",1404172800,2,295,4.103448275862069
7908782,5,B00000G031,"I love film (in general) but ""Germany Dada"" is one of those few films that changed my life.

Randomness, anger, life force and sheer creativity are all the subject and structure of this one-of-a-kind documentary.

Released in the late 60's, it appears to have influenced Terry Gilliam's work with Monty Python in addition to it being a strikingly acute and and incisive artificat of Dada -- its subject and structural inspiration.

The breadth, humor and sheer exhuberance of this film will be appreciated by any art historian, culture jammer, graphic artist, sentient activist or giggling autodidact who may discover it.

Quite rare.  Worth the find.

After watching this for the first time I realized, ""I have been doing Dada all my life.""  May you too be blessed with the same reality.
