8493395,5,B0065IYUCA,"My daughter loved this show when it was on Netflix, but it was removed, so I ordered the DVD set.
It is a region 2 set so I ended up ordering a Region Free DVD player (also from Amazon).  Once the Pioneer DV-420-VK came in, everything is golden.  Arrived much faster than I expected (about 4 business days) so I was very happy with that as well.",1349481600,3,345,4.134328358208955
8493396,5,B0065IYUCA,As expected the DVD is fantastic; the 1st season of Anubis! Unfortunately this DVD is a non-USA/North America Regional Format and must be played in The United Kingdom or change the Region on your PC! Warning doing this may render your DVD Player abilities un-playable for North American Regional DVDs afterward! I'm disappointed that this feature was not made clearer before I purchased...,1329350400,13,389,5.190476190476191
