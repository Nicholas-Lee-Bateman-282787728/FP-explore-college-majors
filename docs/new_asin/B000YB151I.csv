8291149,4,B000YB151I,"A supernatural romance where the dead come back before their 49 days in limbo are up and bring appropriate living beings into their dreams. Dreams, reality, and the supernatural intermingle as the characters learn their lessons and settle scores. It's not a horror flick, just slightly spooky, and includes a little standard Korean melodramatic love. Lucky guy (Kyeong-ho Jeong) is torn between Min-sun Kim and Su-yeon Cha not knowing who is alive and who is dead, including himself. The soundtrack is a little too bold at times, but the cinematography and set locations are wonderful.
