I rather watch this then those dumb, stupid, script realities shows which all need to be taken of the air! I hope Amazon put them all on prime the shows mentioned above I'm ready for another marathon of these type of shows.",1439078400,,404,4.472972972972973

6935655,5,B00RUFITSS,For years I have enjoyed watching this show on television.  I like the reruns and have become very grateful we have a unit in our Country like the FBI!

8695910,4,B00RUFITSS,I am a huge fan of Unsolved Mysteries and Forensic Files. I'm always looking for shows like it to watch. This show has some amazing touching stories.

8695912,2,B00RUFITSS,"The reenactments are pathetically hokey.
I wanted so much to enjoy this show, with so many seasons available here to watch on Amazon.
However, I couldn't even make it through the first episode due to the awful over-acting and staging of the reenactment.
The reenactments should be a very minimal part of this show, and maybe it would work better.
As it stands right now, it's just awfully bad.
Seeing all the high ratings makes me sad that so many people could genuinely enjoy such schlocky, mindless drivel of entertainment.",1484179200,,525,4.844444444444444
