The lyrics are fun and healthy and just what we want for our children to feast on -  real health food for  the heart and soul! Adults love it too! A great gift for any young child  from babyhood on. Guitar, banjo, and keyboard. Catchy ""sing  along"" and interactive songs. The best!",939081600,5,398,4.642857142857143
