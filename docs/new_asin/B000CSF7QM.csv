2472755,4,B000CSF7QM,"I must admit that I'm not a Jackie Chan fan, so I didn't like this movie at first, but quite to my surprise it did grow on me after repeated viewings.

This movie is a rather incongruous mixture of a silly Jackie Chan action movie and a serious ancient Chinese epic.  I suppose the part that grew on me is the latter.  I've always been fascinated by the legends and myths surrounding the as yet undiscovered tomb of the First Emperor Qin of China, and this movie's interpretation of it is spectacular indeed (if you can overlook the silly bogus ""science"" the movie invoked in trying to explain everything, some things are best left unexplained...)  But to appreciate it, I suppose one has to know a bit about the actual legend. e.g. it was recorded by an ancient Chinese historian who lived about 100 years after Qin that 700000 workers labored for 20 years to build the emperor's tomb, and that it was so huge that it resembled an ""artificial universe"".  In the high ceiling were embedded thousands of glittering gems mimicking the constellations in heaven, while on the floor there were rivers of mercury recreating the major rivers in China in miniature.  While the movie took liberties with anti-gravity and other silly things, its depiction of the emperor's tomb is based on historical records.  My jaw dropped when I first saw it :)

As for the rest of the movie, apart of the historical epic part, it's pretty standard Jackie Chan fare: silly story with silly fights and silly gags, and some good-looking babes as eye-candy: including the Chinese debut of Korean beauty Kim Hee-Seon and Bollywood sweetheart Mallika Sherawat.  Chan's acting is sub-par as usual, especially in the romantic scenes with Kim, which suffered from lack of chemistry and credibility (though it's still better than the cringe-inducing ""romantic"" scenes in Star Wars Eps. 2 and 3).

By jarring contrast, the ancient Chinese epic portion of this movie is very serious, so much so that they apparently decided to artificially squeeze Jackie Chan's face (to make him look more serious? more handsome???) whenever he appeared as the Qin general Meng-Yi in the DVD.  And unlike most other Jackie Chan movies, this part of the movie is surprisingly violent and bloody.

As I watched this movie, I kept thinking that this would have been a much better movie if it had been directed by Zhang Yi-Mou and re-written by someone else, and if Jackie Chan's not in it...

For me, the highlight of this movie is the spectacular and imaginative depiction of Emperor Qin's tomb, and for that alone I'm willing to overlook the other weaknesses in the movie.",1138752000,4,2621,4.810690423162583
2472756,2,B000CSF7QM,"I really wanted to like this film.

Hmmm... I liked this better than much of Jackie Chan's recent material, but perhaps mostly because I have a bias for the historical-flavoured films, and I loved the scope that was attempted.  The locations chosen for the film were also quite impressive and added to the potential of this film.

If you're a fan of the ""cute"" factor, whether it be the actresses (whom I must admit are all stunningly beautiful, gorgeous perhaps beyond all reason), or the sugary plotline (except the ending), then perhaps you should see this (be warned about the ending).  There's a bounty of these ""cute"" factors in this movie.  Very entertaining is the sequence in the rat-glue factory, in which all of Jackie's opponents end up in a very...sticky...situation, and which also happens to be a very amusing new take on both the ""conveyer belt sequence"" and the ""disrobing fight sequence"" popularised by films such as The Mask of Zorro.  Let's just say that Jackie Chan must have had a veritable cornucopia of fun filming this picture (at the very least between the actresses who filled his arms this time around).

Sadly, although there are many fight sequences, there isn't too much in the way of truly spectacular martial arts, and even the number of Jackie's usual stunts has been toned down.  Don't get me wrong - there is quite a number of fight sequences, but at least half if not most are far too short.  I did enjoy the nod to ""flying wuxia kung fu"" near the end, but that entire seqence of fights was too sparse, and underutilised in so many ways.  Perhaps Jackie Chan is getting old, but you feel that he is capable of so much more in this film.

Furthermore, the digital effects are, as has been much-discussed,  very obvious and of extremely poor quality for the times, so much so that they cause much unintended laughter.  Notable examples are the horse-kicking action and any sequence involving Jackie Chan and a cliff/mountainface/waterfall.  Again, the film could have been quite a lot better with some more time and talent spent on the cgi effects.

The musical score is well-written and enjoyable.

First and foremost, this has one of the absolute most anti-climactic and unsatisfying endings I have ever seen, after much, much, buildup.  The ending is so anticlimactic and unsatisfying that - should I be satisfied with everything else - I cannot be satisfied with the movie purely due to the ending.  For such a ""cute"" film, it's surprising how un-cute the ending is.  The plotline seems as if the writer ran out of ideas, or simply lost interest and decided to end the film as quickly as possible.  Much of the build-up that takes up the majority of the rest of the film goes absolutely nowhere.  The fight sequence at the end lacks bite.  The plot as written up to that point gave them the opportunity to (at least try) and say something poignant with the ending, give it some more emotional impact, bring to fruition the duality between Jackie Chan's two characters.  All this could have been done even keeping the final epilogue scene as filmed and adding somewhat of a positive ending to it.  I would have counted this film as decently worth watching if the ending had made some sense.  However, the writer saw none of this and chose to end the film in the most nonsensical and wasteful way possible, leaving huge gaping plot holes from the multitude of unanswered questions (how did General Yi's sword end up in India? what was the Genearl's connection to India in the first place? the flashback fight sequence goes unexplained).  With the climax as it was, it left the ending feeling empty.  There is no moment of hopefulness in the epilogue and its attempt at a 'positive spin' is predictable and without any emotional impact whatsoever.  It gives me nightmares how dissatisfying the ending of this film is.

I must make a special mention, however, for the special features included.  There is a huge collection of behind-the-scenes footage, including 10 minutes of fascinating clips on filming the famed hk wirework.  Unlike many action movies, where the dvd only includes behind the scenes segments for one or two sequences in the film, this dvd includes 10-minute clip collections of outtakes and behind-the-scenes clips for virtually every major sequence in the film.  You really feel that you're behind the camera as part of the crew making the film.  While they do not have the polished editing, finish, interviews, or in fact any narration, they are still a lot of fun to watch as essentially a collection of home movies of the making of the film.  You'll be surprised what the actors went through to film the ""ice cave"" sequence... The special features disc is quite enjoyable.

I'm not sure if every disc has this problem, but my special features disc seems to have a defect in the centre edge (or some other factor) that leads it to be somewhat unstable when spinning.  As a result the player in my laptop makes loud vibration sounds when running the disc, and I was worried it might damage the player.  It seems to run alright about half of the time.",1137110400,3,5107,4.742921857304643

2472776,4,B000CSF7QM,"This is one of the strangest films I've seen in a long time, though when I say ""strange"", I don't necessarily mean that in the negative sense. It's entertaining throughout, reasonably well-acted and beautifully shot (despite some dodgy special effects), but the tone and content change erratically over the course of its running time. Switching not only between languages (Cantonese and English) but also from comedy to drama to romance to action to fantasy and then back again, ""The Myth"" is a movie that is difficult to describe. The middle segment in particular feels as though it belongs to another movie entirely, as the director takes a short foray into a Bollywood musical before heading back to the original story.

Jackie Chan plays Doctor Jack Chan (really!), an archeologist who is haunted by dreams of life as a war general in the Qin Dynasty. Whether it is a past life or not remains unclear, but the film interchanges between the contemporary story of Jack's research into a strange anti-gravity substance and the flashbacks of General Meng Yi as he falls in love with the Emperor's beautiful concubine Ok Soo. With greedy corporate villains in pursuit and a physicist friend that might not be entirely trustworthy, Chan's adventure takes him from the temples of India to the deserts of mainland China, until finally the visions of his past love eventually lead him to a vast underground tomb behind a massive waterfall, where he finds an astonishing discovery waiting for him.

There is a lot here to enjoy. Jackie Chan is as charming as ever, and actresses Hee-seon Kim (as Ok See) and Mallika Sherawat (as Samantha) are stunning as the would-be love interests, acting as incentives and aides to Chan's character. Chan's action sequences are not quite as awe-inspiring as those in his hey-day (well, he has hit the fifty-year mark!) but there are still plenty of high-kicks, back-flips, and faster-than-the-eye-can-see sleights of hand that demand a second watch just to fully appreciate them. As has been frequently mentioned in other reviews, the fight at the Rat Glue Factory is the standout of the film, in which Jack, Samantha and several police officials get stuck on a conveyer belt covered in glue, forcing them to lose their shoes and shed several garments in the attempt to free themselves. It's hilariously inventive, and no matter how you feel about the rest of the movie, there's a good chance you'll consider this one sequence worth it.

The minuses mainly have to do with the special effects, which look terrible for a film made in 2005. The obvious blue-screen results in some horrendously bad visuals, not to mention the awfulness of the ""horse-kicking"" scenes, the falling scenes, and the wide-shot battle sequences in which the extras mill about restlessly instead of actually fighting. In fact, most of the story set in the past falls a little flat. The romance between Meng Yi and Ok Soo isn't terribly affecting; it's love at first sight for Meng Yi (before he's knocked unconscious for an extended period of time), whereas Ok Soo only gets to stare longingly at him. By the time the two lovers are floating in an anti-gravity chamber to the sounds of a love song sung by the actors themselves, it's all undeniably cheesy.

""The Myth"" is an uneven film - even a weird one - but there's something fascinating about it, as though it's never quite sure what it wants to be, and so ends up being a little bit of everything. I'd say that the sum of its parts are more than the whole, but it makes for an enjoyable evening of entertainment.",1336953600,5,3572,4.841243862520458

2472780,5,B000CSF7QM,"Jackie Chan stars in one of his most grand and epic movies yet in this exciting action adventure film concerning a modern day archaeologist named Jack Chan who has mysterious dreams of being a great General from the ancient Chi'in Dynasty of China who falls in love with a Princess that he can never have as his own.

One day Jack's friend Tony informs him of an ancient anti-gravity device that can be found in an old tomb in Dasar, India and so the adventure begins. Along the way Jack and his friend get into all kinds of ruckus including lots of the trademark Chan comedy/martial arts fighting sequences, and even some ancient Chinese battle scenes featuring a 1500 person army and over 200 horses. The ancient Chinese costumes of the soldiers look very authentic and beautiful, and the scenery in the film features many wonderful and eye-popping places such as Hong Kong, Shanghai, India, Beijeng, and even the Great Wall of China.

One of the best scenes of the film involves the battle between the good guys and the bad guys in modern day China inside of a huge ancient Chinese Chi'in Dynasty mausoleum hidden within a gigantic enclosed cave behind a waterfall. Special rocks with mysterious powers cause the items within the tomb to be weightless as if in space and this setting is where the the final battle between good and evil takes place.

The movie is loaded with all the great and wild choreographed fighting scenes and zany stunts that Jackie Chan's movies are famous for. It also has a lot of heartfelt and touching moments to it as well, and there's even a love story involved on top of everything else. This movie literally has it all. Theres even a full length commentary from the man himself Jackie Chan as he tells you all about the behind the scenes making of the movie.

If you are a fan of Jackie Chan, or martial arts movies, or even action adventures, then you will not want to miss this great film!",1285027200,9,1926,4.590116279069767

The scene changes are masterfully done, tieing the one into the other with the same shot.  If you think that having a General as a leading character means it's a war movie, you're wrong.  This is a beautiful love story, first and foremost, with some action and ancient war scenes thrown in for good measure.

The film combines romance, drama, action and adventure in an effort to follow in the footsteps of other great Chinese films of recent years.
The film goes back and forth between the present and the past, however, it might as well have remained in the past as most of what occurred in the present either did not make much sense or it was badly done.
The setting, costumes, the music, and the battle sequences are great, though the acting, the plot, and the ending (!) were mediocre, average, and way below average respectively.

The modern character (named Jack Chan, for some reason) awakens each morning even more certain that some reality underlies that dream.

The dramatic buildup falters a bit early on, but really gets moving when his modern benefactor and nemesis emerges from the shadows. Then the race is on, with Jackie/Jack/Yi and sidekick traveling the east in search of - well, that seems a bit murky. Along the way, Jackie executes some of the funniest martial arts choreography ever. The gorgeous babe on his side trip to India gets a few good kicks in, too, not least in that hilarious routine on the conveyor belt.

The final sequence combines a James Bond setting with flying warriors from the wu shia tradition. It also reaches into bits of Taoist alchemy that Western viewers might not recognize, but don't need to. This never rises above the ""good entertainment"" category - but it does offer good entertainment with a delicious non-Western flavor.

I think this movie does a beautiful job blending the old-school and the modern, the ""art house"" style and the ""Jackie Chan over-the-top martial arts"" style.

The ""Jackie Chan"" modern stuff takes place more-or-less in the present day, where ""Jack"" has strange dreams of ancient China and a beautiful princess. The ""art house"" stuff is packaged in flashbacks and visual exegesis about the ""actual"" events Jack is remembering from a past life. Eventually, the two worlds / times collide at the end of the movie.

Quite an enjoyable piece of work. I didn't even realize it existed until my roommate bought a copy at Hollywood Video. I decided I needed my own copy (being both a Jackie Chan fan and an asian ""art house"" cinema fan).

 When I saw this movie for the first  time I was very disappointed. It is not bad, but at the same time it is in no way in shape or form good. I am a big fan of Jackie Chan and loved his next work Rob b Hood. However this film lacks in ten different places. It's almost laughable how unprofessional this movie is. I saw clip art and a preview before I saw this movie and it looked pretty good.

It's three things you will notice when you watch this movie. One - they need a bigger budget ,two- they need a different director and three -they need a different screen writer. The only good thing about this movie is Jackie Chan and  some of the fight sequences. I found this movie very cheap looking. It's kind of like a very low budget Hero. If Jackie would have got Tsui Hark to write it and Yuen Woo Ping to direct it. This movie could be much better. One thing I really like about this movie is the commentary Jackie Chan does. I always look forward to listening to commentary by Jackie Chan. One thing he reveals is that there was not a big budget. That make me wonder why would he even try to make a movie like this with such a small budget. The reason why I sound so disconcerted is because I keep thinking about The Myth that could have been a classic.",1198800000,6,1290,4.107142857142857
2472798,5,B000CSF7QM,I really enjoyed this film and so did my kids.  I heard about this film through a friend of mine and I must say that I was pleasantly suprised. The acting was pretty good and so were the action scenes. I would love to have seen this movie at the theaters.,1198195200,21,255,4.0
2472799,2,B000CSF7QM,the rental. It was just boring and terrible. The acting stank and the dialogue won't keep you glued to the screen. I don't recommend this movie to anyone.,1197849600,,154,4.535714285714286
2472800,2,B000CSF7QM,"Jackie Chan's The Myth has two great action sequences and a couple of super-hot chicks...and that's about it. I've seen the original Chinese cut and I've seen the shorter US version, and my opinion of both is about the same--the longer version just has more dull stuff in between the sequences of cool stuff.
However, this movie has major story problems that have nothing to do with editing. The biggest story problem is that the most interesting, most fun character in the movie, an incredibly gorgeous kung fu fighting Hindu chick, well-played by Mallika Sherawat, is only on screen for about 12 minutes in both versions! The sequence she's featured in really works, as her natural comic style fits in with Jackie's slapstick action sequences very, very well. His character should have met her much earlier in the story and then she should have stayed with him throughout the rest of the adventure, adding more fun, a touch or romance, better story development, and some sex appeal.
A secondary story problem is that the ""ancient China"" sequences are slow and dull. I wish the US version had cut those parts down even more and given us a 1 hour 20 minute movie.
A third story problem is that the sci-fi/mystical elements of the story are, to be blunt about it, idiotic, resulting in dialog like ""Science has proven that spinning an object extremely fast makes it lighter."" Wha? I read Science Digest, and that's never been mentioned.

So, I think there is about 30 minutes total entertainment in this mess, but it is worth the time for the true Chan fan.",1195084800,16,1556,4.74169741697417
2472801,5,B000CSF7QM,"Know anything about Indian martial arts?  Nope!  I don't either, and yet, we all know they exist.  What brief information about them as given in this film leaves one wanting more.  The story in an interesting flip-flop from the past to the present.  Jackie is at his quirky best in this interesting film.  A good one to see if not to own.",1184544000,,338,4.370967741935484
2472802,4,B000CSF7QM,"As a Jackie Chan fan, the Myth didn't get me too excited when i first heard about it, but then again, it's not like I ever had hope of getting a copy in Canada anyways.  But years later, and my interest in Jackie Chan renewed, I aquired a copy and finally got to see what this movie was all about.

In a nutshell, I enjoyed the movie and it didn't leave a bad taste in my mouth.  It's a movie unlike any he's ever done before, and the production quality is really fantastic (at least compared to other Hong Kong movies of the past).  The movie is really two movies intertwined.  One of the present (where Jackie plays an ""Armour Of God"" type character and one of the past where he plays a general in an army.

What I liked about this movie:

I liked how they dubbed Jackies General character over with another actor to further bring the idea that they are two different people.  The voice used for him is perfect in every way and I just love the way he speaks.  If this voice was used to speak english it would sound really awkward and unatural.  With Cantonese, it's absolutly stunning.

The movie also has some really classic and unique Jackie style fight scenes with his trademark comedy thrown in.  It's not really that dark of a movie at all, it just seems like it could have used more development with a bunch of characters. I guess that even though it's a pretty decent length movie, the two stories have to share time with each other.

There is alot of wirework in this movie in a kind of Crouching tiger fashion, but I think it suits the type of movie it is.

At any rate I recommend this to any Jackie Chan fan to see at least once in their life.",1171929600,3,1656,4.232484076433121
2472803,3,B000CSF7QM,"This film is like a small, flaky, pastry. It is nice and enjoyable, but doesn't leave you entirely satisfied if you were looking for more than light fare.",1157241600,,154,4.535714285714286
2472804,1,B000CSF7QM,It wouldn't even play on my DVD player.  So basically it was a total waste of my money.,1150070400,,87,3.8333333333333335
2472805,5,B000CSF7QM,"This is one of the greatest epic love story of all time!

The immersion factor of the love story is wonderful, and the 'feeling' of love is pretty darn real, someone unique not found in most love stories.

Feel free to email me @ bochen02@gmail.com if anyone has more information on the rational behind the epic love story / plot in MYTH. It'd like to hear an enlightened perspective on why the movie ended the way it did. Jackie Chan's own website doesn't go into the philosophical aspects of the love epic and I find that a little disappointing, since I would have to either figure it out on my own, or seek other people's opinions.

In particular, even if the Jack was a reincarnated version of General Meng Yi, why would Princess/Concubine Ok-soo not follow him out of the collapsing cave? I could understand her reasoning that its not the `actual' person General Meng Yi, but it IS his soul, so in essence it's still Meng Yi, because there is no other in the universe that is or could ever be more like the original Meng Yi. And since Ok-soo somehow has the dedication and conviction to persevere for all eternity waiting for him, it would seem silly that she would have found him (his soul, and thus the `essence' of Meng Yi) at long last and refuse to go with him. So she kept her promise until the end, waiting for the Meng Yi she now knows will never come, and gets here original wish of death 2000 years later being crushed by falling rocks inside a massive cave.

Or maybe Meng Yi did keep his promise. For the short period of time that Meng Yi spends with Ok-soo alone in the cave, perhaps Meng Yi used Jack's physical body in order to finally be with Ok-soo again? Maybe the whole reason Jack gets all these weird dreams was because Meng Yi had to keep his promise to Ok-soo, and he had chosen Jack to be the medium to use his body to get to Ok-soo. So in that case Jack is not the Meng Yi reincarnated at all, but rather the spirit of Meng Yi has temporality usurped Jacks body so that two could be together for a short while. So they both kept their promise. Ok-soo waited for Meng Yi for 2000 years. (Personally I applaud both Ok-soo and that soldier protecting her inside to cave for not screwing around with each other, cause 2000 years inside a damn cave with nothing to do can get quite frustrating, but I guess after about the first 200 years they got used to it) Meng Yi's general kept his promise. And Meng Yi himself kept his promise too, he did come back, he just didn't specify for how long.

They (Ming Yi and Ok-soo) lived a lifetime in the few moments they had together before Meng Yi's spirit disintegrated back into the death of which he came from, and Ok-soo and the Qin era soldier died in the caves. In the end this is what would have happened had Ming Yi not have been killed on the battlefield that fateful day 2000 years ago. He and Ok-soo would have been together, be happy and in love, and eventually they would have both died, except it turned out to be prolonged for two millenniums and the happily ever after stage was cut short. But they got what they wanted. So good story.",1140998400,10,3117,4.339622641509434
8101738,5,B000CSF7QM,"Excellent Jackie Chan flick.  If you aren't a fan of English dubs than you will need to bear with it through some parts due to kinda grimacing voice acting.  That being said, the storyline is good and was not disappointing.  It felt a little ""zoomed in"" at the beginning but you get used to it within a few minutes and I didn't notice it as much at the end.",1519257600,,357,4.144927536231884

8101740,1,B000CSF7QM,"Don't get me wrong. The original 122 min version still remains as one of the best Jackie Chan movies.. The fighting scenes are intense and spread through out the movie in a good rhythm. The edited version Amazon has is like a desk without 2 legs.. The movie lost its most essential moments and is not worth watching. Make sure to watch the 122 min version, it is so much better.",1505433600,2,378,4.338028169014085
