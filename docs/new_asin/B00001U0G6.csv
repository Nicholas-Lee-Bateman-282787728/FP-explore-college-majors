7914766,5,B00001U0G6,I like some action movies. I like this one. It is like a James Bond movie and I like James Bond movies.,1355443200,,103,3.727272727272727
7914767,1,B00001U0G6,"duh. The comic relief is more parenthetical  than the  devoided story line, and that is a very generous. Is this a movie? Perhaps it is a new art form, beyond movies.
I liked McColm in NIght Man.
 What is  talented Amanda Pays doing in this movie?",1226448000,,247,4.304347826086956
7914768,1,B00001U0G6,"Let me say this: If you are considering purchasing this film, then I will let you make your own decision. This is simply my opinion. Subterfuge is miserable, and it is not worthy of any of your money. The Action Channel loops this movie over and over, thus proving they assume the viewers have poor intelligence as well. Well, as a viewer I can tell you I am disgusted. There is a reason why this thing is only on VHS and not DVD and that is because it shouldn't be a DVD. As for the people who made this movie, well they have been paid so they don't have a reason to worry. But for those who haven't benefited from the production of this film, I must warn you that you will not gain anything by buying it either. Instead you will waste money and valuable time. I don't care how much you are paid an hour at work, THIS film is not worth an hour of your time. Even if you are paid minimum wage, this movie is still not worth 3 minutes of your time. If you are bored enough to consider watching this thing, call the boss tell him you are working early/late and go to work. Jobs can be miserable, but at least you are doing something constructive with your time.",1122768000,4,1159,4.155555555555556
7914769,3,B00001U0G6,"Jason Gould, the son of Barbra Streisand and Elliott Gould, shows up as a computer nerd with a jock brother in this mildly diverting action flick. Brother Jonathan (hunky stuntman Matt McColm) is forced into a covert action to retrieve the black box from a downed airliner, because if he doesn't help brother Alfie will go to jail for computer hacking. Head honcho Glynn Turman (Room 222) forces operative Hensell (overplayed by Richard Brake) to coerce McColm into helping. McColm is given a partner played by the always lovely Amanda Pays, and they're off to the Black Sea to find the Black Box!

 Pacing is erratic and there's too much ""down time"" but McColm and Pays make an interesting pairing and Gould seems to be trying out some of his mom's mannerisms and affectations, but he is funny once in a while.

 Certainly not one to make the classics list, but it's fun to watch.",1090540800,3,881,4.664516129032258
7914770,2,B00001U0G6,"Subterfuge is really bad, but the reason it's worth getting is because first it's ten dollars. But second, and most important of all is because Amanda Pays is in it.
If your a fan of Amanda Pays then Subterfuge is worth it. Highlights are of Amanda Pays turning around a motorcycle while someone is driving the motorcycle with her on it. And, when Amanda Pays Suits up in a wet-suit at the end of the movie. That's it.",1018051200,4,418,4.371794871794871
