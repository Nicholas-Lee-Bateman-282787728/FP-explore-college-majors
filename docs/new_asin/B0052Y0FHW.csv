8454721,5,B0052Y0FHW,"I thought  A Pink Floyd Odyssey was trippy enough,but this is a great effort at co-ordinating 2001 with Bowie's songs. I liked ''Let's Dance'' playing over Frank's death,the words actually match what you see-''red shoes''=Dave's red suit,''radio''=HAL's control panel,''color lights up yor face''=pod lights reflected on Frank's visor,and ''look into my eyes''=when we see HAL's eye lens looming closer. Only song missing is Life on Mars,oh well,Jupiter was their destination!",1427500800,,476,5.8
