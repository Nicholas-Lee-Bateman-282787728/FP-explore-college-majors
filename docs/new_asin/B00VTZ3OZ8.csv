7108798,4,B00VTZ3OZ8,Nice story.  Love wins out.....,1437177600,,31,5.2
7108799,2,B00VTZ3OZ8,"The synopsis for this film is that a `hot, young' newspaper writer attempts to shake off lost love by following a party organiser around in order to write a piece on him. Evan is the newspaper guy but I missed the lost love thing. He just seems to write about ordinary people for his gay magazine - some of the interviews were the best part in this less than average offering.

Hunter is the party planner who seems to combine hedonism with good old down to earth capitalist principles. There is no chemistry here - unless you include the occasional references to drugs and for a relationship movie that kinda means it falls at the first hurdle.

His pieces for this unreadable mag are frivolous mostly and there is no attempt to examine any gay issues at all, and I sort of blinked and missed the bedroom bits. When it ended I had a mixed feeling of relief and regret. Relief that it was over and regret for having bothered watching it. I then tried to work out what the whole point was about this and had not got a clue. I can not think of anything to recommend this;  you are better off going to `seek' something else out - for a great Canadian slice of gay life check out `Coming Out'.",1433548800,9,1189,4.322869955156951
7108800,5,B00VTZ3OZ8,"This is a wonderful thought provoking story with flawless performances. This is beautifully directed. An exploration of life, love, passion, and the emotional reality of companionship. The growing relationship between Ethan and Hunter is priceless. The growing aspects of love or passion, makes you giddy with fluttering butterflies in the ideas of love, and the companionship everyone wishes. The strong manly arms of warmth, next to the soft bosom and exploration of love.

Gorgeous and beautiful are the actors Adrian Sheherd Gawinski and Ryan Fisher. Both the main characters quickly grow on you. Both give off vibes of heat inducing perfection. The story weaved around excellent acting and ultimate chemistry leads the viewer into a viewing bliss. I have to mention this is Gawinskis first feature film as an actor, another unbelievable reality about this film, because he owned and sold his character.

A great example of a simple and down to earth story, that every watcher can relate to. The players in the story grow on you and become apart of you, as if you are there, or as if you are the main characters. The story makes you think. It makes you realize your inner-self. It transcends thoughts and questions.

Directed by Eric Henry who also wrote it? This is Henrys first film in direction and writing. Amazingly crafted with mastery and film excellence. Floored at this being his first film. He aced it in so many ways. I loved this movie, felt this movie, became a part of this movie, and was in cinema bliss watching it. Cant praise, or say enough about it. I think this is a wonderful drama, one to see and experience.

7108805,1,B00VTZ3OZ8,"Not the worst film I've ever seen, but close.  The plot was confusing (assuming there actually was one); the acting was terrible; and there were far too many scenes that were unbearably long and drawn out (to the point of the film coming across as some sort of low-budget documentary).  On the plus side, the actor who played Evan was attractive.",1448496000,8,346,4.655737704918033
7108806,1,B00VTZ3OZ8,"Just finished watching ""Seek"" released by TLA Releasing.
Convoluted is the best way to describe this thankfully short movie - clocking in at 77 way too long.
Evan, a young gay magazine writer, is hoping to break into the journalistic big time and get hired by Canada's leading daily newspaper. The editor offers him instead a chance to prove himself by writing freelance articles - his first assignment is an article on the city's night life and those who make it a partying place when the sun goes down.
Enter Hunter - the top party planner in the city.
Naturally Evan, who is still smarting from a breakup, meets Hunter for this article and begins a series of interviews with Hunter and his team of party planners. Pity there's not characters that the audience can root for.
""Seek"" is supposed to be a ""fresh and innovative"" look at gay life. If so, then the convoluted plot twist that attempts to make ""Seek"" an intense psychological ""anything to get my name in the papers"" stalker drama makes complete and utter has of this movie.
Not Recommended!
