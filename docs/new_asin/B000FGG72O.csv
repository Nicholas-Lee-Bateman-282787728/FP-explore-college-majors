2565257,5,B000FGG72O,"Maggie Cheung's character Emily Wang, has just about hit bottom.  Things couldn't get much worse, as she bounces from the kindness of one acquaintance to the next.  She's a has-been with a hellish addiction, her famous husband is dead, she's broke, fresh out of prison, and nearly everyone has written her off - except the one person who needs her the most.

Not a stereotypical junkie, her character at least seems honest.  Her hard edge and abrupt uncouth isn't manipulative.  She is beautiful, stylish and hip, and as she falls slack, she drops the needle with a manicured hand.  Despite her dignity, she is clearly in pain.  Maggie Cheung brings depth to her character.

The magic happens when Emily is transformed.  The only thing that she wants more than heroine is to be able to love her child.  She blossoms.

My heart melted when her child's grandfather, played by Nick Nolte, looked her in the eye and said, ""People can change.  If they have to.""  It is the hope, the courage, and the love, (not to mention Maggie Cheung and Nick Nolte's top-notch performances,) that makes this movie one of my all-time favorites.",1206576000,2,1124,4.761658031088083
2565258,5,B000FGG72O,"""Clean"" is a striking and touching film that turns around the progressive transformation of woman from Chinese origin, who loses the custody of her own son after his husband (a famous rock star) dies from an overdoses.

The tragedy has several plots, the main hast do with her and her social environment. The initial contact with the fathers of his husband, (superbly performed by Nick Nolte), her decision of living in Paris trying to recover a new life and the enormous internal conflicts respect her previous dependence. On the other hand the implacable opinion of the grandmother of this child who induces him to think she was the real guilty of his father's death, and finally the clever steps made by the grandfather (Nolte) when he has to move to London in order to deal with the future release of three albums of his son.

What it shocks and engages from this picture is the extraordinary, fluid and organic script, the horrid situation she must surmount in order to deserve a minimum of respect before the society, her son and herself.

The suggestive end is arresting suggesting us she won at last the expected possibility to win the custody due the imminence of death of their parents in law.",1179705600,3,1203,4.746411483253588
2565259,5,B000FGG72O,"Maggie Cheung delivers a knock down stand out performance as Emily Wang in `Clean', a brilliant film that exposes the changes one will make for the sake of a child.  Emily Wang is a drug abusing musician living with her partner Lee (James Johnston).  They had a child together, Jay (James Dennis), who is living with Lee's parents Albrecht (Nick Nolte) and Rosemary Hauser (Martha Henry).  Lee's friends hate Emily and feel she is holding him back from what he could be.  I get the feeling she's the Yoko to his John.

After Lee overdoses on the drugs Emily purchased she's faced with a dilemma.  She's facing six-years in prison for possession, but even more so Lee's parents are requesting she stay away from her son, for his sake, and at the moment she agrees.  She's not in any position to care for a child.  After her release she struggles to stay straight, struggles to hold a job and she begins to realize her sole purpose is to be fit to care for her child, so that she can see him again.

The transformation Emily undertakes is a beautiful and inspiring thing to watch.  Maggie is completely devoted to her character and she shows so many emotions, from complete selfishness to utter selflessness covered in vast amounts of guilt.  Nick Nolte is also brilliant here.  His sympathy for Emily is heartwarming, and his depression over the loss of his son is shown in his attachment to his grandson Jay.  The final frames of this film will truly touch you, hold you tight and prove to you the power of change and the ability to do so when the ones you love most are affected.",1160697600,3,1580,4.52112676056338
2565260,5,B000FGG72O,"Clean is an enjoyable multicultural experience with three languages, a variety of locations (Paris, London, Canada and finally California) and plenty of emotional conflict to keep you intrigued. This is a story of hope in a world where a mother's life spirals out of control as drug addiction attempts to thwart her future happiness.

Maggie Cheung's overwrought performance lends instability to her character's future. As Emily Wang, she excels at sorrowful emotions and hopelessness balanced by a small light of awareness. She has lost everything after her husband dies and her music career seems to be over, due to misconceptions.

Emily progresses through the stages of complete renunciation of cultural norms to a more balanced lifestyle. We watch her soul being born into a new world where she can express her creativity and feel fulfilled as a mother. The story gains a sense of reality through the use of real musicians and especially realistic settings like train stations and even a trip to the zoo.

 Nick Nolte gives a sensitive and wise performance as the forgiving father-in-law. He seems to not only look after Emily's young son, but he becomes an angel to his daughter-in-law who struggles to re-establish herself in the world.

If she can turn her life around or give up her addictive lifestyle, she may get what she wants in the end. Her struggle is a profound and moving example of what you have to do to overcome addictive behaviors. In the end, this movie is as much about creating music as it is about creating your life. This is the hero's journey from a female perspective and I truly enjoyed seeing a woman make difficult and life-changing decisions that led to very positive results and life affirming moments.

2565261,3,B000FGG72O,"this is a no-big-deal movie. trying to portray the struggles of a bunch of song writers and singers who messed themselves up with drugs, endless chain-smoking. all the songs(if you could call them songs) in this movies were so bad. no wonder these people were losers. we simply couldn't feel anything about this drug addictive female singer/mother. the screenplay was a quite a loose and failing one.",1156723200,,400,4.985074626865671
2565262,4,B000FGG72O,"""Clean"" is the second film that director Olivier Assayas wrote with actress Maggie Cheung in mind. When they first collaborated on 1996's ""Irma Vepp"", Cheung was a big Hong Kong movie star whom Assayas didn't know well. Now Cheung is Assayas' ex-wife (their divorce was finalized during filming), and ""Clean"" provides her an opportunity to create a more intimate portrait. The result is one of the most striking performances of 2004, for which Maggie Cheung won a Best Actress Award at the Cannes  Film Festival and a French Cesar nomination in 2005. Cinematographer Eric Gautier was likewise honored with a Cannes win and Cesar nomination. ""Clean"" is a French independent film but has a wonderful international quality -due to its diverse cast and locations- without sacrificing its clear sense of place in Canada and Paris, France. Assayas cast real musicians wherever he could, in keeping with docu-drama and neo-realist traditions of populating movies with authentic supporting players.

Lee (James Johnson) is a talented rock musician and songwriter whose career has fizzled in part due to a heroin habit. His junkie wife Emily (Maggie Cheung), an aspiring singer, is argumentative, unrealistic, and generally hated and blamed for Lee's demise by his friends. When Lee dies of an overdose, Emily is busted for heroin possession. When she gets out of prison, Lee's father Albrecht (Nick Nolte) is kind to Emily but asks that she not make any attempt to see her son Jay (James Dennis), whom Albrecht and his wife Rosemary (Martha Henry) have raised since Emily and Lee abandoned the boy on account of their itinerant, wasted lifestyle. In no position to take care of a child anyway, Emily returns to Paris, where she had a career and good contacts in the entertainment industry. Trying hard to stay off the drugs and hold down a job, with uneven success, Emily decides that more than anything she wants to see her son.

Emily is not likeable. She is needy and tenacious. She makes bad decisions. She's not sure if she'd rather have a settled, safe life or be a junkie. But she knows she wants to know her son. Somehow her desire to connect with Jay and her struggle, though not always triumphant, to normalize her life reaches out to the audience. Emily makes things difficult for herself and for those around her. She's not someone I'd want to be around in real life. But she is fascinating and empathetic in this film. Nick Nolte deserves praise as well for his craggy, perceptive grandpa, who is intimidated by children but loves his grandson and reaches out to Emily. The odd cast of characters who are Emily's circle in Paris make an interesting tableau. They are vivid enough to keep us interested in a lot of scenes that are superfluous. Vibrant writing by Olivier Assayas keeps ""Clean"" from resembling one of those plodding, overbearing ""portrait of a junkie"" films. In English, French, and occasionally Cantonese with English subtitles.

2565263,5,B000FGG72O,"My review title is a little deceptive-Maggie Cheung is always at her best,even in films which aren't that good-she's made a phenomenal number of films(80 something)in a relatively short span of years and I've never seen her turn in a substandard performance-Clean is well-directed,has excellent cinematography(particularly the early scenes in Hamilton,Ontario),good location shooting and an interesting story that doesn't try to overreach itself by trying to be more than what it appears to be-the effects of irresponsible living on a number of lives-Nick Nolte turns in a terrific sensitive performance which is somewhat different from what he is generally known for(although he reprises a similar mood in The Beautiful Country) and the rest of the cast is competent and believable. Maggie Cheung may well be the most versatile actress in the world-she's played every imaginable role-as much as I admire her I wouldn't recommend that she should make any more films that involve her singing-no one can be talented at everything.",1153180800,4,1028,5.391304347826087
2565264,3,B000FGG72O,"The best thing about ""Clean"" are the brilliant performances from Maggie Cheung and Nick Nolte.  There's a vulnerability yet sharp edgeness to Cheung's performance.  Nolte provides a sense of purity in his acting.  What I mean by that is there's nothing overdone in his performance--it's clean and simple.  What I didn't like about ""Clean"" was the fact that it tended to drag at times--especially when the Cheung character relocates to Paris.  What's her conflict?  To clean up her act so she can see her kid?  That's not much to base a film on.  Nor is it anything new.  I think ""Clean"" needed a better story arc.  And the lesbian angle was totally unnecessary.  It didn't add anything to the story.",1152403200,2,699,4.741666666666666

8122348,2,B000FGG72O,"The acting is just ok. Storyline only somewhat interesting: it aims to draw empathy for an addicted rock stars's wife who is attempting to come clean to re-establish a relationship with and take custody of her son. What is revealed is a character who is rather unapologetic and self-absorbed even as she finds herself forced to rely on other people.  While this may reflect the typical psyche of an addict, it's unsettling that despite the character's many acts of selfishness, snobbery, and ungratefulness, she is rewarded with kindness, forgiveness and opportunity. The message seems skewed.  Moreover, Cheung's singing voice is actually pretty awful and we're forced to listen to entire tracts of it as if it's impressive. Two stars because Cheung is multi-lingual and easy to look at (even though she comes across as rather spoiled) and because Nick Nolte's performance is superb!",1480809600,,884,5.174825174825175
8122349,2,B000FGG72O,"This movie just failed to connect. Olivier Assayas's ""Irma Vep"" was a master study in the small budget film that focused on human emotions and human interaction. It is perhaps the best of all time in that category. For that one movie, he is one of my favorite directors of all time. However, he really seems to be struggling to find his groove again and the ability to recreate that magic. This movie seems to search and search for it, but never finds the human touch and the lightning in a bottle feeling that made ""Irma Vep"" a masterpiece. The movie kind of wanders aimlessly and seems to have a hard time finding its purpose, it also just feels low budget but in a bad way, like it was limited by its lack of funds, as in some scenes would have popped better if they could have spent more money on them. This movie just lacked the synergy and magic of ""Irma Vep.""",1414195200,,866,4.319018404907975
8122350,4,B000FGG72O,"In Irma Vep (1996) Assayas explored the film industry, in Late August/Early September (1998) he explored literary culture, and in Demonlover (2002) he explored the adult entertainment market. In each of these films he explores the connection between an industry and the particular kind of life that it fosters, and so it should come as no surprise that that is exactly what Assayas does again with Clean (2004) which is about the music industry and the kinds of lives that crystallize again and again within that very particular cocoon.

In the opening sequence, we get our first glimpse of our main characters, fringe rocker Lee (looking like yet another Joe Strummer wannabe) and Emily (looking every bit the part of the eternally young & cool frizzy-haired rock n roll girlfriend), as they exit their car and enter a small club. As soon as they exit the car we hear the opening chords of the song that is playing inside the club. At first the music is merely background, but as we follow our characters into the club the music becomes the foreground and Assayas shifts our attention away from Lee and Emily and onto the stage where the band Metric performs ""Dead Disco.""  We can tell instantly that Assayas loves music and that he understands the excitement of a live show and we can tell that he wants us to direct our attention beyond its cool veneer and tend to its substance as he stays with the band long enough for us to hear two full verses of the song and to gather that it is about the perpetual recycling of the same ideas/materials/lifestyles/attitudes. When the camera shifts back to our main characters  Lee and Emily look like the very rock n roll cliches the song is talking about and we can gather from the substance of their conversation and the conversation of those around them that they are living one of the oldest rock n roll cliches in the book (heroin addiction). The trick then, for Assayas, is to make a film about a rock n roll cliche (addiction) seem interesting and relevant to our lives. Amazingly, thats just what he does.

Very early on, Lee dies of an overdose and everyone (rock press, fans, family and friends) blames Emily because thats what everyone does when a rocker dies of an overdose: they blame the wife or girlfriend. So, in the course of this story, Emily must not only overcome her own addiction but also overcome this stigma, this sense that she has become the very worst kind of rock cliche. Assayas reveals that the road to recovery is fraught with cliches (relapses, dishonesty) but that its also full of interesting insights into what drives musicians to use heroin in the first place (paralyzing insecurity/lack of self-worth). These paralyzing insecurities might themselves be cliches but Assayas shows that each person lives the same cliches differently. With Lee, Emily didn't have to confront her own paralyzing insecurities directly, she could simply escape her own life and disappear into his. But without Lee and his indie legend to hide behind, she has no choice but to confront her own self, however small & seemingly insignificant that self might be, and to find a life and a way to live that is her own. The film thus becomes a record of Emily's quest to find that life (both within the industry and outside of it), and to reunite with her son. In a role that won her a Best Actress Award at Cannes, Maggie Cheung brings Emily's struggle with addiction and self-worth to life. Although it is a story of drug addiction, there are no showstopping scenes, only a series of humilities that teach Emily how to be human again. So this performance is all the more impressive when one considers how much Maggie Cheung does with so little. Cheung does the majority of her acting with just slight changes of expression that signal revelatory internal revisions. And each of these expressive moments are slyly accentuated by Assayas' unusual musical selections (ie Brian Eno's ""Taking Tiger Mountain,"" ""Spider and I,"" ""Jezebel Spirit""...). As subtle as it is, the performance is utterly mesmerizing and unforgettable.

As interesting as Emily's story is, Assayas gives considerable attention to a very strong cast of supporting players (something he does in each of his films). Each of these supporting players are interesting in their own right, each are dealing with their own life struggles, and each contribute to Emily's rehabilitation in interesting and sometimes unexpected ways. Most notable among these supporting players is Albrecht Hauser (Nick Nolte) who plays Lee's father and who is raising Lee and Emily's son Jay. It is he who provides Emily with her best example of how to take an accurate measure of oneself and other people, and how to conduct oneself as an unselfish human being who is capable of caring for and connecting to others. In fact, Albrecht is such an interesting character and so good at connecting to other human beings that he almost steals the show. But just as interesting are a number of other supporting players (Beatrice Dalle and Tricky and David Roback among them) whose lives exhibit varying degrees of (romantic and/or professional)adequacy and inadequacy, function and dysfunction. From the supporting players she finds examples of how to be and how not to be. In Demonlover, Assayas examined an industry that seemed designed to amplify our most dysfunctional and dehumanizing urges (and there is a hint of that world in Clean---in the lesbian power struggle between Irene and Sandrine which echoes a similar one in Demonlover), but here he examines a much more functional and humane industry (or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that he focuses not on an industry but on select individuals both inside and outside the industry) that seems set on cultivating our higher qualities and impulses. The result is a film that functions as a kind of guide to functional living within a largely dysfunctional world.

Irma Vep is the most entertaining of Assayas' films, and Late August/Early September is perhaps the most personal, but this one is probably the most satisfying (plus it features an incredible soundtrack laden with early Brian Eno). Not to be missed.

Also not to be missed: Summer Hours (2008) and Carlos (2010).",1364947200,,6228,4.875354107648725
8122351,3,B000FGG72O,"Nick Nolte was superb as a grandpa with his hands full of life's issues. However, the story was too mundane for me.
The irresponsibility of adults who refuse to grow up and then the desire to get return on zero investment I always find annoying.
Yet, I guess that's what makes us human. A desire for redemption and second chance. The scene where the protagonist reaches SF and looks at the bridge and her breaking down in tears was the most telling part of the entire movie. Especially when she looks at the cup of coffee and feels the warm reassurance that radiates from the silent cup, by the California bay. Wish I could give it four stars, but the story and the script was not strong enough. It was done more in a French style, and I am slightly subjectively biased against French mode of storytelling.
Other than that, it's a OK show.",1336694400,,839,4.454545454545454
8122352,4,B000FGG72O,"Maggie Cheung plays a junkie rock ex-semi-star.  Her common law husband, also a never-quite-made-it rocker in decline dies of a heroin overdose.  She spends 6 months in prison for possession.  Meanwhile her young son is being raised by her dead husband's parents.

Nick Nolte, as the grandfather does some terrific, nuanced work as a flinty man, with a soft heart.

He won't let Cheung see her son until she gets her life together, which she circuitously
does, weaning herself off drugs, getting basic work, and eventually starting the process of reconnecting to her son, especially as Nolte realizes, with his wife dying, and his own aging, the boy will eventually need his mother.

The film avoids the usual clichs and sensationalism of drug movies - no throwing
up or screaming withdrawals.  It's low key and real, filled with small moments of life
rather than than dramatic highlights.  It's willing to have lead characters who are unlikable
and selfish at times, and yet still makes us care for, and be moved by them.

But there's also a flatness to it.  And a sense of familiarity and predictability to the plot, if
not the execution.  It's great that it doesn't fall into melodrama,  but it feels distanced.  As
one critic put it `it avoids moralizing, but fails to replace it with anything'.  A bit harsh, but
 not without some truth.

Also,  Cheung, while very good in spots, never seems believable as a junkie;  she's gorgeous, healthy looking and luminous on drugs or off.

On the other hand the photography is beautiful, and the score is filled with wonderful and effective music by Brian Eno.

Worth a look for the acting, and the small grace moments throughout.",1308528000,,1675,4.830985915492958
8122353,2,B000FGG72O,"The writing is bad or something. I am lost. I feel cheated. I can't get any emotional connection to this movie. It is like watching a horror movie that is not scary; a comedy that is not funny.

Let me try to understand what this movie is about. It is about a junkie trying to *fight* to get clean. So, she can get her son back. From what I can tell, the junkie doesn't even want her son back at all. It is the grandpa who tries to get rid of the kid. The only person who really wants to keep the kid is the grandma; but grandma is dying. The junkie doesn't even know her son; and the kid doesn't know her mom at all. They are just 2 strangers. I don't see the junkie trying at all.  She keeps on smoking and drinking through out the movie. She cares more about her career than her son. But wait, she doesn't even have a career. No body like her music anyway.

At the end, I feel like the story is just something they copy from a 80's movie called ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Over-the-Top-Blu-ray/dp/B0029O0BKO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Over the Top [Blu-ray</a>]"" with Sylvester Stallone. They upside down the characters and change the story a bit. In the other movie, evil grandpa is trying hard to stop the junkie to get back his son. In this movie, good grandpa is trying to get the son back to the bad junkie.

8122354,5,B000FGG72O,"For a film as crisp and `clean' as `Clean', there is an air of dirt that never seems to leave the audience.  This is a good thing, for with a subject as controversial as drugs and parenthood, `Clean' needs to stir around in the grime of the situation.  Thankfully, our director found that much needed balance between the clean and the grime so as not to create something unnaturally saccharine or too unholy in destitution.  `Clean' strikes a beautiful balance and delivers a tragic yet heartwarming tale of life at its most complicated.

The film centers around Emily, the girlfriend of musician Lee.  When Lee dies of a heroin overdose Emily finds herself incarcerated and, upon release, at the bottom of the totem pole so-to-speak.  Lee's parents basically blame Emily for their son's death (as if he was incapable of resisting drugs while around her) and so she is practically shunned.  What makes matters worse is that Emily and Lee had a son, and that son is now in the custody of Lee's parents who don't see Emily as a fit parent (she's not).

What's a girl to do?

As the tagline for this film suggests, when you don't have a choice, you change.

As Emily struggles to right herself, her father-in-law Albrecht struggles to understand his emotions towards her and his now deceased son.  It would be easier to just write her off as everlastingly unworthy, but with the loss of a son comes the birth of a daughter and so Albrecht finds himself Emily's only supporter.

Some have mentioned that this is not a `new' story, but as I have come to realize there are very few of them floating around here today.  What it boils down to is HOW you tell your story, and this story is told brilliantly.  The script is tightly woven and effortlessly captures the inner struggle, the outer trials and the beauty that comes from triumph WITHOUT ever playing too much to either side.  The acting is such a beautiful thing to witness here, with Maggie Cheung and Nick Nolte delivery some of their finest work to date.  Cheung (who masters multiple languages here) portrays Emily's emotional complexity with an earnestness that is hard to forget.  By sidestepping the clichd breakdowns and theatrics that often litter a film of this nature, Cheung is allowed to develop a natural progression (and display) of pure emotions.  Nick Nolte (at his most reserved and subtle) delivers a breathtaking glimpse at a man defying his personal loss.  He finds a sort of salvation in Emily, or at least in his personal convictions toward her.  By being her sole-support system, he has given himself reason to outlive his own son.

`Clean' is a marvelously crafted and beautifully told story of pain, loss, addiction, love, faith and eventual redemption; and what could be better than that!",1262822400,2,2766,4.756813417190775
