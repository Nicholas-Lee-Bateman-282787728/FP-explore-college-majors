2250080,5,B0007Y08V0,This was a wonderful movie and I enjoyed the sisters in this tell of two spinsters. This was the only site that had the movie.,1358553600,,126,4.08
2250081,5,B0007Y08V0,"This is some of the best work from Phyllicia Rashad and Debbie Allen.  Set in the 1930-1940s, the two sisters live together in Harlem and are working hard to forgive past hurts and to heal from old wounds.  Rashad (Bess) is the older sister who never married nor had children.  Allen (Qwillie) moves in with her after a failed marriage.  Bess agrees to take in a boarder to help with the rent...Bumper Robinson (Husband).  Out of a well meaning gesture comes romance, arguments, and an ending that will leave you in tears!",1355184000,2,522,4.630434782608695
2250082,5,B0007Y08V0,"This is a solid story about two sisters who love each other, but due to one's transgression that hurt the other, there is still an open wound that needs to mend.  A fine, much younger man seems to be the cure for the wounded older sister, but can she compete with the confidence and the schemes of the younger woman he came up from South Carolina to Harlem to find until he found comfort in the old settler.  Debbie Allen and Phylicia Rashad are simply brilliant.  Ms. Allen has a little comic inside.  The handsome Bumper Robinson, who played Jackie Jackson in the movie ""The Jacksons: An American Dream"" plays the mannerly, country bumpkin precisely.  The scene with actress Ella Joyce and comic Paul Mooney gives us the meaning of what an old settler is.  The acting all around is stellar.",1344816000,3,792,4.581560283687943
2250083,5,B0007Y08V0,"Older women, just remember one thing:If a younger man you may be interested in continues to compare you to his mother, be wary. Did this guy want a second mom or a partner for life? I'm not saying younger men and older women are incompatible - but his maturity level would definitely have to factor into the equation. However, I enjoyed the movie. It was funny, very entertaining. There is just something about old-fashioned settings that I adore in movies like this - I guess it is because those values and ideas presented in them are long lost, and we'll never retrieve them, except thru this avenue. LOVED IT!!!",1271894400,2,614,4.6422018348623855
2250084,5,B0007Y08V0,"The was such a great movie to watch, at times very emotional.  I thought both Debbie and Phylicia was wonderful in this movie, but Phylicia deserves an Oscar for the part she played.  Love them both and just wanted to say they did a wonderful job.  Can't wait to see them both appear in something else together.  BIG UPS to both Debbie, Phylicia and the rest of the cast.

2250085,4,B0007Y08V0,These two sisters worked well together. It has the feel of a play but it is a movie. It leaves you thinking about the choices your mother had and how things are different now.,1199750400,,175,4.176470588235294
2250086,5,B0007Y08V0,"""The Old Settler"" will make you laugh,cry and think. It's a love story on several levels. It explores the love between sisters. The last chance at love for an ""old maid"", which is what an old settler is in today's terms. And also the older woman younger/ man love affair. It's both comedy and drama. And don't look for Claire Huxtable. She is not home. This is set in depression era Harlem. And it will hold your attention from beginning to end. A great story with an even greater cast! Kudos.",1177891200,3,493,4.428571428571429
2250087,4,B0007Y08V0,"Phylicia Rashad plays ""the old settler"" (an outdated phrase meaning spinster). In the early 40's Elizabeth (Phylicia Rashad) takes in a young male boarder to help pay the rent. Her querulous sister who also lives with her doesn't like it. Elizabeth is middle aged and he's twenty something. But they fall in love. He has another woman in his life, someone closer to his age. He came to Harlem looking for her. She's changed from a country girl to a worldly woman. Who will he choose?",1154995200,6,483,4.627906976744186

8053762,5,B0007Y08V0,"This is probably one of the finest performances that I have ever seen.  Debbie Allen, Phylicia Rashad and Bumper Robinson transport you back to this place and time quickly.  And even though these women are born sisters the chemistry the two have is phenomenal.  ""The Old Settler"" is about acceptance, longing, heartbreak, and the ties that bind.  I don't want too give to much away.  The heart of this play pumps steady.  All I can say is that it is a great story.",1466467200,2,464,4.530120481927711

8053764,5,B0007Y08V0,This is a very good movie. I saw it when it first came out on PBS.  And they showed it over and over. And I kept watching it. Then finally bought on dvd at Walmart. Excellent movie. It does not disappoint. What is troubling is that Elisabeth wanted to be in love so bad she let this boy use her. He went looking for Lou bessie. A wonderful movie.,1420588800,,346,4.0144927536231885

8053767,5,B0007Y08V0,"Watched this movie years ago, and was so moved, I shared its theme with my best friend, and lo and behold, she had been watching it at the same time.  It was a gem, touching on themes that movies often over look.  Well worth your time.",1401235200,,235,4.086956521739131
