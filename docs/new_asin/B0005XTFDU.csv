8203399,2,B0005XTFDU,"There are a couple of reasons to like this movie.  Land of the Minotaur is shot on location in Greece, so the biggest movie draws are:
1)  The opportunity to showcase some actual historic ruins, castles, local color, landscape, and ""exotic"" atmosphere.
2)  An opportunity to reveal a slice of time when America wasn't so hated around the world, and a brief look at ""free hippie culture"" traveling.

So from an anthropological aspect it's interesting, but only from our current lens.  The sad fact is, this movie offers wooden acting, a thread-bare plot (of sorts), and zero investment in character development.  Quite frankly, I honestly didn't care if any of the main characters lived or died.

Most unforgivably, the ""dark god"" himself was wholly unimpressive, and unworthy of being worshiped.  I couldn't determine ""what's in it"" for the townsfolk/worshipers.",1515283200,,862,5.151079136690647
8203400,2,B0005XTFDU,"This VHS tape is practically unwatchable.  The video quality is so poor it's difficult to make it out, and the audio is so bad you have to turn it up so loud the speaker hiss nearly drowns out the dialog.",1480377600,,204,4.1
8203401,3,B0005XTFDU,"Genre fans should check this ""Wicker Man"" wannabe out. Be warned this is about evil cult worshippers so don't go getting this thinking a minotaur is going to be roaming the countryside. Fine Greek locations and music by Brian Eno.",1455235200,,230,4.775
8203402,3,B0005XTFDU,"I had difficulty deciding between two and three stars for this movie.  However, even though some of this movie is corny and dated, the explosive ending was fun and reminiscent of the Hammer films of the 1950's and 1960's, so this movie gets three stars.

The basic plot revolves around an isolated Greek town.  Young adults, with the young women wearing the short shorts popular in the 1970's, are poking around in the ruins near the Greek town.  Sadly, the local chapter of Satan worshippers takes offense at the young people and incorporates them into their ceremonies, as sacrifices.

A group of the aforementioned young people stops at Father Roche's house, showing Father Roche, played by the late, great Donald Pleasence, a tiny Minotaur statue they found in ruins near the town.  Father Roche, knowing that the people who worship the Minotaur are Satanists and are evil, tells them not to go back to that place.  Since this is nominally a horror movie, telling someone not to do something is horror movie speak for ""go do it.""

The young people return to the town, where the local Satanists, led by evil Baron Corofax, capture them and hold them until it is time to sacrifice them.  Obviously, this would be the end of the movie without someone riding to the rescue.  I will provide more on the rescue after a brief interlude.

The late, great Peter Cushing played Baron Corofax.  The year after Cushing made this movie, he had a relatively small role in the most famous film of the 100+ movies and television shows in which he appeared.  The name of that movie was ""Star Wars.""  Cushing's presence always brings something to a film, even films that are awful.  Though Donald Pleasence and Cushing have few scenes together in this film, I nearly always enjoy both actors.  Without the presence of the two great actors, this film would likely be a one-star movie, or at most, two stars.

Father Roche sets off to the isolated Greek town with a private detective to do battle with the evil Satanists.  People run from here to there.  Mysterious things happen involving the electricity.  People disappear.  It is all fun stuff with a moment of silliness or two.  I must talk about one scene that verged on hilarious.

Father Roche and the detective are in a tavern in town at night.  Several Satanists walk by the tavern and Father Roche clearly sees them.  Father Roche tells the detective to come look.  The detective, who was facing away from the window, slowly gets up from his chair and walks to the window.  In the meantime, the camera shows the Satanists, who were walking past the tavern, running to get out of sight.  By the time the detective gets to the window, the Satanists are gone.

After all the running around, Father Roche and the detective set off to save the young people, who are awaiting sacrifice.  Father Roche arms himself with a travel size bottle of holy water and a huge cross.  Personally, I would rather have had more holy water and a smaller cross, but maybe I am confused with vampire movies.  The detective takes a revolver, apparently without additional ammunition.

After spying on the local Satanists traipsing into their secret enclave, Father Roche and the detective battle the Satanists and their evil flame-throwing Minotaur statue in a battle for the innocent souls of the young people.  Be prepared to be amazed and terrorized!

Much of this movie is relatively slow.  The moments of action are few and far between and I was tempted to speed things up to get through the slow parts.  However, I could not predict when the action would happen, so I watched every moment from beginning to end.

The Minotaur, which shot flames out its nose, appeared every time there was a scene of the Satanists' secret hideout.  I am unsure of the purpose of the flames.  I suspect that the flames were supposed to be a tie-in to Satan.  I kept thinking about ""flame-broiled"" each time I saw the flames and wondered whether the Minotaur might have been popular at barbecues.  The Minotaur also ""spoke.""  I think the speaking might have been telepathy, since the Minotaur is a stone statue.

One thing I did not expect was the ending.  It was, to say the least, explosive.  There is something for you to anticipate.

The quality of the film is acceptable.  This movie appears to be a transfer from a film that has seen significant use, and digital restoration would be helpful.  I had difficulty in understanding the dialogue in a couple of place.  The problem may lie with the original recording, or it could be deterioration of the film.

This movie is one of those that you need to watch with an open mind.  This movie is clearly a low-budget effort, but one with Peter Cushing and Donald Pleasence.  These sorts of movies break little new ground and the primary purpose seemed to be taking advantage of the never-ending popularity of low-budget horror movies.  Yet, I am attracted to them and watch the silly things.  Perhaps I am addicted.  Regardless, I could actually watch this one again because Donald Pleasence and Cushing were fun to watch, and I just have to see the ending once more, perhaps played at a very slow speed (you have to watch to understand why).

I still keep thinking about flame-broiled.

Good luck!",1317427200,4,5255,4.712087912087912
