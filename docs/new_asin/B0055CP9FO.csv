4573001,5,B0055CP9FO,"It's amazing how two people can have virtually polar opposite experiences watching the same movie.  If you like your horror films well-directed, well-acted with bizarre characters, beautifully photographed, with a constantly surprising script, filled with the necessary gore, and yet flecked with bits of quirky humor, you'll love ""The Pack""!  I was totally riveted to the film the whole time - the sets were absolutely outrageous, the editing and the music were excellent (but not intrusive), and the main character, 'La Spack' will not soon be forgotten.  I just watched it streaming online, but I'm going to order my own copy from Amazon right away.  By the way, this film won awards at both the New York City Horror Film Festival (best screenplay, best actress) and Screamfest in Los Angeles (best special effects).  What are you waiting for?  Get it!",1339286400,2,855,5.071428571428571
4573002,2,B0055CP9FO,"If I had known beforehand that this was a French horror film, I probably wouldn't have watched The Pack.  Oh, the French try to make horror films, but they always seem to insist upon filling them with all kinds of weird abstractions and a brooding aura of pseudo-intellectual thought.  Watching one of these films usually feels like watching a 90-minute version of one of those nonsensical Calvin Klein ads from a few years ago -- except there's a lot more blood.  Dialogue seems to be treated as a necessary evil to be used as little as possible.  It's too bad because there are some pretty sick freaks making French horror movies.  Unfortunately, even a gore fest like The Pack leaves me feeling like I'm supposed to do some kind of deconstructive analysis of the central motif for a film class, and that's a feeling that is not conducive at all with enjoyment.

We start with young Charlotte Massot (Emilie Dequenne) who's taking an extended road trip in a beat-up station wagon for no apparent reason.  She wears a leather jacket and smokes, so she's probably meant to symbolize some kind of alienation from modern society or something.  In any event, needing a buffer between herself and a trio of disgusting old bikers chasing her tail, she decides to pick up a hitchhiker.  He eventually leads them to a disgusting little bar in the middle of some trailer park, whereupon he goes to the bathroom and never comes back.  Even though she barely knows the guy, Charlotte never even thinks about leaving; no, she waits around until the middle of the night, so she can break into the bar and search for him behind a hidden door in the bathroom.  Big mistake.  Really big mistake.  Thus begins a nightmare scenario that might be a little frightening if it weren't so darned French.  What happens to this poor girl may not be exactly what you're expecting, though, which is about the only good thing I can say about the rest of the movie.  I take that back - the special effects makeup was pretty good, too.

Not unexpectedly, there is virtually no character development in the film, and we're apparently just supposed to accept the most unnatural of circumstances without question.  I guess I'm not supposed to wonder why so many characters make so many stupid decisions, either - and that's fine because I could hardly care less about any one of them.  As with most of the French horror films I've seen, I think you'd need to be morbidly depressed in order to have the slightest chance of enjoying The Pack.",1338681600,,2508,4.661363636363636
8457870,3,B0055CP9FO,"Although the things that come out of the ground looked pretty creepy and were well done, the movie overall was pretty boring, confusing at times and well, one of those you wished you'd wasted your time watching something else.  Basically a girl driving by herself in the French countryside, gets some unwanted attention from some bikers when she stops to buy something to eat.  Afterwards she notices them in her rear-view mirror and understandably is a bit scared.  Conveniently a hitchhiker is up ahead on the side of the road, so in order to avoid whatever the bikers wanted to do to her she picks him up.  Ultimately she lets him drive for a while and wakes up when he has pulled into some remote backwater diner.  However while they're eating the bikers also arrive where we learn they were much more interested in taking off the pants and having fun with the hitcher than her.  However the old woman  diner owner with a shotgun is having none of that on her property.  The hitcher goes to the bathroom while the driver waits for him.  He never comes out.  When she mentions this to the woman she is told he must have ditched her.  But she doubts that and is determined to find out what happened to him.  Like any horror movie, this isn't a wise decision.",1478476800,,1260,4.502202643171806
8457871,4,B0055CP9FO,"I never knew this French horror/Slasher film existed until yesterday. I love French horror and this one was pretty good. It was a bit muddled in spots but it made up for that with Great acting, amazing creature effects and well done gore.

The story is somewhat formulaic as we begin with a woman driving down a desolate stretch of road,then wanders into an inn where everyone is weird and people go missing. It has a Gothic feel to it which adds to the creepy atmosphere.

From here it gets crazy. There is also a supernatural element to this film that deals with feeding blood to strange ravenous creatures that live underground and come up to feed when the moon is comes out.",1426118400,,678,4.504065040650406
8457872,5,B0055CP9FO,"Dark and original monster horror. Surprises keep cropping up. The characters are all very quirky, which is part of the fun.",1418083200,,123,4.904761904761905
8457873,5,B0055CP9FO,"This is a great horror movie!  Don't let negative reviewers turn you away from this super creepy and weird movie.
The setting is the French country side.  Everything in this movie is dirty, dark, dank and covered with moss.  A tough chick, going nowhere, picks up an unkempt hitchhiker; when the two of them pull into dingy pub for a break, they leave the familiar world behind.
This movie reminds me of ""Rest Stop"", which I also like.",1407974400,,435,4.551282051282051
8457874,2,B0055CP9FO,"Here is yet another French horror about some unspeakable things going on somewhere in the countryside. Compared with such titles as ""High Tension,"" however, ""The Pack"" (""La meute"") is far less shocking, but that really didn't bother me. The problem with the cross genre attempt of writer/director Franck Richard has less to do with the idea of blending two genre templates than it does with the way the idea is executed.

The film begins with a young woman driving alone in a desolate part of the countryside, who picks up a hitchhiker. At a roadside diner the two travelers drop in, things start to look bad, and they get worse when it turns out one of the characters is not what he/she seems.

In adding one big twist to the conventional storyline, Franck Richard successfully surprises us for a while, but soon the potential for something new vanishes, because of the director's unsure hand at the helm. The film includes some absurd moments that are intentionally done, but for what purpose I have no idea.

See, if you notice something strange running wild before entering your restaurant, you will most likely turn back. They don't. The film jumps from one incredible situation to another, often in a most unexpected way. Unpredictability is usually something to be welcomed, but here it only suggests that the film does not know what it is doing.

With the cast that includes talents like Yolande Moreau, milie Dequenne and Philippe Nahon, I would expect something more substantial from the result. The players are all good at what they do. They did not disappoint me. The film did because of its poor storytelling.",1380758400,2,1622,4.844765342960288
8457875,4,B0055CP9FO,"Actually she only picks up a hitchhiker thinking she was going to get trouble from a group of bikers. A great french film that leads you to believe that this is another cannibalistic or sadistic family type of film. A good turn of what the film is really about when the bodies are hung left for dead. This film is up there along with my other favorite french horror films (Frontier(s), High Tension, High Lane, Martyrs, Inside, and Them) just to name a few.",1367280000,5,457,4.4523809523809526
8457876,2,B0055CP9FO,"La Meute (The Pack) (Franck Richard, 2010)

A little over halfway into The Pack, Franck Richard's debut film, it changes from a generic, mindless torture porn film to ""what the hell am I watching?"". Had it stayed there, I think, it could have been at least half of something special--but instead after that first bout of WTFery, the film goes right back to mindless, derivative joylessness, and I started hating it all over again. It never recovered.

The movie begins with Charlotte Massot (Brotherhood of the Wolf's milie Dequenne) driving through a snowy wasteland, where she encounters chilly hitchhiker Max (Stella's Benjamin Biolay). They stop at a diner to grab some coffee and warm up, and find themselves menaced by a trio of bikers who are chased off by the diner's shotgun-wielding owner (Micmacs' Yolande Moreau). However, when Max disappears into thin air after a quick trip to the restroom, Charlotte goes looking for him--and finds that things are not at all as they seem...

...all of which seems very promising, but as I said in the opening paragraph, things go downhill very quickly from there until the scene where you suddenly realize what the title of the movie has to do with anything. You get that amazing WHAT...WHAT moment and start thinking ""hey, there might actually be a movie underneath all the stupid!"" But... no. I wish I could tell you that one scene, and the generally-decent acting ability displayed by both Dequenne and Moreau, makes this worth watching, but again... no. **",1365033600,,1509,4.933070866141732
8457877,5,B0055CP9FO,This one is a nugget for horror film fans.  It has all of the ingredients to terrorize you...make your skin crawl...keep you guessing.  Nothing predictable about this one.  Pure horror.  Loved every minute...from the eery backdrops to the creepy soundtrack.  It reminded me very much of a Stephen King flick...but there was no humor in this one.  Pure horror! ENJOY!  All 5 stars!,1350432000,2,380,4.936507936507937
8457878,4,B0055CP9FO,"I didn't have high hopes for this movie when I sat down to watch it. French films tend to be full go gore but lacking the supernatural element that I am craving underneath.  This movie surprised me and delivered in full.  While the plot wasn't totally new, it was a different take on the zombie craze (zombies, mutants, whatever...they came out of the ground).  Compared to crap like Saw (are there seriously 8 of those stupid movies???) The Pack was refreshing and entertaining.  Worth a watch.",1350345600,,495,4.72093023255814
8457879,1,B0055CP9FO,"These 5 star reviews are absurd.  Don't waste your time or money.  This has to be the worst writing in cinematic history, and I've seen some horrid films.  The characters reactions and choices are so unbelievebale that its annoying, in fact it pissed me off.  How could a writer/director this bad get funding for a move.  Lets have a lady get shot three times and survive.  Lets have a man who feeds people to monsters have a sudden change of heart, and decide to let his mother die.  And lets have a man who is being attacked by mutants calmly read a book.  This was a joke, and whatever twist there was suppose to be at the end made no sense and didn't connect to the movie no matter how you put it.  This movie gives me hope, I now know I could move to France and put those shitty writers to shame.  Watch Prey, that is the only good french horror film I've seen in years.  Or go check out some Korean horror, they know how to do it right.  It serially is not that hard to make a movie that makes just a little sense to audience.  Here we have a copout, the writer doesn't have to explain anything about anything, for the sake of being ""obscure""  well guess what, being unintelligible doesn't make you seem smart.",1345939200,3,1216,4.253275109170306
