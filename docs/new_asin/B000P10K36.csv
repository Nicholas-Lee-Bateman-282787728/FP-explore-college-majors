8188111,5,B000P10K36,"Lurched anew set to replace a broken tape on my old set. Have hated glasses and found this method over 16 years ago. It brings my eyes back about 90%. That seems to get me by for everything I need to do at work, on the computer, etc. A big difference in night vision is important to mention here. That night vision blur while in traffic on the freeway can be scary. The improvement in eyesight helps with this tremendously. You must do this exercise routine daily, but for me not having to wear glasses is so much worth it.",1425254400,,523,4.24
