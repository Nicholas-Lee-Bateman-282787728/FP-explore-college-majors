8392441,4,B000TSJ054,"As a fan of Jack Benny, I have long sought to expand my episode collection, a deceptively complicated endeavor. Often, the same episodes will be released repeatedly on different disks. Sometimes a disk will turn up with all new material, sometimes with one or two episodes you can't get anywhere else. On other occasions, discs composed entirely of episodes you can get elsewhere for a better deal will appear. These disks frequently have no available episode guide, so telling these apart can often be hazardous. Even more confusing are customer reviews meant for one collection that have somehow ended up under another. I, the Jack Benny Trailblazer, through an extended period of careful research, mostly through purchasing the disk on a hunch and seeing what I got, am here to simplify matters.  Below are live links to each Jack Benny collection which I find most advisable to purchase found here on Amazon (although you may want an episode guide, I recommend the one on Wikipedia.org):

Best of Jack Benny (39 Episodes)
The Jack Benny Program: The Lost Episodes (18 episodes)
Jack Benny - Comedy Pack (7 episodes)
The Best of Jack Benny (8 episodes)
The Best of the Jack Benny Show, Vol. 1 and 2 (17 episodes)
Jack At the Races Ed Sullivan/Genieve Show DVD (2 episodes) (Volume 3 of The Jack Benny Collection)

In this two disc set, though many of these episodes are available from other sources, the entire second disk is filled with new material.  In the first episode, Johnny Carson gives some advice to Jack who is subsequently followed home by a mysterious man in a trench coat (20 November 1955, episode 52).  The other episode of the program sees Jack and Ed Sullivan go head to head in a courtroom drama (5 November 1963, episode 211). Also seen on this disk is an hour-long special teaming up Jack, Danny Thomas, and Raymond Burr who has something to say about having Perry Mason preempted for this special (7 November 1959).  These episodes can be found on other collections, but getting them here is by far the least trouble.

You will find reviews like this one for each of the collections listed above.  May it be a useful tool to navigating the murky waters of Jack Benny DVD's. Also, be sure to watch for Jack Benny on Antenna TV.

Good Hunting!
