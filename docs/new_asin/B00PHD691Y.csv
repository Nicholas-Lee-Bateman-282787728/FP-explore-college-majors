6802883,5,B00PHD691Y,"I watched the video ""Into the Wild"" which I found to be a very good story about a young man struggling with the issues he had to deal with inside a very dysfunctional home.  This video brings clarity by giving some insight to everyone involved in the book.  If you have watched ""Into the Wild"", I would recommend watching this video so you can see for yourself the type of parents Chris McCandless (Alexander Supertramp) had to deal with on a daily basis, and the love of a sister that supported him throughout his short life.",1424390400,29,526,4.46875

6802887,5,B00PHD691Y,"Fascinating documentary of Chris McCandless' background and family story, told from the viewpoint of those who knew him. If you read Jon Krakauer's book, Into the Wild,  or saw the movie, you will want to watch this for sure. Sad revelations and very creepy family dynamics. It was amazing and curious to witness his parents overwhelming denials, lack of any emotions, or confessions and self doubts. Very pathological!

6802891,1,B00PHD691Y,"Self-serving repudiation of Chris's story by his abusive father, who directed. This movie looks like nothing more than a platform for his horrifying parents who put their children through what sounds like hell (none of the 7 children talk to the father anymore) and ultimately drove this lovely child to put an entire continent between them in a search for what is right. His mother and father's denials, their self-serving mis-interpretation of his actions and words, and their firm lack of acknowledgement of the story that their children tell make this movie impossible to watch.

Couldn't be more appalled by these parents, who essentially use this platform to call their son and daughters liars for outing abuse that they witnessed  and experienced, and ignore the beauty of what their son did to escape them.",1522454400,,814,5.067164179104478

6802895,2,B00PHD691Y,"This documentary is really just a bunch of Chris McCandles siblings complaining about their childhood and pontificating on why Chris made his journey; casting 100% of the blame for his demise on their parents. I have read the books; I have watched Penn's ""Into The Wild"" and have a grasp on the story from many perspectives. This film was lauded by many reviews as ""the real story"" answering the question ""why?"" Why did Chris venture across the country on self-discovery? I found this film boring; self-serving; and not very helpful in the real message, I think Chris left behind. Simply put, ""Happiness Must Be Shared."" This movie added no value (with the exception of putting some faces with the outlining characters in Chris's life. I liked Penn's Into The Wild because it was ALL about Chris, through the eyes and stories of those Chris actually encountered on his journey.

6802897,5,B00PHD691Y,"I never saw the original movie but I remember hearing about this (my brother and uncle used to enjoy extreme backpacking journeys until my brother passed away in 2009). I absolutely loved this show! My brother's name was Kris and he was so similar to Chris - I cried throughout this movie! Of course I had to watch the original movie when I was done with this one. I was fascinated by the strange family situation - his dad had two separate families, the abuse, his mom's denial - it was sad. But seeing the letters and pictures and the actual bus was pretty spectacular. Great movie.",1517011200,,584,4.4672897196261685

Yes, the guy was a bad dude but that's not what seemed to send Chris into the wild. It was his spirit and strong will. Wanting to live and not just exist. It's a shame his sister's turned it into a movie about domestic violence. If you watch this I recommend fast forwarding through most of the scenes where the sisters are speaking.

6802932,3,B00PHD691Y,"This documentary gives you the ""why"" Chris left society, as those close to him believe he saw/felt the necessity to do so. It is important to note that last part. There are allegations made in this documentary that we have absolutely no idea whether they are true or not, but just being human, we all can relate to our own (usually secret) feeling of self-pity (whether we want to admit it or not) regarding perceived wrongs done to us in our lives. I think Chris really did feel he was wronged, based on his letters to his sister, and in the way described in this documentary (also from the letter evidence) so I believe the documentary gives us good insight into what this young man was very likely feeling and fleeing from.",1511481600,,726,4.507575757575758

6802951,2,B00PHD691Y,This Documentary seemed like more of an attack on the parents than anything else. I lost interest after about 30 minutes of bitching about how bad the parents were.

6802953,5,B00PHD691Y,A dimension of Chris McCandless' story is added with this documentary. The childhood traumas experience by himself and his siblings helped to send him Into the Wild. Several reviewers take issue with Chris' siblings rejecting their father for his abusive behavior and feel that the McCandless children should have simply gotten over their traumas. Too often we think parents are deserving of their children's love and devotion. This documentary highlights how the McCandless couple continues to live in denial about their treatment of their children and did not acknowledge it in Chris' lifetime nor at the time of this documentary. Chris' sisters come forward with their accounts of abuse and seeing this story through their eyes brings you closer to Chris and his mindset.,1508544000,4,774,5.25

6802955,5,B00PHD691Y,"An amazing, little film that provides much insight into the family strife that played what was clearly an enormous role in Christopher's decision to take the journey he took. In some ways, I feel that this film was unnecessary, as Christopher's lines in the film that made him a legend ('Into the Wild') about his parents being banged together likes two pieces of flint, in an attempt to coax a spark from themselves, told me everything I needed to know about why he left his meaningless and monotonous middle-class life behind for the wild. Carine was my favorite part of this film and I highly recommend it to everyone who loved 'Into the Wild' as much as I did.",1508457600,3,664,4.588235294117647
6802956,3,B00PHD691Y,"After remembering this incident, fresh in my mind, when I was a Junior in High School in 1992 ... I have followed Chris' story for a majority of my adult life.  This movie / documentary shed a lot of insight into why he did what he did.  On the other side of the token, I got the feeling that all of the siblings, aside from Carine, had lived most of their lives under a dark shadow of their past.  I also got the feeling that they had no closure in their personal lives, due to their early childhood resentments and predicaments, and therefore hadn't learned to truly live past them, and put those times behind them.  By their inaction and stubbornness they have only ensured that they will further isolate themselves from their parents.  It's almost as if the two 'other' sisters wear their 'I'm a Victim' story like a badge.  That's just my observation of how they were portrayed in this story.",1507852800,,897,4.47239263803681

6802970,1,B00PHD691Y,"A single dimensional documentary about Chris' fahter. I understand that the terrible home life is positioned as the largest contributing element that drove him to do what he did. However, this documentary spends almost the entire time covering that element. In fact, it seems more a documentary about his father than it does him. It took greater than half way through to discuss anything else, but the family life issue was still a central thread through those other interviews with those he met along his path. While not trying to downplay the significance of his family situation, it would have been a much better documentary had they spent time covering other aspects of his childhood, growing up, and interactions with those he met. It would have also been interesting to hear experts weigh in on some of the technical strategies he used and possibly some insights from those who analyze the psychological challenges of making such a journey. But that's not what happened. Instead, they simply went from sister to sister to hear account after account of how bad their dad was, with brief shots of the dad spinning a web of denial while his dutiful wife nodded approval. This was a mix of underwhelming information, parading of women calling out their terrible father, and the frustration of wanting to turn it off each time the dad would spew denial. If you're really interested in Chris McCandless' story, you'll learn nothing new here.",1490572800,3,1441,4.934156378600823

This movie, however, made me take another look at this.
I thought of all the letters his family sent.....
Every week they sent letters and Chris returned every single one, unopened for over a year
I am a parent and I realize the sacrifices we've experienced to put our children thru college.
How proud we were to see them graduate and had I been able to afford that car to give them, yes, I'd have done it .
What I saw thru this movie is his complete disrespect for any and all of his family

6802997,4,B00PHD691Y,"I had just posted a review the other day after watching the movie adaptation of John Krakauer's book ""Into the Wild"" about the tale of Chris McCandless.  For the sake of redundancy, Chris took on another name, Alexander Supertramp, walked away from his friends and family, and chose to live the life of a drifter like his idols, London and Thoreau.  He would never see or speak to his family and friends at home in Virginia ever again, and would eventually make it to Alaska as he had always dreamed.  Unfortunately for him, he would become trapped in the wild that he so craved to be part of thanks to a raging river he could not cross, starved to death, and died at age 24.  I said I could not understand this guy's story.  How could he be so self centered as to do this to his friends and family?  This documentary, made by Chris's sister twenty years after his death, gives us some insights.

The McCandless family was crazy and dysfunctional, to say the least.  I will not drop a spoiler, but it is troubling to see how the siblings acknowledge and how both of his parents (all interviewed for this) denied it as being as bad as it really was.  I believe the siblings rather than the parents.  Nothing can bring back Chris, of course, but they all clearly loved him despite all the craziness.  By the time Chris left, it was already too late for anything.  You can't help but think still of Chris.  Despite his cutting ties and walking away, you still can't help but wonder : Did he miss them at all?  Did he ever think of them?  Did he ever once think about contacting them in some way?  Those he met on the road said he clearly had a love for his mother and a contempt for the father, but that's all they really knew.  He just ... Left them behind.  And by the last photograph on the roles of film he left, he was happy.  The story is/was tragic, to be sure, but it's made to be even more tragic by this background knowledge.  I will repeat what I said when I first heard this story:  My now 40 year old self looks at this and remembers when I first heard it, and I think about all that Chris never got to do, see and experience that the rest of us did.  We all think it's somehow glamorous to die young when we are young, but it truly is a tragedy.  It's such a waste that he threw away so much, but he got to be famous and that's usually how it is.",1465257600,4,2357,4.188888888888889

6803000,4,B00PHD691Y,"I really did appreciate this film, as did I enjoy the movie that brought most of a generation to know his journey.  Chris's story is seen as courageous, horrible, understandable, depressing, insightful, angering, beautiful, bitter, brave, foolish, or peaceful...or maybe all of them.  I depends where you stand and you mindset on what you see and or get from it.  This is a personal expansion of a look into the hearts of those who affected Chris.  I do pray for the peace of the grieving, and for their healing, but most of all, to the watchers that they realize the profound effect we have on each other.  How many times could have his story changed direction.  It is sad, but at it's core, a story that repeats itself in so many lives with so many different end results.  That is why it strikes a cord in so many.  I would state most of us at least one time felt trapped, felt alone, we all have moments of wanting to drop it all, sever ties, and step out to find answers.  Chris is a hero to many because he actually did it.",1464825600,6,1028,4.340314136125654

6803048,4,B00PHD691Y,"This film reveals tremendous insight into very concrete motivations for this young man to want to shuck off the traditional human ""systems""-(including family) and to find life or the meaning, purpose of life in an unconventional way. Just hearing the father spent his time between two wives and their households in the early years of Chris's life was enough for me. Then to hear there was domestic violence and denial, and the father saying, that Chris's decisions really had nothing to do with them (absurd), is telling enough. You definitely get the feeling,  he didn't really want to die, but he did want to push himself-and find himself and find some kind of peace, or authenticity, purity like they mention. Perhaps unburden himself from the disturbing truths and powerlessness of his childhood. Maybe on a subconsicous level he was trying to show his (trapped) mother, --See you can break out, you just have to be bold and courageous and risk taking enough. Unfortunately he just miscalucated or just wasn't quite equipped enough to get out of the wild (they talked about the cable to cross the river near him he might have known had he had a map with him) on his own. This film tells a whole lot more about the back story than the film. It all makes sense to now. The sisters are courageous and to be applauded for trying to show the world, Chris had a lifetime of confusion, pain and powerlessness he was trying to sort out. Bravo sisters. I highly recommend this film.",1457827200,3,1477,4.702702702702703

However, I did grow up with a lot of the same story, only without the money. I can see how someone could do this - just go out into the woods and die there, all alone, but my heart breaks for the sisters who obviously loved him. His parents's obvious denial is so hurtful.

I was disappointed there were no Mental Health professionals with some opinion  to Chris's actions.  His parents,  I believe as most parents, meant well at time but were somewhat delusional about their own son.  The sister (Carine) was more realistic knowing her brothers intentions and desires.

The suffering inflicted by and complete lack of apathy on the parents part is the absolute disturbing part. I guess when you don't care about the heart or your legacy, this type of reaction is acceptable.

On behalf of his sisters and their memories and Chris' legacy .... this is where the beauty comes in. There is no condemnation here...only truth and the beauty and strength of spirit.

I will say that it was very interesting to hear his parents interpretation of what had occurred.  They are clearly still in so much denial and seem very disconnected from what happened to their son.  Their affect is really bizarre and phony.  They never acknowledge(d) that their lifestyle and character played a role in CM wanting to ""disown"" them - and, eventually his demise.

6803132,3,B00PHD691Y,"Visually this presentation was mostly well done. The story, however, isn't as much about Chris as it is his sisters. I get the sense that Corrine has something to say but still feels constrained. There may be  more to the story than meets the eye, but this presentation does little to illuminate what it could be. The interviews with the parents come off as self serving. The sisters are protective of their bother's legacy.

This guy, this man who is the father of eight innocent kids when he was in two different illegal relationships, two different marriages, with two different ladies simultaneously. During both relationships, he got to abuse both wives physically and insured that kids got to watch his abuse dreadfully with no one coming to their rescue. At least the first wife got to run away from this maniac with her six kids with a restraining order. Now after one child's death and all his abusive acts, unfortunately he gets to sit with the second clueless wife, who is more like an ignorant clueless individual than anything else with a continuous smirk on her face to present themselves as a normal caring parents on this documentary, after what they have done to those poor eight kids in two different families. These two are criminals at their best. Never seen such an ignorant, proudly misplaced and distasteful parents like these two. What an absolute disgrace.

I don't quite doubt Chris left due to his parents trouble but at the time he was 22, graduated college and could have just gone out to create his own life instead of this extreme decision.

He definitely had means to just leave as I stated and was bright but I wish the story concerning his idealism was more explored.

6803264,2,B00PHD691Y,I find this probably full of half truths. Some bitter kids. Some typical screwed up parents. The truth is probably somewhere in between. As far as Chris goes he seems like a lost soul. Overly sensitive and unable to come to grips with a world that can be brutally difficult. He seems kind of suicidal. I do not find his adventure to Alaska and eventual death very inspiring. And most of the people I know from Alaska think he was a self serving idiot. They see these kids come and go. A lot of them go missing. And these books and movie only serve to romanticize his sad ending. There is nothing brave or emotionally healing about going into a wilderness unprepared emotionally and without the skills to survive and starving to death.,1443484800,5,734,4.526315789473684
6803265,5,B00PHD691Y,An amazing documentary. For those who say there was not enough information on Chris' travels or time in Alaska forget he travelled alone and not all that happened is known and his Alaskan time was in solitude so what do you expect. To capture the emotions of the sisters was a brilliant production.

The fact that their parents refuse to face the truth about themselves is not unusual.  In reality, they are the kind of people who are devoid of conscience and pathologically self centered.  Their smug denial  is just a veneer.  Deep down they know the truth.  They need to protect themselves from the hard reality that everything Chris thought and wrote about them is true.  They obviously don't have the courage to dig down deep enough to tell the truth about themselves and own the devastating damage they did to their children.  If only they could love their children more than their need to cover over the wrongs they have committed.  They would then perhaps have a chance to mend fences.  The best thing Chris' siblings can do is move forward with their own healing.  He would be so proud that they have been so true to themselves.",1443225600,5,966,4.690476190476191

6803313,2,B00PHD691Y,"As a fan of both the film and book ""Into the Wild"" I was hesitantly excited to gain the perspective of his family in this film.  The hesitation comes from the fact that so often your family are the ones that least understand you as they are clouded by projection of their own experiences living through the same circumstances.  What I gained from this film was a perspective of my own regarding family, blame and overcoming.

Despite the interesting subject that could be embarked upon the movie comes off as a family squabble played off on a public forum.  The assessing of blame is forefront to the story as his sisters' intense desire to convince the audience that the dysfunctional parental guidance Chris received is the direct result of his death.  In my opinion this storyline almost seems demeaning to Chris, as if he spent his life running from something and not out of his own free will.  He clearly had a detest for his parents and the modern view of society as a whole, but to reduce him merely to a post-adolescent act of rebellion does not capture the truth of the story as I would perceive it.

What makes ""Into the Wild"" so lovely is what Sean Penn realized in the fact that there is part of every individual that dreams of this journey but most of us never strike up the courage to actually go through with it.  Chris's sense of adventure and willingness to confront the unknown is constantly reduced here to the affect of a traumatic childhood and not seen as a positive attribute to his personality.

All in all, what you get here is a poorly-done family squabble filled with inarticulate interviews with many family members giving insight into a dysfunctional family atmosphere that plenty of children endured during this era.  I'm not trying to make lite of a serious issue but the fact here is truth. The film gives little insight into who Chris actually was as an individual but attempts to relate everything into a sole complexity of his life.  There was probably promise with this story, with their perspective, had everyone changed their focus enough to make the film about the actual subject at hand and not reduce it to what comes out as an underhanded jab attempting to rationalize the personal journey of an educated adult over twenty years ago.",1441929600,4,2275,4.6625

It was the epitome of irresponsibility and recklessness to go off without even the proper attire and rations, so expecting to leave there alive was delusional, but in a family like his I can kind of understand. I feel for his sister, being accused of airing her family dirty laundry for fame or money...if she was going to do that it would have been back when they made the film, certainly not now. In my opinion she may be trying to explain why he wanted to disappear in hopes that the droves of idiots following in his romanticized footsteps, ending up maimed or dead, may stop.

6803504,5,B00PHD691Y,"This documentary sheds more light on the true story of why Chris may have done what he did. I remember reading a magazine article about his back in the 90's. Then I saw the film made by Sean Penn a couple of years ago. I found his whole story fascinating. My opinion is that he did not intend to die in Alaska. The wild is unforgiving, and the mistake about crossing the river during the snow pack, and  not being able to re-cross the river during the snow melt to return to civilization is what cost him his life. Had he made it out, he may have continued wandering around, who knows? But he got to live an adventurous life in his last couple of years, on his own terms. I just wish he could have reconnected with his sister Corrine.",1438473600,,734,4.205673758865248

It certainly will not keep me from telling the truth about this incident.

So, re: this movie; Imo,  what a load of absolute cr@p.

If you enjoy watching whining about a boy child who killed himself by his own  arrogance, disrespect,  and stupidity have at it.

McCandless was a wannabe cheechako who disrespected the country,  and who was too stupid to live in it.

This is ALASKA people, the weak and the stupid DIE here. Always have and always will

That anybody would even TRY to make this STUPID, avoidable, useless  death into something heroic just shows what is wrong with America today,

As ALASKA goes it is  NOT the great ""wilderness"",  it's the middle of a busy trail and just about twenty miles from the highway.

Any Alaskan would have got out with no sweat.

Then these people try to blame his father for this child's actions and failure?

If you think that there is anything positive about this event, or how little chris acted, then you might want to take a good long look at yourself in the mirror and ask why you think a person who committed stupidcide by being ignorant, arrogant, and disrespectful of the country is admirable in any way?

Because Sean Penn said so?

I think that it is sad beyond words that this poor child is being made into some sort of role model.

I understand that you cheechakos don't like  having  an Alaskan speaking the TRUTH about this.

The Alaskan who dropped Chris off at the trail head warned him, and your hero Chris ignored local advice because cheechako boy knew better than the local.

And you people find something ""heroic"" in all of this?

WTF is wrong with you cheechakos?",1436918400,15,1746,4.501597444089457

6803645,3,B00PHD691Y,"This was an OK documentary. Aesthetically the video is stellar: beautiful shots, good narration, all nicely put together. However, the substance is somewhat lacking. I would of liked to see more bio on the people Chris met while on his trip (which I know is not the purpose of the film). What one will get from Return to the Wild is second narrative as to why Chris abandoned his family and went on his adventure.

Into the Wild (the film) tells mostly one side to Chris' reasons for leaving home, such as his disdain for modern society's rules and norms. Return to the Wild focuses on Chris' family life, and how growing up in an abusive and dysfunctional family fueled is desire to leave it all. Return to the Wild fills in the gaps about Chris' family life. It provides more context into Chris' mindset before and during his travels. Not only was Chris troubled by modern society's way of life, but the toxic atmosphere detailed by Chris' sisters in this film also contributed his torment.  If you are interested in gaining more insight into Chris' family back-story then Return to the Wild is for you.

Do not expect insight into Chris' travels, the people he met, places he visited, his experiences, etc. My reasoning for giving this film three stars is because it solely focus on Chris' family life. To me the title and cover somewhat misleading, suggesting new details about Chris' adventures. Even the trailer is somewhat suggestive as such, and vague. Perhaps a more appropriate cover would of been an old family portrait.

Notwithstanding any misleading marketing strategies, the film is interesting. Chris' sisters tell a compelling story of abuse and utter dysfunction. The most interesting part of the film is hearing Chris' parents' reactions to the accusations made the McCandless sisters.

If you merely want more details about Chris' trip then it sounds like there is a book called Back to the Wild that will serve that purpose. They talk about it int the film and it sounds quite interesting.

6803649,5,B00PHD691Y,"An outstanding, sad, and disturbing follow-up to the story of Chris McCandless, who cut ties with his life and wandered into America, meeting his end in an abandoned bus deep in the Alaskan frontier. I was only marginally aware of the story, having had not read the book (I tend to find Krakauer pretentious and self absorbed) and having had not caught the film. The story unfolds here with commentary from various family members, adding in more of the background to the strange decision this young man made two decades ago. What is truly disturbing is the denial of his parents to allegations being made by his sister and half-sisters, allegations of abuse, lies, and monstrous behavior on the part of the father. I am far more inclined to believe the accounts by these sisters than to believe a man who smugly says he might forgive those allegations someday.  It makes the decisions by McCandless that much more understandable, and Walt McCandless comes across as a sociopath and a monster.",1428278400,27,992,4.8352941176470585
6803650,1,B00PHD691Y,"I felt misled, I thought I was buying a movie of this young man's travel, not a more of a fact based video.  It was good, but not what I was wanting since the journals, the info about his family had been covered over and over on many different formats.",1428105600,,252,4.04
6803651,1,B00PHD691Y,"This movie didn't shed light on anything new, it was just a regurgitation of a family drama that frankly pales in comparison with millions of other family dramas around the world, past and present. Chris McCandless lived how he lived and died how he died. There is something vaguely romantic about his story which is why, I suppose, people have been drawn to it (that and the astonishing amount of publicity it received). I don't mean to belittle what he and the siblings may have gone through but that in itself doesn't actually explain any of McCandless' decisions, including the one that led to his demise.",1428019200,12,609,4.754716981132075

6803656,4,B00PHD691Y,"This is a great companion piece to the major Hollywood release of ""Into the Wild."" This doco gives an entirely different perspective to the film in that Chris McCandless is given a far more human face than the film offered. Only a reading of the book could give you what this does, and the film version did not. The interviews with his sisters are particularly insightful and will change your perception of the film.

8687943,2,B00PHD691Y,"I think the family is looking for a reason for why Chris died and I think blaming the parents was convenient. I seriously suspect he had a psychological illness like schizophrenia or schizoid personality which may have not been apparent to his family yet....but if you look at those photographs of him with his family around the time he's graduating he always has a strange far-off detached look in his eyes. There was a lot going on inside his head at that time. I think his age, inexperience and state of mind may have lead him to over-estimate his capabilities to live alone in the wild. The truth is many young people leave home for adventure or to find themselves and decide they don't want to return home...but most do return eventually.",1531440000,,743,4.636363636363637

8687952,3,B00PHD691Y,"If you haven't read ""Into the Wild"" or at the very least watched the film of the same name, this short documentary will likely lack the emotional impact that viewing it after such reading/viewing will provide.  It becomes quite clear that Chris's father Walt still lives in denial about his sordid past, either because it is too painful, or because he hasn't changed that much from the philandering, wife-beater that he was during Chris's formative years.  I found myself getting very angry watching this short film.  I'm not sure if it was the careful way that Walt and his wife tiptoed around the words they used- as if they were a PR firm trying to conduct damage control for the sake of public appearances, instead of the parents of a son that died alone in the wilderness- largely because of the scars they caused to him as a child.  Perhaps it was the way they still denied and even attempted to discredit Chris's younger sister- as though she would make up a story of physical abuse and domestic violence to be part of the story.  Whatever the cause, the anger I felt was real. Walt should be ashamed of himself. If you haven't watched ""Into the Wild,"" take the time to see the movie and read the book, they are well done.  This short documentary will help flesh out the hidden parts of Chris's story, although some of the things that they reveal are painful and very real and represent the shadows that seem to congregate in the walls of our lives, even in picture-perfect suburbia.",1523836800,3,1490,4.582706766917293
