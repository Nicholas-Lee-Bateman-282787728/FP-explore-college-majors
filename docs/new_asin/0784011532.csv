73322,5,0784011532,A must-see action film. One of Dolph Lundgren's best performances. He plays a really great psycho villain; no cardboard performance here (at least not from Dolph). The action in the movie is non-stop and Dolph has some good one-liners that rival Arnold. Van Damme's performance is on target in some parts and lame in others.,980467200,,324,4.909090909090909
73323,5,0784011532,"This Sci-fi action is one of the better of the genre and ask any Dolph or Jean-claude fan then they would probably say this rates as one of their best. The film goes on at a cracking pace and the action is always pulse pounding. You have a bit of humour even from the two mono-sylabic beefcakes and the story although not brilliant and at times predictable is still good enough for an action film. The action is okay and this is probably the best performance from Van-Damme that i have seen even though he was more wooden than a woodland area, and Dolph's performance is great, he far outshines Van-Damme and really does look scarily pyschotic at times, in fact dare i say it he probably shows too much emotion at certain points for a human zombie. If you want to watch an entertaining blokes movie then you can't go too wrong by picking this little gem of a film, in the words of Montgomery Burns, Excellent!",977270400,,909,4.416666666666667

73325,3,0784011532,Ok so its not the most slickly plotted movies of all time and the acting  is pretty bad but if your looking for a movie that is enjoyable go for  this. If u like films to have more acting then special effects then stay  well clear but if u like Van Damme then this is worth a look.,965692800,2,281,3.810344827586207
73326,4,0784011532,"The movie has a lot of action in it and a decent story. I bought the DVD and like the movie. The DVD has above average picture and sound that make the special effects even more stunning. The DVD is short on extras though.  It does have trailors, but no commentary track. It also has a behind the  scenes special, but it only lasts 6 minutes. It is still a good action  movie and worth seeing.",950054400,,392,4.131578947368421
73327,5,0784011532,"Jean Claude Van Damme, we all agree, is not one of the most cerebral actors, but he never fails in making movies both intense and enjoyable.
Universal Soldier is no exception to this rule, and with Dolph  Lundgren complementing him, Universal Soldier is thrust into the realm of  classics.
Admittedly, this movie does not stack up to CYBORG, but it has  all the elements of a great Van Damme picture.  The fight scene at the end  is inspired and well choreographed, and you will cheer for Dolph every time  he spouts his ""Traitor"" line.
Any fan of Van Damme, Martial  arts, or science fiction will no doubt enjoy Universal Soldier.  A must  see!",927417600,2,645,4.6371681415929205

73337,5,0784011532,"This review is on the contents of the movie and neither packaging nor seller.

Universal Soldier is a serious kick-ass delight movie.  There's nothing more enjoyable some days than to watch two reasonably skilled performers - and I use that term because it's both acting and action - ply their respective trades in a buttwhooping flick.

Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren star in this movie made for that lazy Saturday afternoon.  It's a guilty pleasure.  Both of these gents are at the top of their game at this point in time.  Van Damme, who can do major damage and Lundgren, an oaf in comparison, are soldiers killed in Vietnam.  Through reanimation and engineering they are brought back to life to become butt kicking soldiers with complete obedience... until...  It's that ""until"" that really makes this movie work.

Yes, I give it 5*.  That doesn't mean it's as good as Casa Blanca or a handful of other TRULY 5* films.  It's 5* for this genre.  I love the thing.",1485993600,,976,4.710059171597633

It`s not a cheap direct to video type action film that Van Damme and Lundgren are usually in. It has a big budget blockbuster feel to it. Also very well directed by Roland Emmerich surprisingly. Slick, professional looking and different. Very violent and very fun. If you`re an action fan at all this is a must see. If you`re not a Van Damme or Lundgren fan don`t let that stop you.

73411,4,0784011532,"This movie is fun to watch.  There's alot of mindless action scenes, a somewhat decent story and lots of desert.  The movie is about Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren, soldiers who die in Vietnam only to be regenerated into......Universal Soldiers!!!

The movie opens with a scene showing both men dying during the Vietnam war, with their bodies being zip upped and shipped off.  Its never said or shown how many years have past, but both men have been recycled into enhanced soldiers under a program that the government may or may not know about.

The first action sequence involves a situation on the Hoover Dam.  Terrorists have taken the dam and make hostages out of the tourists.  They demand ransom, so the military sends in the soldiers.  First a plane lands to unload them, then they are helicopter over water(a mile away from the dam), they are dropped into the water then they swim to the dam; these guys have  s***l-oad of energy.

After taking care of the hostage situation the soldiers are packed up into a 18 wheeler and are off to their next crisis.  Inside the 18 wheeler houses chairs where they rest and re-energize for their next assignment.  A secretive team of scientists watches over them, making sure they are healed and delivering any vaccines that are necessary.

Van Damme's character experiences flashbacks and the main story is the search for his past identity with the help of a female reporter who wishes to expose the soldier program.  There's several action sequences in the movie and they are done well enough that an action movie fan will appreciate them.  The end sequence that takes place on a farm could have been improved; its doesn't interest me to see characters die via farm equipment.

The plot is fairly basic, but the action scenes are great.  There's a constant back and forth between Van Damme and Lundgren as Lundgren goes nuts and decides to track down Van Damme and the reporter and kill them both.  The movie has a unique idea with the super-soldiers concept, the sequels never caught my attention though.",1389657600,,2050,4.759206798866855

73418,3,0784011532,"Stars Jean Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren's collective careers are an enigma to me when contrasted.  Not the biggest JCVD fan in the world but am surprised how often I enjoy his flicks, even  those from the last decade.  No, especially those from the last decade.  Lundgren, on the other hand, is a super cool cat whose presence in film is always welcome, yet I've liked very few of his starring vehicles.  It's not that I think he's incapable of carrying a film but it does seem like he's at his best playing a villain or a supporting role.  And ""Universal Soldier"" is the best example of his sadistic brand of jerkdom.  I would possibly argue in favor of ""Johnny Mnemonic"" if it weren't for the fact that Dolph was the ONLY good thing about that turd.

Our two stars both play U.S. Army sergeants during the Vietnam war.  When Andrew Scott (Lundgren) goes bonkers and starts waxin' everybody, Luc Devreaux (Van Damme) tries to stop him and they both end up dead... until they are eventually reanimated as cyborg-y things known as UniSols: genetically enhanced soldiers programmed to follow orders.  All is well with that whole obedience thing until Devreaux starts having flashbacks pertaining to the moments immediately preceding his death.  When two members of the media sneak into the UniSol's  remarkably wide-open military compound and are captured, Scott deliberately delivers a deadly gunshot wound to one of them, indicating that he, too, has been experiencing some nostalgia.  Sensing his zombie-brother's sudden disregard for protocol, Devreaux conjures up some of his own when he grabs the surviving reporter (Ally Walker, ""While You Were Sleeping"") and takes off, with the UniSols and other assorted military personnel hot on their trail.  Scott, meanwhile, goes rogue, which is bad news for merchants and consumers in the surrounding counties.

This is a fun, violent movie, with both stars hamming it up, Van Damme the more stoic of the two.  I was a little disappointed that there wasn't more marital arts in the film.  Oh, there are a couple of kicks thrown but no real Karate fighting.  Though Van Damme was well known for bustin' moves by 1992, Dolph had only recently started illustrating his abilities in that department, particularly with the previous year's ""Showdown in Little Tokyo"", co-starring Brandon Lee.  The action is not bad, otherwise, with plenty of stuff blowin' up and dudes being thrown through windows n' stuff.

This Special Edition DVD from Lions Gate is endowed with 2.35:1 widescreen picture, 5.1 or 2.0 Dolby Digital sound (English only), and a reasonable handful of special features, the most ironic of which has our stars talking candidly about their accomplishments in the martial arts.  Whatever.  I'll blame director Roland Emmerich (""Independence Day"").  Despite receiving ever-increasing amounts of money for delivering increasingly louder & dumber films, Emmerich never really topped his work here. This has gotta be his least obnoxious project, which runs 102 minutes and has subtitles available in English & Spanish.

This film was followed by 2 made-for-tv sequels before getting a theatrical release for the return of Van Damme in 1999's stupid-but-fun ""Universal Soldier: The Return"".  It would be 10 years later before the franchise was successfully resurrected by writer/director John Hyams, with the superior ""Universal Soldier: Regeneration"", reuniting Van Damme & Lundgren.  They would all join forces again for 2012's genre-blending ""Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning"".

73432,3,0784011532,"Universal Soldier isn't one of those films that was meant to break any new ground. In fact, I can sense obvious parallels to films such as The Terminator, First Blood, Robocop, Commando, etc. With those aside, this is an entertaining ride of 90's action cinema, complete with two international action genre icons that aren't Schwarzenegger.

Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren face against each other during the Vietnam war, killing each other over the fate of two captured prisoners. Both of them are reanimated as part of the Universal Soldier counter terrorism unit, complete with head equipment that removes any memory of their previous lives. However, the technology can only erase their memories for so long, as Van Damme's character, Luc Devereaux, regains flashbacks of the scenes before his death, and Lundgren's character, Sgt. Andrew Scott, is enjoying using excessive force. This leads up to a series of events that involve Devereaux doing what he can to save the life of a recently fired TV reporter, while Scott once again becomes his murderous self and seeks to kill Devereaux.

Now with a lineup featuring both Van Damme and Lundgren, don't expect any phenomenal acting. Van Damme is wooden as expected, but he even seems like a clone of Schwarzenegger's protective role in Terminator 2. Despite that, I'd probably choose his role in this film over the vast majority of his back catalog, even if there is a restraint on his martial arts skills. Lundgren, on the other hand, gives a surprisingly enjoyable performance as the psychotic murder with his trademark severed ear necklace. It's stupid but I'd be lying if I said that I didn't enjoy it.

Even if the acting is sub-par, it will certainly satisfy those that long for action scenes. There's explosions and rapid gunfire galore, which will certainly require suspension of disbelief. In ways, it plays as a homage to the big name action films that helped define the genre in the 80's, yet it doesn't seem like a completely faceless knockoff.

This film certainly isn't phenomenal and it's something that's meant more for the fans, but it works despite its obvious flaws. To be honest, I also admit to being surprised upon hearing that Roland Emmerich was the director behind this, and even though I find most of his works ludicrous and underwhelming, this is probably one of the better parts of his career.

73435,4,0784011532,"Universal Soldier(released July/92)starring Jean Claude and Dolph Lundgren is certainly one of Van Damme's best films to date and did boffo box office business that year. Van Damme was the new action kid-on-the-block at the time with the reigning stars being Stallone and Schwarzenegger. The producers hired Lundgren to give the movie some fine menace who was more than well known from Rocky 4 as the Russian whom Stallone trounces in that famous fight-to-the-finish battle. The film also boasts some pretty impressive fight scenes,battles and explosions of its own and I find it still holds up well today after 18 years on(!).
The story opens in the jungles of Vietnam where Pfc. Devreaux is checking out a fleeing comrades rants that a Sgt. Scott has gone rogue. When he arrives in a nearby village he does indeed find that Scott has not only killed almost every civilian there but his own soldiers who failed to go along with the massacre. Both men end up shooting each other and ""dying"".Fast forward 25 years and Scott,Devreaux and other ex soldiers have been regenerated to life in a top secret US Government program as a special tactical forces team;pumped up by on going drug injections and mind controlled by a mobile group of scientists and on-hand military personnel.
In their first real test they are sent to Hoover Dam to free hostages taken there by a group of terrorists. With drill like precision they complete one step after another until the hostages are freed. Standing beside the hostages Devreaux starts to get flash backs to Vietnam and his ex sergeant's abhorrent behaviour from that time. The soldiers all return to the mobile truck from which the raid was staged and while there a snoopy reporter Ally Walker(Veronica Roberts)sniffs around taking pictures. The alarms sound,she returns to her car with another reporter at the wheel and they flee for their lives. Ex-Sgt. Scott and Devreaux lead the retrieval and as they eventually get both reporters in hand,Sgt. Scott suddenly shoots/kills Ms. Walkers' cohort,for no apparent reason .This causes another painful flash back for Devreaux and he stops him from killing Walker.
On the run Deveraux and Walker at one point stop at a gas station. Having followed them there the Uni-Sols(Universal Soldier-team)converge but Devreaux has it rigged so the entire station blows up. It takes a few of the soldiers with it and just as the Colonel in charge is assessing the situation he receives a call that the project has been canceled,so he recalls the left overs. Scott is among them and he shoots the Colonel dead then decides to take over the mobile truck and pursue the reporter and Devreaux himself.
Day five of the film finds Devreaux and Walker back at his home in Louisiana and reuniting with his parents. It's a touching reunion but it's not long before Scott has tracked him down and takes his parents and Walker as hostages. Walker is tied to a spiked thrasher and Scott attempts to shoot her in the head but his gun is out of ammo. She manages to free herself and as she runs Scott throws a grenade and she disappears in the resulting explosion. It is here Scott and Devreaux have their final showdown as the action goes back and forth,from one Uni-Sol to the other. Finally Devreaux gets enough strength to high kick Scott and impale him onto the spikes of the trasher. As he says:""You're discharged-sarge"",Devreaux turns on the thrasher and we say goodbye to Scott. In the final moments Devreaux checks on Walker to find she hasn't died and the explosion just knocked her out. They embrace and the movie fades to black.
Van Damme is certainly in a good acting groove throughout the film and he maintains a good and consistent emotional quality about his character. Lundgren is wonderfully menacing and throws in alot of wide-eyed gloating/humour into his role which enhances his characterization also. The supporting cast is solid and the direction and writing is spot on all the way. This was director Roland Emmerichs first big States side movie and after this he went on to do the highly successful Stargate and then onto the even more successful Independence Day;not a bad start,no?
There are several humorous moments but one in particular is a scene at the gas station where reporter Walker and Devreaux are in a room alone. Devreaux strips and we see Walker knelt behind him facing forward through his legs. He is asking her to look for and take out a tracking device implanted somewhere in his body.""Look for something hard"",he says,very straight laced.
Technically the movie in this special edition has been remastered very well and is in its' 2:35:1 aspect ratio in either Dolby 5.1 or 2 sound. There is a commentary track,a very interesting alternate ending and two featurettes about the movie and its' making and newer interviews with Lundgren and Van Damme about their careers and Universal Soldier.
This is a recommended DVD and the movie itself along with its' remastering and extras,add up to a winner all the way. Get out the popcorn for that perfect Saturday night action flick!",1272758400,,5076,4.876157407407407

73437,4,0784011532,"Imagine a world where wars were no longer fought by new recruits into the military or battle-hardened veterans that have returned for another tour of duty. Instead, picture the wars being fought by those who had already served their country and died on the field of battle years before. This type of world and future of warfare is exactly what screenwriter Dean Devlin (""Stargate"") and director Roland Emmerich (""2012"") envisioned with their science-fiction action hit ""Universal Soldier"".

""Universal Soldier"" follows two American soldiers, Luc Deveraux (Jean-Claude Van Damme) and Andrew Scott (Dolph Lundgren), who died by each others hands in Vietnam. Now, resurrected by a secret project within the United States military, Luc and Andrew are leading members of a group of elite fighters known as Universal Soldiers (or UniSols). The plan is for the UniSols to simply exist for the sole purpose of carrying out orders for their handlers, with no memory of their previous life. However, when a mission triggers a flashback causing Luc and Andrew to remember their deaths, the two quickly become engaged in a deadly game for survival.

I enjoyed my experience re-watching this movie recently, as it had been several years since I had last seen it. I hadn't actually given ""Universal Soldier"" much thought in some time, and honestly, my opinion of the movie had become somewhat tainted by the lesser quality of its ""official"" sequel, ""Universal Soldier: The Return"". I use the word ""official"" because there actually were two made-for-TV sequels (""Universal Solider 2: Brothers in Arms"" and ""Universal Soldier 3: Unfinished Business"") that aired prior to the latter's theatrical release. However, the recently released (and fairly well-received) ""Universal Soldier: Regeneration"" renewed my interest in revisiting the original film, if for no other reason than to brush up on the details of the story before watching the newest installment.

The story for this film is a fairly straightforward actioner, only with a sci-fi slant. The plot moves along at a brisk pace, as one would typically expect from such a movie. The action sequences are always entertaining and not in short supply, but they never really threaten to overshadow the story for the film. There had been some criticisms leveled at this movie when it was released and even since then, that it is nothing more than yet another shallow action flick with zero brains and all brawn. However, I tend to disagree.

While the framework of the film, as I stated earlier, is essentially a straight-up action movie, there are some more emotional elements that did manage to surprise me. Examples would be the portions of the movie dealing with Luc and Andrew's time in Vietnam, the desire to return home that Luc feels upon regaining his memories, and the psychological issues that Andrew endures. All of these elements featured in the film focus upon much weightier issues than one would typically find in a run-of-the-mill action movie.

To their credit, writer Dean Devlin and director Roland Emmerich took a fairly reasonable amount of time exploring those facets of the story, essentially mining for an emotional anchor in the movie with which the audience could relate. Granted a little more time could have been spent dealing with the issues, especially the more traumatic ones; however, this wasn't intended to be an Oscar worthy film. So, as far as action movies go I was surprised this one got as heavy as it did and one shouldn't expect much more than that. I think too many people chose to just write this movie off based on its lead actors rather than pay attention to what was actually happening within the story.

The cast was led by two of the rising stars in terms of action heroes at the time, Jean-Claude Van Damme (""Bloodsport"") and Dolph Lundgren (""Rocky 4""); however, both men have had a tough time crawling their way out of the Direct-to-DVD realm of movies in recent years. Jean-Claude as the hero of the movie, Luc Deveraux, gives what is quite possibly his best performance in what is probably his best movie as well. His acting has never been stellar by any means, yet in this film he does stretch his emotional boundaries a little more than we're used to seeing from the so-called ""Muscles from Brussels"".

Dolph Lundgren as Andrew Scott, a soldier whose war has never ended, is equally more diverse in this role than any others I've seen him in. Typically, he portrays an emotionally detached individual, whether a hero or villain, but here he injects much more life into his performance. From Andrew's sick and twisted sense of humor to his psychotic breaks with reality, Dolph plays the various aspects of the character with surprising ease and creates a villain that is much more complicated than your stock action movie character tends to be.

It's too bad that both actors didn't deliver more performances like the ones in this film, not to mention being smarter about finding good material to work with along the way. For example, Jean-Claude did ""Street Fighter"" really seem like a wise decision? I think not, and I'm sure at this point you would agree. Maybe if the two of them hadn't been willing to settle for whatever project would come their way, no matter how potentially damaging it could be to their careers, then perhaps their careers could have avoided hitting the skids in the late nineties and into the present. Just a thought.

Alongside the two leads is actress Ally Walker (TV's ""Sons of Anarchy"") as a reporter who inadvertently stumbles across the government's military secret of creating reanimated soldiers. The role is essentially flat and one-dimensional, but Ally takes it one step further by making her character somewhat of an annoyance for much of her time in front of the camera. It's not until two-thirds of the way through this film that she finally gets some control of herself and attempts to make her character more realistic and not your prototypical nosy reporter that always gets into trouble. It's too bad that it took Ally so long to realize that she had created such an annoying character, because I've seen her in other movies and TV shows and she is a much more capable actress than one would be led to believe from her work in this film.

The bottom line is that ""Universal Soldier"" is a sci-fi/action movie that delivers the prerequisite goods in terms of hard-hitting fights, some quick bits of humor, and a fast-moving, easy-to-follow storyline which is exactly what its audience expects. While at the same time, the movie does offer some surprisingly deeper, quieter moments as well. All of this when mixed together makes for a movie that will satisfy the hardcore action junkies, and those looking for something with more substance than the latest Seagal movie has to offer.

Universal Soldier looks rather dated like most things from the 70s, and the overall feeling is rather amateurish. He plays a mercenary back in business for another (last?) job. Some small amount of action, firing machine guns, car chases and riding on hovercraft. But generally the mood is rather laid back. Lazenby got caught up in the idea that the future was movies like Easy Rider, hence the atmosphere, but that whole genre got swept away with Star Wars, ET, Mad Max and the like. I also watched The Man from Hong Kong recently. Reasonably OK, but cant say Lazenby really stood out.

73441,3,0784011532,"In films like The Terminator (1984), Predator (1987), Total Recall (1990), and Terminator 2 (1991), Arnold Schwarzenegger pioneered the melding of the action/adventure genre with science fiction themes.  Jean-Claude Van Damme's entries into the genre in this period included Cyborg (1989), Universal Soldier (1992), and Timecop (1994).  These films are among those usually considered to be among his better films.

In Universal Soldier, Van Damme is Luc Deveraux, a soldier serving in Viet Nam in 1969.  When Deveraux tries to stop fellow soldier Sergeant Andrew Scott (Dolph Lundgren), from killing some civilians, the two men end up shooting each other dead.  Their bodies are claimed by the US government, and through some mysterious treatment, life is miraculously restored.  Some twenty-five years later, the two men are members of the Universal Soldiers, an experimental elite fighting force, under the control of the military.  At temperatures close to freezing, `unisols' have the remarkable ability to regenerate and heal themselves.  Treated with injections into the brain, they have no memory of their past lives.

Deveraux is on a mission at Hoover Dam, when an incident triggers his past memories.  Later when nosy reporter Veronica Roberts (Ally Walker), is discovered snooping around the unisol's trailer headquarters, Scott's programming breaks down, and he kills her cameraman.  Deveraux recovers enough of his memory to also rebel, and he takes off with the gabby Ms. Roberts.

The rest of the film is basically a hunt down of Deveraux.  Scott leads the group of unisols in pursuit, as they engage in a completely excessive, shootout of a motel, and destruction of a gas station.  Refusing to give up the chase, Scott wipes out most of those connected with the program, and goes after Deveraux with a vengeance.  An action highlight is a heavy vehicle chase, that has a climatic ending on a high cliff.  Seeking refuge, Luc returns to his childhood home, a farm, where a final confrontation with Scott takes place.

Directed by Roland Emmerich (Independence Day), and executive produced by Mario Kassar (Terminator 2, Total Recall), Universal Soldier is pure comic book action.  Typical for many of Van Damme's films, there is the impression of a lack of realism, and lots of gratuitous violence (the Viet Nam scene is a perfect example).  Van Damme and Lundgren, perform their action scenes ably, with their final battle being a tough, wet, atmospheric affair.  Lundgren's acting is quite stiff, but he is an imposing physical presence.  Unfortunately, he has the most atrocious dialog, which makes him sound like a total idiot.  Ally Walker (Profiler) is a good dramatic actress, and she holds it together pretty well, as she too has to deal with some bad dialog and attempts to inject levity.

Although the original story barely holds together, the Universal Soldier concept was intriguing, and spawned the sequel Universal Soldier: The Return (1999) starring Van Damme, and several TV movies with Matt Battaglia as Deveraux.  The big news to fans of the franchise, is the upcoming direct to video release of Universal Soldier: Regeneration, scheduled for February 2, 2010.  The film features Jean Claude Van Damme, Dolph Lundgren, and MMA's Andrei 'Pit Bull' Arlovski.

I'm pleasantly surprised on how good the picture quality of UniSol especially for a low budget and being a 16-year old movie like this one. It's hard to see any grain anywhere, sharpness is dead-on even on darker scenes, very good transfer... brilliant work LionsGate!

Okay, Van Damme isn't known for his great acting - there's a reason his nickname is the Muscles from Brussels. But what he does, he does quite well, which is flex those pecs and abs and throw those helicopter kicks. He found himself in trashy plots, regurgitated from one picture to the next, and his characters were normally cardboard cutouts. So Van Damme knows the scope of his skills, and he (or his handlers) are smart enough to stick to his purview. In its time, UNIVERSAL SOLDIER featured two of Hollywood's hottest action movie stars: Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren (who got his cred playing Ivan Drago in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rocky-IV/dp/B0006GAOGI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rocky IV</a>). And this pairing was enough to turn the movie into a moderate box office success. With all that in mind, UNIVERSAL SOLDIER does entertain, even when one factors in the weak dialogue, two male leads not known for acting, and the typical dumbing-down of the storyline.

The concept is actually pretty cool. Deceased soldiers are revived thru modern science and engineered to be counter-terrorist agents. Two of these Universal Soldiers (or UniSols) are Private Luc Deveraux (Van Damme) and Sergeant Andrew Scott (Lundgren), two Vietnam-era G.I grunts who share a vicious history. Twenty-five years ago, deep in the Vietnam War, Sgt. Scott, kind of a sadistic tool, has gone loony in the jungle and is committing acts of atrocities against innocent Vietnam villagers (he's also shot up most of his platoon). Louisiana farmboy Pvt. Deveraux's tour of duty is almost over, but he tries to stop the psycho sergeant anyway. The confrontation results in the two soldiers killing each other. Which is when the story really gets going.

Cut to present day, and the Hoover Dam has just been taken over by terrorists. The mysterious Universal Soldiers are deployed and are impressive in taking out the terrorists. Two of these UniSols turn out to be Deveraux and Scott, the dirty little secret being that they've pretty much been zombified, mindwiped and rendered super-strong and quick-healing, their resuscitation somehow involving the constant cooling down of their core temperatures. But Deveraux begins to override his zombie programming, starts to have Vietnam flashbacks. He garners enough self-will to go rogue and make a break for it. And naturally there's a beautiful girl in tow, a tough-talking TV news reporter played with grit and feistiness by a very game Ally Walker (the best actor in this movie). So off they go, and hotly pursued by the implacable UniSol units, including the erstwhile Sergeant Scott who is also shaking off his UniSol programming.

A poor man's TERMINATOR 2? Yeah, probably. But, boy, did I like UNIVERSAL SOLDIER when it came out in '92. It's a neat concept, and the writers really should've developed the story more, instead of strictly sticking with the Man On the Lam schtick. But if you're in a popcorn mood and disinclined to ponder deep thoughts, then this'll do ya. Van Damme! Lundgren! In the late '80s, early '90s, these two cats may not have had the pedigree of Schwarzenegger or Stallone, but they were the next best thing (okay, fine, throw Steven Seagal in there, too). And, unlike Jet Li and Jason Statham in the disappointing WAR, when Van Damme and Lundgren faced off, they faced off, brother! Van Damme's forehead knot has never looked more ferocious!

UNIVERSAL SOLDIER was craphammered for the acting, but this is probably Lundgren's best acting job. He does a pretty awesome over-the-top psychopath, and is a dang scary mofo in this movie. Lundgren's character is a good foil for Van Damme's good guy hunk. Van Damme himself isn't too bad. He seems to be able to channel this certain puzzled innocence into his performances, and that quality is onscreen again here. Of course, my saying that Van Damme ""isn't too bad"" has to be weighed against the fact that he plays a robotic semi-zombie for parts of this flick. And, okay, Van Damme again displays his nether cheeks. For de ladies, that alone may trump the acting.

This Special Edition DVD contains the following special features: audio commentary with Van Damme, Lundgren, director Roland Emmerich and writer Dean Devlin; ""Guns, Genes and Fighting Machines"" - the 19-minute-long Making Of segment; Tale of 2 Titans - Van Damme and Lundgren respectively talk about their backgrounds, their big acting breaks, and their individual film careers; a depressing alternate ending; and trailers. The bonus stuff is actually pretty decent, with maybe the most interesting thing learned being that Lundgren actually had a Master's degree in chemical engineering and was headed for MIT before the movie bug bit him.

UNIVERSAL SOLDIER is loud and violent and action-packed. Action highlights include the rapid rappelling of the Hoover Dam, an amusing diner brawl with Van Damme quizzically taking out the rubes whilst scarfing his meal (""I just want to eat.""), and the big Van Damme-Lundgren showdown at the end, where things get really chippy. I do wish, though, that Lundgren was given a chance to demonstrate more of his martial arts skill. Between Dolph and Jean-Claude, Dolph was actually considered the more credible martial artist. Anyways, memory association with this film prompts images of gross ear necklaces and big scary honking needles. On the Blink-Fast-And-You'll-Miss-It front, there's the pseudo-science explanation of the UniSols (something about hyperaccelerating the bodies, transforming dead flesh into living tissue).

UNIVERSAL SOLDIER made enough cheese that it birthed two awful and Van Damme-less sequels: UNIVERSAL SOLDIER 2: BROTHERS IN ARMS and UNIVERSAL SOLDIER 3: UNFINISHED BUSINESS (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Universal-Soldier-2-Universal-Soldier-3-Double-Feature/dp/B00062TRNS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Universal Soldier 2/ Universal Soldier 3 (Double Feature)</a>).

73450,3,0784011532,"""Universal Soldier"" may very well be one of the most definitive opus of 80s/90s American action cinema. Gunfights? - out the butt. Car chases? - make that prison bus chases, headed towards a canyon. Explosions? - better hope you have 5.1 to experience the full blast. Martial arts? - not as much as I'd like, but inserted in the right spots. One-liners? - ""You're discharged, sarge!"" Right on. However, despite all this, it has it's flaws.

The story: ""Soldier"" is the post-mortem tale of Luc Deveraux (Jean-Claude Van Damme,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloodsport/dp/B00006RCOC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloodsport</a>) and Andrew Scott (Dolph Lundgren,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rocky-IV/dp/B0006GAOGI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rocky IV</a>) - two soldiers who killed eachother in Vietnam chosen for a military program that reanimated them as members of an elite squad of remote-controlled super soldiers employed to defuse extremely dangerous situations. After foiling a terrorist plot to take over the McKinley Dam, Luc begins experiencing memory flashbacks that disrupt his conditioning to follow orders. When a young newscaster (Ally Walker, ""Profiler"") is put in danger for investigating the program, he overrides his directive entirely and attempts to rescue her and is pursued by Scott, who is also experiencing flashbacks of his most violent days...

Some folks have charged the film a ""Terminator"" ripoff, though this isn't entirely accurate. Rather, ""Universal Soldier"" is a homage to just about every action movie that had preceded it. The influence from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Terminator/dp/B000OPOAM0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Terminator</a>&nbsp;is there, sure, but the movie also stylistically alludes to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/First-Blood/dp/B0004Z33EG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">First Blood</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Die-Hard/dp/B000O77SRC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Die Hard</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Commando/dp/B000GUJYI8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Commando</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Missing-in-Action/dp/079284582X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Missing in Action</a>, and a slew of other films that boast big guys with big guns delivering big thrills. If you enjoy action cinema from this specific time period, this film will be your wet dream from the moment that Lundgren throws the first grenade to Van Damme's final flying kick. With that being said, I need to take the edge off of the excitement: it's a good movie, with good action and a few good jokes, but it is not great. The action is big and bad, but it's not the biggest and baddest there is: pretty much all of the films that I mentioned before give better offerings where gunplay/car chases/kickboxing is concerned, so if you've seen any or all of them, your awe will be limited.

As mentioned earlier, the Van Damme vs. Lundgren card was not played to its fullest extent. At the time of its release, both men had proven themselves verifiable action heroes; it would've made perfect sense to unleash the two upon eachother and build the film around their various encounters, from shootouts to karate contests. However, this is not the case: we get one mano-e-mano encounter at the end of the movie, but for the rest of the picture, it's all Van Damme running from Lundgren and the two of them proving their mettle on others, not eachother. While it's entertaining to see Deveraux beat up a restaurant full of attackers, it would've been a hundred times more fulfilling to see him take the fight to Scott more often. When they finally do fight eachother hand-to-hand, it's hardly what you'd expect from two legitimate martial arts champions: lots of throwing around and haymakers and other non-karate things, whereas trading punches, roundhouse kicks, and counter-holds are all exempt.

The acting is a mixed bag where all characters are concerned, though this is of less consequence in this kind of movie: Van Damme, Lundgren, Walker, and Jerry Orbach (""Law & Order"") as the program administrator all have their respective high points and low points, but nobody really stands out. Van Damme plays well in the beginning as a soft-spoken amnesiac, but once he livens up, it's back to the performance that critics like to bash him for. Lundgren as the depraved war villain is infinitely more interesting: it's nice to see him play a bad guy - and such an extreme one, at that - but even he gets a bit carried away with some of his lines to the point that he surpasses 'crazy' and turns just plain silly. Ally Walker's performance is a bit embarrassing, so it's good to know that she moved on to better things. Jerry Orbach is simply Jerry Orbach.

Is ""Universal Soldier"" good? - of course. Is it great? - no. Is it a highlight of the careers of Van Damme and Lundgren? - definitely. Is it worth owning for fans? - most likely, for those willing to trade in B-movie adventures for big budget works for a while. Is it worth plunking down a few extra dollars for the special edition? - yep. Should I buy it now? - maybe not now, but don't wait too long!",1233187200,,5386,5.8560509554140125

73452,4,0784011532,"The Jean Claude Van Damme Review Matrix (JCVD-RM)

1.  Who is he? Luc Deveraux, former US soldier in Vietnam who, when killed by friendly fire, becomes part of a military medical equivalent to Frankenstein, the Universal Soldier (UniSol).
2.  Which family member/friend must be avenged?  As a humanitarian soldier, Deveraux considered friendly Vietnamese his friends.  It's just too bad his Sergeant didn't.
3.  Does he take his shirt off?  It's probably because he's dead, but JCVD is shirtless in a faux cryogenic, stasis in bubbling water scenes stolen straight from comic books, as well as whenever the UniSols are back in the mobile lab or in a vat of ice.  I'm sure the ice thing was written in specifically so he could take his shirt off.
4.  Does he have sex with a C-List actress?  Thankfully he didn't...otherwise this movie would have involved necrophilia.
5.  Is there a tournament?  There is no sanctioned tournament, just UniSols going about their mission.
6.  Is training needed for this tournament?  Quoting the awesomeness of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stripes/dp/0767817753/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stripes</a>, ""Aaaaarmy training, sir!"" (Which is odd considering both movies are about ridiculous military situations)
7.  Does he do the splits in training or in the tournament?  Even though it's not explicitly part of the plot, he nonetheless manages to form an upside-down ""T"" during a fight scene.
8.  Does he punch someone in the balls?  Although it's slightly off camera, it appears JCVD delivers three solid punches to the jewels of Sergeant Scott (Lundgren).  Given JCVD's propensity for nut-shots, it's safe to assume knuckle met scrotum.
9.  Does he do a series of flying or 360 kicks? Not only does he fulfill his normal helping of spin kicks, but he adds a few new versions into the mix.
10.  Is his enemy unbeatable?  It sure seems that his enemy is unbeatable.  In the final battle, Deveraux kicks Scott in the face five times in a row, and the only thing Scott does is laugh.
11.  Does he overcome an injury or other hindrance?  Well, technically he's dead, and there's some sort of combination of UniSol injection and ice water bath requirement for keeping a soldier recharged, but otherwise he's good to go.
12.  Does he win?  With the help of a wood chipper - and a final line of, ""You're discharged, Sarge"" - Deveraux literally tears Scott apart.

With some great wire work in some fight scenes, and tons of head shot gun play, the action is top notch for this JCVD iteration.  The plot is interesting enough to have spawned more than one sequel.  And Dolph Lundren makes a solid appearance in the meeting B-action superstars.  What's great is that both main characters are supposed to be resurrected cyborgs, and each of their respective robotic acting ability just happens to be perfect for the role.  Nothing new here; just JCVD being awesome yet again.",1221091200,3,2942,5.077244258872652

And ladies keep in mind when our toys are taken away yours will follow shortly thereafter. Sure this movie may not have any great acting, but actually the directing, costumes, sets, effects, and music aren't bad. Van Damme and Lundgren play soldiers that died in Viet Nam while fighting each other over killing a prisoner. The next thing you know it is thirty years later and they wake up in a special refrigeration truck with the latest in war toys and they are part of special unit designed to go in and perform miraculous fetes of physical endurance and prowess. You know, run down dams and things so they can rescue hostages. Probably why most guys enjoy this still. This is actually probably at the top of the heap of movies made by Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren. Although I must admit I love ""Timecop"" and ""I Come in Peace"". I actually cracked up when they commented on Van Damme's accent in the movie and asked if he was French. So it goes to show they even had a sense of humor.

73458,4,0784011532,"Don't you hate it when the person you're trying to choose a movie with, insists you watch a movie because they haven't seen it for x amount of years, and you simply must watch it? Mind you, I have that idea most of the time myself, only to realise the film wasn't as good as I remembered it.

Universal Soldier was chosen mainly because I've only seen two Jean-Claude Van Damme movies - Sudden Death, and Streetfighter when I was going through my Kylie Minogue phase. (I was very young, give me a break, and I remember nothing about it.)

Two soldiers are serving in Vietnam. Van Damme plays Luc Deveraux, under the command of Sergeant Andrew Scott (Dolph Lundgren). When Scott completely loses it, and starts chopping off ears and wearing them as necklaces (bleurgh), Deveraux has an attack of conscience, and the two soldiers kill each other. After being listed as MIA, the soldiers are complicatedly regenerated, into lean, mean, killing machines, who's memories have been wiped. Now known as GR-44 (Van Damme) and GR-13 (Lundgren), everything is kept top secret.

That is until reporter Veronica Roberts (Ally Walker), with a nose for trouble, stumbles upon the top secretness, when her cameraman (?) is killed. Deveraux has flashbacks, and rescues her before she's killed.

Enter the cross country chase, with both soldiers stripping off, and lying in baths of ice (cold!), but gives the female viewers some nice shots of some very fit men. Did I just drool? It did feel a bit Terminator-esque at points, but thankfully, it managed to get past that, and turn into an actually alright movie. (I say alright, and I've given it four stars. Duh.)

For me, the great thing about this movie was Ally Walker, she was absolutely amazing, and she had lots of great lines. I was bugged continuously throughout the movie that I knew her from somewhere, but the only thing I recognised was a very small role in While You Were Sleeping. There was a great rapport between her and Deveraux, and although the plot is a bit iffy at points (not all the way through), it was made all the better by some great leading characters.

Universal Soldier is completely entertaining, a little gem of a movie, and yes, it does have an iffy plot, but what the hell? It's brilliant.",1203552000,,2257,4.715736040609137

After many years, decades even, of loyal and effective service, a new generation of soldier has been developed. The new generation is stronger with faster reflexes. Of course, in the world of movies there must be a drawback. The drawback is that the new generation has too much arrogance, too little experience, and perhaps way too little common sense.

After a demonstration between the new soldiers, one which has little to do with fighting in the real world, Sgt. Todd is apparently dead and is dropped onto an uninhabited trash world; a huge open-air landfill for civilizations across the inhabited space of mankind. However, Sgt. Todd quickly discovers that the trash world is not uninhabited.

A group of pioneers crashlanded on the planet on the way to another planet, and no one knows they are there. Sgt. Todd has no reason to behave as a soldier towards these people; they do not threaten him and in fact they welcome him to their homes. Eventually they come to distrust his soldierly mein and boot him out of their settlement.

By a complete and bizarre coincidence, the new generation of genetically engineered soldiers has been sent to the trash planet to eradicate the squatters, who are somehow now armed and dangerous, at least so far as the soldiers have been told. Of course, even though Sgt. Todd has been booted out of the settlement he cares for these people and returns to defend them, showing that in actual combat experience and creativity will outweigh sheer strength as long as the odds are somewhat reasonable.

Kurt's character is a perfect blend of Spock and any action hero you care to name. He kills only when necessary, and he has an incredible code of honor. His code of honor extends only to those who act honorably, as we discover in the movie.

The movie is uncharacteristic in that is relies more on the development of Sgt. Todd's character than on special effects and action. The suspense near the end is a bit overly dramatic in places, with more than a little hokum, but in the end the movie is effective and enjoyable.

If you are looking for another variation on the theme of ""Mad Max"" and ""The Road Warrior,"" with a character who is nearly unemotional, then this movie may fit the bill.",1167436800,,2340,4.751231527093596

There is also a beautiful journalist lady, which hangs out with Van Damme.

There is a lot of military action and shooting in this movie. The universal soldiers take part in resolving hostage situations. The first site is a spectacular-looking water dam at a hydro power station. There is also a futuristic-looking huge armoured truck in which the universal soldiers (unisols) live. Their bodies are kept at low temperature and they have to get medical injections in order to stay alive.

There is a large element of fiction in this movie, because dead people cannot be brought back to life in the way that the movie suggests. However, if you suspend disbelief, I'm sure that you will enjoy this high-gear non-stop action flick.

73463,4,0784011532,"Universal Soldier is a pretty cool idea that is executed well, by taking dead soldiers of the military and bringing them back to life, specifically, the very muscular guys.  This is where Van Damme and Lundgren fill in, and we even get to see the massive Ralph Moeller several times (also played the villain Brakus in Best of the Best 2 and a fighter in Gladiator).  For the reborn soldiers, old Vietnam War memories resurface from the beginning of the film, and once again the Van Damme character becomes the good guy and the Lundgren character becomes the villain.

There isn't a huge amount of action in the film, but in between scenes we get to see a lot of Lundgren's bad guy one-liners and attitude.  Van Damme doesn't have many fights either until the end, when he goes up against the Lundgren character.  The 6 minute fight between the 2 is easily the best part of the movie.  They both get to kick some serious you know what on each other.  Its a great fight scene.

Universal Soldier's plot and acting may not be great, but its the concept and supersized muscles that make the movie pretty sweet.  If you are a fan of Van Damme or Lundgren, this is definetly a must see.",1157155200,3,1180,4.4511627906976745
73464,5,0784011532,"Universal Soldier is one of the best action films from Jean Claude Van Damme. The film was released in 1993. The movie is based on an awfully chilly idea of a secret government project to use the reanimated corpses of dead soldiers as Universal Soldiers. These soldiers are really killer combat zombies that are programmed to receive commands remotely. They are extremely efficient killer machines that are impervious to pain, are quick to heal, and pretty much unstoppable although they tend to overheat if they stay active for too long.

In this movie, Jean-Claude Van Damme stars as a man who was supposedly killed in the war in Vietnam. He is revived in a secret biochemical, regenerative experiment as a cyborg that is controlled by the people who made him. The project initially proceeds according to plan. However, Van Damme starts recalling memories in a series of flashes from his past, and he eventually remembers the bloodthirsty, psychotic and vindictive Sergeant (Dolph Lundgren), who is also now turned into a cyborg, and is evil to the core. The fight between them resumes from where they left when they were alive. The action really gets hot when van Damme regains his memory and eventually leads to his freedom from being controlled by his creators. But the creators are not prepared to let Van Damme go free without them doing everything they can to get him back and under their control once again.

Both Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren play their respective roles exceptionally well. The pretty and sexy Alley Walker, who plays the reporter who joins Van Damme on his fight against the Universal Soldier, also gives a good performance.

Those who love action movies will be thrilled by the fierce fist fights, unforgettable stunts and kickboxing action that will compel you to watch it again and again. I recommend anybody who likes Van Damme movies or good action movies to get ""Universal Soldier."" It does not have the best storyline or the best plot, but it is entertaining and exciting all the same.",1156896000,,2031,4.898255813953488

Well, most people who are going to buy the DVD are probably familiar with the movie anyway, so I won't repeat the plot.  Watching it again after several years, I really have to say it's one of the better movies of the action genre, especially when you consider that you have people doing the stunts instead of lots of CGI like in today's movies.

Much better than some of the offerings I've seen on other DVDs of movies that were released in the era of VHS and you just didn't get extras, period.

Granted nobody is going to win any acting awards for this film, but Jean Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren are fairly believable in their respective roles (although Van Damme's southern farm boy roots were less than convincing).  Since practically everyone knows the plot involving two deceased Vietnam soldiers brought back to life as part of a covert super soldier program, no further exposition is necessary.  What is worth noting is that if one accepts this film for what it is, then it succeeds on almost all levels.  There are plenty of explosions, well choreographed fight scenes, appropriately placed one-liners, and intermittent dark humor to keep any action movie fan entertained.  Dolph Lundgren, who plays the villain, provides a lot of the film's jokes as he morbidly delights in inflicting pain on others.  Van Damme once again plays the underdog, but he is earnest in his desire to make his way home so one can't help but root for him.

The 'Special Edition' has some nice bonuses including commentaries by the two leads, the alternate ending (why this bizarre ending was filmed is a mystery), a making of documentary, and a brief look at Van Damme and Lundgren's backgrounds.  This was perhaps the best featurette because it revealed all sorts of fascinating tidbits about the two stars.

The funniest part was when van damme. luc devreaux was eating in the cafe, he wants more and more food. its absolutely hilarious. Also where one of the soldiers eats a lump of raw meat in the supermarket.

This movie has horrible fight scenes that don't appear to be martial arts at all. Basically, Van Damme is in another film which does not capitalize on his martial arts abilities, and forces him into a stiff choreographed position. They found some buff guys, okay, big deal. They put them in a film, and say that they are super soldiers with extra ordinary skills. These guys don't have that. Vin Diesel has far better choreography by himself. I have said this about other films and I will say it about this one as well. The cast & crew benefited from the production of this film, so it doesnt affect them. They go home happy believing they did a good job. You, the consumer, you go and see it on the shelf and recognize a star on the cover and consider buying it. Wrong move as for this film.

73472,4,0784011532,"Dolph Lundgren. Jean-Claude Van Damme. It was only a matter of time before these two muscle heads appeared in the same film, right? Lundgren's claim to fame came with his role as menacing Russian boxer Ivan Drago in the fourth ""Rocky"" installment. He then went on to a lengthy career of low budget B movie actioners that have become increasingly irrelevant (and increasingly hard to find). Van Damme is a different story, although his career has likewise gone into what appears to be an irrevocable tailspin. He started out making kickboxing films, but his appearance in Albert Pyun's ""Cyborg"" helped him move into science fiction and gun heavy action flicks. Of the Van Damme films I have seen, I would say his best effort is director Peter Hyams's 1994 flick ""Time Cop."" Others would probably cite this film, ""Universal Soldier"" as Jean-Claude's finest hour. I disagree. While there is much here to entertain lovers of shoot 'em up action, there really isn't anything very original about the movie. Don't get me wrong; I found plenty to enjoy in ""Universal Soldier,"" but I don't think the movie is the end all be all of lower budget action films as some do.

The gosh darned government is up to their old tricks again in ""Universal Soldier."" Back in the Vietnam War the military started a program to develop perfect soldiers, namely soldiers who would follow orders without question, possess no moral scruples, and ones that could tote around an impressive array of firepower. Problem is the soldiers have to die first before the program leaders can do their work. These reanimated troops, the most important of which are Luc (Van Damme) and Sergeant Scott (Lundgren), now ride around in a specially outfitted trailer fulfilling combat missions. For example, when a bunch of terrorists take over a dam and hold hostages, the military brings in these super soldiers to make quick work of the situation. Nothing is perfect, however, when dealing with a Pentagon program. Universal soldiers need fancy injections of some strange fluid to keep them primed. Their bodies are also quite susceptible to temperature fluctuations; so much so that keeping these guys on ice is a daily ritual. What else can we expect with a bunch of dead guys? Things would quickly get rather rank if you kept reanimated corpses running around in the desert for hours on end. Fortunately, operations leader Colonel Perry (Ed O'Ross) has everything firmly under control. Or does he?

Nope. Luc perished in Vietnam in an attempt to stop Sergeant Scott from committing a dastardly deed against the local populace. He managed to bring the crazed NCO down before expiring, but memories of the incident begin to reemerge in Luc's mind. Before you can say, ""I will break you"" Luc escapes from the program with the help of a nosy reporter named Veronica (Ally Walker) and Sergeant Scott goes nuts. What follows is predictable in the extreme as Veronica and Luc roam the landscape in an effort to find the man responsible for turning him into a zombie, Dr. Gregor (Jerry Orbach), and then return home to his dear parents in Louisiana. Sergeant Scott's new mission involves hunting down Luc in order to turn him into dog food. Hotels are shot up, vehicles explode, bodies cartwheel through the air, and the inevitable showdown between Scott and Luc properly--if predictably--entertains. The movie even throws in a humorous scene involving Luc chowing down on plates and plates of food at a diner before beating a bunch of locals senseless (he hasn't eaten in decades, after all). Will Luc survive long enough to meet up with the 'rents for a heartwarming reunion? Will Veronica live long enough to file the story of a lifetime? How many people will Sergeant Scott kill? Tune in and find out.

I enjoyed ""Universal Soldier"" immensely despite the numerous plot holes. For instance, the movie insists on telling us that Luc needs to cool off with ice quite frequently or else he begins to wear down like one of those wind up toys. The use of ice becomes rather slipshod later on in the movie when it is impossible for Luc to take a break from battling Scott. In fact, in several scenes we see Van Damme's character wheezing and moaning like a senior citizen only to return to full combat readiness a few seconds later. Hmmm. Moreover, how in the heck is it possible for a guy who died twenty years ago to eat solid food with no ill effects? Easy--the script insisted on it. But who really cares, though? It's not like we're watching this film to see marvelous performances or deep, intricate dialogue. ""Universal Soldier"" exists to show us lots of explosions and bloody carnage, and we thankfully get plenty of that. Sergeant Scott has a thing for killing anyone who gets in his way AND for carrying around necklaces made out of human ears, which definitely helps his character stand out in a crowd. Luc isn't above inciting a little mayhem himself as evidenced during his bone crushing fight with Scott. By the time the credits roll most action film fans will likely let out a sigh of moderate satisfaction over ""Universal Soldier.""

The Special Edition DVD contains plenty of extras, including an audio commentary with Van Damme and Lundgren, a making of feature, background information on the careers of both stars, an alternate ending that would have put the kibosh on the sequel had the filmmakers ran with it, and a bunch of action film trailers--""The Rambo Trilogy,"" ""The Punisher,"" and a couple of others. Perhaps the most interesting thing about this movie is learning Roland Emmerich directed it. The success of ""Universal Soldier"" gave him enough clout to move on to bigger, but not necessarily better, films. I recommend watching this one and skipping the lousy sequel.",1109203200,21,5743,4.8631256384065376
73473,4,0784011532,"[This is the review I submitted some time ago for an earlier edition of this release. This new 'Special Edition' also has a few nice extras, including a making-of documentary, an alternate ending, and interviews with Van Damme and Lundgren. The interviews are particularly good; Lundgren is sharp and intelligent, and Van Damme's exuberant charm is infectious.]

I like this movie. Roland Emmerich turns out decent work when he starts with a decent idea.

And this movie is based on an extremely cool idea: a secret government project to use the reanimated corpses of dead soldiers as 'UniSols' ('UNIversal SOLdiers'). They're like killer combat zombies -- equipped to receive commands remotely, impervious to pain, quick to heal, and pretty much unstoppable although they tend to overheat if they stay active for too long.

The plot: Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren were in Viet Nam together, Lundgren wacked out and started killing innocent civilians, Van Damme tried to stop him, and they wound up killing each other. (This is all in the first five minutes of the film.) Their corpses were packed in ice and shipped off to the UniSol project, and after the opening credits roll, they're on an antiterrorist mission as part of a S.W.A.T. team from hell. But a few things start to jog their memories, and it isn't long before the two of them are at it again . . .

You don't have to be a particular fan of the Muscles from Brussels to enjoy the concept here, but Van Damme is actually pretty effective in his role. At any rate the story is briskly paced and about as believable as stuff like this ever gets. It's nicely done if you like this sort of thing (which I do).

Ally Walker does nicely here too, as a newswoman who winds up accompanying Van Damme in his, um, travels. If you enjoyed her in _Profiler_ (as I did, and I stopped watching the show after she left), you'll like her in this.

An entertaining action-SF flick, then, and a cut above the usual 'B-movie' fare. This probably isn't Emmerich's best work (it seems to me to try a little too hard to be _The Terminator_), but it's well done.",1099440000,8,2113,4.651474530831099

The movie itself, well, most everyone buying this movie probably knows teh story and if you don't, there is not much there - just a sci fi, action flick, poised to develop aenough character to set up action scenes and fights.

Van Damme and Dolph play two 2 vietnam Vets who kill each other during the Vietnam War.

Dolph, plays the psychotic and vindictive Staff Seargeant from the Army who wants to kill any Vietnamese (guilty or innocent) in path.
When Van Damme, tells the Sergeant that it's time to pull out , the crazy Sergeant sees him as a traitor and proceeds to beat up his comrade while Lungren tries to save the innocent Vietnam girl the Sergeant is holding hostage.

Her name is Ally Walker. She hasn't been in many films, but ""Universal Soldier"" was one of her first, and most well-known.

 The action scenes are solid, and at times quite unique. The main problem with the film is that there is no real explanation of how or why these UniSols were created. How exactly did they do this (bring the dead back to life)? The answer in the film was too brief and simple.

73480,4,0784011532,"First of all, if the viewer is looking for a deep, sensitive film, keep looking . . . this is pure action with a dose of sensitivity thrown in to make the main character more appealing. The premise is clever: Technology creates a new breed of supermen to be soldiers to spare the lives of the regular populace. These Unisols are powerful, tireless and self-healing, with neither conscience nor free will to get in the way of being the perfect fighting machines . . . until something goes wrong.  Two soldiers who died as mortal enemies---Van Damme's Luc and Dolph Lundgren's Scott---regain their supposedly purged memories and go haywire.  Luc simply wants to go home, and enlists a reporter to help him.  Scott wants Luc dead, and he'll destroy anyone or anything that gets in his way.
This is a surprisingly good movie, given the genre. Its major weakness, amazingly enough, is not the acting; it's the writing, which leaves some holes in the plot big enough to drive a truck through. The process for creating the Unisols from dead men is glossed over and technically quite weak, especially since this is supposed to be a science-fiction movie. Things are a little too simplistic, with the military predictably the bad guys and the crusading reporter a bit too self-serving and self-righteous.
However, its flaws are minor and are easy to overlook in light of the movie's good qualities. The action sequences are well-choreographed and the special effects are solidly done. One such effect was the removal of body hair from the men playing the artificially enhanced soldiers, which gave them a plastic appearance. The blood, wounds and explosions are all quite realistic and definitely not for the squeamish. By far, the best aspects of this flick are both the special effects and the acting. Ally Walker is both tough and funny as the reporter who helps Luc in his quest for information and his journey home. Dolph Lundgren is creepy and convincing as the psychotic Andrew Scott, with a healthy dose of black humor thrown in with his cruelty. Quite surprisingly, Jean-Claude Van Damme does an excellent job of conveying Luc Devereaux as a vulnerable, almost childlike man emerging from a long nightmare. Since there isn't much dialogue, he uses his facial expressions, particularly his large eyes, and his body language much more effectively than his words. The rest of the cast is also effective and believable in their roles, even the other big hulks they cast as the rest of the soldiers. Like in Terminator, the amount of dialogue is kept to a minimum and therefore the actors' shortcomings are not put on display.

73483,4,0784011532,"Action fans can't be without this Damme DVD, this one of his best films. The DVD includes both a teaser and a theatrical trailer; you also find some production notes and a short behind the scenes featurette. The movie is displayed in widescreen format and the audio is in Dolby Digital 5.1. I would have liked to see a little more from great action film like this, but at least it didn't get left behind on VHS like so many of the other early nineties action films. Now don't get me wrong this isn't an Oscar winning film but there is something about mindless action films of this caliber you just don't find in current cinema anymore. Some people say that's a good thing, but come on, Van Damme can kick really high!!",1016928000,2,718,4.406015037593985
73484,4,0784011532,Probally Van Damme's best movie to date. as he must fend off Dolph Lundgren after being reanimated by the government. The Action is done well and the story weak but credible.,996278400,,174,4.645161290322581

73486,5,0784011532,"This is the movie that you identift with ean Claude Van Damme. Of course Van Damme is the hero of this film. The villain is the very personification of evil. The force of evil is well played by Dolph Lungren. The two are part of a program cal UnoSol. They were killed in the Vietnam war. Lungren was an unworthy soldier while Van Damme served honorably. They had conflicts while still alive and in Vietnam. As robot soldiers they resume their life and death struggle. They battle all over the country. Lungren shows himself to be a vicious killing machine. It is up to Van Damme to stop him. Besides being an excellent movie the ending caps it off. Be sure to see this movie,you will not be dissapointed.",992736000,,704,4.465116279069767
