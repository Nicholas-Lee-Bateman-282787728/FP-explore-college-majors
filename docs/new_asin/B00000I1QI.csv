7909565,5,B00000I1QI,"I you can play VHS tapes, and you are a beginning to intermediate exerciser, this is a good comprehensive video.

It is split up in three 15-minute sections, one each for aerobics, strength training, and stretching.  Each section has a warmup and cooldown, making it easy to do only one if you feel like it.

There are three exercisers, and different options are shown.  In the aerobics section, one exerciser does high impact.  In the strength training section, two exercisers don't use weights and show slightly different form for the floor exercises.  1-5 pound weights are suggested, but I have used heavier ones safely as I got stronger.

Cuing is good, particularly regarding what to do with your knees.

Although I've mostly advanced past this video, I still use it sometimes when I want something fast and less challenging, although with heavier weights for the strength training.  I wish they had it on DVD, because it's really better than a lot of newer ones.

If you get the video, watch for the resort guest on his beach walk behind the outdoor set!",1471305600,,1061,4.78021978021978
7909566,4,B00000I1QI,I like how this video is broken into 3 15 min segments. The aerobic section is my favorite. I like how I can set my pace to low or high. The toning section was good but I felt like it was over way to quickly. Of course this could be a blessing to many. =D I'm not big on stretching for more than 10-15 sec per move so the stretch segmant wasn't my favorite. Over all the choreography of this video was well done.,1203465600,4,412,3.9166666666666665
7909567,5,B00000I1QI,"I was a beginner to aerobics and had tried others and could not get the steps down.  This particular workout just clicked with me!  I loved the scenery and the workout was easy to understand, but still challenging.  I have actually worn out my copy and just ordered another! Can't wait to get it!",1105142400,3,296,4.444444444444445
7909568,3,B00000I1QI,"This workout is 45 minutes total, but also broken out into 15 minute segments (1 aerobics, 1 toning, 1 stretching each with its own warmup).  It is at a fairly beginning level.
The look of the tape totally appeals to the Redbook demographic -- kind of ""plain jane"".  Not exactly my style, but if you actually subscribe to that magazine, you may like the look of it.  I found it pretty boring compared to other workouts.",1083542400,2,419,4.4868421052631575
7909569,5,B00000I1QI,"This workout tape is a wonderful way to burn calories, tone and stretch out each morning.  I love the beach and the background on this workout tape is beautiful.
Excellent fitness instructor, Judi Jenre!",952473600,8,203,4.970588235294118
