8309173,5,B001HNITMU,This is an awesome and professional documentary of The Trial of Saddam Hussein and I highly recommend it to others. We must never forget this moment in history.,1397347200,,160,4.75
8309174,5,B001HNITMU,"It was interesting to see the actual trial rather than hear a commentator's perception of the incident.  Too many incidents are only partly fed to us or slanted.  Though I am certainly not a fan of Hussein, the trial did not seem like a fair trial.  Though not perfect, it makes me appreciate our court system.  I'm glad the hanging was blurred.
It held my interest and I think it was well done.
I would like to see more documentaries like this, but not necessarily so gruesome.",1396396800,,478,4.459770114942529
