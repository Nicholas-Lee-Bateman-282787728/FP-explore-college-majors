8560507,4,B00B17SQ7A,"I 've been looking for years for a live dvd of Sebastian Bach or Skid Row. These are fairly decent shows,three in all. Thank goodness this was recorded while he's still some what young. The problem I have is with the 5.1. There is way too much bass other then that I enjoyed the shows.",1369440000,,285,4.2
8560508,5,B00B17SQ7A,This Record Sounds Awesome For A Live Record. If You Love Skid Row or Sebastian's Solo Material Then I Reccomend It.,1368576000,,116,4.571428571428571
8560509,2,B00B17SQ7A,"Lemme tell ya, I always loved and still love Bass.  He's unapologetically metal and not a typical metal meat head either.  He was wrongfully thrown in with the glam contemporaries of his day but his skills as a vocalist and later choices of material proved him worthy of the love of true metal heads world wide.  It is for this reason and with a heavy heart that I have to report disappointment of the songs being repeated several times over. Although,  it was clear on the provided set list before I ordered this DVD, I still feel it woulda' had some other cool outtakes or something to redeem what I knew was to be the same songs repeated too many times.  Bass does offer like 3 current and new vids featuring his totally hot chick though.  The vids are pretty cool.  The thing is that, ya gotta support real metal...wherever AND whenever possible.  If a guy like Bass is gonna fly the flag into battle for metal then the least we can do is to support him!",1367107200,,958,4.372881355932203
8560510,1,B00B17SQ7A,"As a huge fan of both his music in Skid Row and his solo albums, I bought this DVD in good faith, knowing what a kick-ass live vocalist Bach is with those powerhouse vocal chords!

On this DVD you will find three different festival shows, so you won't be getting a full set, but each show has eight or nine tracks, so potentially this could've been very good value for money. Unfortunately, the setlists on all three shows are almost identical rendering the whole idea rather pointless. Instead of offering up a variety of tracks throughout the three shows, you're left with repeated performances of the same songs.

However, as one of the greatest live rock vocalists of recent times, I would've gladly overlooked this minor gripe were it not for the fact that the shows themselves are a major let down. Each show has been overdubbed by Bach in the studio (Bach himself has openly admitted this). I know a lot of artists do this, but I'm not talking about the usual tidying up and fixing of the odd bum note. He has re-recorded the entire vocals so they sound identical to their studio counterparts. There are some hilariously cringeful parts on the DVD where Bach is heard belting out notes and yet he isn't even singing or holding the mic to his mouth.

This really is one of the worst live DVDs I've ever seen. I have no problem with an artist fixing minor glitches in the studio - as Bach himself has said, they all do it. But to re-record the entire setlist of a concert DVD and try and pass it off as a legitimate live experience is just plain wrong.",1365379200,,1557,4.456140350877193
8560511,5,B00B17SQ7A,"Once again no one can kick azz at the Mic like Sebastian Bach!  Totally entertaining video from start to finish, supernatural vocals, AWESOME setlists, great camera footage, Sebastian blows 'em all away again and again, including myself!  Great new addition to my Bach library, this flick is going to get worn out.  Bach never ceases to amaze me year after year! Definitely worth owning and watching over and over and over and over...",1365120000,,434,4.917808219178082
