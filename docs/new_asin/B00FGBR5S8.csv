5990949,3,B00FGBR5S8,"Interesting, but too short. Would have also been interesting to have comments from the non-gay public. Impressive tho how advanced they are. And why they had to use a well known porn star/actor, to be the interviewer I don't know. Not much journalistic views. I thought it was a bit self indulgent when it came to him. Trying to come across as a serious film maker with journalistic intent. From that aspect it falls a bit flat. His lack of experience shows.",1390262400,9,458,4.597560975609756
5990950,4,B00FGBR5S8,"Viewers may expect one thing if they are GLBT and another if they are not. The director Lucas ,a person famous in the world of adult video, has made a leap into another venue and may well surprise some viewers from all sides on how engrossing this documentary actually is . Think you know what Israel is like. You may be wrong . At least his perspective as a Jewish immigrant from Russia,  to France and eventually to the U.S. was revealing to this Humanist of no specific denomination . How amazingly sophisticated ,and lush parts of this nation are. He argues for it being a vacation destination and convinced this elderly man he is correct. Forget the freedoms GLBT experience in Israel ( they are amazing not only in this part of the world surrounded  by non- democracies but in many other lands) ,and realize the opportunities for a great holiday whatever your orientation. Get this video and you may be planning a trip as well as expanding your knowledge of a land many of us think we know so much about and may not. Go for it!",1388880000,12,1033,4.4603174603174605

5990952,5,B00FGBR5S8,"I am soo glad to see how the USA could really do much better and be more open in area usually thought of as dangerous, unforgiving and ruthless. In conflict man-kind can either thrive or become less. Here it is seen, very well, that humanity can be more accepting and open, while not burning in the flames of hell. Good job.",1413936000,2,324,4.327868852459017

5990956,4,B00FGBR5S8,Was really surprised by this short film.  Had no idea that Isreal was this open and welcoming of the gay population.  Defintely changes my perspective of this country.  Good job!,1408492800,4,178,4.866666666666666

8615560,3,B00FGBR5S8,"coming from a pornographer, and that's pretty much what he would call himself, there was precious little undressing in this docudrama, mostly how Israel more pro gay than its neighbors and Israelis more like us than not. It was political in a nonthreatening way, like when the Oxford Debating Union invited Michael Lucas to speak, you kind of know what you're getting but in this case, less seemed a little bit less, at least it did to me.",1440460800,,439,4.641025641025641
8615561,5,B00FGBR5S8,"Many moons ago, I was fortunate in being able to cross-train with Israeli soldiers.  Man, that was not only very difficult and strenuous, but I was introduced to ""The City,"" Tel Aviv, especially at night.  I own 2 of the books that Michael Douglas published about the men in Israel.  Oh! Yes! Those pictures only service the tip of the(I will be polite in wording)iceberg.  While this film can and does go into further detail, certain rules of decorum do not allow to further elaborate!  See it!  Enjoy all the ""Eye Candy!""  NJMJr!!",1435449600,,532,4.655913978494624

8615565,4,B00FGBR5S8,"Good information presented here.  I was in Israel decades ago, and wow! what a difference a few decades can make. I believe one of the goals of the filmmaker is to educate viewers regarding the status of human rights, particularly gay rights, in  Israel. Mission accomplished...mostly. However, where is the opposing view(s)?  I find it difficult to believe that in this somewhat theocratic state, there is not opposition or even enlightened debate regarding the passel of gay rights touted in this film.  Moreover, it is very distressing that Israel continues to deny human rights to their neighbors (the Palestinians), who deserve a homeland also.  This film is encouraging, but the larger, more urgent matter seems to be the matter of coexistence, Until that issue makes progress, all other human rights issues, though vital, will be bittersweet and short lived.",1420502400,2,865,5.194244604316546
