8415606,5,B00442R0IK,I enjoyed seeing the show again.  Now I have this dvd in my collection to watch over and over  when I need to.,1412726400,,110,3.739130434782609
8415607,5,B00442R0IK,"As a pilot I found this a great DVD. Have seen it twice and look forward to sharing it with my QBers . Hope to get to the museum this Spring sometime. Great job one and all,",1391212800,,173,3.7027027027027026
8415608,4,B00442R0IK,"This is a well made documentary: story, cinematography, narration, and editing are all professional. It looks great on the big screen. Hugh Downs narration adds character to the story (it's not corny). It's an interesting account of the challenges to fly WWI planes from Colorado to Dayton, Ohio. I like the blend of archival footage with current planes. You'll talk about this video with fellow enthusiasts.

I purchased the DVD directly at the VAFM museum in Hudson, Colorado (VAFM dot ORG). Although the museum is small, it's worth the effort too.",1350259200,2,550,5.043956043956044
8415609,2,B00442R0IK,"While visually stunning, the corny dialog of near god like aviators and the romance of death and war killed the whole movie. Of the 5 pilots I watched this with, only 1 gave it 4 stars, everyone else gave it 2 or 3 (I gave it 2). Hugh Downs, the narrator, had to let you know within the first few minutes that he was a pilot and then in the next 60 minutes proceeded to do his best make flying sound like only exceptional people can fly.",1303516800,3,437,4.0344827586206895
8415610,5,B00442R0IK,"""This is as close to flying in a WWI airplane as you'll likely ever get without being shot at or crashing (both of which you'll get a taste of, too.) Beautifully photographed and perfectly scored; the love, care, and expertise of these pilots is as rare as their airplanes.""  -Tony Bill, Academy Award Winner",1285113600,3,308,4.703703703703703
