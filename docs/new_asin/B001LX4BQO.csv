8319952,5,B001LX4BQO,"I did like this video a lot, (again not a Hollywood production) .
Although, I felt there was something missing. The longbow is
the star of the story, and there wasn't much about the social reforms
that came from this battle. Still a good dvd for your collection.",1402185600,,262,4.479166666666667

8319954,2,B001LX4BQO,"Historian John D'Emilio wrote something like, ""I disagree with historians who present 'great men' as what changes history.  It's really inventions and ideologies that change history.""  This work practices that idea by discussing the longbow.
How could outnumbered Brits travel to France and win a battle against the French army?  Due to the longbow.  This work describes why it was helped, mentioning that it was all the rage until guns were invented.
This only has one interviewee and he speaks with a soft voice.  This is a doc by Brits, for Brits, and about Brits.  Americans might not be as fascinated by it.  This has lots of cheesy reenactments.  However, I give the makers credit because it cost money to hire all those actors and buy all those creative-anachronism props.
If you like Robin Hood, Excalibur, Sword in the Stone, this involves factual stuff from that era.",1266364800,9,877,4.918367346938775
