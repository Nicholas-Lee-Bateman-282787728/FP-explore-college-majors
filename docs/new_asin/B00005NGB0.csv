7947058,4,B00005NGB0,"I have to say this DVD was good to watch, although I wish they had shown more of Jodeci's live performances. Also, would of been good to see more of Devante and Dalvin perhaps a one on one interview with them.",1310515200,2,209,4.121951219512195

Thanks guys'

Oh, the throwback tour from boyz 2 men should be a goodie, can't wait to see them live here in wellington (New Zealand)",1123545600,,392,4.430555555555555
7947061,5,B00005NGB0,This was the GREATEST except for the nudity.  They could have left that..out especially for the kids sake.  Overall It was great. I hope they do more videos like this but appropriate for kids as well.  Children love K-ci and JoJo too.,1059004800,4,234,4.523809523809524
7947062,5,B00005NGB0,"This DVD is off the hook.  It has every great Jodeci video from STAY to Crazy.......It even has an un-cut version of How do U want it with Tupac.  Not for children though.  lately brought back so many memories, it has the radio version and the Unplugged version.  if your a Jodeci fan, this you must get this.
It is worth the $..., i would sell it for [more] though.",1023580800,6,366,4.185714285714286
7947063,5,B00005NGB0,"I am so glad that this DVD was put together!  I finally can see and hear them sing!  Wooo, Dalvin and DeVante are sooooooo fine!  These men are so talented and I am glad that they are keeping this WONDERFUL entertainment going!",1014595200,2,227,4.357142857142857
7947064,5,B00005NGB0,"Initially, I was skeptical about the quality of this DVD, based upon the relatively unknown production company. But, let me tell you, it definitely delivers the goods. It's a tremendous value.
First, there's a 70 minute documentary that includes rare studio footage, a number of informative interviews, the adult ""How Do You Want It"" video, and a home-video version of ""Thug In Me"". But, the real reasons to buy this DVD are the DVD-extras. It includes FIFTEEN full-length videos going back to ""Forever My Lady"" and including newer cuts like ""Crazy"". The videos are packaged very nicely and include a number of surprises (remix versions, shots of people from the Uptown family past, Suge Knight, etc.) In addition, there's a bonus 45 minute concert from the Apollo. You get some great live music and a very raw and authentic sound. Given the historical depth of this DVD, it's an easy purchase if you like Jodeci, K-Ci and JoJo, or both. Ideally, the videos would have been in Dolby Digital 5.1, but that's my only small quibble with the final product. The production values, DVD menus, and ease of use are first-rate, and I'm looking forward to more ""Uncovered"" DVD's in the future.",1003190400,4,1183,4.861386138613861
