703966,4,6303662560,"Never has a girl with so little done so much. When a 1920s has-been showgirl's husband shoots a burglar in her apartment, ""Roxie Hart"" (Ginger Rogers) decides to take the wrap. Why? Good business...and because outside of 15 minutes in the pen she becomes the biggest little murderess in old Chicago. Based on a true story, but this time played strictly for laughs, the bawdy, gaudy and luscious Roxy kicks up her high-stepping heels into one of the most publicized trials of the last century. There's much to admire in the story and Rogers is outstanding as the vixen turned hot property. Adolph Menjou costars as Roxy's ubiquitous attorney.
TRANSFER: Kiss! Kiss! Bang! Bang! This one's a winner. Despite a few scenes that lay claim to considerable film grain and minor mis-registration (resulting in some minor pesky halos) this DVD is minted from a remarkably clean camera negative. The gray scale is wonderfully realized, with rich, deep, solid blacks. Occasionally the contrast level appears a tad on the low side but only occasionally. For the most part what you get is a genuinely impressive looking transfer. The audio has been rechanneled to stereo with predictable dated characteristics.
EXTRAS: A couple of trailers that illustrate just how awful this DVD might have looked if the good people at Fox hadn't worked some digital magic on this restored print.
BOTTOM LINE: Get ready to shoot it out with ""Roxie Hart"" on DVD!",1109980800,8,1431,4.966666666666667
703967,5,6303662560,"We all know about the 2002 Academy Award Winning Musical ""Chicago"", starring Catherine Zeta-Jones, Richard Gere and Rene Zellweger, but not too many people knew that this story had been filmed before as plain comedy in 1942.

Ginger Rogers does an excellent job portraying the rather vulgar & low-brow, but very appealing Roxie Hart, who is being judged for shooting a man, something she, in fact, didn't do...but, which oddly enough, she must pretend she did, in order to gain public notoriety & ""stardom"", in the late `20s Chicago!

She has to convince a Jury (integrated by men-only) to acquit her not-guilty, the poor young thing! (Rogers), helpless, shy, ""demure"", ...she just had to fight for ""her honor""....and in the process she (hilariously) displays (in front of the Jury) many-a-smile and lots of ""legs"" (and batting eyelashes too!), to obtain it!!

Adolphe Menjou is excellent as her attorney, the ""best in town"", guiding her through all kind of schemes to gain both the acquittal and the press-coverage she so desperately needs to show ""her talents"" and become a ""public name""...BTW, you have to watch Rogers dance the blackbottom!

George Montgomery is good as a young reporter who falls for Roxie, and the rest of the cast is filled with great character actors like Lynne Overman, Nigel Bruce, Spring Byington, William Frawley, Sara Allgood, Phil Silvers,...all of whom give expert and flawless performances.

The story was filmed before as a silent in 1927, as ""Chicago"", with Phyllis Haver as Roxie Hart.

Fox's DVD edition is great, giving us a great, sharp, crisp (in glorious Black & white) copy of the film.",1093046400,36,1628,5.011111111111111
703968,5,6303662560,"I got this movie for Christmas yesterday and I love it!  I have seen the movie ""Chicago"" many times and have seen the Broadway musical many times on a tape I have.  This is probably the most likeable of all of them because it's clean.  They had to follow the Hays Code with motion pictures back then, so that certainly added to its cleanliness.  The movie is a version of ""Chicago"" that all members of the family can enjoy, unlike the current movie and stage show which are only appropriate for ages 13 and up.  Ginger Rogers seems perfect for Roxie because she gives off believable innocence, unlike Reinking or Zellwegar who not only killed their lovers, but also were too fake for the role.  Reinking talked too fast and Zellwegar was just not the right choice.  Rogers is a great Roxie, because she is just like the one in the original play, even though the musical's version is based on Rogers's incarnation.  This is my favorite type of movie anyway because I'm a fan of old black&white movies.",1072396800,10,1000,4.5474860335195535

703970,4,6303662560,"I watched this out of curiousity after becoming a fan of Chicago the movie. It's fun to compare and contrast the modern version against this Ginger Rogers vehicle. Check out familiar characters (such as the prison matron ""Mrs."" Morton and Mary Sunshine) new characters (the reporter who has a crucial role in the end) and even missing characters (no Velma Kelley.)
This 1942 film has the title character as a woman on trial for shooting a man who is strongly implied to be her lover. Unlike the Roxie Hart in Chicago, this Roxie is innocent and only on trial for publicity to bolster her show business career. Rogers is a lot of fun and chews the scenery as the gum snapping Roxie. In retrospect, it seems a natural that this story became a musical. Aside from a brief tap dance sequence, it's too bad Rogers couldn't show off her musical talents here.
Make note to watch for the totally different but funny ending.",1050192000,17,915,4.619631901840491
703971,4,6303662560,"Most people these days will want to see this film in order to compare it to the musical CHICAGO. ROXIE HART was the film adaptation of a previous stage hit CHICAGO, which introduced to the world the character Roxie Hart and her attorney Billy Flynn. I think it would be a shame if that was the only reason people watched this. Ginger Rogers turned in one of the half dozen best performances of her career in the title role (though in 1942 I think she was better in Billy Wilder's film debut as a director, in THE MAJOR AND THE MINOR). For those who only know her from her musicals paired with Fred Astaire, this film could be a surprise. Ginger had actually managed by 1942 a number of excellent non-musical comedic roles. It is ironic to compare this film with the 2002 musical version, and realize that the nonmusical version starred a musical star, while the musical starred a nonmusical actress (though Renee Zellweger acquitted herself very well indeed).
Adolph Menjou is great as Billy Flynn. Menjou is sometimes today remembered more for his nonscreen activities than his acting. He cooperated with the House Un-American Activities Committee in the forties in ferreting out ""communists"" in Hollywood, which has placed him historically in a rather poor light. He is also remembered for being one of the best dressed men of the 20th century, appearing regularly at the top of lists of the best dressed men in the world for years. He was a star of the silent screen, but while he made a number of very good films in the sound era (including a tremendous role as a corrupt French officer in the great Stanley Kubrick anti-war film PATHS OF GLORY), his success was haphazard.
This is a very satisfying film, and one can enjoy it either on its own merits or by comparing it with the recent Oscar-winning musical and Tony-winning stage musical. Either way, it is a film that the more recent versions shouldn't make us forget.",1050019200,49,1925,4.68141592920354

It was interesting to compare all this material together, even with the current movie version, which I highly recommend, this is the return of the high quality movie musical known to be dead for decades.

The  movie's chief asset is Ginger Rogers, who gives the greatest performance of  her career. She's fearless enough to play Roxie as a vain, selfish  knucklehead and skillful enough to somehow make her sympathetic. Plus she  does two wonderful solo dances that demonstrate once and for all that she  had absolutely no need of her ex-partner... whatshisname. And, finally,  those legs... wow. The movie has slight flaws: Roxie has been made innocent  of murder (maybe) and a fairly icky framing device has been added. And, of  course, the Kander and Ebb songs are missed.

704139,4,6303662560,"The five stars are mainly for the crisp black and white print.  In this rather stingy release, we get the movie, two versions of the film's previews and a rather self-serving group of 20th Century Fox movie trailers, although the latter might want to make you see 'Star' if you didn't know more anything more about that dreary offering.  But ... back to Roxie,  This 1942 is a 'cross-over' version bridges the drama of the DeMille silent film and the recent musical film by giving its star, Ginger Rogers, a couple of chances to kick up her heels a la her work in the series of famous RKO musicals she did with Fred Astaire.  In those days, Ginger was known primarily as Fred's partner.  It's hard to tell which of the films of the 'saga' of Roxie is closest to the original play, but this film has characters who don't appear in the silent version or the musical version and appear here for the first time.  The Film Code (in full force in 1942) required some of the events to be 'cleaned up' and a tacked on an ending that made it all morally decent. The opening scenes firmly place the narration (told in flash back) in the 'roaring twenties' and the actors, for the most part, try to carry it off ... everyone, that is, but Ginger.  She is pure 1940s in her make-up and costumes, which makes her 'acting' like a gum-chewing, hip-swinging flapper a bit out of sync with the surroundings.  I don't know why, but she always seems to appear much larger than anyone else.  Maybe it's the hair.  Adolph Menjou, as the attorney, should be the one on trial for grand theft, because he 'steals' all the scenes in which he's involved.  A group of able contract players make up the rest of the cast, including Iris Adrian.  Too bad she wasn't used more.  She might even had made a hot Roxie.  To sum up, this is a pleasantly diverting film ... an early memento of William Wellman's directing talents ... wavering uncomfortably between the two other films that tell the same story.  If you want more Ginger without Fred, you might try the soaper, 'Kitty Foyle'.",1384387200,3,2053,4.481182795698925

I found the movie to be more like a stage production than a movie I think it encompassed all of (2) sets.  Ginger just
pilled on the sleazy sexy double crossing wife just too much even for 1942.

Over looked is George Montgomery, he was a handsome hunk and had the voice rarely closely resembling Clark Gable.  In the stable of pretty boys that fox had back then along with Tyrone Power, John Payne wonder how he got over looked???

You have to realize this movie was made in 1942 and 3 years later we had Joan Crawford in Mildred Piece which is light year away from this silly little movie.

704218,5,6303662560,"Roxie Hart, 1942 film

Roxie Hart is a showgirl who is accused of murder of a boyfriend (she is married). Will she be hanged, or will a pretty face affect an all-male jury? The story mocked the newspapers who compete to provide details about her personal life. [Are things much different today?] The judge never fails an opportunity to get into a newsphoto.

Her lawyer, Billy Flynn, has a reputation for taking on seemingly hopeless cases. Will he get a ""not guilty"" verdict from the all-male jury (who appreciate a beautiful women)?

Please take notes there will be a quiz.

Alternately you can take a deep cleansing breath and enjoy this movie. It is fun.

Plot: This guy gets killed. In this version Roxie Hart (Ginger Rogers) is more or less innocent, but takes the fall in the hopes of turning her notoriety into a dancing career.
As the star of the murder story of the century, or until the next murder of the century, she quickly becomes the sweetheart of the prison and the darling of the press. There is a parallel story about Homer Howard (George Montgomery) the one reporter who digs out the real story and tells it as flashback but mostly his character is a drag on everything. His foil is cynical and senior reporter Jake Callahan (Lynne Overman). Jake gets to say all the things we wish we were smart enough to have said.

Amos Hart (George Chandler) the disposable husband sells everything to get the great and even more cynical lawyer Billy Flynn (Adolphe Menjou) as Roxie's defense lawyer.

What follows is a classic media and court room circus. Remember this is a 1942 movie. I do mean Classic.

If you have only seen Ginger Rogers as a sophisticated actress and brilliant dancer, her Roxie Hart will give you an entirely new appreciation for her acting chops. Her every gum chewing, cheaply coiffed (deliberately low class hair style) close up and her hardly sly efforts to show some leg add to the comic proportions of this movie. Overall, it is not fair to compare the most recent musical Chicago to this movie, but the short tap dance on the stairs by Miss Rogers is at once more eloquent and better for its movie than the over choreographed limp ""I Cant Do it Alone"" serves in the newer productions.

Adolphe Menjou's is a brilliant Billy Flynn. He plays the slimy lawyer straight, but with nice small comic flourishes and grand movie lawyer gestures. Younger views may pick up that this Flynn is the model for Futurama's Hyper Chicken lawyer.

704226,4,6303662560,"Ginger Rogers dazzles in this remake of the 1927 silent film ""Chicago"", entitled ROXIE HART, based on the Maurine Dallas Watkins play. Whilst it's severely hampered by the restrictions of the Production Code, 1942's ROXIE HART still gives a flavourful enough soupcn of the original material (which would later be turned into the legendary Broadway musical ""Chicago""); and Ginger Rogers is a lively Roxie.

In the ""bad old days"" of Chicago in the 1920's, Roxie Hart (Ginger Rogers), a frustrated, fame-seeking housewife, is jailed for the murder of her boyfriend.  At the Cook County Jail, she's the hottest headline in town, and can afford the services of Chicago's slickest defence lawyer, Billy Flynn (Adolphe Menjou).  But Chicago's a fickle city when it comes to murderous dames seeking more than five minutes of fame.  Almost at once, Roxie is eclipsed by ""Two-Gun"" Gertie (Iris Adrian); so in order to milk her trial, she'll have to resort to drastic measures...

Ginger Rogers smacks, slaps, winks and taps her way through a murderously funny turn as Roxie Hart; one of her most successful comedy performances of the period.  Whilst she'd prove she could also bring home the trophies for a pure dramatic performance (1942's ""Kitty Foyle""), when it came to saucy comediennes, Rogers was in a league all by herself.

Adolphe Menjou is an unlikely yet wily Billy Flynn; Spring Byington is the ""sob sister"" Mary Sunshine, and the film also features William Frawley from ""I Love Lucy"" as a barkeep.  Pure class all the way!  The DVD includes two short trailers, plus trailers from other Fox movies.",1300406400,,1600,5.007547169811321

I've never seen an actress pull off a billy goat style of attack before.  The movie is enjoyable.  And the leading man in the form of George Montgomery is quite easy on the eyes! Incidentally, the actor who portrays ""Fred"" in the ""I Love Lucy"" series, William Frawley, is rather prominent in the film too.  As the foreman of the jury.",1269820800,2,635,4.616071428571429
704319,5,6303662560,"Roxie Hart has enough action, comedy, suspense and acting that I thoroughly enjoyed it! The casting was wonderful; look for Ginger Rogers as Roxie Hart and Adolph Menjou gives a terrific performance as Billy Flynn's Roxie's not so honest lawyer who has quite a reputation for getting people, especially ladies, off the hook in the courtroom. The script was very well written and William Wellman's direction leaves nothing to be desired.

When the action begins, we quickly meet Amos Hart (George Chandler), who is signing a confession that he murdered a burglar in his home. However, when a newspaper reporter and the cops find out it was really Roxie (Ginger Rogers) who killed the man--and that Roxie and the burglar were actually having an affair, things go into full swing. The reporter, Jake Callahan (Lynne Overman) and the burglar's now former business partner convince Roxie that instead of paying for her crime, if she can get Billy Flynn (Adolph Menjou) to be her lawyer she'll turn the whole thing around to make a profitable career for herself in show business.

Of course, the entire trial and the preparations for it become a circus in and of itself anyway. Star reporters like Mary Sunshine (Spring Byington) are itching to get Roxie's story for their papers and magazines; murder sells big time in Chicago! At the same time, a young reporter, Homer Howard (George Montgomery) becomes infatuated with Roxie and he wants to make her his own--but will Roxie be acquitted or found guilty and forced to pay the death penalty?  Moreover, how does Amos, Roxie's husband, take all this? No plot spoilers here--watch and find out! You won't be sorry--there are plenty of witty lines and more along the way.

Look also for fine performances by Phil Silvers as ""Babe,"" a big shot photographer for the press; and Sarah Allgood plays the prison matron, Mrs. Morton, very well. Morris Ankrum is very convincing as district attorney Martin S. Harrison and William Frawley plays O'Malley, a rich guy on the jury who becomes a bartender years later who remembers all this while Homer tells the flashback story to his bar patrons.

The DVD comes with two theatrical trailers that could use a little restoration and that's about it for the bonus features. I would have liked something more but the film is so good that this becomes a minor quibble.

Roxie Hart is a well done film and there are even some wonderful scenes with Ginger Rogers dancing! The acting is uniformly superb, too. I recommend this film for fans of the actors in it; and people who enjoy classic movies will want this for their collections.",1259712000,,2609,4.851685393258427

It is supposed to take place in 1927, but the clothing looks suspiciously 1940's. Even though I like Ginger Rodgers, I much prefer Renee Zelweger as Roxie, Rodger's character is almost annoying. Adoplh Menjou makes an interesting Billy Flynn, but can not beat Richard Gere by far.",1225756800,,532,4.670212765957447
704321,3,6303662560,"Loosely based on the 1924 trials of Chicago murderesses Beulah Annan and Belva Gaertner, as well as the exploits of notorious defense lawyers W.W. O'Brien and William Scott Steward, playwright Maurine Dallas Watkin's play CHICAGO was a popular stage success of 1926--a wickedly funny satire on fame and the American justice system.  It was also a popular silent film of 1927.  But when Hollywood returned to the story in 1942 the movies were under the infamous ""production code,"" and there was simply no way the story could be filmed as originally written.  The resulting film was a very loose adaptation in which the role of Velma Kelly was largely cut and Roxie Hart herself became less sinner than a fame-hungry dimwit who pleads guilty to a crime of which she is innocent in order to gain media fame.

ROXIE HART is one of those films that goes off with a bang when it works and dies with a fizzle when it doesn't.  The great success is the cast: both Ginger Rogers and Adophe Menjou are knock-outs in the leading roles of Roxie and her slick-and-slimy defense attorney Billy Flynn, and the supporting cast (which includes a host of famous faces, including Nigel Bruce, Phil Silvers, Sara Allgood, Spring Byington, William Frawley and Iris Adrian) is hard to beat.  The jail house scenes are a scream--yes, Ginger coaxes everybody into dancing ""The Black Bottom""--and the court room scenes even more so--with Ginger showing as much false emotion as she does leg.

On the other hand, the film uses a framing device in which a reporter (George Montgomery) tells the story of Roxy to a bar-room audience some twenty years after the fact, and it creaks, plods, thuds, brings the movie to a slow crawl, and then gives us a surprise ending that's not only completely unsurprising but which has the effect of undercutting the entire premise of the film.  When ROXIE HART flies, it really flies; when it falls, it does so with the thump of an over-cooked poundcake.

Even so, the film was still appealing enough to intrigue Broadway star Gwen Verdon, who was so fascinated by the general premise that she begged then-husband Bob Fosse to transform it into a stage showcase for her own talents.  Fosse agreed it would make a great musical, but he ran afoul of original author Watkins, who had had a change of heart about her play over the years and didn't want to see it resurrected.  When Watkins died in 1969 her estate felt differently, released the rights, and by 1975--with all its sin blackened humor restored--CHICAGO began to prove its worth on the musical stage.  An Academy-award winning film version aside, it is currently one of the most widely admired and widely performed musicals on the world stage.

Getting back to ROXIE HART--well, no, it ain't no CHICAGO.  But that awkward framing device aside, fans of the later musical will enjoy seeing this variation of their favorite musical, and certainly no one can argue with the calibre of the performances.  The DVD is not mint, but it is close, and it comes with two film trailers.  Recommended, as long as you don't expected too much.

Don't miss the jailhouse scene for a riotous rendition of ""Black Bottom"".  And if you ever wondered what exactly was meant my a ""circus"" in reference to a court room, ""Roxie Hart"" will give you a visual definition that is utterly jaw-dropping!",1208390400,2,350,4.596774193548387

704324,5,6303662560,This is a movie that has been buried and needs to come out again.  It is the non-musical edition of Chicago.  Ginger Rogers does an amazing job of Roxie.  Her gum chewing never misses a beat.  Truly a hoot.,1202601600,3,206,4.205128205128205

704326,5,6303662560,"william wellman's 'roxie hart' deserves mention because he was able to keep a breathless pace and stinging cynicism in this 1943 adaptation of mauirne watkins' 'chicago'.  this is no easy feat, considering 20th century fox felt the need to portray roxie as 100% innocent! and, the studio also had a character added in to the story to give contract player george montgomery a major break as rogers' romantic foil.

no matter--ginger rogers is a dizzy delight as roxie.  she dances up a storm in two great sequences, manages to wear the slightly meretricious costumes with style and tosses off her lines in a daffy, shrill voice that makes you love her.  she is matched scene for scene by adolphe menjou as slimy lawyer billy flynn, sara algood as tough matron momma morton and iris adrian as a scuzzy, unglamourous two gun gertie.

it's not 'chicago' okay?  but watch, enjoy and appreciate what it is because it's so much fun!",1189296000,5,925,4.786163522012578
704327,5,6303662560,"Ginger Rogers ability as a comedienne has NEVER been more apparent than in the cynical Willaim Welliam directed comedy ""Roxie Hart""!Based on real events in 1920's Chicago. Roxie (Ginger) is accused by the Cook County D.A. as having shot and killed a ""talent agent"" who was getting a little too friendly with Ginger. Naturally the Chicago press builds up the case due to the fact that Ginger is quite a ""dish"" who doesn't mind showing off her(GREAT)legs to the photo-happy press and the ALL MALE JURY,with William Frawley serving as foremen. Not only does Ginger thinks that these diversion will get her off,but that the publicity will help her budding show biz career! The story is told in flashbacks,from cica 1941, by newspaper reporter,George Montomgery(good-surprisingly!)who during the trail has fallen in love with Roxie!""Those were the good old days"",Montgomery tells bartender Frawley,as a crowd gathers in the saloon to drink, and think of those days and the beautiful Roxie. Other than Ginger the comedic anchor of the film is Adolphe Menjou,as not so honest attorney Billy Flynn. Menjou gives the comedic performance of his life,somewhat hammily,but right in character! Menjou and Ginger are ably assisted by Lynn Overmen,as an extremely cynical Chicago newspaper reporter (A GREAT COMEDY PERFORMANCE) Frawley,Spring Byington,Sara Allgood, Iris Adrian, Phil Silvers,Nigel Bruce,Pierre Watkins(as the D.A.),and as Ginger's sappy husband George Chandler. Oh,yes Ginger does a couple of dance numbers that are of immense,toe tapping, pleasure,with the added attraction that Ginger again puts her beautiful legs on display!  FIVE STARS!!!",1153526400,6,1645,5.5019762845849804
