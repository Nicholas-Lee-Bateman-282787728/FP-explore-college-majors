8134284,4,B000GRUQO2,"A very good DVD to jazz lovers, specially for drummers. An amazing big band, the Buddy Rich band, with so many of the best drummers that are stil in action. As a drummer and a jazz lover, I recommend.",1256428800,,200,4.153846153846154

8134286,3,B000GRUQO2,"First, compared to the old DCI vids, the video transfer looks a bit washed out like an old Honeymooners episode. Secondly, and probably most importantly, a lot of sound has been lost.  Perfect example, in Peart's solo, the high-hat and ride are completely muted. Overall, a very muffled sounding DVD.  Believe me, I've tried this DVD through several different entertainment systems with the same results.  So don't expect an enhanced sound. Quite the opposite. However, and finally, due to the convenience of DVD navagation, and of course some of the finest performances by some of the greatest drummers, I would still add this DVD to any music collection.",1215993600,3,656,5.055555555555555
8134287,5,B000GRUQO2,"I got this on tape back in 1990 or so, I was totally knocked out by the playing and introduced the the ""teachers"" that would be very influencial in the next years of my development as a drummer, Gregg Bissonette is great to watch as he really makes things swing along and always has a smile ready, Dennis chambers is ridiculous!
Steve Gadd shows us how to groove with a big band and Vinnie Colaiuta shows us why he is the player that can do it all. Watch for Steve Marcus on first Saxaphone enjoying Steve Gadds groove behind Steve as he's playing....
The sections of trio soloing with the 3 players from each line up playing together and trading off each other are great and there are some great clips of buddy along the way.",1215907200,,726,4.345588235294118

8134289,5,B000GRUQO2,"I attended this concert and as a lifelong friend of Louis Bellson's (he mentored my efforts as a young drummer over 40 years ago), I can honestly say that this was one of the great live drum concerts of all time...and I have had the VHS tapes for many years....The DVD set includes some bonuses. Any serious drummer should own this concert. You will be astounded at how Bellson more than holds his own, technically, and actually out swings all the other drummers, who were his junior by about 30 years at this time. And no surprise to experienced drummers, The Buddy Rich clips will confirm that he outplayed them all, right up until his final performances.",1200441600,8,657,4.6239316239316235
8134290,5,B000GRUQO2,"I had this originally on VHS, but over the years the tapes have disappeared. (mostly from borrowed but never returned scenarios)

This once in a lifetime event brought together the royalty of jazz/rock/fusion drummers to not only play with the Buddy Rich Big Band, but with each other.  The final drum trio of Steve Gadd, Dave Weckl, and Vinnie Coluita still stands as one of the finest drummmer ensembles ever. Gadd's generosity in letting the other two play out a bit more is one of the most amazing things ever, since both Weckl and Coluita pretty much exist because of him.  Any drummer from any genre should watch this and learn",1177286400,10,633,4.684684684684685

8134292,5,B000GRUQO2,"I have been waiting the dvd format for years and finally we got it....  yes for me is the best Drum festival , I mean, this event put together some of the best and more influential drummers of our time and made tribute to the legend  Buddy Rich.  No more to say just if you are a drummer no matter what level, or  musician or just a music fan get this dvd, learn and enjoy the art of drumming whith a great big band.",1173312000,5,416,3.9166666666666665
