George Hilton (of ""Blade of the Ripper,"" ""My Dear Killer"" and many other gialli too numerous to list here) is married to bitchy Claudia Gravy, who has the money in their relationship. I'm pretty sure he wants a divorce, but is afraid to because then he won't get any money, blah, blah, blah, etc.

He's haunted (throughout the film, and frequently) by flashbacks to his childhood and teenaged years involving his relationship with his younger sister (played by lovely, nubile Veronica Miriel, who spends most of the film nude or partially nude), with whom he has an explicitly sexual, incestuous relationship. These flashback sequences, set as they are in his cavernous (and now abandoned) family estate, are definitely reminiscent of those in Dario Argento's ""Deep Red"" (this is probably not an accident on the director's part).

Present day, he's (I think) some kind of fashion photographer, or an ad man - I'm not exactly sure which, or what exactly, but it gives him the opportunity to take pictures of and film new model Rossy Mendoza who un-freaking-believably smoking HOT - I'm talking BIG, natural, firm breasts, meaty...hind portions...whew...okay, this is starting to sound piggier than I intended, but take it from me, if you like your women Russ Meyer-esque, you will love Rossy. (And yes, she does do nudity in this film - thank you!)

Anyway, to say anymore would be to give away too much of the plot, although I will add that Andres Garcia's role is that of the lead guy's best buddy, although I was a little confused as to the nature of his purpose plot-wise beyond that. I guess I need to go brush up on my Espanol...",1299110400,,1876,4.675757575757576
