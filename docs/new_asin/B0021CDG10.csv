8348935,2,B0021CDG10,"i ordered this thinking it was a kids lunch box. i didn't realize it came with 2 shark horror dvds that my 7 year old can not watch. i don't like how the buckle at the top is so small. however, we are going to keep and use as a lunch box because i don't want to return it.",1362787200,,272,3.6271186440677967
8348936,3,B0021CDG10,"I ordered this for the lunch box as my son is obsessed with sharks. The metal box has a great look to it however, it is smaller than a standard lunch box. It is also slightly bent/dented on one side",1351641600,,198,3.975

8348938,4,B0021CDG10,"I ordered two different lunch boxes in the same visit to Amazon.  This one took about a week longer to receive and is dented on an outside corner.  It is a metal lunch box and overall a nice product.  There were two DVD's inside that were both factory sealed in shrink wrap.  One is rated ""R"" and the other ""PG-13"".  I assume they're perfect, but inappropriate for the 8 year old shark-lover that I bought the lunch box for.",1285977600,3,424,4.3164556962025316
