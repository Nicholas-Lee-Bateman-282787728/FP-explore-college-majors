This DVD brings back to life his story of his music which was the first real fusion jazz ever produced. The award winning film takes the viewpoint that Ellis was and still is truely one of the Finest Musical Artists of the 20th Century. This DVD and the only Documentary made about Don Ellis is a must for fans of Jazz, Rock and everything in-between. CSPS-Media",1397174400,5,475,4.409090909090909
8643210,5,B00IKXQU8U,"It was 1970 or 1971 when I stumbled onto KQED-TV's feature on Don Ellis and his orchestra performing his New Horizons at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. This was broadcast on our local affiliate of West Virginia public television and I had somehow missed  the credits. Had no idea what I just seen or heard. But it grabbed me at that first hearing and I'd spend the next forty-five years trying to find out what it was. Google and PBS's web site to the rescue! The DVD starts with a series of interviews from those who knew Ellis and admired both his adventurous aesthetic and his personality. Some good music interspersed here in brief clips filmed live at jazz festivals from the late 1960s. Also included are some trailers for additional documentaries on such artists as Joe Zawinul. I haven't explored those yet.

But it was the DVD ""Bonus"" feature that made this purchase worth the price for me. There in all their monaural glory were Ellis and his orchestra performing tracks from his ""Electric Bath"" album, starting with the remarkable 17/4 (or 17/8?) ""New Horizons."" This was what had so affected me forty-five years ago.

The video quality is about what you'd expect from tapes that are almost a half-century old. We're fortunate that some few of them have survived and remained (mostly) playable. The audio is monaural and the museum acoustics must have been pretty ""live."" Add to that the fact that Ellis had nearly his entire ensemble miked with each section outfitted with multiple amps and speakers. The balance is not always ideal and the percussion instruments sometimes overwhelm the rest of the orchestra. And there a few dropouts here and there. But this is a minor quibble. The music sounds pretty darn good considering the venue and the age of the tapes, the orchestra plays with palpable energy, and Ellis's mastery of his instrument and those ""alien"" time signatures (think northern Africa, the Indian Subcontinent, the peasant dances of the Balkans) is without equal. If you're like me and groove to the rhythms of Bartok's more energetic music, there's nothing in Ellis that you'll find off-putting. On the more reflective side, the ascending stacked fifths in ""Open Beauty"" are reminiscent of the haunting string chorale that opens the second movement of Bartok's second piano concerto. And the musicians seem able to swing in just about any meter, be it 17, 7 ... whatever. I'd recommend this to anyone who is curious about Ellis and his experiments with world music and who wonders, as I do, why his name is so-little recognized.

But please don't hold the outfits he and his musicians wear against us baby-boomers. It was the Sixties, after all. Yahadta be there.",1486252800,4,2700,4.863043478260869
8643211,3,B00IKXQU8U,"Disappointing.  I've been a big fan for most of my life, and I was eager to play this for my wife, to give her a better sense of the enormous genius inside the man and his music. This video--a loose collection of video scraps haphazardly arranged--didn't do it..  To be fair, I only watched it once and even then I turned it off w/o finishing it.  Want to know more about Don?  Go to Youtube.  There's an amazing amount of material--live concerts, recordings, etc.  Search ""Don Ellis new horizons"" and see a video of the orchestra recording session.

8643214,5,B00IKXQU8U,"The main documentary has interviews with some of Ellis's bandmates and Maynard Ferguson. It's mostly about Ellis' music career with not too much personal bio included. Not the best video quality on some of the rare clips from TV broadcasts and all that but the sound quality of the music is quite good. The real treat here is in the extra features, a performance of the best 1960's Ellis band at its absolute peak recorded in a San Francisco museum. This concert is mind-blowing. One of the most incredibly virtuosic bands you will ever hear. This concert alone is worth the price of admission many times over. It's no wonder that some of Ellis' musicians such as Ralph Humphrey later went on to play with Zappa.",1428278400,2,712,4.658730158730159

8643219,5,B00IKXQU8U,"I only knew Jazz trumpeter Don Ellis from his one hit Lp Don Ellis Band Goes Underground  back in 1969. And, honestly, I forgot all about it until I received this new DVD documentary on Ellis for review.  In 2007 documentary film director John Vizzusi decided the time had come to give Ellis his due and this 71-minute film is the result. Vizzusi interviews many of the original members of the Ellis band as well as using archival footage from an interview with band leader  Maynard Ferguson (who  died in 2006). Ellis was a member of trumpeter Fergusons band before heading out on his own to expand the definition of jazz. (There is also some archival audio from Stan Kenton).  Elliss electric  band played jazz, but it was infused with classical and rock moments. They often played with rock bands on the bill at the Fillmore West. In 1972 Ellis composed the score for the hit film The French Connection (and won a Grammy for the soundtrack album). He followed up with more film scores including The Seven-Ups and Kansas City Bomber.

There are moments from an archival video interview with Ells (who died in 1978 in Los Angeles at the young age of 44) held at Alfred University in 1978.  And there are other brief moments from a public TV show (undated) produced by KQED-San Francisco titled Music Art San Francisco where Ellis and his band perform music among the art in an art museum.

The DVD provides a real nice bonus. The complete Music Art San Francisco film (running time is 57 minutes).

The  DVD release comes from the German Arthaus Musik label, distributed in the US by Naxos.  There is a 16-page booklet with photos, a 2-page intro by the Director and a four page essay on the musician, which is repeated in German.

Footage of Ellis and the band come from the UCLA Ethnology Dept and were restored the best they could be but the images are not always sharp. So don't expect HD quality. But, after all, its all about the music and its time Ellis got his due.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
