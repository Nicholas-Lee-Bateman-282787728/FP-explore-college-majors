Whether you're just behind in purchasing - or if you're like me and weren't impressed with the Fire, Pure, Rise specials and want to opt out on those - this is a cost-efficient way to collect series one - six of Skins. All three generations are presented in this set, presented as they were originally cut for British television.

While you can purchase series 1-4 separately (and on Amazon) in the traditional US and Canada Region 1 NTSC format, this particular set is presented in Region 2 PAL, and will not play on most standard DVD plays but they will most likely play in a computer with proper settings. However, my recommendation is to get a multi-region DVD player; a simple investment with a lot of return for anyone watching series that originate overseas that may or may not end up stateside.",1387584000,,882,4.653846153846154

Then when I gave it a bad review,  Amazon would not post it because I said one curse word( meaning your bottom). How unfair is that?  As long as I've been a customer to Amazon.. They still let 3 party people sell things over their website that's incompatible in The U.S.  How Cool Is That?...l........?

These people will procrastinate to give you your money back!!!!
