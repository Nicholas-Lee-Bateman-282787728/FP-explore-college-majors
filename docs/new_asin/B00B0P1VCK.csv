It wasn't the worst thing I've seen but glad I didn't find him that funny in this concept. The annoying blurriness from the logo is here too. I hope Prime gives us better classic TV shows. They can give us all the Carol they want though! Hint hint!",1507852800,,417,4.160493827160494
8560385,4,B00B0P1VCK,"Wow! I couldn't believe the listing of this DVD when I first saw this on Amazon. Stanley was a live sitcom that debuted in September, 1956 and ran for 19 episodes and never was seen again. Classic TV fans just thought the kinescopes all went to Live TV Heaven and were lost forever. Now, out of the blue, comes this amazing DVD release which must have come from the Hackett family vaults or the holdings of Max Liebman, the producer.

I have received this DVD and have watched Disc 1. (7 episodes).

Here's the good news:

The episodes look great! They are bright and clear visually and the sound is outstanding.  They are uncut and have the original commercials.  The extras are a nice bonus. The packaging is very good and the whole thing has been done in a very professional manner. (And the show itself is pretty funny. If you are a fan of Buddy Hackett and/or Carol Burnett, this is a must buy for you).

It's almost like going back in a time machine to 1956. Note I said almost.

Now for the bad news:

The producers of this DVD have done something very bad. They decided it was a necessity to have a logo superimposed on the screen in the lower left corner during every second of every show. The logo is a cute caricature of Hackett as Stanley done originally by the legendary Al Hirshfeld. It's cute when you see it on the inside of the DVD cover but it's not so cute when you see it all the time when you are trying to concentrate on the show. It is very annoying.  I know why they did this. It's a weak attempt to try to stop bootleggers from copying the show. How many bootleggers would want to copy this show? Does the DVD of ""Gone With the Wind"" have a logo on the screen?  Did you see one when you last watched your ""Godfather"" DVD?  The whole experience of watching a show like that is to take you back to the original era of it's showing. They did not have logos on the screen in 1956. I know that most TV and cable networks have logos all the time in 2013.  But this horrible concept has rarely entered the DVD world.

Oh well, nobody said life is perfect.  This DVD is almost perfect. I still am very happy that it is now available despite the major flaw.",1364515200,6,2173,4.242718446601942
