However I enjoyed watching ""Flicka"" on German TV when I was young.

I also enjoyed ""Checkmate"", although I liked ""Honey West"" and ""Bourbon Street"" even more. Then there was ""M Squad"" which was almost as good as ""The Detectives"" (Robert Taylor) and I never missed an episode. At school everybody talked about ""M Squad"" and ""The Detectives"" on the next day. I think there is a large Baby Boomer potential for selling/releasing more of these classic TV series.

Many of those who loved the ""Lassie"", ""Flipper"", ""Fury"", ""Flicka"" and ""Gentle Ben"" TV series in their childhood also liked ""Kentucky Jones"" (Dennis Weaver) and ""The Farmer's Daughter"" (Inger Stevens). I wish these two wonderful old TV series and many others like ""A Man called Shenandoah"" (Robert Horton), ""Hank"" (Dick Kallman), ""He and She"" (Paula Prentiss), ""The Magic Boomerang"", ""The Greatest Show on Earth"" (Jack Palance) would finally be released on DVD.",1323820800,2,953,5.141935483870967

4934132,3,B0062ZIPF4,I have fond memories of this show from my childhood. Some episodes look great but many have not been well-preserved.,1479513600,,116,4.85
4934133,5,B0062ZIPF4,It is truly amazing that a show  from the fifties could today be so relevant with values and morals.,1478995200,,100,4.2631578947368425
4934134,5,B0062ZIPF4,"As a kid, I remember watching My Friend Flicka on Saturdays along with Fury, Rin-Tin-Tin, Lassie and other series geared for younger audiences. Watching these Flicka episodes many years later, I was pleasantly surprised at how well the stories held up.

The series has a strong cast with Gene Evans and Anita Louise as parents and ranch owners, along with their son Johnny Washbrook and the star of the show, the chesnut sorrel Flicka.

Each episode is fast paced and, for the most part, exciting. The film location of the nearby town is Gene Autry's Melody Ranch which was used in many Western movies and TV series such as Gunsmoke and Tombstone Territory.  Melody Ranch burned to the ground in 1962, so it is great to actually see ""Dodge City"" in color when My Friend Flicka was filmed in 1955.

And speaking of color, the opening credits of My Friend Flicka are sharp and in beautiful color. However, the episodes themselves appear to be in a more muted process known as Tru-Color, a two strip color process used by Republic Pictures with some of its B-Westerns from the late 1940's and 1950's. At least these episodes appear to be in Tru-Color whether they are or not.

The picture quality is a little soft, but the sound is steady and strong.  The episodes are very watchable, so don't let ""picture quality"" stop you from buying this very affordable and fun series.

This family friendly television series helped fulfill every Fifties boy and girl's fantasy of living on a ranch in California and owning a beautiful horse named Flicka.  So saddle up and have a lot of fun with all 39 episodes of this nearly-forgotten series from the Golden Age of Television.",1476576000,7,1664,4.713793103448276
4934135,3,B0062ZIPF4,"I purchased a copy of this DVD on other than Amazon. I found the quality mediocre not much, if any, better than the privately produced DVD set I have (and others I have seen) with the exception of episode 30 (hence my rating of only a 3 here), Refuge for the Night, which is in color and pristine (most likely from one of Fox's masters as it has the 20th Century Fox, A Newscorp Company, logo at the very end of the credits).

Episode 17, Night Rider, is also pristine and from Fox's master as it too displays the 20th Century Fox, A Newscorp Company logo at the end. Shout Factory apparently edited the opening of every episode by adding a pristine copy of the series opening to each but the quality of the actual episode and end credits varies greatly.

I contacted Shout Factory and inquired about the mediocre, varying quality of the episodes as well as the aspect ratio being off and very poor quality of episode 20, The Whip. I was told that the best masters available from Fox were used for the DVD set. I highly doubt this, my opinion is that Shout Factory used public domain copies of the episodes and only paid Fox for a couple masters.

On the plus side the DVD set has been professionally compiled and edited. It comes on 5 discs versus the 10 discs of the privately produced DVD sets and the price is reasonable at about $15.

When I can find the time, amidst my daily equine chores, I plan on comparing what I had before with the Shout Factory DVD set and will provide an in-depth review.

Hope this information helps...",1475884800,,1534,4.387323943661972

4934137,4,B0062ZIPF4,"Nice to see this nostalgic show on DVD..
..not seen since the 70s. Filmed in 1955-56 in color mostly at Fox ranch in Calabasas/Malibu hills...the video quality is watchable at best and obviously from some dupey video sources. Oddly, the opening titles are clear and sharp from more original source material. Overall, a nice, heartwarming show....it is what it is!",1472601600,5,363,5.066666666666666
4934138,4,B0062ZIPF4,"Currently available in Canada at HMV, My Friend Flicka , holds the distinction of having been the first television series filmed by 20th Century Fox, originally broadcast in 1956-57, is a frontier drama about Ken McLaughlin, the main character of My Friend Flicka, and his best friend Flicka, played by child actor Johnny Washbrook. I always wanted to watch a series that had had a lead character with the same first name is mine. It was a mid-season replacement for Gene Autry's The Adventures of Champion. Both series, however failed in the ratings against ABC's The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin.
There are 39 Full Color episodes, filled with danger , thrills and life on the range in this classic western series. In fact My Friend Flicka was the very first regularly-scheduled color television show!
The sets and costumes were a bit more lavish than most series of that time, and the number and quality of actors were definitely far above average.  Well-known name actors like Hugh Beaumont, Claude Akins, Sheb Wooley, Minerva Urecal, Mike Mazurki, Denver Pyle, and even screen legends John Carradine and Jane Darwell, appeared in episodes in the series.
Theres even an official comprehensive website dedicated to this series and you can catch some of the episodes on YouTube.
As for the video quality of this set, I would say its just OK, say 6 out of 10, unlike other recent SHOUT releases like The Loner and Custer, which are much clearer. However, this is a charming series, If you liked Fury, The Adventures Of Champion, Lassie or The Adventures Of Rin Tin Tin, this is great nostalgic viewing.",1472083200,13,1599,4.857142857142857

4934156,4,B0062ZIPF4,"When I was 10, MY FRIEND FLICKA was my favorite show on TV. I always wanted to be Ken and live on that ranch in Wyoming and ride horses and have all those adventures.  Since all my family had was a b&w TV I didn't know these TV episodes were in color until I bought this DVD collection.  Over the years I had bought 16mm prints and a VHS tape of episodes, but never expected to find my favorite show on DVD, although I looked and looked.  Finally, I spotted this DVD set on amazon.com and snapped it up.  I think it may be the last DVD set available.  The DVD presents 30+ episodes from the show, almost all there were I think. Considering how old this show is, and that the DVD was created from 16mm color prints, the quality is very, very good. Depending on the episode, it goes from very good to excellent. You can watch a single show or run the whole series one after another. Although there are no commercials, each episode dose have full credits. For anyone who remembers and enjoyed ""My Friend Flicka"" this is a great buy.  The seller was excellent. He delivered a mint condition, unopened DVD, in record time.  Good hunting.",1349136000,13,1132,4.3364928909952605
4934157,5,B0062ZIPF4,Nothing warms my heart and soul like a 'love story'.  My Friend Flicka is most definitely a love story.  My hope is that this series inspires a deeper appreciation and respect regarding the human/equine bond in the younger and future generations as it did in me.  There is a Facebook page and web site that provides excellent resource information on this TV Series (just do a web search).  Hopefully there will be another release with all 39 episodes in the not too distant future.,1326931200,12,481,4.690476190476191
