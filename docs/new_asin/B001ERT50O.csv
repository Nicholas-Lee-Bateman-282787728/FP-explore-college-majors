8299407,1,B001ERT50O,"While watching the movie, it was painful at times to continue watching.  There was a good deal of overacting, and drama where none needed to be.  The whole point of the movie was to convey the anguish and pain of the main character, Anna, who was molested as a child, and then taken advantage of by her sister's lover/fiance, Eric (played by Firth).  There was very little conveyed of her childhood trauma, and the incident with Eric was dissociated at times, and not well conveyed in the film.",1241049600,,494,4.590909090909091
