4178983,4,B003R4ZMQI,"Of all USA's shows I currently watch (Burn Notice, Royal Pains, Covert Affairs), Covert Affairs is probably my favorite. While Burn Notice is still fun, it just seems to be a rehash every season of the same story with different people, much like Heroes ended up doing. Covert Affairs stars Piper Perabo as a shoe-in CIA Agent - or so she thinks. Her entry into Langley as a field agent is suspect from the beginning of the season as her one-time love interest, Ben Mercer, keeps popping up (in more ways than one) to haunt her. Is she there because of her talent? That's up for you to decide. Annie's sidekick, August ""Auggie"" Anderson, is a blind, tech savvy, ex-soldier who makes a great partner for Annie and can seemingly get more women than Brad Pitt. Annie's superiors, constantly feuding husband and wife duo Joan and Arthur Campbell, make for an interesting side story in each episode with Joan being Annie's direct boss and head of the DPD and Arthur being Joan's boss and Director of Clandestine Services (DCS). Another recognizable face is that of Sendhil Ramamurthy, a.k.a. Mohinder Suresh from Heroes.

I don't want to say Covert Affairs is unique however it does give us, what I would consider, a good look into the methods of the CIA. Annie is constantly being chosen for dangerous field ops and always gets into tight situations where she, very MacGuyver like, always manages to find a way out. One thing that bothers me about this show and it is an issue with all three above mentioned USA shows is that you can predict that: a). with Royal Pains, Hank always seems to be around when someone's health is hitting the fan b). in Burn Notice, Michael is supposed to be incognito yet word gets around and people always seem to know what he does, where he lives, and how to reach him and c). with Covert Affairs it seems like in every episode, Joan tells Annie, ""Don't do this without my approval"" and she does it anyways. Joan will tell Arthur, who has just chosen Annie for the umpteenth time to do a dangerous op, ""I will not put Annie in danger again"" yet next episode, like clockwork, we're in a pickle again. I realize this nitpicky but this is why I gave it a 4 instead of a 5. Someone above mentioned ""This will never be Lost or 24 caliber."" To you I say it is USA. This is as good as it is going to get on a network that sells its shows as character driven and that's what Covert Affairs is.",1284595200,67,2412,4.457013574660634
4178984,1,B003R4ZMQI,"I was very disappointed by the quality of acting in this series.  That said, I really enjoy being able to download an episode or two through video on demand and try out the series. Whew, saved me buying a series which I did not enjoy.",1284422400,4,234,4.2
4178985,4,B003R4ZMQI,"First, what type of looks does the CIA like its people to have?  Stunningly beautiful?  Super ugly?  No.  Those kinds of people draw attention.  The CIA likes people who blend in with a crowd, who people look right past without noticing them.  So why is everyone on this show good looking?  I know, it's not supposed to be realistic, it's TV.

Second, our lead gal got selected for her language skills and didn't even finish her initial training.  She has no fighting skills and is always being thrown around by her opponents.  Yet she almost always wins her fights against better trained, bigger, stronger opponents.  Again, not realistic, just TV.

That being said, I love this series.  It's fresh and fun.  The leading lady, Piper Perabo as Annie Walker, is very likeable and sympathetic.  But the real star of the show is Christopher Gorham as Auggie Anderson.  He is believable, likeable, and the viewer instantly feels a connection with him.  These two are the show, but ""Auggie"" is the best. Watching the chemistry between the two of them and watching Auggie work his magic is worth the price of admission, regardless of the storyline.

So, not realistic, but fun, and well worth watching.",1282521600,,1196,4.807881773399015
4178986,5,B003R4ZMQI,Very unique. A highly intelligent blind man is the assistant to a female covert operative who very good at improvising in tight situations. When this series is available on DVD I highly recommend it.,1282348800,27,199,4.882352941176471

4178993,2,B003R4ZMQI,"The pilot held my interest for 15-20 minutes. The blonde female ""agents"" bear no resemblance to their real-life counterparts. Over-the-top sexualized. The main character is way too cute to be believable. Clearly they're more suited for a stroll down the Red Carpet than this series.",1515369600,,282,5.288888888888889

4178995,3,B003R4ZMQI,"The 2 seasons are mildly entertaining. If you're looking for realistically staged espionage, this isn't it. There's eye candy galore and you have to accept that female CIA field operatives wearing 4 inch heels can outrun the average terrorist and that in the office they all wear skin-tight sheath dresses (designer, of course) and can afford all that & the swankiest addresses in the nation's capital on a government salary. But in all fairness, the plot lines improve tremendously in seasons 3 & 4 and Piper Perabo seems less one dimensional. Maybe she's a better actress than the first 2 seasons would suggest. Perhaps she just needed better material. None of the actors are terrible, but none are stellar, either. With the exception of the actor who plays Henry Wilcox, the arch villain of the series, who burns up the screen with his treachery, menace, and all around evil. He doesn't go as hammy as Spader in Blacklist. He never crosses the line into camp, but goes right up to the edge to wonderful effect. He's a joy to watch.",1514419200,8,1034,4.75
4178996,1,B003R4ZMQI,"Halfway through the first episode, it was clear that the character doesn't speak a lick of any of the ""six languages"" she is apparently fluent in. The actress could have done so much better than ""zdrast-voo-tee"" for ""Hello"" in Russian (listen to any YouTube video or Google Translate to hear how """" should sound). And her life spent backpacking around the world and ""helping refugees in Somalia"" just made her look like a rich white savior. She looks good in a skirt, but she is very unlikable.",1513814400,,494,4.689655172413793
4178997,3,B003R4ZMQI,"I found the first few episodes mildly entertaining but couldn't get beyond my annoyance at the usual stereotype:  female heroines must be blonde and a size 0; also,it's important to be a slut.  I think the times are overdue for realistic female heroines that are ""normal"" appearing, maybe even a size 8 (gasp!) and with brown hair.  I think we can handle it.",1513641600,,358,4.650793650793651

4179001,1,B003R4ZMQI,"Not a critic and rarely take the time to review but this show is so blazingly awful, I had to comment. You know the lead is about to do or say something as it will be preceded by a hair toss.",1512518400,,191,3.682926829268293
4179002,1,B003R4ZMQI,"I consider myself a patriotic american, but watching this show makes me think, ""Come on ISIS! You can do it!""

I don't know how I missed this show during its original run. I'd never heard of it before until discovering it on Prime Video a couple of nights ago. I get the premise, the CIA gets the ol' USA Network ""light hearted"" treatment. But the amount of on her knees, hands behind the back brown nosing to authority our heroine does here is just a bit revolting. The CIA is not only Daddy, but Mommy too!

The press are evil. Secrets kept from us dumb sheep (the american people) are good things. Being one of the young, hip, above the law, super-alpha insiders of the CIA is something to aspire to!

Most of this era of USA shows struck me as workplace fantasies for millennials which mined similar territory. Your boss cares about you! (He doesn't). Work is fulfilling because you get to wear great clothes! (it isn't, you don't). By being part of the corporate world makes you a 1 percenter! (hahahaha).

Lets face it, white collar work is dying behind a desk, but yeah its TV fantasy. Still this particular TV fantasy has a few too many sour authoritarian notes to it. My god whatever happened to the American spirit of pragmatic patriotism, and respect for authority tempered with a good dose of skepticism? It's nowhere on offer in Covert Affairs. The world it presents to viewers is that if you get good grades, work out enough, and you're hot, you get to be a master of the universe too! After a rookie year of suitably light hearted hazing by people who secretly love you, you join their higher class of people who are above the law.

If this is something you even fantasize about, there's a crucial piece missing in your character.",1511913600,,1745,4.526984126984127

Ridiculous people prancing through a comic book. Apparently people have no idea what the CIA ostensibly does, let alone its covert activities.

This first season follows the exploits of Annie Walker, an intrepid young CIA operative, who demonstrates intelligence and wisdom beyond her years, in her pursuit of the successful completion of her designated missions. ""Covert Affairs"" features superb writing, acting, and plot development, and the performances of the lead actors, Piper Perabo and Christopher Gorham, are truly exceptional.

She is glib and one dimensional and fails to be of interest because most of the other cast members are more complex personalities and are well drawn.

Definitely keeps your interest and the filming actually takes place in the cities all over the world depicted as I've been to many of these cities and recognized many of the land marks as they drive around the cities. As this series is about spies it is always hard to distinguish the good guys from the bad guys. I watched all 11 episodes and plan to start watching the other seasons.

Simple gooey bang bang shoot-em-up with pretty people and frequent stretches on believablity, Like, in S2E8, someone just happened to leave two 300' ropes and two climbing harnesses on the roof? And such sweet, loving, caring, affectionate CIA persons. Still, to my embarrassment, I keep getting sucked in. It reminds me of watching the A Team while in bed with a girlfriend.

4179367,5,B003R4ZMQI,This is a multi-faceted drama which moves at a very fast clip but develops characters and relationships and dramatic conflicts/tensions well and realistically.  This is a very enjoyable series.  I strongly recommend it.  The only thing I don't particularly care for is the title.  It implies too much and gives it a racy flavor that is not borne out by the stories themselves -- thankfully so.,1484438400,,393,4.909090909090909

4179375,2,B003R4ZMQI,C rated...the leed girl is nice to look at and is good in her role. The rest is formulated unsubtle and clearly trying to copy an older show with Jennifer Garner. Even the leed girl looks just like she is her younger sister. Only the show falls short. Really only the girl props it up for me. Her boss and her husband are poorly cast or the direction is amiss. Something let's this show sag.....,1484438400,,395,4.28

(Such shows have their uses, believe me)  And besides, each episode is the title of a Led Zeppelin song. And not just the obvious ones, either. I'd be Trampled Underfoot if I didn't say that counts for something. Happily, there's a secondary character on this show that's more compelling than ""the girl,"" and the writers were smart enough to give him a lot to do.

4180049,2,B003R4ZMQI,For me it seems that the format for the show has been well used.  In the first episode there's a scene where two fairly high-level CIA operatives have a marital spat in a restaurant. That's when I turned the episode off. Probably won't be going back to see anymore of this program.,1475193600,,281,4.403846153846154
4180050,5,B003R4ZMQI,"Excellent series about a tough, smart but always over her head new CIA Operative fresh off the farm.

Piper Perabo I liked in Coyote Ugly and think she was perfectly cast for the part of ""Annie"" which is a spunky gal who still is feminine but does not hesitate to fight it out.  First time I have seen a character portrayed whose unexpected strength is foreign language skills--interesting story lines and lots of action.

I guess our lizard brains like this stuff, but I'm getting a little tired of it.  That said, I still have watched the show every night since I discovered it and am in season three now.

4180092,3,B003R4ZMQI,"This was a fun diversion show at first but when I realized they wrote out the romantic CIA operative boyfriend, Ben, I lost interest. As it usually goes with these things the writing goes down the tubes after the first or second season. People hold on hoping it will get better again but it rarely does. Since I started watching this after the program ended I cheated and skipped ahead to see if things improved only to find truly silly and repetitive story lines. Too bad but when I watch TV I do it for enjoyment....not frustration.
The CIA by law is a foreign operations agency and cannot operate inside the United States. I guess it's too expensive for TV studios to shoot in foreign lands but they could at least try to get decent writers and producers.",1474675200,,758,4.5

Annie didn't even get a gun until later in the series!  They tried out several love interests but that didn't make the show run.  It was the people at CIA and Annie that made the show run.  It was Augie as her handler.  Joan as her friend and mentor.  Joan's husband Arthur and foreign spy Eyal Levine are part time ""community"" members helping her.  These are the people you root for and watch for.  Every episode is worth seeing.  The pilot sets the mood showing what Annie and the show are all about.

Somehow petite Ms. Perabo manages to completely pull off being a really good, and when necessary kick-ass, CIA agent. Add in some great locales, good supporting cast and interesting story lines, and this becomes a very enjoyable and entertaining show to watch. The show also does a good job of showing some of the costs involved in being a spook, between changing the life of people sometimes only peripherally connected to a CIA target, and showing 'Annie' dealing with having to lie to her family to hide what she really does for a living.",1472860800,2,632,4.552631578947368

4180267,3,B003R4ZMQI,I liked it but the episode with Iranian guy trying to get asylum in the U.S. and he had some sensitive documents to pass to CIA was laughable.

4180383,2,B003R4ZMQI,"If the point is to humanize the CIA and make it appealing as a career to 12 - 15 year old young people with language skills, this might work.
But I'm dubious about the last part. If this is really meant to recruit future CIA personnel, we'll be in trouble if it works as it's pretty juvenile.
Ah--but maybe it's some Ruskie trick! They want to flood the Agency with less than serious potential employees, thus eroding overall effectiveness.
Or wait, maybe it's REALLY a trick to make the CIA seem that way while it secretly maintains its razor sharp edge and...well, whatever.
This is a show that portrays a powerful government espionage agency as a sort of cool, hip, challenging workplace, with a few action sequences thrown in for those actually looking for something edgier. If I actually knew anything about the vampire series 'Twilight' I'd guess that Twilight fans will be at home here.",1470182400,,893,4.730769230769231

4180596,2,B003R4ZMQI,"I watched the first two episodes and couldn't get past how ditzy and needy this woman was.  I was hoping for James Bond but with a woman.  Perhaps, she grows into the character I wanted to see, but I really really struggled taking Piper's role as Annie Walker seriously.  I actually felt her role and that of all the women in the show seemed very demeaning.  Annie's first mission in the CIA is to pretend to be a prostitute, hmmm?  All the guys at the CIA are constantly ogling her, borderline harassing her if it weren't for the fact that she allows harassment to continue and rolls with the flirtation game...I'm sure the feminists are thrilled with this.  She clings to every man with more experience (which is literally everyone since she is the rookie) and begs them for help because she is apparently incapable of figuring anything out on her own (some great CIA training).  She doesn't have any confidence despite supposedly being at the top of her class.  Unbeknownst to her, she only in fact got recruited into the CIA because of her connection with a former boyfriend, because all good women needed a man to get them in at some point, right?  Then, she gets her ass kicked in her first two fights before being saved by a man in each instance.  After two beat-downs she has a blind CIA agent (his character is literally blind, though I think he's more like Daredevil each time I see him, with the attuned senses) teach her how to fight because the CIA hand to hand combat training is supposedly useless (?!?) and being taught by a blind veteran who's a lady's man is much better.

Again for the feminists to chew on, there's some sort of side story going on with Annie's boss, involving her paranoia that her husband is cheating on her.  She uses CIA assets to stalk him, and is is of course proven wrong.  He's completely innocent and she is just a crazy, jealous, needy woman???  Mind you, there is NO backstory to help me understand why she suspects her husband of cheating, apparently this is just what women do anytime a man logs phone calls with a woman.  WTF

On the personal life side we find another strong female character.  Annie's sister is not allowed to know she is in the CIA and this is the whole reason why the two of them seem to have a complicated relationship, not because of any real backstory drama between the two.  The sister is completely bi-polar too...the 13 year old version of it.  She is super whiny in one scene blaming Annie for everything and then all apologies with no explanation for the change in heart during the next scene.  I really can't handle the change in character without explanation from one scene to the next.  Let's develop the sister so that I understand what the heck is going on with this stuff, otherwise, I'm just annoyed by her childishness.  Two episodes, ready to move on to something I can take seriously.

I'm actually giving this two stars for desired potential if we just had some writers from the 21st century who could develop a female character before shoving her in a skirt and throwing her on screen because she's hot and there are CIA action scenes.  There are in fact elements to build upon within the plot, Piper seems like an actress with potential and she's certainly enjoyable eye candy for those of us that are interested.  The story seems like it could become intriguing.  Unfortunately for me, with the inexplicable portrayal of the female characters, it's not enough to throw an attractive body at the problem and call it solved, but what do I know, this thing was on TV for five seasons.  Personally, I'd at least need a reboot of the main character to be willing to accept more at this point.  I value my time too much to sacrifice further.  Someone else can fill me in on what episode I need to jump to to find a woman with a backbone, otherwise, this will stay in the dustbin of streaming video.",1466380800,5,3884,4.5243553008595985

4180649,5,B003R4ZMQI,"If you haven't watched Covert Affairs yet, you're in for a treat. This series has a perfect balance of edge-of-your-seat, nail-biting adventure, exotic escapism and a little romance, with outstanding writing and acting from the regular and supporting cast.
The first season starts off a little slow. Like the main character Ann Catherine Walker, a new CIA operative who's just starting out and finding her way, the show muddles along a bit to find its way in season 1. But stay with it - things heat up later on, but the first season provides the background you need to appreciate the rest.
Ladies - if you've been avoiding tis series because the main character's an attractive woman who wears heels, give it a chance. This is not a lame T&A romp - the main character and supporting female roles are strong, empowered women, not lightweights who constantly need to be rescued by a man.

4180656,4,B003R4ZMQI,"This series is so watchable it's embarrassing.  It's a cross between a great spy thriller series and a cheesy soap.  The spy story lines are UNBELIEVABLE-  by which I mean COMPLETELY BELIEVABLE:  nuanced, detailed, plausible and exciting.  The cast is pure cheese, very very attractive serviceable actors who fit the bill.  The locations are flabbergasting, fights, explosions, all FX are FIRST RATE, more than you could reasonably expect.  Think of Olivia Pope (great outfits, shoes) with blonde hair, a gun and martial arts skills... although this series is more sophisticated in terms of global espionage than Scandal is in terms of Washington politics.",1465257600,,656,5.310679611650485

I feel that the good taste shown in both the language and the restraint shown in depicting sexual relationships help me to like this program and to continue watching.  My wife and I are binge watchers and this is one of the best series for this that we have seen.

I think the writing is the strongest of any action series I have watched.  The action scenes are very realistic and overall are pretty believable, if you can believe that a small woman can do all that.  Piper certainly sells this.

Plotting is very good with very few holes and the cast makes the plots better.  So far, the writing hasn't asked me to believe that anyone in the cast is something they are not, as Alias did.",1461801600,2,767,4.474820143884892

I'm sure I will watch more but because there was a sameness to the 2nd and 3rd episodes I was able to take a break.  My suggestion is to provide more depth to the primary character .  We all know now that she can win most fights with large men.  So?  Good!  I don't want her to get badly hurt (which she seldom does) but if I'm to continue watching I need to see more character development and more depth in the story line.

4181354,5,B003R4ZMQI,"An excellent spy-thriller series that is reminiscent of the show ""Alias"" starring Jennifer Garner. In fact, in an uncanny, possible inadvertent nod to ""Alias"", the show's star Piper Perabo bears an uncanny resemblance to Jennifer Garner. The story line is well written, the characters are dimensional and there is no gratuitous violence or profanity to mar the programming; nonetheless, the cast does justice to portraying modern-day geo-political drama in a realistic and compelling manner.",1455062400,,491,5.648648648648648

4181371,5,B003R4ZMQI,"Intriguing story of a young woman who turns a degree in linguistics into a job as a CIA covert operative. The stories are generally well written and include action scenes. In the first few episode, Annie (Piper Perabo) is horrible in the fight scenes. She seemingly has no idea what to do and it seemed a sure fire way to end the series by killing her off in a fight. However, the series found its audience and they apparently spent time teaching her how to handle the fight scenes better. At least she did improve in the fight scenes. Fun show to watch.

Love the Augie character. Joan, as Annie's boss, shows strength and weakness both, which makes her an interesting character.

Check out the show.",1454976000,,701,4.555555555555555

4181524,1,B003R4ZMQI,"We live just outside DC, so we can spot the ridiculous errors in this faster than most people, I suspect. First of all, CIA employees trained as analysts are NOT suddenly promoted to agents. And if any CIA employee wore Christian Louboutin shoes, she would, as my cousin who actually works for the Agency said, be immediately suspected as on the take from Russia or China! The cut-down-to-here blouses, tight dresses and stiletto heels are just silly. Then there is the problem that the series is filmed in Toronto, not DC. Yes, there are some stock shots of DC, but our subway is not called, nor labeled ""Subway"" but rather ""Metro."" And in one scene, as a car goes around a corner, you clearly see a sign advertising[...] which a quick web search reveals is ""An Insider's Guide to Toronto's Cultural Scene."" Very sloppy!

I like the fact that Covert Affairs incorporates real places that are ACTUALLY in Washington DC--where I reside. For me, this makes it easier to follow along with the plot of the story. Piper Perabo is a natural and very convincing in her struggles to work for the CIA and to balance a family life. The actor who plays Auggie is very convincing that he is blind (unless I'm just misinformed and he really is blind!). He and Piper have extremely good chemistry working for them on the show. Any way, I love this show and it's among my favor shows along with NCIS. Now, I think that's saying something about this show.

4181825,5,B003R4ZMQI,"Had never seen this show on TV, but the purchase was well worth it. (Watched all 5 seasons in about a week and a half.) The show gets better and better as it goes along through Season Five (the final).  It did seem a little silly that she was unarmed for the first season, and was nearly killed because of it, but that is remedied in subsequent seasons.  Piper Perabo is very impressive in the lead role, but there are extremely strong supporting characters and guest stars in this show. They probably could not do the things the C.I.A. does on foreign soil (breaking in without a warrant) in the U.S., due to the Fourth Amendment, but the show is still very enjoyable.  I assume the title of the series is intended to have a double meaning, since there are quite a few affairs going on besides those involving the C.I.A.",1450310400,,821,4.423841059602649

My husband was truly worrying about me, rightfully so, as I have watched those 2 series repeatedly to the point I know the dialogue.  Perhaps one could say I'm OCD?  Well, I searched Netflix, I searched Hulu and there wasn't a thing screaming out to me. So I thought, ""wait, we have Amazon Prime"", so I went there.  I'm so very thankful for Amazon in so many different ways but this one is for this wonderful series. There are 5 seasons & we are already in season 3.  I love it!  You will find great plots with wonderful twists that you didn't see coming; there isn't too much predictable in this series. The actors/actresses are fantastic & I warmed up quickly to Piper Perabo & Christopher Gorham (I really enjoyed him in ""Jake 2.0"") and his acting skills have only gotten better.

AND her love interest is MIA CIA so they are using her as bate of sorts. Plus a blind CIA intelligence desk guy in charge of watching her back.

An agent quits the company ( goes rogue ) comes in from the cold for the love in his life the women he left behind because of the company...

4182471,4,B003R4ZMQI,I like this show.,1444176000,,17,3.5
4182472,5,B003R4ZMQI,"I want to preface this by saying that I have not been a regular tv watcher since I was a teenager, except for the occasional Masterpiece Theater and documentary.  I started watching Covert Affairs because it was included with Prime and sounded like a fun diversion.  It hooked me from the start and I watched all 5 seasons within about 2 months.
Why do I love this show?
a)  Strong female protagonist who is brave and brilliant, intrepid and audacious.  But she has need of a learning curve for doing her job.  We learn along with her.  Annie Walker is a great role model -- she is true to her values throughout:  compassion, loyalty to friends especially.  This show should be required watching for all teenagers, especially girls.  That being said, we watch her evolve into someone who is top of her game yet pays a high personal price:  increasing isolation, losing loved ones, (spoiler alert:) even losing her health.  Yet, in the end, thanks to the fine writing and production team, in spite of the dark turn to the series, Annie seemingly winds up exactly where is best for her  with a stellar man and a career wide open, true fulfillment all dependent on her next choices.
b)  The acting and production values are superb.  The lead characters and even the recurring ones are believable and the development of their characters feels real.  We also get to trot around the globe with them.  Its a wild ride at times.
c) In spite of the descent of most tv into the realm of near-porn, there is no T & A in this series, not even serious swearing.  It should come as no surprise that suspense, realism, entertainment, and true engagement can be had without cheap devices, if the writing, acting, directing, and timely context are top notch.  Is there sex?  You betcha.  But its not graphic at all  no real nudity, so if thats what a viewer is looking for, look elsewhere.  The sex is also within the context of relationships within the storyline  it is not gratuitous.
d) A wonderful recurring Israeli Mossad character.  Its time mainstream media painted such a positive picture now and then.
e) Not sure how realistic a portrayal of the CIA it is, but its very good at depicting territorial squabbling between US governmental agencies, the high stakes game of low-level diplomacy, the hardly crystalline reputation of US ops abroad and at home, and the threats to peace, life and limb, big and small, that are truly out there at all times.  The viewer gets swung into the middle of all this at a breakneck pace because we not only care for the outcome, we care about the characters involved  the ones in the field and the ones behind a desk.

All that being said, heres what I didn't love:
- More than a few of the plots and the sequences of events are simply preposterous.  The logic at times was thin indeed.  Even the movements of characters from point A to B boggled the mind.  Still, one gets caught up in the storyline and the tensionand its not a documentary, after all.  By the same token, the aftereffects of the physical knocks the characters take are hardly realistic -- would have liked to see better makeup and continuity. Is that asking too much?
- A thoughtful, more rounded Annie becomes, over time, hard-edged and virtually lacking in introspective ability.  Perhaps this is how shes able to be nimble, riding her instincts and brilliant mind, and, also the price she pays.  It might indeed have been a good time to end the series with Season 5 for this reason.  After this she could only become a cartoonish character, a kind of Wonderwoman making all the right action hero moves.",1444003200,5,3600,4.61732283464567
4182473,1,B003R4ZMQI,"Terrible acting and hard to buy into the story line. Characters are overdone and over exaggerated, this show gives off the vibe of trying too hard, including the main character. I could barely get through one episode. I forced myself to watch the second episode hoping it would get better, but gave up about halfway through and turned it off. I'd say this would be maybe a good show if you're an 8th grader, but the content isn't age appropriate for that. Skip this one.",1443916800,2,470,4.541176470588235

4182647,5,B003R4ZMQI,"What a surprise to see that this series doesn't have more 5-star reviews. I'm giving it that rating, I think justifiably. To be sure, when I first started watching (just a few weeks ago, long after the entire thing had run its original course) I was somewhat diffident about the show. I wasn't sure I much cared for the basic premise; in the real world, the CIA has screwed up a LOT of things, resulting in a lot of needless suffering and waste (and damaged U.S. standing in the world). I don't hate those folks, and I do appreciate the dangerous and often vital work they do (as any sensible person ought to), but have mixed feelings. So anything that glorifies the Agency vaguely annoys me just on principle.

Nor was I much sure I cared for the lead, actress Piper Perabo, who initially struck me as a lightweight.

Wrong. She's a wonderful actor, deeply talented, as watching two seasons of the show (so far) clearly demonstrates. And after a couple of episodes, I found I'd fully suspended disbelief about the CIA and the show's premise (perhaps a little easier thanks to the show's plausible treatment of both the people there and the institution's normal operating procedures). Add to that a very strong cast overall -- Peter Gallagher and Kari Matchett are skilled old hands, while Christopher Gorham (new to me) is simply terrific.

And one more thing: the production values of the show are really marvelous. In ways big and small, this series comes amazingly close to capturing the feel of the real world, and the real people in the world, in every episode. So often TV feels too much like the product of a sound stage. The sense of reality in this show, by contrast, is impressive. Since the central premise -- Incredible Days in the Life of a CIA Agent -- pushes hard on disbelief, enveloping it with big-budget film production details makes a huge difference.

Is there anything worth down rating the show for? Well, honestly, the stories themselves. They are not bad, not at all. The writing is consistently plausible, and entertaining. But none of the stories have been magical, either. They're good, solid, craftsmanlike, but they don't have you on the edge of your seat or jumping up and down like the very best of TV can do. (To cite an example, the first two or three years of Burn Notice, a show otherwise not nearly as plausible). Nor is there the kind of heavy complexity and character development that you find in many British productions. It most assuredly feels like an American production end to end.

But if spy capers appeal to you, this show should be on your Watch List. It's beautifully done, and worth your time.",1441584000,,2644,4.67741935483871
4182648,3,B003R4ZMQI,Ok,1441584000,,2,2.0
4182649,5,B003R4ZMQI,"It does help that the same director that did the first Jason Bourne movie directs this series, but the character of Annie Walker is very much her own person. It's a great action series. It is also very cool to see a woman in Hollywood being smart, feminine, and highly capable all in one show. I loved this series, all the way to its untimely end.

There's one more but I forgot what. As for usual broadcast TV, the plots are self-contained. One can jump in anywhere in the season and get cawt up, especially since the plots are kinda simple. The blind guy is a gimmik (some spell it gimmick), a mascot, but not terrible. The CIA let him keep working, thanks to Technology, after he was blinded on the job. The good news, the show is watchable--that is, if yer out of other really good series to watch. The opening scene of recruits jumping from a plane--no godawful CAD here--was fabulous.

4182812,3,B003R4ZMQI,"I have so far watched season one. Piper Perabo stars as a CIA recruit because of her linguistic skills. I liked the action sequences but sometimes you have to keep your brain aside to watch a 5' 2"" girl, weighing probably 110 lbs, beating the hell of a guy over 6 ' tall and weighing 400 lbs. In her office, there is a handsome blind operative, a chiseled face, tall and lean Sendhil Ramamurty as another operative. Practically in every episode, Amy (Piper Perabo) goes rogue, doesn't listen to her commands and that kind of irritates me. The series makers on and off suddenly remember that CIA operatives also need to have emotions and personal lives. So they sprinkle romance, the tension between a husband and wife, and Amy also has a sister and lives with her sister who has two kids.
I watch for the action, tolerate the romance and other human stuff, laugh at Amy's actions, car chase, etc. One more aspect of this series appeals to me is the visual appeal. Many episodes have been shot in exotic locations outside the US soil.",1440460800,,1033,4.559139784946237

4182859,5,B003R4ZMQI,"Just want to put in my 5 starts not just for this season but for the whole series. I liked Alias very much so I thought I would give this a chance. I watched the first two seasons and really liked them but had an unusual experience in that after each episode was over I wasn't completely sure what happened. I went back to watch the first three while waiting for season 4 to arrive and they are really good well written spy shows. I am a big reader of spy novels but these shows are so subtle and complicated  that stuff still went over my head on first viewing and it will probably be several more viewings before I come close to understanding everything. Even including some of the great British spy shows this is the best of the genre I have watched.  I would give 4 top reasons why this show is so good.  1. Piper, the star of the show. 2. The writing  3. The quality of acting from the rest of the cast (including people who are on for just a couple of shows). 4. The location shoots.",1440028800,,989,4.135416666666667

I find it unlike anything else on my list of favorite shows, from Transparent to Catastrophe to House of Cards to Orange...Black or to The Americans. The two main characters are very likeable, the action is OK, the plots are unique, and overall the show is not dark. It's fun escapism amid a lot of heavier fare.

4182971,1,B003R4ZMQI,"Obviously this series had a very, very small budget. As everyone knows, the CIA are NOT supposed to be acting in the US, so you might expect a series about the CIA to feature wonderful locations in exotic lands and destinations and fast action drama. Instead, we get dull, badly told drivel with lots and lots of angst (the inferior method of filling out time on the screen when you have run out of ideas). This is no ""Strike Back"". Poor Piper Perabo. She is a decent actress, but the only thing wider than her mouth are her hips, and she must have annoyed the costume designer at some point, as she wears the most horrible clothes seen on TV. In this first series we get poor, domestic plots (if you can find a plot at all) and massive, massive use of cliches throughout.",1439078400,3,772,4.368055555555555

What I do not like is she never has a gun - yet male compatriots all do - very unrealistic. She instead VERY UNREALISTICALLY engages trained foreign assassins in hand to hand -- always defeating trained agents who in real life would annihilate her! I mean Really! A slender, not muscular 135 lb woman with no demonstrated skills of high level martial arts.  It would be more realistic to show her armed and deadly with a firearm - but maybe that's not PC!  Enough with the PC unrealism - give the girl a gun - make it real.

4182992,4,B003R4ZMQI,"The writing and acting in this series is superb. I had never heard of the show, but am now hooked on it. Have watched my way thru the first 2 seasons (30+ episodes) and am now starting Season 3.

Some things to be aware of: Each episode in the series is almost always a single CIA assignment. Many of the nuances involved in the story are complicated and you have to remember them in order for the story to make sense. For that reason, it's best NOT to start an episode for the first few minutes, then quit, thinking you'll resume tomorrow. By tomorrow, you will probably have forgotten some of the critical things revealed in the first part of the video.

There are some things that don't make much sense. The main character, Annie Walker, falls in love with or gets very involved with various men from episode to episode, but the relationships never go anywhere. Some of the men just disappear; that is, the man she was involved with in the preceding episode just never appears again. No explanation. She is also obviously in love with Augie, her perennial guide and protector in the Agency, but nothing more than big smiles and now-and-then hugs ever happen. It will be interesting to see where that relationship goes in the last season. Annie also gets herself into many life & death situations, but is never armed. Given the kinds of danger some events pose, I don't believe a real CIA operative would go into them unarmed.",1438992000,,1428,4.57421875

This is a great show for any age--it is clean entertainment yet the intrigue will keep anyone from the 20 somethings to the seniors among us entertained.  Piper Perabo just got better and better as an actor as the show went along and the show never got boring.  I believe that you will find lots of hours of solid entertainment if you like the Bourne series, White Collar, NCIS series, etc.  Piper brings a charm all her own and I am glad that we can watch this great show in reruns at least.

PG because of industry standard adult interpersonal relationships but without nudity, or vulgar language. Theme-based violence includes ""wet work"" also.

4183220,4,B003R4ZMQI,"Similar to alias, however it shows its own character and style .  This series is overall interesting and entertaining for a spy series.",1436832000,,135,4.869565217391305

4183225,3,B003R4ZMQI,"This show has a lot of well used themes in it such as:
The glamorous spy theme
The semi-bumbling  newbie theme
The beautiful woman who usually ends up scantily dressed a couple of times theme. (though no actual nudity).
The beautiful woman who ends up in various romantic relationships theme.
The disaster that always comes out well in the end theme
and a few others

Ok, so that being said, my wife and I have been watching season 1 on amazon prime, and have been entertained by it. We will probably continue watching it, although I am not sure that we would continue if we had to pay for the next season. It is not that I find anything wrong with the show, but that I don't find anything new and exciting about it.

So, my advice is that if you like the spy fantasy type of show, you would probably like this show. At least it is better than the stuff on broadcast TV that is not only lousy, but requires you to spend a lot of time watching advertising.",1436745600,3,955,4.265193370165746

Ding, one star down.  A couple of the characters are well played, but they're stuck playing stereotypical bad guy runs the show, good wife sees he's rotten, but has the wrong reasons in mind, character failings.

The lapses were in the form of amazing feats of strength and skill by an untrained CIA agent posing as a museum employee. Though she was never formally trained and was constantly struggling with her job assignments and her personal moral convictions the CIA would continue to send her on assignments to ""save the United States from catastophy"". Sound like a ""tall order"" for a 115 lb. twenty-something female with very little formal training that lives in her big sister's spare bedroom? In most cases it was but...uncanny instincts, incredible (and I mean Incredible) athleticism and some incredibly (and I mean incredibly) poor shooting by the bad guys enabled this agent to continually complete her assignments and evolve into the CIA's secret weapon. The show as a whole was great in spite of the annoying main character because the surrounding cast was excellent!

At the time it wasn't available for streaming, but it was definitely worth the purchase. The show is excellent and, being that the final season just aired, has a definite end point makes it perfect for binge watching! The show is fast pace, has story lines throughout each 'mini' season (the full season is split in two so each half has a new over-all story plot) Would definitely recommend to a friend and I do re-watch it from time to time.",1433116800,,554,4.388349514563107

Only to discover the man that left her (without an explanation) turns out to be a secret agent himself. Don't worry, I didn't spoil anything.

Third and fourth seasons seen to go in a typical white collar type crime drama forth season in particular. To many of those on now. For me I like the foreign intrigued the international part of the show. Ripped off the front pages of terrorism taking place now and terrorism actions plots stop. Have not seen fifth season yet hoping Amazon puts it on prime sooner rather than later. Would like to see the show pick up by Amazon or Netflix or some other network outlet. I know looking at the ratings the last year it fell off. If anybody at Amazon or Netflix or any other outlet reads this-- listen up drop send me a message- we will talk and see if we can come to a understanding agreement::and I will let you know how to get the ratings back up to where they were and then some::higher more than likely a lot higher..

as a spy/agent, gets better with each tour/assignment.
People have always been interested in the World of the
Shadow Warrior, and what they do, and that is one reason
why this series is so popular.
You never know, who they are, and what ""other"" jobs they
have to cover who they are.
If someone tells you they are Homeland Security, or CIA, do
you believe them?
Should you believe them?
Most people do believe them, but then again, why would they say
that?
I would not believe them, because I have been one of them.
Or have I?
Good tips of the ""trade"", are all over in this show.

4183756,4,B003R4ZMQI,"Since I am addicted to all the other shows on the USA Network, I put Covert Affairs on my DVR sight unseen.  It also helped that the show was being called a cross between Alias and Chuck, two shows I absolutely love.  While it didn't quite live up to that hype, I found myself hooked on the show by the time the first season ended.

The show centers around Annie Walker (Piper Perabo), a new recruit at the CIA.  She is pulled from training early and begins her field work.  Her new boss is Joan Campbell (Kari Matchett) who just happens to be married to CIA director Arthur (Peter Gallagher).  There are sparks between her and her two co-workers, Jai Wilcox (Sendhil Ramamurthy) and the blind Auggie Anderson (Christopher Gorham).

Her first case finds Annie trying to retrieve secrets from a Russian only to have him shot by a sniper while she is in the room.  From there, she tries to help a mother and son who have uncovered a coded IRA message, keep a senator's mistress from taking the fall for stolen secrets, and help an Iranian defect to the US through Niagra Falls.

What Annie doesn't realize is that the CIA wants her in the field because they are trying to flush out Ben Mercer (Eion Bailey).  Ben and Annie met and had a steamy affair before he vanished.  In the years since, Annie hasn't quite gotten over him enough to be ready to move on.  Why did Ben leave without a word?  What is the CIA's interest in him?

As I implied in the first paragraph, I wasn't hooked right from the start.  The show introduced too many storylines.  There was nothing wrong with any of them, but I needed time to get to know the characters first.  For example, it's established in the pilot that Joan and Arthur have marital problems.  At that point, I didn't care.  Each episode has a main story and then brings in one or two of the storylines and advances them.  Again, it would have helped if they'd have fewer stories to juggle so they could have advanced the story in every episode.  By season two, the multiple storylines wouldn't have been the issue for me that it was here.

The main episode of each week is always fun and interesting.  Annie is still very inexperienced, so watching her get into and out of some pretty hairy experiences is always entertaining to watch.  I found the storyline with Ben fascinating and couldn't wait to find out what exactly was going on with him and why the CIA wanted to get in touch with him so much.

Most of the characters developed nicely, too.  Annie is smart and resourceful, as she should be since she's the lead character.  Jai has some interesting family relationships that come into play as the season progresses.  We rarely see beyond Joan's business exterior, even with the marital troubles she has with Peter.  But the most interesting character is Auggie.  They really develop him in interesting ways.  When I found out in the pilot that he was blind, I didn't think he'd ever leave the office, but they managed to find ways to show him in all kinds of environments.  Next to Annie, he's the best character on the show.

The actors do a fine job bringing their characters to life each week.  I've read some complaints at Piper's performance as Annie, but I always find it believable.

The only weak spot when it comes to characters is Annie's sister Danielle, played by Anne Dudek.  Danielle really has nothing to do except try to flesh out Annie's character.  She does that at times, although their sub-plots are usually the most predictable of any episode.  That's no disrespect to Anne Dudek; she just doesn't have much to work with.

I should mention that the show lives up to its name.  There are several steamy scenes.  It doesn't get beyond PG-13 range, but there is definitely more content like that than anything else that USA Network has done to date.

The first season of the show consisted of eleven episodes, and they are presented here on 3 DVD's in their native wide screen and full surround.  Extras include a few behind the scenes featurettes, a gag reel, a set tour, deleted scenes, and three commentaries.  And, in a nice touch, the DVD's contain descriptive services for the visually impaired.  I don't think I've even seen that on a DVD before, and considering one of the characters is blind, it's a great tie in.

I'm glad I gave the show a chance to grow on me because I got hooked on the first season of Covert Affairs.  If you enjoy spy stories, be sure to check this one out.",1428796800,,4454,4.516896120150188

4183793,2,B003R4ZMQI,"I was disappointed with this show.  I was expecting a strong heroin and instead was forced to watch the most incompetent spy to ever lead a series.  As a fan of this genre, I expected a strong lead female character in the vein of  La Femme Nikita, Nikita, Alias, even Dollhouse, but found myself watching a character who goes out of her way to suck at her job, get caught, and be rescued EVERY SINGLE EPISODE!  She consistently breaks her cover or is discovered while keeping secrets from her friends and family (the people who she should trust and confide in) while divulging national secrets to complete strangers in an effort to ""win their trust"", or some BS like that.  The show is thoroughly unbelievable even as fantasy, and the main character, Annie Walker, is a complete disaster.
  Don't get me wrong though, the actors were great and do a phenomenal job portraying their characters, but the writers should have been replaced after season 1.  They decided to create a character who was a SPY who can't lie, falls in love with EVERY asset she encounters, has the hand-to-hand skills of a 4 year old (she literally gets beat up every episode), and the trade-craft of Johnny English.  I dredged through the series in hopes to find that her character grew, but instead she just got worse every episode, to the point that I could anticipate the plot after the first 10 minutes of the episode. Here it goes...
SPOILER: An event happens, she gets briefed, the seasoned professionals come up with a plan, but she comes up with an unorthodox way to accomplish it, they ""give her a chance"".  She meets an asset.  She finds the ""good"" in the asset, causing her to compromise the mission and fail.  The Seasoned Professionals come up with a contingency plan, or decide to scrub the mission.  She disagrees, goes off book and tries to finish the mission anyway.  This fails, she has to be broken out of jail or rescued by a blind guy or a deus-ex-machina old acquaintance.  The asset is saved and she goes back to work, praised for her cunning, ""instinct"", and stick-to-it attitude.  Wash, rinse, repeat...  Take my word for it, EVERY EPISODE is exactly like this.  I dare anyone to find a single episode that isn't.
  Ultimately, I felt like I lost several hours of my life and should have spent the time finally watching Breaking Bad or at least re-watching Nikita or Fringe.  If you can manage through the first season, then this is for you, but if you are annoyed by the end, trust me, it just get exponentially worse as it continues.

The show , which follows the sometimes wild and dangerous adventures of Annie as a fledgling field agent, is well written and well thought out. It's a little too pretty and avoids the ugly side of espionage, but, what the hell, it's fun. My beef continues to be Amazon's clunky software. After viewing each episode, it returns back to episode 1.  Since you can only scroll down to further episodes on your computer, you can't watch it in anmother room with Fire and a big screen. This forces you to watch it only on the big screen,",1427328000,,683,4.598360655737705

I just don't see how this can be 5 stars in comparison, my 4 might even be a little bit of a stretch.  It's a decent show and worth your time to watch and judge for yourself  but there is such fantastic content available these days that it's tough to see how this is 5 star? Perabo is good and plot lines are interesting to a point but a bit formulaic after a while. Pretty lady with a gun. Overall plot line: things aren't what they seem, tidy action adventure each week.  Nerdy guy love interest (or not).  There is some imagination going into the plot for each episode.  I don't know, a bit formulaic to stand up to the high quality content out there.

4184133,5,B003R4ZMQI,"I almost didn't start watching this show after seeing the behind the scenes preview that focused on ""the person behind the spy that you normally don't see"".  what a mistake that would have been, because this show is awesome.  Season 1 was good, but the show really kicks into high gear in Season 2 when both the acting and the story lines improve.  The action is awesome, the plots are believable amd relevant, and you can easily ignore the 5 minutes per show that are lame, when she's worried about her sister's marital problems.

The main character has certainly grown on me over time to become a pretty impressive spy, whether male or female.  In some ways this show reminds me of Alias which also had a strong female lead travelling the world, beating up bad guys and always just barely getting away.  I hope they keep cranking out another few seasons. Don't let the opening credits turn you off either, the rest of the show isn't so cheesy, I promise.",1422316800,,956,4.56140350877193

I will continue watching it, there is something about it that keeps you interested ( like an annoying background story while you go about your daily activities). the whole season shows her torn between working for a super secret agency, finding out about what the heck happened with her aBENdoned love ( his name's Ben), and adjusting to her new lifestyle.",1419984000,,688,4.7899159663865545

4184280,4,B003R4ZMQI,"This is a nice show. It is not great but provides good entertainment. I like the character mix and the look into CIA operations. One of the things that I wish TV shows would do better at is the fight scenes. I know they want a lot of drama when people fight and they want some long fighting sequences, but in reality if you got hit like some of these scenes show, you would be out cold quickly. Especially when a man is fighting a woman. Anyway, I know they are trying to add to the show when they do this. I look forward to watching the rest of the seasons. We basically only watch shows that have already ended so we can ""binge watch"". This is a good series to watch.",1419292800,,669,4.075757575757576

I love the exploration of Annie's own personal challenges as she learns how much impact being a spy for the CIA can have on her life outside the agency. The episodes are well-written, exploring Annie's character development as the primary plot. The sub-plot of intra-agency intrigue has been another source of entertainment. All in all, I like it, and would recommend this show to others. It doesn't have the twists of Nakita or the weird elements of Alias, but I think it's a quality action drama about spies and their lives.",1418688000,,561,4.73469387755102

4184371,5,B003R4ZMQI,once I got into it - have been enjoying the show. The Blind guy is fabulous. BG,1417910400,,79,3.7058823529411766
4184372,1,B003R4ZMQI,"Covert Affairs has changed dramatically from its initial premise.  It has moved over the years from an interesting study of a young CIA operative learning the ropes and trusting her hunches to a ruthless, savage depiction of a woman who has lost her bearings and lost her connection with the rest of the world.  She is dealing with hardened spies, and she has become hardened...and not very likable or sympathetic.  This last episode (14) in series five, where Augie is left hanging....literally, was truly grisly, and very, very hard to watch.  And frankly, not very entertaining.  There was less intellectual interest and far more physical abuse than necessary.  I can't imagine that I will watch it any more, since the writers are so off track.",1417824000,2,747,4.936

4184377,5,B003R4ZMQI,Excellent.  Like a good book you can't put down.  It is the character development that makes this one unique.  Fresh angle on an old theme.,1417824000,,139,4.48

4184380,5,B003R4ZMQI,This show is really good. I like the idea that the main character is a woman because it downplays the concept that the CIA and high level national security is male dominated. The interplay of male and female relationships in this scenario is also fascinating. I love how the characters use the business end to influence their partners.,1417824000,,335,4.793103448275862

4184393,5,B003R4ZMQI,"Did not think we would like it, but have binge watched most of it. Find the character development intriguing, the plots are reasonably well thought out - with the only exception that the problem needs to be solved in one episode. I would find this more powerful if there was plot carry over from episode to episode, ala Damages.",1417478400,,328,4.576271186440678

8403287,4,B003R4ZMQI,"This show is very unique, it was ahead of its time when it first aired, before the current trend of spy shows.  It's part spy show, part chic-lit novel, at least for the first three seasons, it takes a more serious turn in the beginning of season 4 and that continues through to the ending.  It has action and intrigue, but also a very down to earth look at the CIA through the eyes of the main characters.  This show ran for five seasons, and it was very consistent throughout, always improving, always finding a new angle to explore.  It was a lot of fun to binge watch and I enjoyed watching it again, I recommend this show to anyone looking for a more mild (by today's standards) yet still exciting and action filled spy show.",1524528000,,730,4.345588235294118

8403290,5,B003R4ZMQI,This was wonderful and really should have continued. Valerie Plame is the consultant and we saw things here that we don't see in other shows. It had surprises and people doing good in the world. I hope they change their minds and come back to give us more.,1521676800,,256,4.354166666666667

8403292,3,B003R4ZMQI,"meh.  realistic?  Not sure, no CIA experience yet.  But if I had to take a guess, heck no.

acting is stereotyping the roles.",1519862400,,125,4.304347826086956
