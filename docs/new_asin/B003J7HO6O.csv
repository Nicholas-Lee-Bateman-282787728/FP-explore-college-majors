Why I got a DVD black box instead of blueray blue box?",1286755200,,108,3.9545454545454546
4129344,3,B003J7HO6O,"I think the original dialog for this movie may have been in Spanish and lost something in the English translation. This movie would be a good example of what-not-to-do when creating multi-lingual audio tracks. Idioms must be specific to the spoken language of the target audience otherwise the dialog comes out flat...if that makes sense. It sounds as if Antonio Banderas himself (no offense) had translated the Spanish dialog to English and it did not work as well as it could have. I have noticed this in some other movies with multi-lingual or dubbed audio tracks. Otherwise, it has a good story, good video and audio quality.",1285977600,5,629,4.88785046728972

4129346,3,B003J7HO6O,"My 11-yr old daughter and I watched this together.  She liked it and I thought it was only OK.  This film was apparently originally made in Spanish, but is available in English as well.

The animation uses the now mainstream method made popular by Pixar films, though this film's animation is a step down from that you see in Pixar's productions.

The basic story line is that endangered species are rapidly disappearing.  So, whenever an endangered or threatened animal is injured or is ill, it is taken to a reserve where it can heal and recover.  But, an unknown organization is stealing endangered animals, and it isn't until later in the show that we find out why...so you'll just have to wait, too.

Anyway, the story centers around a pair of lynx and the organization's efforts to capture them.  The characters are OK, the voice actors are also, um, OK.

I was happy to watch this once with my daughter, but, frankly, it isn't good enough that I ever have to see it again.  In fact, I'd rank this show even below Jimmy Neutron.",1284768000,3,1034,4.570652173913044

4129348,3,B003J7HO6O,"The family watched The Missing Lynx tonight and overall it was only pretty good.  The story is about a group of animals being sought by a sinister hunter working for a mysterious boss collecting pairs of animals for his nefarious plans.  The animation wasn't very smooth and the overall artistic quality certainly isn't as rich as Pixar or Disney offerings (not surprising given the film's origins from a smaller Spanish studio), but the characters were cute and overall the film is likable.  The dialogue and writing weren't strong and the unfolding of the narrative was a bit clumsy, especially early on.  My 5 year old son enjoyed the movie just fine but it wasn't nearly as entertaining for dad as recent releases like Despicable Me or Toy Story 3.  A passable flick for the kids to enjoy and worth a rental, but not one we're likely to re-visit often.",1284076800,9,856,4.718120805369128

4129439,3,B003J7HO6O,"If one were to judge Phase 4 Films on the size of its CG feature film catalog alone, it would be clear that the company is making a serious push in North America to rival the works of industry giants like DreamWorks, Disney, Pixar etc.  Of course it could also be argued that they are taking the quantity over quality route but thats not to say there aren't a few decent pieces scattered about their library as well.

The Missing Lynx is perhaps one of their stronger entries, though, as my star rating indicates, is still a middle of the road film on its own merit.  But before we get into the films strengths and weaknesses themselves, lets take a moment to look at the facts of its production and how it came to be.

The Missing Lynx (in Spanish: El Lince Perdido) is a 2008 Spanish-British computer-animated action comedy film produced by Spanish studios Kandor Graphics, YaYa! Films and none other than one Mr. Antonio Banderas (known in CG circles for his portrayal of another feline; Puss in Boots from DreamWorks).

The film was directed by Raul Garcia and Manuel Sicilia, and written by that duo as well as Jose E. Machuca. It is presented by Banderas himself; which is to say there is a little segment featuring him and a few of the animated characters in a theater before the movie begins.  This has also made its rounds as the official trailer for the picture on other Phase 4 titles.  It was released in Spain on December 25, 2008 in Spanish and reached United States audiences on March 9, 2012 in English thanks to Phase 4 Films.

It comes in at a run-time of 100 minutes and wears a PG rating for some mild action/ peril and some rude humor.

So what about the film itself you ask?  Well I suppose I should start with the good.  The process of taking a foreign film, slapping an English dub vocal track onto it and calling it a day is usually a train wreck.  Dialog is usually nonsensical or overly simplistic in effort to match up with mouth flaps, natural conversational flow is almost nonexistent and never mind solid comedic timing.  Missing Lynx manages to somehow avoid most of these pitfalls.  In fact, a viewer would be hard pressed to recognize that the film wasn't originally created for English-speaking North American audiences.  This is definitely a very good thing indeed!

Thats not to say it doesnt fall victim to a bunch of other children film cliches; the gecko has a nerve-grating voice, moronic evil henchmen abound, certain themes are driven home to the point of redundancy etc.

However, all in all, the piece is watchable and the younger set will likely enjoy the bright, colorful visuals.  Character animations are nice for the most part and a majority of the humor is derived from the slap-stick, in your face variety.

Adults may not be quite so forgiving, especially those of us who have been spoiled by the likes of DreamWorks & Pixar into realizing just how far this medium can be stretched in terms of layered plot, flawless pacing and so on.

The story here revolves around the idea that a bunch of animals from Doana National Park in Spain are trying to save other animals kidnapped by a mysterious group of evil humans.  We do get a little plot twist in the latter portion of the film revealing that said humans ambitions aren't entirely malevolent (a welcomed change of pace to the dozens of films out there pounding home the message that all humans are destroyers of nature/ must be stopped).

So simple a summary doesnt fully capture how the plot meanders around and sometimes feels like it isn't entirely sure where it wants to go next.  Fortunately the ending does its best to redeem that sensation with a cute conclusion.

Speaking of cute conclusions, mine is that this is certainly a watchable film and worthy of the cost of a rental.  It is in no danger of costing DreamWorks any fans but it does hold up fairly decently among the ever-increasing Phase 4 Films catalog of CG movies",1411084800,,3938,4.599427753934192

4129441,1,B003J7HO6O,A very amateur attempt.  Whoever produced this does not understand how modern animation is done. This is what you get when anyone can use computer animation tools.  Very jerky animation.  Characters and movements are very stiff resulting in little to no displayed emotions.  No attempt to link the dialog to the characters resulting in disembodied voices.  Half the dialog is grunts and moans.  Much of it is multiple characters talking over each other.  Story does not hold together well.

So apparently it may take some time of getting to like this movie, but if you will not give up on it right in the beginning you might actually like it. The world, story and characters, could all be a little better, but I don't complain. It's a good movie, and despite the annoying chameleon, I found some characters quite likable. Don't expect too much from it, but don't think that the movie is all too bad, because it is not! It is far from it!

4129447,3,B003J7HO6O,"This is a decent enough film, although both writing and animation-wise it is not nearly at the level of the major studio releases. It's about a group of animal friends that are held captive and escape, only to discover there is an even bigger threat outside the facility they were in - someone is capturing endangered species for some presumably nefarious purpose. They have to work together to save each other and figure out exactly who are the bad guys and who are the good guys. The dialogue serves its purpose, but it's a little ponderous - not much humor. The animation is about the same - the animals are cute enough, but backgrounds and details are light, as is usually the case with straight-to-DVD/instant releases. So bottom line - if you are looking for some quick entertainment for young kids, this fits the bill as an Instant release, but not sure it would hold up to multiple watchings in terms of buying a DVD.",1334361600,2,925,4.612121212121212

4129449,4,B003J7HO6O,"Honestly, the cover and description don't do the movie justice. Go see the trailer on YouTube. Then watch the movie. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.

I had honestly not heard of this movie until a couple weeks ago when I was browsing a couple other CGI-animated movies. And the first time I saw the title and the cover I honestly passed it by thinking it would be no good.

Then for some reason I checked out the trailer. The trailer looked good, so I picked it up. Brought it over to a friend's place and put it on in the background while doing other stuff. His 5 y/o LOVED it and said it was pretty great after the movie was over. So, I watched it when I got home and I'd have to agree. Much better than anticipated. This was a pretty fun one.

Crazy scientist. Collecting animals for hare-brained scheme (pun intended; nope, no hares in this one, it's just funny...). The Lynx teams up with several other animals from the 'sanctuary' to escape (goat, chameleon, bird, mole, etc.)... Comedy ensues.

Overall, I found it a nice diversion and I'm glad I didn't summarily dismiss it (eventually). I've been watching a lot of CGI stuff lately. Didn't care for the Happily N'Ever After series. This one, I like. I think it ranks up there with a number of its competitors. The animation is good, the plot is decent, it's got a few genuinely funny moments (chameleon's color-chaging camouflage being out of synch with the background by a few seconds during an attempted escape was rather amusing).

So yeah, very much worth a watch. Kid approved. Me-approved. Go watch it. Skip Happily N'Ever After.

Maybe not quite on the same plane of existence as Shrek, Tangled, Rio, Rango, Happy Feet, Megamind, etc. But it's up there with maybe Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, The Reef, Shark Tale, The Wild, Over the Hedge. I guess it's pretty similar to Over the Hedge & the Wild, maybe Open Season? Kind of in the Buddy Animals genre of CGI.",1329177600,2,1940,4.560344827586207

4129451,5,B003J7HO6O,"A great story about friendship and working together. Excellent voice characterization in the English version. The voices of Felix and Newman were very good. The character's physical forms were very good. Its easy to see that the main artist was from Disney. The animation was OK, but that's probably because we've become accustomed to Dream Works quality.

Its one of the few movies that I don't mind watching over and over again with my granddaughter.

I'm looking forward to more productions from Kandor Moon!",1301356800,3,511,5.071428571428571
4129452,2,B003J7HO6O,"The animation is good enough to enjoy, but it is not top-of-the-line. It's weakness is a weak and uneven story and poor dialog. The characters just do not add up to the story. They seem to be isolated, but together. Anyway, the story has a message about extinction and plenty of chases. It is good for family viewing.",1287619200,2,317,4.482758620689655
