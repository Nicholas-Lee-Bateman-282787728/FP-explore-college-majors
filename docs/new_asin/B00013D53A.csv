1968795,5,B00013D53A,"I'll admit -- my first motivation for seeing ths was because I've been following Russell T. Davies's previous work now that he's the new Excecutive Producer and Writer for Doctor Who.
But I found this really wonderful, touching, romantic, and very real.  With wonderful performances by all of the actors -- Alan Davies, Leslie Sharp, and Jessica Stevenson are all very believable in their roles, as well as all of the supporting cast members as well.
I'd actually suggest it to people in combination with Kevin Smith's Chasing Amy -- there's a bit of similarity, actually.  And there's one thing that they both have in common -- one could get distracted by the sexual identity issues involved, when that's only a small feature -- it's about more universal issues about love and relationships.

1968806,5,B00013D53A,Bob and Rose is a heartwarming story and one for true romantics.  The story line is perhaps a little far-fetched but the characters are highly engaging and wonderfully portrayed by Alan Davies (cute) and Leslie Sharp (gorgeous) who have a wonderful chemistry that quite simply just works.  Highly recommended!,1326067200,,309,5.285714285714286
1968807,5,B00013D53A,"I shouldn't really write this review. Bob and Rose is so close to me. A woman who fancies the socks off a man. They enjoy each other's chat. Without affectation. She searches to make contact with him. He is natural. She knows there is something. Something she had not thought possible. Warmth. She is slightly older. He is gay. Barriers are broken down. Friendship is the basis of everything. It's what I fantasise about. Even in my dreams. I shouldn't really write this review.

As well as the immaculate acting I noticed the director's name. Julian Farino directed episode four of Rome Season 1. Watching Bob and Rose the pace of the narrative is perfect. Shot by shot, close-up by close-up. Music like a character in the story. The casting is as natural as the landscapes of Manchester woven into the delicious script. A script that takes me inside of me. Not the gay stuff but the unity of Bob and Rose's unfolding relationship. My last review (on Amazon UK) was for House Season 7 which could easily be subtitled 'An Anatomy of a Relationship.' Piece by piece, but somehow against the wind Greg House and Lisa Cuddy try to get together. Russell T. Davies has written something far above their professional ills. Something natural in a mixed-up world where relationships are little more than convenient alliances. Something to talk about. Or worse.

It's a celebration of human diversity. Greed is embodied in the character of Rose's mum's new man; the James Bond loving Gadd. Sickly and eventually found-out. The happy ending is in-keeping with this drama's dive into the reality of living and not just working. Characters blossom. And bloom. And I wish for a Rose in my life. And not just loony tunes.

Ten years since its making I've watched the double vhs tape many times. The dvd has subtitles to catch the odd word lost in a disco crowd. I never did catch what Rose said: 'I'm just a passing whore' I thought, but is: 'I'm just a passing hole' as they turn away in disgust. Mockery was never so well honed as here. It's the kind of script that banishes all fantasies of writing for television or film, that this reviewer sometimes entertains, into the oblivion of oblivion. Heaven is what we create between us. Sometimes it rains. Adores.",1322092800,4,2248,4.7150127226463106
1968808,5,B00013D53A,This is an unusual comedy drama that doesn't sound credible or interesting reading what it's about. A homosexual man falls for a woman? Hollywood stuff surely. But it's based on a true story and doesn't take the usual routes. The first episode is a little slow but each one gets better and makes you want to see the next one. Most people won't like its slice of life pacing...there are no belly laughs or strong dramatic scenes. It unfolds as life might and is therefore engaging and likable. You take to the characters because they seem real. But along the way you get some memorable funny moments and honest emotion. It's fun and enjoyable.,1314835200,3,642,4.640350877192983
1968809,5,B00013D53A,"Whilst trying not to give anything of the storyline away, I have to say this short series ""Bob & Rose"" is thoroughly engrossing, quite brilliant and possibly the best of Alan Davies career. Sensitive, involving, funny and sad, we tried to ration our viewing without any success at all, watching the six episodes in three sittings. Astonishingly well written and bound to stir the emotions and the brain cells.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bob-Rose-The-Complete-Series/dp/B00013D53A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bob & Rose - The Complete Series</a>",1306108800,6,585,6.512820512820513

1968811,5,B00013D53A,"this was a wonderful series - i bought two so i could lend one to friends. it's funny and emotional and a welcome relief from ""short attention span"" rapid fire movies. the characters are normal (and normal looking ) people. i loved it!",1288396800,3,235,4.488372093023256
1968812,5,B00013D53A,"What a little sleeper.  This series is well acted, well written and has universal appeal.  A gay man falls for a straight woman.  The journey to arrive at this conclusion is sad, funny and always interesting.  I'm a big Alan Davies fan and had he not starred I probably wouldn't have purchased this DVD.  Then again, without him perhaps it wouldn't have been as good.  Buy it and enjoy...you won't be disappointed!",1286064000,6,414,4.680555555555555
1968813,5,B00013D53A,"Saying ""great British"" tv/film is very nearly redundant as it is so reliably good, and this is solidly within that category.  The single-season series confronts various levels of homosexual prejudice and acceptance while portraying honest human emotions.  It's a love story - gritty and realistic, profound and touching.  I was already a Leslie Sharp fan because of her starring role in Afterlife, and I totally love  and highly recommend this dvd.",1277510400,4,448,5.267605633802817
1968814,5,B00013D53A,"Love can be, and should be fun, above everything else, as this film shows.  Imagine:  Great Friends, then great lovers, makes for Great Love.  Add British humor, or humour, in G.B., and the mix is irresistible!",1276128000,3,210,4.777777777777778
1968815,3,B00013D53A,"First off, this is an adorable series. I picked it up because of my Alan Davies fixation. (What can I say, I love Jonathan Cross?) The only thing I need to warn potential viewers is that this isn't the comedy that many people claim it is. It's a dramedy with more emphasis on the drama than then comedy.

Bob is a gay man. Rose is a straight woman. They meet purely by accident & fall in love. Falling in love was the easy part as there's more obstacles in store for these two- including a meddling best friend & a man who may be into Rose's mom for less than great reasons. Based on the true story of one of writer Robert T Davies' friends, it's an interesting story for most audiences.

I really did like this series. It's a cute story & if not for the whole ""true story"" bit, the story would be a little far fetched for me. The actors all do a really wonderful job & it's nice to see a few familiar faces such as Jessica Stevenson from 'Spaced'. The plot is great, but I have to admit that this isn't something that I could watch over & over again. I'd rewatch it, but not constantly so. It's a decent tale & many will enjoy it.

I'd just recommend this as more of a rental than a purchase, at least at first. This is the kind of series that people will either like or hate, with very few inbetween.",1260057600,2,1302,4.118110236220472
1968826,5,B00013D53A,"I am newly in love with Jonathan Creek so I looked for more by both of that series stars and found this!  I have thoroughly enjoyed the show - I loved the langorous nature of each episode.  I assumed the British don't have those 22 minute time constraints for comediess that we have in the U.S.?  It was really funny, touching and sometimes hard to believe it's true.  I also assumed it was probably a true story - that's cool to know.  Having myself fallen for my best friend who was gay when gay wasn't cool I totally believe it could happen.  Of course he was gay! I am since happily married but fully informed!  I think the biggest piece of truth in it is what someone else pointed out:  anyone can fall in love with anyone...  Try to be more open minded and you'll find happiness in romance!  Although this purchase was a hunt for Alan Davies - really enjoyed the actress who played Rose - and Bob's Mother is a brilliant actress too!  Really well done... Now I need more please!",1254960000,3,984,4.3224043715847
1968827,5,B00013D53A,"There are some things I thought could have been done better: the gay sex/romance seems to be casual compared to the hetero sex/romance & the lead actor isn't gay. In a way, I guess this Brit romcom is a straight woman's dream. As my gay male friend said, ""If you're gay, you're gay."" But it was based on a true story and one line from the film gets to the heart of the story: Anyone can fall in love with anyone.

It did address many stereotypes from the hetero and gay side, as well as from family and friends of both. I think it was well-written, well acted (Davies and Sharp were perfect in the roles and very believable)and quite humorous at just the right times. It certainly provoked hours of deep discussion between myself and my gay friends on many levels and that alone was worth it. My only regret is that the movie didn't last longer.",1254614400,2,845,4.348101265822785
1968828,5,B00013D53A,"A gay man and a straight woman meet and fall in love. An unusual situation, but it works with great acting and writing.  It's short, only 6 episodes (wish there were more), but the story of Bob Gossage and Rose Cooper unfolds and ends nicely.  I think it's a great show!",1246665600,3,270,4.2745098039215685
1968829,5,B00013D53A,This is one of the best British series around. Wonderful. Thoughful. Funny. The acting is superb. Brilliant!,1239494400,3,108,5.411764705882353
1968830,2,B00013D53A,"I have to disagree strongly with the rave reviews.  (The number of low-priced ""new and used"" offerings seem to indicate this is not a five star winner.)
It's not actively bad, but very, very dull.  Flat, uninteresting characters doing very little and seemingly taking forever to do it.  Maybe a half hour of actual plot in the whole series.",1238630400,3,340,4.728813559322034
1968831,5,B00013D53A,I absolutely love this series and after I understood its origins I loved it even more. No one would ever think a gay guy could fall in love with a woman and this series causes you to think outside that tight little box.,1230508800,5,219,4.116279069767442
1968832,5,B00013D53A,"As American TV becomes more and more obnoxious, it's been a delight to discover British TV goodies and this is one of the best among them. Well written, well acted, with interesting charcters who look and act like people in real life. HIghly recommended.",1169683200,5,254,4.795454545454546
1968833,5,B00013D53A,Bob & Rose had me very entertained.  I love the way the English use real looking people and human interest in their shows.,1140739200,6,122,4.304347826086956
1968834,4,B00013D53A,"I watched this recently on the Logo channel and was intrigued for two reasons. First the subject matter and second because it was written by Russell T.Davies who was responsible for reviving Doctor Who this year which I loved.

Was this show successful? Pretty much. The chemistry between the two leads was good and I liked the writing. I also enjoyed the parents of Bob and Rose yet you really never are given definite answers what happens to them in the end. I'm glad it was only a limited series because I don't think it would have held up over a year or two. The problems I had with it were the character that was trying to break Bob and Rose up (I don't remember her name). She was a stock bad guy who you didn't feel any empathy for at all so when she redeems herself at the end, you wonder, why does everyone forgive her just like that. Why didn't she get what she deserves?

The second problem I had with it was Bob, though not really changing his sexuality, but giving it up for a Woman. How fair is that to either party? I've read there was a lot of controversey about this when it first aired from gay men who belived that this was portraying Homosexuality as something that could be cured.

It can not.

In the end, I don't see that it explored that particular subject as well as it could but was enteretained never the less.",1134691200,4,1337,4.2936507936507935
1968835,5,B00013D53A,"This is a six-part BBC series about the unlikely relationship that develops between a gay man and a straight woman.

8005910,5,B00013D53A,"I am constantly checking British shows for my wife and me to watch, as we hardly ever watch the American shows.  I obtained this one a few years ago because of Leslie Sharp, who we really liked in Scott and Bailey, Afterlife and other series. We just got around to watching it recently and loved it.

I am not sure I really 100% for real believe the premise - gay man meets straight woman and falls in love - but I didn't care.  The writing is very strong, especially the dialogue, most of the characters are well developed and show some growth through the series, and Ms. Sharp is terrific. I must confess I became tired of the Holly character, as so much of the plot results from her meddling, but the character developed eventually. I just wish they had revealed more about why she acted the way she did, Penelope Wilton (who you may recognize from Downton Abbey) was wonderful as Bob's mother, and had one of the best speeches at a rally she led.

And what is it about British series and mini-series that it seems like whenever I really love the soundtrack music I learn two things: 1) that Martin Phipps has composed it, and 2) the soundtrack music is never available to purchase. i.e., Persuasion, 2007.  (Though in this case, there only seems to be one tune, with several variations.) It is a real shame.  Soundtracks don't seem to be as emphasized in the British market.  But never mind, enjoy the theme at the beginning and one or two more times during each episode.",1446336000,,1475,4.481343283582089
8005911,5,B00013D53A,Davies is one of the finest TV writers ever. This is a unique tale of friendship and love.,1426118400,,90,4.055555555555555
8005912,5,B00013D53A,"It is rare (maybe unprecedented) for a TV series to change my thinking about anything. This one did.

I now believe its possible for a gay man to fall in love with and be sexually attracted to a woman. Thats a remarkable accomplishment by series creator/writer Russell T. Davies and actor Alan Davies.

The brilliantly written early scenes quickly make it clear who Bob and Rose are and what draws them to each other. These are complex, authentic, interesting, decent people. The viewer cant help wanting things to work out well for them. But given the circumstances and the reactions of those around them, it may not be possible.

Rose is a strong, admirable woman beautifully portrayed by Lesley Sharp. Alan Davies gives a moving performance as a good, kind man shocked and confused by the intense physical and emotional relationship that develops between him and Rose. When he insists, Im not bisexual. Im gay. Im attracted to men and one woman, it is absolutely convincing. Astonishingly.

Writer Russell Davies deals with a number of compelling issues and subjectsthe unpredictability of love, the importance of honesty, the pain of breaking up with, and breaking the heart of, a really nice person. He does it without cynicism, without resorting to cheap manipulation, and with sly, sophisticated humor. Im awed by his talent.",1414022400,,1332,5.013574660633484

My understanding in life has come to this people usually try to stay the same out of fear of social rejection or fear and not understanding themselves but there's people out there that do change that find themselves in situations that add to their experiences in life that one moment we could feel safe and confident in who we are and the next moment something can happen and if we accept it or reject it it will change us and open our minds to a wider understanding of how positive and negative impulses and how we see the men's positive or negative and if we let them change how we see and experience the world",1386720000,2,867,4.22289156626506

8005917,5,B00013D53A,"I feel I've arrived quite late to the Alan Davies party, having only discovered him in the last few months when my college-age son (who knows I adore Stephen Fry) put me on to QI.  Fell in love with Alan and his sense of humor immediately. So I've seen his standup videos, almost all of QI, and I'm working my way delightedly through Jonathan Creek.  As a matter of course, two days ago I came across ""Bob & Rose"".  I've watched it through in two sittings (and was forced into two because I have a life and a family) and there is no doubt in my mind that this is the best work of Alan Davies' career.  The script is beautifully and frankly -- sometimes brutally -- written. The characters had depth; no one was painted with too broad a brush as innocent, guilty, good or evil (Possible exception there for Trevor Gadds).  Those who do wrong or hurtful things are rarely motivated by evil, but are more often simply misguided, fearful or irrational, as is the case with the various wrong-doings and misunderstandings perpetrated by the characters here. The entire cast is fantastic, but truly masterful performance by Mr. Davies.  Anyone who has seen his iconic performance as Jonathan Creek or his public persona on QI (which he half-seriously described to Bill Bailey on Comic's Choice in Jan 2011 as ""...some sort of nation's pet puppy"") will be amazed by his moving portrayal of Bob.  Davies is underrated as an actor in my opinion, which is possibly because actors rarely get the opportunity to work with material of this caliber.  Although this series is now eleven years old and I am happy to say that homosexuality is much more widely accepted (at least in the US), the realities and messages about homosexuality are pertinent still.  But the fundamental truth of the story is that when one really falls in love, you love the person. And sometimes the person you love turns out to be someone incredibly inconvenient. Those who perceived this series as a ""homosexuality can be cured"" tale are missing the point.  To me, it was more about how complicated and astonishing human relationships are.  Bob and Rose falling in love and the ensuing struggle within themselves and fallout amongst their friends and family seemed to mirror the experience that people sometimes feel when they realize they cannot deny their homosexuality.  Highly recommended.",1336089600,8,2354,4.785185185185185
