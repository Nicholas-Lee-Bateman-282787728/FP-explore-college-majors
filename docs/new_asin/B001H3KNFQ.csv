8307758,5,B001H3KNFQ,I was born a few years after WWII.  This movie showed me why it is so important to never have war on such a wide scale again.  May Freedom continue to be victorious!,1264809600,2,165,3.9696969696969697
8307759,1,B001H3KNFQ,Very poor in every respect. Half the audio is missing from the second DVD. Buy something else!,1246233600,,94,4.588235294117647
8307760,2,B001H3KNFQ,"I have to admit, I didn't review the whole DVD set. 180 minutes long, I couldn't make it past the 1st disc that covers the invasion of China.  Since it was produced in 2007, I assumed that it would follow today's standards of more matured documentaries with some insight into difficult decisions made, perspectives from particular individuals, or key points in major battles - it has none of that.  The first two years of China's invasion are covered in the first 14 minutes and covers one battle or event every 30 seconds to 1 minute.  I started forwarding through various chapters to see if the DVD layout would improve, it did not.

There is nothing particularly interesting about the way the war is discussed; the documentary moves so fast, it's hard to ingest anything.  It lacks depth and information other than dates and locations  that can be pulled out of any basic history book, with a narration reminiscent of an old, WWII Propaganda film.  The first two sentences of the disc are: ""1939 to 1945, the tyrants of the Axis powers, Hitler, Mussolini and Tojo, plunged the world into a brutal nightmare of relentless war.  The world was engulfed in an epic struggle between the designs of tyranny and the will of freedom.""  The DVD set is not horrible, it does have some interesting footage, but I didn't leave feeling any more informed than when I had started the DVD.",1234137600,3,1376,4.7
