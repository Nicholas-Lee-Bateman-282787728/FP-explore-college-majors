189366,4,1572525401,"The fourth of Eric Rohmer's ""Comedies and Proverbs"" bears some resemblance to the second,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Le-Beau-Mariage/dp/6300190005/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Le Beau Mariage</a>; both films are about tough-on-the-outside, relatively agressive and confident young women who are involved in art, played by slight, dark-haired actresses in both cases (Batrice Romand in the earlier film, Pascale Ogier in this one), both alternating between Paris and not-Paris.  Both women are looking for that magical something that they haven't got, and this is where the key difference comes in; Sabine if LE BEAU MARIAGE has had it with married men and the ""complications"" of the free and easy lifestyle and wants to settle down, while Louise in this film is in a stifling, closed relationship and feels the need for a greater level of freedom.  But both go about changing their lives in ways that don't quite turn out as planned, though Louise's mistake seems to cost her much more.

The stifling relationship is with Remi (Tchky Karyo), a boring suburban guy with a rather bad temper.  He wants to stay home most of the time at their apartment in the suburbs, but the somewhat younger Louise wants to rock out till all hours at parties with her hip friends like Octave (Fabrice Luchini) in the artsier quarters of Paris.  Octave is a philosopher who wants more than friendship with Louise, and when she decides to keep the apartment she owns in the city - much against Remi's desires - he figures he might have a chance with her.  She's definitely interested in a more ""open"" relationship and in fact has pushed some of her friends on Remi - but Louise wants the excitement of a rock star or biker guy, not a deep philosophical guy like Octave.  Pushing away both Octave and Remi, it's not hard to see where things are headed for the bright - but not very wise - Louise.

I feel like a party-pooper here, being the first to give this film less than a perfect rating, but I guess that it just doesn't fall into the first rank for Rohmer for me - at least not yet.  His films frequently improve over time, and I wouldn't be surprised if this one does.  I suppose my main issues are that Octave's philosophizing does get to be a bit much; Rohmer can sometimes really get his moral points across without being too overt about them, which I really appreciate, but here he uses Octave as a stand-in more or less, and though I have a high tolerance generally for dialogue-heavy French cinema, here I got a bit bored at times.  I really liked Luchini and Karyo as the male leads, and the tragically short-lived Ogier (dead at 25, shortly after making this film) is charming and beautiful, though her spaciness at times irritated more than disarmed.  Still those are minor complaints overall, and though it's not one of my favorites it is like all of Rohmer's work that I've seen well worth a look; and the ending is exceptional even if somewhat predictable, and worth the journey.

Unfortunately this appears to be out of print now, like most of the others in this series; I'd like to hope that Criterion or some other enterprising company will put out the ""Comedies and Proverbs"" as a set before too long; meantime this low-budget film looks decent enough on either the old VHS or DVD.",1291248000,,3329,4.850088183421517
189367,5,1572525401,"The gorgeous and adorable Pascale Ogier, whose talent is very much apparent in this ""gurls just wanna have fu-un"" tale from the master of subtlety and charm in film, Eric Rohmer -- Mozart beat him to it in music by a couple of centuries -- unfortunately died of an apparent heart attack within a year of the film's release, depriving fans of a rare opportunity to see talent grow.  What a pity!

Louise (Ogier) lives with muscle-boy Remy in the 'burbs of Paris but also has a place of her own in Paris where she can see friends and have a good time on her own.  The writer Octave is one of those friends.  Louise likes to hang out with Octave (he's married) but isn't attracted to brainy-nerdy types who talk and analyze a lot.  She goes for ... biker dudes who play in a rock band and treat women like, well, you know.  After a one night stand with one of these bad boys, she realizes Remy is her one true love and tells him she is ready to settle down with him, at last.  Alas, ""trop tard"" -- too late.  But the girl has spunk.  She picks herself up and off she goes on her own to new adventures, maybe having learned a lesson or two.",1240704000,,1136,4.174311926605505
189368,5,1572525401,"One short point to add to the many excellent reviews of this movie, if you watch the early scene ""Camille's Party"" very carefully, ignoring the distraction of the conflict between Remi and Louise that brackets other key meetings, you may increase your enjoyment of this subtle French talkie.  Or you may choose to view this scene again at the end of the movie.  It's all there, clear as a bell, but one is distracted by the cameras attention to the neurotic young focus of the movie.
In fact, this is the only Rohmer movie out of half a dozen I've viewed where a couple clearly and emphatically makes the transition to a mature, happy and probably lifelong relationship.  But it is mostly done off camera.
A couple of other tiny points:  The married writer who pursues Louise is probably Rohmer's alter ego in the film, and Louise probably represents his neurotic early films that typically don't go anywhere.  The movie also seems to have some message about the project-like surburbs with their cold metal facilities, vs. the warm hubub of Paris.  In other Rohmer movies, Parisians retreat to georgeous country homes with gardens, or seaside villas, but pointedly not in this movie.
If you have known people like the characters in the film, who say they want to be alone but compulsively hang out with whoever is available, becoming distracted from their true goals; if you like irony and don't need everything spelled out, and like to think about movies, you will enjoy this one.  If you just want a light romantic comedy, watch an American film.",1073433600,12,1548,4.775280898876405
189369,5,1572525401,"Director Eric Rohmer's FULL MOON IN PARIS is the fourth in his series of ""Comedies and Proverbs"" starring Pascale Ogier and Tcheky Karyo. To some, Rohmer is an acquired taste. You either embrace or dislike his style of filmmaking. He is one of the few directors that really know how to direct women.  He has an uncanny knack of getting inside their minds, and Full Moon In Paris is no exception.
The story opens in Louise's (Pascale Ogier) apartment home in Marne-La-Vallee that she shares with boyfriend Remi (Tcheky Karyo). Remi is an architect and a home bird, while Louise is more the out going type. She is the very opposite to Remi's rather conservative personality. Although in love with him, she feels uncomfortable whenever they go out together, as she senses that Remi is ill at ease over her long hours of socializing. Ideally, she wants to move to Paris where she works as a designer so that she can enjoy the nightlife with her friends.
Enter Octave, played by Fabrice Luchini. Octave is a writer who is married with one child. He also happens to be Louise's confidant. There is a great scene in Octave's home, when Louise, who is trying to resist his advances, offer's her opinion about when women should have children. Ogier looks really beautiful in this scene, and I love her hairstyle. In someway her dress demeanor is like a montage. She's impish, sexy, and refined at the same time. As Octave says she is flirty without realizing it.
This encounter with Octave shows that Louise is a woman of some intellect. For instance, her observations of life are well defined. She is conscious that some women have a limbo period in their mid- twenties, and that nature is forcing her to re-examine her own life.
As she says herself, she has been in and out of relationships since she was fifteen, and now needs time and space to be on her own. She is not prepared to make a long-term commitment to Remi just yet, and fears if she did she would lose contact with her youth.
In a way, Remi's stifling persona is partly to blame for her problem. He is several years older than her, and cannot comprehend why she does not behave like he does. She is artistic and likes socializing. While he plays tennis and doesn't. Clearly in his thirties, Remi has enjoyed his life as a twenty something, but now wants to curtail Louise of that privilege by pressing her into marriage. In essence, Louise senses that Remi is killing her youth. (There is a common thread in Rohmer's films, about lovers from different generations falling in and out of love, and Full Moon continues this theme).

When Louise eventually moves into her old Parisian apartment, she tries to convince Remi that her decision to stay in Paris during weekdays, only returning to him at weekends, would be best for both of them. Alas, her wish to have a more independent lifestyle does not last, and the loneliness of staying at home without a partner is well underlined during this segment of the film.
Desperate to have some company she meets Octave in a caf bar. Where during a trip to the ladies room, she almost stumbles upon Remi. When she returns she tells Octave what she had just seen. While he claims he did not see Remi, he did observe a woman that looked rather familiar. Liking her to someone that they both met at an earlier function. But he wasn't sure. Louise looking worried recalls a joke she had made to Remi. It was a test about going out with other partners to see if they were still committed to each other.
This apparent discovery sends Louise on a rebound where she meets Bastien, a musician played by Christian Vadim. The two of them enjoy each other's company, but Octave, who also has designs on her, arrives at the same party and disapproves of Louise's newfound friendship. It is at this point that the film evolves, with some fascinating insights into the female mind.
Without doubt, Rohmer's screenplay delivers some of the best dialogue ever written for the big screen. Fabrice Luchini, who later returns in one of Rohmer's finest films
4 ADVENTURES OF REINETTE & MIRABELLE, is perfectly cast as Octave.
I have a strong suspicion that Luchini's character is really Eric Rohmer in disguise, much the same way that Jean-Pierre-Leaud played Truffaunt's altered ego in STOLEN KISSES. Viriginie Thevenet and Laszlo Szabo are also excellent in supporting roles. Lastly, one must not overlook Tcheky Karyo's portrayal of Remi. His performance as a man frustrated with Louise's outgoing personality is a memorable one.
The film ends in double irony, one intended by the screenplay, and the other following completion of the film. While Tcheky Karyo is now an international star, playing in blockbusters like The PATROIT, GOLDENEYE, and most notably as the villain in BAD BOYS, fate was not so kind to Pascale Ogier. Sadly, she died from a heart attack several months after the film was made on October 25th 1984.
Pascale not only starred in Full Moon In Paris, she was set designer as well. The Master (Rohmer) is known for letting colors flow in his films, but Ogier, obviously in the driving seat, appeared to have controlled the amount of color used in this film. The net result is a striking presentation of less is more by Ogier. Eric Rohmer has always been faithful to those who have worked with him, and no doubt had she lived he would have used Pascale Ogier again. She was a beautiful talented soul that was taken from us at just twenty-four years of age.
In a fitting appreciation of her contribution to the motion picture industry,
Pascale Ogier was awarded Best Actress at the Venice Film Festival in 1984 for her performance in Full Moon In Paris.",1067385600,7,5650,4.694556451612903
189370,5,1572525401,"Fourth movie of director Eric Rohmer's COMEDIES AND PROVERBS serie, FULL MOON IN PARIS is without contest a masterpiece. Three terrific actors : Tchky Kario who, 10 years later, will be the villain in GOLDENEYE, Fabrice Luchini who has managed, in the nineties, to be present in all major french movies and Pascale Ogier who will tragically disappear in 1984, the year of the theatrical release of FULL MOON IN PARIS. A more than clever screenplay with subtle dialogs will clean your ears, or your eyes if you don't understand french, from the spoken insanities of today cinema.
Pascale ""Louise"" Ogier is living with Tchky ""Rmi"" Karyo in the suburbs of Paris. She likes to pass her spare time with her ancient friends while Rmi stays at home. So, in order to save their relationship, she decides to sleep every friday night in a flat in Paris, alone. FULL MOON IN PARIS describes the consequences of this decision during the three months that follow.
Like in the plays of Musset or Marivaux, tragedy is always hidden behind comedy and Pascale Ogier's smiles and tears form a wonderful rainbow.
As always in Fox Lorber presentations of european movies, subtitles can't be removed and sound & images are of VHS quality, no more.

189390,4,1572525401,"Despite the fact that Pascale Ogier does not appeal to me either as a woman or as an actress, I did end up sympathizing with her--perhaps pitying her comes closer to the truth. This 1984 movie resembles a game of musical chairs, with one lover being the loser in each round--until a new round begins and all players begin anew.

189392,5,1572525401,"Film director extraordinary Eric Rohmer did it. He managed to infuse his film, Full Moon in Paris, with so much French culture and style, the plot takes a back seat: style triumphs over substance.

The plot is interesting: a pretty young lady hooks up with as many men she could handle. Her live in boyfriend, Remi, played by Tcheky Karyo, her best friend, who she has no sexual relation with, Octave and who is married, and played by a young Fabrice Luchini, plus a young rock n' roll musician played by Christian Vadim. This keeps Louise, played brilliantly, by actress Pascale Ogier, who in real life died on the eve of her 26th birthday, busy to say the least.

As far as the plot's meat and potatoes, this movie is typical: woman looking for Mr. Right. As far as style, this movie is groundbreaking. Rohmer uses, scenery and visuals, more adroit, better than anyone else in show biz. Into the scene, he adds avant garde paintings, sculpture, furniture, clothing, windows, and so much more. It's all cutting edge.

I'm sure as a bona fide visual storyteller, Rohmer wanted to tell the story of mixed up Louise in search of real love, yet, it's how Rohmer tells his story that makes him an attention getting supreme cinema storyteller. An ideal bookend to the great French new wave art movement filmmakers of the 1960s.

In the end, I would classify Full Moon in Paris as an art movie, a far cry from a visual spectacular rising fireball. Yet it doesn't stray far away from the classical movie plot of a romance, a passionate heart seeking true love in a confused world.

 Nonetheless, what makes this movie special, is how the story is told. It's told with intense style, caked in French culture.

If the saying is so, it's not what you say, but how you say it that counts, Full Moon in Paris, speaks with style, or as it is also called, panache.",1453075200,,1850,4.570996978851964
189393,5,1572525401,"First, an important note: Amazon has a policy of grouping all reviews of ALL versions of a specific film together and posting on all the listings. Therefore you will find reviews of earlier versions of this classic film. It was restored and released by Film Movement in November 2015 and you will see reviews going back to 2011 from the Fox Lorber edition. So, I always advise buyers to sort by most recent revie4ws first and then look at date of review.

The next point I want to make is to be aware of spoilers in reviews. Like Rohmers films, this one does not move quickly and does not telegraph the ending. I already see two reviews her where the reviewer tells you how it will end. I may have seen this in its original release but it is so many years ago that I forget everything and let the story unfold. I really enjoyed letting Rohmer tell me the story, rather than knowing in advance.

The restoration is wonderful  though the colors aren't as bright as I remember. And it is in the 4:3 aspect ratio as originally filmed. I did find the subtitles large enough to read easily (not as common today as it should be). I won't consider this spoiler but you should know that the R rating is because of a brief scene of full-frontal nudity. It doesnt affect the plot though.

There are two bonuses in the package. On the DVD is a brief Archival interview: with the lead actress. Its only about 2 minutes. We are also provided with the films trailer. And in the DVD case is a colorful booklet with a text essay by Film Critic David Thompson.

If youve seen the prior DVD release of this and enjoyed the film, you might want to get this new version to see it in a new light

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

189398,4,1572525401,"Rohmer made variations on the same film-precisely why he organised his work into 3 related series:the Moral Tales,the Comedies and Proverbs,the Tales of the 4 Seasons. He explored love through leisurely talk around love. There is a curious absence of it in his world. His stories are more about the moral and social conditions in which love between a couple may or may not bepossible,as characters either manouevre each other into liaisons or agonise over where they belong. Following the male protagonists of the Moral Tales,the Comedies and Proverbs focussed on young heroines played by more or less unknown names,among them the late Pascale Ogier. Rohmer skillfully tacks between their thoughts and feelings using reasonabally crafted dialogue,so you get a sense of changingperspectives and modified attitudes,especially after they have had more inflexible disagreements about their socializing habits and living arrangements,when they have calmed down and utilise logic,revealing flaws in the logic. Similarly the discussion between her and Octave in the restaurant where she spies Remi and earlier he'd seen her girlfirend(not sure which one!) and he propounds his theories of them already being an item therefore encouraging her to have a place in Paris to live,would back this up,is truly deliciously teasing.

He who has two women loses his soul. He who has two houses loses his mind is the proverb Rohmer self concocts to this episode. Louise(Ogier) subconsciously wants her independence to socialise with her own friends rather than to be married to Remi. An excessive idealism about love sends her in unexpected directions. A complex heroine played with a mix of sensuality and sensitivity by Ogier(last seen in Le Pont du Nord with mother Bulle Ogier).The film is as much a tale of 2 addresses: the story teases around the paradox of simultaneously wanting the excitement and freedom of an affair alongside the safety and intimacy of a long-term relationship; the two houses turn out to be a shared one in Marne-la-Valle and a pied--terre in Paris; the tragedy is that of a woman who plays the paradox and loses. Paris, as city and experience, is effortlessly captured by Rohmer's casual approach to filming on the street. The film also features a pleasing performance from Fabrice Luchini, whose unceasing intellectual ruminations provide much of the film's comedy. Les Nuits de la pleine lune is a melancholic work, shot with an almost Bresson-like austerity.  The film is punctuated by long pauses of silence as the heroine Louise reflects on her situation and decides on her next course of action, whilst the sombre photography (predominantly an ethereal blue) helps to create a mood of solemnity which emphasises Louise's isolation. Pascale Ogier won the Best Actress award at Venice for her performance, only to die shortly afterwards at the tragically young age of 25.",1381363200,,2887,5.233261339092873
