8513260,4,B007AFC32Q,"This is a quirky little movie, that I saw on cable many years back. It's about a small apartment complex where the characters live and share their ""relationship issues"". It sounds tedious, but the characters are likable and somehow I kind of liked the movie for that reason. One of the ""neighbors"" is a guitar playing musician, and it's his guitar, often in the background, that provides the movies likeable soundtrack. In this movie, you get a feel for what the real Christina Hendricks is like. I think we'd like her in real life. Not a bad little movie.",1391558400,2,556,4.626262626262626
