We can't put any dressing on this one"" and later ""and it's not Ellen's fault; she gives it her best shot"" and then after searching for a better way to say it finally gives up: ""it's just a wrong headed movie"" and Baron says, ""take the 'Mister' off and that's what the movie is""

Leonard later sums up "" this film is a trial to sit through, an Ordeal to sit through"" and Baron later sums up ""this movie goes horribly wrong.""  They are so Right.  I love this podcast.",1438819200,,687,4.221374045801527

I guess it's one of those movies where you just have to let you mind go and enjoy.  While I personally love the film (it actually made it into one of my ""favorites"" movie binders), I can only (highly) recommend it to people who aren't movie snobs.  Pop some popcorn, shut down your brain, and give it a try.",1395014400,,482,4.042105263157895

802374,4,6304106025,"No matter how many times I watch this, Mr. Wrong always crack me up! Even though this was released in 1996, the movie highlights a timeless, ever-persistent issue in any day and age, regardless of era: how difficult it really is for singles, especially, women, to find decent dates. Some people come across as truly attractive packages at first like Bill Pullman's character in the movie until their hidden (or not-so-hidden) flaws come out. This movie has tons of humor, action, romance (at first), and more humor. If you like romantic comedies, you need to see this movie at least once, especially if you emphasize with Ellen DeGeneres's character, like me, in her search for Mr. Right. Sometimes, finding him is a lot harder than you think.",1392422400,,743,4.858267716535433

802451,5,6304106025,"OH HOW I LOVE THIS MOVIE! Sure, it probably fits into the category of ""kinda dumb, but really funny"", but come on- give yourself a treat and watch it. I have wildly varied tastes in films, and this is not one that I expected to like, but happily, I got a WONDERFUL SURPRISE. Since Ellen DeGeneres is the star, the humor is often more subtle and understated; I wonder if some critical viewers didn't get it because she doesn't do obnoxious, Jim-Carrey type humor. You have to keep watching past the initial 15 minutes or so, because the entire tone and pace of the movie changes-(you will see why). The scene with the clown at the window made me laugh so hard that tears started forming, and Joan Cusack's performance as Bill Pullman's immature ex-girlfriend is noteworthy. I made my teenage daughters watch this with me, because I knew they would like it...and I was right. They giggled and snorted all the way through the film, and even wrote quotes from the movie in dry-erase marker on their bedroom mirrors! I would call that a stamp of approval, wouldn't you?",1375833600,,1064,4.605263157894737

802453,1,6304106025,I cant believe I wasted my time watching this... this is the kind of movie that Hollywood makes so the actors/film makers/producers can buy a new house in Maui or a new beach house in Cancun. Maybe Just stick to hosting talk shows for middle age women going through a mid life/identity crisis... look for this movie at your local Wallyworld in the 5 dollar buy one get one free bin ..near the bottom.

802455,5,6304106025,"I've always loved this movie. It's one of those movies I find myself quoting once or twice. DeGeneres and Pullman are an AMAZING couple; they have great chemistry. The humor is not crude, but not dumb either. It's a realistic humor, in a way, in the sense that every character is believable with their comedic way. Even the exaggerated characters like Inga and Bob are believable. I definitely recommend this film for people looking for a toned-down humor, looking to be entertained by...well, entertainment.",1364947200,,508,5.059523809523809

It was on last night and I watched it again.  You do have to get past the knowledge of her sexual orientation but once you do let that go (come on people - its 2012 not 1912) I have to say I again found it a very funny movie.  Her expressions are hysterical as all this craziness is going on around her.  Bill Pullman is great.  His transformation from sexy Mr. Right to this incredible whacko is the best.  And there are some other great actors/actresses in this film.  Joan Cusack as the vengeful ex-girlfriend should not be missed.  Looking for a funny, light comedy?  This is a good one.",1351036800,3,726,4.311111111111111

802577,5,6304106025,"I saw this movie years ago and wanted to see it again.  When I was trying to find it to purchase, I was really surprised at the negative reviews.  My best guess is that this clever and funny movie was overshadowed by Ellen Degeneres own 'outing' and people couldn't move beyond their opinions of her choice in her personal life.  It's incredibly funny and deserves another look.  We've all had at least one time when Mr Wonderful turns into Mr Wrong right before our very eyes.  This movie just takes it to the next level....Murphy's Law goes into effect and hilarity ensues.",1323302400,,575,4.598039215686274

802652,2,6304106025,"Being gay doesn't stop you from pulling off a heterosexual, romantic comedy. Rock Hudson was the sexiest man on screen to a whole generation,but Rock could act.  Ellen isn't an actress, she is a comedian. While Pullman's character initially comes off as suave and sophisticated before degenerating into complete idiocy, Ellen does little more than smile at him as if she were a 12 year old girl out with daddy. The scene where they tear their clothes off to have sex seems completely out of place. It is silly but not really funny. Here her goofy smile just doesn't work. Pullman does a good job with this very shallow role, but he can't make the script work or Ellen seem desirable and sexy enough to be worth the obsession he develops for her.",1284854400,,745,4.601503759398496

802656,2,6304106025,"I really wanted to like `Mr. Wrong'.  I think I should start by making that perfectly clear.  I love Ellen DeGeneres.  I think that she is a total laugh riot and I am interested in watching everything she's in because of that very fact.  I also adore Joan Cusack (the more talented of the Cusack siblings, in my humble opinion) and so when I saw that she was here as well I was itching to get my hands on the movie.  Despite the fact that Bill Pullman is hot or miss with me, I did really like him in `While You Were Sleeping', which was released just the year prior to this film, and so I half expected to really like him here as well.  All that said, `Mr. Wrong' was just that; all wrong.

Ellen plays Martha Alston, a near middle aged woman whose younger sister just got married and is starting to feel pressure from her parents to tie the knot herself.  She is busy with her job and her life, too busy to really actively search for Mr. Right, and even though she receives advances from her younger co-worker Walter she still can't bring herself to make any commitments.  That is until she meets Whitman Crawford (you know something aint right when the guy has two last names), a charming and good looking man who seems to really be interested in her.  She falls head over heals for him almost instantly and soon they are inseparable.  Then, for almost no reason at all, Whitman goes crazy and Martha tries to break things off with him but she can't because Whitman won't let her.

Ellen has some funny moments in the beginning of the film but as the films drags on the jokes get stale.  Bill Pullman is as annoying as the day is long in this film.  He delivers one of the worst performances I've ever seen (seriously, how did Ellen get the Razzie nomination and Pullman walk away unscathed from this debacle?) with his disastrous attempt at executing charm and grace.  When he meets Martha in the bar the first time I was gagging at the idea that he was supposed to be irresistible when in fact he came across as somewhat mentally retarded.  Joan Plowright saves some of this film for me with her performance as Whitman's mother.  I just love her and adore her delivery here.  Sure she has a stock character but she handles it elegantly.  Speaking of stock, Joan Cusack is the crazy ex-girlfriend, so crazy that she makes Whitman look sane.  The great thing about this though is that it actually gave me an opportunity to laugh.  Cuscak is hysterical as Inga.  Sure, her character is far fetched and ridiculous but she makes up for the rest of the mediocre film.

I can't recommend this movie (even if I think everyone should see Cusack's Inga) simply because it really has no redeeming factor aside from Cusack's very limited role (she has two key scenes, both of which are gut-bustingly funny).  Well, there is the scene where Whitman forces Martha to steal some beer and as they are running from the gas station clerk Whitman throws a beer can at a homeless man.  That part was funny too.  But really, that's it.  This film had a lot of potential.  Sure, it's been done before, but it had DeGeneres and Cusack and that alone should have spelled success, but sadly it did not.  `Mr. Wrong' is a mess of a film that suffers from being too over-the-top without being -over-the-top enough; if that makes any sense.  It is a film that rests itself on the shoulders of a character so out there he is beyond believability yet it feels stale and bland.  How they messed this up I'll never know.",1213920000,,3493,4.436420722135008

I am a product of the late 70's/early 80's and so many references in this movie were spot on.  I think that this is absolutely the best movie that Joan Cussak has done and Bill Pullman really shows his comic acting ability. I was lucky enough to meet Bill Pullman personally, while working for a leading airlines, and he was a delight.  He indicated that this was one of his favorite projects.  Ellen is at a comic best, although knowing she does not date men, I had to try and put this out of my mind.  I have seen it maybe 100 times and never tire of it.  The soundtrack is fantastic to the movie.  It really is genius.  I know it is silly - and some of it is a far stretch...  However, there is so many truths.  Flo (Polly ?) from the sitcom Alice plays her mother, and the actress who plays Bill Pullmans Mom is fantastic.  It is really a great feel good movie, and just when you think that a guy is all together (wealthy and handsome) you realize it isn't always how it seems...  Do yourself a favor and enjoy this one.

But then as Pullman's character goes more and more over-the-top--and, just when you think he couldn't get any crazier, he does--Ellen's plight becomes more and more dangerous.

I think Ellen Degenerous is as funny as Bill Engvall and Louis Anderson most of the time but I didn't get this story. I thought Ellen liked girls and this fact was known by everyone. So why is she making a movie about liking a guy(the super actor Bill Pullman)that goes psycho. I knew she dated Anne Hench who I guess went psycho on her in real life. Hench also did a movie where she liked a guy. Please, I'm not very smart so make movies that I can understand. If you like girls so be it, in fact I'm totally cool with it, but don't pretend to fall for the great Bull Pillman if you don't like guys anyway. It's not like I would do a thriller with Natalie Portman and date a dude in real life. I'm totally straight and would date Natalie Portman in real life.

Ironically there is nothing right about Whitman Crawford (Bill Pullman), who transforms her search for Mr. Right into Mr. Wrong! To add insult to injury, Martha is then consistently pursued by his eccentric previous partner Inga (Joan Cusack) in a fruitless attempt to win back Whitman. Worst of all, there seems to be no escape. Every relationship has their ups and downs, but according to Martha, it's only downhill from Valentine's Day.
A Touchstone Pictures release directed by Nick Castle, 'Mr. Wrong' is a wild rollercoaster ride under which runs tracks of unstoppable humour, telling a tale of the things we do for love. An undeniably funny comedy hit that will have its audience laughing for more, with Bill Pullman and Ellen DeGeneres leading the laughs with superb talent, 'Mr. Wrong' is just right for a good laugh, flickering alive with humour and slowing down to a hilarious finish.

To their credit, Pullman and DeGeneres try hard to wring some humor out of this idiotic script but their efforts were in vain. No actor, no matter how talented, could save this lousy movie. I am amazed that a star of DeGeneres' magnitude would even bother to do such a film.

The strangest part is that you couldn't really tell Ellen apart from Bill in some romantic scenes as they were almost the same height, same build, same hair length, etc. And with her man hands and arms and the way she grabs him like a man would a woman during kissing scenes it was like two men making out.
