3948850,5,B002LSI1GY,"Unlike other DVDs that get boring after a while, this DVD gets better and better every time. Initially, I took the private dance lesson. No problem I thought I'd breeze through the DVD without any formal dance training. The warm-up was great and easy enough as was the beginning of the Cha Cha. Then it got a little tricky for me but I found Julianne so likeable that I kept at it. That first complete run through was pretty tough as I quickly found out that watching ballroom dancing and doing it are two entirely different animals. However, after more attempts and thousands of calories burned, I keep improving and having more fun with every workout! I would definitely recommend this DVD. You may find that you have a hidden dancer in you yet!",1261353600,3,747,4.582089552238806
3948851,3,B002LSI1GY,"Love Julianne and the idea of this video, but from someone that has never danced before this is not a beginner's video, even after watching the personal instruction I am still struggling.  I think she should have done this in front of a live audiance before recording to see how hard this is for beginners.  I will keep at it and let you know how long it takes me to get it down.",1261353600,22,379,4.178082191780822
3948852,5,B002LSI1GY,"I have a library of exercise videos, but this one is by far the best.  Julianne builds each routine in a way that's easy to remember. By the end, you really feel like you've learned to dance.  And she's right- it really is fun.  Thanks, Julianne!",1261267200,6,246,4.304347826086956
3948853,5,B002LSI1GY,"I love Julianne Hough as a dancer to begin with, and especially her teaching style, so I would have bought this DVD regardless. After just trying it for the first time, I can honestly say I am exhausted. I have been a dancer since the age of 3, and this was a a challenging DVD at first. I love how you are constantly moving, but it is not a beginner DVD where you only learn steps like in the DTWS DVDs (those are great for beginners). You a learning a routine, which is more fun.

I would recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to dance away their weight. It really is a great workout!",1261008000,80,587,4.104347826086957
3948854,5,B002LSI1GY,"If you are a Dancing with the Stars fan like me, and always wish after each show that you could dance like the stars, but don't have a partner to take lessons with -this video is just what you need!  Julianne Hough is such a motivating instructor and wanting a body like hers will keep you dancing right along with her!

This video is challenging at first, especially if you haven't had professional dance lessons, so I would recommend taking Julianne's private dance lesson first (also on the DVD) before starting the routines.  She breaks down the footwork, making it easier to learn and practice before putting all of the steps together.  Once you move onto the routines, you will definitely feel your muscles working with all of the twists, turns, and flirty moves! This is a must have for any DWTS fan or for those who want to learn how to Latin or Ballroom dance in the comfort of their own home.  Get ready to sweat and shake that booty - so fun!",1260921600,77,953,4.454022988505747
3948855,5,B002LSI1GY,"Drenched and happy.  That's me after doing Julianne Hough's Cardio Ballroom for the first time today. (I was lucky enough to get an advance copy.) What a wonderful and challenging workout...and what a wonderful and adorable instructor!  Julianne's directions are clear, easy to understand, and she builds her routines easily, cleanly, logically and so quickly that, before you know it, you feel like you're doing the cha-cha, jive and paso doble on Dancing with the Stars with her. I've done ballroom and latin dancing as an amateur and definitely recommend that everyone - even dancers - start by taking the private lesson first, before trying out the full workout, to become familiar with the basic movements and steps.  Then, the first time you do the full workout, don't try to copy her every move immediately -- learn it gradually:  get the ""footwork"" down first, then add the arms and then the styling as you become more comfortable with the choreography. This is a workout that you'll get better at and have more fun with each time you do it.  Great warm up and cool down too.  Best of all, when you work out with Julianne, you'll sweat profusely and you'll have a ball, but you won't feel like you're exercising.  You're dancing. And if you love to dance, this is the workout for you.",1260489600,233,1292,4.741071428571429
3948856,1,B002LSI1GY,It's my fault.  I should have tried playing it right away.  But I missed the return window and the DVD is defective.  It is as if it was put into the packaging when it was too hot and the 7 plastic lines in the case damaged the DVD.  I tried wiping the imprint off but they are there permanently.  Very disappointing.,1475107200,,317,4.131147540983607
3948857,1,B002LSI1GY,Product damaged and won't play.  Would leave no stars if possible :(,1475107200,,68,4.666666666666667
3948858,3,B002LSI1GY,"I've kind of enjoyed this video, working on getting back into some kind of shape, though I can easily understand the complaints from many, that she goes too fast, and it's hard to really get the combinations with what we're given. My main complaint, which is one I have about many exercise videos and classes, is that the training is not symmetrical.  It's not a good idea to continuously execute steps or combinations over and over, only doing them to one side.  Equal time should be given to doing the movements on the other side as well.  For instance, in this DVD, there's a combination where one does a particular bend, with one foot in front, and then a jump with one leg up in the air behind. This is done again and again, but only to one side (always the same leg in front, always the same leg up in the air, landing on the other foot). This is an invitation to imbalance; personally, I want to develop muscles, strength, and flexibility symmetrically, as much as possible.  I try reversing the sides for myself, though that can be confusing, following along with the video, and one shouldn't have to figure that out on one's own. Other than that, though, I enjoy this workout.",1473379200,2,1185,4.5233644859813085

3948861,3,B002LSI1GY,"Dont expect to do the moves the way she does them, shes way too fast and springy. I was a little disappointed because her tutorials aren't really that helpful if you are trying to perfect it. The best thing I can suggest is to either put some of her moves in slow motion. This is why I like Denise Austin at least she is actually performing the moves so you can workout and have fun. This is more like a dance audition. Either you perfect it or look like a moron trying to execute the right moves. I gave it 3 stars because it had my heart pumping but i was disappointed to find out my pedometer only counted 200 calories burned. I was hoping to burn at least 300 calories.",1469059200,,673,4.145038167938932
3948862,5,B002LSI1GY,Great workout!,1468800000,,14,6.5
3948863,2,B002LSI1GY,This video feels more like an advertisement for Julianne Hough than an actual workout. I was literally uncomfortable doing some of these moves alone in my house. I just didn't have much fun.,1465344000,,190,4.787878787878788
3948864,1,B002LSI1GY,Ordered this twice.  Both times it came with a defect on the disk that didn't allow it to play.  Some kind of problem in manufacturing.,1465171200,,135,4.36
3948865,4,B002LSI1GY,I have purchased several dance videos but I am not a dancer. In fact I have two left feet. This I must admit is one of the best videos I have ever seen. She breaks down the moves for the beginners which makes the video less scary in my opinion. I had a lot of fun learning the dances as well as learning to get fit. This is a fun way to add exercise in your life when you are not to exercising. I really enjoyed this video and will continue to do it from time to time.,1463529600,,468,3.7857142857142856
3948866,4,B002LSI1GY,Great and fun workout!  It's great that she has a separate section to break down a few steps so you learn then quickly for the routine. I think she explains things well. It's fast paced but with practice you get it. Also it's meant to be fun so don't worry if you don't get the moves perfectly :-) her backup dancers don't have her energy though.,1463011200,,346,4.242424242424242
3948867,2,B002LSI1GY,Well she is nice to look at but hard to keep up with her.  She is a great dancer and in great shape but she is not an instructor.  Too frustrating trying to exercise while watching this.  Much prefer other excercise DVD's.  Don't waste your money on this unless you just want to sit and watch her.  I gave this an extra star just because she is so cute.,1455840000,,353,4.057971014492754

3948870,1,B002LSI1GY,"Not easy to follow along, did not break a sweat even when I was doing the moves. Not worth it for a workout tape. Honestly, just looks like an excuse for the instructor to wear super short shorts and long leg warmers. People do not work out in clothes like that.",1452902400,,262,4.1568627450980395
3948871,5,B002LSI1GY,"I love it! Julienne makes exercise fun and she encourages you along the way as you get tired. Great workout for someone who wants a beautiful, girly figure without leaving the home to get it. Some of the steps are a little tricky, but who cares if you're not doing it right because no one is there to watch you! But once you've done it a few times, you'll catch right on and want to take these moves out on the dance floor of the next wedding you attend!",1449187200,,454,4.112359550561798

3948874,4,B002LSI1GY,"Definitely a workout and fun to do. I agree with other reviewers that the camera angles cut away too frequently, making it harder to learn the steps. Some steps are fast, especial the jive (I expected that). Overall, I'm happy with it and it made me sweat!",1445904000,,256,4.468085106382978
3948875,5,B002LSI1GY,"Although I loved it, it's a little too active for my old bones.  I'll have to try it again when I get some free time and am fully energized!",1445472000,,140,3.8275862068965516
3948876,1,B002LSI1GY,This is more about watching her dance in skimpy clothes than a work out DVD. The cameraman shows more of her stomach than her feet so its impossible to figure out the dance moves. This DVD was useless for working out.,1443657600,,217,4.317073170731708
3948877,5,B002LSI1GY,I love this work out video! It's a little difficult for me but I'm not good on my feet. It makes it fun to work out if you enjoy ballroom dancing.,1440633600,,146,3.7419354838709675

3948886,5,B002LSI1GY,Excellent video. Julianna does not waste time talking while you stand around. She gets you moving and keeps you moving through a sustained cardio workout. Too many other videos today leave you standing around. You may think you have worked out but don't be fooled,1430784000,,263,4.866666666666666

3948889,5,B002LSI1GY,"Great workout! I had latin-american dance lessons for some years so I can say that, to me, some sequences were quite easy to follow. On the other side, I think this workout might be a bit challenging for beginners but the DVD includes a ""breakdown section"" to make sure you can gradually master the coreography.

3948892,5,B002LSI1GY,"One of my favorite cardio day videos,  keeps my fitness routine fun.  I think if you aren't in pretty good shape already this video might be hard to keep up with but just take breathers and work up to doing the whole thing.  If you are in decent shape this will still definitely give you a workout because the intensity is really what toubpay into it.  If you get really low and keep your legs strong in te drive throughout the whole thing I can't imagine someone not feeling it the next day.  The moves are true dance moves which were a little complicated to keep up with in the beginning but still enjoyable and I loved getting better and better at the routine which kept it interesting for me.  If you truly want to dance and feel feminine and a little sexy while doing an amazing cardio workout that really seems to tone your whole body than this DVD is a fit for you.  If you want something that is simple and a straight exercise video you might not like this.",1426464000,,965,4.269230769230769
3948893,5,B002LSI1GY,"Really great dancing and makes you sweat!  I like her energy and how you never stop moving while she's teaching new moves.  I have this one and her other one, Just Dance, and love both!!!  Highly recommended!",1422662400,,208,4.5675675675675675
3948894,5,B002LSI1GY,This is a really good workout for those that's looking for a low cardio workout. And it also have step by step instructions to learn ballroom dancing.,1422316800,,150,4.592592592592593
3948895,5,B002LSI1GY,"I love this dance DVD.  She includes a ""private dance lesson"" which is helpful for beginners, a warm up, a cool down as well as 3 dance routines.  Beginners don't give up!  There a couple of steps in each routine that are very fast, but if you keep with it, you will get it.  As an ex-baton twirler of 15 years, the Paso was the eaisest for me to get, the jive was the 2nd easiest (the flicks are really fast), and the cha cha with all of the hip movment was the hardest for me, but they have all been fun for me to learn. You do break a sweat and I can already see a difference in my waistline after 2 weeks. I recommend it!",1422316800,,625,3.8976377952755907
3948896,3,B002LSI1GY,"This is okay, a little hard to follow since I am not a trained dancer.  I suppose if you watched it a lot you could get the hang of it, but I prefer Zumba routines, which seem a little easier to follow right from the start.",1421798400,,223,3.847826086956522

She doesn't ""instruct"" at all.  Everything goes very fast and is never broken down slow so you can see how to do it properly first to prevent someone from getting hurt and confused.  This is just 3 girls showing off their dance moves - not an instructional workout video.

If anyone who reads this ever films a workout video - keep the stupid camera still and one the instructors full body the entire time so  the viewer can see what heck they are doing.

I bought her Just dance Dvd as well and love that too. It's different kind of workout but both do full body moves and burn the fat off. Get lean and fit with both dvd's making an hour and a half dance routine which will show immediate results. Moves take time to learn, use slow motion on remote if possible, once memorized it's easy just to throw on the dvd and exercise without watching, just listen to what they are doing next and spice it up with your own moves in between. Lots of fun! Would buy more of her workouts but only has two so I have added Tracy Anderson's dance dvd to routine.",1414800000,,722,4.239130434782608

3948923,5,B002LSI1GY,"I've tried a few dancing videos before and most of them I can never get down what they are doing cause they just go too fast or the dumb camera man gives you a face shot instead of their feet (Not Real Important I Know!). This was very different. She goes threw each dance step-by-step building on the moves that you already learned until you almost have an actual dance routine.

If you still don't get the dance down, there are practice steps you can do so that you learn the foot work before doing the work-out. And it is a work-out! I would suggest learning a dance at a time instead of doing all of them every time. Otherwise, you will get board with it fast.",1403136000,,664,4.228346456692913

The first thing that I did was learning the steps and the routine. I repeated the steps so many times until I learnt them that it was my workout for the day. Then everything was easy and fun. I have never been so motivated. I feel that I have the three things that I wanted: dance, workout (I end up so tired) and reduce inches! I love it.",1400284800,,515,4.212121212121212

I bought this and I loved it.  It's a good one to put in the rotation but I definitely could not have jumped right in if I hadn't been doing Zumba before.  It's tough and I think it requires more strength than Zumba does so it felt like a natural progression.

I tend to pick up dance moves fairly quickly, but I think someone with two left feet could enjoy this as well because there is a dance lesson/breakdown segment where the moves are reviewed at a slower pace.  The dances were really fun and the instructor is positive and energetic!  I like to practice the dances without the video sometimes, which is telling how good the instruction is.

The routines and steps in this video are really confusing, and the slow-down explanations (there is even a special part of the dvd supposed to help you with the steps) focus on the wrong parts.  So, you get a long explanation of the part that isn't hard, and then you have to put it all to together suddenly in real tempo and you can't.  I spent so much time standing frustrated in front of the tv.  Just a note on me - I am usually pretty with it for these things, and pick up new routines quickly at classes like Zumba, so I don't think it is a just me thing.

The worst part is that while Julianne is doing the exercise routine, the camera spends only half the time on her foot- and legwork, if not less!  The point seems to be to focus on her face and torso, which doesn't help you when you don't know what's going on.",1383696000,,1002,4.102564102564102

Julianne does not spend any time whatsoever teaching you how to do any of the moves that she leaps into. There's a ""private dance lesson"" but it only covers four or five moves out of the entire 45 minute video, and is still focused on being part of the work-out rather than slowing down properly to teach.

I certainly got a cardio by just throwing in my own dance moves when I wasn't getting it with her which was most of the time.

I may pull it out every so often on a Saturday night just to have fun, but for me, I will stick to my Leslie Sansone videos for my daily morning workouts, which require no learning curve, can be done the first time you watch them and give me incredible cardio and strength training all at the same time.",1372636800,3,929,4.0

I honestly did not expect to be so exhausted and sweaty after completing the dance dvd but was pleasantly surprised that I was.
I work through the dvd from start to finish and feel fantastic afterwards.

After day four I could really feel the ache in my arms from doing the Paso and am looking forward to seeing the results.
My only criticism is that true beginners will find this dvd very difficult and may not stick with it!

I have a dance back round and am able to pick up routines very easily, however although most of the steps are instructed very well there are transitional steps that are not instructed which makes it very difficult stylise the routine accurately.

The jive is also ridiculously fast paced which I loved as it really gets you moving but I doubt beginners will be able to follow along.
My advice would be to study the steps and learn them at your own pace before attempting the routine at tempo.

That aside I highly recommend this dvd, definitely a great dance work out!",1370649600,,1063,4.549738219895288

I cant say enough good things about it. It is fun, and even if you miss a step, who cares?! Its great fun, a good way to lose weight, firm your legs, and the music is wonderful. At first, I was a bit intimidated because I do not consider myself to be the best dancer, but I had lots of fun, and once you loosen up, it is a great way to have fun. Plus, in this video there is a modifier for those who have delicate joints, cannot do the spins, or cannot kick all that high up. Its great.

I recently started a fitness dance regimen instead of doing regular fitness, I wanted something different. I have bought this and Zumba and dancing is a great fun way to lose weight, and it firms the body better than regular fitness. It lengthens the muscles, tightens the inner/outer thighs, abs, and back.

3948994,3,B002LSI1GY,I think Julianne forgets that not everybody has a working knowledge of dance. After reading the reviews I bought this thinking it would be a great beginners dance workout but she goes too fast and doesn't explain the moves very well. Half the time the camera shows the dancers from the waist up so the viewer can't see the foot work so I just moved my feet around anyway I could. The personnal dance instructions are good and she shows the moves slowly and explains them but she only goes through a few. If I had known I probably wouldn't have bought this video but now that I have it I'm going to do my best to keep up and not feel horrible about myself because they're going way too fast.,1364774400,2,690,4.2748091603053435

I will stick to Zumba. I've lost 30 lbs so far and do zumba 4 days a week.  The music and dance moves are way better  in zumba.  I thought  Julianne's dvd was a joke.

The dances strike the perfect balance between fun and challenging (unless you're a pro, but then I imagine you wouldn't buy this anyways) and are super high energy. On first run I thought that it would be too difficult, but it was so fun I ended up doing the cha-cha 4 times in a row until I got it :) As an added bonus, Julianne and her dance partners have awe-inspiring bodies that will remind you to keep your form in check for maximum results. I highly recommend this one.",1360108800,,582,4.205357142857143

It can be a little tricky if you've never danced before, but as a former dancer I could pick it up and got a great workout.  Nobody says you have to do it perfectly, as long as you are moving and having fun is what's important. I couldn't get the steps 100% the first time, but was still a blast!

My only complaint is I wish there were more dances.  Excluding the warm-up, and cool-down it's only 30 minutes...Wish she had more dvd's!",1360022400,,505,4.21875

Julianne's background isn't in fitness, but somebody should've worked with her as far as cueing and explaining new moves better. I consider myself pretty proficient in dance and was in dance classes a good chunk of my life, even I was confused. This video should be structured somewhat like Carmen Electra's Aerobic Striptease (the workouts on that aren't enough for major workout fiends, but the features and structure of the DVDs are awesome)in that there should be a run through of each routine and another section with the instruction so it's not so rushed.

The 12 minute training session is not really that helpful and she goes way too fast.  It's difficult to follow and i found that a lot of the video did not focus on her whole body, it would focus on her upper body, while you were supposed to be doing complicated movements with your legs, so i'd get lost!  I did Zumba and really enjoyed it, a good workout and very clear instructions, much better than this!!!",1358035200,,553,4.247619047619048
3949021,4,B002LSI1GY,"This routine is not for those wanting just a little aerobic activity.  It is difficult to grasp the various moves even though Julianne makes it look simple.  In the teaching segments she needs to turn her back to you so you can see the moves done from your own direction.  I am unable to keep up with her at this time but hopefully over time will be able to get the hang of it and improve.  It has 3 different routines, cha cha, jive and paso. For those who can grasp the moves and keep up it is a great workout, certainly not boring at all.  The price on this was fantastic!",1357948800,,575,4.098214285714286

Overall, it is okay - I am sore the day after doing it and now that I know the moves I will be more prepared.  She does offer a dance lesson so I recommend doing that before attempting the workout - I am a trained jazz dancer with very little ballroom experience and found her confusing at times by just jumping straight into the workout",1357776000,,511,4.257731958762887

At the same time, the moves are fun and not overtly complicated. Both the warmup and cooldown are actually pretty good also.

The dances are well choreographed for solo dancing and for maximum cardio effort. The jive will leave you absolutely breathless in the best possible way.

Julianne is a good instructor, and she looks great, but makes me feel like I would throw something at the TV if I had to listen to her squeaky, super perky voice much longer. They should offer a music only option. :)

Anyhow, well worth the money, and you can always turn the volume down hahahaha",1357084800,,735,4.553030303030303

3949030,2,B002LSI1GY,"I like Julianne's teaching style and would have given this a much better review except for two things which make it hard for me to use this video, camera angle and closeups. First, if a teacher is going to use mirror image teaching, the camera needs to stay in front of her. I get confused when I'm following in mirror style, then the camera switches to a side angle where she is clearly stepping right but saying left. I am not very co-ordinated and this really throws me. Second, I do not need close in shots of her chest and smiling face while I'm trying to follow her foot work. This video frequently moves in tight and b/c she goes really fast, with fast footwork, I'd like to see her feet. I paid less than $5 and got free shipping with amazon prime, so I'll keep the video and struggle until I get it, but I would be returning it if I'd paid more.",1352246400,,854,4.213414634146342

I was also very sore the morning after:) I know that many people are saying that it moves quickly, and sometimes the instruction is not that detailed for particular moves, they are kinda right. BUT, I was having so much fun, that I made the effort to stop the DVD rewind and pay attention to the footwork. IT WAS TOTALLY WORTH IT!! Besides, just moving around gets your heart beat up. The more you practice anything (especially dance) the better you get, right?!?!?!  Julianne Hough is so perky and positive, she's also an inspiration to look at as she has an amazing body!! I was looking for something to get me out of my rut, something to motivate me to workout again..... this totally did it! I am not a small girl by any means I am pushing deuces, but I was still able to do this. I am going to write another review after a month with my progress. I am eating a lot healthier and now I'm ballroom dancing the fat away, so excited and I feel happy!!! Give it a shot, it'll make you laugh and better yet SWEAT YOUR BUTT OFF!!!

Also, the choreography makes you use your brain a little more than typical workouts so... maybe, hopefully it burns a few more calories. I would definitely recommend it, the workout is a good length- between 30-45 minutes of good cardio. It also has a great warm up and cool down which, in my opinion make it a little better than the Dancing with the Stars dvds.",1343520000,,504,4.489130434782608

Its about 100 degrees today and I checked this out from the library as I'd been thinking about trying it out for a while now and thought this would be a good aerobic replacement for days I can't run outside.

I'm about 7 minutes into the first lesson which is the Cha-Cha and I just had to stop and write a review as this is the MOST confusing workout I've ever watched. The lesson started simple enough with twists, then a 3-count marching in place, then all of a sudden Julianne says ""Let's add the arms"" and she and her back up people are doing a fast count cha-cha step sequence with added side steps and side lunges and I'm still trying to figure out how to do a 3-count step while twisting. I've backed the lesson up twice now to just figure out the beginning sequence but Julianne's explanations and demo are not sufficient for a workout beginner, a dance beginner, or honestly even someone who's fit but has just started her DVD.

I have the DVD for the next week and will give it a try daily to see if the kinks work out, but the likelihood of me buying it not is pretty slim. I do not recommend this for someone who has watched some of the amazing physical transformation of stars from dancing on tv and expects to get results from this DVD.",1340755200,3,1337,4.23921568627451

Trying to combine her dancing knowledge into a workout routine was a great idea and so I bought the DVD - but - there was no way I could follow Julianne.  She would show what to me was a complicated dance step once and then expect you to get it right immediately as she moved on adding more steps.  Nada.  The DVD is collecting dust on my shelf and until I find someone better, I'm back to my favorites Tamilee Webb and Jillian Michaels.",1340236800,,603,4.348214285714286

3949038,1,B002LSI1GY,"I must say, my wife is a big fan of dancing and working out. She decided to get this DVD considering she wanted to try something new, since she and I have been working out to Jillian Michaels for months now. We love that kick ass Jillian but we wanted to try something different. Since this DVD was on sale, we just decided to go for it. And plus it was a cheap buy, so we asked ourselves what have we got to lose? Well, the answer is...more so than we wanted. First of all, Julianne Hough is a GREAT dancer and she kicked butt on DWTS. However, this DVD is horrible! My wife and I have been working out hard core for months and just wanted something fun to work out too, so what better than dancing and working out right? Yeah, I feel like with this DVD, I am not working out whatsoever. My wife felt like she was just standing there the whole time, moving all over the place, wondering what the heck is Julianne doing. She is a great dance but she's no dance teacher. Her directions are all over the place, and both my wife and I cannot seem to get the moves down. It was so uncoordinated, and all of a sudden she'll spring on new moves without explaining them in the beginning, causing a whole lot of confusion. As soon as we were done and attempting to dance, we concluded that this is hardly a work out, that it was a waste of money, and Julianne Hough is definitely not a great exercise/dance teacher on DVD. It was a huge pile of mess. The only way to do these moves is if you already know them and are a professional dancer. We wanted something to workout to. This does nothing but cause frustration. Julianne Hough's voice is also a bit annoying on the DVD. Will not be doing any DWTS workouts again.",1337299200,6,1709,4.197568389057751

If only Julianne would have done this, especially in the private dance lesson chapter, it would save hours of frustration for new students of these dance styles. After all, in ""live"" dance classes, the instructor will usually face the mirror with her back to the class. To be fair, she's not the only one who's made this mistake. I've purchased many dance DVDs with the instructors facing the camera THE WHOLE TIME. Spent hours with my back to the tv looking over my shoulder to learn the steps. Most of the time I don't even bother and just toss the DVD aside and waste money. This one will go the same way I'm afraid.

My cha cha was a seizure, my footwork a jumbled mess, and all the while Julianne looks pert, toned, and flawless.  I couldn't quite follow and I was waiting for my ACL to rip attempting to swivel and pivot like Julianne does.  I would've liked more instruction instead of the visual of Julianne dancing.  It didn't help that my reflection on the TV showed a weird alter ego of Julianne as the chubby uncoordinated version.  Okay, price-wise, no complaint- I bought it for $5.  My biggest grumble is that I didn't feel I could keep up with the very technical dancing...this isn't Ballroom, this is a workout- if I were a dancer I'd be dancing, not buying a DVD on Amazon.  Meh, so it's a good quality DVD, Julianne looks like what I wish I looked like, and the footwork is impressive.  Just don't expect that you can do it with her.",1336003200,2,1001,4.310160427807487
3949042,5,B002LSI1GY,Julianne is so much fun and a great motivator. The dances were a bit hard to follow the first time but by the second attempt it was fun and easy and a great workout.

3949043,4,B002LSI1GY,"So after taking ballroom dance as a child I thought that this would be a great way to relearn some of the dance moves and stay fit! While the dance did get my pulse rate up I thought it would do it more so; especially with the cha cha dance. The Jive was surprisingly difficult! I felt like she didn't break it down as much as she could have and didn't really explain it. Not to mention the fact that we did it once slow and then immediately took it to full timing! By the end of the cha cha workout I really felt like I was starting to get very good at the first few moves...not so much the rest but hey I'll get it eventually. The Paso was super easy though. I don't feel like the workouts were consistent with the level of difficulty, instruction, or cardio workout. (For example the Jive gets you moving really quick but the Paso not so much).

Overall: I will continue to use but definitely won't be my number one go-to exercise video.",1334448000,,940,4.193370165745856

Then when I first started the dancing not even half way through I was already tired and covered in sweat.  This work out is so fun and gets you going, however I do wish she broke down the moves.  But all in all it is fun and a great work and I would recommend it to anyone but if needed to like me, I kept rewinding it so give me a bit more of a work out lol.",1334188800,,473,3.6176470588235294

Overall, I viewed this video a couple of times only and never bothered after that, felt like it's a waste of time. I'd rather watch a youtube video like zumba, def a workout!",1332806400,,430,4.130952380952381
3949047,5,B002LSI1GY,"This workout is No Joke! You will be sore throughout your entire body. This is a fun, fast, energetic, and HARD workout.

I love that she has a section that breaks down each move for you, so when you actually get to the workout you aren't completely lost trying to get the feet. Julianne is an excellent teacher and is a wonderful motivator.

This DVD goes by so fast, and yet you feel it. I was huffing and puffing to get through the whole thing. She does let you catch your breath though, so you get a second (and third) wind. I just can't say enough good things about it. You may think you aren't getting a full body workout, until the next day when you feel it in your legs, arms, and torso. I highly recommend for anyone looking to get in shape and learn a few dance moves!",1332115200,3,778,4.18

3949049,4,B002LSI1GY,"Anyone starting this workout DVD should go through the ""Private Dance Lesson"" one or two times before starting the actual workout. During the workout, Julianne goes through the steps too quickly to catch on a first run-through.

However, this fast-paced nature of the workout makes it great for the longer haul. I've used it several times and the steps are coming easier and easier. Plus, I'm not bogged down by too much instruction now that I know what I'm doing.

It is a good workout. After a coouple of weeks I, at least, am starting to see results.

Really, I think the Private Dance lesson should be a bit longer and more detailed. That's the only reason I did not give this 5 stars.",1330387200,3,689,4.540322580645161

I got this DVD because I love watching dance, and thought it might be a more motivational way to get me moving again. The steps are not hard to follow so much as they are FAST. I wish her back was facing the front, so I could watch the correct feet and follow them better. I probably look ridiculous doing this workout, but who cares! It's in the comfort of my own home and it leaves me sore and tired. I can pause it when I need to, in order to get the steps down, or do them the best I can, and it's much more fun than running!",1329868800,,600,3.808

3949053,4,B002LSI1GY,"This is a fantastic workout!  Each of the dances really works a different part of your body to provide a complete workout.  That said, do not expect to be successful quickly if you don't have prior dance experience.  You will be able to learn it but it will take a lot of repetition.  Some potentially difficult aspects of the DVD: I agree that camera angles aren't always conducive to seeing Julianne's feet and there wasn't an explanation at the beginning for whether she was mirroring or not (she is) so I was a little thrown off for a bit.  I am a ""counter"" when I dance, so I did hate that no counts were provided.  Luckily, I could pretty easily figure them out on my own (but didn't always know when Julianne was going to start dancing since there was no count off).  Finally, although the music was well stylized and fit to the music, I kept feeling like I was off the beat of the music.  Something just didn't quite gel for me there.

Now the positives!  The workout moves along quickly, so once you've gotten comfortable with the steps, you can still do the video without feeling like you're constantly getting a beginner's lesson in what you already know.  The routines flow nicely, like a real dance, and are made up of steps that you will actually see Julianne doing on Dancing with the Stars.  So you can sit at home and throw out ""he wasn't low enough on those flick kicks in the jive"" or ""what lousy hip action for a cha cha"" in your best British accent and actually know what you're talking about!  Seriously, the routines are fairly short (4 8-counts) but they're legitimate ballroom dance.

The cha cha works your hips and abs primarily.  I didn't know my hips could get such a workout!  I really like this routine and feel like you could take a lot of the moves straight over to a Latin dance club and fit right in.  The jive is a killer for your legs and cardio.  For the first week, I couldn't make it through the whole jive sequence and resorted to hitting pause and gulping water.  It's super fast with lots of quick leg kicks, but once you get a hang of it, the moves fit together really well.  The paso is mostly an arm workout, but I also found that it really worked my core as well because of how strong and rigid your frame needs to be.  I thought I would feel really stupid pretending to have a cape and dancing the ""man's dance"" without a man, but I actually really love this routine!

Even though the workout does move quickly, once I really learned the routines fully, I didn't have much interest in going through the whole video.  I'm not so into following a strict workout plan but enjoy doing the dances themselves.  Therefore, I made a playlist of songs at the right tempo and with the right beat for each style (most of them being songs that couples danced to on Dancing with the Stars!) and now just put it on in my living and dance for a quick 15-20 minute workout.  It's great for someone who doesn't have a lot of time to dedicate to a workout video but still wants to get something in to tone up, get the heart rate going, and have fun!",1329350400,4,3079,4.331588132635253

I've never seen Dancing with The Stars, but I mainly bought this for the good reviews. I will first note my formal dance training ended when I was 5 :) I highly recommend going through the personal dance lesson, or you will be completely overwhelmed once you get to the actual dances! The dances are challenging, which at first might make you feel like they are hopeless, but keep trying! I like the level of difficulty because I think it will keep the workout from getting boring for some time. Additionally, Julianne is super sweet and cute, in a non-annoying way, which can be hard to find in a workout video. Overall, try it out!

The video can be hard to follow the first time through so I would recommend that you do the tutorial in the menu section before moving on to the workout. When the instructional part went a little too fast or I couldn't pick up the moves fast enough I would just pause it and work on them by myself for a little while and when I felt that I knew enough to keep up with the video I would continue playing it. This is a super enjoyable workout and I would highly recommend it to anyone!

3949057,5,B002LSI1GY,"This was my first dance workout DVD so I don't have much to compare it to.  But I really enjoy doing this workout.  The workout gets even better as you get more familiar with the moves and can concentrate on perfecting the moves.  I took some dance (not ballroom) lessons during my childhood years so I'm not a complete beginner to dance, but I wouldn't call myself anywhere near expert or even intermediate level.  After going through the workout maybe 5 times, I'm still having trouble with the Cha Cha portion even after practicing and practicing with the tutorial.  The Jive is pretty straightforward except you have to do the kicks really quickly.  The Paso portion is my favorite because I really feel like I'm actually doing a dance. I do my own warmup and cool down and just go through the 3 dance workouts one after another.  This is a great workout and gets my heart pumping and muscles working.  I've been looking around for another cardio ballroom dance workout DVD similar to this one but can't seem to find one.  I hope Julianne comes out with another one.",1326067200,2,1070,4.589473684210526

There is lots of jumping and kicking, and it promises to kick your butt. I found it of average difficulty, but I definitely enjoyed it! It is a good workout if you've done cardio or dance routines before. For a beginner it might leave you feeling frantic.",1325635200,,509,4.414893617021277

I've had some dance experience before, but this workout went way too fast to keep up with.  She has a nice upbeat personality, but that's about the only good thing about this video.
There is a step guide, where the moves are broken down, but there isn't much repetition in that section.  She shows you the move once or twice, and then goes onto the next.
I suppose you could stand in your living room and practice them alone for hours to prepare for the workout, but who wants to do that?

The actual workout portion is extremely hard, so many whips and turns, it is dizzying!
If you've had an advanced dance background and want to get back into shape, I'm sure it would be great; however, her fancy footwork is far too fast for the average person.",1325548800,3,868,4.333333333333333
3949060,2,B002LSI1GY,"This is an intermediate dance dvd with a bit of impact in some of the moves. The styles taught are cha-cha, jive and paso doble.

If you enjoy dancing, you will find that the moves are fun to do and you'll get a fast-moving workout. I am an experienced dancer, so I was able to pick up the moves quickly but overall I am not impressed.

I would definitely not recommend this dvd if you are one who prefers basic bootcamp or athletic-style workouts or is uncoordinated and uncomfortable with dancing.

Beware that the camera work is awful and keeps focusing on Julianne's face and upper body and that in the ""Private Lesson"" she only breaks down the footwork for some of the moves, not for the full routine.

Julianne is friendly and cheerful but to be honest her excessive enthusiasm can be annoying. As mentioned by other reviewers her idea of encouragement is saying ""Woo!"" over and over again and
her voice can definitely grate on your nerves quickly. In addition you can barely hear the music!!! (seriously?) and unfortunately there is no option for turning up only the background music or mute the instructions, which IMO is a major disappointment in a dance dvd.",1325548800,,1168,4.655339805825243

3949063,4,B002LSI1GY,I have been using this video for a few weeks now and it definitely gives you a good workout. I think the music is fun and the different dances keep your interest. The only thing I didn't care for was the video lacked instruction. I have done a few different dance videos and taken dance classes but it was a little hard to keep up with the choreography. Julianne could have talked through the stretches and steps a little bit better. She is fun to watch and has a very bubbly personality which shows.

All I knew is that I love her attitude, and that was enough for me... Now, before I tell you how it went, let me say that AFTER I did it, I came on here and read the reviews. A recurring thing was that it was too fast, hard for beginners, focused too much on her face, etc. Now let me say, I've been known to be a high energy, high endurance person with good coordination. I cannot stay still. I despise the thought of failure and if Im told that Im doing something wrong, I do it my way anyways (such as peeling fruit, or, in one case, sliding across anaa ice rink on my bumsy, or making paper fans when I sit under an A.C. Unit). Let me remind you, I am 256 pounds, with an inverted cocyx and tendonitus. Now, heres the sad, pathetic, mind blowingly stupid part of it aaall... I was able to do this video. WITH EASE. I,think the jive was my favorite, with all the kickies n flickies.  The moves were easy to learn, and youd be amazed at how a pause button and a mirror can insure that your doing it right. I loved the on tempo, its very fun and invigorating. The fact is,your doing repitition for a lil bit. When your doing the moves over and over (not too many times though) it doesnt matter if you can see her feet or not because its THE SAME FREAKING MOVES.  If you cant do it with her feet, then how does showing only her face affect you? It doesnt. All in all, agreat, fun, easy, happy workout experience!",1318377600,7,1728,4.049707602339181

3949071,5,B002LSI1GY,"Cardio is right.  I just did the complete DVD (I am notorious for limping away early), and I am, well, glowing would be an understatement.  I feel like I got a great cardio workout in approximately 45 minutes which I personally need to build my endurance as well as lose that last 10.  I gave it 5 stars because I feel that it does deliver on its cardio promise.

I get bored easily and I love Dancing With the Stars so I thought this would be a more fun way to incorporate cardio, and it was.  The Cha cha was the easiest, the Jive the biggest cardio and humiliator, and the Paso the most interesting.  WATCH THE PERSONAL DANCE LESSON FIRST!!  Some of the more negative reviews address the lack of footwork instruction as well as not enough full body shots of the dance moves.  To some degree that is a valid argument, but her dance lesson helps with that a lot.  Plus the nature of the dances themselves make them difficult initially; they move quickly, Very, very quickly. But, it makes sense as they have to move quickly to get the cardio level in.  The jive was the biggest killer for me as the steps are so fast.  I pooped out on it the first time, but I did not watch the dance lesson.  Thank God, no one saw me do the dancing as I know I looked like an idiot, but I will improve with familiarity.  At least I hope so.

So, here's the deal. Try it; you'll like it!

1.  Have fun with it.  It's different.
2.  Don't get discouraged about the steps, they will fall into place after a couple of times.
3.  You will burn some calories.

I especially got frustrated after picking up a Dancing With the Stars video - wtf, shouldn't they of all people do it right?!

Based on Amazon reviews, I ordered this video, and I'm so glad I did!  It's been a lot of fun - challenging, but enjoyable enough that I was willing to keep doing it until I got it (2 - 3 sessions).  I think for anyone with a solid knowledge of dancing, it would be way too simple, so it really is for beginners to midling-ers.

Something funny - I accidentally played the video with only audio for about 10 minutes (technical difficulties), and based on her voice -  Julianne has a *really* funny voice, it's goofy and strange in a way I can't describe - I was convinced I would hate the video... but she is so darned cute in person that I ended up totally won over.

1. I'm NOT a dancer. I've always enjoyed dancing, but I'm klutzy and uncoordinated and have a tendency to trip over my own two feet.
2. I'm insanely out of shape! I'm an embarrassing 220 and up until a couple of months ago, would have rather sat on my butt reading a book than get up and workout.

With that in mind, I'm loving Julianne's Carido Ballroom! Is it going to get you toned and in the best shape of your life? Probably not. If that's what you're looking for, you'd probably be better of with that Jillian Michaels DVD everyone is raving about. But if you're looking for something fun, challenging, that will get you off your butt and a few steps closer to your weight goal, this is a great DVD.

Julianne definitely challenges you, but she breaks down the dance steps so you can easily follow along. More confusing steps are broken down even more in a separate dance instruction video that slows everything so you can really watch her feet. It did take me a couple viewings to get the routines down pat, but I was able to follow along relatively easily.

What I like best though is that Julianne wants you to have fun. She's laughing and joking and making faces through the whole thing, and it makes you smile and wanna keep going. There's no ripped, scary instructor who never breaks a sweat or hitches her breathing. You can tell Julianne is feeling the burn just as much as you are. It makes it so much more enjoyable and motivates me to work harder.

3949086,4,B002LSI1GY,Today was my first time using this DVD and I really liked it.  Definitely do the private lesson before you start.

It looks like I'll be able to pick up the different dance moves pretty well over time.,1298764800,,332,4.076923076923077

I've done ballroom for the last couple years and thought it would be really easy, especially because when I watched a preview for it, they said ""anyone can do it"".  This is hard stuff.  She goes through everything super fast and it's really hard to catch on to what she's doing, even for a dancer.  She has a special clip that shows you how to do the technique so that you can do the workouts with her but it's just a hassle and not really a workout.  I feel more like I'm supposed to be learning a routine from this. Not like other fun dance workout videos.",1297900800,,589,4.140350877192983

The good points - Julianne Hough is skinny and hot and that girl can move! She's upbeat, cute, and fun. The moves are great and it doesn't feel like you're working out at all. It feels like you're at a dance lesson. I'm determined to get the moves down and dance along and be skinny and hot, too. I think anyone who keeps at it can get it down. She really does make you want to keep going.",1297641600,,603,3.9834710743801653

I will admit I had to back the DVD up a few times and watch again to get some of the moves, and I took dance for 14 years.",1297209600,,325,4.015384615384615

I no longer enjoy ""same moves/different setting"" workouts, no matter how fun the personality.  This video is PRECIOUS!  So glad Julianne did these dvd's.  I've only bought this one because I read reviews and felt this one was the one I would want.  So glad I did!  Not only does Julianne have the body to aspire to (that's what I like to see in a dvd), she DOES have a fun personality and she does very well instructing (there is a separate instructional part if you need to go over certain steps in order to do them successfully during the workout also).  No doubt you'll end up with a dancer's body with this fat burning yet toning-feel dance video--pretty in love with this one!",1296950400,,827,4.222929936305732

3949094,2,B002LSI1GY,"I agree with the reviewers who say that the dances are too fast for beginners.  Even when she says she is doing the steps slowly they are still pretty fast to learn.  And, I also agree with the reviewers who say the camera spends too much time on her upper body versus her legs and feet.  Why not pull back and show all so you can see both the leg and arm movements.  That would make it easier to follow.  This video may be good for young people and people with dance background but not for me.",1294963200,,494,4.051546391752577

I took dance for most of my teenage years and really think that you have to be able to count to keep up with Julianne.  If you are out of practice, like me, it helps to make modifications if the beat is to fast.  I started a month ago with the Crunch dance videos.  They helped by going over some basic steps(as well as new fun steps)and got me counting again.  I'm glad I got some practice in before trying this video.

3949096,1,B002LSI1GY,"I just recently took interest in dancing work out DVDs because I am joining an adult beginner dance class and from the reviews of this DVD, I thought it would be a fun place to start.  I started with the one on one instruction and I should have known from that that the rest of the DVD would be too fast to follow.  If you are speeding through a one on one ""slow"" instruction section, how is the actual work out going to be remotely possible to keep up with?  From the beginning of the cha cha she went too fast and didn't take the time to show the foot work at all.  She moves quickly to the next step.  How can you move on to the second step if you can't even master the first one?  Another thing that made it difficult is the camera angles focus mostly on Julianne's upper body.  You would think a dancing DVD would focus on foot work.  I wanted to shut off the DVD after the first dance but I decided to see how she taught the jive.  Again, it was too fast paced and made me frustrated.  I turned off the DVD in the middle of it and I'm considering never turning it on again.

Some tips that would improve the dvd:
1. teach each step at a slow beginner pace and then put it all together
2. have the camera angle on her feet and legs and not on her face
3. start the dvd with an easy dance to learn and progressively build on that to build a sense of competence
4. say something inspirational, not ""flirt"" every five seconds",1294617600,13,1427,4.060714285714286
3949097,3,B002LSI1GY,"The instructor was LOUD for no good reason.  She did the moves very quickly without regard for the beat of the music.  Finally, it just was not a fun dance video.  If you want a fun dance video just get one of Jennifer Galardi's videos.",1293840000,,236,4.2
3949098,3,B002LSI1GY,This would be a great product if you can get the dance steps down. The steps lesson given on the dvd is pretty good but confusing enough to make it difficult to do the workout will full benefit.,1293840000,,194,4.131578947368421
3949099,4,B002LSI1GY,"This is the workout video that I was looking for when I was in great shape and no workout videos gave me enough of a cardio challenge.  Now, nearing 30 and just had a baby, I'm not in as good of shape and this video made me well aware of that!  I definitely think this video is geared towards a college student/young and single crowd, but it's still a great workout for anyone even if not in that stage of life.  I agree with the reviews that it's hard to follow.  When I was in the midst of cheerleading and dancing years ago, I would have probably picked up much easier than I do now with my rusty dancing skills; however, even with it being a hard to follow, you can play it a few times to ""learn"" instead of workout.  Just pause and rewind to learn it better.  Most importantly, there is a 12 min instructional session that you may want to try more than once before the workout because that helps.  After you learn it a little better, I actually appreciate there not being a lot of instructions in the actual workout because instructions take up time that you could be doing straight cardio dance to burn burn burn the extra lbs away.  I paused and rewound to really learn the moves and then did the workout in full another day.  It's fun and definitely a good workout!  Would recommend to anyone looking for a ""dancy"" and fun cardio routine!",1292976000,,1346,4.305555555555555

Julianne makes it really easy to learn the moves, she is very truro and goes over everything multiple times, and even if you still don't get it she has a private dance lesson section. I have never used it so I don't know if that sections of the DVD is good or not

She breaks it up in 5 sections: Warm-up, Cha-Cha, Jive (my personal favorite), Paso, and a cool down

This work out is easy and so much fun, I don't even realize that I am working out until the very end when I am covered in sweat.

3949104,3,B002LSI1GY,"I have tried a few of the Dancing with the stars workouts and really enjoy the Dancing with the Stars Dancing the Pounds off one so I thought I would give Julianne's dvd a try.  I borrowed my copy and though this was not one I would purchase, I did find it did get my heart rate up and I had fun doing the moves, especially the fast paced jive portion.  Here are my pros and cons:

Pro: instruction from an instructor with good form and good cuing, well paced routine with enough cardio to get your heart pumping and the sweat pouring, a separate instructional piece for those that need a little more practice before diving into a quickly paced routine.

Cons: I am picky about instructors that are too ""cheery"" or ""chirpy"".  Sorry, Julianne, I love to watch you dance, but I can't take the overly cheerful instruction.  It's a personal preference, but I prefer just getting into the routine with a minimum of extra ""that's great"", ""you can do it"" kind of stuff.  The routines are not especially exciting.  I think after doing this routine a few more times I would tire rather quickly, maybe because the routines are fairly short.  I would rather have a longer routine or two than 3 shorter ones, but again, that is my personal preference.  I know this last one is a little petty, but the outfits, short shorts with legwarmers...ick.  I can barely watch it now, let alone in a few years.  This will look really dated really quickly.

Overall, it is probably a dvd most suited for those with some dance experience, or those that are willing to practice a little with the separate tutorial section.  If you love Julianne's personality and like your workouts with a peppier instructor (I'm thinking like a Denise Austin kind of perk) then this is probably going to be a keeper for you.

If you are looking for a more straight forward routine with more steps you may tire of this one rather quickly. Though I enjoyed the cardio, I have decided not to purchase this one, as it wasn't quite what I wanted.",1290816000,3,1999,4.498614958448753

While I've always worked out fairly consistently for as long as I can remember, I started to work out at home more recently to save time.  I also love to dance.  I thought Julianne was energetic and fun to dance along with.  I also like that the more complicated moves were available to watch in the 'private lesson' at a slower pace.  That way when you have the moves down, you can just watch the main dancing portion and Julianne moves fast enough to keep your heart rate up.  That being said, all the dance moves are simple enough that I had them down the second time I watched the DVD.

I thought that because I had more than two years experience taking ballroom dance lessons that I wouldn't have that problem. But after trying a few times a day for the first several days and then a few times a week for about two months, I still wasn't any closer to learning it. Those are not basic or even intermediate steps that she teaches. I think it would take personal instruction in a dance studio for me to figure it out.

Obviously some people can do it, but even so, many of the steps she shows, and some of the choreography -- the way she twists her legs and hips and upper body in different directions all at the same time are too complicated for a workout -- for a cardio video.  It's too bad, too, because Julianne presents her program well.  The movements and steps themselves look fun and energetic. That's why I persisted.  Why not keep the steps simpler but still fun, and let us enjoy the vigorous routine.  I felt I gave it a good shot. Now on to something else.",1279065600,7,1123,4.303317535545023

My major complaint with this is that, for myself, the best way for me to learn any semi-complex routine (more complex than the moves done in any typical exercise DVD that can be copied with barely any thought) is to see the instructor's back and be able to see their front via a mirror (sort of the way a dance class usually has a mirror on one wall.)  I'm sure they could figure out a way to angle the camera to catch the mirror image just right or put a different camera angle in a box on the corner of the screen or something.

That said, this is one of the best routines I've ever done with a dance workout and Julianne is a great instructor.",1278806400,,847,4.3081761006289305

The video seems to go a little fast when you first start out but after you get the routines down (took me 4 times to get comfortable) the pace is perfect.  Don't get discouraged, if you are new to dancing or don't have any coordination (like me) you will need to use the dance step guide a few times before you start the workouts and don't be afraid to rewind.  Julianne is very up beat and encouraging and it keeps you motivated.",1278547200,,482,4.217391304347826
3949121,5,B002LSI1GY,This DVD is great fun.  I was smiling all the way through yet definitely felt it was a challenging workout.

I became frusterated because I was not able to see or follow along with what she was doing with her legs.

The moves are simple enough to learn after a couple times through and they definitely give you a good workout. There are 3 different routines, cha cha, jive (my favorite!), and the paso. Each one is a lot of fun, making it easy to stay motivated to finish the workout and by the end you feel good about getting through it. Even the warm up and cool downs are good.

That kind of gets your body moving and you break a little sweat. The actual dance workout is great. The warm-up is fun and the dancing is easy to follow the way Julianne teaches it. The Cha Cha is mostly for your abs, hips and legs. It's a fun, sexy dance with a lot of hip action, which I love. I started to sweat after that section was over but the Jive took it to another level. The Jive gets your heart rate up, works your legs and abs, and you can burn a lot of calories. Definitely the most intense dance on the DVD. The Paso is more for toning the body. It works your arms, abs and legs. The Paso is about being in control and isn't as intense as the Jive but still great. The cool down is also fun and relaxing. This whole DVD is amazing. It's a total body workout and Julianne makes it so much fun. I love the way she teaches and how relate-able she is.

3949126,4,B002LSI1GY,"This was a fun cardio workout, but does require a good deal of coordination, rhythm, and concentration in memorizing short sequences of Latin ballroom dance choreography (I can see where the frustration might set in for those who are new to Latin ballroom dance, the most cardio-oriented of all the ballroom dances). Julianne's technique and execution was good, though her backup dancers appeared to not be as technically gifted specifically in ballroom dance (they still did a ""passable"" job of mimicking Julianne's movements in the background). It takes years of one-on-one private training and practice to become fully versed in the meticulous execution of shaping, hip movements, foot placement, styling, musicality, characterization, and posturing specific to each dance type (Cha-Cha, Jive, and Paso Doble in this case), but in the name of creating an effective cardio workout that would appeal to most walks of life, this is pretty darned good. I have done Latin ballroom dancing for over a decade, both competitively and socially, and the fact that Julianne has created this workout specifically for a fun calorie-burn while incorporating Latin ballroom dance moves into the aerobic choreography is a splendid idea to me. She is light-hearted, energetic, sexy, and sweet, although sometimes her high-pitched voice and hooting and cheering could get a bit shrill and disruptive to those who are used to the diction and cuing of more mature, experienced workout instructors (I myself am partial to Kari Anderson, who has certainly manifested her intellectual and creative gifts in her workout dvds, given she has double college degrees in Exercise Science and Speech Communication). Overall, I did enjoy working out with Julianne, and did not think the choreography or technique was difficult to learn, though I still watched her private lesson just for fun. I did wake up sore, especially in my lower erector spinae muscles (those that run along the sides of the spine), as the movements do require a reasonable degree of repetitive hyperextension of the spine, bending, spinal and abdominal contractions, and hip thrusts forward and backwards. I decided to share this dvd with my parents to enjoy, who are also both avid ballroom dancers and very health and weight-conscious...if they decide they like it and want to keep it, I'll order another copy for myself to keep some variety in my cardio dvd workout library.",1275264000,6,2423,5.2153846153846155

I did the lesson to learn the moves, the workout, and made it through the cha-cha.  The jive and paso are going to have to wait until next time... I'm beat!  This is going to be a great addition to my other workout routines to keep things interesting.

She does move a little quickly, and I wish she would add counting to her steps.  But, she repeats and builds gradually, so I was able to catch on. I might not win Dancing with the Stars, but I'm having fun and working out at the same time, so it works for me.",1274832000,,657,4.125984251968504
3949129,5,B002LSI1GY,"""Dance with Julianne"" is my first workout DVD and I must say that I really like it.  It's a good, intense, cardio workout, especially for those who need structure and motivation. Although I am an athlete at school (college), it's nice to have something to help stay in shape over summer break, and ""Dance with Julianne"" does just that. It's a good half hour routine that gets your heart rate up and running.

I do have a background in dance, but it's minimal, so the moves Julianne goes through are not too difficult, and she's motivating without being annoying (it's like she tells me to keep going just when I want to give up!)

Definitely a good investment!",1274659200,,660,4.576271186440678

She is so adorable, so easy to follow, and the moves ARE sexy! I have two left feet and after watching this DVD even I can move like a semi-pro :)

THANK YOU Julianne for making this DVD and the Personal Dance Lesson HELPS TREMENDOUSLY!!

3949131,5,B002LSI1GY,"I love the dvd!  It gives a great workout, only moderate sweating, but a beginner should take things slow and focus/practice the footwork before he/she can really enjoy the benefits of it.  I have been dancing for a while, so I really enjoy it.  Plus I learned a few new moves.  Julianne is my favorite on DWTS; she has a lot of energy and a great personality.",1273363200,,360,4.3283582089552235

It's great for those who are all ready in decent physical shape but just want to try something new or just learn a few dance moves all rolled into a great intense workout. It may be too complicated or fast-paced for total beginners. Julianne is also a very good instructor- she's bubbly, motivating, and clear to understand.",1273190400,,481,4.355555555555555
3949134,5,B002LSI1GY,"I received this and two other dvds (DWTS Latin Cardio and Dance off the Pounds) a few days ago after ordering from Amazon. I love Julianne in DWTS and think she's an amazing dancer, so that was one of the reasons I bought this dvd. To be honest, I'm 20 years old and am what I like to call a casual intermittent exerciser. I do pilates workouts every once in a while and though I have some muscle tone, it's really not very much (I'm not like pudding, at least!). I'm also from Latin/Hispanic descent and so, you'd think dancing would come naturally but it doesn't. I DON'T DANCE. Seriously. So going in to this workout, I knew I'd have difficulty with the steps but I didn't think it would be THAT hard. Boy was I wrong! This dvd is a real workout. I mean, the warm-up alone makes you work up a sweat! The moves are difficult to learn, but there's a special segment called 'Dance lessons' where Julianne breaks down the moves, and haves you repeat them. The good thing is, since it's not part of the work out you can re-play all you want without fear of losing your place or lowering your heart rate. The dances themselves incorporate real moves, although of course a bit stylized to suit the whole workout dvd idea. The Cha-cha really works your abs and hips. It's a lot of figure eights and hip action. The Jive will KILL your legs. And the Paso Doble will make your arms ache. If done right it can also help with obliques. Again, I'm NEW NEW NEW to dancing, and so the steps are SUPER HARD for me, but I find myself practicing the steps everywhere, the kitchen, bathtub (not safe) etc. And I've gotten quite a few of them a lot sooner than I expected. If you can't do them correctly the first time, don't give up!! Keep practicing, just like the stars in the real show do, and trust me with time, you'll learn them and you'll be able to keep up! It's a real cardio work out and it really works your legs and abs. Plus, Julianne is really cute in a sweet sometimes a little dorky kind of way. It's not boring at all! And if you can't keep up or feel waaayyy too tired, don't worry! One of the backup dancers was having problems too! You could just see she was REALLY tired half-way through the Jive. So it's not like they're super people either :D Definitely get this workout if you want a fun cardio alternative to working the treadmill and want to learn a few sexy, cool moves at the same time!

EDIT: These workouts are killer! You don't stop moving and you don't slow down for one bit! If you think this is a sissy workout, you're sooo wrong. The Jive alone will MURDER you. Out of all the dance workout dvds I own, this one is by far the BEST and the HARDEST. You may need to pick a dance and repeat it over and over until you get all the moves down. Once you do that you can move on to the next.",1272499200,20,2804,4.202226345083488
3949135,5,B002LSI1GY,"I have a lot of workout dvds and this is by far the best!! I had so much fun doing it and it was quite challenging for an experience dancer such as myself.  I definitely worked up a sweat.

As a beginner, my moves aren't as quick or as smooth as Julianne's but I still get a great workout.  She starts with a warm up (5min) then goes through three routines, cha cha, jive, and paso doble (10min ea), then ends with a cool down (5min).  She teaches some of the moves she actually teaches her dance partners on DWTS.  The three dances are great, just wish she would have also had the samba.",1272326400,3,486,4.239130434782608

It will help you catch on more quickly. I was out of breath after only doing the first dance. I had to work up to doing the whole thing. This is a workout that will definitely get your heart rate up.

I have no dance background and I couldn't even make it through the one-on-one lesson before I got frustrated and gave the video to my sister (who is also frustrated!).  I suppose if I gave it a couple weeks of just trying to learn the moves, I might pick it up but I want to work-out and not just stand there shuffling my feet.

I usually do a step workout or weights.  The trick is to keep coming back.  After about the 4th time I was getting through it doing some version of the moves, almost right.  Now I alternate doing step one day, Julianne the next so I get in three a week and the moves actually look good and feel strong.  She's a great exercise teacher.  Being a great dancer is one thing, being able to teach is another and she is right up there with the best in the business.  She's so talented for one so young.  Great job and I hope she does another one.  I'll be first in line.",1271289600,3,741,4.006849315068493

I've done it about six times so far and each time I get better at the moves, though there are parts where I'm keeping it lower impact until I'm in better shape. I don't worry about being perfect at it since even my imperfect moves keep me sweating and moving.  Every time I start with the class part at the beginning and do use my pause and rewind to practice the moves. That has helped a lot.

This video is so fast you hardly have time to figure out what you are doing before you are doing something else!  (And I KNOW the cha-cha)  The pacing is really poor and the whole tempo of the video is just way to fast. (Definitely a good workout if you know what you're doing).  Julianne does not give very clear instructions as to what is happening next and half the time the camera is on her abdomen or face so that you can't see the footwork.

I was wrong but I haven't done the private class. After my first time fiasco I tried this again with the private class and it went a lot better. This one is really different from all my videos and I love it for that it is challenging not for beginners but for intermediate is good. It is time saving because once you know the moves you can do it all in 45 minutes and it is a total cardio workout with warmup and cool down. You will be very toned this one is really will help you to get the lean body of a dancer if it is that what you are looking for.,1270512000,,684,3.858156028368794

I even did the bonus section first to see if that would clarify things but it didn't.

I have been dancing for 21 years , so I picked up the steps pretty easily, but there is a private lesson on the tape that breaks them down well for all those non-dancers.
All I can say is this is definitely a work out, but its so much fun! I was literally smiling through a good portion of the DVD. Basically, I think its awesome and Juliannes personality makes it even more enjoyable",1268956800,,570,4.008771929824562
3949154,1,B002LSI1GY,"Julianne clams ""What's great about this DVD is if you never danced, if you have a little experience they're easy dance moves that you can pick up .... anybody can do it.""  FALSE  While I'm no professional I have taken a lesson or two.  While I may lack in technique, I'm usually able to pick up moves (footwork) pretty easily.  Not with this video.  The problems with this video

1. Julianne is facing you so you are dancing to a mirror image.  It would have been nice to have her break down the moves by following her footwork exactly.  Matter of fact while teaching a move she says to always cross right over, yet in the video she was doing left over right?? Confusing

2.  Too fast from the start.  Most instructors start at a slow pace so you are comfortable with the moves before moving on to a faster tempo. I have trouble keeping up with the music because I don't have my footwork down yet.

3. Camera doesn't show the footwork enough.  OK, it's bad enough I'm trying to follow a mirror image but what's worse it that the camera is constantly zooming in on Julianne's face.  She is a beautiful girl, but it's her FEET I need to see to learn the dance! At least show a full body shot or something.

4. Julianne is poor at teaching you HOW to do the moves.  Again, she is just too fast.  Basically just showing you what to do, not how to do it.  She may be able to teach those stars how to dance, but in this video she doesn't think of beginners. Slow it down girl! Show me step by step please.

I do believe that if I were able to learn the routine and keep up with her moves, this would be a fun and fantastic workout.  Sadly, this video just makes it too hard to learn. I give it one star because it is NOT for beginners! Had it not been marketed for beginners, I would have given it an extra star or two, blaming myself for not being able to keep up.",1268784000,138,1859,4.139664804469274

Julianne's Cardio Ballroom definitely makes me break a sweat and gives a fun workout, though I would supplement the DVD with other exercises. The only issue I have with the workout is that the camera man does too many close-ups of Julianne's face when he should either be panning out or focusing on her feet so you can learn the dance moves. I got frustrated at one point because every time she would instruct you to watch what she was doing the camera guy decided that would be a perfect time for a close-up shot.

Still, a lot of fun and a delight to watch, just somewhat frustrating to have to slow, stop or repeat steps (this compromises the cardio effect). WE would have been better served had she focused more on instruction rather than just setting us up to watch her own brilliance.

As soon as I started doing the dances, my stomach and legs were burning! The footwork on the Jive is very quick and tricky, but after a few times I got it. The thing that I love the most about this workout is how much fun it is. Although it wears you out, you are having such a good time dancing that you don't feel like you're working out.

3949173,4,B002LSI1GY,I wish I could rate it a 4.5 becuase this video is so much fun and it left me sweaty and slightly sore the next day. The first time I did it I was a little overwhelmed. Although I had danced before it took me a few workouts to really get the steps down so my advice would be to not give up if it seems difficult the first time. Also I realized that I didn't have to do EXACTLY what she was doing on the tv. I figured as long as I was working and having fun it would be worth it. Although she works out in tennis shoes on the DVD I couldn't do the steps at home on carpet wearing shoes but I did fine in my socks.,1266451200,,612,3.6793893129770994

I feel this video is for someone who can commit to it every day & get the moves down.  Because I do a variety of workout routines, I only put this video in once or twice a week, & it will likely get shelved in the future.",1266364800,,506,3.7009345794392523

3949178,5,B002LSI1GY,"I am NOT a dancer, or even very coordinated to be honest.  However I love watching dancing with the stars and I like Julianne so I decided to try the dvd out.  I will admit, the first time I did it, I made it through the lesson, the warm up and about 2 mins of the cha-cha before throwing my hands up and deciding I couldn't do it.  I just wasn't able to learn the moves and keep up.  Then I decided to try it again today, and was able to keep up with the chacha, and most of the jive!  My heartbeat was jumping, and I was soaked with sweat, but I finished 2 out of 3 dances!  Needless to say, if I was being judged on technique I would be kicked to the curb in a heartbeat!  But I have no doubt with more practice I'll look less like I'm throwing a fit, and more like Julianne... I hope lol. Still can't conquer the pasedoble (however it's spelled), it's a little more technical, but I'll give it time.  So long story short, I'm sure people with dancing experience will have less problems with this workout, but even us uncoordinated klutz can learn it!!!",1265760000,2,1056,4.117073170731707

I don't regularly watch DWTS, but I thought since she was so famous for being a dancer from there, that I'd get this video.
Best choice I ever made.

I feel healthier than ever, and I really do enjoy this workout.
It always makes me tired, but the best part is that you can just pause, drink some water, and resume the video!

I am now getting more ""well-sculpted"", and having fun while I'm at it.

I'm the least coordinated person ever, and sure, I may not be doing all the moves perfectly, but this is a workout video, and i'm burning tons of calories (the results are already showing!) and feeling super well.

Julianne is such a pleasant workout video host, and she's very inspiring!

I don't consider myself to be uncoordinated, and have never really had a problem following a routine, but this one didn't work for me.

3949187,2,B002LSI1GY,"When I first told my mom I had this DVD, she was eager to try it out. After using it a few times, I was really unnerved about passing it onto her - in my opinion, this is not a DVD for the untrained dancer, and it's also not for the casual fan of Dancing with the Stars. To Julianne's credit, this is definitely a great cardio workout - it will get you drenched it sweat by the mid-point and is easily the best cardio workout I've gotten from a dance DVD.

The weaknesses of this DVD are twofold. The first is the fact the moves are actually pretty complicated. Some people might disagree with me, but I'm not a trained dancer and I find myself flailing through about 50% of the moves, even after taking the mini private dancing segment, where Julianne focuses in on a few of the more challenging moves. When you 'get' the moves, it's fun, but if you don't, you're just kind of shuffling about aimlessly. I strongly recommend the private dancing lesson before you attempt the actual workout. In both the private lesson and the actual routine, you'll do all of the moves at half-speed before picking them up into a rapid fire pace...I can do the half-speed, but not the full-blown pace on certain moves.

Along with the assumption that you've taken the mini-lesson and are keeping up with the dancing, there's also not a lot of focus on form - I found myself pretty sore in some spots after doing this workout, particularly in my back, because there wasn't too much instruction as to the potential physical dangers of certain moves, instead the focus is on the actual dance elements of the move.

The second issue with the DVD is that it's literally just one routine, and the mini-lesson. It's about 55 minutes long including a warm-up and cool-down, and to be fair it incorporates three quite different dances, but realistically you're not going to want to do this DVD on a daily basis to get in shape. It's a big daily time commitment, and you'll get bored or frustrated fast. It might provide some nice variation as part of a larger workout program, but I think there are less challenging and equally effective cardio dance DVDs on the market.

As for Julianne? She's not a bad instructor...a little on the cheesy side, with a skew towards encouragement for a younger audience on how you can 'use this move in the club', but chances are you've bought this DVD because you were a fan of her sunshiney personality on Dancing with the Stars.

Overall I probably wouldn't recommend this DVD to the majority of people out there. It's fun when you've got the hang of it, but it's a steep challenge - more technically than physically - to get there.",1265068800,4,2644,4.523012552301255
3949188,5,B002LSI1GY,"Ok - so I've always loved to dance and my husband and I met because we both love Latin dancing.  I have had 2 babies in the last three years and to say the least, I am not really fit presently (like 30+ lbs heavier than before the babies)... Anyway, my point is that I'm not a marathon runner and I LOVED this video.  It totally kicked my butt the first time, but I am inspired to do it better tomorrow.  It was fun enough to make me want to do it again tomorrow too!  It wasn't easy, but it's not as bad as some of the reviews say.  If you have rhythm, and dancing is fun for you, I think you'll like it.  Julianne is GREAT.  Not the best cued I'll admit, but it's not really about getting every step perfect, it's about dancing your a$$ off, literally, right? Also, even if you can't always see Julianne's feet and arms, in most shots you can at least see one of her backup dancers which also helps. Verdict after only one go: Love it, love it, love it and can't wait for day 2!!",1264982400,,981,4.025773195876289
3949189,1,B002LSI1GY,"I have been exercising, via the gym and at-home exercises videos, for years and this is the first at-home DVD I have been disappointed with.  While Julianne is an upbeat instructor, she's not the best instructor.  I'm a fast learner and always pick up anything new pretty fast, but this was a challenge for me.  After struggling through the first 20 minutes of the tape, I stopped it and went through her ""private dance lesson"".  I got the first part, but as we moved on it became confusing again.  Furthermore, most aerobics instructors mirror what you're doing, so it's easier to follow.  Julianne does not always mirror you and sometimes switches sides, which confused me and threw me off.  I have bought dance videos before and they took a little time getting used to and I will give this one a few more tries, but I really feel that there are better dance DVD's out there.  Anyone who is an instructor for a dance workout needs to break the workout down more and not assume that everyone knows what they're talking about.  I also was not thrilled with the music selection.  I wish I could have previewed this DVD before buying it because I doubt it will be used much by me anymore.",1264982400,14,1186,4.525821596244131
3949190,4,B002LSI1GY,"I just tried this workout today.  I have many years of dance training, but none in ballroom, so the average cardio DVD bores me out of my mind.  This one is above average!  Julianne is a beautiful dancer, has a nice sense of humor instead of being plastic-fake/soothing/obnoxiously perky, and the routines build well (learn a step, add next step, go back, learn next step, repeat the whole combination, etc.)  She actually lets you hear her get a little out of breath (though obviously she is in amazing shape, it still makes her that much easier to relate to).

I think you have to use this DVD the right way, though.  I highly recommend viewing the Private Dance Lesson segment first.  During the main workout, the camera often focuses on Julianne from the hips up, not helpful for a full-body dance workout!  (and why do almost no dance workout video producers get this right?!)  In the Private Lesson, you see Julianne from head to toes as she gives more specific info about where to place your weight, which muscles to use to power various moves/shapes, and footwork, which would be essential for those not yet familiar with chasse', step ball change, and so on.  If the camera work were better, and if she also gave some information on protecting oneself from injury while doing these moves -- such as not hyperextending the lower back on hip circles, or locking back the knees on the cha cha and paso-- I'd give the DVD five stars.",1264809600,3,1438,4.625984251968504

1.  julianne is super cute, has an amazing body, and is very motivating/adorable.

3.  i was drenched with sweat... a very good workout.

there are also some negatives...

1.  i'm very challenged when it comes to dancing.  this video is NOT for beginners.  i sucked so bad at all the moves and felt very unmotivated.
2.  unless you're already kind of in shape, you won't be able to do this.  and the bodies of the dancers will make you feel like #$@#.
2.  i've done it twice and still can't do any of the moves.
3.  there are only 3 small routines... i wish there were more because i might be getting bored...

the reason i gave 4 stars was because i was just as sweaty and winded as i was when i did Jillian Michaels' ""Banish Fat Boost Metabolism"".  and Cardio Ballroom was a hell of a lot more fun then that... the time flies by.  anybody know any easier dance workout vids?",1264723200,3,958,4.268156424581005

3949194,3,B002LSI1GY,"Okay - i love dancing.  I have an average background in dancing.  But this is not a workout video.  It is a dance video.  Which is fine.... like i said, i love dancing, and yes - dancing is a workout. But if you have never really formally danced, or have no ability to dance - this is not for you.  The 'instructions' / 'lessons' are brief & there is little time to get the 'steps' right and would be frustrating for an inexperienced dancer.  Plus the commentating from Julianne is average at best, she is a talented choreographer, not a video host.

Overall, a decent and fun dance video.  Aside from all the silly 'WOOO!'s from Julianne, and being forced to stare at her distracting long, fake hair - it's a keeper for dancing queens.

For normal girls like me, i currently really like the Pilates for Dummies video.",1264636800,3,818,4.436241610738255

Julianne is sweet and fun to watch and surprisingly easy to learn from. now it will take a few times to get the moves down(definitely check out the tutorial first) but it's fun to learn and you will still get in a good workout. i mean the point of this is to have fun and burn some calories not to become a professional dancer. so i wouldn't worry if you don't dance like Julianne because she is a pro and this is a workout dvd not private ballroom lessons(which by the way would take several lessons before you could get a routine down#. plus you got something to work up to and it will keep you coming back for more. i would recommend this to any fitness level and any level of dance experience (the moves really aren't all that complicated and you can add in your own flair or modification. i mean you're at home not performing in a recital). typical ballroom music but the production is very well done and julianne looks great (perfect dancer body). honestly, if i can do this workout anybody can!!!!",1264464000,,1415,4.303370786516854

3949198,5,B002LSI1GY,"Let me start by saying the two things I like most about Jullian's work out is the WARM Up and the COOL Down! 1) She offers you a REAL warm up that's going to actually prepare you for the work out your about to receive! 2) The Cool down is great too! It's a cool down that you deserve after the work out you just endured! She gives great stretches that she holds for longer than 2 seconds like some DVD's! Very refreshing and soothing!

The work out itself is amazing! It is a bit of a challenge especially if youv'e never done ballroom type dancing! More on the intermediate advance dancer level than beginner for sure! But  like another reviewer said, I look at it as a interesting challenge that I strive for! My goal is to get the steps as well as the timing, because lets face it.. I'm not as quick as they are! But with time and practice I can tell after doing the work out a couple of times that I can get there! That's one way you can look at it! Don't just give up and say this is more than I can handle... strive to get the moves and loose some weight! It's what we all beg for! We want it so let's work for it! look at the weight that some of the celeberity dancers loose from the practices and dances! We can too!

My only con about this DVD which has nothing to do with Jullian but with the technical team! Like another review said, is the camera! There's too many parts in the work out where they aren't showing her legs and feet but her FACE! It took me forever to finally get this one step where she's actually moving back by taking drag steps because I couldn't see what the hell she was doing and had to guess!

I have danced all my life, so many of these steps were not new to me, and even so it's going to take me a couple times to get the dances down pat. I still think it's a great workout - because even though I didn't do it perfectly, I still managed to work up a great sweat, be dog tired, and sore afterward. She moves quickly, as if in a competition class so this might be hard for beginners. If you are new to dance, I would reccomend watching the dance lesson first, since it goes over a couple of the steps that might be more challenging. This dvd is a blast. I think everyone should try it.",1264291200,,699,4.0
3949200,2,B002LSI1GY,"Oh I was so hoping this would be a fun and instructive video. It is apparent from her success on ""Dancing with the Stars"" that Julianne is a very good teacher. She utilizes little of that skill set here. The video contains a private lesson section that is rudimentary at best. The main part of the video is dedicated to following Julianne through a set of dance moves. The viewer is encouraged to follow what Julianne is doing (never mind how she is doing it), combine one move with the next and finally coordinate the movements and add your own embellishments. Basic instruction is minimal, safety concerns are nonexistent and coordination is assumed.

I don't think I have ever had an instructor who taught a skill while facing the class members. I assume the producers wanted us to be able to see Julianne's beautiful face - fine, make one of the other (also quite lovely) girls turn around so we can watch her. For that matter make one of them do the movements at the beginner level so we have a shot at actually learning the dance moves.

A good video for those with a background in ballroom dance, not helpful, or particularly safe, for the rest of us.",1264118400,2,1158,4.535885167464115

The shots are in and out so, when you're trying to follow her, you get lost b/c they cut into her face or her flipping her hair that you lose your steps.  I have taken dance lessons before so, some of the steps I knew but even then, I found it to be very hard to follow and not much of a work out.",1263945600,31,569,3.677685950413223
3949203,4,B002LSI1GY,"I absolutely love this workout! It defintely burns calories, works up a sweat, and you learn some cool ballroom dance moves in the process. The workout begins with a warm up, then goes into the cha cha, jive, paso doble and cool down (for a total of about 43 mins). Each segment is a dance routine that you repeat over and over again. Believe me, it is difficult to do a jive dance routine 5 times in a row (and that's after learning it!). I was definitely out of breath. I danced for most of my life so I got into the swing of things easily. It helps that she progressively adds steps to the routine (say she starts with moving just the arms, then the legs and arms, then the entire step, etc. until you are doing the entire routine if that makes sense) but the reason I gave this 4 stars is because this workout is NOT for beginners. I would say one would need to practice this video over and over again before you begin to feel comfortable to the point where you can get a good sweat from the workout. Her dance lessons definitely help but there is a difference between doing the steps in a dance lesson and then doing the steps quickly in the dance workout.

3949204,3,B002LSI1GY,"Disclaimer - I have a heavy background in jazz and ballet dancing.

She basically teaches you three combinations - Cha-Cha, Jive, & Paso Doble.

I'm worried that after 3 or 4 times (I've only done it once), I will get bored because I'll already know the combo, and she teaches it one 8-count at a time. You repeat the 8-count several times in a row, she adds on another 8 count, then you put it together. Some of the moves require a lot of coordination!

It's fun to learn and practice some of the social dancing moves you see on ""Dancing with the Stars"", and she certainly has a body that motivates you to work out and try to look like her. But honestly, this did not get me sweating enough to be worth the 40 minutes. After 40 minutes of working out, I should be sweaty and sore. That didn't happen. However, this would be a great beginner workout for someone with good coordination but is out of shape. Too bad, because she was my favorite on the show.",1263772800,5,955,4.294444444444444

3949206,2,B002LSI1GY,"I bought this video bc ive been trying to lose the last 20 lbs of baby weight. I love Dancing with the Stars and thought this would be a fun workout, but this DVD is just a little too hard to follow to get a good cardio workout. Julianne does the moves much too fast and doesnt take the time to explain them thouroughly. Even with the personal lesson feature, she only goes over a couple steps for each dance. I spent too much time trying to figure out the moves she was doing and had to keep stopping. Maybe if I can keep with it and eventually learn the moves, it will be a better workout when i can do the full dance. But i don't see that happening for awhile. So if you're looking for a good workout, NOW, i recommend buying the Jillian Michaels 30 day shred instead. I bought it also, and its amazing. It was easy to do but challenging enough, she explained every position and form, and Jiliian was so motivating that i didn't want to quit. Also in the dance dvd, Julianne teaches the dance moves facing you, which for me makes it harder to follow bc shes doing it opppsite. I learn better if we are facing the same way and i can copycat her. Ive watched many dance classes and the teacher usually teaches that way rather than facing the class. I love Julianne and she has an amazing body, which is about the only good thing about this video. If anything, her body will inspire you.

Julianne-God bless your little soul for trying, but next time remember that we are not professional dancers. Do your research next time, and make sure its stuff the people can follow easily.

Saw Dance with Julianne in the store yesterday and picked it up thinking it might be a nice little fun thing to do on the days when I still need to work out, but don't really feel like it. I so heart Julianne on Dancing with Stars -- I was excited to get it if just for that reason.

HO-LY Crap.

I just finished it for the first time -- You could say I was at best marking the moves since I was learning the choreography for the first time, but I'm still soaked in sweat from head to toe and feeling the workout ALL OVER.  AND it was fun!! You hear instructors always saying, ""Do this workout, it's fun!"" but I mean, come on... really? This really is!! I can see how the better you know the choreography, the more fun it would get, and I can't wait to try again tomorrow!

This thing is freaking awesome. I'm thinking Julianne could give Tony Horton a run for his money.",1263513600,25,991,4.092783505154639
3949208,3,B002LSI1GY,"I have never done ballroom dancing but have dance experience, I have taught Irish Step Dancing.  I found this video extremely challenging.  This is not a beginner's dance video.  I have watched the personal instruction and I am still struggling  I find I spend lots of time just walking in place because I can't get the moves right.  I will keep trying and post how long it takes for me to get it.",1263427200,3,397,4.383561643835616
3949209,4,B002LSI1GY,"I have many dance workout DVDs, and this is by far the best one that I own.  It isn't plagued by all the problems that typical dance videos have (boring instructors, ineffective workouts, etc.)  Julianne is very engaging, motivating, and fun.  And the routines are great exercise.  I even found the warm-up and cool-down portions to be effective and much different from what you usually get on these types of DVDs.

Pros:
- The workout is fun.  It's one of the only ones I do where I am not constantly checking the time to see how much longer I have to torture myself.

- Most of the steps are real dance steps, so if your goal is not only to get in shape but also to learn Latin ballroom dance steps, you'll love this video.  Julianne doesn't turn everything into dance aerobics moves that you do 50 times and then you're done.  She teaches real moves that you've seen on Dancing with the Stars countless times.

- She puts the steps into actual dance routines that flow from one move to the next.  She doesn't just take a few basic steps like mambo breaks or grapevines, do each one 3 or 4 times, and call that a ""routine.""

- She has one of the backup dancers demonstrate some modifications of her moves that may be easier for people who have bad knees or are really out of shape and can't do everything exactly the way Julianne does it.

Cons:
- Julianne's ""personal dance lesson"" doesn't go through all of the steps, and some of the moves not included in the lesson are difficult to pick up on without rewinding a lot or playing in slow motion.  I know it will take a lot of practice to get these steps down regardless of how well she breaks them down, but I just feel like if you're going to add a section to the DVD where you explain how to do specific steps, you could explain a lot more of them than she does.

- The camerawork is not the best I've ever seen.  It frequently will show only Julianne's face, and that's not what you need to see to be able to pick up the steps.  At other times, it only shows her hips or the top half of her body so you can't really see what her feet and legs are doing.  I'm a bit of a perfectionist, and I want to learn how to do the moves correctly from top to bottom.  The camera angles make that difficult sometimes.

- The individual dance routines (cha cha, jive, paso doble) are grouped together so you can do the entire workout without having to manually switch from one dance to the next, and they are also available in separate chapters if you only want to do one at a time.  But the warm-up and cool-down portions are only available if you choose to play the entire workout.  That makes it more of a pain to try to do the warm-up and cool-down with just one or two of the routines when you don't have time to do the entire workout.

Overall, this DVD is more than worth the money.  It has its flaws, but it is MUCH better than any other Latin cardio DVD that I've tried.  You will come away feeling like you got a great workout, and the dances are so fun that I actually want to keep going even after I've finished my workout.  If you liked Julianne on DWTS, you will really enjoy this workout.",1263427200,9,3146,4.219063545150502
3949210,4,B002LSI1GY,"I bought this because I wanted something that I could do at home on the days that I didn't feel like getting around and going to the gym.  I've used work out dvds like P90X before for a VERY short while because it was a little too intense for me.  I wasn't looking to kill myself every time I wanted to workout.  I've never used a dance themed work out dvd though, but have always wanted to try it because, as others have said, you don't think about the fact that you're actually working out and getting exercise because you're DANCING!  Although, I still will be going to my gym to work out, I will definitely be incorporating this into my regime for the simple fact that it is fun, provides a workout at home and I sweat  WAY more in 38 minutes of ""Cardio Ballroom"" than I do in 38 minutes on the treadmill or elliptical!  So, I would suggest buying it!",1263340800,,855,4.214723926380368
3949211,5,B002LSI1GY,"I just purchased this DVD yesterday, and I couldn't wait to try it! I popped it in as soon as I got home, and let me tell you, it was a great workout! I have been slacking on exercising for YEARS now, and one of my resolutions for 2010 was to get in shape! I absolutely LOVE to dance, and I love watching Dancing with the Stars. Now, some of the steps are a little difficult to pick up on at first, but she repeats them a good bit till you get the hang of it. She is so cute and motivating. I actually had to stop to take a breather in the middle of the paso, but I made it through! I can't wait to keep doing it, so I can get more comfortable with the choreography. Oh, the JIVE was sooo much FUN!! I actually found myself smiling and chuckling while I was sweating like a pig. Haha! What exercise DVD makes you do that?! I definitely recommend this DVD for those that love to dance. Have fun! :o)",1263254400,,898,3.9668508287292816
3949212,5,B002LSI1GY,I love this workout! It was not easy at first. This is definitely a workout for those with some ballroom dance background. The private lesson is a must and should be practiced a few times before the cardio workout as it will be extremely fast in the workout. The level of this cardio workout definitely challenges me to perfect my moves! It'll be great if you can see yourself in the mirror while you follow her instructions to see if you really get it. I love how I can lose some calories while learning some sexy cool moves that I can use in a social dance party (and my boyfriend loves them too)!,1263081600,,599,4.3097345132743365
3949213,5,B002LSI1GY,"I had never done any videos on my own, least of all dance videos, so I was a little hesitant at all. I also have zero formal dance experience. Also, I rarely comment on products I buy, even if I like them. Finally, while I am not large, I have not worked out regularly in awhile and was scared I would fail. Once this got started, however, I knew instantly that I was a fan and that I had to share it with others. In fact, my roommate, who was at first not interested in doing it stood around watching and doing it in her jeans until she could not stand it and changed into some workout clothes to join me--I ended up doing the video for 2 hours and didn't even realize it! Okay, to the video: Julianne is perky and adorable, like a sweet friend. She is encouraging, but not demeaning or pretentious, speaking to you like the adult you are, which I found to be very important. This helps because 1) you do not mind listening to her, and 2) I can see the longevity of the video because I won't get bored or annoyed at her telling me step-by-step each time. This has some disadvantages, I can imagine, if you absolutely must have counting and verrry slow step by step approach--I like to just get into the nitty gritty, so to speak. Even with the practice, it was a bit difficult to pick up, but I don't think it will take long, and is more fun and challenging this way. The three dances she teaches, the cha cha, jive and paso are a ton of fun, and the music is great. I was thinking after we got good at this video we could even change it up and turn on our own latin music later. BTW, the jive is a killer workout, and gives you great cardio! So the conclusion: 1) Julianne is a great easygoing instructor 2) the moves are challenging and potentially complicated for beginners, but because they are difficult to learn and pick up, the video has greater longevity 3) the dances are a workout and you will sweat a lot 4) the dances are so fun you won't even realize you're working out! If anyone fails to sweat or feel their body work doing this video, I do not believe they are really trying, doing the moves correctly or generally putting energy into it. I highly recommend this video. You will sweat, but you will have fun!",1262822400,30,2225,4.237647058823529
3949214,5,B002LSI1GY,"Julianne Hough choreographed some amazing routines when she was on ""Dancing with the Stars"", and she hasn't stopped doing that for her fitness DVD.  The routines are not only fun and cardio, but they are real routines, as well.  The segments on the DVD are:

Warm Up-This pretty much tells you that the routine isn't going to be slow.  The warm up features very fast plies to start with, and it continues on with some contractions, roll-downs, a cabbage patch dance step, and more.  It lasts about 5 1/2 minutes.

Cha-Cha-This is a very Latin dance, and although it is my least favorite, it is still a great routine.  It starts with a twisting step, then it goes to a syncopated step, next is a chest pumping step, and last is a hip roll and shimmy.  All in all it is four 8-counts, and it lasts about 10 minutes.

Jive-This is the fastest and will really test your cardio ability.  Julianne just jumps right in doing the first step slowly once, then picking it up to speed which is REALLY fast.  The first step is full of kicks, next is a kick kick ball-change step, next is a jump forward with a clap, after that comes a chase forward, and last is the twist and hustle.  It is, once again, four 8-counts, and it last about 12 minutes.

Paso Doble-This is a very powerful dance, and you need to keep the moves firm and not be flimsy.  Once again, there are four 8-counts, and this is my favorite routine of them all.  The routine starts with a cape step (no cape required, it is just arms), then it moves to a roll down and roll up, next is a popping step from side to side with the hips, and last is a step called ""the kill"" which requires you to jump out, jump in, turn around, and repeat.  It's a lot of fun and really cardio.  This lasts about 11 minutes.

Cool Down-Julianne relaxes you with some inhales, hip movements, roll downs, and a few stretches.  She doesn't stretch all muscles, but she does stretch quite a few.  It lasts about 5 1/2 minutes.

Bonus Dance Lesson-Julianne breaks down some (not all) of the moves from the dances.  It didn't help me learn the steps faster, but it did help me improve my technique not only for this DVD but for all of my dancing in these styles.

There is also an interview and the credits on this DVD.  Now, the moves aren't really broken down, so I don't really think that a beginner should try this.  I recommend it  more to intermediate/advanced exercisers who have some (even if it's just basic) background in dance.  Let me warn you, Julianne doesn't count at all.  She just says, basically, ""Go!"", and that's when you start the move.  She also yells at the camera (not in an unfriendly way, she is VERY nice, motivating, and friendly, but she doesn't just talk to the camera, she yells) so you might find yourself turning the volume down a little bit.  The songs are really nice, in my opinion.  They aren't just these techno songs you hear in most workout videos, instead they are really nice and fit each dance style well.  All in all, I recommend this DVD to anyone.  Julianne does tell the viewer twice that they are a strong woman, but if men can just ignore this, they will like the DVD just as much.  I think it is worth the money, and I highly recommend it.",1262736000,18,3219,4.354621848739495
3949215,5,B002LSI1GY,"Do this in the A.M., and you're sure to have plenty of energy all day! Julianne is a really high energy person, and like the video states, her energy is infectious! That's the great part about this video. Another advantage this video has over many DVD's is that the moves aren't too too difficult. There might be a few that are difficult to manuveur, or a couple of moves that are hard on the knees or back, but not too many, and they can be modified.
The thing I don't like about this video is Julianne's voice! Now I know she can't really help how she sounds, but in many areas she yells, and that child-like voice grates on my nerves, PLUS it almost echos because of the studio they're working out in.
All in all it's a good fun workout, with some minor irritations.",1262649600,,769,4.310344827586207
3949216,5,B002LSI1GY,"As someone who has a crazy collection of fitness DVD's but geared more toward toning/weights, pilates, Biggest Loser Yoga and those Jillian workouts, tai chi, etc, when I first heard of this DVD I wasn't sure whether it would be my particular cup of tea and didn't give it too much thought.

HOWEVER, as I never purchase or consider anything anymore without first checking out the reviews on Amazon.com and usually let those tell me whether or not I might want to give something a whirl, upon ""reviewing the reviews"" and seeing this had garnered some decent feedback I decided to step out of my comfort zone and see for myself.  So very glad I did!

Julianne Hough makes this DVD fun - but challenging!  I work out pretty regularly and this made me sweat.  Really sweat.  And yes, after initially not doing so I did go back and followed the other reviewers suggestions that it might be worthwhile/helpful to check out the ""private"" session first.

Overall, a fantastic DVD - certainly one to add to my collection and I am very happy to do so ;)",1262476800,9,1044,4.550802139037433

3949218,5,B002LSI1GY,"What a great work out video! For a non-dancer like me, the personal instruction was broken down nicely and very helpful.  Julianne is very clear with instructions and gives enough practice throughout the workout that all levels of dancers may appreciate - enough to grasp the step for the beginner and refine the step for more advanced.  I didn't get everything right this first time ... however I am confident that because of how Julianne teaches that everything will come with time.  Love her contagious energy and smile!

3949220,4,B002LSI1GY,"I've owned a lot of workout videos over the years and this is definitely one of the best.  It's different, fun, and Julianne has a great personality that keeps you going even when it gets tough -- and YES, it's tough!  I tend to stay away from cardio videos since my coordination is pretty awful, but even so I had to give this a try (big fan of DWTS).  On one hand I didn't trip or fall (!), but on the other I was incredibly flustered at times, particularly during the jive.  I just can't move that fast!  I can't blame Julianne, though, and overall she's got a great product here.  She could have a successful career as a fitness instructor.  I would certainly purchase any workout video she releases in the future.

I should mention that some of the moves are a little difficult to do in sneakers while on the carpet.  Your feet simply cannot slide the way hers do on the hardwood.  I do this video without shoes so my feet can move freely.  Kind of annoying, but again, not Julianne's fault.",1262217600,6,996,4.3297297297297295
3949221,4,B002LSI1GY,"I was so excited when I saw that Julianne had a Dance DVD out and so I bought it.  I have to say I had a fun time dancing with her, but, this could have been done better.  I own other Dance DVDs and they have better instructions than she does.  Core Rhythms is better at explaining and slowly walking through the moves so you feel comfortable doing them and then they speed up the motion.  The instruction part shouldn't be seperate on the video it should be part of the workout.  She only does a quick show and then it's on to the movement.  I felt clumsy and that was not good.  I do have to say that I am ""drenched"" just like the reviews said I would.  My heart rate was up, and she really is so cute and makes you smile.  So get ready, pay close attention and have fun swaying your hips!!",1261612800,8,792,4.0256410256410255

Worth every penny.  I can't wait for her next dvd.  This is how is done.  Thank you Julianne.",1261612800,2,167,4.466666666666667
3949223,5,B002LSI1GY,"I really like Julianne and was very excited to see that this dvd was coming out. I have absolutely no dance experience other then other workout dvds with 'dance inspired' moves. I can say that this is really fun to do and she does a really good job at breaking things down so you can understand. It will def. take some practice for me to get through the three dances seamlessly, but I think someone with experience would have an easier time. The cha cha is really fun to learn and I think the addition of her ""Private Lesson"" section really does help with technique. I did that part first and then went through the rest of the dvd. When I felt I wasn't getting things right, I went back to the lesson and sure enough it made a difference when I went through the routine again. I like her teaching style. She isn't overly chatty and cheesy which is great. I don't want an instructor to be my cheerleader, I want them to show me how to do a workout. She does a good job of breaking things down and repeats things so you get a chance to get it down. Sometimes I think its pace is a little fast for a beginner, but I just rewind the section and do it over until I am comfortable with it. It got my heart rate up and I was breaking a sweat which was great, and I was sore the next day after doing it too! I do think the addition of the dance lesson is one of the best parts of the whole dvd, it does make a difference in your workout and although it is only 12 minutes, she gives you a few tips to get the moves right for each of the 3 dance routines. The dance routines are 48 minutes long and the dance lesson is 12. I really hope she puts another dvd out, she is a great instructor and this is a fun way to get a cardio workout in at home and to tone up at the same time.

As someone with ZERO dance experience, who is COMPLETELY out of shape, I can say that it was hard at first for me to pick up the choreography and finish the entire dances, but Julianne is a great teacher.  She makes it easy to learn, truly fun, and made me want to finish all the dances, which I did (with some breaks tossed in).  I had a smile on my face the entire time and I can't wait to do it again.  This is a complete body workout and hours later, I can still feel it all over, which is great.

But it got to the point where I barely broke a sweat and I was a bit bored with the moves. With this workout, I broke a sweat just doing the Personal Lesson included with this DVD. If you're new to dance (like me), definitely start with the 10-minute Personal Lesson, then move on to the 3 main routines (Chacha, Jive and Paso Doble), each of which is about 15-minutes long and can be done on their own. Doing all 3 is definitely a cardio challenge but so much fun! There's also a warm-up and cool-down, which is awesome.

Of course, I will still do my Denise and Leslie workouts, but on days when I really want to pump up the sweat, this Julianne ballroom workout will be my pick!",1518393600,,791,4.308724832214765
