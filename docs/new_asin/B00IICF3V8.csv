6264632,5,B00IICF3V8,"You did a good job. You got a really good story line that made a really cool movie. Outdoors, hunting, bad guys, moving to wilderness, and gold with greed mixed in. That's got Hollywood all over it. Let them take it to the next level isn't that what Sylvester Stalon did? Good luck.",1393372800,2,282,4.339622641509434
6264633,5,B00IICF3V8,"I was tipped off by a friend that Paul Hemann, living in Alaska, wrote, directed and starred in a movie. This movie was a real pleasure to watch having known the Hemann family as I grew up. The movie is without a doubt Paul Hemann at his best: creative, strong, inspiring, educational and finding a way to touch the hand of God in a way that no one else could. Moreover, able to share the moment with others thru this spectacular film. I enjoyed the film throughout and was so happy to see his inclusion of his family in many different ways. The movie touched the lifelong memories of both Paul's growing up, his life experiences in Alaska and was woven into the entire fabric of the movie. I think that this will be a beginning of many great works to come. How lucky I am to know Paul Hemann and to be able to be one of the first to see the movie ""Sons of Jeremiah Johnson"". Good job Paul!!! - your parents are looking down from heaven smiling and proud. -- Jim S.",1393372800,,965,4.221621621621622
6264634,5,B00IICF3V8,"This movie is exquisite!  The cameraman has an incredible eye for portraying the beauty of the Alaska wilderness, and it's easy to get sucked into the story and forget about the passing of time.  The acting is top-notch as well, with Phillip Manning and David Nelson portraying criminal slimeballs so realistically, it's hard to believe that they aren't like that in real life.  Alex Napoka steals the show here, though, as Joshua's guide through the wild.  Just a magnificent effort from an up and coming director that is sure to give us some great things down the road.",1393286400,3,571,4.795918367346939
6264665,1,B00IICF3V8,"It's like a poor ""action"" (and I use that term loosely with this video) mixed with a touristy video.  It's basically the narrator talking throughout the video.  Short 30 sec video footage of different areas of Alaska.  It went from talking about moving to the wilderness of Alaska to strike a fortune in gold, to having kids, to his wife leaving him with 2 youngest of his 4 sons.  (non of which was actually in the movie) to him setting out on his own without any kids.  Where did they go, who was taking care of them, not explained.  I suggest watching it on mute just for the scenery.  I call Alaska home, but this was a poor attempt of a movie, playing off of a good movie Jeremiah Johnson.  Jeremiah Johnson wouldn't have left his kids.",1493596800,,741,4.357664233576642
6264666,1,B00IICF3V8,"Couldn't give negative stars.  WORST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN!  And I love B movies. Bait and switch on the Jeremiah Johnson name.  Horrible acting.  Painful dialogue.  The ""action"" scenes were laughable.  I feel robbed and I didn't even pay money for it. To list all the problems with this movie would be a further waste of my time. Don't waste yours. They should show this ""film"" to captured terrorists as a form of torture.  The director needs to ""be taken care of"" to quote the movie. It's hard to express how truly horrible this movie is. An angel dies every time this movie is watched. I have to stop now. My brain hurts just thinking about it.",1493078400,2,646,4.47008547008547

6264670,1,B00IICF3V8,If I could give this movie negative 20 stars I would.  The movie Jeremiah Johnson was a great movie and Paul Hemann used the good name to promote this piece of carp. The writers and producers of the movie Jeremiah Johnson should sue Paul Hemann for using the name. This was and is the WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN. The acting was horrible and the lead character should NEVER act again.,1490918400,,385,4.347222222222222
6264671,2,B00IICF3V8,Did you ever make a home movie when you were a kid? I'm willing to bet it was better than this movie. If not better then certainly more realistic. I gave it 2 stars only because it was shot in Alaska.,1490313600,,200,3.902439024390244
6264672,1,B00IICF3V8,"Scam !!!
Trying to ride the celebrity and success of the great 1972 film, Jeremiah Johnson with Robert Redford.
This video has NOTHING to do with that film, other than the name.
It's just plain bad.
The few short panoramic scenes of wild Alaska are the only good parts.

6264686,1,B00IICF3V8,Jeremiah Johnson ranks as one of my all time favorite movies. It was set sometime in the 1800s I think. This 'sequel' seams to bare so little resemblance that I just don't know where to start. Helicopters looking for JJ? WTF? I admit I stopped at that point as I could not stand to see the name of the original being so falsely used. However the idea for a real sequel to the original is tantalizing. Better be soon as Redford is 80 now. If RR had been consulted on this script he would have vomited or maybe he did.,1487548800,,516,4.17

6264690,1,B00IICF3V8,"The other negative reviews accurately sum it up. I don't generally write reviews, but this movie really irritated me. I love outdoors movies and even watch some that aren't all that good just because of the scenery and to observe people's survival skills. I couldn't finish this one. They have a lot of nerve playing off of the Jeremiah Johnson name in the title. The only thing they couldn't ruin was the beauty of Alaska (though it appears that they tried with the horrible camera work and lighting).

I think the goofy guy that wrote and acted in this movie obviously paid everyone he graduated from high school with, as well as his family and his one friend to write good reviews to boost the ratings.  They trick you with the title and make you think it is a real movie.  We watched for a bit because it is so bad it's funny but then couldn't take anymore of the horrible acting!

ALL of the positive comments seem to have been written by a small band of conspirators who probably had something to do with the creation of this scam in the first place. Read them yourself--they all say basically the same thing in a different way: ""Beautiful movie. Shows how gorgeous Alaska is. Well done. Perfect for the family. Good job, <Director's Name>."" I think the 5-6 people responsible for this ""movie"" got together and flooded Amazon with positive reviews, hoping suckers like me wouldn't look at the negative (read, ""actual"") reviews until it was too late.

6264870,5,B00IICF3V8,This movie is stripped of all the glitz and glam of modern day movies....you are left with a nice story accompanied by stellar scenery and good music. A nice throwback movie - great work.,1393718400,,187,4.529411764705882
6264871,5,B00IICF3V8,"In this hectic paced world, every once in awhile a movie like this comes around. The scenery which includes some unbelievably beautiful shots along with  great music was worth the entire movie. But then, you have a wonderful story about Jeremiah Johnson's sons who ultimately find out that the real meaning of life is not found in silver or gold but rather through the following of dreams and discovery of inner wealth which never passes away!! This is definitely worth a watch especially if you desire to enter a beautiful contemplative space.",1393632000,,544,4.913043478260869
6264872,5,B00IICF3V8,Was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the story as well the magnificent beauty of Alaska.

6264874,5,B00IICF3V8,"I was given the opportunity to watch for free so when it became available here I bought the DVD. It's a beautiful movie.
Well worth it.",1393372800,3,135,4.230769230769231
8642278,1,B00IICF3V8,Very poor and very insulting to Jeremiah Johnson.  Don't waste your time.  Watching Beavis and Butthead is much better than this.,1520121600,,129,5.095238095238095
8642279,1,B00IICF3V8,"Most low budget, poor acting movie I've ever seen. Nice scenery, but you can see that in a documentary. Don't waste your time watching.",1520121600,,135,4.666666666666667
8642280,1,B00IICF3V8,Accidentally rented this instead of the actual Jeremiah Johnson. Pretty Frustrating.,1518825600,,84,6.7272727272727275
8642281,3,B00IICF3V8,the scenic views are great and that was it.,1517961600,,43,3.888888888888889

It was absolutely stupid. Totally Jr. high quality... shoot from the hip script.",1517184000,,135,4.913043478260869
8642283,1,B00IICF3V8,Great intro.... then the acting started.  Just couldn't do it.  Tried for 20 minutes.  then fast forwarded to see if it was any less terrible.  No luck.  Great scenery.  Bad film.,1517184000,,179,4.612903225806452
8642284,1,B00IICF3V8,Really bad acting. Was this an attempt. to take advantage of the Jeremiah Johnson .name from the Redford movie of the 70's?,1515888000,,123,4.636363636363637
8642285,1,B00IICF3V8,the reviews for this movie are more entertaining ....i only lasted 10 minutes.....crap movie....on all levels....,1515283200,,113,6.125
8642286,1,B00IICF3V8,I made it 14 seconds. If anyone made it much further I assume you fell asleep or turned a gun on yourself...as this pos film continued to play.,1512864000,,143,4.142857142857143
8642287,2,B00IICF3V8,"This 'movie' is Cheesy at best. With a capital 'C'. I've seen several other of Paul Hemann's documentaries and they're pretty good. This movie has a lot of clips from those documentaries and well as stock footage of Alaska.

The acting is...well...kinda like a High School production. Which is what the whole show reminded me of.

Lots of things that make you go ""Hmmm."" Like the main character walking all over Alaska with a sack that supposedly contained everything he needed to survive in the wild. His clothes never changed although he was supposedly out there for several weeks.

In one scene he is chasing the bad guys and has a shotgun in his hand. Next scene he's still chasing bad guys, but no gun. Then scene after that, he has the gun again! Then there's the scene with him resting after losing the bad guys. He has split wood for a fire. Where did the hatchet come from? He didn't have it on him when he was chasing the bad guys! Then a few scenes later, no hatchet again!

Was it worth almost two hours of my time. Not really. I'm just glad I didn't have to pay for it!",1509840000,,1082,4.3681592039801
