5313042,1,B009B8YMOW,"I was a huge fan full moon, but the latest installment to the puppet master franchise confirms (again)that there best days are behind them.  I can't say how it ends I turned it off, it was that bad. I used to be religious about picking up all full moon movies as they became available. Now, I won't even rent one. Thanks for the memories.",1352764800,6,338,4.28125
5313043,1,B009B8YMOW,"The cover art is the only good thing about this film. Full Moon continues to milk its most successful franchise for every Redbox $1 it can. The puppets continue to look awful and nothing like the originals. Long gone is the stop motion animation, replaced with showing the puppets from the waist up and them nodding and making noises. The fight between the classic puppets and new puppets is the equivalent of throwing 2 barbie dolls at each other. The acting and sets were poor, along with a barely existent nonsensical storyline. Thankfully its short like the rest of the recent Full moon films. Expectations were very low, and is still severely disappointing. Charles may as well finish the prequel trilogy he started, then please put it to bed. Check out the recently released 'Evil Clergyman' for some old school Full Moon. There's more talent and skill in those 30 mins than the last four entries of the PM films...",1352419200,,921,4.7625
5313044,1,B009B8YMOW,This was a ok puppet master movie. The cons are... the acting. Its sooo bad its almost embarrassing to watch. The puppets never walk on there own. People move them. They just stand there. The nazi puppets were great. But they were hardly in it and didn't do much. Now killjoy goes to hell was great. Good acting. Good story. And big budget. Why didn't charles band put the time and budget into the puppet master x movie instead of killjoy 4 movie is beyond me. But puppet master x is better then the last three puppet master movies ill give it that. Overall id say the movie was good. But not great. And tom devlin does a terrible job amd should be fired as make up effects artist. God he sux. So please mr band. If your gonna make a puppet master movie don't half ass it and hype it up to be great when its not. Its just average. Your gonna lose fans of the series if you keep doing this. PUT TIME AND A LIL MORE MONEY(LIKE YOU DID IN KILLJOY 4) into your next puppet master movie or subspecies movie etc etc. Ps glad to see you used a real house in this movie. Unlike the crappy set that was built in puppet master 9 and alot of your other movies. PLEASE MAKE YOUR MOVIES LOOK LIKE KILLJOY GOES TO HELL. BEST FULLMOON MOVIE IN OVER A DECADE!,1351296000,4,1243,4.140495867768595
5313045,5,B009B8YMOW,"From a fans point of view, this film was Far superior from the previous one. I am NOT saying that the acting, puppeteering or the way it was shot was wrong in part 9 but, there was a certain ""f*** you and I dnt care what you think"" when Moebius was in the shot. And as far is it being the most horrible puppetmaster film of all of them. I strongly disagree... if you want to count other puppet master films of the franchise to this series...Dont!  I find it hard to believe some of the reviews here from October 16th, considering the from wasn't out till the 23rd. I am Not sure if it was someone who had a falling out with full moon or what. But please separate business and personal. Puppetmaster 3 is my favorite, I'm sure there were some continuity errors in this film. As a whole the film had a better balance of puppet interaction with humans. I do believe the Tooulon story should be expanded. This film was made not only for the fans but a new generation. If someone told me, ""I didn't believe the puppets because of the movements"" id simply say... at least its not CGI. CGI has corrupted the film industry, in the sense that its over used, Transformers is a great example. I do agree that stop motion should come back, but is very difficult and long process. I honestly have to say the Scott Anthony King brought a certain, ""Spunk"" to the film(aside from the puppets) over all, LOVED IT!",1351209600,2,1396,4.32824427480916
5313046,4,B009B8YMOW,"Easily the best entry in the Puppet Master franchise since part 5. The puppet effects are really good and a handful of new puppets are introduced as well. I highly recommend this film to any Full Moon fan, it's definitely worth the watch!",1351036800,,238,4.558139534883721
5313047,1,B009B8YMOW,"This movie is SUCH a disappointment, from the horrible actors to the horrible cheap-looking puppets. Where does Charles Band get these actors from, and the puppets???? Why make a movie with such stupid looking puppets? Go back to the original formula Charles Band! Stop making stupid movies and put a big enough budget into a Puppet Master movie!!!

5313048,2,B009B8YMOW,"""Puppet Master: Axis of Evil"" had a lot of potential but some shoddy acting and minimal puppet action kept the film from really taking off. It was, in any case, better than the last couple of installments in this series, but it forewarned of possible misery in future installments. Unfortunately, this new episode in the PM series fulfilled this prophecy of doom by being one of the worst of the bunch.

The story had potential - Danny and Beth, with puppets, set out to find the source of the Nazi occupation in America and rescue Tunneler. In the process, they uncover a Nazi plot to create undying soldiers and, ultimately, a series of Nazi-inspired puppets. The problem is that this film never gets past this idea stage. The acting is far worse in this film than in the previous, with Danny and Beth being the worst offenders. For all their faults, the previous actors were loads better than these two, who have the screen chemistry of oil and water. The other characters are vapid and one-note, which you expect from a Full Moon picture, but with such poor acting they inspire little attention from the audience. The only character to charm me was the Sarg, who was just hammy and stereotypical enough to make him endearing. The puppet work is just as pointless as it was in the last film, with minimal screen time for the puppets and fights that start and end so abruptly that I thought I'd fallen asleep and missed whole scenes (turns out I didn't miss anything, it was just horrible editing). The Nazi puppets have loads of potential, as the movie poster suggests, but never come close to living up to it. I've seen better animation in a toddler wielding an action figure.

While the last film was rife with plot holes and historical inaccuracies, this one was marred by poor editing and inept scripting. I wonder if they ever had more than one draft of this script. Lines contradict each other, make little sense, and scenes are dialogue heavy when it isn't necessary. It leaves you bored and wanting so much more.

The videozone, which should have brought back the old-school Full Moon feel, only serves to pound the stake further into the viewer's heart. The FX master, Tom Devlin, makes excuses as to why the puppetry was so bad in this film, making it sound like using rod control supplemented by CG instead of stop animation is an advancement in technical filmmaking instead of the set-back it truly is. At one point, he says ""We don't have the time for [stop-motion]"" which leaves one to wonder why they don't MAKE the time. Take longer to make the film, spend a bit more money, and you will see an exponential return as fans realize that they waited all this time for a quality product.

This is Full Moon's ultimate sin these days: spending tons of resources on the image to promote the movie but putting nothing into the production itself. This leaves viewers with a sense of something great coming into a product but a deflated sense of hope by the end credits. The animation on the logo for the videozone was more well done than the entire film itself. The poster is fantastic, but symbolizes a piece of trash not worthy of viewing.

I gave this film 2 stars because it had a ton of potential. I think it is better marked at 1-1/2 stars, but Amazon's ranking system doesn't allow for halves. I'm bummed by this outcome. I was so hoping this movie would live up to its potential but it never gets off the ground. It may have finally turned me against this company which I have followed for over 20 years.",1350345600,18,3523,4.576862123613312

5313071,1,B009B8YMOW,"Even without a clip show plot, demons, robotic limbs, or an overacting Corey Fieldman, this is sadly the worse entry in this series. The acting is worse than the previous film. The new puppets look awful and the old puppets don't look much better, Blade having the only decent portrayal. The two main characters are even more bland than they were in the previous film. There is some cringeworthy cg blood and gunshot scenes. The music isn't bad. Nothing spectacular but I wanted to have something positive to say about this movie. Somehow the 86 minute runtime seemed to take forever. Hopefully the third installment of this Axis trilogy is better.",1467763200,3,648,4.846846846846847

5313074,2,B009B8YMOW,"Following on the heels of the previous movie in the Puppet Master series, Axis Rising more or less beats to death every clich you can think of involving a Nazi plot to thwart Americas involvement in WWII.  The two hapless heroes from the previous movie, Danny & Beth, have no time to enjoy their brief victory as a new plot is afoot.  They must rescue Tunneler from the Nazi scourge actively seeking to create an unstoppable army of reactivated dead soldiers.

The characters are few.  The locations consist of a few rooms.  The characters move from a room in one place to a room in another place where they park themselves for awhile and yap about the problems at hand.  Except for a few stagey action sequences, the story is fairly static.  The puppets are mere decorations at this point, relegated to the background.  In spite of the advance technology in special effects, this bunch relies are rod-operated puppets with limited movement.  The puppets are now just extra special guest stars in their own series.  How ignominious.

This doomed project aches from its low-low budget look, its stale script, the nobody-actors playing horrible stereotypes.........its highly unimaginative and so cornball corny.  If they were trying to make a spoof of films of that era, they completely missed the point.",1455235200,,1303,4.926605504587156

5313105,3,B009B8YMOW,"Now with ten movies to its name (eleven, if you include the non-canonical&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/crossover/dp/B000BO0KOQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">crossover</a>), the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Puppet-Master/dp/B003L2YUEG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Puppet Master</a>&nbsp;series crawls over most other American horror franchises for sheer number of installments, trailing few in quantity. This is quite a feat for a series that's never seen the inside of a movie theater, has been retired twice, and has seriously declined in quality during the past fourteen years. ""Axis of Evil"" here sees the series slowly regaining some of its lost style, earning a passable rating and making me hopeful that inevitable future sequels might be better still.

The story: following the events of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/previous-film/dp/B003HI3B3A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">previous film</a>, Puppet Master Danny (Kip Canyon,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1313-Bermuda-Triangle/dp/B006WWTJ5C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1313: Bermuda Triangle</a>) and his girlfriend Beth (Jean O'Sullivan,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Party-like-the-Queen-of-France/dp/B0084YAYK0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Party like the Queen of France</a>) must reunite the separated Puppets and stop the plan of a nefarious Nazi commander (Scott King) to create an army of undead soldiers...or of deadly little Axis Puppets.

The previous film had plenty of things wrong with it, and while ""Axis Rising"" is far from perfect, it improves significantly via an influx of enthusiasm. The movie has a rolling pace which ensures that even the most boring scene isn't going to kill the mood for long, and while the all-new cast still won't win any awards for their acting, the significantly better screenplay by Shane Bitterling (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beneath-Loch-Ness/dp/B0000640VX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beneath Loch Ness</a>) directs their energy into some interesting and amusing situations rather than having the characters stand around and spout dopey dialogue. It's disappointing that the production values have noticeably slipped, so that every scene has that unrealistic stage drama feel to it, but like a proper stage show, the actors don't seem to mind and there's a general impression that the entire cast and crew are trying to make the most of limited resources.

The Puppets do fairly well. They've been given yet another makeover - the second in two movies - and look a little less impressive, but all of them see at least some action. The selling point of the film was the introduction of the Axis Puppets - a fairly interesting bunch diluted by a rather racist ""Kamikaze"" character and the fact that ""Bombshell's"" gag was already used to better effect in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Austin-Powers/dp/6304696221/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Austin Powers</a>. Nevertheless, the Puppets tend to do well when matched against opponents their own size, and while this is not quite as compelling as their battles with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Totem/dp/B0050UEVRS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Totem</a>&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Puppets/dp/B00ARWWRZW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Puppets</a>, the miniature battle royale is neat. Now if only we didn't need to wait until the last 30 minutes to see any substantial action...

There's no reason to think that Full Moon Features isn't cooking up the next installment to the series as I write this, and I am reasonably optimistic. If the company can remarry this movie's level of energy with stronger production values and possibly even a clever script, they would be within reach of recapturing the series' glory days from the late 80s and mid-90s. As a relatively new fan to this franchise, it's cool to see the series picking itself up and dusting itself off after so many disappointments. These are not the most enthusiastic three stars I have ever awarded, but the film nevertheless earns them well and is definitely worth an evening's watch. Rent it.",1413849600,4,4406,6.89068100358423

As a fan of the series who owns all ten movies, not include Puppet Master vs. Demonic Toys, I found this to be an extremely disappointing entry.

It has comedic value (which, is the only reason it got two stars), but really can't be taken seriously.  The acting is atrocious, the story line, like the rest of the series, is not at all consistent with any of the other movies, and the cliff hanger ending only means that we'll be waiting for yet another sequel that will undoubtedly veer into a completely different direction anyway, leaving this ending an eternal hanger.  Such is the plight of Puppet Master enthusiasts.  I'm still waiting for resolutions to the endings of Puppet Master 2, 7, and 8 (Puppet Master 6 isn't even worth the time).

That said, PM films are a guilty pleasure of mine.  So, I gave this one a shot, since it was a sequel to the prior 'axis' PM film.  Unfortunately, this one suffers from the same issues the first one did:  Very limited puppet screen time, 1 dimensional characters with limited development, plot holes that remind me of sinkholes you sees in the news lately...

5313150,5,B009B8YMOW,"Picking up right where Axis of Evil left off, Axis Rising continues the story of the current Puppet Master, Danny Coogan, as he continues his fight against the Nazis on US soil with the help of Blade, Tunneler, Pinhead and the rest of the gang.  Like Axis of Evil, Puppet Master X suffers from a lack of general puppet action.  The Nazis manage to create a host of evil puppets for our heroes to take on, including an awesome werewolf nazi puppet, but the battles are mostly left for the finale.  However, the story and characters are just as entertaining as the last film if not more, as Charles Band directs what is surely the series most ""out there' entry.
Even with limited screen time, the puppets themselves come up technically much better than they did in the last film.  While being controlled mostly with rods and wires, they still are able to have a lot of character show through.
The only thing that initially was a real turnoff for me was the casting.  Every character that was featured in Axis of Evil, including Danny Coogan, has been recast.  I bet it has something to do with the previous film shooting in China and this film shooting in LA, but it is disorienting at first and you have to spend awhile getting to know the same characters all over again.  This wasn't as big of a problem on second viewing, but the new cast isn't as genuine as the last cast.

5313154,4,B009B8YMOW,"I thought Axis Rising was a worthy addition to the franchise. Writer Shane Bitterling did a good job of balancing the storyline with his duty of showcasing a slew of puppets you don't want to mess with. Of course you shouldn't come to a straight-to-video horror expecting Peter Jackson effects, William Hurt-crafted acting and Fellini-esque dialogue, or even, as evidenced in the previous PM penned by August White, historical accuracy; you come for the guilty pleasure of watching cartoonish cage matches between bloodthirsty, magically animated puppets. Axis Rising delivers on this expectation, amid a human cast of apple-pie good guys, muah-hah-hahhhing bad guys, and a hilarious sendup of Sergeant Rock from actor Brad Potts in the character of, gee, Sergeant Stone. This is signature Charles Band/Full Moon entertainment, and longer than some at almost 90 minutes. The actors play up the World War II epic for all its worth, with strong turns from all and a cameo by burly Paul Arnold, who seems like a more approachable George C. Scott as General Porter. Also, Stephanie Sanditz gives a jaw-dropping performance as Uschi the Nazi siren, who in a Nazi Exploitation Film equivalent of Fantasy Football deserves to be joined with Dyanne Thorne. Watch it for that alone. But watch it anyway, if you dig the PM franchise.",1357084800,,1323,5.1013824884792625

5313157,3,B009B8YMOW,"I was admittedly hesitant to get this especially after Puppet Master IX: Axis of Evil, but being a fan of Puppet Master, I figured why not and decided to give it a whirl.

I can def say that this movie is better than its predecessor as it seems the budget went up...at least in terms of the costuming. The plot picks up where the last movie leaves off, the Japanese agents have captured one of the puppets and turn them over to their Nazi contacts operating in the US. The Nazi commander (Kommandant Moebius) proceeds to have the scientist under his command (Professor Freuhoffer) who is working on a ""resurrection machine"" begin to reverse engineer the puppet (in this case Tunneler) in the hopes that he may prove useful for the German war machine. Meanwhile our ""hero"" from the last film, Danny Coogan and his girlfriend Beth are on the hunt for Tunneler and out to stop the Nazi spies here in America before the cause another act of destruction.

The characters are average, Danny is still an emotional somewhat whiny character who is really in some ways forced to ""man up"" this time around b/c of his gf Beth and the loss of his friend in the last movie. The Nazis are just laughable, we of course have the megalomaniac SS Kommandant (Moebius) the ""Ilsa She Wolf of the SS"" style Uschi (Moebius' sexually frustrated mistress/confederate) who uses her wiles on the elderly Prof. Freuhoffer when she can't get her own way. She also serves as the inspiration for one of the new Axis inspired puppets...the aptly named Bombshell with machine guns in her bosom.

Speaking of the new Axis puppets, of which there are 4: Bombshell, inspired by Freuhoffers love/lust of her. Weremacht, a play on the German word for ""Armed Forces"" Wehrmacht, is a werewolf puppet. Kamikaze, a japanese puppet with a bundle of TNT strapped to his back, a watch in his chest and a detonator in his hand. And lastly, Blitzkrieg, half tank, half gas mask wearing robot with a machine gun for one arm and a tank's turret as the other.

Overall the new puppet designs are pretty cool looking i.e. the Axis puppets, unfortunately they never really get a lot of screen time and there is no epic showdown between the two. The Axis puppet with the most time on screen is Bombshell and that is only b/c she is created roughly halfway through the film.

As I said, this film is definitely an improvement over its predecessor though, not by a wide margin. The plot is certainly much more enjoyable, albeit a tad cliche with the Nazis working on some super secret machine that will win the war. The characters are enjoyable...though a tad disturbing with Uschi's overt advances at the much much older Freuhoffer. But if you enjoy Puppet Master as a series then I say this one is def worth a rental. If you're a diehard fan of the series, then you can add it to your collection, though I don't think this will be your favorite installment in the series.

We do however as a final note get to see the return of another one of the puppets though it is only at the end of the film, Six Shooter does come back for the final battle.

However there is one more thing I have to say about this movie and that is they blatantly leave it open for Puppet Master XI...I don't know if that is a good thing or a bad thing by this point.",1355097600,,3287,4.486622073578595
5313158,3,B009B8YMOW,"If you are already a fan of the Puppet Master series, you know that these movies are pretty hit or miss. They can be really great (like the first and third ones in the series) or pretty rotten (like Puppet Master Vs. Demonic Toys). The tenth installment sits pretty firmly in the middle of the pack, which isn't terrible for any movie that is a tenth film in a series.

I really enjoyed the addition of the new set of villain puppets, especially Bombshell. I wish we could have seen more of them and learned what they were all capable of doing. One of the puppets named Weremacht looks cool, but it is never fully revealed what his special ""power"" is other than looking like a werewolf. I especially enjoyed seeing the puppets we are already familiar with engaging in combat with the new villain puppets. Leech Woman and Bombshell getting into a cat fight was quite humorous.

As one would expect with a movie in the Puppet Master series, the best parts of the movies involved the puppets. Unfortunately they are probably only in a third of the movie (at least it felt that way watching it). When you did see them on camera, the puppets seemed to be mostly just observing the humans as they interacted with each other. They got into the action very infrequently, which hurt the movie.

The movie seemed to be trying to overly rely on the actors to deliver engaging performances that would distract you from the minimal puppet action. However, most of the actors and actresses were not impressive even by B-movie standards. The only performer that made any memorable impact was Stephanie Sanditz. She seemed to be enjoying herself on camera and embracing the innate campiness of being in a movie about killer puppets.

The movie's ending left open the possibility of an eleventh installment. I'm sure that I will want to buy that one too since I'm addicted to this silly little horror series. However, I hope to see the puppets on camera a lot more next time around. After all, they're the reason we watch these movies, not the human actors. I would also love to see this series take itself a little less seriously in the future. The Nazi storyline is pretty much played out at this point. I want to see how the puppets would interact with the 2013 world. I think Blade, Jester, Leech Woman, Pinhead, Tunneler, Six Shooter, Bombshell, and all the others deserve to live outside the WWII era for a while.",1354665600,8,2402,4.605140186915888
