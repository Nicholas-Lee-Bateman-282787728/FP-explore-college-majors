8404039,5,B003S5TOX8,"This movie is surprisingly good considering the ridiculous title. After seeing Billy the Kid versus Dracula and Jesse James Meets Frankenstein, I expected it to be awful, hardly scripted, and even worse acting, but... actually it's pretty good. The ""Bonnie and Clyde"" section could be a  satiric gangster movie all by itself. The ""Dracula"" section is slightly wacky and weird, with a bit of a Rocky Horror Picture Show quality. Anabel is a hoot!

Well-acted, with Bonnie the star of the show and Clyde not far behind, the irreverent tone of the script keeps this from being serious in spite of the violence portrayed. It's a B-movie with A-movie tongue-in-cheek acting. Dracula barely makes a ripple, the show belongs to the humans. It's entertaining all the way through.

This DVD was rented by the reviewer and no remuneration was involved in the writing of this review.",1453161600,,872,4.958904109589041
8404040,4,B003S5TOX8,"I originally caught this movie on the screambox channel on my roku. I must admit that at first I just couldn't bring myself to watch what I initially believed would be straight up cornball. I finally broke down and gave in simply because screambox kept shoving it in my face . So I finally gave in and guess what?  I loved this little gem. I can't say that anyone will find anything disturbing or even scary in this movie however this cross over genre is absolutely 100 minutes or more of pure fun. For an indie it's a wonderful period piece. Hollywood couldn't have done the sets and costumes any better with one exception, the brand new homes that they couldn't quite hide completely in the opening scenes even though they did try to concel them by shooting at a point in the road where some rather tall Hills almost did the trick, but really who cares?  Bonnie is meaner then mean and Clyde for a bad as_ gangster plays her calming counterpart to keep that mean bitc_ leveled. I'm not going to give away all spoilers but I found this movie fun, funny and entertaining. All the strange characters in Drac's and Dr. Loveless's lare as well as Bonnie and Clyde and their gangster friends are more than believable. Dacula himself (also played by a member of the friend family)  turned out to be one of the best I've seen onscreen in the old school style, with a velvet lined, long black cape and long black hair and fangs, however as another reviewer pointed out, of 100 minutes it takes about 85  just for Bonnie and Clyde to end up on the doorstep of Dr. Loveless looking to kidnap the evil Dr. to patch up one of the gang, by this point the entire weird mansion is already loaded with enough turned vampires to overtake an entire city in one night. So if your counting the minutes you realize by now that it takes less than 15 minutes for good old Bonnie and Clyde to fight their way out. How do they do this? Well unlike another crossover gangsters meet Dacula kind of movie, 'Dusk to Dawn' which had an absolute knock down, drag out fight for your frig'n blood and lives story, a movie that spawned two sequels and a tv series -in this one they did it with bullets, as another reviewer said, 'I guess vampires can be killed with bullets now',  disappointing because I would liked to have seen a good old fashioned monster brawl to the death while fighting their way out with pitchforks and stakes and hammers, crosses, knives, axes, sulghammers,  sunlight, the Bible, a couple of turned priests, holy water, fire, pickaxe, crossbows, (they used them in, 'Dusk to Dawn') all that good stuff,  blood everywhere and maybe even mean as mean Bonnie bitting the neck out of a few vampires herself or cutting some of their hearts out with her hidden straight razor that she so deftly uses in the beginning of the movie. I actually thought that her viciousness with the straight razor was a build up to an expected monster maul. This movie does introduce a new character in the comic book style of a human so pure of heart and innocent that vampires not only can't touch them but fear for their undead lives because of them. In this case played by another gorgeous young woman Jennifer Friend , I don't want to give away any more spoilers concerning her part  because as Annabella she is absolutely convergent and flawless moving from one face of her character to another, I found her not only fun but dazzling to watch, when an entire hallway full of vampires first spot her and begin moving towards her then realize what she is,  they part like the Red Sea and let her walk right through them right down the center of the hallway. I think that it's a dynamic character to introduce into the vampire myth and should be kept for all future vampire movies. Come on, we've worked Van Helzing 10 ways to Sunday he's old and done. Dracula is evil incarnate so why not level the playing field with a new character that is innocent and purity incarnate. I could smell a possible sequel if they revised Anabells role, really we don't know if all the vampires were dead when Bonnie and Clyde walked out of that Mansion (Anabells mansion now that her brother is dead) why should she just walk off into the sunset and leave her birthright behind and a fortune? A sequel, wishful thinking but I thought I'd throw it out there just in case the Friends family reads this stuff ! Well even without the massive monster brawl that I was so hoping for it still can't negate the fact that I was throughly entertained by this flick. Every single person I lent this DVD to loved it. I loved Jennifer friend as Anabell she could be my neighbor anytime and how can I write a review without dissecting the gorgeous Tiffany Shepis who not only has dynamic screen prescence but also helped produce this movie and also pulled off a killer rendition of Bonnie Parker and f'n owned her. It also doesn't hurt to be quick witted, intelligent, beautiful, Sexy, oh did I mention sexy? She has estrogen just dripping from every pore in her body.(Tiffany please take the million) I may not be Robert Redford but close enough to consider the same offer he gave to Demi) Now that I'm done being a male chauvinistic pig, my love and respect goes out to her as well. It's simply not possible to watch this movie without also mentioning Trent Haaga Who played his version of Clyde and as Tiffany did f'n owed him as well. I think everyone knows that once one strips away the gangster stuff and all the mythology of Bonnie and Clyde it becomes clear that their relationship was nothing less than a love story. About  lovers and devotion and hope turned sideways becoming something evil, because of depression era desperation. I said that I wouldn't give away anymore spoilers but in the end I will say that Trent (Clyde) In a twisted kind of way truly shows his love and devotion for Bonnie and in this case a love that possible could be forever! Pun intended! I immediately went on to Amazon and bought a copy. What can I say folks this movie most likely isn't for dyed in the wool, blood sucking vampire lovers but it was FUN!!",1452470400,,6085,4.488708220415537

8404042,3,B003S5TOX8,A half-hearted effort at creating a horror movie. I received the movie quickly enough but the storyline leaves much to be desired.,1354147200,,130,4.954545454545454
8404043,3,B003S5TOX8,"I must say with a title like ""Bonnie & Clyde-vs-Dracula"", ones expectations run rather low, but this movie pulled some suprisingly good acting from the leads and decent special effects. But, the one thing that usually lacks in small indie films was in full bloom here..A GOOD SCRIPT! I think you will find yourself rooting for the bad guys (remember the 1967 film Bonnie & Clyde with Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway, didn't you root for them for most of the film, even though they were the ""bad guys""..i did). I am in now way comparing this film to that classic, but you kind of come away with the same love for the characters. The horror elements work very well with the violent nature of the ""bank robbing duo"", complimenting the action, and has a few suprises and twists. Bonnie is wickedly played by the sultry Tiffany Shepis. She evokes all the energy and spontaneity of the character. I personally think her performance is the strongest of the two. Clyde, played by Trent Haaga, is the ""on the run"" outlaw who struggles to keep up with Bonnies mood swings, trying to please her every chance he gets.  Dracula is played very well by Russel Friend, it's just too bad there was not more of him at his ""full power"". Some great supporting roles, especially by the troubled, tortured sister Annabel, played by Jennifer Friend. With some decent shootouts, genuine chills, ""Bonnie & Clyde-vs-Dracula"" is a fine example of indie films pushing the limit of storytelling....get your copy, you'll love it!",1338336000,2,1498,4.7615384615384615
8404044,2,B003S5TOX8,"Genre crossovers are nothing new, but with the massive literary success of the novel PRIDE AND PREJUDICE AND ZOMBIES, they're everywhere now and are an entire sub-genre in and of themselves. I like the idea of a crossover. I always enjoyed it as a kid when two or three tv shows would meet up for an episode or a two and would sometimes think of tv shows that would have been neat to see together-how cool would it have been if Magnum P.I. would have visited the mainland and got involved with the A-Team? Therefore, I picked up BONNIE & CLYDE VS. DRACULA just for the title alone. I kept thinking, it would be great to see a couple of gangsters take on the vampire king.

In the movie, Bonnie & Clyde are on the lamb after a bank robbery gone wrong. They are in need of a new car, a hideout, and a way to make some quick cash to get on their feet again. Clyde leads them to an ""inn"" of disreputable repute in the middle of nowhere where a friend of his is supposed to meet them with details of a bank robbery gig. Things don't go according to plan and instead of robbing a bank the duo take part in the theft of a moonshine truck. Unfortunately, that operation goes haywire, too and Bonnie and Clyde eventually find themselves at the house of a mysterious doctor who has brought Dracula back to life. The body count of people and vampires start to pile up as the duo fight to get out of the house and back on the road.

BONNIE & CLYDE VS. DRACULA starts off in an interesting and entertaining fashion. The movie also has some humorous bits scattered throughout. Unfortunately, the movie isn't a straight comedy and the strong beginning and funny parts aren't enough to keep the momentum of the movie going. They are supposed to join a friend of theirs, Henry, on a bank robbery. While waiting for the duo to show up, Henry has been working with a partner. When his partner shows up, Clyde shoots him dead with no explanation.

There's also the entire subplot of the movie. The mysterious Dr. Loveless apparently is a well-known surgeon who suffers from some sort of major physical deformity that he has been unable to cure (his face is covered by a sackcloth bag for most of the movie). In an attempt to cure himself, he's brought the remains of Dracula to his estate and has resurrected the vampire. Old Drac is weak and wants to feed and the Doctor is more than willing to assist as long as Drac will allow him to do some blood transfusions. In the middle of this is the Doc's assistant, his mentally-challenged sister, Annabel. He keeps Annabel under control with an electric collar around her neck that shocks her and will cause her death if she steps outside the mansions doors. Dracula is afraid of her because she is a ""complete innocent"" and he can't touch innocents.

The movie is entitled BONNIE & CLYDE VS. DRACULA, but the confrontation between these three individuals takes about 90 minutes (of about a 100 minute movie) to get to and it's not much of a battle. Old Drac is a footnote in Bonnie & Clyde's movie. Throw out what you thought you know about vampires because apparently they can be killed with bullets just like anyone else. It's kind of a shame because it would have been much more interesting to see Bonnie & Clyde making a standoff using wooden stakes and fire.",1323129600,5,3290,4.44205298013245
8404045,5,B003S5TOX8,"This is one of my favorite horror comedies of all time!!! THE WONDERFUL and very talented TIFFANY SHEPIS, and TROMA ALUMNI, TRENT HAAGA, star as

Bonnnie and Clyde, the famous or infamous bank robbers who meet up with old drac him self!! This is a twist on the dracula story, as a brother, and

sister hide dracula in their home, to get dracula to help the brother,Henry, who has a horrible disfigurement, that he wears a sack on his head...

 Henry needs drac's help as he will provide dracula with ""FOOD"" AHEM, if he will help Henry with his disfigurement, by using his

degenerate healing powers, to help heal him.... All is well, until Bonnie and Clyde show up, running from the law. when a robbery goes

wrong, and one of clyde's friends get's shot, Bonnie and Clyde  hear there is a doctor who lives up the road, AND GUESS WHO IT IS?.....

 THIS is a great movie, with not only strong performances from Tiffany Shepis, and Trent Haaga, who just eat their roles up... other strong

performances include the brother and sister, who are played by, Jennifer Friend as Annabel, and F. Martin Glynn as Henry, are out standing

as well... The Movie was made by a family by the name of FRIENDS, .... Jennifer Friend was Annabel, DRACULA, WAS played by Russell Friend,

a cameo of a kid was played by Alex Friend, and the Director of the movie and writer was Timothy Friend, so looks like great movie making

really does take good friends to make it work!!! I would also like to note that Tiffany Shepis, helped Produce this movie!! She is just

my favorite actor and she can do any thing!!! there is alot of action, alot of funny moments, Clyde meeting one of his old ""associates""

 again, and what happens afterwards is one of the high lights!!!... although there is not really a versus battle between Bonnie

and Clyde and Dracula, as the title implies, the movie is still a hoot to watch.. From beginning to end the movie really entertains!!

Tiffany Shepis really shines in this roll as does the whole cast, and is one of the funnier horror comedies out there, I will take this

over a big budget hollywood flat comedy like hang over 2, any day of the week! more comedies should be fresh and funny, like this one!!

 Big hollywood could learn a lot from small indie film companies like this, instead of trying to rip off the classics, and do

stupid watered down remakes, why not do something really funny and fresh, like this great little gem, I highly recommend, that

you buy this movie, and see what big holly wood has been missing for years, originality, fresh ideas, real acting, and funny

laugh out loud comedy!!! 5 stars! a must have!!",1307836800,2,2646,4.533755274261603
