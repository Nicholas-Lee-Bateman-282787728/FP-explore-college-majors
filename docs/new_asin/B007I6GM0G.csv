5088738,5,B007I6GM0G,"CAPTAINS OF THE CLOUDS is one of my favorite James Cagney films because it somehow manages to intertwine an intricate plot into a very simple and patriotic story. More important however, it relies on one of my favorite film themes, that of the protagonist (Cagney) not making the transition from one era of personal glory into the next era where he becomes a stranger in his own world which has changed all around him. This film got two Academy Awards nominations for Interior Decoration (Ted Smith - Art Direction, Casey Roberts - Interior Decoration) and Color Cinematography (Sol Polito). Director Michael Curtiz visually does an excellent job with this script. It starts off in the beautifully filmed Canadian wilderness with Cagney in his usual reckless tough guy form. These early images stand for the strong individual nature of James Cagney's character Brian MacLean that is in itself based on the Cagney mystique. Gradually, MacLean and the other two main characters Johnny Dutton (Dennis Morgan) and Emily Foster (Brenda Marshall) make gradual transitions to reveal personality growth, stagnation and hidden revelations. This is a wartime film made in 1942 and the film intertwines the plot with patriotic sentiment quite nicely but stresses the practicality of creating and maintaining a proficient and professional military force if the job is to get done. The entire cast is wonderful and includes Alan Hale, George Tobias and Gig Young. Composer Max Steiner also once again turns in an insightful and intelligent score. There are some great flying scenes full of bravado, daring do and just plain out foolhardiness with Cagney leading his cronies in and out of the doghouse. This is a very entertaining film.",1421452800,3,1722,5.1535714285714285

8517292,5,B007I6GM0G,"A hand full of Canadian, bush pilots, (James Cagney, Dennis Morgan, Alan Hale, George Tobias, and Reginald Gardiner) has a dream of owning their own airline. Naturally a girl (Brenda Marshall) gets in the mix. James Cagney has to sacrifice himself and money (by getting married) to save Dennis Morgan from marring this unreliable woman and losing his dream.
Through all kinds of misunderstandings the pilots eventualiy end up in the Royal Air Force planning to give it to those Nazis. Each pilot still brings his bush nature with him; for many that nature may mean their demise.",1500940800,,578,4.908163265306122
8517293,3,B007I6GM0G,"Captains of the Clouds, 1942 film

This movie is dedicated to the Royal Canadian Air Force for their abilities and courage. An airplane with floats flies towards and lands on a lake. But MacLean has taken the passengers earlier. MacLean also undercut another bush pilot. Bush pilots complain about his competition. Brain MacLean land with packages, then steals a paying passenger. Three other bush pilots arrive (for dramatic conflict). Brian lands at another lake then has an accident. Johnny complains about Brians competition but will fly for a doctor. There is fog at night; can Johnny land safely? Fires are built for guidance.

Johnny has plans to start a scheduled airline. Brian will recover in a few weeks. Emily cares for Brian. When he recovers Brian agrees to work with Johnny. There is rainy weather, Johnny lands safely. Brian cautions Johnny about marriage to Emily; there is a fist fight! Later Brian takes Emily to Ottawa. Johnny follows. Emily has married Brian! Outside Canadian soldiers march on the street. Johnny goes to a recruiting station. Brian leaves Emily but gives her his money. A newspaper tells about the Dunkirk evacuation. The four bush pilots fly to Uplands, the RCAF training station.

Training airplanes are painted orange for visibility. The four volunteer, they are needed for training younger pilots. No one over 26 can be a fighter pilot; its the medical rules. Brian meets Johnny, his teacher. Brian shows off his flying skills, but he must learn to fly in close formation. Brian trains bombers and gunners. They will use live bombs in training. But Brian flies too low and his airplane is damaged. He didn't follow the rules and is court-martialed and dismissed. Brian drinks in the back room and reads a newspaper. Air Marshal Billy Bishop awards wings to the new pilots. Brian and his buddy fly over, there is a problem when one pulls out of a dive!

There is a celebration at a nightclub; Emily is there. Brian was punished with a loss of his license. There is a floor show. They are told of an accident that killed pilots, they need every available pilot to fly Lockheed Hudsons to England. One civilian pilot is a ringer who wants a new start. The bombers take off in the night. When they get near to England a lone ME-109 attacks the bombers! They climb into the clouds but the attacks continue. What can Brian do to stop the attack? The others continue to land. We shall never surrender.

This is two stories that were melded together. One is about the life of bush pilots in Canadas forests and lakes. The other is about the need for following orders in the military. There is no need for those who fly by the seat of their pants. This plot was reused in at least one other war-time movie. The story of a sacrifice goes back to Charles Dickens A Tale of Two Cities. The idea of a lone enemy fighter attacking a flight of bombers is unbelievable. The ME-109 had a short range, a design feature known and exploited by the British. Len Deightons book Fighter tells about the Battle of Britain.",1499385600,,3041,4.708646616541353
