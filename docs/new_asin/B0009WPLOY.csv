8068567,3,B0009WPLOY,"Well, you've really got to hand it to some of these companies. They seem to be geniuses at concocting new ways to package and sell old stuff. BLOOD SOAKED CINEMA: BACK FROM THE GRAVE looks like a terrifying, gore-drenched collection of modern zombie epics. In reality, it's just another rehashed conglomeration of ancient, public domain artifacts. I BURY THE LIVING is a pseudo-supernatural spooker about a man (Richard Boone) who seems to have power over life and death. I EAT YOUR SKIN is a Del Tenny schlocker about bug-eyed zombies on a tropical island. THE INDESTRUCTIBLE MAN stars Lon Chaney Jr. as the title character, on a murderous rampage of revenge. IT HAPPENED AT NIGHTMARE INN is about a series of disappearances at the INN. Stars the lovely Judy Geeson. LEGACY OF BLOOD is a sort of neo-old-dark-house movie, w/ a cast of wretched relatives. John Carradine is listed, but don't expect to see much of him! THE MONSTER WALKS has Mischa Auer in another old-dark-house-like mystery / thriller, w/ dead bodies and a squawking monkey in the basement! THE MURDER MANSION has stranded motorists trapped in the title abode, dealing w/ -possibly- paranormal events. Barbara Steele, in a dual role, is ghoulish, yet oddly alluring in NIGHTMARE CASTLE, the best movie in this collection. It's about vengeance from beyond the grave. NIGHT OF BLOODY HORROR is an absurd film concerning a group of models, menaced by one of the most grating villains in any horror movie! THE SEVERED ARM features the lopped-off appendage, and a group of men who ate it! Payback ensues. SLAVE OF THE CANNIBAL GOD, while certainly no CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST, does hold its own as a jungle adventure, cannibal story. Stars Stacy Keach and Ursula Andress. THE UNDERTAKER AND HIS PALS is a zany, macabre tale of murderous bikers, a diner, and the world's most annoying funeral director. The theme song is a hoot! There you go. None of these movies even comes close to anything remotely ""blood soaked"", w/ only scant bloodiness here and there. As stated before, these are movies that have been around forever, showing up on numerous packages such as this. Not altogether awful, just nothing that isn't readily available everywhere...",1453507200,,2204,4.975609756097561
8068568,4,B0009WPLOY,"The name BACK FROM THE GRAVE refers to the age of these dozen fright films, which have literally returned from the cinematic boneyard to haunt your nightmares. This edition of the BLOOD SOAKED CINEMA series is a bargain-priced sampling of vintage horror from the years 1932 to '78. As the saying goes: ""They don't make 'em like they used to,"" and this DVD package of oldie scarefests surely proves the point.

It's a monster-sized  selection of creeps, manbeasts, vampires and maniacs, all from the ""Ghoulden"" Age of Hollywood.

8068569,1,B0009WPLOY,"I just want to make sure that anyone buying these discs knows that they are edited for television versions, and the quality of the prints are terrible.  The sound is also very bad.

This must be a distribution company out to make a quick buck, so please do not support them.  For instance, ""It Happened At Nightmare Inn"" runs only 67 minutes, and I know that this has at least 30 minutes edited from it. There are entire sequences missing, and it is very very obvious when viewing the films.

I assume that this is legal, but I find it odd that the entire running time of these title is an outright lie.

Please again, do not waste your money!",1125964800,23,643,4.325
