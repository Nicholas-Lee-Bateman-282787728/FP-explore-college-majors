6129690,5,B00H3DW7P8,We're a family of Scooby fans and we all enjoyed this. Parts of the story required you to suspend disbelief a bit more than normal -- even for the Scooby universe -- but it was an adventurous romp with a solid mystery.,1395187200,,218,4.214285714285714
6129691,5,B00H3DW7P8,"Just saw the movie and as a long time fan of both WWE and Scooby Doo I honestly have to give it props. They did a great job on this movie and it has everything you want to see in a Scooby Doo/WWE movie. Lots of stars, great voice acting, great plot, and lots of comedy. It's perfect for the kids.

6129694,5,B00H3DW7P8,"First time in a very long time that WWE is going cartoon. I remember when it was Hulk Hogan's rockin Wrestling on Saturday Mornings ( years ago ). Now WWE is back with a big move in doing a cartoon movie with everyone's favorite cartoon dog ( Scooby-Doo ). Looking forward in getting this one for sure. John Cena is an Icon and to me just as good and more popular than the Rock. A must see and get for your collection. There are more WWE Stars going to be in this movie too. All I can really say, is if you love Scooby-Doo and enjoy watching WWE, This is a must see.",1388534400,22,566,4.017699115044247

6129703,4,B00H3DW7P8,"Released in 2014, SCOOBY-DOO! WRESTLEMANIA MYSTERY is the twenty-first in the Scooby-Doo movie series created specifically for the home market.  Created in conjunction with WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment), it features cartoon versions of such real life wrestling stars as Kane, John Cena, Triple H, Brodus Clay, Sin Cara, and A.J. Lee.

When Scooby-Doo makes a perfect score on a WWE video game, the gang receives the prize of an all-expenses-paid trip to WWE Citybut even before they get there the town, stadium, and wrestlers are beset by a mysterious ghost bear that causes considerable damage and actually puts one wrestler in traction.  Needless to say, the attacks continue once the gang arrives, and when Scooby-Doo is accused of stealing, the gang is prepared to do anything to clear his name!

Like most titles in the series, WRESTLEMANIA has some pretty solid animation, and while the story seems slow to starttheres an awful of wrestlers to introduceonce it gets going the result is pretty well paced.  But the show comes with a caveat.  The Scooby-Doo shows usually scrape by with gang escaping genuinely violent situations, but what with the wrestling and all, theres a lot of slamming, banging, punching, flinging, and such.  Older kids will take it in stride, but parents may want to screen it for younger ones.

If you are a fan of WWE it is worth a moment of your time especially if you are looking to kill about an 1 hr and 1/2.  Many superstars are shown in cameos but John Cena is the main guy.

6129751,5,B00H3DW7P8,"Scooby-Doo is one of my favorite cartoon characters and I have been a pro wrestling fan since I was a kid. This film is so funny and WWE in this film stays true its to wrestling roots. This film had most of the WWE wrestlers like John Cena, Sin Cara, AJ Lee, Kane, The Miz and Mr. McMahon. This film takes place after Shaggy and Scooby won a video game dancing contest to see the grandest stage of all WWE: WrestleMania. So, Shaggy and Scooby asked the rest of the gang to go with them, but Velma, Fred, Daphne are not huge wrestling fans. On the way to WrestleMania, the Scooby-Doo gang will meet a huge mystery of WrestleMania haunted by a ghost bear and it is up to the gang to solve the mystery. This film had many hiliarious scenes like Daphne developing a crush on John Cena which makes Fred jealous and Scooby and Shaggy getting in a wrestling ring and getting their butts whipped by the professionals. I gave this film a 5 star rating.",1430956800,3,943,4.303370786516854

6129815,5,B00H3DW7P8,"Shaggy and Scooby have mastered their wrestling-themed video game with Scooby achieving such a high score that he wins a chance for them to visit WWE City, the home of their favorite professional wrestlers.  At first, the rest of the gang doesnt really want to go, but when Scooby and Shaggy point out all the uncomfortable/embarrassing things theyve had to do while playing live bait to catch ghosts and monsters, the others admit that they kind of owe them.  Scooby and Shaggy are thrilled at the chance to meet with the professional wrestlers they idolize, but the visit turns frightening when a giant ghostly bear shows up to trash the area and terrorize the wrestlers.  To make matters worse, Scooby is framed for stealing the championship belt, forcing him and Shaggy to defend their honor in a match with one of the toughest wrestlers while the others rig a trap to catch the phantom bear.

A number of real-life professional wrestlers have lent their voices and personas to this movie, which is fascinating.  Im not a fan of professional wrestling, but I still enjoyed the mystery.  Actually, I was joking about it with a friend because we recently discovered the old Santo movies, which are Mexican horror/adventure films made during the middle of the last century and are about a wrestler who fights vampires, werewolves, and other monsters.  The part in this show with Sin Cara (in English Faceless or Without a Face because of his mask), who fights in the style of Mexican masked luchadors, reminds me of Santo.  (If you're curious about Santo, some of his old movies have subtitles and one of them was featured on Mystery Science Theater 3000 as Samson vs. The Vampire Women.  They aren't really kids shows and are basically a vehicle for showing off Santos wrestling skills, but they're still fun).  I just think its funny because the idea of wrestlers vs. supernatural beings has been done before (over 50 times in Santos case, it was a huge franchise).

Anyway, this Scooby-Doo movie featured a fun and clever mystery.  I actually wasn't sure who the villain was until the end, although it turned out to be one of the two people I suspected.

The disc includes a bonus episode from A Pup Named Scooby-Doo.",1409702400,3,2221,4.782722513089006

6129863,4,B00H3DW7P8,"This movie is about Shaggy and Scooby winning a trip to WWE city to see WrestleMania.  The gang runs into trouble when Scooby is accused of stealing the WWE championship belt. Some of their new friends must prove Scoobys innocence before its too late and the mysterious Ghost bear ruins the main event.  Daphne (Grey DeLisle) is my favorite character because she is in love with John Cena and it reminds of me of myself when I have a big crush on a celebrity.  I love when she confesses to Fred that she gave John her phone number, cellular number, email address and home address.  That is pretty funny and cute and - Fred gets jealous. Scooby (Frank Welker) is my second favorite character because I love his voice and he is a better fighter than Shaggy because his moves are so swift and smooth.

I enjoyed the wrestling scenes in this movie, especially when Scooby is dreaming of being in a video game and he is up against a slice of a pizza, two delicious hotdogs and a huge cup of soda.

 My favorite scene is Scooby playing the bonus level of the video game by doing Sin Caras victory dance because Scooby has some nice dance moves.  I is really cool to see WWE city animated because you get to experience what it is like to be a wrestler and what it is like to see a fight in the stadium. The upbeat music allows the audience to feel the excitement of the opponents. My least favorite part is the beginning because it takes forever to get to the plot and I is confusing for the first 30 minutes of the film.
The moral of the film is to not allow ones anger to turn into revenge.  Its okay to be angry. It is not okay to act on the anger and make bad decisions.  Parents should be aware that there are fighting scenes and a Ghost bear before allowing small children to view this movie.  I recommend this movie for ages nine year to 18 years. I give this movie 3 out of 5 stars.",1400716800,,1883,4.231843575418995

6129893,2,B00H3DW7P8,"I would have loved a Scooby Doo WWF movie in the 80's or probably any other era than this one. Now is the corny Cena brainwashing era where they tried since 2005 to convince us he's a wrestling god. So this is basically just more WWE brainwashing about how special Cena is. And I'm sure the upcoming WWE/Flintstone movie is all about Cena too.
  I'm a Scooby Doo fan; watch them all with my nieces. Cena is shoved in my face enough though without in a Scooby Doo movie too. Scooby-Doo with Hogan, Macho Man, Warrior, the Rock or Stone Cold or anyone from any other era would have been more watchable.",1398124800,6,600,4.348214285714286
6129894,5,B00H3DW7P8,I was skeptical on this one until we watched it. The script writers did a great job of blending the WWE with Scooby-Doo. My three year old daughter has wanted to watch this one every day since we got it! We both have plenty of laughs throughout the movie. Longest and best of the Scooby-doo movies to date. Great fun for the whole family!,1398038400,,338,4.296875

This disaster was bought and paid for by WWE. I can't believe the Scooby Doo franchise agreed to partner with these people. Sad day for Scooby Doo fans.,1397779200,7,311,4.032258064516129
6129897,5,B00H3DW7P8,"When I heard that this movie was going to be made,I was quite excited. I just received my movie 2 days ago,and it was so much fun. My four old son and I enjoy this movie so much,I played it again after it finished. I think we're like on our 8th time watching this more. For me this movie combined two of my favorite thing,which is Scooby Doo and WWE. My son is a big Scooby Doo fan,and he just loves this movie. I am happy that I bought the version of this that came with a digital copy,that way my son can watch it on the go. The only problem I had with the movie is that it didn't have a descriptive service feature on there. For those of you who don't know what the descriptive service is,I will explain. I'm legally blind,have been for years. However,certain movies have the feature which will have a male or female voice explaining the movies to you as the movie goes on. For example,when you first put the DVD for The Avengers,it will give you choices. You will see English, English Descriptive Service,and may another language. When the movie plays after selecting English Descriptive Service,the movie will be explain to you. I would like more movie companies to put this feature on every single DVD and Blu-ray that is released. There are many people who have visual issue,but love movies just like others. I'm hoping one day I can get that feature to be mandated on all movies,past and present,and up coming.

Other than that,WE LOVED THIS MOVIE!!!!!",1397692800,4,1460,4.488721804511278
6129898,5,B00H3DW7P8,"I am not into WWE wrestling and was hesitant on purchasing this movie but, this was great.  My husband and I have watched it at least 3 times since we purchased it.  There is some wrestling but it isn't bad.  I enjoyed Shaggy and Scooby-Doo trying to be taught by AJ Lee on how to wrestle in the ring.  They said she was like Kane only with lip stick.  It was a great mystery from beginning to end.  Wasn't correct on my guess on who was in the Ghost Bear costume, was surprised when they revealed the culprit.  It was interesting how the Scooby gang and the wrestlers worked together to find clues and stop the Bear before he could destroy the WWE.

Whether you like WWE wrestling or not, this is another great Scooby-Doo mystery.  Would recommend!",1397692800,,749,4.369565217391305

6129907,4,B00H3DW7P8,"While the movie was good, I'm going to have to give it only 4 stars. It stuck to the formula, but it was lacking in developing the mystery. It felt like the ending was rushed. Also, it centered more on the WWE stars than on the Scooby gang. I'd watch it again, but I'm glad I rented it instead of bought it.",1396742400,,307,3.967741935483871

The rest of it though is just a standard Scooby Mystery with a guy (spoilers) in a rubber mask.
It is kind of fun to hear all of the wrestlers do their own voices, some do it well and others not so well.
The WWE has long since rebranded itself as a PG product and aimed itself at the kids of those of us who were crazed during the WWF Attitude Era. Those days are gone and family friendly is the way of the world now.",1396569600,,636,4.055555555555555

I really liked  Sccoby Doo, Shaggy, Daphne and the rest teaming up with Batman and Robin, The Harlem Globetrotters and Josie and The Pussycats, but Mystery Inc teaming up with the WWE ""superstars""? First, the WWE is NOT for Children, they have violence and sexual overtones, and second, Vince McMahon will do just about anything to make money! Case in point, he created a cable channel devoted to the WWE! So do not waste your money on this dreck!!! >:(",1396483200,5,534,4.933333333333334
6129910,4,B00H3DW7P8,"Hanna Barbera cranks out at least one Scooby Doo movie per year.  The animation and voice acting is always good, never bad.  You're given 2-3 suspects to choose from in the mystery.  And you get plenty of over the top action and slapstick comedy.

""Scooby Doo!  Wrestlemania Mystery"" doesn't deviate from that formula.  A ghost bear threatens to ruin Wrestlemania and it's up to Mystery Inc to save the day.

The inclusion of the WWE is a welcome change.  The wrestlers (oops, they're called 'Superstars' now) don't dominate the scenes but they do add to them.  Only a handful of wrestlers are present with John Cena taking center stage.

Definitely worth a rental for the family.",1396396800,6,680,4.7844827586206895

Various WWE personalities appear throughout the film including John Cena, Sin Cara, The Miz, Kane, Brodus Clay, Santino Marella, A.J. Lee, Triple H, Michael Cole, Mr. McMahon and other superstars & legends appearing such as Big Show, Alberto Del Rio, Sgt. Slaughter, Jerry Lawler, and Jimmy Hart.

Scooby Doo & Shaggy win a trip to playing their video game to WrestleMania in WWE City convincing Freddie & Daphne & Thelma to tag along in the Mystery Machine only for an accident allowing them to meet John Cena, his trainer Cookie, and Cookie's nephew Ruby who give them V.I.P. tickets to the show that night where Mr. McMahon makes the announcement that a new WWE Champion would be determined at WrestleMania only for Scooby to be caught on video stealing the WWE Championship Belt by WWE Executive Ms. Richards.  Now the Scooby Gang only 24 hours to prove Scooby & Shaggy are innocent before they are forced to fight for their freedom in a match against Kane while dealing with various issues including a ghost bear that had been attacking & injuring ""awesome"" wrestlers in it's path including one who it has a past history with, a woodsman named Bayard who make it clear that he dislikes WWE City & anyone associated with it, Daphne developing a big crush on a certain superstar that may or may not work to their advantage, issues with Cookie about Ruby's future, and both Shaggy & Scooby showing their completely out of their league when it comes to their match against Kane.

DVD extras include a behind the scenes look at the movie along with a bonus wresting themed episode of A Pup Named Scooby Doo named ""WrestleManiacs"".

That being said, I was shocked when we bought this Scooby movie and it began with scenes of hardcore wrestling.  Moves that children have emulated in the past and have either been seriously injured from or died.  Some will say ""well it says 'WRESTLEMANIA!"" on the cover - duh!"" and to that I say in the past all the Scooby movies/shows featuring wresting have been so outrageously fake my kids would have never thought they were real -- I mean really who can seriously be twisted into a pretzel shape?  If you have small children or those that are easily impressionable, seriously think before you buy this movie.  My kids are well aware of what's fake and what isn't and we had to have a long chat with them about how they were to never emulate the moves they saw on the video.  It makes me sad that Scooby, the one cartoon character we used to be able to turn to for ""safe"", fun movies (we own almost every single Scooby movie/TV show), has stooped to gratuitous violence to sell DVD's.  I'd take it back to the store if I could.  I strongly recommend you rent it and preview it before showing it to your kids and/or buying.  Shame on Warner Bros.",1395878400,7,1260,4.392241379310345

But after I saw the trailer, it took me in and I immediately knew I had to have it! Went to Best Buy and got the only copy they had and popped it in my DVD player as soon as I got home and I was not disappointed with the film.

The plot surrounds the Mystery Inc winning tickets to Wrestlemania after Shaggy and Scooby beat the hardest level of their WWE video game. Wrestlemania is being hosted in WWE City that is owned by Vince McMahon. However things are not as they seem. An evil Ghost Bear is plotting to steal the WWE Championship and sabotage Wrestlemania to ensure there is no main event. To ensure the protection of the WWE Championship and the main event, Mystery Inc teams up with WWE superstars John Cena, Triple H, Sin Cara, Kane, The Miz, AJ Lee, and Brodus Clay to solve the mystery of who's in the Ghost Bear costume before it's too late.

From beginning to end, this movie is enjoyable from all aspects. WWE enters the Scooby Doo world! Wrestling and Scooby Doo have been around for generations so the movie easily pertains to people of all ages: kids, teens, adults, and elders! If you grew up in the 80s, watching this may take you back to the days of when Hulk Hogan's Rock n Wrestling cartoon show ran wild on tv screens. All in all, whether you're a fan of wrestling, Scooby Doo, or both, you'll definitely enjoy this!
