2988698,5,B000WOSAXS,"I bought this dvd for my 6 year old daughter, she just love,love the bratzs. She has watch this movie over 20 times, I have to say give it a rest. The movie is about Cloe, Jade, Sasha and Yasmin, getting ready to go on a reality show hosted by their friend Byron. The reality show is about young girls fashion designers modeling in a glitzy New York fashion show. The prize for the winner is diamond studded Go-Go boots. On the way to the reality show the bratz encounter a hunted town, mysterious traveler, a fashion designer wannabe, so they have to over come all these things so they don't miss the competition.
