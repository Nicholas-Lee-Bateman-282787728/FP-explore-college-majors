6038917,4,B00FYJ6ONY,"The movies movies are well done, but of course they lack the detail given in the book. I recommend watching the movies first, part three is supposed to come out this summer, and then read the book to fill in the details.",1389398400,,220,4.261904761904762
6038918,5,B00FYJ6ONY,"Absolutly recommend. Ayn Rand's novel ""Atlas Shrugged"" is what these movies are based on. These only cover part of the book. As with any book to movie they have to leave out allot. Would recommend you get the book. It's long but well worth the time and money. You would think Ms. Rand wrote the novel yesterday the way our country is going.",1389052800,15,340,4.412698412698413
6038919,5,B00FYJ6ONY,"Two was incredible and was better than one, and it is ok to watch two first.....then one for fill in.  It's kind of like Kill Bill two was better than one, but ok to watch out of sequence.  Three was a bad soap opera.",1440806400,,217,3.909090909090909
6038920,5,B00FYJ6ONY,"Of course, its not as good as the book, and the changing actors for each movie is a little disconcerting, but a great way to expose those who would never otherwise read the novel.",1439337600,,179,4.294117647058823

6038922,5,B00FYJ6ONY,"These arrived in very good shape with no problems. The movies themselves are interesting, but I'd recommend reading the book first.",1434499200,,131,5.285714285714286
6038923,4,B00FYJ6ONY,great story - would have been great if they had not changed actors,1434499200,,66,4.153846153846154

6038926,5,B00FYJ6ONY,"Very good series of films to watch if you are open to individual thought, individual opportunity and individual responsibility and you realize that the government cannot provide everything for you . when  the government tries to, or desires to, provide everything for you, then what they give you comes from them taking everything, including freedom away from others. And the sad part is they (government) get bigger and bigger and wealthier and wealthier and more powerful by keeping a bigger and bigger cut of all the goods they take through taxes and fees. And they still call the creators and workers the greedy ones.",1431216000,,621,4.971153846153846

6038928,5,B00FYJ6ONY,"I really was intrigued by the concept and message behind this story. You've gotta check it out, it's indicative of today's society even though it was conceived over 50 years ago.",1429574400,,178,4.774193548387097

6038930,4,B00FYJ6ONY,A little slow at first. But the movies were good. I am sure the progressives don't like it,1426723200,,90,4.055555555555555
6038931,5,B00FYJ6ONY,"I have purchased two complete Blu-ray sets and have watched them several times.  One is for home the other is a spare or loaner.  Just a shame that the book is not mandatory reading for graduation from high school.
If all Americans, or those who share in the American dream, were to read or even watch AS then the United States would be the country is once was.  The world could follow suit.",1426377600,2,391,4.328767123287672

6038933,5,B00FYJ6ONY,"Very good movie set. Easily would buy again if needed. However, if you are not an Ayn Rand fan you probably will not like it. Very political,  very heavy in message.",1425859200,,165,4.32258064516129
6038934,4,B00FYJ6ONY,"I read the book first, twice in fact.  I waited until all three parts were released before I purchased this so I could watch it on successive evenings.  The film is essentially very well done, but of course it's not the book.  Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't recall there were cell phones yet when the book was written.  We'll likely watch this one every other winter as we do our other series and musicals.",1424736000,,404,4.346666666666667
6038935,5,B00FYJ6ONY,"Chilling scenario, some of which is happening today. Just hope this is not our future. It does give one something to think about.",1424649600,,129,4.6521739130434785

6038949,5,B00FYJ6ONY,"Watched when on TV awhile back, want to own it for ourselves and friends.  Marvelous screen production of the 1930's works of philosopher Ayn Rand.  Mind blowing is that she predicted big government would severely erode American Freedoms, American dreams, and American free enterprise -- all of which has become increasingly apparent over the last 6 years.  Watch carefully for the links between story content and reality.",1421798400,2,422,5.268656716417911
6038950,5,B00FYJ6ONY,Great films. I was totally amazed at how relevant the subject is to today's world. The author was a true visionary. I recommend that everyone concerned about the direction our country is taking should read the book or see these films!!!,1421625600,,236,4.780487804878049

6038965,3,B00FYJ6ONY,"I liked each movie on it's own, but the second was the better work. My biggest problem was the discontinuity between parts I and II, what with different actors and setting changes. If they could have produced both movies with all the actors & resources from part II, it would have flowed much better. Both movies did a fairly decent job of conveying the values of the book.",1412121600,2,373,4.5

6038971,4,B00FYJ6ONY,"Just finished watching these films for the first time and I'm really excited to see the third installment in the theater.
Purists may not care for the film version, but the writers did a really good job capturing the spirit of the story and Rand's Objectivism.",1404432000,,260,4.673913043478261
6038972,4,B00FYJ6ONY,"Watched the two part Blu-ray version of Atlas Shrugged"" the other day and liked the story.  Didn't understand why they changed some of the actors though?

This story based upon the Ayn Rand book by the same name has a thought provoking plot  that provides great entertainment.  The CG isn't too bad either.  It seemed more like a made for TV movie, and non of the actors are big names, but it was still very entertaining.

If you liked Rand's book ""Fountainhead"", one most kids were required to read in high school then you may like this movie and the book as well.",1404086400,,565,4.436893203883495
6038973,5,B00FYJ6ONY,"I very good movie for an even better book.  It tells the story of a government that has become to big, too powerful, and too corrupt.  The book was written by Ayn Rand, who was born, raised and went to university in Russia.  She visited the United State when she was 21 and fell in love with the USA and became a citizen.  After observing the USA slowly becoming more like Russia, she wrote this story as a cautionary tale to her fellow American Citizens.  The story is more relevant today and worth your time.  Do you know who John Galt is?",1400198400,8,541,4.254901960784314
