He truly does all in this film by even combating racism and the hardships of the ""ghetto"". Bill  Maher truly shows how life is ""Politcally Incorrect"" with his  struggling music career.

855938,5,6304375344,"Brings back memories. I drove a Checker cab for almost four years in Coral Gables, Florida. Most of the cabs in the movie must have been picked up from the cab company. You have your usual cast of characters. Gary Busey in particular shows his flair for playing off beat nut cases as well as super series bad guys. To see Bill Maher in a supporting role shows his talents. Adam Baldwin's was refreshing as his wide innocent roles. The speech Mr. T gave is a classic. Also special props to Max Gail in his complete opposite of his ""Wojo"" character from Barney Miller.",1446854400,,566,4.451923076923077

It's a formula movie with Plot A (saving the cab company) and Plot B (solving the kidnapping) and Plot C (hero getting the girl) and a few subplots with a motley crew of characters, but 30 years later, I still find myself quoting it. Lots of famous faces in the ensemble cast.",1425513600,,428,4.296296296296297

856437,5,6304375344,"Seriously? How many stars would I give this? I don't know how many d lists stars are in it? Let's see Mr Tee, Gary Busey, Paul rodriguez, The Barbarian brothers,Bob Zmuda partner of the late, great Andy Kaufman, Grady from Sanford and Son. How many stars can I give it? 5? Not enough. Bill Maher's acting in this film is enough to make you lose your religion. However, Busey's performance is electric though. I think he was nominated for an Oscar but I am not sure I'll have to check my records. This movie tackles all the social issues still facing us today, race, sexism, barbarism, nudism. I think that if Christopher Hitchens was still alive and reviewed DC CAB it might sound something like this: ""This film is at once plagued with an infectious effervescance that by turns infests the viewer with its ebulliance and harum-scarum style and one finds one self complicit in poppycock and nincompoopery of the tribe of ne'er do wells that set table before you."" or in an unguarded moment he might say Hell yes!",1417910400,,1012,4.627777777777778

It has been more than 30 years since I have seen this movie.  Yet I quote lines from it on a regular basis and have since I first saw it as a teen back in the 80's (thanks to the new-fangled VHS--we could watch R rated movies at home with mom and dad).  This would most certainly not make R rating in this day and age--some cussing, some sexual innuendo, one nudity scene--is no big deal now.

857019,4,6304375344,"Every once in a while, you get a movie that has virtually no plot, and you end up loving it anyway.  Most every critic gave this movie a very thumbs down review for this reason.  However, there are two reasons to watch and love D.C. Cabthe cast (which is a virtual all-star line-up, even though many of the actors and actresses were up-and-coming unknowns at the time), and the humor.  This movie is funny as hell.

As I said, the story isn't the reason to watch this movie.  It follows Albert Hockenberry (not sure if there has been a funnier or more strange name for a character) who decides he wants to become a cabbie.  He first has to learn the zones and districts, so he pals around with the seasoned veteran drivers to learn the tricks of the trade.  However, D.C. Cab company is the worst cab company in Washington, D.C.  This is mostly due to the fact that the drivers are a hodge-podge of screw-ups and delinquents.  The cab company is in financial trouble (go figure!), and they are trying to find a way to keep the company going.  A far-fetched and ridiculous kidnapping takes over the last half of the movie, but again, forget the story.

D.C. Cab yields a line-up of actors like Mr. T (soon after his Rocky III premiere), Bill Maher, Gary Busey (arguably in one of his funniest roles ever), Adam Baldwin, Max Gail, Marsha Warfield, Irene Cara, The Barbarian Brothers, Paul Rodriguez, and late comedian Charles Barnett who all but steals the movie in its funniest scenes (one including a train!) and lines.

D.C. Cab is one of those movies where you just have to sit back and enjoy it.  It isn't asking you to think at all or to try and make sense of it.  After all, who makes a movie about a taxi cab company?!  You have some movies that are just pure entertainment, and this is one of them.

Joel Schumacher (yes, THAT Joel Schumacher), who nearly destroyed the Batman franchise, both wrote the script and directed this film.  As far as humor goes, this may be the only movie that he got right, in that respect.

So, sit back and let D.C. Cab take you along for a fun and hilarious ride!",1362009600,,2102,4.4296875

857128,5,6304375344,"I remember when I  first saw this movie in the old Lowes Theatre on Fulton Street in Downtown Brooklyn (It's a church now).
If your 37 years or older, then you will find this movie truly funny from beginning to end. The funniest part of the movie for me, is when Tyrone (Charlie Barnett) intoduces Albert (Adam Baldwin) to something called ""The Run""  where Tyronne drives his cab on freight train tracks,and Albert chickens out. They hear a freight train horn and panic, and try to get the cab off the tracks but get stuck when the wheels get jammed in the freight train rails,lol! They then try to get out the cab, but Albert gets his sleeve stuck in the cabs door handle. The rest, you just have to see for yourself,lol!

Basically, this is a movie about Adam Baldwin's Character trying to become a cab driver. Then, you have a case of a lost violin worth a fortune, a kidnapping of 2 kids who look like the 2 kids from the movie ""Spy Kids"" mixed with the badness of the kids from ""Are we there yet""

The thing about Adam Baldwin in this movie is he looked as if his character came from the movie ""My Bodyguard"" where he played ""Ricky Linderman"" in Chicago, and reappears in Washington D.C. where he changed his name to Albert Hockenberry with a new additute and look on life.

The other characters played by Mr. T, Gary Busey, Whitman Mayo who you will remember playing Grady Wilson from Sandford and Son, Marsha Warfield, Paul Rodriquez, and a non controversal Bill Maher are equally as funny.

857131,3,6304375344,DC Cab is a movie for those who aren't too critical of overall plot and performance.  It was made in the early 80's as such it does have its share of cheesy overtones.

857132,1,6304375344,"I was ""around"" during the filming of D C Cab and most of the actors and most of the crew were coked up throughout the filming. Most scenes were shot and not even edited because of budget restraints. Look carefully at Gary Busey's eyes during every single scene. He's so high he can hardly slow down his lines. The same is true of most of the other actors who are either conspiculously quiet and speechless  in scenes or are over animated. Coke is the reason that this film has so few close up shots and why, in almost every scene, the actors are just running, jumping around and/or screaming- both inside the cab sets and out. This movie, from my view, is a sad example of a possibly funny movie devolving into a cocaine fueled manic mess of scenes strung together into a releasable product. The project was such a negative experience that few or none of those involved would ever work together again.",1317686400,,901,4.4939024390243905

857217,5,6304375344,"I think this would be one of those movies that receive the 89's cheese award. However it's one of my favorite movies. I love those zany madcap humorous movies. This movie stars Adam Baldwin (Independence Day and no relation to the Baldwin brothers), Max Gail (Barney Miller), Gary Busey, Mr. T, Irene Cara (she has a cameo as well two songs that she sings on the soundtrack), Marsha Warfield (Night Court), Paul Radriguez,Bill Maher and the Barbarian Brothers (David and Peter Paul).

The movie takes place at a taxi cab company in Washington D.C. They are pitted against a rival taxi company called Emerald. D.C. Cab is owned and operated by Harold (Gail) and things aren't going right. They are on the verge of closing down and loosing this drivers. Out comes Adam Baldwin who's father served with Harold in the Veitnam War. Albert (Baldwin) has always wanted to be a cab driver and looks to Harold to guide him. What leads up to Alberts arrival is madcap humor and hijinks on the road and at the D.C. Cab company. Dell (Busey) blows his windows in his cab showing Albert his new sound system, Mr. T. trying to fight drug dealers (he suspects) and tried to get his neice to steer clear of the ""nice har"" the ""drug dealers"" often show on the corner of a street. 'It's the car, Albert, It's the car,"" Mr. T's character Samson replies angrily.

As D.C. Cab is on the verge of shutting down (Harold's wife Myrna collects the reward money for helself because she found and returned a priceless violin that had been missing. Albert uses his life savings to rescue the company complete with new cars, repainted building, and a remodeling and updating the interior as well. Oh and lets not forget the snazzy jackets and airport licenses that Emerald has. Trouble ensues when Albert is taken hostage and Harold tries to round up the troops to make a bold rescue. With his zanny cohorts help?

For anyone who likes comedies then this is a nice addition to your DVD library. The DVD includes Dolby Digital and that's about it. Anyone who is a 80's film nut (like me), it's a must have as well.",1206662400,2,2084,4.581769436997319

I asked her ""what movie?"" to which she replied ""DC Cab"". I didn't see any evidence of that on that particular night, but I wonder how close I came to being in this movie as much as I walked up and down that sidewalk. When Dell and Albert are driving down the street with all the twinkling lights in the background and the two hookers come up to the car and say ""Hi Dell - hey baby"", I was in the first bar you see. I'm not saying it could have been a promising film career, but what a testimony it could have been to my wild youth. That street is now upscale office buildings and hotels, and my hair has fallen out. I still find myself trying to name the very locations that were shot. The diner where they all meet was the Florida Avenue Grill and it is still there today. Needless to say, DC Cab holds very fond memories for me of an era long since dead.

I think he probably udnerwent some special training in preparation for his role, kinda like how Dustin Hoffman hung out with autistic people before making ""Rain Man."" The amount of research Mr. T put into his part in this film is simply astounding. When Mr. T wants the cab to go left, he turns the wheel to the left rather than rely on some cheesy special effects to make it look like he turned the wheel to the left.

With daily robberies, broken down cabs, and disgruntled employees added into the mix Harold tries to keep it all together being optimistic hoping that things will make a turn for the better instead of the worst.

857351,4,6304375344,"While watching D.C. Cab (1983) last night, I couldn't help but think how different this film might be had it been made today instead of some twenty years ago.  There'd probably be no nudity (there's some in here), and much of the off color humor would surely be removed.  As far as who would star in it?  I wouldn't even begin to speculate...my point is, the early to mid 80's was a particularly interesting time for comedies, as studios hadn't quite realized the lucrative nature of the teen market (this is why so many films now have their R-rated material watered down to get the much sought after PG-13 rating), and we hadn't yet known the joys of being politically correct, as people could still make jokes about anybody, despite their race, without it being considered a racial slur and creating a national incident (but never fear, it's still okay to make fun of Whitey...that never goes out of style).  Written and directed by Joel Schumacher (The Lost Boys, Batman & Robin), the film actually has no lead star, focusing more on an ensemble cast featuring Adam Baldwin (he played Ricky Linderman in the film My Bodyguard), Max Gail (most will probably remember him as Detective Stan 'Wojo' Wojciehowicz from TV's Barney Miller), Mr. T, Charlie Barnett (who reminds me of a cross between Dave Chappelle and Chris Tucker), Gary `Mr. Head Injury' Busey (The Buddy Holly Story, Lethal Weapon), Marsha Warfield (""Night Court""), Bill Maher (Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death), DeWayne Jessie (who will always be remembered by me as Otis Day, from the film Animal House), Paul Rodriguez (Born in East L.A.), Whitman Mayo (better known as Grady, from TV's Sanford and Son), muscle bound twins Peter and David Paul aka The Barbarian Brothers (The Barbarians), and Ms. Irene `What a Feeling' Cara.

On the outset, we see Albert Hockenberry (Baldwin) arriving in Washington D.C. on the back of a turnip truck, literally (well, he was on the back of a truck, but whether or not there were any turnips is subject to debate).  Albert, who, until recently, resided in `The Sticks' (that's everything east of California and west of New York, or so I'm told), is looking up Harold (Gail), a friend of his recently deceased father, as Albert has ambitions of being a cab driver (don't aim too high there Albert), and Harold owns a floundering cab company called D.C. Cab, which also happens to be the title of the film...didn't that work out nicely?  Anyway, Albert begins learning the ropes from Harold and his motley crew, but trouble is never far away as the company is constantly being threatened to be shut down by the city, the bank is on the verge of foreclosing, the cabs are falling apart, they can't afford grease the local palms for access to areas that offer more lucrative fares (the airport, for example), and employee dissatisfaction is at an all time high.  The situation seems dire, but an opportunity does present itself, and now the drivers must decide whether or not to take the money and run, or risk their newfound wealth by re-investing it into company, becoming partners.  Oh yeah, there's also a kidnapping plot near the end...

I've always had a soft spot in my heart (or my head) for this film, despite its shortcomings.  Looking at the DVD case you'd think Mr. T is the star, but he has a relatively minor role.  His prominence in the advertising was due to, not only he being a colorful character, but also his popularity stemming from appearing in the very popular Rocky III, as Clubber Lang, a year earlier.  I think the main problem with the film is the lack of a strong lead, such as Steve Guttenberg's character in the film Police Academy, which also featured an ensemble cast.  Some films can get away with it, like Animal House, but that's because in a film like that, each character is infused with very real, individualistic nature very early on, providing a sense of familiarity in terms of being able to say you either knew, or know someone like that....regardless, the film is still pretty funny, if not formulaic (the whole `let's pull together and save the [fill in the blank] before they close us down' routine).  I didn't really buy Adam Baldwin's nave hillbilly routine, but the others were fun to watch, especially Charlie Barnett, Mr. T, and Gary Busey.  The film does have a number of memorable and quotable lines, one of which I used for my title, and was used in one of my favorite scenes.  The set up is Albert, along with two, young children of a local ambassador, get kidnapped, and the ambassador is at his home, surrounded by police and recording equipment, waiting for the kidnappers to call with their demands.  The phone rings, he answers, and it turns out to be a seductive, female voice referring to the ambassador as `Stud Muffins', which could be heard by all, especially the ambassador's wife, who is now giving him the dirtiest look I've ever seen.  He claims it was a wrong number, and shortly afterwards the phone rings again, the ambassador is hesitant to pick up, and his wife utters the line from my title...it's funnier seeing it than having me explain it, really.  Most of the humor is silly, often stupid, and I would normally give this film 3 stars, but it did make me laugh, and I'm feeling a little nostalgic, so I will go with 4 stars.  If you like this film (even if you didn't), I would recommend checking out The Hollywood Knights (1980).

The widescreen anamorphic picture on this DVD looks very sharp, and the audio (Dolby Digital 2.0) comes through clear.  There are no special features (given the price I wasn't expecting a lot), not even a menu, as the film starts the moment the DVD is put into a player.

The story is about a cab company in DC with comedy galore, it would have been better if Grady from Sanford and son wasn't in it, I think they should have put Bubba in it, maybe it would have won more academy awards. Bubba was always underated as an actor but I always new he was the funny one and Grady knew Fred liked him more, I agree that Chico and Rolo were shifty. Also Wojo from Barney Miller is in the movie but here he doesnt have a bowl haircut he is balding. I laugh everytime I watch this movie and I bought a copy in VHS and the cover makes me laugh because MrT is on the cover and that is funny. The musical score of the film by composer Don Brown was just right for the movie I wish I could get the soundtrack. This movie also has Gary Busey, Paul Rodrigez, Bill Maher, Jeff Kahrs and a cameo by character actor Bryan Buckley (Huggy Bear's cousin on Starsky and Hutch) I cant wait for the DVD version to come out. Watch this movie and enjoy yourself.",983491200,3,1099,3.97737556561086
857467,4,6304375344,"Ok...throw in Gary Busey, Mr. T (remember him?), Paul Rodriguez, Mr. Rhythm, Bill Maher (way early days!), and you've got one really bad movie! However if you like insane mindless fun this is definitely a great flick. The acting is terrible, the story is predictable, but the general mindless humor is too much. Frankly this is a complete love/hate kind of movie, with a cult classic status!

Quick synopsis.  A cab company is swiftly being driven out of business by it's competition.  The cabbies all have bad attitudes and are content to await the inevitable.  Along comes junior who brings purpose and pride back to the cabbies, eventually booting their competition out of town and saving the day.

Along the way great character development occurs as you explore the personal tragedies and problems of some of the cabbies and see them overcome their fears, problems, and issues.  How many guys do you know that yell at their wife trying to find their flamethrower???

The humor in this movie is much along the lines of old Saturday Night Live.  It doesn't take itself seriously, which is why it works.",973296000,,1104,4.835106382978723
857468,5,6304375344,"Before Joel S. killed Batman he made this movie and it was a fun ride, if you didn't like it you are way too serious, the movie was meant to be fun AND funny, how could you not think Gary Busey was hilarious? and the Noogman? this movie even had Grady from Sanford and Son in it! everybody loved Grady! Grady loved the color purple (not the movie, the color) he liked purple sheets because if he slept on flower sheets he felt like he was waking up in a field. Now I could understand people not liking this movie if it had Rolo or Bubba in it, they were shifty and the same goes for Chico and his goat, but I guess Aunt Esta would have been good in it (Churchs gotta love it!) I reckon this movie is better than eatin some french fried bertatoes with some biscuits and gravy. umm humm.",970444800,,785,4.103896103896104

857470,5,6304375344,"An enjoyable movie that I considered to be a ""sleeper"" at the box office.  I found it relaxing and fun.  However, this particular tape was recorded in LP speed. The sound was poor like that can occur on an EP  recording. Color needed adjusting as did tracking ... like an EP recording.  Legit videos are *not* copied in the slower speeds like this one.  The  graphics on the box even looked like something that had been copied and  reproduced slightly off.  I suspect that this particular tape was a pirate  copy.",941846400,,513,4.549450549450549
