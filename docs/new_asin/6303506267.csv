3966181,5,6303506267,A fun filled nostalgic movie for those of us who remember actors like Bela Lugosi and Lionel Atwill.  If you are a fan of the 'oldies' than this is for you.,1448064000,,156,4.032258064516129
3966182,5,6303506267,"I love the old black and white movies. The ""Night Monster"" has a great cast of actors, I especially like Bela Lugosi and Lionel Atwill, and this movie offers both. I've waited years for this movie to come out in DVD form. I like shopping for my movies at Amazon because they always offer the best deals......I urge you to try the movie ""Night Monster"" and Amazon, you won't be disappointed !!!",1429228800,4,393,4.472222222222222
3966183,3,6303506267,"Solid and thoughtful horror film from Hollywood's Golden Age...very entertaining and creepy, rarely seen on cable...priced right...very solid cast",1426982400,2,146,6.7368421052631575
3966184,5,6303506267,"One of the best but overlooked Universal Monster movies but it's not really a monster movie more a mystery thriller. Of course you have the
big house in the middle of ???? the swamp? fog and a bunch of people who are invited to the house and one by one murdered along with
the maid who knew too much! the Butler is played by Lugosi who should have had a bigger role but of course they make you think he's the
killer when it's obvious he's not! Shame on Universal wasting his talent! But  the story is well written acted directed and great ending. It's a
lot better than some of the other Universal Horror that gets more praise and attention. Too bad. Good Good Movie!",1426377600,4,667,4.2936507936507935
3966185,5,6303506267,what a kick - hadn't seen it in years and was just as cool as i remember (and now i can watch with my grandson - when i used to have to stay up late - all by myself - and get the creeps!,1424044800,2,186,3.25

3966187,5,6303506267,"Night Monster is a little gem of a horror flick. The story is predictably preposterous, but that doesn't matter when it comes to Universal horror of the 30's and 40's. But what a spooky and atmospherically directed picture it is! The logical thing to do when people start turning up murdered in their rooms in a house you are staying in would be to split the scene, right? Wrong. Everyone goes to bed at night as if they were at a murder mystery themed bed and breakfast. Meanwhile Bela Lugosi is walking the halls, a weird swami is materializing skeletons dripping blood, the house keeper looks like she's the first cousin of Judith Anderson from Hitchcock's Rebecca and the adult daughter acts like she ran out of her prescriptions a fortnight ago. AND there's bodies been turning up with big splotches of blood next to them for weeks. No problem. Let's all get a good night's sleep. Okay...Anyway, I almost wrote that Lugosi is wasted as the red herring butler, but any Lugosi is better than no Lugosi. He pretty much enters through doors and talks on the telephone most of the film. He would, and us, would have been better served as the swami, but...And Lionel Atwill also has a minor role, but makes the most of it. A film that Hitchcock viewed and liked, Night Monster was picture I saw a few times when I was a kid and it gave me the creeps. So glad to own it now. A real treat in the B list of Universal horror, but almost at the top of that list.",1418601600,7,1456,4.396296296296296
3966188,4,6303506267,"This film is a hybrid of horror/murder-mystery/thriller and is one of Universal's least talked about films. The atmosphere is rich, the cast is excellent and those wonderfuls set!.....fantastic! Lugosi is good, but deserves more than a small role. This is available on DVD on a 5 film set Universal Horror a Best Buy exclusive. It's a limited edition so hurry! The tranfers are good for all 5 films and there are some trailers.",1204675200,,427,4.863013698630137
8377433,4,6303506267,"I saw this movie when I was small, and it was very memorable and scary to me, so I decided to take this trip down memory lane, but I was a little disappointed that it didn't seem so scary, but enjoyable nonetheless.",1526947200,,215,4.142857142857143
8377434,3,6303506267,"Night Monster is one hour and thirteen minutes and was released in theaters on October 20, 1942. The main story is that Kurt Ingston is a cripple who is bound to a wheelchair and he blames the three doctors who operated on him for his condition. For the past several months he has been studying mind over matter with Eastern mystic named Agar Singh. He wants to use this power to regain the use of his arms and legs so he can murder the three doctors who did this to him. The only problem is that he cannot fully control his mind over matter because he leaves a blood trail. Though I cannot pin point which one, the opening music seems similar to one of the early Frankenstein movies. Overall Night Monster gets an C+.",1515888000,,718,4.325925925925926
8377435,4,6303506267,"When I was in my mid-teens, Universal Pictures' Shock Theater hit the late-night TV schedule with a boom. Famous Monsters of Filmland magazine was already established as a cultural force, Editor Forrest J. Ackerman praised nearly everything in the horror genre as ""a classic."" Anything with Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi or Lon Chaney Sr. and Jr. automatically qualified, even though Lugosi's career took a decided downturn after the 1940s and he made some real stinkers.. Fortunately, most of Lugosi's work for Universal was worth watching. So when I recently started collecting monster movies again, I faintly remembered ""Night Monster"" as being one of his better movies, bought it from Amazon and it more than lived up to my expectations.  Although top-billed, Lugosi is not the star per se, but, as part of a fine ensemble cast, he gets frequent opportunitiess to show off his acting range -- everything from haughty menace to comedic flourishes -- as the mysterious butler who seems to be everywhere disaster strikes. And strike it does, as wheelchair-bound Frank Morgan plays host to a trio of doctors (including horror film stalwart Lionel Atwill) whose incompetence left him in a quite ghastly condition. Some scenes make no sense at all, but veteran director Ford Beebe, who made mostly B-westerns and serials, keeps the pace so frenzied that there's no time to ponder the inconsistent behavior of some of the characters. The plot is pure hokum, but it is nevertheless one of the best ""old dark house"" thrillers. .Have fun!",1515542400,,1529,5.067460317460317

8377437,5,6303506267,"I had never heard of this movie and just bought it on a whim and I'm sure glad I did!  This is really a great B-movie mystery centering around a man unintentionally crippled by the treatment from three doctors who are invited to his (creepy) mansion to discuss donations for the advancement of medical treatments.  And, oops, the doctors and others are all of a sudden being murdered one by one.  Plenty of suspects including Bela Lugosi as the omnipresent butler.  I have found these Universal Vault Series releases to be excellent transfers to DVD with great picture and sound.  Have a lot of fun with this one!",1488067200,,613,4.638888888888889
8377438,5,6303506267,I really enjoyed watching this movie. It showed the consequences of letting revenge consume one's life. I especially liked the ending where the mystic tells the others that there are consequences when using something for evil as it will lead to one's destruction. I highly recommend this movie to anyone. I also highly recommend this seller to anyone.,1473811200,,351,5.068965517241379
8377439,3,6303506267,"Night Monster, 1942 film

A locked gate protects a big house. The housekeeper scrubs stairs, a resident comments on this. Go to your room! Servants must not use the telephone for personal use, says the butler. The maid gets a ride to town. Three doctors arrive at the Hillsdale train station to go to Kingston Towers. Melissa returned for her things; will she stay the night? She is told her driver left her! There is a squeaking door, a woman screams! There is fog at night. A couple arrive in a car. Margaret called Dr. Harper. The people gather for dinner. Did Miss Kingston change her mind? Dr. Harper cant leave tonight. Margaret wants to talk to her in private. Mr. Kingston talks about his operation. Amar Singh tells about cosmic substance. He performs an experiment. Can a skeleton drip blood? The skeleton disappeared!

The local constable arrived to question the visitors. Millie was found murdered! There was a footprint by the body. Later Dr. King is found strangled! What is that blood spot? Who did it? The undertaker collects a body. In fiction the murderer is the one least likely to be a suspect. [Is this a clue?] Then Dr. Timmons is murdered, strangled like the first victim. Amar Singh thinks he knows who is guilty, but he has no proof. The chauffeur warns the last doctor to leave. Margaret is asked who killed the doctors, but she won't say (at first). Is she credible? Dr. Phipps is found strangled; they find a secret door in the wall. Curt Kingston is questioned, he really is crippled with a missing arm. Then the chauffeur is no longer a suspect! That couple flee the house. They are followed until a shot is fired. The mystery is solved.

This story probably sounded good when written, but shows its faults when turned into a movie. French criminologists invented the technique of recreating a crime to test eyewitness testimony. This revealed any inconsistencies. Could a 140 pound man have overpowered and strangled three younger men and a strong servant? No. Many horror stories use the plot where a person turns into a monster (Dracula, The Wolfman, etc.). Somehow these supernatural events seem more credible since you suspend realistic thinking to watch them. Besides, they seem more comic than horrible after many decades.",1471132800,,2259,4.81701030927835
8377440,4,6303506267,"A group of doctors gathers at the notorious Ingston mansion, only to spend an evening experiencing horror upon horror... or something like that. Basically, an ""old dark house"" sort of film, there's the requisite gaggle of visitors, a mysterious mystic -complete w/ groovy turban, several murders, and magically-appearing bloodstains! While not at all scary, it's still a lot of fun to watch! NIGHT MONSTER stars Bela Lugosi (DRACULA, THE WOLF MAN, THE RETURN OF THE VAMPIRE) as the nasty butler, Rolf, Lionel Atwill (DOCTOR X, THE VAMPIRE BAT, MYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM, SON OF FRANKENSTEIN) as Dr. King, Ralph Morgan (CONDEMNED TO LIVE, THE MONSTER MAKER) as Kurt Ingston, and Leif Erickson (INVADERS FROM MARS) as Laurie, the womanizing, he-man chauffeur.
