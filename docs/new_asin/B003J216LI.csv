8397806,5,B003J216LI,Adore this movie.  The writing is spectacular.  I cry laughing everytime I watch it. Be warned it is a special brand of humor... my brand.,1470960000,,138,4.48
8397807,3,B003J216LI,"This movie was decent, but it doesn't have much of a re-watch value.  You can tell when you watch it that it was done very low budget, so you have to like small, low budget films to enjoy it.  Many of the jokes seemed forced, and were mostly there to show what an awful person the lead character is.  As a result, the viewer finds it difficult to identify with the lead character.  The lead character could have been like Barney on How I Met Your Mother where you hate him for what he does, but you like him because he is funny.  Instead, I found myself comparing the lead character to ""The Todd"" from Scrubs where you cringe every time he opens his mouth, and find it unbelievable that any woman would ever talk to him.  All in all, I would say that this movie is average.  It is not bad, but it is not really good either.  It would be a forgettable movie if an eating disorder was not one of the main plot points, but as it stands that was really the only memorable part of the film.",1356480000,,985,4.12041884816754
8397808,3,B003J216LI,"I didn't watch the whole thing from start to finish, I kind of scanned through it.  I didn't see any nudity when I scanned it.  There were a couple of bra and panty shots...

It was a very funny plot from what I saw, that's what made it worth watching.",1291334400,,252,4.0
8397809,5,B003J216LI,"A very skilled, immoral tale about a guy who never gives up trying to get women in bed, despite his looks and kind of crappy attitude.  The story takes off when this dude becomes obessed over a bulimic girl - and then joins her group to try to get her in bed.  The group requires that this guy, THE SNAKE, partners with a different addict every week.  Of course, it's never the bullimic girl he likes and he has to pretend he has an eating disorder or in some cases, go to bed with whichever said girl he's sponsoring.  This movie is immoral, dark, politically incorrect, the way comedies should be.  Maraget Cho even shows up for one very funny scene.",1277510400,,652,4.355371900826446
