7114101,1,B00VYL4RIA,"this wasn't good. slow... weird.. and just not really good. i didn't know if she was dealing with a real human being, an alien from space or an entity. it was like they went in one direction and then changed the script and went in another direction, but while filming decided to film whole 'nother film. i would rather have glass powder thrown in my eyes than watch this movie again. one star was too many",1437523200,,405,4.342105263157895
7114102,3,B00VYL4RIA,"Kind of an odd choice to make a sequel, loved the first movie and didn't expect much here, but its actually not bad. Competently acted and the direction is pretty decent. The story definitely has some plusses to it but where the movie really falls on its face is the attempts at scares. They recycle the same idea over and over again. Ghostly dead person appears behind the main character, and then again, and again, and again. Even a casual horror fan will get bored and see it coming a mile away. Doesnt do anything to add to the first movie, best to view it as a standalone.  This one is a totally watchable horror flick, just don't expect anything special. At all.",1436572800,3,668,4.430894308943089
8711726,4,B00VYL4RIA,I liked the first movie and as other reviewers seem to agree this sequel is not quite as good as the first but it is more graphic and still well acted and written. Worth a watch if you like The Pact.,1488844800,,199,3.8780487804878048

8711729,1,B00VYL4RIA,"The Pact is hands down one of the best horror films of the last decade. The first one was able to pull off tension, terror and an overwhelming sense dread in every shot.

The Pact 2 almost cancels out everything the original was intent on doing. Instead of picking up immediately where the first one left one, we are given a half-baked plot. The original cast comes back only for cameos which killed the character development. Annie was the final girl of the first, here her presence is only a whimper.

Unfortunately this film made me angry and I almost don't consider it canon to the first due to the quality. If they make Part III, they are going to have to redo some of the silliness that was the 2nd one.",1460505600,,709,4.363636363636363
8711730,4,B00VYL4RIA,I enjoyed this movie. I did not think it was too slow like some did. It was spooky to me & interesting in that you had two things going on to try & figure out.,1446595200,,159,3.5714285714285716

8711735,2,B00VYL4RIA,"One of my favorite lower budget horror films of the past few years was 2012s The Pact, an imaginative and original thriller/supernatural horror written and Directed by Nicholas McCarthy.  The first thing you have to know about the sequel is that McCarththy is not involved and that is NOT a good thing.  The sequel is written and directed by the team of Dallas Richard Hallam and Patrick Horvath.

The Pact 2 picks up just a few weeks after the first film in the wake of the bloody rampage of a serial killer Charles Barlow, known as The Judas Killer.  June (Luddington) is a crime scene cleaner and aspiring artist living with her boyfriend Daniel (Foster) who is a patrol cop.  A new murder occur which as striking similarities to the Judas Killers MO which causes the police to fear there is a copycat killer.  An FBI profiler named Ballard (Fischler), wrapping up his work on the Judas Killer work and decides to investigate.  June meanwhile is having nightmares of murders and sees the first victim in her dreams.pact cover

When Junes mother becomes another victim of the copycat, she learns that events from her past have set her up as a target for the killer.  Now haunted by the spirits of the two victims, June is desperate for help and reaches out to Annie Barlow (Lotz) who was responsible for killing Barlow in the first film.  The pair attempt to reach out to the spirits for aid before the killer can get to June.

The fact that Nicholas McCarthy was not involved in the sequel indicates to me that he told the story he wanted to tell and there is no reason to revisit the events.  Someone else obviously felt differently but the fact is that while The Pact 2 is not a bad film, there was simply no reason for a sequel.  Hallam and Horvath lack McCarthys skill for subtle horror and instead go for a bushel full of gotcha moments when one of the gruesome spirits shows their face.  They employ this tactic over and over until you expect it around every corner.  The story is needlessly muddled with sub-plots which ultimately play no importance in the story.

Caity Lotz and Haley Hudson reprise their roles from the original film with Hudson again playing the spooky psychic, Stevie.  Lotz, who played The Black Canary in the TV series Arrow and will play White Canary in the upcoming Legends of Tomorrow, looks positively bored as she basically sleep-walks performance.  Hudson was again creepy and kooky as Stevie in a role that was far too short.  Patrick Fischler (Mad Men) was terrific as the quirky FBI Profiler Ballard and he steals the show.

The Pact 2 is a needless sequel but it has some positives however it helps to see the original first.
