8222402,4,B000WC395E,"I am reviewing the dvd itself not the anime as a whole.  Well unto the review.

Pro:
The plot thickens and there's more character development than previous volumes (we finally get to know Hanai's and Mikoto's story as well as getting introduced to a new character).  The dvd ends on a cliffhanger which viewers are enticed to find out what happens next.  There are new realtionships that are developing, which is ok for this series as there are so many characters and you would like to know who has feelings for who.  Also, who can forget about the magnets (though DVD 1 had the best magnets IMO)

Con:
The dvd only contains 4 episodes, down 1 from previous dvds.  The extras are similar from previous installments as well.

Conclusion:
If you are fan of the series, than it's an absolute must to purchase this dvd.  If you are new to the series, I recommend buying the first dvd as you will be confused to jump into the series from this volume.  Casual viewers might find this volume to be much better than the first 2 as it has situations that viewers can understand (non anime viewers to be precise, the first 2 relies heavily on anime fandom).

P.S. Please read my other dvd reviews for school rumble.",1196294400,2,1205,4.506912442396313
