2383846,5,B000AAD8HW,"This is one of the better precursors of the profiler crime dramas that you are watching today.  Shows, like, ""Criminal Minds"", etc., owe much of their background history and general acceptance on TV to these early shows where special profiling units within the FBI and CIA were made up of one or two people, at most.  Now, with jets and well funded teams they get the hard cases resolved using their unique and commonly acceptable approach.  The best detectives, since Sam Spade and before, have always had a little extra sense about what they were after, being able to see the indicating subtleties at which most others were just looking.  What is critical in any show is the chemistry involved within, among and between the characters.  That is where a good, profiling casting-responsible director and producer come into play.  It is as important as the episode issues and the storylines undertaken.  This show is very special in that way, using Ally Walker and her partner, Robert Davi, so well together that it resulted in interactions and show dynamics at the highest plain and as no other TV pair.  The interesting episode-crossing into the lighter-weight, ""The Pretender"", was very creative.  She saw the difference in Jarod and he in her, helping each other as they occasionally crossed paths, while accidentally finding themselves working on the same case.  Satisfying to watch was that.  Jarod usually showed his stuff and outmatched her, but he knew she knew.  It always seemed they both had that look in their eye that they just had to someday come back and get to know the other, once they had a little downtime.  Fun to watch, was that.  I ordered the complete Boxed Set of all years from Amazon and marathoned the entire Series, back-to-back.  That is, of course, the only way to do it. Get a bunch of junk food, turn off the phones and just do it.  You'll never internalize a Series in a better way.  Don't have the time?  Too bad.  Those who marathon know what I am talking about. Get your 2, or 3, or 400-disc player set up and do it right. You also find out who your friends are.",1218585600,5,2098,4.667574931880109
2383847,4,B000AAD8HW,"I was one of those die-hard fans who had EVERY EPISODE on VHS except that pesky one or two. Lucky for everyone with old VHS hand-taped versions of the show, these great (and OMG commercial-free) DVDs are definitely worth the money if you were hard hit by the show's cancellation.

I wouldn't count on never-before-seen episodes or cast interviews in this set (at least in what I've viewed so far) but who really buys sets for the ""extras""?

I give it two thumbs and two big toes up!

The price is a little steap compared to other sets, for instance West Wing season 2 is going for $45 whereas Profiler season 3 is going for $89 ($99 in stores) and the series wasn't even as popular.  I give it four stars for the price, and the fact that I had to get someone to buy Season 3 from me while I purchased the set.  Purchasing each individual season would have cost me a total of $400 (not including tax)...I can buy two seasons of West Wing for every one season of Profiler.",1125964800,15,970,4.3076923076923075

8077190,5,B000AAD8HW,"my favorite show. so glad amazon had it. its hard to find copies of ""older"" classic shows, but amazon is the best place to look.",1376092800,,128,4.16
8077191,4,B000AAD8HW,"The show is like an early mix of concepts from The Mentalist and Criminal minds.  The show itself was not disappointing.  However, as far as the product - I was disappointed that closed captions were not available - and as was on TV during those years - there is a lot of ""whispering"" and you have to turn the TV volume way up to hear it and then get blasted when louder sounds come back on.

The product was delivered timely and in good shape.",1372377600,4,444,4.2
8077192,5,B000AAD8HW,Bought for son and he really likes them.  He used to watch this on television when he was younger and requested the series when saw it was available.,1359158400,,149,4.321428571428571
8077193,5,B000AAD8HW,"I'm very happy that I bought this box set of all four seasons.  I've always loved this show, but didn't get a chance to see all four seasons.  In response to some of these reviews about the price,[...]  This item is very well packaged.  Each disc is in its own individual case, which I think is very nice.  Each episode is presented exactly as it had appeared on tv without any editing. When you select the episode that you want to watch, a brief synopsis is given of the episode.  I think that NBC with A&E Entertainment did an excellent job.  I, for one, am very happy with this purchase. I have come across some extras on the dvds. I don't see how anyone can be disappointed with this item.  I highly recommend buying it to anyone.  I don't think that you can go wrong with purchasing this set.",1295654400,,797,4.295302013422819
8077194,5,B000AAD8HW,"Fantastic series. It's sort of a cheesy horror version of Law and Order, but I was hooked enough after watching the first season that I requested the rest of the series for a birthday gift.",1285113600,,189,4.428571428571429
8077195,1,B000AAD8HW,"I recently purchased the Profiler Seasons 1-4 and had to return them for a refund since they were not in Closed Caption as stated in the description.  I have been trying to find out for future reference how I can be sure that when I purchase others that are described to be in Closed Caption they are indeed captioned.  For those of use who are deaf or hearing impaired captioning is a necessity and I have always relied on checking to make sure it is either captioned or subtitles before making a purchase, now I feel that I can no longer rely on this and since I have other movies and series I would like to order I cannot seem to find anyone who will make sure the descriptions are correct.  I would not of ordered this series except for the fact that is was supposed to be captioned.  Having made many purchases for years with Amazon.com and been satisfied with everything up until this happened and they seem to be very lax in making changes since this set is still advertised to be closed captioned and so I say to those of us who need this please beware of false advertising.  It is hard to rate this item since I was not able to watch it.",1279756800,11,1146,4.2626728110599075
8077196,5,B000AAD8HW,items were deliveried very quickly.  extremely minor brusing on boxes so they look brand new.  dvd's were in perfect condition no scratches or chips on any of them.  i would purchase from this seller again.,1228003200,2,206,4.828571428571428
