I checked the ""chapters"" and it seemed to imply not only that ""Do they know it's Christmas"" but also ""Tears are not enough"" and ""We are the world"" would be on the DVD.  None of them were, there was basically 36 minutes of outtakes from interviews.  No new info, no music.  What a waste of money!!!!!!",1276992000,3,404,4.075949367088608
2951176,1,B000VSDNE6,"If you are hoping to see the original video then you are in for a major disappointment.
The documentary was weak at best....other than some interviews with Bob Geldoff and Midge Ure, you only got to catch glimpses of SOME of the other performers.  The video documented very  briefly about Live Aid, USA For Africa,  and Canada's effort with ""Tears Are Not Enough""....but once again, you didn't get to see the videos....only little glimpses here and there of the stars.
This was truly a complete waste of money and my time to view it.",1219276800,11,533,4.648936170212766
2951177,2,B000VSDNE6,"This is one of a series of 12 reasonably priced ($9.99 list) DVDs released in the US by SRO (Part of Kultur International) under the umbrella ""Impact: Songs That Changed The World"". Each runs about 24 minutes as it was co-produced by Canadian TV and broadcast on the cable CMT network in the US in 2002 and 2003.

I could tell from the quality of the editing - even before I saw the end credits - that this was produced by Gregory Hall. Hall - who also makes music documentaries under his own Hallmark Productions banner - has been cranking these out for about 20 years now. I first saw his Country Music bios. They've always been well edited and usually contain great interview ""sound bites"". The four volumes in this series that I've watched so far are no exception. Some of the interviews were recent at the time of the show's production while some go back to the 80s and 90s and have appeared in other Hall productions. (You can tell by the locations where they were taped.)

Most of the Impact series DVDs cover more than the single records that are the topics. They also cover the impact that artist - at that point in time - had on our culture from style of dress to style of music.

In the case of the Band Aid volume the focus expands to successor group tributes such as ""we Are The World"" in the US and the Canadian tribute (after all this series was made for Canadian TV). There's lots of Bob Geldolf here. Personally, this is the weakest of the series I've viewed so far.  Check out the others in the series first. I gave them all higher ratings.

These DVDS will leave a legacy to the next generation and can be very useful in, not only music history classes but in the study of late 20th century ""pop culture"".

2951179,1,B000VSDNE6,"This is NOT the original 'making of' documentary that also contained the video single.  Instead, it's a 'new' documentary about Band Aid and is made up of clips from the original documentary and some new interviews.  It's short, only 23 minutes, so do not expect any kind of in-depth information.  Basically, it's a 'hack' program with no original analysis or scholarship.  Those expecting the original documentary and song/video will be sorely disappointed.  The DVD jacket does NOT make it clear that it is a new program either.  AVOID if you are looking for the original 1984 song and making of documentary (which, BTW, has NOT been released on DVD yet - only VHS, Beta in the USA and LaserDisc in Japan - hopefully, we'll get an HD-DVD of the original program.)",1195776000,41,765,4.801526717557252

8219782,3,B000VSDNE6,"It tells the story behind the Band-Aid song, then the Live Aid concert. It then shows the influence on USA's ""We Are the World"" and Canada's ""Tears Are Not Enough"" (this is the only footage I've ever seen of that, and it's in rough shape). It's only about 25 minutes long, and there's very limited studio or concert footage, but it does a good job of summarizing the ""impact"" (hence the title of this series) made by Bob Geldof and Band Aid. This was made in 2003, so it does not mention the Live 8 concert. This is good for people who just want a quick overview of the importance of the whole thing, but nothing deep. It may make you want to see more, like the video or concert footage. The only bonus feature are promo clips of other ""Impact! Songs That Changed the World"" dvd's from the series.

I own the Live Aid and Live 8 DVD sets, and the ""We Are the World"" 2-dvd set. Both Live Aid sets give you the most bang for your buck, and the We Are the World is usually way overpriced (wait to find it on sale). I wish there was a ""Tears Are Not Enough"" dvd.",1457740800,,1058,4.135922330097087
