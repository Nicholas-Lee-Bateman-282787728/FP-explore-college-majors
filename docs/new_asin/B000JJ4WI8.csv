Because of that, I ended up buying all the volumes separately to complete my set rather than buying any of the complete sets (Viridian Collection, S.A.V.E.). I'm glad I was forced to buy them this way, though. The art on each box is beautiful, and I love the collector's cards and booklets that come in them. Definitely worth the money if you're a collector.

This series is AMAZING. Definitely one of my favourite animes of all time. It's not only beautifully drawn (the character designs and art style really make this one stand out), but the writing is phenomenal. The show is very dark (with some lighter moments here and there), and the depth of the storyline will blow you away by the end of the series. It includes action, adult, and political issues throughout the entire series, and very tastefully done. I make sure to always recommend this one to people. I'm still blown away by how few people have actually seen this series. I think most people would like this whether they like anime or not.

It's too bad this series was done when fullscreen was just barely starting to phase out. The only thing that could possibly make this show better is if it had been done in Widescreen HD.",1374537600,,1306,4.600858369098712
8150634,4,B000JJ4WI8,"The city of Tokyo is on the brink of financial collapse. Suitengu is in league with the Prime Minister. They have a plot to break the city and take all the wealth for themselves. Suitengu's past come to light and gives us an idea why he does the things he does. Saiga and Kagura are the only ones that can save the city.

This anime starts off with a bang. It's a constant thrill ride with some cool characters that have alarming special powers. The animation, voice acting, soundtrack, and plot are all very well done. This anime is very strange. The premise is very original and kinda takes you by surprise. If you've seen Eyes Wide Shut, you can kind of get a feel for the type of vibe this show has. It's not as perverted as Eyes Wide Shut, and this is mainly an action series,but the mood is very similar. I really enjoyed it and recommend it to anime fans that don't mind a little weirdness sprinkled in with their anime.",1355011200,,927,4.327586206896552
