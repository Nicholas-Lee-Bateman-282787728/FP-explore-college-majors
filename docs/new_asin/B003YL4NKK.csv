Well, as we continue to work our way through these trailer discs from Montreal Film Studio, I'm beginning to see a pattern...a lot of the films on this disc probably never saw the light of day in theatres. But then again, that's why it's VHS Rewind - most of these were from videos in the 1980s, although they have some excellent prints of classic trailers like Friday The 13th and The Fog among the offerings this time. And it's the shortest collection so far, coming in at just under 90 minutes- the rest run nearly 2 hours. But all in all, definitely worth the time and expense...love those bad trailers...heh heh heh...

-Time/Life Great Programs end-

The VHS ads are hilarious to see - now I feel old... my first VCR was one of those clunkers! And the Time/Life TV ads for ""The Great Programs"" was an exclusive Betamax offering - hilarious!

We've purchased the whole library of these discs now, so reviews of the discs that follow this one will be forthcoming in the days ahead..

In short - lots of fun as always - and now theres three or four I actually want to find to see if they're as awful as they look in the trailer..call me a masochist...:-)",1345593600,2,2267,5.032
