8559319,5,B00AYOCN0W,"The show Im reviewing is Catfish: TV Show. It has had four seasons and 38 episodes and the genre is Reality TV.  It comes on at 10pm on MTV on Wednesday. The show has funny host , interesting plot and shocking episodes.
 Catfish has two host who are Nev Schulman and Max Joseph. They are hilarious and entertaining. Max is more short temper and Nev has much more patient expect for when he threw someones phone in a river. Nev does more of the research and talking to people and Max is into the filming. I cant really choose between Nev and Max because there both perfect.
 The show is about people who meet online but one of them is lying, most of the time. When they meet Nev and Max the person tells them what they know then they go and do research. They finally meet the catfisher, the person who tricked them and confront them. Sometimes the person is nice or a complete jerk. The catfisher always has a chance to tell their side of the story most of them feel really bad.",1427673600,3,977,4.27027027027027

8559322,5,B00AYOCN0W,"I am currently in an online relationship that has lasted over 1 year, and he has been in the United States, and over seas in the military.  I appreciate this show, since I may be living it.  I have considered contacting the show several times, but have not, because we keep thinking we are about to meet.  I think it is a fantastic show, and does good for people at the same time.  I enjoy it, and am about to buy season 2.",1395273600,2,423,4.0602409638554215
8559323,5,B00AYOCN0W,"Nev helps people in relationships like he was in, in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Catfish/dp/B004FP1WX0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Catfish</a>. He and his friend accept these people's request and go visit them.  Then, they do some research and return with what they think they have found.  From there they all go and meet the person on the other end of the relationship.

At times like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jaws/dp/B008XBHIEY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jaws</a>&nbsp;at times like 'Cheaters', we never know what is going to happen.  Some are gals who pose as a guy, some are a guy who pose as a girl, unreal.  I wonder if maybe they should just not find out, they usually never end well. Addictive.

Extras include a reunion show and several times Nev gives advice to people that ask for his help.  At times heartbreaking.  You will not forget the experience.

8559325,5,B00AYOCN0W,"Each episode is well made and full of surprises - I would recommend buying this DVD, and I'd buy it myself if it wasn't locked to region code 1!

Please MTV, help international viewers to enjoy your DVDs by considering making them region free. My DVD player can play NTSC - but can only play DVDs with region 2 or region-free encodings.
