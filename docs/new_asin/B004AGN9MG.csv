4309274,5,B004AGN9MG,This is one of the funniest Shaun The Sheep videos I have ever seen! Everyone in my family was LOL!,1344902400,,99,4.0
4309275,3,B004AGN9MG,"I LOVE shaun the sheep!!!  I watch the complete first season over and over again (I'm 33 by the way) and love it as much as the kids do. However, I didn't really like the ""new"" shaun the sheep or the new story lines. The new claymation figures are harsh and the stories were kind of blah. I don't know if I will be buying another Shaun the Sheep DVD anytime soon. I think I will check them out on Netflix first before I invest in another for the collection. For now, I don't plan on watching this DVD again myself, but I am sure the kids will continue to like the stories and characters.",1315958400,2,587,4.104347826086957
4309276,5,B004AGN9MG,"We got this for our 2.5 year old because we were tired of watching the sole title on Netflix streaming over and over and over...

This is one of those ""kids"" shows that is also entertaining for all ages (at least those of us who are still young at heart). Our son loves all the animals and their crazy antics. When he wants to watch it he yells, ""Sheep! Sheep! Sheep!"" :)",1311897600,,371,4.152777777777778
4309277,1,B004AGN9MG,"The audience for Shaun the Sheep was clearly meant for children, but I thought the story lines were puerile, and I was embarrassed to give it as a gift to my young granddaughters.",1306886400,,179,4.454545454545454
4309278,5,B004AGN9MG,"After watching season 1 on Netflix over and over, getting a DVD with new episodes was great. The stories are entertaining and funny. However, they seem to have made changes to the characters - the dog now has a white belly and hands and feet, and the farmer has a 5-o'clock shadow line (but no actual shadow). I don't understand why they made these changes, because the characters were fine the way they were (and we all liked them better before). I would like to rate this 4.5 stars instead of 4, if that were an option.

Update: Apparently, the changes had to do with streamlining the process (see discussion), so I am changing my rating to 5 stars.",1306454400,,651,4.470588235294118
4309279,5,B004AGN9MG,"We have been watching Shaun the Sheep Season 1 on Netflix and my kid loves it. I bought him this DVD because it had all new episodes that he had not seen before. Cute show, similar to Pingu (claymation, no talking, and humorous even for adults).",1305331200,14,245,4.3478260869565215
4309280,5,B004AGN9MG,"We love Shaun the Sheep and this collection of episodes isn't disappointing in the least!  The seven episodes on this DVD are:

-  ""Spring Lamb"" - It's bath time for a reluctant Timmy. In trying to escape, Timmy gets a spring attached to his tail. It's up to the flock to catch the bouncing baby sheep and return him to the tub before he destroys the farm.

-  ""Supersize Timmy"" - Timmy accidentally eats a tomato grown with ""Miracle-Grow"" fertilizer and expands to become the King Kong of sheep. Shaun must keep the giant toddler out of sight while trying to figure out how to return him to normal size.

- ""Bagpipe Buddy"" - The sheep discover a set of bagpipes on the rubbish dump which they immediately misidentify as a sick emu. They set about trying to nurse it back to health before releasing it back into the wild.

- ""Cheetah Cheater"" - A wildlife film inspires Pidsley the cat to play a prank on the flock by disguising himself as a leopard. Shaun is convinced there is a huge beast on the loose and concocts a plan to catch it.

- ""Lock Out"" - While preparing for bed, the Farmer manages to lock himself out of the house and is stuck outside in his pajamas. He decides to spend the night in the barn but his incessant snoring drives the flock mad. Shaun heads up an operation to return him to his bed without waking him up.

- ""Draw the Line"" - The flock hijack a road line-painting machine and cause chaos while creating giant works of art in the field.

- ""Ewe've Been Framed"" - When Shaun accidentally breaks the farmer's glasses, he and Bitzer have their work cut out trying to prevent their short-sighted master from having mishaps around the farm. Things get a little hair-raising for the flock before Shaun manages to replace the smashed up spectacles.

Bonus features include a game and a bonus Timmy Time episode (a new show centered around Timmy, the baby sheep).  Definitely recommended!",1300492800,54,1908,4.5145348837209305
4309281,5,B004AGN9MG,"If you already like Shaun the Sheep, or just started watching b/c of Timmy Time, you'll love this DVD. My son (now 3) started watching Shaun a little over a year ago. We were thrilled to see Timmy Time coming on television. This DVD has a lot of Timmy, so naturally, my son loves it. I'm a huge fan of Shaun and Timmy myself. Let's face it, other than teaching kids to bleat, there's not a lot of annoying catch phrases they can pick up on!",1300147200,4,440,4.127906976744186
4309282,5,B004AGN9MG,"I had been a Shaun the sheep fan for two years now, and I love this set by far. espetialy when two of the episodes involve the cutest lamb on earth... Timmy!

My favorite episodes where Spring Lambs, locked out, and the other one whtch involves timmy and a tommato that reminds me of Alice in Wonderland.",1299628800,,304,4.333333333333333
4309283,5,B004AGN9MG,"What I like about Shaun the Sheep is that they don't really talk but rather just act goofy and funny.  They are mischievous and sneaky, but they always make the whole family laugh!  This DVD is great to get out of the winter funk and start thinking about spring and going outside!",1297123200,10,280,4.365384615384615

Claymation, from the Aran sweater designs to the sheep who drop poop when scared - just a riot. Better for kids than the punch-em-shoot-em-up or dainty-girly pablum offered for kids these days. Just an absolute delight.",1427500800,,390,4.585714285714285

4309331,5,B004AGN9MG,"Great humor for both children and adults.  No one talks in Shaun the Sheep, even the farmer.  They do use non-verbal noises. It is quite clear to understand what is going on, even without words.  Shaun is not a cartoon, the characters are made out of clay.  This is not an 'in your face' typical kids show.  The sheep do get into lots of crazy non-realistic shenanigans.  This has clever and sometimes subtle humor, mixed with a bit of potty humor (toots).  Episodes last about 6-7 minutes each.  This DVD includes 7 episodes.  You really have to see it to understand.",1417478400,3,568,4.544554455445544
