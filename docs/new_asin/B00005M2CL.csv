1623745,5,B00005M2CL,"Edgar Ulmer was the king of B-movie directors, and this one was definitely one of his best.  The story, for those who don't know it, is about a lady named Nora (played by the brilliant and versatile Marsha Hunt) and her son Tony.  Tony's father dies when he's an infant and Nora raises Tony to be a distinguished pianist.  Tony chooses another musical path - that of more popular music, much to Nora's disdain.  Nora, meanwhile, has developed a society at Carnegie Hall for promising young musicians to study classical music.  Tony goes on the road but comes back to Carnegie Hall for a concert, and wins back his mother's approval.  Marsha Hunt is my colleague - and at the time I'm writing this, she's 90 years old and still going very strong.  She agrees that the story was quite corny but the music made it all worthwhile.  She shared a brief scene with Heifetz, and she said that Heifetz was terribly nervous about the whole thing...except for when he was playing, of course.  She also said that Heifetz played solos for her during the rehearsal time.  This was not Heifetz's acting debut, though - he had a similar part in ""They Shall Have Music"" 10 years earlier.  Still, for all of us ""J.H."" connoisseurs who know the man and his art and philosophy, seeing him acting in a film is a REAL treat.

The music is the blood of the film - the story is pretty secondary.  Very cool to see Damrosch, Reiner, and Stokowski, AND the famed New York critic Olin Downes.  One curiosity is the camera zooming in on various billboards for the Carnegie Hall concerts - there's a billboard there for Kreisler.  Too bad that Kreisler was not part of the film, but by 1947, he wasn't performing much anymore and eventually he lost interest in violin playing.

An aside - this film didn't do well.  Good though the music was, and pleasant though the story was, ""Carnegie Hall"" became a nightmare.  It did far less well at the box office than was expected.  But there were many other problems. Heifetz, for one, received $10,000 for his appearance in the film and although he was not given first billing in the credits, he was included as one of the film's shareholders.  Meaning, that if the film did well, he'd receive royalties for the rest of his life. The cost of production was around $250,000 (peanuts, even in those days.)  The production company, Federal Films, Inc. didn't come close to breaking even and the budget was entirely of borrowed money, which the bank sued them to repay, despite the box office failure.  As a result, all of those who had a share in the film were hounded by the bank.  Ultimately, the money was not paid back in full; the bank sued and became the new owners of the film.  Despite this, it is rather fitting that, over 60 years later, the magic of Carnegie is still very much there, and the music in this film attests to the greatness of ""The Hall"".

This DVD - well, the transfer isn't great.  Obviously the original print was not restored.  The liner notes from the Bel Canto Society (which evidently restored the film to include all of the music that was originally filmed, because many versions cut out large chunks), so that's reason enough to buy this particular DVD.",1211587200,24,3197,4.563157894736842
1623746,2,B00005M2CL,"I bought this to have the Heifetz shortened version of the 1st movement of the Tschaikovsky Violin Concerto in my collection. Remember when in 1980 Perlman interrupted his concert to say to the audience ""Today is the birthday of the greatest violinist who ever lived?"" He was referring to Heifetz and his comment took in a lot of territory as no one alive had ever heard, for example, Paganini. Well I feel the same way about Heifetz. So get this one to hear Heifetz at his best. Forget the rest.",1207785600,3,496,4.522222222222222
1623747,4,B00005M2CL,"This film features a host of historic singers and instrumentalists in performance in Carnegie Hall, held together by a reasonably flimsy plot about a young pianist whose well-meaning but somewhat domineering mother tries to talk him out of pursuing a career in popular music. See it for the incomparable artistry of Heifetz, Rubinstein, Piatigorsky, Jan Peerce, Ezio Pinza, Stokowski, Reiner, Bruno Walter (who turns in a stunning performance of Wagner's Meistersinger Prelude), and others. While this is the complete version (includes the Rachmaninoff Vocalise sung by Lily Pons, who also sings the Bell Song from Lakme), the picture quality and sound are inferior to the release by Kino Video, which can also be purchased on Amazon.com.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Carnegie-Hall/dp/B00005M2CL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Carnegie Hall</a>",1202428800,8,880,6.341666666666667
1623748,4,B00005M2CL,"The film is excellent for no other reason that it showcases some of the greats in Classical music during the period (1947) which are very difficult to find. The way these scenes are filmed is also exceptional. You clearly see the concentration and the blending of the musician with the music in a way that is seldom captured on film. You don't have to be a classical fan to appreciate it. I have seen several people greatly enjoy this film who do not particularly care for classical music, greatly enjoy this film. It is the skill and passion of the musicians that they appreciate.

Some have complained that the plot is poor and should be skipped. Yes, it is not a great script, but it does serve to break up the performances and to some degree it gives you the feeling of the care, dedication and the artistry of these musicians. If it had been just the performances it would have been a bit too much like a concert. Even though the script was not the best, it focused your attention on the passion of the music and the musicians. This set it above a mere concert film. However, it could have been a better film with a better script.

Unfortunately the Kino version is not the best. The transfer is sloppy, and the sound is of a poor quality. Additionally some of the musical numbers are cut. A complete version with high quality sound is available on this web site from a different studio.",1196467200,2,1392,4.454901960784314

1623752,4,B00005M2CL,"The story is an embarrassment, unworthy to share time with the great singers and musicians contained within. Vaughn Monroe and Harry James do not belong in the film because they were given poor material to work with. The creators of this film did not know what they were doing in the popular music department, nor in the story department. I would never watch this entire film again.

The useless story line, and the 'great new composer' shtick was used to useless advantage decades later, in 'Mr. Holland's Opus'.

At least here, the performers steal the show... such as it is. Basically, stop the movie, before the last scenes. And revel in the REAL music made, before the Hollywoodites destroyed the plot.",1426377600,,407,5.151515151515151

1623775,5,B00005M2CL,"I first saw this film over 60 years ago and in many respects it was my introduction to classical music. The DVD was a perfect reminder of that experience. I sent a copy of it to my sister-in-law, who is an admirer of Artur Rubinstein, and she also liked it immensely although the film was recorded in black-and-white.

What I didn't like - and this is purely personal and probably no reflection on the film - is that when Jascha Heifetz was playing  a most beautiful part of the Tchaikovsky violin concerto the camera produced a soppy scene of a lady, all misty-eyed, when I would have very much preferred to see Heifetz in action.

What there is to like about the film is the sights and sounds of not one, but many, first-rate musicians in action, and that makes up for everything.",1398384000,2,782,4.454545454545454

1623777,3,B00005M2CL,"The film itself is, on the whole, enjoyable... but the visual quality leaves much to be desired; hence my giving the DVD only 3 stars.

Visually-speaking the Bel Canto version looks like it was sourced from a second-generation VHS tape rather than directly from a print of the film. I've never seen the Kino version, although from other reviews here it would appear that the version is not complete; in that it omits some sections of the film. All the same, this is a valuable historic document. It's a shame that no one has seen fit to try and to do a proper restoration of the film from the original negatives (or at least an archival print).

As for the film proper, the most enjoyable aspects are the ""live"" performances by such luminaries as Bruno Walter, Fritz Reiner, and Leopold Stokowski. Another reviewer complained about each performer's name appearing on a ""billboard""... I believe what he or she was referring to is the framing device of showing the audience each performer's name on the printed program; along with the selection(s) to be performed.

There are some conventions of musical performance depicted here that may seem strange to contemporary viewers and concert-goers. For example, the fact that the audience applauds Stokowski at the end of the ""Andante Cantabile"" movement of the Tchaikovsky 5th Symphony. Today, of course, most audience members know to hold their applause until the end of an entire symphony or concerto. In 1947, however, many of the 19th century conventions of performance practice were still very much in evidence.

As for the back-story of the film... at times, particularly near the end, it all seems contrived and hokey; much in the same way as the bulk of ""Rhapsody in Blue"" (1945), which starred Robert Alda as composer George Gershwin.",1383955200,,1788,4.930232558139535

1623787,3,B00005M2CL,"Carnegie Hall is not a very good movie. I think it was created primarily to provide a vehicle for showcasing many of the top musical talent of the day, and it remains valuable today only for that reason. Here are mini-concert performances by classical music names from the 1940's; the conductors Walter Damrosch, Bruno Walter, Artur Rodzinski, Fritz Reiner and Leopold Stokowski; singers Rise Stevens, Lily Pons, Jan Peerce and Ezio Pinza, plus pianist Arthur Rubinstein, cellist Gregor Piatigorsky and violinist Jascha Heifetz. Just being able to see Heifetz playing the Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto is a good reason to watch the DVD, although he only plays the first movement and it is slightly abridged. Otherwise a viewer can fast forward through the interim melodrama and mot miss anything.",1317168000,4,794,5.2109375

This 1947 feature, shot inside Carnegie Hall is about a mother whose only dream is that her only son will become a famous concert pianist. As he grows up, he's fortunate enough to see the greatest names performing right across his home, at Carnegie Hall. The first 40 minutes focus on the plot and there's hardly any music in them. But then the direction changes - the plot moves to the backround while the focus is on Jascha Heifetz (1st movement from Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto), Artur Rubinstein (Chopin and De Falla), Jan Peerce, Rise Stevens and more. It's a unique chance to see these great names performing live! The picture and sound are, I guess, what can be expected from a movie made in the 40s not by a big Hollywood studio; nevertheless, if the artists and music in general are the focus, it's a treasure.",1298937600,2,948,4.549707602339181

No other version has all of this material. I have not listened to both versions, but I would expect the sound quality on this one to be at least as high.

Now the movie itself: I bought this DVD only to watch the many phenomenal musicians listed. Indeed, there are many incredible performances on this DVD which can not be found anywhere else. And that makes this DVD invaluable. What surprised me though, was that I actually enjoyed the movie (The structure is that of a drama in which the main characters go to Carnegie Hall frequently to watch the performances) as well. Certainly the performances are the highlight of the DVD, but don't automatically expect that you'll be fast-forwarding through this to get to them.
