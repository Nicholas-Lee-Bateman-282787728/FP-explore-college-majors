Only complaint, about 2/3rds of the way through someone should have kicked the camera person in the hind end and woke them up as they were  apparently getting bored and lagging way behind what he was doing. But would still recommend the video as he was excellent.",1230076800,,371,4.621212121212121
7916027,5,B00002NDSG,I liked it. It illustrated how to put paint onto the canvas (or other)with as little effort as possible. The lack of info on the carton didn't bother me as I can CLEARLY see in the ad that the artists' name is Don Adams. I enjoyed his Bob Ross approach to paint for the fun of it and worry about the details later (or never).,1039737600,5,325,4.015384615384615
7916028,5,B00002NDSG,"I must concur with other comments regarding the value of this video.  First, I watched it all the way through, made a list of the supplies he used, then watched it again while I painted the same picture.  I must admit that my TV remote unit will never look the same (I paused, rewound, stopped...for several hours), but the result was amazing.  I learned a great deal about mists on lakes, trees, rocks at waters' edge, shadows...oh yes, I took notes also while I did the exercise.
This video was a real treat and I'm really geared up to further explorations with oils.  Don Adam's style is relaxed and quite supportive.  The close ups are great and you can really get a bird's eye view on the creating of a nature oil painting.  I highly recommend.",1022198400,14,749,4.470588235294118
