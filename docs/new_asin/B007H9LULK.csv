8516548,5,B007H9LULK,"I had seen this movie 20 years ago and was able to record it onto VHS.  I have been looking for this on DVD but it was nowhere to be found. All the writing on the cover and DVD is in Portuguese but the movie is in English. It stars James Caan, Harrison Ford, Jan Michael-Vincent, Paul Peterson.. to name a few when they were just starting out in their careers. It's a western about 7 Young guys from Texas going to join up in the civil war. Loved it way back then and still love this movie!",1350518400,6,490,4.0
