2416024,3,B000BGL6VU,"I am very happy that someone thought about this and made a video about making Waldorf dolls. I am interested in making a doll, but didn't want to spend 250 Dollars on an online class without knowing how hard this would be or not.
I have not made any dolls yet, but I have had my fair share of looking at them and looking online at different dolls from different dollmakers. Waldorf dolls are superhard to buy especially from sellers that are wellknown. So here is my attempt to make my own, but the DVD leaves out some stuff, maybe because it is made in 2005 and dollmaking has evolved in the last 5 years. There is no explanation of how a nose is made. There is also nothing about different uses of hair like handspun handdyed wool or chunky yarn. She only shows one technique of how to do the head, but I have seen better versions on pinterest or through searches on google. Youtube provides some info but most dollmakers don't share hwo they make dolls.
I ordered the book on making walldorf dolls and hope that will include more info.
The DVD is a good start but just with that info alone I feel not prepared to make a doll. No patterns are included and the detail stitches go way to fast in the movie, she hardly slows down. Worth the money? Well, there is nothing else out there, so I guess so.",1349827200,7,1300,4.288617886178862
2416025,5,B000BGL6VU,"Before viewing this DVD, I struggled to make a Waldorf doll using a book with scant instructions. The DVD shows you how tight to make the head, how to correctly measure and weigh to get symmetry and how to crochet a wig - and I love the way the hands are shown as if they are your own hands! This is better than doing a course, because you can go at your own pace, you can stop and start when you want, and you don't have to worry about getting a babysitter in so you can attend one.",1325635200,,483,3.938775510204082
2416026,3,B000BGL6VU,I was disappointed with this DVD. I didn't feel there was enough content to satisfy all my questions. Since purchasing this DVD I've learned a lot more about the construction of a Waldorf doll and feel this DVD is lacking.,1324425600,,222,4.575
2416027,4,B000BGL6VU,"Very nice video.  Good production values.  Good content.  It would be nice to know that you need a pattern to go along with it.  She's very precise with her measurements sometimes, then neglects to even mention a measurement in other section.  but overall enjoyable and very clear about how to make the doll.  the gallery of finished dolls is soooo cute, as is the end where the children are playing with them.",1294531200,4,410,4.625
2416028,5,B000BGL6VU,"Sarah's dollmaking DVD is a great video for beginning dollmakers. I have very little sewing and no dollmaking experience, and her instructions are clear and to the point. The fact that she's Australian adds charm to the video, because Sarah is really fun to listen to, as well! I'm very happy with this DVD, and highly recommend it to anyone who wants to learn how to make Waldorf dolls.",1283299200,5,387,4.6231884057971016
2416029,5,B000BGL6VU,"This DVD is wonderful!  Anyone who has ever had an interest in Waldorf doll-making owes it to her(or him)self to check it out.  Sarah thoroughly explains each step of the way, and her down-to-earth, friendly manner is refreshing. I truly enjoyed viewing this DVD.  My children (16 and 8)watched it along with me, and enjoyed it as well.",1242000000,5,336,4.758620689655173
2416030,5,B000BGL6VU,"I have this DVD and it is so wonderful!  I am a novice when it comes to sewing and doll making and I've always been intimidated by the books and written instructions for making Waldorf dolls.  This DVD is perfect for the beginner!

After watching the attention to detail and the close-ups, I am not intimidated anymore and am confident that my children can make their own dolls as well!  (They're 13, 10 and 8)  The videography is excellent and the close ups are extremely helpful in understanding each step.

Sarah takes her time and patiently guides you through each step so you don't get confused.  I think this is one of the best instructional DVD's I've ever seen!

I also ordered easy-to-follow downloadable patterns at her website [...] .  You can order the DVD there for less.

I highly recommend this DVD!",1138838400,29,814,4.629370629370629
8086336,5,B000BGL6VU,Sarah is a wonderful doll maker. Her DVD is very useful as it tells you step by step how to create a Waldorf doll. Also she shows you how to stuff a doll making the parts extremely firm. I would recommend anyone starting their Waldorf doll making journey to purchase Sarah's DVD as it provides you with simple to understand instructions from start to finish.,1480809600,,358,4.523076923076923
8086337,5,B000BGL6VU,Very helpful for beginners and experienced doll makers.  Every step explained and shown.  Super fast delivery.,1424908800,,110,5.8125
8086338,4,B000BGL6VU,"This video was very clear. For a visual learner like myself it was very helpful. Of course, there are different ways in making a waldorf dolls,  but all the methods are very much alike. This method has you weigh your stuffing, before making the head or limbs.

I think the video is a bit pricey and by looking on the net (youtube) and pinterest I can find enough directions to make one without buying a video like this. However, I am glad I bought this and plan to keep it as a reference.",1420243200,2,488,4.236559139784946
8086339,5,B000BGL6VU,"I have never really been a crafty sort of person. I haven't the imagination and I haven't any talent, but my daughter desperately wanted to try her hand at Waldorf dolls. Not knowing anything about them I got hold this DVD. To my surprise they are pretty easy to make and the finished product is so cute. My daughter loves them.

The instructions on this DVD are thorough and clear and the video footage is excellent so you can't go wrong.

My daughter isn't one for fine details and would be lost trying to make sense of written instructions, she has enjoyed making her  dolls and is now making them on her own for Christmas gifts and charity boxes. I highly recommend this disc particularly for anyone just starting out. It has certainly been great value for us.",1415577600,,764,4.521739130434782
8086340,5,B000BGL6VU,"This is a very helpful DVD. Sarahs explanations are clear,  follow step by step in a sequence with logic, very easy to understand. I had already understood the basics  on doll making but still I benefited very much because of some details in the construction of the doll that are shown in the DVD.
I also liked her detailed explanations on the wool weight  for the different sizes of dolls. Even if you don't have a precision scale, this information serves to give you a reference in the quantity to be used. I had not seen that before, and its very useful information.",1391558400,,569,4.504854368932039
8086341,5,B000BGL6VU,"I made the formed head tonight - it looks great and I'm so excited to make the rest!  I'm REALLY impressed with this DVD - I u-tubed various waldorf doll making tutorials and bought two waldorf doll making books prior to buying Sarah's DVD and this DVD is SO much more thorough then anything I could find.  She did a really great job with it.  :)  For me it was trying to find a really clear and detailed step by step explanation on how to make the formed head.  I tried several different ways and I was not happy with any of them but after watching Sarah's DVD and following it step by step It was done in no time to a nice weight, shape and density.

The DVD is user friendly, beginner friendly and answers all questions about waldorf doll making you could have!  I cannot praise it enough.  She even talks about the traditional formula used to get the proportions correct which I really liked.",1388707200,5,896,4.323353293413174
8086342,5,B000BGL6VU,"This DVD has wonderful instructions for Waldorf doll making! It goes step by step through the whole process. Two types of dolls are shown: a Child doll, and a Baby doll. Sarah explains the supplies needed for each step, and the camera shows the skills needed very closely. Anyone could easily follow her detailed instructions. She has a calm, soothing way of explaining exactly what to do to make your own finished doll. Her voice is sweet, with a charming accent. This is a great craft how-to for Waldorf Moms wanting to do their own creative handwork. It is cute to see the children at play with their own dolls at the very end of the DVD.",1364688000,3,641,4.487179487179487
8086343,5,B000BGL6VU,"I made my first Waldorf doll over twenty years ago, using an old t-shirt and the somewhat vague instructions and measurements from a book on Waldorf toymaking. Despite its shortcomings, the doll remains a well-loved possession of the now-adult child who received it.

As a new dollmaker, I would so have appreciated this&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/waldorf-doll-making-dvd/dp/B000BGL6VU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">waldorf doll making dvd</a>. Sarah, creator of the lovely dolls on the Sarah's Dolls website, clarifies so many things that I had to figure out for myself by trial and error: where the measurements are taken, shaping the head, eliminating bumps, and how firm the stuffing really needs to be.  But as a seasoned dollmaker, I still came across tips I hadn't encountered before.  The difference between reading instructions and seeing an experienced dollmaker create these beautiful dolls reinforces the old adage that a picture is worth a thousand words.  Even when some points are not explicitly stated, it is easy to see what to do while watching the DVD.

If you are expecting the high-energy style typical of most how-to videos, you'll be in for a bit of a shock.  True to Waldoft style (or as true as you can get with the slightly unorthodox use of modern technology to teach Waldorf crafts) the DVD is gently paced, with a soothing musical background, soft colors and a calm, low-key presentation.  You can easily watch it with an older child (younger children might be a bit dismayed by some of the stages of dolly production) and come away feeling relaxed instead of harried. You'll also develop an appreciation of why these dolls are so expensive to buy.

Although Sarah is based in Australia, most of the terms will be familiar to people living in the US.  The one exception would be the use of tricot for the skin of the dolls.  Here in the US, tricot is slinky fabric used most often for making underwear - not suitable at all for Waldorf dollmaking!  Thick cotton interlock is what you're looking for.

If you are wondering why you would want to invest the money and time to creating a doll with simple features when you can get a detailed plastic baby at your local discount store for under $20, make sure to watch the final chapter, called Playtime.  Notice how much the children are enjoying playing with the dolls, how soft and warm to the touch the dolls look in action, and how natural the play looks.  Isn't this really the kind of childhood you want for your child or grandchild?",1364169600,6,2559,4.990588235294117
8086344,5,B000BGL6VU,"I found the DVD to be clear, easy to follow and even quite relaxing to watch and listen to! Even my kids loved it. I can't understand why some previous reviews said it was lacking. I mean, Waldorf dolls are simple things anyway, so if its any more complicated it isn't a Waldorf doll anyway! What I really appreciated was that the instructions are generic, ie they are not confined to a certain pattern, and the DVD even shows you how to measure and design your own patterns.",1362700800,,475,4.409090909090909
8086345,3,B000BGL6VU,"didn't like, no useful information, was trying to learn the Waldorf doll making process, didn't help, sorry I ordered it.",1360368000,,121,5.1
