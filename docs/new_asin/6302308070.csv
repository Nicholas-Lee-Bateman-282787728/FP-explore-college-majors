Spacey is a newsman covering the murder trial who has a change of heart, Baker portrays the governor's assistant/adviser, and Macy in a nearly non-speaking role is a vengeance-intent citizen of Atlanta.

SYNOPSIS--
After 13-year-old Mary is discovered strangled and molested at the pencil factory where she worked, the plant manager, Leo Frank (Gallagher) is arrested and charged with murder. Frank, a Jew from Brooklyn is tried under highly prejudicial circumstances. Prosecutor Hugh Dorsey (Jordan) allows condemning perjury by Jim Conley (Dutton), a black janitor who was one of the few at the factory that Saturday afternoon. Another influence is an enormous crowd outside the courthouse shouting threats against the accused through the courtroom's open windows.

Frank, always insistent in his innocence and that every word of Conley's testimony against him is false, gets convicted and sentenced to hang. Appeals right up to the U.S. Supreme Court fail and Frank's hanging is scheduled for a few days before Gov. John Slaton (Lemmon) is due to leave office. Slaton's lifelong dream of running for the U.S. Senate is in peril if he commutes the death sentence to life, but as Slaton is Frank's last resort he feels an investigation into the trial's transcripts must be conducted.

The more Gov. Slaton researches, the more uncertain he is that Leo Frank is guilty, yet by overturning the court's ruling, perhaps he and/or Frank may end up lynched. At bare minimum, Slaton's political ambitions will be dashed forever.

As of 7/09, ""Mary Phagan"" was not available on DVD.

454246,5,6302308070,"An excellently produced film with a clear and unmistakable message on the subject of discrimination against jews in the context of a murder mystery. Fine productional values, especially the setting and costumes.

The acting, writing, directing were fine--with one exception: The person who played the Jewish Manager--his interpretation and performance were far too tepid and unemotional. He was falsely accused of killing a twelve year old girl, and he hardly bats and eyelash. He made me feel as if the problem had perhaps happened to someone else rather than himself. He needed to feel more disturbed about his unbfortunate situation. Sometimes his passive performance was welcome, but at other times not, because it made him seem uncaring about the accusations made about him. This distanced my sympathy for him--""why should I care about his plight if he doesn't?""",1243296000,,867,5.282608695652174
454247,5,6302308070,"I saw this mini series on T.V. years ago.  I loved the movie, but there has been a question in my mind ever since that I have longed to have answered.  At one point in the movie, Frank's wife was playing some hauntingly beautiful music.  It was definitely classical and maybe even opera.  It sounded slightly familiar, but I could not identify it.  I would like to purchase this music if I can find it available ANYWHERE!  Can anyone help me out here?",1108771200,3,451,4.373493975903615

454412,2,6302308070,"First problem is, this is an edited version. Second, the writers did not do their homework. Leo Frank was a very well educated east coast guy. His arranged marriage was to a very rich, corpulent, unattractive young  Jewish Southern woman who was not at all well educated. Her parents  had the bucks. If you read about Leo you will learn that he enjoyed the company of intellectuals and very pretty young women. This was not the perfect marriage that this movie pretends it is. He did like to flirt and joke around with the factory girls. he liked to drink and party and spend time with his intellectual college friends. The film however shows that he and his wife  are deep;y in love. I do still  believe , that in spite of Leo's shallow character flaws, that he did not murder Mary Phagan and was not capable of killing this young woman and did not deserve to be hung  illegally by the village idiots.",1465516800,,902,4.475609756097561

If you do watch it I recommend you google Mary Phagan after youve seen it.  There is one nagging question toward the end of the movie that was never addressed and was conspicuous by its absence: Why wasn't . ever arrested for the crime?.

454473,2,6302308070,"The Murder of Mary Phagan

The conviction of Otto Frank for the murder of Mary Phagan was commuted by the Governor of Georgia to Life Imprisonment.
It was clear that it was only a matter of time until Frank would be pardoned. The Governor fled Georgia having received undisclosed payments
from various Jewish organizations. The law firm of the Governor had been retained to defend Frank. The Governor died in California many years later. Frank was the president of B'Nai Brith for Georgia. That Frank was lynched is undeniable. That was worse than a sin. It was a mistake.
That he had been convicted of murder and his appeals to the Supreme Court overturned are also undeniable. The Anti-Defamation
League set up its headquarters in Atlanta after the lynching of Frank. Other Jewish organizations, such as the Southern Poverty
Law Center followed suit. The murder of Mary Phagan caused the formation of the Knights of Mary Phagan. This organization
became a branch of the Ku Klux Klan. 12 year old Mary Phagan worked for 7.5 cents per hour in 12 hour shifts. Otto Frank hired
over 100 young girls like Mary Phagan to work in his Atlanta sweatshop. The movie makes the Governor a hero. He was not.
Frank, played by an Irish-American actor, was no martyr. How long will it be that we see movies about the wonderfulness of Bernie Madoff?

It tells the story, but the original allowed the story to unfold and illustrated the fear and hate building against Leo Frank, thus Slaton's (Jack Lemon) decision to commute the sentence is more dramatic.

""The Murder of Mary Phagan"" also shows him being lynched -- and revealed the real killer at the end. The more sensitive, black-and-white original, did not do either.

Far from being slanderous as one reviewer stated, this production presented its subject and personalities with great dignity. At times moving and even eloquent in its subtlety, this teleplay allowed Jack Lemmon to demonstrate why he deserves a place as one of Hollywood's classic character artists.  As for certain dramatic license - like the singing scene in the courtroom - this was a screenwriters' way of capturing the popular mindset that condoned Frank's lynching outside the walls.  The measured pace is standard TV-movie time-filler, but thanks to the subject and scripting the film does not lag.  Considering the massive race riot that broke out in Atlanta in 1906, over a black man's alleged assault on a white girl, the willingness of a white jury to convict a white defendant of the same crime on a black man's shaky testimony was in itself remarkable.

Was this accidental or intentional?

Hollywood's Degenerative Disloyalty to the American People:

What I witnessed watching this digitally remastered DVD, having previously viewed the grainy VHS version and live serial on Television, is: Once again, absolutely appalling torrents of bigoted, prejudiced and racist anti-Gentile hate propaganda to its very core. This Hollywood agitprop is one of the most disgusting assaults against true American history, about one of the most well documented criminal cases of Southern jurisprudence. This miniseries is really nothing more than un-American Hollywood expressing its rabid foaming-at-the-mouth contemptuous enmity of Southern culture, Christian and Gentile peoples, not just against European-Americans, but also African-Americans included. Every Atlanta historian I have spoken with (Jewish and Gentile alike) has stated emphatically that from beginning to end, this miniseries is nothing but unadulterated subversive bald faced lies that can not stand-up to even the most basic fact-checking or academic scrutiny. Since I've become a skeptic of Hollywood's veracity and more broadly question mainstream media integrity, I decided to do deep archival research into legal records and local newspaper reports about the Frank-Phagan case.

The Undeniable Falsification of Official Legal Records:

Hollywood makes a grotesque mockery of what really happened during the Coroner's Inquest (that concluded May 8th, 1913), Grand jury hearing (that concluded May 24, 1913), Leo Frank's trial (July 28 - August 21, 1913), closing arguments (August 21 - 25, 1913), verdict (August 25, 1913) and judge ratification with sentencing (August 26, 1913), as reported in the three local Atlanta daily newspapers (Constitution, Journal and Georgian) and official Leo Frank Trial Brief of Evidence (1913), contained within the 1,800 page Leo Frank Georgia Supreme Court Records (1913, 1914). These original primary sources about the Frank-Phagan case are no longer buried in dark government archives and musty libraries, but freely available on the Internet, digitized and OCR scanned, for people to review and fact-check for themselves. You can thank the Government of Georgia for making these 100 year old documents available.

There are so many examples of this film falsifying history, one can not help but wonder if this monstrously ugly agitprop was designed solely for traducing the whole South with false allegations of anti-Semitism and slandering Southerners with conspiratorial blood libel:

For instance, dozens of people did not stand up inside and outside the courtroom during the middle of the proceedings and start singing, with the result of the trial coming to a screeching halt. In fact every appeal by Leo Frank to the Georgia Supreme Court, resulted in their majority decisions affirming he had a fair trial. The Georgia Supreme Court even ruled that the evidence presented at the Leo Frank trial was sufficient for a guilty verdict beyond a reasonable doubt. Even Governor John Slaton in his 29-page clemency order, specifically affirmed Leo Frank had a fair trial against the false accusations of anti-Jewish race prejudice. Moreover, on the last page of Slaton commuting the death sentence of his law firm's client, Leo Max Frank, he specifically sustained the presiding trial judge and appellate tribunals in leaving the jury's *guilty verdict* undisturbed. Does that sound like Slaton had any doubts about Frank's guilt when he could have fully pardoned him of the murder?

Tennessean Newspaper, Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith and Alonzo Mann:

March 11, 1986, the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles, posthumously pardoned Leo Frank of murdering Mary Phagan (without addressing the question of guilt or innocence) on the technicality that the State failed to protect him when he was abducted on August 16, 1915, ""preventing further appeals"". However this assertion by the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles was a bald faced lie, because *four months* before Leo Frank's August 17, 1915 hanging, he had completely exhausted all of his appeals at every level of the United States Federal Appeals System, when the United States Supreme Court voted unanimously (April of 1915), ruling they would no longer accept any further petitions reviewing his case. Again, nothing was said about Leo Frank not having a fair trial. In fact, Leo Frank's conspicuously frivolous appeals are well documented in his 1,800 Georgia Supreme Court appeals records. In those Georgia Supreme Court records we learn how Leo Frank's legal defense team, including Governor John Slaton in his law office, bribed, tricked, threatened and manipulated witnesses to repudiate their trial testimony and affidavits. I wonder, how did Slaton avoid getting disbarred?

Hollywood's Racist Anti-Southern Culture War, Smearing One of Georgia's Greatest Statesmen:

Hugh Dorsey, one of Georgia's most progressive governor and conscientious jurist, is early-on, made out to be a gigolo sex-fiend, who would make love with a centenarian shriveled-up great-grandmother just to increase his votes.

The list of Hollywood's ugly machinations assaulting the good people of Georgia in this miniseries goes on and on to the point of nausea.

This miniseries about the Leo Frank case is one of the most vile anti-White, prejudiced, dishonest, libelous and defamatory treatments against Southerners ever produced about the murder case of Mary Phagan in the last 100 years since the first film, ""Thou Shalt Not Kill"" was created in 1915 to romanticize the child rapist and killer Leo Max Frank. Without exception, the mainstream media in every retelling of this notorious case, is waging a demoralizing and deracinating social-political war against the South as a place where ""innocent"" Jews are framed by anti-Semitic Southerners for the crime of aggravated assault, child rape & strangulation, solely because of religious prejudice. Ironically the South and ""Bible Belt"" more broadly speaking is one of the most philo-Semitic, Zionist and pro-Israel regions in the world, when one chooses the meaning of Semitic or Semite to mean Jew, not Arab.

Let's take a closer look at how utterly sickening these pathological lies about the Frank-Phagan Case are perpetuated in the popular culture by the tribal paranoiacs who infest the mainstream media of Hollywood and Broadway.

Leo Frank's Official Trial Speech Delivered on Monday Afternoon, August 18, 1913:

I wonder why this miniseries intentionally left out entirely Leo Frank's incriminating four hour statement on the witness stand, delivered during open court at the Fulton County Superior Court, especially where Frank specifically changed the murder alibi he had maintained for 3.5 months -- reversing himself -- providing a newfangled admission to the jury, stating that he might have ""unconsciously"" been in the metal room bathroom between 12:05 p.m. and 12:10 p.m.

  Now, gentlemen, to the best of my recollection from the time the
  whistle blew for twelve o'clock until after a quarter to one when I went up stairs and
  spoke to Arthur White and Harry Denham, to the best of my recollection, I did not stir
  out of my office; but it is possible that in order to answer a call of nature or to urinate
  I may have gone to the toilet. Those are things that a man does unconsciously and can
  not tell how many times nor when he does it.

  Now, sitting in my office at my desk, it is impossible for me to see out into the outer hall
  when the safe door is open, as it was that morning, and not only is it impossible for me to
  see out, but it is impossible for people to see in and see me there.

Leo Frank simultaneously put himself in his office hidden behind a four-foot safe door and going to use the toilet or urinating in the metal room bathroom at the same time to explain why Monteen Stover found his office empty for five minutes between 12:05 and 12:10 p.m. on that infamous day, but in doing so he broke his own murder alibi about never leaving his office at that specific time.

The toilets are located at the back of the factory's second floor. Frank had formerly told Atlanta police (Monday, April 28, 1913) that Mary Phagan was alone with him in his business office at the front of the factory's second floor between 12:05 p.m. and 12:10 p.m. Everyone knows you can't be in two locations at the exact same time, but why do the re-makings of this case fail to mention Leo Frank's new admission to the jury, places himself at the scene of the crime, when the crime had occurred? Read: Monteen Stover's trial testimony, State's Exhibit B (Leo Frank's deposition to Atlanta Police) and Leo Frank's trial statement (August 18, 1913) in the brief of evidence.

Did Leo Frank confess to his accomplice-after-the-fact?

I wonder why this miniseries left out Jim Conley's testimony at the trial, about having found Mary Phagan dead in the machine room's (metal room) toilet area at the behest of Leo Frank, going there only after Leo Frank confessed to assaulting Mary because she wouldn't ""be with him"" (Mary refused to have sex with Leo).

Why No Forensic Evidence?

I wonder why this miniseries left out Coroner Inquest testimony and trial statements by several employees about witnessed hair with dried blood on it, twisted around the solid metal handle of the lathe workstation in the machine room (metal room) and a 5 inch wide fan shaped blood stain discovered on the floor adjacent to the machine room's (metal room) bathroom door. This forensic evidence in the factory's metalroom was discovered on Monday morning at 6:35 a.m, April 28, 1913 after the holiday weekend.

What Time was Mary Phagan Killed and Where was Leo Frank?

It's rather interesting that every book, musical, miniseries, movie, article and documentary created about the Leo Frank Case since 1913 (with the exception of Mary Phagan-Kean's book, 'The Murder of Little Mary Phagan'), FAILS to mention Leo Frank's inescapably incriminating alibi about-face on the witness stand to the jury, where he puts himself at the scene of the crime, when the murder had occurred, which had been between 12:05 pm and 12:10 pm on Saturday, April 26, 1913.

Leo Frank's Version of When Mary Phagan Arrived in his Window-front office facing the street at the Factory's Second Floor:

I wonder why the miniseries failed to mention that Leo Frank told Atlanta police and detectives on Sunday, during the late morning of April 27, 1913, that Mary Phagan had come into his office about 12:03 pm on Saturday, April 26, 1913. Remember that 12:03 p.m.

I wonder why the miniseries said nothing about Leo Frank making an unsworn deposition to Atlanta police and detectives at the stationhouse, on Monday morning, April 27, 1913, with both of his elite lawyers (Luther Rosser and Herbert Haas) present, about Mary Phagan having arrived in his office ""between 12:05 pm and 12:10 pm, maybe 12:07pm"" on Saturday, April 26, 1913.

Governor John Slaton Commutes the Death Sentence of his Lawfirm's Client Leo Frank on June 21, 1915:

I wonder why the miniseries failed to mention that Governor John Slaton was co-owner and senior attorney partner in the lawfirm that represented Leo Frank at his trial and appeals, the law group being called, 'Rosser, Brandon, *Slaton* and Phillips', having formed in early July of 1913, just weeks before Leo Frank's trial began on July 28, 1913.

The Racist anti-Black Framing of the Negro Nightwatchman Newt Lee that Leo Frank Failed:

I wonder why the miniseries didn't show: Leo Frank in his office with the Atlanta police and detectives present, examining Newt Lee's time card on Sunday morning, April 27, 1913, and Frank stating to the officers that Newt Lee's time card was punched perfectly every half hour from 6:00pm on the day of the murder, till 3:00 am the morning after the murder.

Astoundingly the next day, on Monday, April 28, 1913, Leo Frank produced a forged time card incriminating Newt Lee with 4 hours of missed punches (Defendant's Exhibit A, Leo Frank Trial Brief of Evidence, 1913). Is this the behavior of an innocent man framed because of ""newspaper media frenzies"" and ""anti-Semitism""?

Leo Frank manufactured more than enough time on the account slip for the patsy, the Negro Newt Lee, to have gone home and discarded murder evidence (one contrived bloody shirt was found planted at Newt Lee's garbage barrel).

The Racist anti-Black Railroading of the Negro Nightwatchman Newt Lee Kept on Failing:

Why was this racist anti-Black railroading attempt against a Negro nightwatchman by a Jewish-American B'nai B'rith President of Atlanta left out of the miniseries?

I wonder why the miniseries didn't show the scene where Atlanta Police and Detectives found a contrived bloody shirt planted in Newt Lee's ash bin at his residence. ""Gee Willikers"", I wonder who put it there? Was it the ""diabolically genius"" and  semi-literate alcoholic Negro floor sweeper? Or the work of a cold, calculating and cunning racist Jew trying to frame an innocent Negro nightwatchman?

Had Leo Frank's racist anti-Black intrigue succeeded, an honest, innocent and married Negro graveyard-shift shoe shuffling security guard, with *absolutely no criminal record*, would have hanged for a crime he didn't commit. This is the ugly untold truth about the Murder Case of Mary Phagan that this miniseries and every other re-telling of the affair, surreptitiously ""forgets"" to mention: Leo Frank's botched racially-tinged framing of an old senior citizen African-American man who had lived his entire long life without a criminal rapsheet.

Where was Leo Frank when Mary Phagan was Murdered?

I wonder why the miniseries didn't show that Leo Frank -- while in jail waiting on his appeals -- was being questioned by the public via an Atlanta Constitution journalist and the interview was later published March 9, 1914 (Atlanta Constitution, March 9, 1914): Leo Frank once again stated he was in the machine room (metal room) bathroom between 12:05pm and 12:10pm to explain why Monteen Stover found his office empty at that same time, which was the exact same time Leo Frank said he was alone with Mary Phagan in his front office (State's Exhibit B, Leo Frank Trial Brief of Evidence, 1913).

Monteen Stover the Star Witness:

I wonder why Monteen Stover the 14-year old star witness who defended Leo Frank's character, but shattered his alibi is left out of the Miniseries. Monteen Stover said Leo Frank's office was empty between 12:05pm and 12:10pm on Saturday, April 26, 1913, the exact time Leo Frank said Mary was alone with him in his office. In response to Monteen Stover's testimony at the trial Leo Frank said to the jury he might have ""unconsciously"" been in the metal room bathroom, where Jim Conley testified he found the dead body of Mary Phagan.

Leo Frank threaded the needle's eye of the prosecutions case against him that he strangled Mary Phagan in the metal room bathroom between 12:05pm and 12:10pm on Saturday, April 26, 1913.

Spoiler Alert - The Verdict:

In fact Leo Frank's conviction was no nail biter or cliff hanger, he was easily convicted of murder in under 2 hours in 1913, after the longest and most expensive trial in Southern history at the time, just as he would be easily convicted in 2013 by any unbiased person who reads the Leo Frank Trial Brief of Evidence (1913). Sorry, but this was the easiest conviction in early 20th century American legal history and Leo Frank had the best legal minds in Georgia representing him including the eminent Louis Marshall.

Hollywood is filled with tribal domestic extremists and cultural Marxists who love to turn the truth upside down in ugly racist ways to sadistically undermine and attack the majority of Americans with cultural cancer.

This miniseries is indisputably a slander fest, created by the treacherous left-right paradigm media, which has been waging a no-hold-barred racist anti-Gentile culture war against Americans since 1913, using the Leo Frank Case as a blood soaked bludgeon, suggesting he was assassinated in an anti-Jewish conspiracy. However the tide is changing now that the entire 1,800 page Leo Frank Georgia Supreme Court Archive, containing the Leo Frank Trial Brief of Evidence, has been published online by Georgia legal researchers (Thank Goodness). Even more interesting than these boring legal documents published online, are the original local daily newspaper accounts available online as well, detailing the Mary Phagan murder investigation, Coroner's Inquest, Grand Jury, pre-trial discovery and Leo Frank trial, as captured in the Atlanta Journal, Atlanta Constitution and Atlanta Georgian, between April and August of 1913.

This miniseries is pure bigoted rotting garbage and prejudiced anti-Christian hatred, but it should be purchased none-the-less and examined, minute by minute, to be discussed in depth, debated and finally debunked as an educational project with students referring to the original legal records (1913-1915) and local newspaper accounts of this complex case.

I think its time for a full audit of every film ever produced by Hollywood, to determine when they started their campaign to subvert Western Civilization. I'm guessing it started in the 1940's and 1950's. It's time to expose which films are being used as cultural defamation weapons against the United States of America, Western Civilization, the South, Christians, European-Americans, African-Americans and broadly Gentiles. So with that, my recommendation is the full purchasing of every DVD from amazon.com of surviving movies created by Hollywood, to begin the meticulous exploration, and finding other examples about how they have insidiously subverted reality with shamelessly falsified morality tales and frenzied culture defamation wars.

Happily, this DVD release of THE MURDER OF MARY PHAGAN is now complete, and I can now recommend its purchase.

My only complaint is that it did not include any extras; for example, NBC-TV's TODAY show interviewed Jack Lemmon a week prior to the miniseries' premiere telecast, and both CNN and NBC on March 11, 1986 ran news items covering Georgia's posthumous pardon of Leo Frank, in which Wayne Snow, Jr., Georgia parole board chairman and Atlanta Jewish Federation president Gerald Cohen were interviewed; these reports explained the significance of the pardon and would have been excellent additions to the DVD release. I would gladly have paid extra for these to have been included in the release of THE MURDEER OF MARY PHAGAN, and these would have been very interesting for the viewer.
