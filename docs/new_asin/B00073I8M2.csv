8044523,3,B00073I8M2,"Btw, this movie is incorrectly titled and the picture quality is horrible. You can find a much better version of this movie if you look up ""The South Shaolin Master""",1468454400,2,165,4.533333333333333
8044524,4,B00073I8M2,"Ok, this is a good 'un.

The plot is actually interesting and quite different from the normal ""revenge teacher/school"" type saga. It's basically about a travelling troupe of performers who take on a friend that maybe they shouldn't have. There's some crazy goings on, really good fight sequences and - most amazingly [possible spoiler ahead] - fantastic boat race like nothing I've ever seen. A kung fu boat race? You bet. The editing is good, and the story line flows quite well. A lot of these can't really make that claim. This one had my full attention.

I've been watching a lot of the old kung fu movies on Prime lately (there's some gems), reliving my teen years. I never caught this one, but highly suggest checking it out. Easy 4 stars, closer to 4.5.",1462406400,,760,4.622222222222222

8044528,5,B00073I8M2,"I ordered this series for my dad who is so obsessed with it, and was looking for it a long time.
It arrived early(which is awesome)
The packaging was amazing and well organized in its original box.
The quality is good (its a DVD not Blu Ray), the sound perfect.
My dad was so happy as well as I.
Note: it doesn't work in the States( it's a region 2) (which is perfect for my dad)",1437004800,2,379,4.0
8044529,2,B00073I8M2,"A bit dorky. Plus, it's dubbed (or dumbed) into English and I would prefer watching it in Chinese.",1429401600,,98,4.5
8044530,4,B00073I8M2,"The information about this movie is completely wrong.  It refers to a 13 episode Japanese jidaigeki television series based on the ancient Chinese novel Water Margin (aka Outlaws of the Marsh, aka Suidoken): [...]

In reality this is a typical Chinese Wuxia film probably from the 70's, likely set during the Qing dynasty (1644-1912).  There don't seem to be any credits, and it is dubbed with a single title shot ""Water Margin"", so I'm not sure what the film actually is.

If you are a fan of the 70's Shaw Brothers & Golden Harvest chop-socky with bad dubbing, then this is a fun and entertaining film.  If you're looking for the Japanese television series, then you'll be disappointed.",1399334400,4,688,4.796610169491525
8044531,4,B00073I8M2,"I was introduced to The Water Margin while on a visit to London in November 1976.  Unlike I, Claudius, which was also on TV in Britain in 1976, The Water Margin never made it to the US.  Too bad what a great, fun way to spend a Saturday afternoon!  It's a shame that since all our DVD players and TVs are made in the East that they aren't multi-system compatible from the get-go, then I wouldn't be deprived of my fun!",1310601600,,418,4.135802469135802
