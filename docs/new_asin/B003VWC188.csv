8407156,5,B003VWC188,GREAT MOVIE.  I love to see how the Filipino people helped the Vietnamese.,1435104000,,74,4.6923076923076925
8407157,5,B003VWC188,"This documentary is well put together  and depicts a first hand account retold by the actual survivor.  It is by far not comprehensive enough nor long enough to tell the entire story of the vietnamese people  nor enough to fully understsnd their ordeal  but is a starting point,  epscially given how most released  documentary media is usually based from the american perspective.

A good pairing for Bolinao 52 viewers would be to include American Perspective: Last Days In Vietnam as well as Journey From the Fall.

Watching all 3 of those films together will at least give you a well rounded base to begin to comprehend what happened during the war, and why the south vietnamese that died during the war, at sea or even the ones today who live in the US, live with many scars that no government  restitution can amount  to cover up.",1426723200,,835,4.657534246575342
8407158,4,B003VWC188,Good documentary but not 100% true. I really want to seeing the whole story and what happen with the Captain USS ship in the end of this movie?,1403136000,,143,4.142857142857143
8407159,3,B003VWC188,"It's back in 1975 - 1985, after the Vietnam war, the American troops pulled out of Vietnam.  It's great story, but it's not enough to describe or to represent a complete story for all other Vietnamese people.  However, it's very interesting to watch and hope more and more people tell their refugee stories.",1370995200,,307,4.773584905660377
8407160,5,B003VWC188,"I love it! It brought  back so much memories of my past. Thanks Duc Nguyen for your great effort to make this documentary film.
A must see film.",1368921600,,144,4.142857142857143
8407161,5,B003VWC188,This was great! It gave me a whole new appreciation for my parents. I highly recommend this documentary to everyone.,1345507200,,116,4.85
