3136042,2,B0014Z4OM0,This was quite an unsatisfying movie. I bought it because of Matthew Perry and the description made it sound like a drama/comedy. Unfortunately there was nothing funny about it. Most of the acting was flat and at times the story line was so boring that I fast forwarded.,1217116800,3,270,4.645833333333333
3136043,1,B0014Z4OM0,"I picked this movie up because Matthew Perry and Mary Steenburgen almost always deliver but this was one was a real disappointment.  Matthew Perry's character is experiencing a period of depersonalization and life has gone flat - no highs, no lows.  Unfortunately, the movie suffered from the same condition.  He's depressed and he's looking for answers - along the way, he discovers a beautiful girl.  Perry's character goes from one condescending therapist to another and that could be funny...but it isn't.  The interactions with his family should add something to the plot but it really doesn't.  He even breaks up with the beautiful girl and that should provide some anti-climax, but it doesn't. A little ways into the movie, Perry's character steals a pen from the drug store - the kleptomania  is only a device that is needed in the break-up scene; it doesn't really get explained or resolved once it is no longer necessaryto the plot. A couple of nude shots and a ton of uses of the ""F-word"" are thrown in to try to keep the audience from going numb but it's like trying to revive a dying patient by sticking their tongue between the posts of a 9-volt battery, rather than using a defibrillator.

The movie kept reminding me of a couple of Bill Murray movies - ""Lost in Translation"" and ""Broken Flowers"" and I'm just not sure we really need one more movie about a jaded, self-absorbed person shuffling blandly through the lives of those around him.",1216512000,4,1456,4.772908366533865
3136044,5,B0014Z4OM0,"Most people who view this movie will not be able to actually enjoy the movie for what is worth. I myself have ""depersonalization/derealization"" and the movie is pretty much my life in a nutshell. Very humorous, with a love story involved. I am just glad the director who himself suffers from this dissociative disorder, tries to spread the world about how we are here in the world without any medicine to help subside the problems and anxiety that comes from feeling like Matthew Perry does in the movie.",1214956800,6,504,4.738636363636363
3136045,5,B0014Z4OM0,I picked this up b/c it had Matthew Perry on the cover. I have always been a fan of his acting. I loved him on Friends and was curious what he could bring to another character. At times I felt almost as though I was his character..meaning..he really seemed to bring the character to life in a way that you almost felt like you were a part of it and what he was going through. His portrayal of Hudson Milbank was flawless. There were some funny scenes...I am glad I saw it and look forward to more great movies from this very talented actor.,1213660800,3,540,4.201923076923077
3136046,4,B0014Z4OM0,"Synopsis: The '08 release `Numb' stars Matthew Perry in the role of Hudson Milbank a anxiety ridden loner suffering from depersonalization disorder. Despite his own efforts to sabotage every opportunity to have a meaningful relationship he nevertheless finds himself dating Sarah, a beautiful, successful and obviously love struck young woman who pursues him in spite of all his psychological shortcomings. Will Hudson continue to be his own worst enemy and find himself alone once again or will he finally pull himself together and find the happiness that has eluded him all his life?

Critique: This is a rather low budget film you've probably never heard of. You probably wouldn't consider renting this one either except for the fact that is stars the talented Matthew Perry. At least that's what attracted me to this film. I have to say I was rather pleasantly surprised and would like to say, ""Thanks Matthew"". `Numb' is definitely a dark comedy with a kick. It's kind of like watching a Woody Allen film without the New York accent and the Jewish affiliation. If you're familiar with Woody's body of work you know exactly what I'm talking about. You might say it's ""Angst for Anglos"" (is that politically incorrect?).

If you're a Matthew Perry fan you're sure to enjoy it and fan or not you'll definitely fall in love with Lynn Collins in the role of Sarah.",1211673600,8,1364,4.9004329004329
3136047,4,B0014Z4OM0,"In the director's commentary, Harris Goldberg says that people have responded to this movie for three reasons: 1)The Love Story. 2)The Actors' performances and/or 3)For the depiction of Depersonalization. There are a core group of people who identify with the story and are glad to see depersonalization depicted on film. As Goldberg states, it tends to help people to see this movie and realize, ""Oh, I'm not the only one.""

Matthew Perry performs admirably as Hudson Milbank. Hudson still knows what is real and what is not real although the whole shebang doesn't FEEL real to him anymore. He can live ""as if"" he is fine and in many cases people may not realize there is anything wrong with him. If anything appears odd about him it is that he seems overly anxious, overly spacey, and that he tends to tell store clerks that life feels unreal. He seems intent on figuring out what is going on with him and to find someone who knows what he is talking about. Anybody who has experienced depersonalization knows what this is like. I think Matthew Perry, as well as writer/director Harris Goldberg, were correct in playing less is more for most of this. There are also specific things in this portrayal which were particular and familiar, such as Hudson counting the number of days he'd lived and how many he was likely yet to live.

This is the first movie I recall seeing where the main character has depersonalization disorder. (this is amazing considering how many other conditions have been explored on film through the years.) I wonder if the world and others are catching up with the depersonalization experience and/or it is becoming more common and/or understood. Or perhaps it is simply that more people are now using the diagnostic name. Writers have written about unreality and the dream-like experience of life for ages, as have meditators and mystics...(see also all the movies about dreams, dream-like realities, life-being-like-a-dream) So is depersonalization a disorder, or a major factor of being human?

I think people who want a cute Matthew Perry movie that is funny and sweet may not get entirely what they expect. ""Numb"" could have been marketed more like another truthful and funny (as in the humor that comes from pain and from daily and mundane life as well) movie -- The Savages.

In sound-bites Numb sounds like a movie about a man trying to get well in order to ""win the girl"" in a kind of mad dash through psychiatry-- Well, it is more complicated than that, and for one thing it seems more about a man who is trying to get well so he can feel alive and experience his life. Being in love is a big part of that, but you can't feel anything when you are depersonalized, even when it is right in front of you.

Although you may not think it would be, this is a hopeful film.
  _______________________________________________________________

** A couple asides:  there are two other books about dissociation in addition to ""Feeling Unreal"" -- called ""The Myth of Sanity"" and ""The Stranger in the Mirror"" There may be more, but these are others I've found.

**To clarify something other reviewers mentioned, in the movie Hudson states he had a predisposition to depersonalization before he smoked marijuana, although marijuana, as well as some of the medications and antipsychotics he is prescribed later in the movie don't seem to help and/or exacerbate his sense of unreality.

**The interactions between Hudson and his parents are extraordinary. Well-written, spot on.",1211155200,29,3498,4.891891891891892
3136048,3,B0014Z4OM0,"First of all, this isn't really a romantic comedy.

You might be thinking that a movie starring Matthew Perry with a personality disorder would be a funny ha-ha movie in the vein of ""Friends"", but you need to know that this movie is more a dramedy, with a darker type of humor.

Perry's character Hudson Milbank suffers from Depersonalization Disorder (DPD), which is a real dissociative disorder in which affected people feel disconnected from their bodies, and have difficulty relating to reality.

Brought on by overenthusiastic smoking of the funny cigarettes, Milbank's life goes into a downward spiral, and his doctor recommends psychiatric treatment.  He meets a girl named Sara (Lynn Collins) who seems drawn to guys with problems, and she becomes a beacon in his disassociated life.  The thing is, can he keep her?

The funniest moments occur during the sessions with the Psychiatrists, each with a unique method for curing his problem.  In particular, look for Mary Steenburgen, in a small, but entertaining turn as Dr. Blaine.

3136049,5,B0014Z4OM0,"There are movies that, in time, garner a cult following, for reasons most people can't fathom, or don't care too. This is likely to happen with Harris Goldberg's ""Numb.""  The scant reviews emerging from the Tribeca Film Festival thus far have pointed out that the script is pretty much autobiographical, based on Harris Goldberg's own experience with something called Depersonalization, triggered by pot.  Sounds like a pretty  extreme and rare reaction to weed, and a pretty weak premise on which to base an entire movie, right?  No.  Just the opposite.  Depersonalization Disorder is something quite real, and a condition that, incredibly, affects more people than either schizophrenia or bi-polar disorders. Yet few people, even relatively few health professionals have ever heard of it.  It can be triggered by various forms of stress or trauma, as well as things like LSD and marijuana. The confusion, frustration and inability to deal with ""normal"" life that often marks DPD is portrayed beautifully by Matthew Perry, whose eyes, at times reveal the void left behind by a soul that has simply disappeared. Lack of affect, ""numbness"" is just one of many symptoms of depersonalization, but it is likely the one most movie viewers can relate to, and perhaps, the simplest to portray. In this sense, Harris Goldberg has wisely avoided extensive diving into the fearfully negative and hopeless waters of DPD. Instead, he gives us important glimpses into the overall angst of the condition as well as the sufferer's desperate efforts to resume a ""normal"" life.  And he manages to do this within a comedic context.  DPD is NOT depression, you see, nor is it humorless.  People with the condition are often highly intelligent, and more often than not, they can exhibit extreme insight and a biting wit, simply because their ego, or lack thereof, never stands in the way.
Ultimately, this film marks the very first mention of Depersonalization Disorder on the big screen.  It is the first depiction of someone who has it. On top of it, Goldberg has generously shown Perry reading the only authoritative book on the condition ""Feeling Unreal"" right in the middle of the film.  Creating this film, which is funny and highly entertaining by any standard, marks a singular act of courage on the part of the writer/director. According to Hollywood: Everyone knows that pot is always harmless, right?  Wrong.  According to the medical profession: Depersonalization is just a symptom of some other condition, right. Wrong again. Goldberg has, if nothing else, boldly stated these truths by tickling the funny bone rather than the temporal lobe. Literally millions of people already know these truths, and therein lies the film's audience, for a long long time.",1205625600,20,2750,5.109375
3136050,2,B0014Z4OM0,"Not a good movie at all. Matthew Perry is..... eh. I would give this movie one star, but I could relate to the character's depersonalization/derealization symptoms, so that's something. I didn't expect this to be a particularly exciting movie, but it sucked even more than I thought it would. I probably wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, not even someone with depersonalization disorder. I barely remember what happened at the end. I think 2 stars is actually being generous here.",1481846400,,487,5.1

3136054,4,B0014Z4OM0,"Those who have suffered anxiety/depression along with depersonalization/derealization will like this movie because finally there is a movie about DP-DR!

Anyone can get DP/DR( separately or together) when they are subjected to high amounts of stress.  Often latent mental illnesses come to the forefront after indulging in pot.  This does not happen to everyone, but it does happen to a lot of people; leaving them confused on how that one episode of pot use left them feeling completely different and unable to snap out of DP/DR.

There are forums now online for DP/DR sufferers.

Only those who have personally been there or who know someone suffering from such will get the gist of Matthew Perry's characters angst.
Sure he has anxiety and depression but having DP/DR to deal with just tosses in something that adds even more pain and fear to the mix of already being in a state of emotional turmoil.

A great vid for those who can finally say"" Wow- this character portrayal is spot on!""  Also, the grief of dealing with callous to disinterested mental health professionals is represented here and that is also a conundrum many people deal with while seeking help.

Kudos to the man who decided to bring his life story to the screen.

 The movie is based on a man who experienced the nightmare known as DP/DR - check out more about it on the movie credits.

Or go to IMDB dot com to find this movie and any related info.

Also, the Wikipedia listing of this movie should also provide the name of the man who this movie is based on.

This movie can be deemed helpful in that it lets those with DP/DR realize that as alone as they feel - many, many other people also suffer in this way, too.

If you are not sure if you have DP/DR or what it is, just look up: Depersonalization  & Derealization on any psych help site,to understand the symptoms of each",1449705600,,1853,4.589665653495441

3136057,5,B0014Z4OM0,"This movie is amazing! It is a true wake up call for anyone suffering from DPD. This disorder is one of the most under-studied in the field of psychiatry and should be given way more attention. I believe that I myself was misdiagnosed with depression and ADHD, when in-fact I described all the symptoms of DPD when I saw my doctor(I love life and all of it's facets, but I felt like I was living in a ""haze""). The truth is that there is no real medication that will cure DPD(at this point in time), but don't let this disparage you. There are way too many people that are also living with this, and you are NOT alone! Hopefully there will be more research on this disorder in the next few years, but I've found that the best thing you can do is to force oneself to socialize, as mentioned in the film.",1442966400,,801,4.241830065359477

For anyone who has experienced this mental state - depersonalization - a rarely discussed disorder/condition, I think you'll be very happy to find not only a film about this disorder, but a pretty damn good one, at that! This film features great acting, a really good sense of humor, and even packs in some very real facts about experiencing the often-crippling mental heath disorder. I had to deal with this for a short time following cancer treatment in 2003, and I can tell you, I've never been through anything worse in my life - including the cancer itself. The sense that reality is not reality is almost inexplicable to anyone who hasn't experienced it. But, this film goes a long way to explaining it to the general public. Not to mention, the love story is engaging, and I found myself sympathizing with Matthew Perry's character and his inability to achieve a healthy, loving relationship due to his illness. Quite a good movie, all around, and I'd certainly recommend it - though please note my very personal bias in having lived through this disorder myself. I don't honestly know what the general public would think of it, if they had no experience in dealing with disassociation.",1425772800,5,1245,4.7953488372093025

3136070,5,B0014Z4OM0,"5 stars for Lynn Collins and Lynn Collins only. Bought this after watching John Carter (MUCH better than its reviews and box office suggest) To those who say it was a rip-off of Star Wars and Avatar, it is based on a 102-year-old book that influenced those movies and many other sci-fi/fantasy books/movies of the 20th-century. It should have been a star-making role that led to her being cast as Wonder Woman. Who knows?  Maybe she likes indies, wants to be taken seriously, or simply hasn't had that magic ingredient -- luck. She looks entirely different, and equally lovely, in each role. Maybe that talent actually works against her.

Anyway, NUMB is a typical indie. Good but not great. I have a lot (too much) in common with the Matthew Perry character and am not a magnet for women like the Lynn Collins character. And while I'm no George Clooney, I'm not Quasimodo, either. Worth savoring for her performance, and her fetching loveliness. And, as of this writing, only $5.99 on Amazon Instant Video, Check her out.",1413676800,,1022,4.768361581920904
3136071,3,B0014Z4OM0,"As I write this, there are only 28 other reviews of Numb posted, which is slightly astounding when one considers that the film was released a full 7 years ago. I downloaded Numb from ZML onto an external hard drive a few years ago and promptly forgot about it until now. Glad I finally watched it.

The music selected, the actors chosen, and the generous helpings of unlikely happenstance in the plot all point to the makings of a romantic comedy, yet through much of the film you would feel uneasy about classifying it as such. I was unsure about where Numb was taking me and how it was supposed to be making me feel. Perhaps ""black comedy"" would be a suitable descriptor. In the very least, Numb will add ""depersonalization disorder"" to your vocabulary (it did for me), which (according to Wikipedia) affects as much as 2% of the population.

Matthew Perry did well enough as Hudson Milbank, but Lynn Collins did even better in her portrayal of his love interest. Mary Steenburgen was also quite a good pick, and she excelled in the role chosen for her. Now, I've been known to enjoy a good ""chick flick"" from time to time, but after starting to watch Numb I was really hoping that this particular film wouldn't aspire to be one. No such luck... the Hollywood Happy Ending left me without any doubt.

The flippant, exaggerated portrayals of the mental health professionals were a downside. I understand that interesting characters are essential for drawing in the audience, but Numb went over the top. I had wanted to believe that this story was possible, but the characters and the ending of Numb just didn't allow for it.

Final verdict: *not* a waste of time. If you are looking for a romantic comedy, be prepared for a more somber version of it, and to purportedly learn about something out of the DSM-5.",1409270400,2,1810,4.629283489096573

3136081,5,B0014Z4OM0,"I acquired depersonalization disorder shortly after this movie came out, and eventually overcame the disorder, creating a video program for other sufferers.

On so many levels, this movie is a mirror of my experiences, and since it's based on Harris Goldberg's life, this means I have a lot in common with him, as he is portrayed by Matthew Perry's character ""Hudson"".

I, like the protagonist, acquired DP immediately after smoking a large amount of marijuana, thinking that I was going insane.  Hudson watches golf on television to comfort himself, and I engaged in similar behaviors.  Like the lead character, I also had an unconcerned family that didn't understand what I was going through.

Hudson goes to ignorant psychiatrist after psychiatrist only to be given information of no use.  They prescribe him medications with side effects (medications can't cure depersonalization and often make it worse).  I'm glad that Harris decided to bash big pharma and their endless lust for money by pushing pills down people's throats.

The major problem with this movie I have is that the ending gives no hope to people who suffer.  It's an eerily familiar portrayal of everything I experienced, except for the end, where I recovered and Hudson didn't.  Though many people never recover from DP, that isn't true for everyone.  For those who never recover, it is a fitting ending, where one slips into an endless numbness to reality and to their sense of self.",1301961600,5,1456,5.025

There is not an identifyingly plausible real character, relationship or scenario in the entire movie. I am as capable of accepting a suspension of strict realism for the sake of a good story or deeper underlying premise as anyone, but that does not apply here. As with most contemporary movies, the concept of the screenplay as a living organism that should have some kind of coherence in all its myriad parts is apparently a foreign concept. Whatever psychological condition the Matthew Perry character has which causes him to experience life in some markedly different way from anybody else--i.e. the key to the entire movie--is not conveyed at all. Nothing tangentially related to him--how he earns enough money that it is seemingly no object to him, why various women characters find him sexually desirable--make any sense within the context of the movie. Lynn Collins is cute and is the kind of girl one might dream of encountering at the pool table in the neighborhood dive bar in Rochester, but she certainly has no future as a movie star. The Mary Steenbergen character is completely ridiculous, and all of the minor characters are wholly flat, and the scenes involving them clunky and lifeless, the dialogue banal.

3136084,5,B0014Z4OM0,"Some ambitious headshrinker has come up with a new term for the condition formerly known as anomie, so naturally there's been a film made on the subject. That's been standard practice since the U.S. Army coined the phrase ""battle fatigue"" during World War II for the condition that was originally termed ""soldier's heart"" in the Civil War, shell shock"" during World War I and is presently referred to as post-traumatic stress disorder. Newer and scarier terms for mental abnormalities are always profitable for the unhappiness curanderos, especially when they turn up on the big screen. If a viewer of ""Numb,"" thinks he may be suffering from depersonalization, there are several blatant references to where and how he can start treatment in the movie, one of which is a lingering shot of a book cover on the topic with the title and author's name prominently displayed. That being said however, ""Numb"" is a first-rate comedy-drama which is fast-moving, literate, well-directed, marvelously cast, expertly edited and highly entertaining. It never succumbs to the temptations of becoming clinical, drearily introspective or overly self-indulgent. Matthew Perry shines in his dramatic moments as well as his comedic segues, Kevin Pollak's performance is Oscar quality as always, Lynn Collins is a breath of fresh air who has the makings of a major motion picture star and writer-turned-director Harris Goldberg really knows his stuff. I hope we see a lot more of all their work in the future.",1279843200,2,1489,5.182572614107884
3136085,4,B0014Z4OM0,"I happened on this movie while channel surfing and was taken aback at seeing M. Perry playing what appeared to be a clueless person. I realized as the movie progressed that he was playing the part of someone with depersonalization disorder.  He did a great job of pulling that off, played it just right.  Mary Steenburgen was great in her supporting role.

My one gripe about the movie is its mysterious ending.  The MP character gets picked up in a car but we don't see who is driving.  And there's a ""happily ever after"" tone to the end as they drive off.  Who was that?  Sara?  Give me a clue.",1254182400,2,596,4.3545454545454545

It is just so important to care for the human body well as much as possible nowadays.  You just never know when a lifestyle choice will pull the trigger on something your genes are holding for you.

And a lifestyle choice can be anything from how you eat, exercise, manage stress and medical choices such as choosing to take vaccines and drugs.

Short of some horrible accident that is beyond a person's control these choices will determine a long life of quality or one of suffering and challenges that could have been prevented.

I know this isn't a review of the movie but it sure made a statement in the area of health care. I'd recommend it to those who might need a kick in the pants to make better choices.  Once something is turned on, it's mighty hard to turn it off as this young man realized much too late.",1254096000,3,1028,4.378947368421053
3136087,5,B0014Z4OM0,"I laughed hysterically in some parts. Mostly laughing at myself. I am a Person With CFS/ME (PWC not DPD!) and totally relate to Matthew Perry's character in the movie. Although CFS/ME is very different and not what this guy in the movie has, I relate to that he seems intent on figuring out what is going on with him, and to find some one who knows what he is talking about (so funny in the movie), people running away from him and his problem, including his family's negative reaction to him and his problem (again, some hysterically funny parts). Doctor's not knowing his condition. His feeling of being used by the medical profession (more sarcastic humor). His experience of ending up with unsuitable girlfriends who try help him (I've got tears from laughter by now). Even his compulsive shoplifting (which I doubt is part and parcel of DPD and certainly not part of CFS). I relate even to his business success despite his problem, and even his business partner, who is nice enough, but there's no real communication, no real connection to nourish his soul in the one ""normal"" relationship he has. He's alone with his problem. There are many things that are different between CFS and this guy's disorder, but his experience is part of my experience in this society and my family with an unpopular, often derided, health problem, that is not properly understood. The movie gives important glimpses into the overall angst of the condition as well as the sufferer's desperate efforts to resume a ""normal"" life. Yet the movie is absolutely comical and a pleasant watch! Well, and a tear jerker for me (because it's a mirror of my life!).",1248739200,4,1638,4.77112676056338

I have been a fan of Matthew Perry since I had first seen the show Friends years ago, I have always been a fan of that Chandler/David Spade type A-Hole humor. So I have followed him since the show has ended, I mean come on he did a movie with the great Bruce Campbell. I have bought almost all the films he has been in, and I will eventually buy them all. This is one of his newer films and I have to say hat it could be one of his best performances ever, and very dramatic role that some may not have expected of him.

Hudson Milbank [Perry] has Depersonalization Disorder and he really believes that he is going crazy, if fact things don't feel or seem real to him. So he sets out on a course to find out how he can fix this problem that he believes was caused by smoking weed. In the midst of going to psychiatrist after psychiatrist he meets a girl that can actually make him feel real. Of course all his doctors are as crazy as him, in fact one is infatuated with him, and she is all over him. The man has to take a long personal journey that may or may not fix him, in fact that is what I like most about this film. By the end of it he is getting better but he is not quite fixed, I love when films end like that. Don't get me wrong this is not a fully drama type film, there is a lot of dark humor through out the film.

Matthew Perry who also served as an Executive Producer did a great job with his role, he plays the role very held back and dry and that is just what the character needed. He played the role exactly like the director wanted from what I gather from special features, he did a great job. Kevin Pollak as usual does a great job as Perry's best friend and writing partner, he delivers a wonderful performance. Lynn Collins does a great job as the girl Perry's character is in love with, she is just as crazy as Hudson. But I have to say that my favorite from the supporting roles was Mary Steenburgen as the crazy doctor that he goes to see is great. She played the role so well that I actually believed her in that role, she flipped so quick it was great.

Writer/director Harris Goldberg did an excellent job that from listening to the commentary he wrote the entire thing based off his life. He had this disorder and the same problems with his new found girl and doctors, and you can tell he put his heart into this. He is the guy that wrote both Deuce Bigalow films and With Out a Paddle so I can tell that this was his baby as far as all his films go. I think that this is a really good movie that warrants a purchase in my mind, everybody involved did a great job.

If you are wanting to see a really good some what weird but some what funny movie this is the one for you. This is a great dramatic turn for Perry and I hope that he continues to switch between dramatic and comedy roles like this.",1231804800,2,2831,4.048214285714286
3136089,5,B0014Z4OM0,"This is Matthew Perry's best movie. It shows him being a mental case that painfully goes through life looking for cures to his illness. Along the way he meets a few girls and always has his wingman but his constant struggle with his own reality is what compells this movie into greatness. It's a rare view for the movie junkie to see. It kind of does for Matthew Perry what ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" did for Jim Carrey. As much as I liked the Carrey movie, at times it was very confusing. This flick however stays with you the whole way , with laughs and new discoveries along the way. A must see for the true critic.",1220832000,3,631,4.310924369747899

Most of the acting was flat and at times the story line was so boring that I fast forwarded.,1217116800,3,270,4.645833333333333
3370540,1,B0014Z4OM0,"I picked this movie up because Matthew Perry and Mary Steenburgen almost always deliver but this was one was a real disappointment.  Matthew Perry's character is experiencing a period of depersonalization and life has gone flat - no highs, no lows.  Unfortunately, the movie suffered from the same condition.  He's depressed and he's looking for answers - along the way, he discovers a beautiful girl.  Perry's character goes from one condescending therapist to another and that could be funny...but it isn't.  The interactions with his family should add something to the plot but it really doesn't.  He even breaks up with the beautiful girl and that should provide some anti-climax, but it doesn't. A little ways into the movie, Perry's character steals a pen from the drug store - the kleptomania  is only a device that is needed in the break-up scene; it doesn't really get explained or resolved once it is no longer necessaryto the plot. A couple of nude shots and a ton of uses of the ""F-word"" are thrown in to try to keep the audience from going numb but it's like trying to revive a dying patient by sticking their tongue between the posts of a 9-volt battery, rather than using a defibrillator.

The movie kept reminding me of a couple of Bill Murray movies - ""Lost in Translation"" and ""Broken Flowers"" and I'm just not sure we really need one more movie about a jaded, self-absorbed person shuffling blandly through the lives of those around him.",1216512000,4,1456,4.772908366533865

At times I felt almost as though I was his character..meaning..he really seemed to bring the character to life in a way that you almost felt like you were a part of it and what he was going through. His portrayal of Hudson Milbank was flawless. There were some funny scenes...I am glad I saw it and look forward to more great movies from this very talented actor.,1213660800,3,540,4.201923076923077
3370543,4,B0014Z4OM0,"Synopsis: The '08 release `Numb' stars Matthew Perry in the role of Hudson Milbank a anxiety ridden loner suffering from depersonalization disorder. Despite his own efforts to sabotage every opportunity to have a meaningful relationship he nevertheless finds himself dating Sarah, a beautiful, successful and obviously love struck young woman who pursues him in spite of all his psychological shortcomings. Will Hudson continue to be his own worst enemy and find himself alone once again or will he finally pull himself together and find the happiness that has eluded him all his life?

Critique: This is a rather low budget film you've probably never heard of. You probably wouldn't consider renting this one either except for the fact that is stars the talented Matthew Perry. At least that's what attracted me to this film. I have to say I was rather pleasantly surprised and would like to say, ""Thanks Matthew"". `Numb' is definitely a dark comedy with a kick. It's kind of like watching a Woody Allen film without the New York accent and the Jewish affiliation. If you're familiar with Woody's body of work you know exactly what I'm talking about. You might say it's ""Angst for Anglos"" (is that politically incorrect?).

If you're a Matthew Perry fan you're sure to enjoy it and fan or not you'll definitely fall in love with Lynn Collins in the role of Sarah.",1211673600,8,1364,4.9004329004329
3370544,4,B0014Z4OM0,"In the director's commentary, Harris Goldberg says that people have responded to this movie for three reasons: 1)The Love Story. 2)The Actors' performances and/or 3)For the depiction of Depersonalization. There are a core group of people who identify with the story and are glad to see depersonalization depicted on film. As Goldberg states, it tends to help people to see this movie and realize, ""Oh, I'm not the only one.""

Matthew Perry performs admirably as Hudson Milbank. Hudson still knows what is real and what is not real although the whole shebang doesn't FEEL real to him anymore. He can live ""as if"" he is fine and in many cases people may not realize there is anything wrong with him. If anything appears odd about him it is that he seems overly anxious, overly spacey, and that he tends to tell store clerks that life feels unreal. He seems intent on figuring out what is going on with him and to find someone who knows what he is talking about. Anybody who has experienced depersonalization knows what this is like. I think Matthew Perry, as well as writer/director Harris Goldberg, were correct in playing less is more for most of this. There are also specific things in this portrayal which were particular and familiar, such as Hudson counting the number of days he'd lived and how many he was likely yet to live.

This is the first movie I recall seeing where the main character has depersonalization disorder. (this is amazing considering how many other conditions have been explored on film through the years.) I wonder if the world and others are catching up with the depersonalization experience and/or it is becoming more common and/or understood. Or perhaps it is simply that more people are now using the diagnostic name. Writers have written about unreality and the dream-like experience of life for ages, as have meditators and mystics...(see also all the movies about dreams, dream-like realities, life-being-like-a-dream) So is depersonalization a disorder, or a major factor of being human?

I think people who want a cute Matthew Perry movie that is funny and sweet may not get entirely what they expect. ""Numb"" could have been marketed more like another truthful and funny (as in the humor that comes from pain and from daily and mundane life as well) movie -- The Savages.

In sound-bites Numb sounds like a movie about a man trying to get well in order to ""win the girl"" in a kind of mad dash through psychiatry-- Well, it is more complicated than that, and for one thing it seems more about a man who is trying to get well so he can feel alive and experience his life. Being in love is a big part of that, but you can't feel anything when you are depersonalized, even when it is right in front of you.

Although you may not think it would be, this is a hopeful film.
  _______________________________________________________________

** A couple asides:  there are two other books about dissociation in addition to ""Feeling Unreal"" -- called ""The Myth of Sanity"" and ""The Stranger in the Mirror"" There may be more, but these are others I've found.

**To clarify something other reviewers mentioned, in the movie Hudson states he had a predisposition to depersonalization before he smoked marijuana, although marijuana, as well as some of the medications and antipsychotics he is prescribed later in the movie don't seem to help and/or exacerbate his sense of unreality.

**The interactions between Hudson and his parents are extraordinary. Well-written, spot on.",1211155200,29,3498,4.891891891891892
3370545,3,B0014Z4OM0,"First of all, this isn't really a romantic comedy.

You might be thinking that a movie starring Matthew Perry with a personality disorder would be a funny ha-ha movie in the vein of ""Friends"", but you need to know that this movie is more a dramedy, with a darker type of humor.

Perry's character Hudson Milbank suffers from Depersonalization Disorder (DPD), which is a real dissociative disorder in which affected people feel disconnected from their bodies, and have difficulty relating to reality.

Brought on by overenthusiastic smoking of the funny cigarettes, Milbank's life goes into a downward spiral, and his doctor recommends psychiatric treatment.  He meets a girl named Sara (Lynn Collins) who seems drawn to guys with problems, and she becomes a beacon in his disassociated life.  The thing is, can he keep her?

The funniest moments occur during the sessions with the Psychiatrists, each with a unique method for curing his problem.  In particular, look for Mary Steenburgen, in a small, but entertaining turn as Dr. Blaine.

3370546,5,B0014Z4OM0,"There are movies that, in time, garner a cult following, for reasons most people can't fathom, or don't care too. This is likely to happen with Harris Goldberg's ""Numb.""  The scant reviews emerging from the Tribeca Film Festival thus far have pointed out that the script is pretty much autobiographical, based on Harris Goldberg's own experience with something called Depersonalization, triggered by pot.  Sounds like a pretty  extreme and rare reaction to weed, and a pretty weak premise on which to base an entire movie, right?  No.  Just the opposite.  Depersonalization Disorder is something quite real, and a condition that, incredibly, affects more people than either schizophrenia or bi-polar disorders. Yet few people, even relatively few health professionals have ever heard of it.  It can be triggered by various forms of stress or trauma, as well as things like LSD and marijuana. The confusion, frustration and inability to deal with ""normal"" life that often marks DPD is portrayed beautifully by Matthew Perry, whose eyes, at times reveal the void left behind by a soul that has simply disappeared. Lack of affect, ""numbness"" is just one of many symptoms of depersonalization, but it is likely the one most movie viewers can relate to, and perhaps, the simplest to portray. In this sense, Harris Goldberg has wisely avoided extensive diving into the fearfully negative and hopeless waters of DPD. Instead, he gives us important glimpses into the overall angst of the condition as well as the sufferer's desperate efforts to resume a ""normal"" life.  And he manages to do this within a comedic context.  DPD is NOT depression, you see, nor is it humorless.  People with the condition are often highly intelligent, and more often than not, they can exhibit extreme insight and a biting wit, simply because their ego, or lack thereof, never stands in the way.
Ultimately, this film marks the very first mention of Depersonalization Disorder on the big screen.  It is the first depiction of someone who has it. On top of it, Goldberg has generously shown Perry reading the only authoritative book on the condition ""Feeling Unreal"" right in the middle of the film.  Creating this film, which is funny and highly entertaining by any standard, marks a singular act of courage on the part of the writer/director. According to Hollywood: Everyone knows that pot is always harmless, right?  Wrong.  According to the medical profession: Depersonalization is just a symptom of some other condition, right. Wrong again. Goldberg has, if nothing else, boldly stated these truths by tickling the funny bone rather than the temporal lobe. Literally millions of people already know these truths, and therein lies the film's audience, for a long long time.",1205625600,20,2750,5.109375

Anyone can get DP/DR( separately or together) when they are subjected to high amounts of stress.  Often latent mental illnesses come to the forefront after indulging in pot.  This does not happen to everyone, but it does happen to a lot of people; leaving them confused on how that one episode of pot use left them feeling completely different and unable to snap out of DP/DR.

There are forums now online for DP/DR sufferers.

Only those who have personally been there or who know someone suffering from such will get the gist of Matthew Perry's characters angst.
Sure he has anxiety and depression but having DP/DR to deal with just tosses in something that adds even more pain and fear to the mix of already being in a state of emotional turmoil.

A great vid for those who can finally say"" Wow- this character portrayal is spot on!""  Also, the grief of dealing with callous to disinterested mental health professionals is represented here and that is also a conundrum many people deal with while seeking help.

Kudos to the man who decided to bring his life story to the screen.

 The movie is based on a man who experienced the nightmare known as DP/DR - check out more about it on the movie credits.

Or go to IMDB dot com to find this movie and any related info.

Also, the Wikipedia listing of this movie should also provide the name of the man who this movie is based on.

This movie can be deemed helpful in that it lets those with DP/DR realize that as alone as they feel - many, many other people also suffer in this way, too.

For anyone who has experienced this mental state - depersonalization - a rarely discussed disorder/condition, I think you'll be very happy to find not only a film about this disorder, but a pretty damn good one, at that! This film features great acting, a really good sense of humor, and even packs in some very real facts about experiencing the often-crippling mental heath disorder. I had to deal with this for a short time following cancer treatment in 2003, and I can tell you, I've never been through anything worse in my life - including the cancer itself. The sense that reality is not reality is almost inexplicable to anyone who hasn't experienced it. But, this film goes a long way to explaining it to the general public. Not to mention, the love story is engaging, and I found myself sympathizing with Matthew Perry's character and his inability to achieve a healthy, loving relationship due to his illness. Quite a good movie, all around, and I'd certainly recommend it - though please note my very personal bias in having lived through this disorder myself.

Bought this after watching John Carter (MUCH better than its reviews and box office suggest) To those who say it was a rip-off of Star Wars and Avatar, it is based on a 102-year-old book that influenced those movies and many other sci-fi/fantasy books/movies of the 20th-century. It should have been a star-making role that led to her being cast as Wonder Woman. Who knows?  Maybe she likes indies, wants to be taken seriously, or simply hasn't had that magic ingredient -- luck. She looks entirely different, and equally lovely, in each role. Maybe that talent actually works against her.

Anyway, NUMB is a typical indie. Good but not great. I have a lot (too much) in common with the Matthew Perry character and am not a magnet for women like the Lynn Collins character. And while I'm no George Clooney, I'm not Quasimodo, either. Worth savoring for her performance, and her fetching loveliness. And, as of this writing, only $5.99 on Amazon Instant Video, Check her out.",1413676800,,1022,4.768361581920904
3370568,3,B0014Z4OM0,"As I write this, there are only 28 other reviews of Numb posted, which is slightly astounding when one considers that the film was released a full 7 years ago. I downloaded Numb from ZML onto an external hard drive a few years ago and promptly forgot about it until now. Glad I finally watched it.

The music selected, the actors chosen, and the generous helpings of unlikely happenstance in the plot all point to the makings of a romantic comedy, yet through much of the film you would feel uneasy about classifying it as such. I was unsure about where Numb was taking me and how it was supposed to be making me feel. Perhaps ""black comedy"" would be a suitable descriptor. In the very least, Numb will add ""depersonalization disorder"" to your vocabulary (it did for me), which (according to Wikipedia) affects as much as 2% of the population.

Matthew Perry did well enough as Hudson Milbank, but Lynn Collins did even better in her portrayal of his love interest. Mary Steenburgen was also quite a good pick, and she excelled in the role chosen for her. Now, I've been known to enjoy a good ""chick flick"" from time to time, but after starting to watch Numb I was really hoping that this particular film wouldn't aspire to be one. No such luck... the Hollywood Happy Ending left me without any doubt.

The flippant, exaggerated portrayals of the mental health professionals were a downside. I understand that interesting characters are essential for drawing in the audience, but Numb went over the top. I had wanted to believe that this story was possible, but the characters and the ending of Numb just didn't allow for it.

Final verdict: *not* a waste of time. If you are looking for a romantic comedy, be prepared for a more somber version of it, and to purportedly learn about something out of the DSM-5.",1409270400,2,1810,4.629283489096573

3370578,5,B0014Z4OM0,"I acquired depersonalization disorder shortly after this movie came out, and eventually overcame the disorder, creating a video program for other sufferers.

On so many levels, this movie is a mirror of my experiences, and since it's based on Harris Goldberg's life, this means I have a lot in common with him, as he is portrayed by Matthew Perry's character ""Hudson"".

I, like the protagonist, acquired DP immediately after smoking a large amount of marijuana, thinking that I was going insane.  Hudson watches golf on television to comfort himself, and I engaged in similar behaviors.  Like the lead character, I also had an unconcerned family that didn't understand what I was going through.

Hudson goes to ignorant psychiatrist after psychiatrist only to be given information of no use.  They prescribe him medications with side effects (medications can't cure depersonalization and often make it worse).  I'm glad that Harris decided to bash big pharma and their endless lust for money by pushing pills down people's throats.

The major problem with this movie I have is that the ending gives no hope to people who suffer.  It's an eerily familiar portrayal of everything I experienced, except for the end, where I recovered and Hudson didn't.  Though many people never recover from DP, that isn't true for everyone.  For those who never recover, it is a fitting ending, where one slips into an endless numbness to reality and to their sense of self.",1301961600,5,1456,5.025

There is not an identifyingly plausible real character, relationship or scenario in the entire movie. I am as capable of accepting a suspension of strict realism for the sake of a good story or deeper underlying premise as anyone, but that does not apply here. As with most contemporary movies, the concept of the screenplay as a living organism that should have some kind of coherence in all its myriad parts is apparently a foreign concept. Whatever psychological condition the Matthew Perry character has which causes him to experience life in some markedly different way from anybody else--i.e. the key to the entire movie--is not conveyed at all. Nothing tangentially related to him--how he earns enough money that it is seemingly no object to him, why various women characters find him sexually desirable--make any sense within the context of the movie. Lynn Collins is cute and is the kind of girl one might dream of encountering at the pool table in the neighborhood dive bar in Rochester, but she certainly has no future as a movie star. The Mary Steenbergen character is completely ridiculous, and all of the minor characters are wholly flat, and the scenes involving them clunky and lifeless, the dialogue banal. It's atrocious, and I'm only bothering to post a review because I need practice at identifying with some clarity to myself why things are inferior, and also to try to bring the overall rating of the film down.",1301270400,4,1542,4.934615384615385

Newer and scarier terms for mental abnormalities are always profitable for the unhappiness curanderos, especially when they turn up on the big screen. If a viewer of ""Numb,"" thinks he may be suffering from depersonalization, there are several blatant references to where and how he can start treatment in the movie, one of which is a lingering shot of a book cover on the topic with the title and author's name prominently displayed. That being said however, ""Numb"" is a first-rate comedy-drama which is fast-moving, literate, well-directed, marvelously cast, expertly edited and highly entertaining. It never succumbs to the temptations of becoming clinical, drearily introspective or overly self-indulgent.

Mary Steenburgen was great in her supporting role.

My one gripe about the movie is its mysterious ending.  The MP character gets picked up in a car but we don't see who is driving.  And there's a ""happily ever after"" tone to the end as they drive off.  Who was that?  Sara?  Give me a clue.",1254182400,2,596,4.3545454545454545

And a lifestyle choice can be anything from how you eat, exercise, manage stress and medical choices such as choosing to take vaccines and drugs.

Short of some horrible accident that is beyond a person's control these choices will determine a long life of quality or one of suffering and challenges that could have been prevented.

I know this isn't a review of the movie but it sure made a statement in the area of health care. I'd recommend it to those who might need a kick in the pants to make better choices.

Doctor's not knowing his condition. His feeling of being used by the medical profession (more sarcastic humor). His experience of ending up with unsuitable girlfriends who try help him (I've got tears from laughter by now). Even his compulsive shoplifting (which I doubt is part and parcel of DPD and certainly not part of CFS). I relate even to his business success despite his problem, and even his business partner, who is nice enough, but there's no real communication, no real connection to nourish his soul in the one ""normal"" relationship he has. He's alone with his problem. There are many things that are different between CFS and this guy's disorder, but his experience is part of my experience in this society and my family with an unpopular, often derided, health problem, that is not properly understood. The movie gives important glimpses into the overall angst of the condition as well as the sufferer's desperate efforts to resume a ""normal"" life.

I have been a fan of Matthew Perry since I had first seen the show Friends years ago, I have always been a fan of that Chandler/David Spade type A-Hole humor. So I have followed him since the show has ended, I mean come on he did a movie with the great Bruce Campbell. I have bought almost all the films he has been in, and I will eventually buy them all. This is one of his newer films and I have to say hat it could be one of his best performances ever, and very dramatic role that some may not have expected of him.

Hudson Milbank [Perry] has Depersonalization Disorder and he really believes that he is going crazy, if fact things don't feel or seem real to him. So he sets out on a course to find out how he can fix this problem that he believes was caused by smoking weed. In the midst of going to psychiatrist after psychiatrist he meets a girl that can actually make him feel real. Of course all his doctors are as crazy as him, in fact one is infatuated with him, and she is all over him. The man has to take a long personal journey that may or may not fix him, in fact that is what I like most about this film. By the end of it he is getting better but he is not quite fixed, I love when films end like that. Don't get me wrong this is not a fully drama type film, there is a lot of dark humor through out the film.

Matthew Perry who also served as an Executive Producer did a great job with his role, he plays the role very held back and dry and that is just what the character needed. He played the role exactly like the director wanted from what I gather from special features, he did a great job. Kevin Pollak as usual does a great job as Perry's best friend and writing partner, he delivers a wonderful performance. Lynn Collins does a great job as the girl Perry's character is in love with, she is just as crazy as Hudson. But I have to say that my favorite from the supporting roles was Mary Steenburgen as the crazy doctor that he goes to see is great. She played the role so well that I actually believed her in that role, she flipped so quick it was great.

Writer/director Harris Goldberg did an excellent job that from listening to the commentary he wrote the entire thing based off his life. He had this disorder and the same problems with his new found girl and doctors, and you can tell he put his heart into this. He is the guy that wrote both Deuce Bigalow films and With Out a Paddle so I can tell that this was his baby as far as all his films go. I think that this is a really good movie that warrants a purchase in my mind, everybody involved did a great job.

If you are wanting to see a really good some what weird but some what funny movie this is the one for you. This is a great dramatic turn for Perry and I hope that he continues to switch between dramatic and comedy roles like this.",1231804800,2,2831,4.048214285714286

It kind of does for Matthew Perry what ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" did for Jim Carrey. As much as I liked the Carrey movie, at times it was very confusing.

the plot

Hollywood screenwriter, Hudson Milbank is a pretty normal guy up until one day while hanging out with his friends, he smokes a marijuana joint by himself because of peer pressure, and when he finishes he runs out of the bar freaking out from the bad trip he finds himself on as a result of said joint.  His problems begin when it is the next day and he still cannot shake this awful trip he's on.  The days and weeks go by, and he still cannot shake it.  He goes to psychiatrists and psychologists and after therapy and drug therapy he still is in this altered state, which is diagnosed as depersonalization.  This is a mental condition that causes Hudson to feel as if he is uncomfortable in his own skin, detached from feeling real emotions, or stable inside his own head.

He meets a girl named Sara on one his very few days outside of his apartment, and she is drawn to him despite his condition.  Her ex-boyfriend had committed suicide and so Hudson theorizes that Sara is just drawn to screwed up men.  When he is with Sara, he doesn't feel better, yet he finds that he is able to deal remarkably better with his condition and he is able to function almost normally in social situations.  How long will Sara put up with this condition?  Will Hudson ever be cured?  Find out when you rent or buy Numb on DVD.

the breakdown

Writer/Director Harris Goldberg does an astounding job translating his vision of what he imagines the depersonalization condition to look like.  He makes it easy to empathize with Hudson played vividly by Matthew Perry.  The unsteady camera, the echo-filled audio and some camera trickery will probably serve up one of those acid-flashbacks to the days when you were doing those nasty illegal narcotics.  If you have never done any of those silly things, well you're going to get a taste of what it's like now.  I was very impressed with the effect and it easily drew me into the movie.

Matthew Perry was very funny, and it was nice to see him in a movie as the star.  He hasn't done too much since Friends ended in 2004, and recently the biggest movie he was in was 17 Again, where he is only seen in the very beginning and end of the film.  I noted above that I found Perry funny, and it made me think about how to classify this film, I suppose it is a dark romantic comedy, although there were scenes where you would believe this was a stark drama.  His romantic interest was Sara played by Lynn Collins, a beautiful actress from such films like X-Men Origins: Wolverine, The Lake House and The Number 23.  Her deep dimples are the perfect eye candy and her comedic timing is enough to keep you laughing whenever she delivers a delicious line (see top of review).

There were some aspects of the story that went unanswered, like why Hudson's mother had always lost patience with him, even since he was a small boy.  They touched upon the subject, but nothing got too deep, and that was OK by me, as I was more enamored with Hudson and Sara anyway.  Kevin Pollack, who has been in a few movies with Perry in the past, had a limited role, but this is what he excels at anyway, so it's a good thing.  Mary Steenburgen was hilarious in this film as one of Hudson's doctors, she was only in the movie for about 20 minutes at the most of the 93 minutes, but it was a very memorable performance.

The movie is rated R, and for good reason.  There is a plentitude of the F-bomb being dropped every few seconds it seems, and there is some nudity as well (not from Lynn Collins though, sorry fellas).  So how good is it?  Should you purchase this?  Well, it's pretty cheap, although it's only available on DVD to buy as of now.  I viewed this as part of my Netflix subscription,  and it was definitely worth the fee.  I can easily recommend this film for those of you into the darker side of comedies and romantic films, but for the rest of you - you may not get it.

8256628,4,B0014Z4OM0,"I really appreciated the movie about a subject not many people know about Depersonalization and Derealization.  The people who gave it two stars wanted a comedy.  DP is not funny!  People who have it, want to be RID OF IT.  I know because I have had it for a very long time.

The movie articulates the problem with the depression, anxiety an dpre-occupation with DP.

Mine was a classic case. It began when I was 22 years old after a car accident (mild concussion but scary) and a relationship loss. It happened during my last semester of college. Some advice for people who want to at least function, was that I had to focus and concentrate 3X as much as normal to finish college. I couldn't follow a conversation or study with DP.

As far as this movie goes for representing Depersonalization/Derealization, for me it is the cycle of not continuing with your life, DP and DR being the pre-occupation of your life.  DP takes over.  It also interferes with your relationships, just like in the movie.  I don't think I even told my husband I had DP.  He would not have understood.  I just dealt with it....I never even told my siblings.

It took me awhile to adjust....I was always trying to get well, vitamins, minerals, etc. i was going in a never-ending cycle of psychosomatic symptoms all the time.  Finally I realized I was doing this and the psychosomatic symptoms went away.

The one time I was ""clear"", I felt like I had the 3X the concentration power. It takes a lot of energy to focus with DP.

Everything the character, Hudsom Wilbanks, encounters in the movie described is how DP really is.  The disinterest/depression and anxiety taking over your life.

To describe what it feels like to someone who doesn't have DP, I see everything in one dimension, everything is flat and seems like a veil is between me and reality. I really don't know how I drive but I do. It also came with a three year major depression which I finally got out of. Mostly I feel it is related to anxiety. I try and protect myself as much as I can. I had a disruptive childhood, so that is probably where the propensity comes from.

As in the movie, I have had the same response from physicians....I told one doctor about my symptons and diagnosis, he just kept talking about my eye appointment like I had not said anything to him at all. After all these years, I feel Depersonalization is generated byanxiety in the form of a body-chemical affecting nerve/muscle responses in  the eye muscle and optic nerve. My depth perception reduces to a one dimension, non-intrusive and non-threatening visual experience.

If I had any advice for anybody with Depersonalization it would be to seek help from a mental health professional. Not to be afraid. That is what DP thrives on is fear. You are not going to die from DP. It is your body protecting you. You need to get out and get on with your life, even with DP. Getting on with your life is protecting yourself.",1482364800,,2941,4.553231939163498
