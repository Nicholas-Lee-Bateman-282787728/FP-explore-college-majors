8361705,5,B002BNPMHK,I love this yoga DVD. I use this once a week and it is great for teaching the Asanas. It really aligns the spine.,1382054400,,113,3.75
8361706,2,B002BNPMHK,"I bought this DVD and the Leg and Knee DVD by the same company, and I wish I had not.

First, the navigation on these DVD's is the worst I have ever seen. There is no menu at the beginning, and no index of exercise. You only option is to push play. Then you get a long spiel about how wonderful yoga is, and you only option is to FF through it. There are also some text slides that you have to go through by hitting the right arrow and then enter, several times. If you do this all correctly you will be taken to a two option menu. If you didn't do it correctly, or tried to use the menu, prev, or next buttons, you'll end up having to start the whole process over.  At the two option menu you are given the choice of viewing the asanas, or doing the real-time workout.  There is no instruction during the actual workout, so you will need to view the asanas if you want instructions.

Now, I had expected there to be specific instruction and care given to the body parts mentioned in the titles, but there is not. What you get is a set of asanas, and instructions on how to do them. From having both DVD's, it is clear that they filmed each asana once and just insert that part into each DVD where needed. So, basically, the same asana on each DVD is the same clip. It appears that the idea was to take the stock footage of the individual asanas and put them together in a group that will help strengthen certain body parts. There are instructions on how to do the asanas, which in general is not too bad, but this is an Indian made DVD, filmed in India, using young native Indian people who have probably been doing these asanas for a good many years. There is no consideration given to the fact that many people will not be nearly that flexible, or that the reason they bought the DVD was because the body parts in question may be injured in some way. In other words, you really need to be pretty flexible and uninjured to begin with. No special instructions are given for the body parts listed in the title.  It's all generic.

As for the workout, that is just the poses held for a certain length of time, and when it's done, the next asana is spliced in.  There are no instructions, or talking of any kind. This may be good for some people, but if you have back problems and were hoping for special instructions to help you do the poses you won't find any on these DVD's. I'm sure healthy, flexible people will improve their back strength and flexibility, but even then, the navigation of this would probably drive many people crazy. Oh, and if you want to skip to the next asana, you have to use FF. Trying to use the Next button will take you to the end of the DVD. It's almost as bad as using a VCR.",1281052800,3,2706,4.1923076923076925
8361707,5,B002BNPMHK,"I have a number of yoga dvds designed to stretch the back, relieve back pain etc.  What I like about this one is that it provides a lot of relief from back pain, and the practice is 23 minutes, so it's easy to fit into one's schedule.  I'd describe it as intermediate, as I'm reasonably in shape but could not do all of the postures, or hold the postures as long as the demonstrators, while initially trying this DVD.  I find this video to be well worth the cost, and more effective than similar videos I have tried.",1260230400,6,516,4.244897959183674
