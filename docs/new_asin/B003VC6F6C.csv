4209097,4,B003VC6F6C,I bought this DVD because I was in the show when Rick came to Brazil in 1975. It is good to remember my youth watching this great show.,1352764800,,135,3.857142857142857
4209098,2,B003VC6F6C,"Far from being a ""collectors edition"", this video is a very-low quality live record of a ""Journey"" presentation in Australia many years ago. It's not ""live"" in the sense of a ""studio-quality recording of a live presentation"", but simply a record with a camera positioned ""somewhere"" in the audience. Image has very poor spatial and chromatic resolution. The sound is like the one you get with an old TV camera. No computer enhancement applied - and nothing could be done about that, as the source material is very poor.",1349827200,4,519,4.842696629213483
4209099,5,B003VC6F6C,"ANYONE WHO REMEMBERS ""YES"", AND STILL RESPECTS THE MUSIC OF THE 70'S, SHOULD OWN THIS LIVE PERFORMANCE. IT IS WORTH THE PRICE. SIT BACK AND ENJOY!",1349740800,,146,4.653846153846154
4209100,4,B003VC6F6C,While I love the music I could do without the video because it's not widescreen and is sort of unprofessional but it's not bad for the time in my opinion.,1329350400,3,154,4.166666666666667
4209101,4,B003VC6F6C,"My father has introduced me to Yes, Rick Wakeman, Asia, and so many other bands when I was just about 10. This along with classical music. Probably, getting to know both together was the reason I so much enjoyed progressive rock. Today, with my father gone for a few years, listening to these songs is my best way to close my eyes and remember those moments with him, just closing our eyes and enjoying good music. This album is one of the best for me and this show, after so many years, was a great purchase! The soundtrack seems to me that could've been better, but then, my tv set is a poor one, with limited sound capabilities... Probably, will be terrific to view in full stereo!",1311033600,4,684,4.393700787401575
4209102,5,B003VC6F6C,"I was pleased to find this gem of concert. I witness this tour in Houston,Tx. in 1975,The audio is amazing considering the age of the tape source. DTS surround,nothing like listening to this concert in this mix. Anyone who knows about Mr. Wakemans music should buy this while it is still available. I am sure you too will be very please with this piece of history. Samuel,San Antonio,Tx. GO SPURS",1300752000,9,396,4.671428571428572
8406652,5,B003VC6F6C,Been a fan of this one for years..had to replace my cassettes from years ago and am enjoying it all over again.,1454371200,,111,4.090909090909091

8406654,5,B003VC6F6C,"If you were lucky enough to see one of the just over 20 performances in America, this is it!!!!!
I found myself at The Palace Theater in Waterbury, Ct. Last row in the balcony!",1429228800,,176,4.205882352941177
8406655,4,B003VC6F6C,Good show. Wakeman is totally on his game. Didn't know the show and the players were slightly different than the original vinyl LP version from the 70s. Still a great performance and the sound was good too.,1427673600,,206,4.594594594594595
8406656,1,B003VC6F6C,"Pass this one by. I agree with another reviewer that the video and audio of this recording is very poor quality. It looks like it was shot using a VHS camcorder. It's that bad.

Buy the original live album instead. It is awesome.",1420329600,,229,4.325581395348837
8406657,5,B003VC6F6C,Only shoebox but it is very old video. The sound quality is brilliant. Definitely recommend for Rick Wakeman or Yes fans,1404000000,,120,4.761904761904762
8406658,4,B003VC6F6C,This is a totally awesome show.  Brought back memories from seeing it live in 1975.  Really enjoyed the extras songs and interviews.,1397520000,,132,4.954545454545454
8406659,4,B003VC6F6C,Mixed feelings about the quality of this DVD but it is the only (that I can find) version of Journey...,1367539200,3,103,4.2
8406660,5,B003VC6F6C,"Definitivamente ha sido una de las mejores compras que he hecho, si bien es cierto que la calidad del video no es muy buena, obviamente por el tiempo, lo mismo no puedo decir sobre el audio que es expectacular y mas aun cuando escuchar y ver el concierto me hace ir a un bosque lleno de tranquilidad, recomendado al 100%",1354320000,,320,4.35
8406661,4,B003VC6F6C,obrigado muito bom minha tia trouse para mim aqui em sampa e eu estou a usar sem nenhum problema o prazo foi bom,1353283200,,112,3.9130434782608696
