438834,3,6302224322,"Ditto to the reviewers who gave this film high marks for the great footage of the vintage RAF Mosquito fighter-bombers.  The Mosquito was an exceptional aircraft, and 633 Squadron deserves praise for showcasing it.
As for the rest of the film, the story line staggers and doesn't fully develop.  The end of the film does provide an exciting bombing run that results in the destruction of a Nazi fuel factory in a Norwegian fjord.  But it then ends abruptly while there's still some story to tell.
The music fits in really well with the flying scenes.  All in all, a fun World War II movie, but it doesn't rank as high when compared to others.",985478400,,642,4.556521739130435
438835,5,6302224322,"Ref. the tech. of the 60's, this is a fine film. Great acting, and better yet..fine aircraft sounds and film. Simply a film to put in an airmans file..If one likes true flight and history.",984614400,,188,4.4
438836,4,6302224322,"World War II adventure film about a Royal Air Force fighter-bomber squadron assigned to destroy a Nazi rocket fuel facility in Norway. Cliff Robertson headlines the movie as a former Eagle Squadron pilot in command of 633 Squadron with a colorful assembly of international pilots. They embark on the hazardous assignment with the target located inside a Norwegian fjord, guarded by an immense array of anti-aircraft artillery. Worth noting is the story was probably inspired by the real-life exploits of RAF Mosquito squadrons that conducted such dangerous missions, hunting down Nazi ship convoys along Norway's rugged coastline.

The real attraction of this film is abundant footage of authentic World War II-era De Havilland Mosquito bombers used for the movie production. The scenes of these rare aircraft in flight are a delight, especially since there the are no airworthy examples left in the entire world today (the last one was lost with its crew in a tragic crash in 1996). The model airplane special effects are too obvious, especially when compared to the quality of ""The Bridges of Toko Ri"" starring William Holden. Nonetheless, it's still pretty exciting and viewers can't help but compare the squadron's climatic attack in the treacherous fjord with ""Star War's"" Jedi attack on the Empire's Death Star.

The script and several scenes could have been better, but the authentic aircraft are worth watching. Overall a decent adventure, dated, but enjoyable if you're a fan of the famous De Havilland Mosquito fighter-bomber built of wood, and flown by pilots in daring missions that helped win World War II.

For those interested, there's a nice De Havilland aircraft museum north of London, England, on the actual grounds where these impressive aircraft were built. The original prototype Mosquito airplane, and another production model used in the later movie ""Mosquito,"" are on display.",978825600,103,1901,5.267326732673268
438837,4,6302224322,"Several reviewers are right-on-target here about the virtue of this film is its use of actual Mosquito bombers. The point is that by sacrificing weight by going to all wood, the mosquito could fly very fast like a fighter (self-defense against enemy fighters) yet BOMB targets. Its was the world's first fighter-bomber by design. The rarity of flying footage is that the aircraft was DISPOSABLE by design and the glue that held these planes together has fallen apart over the years leaving us only one plane left in flying condition!
What I derive is that today we could today build in war-winning large quantities (can't do this with expensive F/A-18s, Harriers) an inexpensive disposible ""Mosquito"" attack plane using composites like Burt Rutan's ARES ""mudfighter"" and have it as either manned or unmanned to perform attack missions flying from dirt strips or grassy fields like the 633 Squadron does for better response to our ground troops.
We should re-edit this movie with 21st century Mosquito model effects and see if it stands up to its copy-cat Star Wars ""death star"" fighter-bomber sequence?",971395200,11,1102,5.093922651933702
438838,4,6302224322,"Is it just me, or is their a striking similarity between the concept in this movie and the ""death star attack in Star Wars""?  Fly down a  narrow,heavily guarded passage to a target you can't bomb directly and  hurt!",967420800,4,215,4.461538461538462
438839,4,6302224322,"Somewhat loosely adapted from the first of a series of novels by Frederick Smith, this is the story of a fictitious Mosquito squadron's mission to bomb a ""rocket fuel factory"" (no, not an atomic bomb plant or  heavy-water refinery) located at the end of the portentiously-named  ""Black Fjord"". And yes, indeed, George Lucas must cringe whenever  anyone sees this movie, because it is SO VERY OBVIOUSLY the source of  practically every shot from the now-famous ""Death Star Assault""  sequence at the end of the original ""Star Wars"", albeit with  unfortunately very unconvincing AA fire effects. The characters are the  most amazing assembly of stock types one could ask for (the reckless, the  Aussie, the Sikh, the French, the Cockney, the Yank (hopelessly mis-written  for the American audience), the world's only black-haired Norwegian and his  knock-out ash-blond sister - you get the picture.....) but who the heck  cares? All you want to see in this is the one and only chance to catch  three Mosquitos starting their engines, taxiing, and flying. Flying through  canyons, buzzing the field, zipping through clouds - that's the reason to  watch this film. NO, it isn't based on any single ""real life  story"", but it takes the spirit of the ""Dambusters"" (which  is a far superior film) and transplants it to a vastly more impressive  aircraft. The score grated on MY nerves after a while - it's main theme is  abused in repetition - but I guess some folks go for that. (I much  preferred Goldsmith's score for ""The Blue Max"", but you can't  have everything.) Action on the ground IS soapy, almost becoming  self-consciously so. But again - that's just something to pass the time  between all those great shots of Mossies doing their thing. If you're the  kind of person who has to run outside when you hear multiple piston engines  roaring overhead, you really will love this movie. If airplanes make you  change the channel - take a pass.",933120000,15,1942,4.883435582822086
438840,4,6302224322,"It's already been said in other reviews posted here, but I just cannot overlook adding to it... Cliff Robertson plays WING CDR. ROY GRANT, the American commander of an RAF light bomber squadron who are given one  extremely urgent mission: destroy a Nazi factory helping develop a weapon  (an A-bomb?) that may threaten the pending Allied invasion of Europe.  Working closely with the squadron is George Chakiris as LIEUT. ERIK  BERGMAN, a leader of the Norweigan Linge. Those aerial sequences involving  the actual Mosquito aircraft are a sight to behold and the special effects  model use are adequate as well (remember this is 1964 vs. 1999). The Ron  Goodwin score is a catchy one and keeps you glued as the climatic bombing  mission unfolds. (This is probably where George Lucas got the idea for the  Death Star finale in STAR WARS). Overall, I say this film is a must for  those who love other mid-60's WW2 films like VON RYAN'S EXPRESS, THE BATTLE  OF BRITAIN, THE BRIDGE AT REMAGAN.",924048000,15,989,4.792899408284024

439038,5,6302224322,"First of all, this is about as good a transfer from the original film as you're ever going to see.  It's even wide-screen (2.35:1 Cinemascope).  I cannot fault the production of the DVD.  In fact, it has a hidden virtue:  You load the disc and it goes STRAIGHT INTO THE MOVIE.  You don't have to sit through six unrelated trailers, three separate FBI warnings, four MPAA rating screens, two Presidential campaign messages and a partridge in a pear tree first.  If only all movies on DVD and Blu-Ray were so uncluttered!

That said ... well, keep in mind the age of the movie.  The soundtrack is mono, and I'm afraid the special effects don't *quite* live up to my young memories of seeing it in a first-run theater.  Don't get me wrong, it's very well done for the time, but don't expect 21st century production values out of it.

But you know what makes up for that?  Rolls-Royce Merlins.  And Mosquitoes.  With Merlins.  Real live flying Mosquitoes.  And more Merlins.  And did I mention Merlins?  And don't miss the Merlins.

439153,3,6302224322,"633 Squadron, 1964 film

This is a story about the strategic bombing operation in WW II. There is one plant in Norway that manufactures the fuel for Nazi rocket launchers that will be aimed at England before the invasion of France. If it is destroyed the rocket launchers will be useless. The 633 Squadron is composed of Moquitoes, a fast and light bomber with two liquid-cooled engines. It is mostly built out of wood to minimized the need for scarce metals. This has the usual drama of personal conflicts (needed to add interest in most movies). The Norwegian resistance will play a part in the attack. They reported an increase of German troops and anti-aircraft guns. The Mosquitoes practice bombing the side of a mountain; this will create a landslide that will bury the fuel factory in Norway. We see a surprise attack on the airfield by enemy fighters. [No radar warning?]

The airmen talk in a public house. A young woman enters and attracts attention; she is the sister of one of the crew. [No accents?] Practice bombing continues. Inattention to details results in one fatal accident. The Norwegian will return to gather more men for the operation. Is the leader of the operation too valuable to risk? Tin cans are tied to the rear of one automobile in celebration of a wedding. [Do they still do that today?] That Norwegian officer parachutes into Norway. Enemy troops search the area. A truck carries armed men past a checkpoint, they are pursued by the enemy. One man is captured! Back in England an airman explains why he joined the Eagle Squadron [Americans who volunteered to fly for Britain]. The capture could imperil the operation! Should one man be sacrificed in order to ave the operation? This is one of the trade-offs that occur not just in war. [A cutback in personnel to save the business? This is usually due to error in management.]

Eric Bergman is again questioned but has nothing to say. Can he be ""persuaded"" to talk? Will that lone bomber accomplish its mission? It returns, damaged. They use the emergency exit to rescue the pilot. Was the mission accomplished? The operation will be moved up just in case. Eric's sister accepts the decision. The special bombs are delivered. The flight plan is reviewed. The Norwegian underground will attack the anti-aircraft batteries before the bombers arrive. What if something goes wrong? There is no radio message from the Norwegian resistance! What will the flight commander do? Is their low-level flight under the radar? They drop their bombs and report the results. Will it be a success? [A happy ending is needed for commercial success.]

You can compare this 1964 movie to the ones made during the war for their outlook (which should match the audiences' expectations.)",1372377600,,2747,4.863247863247863
439184,4,6302224322,"This is a honest war film and I am glad that I bought and watched it - but sadly, most of this film is greatly inferior to the still impressive final combat. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

This film describes the exploits during World War II of a fictional RAF squadron, flying De Havilland Mosquito fighter-bombers, planes famous for their great speed, powerful armament and last but not least - their beauty. In fact the Mosquito is as much the hero of this film as any of the characters.

7781 Mosquitos were built during WWII in UK, Canada and Australia. Used operationally since spring 1942 as fast reconnaissance planes, night fighters, precision attack light bombers, ground attack fighter-bombers and target marking ""Pathfinders"" Mosquitos served allies well and were greatly respected and feared by Germans. III Reich tried quickly to copy this excellent plane, but it turned out it was not so easy to do and as the result the German equivalent Focke-Wulf Ta-154 Moskito, which became operational in 1944, was a disappointment - frtom the 50 build most were affected to training, with only a handful being used as night fighters, with negligible results.

This film is to a certain extent inspired by some real events. Because of their speed, agility, long range and capacity to carry a quite serious bomb load (some could carry a 1800 kg ""Cookie"" bomb!), the Mosquitos were particularly suitable for precision bombing of small, but important targets, which were frequently hard to reach and defended by strong Flak. They proved it during one of their first bombing operations, on 25 September 1942, when four Mosquitos from RAF 105 Squadron took off from Scotland and attacked Gestapo HQ in Oslo. Even if this attack was only a partial success and caused serious collateral damage, more raids of this kind were launched later against targets in Netherlands, France and Denmark.

Another inspiration for this film was the successful attack led by RAF in 1944 against German super-battleship ""Tirpitz"", anchored at the bottom of one of Norwegian fjords and protected by powerful anti-aircraft defence - even if in this case the real raid was made by Avro Lancaster heavy bombers.

In this film we can see the Mosquitos a lot and it is a good thing. Sadly, the scenario is not half as good as this famous plane was - which is frankly amazing, considering that it was co-written by James Clavell in person! I found large fragments of this film rather boring and many dialogs were really not that great.

As for actors, even if Cliff Robertson did finally a rather honest job, George Chakiris didn't - and anyway his character was really lame (and also who had the genius idea to ask a Greek to play a Norwegian?). Maria Perschy, although undeniably cute, didn't shine a lot in this film either. And the whole romantic angle in this film seemed really artificial. On another hand secondary characters were much better played - Harry Andrews and Angus Lennie did particularly well and I also certainly liked Julian Sherrier as Flight Lieutenant Singh (pity that this character was not shown more).

That being said, this film still has a lot to offer. The music is beautiful and impressive. Mosquitos are shown a lot. The final 15 minutes are EXCELLENT and still impress a lot, even today. And last but not least, there is the fact that the final fight in this film inspired George Lucas to copy it almost scene by scene for the attack of rebel fighters against Death Star in Star Wars! And for a pathological Star Wars fan like me (yes, I am a nerdy fanboy and I am PROUD of it), that means a LOT!

So bottom line, I rate this film four stars and I recommend it to all those who didn't see it yet. And I will keep my copy preciously for a future re-viewing. Enjoy!",1372291200,,3798,4.7526555386949925

439248,5,6302224322,"633 SQUADRON is quite British and a very entertaining World War II action adventure film that focuses both on the RAF pilots and their primary mission to obliterate a German rocket fuel plant located in occupied Norway.  Starring Cliff Robertson as Wing Commander Roy Grant he leads an excellent cast that includes Harry Andrews as Air Vice Marshal Davis, Michael Goodliffe as Squadron Leader Frank Adams and George Chakiris as Lt. Erik Bergman. Directed by Walter Grauman, this film features brilliant color cinematography by veteran Edward Scaife (KHARTOUM, THE DIRTY DOZEN, DARK OF THE SUN), another outstanding WWII score composed by Ron Goodwin (WHERE EAGLES DARE) and impressive special effects from Tom Howard (WHERE EAGLES DARE). Cliff Robertson is a skillful, steadfast and always interesting actor who once again turns in an introspective performance underplaying a role that still commands the focal point of the viewer. It was good to see George Chakiris in another role aside from WESTSIDE STORY, but his screen time and overall part seem a bit lacking in 633 SQUADRON. There is a lot of daring do and typical heroics in this film, but the integration of actual air footage by editor Bert Bates really make this film noteworthy. The air scenes in the narrow Norwegian fjord of the squadron under incredible anti-aircraft fire from the Nazi guns is truly exciting. Most effective for me was Ron Goodwin's uplifting and energetic score and main title he composed and used throughout.

Because of its location in the deep gorge of a fjord, conventional bombing cannot touch it.  So, Mosquitoes are assigned to make a daring low-level attack designed to take it out...that's the set-up.

There is a lot of very nice footage of flying DeHavilland Mosquito aircraft in this film, and that will please WWII military history buffs.  Of course, the special effects are sadly lacking when compared to today's CGI capabilities, but you can't really hold that against the original film makers.

When they were able to deliver the bombs, they always hit the same location.  They saved money by using the same sequence.  Some would criticize the overuse of today's computer special effects, but it would have helped this movie a lot.  Unfortunately, it wouldn't help the storyline and the acting was half-hearted.

439391,4,6302224322,"633 Squadron is not a well-known or highly-touted WWII movie, but it is an above average, exciting look at an RAF fighter-bomber squadron.  In the early months of 1944, a section of the RAF Eagle Squadron, the 633 Squadron, is given a dangerous mission that could have a profound impact on the upcoming D-Day.  The 633 must fly through a narrow fjord of Norway and blow up a German factory producing rocket fuel.  The factory is built deep under a cliff, think Guns of Navarone, and is impossible to attack in any other way.  With the help of the Norwegian underground who will try to knock out the German anti-aircraft, the 633 begins their training for this possibly suicidal mission.  This movie is not groundbreaking, but it does everything well.  The training sequences in Scotland are exciting, the camraderie among the pilots doesn't seem forced, and the final attack in the fjord is very well done.  I give credit to this movie for how it handles the attack, it's not necessarily a happy ending, not all the pilots make it, but it shows the realistic results of what an attack like this would be.  So for a moving, realistic and still exciting WWII movie with some great aerial footage of the Mosquito fighter-bomber, give 633 Squadron a try.

  Cliff Robertson takes the lead here as Wing Commander Roy Grant, the leader of 633 Squadron.  Grant accepts the risk involved with the mission and its possible impact, but also knows it may cost a lot to get it done.  Robertson is very strong as Grant, a really good role for him.  George Chakiris gives support as Lt. Erik Bergman, the leader of the Norwegian underground who initially trains with the 633 before being dropped back into Norway to prepare his men.  It's not a huge part, but Chakiris pulls it off well.  Maria Perschy plays Hilde Bergman, Erik's sister who begins to fall for Robertson's Grant as they get to know each other.  Harry Andrews, Donald Houston, and Michale Goodliffe are good in supporting roles as Grant's RAF superiors.  The squadron consists of John Meillon as Gillibrand, the Australian pilot who loves women and drinking, John Bonney as Scott, the one-handed cocky but likable second-in-command, and Angus Lennie as Hoppie, Grant's nervous navigator, among several others who aren't given much to do.

  The DVD offers a great-looking widescreen presentation, a real beauty, and a theatrical trailer for the movie.  Not much in the way of special features, but the movie is worth the price.

People facing very great danger generally act differently than people out for a Sunday stroll, but in this film the protagonists really seem to lack the emotion of honest fear.  This unreal emotional tenor was pretty consistent throughout the film.

Cliff Robertson, as usual, puts in a good performance, and the plot is serviceable--the Nazis are planning to bombard England and possibly the D-Day landings with V2 rockets, so 633 Squadron must bomb the rocket fuel factory in Norway.  The mission is not unrealistic, and the film seems to be technically pretty accurate.  Once again though, the characters all just seem to be indifferent to the fact that they are on something approaching a suicide mission.

The film moves along at a reasonable pace, holding the viewer's interest.  However, the ending is a total letdown (no spoiler here) and could have been much better.

weeks on end towards the end of the war...they flew so

fast and high they had very light casualties and prevented

the Berliners from getting any sleep, sometimes carrying out

( By the way, anyone unconvinced that George Lucas in fact got the idea for the Death Star scene fom this fine film might like to know the following: When Lucas originally devised Star Wars and was showing a rough cut print to the movie studio bigwigs, he hadn't had enough budget left for the SFX to show them the Death star finale. So instead, he intercut aerial dogfight footage from British WW2 movies including the Dambusters, the Battle Of Britain, and .....633 Squadron.  Case closed!!",1127088000,22,754,4.5036496350364965

The final assault on the target was less than gripping, and I highly doubt that it was the inspiration for the climactic scene of Star Wars.  Worst of all was the use of models in some close up scenes.  A little more effort could have been put into it, especially when it came to blowing them up.  In the end, the character development wasn't all that great, nor was the acting.

While George Lucas has acknowledged Kurasawa's ""Hidden Fortress"" as a primary influence on ""Star Wars,"" I wonder if he had ""633 Squadron"" in the back of his mind when designing the end run on the Death Star? Something to ponder.

The other reviewers have said some wonderful things about the excellent and authentic aerial combat footage, and the footage of the Mosquito fighters themselves, so I will only add my praise to theirs.

The only quibbles I have with the movie are the very fake miniature plane models used in the climactic bombing run, Cliff Robertson's lack of a British accent (he is playing an RAF captain...the only flaw in an otherwise marvelous performance),  and the trite, standard romance that always seems a part of most war movies.

439398,3,6302224322,"Okay, I admit it - I excuse all the obvious failings of this forty-year-old film already noted by other reviewers because of the airplanes.  DeHavilland's experience building high-performance airplanes from the original naturally-occurring composite material (wood) conserved strategic materials and produced the fastest airplane in the world for at least two years running during World War II.  One of the few successful airplanes designed after the beginning of the war to be produced in quantity (over 7700 in dozens of versions in six factories on three continents), the Mossie is truly the star of this film.  We may not think much of most of the scenes on the ground, but losses were a grim reality.  The determination of the crews to defend their homeland and fight to liberate others while coping with their own fear and mortality shows us the best qualities of that great generation.  Even if some of the acting was as wooden as the airplanes.
My biggest complaint about the show was the actual destruction of two or three precious Mossies (Robertson's two prangs and another plowing into a fuel bowser).  I second the craving for better sound - for those of you who can't get enough of the sound of a Merlin or two singing that most beautiful and alluring of mechanical siren songs, visit [...] and go to ""Donated Files.""

439429,4,6302224322,"Loved this film when I first saw it as a 9-yo ww2 airplane-crazy  kid at a neigbors house, none of the limited special-effects taint it then, anymore than they did 'The Battle of Britain'. This movie is based on a book of the same name, I've never read the book, cant name the author, but the mission itself is an imaginary-one, but does reflect bits and pieces of actual Mosquito-bomber exploits in ww2: the mid-film raid on the Oslo Gestapo building to kill their own captured Norwegian-resistance friend before he can give it up under torture was resembling a job Mosquitos did in both Oslo and Copenhagen Denmark-tragically also hitting a school and killing many Danish school-children in that otherwise successful raid. One other famous Mosquito exploit was the aptly-named 'Jericho' raid on Amiens medieval prison in the French countryside, to blow -down the walls and release French resistance fighters held by the Nazis. This raid is imitated in the later film 'Mosquito Squadron', with David McCallum, which is a perhaps inferior film to this one, and re-uses some of 633's canned Mosquito flying footage.
The film is a fair-classic of the genre and like the even more atmospheric and heady (and true-fact) 'Dambusters', has a memorable and rousing score, this one by Ron Goodwin, who wrote many scores for war-films-this would be the best one, and is worth checking-out on your legal pay music download site, frankly(winks)
The comments by people here concerning the special-effects are true,as Ive attacked to some degree the special-effects of 'the Battle of Britain', 633 has more excuse, would have been far less ambitious lower budget. But the twin-merlin Mosquitos are as gloriously acoustically and visually British as Dambusters Lancs  and 'Battle of Brits' Spits and Hurricanes.
And '12 Oclock High's Fortresses, one might add.
George Shakira's casting as a Norwegian Resistance fighter(or any Norwegian!)goes down as one of the casting oddities of celluloid history.
If you haven't seen it before, youll like it, if you love good airplanes, airplane footage and sounds, it'll probably actually get you high.
The remarks I saw here about the rationale of the Mosquitos wooden construction being about shortage of aluminium, well, cant rule it out totally,without loking into it first,  but would point out that the specially glued plywood skin  obviated the need for 100s of flush-rivets as metal-skin planes have, resulting in drag,and loss of speed,  and this aircraft was conceived to be fast enough to evade enemy fighters by speed alone, without the need for defensive or offensive guns, which the  bomber and recon glass-nosed Mosquitos actually were unarmed, and Luftwaffe found it almost impossible at first and always difficult to intercept them, even when they could see them comiing. Despite being wooden, they were also regarded as a remarkably sturdy aircraft that frequently returned with major battle damage. The Mosquito was also one of the few twin-engined planes which was claimed could not merely  fly on one engine, but even climb comfortably with one engine stopped and 'feathered'.",1073952000,10,3122,5.182539682539683
439430,3,6302224322,"The last time I watched this movie, it suddenly occurred to me that its climax can be best explained in Freudian terms. Perhaps the power of these underlying sexual connotations, along with the unforgettable music, is the reason why this part of the movie -- despite its Airfix special effects -- is so impressive.
The lead-up -- the usual subplots about love in wartime and angst over the possibility of making the ultimate sacrifice-- is mediocre to say the least, but once the squadron skims off across the North Sea to destroy Hitler's heavy water producing plant in Norway, you can't help getting swept along.
Those familiar with the basic concepts of Freudianism will observe that to get to the target they have to fly up a fjiord -- a deep, wet inlet with obvious feminine connotations -- and, once they get there, they have to franticly 'fumble around,' bombing a mountain until they hit the equivalent of a seismic G-spot. When this is done the 'earth' truly moves as an avalanche of rock thunders down on the Nazis. The only thing to do for the few survivors is return to base and have that post-coital cigarette!",1070928000,4,1123,4.7055837563451774
439431,5,6302224322,"I was always under the impression that since many of the pre-war airframes had been built by furniture manufacturers; and that from the very beginning of aircraft specialist joinery firms had been involved. It seemed logical to use the capacity of the furniture and piano manufacturing industry to fabricate an aircraft from plywood.
This aircraft also used the renowned Merlin engine designed by Henry Royce as PV-12; and was a very fast, lightly-armed fighter-bomber which later became an aerial reconnaissance and pathfinder aircraft to guide in heavy bombers to target...""It was said that the 2 man twin engined Mosquito could carry the same bomb load to Berlin as the 4 engined Flying Fortress with its crew of 11. It also did it quicker and used less fuel... the Mosquitoes in the film were photo-reconnaissance models built late in the war. I suppose it would have been quite unique to have an American commanding an RAF Squadron too; especially as those Americans who did fly with the RAF as volunteers came through Canada as the USA was officially 'neutral' until Hitler declared war on the US on 11th December, 1941.",1067472000,3,1126,4.962962962962963

This film must have been kept on permanent stand-by by the BBC.  I consequently saw this for the first time when I was quite young, probably eight or nine years old.  I can remember being just blown away by the flying scenes and it's probably because of this movie that the Mosquito is one of my favourite WWII aeroplanes.  The plot is predictable and it takes a while to get going but hey your can always fast forward to the real star of the film the ubiquitous 'Wooden Wonder'.  Some of the other reviewers have got a point about the parallels with the Star Wars death star, I just can't imagine George Lucas having ever seen this though???",1067126400,2,758,4.385714285714286
439433,4,6302224322,"My comment is more of a rebuttal about the wood construction of those wonderful fighter bombers. It has always been my understanding that wood construction was forced upon the manufacturer's because the United States would not sell aluminum to Great Britain at this time, and thus the use of wood was forced upon them.
The movie itself is terrific. I sometimes put a loudspeaker outsdie my house and it sounds like the Mosquitoes are coming right over the house when I blast the neighborhood with the sounds of the planes coming over the landing strip at the start of the movie!!",1065225600,3,579,4.742574257425742
439434,4,6302224322,"This film seems to have attracted a number of interesting, positive reviews--there is little for me to add except to say that is is a fine World War II thriller, featuring Cliff Robertson, George Chakiris and a solid British cast in support.

Of course, the real ""stars"" of the movie are the Mosquitos--seeing them fly is a feast for aviation fans. Some scenes really seem to put you in the cockpit with our heroes as they train for their ""mission impossible"". There is also a fair bit of model work involved, and this is perhaps the only area of the movie that is dated. Special effects have made huge strides since the sixties--when these planes crash or blow up, it is not done in a convincing way for modern audiences.

Cliff Robertson is fine in the lead--later in the decade, he was to win an Oscar for ""Charly"", yet he has always been under-rated. His career certainly had it's ""ups and downs""--in the seventies, he blew the whistle on a Hollywood executive who was embezzling money, and good movie roles seemed to ""elude"" him for a while. Clearly, he is a man of great integrity. It was nice to see him, after so many years, have an important role in the monster hit, ""Spiderman"".

George Chakiris aquits himself well as a Norwegian resistance leader. British character actors, Harry Andrews and Donald Houston, provide the mandatory ""stiff upper lips"" ! When the movie is over though, it is those fabulous planes that you remember most.

The DVD is widescreen, with decent colour for its age--the sound is mono ( imagine those Mosquitos in surround ? ! ). The packaging is very rudimentary, but I suppose this is in keeping with the low price ?

If you like war films with the accent on aviation, this one is for you. Try it !

Footnote dated 16 July, 2011--well--the price was ""low"" when I bought it !

A very sad footnote, dated 10 September 2011--Mr. Cliff Robertson has passed away at the grand age of 88--another fine actor has left us.",1062979200,32,1950,4.586206896551724

439436,5,6302224322,"I was 9 years old when I first saw 633 Squadron. I think I must have watched it 20 or more times. My greatest joy was when I have had the priviledge of working with its director, Walter Grauman. To this day, he is still an active Producer/Director. I feel that 633 Squadron came off so well, because Walter was a highly decorated B-24 pilot in World War 11,flying over 24 missions, and bringing back his aircraft once, with one engine fully ablaze, with nazi planes following and firing at him. If you're going to choose a director to shoot a WW11 bombing raid, you couldn't pick a better qualified man. I believe you can feel his emotions throughout the film. He's stated that he received unbelievable cooperation from everyone involved with the film, including veteran pilots, townsfolk,etc. They went out of their way to make this exciting project work, and one can feel the sincerity, the pride and the glory of the Brits who fought the evil that threatened the world.",1054598400,7,972,4.656976744186046
439437,3,6302224322,"Well I am an American, but I love the British planes and movies. This cast I think is mostly British and do a splendid job of acting. A group of international pilots in the RAF band together to bomb a factory that the silly Germans stuck under a large rock overhang just aching to be avalanched. Even though that would not have happened they at least have plenty of Anti-Aircraft guns and thats factual. Perhaps a slightly exaggerated story premise, but very entertaining and it certainly gives an idea of the heroism of the RAF pilots during WWII. Anyway this is a fine film especially for anyone that enjoys movies like ""The Battle of Britain"" or ""Memphis Belle"". As pointed out one benefit is the opportunity to see the magnificent ""Mosquito"" planes and the beautiful scenery they fly over. Did I mention that the sound of a Merlin engine not only arouses WWII pilots. With the great musical theme of the movie and the acting of cliff Robertson you have a winner. Good point about the models used in the bombing sequences. After all we are talking 40 year old F/X. Star Wars is almost 30 years old and we can certainly see how those special effects are now dated. George Lucas even went back and changed the Death Star explosion to improve it for the re-release. It might be nice to see an updated version of the models in this movie but then we couldn't poke a little fun at them and our age since most of us saw this as kids. Great movie and I have pre-ordered my DVD copy. For you fans of WWII movies, ""Sink the Bismack"" will also be out on DVD this month. Another great Brit movie.",1052352000,14,1588,4.42320819112628
439438,5,6302224322,"While this film succeeds as a classic high adventure war movie, the use of actual Mosquitoes was indeed the real attraction.
At the time of filming, there were only three airworthy planes (as you can tell when they buzz the airfield) and the planes used were the BIV bomber versions, with painted over plexiglass noses, to make them look like fighter-bombers. The FB version had a door in the side of the plane, whereas you climbed up into the bomber version.
Technical accuracy? Who cares? It's just a pleasure to see ANY Mosquito flying for real, and the sound of those Merlins, especially where they buzz the tower and when they are practicing along the valley in Scotland, is a joy to the ears.
Ten stars wouldn't be enough to praise this movie. An absolute classic by any standards. Nice also to see the mighty Cliff Robertson as the Squadron Leader, with his Eagle Squadron shoulder flashes proudly displayed.
Utterly superb.",1026172800,11,931,4.788819875776397

7822635,5,6302224322,"This is perhaps my favorite WWII aircraft movie.  It's exciting, and it's one of the few WWII movies that sticks fairly close to the original source -- Fredrick Smith's book of the same title.

The cast is great.  It was especially interesting to see John Meillon (Wally, from ""Crocadile Dundee"") in a somewhat different role.  Even allowing for some ""fudging"" on genetics, George Chikaris (a Norweigen with dark hair) and Marie Perschy (his sister with blonde hair) hold up their end rather well.  The other pilots in the squadron, even those with fairly minor roles, keep their characters real.  And of course Cliff Robertson, as W/Cdr Roy Grant, is more than capable of carrying the show from start to finish.

But even though I've always been a big Cliff Robertson fan, the real stars of this film are the Mossies themselves.  Even knowing that most of the actual combat scenes were filmed with models, it's amazing to think the Mosquito was probably the best all around combat aircraft built in the Second World War.
