4114501,5,B003ES5JOC,"I have been waiting to complete this colletion since the first season came out. As a boy this show was one of my favorites. No library should or will be complete without this set in it. Get it, this is what early Television was all about. Great guest stars. Very good stories. I think what is interesting is that when a person left the show they filled in another person to take their place. The viewer was never left hanging the the story was always completed. Where else would you find a show who has such leading men as Lee J Cobb. Charles Bickford, to John Mcintire. The list goes on because I haven't space to name them all. I don't think anything more needs to be  said. If you like classics this series is a must for everyones libary.",1373932800,3,741,4.292857142857143

4114506,4,B003ES5JOC,"Although GUNSMOKE and BONANZA had a few years to go,watching this last season of THE VIRGINIAN is like witnessing the end of an era. There are still some great episodes and the young TIM MATHESON fits well giving the show a new spirit. It's sad to see THE VIRGINIAN and TRAMPAS ,who by now have become like old friends to us. In an episode,TRAMPAS wears a mustache and THE VIRGINIAN throughout the season has sideburns. It's true that by 1969-1970,the networks had really decided that westerns were old hat. In one episode,THE VIRGINIAN goes blind and has to follow his instincts to get by. HOLLYWOOD legend JOAN CRAWFORD is featured in the episode called NIGHTMARE with an actor who looks like ELVIS.Your instincts now tell you to buy this season 8 of THE VIRGINIAN.",1440288000,,767,4.731343283582089

4114519,3,B003ES5JOC,"There are still some good episodes here but clearly the tank was starting to run out of gas on the Virginian. For one thing  James Drury wears a terrible toupee, looks bored about half the time, and often wears a slight scowl on his face. During the prime years he showed a much wider range of emotions. Even on the ""A Love to Remember"" episode with Diane Baker, he turns in a flat, non-engaging performance and hardly looks like a man in love.
The writing?  Hit and miss.  To be fair, there are some memorable installments but quite a few episodes are rather boring and seem like pale recycles.  At this point the loss of original producer Frank Price was very noticeable.
It's easy to see why the final year of this long running series rarely turns up in syndication.
It's also easy to understand why the ratings slipped and the once proud and extraordinary Virginian got cancelled.",1404432000,,884,4.575949367088608

4114535,5,B003ES5JOC,"If you are a western movie fan from years ago, you would love the entire series.  James Drury was a great actor.  I met him last year when we hired him to speak at one of our car club meetings.  He is still a great guy and lives near us in Houston, Texas.  I have all the Virginian DVD's.  Have not watched them because they had been showing on Directv until recently.  If you like the older movies without all the cussing and sex, this series would be a great purchase and he sure isn't bad to look at either.",1392249600,,510,4.05
4114536,5,B003ES5JOC,I enjoy this particular season because of John McIntire and Jeanette Nolan.  They were always two of my favorites actors.  I found most of the episodes very entertaining and of superb quality.,1392076800,,192,4.96875

4114538,5,B003ES5JOC,The Virginian Season 8 arrived quickly in good condition.  We started watching it two days ago and are enjoying a good clean cut family western where Good outshines the Bad and Justice Prevails.,1390003200,,194,4.878787878787879
4114539,5,B003ES5JOC,Again the delivery was very quick. I love the series and the quality of the DVDs has not disappointed me. I wish they hd interviewed some of the cast members as was done in season seven of Wagon Train. I enjoy hearing the personal memories by the cast.,1388620800,,252,4.270833333333333
4114540,5,B003ES5JOC,"I am a big Fan and enjoyed Season 8..I would have liked to see a wrap-up since this was the last Season... Like the other 7, very enjoyable..",1387756800,,141,4.071428571428571
4114541,3,B003ES5JOC,"This season still has many well-written episodes. In my opinion, the two best are ""The Power Seekers"" and ""Rich Man, Poor Man"". ""Power Seekers"" deals well with the issue of back-room politics, and ""Rich Man, Poor Man"" does an excellent job in portraying what happens when people who suddenly become rich have all the wrong ideas on how to handle their wealth.

The big problem with the season as a whole is that it's emblematic of the pressures the networks were under in the years just after the MLK and RFK assassinations, and how these pressures really hurt Westerns in particular. These pressures showed most of all in the 1969-1970 season, and they also hurt ""Bonanza"", ""High Chaparral"", ""Daniel Boone"", and ""Lancer"", and probably hastened those shows' cancellations. Only ""Gunsmoke"", thanks to executive producer John Mantley, resisted the pressure as best it could.

Yes, I am talking about the ""violence"". Please note that the two episodes I singled out as the best did not have anyone killed. But you really can't carry an adult drama/adventure series, and especially a Western, for a full season without some sense that life-and-death matters may be involved, and without some expectation that some guest characters may not survive. Also, let's be honest: in fiction, you need a sense of justice, and frequently (unlike in real life) this sense of justice is fulfilled with the DEATH of the villain, not just his imprisonment or sticking his hands up. I remember, for instance, being very disappointed in the episode ""Black Jade"" for not killing off Shatner at the end. I agree that it's too predictable and trite when every episode of a series ends with bad guys being shot, but something just as much is lost when NO episode does.

Writers during this season were under a lot of pressure from the networks, who in turn were under pressure from Congress, most notably Senator John Pastore of Rhode Island, who was constantly threatening them that if they didn't act to turn all TV drama into something more resembling ""Lassie"" or ""Adam-12"", Congress would. Things got a little more balanced after 1970.

So, many good episodes this season, but overall hindered too much by the pressures on the writers.",1384473600,13,2213,4.940860215053763
4114542,5,B003ES5JOC,"The best western series from the '60's!  I grew up with this kind of TV- wish we had the same quality to enjoy today.  The stories and acting are some of the best ever presented.  James Drury truly became the Virginian in every way and the support cast and co-stars were just as good.  Great entertainment for the whole family.  I would recommend this series to anyone who is tired of today's ""entertainment"" !

The packaging and quality of the DVD's is as good as it gets.  Amazon shipping & processing was also top notch!

I am looking forward to purchasing more seasons of the Virginian and will certainly order from Amazon!",1384041600,,627,4.535714285714286

4114546,4,B003ES5JOC,"Here are capsule impressions of selected episodes from season eight of ""The Virginian,"" another strong season, and the last in its original format.

THE LONG RIDE HOME -- Guest stars, Leslie Nielsen, Lonny Chapman
Young rover must decide whether to stick with his footloose partner or settle at Shiloh. Gritty yarn introduced Tim Matheson's likable Jim Horn character to the series. Nielsen stands out as usual as a rootless saddle bum. Snowy cattle drive scene is rarity for show commonly situated in a perpetually sunny studio Wyoming.

A FLASH OF DARKNESS -- Guest stars, James Whitmore, Pamela McMyler
Sightless after a head injury, The Virginian is nursed by a horse thief's daughter. Depicting the terror and bewilderment of the newly blind pushes Drury well outside his comfort zone, but he delivers a tour de force, possibly his best work in the series' entire nine-year run. A restrained Whitmore and winsome McMyler also resonate. Music by Leonard Rosenman.

THE POWER SEEKERS -- Guest stars, Barry Sullivan, Andrew Prine, Davey Davison
Clay Grainger is deceived into entering an election race that soon becomes nasty. Astute scenario by Robert Van Scoyk turns a legislative contest in Wyoming territory into a microcosm of the lying, corruption, double-dealing and dirty tricks so ingrained in American politics. Sullivan does a masterful Abe Lincoln slouch as an aging lawmaker who's fed up and wants to quit.

THE RUNAWAY -- Guest stars, Guy Stockwell, Peter Whitney, Jan Shepard, Johnnie Whitaker
Boy abused by cruel custodian escapes to seek his father, who's the Medicine Bow town drunk. Future movie Tom Sawyer Whitaker gets a head start in this Twain-influenced tale. Treacly outcome is averted through a jarring late plot twist. Stockwell is excellent as the haggard, self-pitying soak. Composer Fred Steiner, best known for the ""Perry Mason"" theme, wrote the sympathetic score.

A LOVE TO REMEMBER -- Guest stars, Diane Baker, Fred Beir
The Virginian's growing attachment to a woman from the East is marred by traumatic memories from her past, which resurface in Medicine Bow. Baker performs with stylish grace in romantic puzzle carefully assembled by director Joseph Pevney. Less serious-minded viewers may notice that while Drury is brooding over his rupturing love affair, McClure is having a barrel of fun: Trampas dates a trapeze performer, wins a sack race and spins a nonsensical whopper about a hoop snake.

A TOUCH OF HANDS -- Guest stars, Belinda Montgomery, Michael Constantine
Trampas agrees to marry an eastern-educated girl despite her fanciful notions about ranch life. Realistic drama written by John Dunkel gives western mythology a sharp poke in the eye. McClure and John McIntire share a high comedy moment: Trampas has to ask Grainger for a loan but goes completely tongue-tied.

JOURNEY TO SCATHELOCK -- Guest stars, Anne Helm, Burr DeBenning
Horn chases a bitter saloon girl and her crony after they scam him out of Shiloh cash. Helm's richly detailed portrayal of the unhappy tart paints some color into routine story further lifted by a glorious tall-pine location shoot. Tame conclusion to this and many other season eight episodes reflected an ongoing NBC network anti-violence kick.

NIGHTMARE -- Guest star, Joan Crawford
A widow struggles to keep her sanity after being accused of murder. Hollywood legend Crawford is up to her ears in trouble in this loaded melodrama, co-written by actress Bethel Leslie, that makes ""Mildred Pierce"" look like a cakewalk by comparison. Crawford's a bit long in the tooth for it, but watching her is like flipping through the last pages of a cherished family album.

A KING'S RANSOM -- Guest stars, Patrick Macnee, Jackie DeShannon
Three Aussie outlaws kidnap Grainger. Tattered script leaves plot gaps wide enough to drive cattle through. A waste of time for everyone, especially pop singer DeShannon in a nondescript acting fling.

THE SINS OF THE FATHER -- Guest star, Robert Lipton
Mysterious gunman who rescued The Virginian from robbers hires on at Shiloh despite his obvious hatred of Grainger. Dandyish Lipton, brother of ""The Mod Squad"" star Peggy, scores as the fast draw with a hidden agenda. Cagey script wrings a nifty variation out of cliched showdown-at-sunset climax from Owen Wister's novel. Tim McIntire brings Falstaffian good cheer to his brief part as real-life gunslinger John Wesley Hardin.",1379635200,9,4397,5.206506364922206

If you like westerns in general, you can't help but love The Virginian series...a real look at what life was like in those days with cattle drives, growing railroads, and the daily struggles not just against the elements, but against one another during a time when farmers and ranchers had their differences, and the definition of manhood often meant an early demise at the expense of a gun or rope.

8395607,4,B003ES5JOC,"The Virginian was one of the best westerns, IMHO. The episodes were 90 minutes, so there was far more story and character development than most other shows could accommodate. The main characters didn't all appear in every episode. That probably would have been too taxing - this was back in the days of 25+ episodes in a season. But that meant each of the main characters had entire episodes built around them fairly regularly, allowing them to cultivate fully rounded characters.

This season suffered from the aftermath of the Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy assassinations, when violence was taboo in TV writing. As tragic as these events were, it just wasn't possible to write realistic Westerns without violence. Without adequate law enforcement, the Old West was a violent time in American history. To depict it any other was simply not believable. This is the reason I gave this season 4 stars instead of 5. But there is plenty of great television in this season.

 am so happy these are available. I am hoping to collect every season.",1472342400,,1047,4.870786516853933
