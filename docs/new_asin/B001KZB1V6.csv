3674585,4,B001KZB1V6,"For those who don't already know, the ""Legends Of Wrestling"" program is a program on WWE 24/7 On Demand channel that's a roundtable discussion featuring wrestling stars of the past speaking on various subjects.  2 out of 3 of these disc (and the other 3 bonus disc) contains the entire first season of the show which the subject was wrestling stars of the 1980's featuring Dusty Rhodes, Jim Ross, Pat Patterson, Michael Hayes, and Mike Graham.  The ""Heatseekers"" disc is from the second season containing a panel of Jim Ross, Jerry Lawler, Michael Hayes, Mick Foley, and Eric Bischoff.  Throughout each discussion, you'll hear various personal & behind the scenes stories of each individual mentioned along with rare video highlights & pictures to showcase the point being put across.  On each disc, you'll get a set of bonus matches with most of them not ever being released on DVD before or even seen on national television before either...with Jesse Ventura's commentry not removed from the matches.

Ric Flair & Sgt. Slaughter: Flair's revolved around how he lived his gimmick, was able to make stars including a certain one that Michael Hayes himself said that he ""would never forgive Flair for"", the difference between himself & Hulk Hogan as the two dominate World Champions of the 1980's, along with stories about his history Dusty Rhodes & Dick Murdock.  Sgt. Slaughter's discussion featured stories & discussions of how Pat Patterson brought him in, how great of a character & real man he is, the infamous ""Iraq"" heel run he had, the issues regarding his sudden WWE departure in 1984, and his importance as a backstage agent.
Bonus material in regards to Slaughter include a Mid-Atlantic match vs. Mike Rotundo (later known as I.R.S.), Texas Death Match vs. WWE Champion Bob Backlund, vs. Iron Sheik, Boot Camp Match vs. Col. BeBeers from AWA SuperClash III '88.  Flair's bonus material includes his Starrcade '88 match vs. Lex Luger, vs. Curt Hennig from Nitro in Oct. '99, and the Thunderdome Cage match from Halloween Havoc '89 with Sting vs. Terry Funk & Great Muta.

Jerry Lawler & Junkyard Dog: The panel's discussion regarding Lawler mostly revolved around his ability to remain the top star in the Memphis territory, Andy Kaufman, being able to ""talk fans into the arena"", and his successful transition into being a color commentator.  Junkyard Dog's discussion turned out to be one of the best ones on this entire set as you hear them heavily talk about him breaking down racial barrier in not only wrestling but sports period, what made him appeal to all audiences, with the highlight being the story behind the infamous ""blind JYD"" angle with the Freebirds that resulted in so much heat that Michael Hayes said it himself that, ""I've never felt my life more threatened than in that era.""
Lawler's extras include a tag match with Jimmy Valiant vs. Michael Hayes & Kerry Von Erich, vs. Owen Hart, his ""trainwreck"" of a match with Roddy Piper from King Of The Ring '94, two matches with Bret Hart from the first In Your House in 1995 & the ""Kiss My Foot"" match from King Of The Ring the next month, and vs. Marty Garner.  JYD's bonus matches include a tag match with Sgt. Slaughter vs. Iron Sheik & Nikolai Volkoff, his WrestleMania matches vs. Greg Valentine & Harley Race, the Wrestling Classic tournament final vs. Randy Savage, two Saturday Night's Main Event matches vs. Adrian Adonis & Harley Race.

Heatseekers: This episode is based around wrestlers who caused the most backstage problems with either management or the talent themselves.  The first name brought up was Michael Hayes himself & the Freebirds with Lawler telling a story that would becomine a running joke throughout the show.  Lex Luger's attitude that rubbed so many people the wrong way, the Bill Goldberg theory of how he was ""a nice guy AWAY from the business"", the story behind Lawler breaking Paul Heyman's jaw on purpose, the backstage troubles of Scott Hall were also discussed along with Jim Ross' story regarding a phone call he recieved from Buff Bagwell's mother.  Another subject that was heavily debated was the mean spirited paraodies in wrestling with Vince Russo's personal attack on Jim Ross with ""Oklahoma"", the nWo's mockery of Arn Anderson's retirement speech (and the irony behind that almost decade later), and Vince McMahon's ""Dr. Hiney"".
The bonus matches here include the Freebirds WWE debut alongside David Wolfe & Cyndi Lauper, Luger & Windham vs. NWA Tag Team Champions Anderson & Blanchard from the first Clash Of The Champions, the ""Loser Leaves NWA"" match between Jim Cornette & Midnight Express vs. Paul E. Dangerously & the Original Midnight Express from Chi-Town Rumble '89 along with the hysterical interviews done on TV the week before, NWA U.S. Champion Lex Luger vs. Michael Hayes from WrestleWar '89, WCW U.S. Champion Goldberg vs. Scott Hall from Nitro in July '97, Scott Hall vs. Kevin Nash from Halloween Havoc '98, the cage match where Vince Russo won the WCW Championship from Booker T (yes, you read that right), and a boxing match between Buff Bagwell & Roddy Piper from WCW Bash At The Beach '99.  For those fans of wrestling who didn't start turning in until past the late 80's, this is the disc that would appeal the most to you the most.

Best Buy Bonus Disc-
Bob Backlund & Hulk Hogan: The panel here covered the critism regarding Backlund's charisma & personality, his ability to work out & stay in shape...to this day at his age, the reasoning & setup behind his title reign, the role of his manager, why he left WWE after losing the title, and the reason why he's not in the WWE Hall Of Fame.  Hulkster's discussion talked about his introduction to the wrestling business, charisma, time in AWA, effects of Hulkamania & impact of Rocky III, if he has overstayed his welcome, an interesting debate comparing him to Dusty Rhodes himself, and who made whom: WWE or Hogan.
Bob Backlund's bonus matches include matches against title matches against Spiros Arion, Buddy Rose, and his cage match against Jimmy Snuka.  The bonus matches for Hulk Hogan include an AWA tag match with the High Flyers vs. Jesse Ventura & Bobby Heenan & Ken Patera, another AWA tag match with Andre The Giant vs. Bobby Heenan & Bobby Duncum & Nick Bockwinkle & Ken Patera, and a Saturday Night's Main Event match vs. Harley Race.

Iron Sheik & Andre The Giant: This discussion was based more about the panels personal (and most times, hysterical) stories of the wrestlers themselves than various topics.
For those who didn't catch it, the Iron Sheik's famous Hall Of Fame speech is shown here before getting into the discussion with the highlights being Michael Hayes talking about the time Sheik failed a drug test & a roadtrip he took with Sheik & Jimmy Garvin & ""Mary Jane"" while subjects like his backstory & elements of his character was talked about.  Andre The Giant's discussion was very similar with stories of being a giant, his drinking, and one about what happened when Pat Patterson roomed with Andre one time that you have to hear to believe before going into his heavy involvement with WrestleMania III and his relationship with wrestlers that he did & didn't like.
Bonus matches here for the Iron Sheik include a match vs. Tito Santana, vs. Bob Backlund (not the title switch), two matches with Nikolai Volkoff vs. U.S. Express including their WrestleMania match.  Andre's matches include one vs. Hulk Hogan from 1980, vs. King Kong Bundy, vs. Randy Savage, and a tag match with Rocky Johnson vs. Don Muraco & Big John Studd.

Roddy Piper & Terry Funk: Piper's discussion slightly makes up for the lack of NWA talk on his DVD but not much as they did discuss his role as a color commentator right besides Gordon Solie, his Starrcade '83 match, his promo ability, being able to cross over as a successful actor, and his wrestling ability.  Funk's discussion started off with a typical ""well, that's Terry Funk"" story about the 4th of July & hand gernades along with Dusty telling a story about a recent match they had that was so crazy that Dusty didn't even want to say the town's name, his family history, and the politics behind his NWA reign amongst other things.  Unfortunally, this is one of the flops discussion wise because they started getting off subject of Funk & discussing other wrestling related items.
Bonus matches here featuring Roddy Piper include the lost Piper's Pit where Roddy interviews himself (CLASSIC PIPER!!!), his amateur wrestling match with Ric Flair, a crazy brawl vs. Paul Orndorff, two Saturday Night's Main Event matches against Bob Orton & Haku, his steel cage match vs. Rick Rude, an entertaining match vs. Intercontinental Champion Mr. Perfect.  Terry Funk's bonus material includes his Saturday Night's Main Event match vs. Junkyard Dog, the ""I Quit"" match vs. Ric Flair along with the prematch interviews from both men, his ""Clash Of The Champions"" match vs. Ricky Steamboat, and his ""legends match"" vs. Tully Blanchard from Slamboree '94 which had some faces that hardcore ECW fans would recognize (as Terry did before the match) in the front row.

Overall this collection is certainly for the old school wrestling fans of the 1980's with the Heatseekers episode being the one disc that would appeal to the wrestling fans of the 1990's.  Overall, I recommend since this is the closest we'll get to DVD releases/matches on some of these wrestlers.",1233446400,,9418,4.87
3674586,5,B001KZB1V6,"If anyone is wondering if this set is worth getting, I offer one word... YES! this is a 3 disc set featuring panel discussions from WWE 24/7. What really made this set worth the money was the match selections. Which weren't mediocre like some WWE compilation sets are. I was surprised to see how good these match picks were. Although not perfect, (nothing is really) But it's a great addition to your wrestling dvd collection. Heck, the WCW matches make it worth the purchase alone.(at least for me anyways)

I thought the Vince Russo VS. Booker. T match was funny! A few hilarious spots where Ric flair comes to the ring disguised as a EMT and gives Russo a few shots. And Goldberg coming down and spearing Russo through the cage! I also thought Sgt. Slaughter VS. Bob Backlund match was very good too. I never realised how good a wrestler Bob Backlund was until I saw this match. Although I found the match to be slow at some points, I gotta give credit to Backlund for staying with Slaughter move after move and hold after hold!

The Kiss My Foot match that Bret Hart and Lawler had was a treat to see! I remember this match, and I was so happy to see Bret make Lawler kiss his own stinky foot! The WCW matches I will treasure the most. I remember the Halloween Havoc match between Nash and Hall. I found the ending to suit the match rather well. It was like a love tap match than anything else. Nash wanted to ""talk"" some sense into Scott Hall. I remember Nash giving Hall the jacknife and walking out of the ring. This match wasn't about getting a pinfall, it was about two friends who occasionally spat, and in the end work things out.

Although I do have one complaint however. Boxing Match:Buff Bagwell VS. Roddy Piper. Bash At The Beach 1999. I have no idea what WCW was thinking when they hashed this crap together. I would've prefered an actual wrestling match than this one. I personally thought this made Roddy Piper look like a fool. I mean how in the world could the bookers decide to have Buff Bagwell win over Roddy Piper?! think about it.... BUFF BAGWELL?!!! Not to mention the cheesy ending! This is the only one I felt could've been left out! (Heck, I'd even settle for Bagwell VS. Lochness from WCW Saturday night than this one. Even though he wasn't ""Buff"" then.)

I thought the panel discussions were very interesting. As Jim Ross, Dusty Rhodes, Michael Hayes,Pat Patterson, and Mike Graham talk about the careers of Jerry Lawler, Junkyard Dog,Ric Flair & Sargent Slaughter.

And Jim Ross, Michael Hayes, Mick Foley,Eric Bischoff, and Jerry The King Lawler talk about the Heatseekers of the wrestling business. Such as Lex Luger, Buff Bagwell, Scott Hall, Paul Hayman,and much more!

So all in all I think you'll find this set very well put together and entertaining. I highly recommend this one!",1233273600,,2819,4.583333333333333
3674587,3,B001KZB1V6,"I didn't want to get this set but the match listing was pretty strong. You can get bonus dvds of this set exclusively at Best Buy. Its the same set up with lots more bonus matches but none really caught my eye. Maybe i'll try to get the Hogan/Backlund set too see what they say of Hogan. Back to this set though. You can watch these for free on You Tube (sorry for all the plugs, just call me Mick Foley), so you'd buy it just for matches. I watched Heatseekers, disc three. It sounded good but the panelist-Eric Bischoff, Michael Hayes, Mick Foley, and Jerry Lawler along with moderator Jim Ross, discuss wrestlers who were difficult to deal with. The match list is great but the show itself was a mess. All four men tried to get in words and Mick Foley just liked everyone. Hayes looked at Bischoff like he wanted to smack him most of the time. It was a complete mess and I really didn't feel like watching the other two yet.",1233014400,,927,4.2727272727272725
3674588,4,B001KZB1V6,"These roundtable shows are one of the best features of the WWE 24/7 channel.  I've seen all of these and my personal favorites were the heatseekers discussion (they kill Russo, Bagwell, and Scott Hall) and the Ric Flair discussion.

The discussion about the Monday Night Wars is exceptional.  Eric Bischoff is on the panel and he gets grilled pretty good by Mick Foley and Jim Ross.  It doesn't get out of hand or anything, but it is interesting to see and hear Bischoff defend some of the decisions he made while running WCW.  Foley even asks him about the night Bischoff told Tony Schiavone that Foley was winning the WWF title on a taped RAW that was airing at the same time.  Judge for yourself whether Eric's reaction was genuine or not.",1231891200,,742,4.583333333333333

8316616,5,B001KZB1V6,"When I saw this set debut here on Amazon weeks before it's release, I was intrigued since WWE 24/7 is not available in my area, but I actually thought that someone had hacked Amazon and posted a fake cover for this set. Buff Bagwell on a WWE DVD cover?! However, that is the real cover (actually the slipcase). However, don't let the uninspired cover art fool you, this is one of the must own WWE DVD releases of the year for the following reasons...

First, each roundtable discussion is only 1 hour in length, that leaves nearly 2.5 hours of room left over on each disc, that is filled with bonus matches, many of which are making their DVD debut and are matches fans have wanted to see released for years. I won't list them all, but some of the matches you'll get are...

Ric Flair and Sting vs. Terry Funk and The Great Muta - Thunderdome Match from Halloween Havoc '89

Ric Flair vs. Curt Hennig - Nitro '99

NWA United States Championship: Lex Luger vs. Michael Hayes - Wrestlewar '89

Loser Leaves NWA: The Midnight Express vs. The Original Midnight Express - Chi-Town Rumble '89

NWA Tag Team Title: Lex Luger and Barry Windham vs. Tully Blanchard and Arn Anderson - Clash of Champions '88

Junkyard Dog vs. Randy ""Macho Man"" Savage - The Wrestling Classic Tournament Finals '85

Jerry Lawler vs. Bret Hart - ""Kiss My Foot Match"" King of the Ring '95

Jerry Lawler vs. Bret Hart - In Your House '95

So, there's much more on these 3-discs than just roundtable discussions, which I think is great!
As for the roundtable discussions, some people will not like them because if you have just an hour and you spend thirty minutes on each wrestler, needless to say you can barely scratch the surface of each man's career. With that said, I wasn't looking for in-depth discussion. Instead, the discussions play out like a group of friends getting together and simply reminiscing and telling fun stories about pro-wrestling. If you enjoy talking about wrestling with your friends, then imagine the same thing, but from the point of view of those inside the business. The most insightful discussion was the ""Heatseeker"" episode. The panel, that consists of Jim Ross, Jerry Lawler, Mick Foley, Eric Bischoff and Michael Hayes, told the best stories of the entire DVD set. I also heard stories and info that I had never heard anywhere else. So, the discussions are entertaining, but don't look for a serious education of the wrestling business or it's history.
