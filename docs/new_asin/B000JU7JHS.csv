8153271,5,B000JU7JHS,"I love this movie!  While I agree with another reviewer who stated that the original (Louis Jordan, et al) was better, this is still a great movie; so much so, that I own both the original and this one!  The story line and characterizations are just different enough that you have to watch each of the movies on its own merit and not compare the two.",1427500800,2,350,4.287878787878788

8153274,5,B000JU7JHS,"Have watched for this movie to become available on DVD for years.  Finally it is here.  Even though I don't often like re-makes of classic films, this one does a great job with a new/fresh story line, wonderful acting and is perfectly balanced with humor, drama and sentiment.  Love it.",1387929600,2,286,4.68
8153275,3,B000JU7JHS,"Because three people really liked this movie, I had wanted to buy it at the same time as I bought the 1954 version, but I considered it too expensive.  Since it has gone down in price, I finally ordered it. However, I cannot say that I found this movie as good as the first one.  It lost its first star with the title song because  I consider Frank Sinatra's version superior.

While I found Loni Anderson, Stepfanie Kramer and Shanna Reed appealing, they were possibly prettier but not better than Dorothy McGuire, Jean Peters and Maggie McNamara.  And there is no question in my mind about the men.  The new set cannot even come close to Clifton Webb, Louis Jourdan and Rossano Brazzi (sorry, fellows!).

But as I said in the title of my review, it is just my opinion and therefore a matter of taste.",1383782400,3,802,4.4520547945205475
8153276,5,B000JU7JHS,"THE DVD WAS VERY CLEAR AND NO INTERRUPTIONS OR SMUDGES OR SCRATCHES.  SOUND WAS
GOOD AND ENJOYED IT IMMENSELY - SO NOSTALGIC",1362268800,,124,4.636363636363637
8153277,5,B000JU7JHS,"I watch and own a lot of rom-com's, and this remake of the orginal (Three Coins in the Foutain), is way better!  I happened to catch this on tv back in 1990 and have been looking for it ever since. I also bought the orginal movie to compare it to this one and the other one fell flat, and wasn't as fun.  I highly recommend this version!",1327017600,2,337,4.014925373134329
8153278,5,B000JU7JHS,"Years ago I was on the way to my vacation to the U.S.A. - The night before I could not sleep, because I was exited of the upcoming trip. This movie was on german T.V. and I fell in love with it. For years I have checked with Amazon, whether it was on DVD or not. I like the way those actresses interact with each other. Every one of them, beautiful in her own special way and funny. It is an innocent movie, a little about life, friendship, love and the past to affect the present and what can be done about it.",1205625600,6,511,3.970873786407767
