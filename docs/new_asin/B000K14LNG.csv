However, there was a major segment missing which made the film make no real sense. I believe we sent it back and replaced it, only to find that she same segment was missing from the replacement too. We were sad b c it's such a fun film. Well, another few years go by and I thought I'd try again. I thought surely it would be corrected by now. And thank-heavens! it was corrected. I can't say enough about having the whole family watch this together. It's great fun for all ages and for different reasons. We LOVED the old 2nd WW cars and clothes styles. It's cornie and delightful; like watching animated cartoons almost, but better.",1395532800,2,770,4.429577464788732
8153817,3,B000K14LNG,"This film is based on the last story of the Jack Tales which are Appalachian folk tales collected and retold by Richard Chase and published back in 1943.  As so often is the case, the film is not nearly as good as the written story but, it was good enough where I was satisfied with my purchase.  My biggest pet peeves with the film were the narration and the last line.  Tom Davenport, if you are reading these reviews, the last line should have ended with, ""I reckon"".  There's a reason for that and not just because that is the way it ended in the story.

The tone of the narration was off too.  You would imagine, if the narrator were sitting in front of you telling the story, that he would have a perpetual half smile on his face.  It would have been better done if the narrator spoke as though he had more of a personal connection with the main character.  As a result, his delivery would reflect more variation in tone and would cover a wider range of emotion that accurately reflected the events in the story especially providing some sorrow at the end. (there's a hint why the ending of the film should have included ""I reckon"".)  I know it is supposed to just a kid's story told by backwoods mountain folk but, these tales run deeper than that. If Mr. Daveport wants to appeal to a wider audience, he needs to keep that in mind.  He didn't here.  The film was shallow and too one dimensional across the board even it were only intended for children.

Perhaps I am being over critical because I am a real fan of the tales having told them many times.  I have that personal connection with the character and those mountain folk who sat around the fire late at night telling these tales. Despite my criticisms, I still find the film far and away better than 99% of what is showing at your local Cineplex.

If you buy this film and like it, or even if you don't, I would highly recommend Mutzmag, a film based on the story of the same name found in the collection of Appalachian stories called the Grandfather Tales.  Though far from perfect especially with a few glaring dialogue flubs, it is a MUCH better effort by Mr. Davenport, with an excellent and appropriate musical accompaniment and, fine performances by most of the main characters especially the lead character Robbie Sams.  I have watched this film many times and still love it.",1354147200,2,2348,4.450934579439252
