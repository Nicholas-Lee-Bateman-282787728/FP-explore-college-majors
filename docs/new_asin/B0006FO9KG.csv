2182812,5,B0006FO9KG,"This was one of the coolest animated movies I've ever seen. Bernie Mac, Lil Kim, and Ludacris were all hilarious. The animation looks great too. Totally different look than most cartoons. I  highly recommend this to anyone that wants to see a comedy that's different.",1105920000,2,267,4.933333333333334
2182813,3,B0006FO9KG,I could not see this done in anything else other than animation. A well put together cast with a hilarious adult humored story. Bernie Mac continues to make me laugh with his raw humor. What else could be funnier than a very young small white boy as a pimp? Take the time to watch this and I guarantee you will have quite a few laughs. Look for the boys pet rat too!,1104796800,,366,4.097222222222222
2182814,4,B0006FO9KG,"wHEN I FIRST HEARD ABOUT THIS ANIMATED VIDEO, I WAS DOUBTFUL BUT ONCE i ACTUALLY SAW IT I WAS LAFFING HYSTERICALLY.

 THIS IS NOT FOR CHILDREN AT ALL. MAD PROPS TO BERNIE MACK TRUE TO FORM WITH HIS COMEDY ROUTINES.

TRUE IT'S A BIT STEREOTYPICAL, BUT SO WHAT KICK BACK AND ENJOY. EVERYONE THAT HAS WATCHED HAS ENJOYED IT.",1102464000,,321,4.406779661016949
2182845,5,B0006FO9KG,I got this movie for my husband.  He has been looking for this movie for a while and i found it on here!,1363046400,,104,3.5217391304347827
2182846,5,B0006FO9KG,"My husband used to have this movie and recently realized it was missing.  So we bought another copy, (I had never seen it before) and received it within a week.  It came exactly as described, in great condition. The movie itself is definitely NOT for kids because of the raunchiness... But it is a great movie!!! I laughed so hard. Two thumbs up!",1329523200,,346,4.476190476190476
2182847,5,B0006FO9KG,"Sorry for the delay - I'm out of town at this time and I reviewed this last night but I must have forgotten to submit. The CD was in excellent condition and arrived in a timely manner.

Thanks,

Lorine",1250726400,,201,4.128205128205129
2182848,5,B0006FO9KG,"If you are a Bernie Mac fan as I am, you will love this one. His voice is so recognizable! The plot is absolutely stupid but I think that it draws its strength from it. Don't take it too seriously, just watch with an open mind and trust me you will love it...Bravo! RIP B-MAC",1239148800,,275,4.0181818181818185
2182849,5,B0006FO9KG,"for grown ups only, rael funny movies. special guest rudy ray moore. i rate this 4-stars****",1223942400,,92,4.8125
2182850,5,B0006FO9KG,I love this film. I thought that it was real funny. I was told to watch this when I was stationed in Korea it started and I thought that this was going to be cheesy but it got good. If you don't like racist comments or bad language this is not the movie for you. NOT FOR KIDS.,1194480000,,276,3.7758620689655173
2182851,4,B0006FO9KG,"I truly enjoyed this movie, it was soo funny.  I the quality of the disk that I received and the speed in which I received my order was awesome.",1170028800,,144,3.9655172413793105
2182852,4,B0006FO9KG,"I surprised myself with this.  A friend and I watched this last night and we were in hysterics.  It's crude, sure.  It's gross at times, sure.  But I guess small things for small minds (me) and I actually liked this.  I love all things Bernie Mac.  He's great, and I didn't think I could go wrong with Bernie and animation.  The ferret (Ludacris) was hillarious and in fact everyone did a great job.  This isn't for everyone.  I think you need to let go of your defences watching it, and whether you admit it or not, you will probably like it.  It's good escapism with lots of potty jokes, but put that aside and just enjoy the ride.",1138147200,,633,4.288135593220339
2182853,3,B0006FO9KG,that Little white Boy turning into a Pimp cracks me up. His Mommy turned out real nicely sweet double Lawd Jesus!!!Ludacris was funny as well. dug the voices in  the film. there was a message involved from start to finish.this is a cool little film.,1137801600,,249,4.533333333333333
2182854,3,B0006FO9KG,"Many of the better films nowadays are cartoons. In the mid 90s when Disney brought Hollywood back on track with the ""Lion King"" and ""Aladdin"", adult viewers claimed that these films were made for adults too. Unforunately, that became an excuse used by adults who didn't actually have adult cartoons readily available for their viewing pleasure.

Yes, ""Lil Pimp"" has an adult themed plot. The plot wasn't really what it needed in order to go from being an average cartoon to a good animation. The movie actually needed to connect with the audience it was aimed for. The main charater in ""Lil Pimp"" is a young white child. Although the idea of a young white kid learning how to be a pimp seems funny, it wasn't in the film. For more laughable humor go watch ""Madagascar"". The viewing pleasure of the cartoon laid strictly in sexy cartoon figures.

The truth is that this film was aimed at the wrong audience. The audience that this film should have been aimed at does not exist. We are talking about a cartoon that is to hard for kids and to soft for adults. The sad part of cartoon was the attempt to create touching family moments within the film. The reunion of mother and son........please. Of course this movie was going straight to video.",1135641600,,1242,4.615384615384615
2182872,5,B0006FO9KG,"Well I have to say, I didn't even know about this film until a friend of mine brought it up when it was released on dvd. As soon as I did some research and seen who the cast was I was curious. Then I read some of the horrible reviews the film got by critics and I knew right away I had to get it. As we all know critics tend to bash the funniest films because they need to be politically correct. As soon as I got this dvd in the mail and watched it I laughed so hard I had to tell all my friends and now they all want it so Christmas shopping will be easy for me this year. Hehe, if you like comedy and you actually have a sense of humor, then this film is for you. If you can't take a joke then you should join the other reviewers in here that bashed this movie for a fruit cocktail. Pimpin ain't easy.",1134259200,4,804,3.7916666666666665
2182873,1,B0006FO9KG,"Now, here I thought I had run this thing out of production a few years ago, only to find out it's been released as a dvd.  I don't even recall how I found out about this thing, but I mounted a campaign against it for the racist piece of trash and drivel that it is.  Why did these black actors make this thing?  Why did these two racist white boys make this movie?  Why do they keep perpetuating women as willing and eager [...]?  Why didn't they do white women this way?  Did these two white boys dream of pimping black women when they were that young?  I am going to write amanzon a protest letter as I purchase exclusively from them, I may have to take my business elswhere or just buy direct from the stores.  PLEASE DO NOT WAST YOUR MONEY ON THIS RACIST PIECE OF TRASH AND DRIVEL!  I actually give it no stars so scratch the one above.  I couldn't get away with giving it none.",1126915200,2,882,4.135294117647059
2182874,1,B0006FO9KG,"After watching Bernie Mac in a number of his movies I found his comedy extremely funny.  This movie is up there with the worst of animated comedy I have ever seen.  The main character's annoying high pitched voice was enough to infuriate anyone.  The jokes were extremely lame and the plot didn't go anywhere.  If you want to suffer through 75mins of your life this movie is the one for you.  Any comparisons between this movie and South Park are clearly not valid as South Park is actually funny.  If you want my advice on the film I say ""you could burn your money and get a better investment out of it than buying this one""",1124409600,2,625,4.344827586206897
2182875,4,B0006FO9KG,"Think of South Park meets The Family Guy, then use the theme of Pimps up, hoe's down. LOL!",1123113600,3,90,4.055555555555555
2182876,4,B0006FO9KG,"I remember when this was in the works, some civil rights folks out in LA were already talking about boycotting and banning this.

First of all, all that did (as it always does, will they ever learn?) was make people curious about it and check it out in droves on DVD (in the words of Rocky the Flying Squirrel, ""But that trick NEVER works!"").

In either case, this movie is so wild and over the top that it is IMPOSSIBLE to take seriously. This is a bizzare (and admittedly imaginative) cartoon of a lonely white suburban kid who finds a father figure in a pimp named ""Fruit Juice"" (voiced expertly by Bernie Mac). The Mac and a prostitute voiced by Little Kim (again, perfect casting) teach the boy about the Pimp game and about life in general.

There could be concerns that like ""Soul Plane,"" this would be nothing but trashy stereotypes. Perhaps, but it's a guilty pleasure with some really charming and funny moments. (The scene where the kid takes the Pimp and Little Kim to school for ""show and tell"" is a SCREAM!). Yeah, one could go on and on about stereotypes, the morality of a story involving children and pimping, etc. but unlike ""The Mack,""  ""American Pimp,"" ad nauseum, this film does not take itself seriosuly and is clearly just a comedy.

Basically, leave your brains (and the kiddies) and all the analysis and sociology at the door for this one- get some of your buddies over for beer and pizza, and LAFF Your (posterior) OFF!

BTW-It would help this DVD if they added some of the original web ""Lil Pimp"" cartoons as extra features, as was the case with the ""Undercover Brother"" DVD.",1120262400,6,1602,4.564459930313589
2182877,5,B0006FO9KG,"if u like pimps, hoes,  an a 9 year old kid that wants 2 become a pimp...this is 4 u.  buncha other people give their voices 2 this , like william shatner, ludacris, and even jennifer tilly and carmen elektra even lend their voices.  sum great 1-liners,  and a s-load of valgarites.  .u should definately check it out  if u wanna have sum belly laughs.",1118361600,,352,4.338461538461538
2182878,5,B0006FO9KG,"I RENTED THIS MOVIE NOT KNOWING ANYTHING ABOUT IT. I SAW THE WORD ""PIMP"", AND SAID, ""I'LL GIVE IT A TRY"". AFTER WATCHING IT, I SAID, ""I GOT MY MONEY'S WORTH"". FIRST OF ALL, ALL THE MUSIC IN THIS MOVIE IS GREAT! (BLAXPLOITATION MASTERPIECES) SECOND, THE ANIMATION IS OUTSTANDING!! (BETTER THAN PIXAR) LIL KIM IS EXTREMELY CONVINCING AS THE MAIN PIMP'S BOTTOM LADY. BERNIE MAC GIVES A PEFORMANCE THAT MAKES ""THE MACK"" LOOK LIKE A CARTOON CHARACTER. LUDICRIS IS HILARIOUS AS THE LIL PIMP'S PET RAT. PLUS, A BONUS IN THE MOVIE IS THE PERFORMANCE BY RUDY RAY MORE AS THE CLOTHING DESIGNER TO THE CITY'S TOP PIMPS. DON'T LET THE R-RATING STOP YOU FROM RENTING OR BUYING THIS MOVIE. IT'S BETTER THAN ANY MOVIE THAT WAS NOMINATED FOR AN OSCAR THIS YEAR, OR ANY OTHER YEAR. I'M PUTTING THIS MOVIE ON MY LIST AS ONE OF MY TOP TEN MOVIES OF ALL TIME. IF YOU WATCH THIS MOVIE ONCE, I PROMISE YOU THAT IT'LL BE ON YOUR LIST, TOO.",1110067200,,916,4.394117647058824
2182879,5,B0006FO9KG,"When I saw Lil' Pimp on the web back in 1998, I knew that the names Brooks and Dilstrap would one day be synomous with likes of Scorsese, Speilberg and Kubrick.  See you next year Oscar!",1109635200,2,186,4.166666666666667
2182880,1,B0006FO9KG,"Luckily I only rented this movie.

Parts were funny, parts made me want to go get a refund from the videostore.

Lots of scenes made me smack my forehead and think to myself, ""What the heck. That's so stupid"" or ""Ack! That's so wrong!""",1108857600,,235,4.318181818181818
2182881,5,B0006FO9KG,"I was skeptical at first when I saw the DVD cover, but I was more than pleasantly surprised when I sat through this divine comedy.  The dialog was world class and the jokes delivered a one, two punch to my funny bone!  What a hilarious concept!; a naive young innocent white kid connects with a group of pimps and saves the day! I was literally on the edge of my seat wondering how this movie was going to end.  I know that audiences of all ages and tastes will identify with the main characters in this movie.  It's an emotional roller coaster; I laughed, I cried, I was swept away. Kudos to the writer and the director for giving me 80 minutes of pure comedy bliss!!!  Hey PIXAR!!, eat your heart out.",1107302400,2,703,4.295454545454546
