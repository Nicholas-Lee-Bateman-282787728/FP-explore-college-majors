3466591,2,B001ASIHTW,"The movie was very good. A good story about two brothers coming up in 1930s Germany, and through 1945. However, the quality of the dvd was not good. To me it looked something that was copied off a VHS, (by an amateur) onto a dvd. The movie quality was not professionally restored. I have a top of the line Plasma TV, and I could not improve the picture with my remote by changing picture modes, size, contrast, etc. If this was a quality dvd restoration, it would be excellent.------Don Sawyer, Rochester, NY",1298678400,6,508,4.532608695652174
3466592,4,B001ASIHTW,"This is not a documentary.  It's a made-for-TV production.  This movie is an eye-opener for anyone under the false belief that Germany under the Nazi regime was totally behind the Nazi Party.  Specifically, it illustrates how perfectly decent, normal people can get innocently caught up in the vortex of extreemism where the only escape is the end of society as they knew it.  Anyone wondering how a country with the most PhD's per capita could fall under a government should see this movie.  It is a lesson in political extreemism and the consequences of it.  The story line is, however, predictable and the appearances of actors like Jose Ferra and Tony Randall do help pull up the performances of some of the other lessor talented actors.  Absolutely fabulous portrayial of Reinhard Heydrich by David Warner.",1253318400,8,811,4.962962962962963
3466593,1,B001ASIHTW,I bought this video in the mistaken belief that it was a documentary.  It isn't.  What it is is a very badly made movie.  Probably the worst movie I've ever seen.  Don't buy it.,1228694400,,177,4.117647058823529

3466618,4,B001ASIHTW,"Specialists in niche market material such as vintage programmers and TV shows, Pennsylvania-based ALPHA VIDEO is owned by Jerry Greene, founder of Collectable Records. Quality of their unrestored movie transfers varies from fair to good, based on condition of source material stock (often old 16mm broadcast prints). The only extras provided are a catalog insert and DVD-accessible title list.

There is a question as to accuracy of AMMY's ALPHA listing.
The tape box claims it's the full film (135 minutes), AMMY details suggest only 90.

HITLER'S S.S. - PORTRAIT IN EVIL (1985) stars John Shea, Bill Nighy and Lucy Gutteridge.
Also with Carroll Baker, David Warner, Tony Randall, Michael Elphick and Jos&eacute; Ferrer.

This two-plus hour film tells how the Third Reich, from rise to fall,
affects the lives of several fictional characters.

It's the story of two brothers who take different directions in 1930s Germany, during the years when Hitler came to power and solidified the Nazi state. One (Nighy) becomes assistant to a high-ranking S.S. officer, the other (Shea) is a driver in Ernst R&ouml;hm's S.A. (Storm Batallion). This association with the Brown Shirts soon proves a bad choice, for R&ouml;hm (Elphick) is accused by his supposed close friend Hitler (Colin Jeavons) of being a traitor. His S.A. is violently done away with on the ""Night of the Long Knives"" and R&ouml;hm is later murdered in his jail cell. This highly publicized 1934 death is reported in the Party newspaper as being the work of Jews, which plays into Der F&uuml;hrer's nefarious ""Final Solution"" plot.

After this elimination of R&ouml;hm, the S.S. brother rescues the other from Dachau, but in so doing he endangers his own position in the Party.

Randall has a small role as Putzi, a rather fey nightclub comedian. Ferrer is a Jewish university professor who wrongly concludes that the Nazis mean his people no harm. He soon learns otherwise. Warner is excellent as the stern S.S. commander who's devoid of a conscience.",1407974400,,2013,5.103343465045593
3466619,4,B001ASIHTW,Very interesting story about 2 brothers torn between their loyalties. Hitler's SS were truely monsters.,1405641600,,103,5.933333333333334
3466620,5,B001ASIHTW,"This dramatisation of Nazi Germany begins in 1933, immediately after the Nazis gain uncontested power over the German people. Two brothers, Helmut and Karl Hoffman, a university student and mechanic respectively, contemplate their respective futures. Young, idealistic and compassionate, they defend their Jewish professor from a Nazi beating. Helmut tries to dissuade his brother from joining the Nazis.

Even at this early stage, some individuals see through the veneer of false prosperity proposed by the Nazis. A veteran mechanic informs Karl that despite the name of the party, there will be no socialism in any meaningful sense of the word. All they desire is power. Raw, uncontested control over Germany, Poland and Europe.

Several years later, their positions are reversed. Helmut, lured by a steady income and comfortable life for his wife and son, has joined the SS. Karl has joined the SA. Both see different sides of the Nazi Wehrmacht and the hidden workings of a cultish and despotic regime. The propaganda tactics and ruthless crushing of dissent are brutal in their vividness. There is a notable absence of blood in most scenes, which is deceptive and serves to lessen the impact.

If this DVD edition had subtitles, it would be a more enjoyable experience. Some of the accents are difficult to make out. There is a wealth of relevant films and books listed in the extras section, along with biographies of Hitler and his henchmen.",1398038400,,1448,5.10126582278481

3466623,5,B001ASIHTW,"The cast is wonderful and give terrific perfomances. I can see the scenes in this movie
happening all over Germany during WW2 with divided households some loyal to Hitler and
others able to see through the propaganda.  Hitler promised no unions and that is a promise
he kept because that is a promise he made to the filthy rich that put him in power. This movie is so much more than entertainment it has a message that can apply to
each of us.  I rate this movie at the top they don't get any better.  Hugh Reeves",1361232000,2,513,4.268041237113402

Also there are a couple of places that had been edited out.  But for the price the edited out places were not enough to return for refund.",1488758400,,286,3.896551724137931
8279425,3,B001ASIHTW,"This version is the full version of the movie. The video quality is quite poor. The DVD itself is nothing but a DVD-R, but at least it has a professional looking label. This is not a documentary but instead is a fictional, made for TV movie.
The movie itself tells an interesting story though.
As this movie is rarely (if ever) aired on TV and the DVD copies are virtually non-existent, it's either this version or nothing at all.
Hopefully in the future someone remasters this movie for a better release.",1483056000,,505,4.56043956043956

8279428,4,B001ASIHTW,"This movie looks at two brothers who end up getting sucked into the Nazi orbit. The movie takes place between 1933 and 1945, from Hitler's initial electoral gains to his appointment as Chancellor, from the Night of the Long Knives to the invasion of Poland. The Hoffman family makes many compromises with their principles until nothing is left. An excellent film.",1451001600,,363,4.967213114754099
