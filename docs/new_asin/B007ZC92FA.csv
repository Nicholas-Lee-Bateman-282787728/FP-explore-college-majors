8523348,4,B007ZC92FA,After seeing the preview and seeing that BootsyCollins from Funkadelic did the voice of Hendrix that takes away from instead of letting the man speak for himself by tracking down the real audio but I suspect that has been done on other versions somewhere but after all its a mix match of stuff throughout his career. That's why I only gave it four stars.,1449360000,,354,4.546875
8523349,4,B007ZC92FA,"About the feature:
This is a documentary of Jimi Hendrix's life ""in his own words"", there is a narrator speaking as he was Jimi. Gathered from letters from Jimi to his family, interviews and other sources, gives a personal touch to the feature, innovative storytelling, gotta give it that.

About the content:
It isn't great tough, if you are looking for a detailed retrospective narrating every detail on how things came to happen you won't find it here, if you are looking for a concert film and a lot of performances, won't find that here either, it's more like a personal diary overview of jimi hendrix.

About the disc:
Given the source material, Bluray quality isn't great, it's as good as it gets of course, but no HD to be found here. What I think it's a shame, and makes me drop a star out of this product, is the lack of extras, it would be great if it contained the full performances of the bits shown in the film, or at least a couple. (No Latin american spanish either)

Note: this is a bonus DVD on the Jimi hendrix anthology box set too, if you want to get that, I wouldn't recommend the box for casual fans, it's just for completist. so you're better off getting this film separately.

Must have for any hendrix fan, that's for sure.",1359676800,9,1249,4.441048034934497
