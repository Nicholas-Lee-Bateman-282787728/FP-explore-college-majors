5463271,1,B00AOCDE2A,"Somewhere in JACOB there's a plot waiting to be discovered.  There's a suggestion of some kind of cult or supernatural involvement as the basis for the catalyst that plunges the Kell family into their tragic fate which is never explored or explained.  Basically, the entire script is disjointed, silly and incredulous.  Not to mention the really bad acting.  Dylan Horne as Jacob is more silly than frightening.  Writer/director Larry Carrell plays two roles as the deputy and the abusive husband is simply terrible, but the actor playing the sheriff in 1979 is really really awful.  And what was Michael Biehn thinking???  Nrw agent, Michael---soon!!!  Only little Grace Powell as little Sissy shows any talent.  The gory scenes are over the top and poorly staged.
In summary, JACOB has nothing to recommend so caveat emptor - ""Buyer beware!""",1366675200,2,843,5.094890510948905
5463272,3,B00AOCDE2A,"Beware: spoilers!  Jacob isn't exactly a good film but it gets points for being highly idiosyncratic.  It reminded me of the 1970's when some filmmaker would come out of nowhere to make a weird horror flick for the drive-in circuit and then never be heard from again.  What Jacob lacks in slickness it more than makes up for in personality, which makes it a much more interesting watch than most indie horror movies that go straight to video and which are made by people with film school educations and technical skills but no actual ideas.  Jacob concerns a dysfunctional family in late 1970's Texas--an abused waitress, her violent, alcoholic boyfriend and her two children--a sweet little girl and her towering, speechless older brother.  There are also weird flashbacks involving the siblings biological father who discovers an Evil Dead style book under the floorboards of a house he has inherited.  This particular element lets you know you're watching a horror movie, although it's never really smoothly integrated into the rest of the movie.  Jacob doesn't actually seem like it even is a horror movie until well into the second half.  When Otis the drunk kills the little girl in a fit of violent rage Jacob rips him limb from limb--literally, then goes on a killing spree.  The townspeople send a lynch-mob after Jacob but the would be vigilantes keep ending up dead themselves instead.  The murders are gruesome but more Monty Python or early Peter Jackson than Saw--it's likely viewers will be more amused than disturbed by the carnage.  The movie doesn't build to much dramatically although there is a pretty funny punchline at the end that seems to come from nowhere.  Jacob is worth the price of a rental, if not necessarily something you will want to add to your collection.",1366675200,,1790,4.910299003322259
5463273,5,B00AOCDE2A,Great horror flick!  Kept me on the edge of my seat!  A must-watch!  I saw this at a private screening and I'm excited to be able to watch it again on DVD!,1366156800,4,155,3.78125
5463274,5,B00AOCDE2A,A delightful B-Slasher flick to watch with your friends. It's stuffed with over the top violence and camp every step of the way.,1366070400,4,128,4.608695652173913
8555336,2,B00AOCDE2A,"This film had potential -- but, in the end, the bad acting is too distracting. Not all the acting is bad. The little girl Sissy (Grace Powel) is an excellent natural actress. I'm sure we will be seeing more from her in the future. She was the best actor in this film, and she's only maybe 10-12 yrs old. She is a good actress by any standards.

The second major flaw in the film is the fact that the director forgot to present a clear plot. I'm sure it was in his head, but we don't see it on the screen (where it counts).  The supernatural aspect is only hinted at, not delved into. There is a supposed haunted house, where a mysterious book is found by Jacob's father. The director uses a shorthand means to suggest that the father is possessed by this book. Yes, it is very ""iffy"" and not well-done. We simply see the father rapidly reading the book, painting the house red (he inherited the house), reading the book, painting, etc. That's it. Then he walks into the local cafe and erupts into violence, killing a bunch of people. No explanation given. Then Jacob is mysteriously drawn to the old spooky house (no reason given.) So, aside from the bad acting, this major plot flaw renders the film inconsequential.  Too bad, since the photography and film score are pretty good. The special effects/gore effects are pretty good.  There is simply no linkage between the actions and the supernatural element --- which is supposed to be the core of the film. What happened to the main plot point?

The worst acting from a major character comes from Jacob's mother Edith (Krystn Caldwell). Contrast her vocal inflections with those of the little girl. One is totally play-acting, the other is totally ""in the moment"" acting. Larry Wade Carrell, the director, plays two major parts -- Otis and deputy Bill. He is an OK actor at times. But Otis is played way over the top as a white trash redneck, and Bill is played a bit too goofily as a dopey sheriff sometimes. This character should have been played more seriously. The makeup and editing are good enough so that I was not aware that these two characters were being played by the same actor, until the credits rolled. The Creepy Old Lady (Karen Schlag) is another big failure in this film. This is the worst acting in the film-- totally over the top. She is sort of like ""The Cryptkeeper"" puppet in the Tales From The Crypt TV show. How could the director have allowed this? That's a mystery. And, we have no idea why she is in the film. There is no linkage between this Creepy Old Lady and the action that takes place. But, at the end of the film, she has that mysterious book.  I have no idea what was in the director's mind here. Your guess is as good as mine. Another special merit for bad acting has to go to the cafe owner with the ponytail. Really bad.

There are a lot of ""extra"" behind the scene features on the DVD. These are worth watching. The director is effusively proud of his film and everything about it.  But, it makes you wonder all the more how the director picked these actors and how he thought the film translated his vision properly to the screen.  The dvd is a good film educational experience, to see the mixture of good and bad acting. It is obvious how the actors differ widely in their abilities.",1430352000,,3276,4.455759599332221
8555337,5,B00AOCDE2A,"Any film which quotes Jim Croce in the script will at least receive a modicum of my attention. A true Seventies-flavored, B horror flick, replete with handlebar moustaches, vintage '60s/'70s era automobiles, and wooden acting...the stuff cult films are made of. Take the Swanson tv dinner out of the freezer ( Apple Cobbler a must ), dig out the Jiffy Pop popcorn, and enjoy the trip.",1430092800,,384,4.833333333333333

8555340,4,B00AOCDE2A,"I have watched this movie at least 10 times now & it gets better every time I watch it.  I love Larry Wade Carrell as Otis/Billy and Grace Powell as Sissy was fantastic.  watch for that little girl to become a star!  Dylan Horne as Jacob is both sweet & creepy and Michael Biehn was the icing on the cake. If you are true horror fan, don't miss this one",1376006400,,353,4.014285714285714
8555341,5,B00AOCDE2A,"The movie is a little creepy, however, a couple of the starring actors were in town (Larry Carrel) and (Michael Biehn, Johnny Ringo in Tombstone).  The little extra that came our way was that Michael Biehn, the star  actor that portrayed ""Johnny Ringo"" in the movie Tombstone and Larry Carrel who starred in this movie (Jacob) were in town shooting another film.  Me and some of my staff were privileged to assist (In a very small way) with the new production.  Meeting Mr. Biehn and Larry Carrel was very nice.  They are both class acts and showed a lot of respect for our town and those involved in the shoot.  Getting a signed copies of Tombstone by Johnny Ringo and Mr. Carrel, just made it a little more special to watch these days.",1373500800,,737,4.503759398496241
8555342,4,B00AOCDE2A,Very good movie but strange.  I still am not sure what the voices were about or the secret book or figurine in the floor.  And why did the old lady have it?  Kind of confusing... but the movie itself was pretty good.,1372204800,,216,4.095238095238095

8555345,3,B00AOCDE2A,"Otis (Larry Wade Carrell) is the town drunk. He is not the likeable Otis from Mayberry, but one that abuses his overly dependent punching bag girlfriend and waitress Edith (Krystn Caldwell). Edith has two children. Sissy (Grace Powell) is the wiser and younger of the two. Jacob (Dylan Horne) is the mentally challenged Tor Johnson looking guy. He is not a very nice person either and he has a wonderful head twitch.

This all sets up for a darling of a slasher film. However 30 minutes into the film, there is a scene that makes you go ""huh?"" It is an interesting scene, one that has the potential to change the direction of the film and make it something you didn't expect. Unfortunately this aspect was never developed to its potential, as it appears writer/director Larry Wade Carrell did not know what to do with this ""twist"" once he introduced it, which is sad.

The acting was not top notch, along with some of the dialouge, it was a shade campy. This made the film lighter and more palatable than a straight slasher. There was plenty of blood, but the gore special effects were minimized as much of the bloodfest takes place just out of the camera's eye.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1367539200,,1205,4.595348837209302
