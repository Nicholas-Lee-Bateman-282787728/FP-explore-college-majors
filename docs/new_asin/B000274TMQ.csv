2064554,5,B000274TMQ,"I didn't catch these when they were on television.  I just bought these DVD's,elsewhere.  So, I was looking on Amazon to see if there were more seasons.  I am so disappointed that there aren't. They actually talk about going to church on this show! It was a terrific family show. There's very little on TV nowadays that you can say that about. My family and I have watched this season over and over and over again.  I wish there were more.",1154044800,4,439,4.382716049382716
2064555,4,B000274TMQ,"I missed this show while it was on the air; but looking back ten years later it doesn't seem to be that dated.  One may argue that Foxworthy is a comedian, not an actor - his acting here is convincing, but let's face it, he's playing himself.  This is certainly not a flop on the level of Madonna's multiple embarrassments after ""playing herself"" in ""Desperately Seeking Susan!"" - Foxworthy is likeable on the screen, and doesn't stoop to offensive stereotypes to bring his message across.  (Stereotypes perhaps, but NOT offensive.)

Watching the first season in order, one realizes that the show was trying to fix something and make it better.  Since I have not seen the second season, I don't know if they did.  (Will it ever be released?) But I was riveted to the screen for several nights, and enjoyed the show immensely.

Haley Joel Osment virtually steals every scene he's in, and perhaps this show will be of interest to film historians in the future BECAUSE of Osment.

If this show didn't live up to expectations, I don't think Foxworthy's career has suffered from this one iota.  I really enjoyed watching these, but probably enjoyed them so much because I paid $5.50 at Wal*Mart.

And Foxworthy's career continues just fine, thank you, with the Blue Collar Comedy Tour.

(God, can you imagine Larry the Cable Guy in a sitcom?  Wouldn't last as long as ""The Book of Daniel""!)",1145750400,,1385,4.725
2064556,5,B000274TMQ,ive never watched this show so im not gonna review on if its good or not i just wanted to let people know that it was in my walmart in the $5.50 bin so before you buy it here for 25 check your walmarts cheap dvd bin you may get lucky.,1134172800,5,234,3.607843137254902
2064557,5,B000274TMQ,"We just rented these discs from NetFlix and now I'm shopping around to purchase them; that's how much we enjoyed them!  It seems like most people either found this series average or below, and I can't understand why.  Maybe it's my own warped sense of humor (which my husband shares), but we totally enjoyed all the episodes, especially after brother Wayne joins the cast.  We are middle-aged people and maybe this style of humor is best suited for that age group.  Anyway, I give it a Big 5 Stars and will continue to enjoy the belly laughs Jeff Foxworthy can be counted on to provide.",1127952000,8,586,4.552380952380952

2064559,4,B000274TMQ,"I liked this season alright, but the only complaint I had was that Jay Mohr played a irritating character.  I don't think it has to do with him.  I just think the character was irritating.

But what I really would like if they released the second season on DVD when they lived in the south.  And Bill Engvall, I'm a huge fan of him.  When Bill and Jeff are together expect hilarity.  The first season was okay, but I would really love to see the second season released.",1106092800,13,469,4.2727272727272725
2064560,3,B000274TMQ,"Jeff is very funny and is carrying the whole show. The characters Walt and Russ were funny and added a little bit spice to it. I don't understand why they let those guys go, because the show got bad (and my rating dropped then big time) when they replaced them with the sister and the brother. Especially the brother is not funny but annoying and the sister is quite boring. Wrong decission for the fans and the show. From then on thumbs down ... sorry",1100822400,2,452,4.329411764705882
2064561,5,B000274TMQ,"Every great show on DVD gets a bad review from some one: Cheers, Cosby Show, etc. But everyone loves those shows and are pointless to talk smack about. The Jeff Foxworthy Show is a riot, it is one of the funniest shows I have ever seen. It even introduced Haley Joel Osment(The Sixth Sense, Secondhand Lions). Jeff Foxworthy is the most under rated entertainer in the history of history. Hollywood has a formula and that formula is an average American family living anywhere besides the south. But what Hollywood is too stupid to realize is HALF OF AMERICA LIVES IN THE SOUTH! How about a new formula Hollywood! So check this one out it is a real treat that got cancelled early because of Hollywood! So chant with me ""Hollywood is a big fat ******* pig with ******* no *****!
  Love,

2064581,5,B000274TMQ,Jeff Foxworthy never disappoints!  Sometimes too close to home but always a good and guaranteed clean family oriented comedy routine!,1357430400,,133,5.65
2064582,5,B000274TMQ,Funny show.  Does have a lot of redneck jokes I've heard before but that's cause I enjoy Jeff Foxworthy.  Good wholesome family show.  Not many of those anymore.,1351814400,,161,4.678571428571429
2064583,4,B000274TMQ,"Was there too much of Jeff Foxworthy's standup(word for word!) in the show? Yes. Was the rest of the dialogue incredibly simple? Of course, we're dealing with Rednecks here. Was the acting terrible? Yeah, some of the time. Despite that, I really enjoyed the first season of The Jeff Foxworthy Show.

It was funny, there was heart and I was satisfied with just about every episode. Plus, how awesome was the really young Haley Joel Osment? For the price point you can get the show at($4.99-9.99) how can you go wrong?",1323734400,,516,4.670329670329671
2064584,4,B000274TMQ,"The Jeff Foxworthy Show is a wholesome family oriented sitcom. Not full of foul language,nudity or sexual references. The Jeff Foxworthy Show is a good viewing option for the entire family reguardless of age(child thru adulthood) Also check out the Bill Engvall Show",1262044800,,266,5.209302325581396
2064585,5,B000274TMQ,I think this show is hilarious. Haley Joel Osment does such an amazing job for such a young actor! I don't know why everyone thinks this show is terrible. I guess maybe I just have the right sense of humor for this series.,1253664000,,222,4.186046511627907
2064586,4,B000274TMQ,"Jeff Fx is an engaging funny man who assumes nothing and delivers a a great product. The sitcom needs our support the ""reality show"" dodo is so PHONY it nausiates the audience. It assumes that you the viewer is an idiot because you watch their CONTRIVED CRAP.

The wife in the show is a future star actress.",1243814400,,307,4.385964912280702
2064587,4,B000274TMQ,"The Jeff Foxworthy Show is one of my favorite shows from the 90's I remember being a kid and watching it. I love the first 12 episodes, with Matt Clark. I thought Walt and Russ were funny characters and Matt Clark just seemed to add more to the show. I wish they would've gotten a better send off or maybe came back for the second season or something. I love the episodewhen Russ tells Walt he has bad breath and Walt acts like his feelings were hurt but then he just says ""Live with it"" that was just really funny!!!",1239148800,,517,4.18
2064588,4,B000274TMQ,I  LIKE  THIS  SHOW  ITS  NICE  FAMILY  COMEDY  NOT  LIKE  THE  CRAP  THAT  IS  ON  TELEVISION  THESE  DAYS  I  WOULD  VERY  MUCH  LIKE  TO  SEE  SEASON  2  COME  OUT  I  THINK  IT  IS  BETTER  THAN  SEASON  1  MUCH  FUNNIER,1227052800,,224,3.7948717948717947
2064589,5,B000274TMQ,"I had only seen a few episodes of ""The Jeff Foxworthy Show"" on television because they don't come on tv much at all and when they had a sell at Walmart for only $5.50 for the whole set, I had to pick it up. The few episodes that I saw were great so I thought why not, for $5.50!!! I have to say that I wouldn't mind paying $20 for this set after watching it because this set is so good and is funny too! This is a great family show and I have been waiting for season 2 to come out because I can't wait for the new baby to arrive and to see what us going to happen.",1174694400,2,564,3.7083333333333335
2064590,4,B000274TMQ,I liked the episodes before Mohr Arrived. Simple and to the point. Matt Clark was a big plus to the show in my opinion. After the release of clark and the addition of Mohr the show lost focus. I hope that Season two will warrant a release. Bill Engvall and Jeff Foxworthy togethor Great!,1172361600,,287,4.333333333333333

8023096,3,B000274TMQ,This was a good show UNTIL Jay Mohr showed up and ruined it. Way over the top and totally annoying. Every show has at least one character who  brings the show down whenever they show up. WHY is that?,1438387200,,199,4.102564102564102
8023097,5,B000274TMQ,very good show,1419897600,,14,4.0
8023098,5,B000274TMQ,I didn't realize that Jeff Foxworthy had a television series. It is very good! It supports both the family life and the redneck side. My family really enjoys it! Definitely worth the money! :),1393459200,,192,4.676470588235294
8023099,5,B000274TMQ,I can't believe I missed this one when it was on television. Easily worth the five or six bucks I payed for it!,1392249600,,111,3.869565217391304
8023100,5,B000274TMQ,I bought this for my husband. He watched the whole thing episode after episode. It was good to watch something I hadn't seen in years. It was an incredible price also. Goofy series but sometimes it's needed.,1379203200,,207,4.621621621621622

8023102,4,B000274TMQ,"I think Jeff Foxworthy is hilarious so I bought this one site unseen since it originally aired way back in the 90s. It is cute and I will watch it every couple of years. But it is funny that what you loved 10+ years ago has not stood up to time. I don't know what makes a show a classic but this one won't ever be that. It is funny, but if you can stream it for free somewhere, do that! It was cute seeing a little Haley Joel Osment as the son. He was precious in this series!",1366502400,,476,3.8181818181818183
