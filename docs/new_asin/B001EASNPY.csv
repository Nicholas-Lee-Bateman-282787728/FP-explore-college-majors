3547634,5,B001EASNPY,"As a fan of the original Miracle on 34th Street, I worried a bit about how much I would like this version. It does not disappoint. The story is different, yet familliar to the original. The writers made it fresh, yet maintained much of the sweetness and sentiment of the 1947 version. Mara Wilson is adorable, yet precocious as Susan. Richard Attenborough is perfect as St. Nick. The rest of the cast from Dylan McDermott as Santa's lawyer, to Elizabeth Perkins as Dorrie (Susan's mom) were also well cast. The only part I think is a bit over the top is the former ""Cole's"" (not Macy's) Santa. He gets a bit crude at times. The other ""bad guys"" are pretty harmless, just grouchy and conniving. Honestly, this is one of the Christmas movies I look forward to watching each year. Great for the whole family.",1326412800,3,805,4.558620689655172

8297256,4,B001EASNPY,"This is one movie that is actually more entertaining and heartwarming than the original...and that's saying something. The choice of characters and the performances they give, from Richard Attenborough as Santa, Elizabeth Perkins as the doubting mother and the delightfully cute and precocious Mara Wilson, are heartwarming and bring back fond rembrances of simpler times. The antagonists from the rival separtment store are a little over the top, but thankfully limited in their exposure. JT Walsh delivers a believeable portrayal of the Prosecutor and the acceptably endearing performance from Robert Prosky as Judge Harper who is caught between his grandson and a hard place rounds out this delightful christmas - again - classic.",1329782400,,733,5.495575221238938
