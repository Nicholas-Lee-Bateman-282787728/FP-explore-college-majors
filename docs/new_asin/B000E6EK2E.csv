8106392,5,B000E6EK2E,I love Friends.  I got this as a birthday gift for a friend who also loves the show.  Big hit!,1271548800,,94,3.65
8106393,4,B000E6EK2E,"If you have the cash, and need frequent doses of ""Friends"", then by all means, buy the entire series (the gags reels are great!).  But for me, I don't want or need all 10 seasons, so these little compilations are great.  For just a few bucks, I can have my occasional ""Friends"" fix.  For $4, this would be worth it if it just had Phoebe's and Rachel's deliveries - classic!",1197504000,,373,4.3
8106394,4,B000E6EK2E,"Friends is one of the best sitcom shows out there. and if you're like me and you don't really want to buy all 10 seasons, then this collection (including the two dvds with all the Birthdays and Weddings) is a good choice. It showcases some of the memorable moments of the series and this dvd has a lot of goodies. The only downside to this dvd is that a few episodes end with a cliffhanger.

  The dvd contains Phoebe giving birth to triplets, the birth of Ross' son, the birth of Ross' and Rachel's daughter, the one where chandler and joey leave ross' son on the bus, and the one where the male nanny (guest-starring Freddie Prinze Jr.) takes care of rachel's daughter. Some people are saddened because the birth of Chandler's and Monica's babies isn't in here, but you could get that in the series finale dvd (which is worth it). I recommend buying this dvd if you just like to watch a few memorable moments of the series and don't really want to pay for all the seasons. Plus, this dvd is a good way to introduce newbies to the show, if any. =)",1178928000,4,1048,4.336734693877551
8106395,3,B000E6EK2E,"Ok, I give this a 3 becaues I love Friends...I have all 10 seasons, so no reason to buy this and also no bias.

Read the episodes that are on it....if you're familiar with all the episodes, you'll notice that 2 babies are missing...Monica and Chandler's twins!!!!!  It's not ALL the babies if they don't include the finale!

I agree with some other reviews I've seen.  You're better off buying all the seasons individually.  That way you get the bonus features also...the gag reels are pretty funny.",1162080000,3,499,4.689655172413793
