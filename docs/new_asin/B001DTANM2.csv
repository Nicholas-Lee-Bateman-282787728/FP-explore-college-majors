8294799,4,B001DTANM2,"If you want a history slanted toward minorities, women and French Canada this is it. Also, about every 30 minutes the announcer says that Politician So-and-So thinks Canada is about to be invaded by the US. Of course, the US has never invaded Canada. There was no Canada until 1867, well past the colonists incursions in the French & Indian War and The American Revolution. During the War of 1812 (when indeed there was a US) Americans did invade Canada but to attack the British.

I found a few things very interesting:

1) French Canada wasn't keen on defending Canada in either World War One or World War Two, despite the fact that it was France that was getting the worst of it. The English speaking  part of Canada enlisted at a 45/50% rate vs. 25% for French Canada.

2) David Thompson, the Canadian explorer, is the most forgotten and under-rated man I think I have ever encountered. The part about him is fascinating.

3) During World War II the Dieppe raid was about as stupid a military adventure as one can imagine and Canada suffered terribly.

4) The ship explosion in Halifax, Nova Scotia harbor during WW I was the largest man made explosion until the Hiroshima atomic bomb. Much of Halifax looked liked Hiroshima.

5) Americans think of Canada as an escape hatch at various times, but Canadians on the run from the law made it across the border the other way with some frequency.

6) I go to Alberta a lot as I live in Montana, It is interesting that all of Southern Alberta was owned by the Hudson Bay Company until 1873. The Brits refused $10 million from the US for the Hudson bay Company or western Canada today would be part of the US.

If you ignore the Left wing slant the series gives a good overview of Canada's history.",1396569600,3,1745,4.514285714285714
8294800,4,B001DTANM2,"I borrowed this set of DVD from my local library. It contains of 18 DVDs with 19 episodes.

The GOOD

- It covers Canada`s history from 15,000 BC to 1990.

- According to a statement by the producer displayed at the beginning of disc 1, all the events, people and what they said in this series are true.

- The picture clear and beautiful.

The NOT SO GOOD

- It has NO SUBTITLE. This is a big problem for people whose English is their second language.  Even for people with English is their native language, they still have problem with spelling the name of a town, a historical person or a battlefield.

- Disc 8 with the title `Season 1, episode 10` should be integrated with disc 7. It`s because it`s just a filler with 2 minutes of a video clip, a link to CBC website and the photos of 3 video releases by CBC. The video clip is about the excavation in 1992 in Edmonton city. They found the remains of a trading post built by Hudson`s Bay company almost 160 years ago and some 5000 years old tools.

- Disc 17 and 18 with the titles `Season 2, episode 18`and `Season 2, episode 19` respectively should be combined into one.  Disc 17 contains a 26-minute video clip. Its title is `Return to Ortona, a small Italian town`. Disc 18 contains a 22-minute video clip. Its title is ``The railway and standardized time`.

In short, it`s a must for anybody who wants to know Canada`s history. It`s an excellent supplement to a history book.",1330560000,,1436,4.381132075471698
