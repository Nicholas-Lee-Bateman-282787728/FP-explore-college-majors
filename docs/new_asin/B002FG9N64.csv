3921783,1,B002FG9N64,The Bount is by far the worst Arc of Bleach to date. Skip this one. Come back when they finally start going into Hueco Mundo,1253318400,3,124,4.0
3921784,1,B002FG9N64,"In the info for this item it says that it is only one disk and 125 minutes.

3921785,2,B002FG9N64,Apparently this 'box' set will have just one disk according to amazons info. At least that's what it says when i wrote this. How is a season going to fit on one disc?

3921786,3,B002FG9N64,"According to Merriam-Webster, filler is ""a substance added to a product (as to increase bulk, weight, viscosity, opacity, or strength).""

Well, it's not a precise description, but it does explain the function of anime filler: episodes not based on the manga it springs from. And ""Bleach Uncut Box Set: Season 4, Part 1 - The Bount"" anime begins an entire arc not based on Tite Kubo's manga, although it still manages to be pretty suspenseful, funny and action-packed.

The day after the gang's return to the living world, Orihime is suddenly sucked into a vast replica of the Hell Gate, by a doppelganger of her brother. Her kidnappers are the mysterious Ririn, Kuroudo and Noba -- and they quickly lure Ichigo, Uryu, Chad and Renji on a series of bizarre games. First it's a chase around town, then a surreal maze in the local museum. Finally, they're brought back to school, where they must uncover who the imposter among them is... or everyone will vanish.

It turns out that these three weirdos are all working for an old friend, to prepare Ichigo and Co. (plus Rukia and Renji) for a massive fight against the immortal soul-sucking Bounts. The Bounts have recently started consuming living human souls, and for some reason they are also allied with a rogue Soul Reaper named Maki Ichinose. What's more, their cruel leader Jin Kariya wants to get his hands on Uryu, for a secret plan to do... something.

Filler episodes in anime are usually pretty bad -- at the very least, they bend the characters into doing and saying odd things. For the most part, ""Bleach Season 4 Part 1"" avoids that tendency -- there's still plenty of weird individual powers, sword fights and bloody action, as well as duels between floating fire creatures, snakes, living waterspouts, metal spiders and little flying eyeballs with teeth. The Bounts, they have some mean powers.

But the story is hampered by an over-reliance on flashbacks (is this ""Bleach"" or ""Lost""?), and the story sometimes slows to a crawl. The dialogue is still plenty of fun (""You guys are checking each other out!"") and there's plenty of comic relief (Ichigo trying to find a toy that satisfies Ririn). And the writers spin up some intriguing backstory for the treacherous Maki Ichinose and the Bounts -- they're not very scary or imposing compared to Hollows or Aizen, but they'll do for a filler arc.

Ichigo and his amazing abs (you could grate cheese on them!) make a good return in this arc, but he seems to have lost some key brain cells -- he's a smart guy, yet he doesn't know that blowing up a fire extinguisher and leaping down an elevator shaft might not be a good idea? Still, our orange-haired hero remains a likable protagonist who emanates hardcore determination to protect his buddies.

Uryu is explored in detail, struggling with his recent loss of powers, and the knowledge that he is now a burden and a danger to his superpowered friends. And the writers do a good job with the supporting characters -- Chad, feisty Renji, strong-willed Rukia and quirky Orihime (""I remember there was tea!""). The Bounts aren't really explored much yet, but the three mod-souls are fun characters: Ririn is a rather shrill little bird-girl, Kuroudo a flamboyant bunny purse (yes, Rukia DOES love him), and Noba is a little ninja turtle who is almost as quiet as Chad.

""Bleach Uncut Box Set: Season 4, Part 1"" provides a pretty solid introduction to ""Bleach's"" first filler arc, and despite some flaws, it's still pretty fun to watch. Just be prepared to fast-forward sometimes.",1251676800,36,3534,4.810543657331137

3921808,3,B002FG9N64,"Season 4 of Bleach contains a story arc featuring a new group of enemies called Bounts. They are something akin to vampires. This season offers a few episodes to conclude the previous story, but the rest is unrelated. The Bounts are not very cool. Most of them have really stupid powers, and aren't interesting characters. I had this part when it came out. I later decided to get rid of it to free up movie space on my ever shrinking wall. If you must have all of Bleach to be able to sleep at night go ahead and get it. IF you don't want to be bored and get discouraged with this series, then skip this season. When they were releasing Bleach on DVD I bought each individual release. It was really annoying. This boring story arc took nearly 2 years to release. Many people were turned off of this amazing series just b/c season 4 was so bad. If you want to see quality Bleach do not watch season 4. You can pick right up at the season 6 and not feel like you missed anything.",1351468800,4,977,4.229946524064171
3921809,4,B002FG9N64,"The Bleach anime series is full of rich story lines, well-developed characters, and beautiful art. Most of what makes it wonderful, though, is the original material from manga author Tite Kubo. Seasons 4 and 5 of the anime, though, were filler material on which Kubo only had some design influence. If you're not already a fan, I recommend watching a couple of these episodes on a streaming service before purchasing the DVDs to see how you feel about the Bount characters and overall feel of the story. Some people really like it, but I personally lost interest in the arc about halfway through. I found it not as engaging as Kubo's original storyline. If you're not a big fan of this story arc, you could skip straight past Season 5 without missing much (except for the introduction of the three new mod souls, who are also anime-only content).",1348617600,,846,4.722972972972973
3921810,3,B002FG9N64,"Bleach is one of my favorite anime of all time, though that list is a long one let me tell you.
Anyway the animation was fantastic as usual, the music wasn't as great as usual but still good, and the characters still grow and change in both informative and humorous ways. However I found the plot in this season a bit lacking and to be blunt got bored with part it way through. I liked the focus being on Ishida for once and liked seeing more of him, but past that I think that while the writers had a good idea here it lacked any kind of real feeling.

The most disappointing thing about this 'season' however is the fact that it was cut in two the way it was. Honestly Funimation what were you thinking with this???
Everything on Amazon's end was spectacular as always and I received my anime in record time without any damage whatsoever.

In regards to the anime: good but not great",1318032000,,885,4.293413173652695
3921811,2,B002FG9N64,"Okay, so if you're a Bleach fan and have been watching since the first season, expect some disappointment (if not a LOT).  The 3rd season was full of excitement, good plot twists, amazing fights etc. To finish the 3rd with a certain feeling of quality, and then to start this season has been difficult for me.

 The annoying entry of new characters and very boring feeling the episodes have been barely keeping my attention, but I stick through it because I don't want to miss anything important. The story seems to be filled with so many, well, filler episodes. the second disc is when you get the first actual fight in the season, and that seemed to be poorly illustrated (does the whole season seem of lesser quality visually?).

 Another fault is that this season is split in to two parts, which you have to buy both individually. Cmon' now... Safe to say I'm blowing through this season (fast forwarding when needed) to get to season 5.

I could go on for a bit about the negative, but on the good side it is still entertaining. I mean, it's Bleach, right?",1316217600,,1061,4.528795811518324
3921812,3,B002FG9N64,"Bleach: The Bount Season Four Part One box set is a four disc set that contains sixteen episodes.  All four discs contain four episodes and bonus features.

On the first disc, there are four extras.  The first extra is ""Production Art,"" which is fourteen pages of line art of the characters and locations that appear on the disc.  The second feature is ""Manga Preview,"" which includes four pages of advertisements for the Bleach manga, as well as other titles released by Shonen Jump.  The next feature is ""Clean Ending,"" which is a textless version of the first closing theme that appears in this box set.  The final extra on the disc is labeled as ""Sneak Peak,"" which contains trailers for Naruto Shippuden, Bleach the Movie: Memories of Nobody, and the Bleach: Dark Souls video game.

The second disc has production art, which is twelve pages of line art of the characters and locations that appear on the disc.  The ""Manga Preview"" and ""Clean Ending"" are the exact same features that appear on the first disc.  The ""Sneak Peeks"" are also duplicated from the first disc.

The production art on disc three is fourteen pages of line art of the characters and locations that appear on the disc.  The ""Manga Preview,"" ""Clean Ending,"" and ""Sneak Peek"" are exactly the same as these items on the previous two discs in the set.

The first extra on the fourth disc is the ""Behind the Scenes of Bleach"" documentary.  This feature runs for approximately ten minutes, and includes interviews with the English dub actors for Lirin, Yoshino, and Ichinose.  The production art is twelve pages of line art of the characters and locations that appear on this disc.  The ""Manga Preview"" is still four pages on this disc, but one of the pages is different in comparison to the ""Manga Preview"" on the previous three discs in the set.  The ""Clean Ending"" is the textless version of the second closing theme that appears in this box set.  The ""Sneak Peek"" on this disc is exactly the same as the ""Sneak Peek"" on the previous three discs in the set.

While I expected the repetition of the bonus features from the previous three box sets, I found that Viz Media had taken the repetition to a new level.  Instead of including different trailers in the ""Sneak Peek"" extra for each disc, they just repeated the exact same set of trailers on each disc.  I still wish textless versions of the opening themes had been included as a bonus feature.  However, I have to give Viz Media credit for packaging the discs in individual slimline boxes.

I've heard it said that the episodes in this box set are ""filler"" episodes and aren't part of the main storyline arc from the manga.  Even though I was a bit disappointed by the bonus features, I did enjoy the actual episodes included in this box set.  These episodes well done for a ""filler"" story.

I would recommend this box set to anyone who is a fan of Bleach, especially since this is currently the only legal way to get these Bleach episodes in a DVD box set in the United States.

I wrote this review after watching a copy of this DVD box set that my husband gave to me as a gift.",1311638400,,3107,4.563176895306859
3921813,5,B002FG9N64,This is the first bleach filler arch in the series and besides the negative reviews from other customers i absolutly loved this box set and if you are planning on collecting the whole bleach series it would not be right to skip this season or you will have an incomplete collection. Bleach is my favorite show and it still does not fail to entertain me so you will not be disappointed in buying this box set.,1295740800,,408,4.381578947368421

3921815,5,B002FG9N64,"This is one of the side stories (filler) of the anime series Bleach. Though it is not in the main story, it is one of the best side stories in the series (I prefer the Zanpakutou Tales best). The bounts don't appear at the beginning: there is a part where Kisuke tests the individual powers of main characters (since they lost some of their powers when returning from Soul Society). However, that part is also funny and introduces the mod souls (which will have a lot of effect on the fight with the bounts).

Here are the episodes included with this set:
Disc 1: Episodes 64-67
Disc 2: Episodes 88-71
Disc 3: Episodes 72-75
Disc 4: Episodes 76-79

All of the disc also include the production art (which seems nice) and the last disc also includes a 'behind of scenes' which is basically an interview with the voice actors (for dubbing in English). Highly recommended for the people who love anime or the Bleach series. In addition, I don't think you can beat the price Amazon.com offers, so better buy it here!",1284681600,5,1011,4.549450549450549

So, if you dislike character development episodes, don't spend your money on this, save it for season 5 and have a gap in your collection. As for me, even though a solid story line is nice, and true to the original script, I'm happy I spent my money on this. Recommended.",1280620800,,562,4.311320754716981

But it's still Bleach.  You still get the awesome fight music (""If you want to see some action, you've got to be the center of attraction!"" hahaha, so lame, but great).  You still get the good fight scenes.

Things that bother me about it:  Ichigo is a weak, whinny little b***h in these episodes.  I know they explain that his spirit energy is less in the real world than in the Soul Society, but seriously, we are talking about a kid who attacked an entire civilization of soul reapers and he can't manage to defeat a few Bounts?  Bleh, the explanation didn't wash that feeling of disappointment away.

Really, that's it.  If you have made it this far in the series then you understand Bleach, and if you understand Bleach then surely you understand anime in general.  Ichigo will train for a fraction of the amount of time that everyone else in the world has to train and come out 10 times stronger!  Yes!  That's why I like anime.

They are wrong, dead wrong, to critize this addition to the series in any way. Bleach continues to be one of the finest animated series in any genre, with a full range of action, wit, character, and artistry in every aspect of its creation and production. I am not sure why some people are impatient with the whimsy and humor that is part of the series and the different nature of Japanese artistry and humour but that has always been part of the Occidental problem with seeing and accepting Oriental culture as being something totaly different and equally worthy to the Western approach.

There is nothing wrong with Bleach as it continues on its arc of story and I totally disagree that this is filler of any kind. It is part of the flow of the story, as it is evolving and if you stick with it, you will see the purpose of it all. I am way ahead of this in terms of watching the series but I won't spoil the surprises, just trust and buy this and enjoy it.

3921823,4,B002FG9N64,"Bleach Uncut Box Set:  Season 4, Part 1-The Bount features episodes starting from the end of the Season 3 of Bleach (The Rescue) which does not continue with the plotline set up at the end of that set.  That is too say that people who have followed the manga, have actually passed over these made for tv episodes, and already start off with the plotline of Aizen and such events. Needless to say, depending on how you feel about Bleach and the plot, then this boxset could be a make or break deal. If you have been following the sets then you are probably committed to getting them all over the course of the next few years (episode 79, the final episode on disc, is nearly 150+ episodes behind where the series is at now in Japan).  But basically if you like the anime then you probably may want to get this set as it is more episodes to the show.  If you like the manga then you will probably only watch this once to see what happens, but in the back of your head crave to see the events with Aizen (which unfortunately won't happen until they finally reach Bleach Season 5 on the DVD, in the Spring).

For the DVD offering it features, the usual that the discs include in terms of extras.  English and Japanese Audio, English subtitles, Production Art, Shonen Jump manga preview, sneak peek (updated now to include preview of VIZ Media's release of Naruto Shippuden, Bleach Movie 1 trailer, and Bleach Dark Souls trailer)), Clean Ending (no credits on the screen), and Behind the Scenes featuring more minor characters (well major characters in this season of Bleach, and we get to see the director again (Wendee!)  We should commend them on their great job of this behind the scenes feature).

In terms of the music, this set features two openings.  ""Ichirin no Hana"" by High and Mighty Color which continues off from the episodes of Bleach Season 3, and ""Tonight, Tonight, Tonight"" by Beat Crusaders"", both of which sound awesome.  For the ending it uses, ""My Pace"" by SunSet Swish and ""Hanabi"" by Ikimonogakari.  I feel that the series has excellent openings but the endings are always hit or miss.

Finally for the episodes, the set includes episodes 64 to 79.

One final thing to note about the set is that the manufacturer has chosen to now put each disc of the DVD in its own thinline DVD case and place that into a cardboard case containing all of them.  I like the old style better but it is alright since each slim case features a different characters portrait.  There were also no bonuses in this one like the others, that is no poster or postcards :(  .  The discs are blue to match the set.",1258329600,15,2606,4.487288135593221

8368962,4,B002FG9N64,"I bought bleach sason four part one box set. The description said very good. The discs were fine. However, the box had note worthy wear on it such as bent/worn corners and a crease in the spine if the box as well as lines indented into the cover. I would say it should have been listed as good condition and not very good. I spent three dollars extra to get the product in very good condition as opposed to good and I feel like I wasted my money. Overall an okay purchase just disappointed a little.",1438128000,,499,4.208333333333333
