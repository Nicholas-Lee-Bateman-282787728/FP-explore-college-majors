Well unlucky for her the boy who loves her sister is the rude and spolied (Elizabeth Taylor) well at  the end Jane and her realy boyfried get back together.
Great Movie. It's a shame they don't make'em like this anymore.",1063324800,16,648,4.0625
388553,5,6301967283,"A cluster of MGM stars are showcased in this song-filled comedy that keeps you chuckling from beginning to end.  Jane Powell is Judy Foster, who sings weekly on a local radio show sponsored by next door neighbor Elizabeth Taylor's father. Liz's younger brother, Oogie, is the leader of the band for the show and is also in charge of the music for the big school dance which everyone is preparing for.  He also has a crush on Judy.  But Judy and Liz both have a crush on local soda fountain adonis, Robert Stack.  Guess who wins?
In the meantime, Judy's learns that her father, Wallace Beery, is seeing Brazilian bomshell, Carmen Miranda, on the sly.  Not realizing that he is taking dancing lessons to surprise his wife, Judy manages to frustrate relationships in several different directions.
The whimsical plot is laced with several dazzling musical numbers.  Jane sings the up-beat ""It's A Most Unusual Day"", the radio show's theme song ""Judaline"", a mad-cap duet with Oogie ""I'm A Little On The Corney Side"" and the spirited ""Love Is Where You Find It.""  Carmen Miranda dazzles with ""Cuanta La Gusta"" and Xaviar Cugat and his orchestra wrap it all together with their beautiful Latin rhythms.
So, curl up in a comfortable chair and enjoy A Date With Judy.",972345600,8,1259,4.774193548387097

388602,5,6301967283,"A Date With Judy was one of those classic musicals that MGM was turning out seemingly effortlessly in the 40's and early 50's. In this case it was a smaller musical aimed at a young audience and not one of their mega-productions like Meet Me In St. Louis. Still, with all the skill and talent available at MGM they made a musical that was a notch above the usual.

Based on a radio show that had been popular since the early 40's, this starred Jane Powell, a young singer who was getting very big in films and recordings and who would soon be so popular with high school girls that she would even have a ""Dear Jane "" advice column aimed at them. The role of Judy Foster was simply made for her. The rest of the cast is full of surprises with enough disparate elements that it's a wonder it all held together.

For one thing, musicals aimed at the youth audience were usually swing musicals and needed a big band. This was especially true because Jane Powell had an operetta voice and often recorded the repertoire of Jeanette MacDonald, and was no swing singer by any means. So they brought in Xavier Cugat and his orchestra, as Latin rhythms were becoming increasingly popular by the late 40's. They went even further and brought in Carmen Miranda, who did not play herself (which would have been usual), but proved herself to be sweet and funny in the role of Rosita, the local dance teacher, and had her biggest hit with Cuando La Gusta.

Scotty Beckett, who had been in juvenile roles in MGM films as long as anybody could remember plays her bemused and confused boyfriend Ogden ""Oogie"" Pringle convincingly. Then there's his sister and Judy's best friend Carol, who is played by Elizabeth Taylor, whose presence is responsible for more interest in this little film than it would ordinarily have. MGM had noticed that she was maturing early into a very beautiful woman, and seemed to want the world to notice this too. This role and her role in Father of the Bride would be breakout roles for her in this respect. As Carol, she looks absolutely amazing and steals the spotlight in almost every scene she's in. However, MGM put so much makeup on her and dressed her in such fashionable clothes that she seems to be from some other movie altogether and not this little high school comedy. At best you'd think she was someone's college age sister.

Then there's Robert Stack. I've never figured out just what he's doing here as the love interest of both Judy and Carol, as he's more than ten years older than them. He plays the nephew of the owner of the local soda fountain who agrees to take Judy to the big dance as a favor to his uncle. Even then he resists taking ""a kid"" to a dance. Later, he seems to be falling for Carol, and has to tell her that maybe he'll see her ""in a few years"". All this seems rather awkward when all the studio had to do was use a younger actor. I imagine the studio was out to promote Stack and that's why he got the role.

The rest of the cast is a great bunch of old hands like Wallace Beery,Leon Ames, George Cleveland and Selena Royale. The hit song is It's a Most Unusual Day. Everyone works well together in this one, and it was a huge hit in its day and definitely worth checking out.",1426377600,,3225,4.404362416107382

388642,5,6301967283,"A Date with Judy is yet another entertaining MGM musical from the golden era of Hollywood! The plot moves along well and the acting is very convincing thanks to an excellent cast all directed so well by Richard Thorpe! The sets are detailed; the choreography is terrific and I really liked the cinematography. The musical numbers are also very well done and the background musical score is equally good.

When the action starts, we quickly meet the principle characters of the film: Judy Foster (Jane Powell), who is practicing to sing ""It's a Most Unusual Day"" for the high school dance. Judy's boyfriend Ogden ""Oogie"" Pringle (Scotty Beckett) is conducting the school orchestra; ""Oogie"" and Judy have been childhood sweethearts for some while already but of course things get complicated--""Oogie's"" sister Carol (Elizabeth Taylor), a rather catty, conniving beauty, wants to drive a wedge between Judy and ""Oogie"" so she makes ""Oogie"" think he's being too easy to get for Judy--and this results in Judy going to the dance with a slightly older Stephen I. Andrews (Robert Stack), the nephew of the owner of the local soda fountain shop, 'Pop' Sam Scully (Lloyd Corrigan).

And things get more complicated still! While ""Oogie"" hates to see Judy with another guy at the dance, Carol sets her sights on Stephen--she wants him for herself! She goes about trying everything she can do to get Stephen away from Judy; and we see what happens as the picture moves along.

And there's another plot, a subplot in a sense--Judy's mother and father (Melvin and Dora Foster played by Wallace Beery and Selena Royle) are about to celebrate their twentieth wedding anniversary! Melvin can't dance the rhumba which Dora loves to do especially when Xavier Cugat himself shows up at the high school dance! Secretly, Melvin decides to take rhumba lessons from professional Latin dancer Rosita Conchellas (Carmen Miranda) and this leads Judy to strongly suspect that her father is cheating on her mother!

There's more to the plot than just this and I've already left some details out so you can watch and enjoy this film as much as I did. Suffice it to say that the rest of the film show how all of the issues play out.

Look also for solid performances by Leon Ames as Lucien Pringle; Clinton Sundberg as Jameson; George Cleveland as Gramps; Jerry Hunter as Randolph Foster; Jean McLaren as Mitzi Hoffman and Lillian Yarbo in an uncredited role as Nightingale. In addition, the DVD comes with the theatrical trailer and two short films entitled Musical Merry-Go-Round #3 with Ray Noble and Buddy Clark and Tom and Jerry's Professor Tom.

A Date with Judy is an excellent film especially for the fans of the actors in it; people who appreciate classic movie musicals in general will not be disappointed, either.",1377302400,2,2793,4.906779661016949
388643,4,6301967283,"Undeniably adorable ingenue/singer Jane Powell flaunts her teenage stuff supported by Elizabeth Taylor, Robert Stack, Scott(y) Beckett, Wallace Beery, and Xavior Cugat in this thin on plot cinema outing. My best thought on the reason this movie was made was because MGM had all this talent under contract and wanted to utilize it. Powell was hitting it big with audiences, Taylor was transitioning from teen to voluptuous ingenue, Robert Stack was back on the home front, and the audiences were clamoring for light hearted fare.
Admittedly, I probably shouldn't be a sap for this film but I am. Powell's singing is infectious, Taylor segues from pretty to va voom, Cugat injects lounge lizard heat in his performances, and perenially grouchy Beery gives a nice performance as the cranky and misunderstood father who inadvertently lets his kids think he has more than learning how to dance to please his wife on his mind. The end result is a chaste comedy of errors that is a perfect post WWII piece of entertainment that doesn't try to get it's viewer to think as much as to be entertained on a very concious level.
No hoodwinking here; this is fun entertainment with very little message.
Still, I love it for its innocent humor and focus on family values and Jane Powell.",1375920000,6,1272,4.8663594470046085

Add to that the extreme exciting beauty of Elizabeth Taylor, the golden voice of Jane Powell, the sassiness of Carmen Miranda and the handsome looks of Robert Stack and this movie is a complete winner!  I'm not a person that loves many musicals but found myself tapping my foot or humming along the VERY merry tunes! :D Many old movies are great but in the uplifting and comedy category this one is tops.  Why would this not be in widescreen and blu-ray?  There are so many boring blu-ray movies yet a movie like this deserving restoration and being out in widescreen is ignored.

388697,3,6301967283,"After viewing this movie for the first time in over 40 years,I can safely say that it has not changed a bit. It's a very stale tale of life amongst the well to do kids and folks of the late 1940s.
The story concerns the story of two families the Pringles and the Fosters. The Pringles are father Lucien(Leon Ames),his daughter Carol(Elizabeth Taylor)and his son Ogden""Oogie""(Scotty Beckett-former Little Rascal).The Fosters are father Melvin(Wallace Beery),his wife(Selena Royle)and their daughter Judy(Jane Powell).The movie takes place in Santa Barbara a very urban and prospering town as the voice over tells us,in a very reassuring and calming tone. The voice over also tells us that the Pringle family is just a bit more prosperous financially than the Fosters but the Foster household makes up for this gap because Mr Foster makes more time for his family than does Mr Pringle. The movie continues with this overly civil/polite tone that(irritatingly)carries into every conversation whether it be between the teenagers,adults and/or both. It actually works against the film for try as one might one cannot seem to empathize with anyone in the piece as it is SO unrealistic. Judy is a singer(MGM trying to  make another Deanna Durbin!)with a local band led by her best friends' brother ""Oogie"" Foster. Both are around 16 and have been in love for a while now. But Judy keeps falling in and out of love with him more times than the front door opens and shuts. During an ""off"" time Judy ""falls"" for one tall and handsome Stephen Andrews(Robert Stack).But Stephen has his eyes on her friend Carol who he tells point blank she is spoiled and quite conceited(truth be told Carol AND Judy are both spoiled-but in a nice and polite way of course!).This doesn't sit well with Carol which allows Judy to try her luck with him...on and off. This see-saw continues throughout the film until Carol and Stephen and Judy and ""Oogie"" FINALLY come together...surprise!
When it all wraps 113 minutes later,one is thankful it's all over. The sub-plot of one father spending more time than the other established during the opening moments of the picture is barely touched on,and then well into the picture as if it was an after thought.
The ONLY light and spark in this film is Carmen Miranda. She unfortunately doesn't appear until about 40 minutes in and it is in one of about three or four brief scenes showing her teaching the Rhumba to Mr Foster(Carmen tries so hard but trying to play off a stiff like Beery was a losing proposition).Carmen gets a bit more film time when later she has to defend herself against Carol and Judy who think she's been fooling around with Mr Foster and still later she FINALLY gets to sing a couple of nice numbers,one being Cuanta La Gusta(sans The Andrew Sisters).Other than Carmen this film is a totally sanitized snooze-fest. Everyone is always ultra-polite and this wears thin after the first 20 minutes. These aren't your average families;they are upper middle class to upper class folks and they failed to create that quick spark of empathy and interest between characters and the audience right off the mark. The very important ""why should we care?"" question was not addressed;we are just told to care,which worked against the film and was its' downfall.
If I was to rate this film seperately I would give it only a two and half star rating. It's because of the following that I'm giving it three stars. First of all the print used here is beautiful in colour. It is very crisp and clean throughout and the opening shots of Santa Barbara(1947)look like they were filmed yesterday. Also along with the trailer is a 1948 Hanna-Barbera Tom and Jerry cartoon""Professor Tom"".Also,and more importantly,is a real time capsule of bigband music in a short called ""Musical Merry-Go-Round"".It is an excuse to showcase the bigband stars of the day hosted by Martin Block,one of the most influential DJs and a great friend/booster to bigbands,out of New York in the 30s and 40s. Here he introduces bandleader Ray Noble and singer Buddy Clark who showcase some of the music that made both of them famous while Block also sits and chats with them. Simply wonderful stuff.
If you are looking for a santitized,sqeaky clean,sickly sweet but awfully darn boring movie,then this one is for you. Except for a very innocent peck on Stephen's cheek by Judy....well,that's as ""bad"" as it gets! If you are a Carmen Miranda fan you also might want to see the latin beauty and talent strut her stuff. But other than that,I recommend you give this a WIDE pass.",1237334400,2,4561,4.847435897435897

388701,5,6301967283,"A delight for sure, ""A Date with Judy"" is one of the best coming of age films from the 1940's. With a great cast, infectious musical numbers, and just the right chemistry, you will get caught up in the life of the characters with this light hearted story.

 The story starts with Judy Foster (Jane Powell), her best friend Carol Pringle, and boyfriend Oogie Pringle, getting reading for and attending a highschool dance. Because of his busy schedule and encouragement from his sister, Oogie pushes Judy aside and sends one of his friends to take Judy to the dance. Furious, Judy walks to the corner drug store to call Oogie and tell him what she thinks of him. While she is there, she manages to gain comanionship of the drug store owner's much older nephew when he asks to be her date at the request of his uncle. And don't you know it, as soon as Carol Pringle (Liz Taylor) sees him, chemistry begins to build on between them though both girls think that they are in love with him. And through it all, Oogie despratly tries to win Judy back without much encouragement.

  In the midst of all this, Judy's father starts taking private lessons in his office with a rumba teacher (Carman Miranda) so that he can suprise his wife for there upcoming anniversary. This secrecy leads Judy and Carol to keep a close eye on the whole thing, thinking that Judy's dad is having an affair.

  In all the twists, turns, and misunderstandings, this movie greatly entertaining. The line delivery excellent, and the musical numbers fitting, it is exciting to see the confusing happenings of growing up.
  The one downside that this movie does have is the fact that it appeals to a more narrow age group of veiwers being a teen romantic comedy. But I honestly think that this is a great movie to add to your library, esecially if you like Jane Powell.",1210550400,3,1836,4.570121951219512

On top of it all, Judy suspects her father is cheating when she mistakes his dance teacher (Carmen Miranda) for his mistress.

This movie is strictly fun and nothing more, but with such a great cast, how could you complain? The girls are absolutely beautiful and obviously talented.

The quality was not what we have grown to expect. This was perhaps one notch up from our old video. And while it's not common, we have seen this done before with the occasional DVD that was ""home-brewed.""

That being said, the story itself still stands as a fun musical with great songs. By today's standard, this may be viewed as corny, but I think you have to keep in mind that this was a different era. To a certain extent, getting a new dress for the dance may have been a teenager's biggest dilemma back in the day. And to a certain extent, some issues are universal in any era- wanting to fit in and be accepted by peers. In the case of ""A Date With Judy,"" the bigger issue centers on boyfriend ""Oogie"" (played by Scotty Beckett) and maintaining acceptability with older friend ""Carol"" (played by Elizabeth Taylor.)

""A Date With Judy"" presents the typical story ""formula"" which at times can get a little silly, but the story is punctuated with some great lines and wonderful old songs including the Jimmy McHugh tune, ""It's a Most Unusual Day.""

And it's absolutely worth the price of admission to see Wallace Beery's character learn how to rhumba. He takes dance lessons from ""Miss Rosita,"" played by Carmen Miranda. And Xavier Cugat drops in as if this sort of thing happens every day.

388719,3,6301967283,"In ""A Date with Judy,"" Liz is fully the poor little rich girl, snobbish and out for trouble because her father's real attention is elsewhere, on making money...

Unhappy at home, she stirs up trouble abroad, giving naive Jane Powell bad advice on how to handle boys, and stealing one of Jane's boyfriends right out from under her twitching nose...

Very pre-Lolita, a Forties style teenaged sex kitten, this is the first version of the Taylor minx and she seems highly sophisticated for a small-town high school girl, even if she is rich...

""A Date with Judy"" is a pleasant musical, antiseptic and cheery, suggesting Hollywood's conception of high school Life in the Forties... Like ""Cynthia,"" the film is very class conscious, contrasting Taylor's cold, upper class household with Jane Powell's comfortable middle-class home...

Typically, Liz is rich, spoiled, and reserved, but typically, too, when all is said and done, she's not bad-mannered or troublesome one; she's a good kid who just needs a little love and attention...

Taylor's character finally allowed her to use the sexiness that everyone had sensed since she rode that horse in ""National Velvet.""",1166918400,4,1163,5.132275132275132

But there are a couple of things to recommend. Carmen Miranda sings a couple of numbers and plays a dance instructor. Xavier Cugat, like in the better previous Holiday in Mexico, comes to the high school to perform a number, as if. It kind of undermines what a famous musician he was. The most curious of all things in this movie is Elizabeth Taylor's number. Maybe the studio wasn't exactly sure about her appeal yet but she sings a song in this. She lipsyncs and it's generic but still that's surprising enough. But she was declared the prettiest girl in the movie so at least they were aware of something.",1066953600,14,875,4.544303797468355

Hot Toasty Rag, July 19, 2017

Remember when Shirley Temple became a teenager and she made a few awkward films about the generation gap before rock n roll kicked in? A Date with Judy reminds me of one of those movies.

In this one, Wallace Beery plays the out-of-touch father, and his daughter Jane Powell tries to teach him the errors of his ways. Powell sings Love is Where You Find It, a song that Kathryn Grayson also introduced in 1948s The Kissing Bandit; will we ever know who was truly the originator? To help teach her structured father, Powell enlists the help of Carmen Miranda and Xavier Cugat. They basically play themselves.

If you're not intimately familiar with the 1940s, the movie will seem incredibly dated. Its chalk-full of songs and dances, and a teenage romance between Elizabeth Taylor and Robert Stack, but it doesnt really stand the test of time very well.",1500422400,,910,4.675
