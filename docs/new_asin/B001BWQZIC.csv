8543968,5,B001BWQZIC,"Found this on Amazon (nowhere else). We host a gay film night once a month at our home and are always looking for something interesting. Took a chance on this and are VERY glad that we did. Articulate men and women sharing the experiences they had serving their country, and then being told that they weren't good enough due to their sexual orientation. Pretty straight forward(pardon the pun)in style, pretty much talking heads, but the stories are very important. Well worth the money and terrific viewing for groups.",1218240000,5,519,4.909090909090909
