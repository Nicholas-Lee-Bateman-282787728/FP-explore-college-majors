Atlantis Secret Star Mappers of a Lost World features a number of purported experts who claim the lost civilization of Atlantis has been discovered. There are people who appear in this documentary who claim that the citizens of Atlantis, who lived before the ice age, perfected astronomy, mathematics, and geography.

2828728,1,B000PY52G8,"One key in producing a documentary of this type is the delivery of the thesis in a professional/non-emotional manner along with organized supporting evidence.  Excessive gesticulating serves to distract the viewer from whatever the speaker is saying.  Wide-eyed speaking and leaning forward unnecessarily tend to cause an uneasy feeling, making me just want to get out of there before he pulls out a weapon and starts waving it around!  Couple these aspects with fuzzy/faulty math and you've got the gist of this show.

Of the 3 presenters used, only one presented his statements in a calm, believable manner; and, he was immediately drowned out by either the gesticulating guy or the wide-eyed chimpanzee in a suit, so I don't even remember what he had to say!

I've been a ""believer"" in both Atlantis and Lemuria for over 50 years.  This documentary did not provide any really new evidence of anything.  And it did it over and over.  This show could have been less than half it's length if all of the duplication were eliminated.

I hope they find their missing 8000 years.  I knew where it went all along, and then proved it by pulling out my calculator.",1468108800,,1157,4.797979797979798

I have been involved in the building trades all my life. I have done mostly commercial/ industrial jobs, in high rises etc. how they moved, cut and lifted these stones without modern equipment is astonishing. I think theres a lot more to the story than current history says i.e. older and larger submerged sites. as homo sapiens it's weird we have 200.000 years of presence but know only 5000 to 6000 years of it. the rest is lost",1462492800,2,676,4.836206896551724

2828758,5,B000PY52G8,"Atlantis was a real city with roots in the Biblical account of Genesis through Sidon, a descendant of Ham, the son of Noah.  Sidon is better known as ""Poseidon"" (or ""father"" Sidon)  who became deified as the ""god of the sea"" in ancient Greek mythology.  His son ""Atlas"" who was always seen lifting up the earth, measured and mapped the globe using the procession rate of the earth and an instrument known as an archometer  (or a celtic cross).  The archometer was found in the Great Pyramid of Giza and not known what its purpose was until recently.  This is a fascinating documentary parts of which make sense (such as the city of Atlantis being submerged as the waters rose at the end of the ice age).  Other parts are somewhat ""out there"" with some seed spitting required.  Overall a fascinating documentary!",1405209600,15,811,4.661971830985915

2828763,3,B000PY52G8,"This video offers some good historical information about the lost ""continent"" of Atlantis but basically states that as the ice age of 10,000 years ago ended, many of coastal towns along Spain and Morocco were submerged and lost. Atlantis was more a group of city states rather than a continent that were submerged by the rising Atlantic waters. The End.",1395273600,,353,4.9
2828764,3,B000PY52G8,"I enjoyed the show from a pure entertainment and ancient history standpoint, but there were many huge holes in the hypotheses presented by the scientists on the show. The most outlandish hypothesis presented was that the Atlanteans were a space-faring race whose symbols represented the swirls of the Milky Way galaxy. It seems to me that if the Atlanteans were an advanced space-faring race, we'd see evidence on the ground--they would have used resources that we'd notice as missing, old relics and ruins would be made of something other than stone, and rising waters at the end of the last ice age would have presented only a minor inconvenience (not to mention the lack of evidence of colonies on the moon and Mars).

The main evidence for the existence of Atlantis presented here seemed to be the fact that societies all over the world shaped bricks to fit against each other when building lasting structures. The scientists here seemed to ignore that if an ancient culture is stacking rocks for a structure that is meant to last, one really needs to make sure the rocks or bricks fit well together. If they don't, the building falls down.

This seems like a basic concept that any stone building would need to follow, so in order for this to be compelling, these scientists would need to show alternative methods of constructing buildings that last thousands of years where the rocks do not fit well together. Ideally this should also be done with technology available to primitive societies, but I'd guess that we'd have difficulty doing this even with today's technology.

Science teachers may want to use this as an opportunity to show what happens when scientists let their passions and beliefs get in the way of interpreting evidence. It's certainly possible that a relatively advanced maritime society called Atlantis could have existed, but the more outlandish hypotheses presented here distract from what could already be a compelling story.

Rating 3 stars for keeping the legend of Atlantis alive and presenting the story in an enjoyable fashion.",1394841600,9,2062,4.9854651162790695

2828767,3,B000PY52G8,"Atlantis: Secret Star Mappers of a Lost World is OK, considering the price. It is short and doesn't contain any new proof of finding, or even locating Atlantis.
