961773,4,6305080798,"""Succubus"" invites repeat viewings, if only because your first thought upon reaching the final scene will be: What the hell? But that just makes it a perfect '60s Eurotrash time capsule. The beautiful Janine Reynaud (in the book ""Sleazoid Express,"" she's aptly described as a ""Gallic Dyanne Thorne"") stars as a nightclub performer who has a successful S&M stage show and a hot romance with her manager. She also has dreams that take her to a castle where she wears fabulous Karl Lagerfeld gowns and indulges in pretentious verbal sparring matches that lead to nudity and suggested sex, then murder. But maybe they're not dreams at all. Maybe she does know that mysterious stranger that keeps popping up periodically throught the film. And maybe she is indeed possessed by the devil. And maybe someone wants to kill her. Or, possibly, she's just attended one LSD orgy (complete with a drag queen, a dwarf and a dog puppet) too many. Nevermind. Once you accept the fact that the movie has no plans on becoming coherent, ""Succubus"" is a lot of fun to watch, the celluloid equivalent of hallucinogenic drugs. Director Jess Franco keeps us entertained by heaping on plenty of atmosphere and artsy camera work while star Reynaud helps out with her screen presence. Though the movie was rated X when first released, it would barely get an R today with its nudity, mostly of the T&A variety, and sex scenes that show the seduction or afterglow but bypass the act itself. The only true sex scene is filmed through a fish tank. Groovy.",1081814400,26,1525,4.802281368821292

But if you're expecting a quality dvd image, think again.  The transfer is acceptable, but the print is as faded as a hippy's blue  jeans.",961372800,6,303,4.392857142857143

7882422,4,6305080798,"Whenever there is a film like this, you always have to be sure to put it into the context of what it is. In this case, a cross-genre work of horror and hardcore adult content, an interesting concept to say the least. While one of the two female stars, Raven Riley, apparently has eventual aspirations of making mainstream horror films, as the adult nature of this film implies, the mainstream is probably still a ways off.

Anyway, with the likes of Riley and Goth beauty Liz Vicious, both primarily known for their work on the Internet,  ""Succubus"" is pretty impressive overall.

First off, how often do you find a porn that actually has some mildly decent dialogue and at least some resemblance of a real plot? Well, this one has both.
And as for the length of the movie, it's just over two-hours, sort of like a real, legit film, imagine that.

And while most adult movies are quite obviously of the low-budget variety, as far as the gene goes, ""Succubus"" is a special effects powerhouse.

As far as the sex scenes themselves are concerned, some where a little excessive and got kind of redundant after a while. Some others where a little too much of a mix with the horror theme. But overall, they where generally pretty damn hot, especially the ones with Raven and Liz together.

I went into viewing this as a huge fan of Liz but didn't know a whole lot about Raven. After partaking in this movie, the Goth hottie still remains among my favorites but I love me some Raven Riley too.

All in all, not a bad effort and I'd recommend anyone with a fairly strong stomach and an appetite for something different to give it a try.",1268265600,5,1628,4.498305084745763
7882423,2,6305080798,"Succubus (Jack Hemingway, 2007)

The idea of the gorenography film has long been an attractive one to exploitation filmmakers; combine the two genres that are easiest to make money with (and easiest to get funding for for that very reason), ""extreme"" horror and hardcore pornography, into one movie. But really, if you take a look at the structure of Succubus, the first serious attempt (that I know of) at making a gorenography film, it's about as ludicrous as you can get. First off, you take what the promotional materials call two of porn's hottest stars, though in reality both are acting in their first feature film. Actually, they're two Internet models with popular websites. Not that one expects Oscar-quality acting from a porn flick, but really, it's nice to find someone with acting experience for your two lead roles. And, wait, it clocks in at over two hours? Are you kidding?How many movies from either genre do you know that can carry a person's interest for two hours? (Putting aside the fact that most people watch movies from at least one of them five minutes at a time.) And, of course, you eventually have to ask yourself the question: despite the fact that the sex scenes are hardcore, which to some people will make them a raison d'etre in themselves, at what point do they stop being part of the movie and start being filler? That's a question that's kind of hard to answer with this movie. Don't get me wrong, it does have a plot, but...well, let me explain.

Lilith (Internet ""supergoth"" Liz Vicious) has been imprisoned in the rural town of Leeston, Indiana, for hundreds of years. (Lilith in Indiana? Yeah, I thought so too.) When a new amusement park, Uncle Joey's Terror Town, is being built in the vicinity, two construction workers dig down through the painfully flimsy coffin holding her, and break the wards. They get dispatched relatively quickly. (And these two sex scenes don't feel like filler.) Meanwhile, museum curator Raven Riley (played by the other Internet star, whose name is, amazingly, Raven Riley), whose family used to own land down thataways, finds out about the murders through her subscription to the local paper, and she decides to go down and investigate. There, she meets the local chief of police, Kevin Baxter (Kevin Baxter--great naming job in this movie), and the two of them discover, after talking about the murders, that they're fated to be together. (Okay, the sex scenes are starting to get a little forced.) Together, the two of them go after Lilith, who seems to be wandering around town killing people after having sex with them (okay, yeah, the sex scenes are filler at this point).

Now I'll tell you that I have to say, on the upside, that there are a few places in this movie, an isolated scene here and there, where a viewer who's watching for more than the sex scenes can actually see a few places where Bethany Burke's script (her first) shows a bit of promise. A few witty lines here and there, a couple of places where the words show some real talent. The same, however, cannot be said for the people speaking them. It's painfully obvious from moment one that neither Riley nor Vicious are actresses. That said, almost no one else involved with this production is, either. (To give you an idea, the best acting in the movie is featured in Ron Jeremy's cameo.) Baxter is so bad he actually makes Riley look pretty good in certain scenes, and that's tough. As for the rest of the technical details, well, let's just say it looks a lot more like a porn film than a horror film, with a single exception: the lighting. A number of horror directors make this same mistake, so I'm not taking too many points off, but a lot of this movie is dark, dark, dark, and it seems like the camera and lighting folks made the relatively common mistake of substituting ""so dark you can barely see anything"" for atmosphere. It's not scary, it's annoying, people. Stop it.

If you're the kind of person who watches slasher films solely for the T&A, this is obviously going to be right up your alley, so have fun. If you want a good horror movie that happens to contain a great deal of sex, as many of us do, you're going to have to wait around for a while longer, because this ain't it. * ",1228608000,7,4245,4.639627659574468
7882424,5,6305080798,"Loved this Franco flick. LOVED it. After watching the original Anchor Bay version a few years back, and didn't think much of it - this new Blue Underground transfer is a whole new experience of cheesy 60's psychedalia from the master of Spanish sleaze, and more than worth the double-dip for Franco fans.",1182988800,3,304,4.754716981132075
7882425,3,6305080798,"I wonder who Jess Franco was trying to appeal to with this movie. Supposedly, it is a horror movie about a women who may or may not be possessed by the devil, but it isn't really scary. It might have been a sex film, as we see copious amounts of Janine Reynaud's breasts and bum, but it wasn't really erotic. It might have been an art film, but it wasn't really good enough.

Janine Reynaud plays Lorna Green, a stripper who is disengaged from reality. Her boyfriend William seems to understand something of her sinister existence, but it is not revealed what he really understands. Together, William and Lorna (it might not be her real name, it is left ambiguous in the movie) go to bizarre parties (complete with midgets, dog masks, and drunk cross dressers), Lorna's S&M show, and so on... But, at night it seems that Lorna seduces people and kills them inside a seaside mansion.

What is really going on is never explained... it doesn't really have to be. Reality and fantasy are completely interchangable, and both of them move at more or less the same pace and have more or less the same feel to them. Some scenes move slower than others, but all of them are filled with a slew of imagery and symbolism, which seem almost pretentious on Jess Franco's part. He constantly goes through names of writers and film makers and has characters provide a one word description for them... Most people would be lost with all the references, showing that Franco was aiming for a better read audience.

Yet, at the same time, Franco could be losing that very same audience. The voice overs that narrate each characters thoughts are painful. Jack Taylor's (William) acting is perfectly one dimensional, seldom changing... even when his life is in incredible danger. Perhaps Jess Franco wanted it that way... but it certainly was not impressive. So the people that are familiar with the people that he mentioned (most notably Lang, Bunuel and Godard) would be more accustomed to the more refined styles of the aformentioned directors and see this movie as B-grade tripe.

This movie seemed to defy categorization and at the same time defy every potential viewer. Everyone can find something in this movie that they do not like, but not everyone can find something that they do. I did. I thought that the movie presented interesting ideas and as pretentious as it was the symbolism was entertaining to identify and deconstruct.",1127260800,,2417,4.77511961722488

7882427,1,6305080798,"""Succubus"" is incoherent, confusing, and, above all, very very boring. I mean i like weird, surreal movies, movies when it's very hard for the viewer to separate the reality from the dream, but this movie sucks big time!!

  And even though i thought it will be at least a horror movie, well i was wrong! In fact ""Succubus"" is NOT a horror movie at all.

  My advice is: Avoid this at all coasts!!!! Only recommended for those who suffer from insomnia!!!!",1121472000,2,455,4.555555555555555
