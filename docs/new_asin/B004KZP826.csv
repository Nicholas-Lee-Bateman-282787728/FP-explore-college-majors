8433644,3,B004KZP826,"Several things about this movie make very little sense.  One is the title listed on Amazon, Park Avenue LODGER.  The title is actually Park Avenue LOGGER.  Another is the professional wrestling hokum.  Of all the macho hobbies which a millionaire's son could have, why the theater of professional wrestling?  There is no explanation in the movie. Though somewhere down in my memory is the thought that in the 1930's, the general public may not have known that wrestling was choreographed and scripted.  Another strange thing is how the logger's dress at the Annual Lumberjack's Jamborie (sic) and, later, at the dance hall.  There are others but the final one which I will mention is Ward Bond on the cover of the Synergy release even though he has only fourth billing in the movie.

The actual star of the movie is George O'Brien, an actor whose real life career could serve as the basis for a movie.  Serving aboard a U.S. Navy subchaser in WW1, he volunteered to go to the front as a stretcher bearer and was decorated for bravery.  Shortly after the war he was the light heavyweight boxing champion of the Pacific Fleet.  When WW2 came along, he again volunteered for the navy, serving as a beachmaster and was again decorated.  He had attained the rank of commander at the end of the war.  After the war he served in the Naval Reserve, retiring as a captain, having been recommended for promotion to admiral four times.

Despite all of the silly things, the movie isn't as bad as I expected.  I streamed the movie via Amazon Prime so can not comment on any dvd's.",1496188800,,1568,4.630434782608695
