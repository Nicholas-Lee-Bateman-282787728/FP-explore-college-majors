6106485,3,B00GSA4FDO,"This is a hand held camera film about a group of people filming themselves ""playing"" with a Ouija board. Michael (Justin Armstrong) owns the board. He is joined by his friend Calvin, a player (Eric Window), Cal's latest girlfriend Shay (Belmarie Huynh) and Calvin's sister L'nette (Swisyzinna Moore). This is all being filmed by Brandon (Carson Underwood) for his web site, although it appears everyone owns a camera.

The board of course contacts spirits. Shay asks the board questions about Calvin and his other girlfriends and gets an answer only Michael, who has his finger on the pointer, would know. Meanwhile Brandon looks up the names of the people mentioned by the board.

The film is based on the idea that the Ouija board can act as a portal between the two worlds if you don't hang up, or in this case say ""good-bye."" According to my occult knowledge, that is not exactly true. However black mirrors if uncovered are supposed to supply a portal for spirits.

I liked the idea of the film, maybe because it is a common theme done so many times before. In this particular production, it was not done well. The dialouge was fairly bad. There was wasted footage of people playing around. Seeing a Ouija board pointer move is a let down after we have seen a pool crawler get out of the water. Yes, we do see ghosts and there is a flashback to their lives.

I don't recommend this film unless you are really really into the hand held filming.

Parental Guide: No F-bombs that I recall. Some adult talk. Brief male rear nudity (Eric Window). No sex.",1384905600,14,1554,4.615942028985507

6106497,1,B00GSA4FDO,"Found footage can be used to create an effect that adds to the horror experience when done right (The original Blair Witch Project, VHS, etc..). It appears to me that the makers of this film chose found footage to help distract from the sloppy writing, poor acting and cheesy special effects. For example, there are points in the film in the found footage scenes where all of the characters in that particular scene are on screen at once, leaving you wondering who's supposedly holding the camera (Is it the ghost? No, it's inattention to detail by the film makers).

There is a point in the film when the characters are reviewing their own footage only to see (SPOILER ALERTS FROM HERE ON OUT!) that the ghost didn't show up on film. This makes no sense, as the audience has already seen the ghost on film in what is supposedly found footage.

Later in the film, one of the main characters is looking at an old scrap book when he figures out who the real killer is. At this point, it's already known (incorrectly, as it turns out) that the mentally handicapped neighbor, Joe drowned the little girl, Gracie, and was then shot and killed by the mother, Lisa who then took her own life with a knife, all in the same day. My question is, ""Who the Hell compiled the scrapbook of newspaper articles, etc concerning the events, and how did he figure out it was really the mother who drowned Gracie just by looking at a scrapbook of newspaper clippings?""

Also, why did Gracie refer to Josef as a ""bad man"" early in the film, when it turns out that he was her best friend in life, and continues to be her friend in the afterlife?

The acting and special effects are less than good, but I won't spend any more time on them, as it's something that can be overlooked with a well written story-line.",1452124800,,1789,4.461773700305811
6106498,1,B00GSA4FDO,DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE unless your watching it to laugh its poorly made and most effects can be done with a phone camera the acting is HORRIBLE and the movies ending is far less than redeeming. it was a bad movie in every aspect unless you just really want somthing to poke fun at. this entire movie is a joke and a group of 10 year olds could have done it. for god sake the noise the ghost made kinda just sounded like a chair being slid accross the floor. i didn't even want to watch this movie i was going to watch ouija there normal movie but i accidently found my self here and only continued to watch out of nothing better to do. i wish i didnt. this is time of my life i can never get back.,1450742400,,698,3.9574468085106385

6106568,3,B00GSA4FDO,"This movie is about a group of friends who mess around with a Ouija Board and they end up summoning several ghosts into our world.  Let's face it, this has been done in many movies over the years and this one is just okay.

What I don't understand about this movie is the ghosts and their knowledge.  They ask who someone is talking to on their phone and what the person's name is and what they were wearing the night he met that person and other things that I doubt these ghosts would know.  I mean these ghosts aren't omnipotent, they aren't God, they're ghosts!  I kinda doubt they were in the club the night that those two people met, so how would they know what the one person was wearing?

Now as far as the special effects, they are kinda lame.  When the ghosts appear on screen, they don't look very scary, it's just people with make-up on their faces and they use cutaways that involve jostling the camera all around when you see the ghosts in order to hide the fact that they did a cut to then show the ghost is no longer there.  I've seen this done on YouTube on Mark Apsolon's channel and he did it better and his ""ghosts"" were scarier.

I will admit that the end does have a pretty cool twist and I am glad I watched it.  I give this movie 2.5 stars, and I am rounding up because you can't do partial ratings here.  If you liked the other Ouija Board movies that have been around over the past few years, you'll probably enjoy this one.  Check it out!",1438473600,,1464,4.207885304659499

This story is not only filled with characters' choices which do not make sense even under stress, as well as story which simply doesn't add up. It isn't the worst that I've seen, but I have definitely seen better.

The acting was decent sometimes and awful other times. The scenes were decent. I did not care for the ""ghosts""; I tend to like some things left to my imagination as actually seeing it often ruins it. The little girl wasn't too badly done, though, and I have seen worse.

6106856,3,B00GSA4FDO,"Five losers gather to use a ouija board, one of the most lame and debunkable of all paranormal tools. We have the guy who can't put down a camera (a requirement in any found footage film), a guy who's really into not being filmed (despite owning his own camera) and ouija boards, an idiot girl big into causing drama, a black guy in a tight pink shirt using the idiot girl for money and sex, and Mr. Pink's sister who throws out the dated and stupid line about a black person getting killed off first. The movie doesn't bother with much more character development than that and I suppose I should be thankful. The guy with the ouija board is big into the group following the three rules of the board: don't ask the spirit how it died, don't ask how you will die, and never leave the board without saying goodbye or else a doorway to the spirit world will---I'm sorry, I can't finish that sentence, it broke my goofy meter. However, rule three is what leads to the consequences our characters face in this movie.
The premise is stupid, the characters are stupid, the acting is weak, it's not without plot holes... And yet, It's not a bad movie. The pace moves fast enough to hold your interest for ninety minutes and it's got a good grasp of tension and scares. The demonic growling is a bit much, though, and the actor who plays Josef in the final act needs to take a cue from the movie Tropic Thunder: ""Never go full retard."" Still, I didn't regret watching The Ouija Experiment. [2.5/5 stars]",1422316800,,1494,4.4363636363636365
6106857,1,B00GSA4FDO,"I jumped approximately 1 time.  Pretty much the rest of the movie me and my girlfriend spent laughing at the low budget acting, script, pacing acting, atmosphere and deaths.

Movie jumped the shark once the black chick's brother died.  Are you telling me you are going to see your brother dead on the bed, and not trip out crying?  She kinda just touched him a few times then went on looking for the ouija board to burn.  She had more feels for her friend who's head got cut off up in the attic.",1422316800,,495,4.279569892473118

6106860,5,B00GSA4FDO,Genuinely scary I watched this little gem at first I was highly sceptical but decided to stay with it glad I did after all that's said and done it is a really good film with great plot twists throughout. They decide and I never know why to experiment with a quija board so the group of young people set it up afterward really creepy and deadly ???? starts happening. Right now I anm watching the follow up to this [ The Quija Resurrection ] it is also good and better made and the special effects are so well done the spooky stuff looks genuine,1421798400,,544,4.240384615384615
6106861,1,B00GSA4FDO,"I'm not really sure how this movie achieved 3 stars.  There were so many flaws in it, the acting was so amateur, and it was so ridiculous that I literally walked away several times to do other things.  If I could rate this 1/2 a star I would.  I'm actually glad I didn't pay to view this as a Prime member.  Here's a question, why do all of these hand-held camera movies rely so heavily on dark rooms, loud bangs and lots of screaming to try to scare their audience?  I won't even bother to list the many flaws of the movie.  Just don't waste your time with this one.",1421798400,,567,4.109090909090909

6106863,4,B00GSA4FDO,"After reading a number of reviews, both good and, more frequently, bad, I had low expectations for this movie.  However, for a ""found footage"" movie, I was rather surprised at the quality of the editing and CGI that went into its production.  The story started off slow, but ended up pretty good, and I could imagine myself getting caught up in the characters' minds as things happened that should be happening.

As a paranormal investigator myself, I am a bit skeptic about Ouija boards and their ability to communicate with the spirits, but this movie had me believing in it.",1421539200,,577,4.75
6106864,1,B00GSA4FDO,"Utterly terrible on all levels. Was hoping for a good Ouija movie, for once, as Ive always loved the concept. Nope.

No scares, no thrills, and community-college level acting (at best). Another disaster to toss on the c-movie, microbudget, found footage horror heap. Avoid at all costs. There's truly no point in reviewing this one further. Happily, it's free on Amazon Prime.

I have definitely seen worse found footage. If you want something a little lighter than the norm, this could be for you.

I don't understand how a few people could possibly say the acting was ""above"" average because the acting was worse than any other low budget film i've seen.  I really don't like the ""Found Footage"" style of film making that more and more movies seem to be doing these days, as I think it tends to loose interest and you can never get a grip on what exactly is happening, and is really annoying to not being able to see what is actually going on, not to mention the camera is all over the place which is even more frustrating.  All in all, the story line was ""ok"".  If they stuck with that and used a different style of filming, had a higher budget, and MUCH better acting, this might have taken off much better, but it seems like a few inexperience people got together and tried to make a film hoping to make millions like the Blair Witch Project from a low budget film, but failed miserably at it.",1417392000,,959,4.281767955801105

I finally ended up liking this movie, one of few that I have even finished watching from sites like Hulu and Crackle.  I don't like the hand held camera technique, so that detracted from the movie for me.  The story was good with a few twists and a lot of creepy surprises.

The person who recommended the movie (flossy carter), well actually he didn't recommend the movie. He said it was garbage. The only scary movies I watch are ones that deal with the paranormal. I hate those slasher let's-kill-every-teen-in-site movies. I like scary movies that deal with demons and things like that but based on a true story. The best one I seen that I liked were paranormal activity 1 and 2. They weren't that scary but they were good. This movie tries to be like those since it deals with found footage but it is far worse.

The movie seemed to go in different directions and the acting wasn't that great at all. Towards the end didn't make much sense. Seemed like a stupid reason for her to do what she did. They could have found other reasons for this entity to haunt the house. Also it was stupid how she killed herself. The movie just plain sucked. But I can't really complain. Why? Because I have amazon prime and I saw the movie for free. If you don't have prime then don't bother getting it and please don't rent or buy this movie.

It was so horrible I quit watching in the middle of the grand finale. I've never quit a movie during the closing scene...ever.  I honestly can't think of one redeeming quality this film offers. The script was sub-par any ""B"" movie. The acting... esp. the character playing ""shay"" was an embarrassment. I've seen better acting in my ex's ""found-footage"" porno tapes!

The acting ranges from poor to decent enough.  The camera work, lighting, and sound are all poor but it's a found footage flick so it's supposed to be poor.  I'm not fooling myself, though- this isn't a quality production crew doing good work and part of the game is making the quality look bad for the effect.  Ain't a lot of talent associated with this movie and it takes full advantage of the camouflage found footage flicks provide.

Why 2 stars instead of 1?  I just need a movie playing while I'm working in my shop.  Something in the background other than TV with commercials.  It fit that need okay.

With The Ouija Experiment the rule was simple but the players kept forgetting the one rule: ""Say Goodbye"". And thus, the ghosts had a play date with these people.

Toward the end, it had some funny moments that I think were supposed to be scary... example: one guys bathroom turns pink. The only thoughts I had for the entire scene was PINK Everything Is PINK.

8626708,4,B00GSA4FDO,"The Ouija Experiment is actually a decent found footage horror movie.  It's about time right?  This doesn't happen everyday.  Usually found footage movies follow the same cliches of having no character direction, no story to speak of and nothing of substance to care about with weak scares to finish the movie off.  But the Ouija Experiment is an improvement over these ones. I have to warn you- my review contains major SPOILERS!  Please remember that.  It starts off pretty lame and typical of found footage movies though.  A group of men and women visit a friend's house in Texas to use a Ouija board.

Rule number one.  Never ask a spirit how he or she died because we don't want it to relive the experience over and over.  Rule number two.  Never ask a spirit how you're going to die because you probably don't want to know for one thing, and because they say if you ask the spirit how you're going to die your mind is going to subconsciously create/dread that fateful day.  And finally, never leave the Ouija board without saying goodbye because it'll leave the spirit world open to possibly entering our world.  These are nice rules, but we soon find out that last one is *very* important!

At first nobody in the group takes the Ouija board seriously.  They ask ""What's your name?""  ""How old are you?""  ""Where are you?"" ""Are you alone?"" ""Who else is there with you?"" and determine it's just a little girl.  This movie has a way of demanding that viewers watch the board closely to get our answers to these questions because nobody in the group wants to say them out loud and clearly.  You'll have to see the responses on the Ouija board instead of listening which requires a bit more attention than you might think.

Someone brings up the question ""Can you ask one spirit how the other died?""  They ask how Gracie died, the little girl who's responding, and the message on the Ouija board says she drowned.  How did Joseph die, which is the other spirit communicating with the group, and the Ouija board says he was shot.  This next part is pretty lame but actually has meaning later on with, believe it or not, an actual interesting story around it!  The character of Calvin gets into a fight with his girlfriend because he walks away to answer his cell phone in private, and his girlfriend uses the Ouija board to find out who he's talking to.  Yeah, trivial stuff that's typical of found footage movies.  Soon only two people of the group are playing the Ouija while the camera guy films it.  They ask ""Who is BDRM?"" which means bedroom.  They walk to the bedroom and see a flipped over picture, and the wall pictures upside down.  This leads to questioning.

The movie shifts to Calvin about to take a shower with his girlfriend in the bedroom.  She complains that the camera is still rolling and questions why.  She assumes this footage will be on youtube and gets upset about it.  When the girlfriend sorts through things on the bed while Calvin's in the shower, the film shifts to the other Ouija board users in the house.  A woman appears on the youtube screen on the lower left corner, and compares the Ouija board to the Bermuda Triangle as something that can't be explained.  She explains spirits are here because they have a message they want to convey.  This woman thinks of spirits as protectors more than evil spirits.  She mentions a woman tormented by ghosts and that the story was turned into a movie called the Entity.  She reminds the users that the Ouija board is a portal to another dimension and reminds them that it's very important to say goodbye when they're done using it.

The group goes on the Ouija board again.  They want to talk to Gracie but they get a woman named Lisa instead.  Lisa's persistent but this experience is interrupted as the girlfriend from earlier who demands to know more about her boyfriend's behavior asks questions on the Ouija board about the girl Calvin was cheating on her with.  Then she asks the Ouija board questions about people in the group such as Michael and Brandon, two other guys part of the group, and this escalates into a fight since apparently it's rational to immediately think the Ouija board, which is used to contact spirits, is giving them accurate answers to their real life problems.

When one guy's alone in the living room and in front of the camera, he walks into the kitchen and sees a glass rolling around on the floor.  He walks into the garage and gets a surprise when a puppet of an old man starts up unexpectedly.  That's the end of this scene.  It's now apparent they forgot to say goodbye after a Ouija board session and there's a spirit roaming around the house due to each member of the group hearing odd sounds and having a weird feeling.  Now the ""story"" gets silly as one character from the group (Lynette) shouts racial words at the other girl concerning karate, and the one guy from the group takes a shower listening to rap.

When the one woman walks into the kitchen, she sees a brief image of an old man approaching her and growling before disappearing.  The group returns to the Ouija board.  They say they didn't say goodbye to Joseph yesterday and want to do it today.  They get the little girl who wants to play.  She says Joseph's not here.  Calvin comes storming in and yells at the other guy.  He says he broke up with his girlfriend because someone ran his mouth about the woman he's been cheating on (named Blair).  Hey don't blame these guys- blame the Ouija board!  That's who revealed the cheating!

The one guy screams and defends himself by saying he always had Calvin's back and would never cheat on him over some girl.  Calvin says he doesn't understand how the Ouija board has magical powers that can reveal he's been cheating.  He then takes the board and storms out of the room saying ""When you're ready to say the truth you'll get your board back"".  The guy and girl of the group then get into a fight with the camera man.

When Lynette goes to sleep in her bedroom leaving the camera on, we hear a child laughing while the door's wide open.  She wakes up startled and thinks it's a dream until the laugh gets louder.  She grabs the camera and sees a little girl growling on the living room floor.  That would wake ME up for sure!  Lynette runs back to her bedroom and slams the door.  When she opens it, the little girl is now standing up and running towards her.  It's times like these we're thankful for doors.  Lynette turns around and the little girls now in the bedroom giggling and disappearing.  Okay finally something terrifying!  This scene is really good!

We find out more information about the Ouija board experience related to past events that happened in this house.  Gracie the little girl was the daughter of Lisa and Joseph was the next door neighbor.  Joseph drowned Gracie and Lisa killed Joseph in revenge.  Ah ha!  Actual storyline, and a pretty good one at that.  Calvin, in his house, sets up the camera and uses the Ouija board to prove it doesn't work.  He asks ""Is anyone there?"" and hears growling behind him.  He leaves the room to check it out, but upon returning and talking into the camera saying it doesn't work, we see a figure walk down the hallway in the open space of the hallway behind him.  Then suddenly we see it dart in front of the camera.  Calvin says he knows his friend told his girlfriend about Blair, the girl he's been cheating on.  Suddenly a figure grabs Calvin's head and tosses him to the floor killing him.

One of the other men from the group (either Michael or Brandon- I get these two confused a lot!) finds out that Gracie drowned on his and his girlfriend's birthday.  He isn't sure if this is a coincidence.  He falls asleep in the chair and wakes up to the sound of females talking.  He heads into the bathroom with his camera and a ghostly figure appears behind him.  He keeps saying ""This isn't right"" but I'm sure many of us have no idea what he's referring to since it looks like a normal bathroom.  He hears a little girl giggling.  He opens the door and... now it's obvious this movie favors a pitch black setting upon one of these characters opening a door as a possible scary teaser before someone turns the lights on.  Suddenly a little kid appears and... the scene ends.  Very disappointing.

While in the computer room the group rewinds the footage and investigates what just happened.  This time the footage shows blue towels hanging instead of pink.  This doesn't make sense!  Michael or Brandon knows those towels were just pink.  Then the footage cuts out... like always just before a demon appearance!  Another found footage cliche.  The demon that came into the bathroom while Michael or Brandon was investigating isn't on the tape.... of course.

He reviews more information about using a Ouija board.  A spirit might tell the truth about a future or past event to win over the trust of the user.  Never use a Ouija board in a graveyard because it might cause manifestations.  Some believe that certain spirits remain in our world and contact the living to reveal certain messages about conflicts and issues.  They can be gentle or passive by noises and voices.  They can appear to users in a forceful or aggressive way by moving things or even make physical contact with the living.  Michael or Brandon hears a noise in the back and goes to check it out.

This time the growling shakes the floorboards of Calvin's house where we see blood on the floor.  His sister goes to check it out.  She plays the footage of Blair asking for Calvin.  When she comes over it's now real time instead of camera footage.  She sees Calvin standing by the doorway and asks if he's okay, but his belly rumbles really loud so he must be hungry... or demonic!

Back to the other guy (Michael and Brandon) and more little girl giggling.  He plays hide and seek with the little girl when he opens a door.  She giggles and runs into the closet.  He pulls down the attic stairs and walks up them.  A toy fires up that says ""Turn back now before it's too late.  If not, may you rest in peace"".  This of course frightens the man.  He opens a scrapbook and sees newspaper clippings of Gracie, the little girl who drowned.

He notices a link between the timing of Gracie's death and how Joseph died a short time later... which happened on Shay's birthday... Shay is Calvin's girlfriend.  He rattles more numbers that are supposed to be coincidences but they aren't rationally explained.  More news clippings found about the deaths of Gracie, Lisa and Joseph.  Brandon and Lynette run to Calvin's house to burn the evil Ouija board.  They see Shay and Calvin lying in bed dead.  The growling is more intense than ever, filling up the living room.  They grab the Ouija board and run!

They show what happened the night Gracie died.  Lisa's giving Gracie a bath.  They talk about picnics and pony rides while on vacation with Lisa's boyfriend.  Gracie mentions Joseph next door and how she wants him to come with them on vacation, but Lisa gets really upset and says he's weird and needs to stay away from the family.  Turns out George, Lisa's boyfriend, is on call and can't go to the picnic with them.  He wants out of the relationship and sounds like he's being inconvenienced by the picnic.

Lisa snaps and strangles Gracie in the bathtub.  Joseph comes by and let's himself in.  He wants to know if they're going to have a tea party.  He walks into the bathroom.  Lisa's gone, but Gracie's lying in the bathtub dead.  He tries to hand her a towel but she won't woke up.  When Joseph touches her he confirms what he suspected- that she's dead.  He begs Lisa to call a doctor when she walks into the bathroom a moment later.  She just says ""Step away from her"".  Joseph knows what Lisa did and threatens to tell his mom about it.  Before Joseph can leave through the front door Lisa pulls out a gun and shoots him in the forehead.  No, we don't hear Gracie crying if you're asking seriously Lisa!  Lisa then cuts her throat with a knife.  Something tells me the picnic won't go on as scheduled.  Best moment of the movie for sure.

Now back to the group of Ouija board users.  A strange demon appears and growls at Michael.  Meanwhile Brandon and Lynette return from Calvin's house quickly to save Michael only to hear loud growling from the upstairs room.  Michael yells for them.  ""I need your help, hurry!"" referring to the attic where he's hiding.  He sounds nice and calm when he says this... but it's not him speaking.  Brandon and Lynette foolishly walk up there only for a demon to throw Michael's head down at them.  In the dark Brandon and Lynette walk around scared.  They find the Ouija board and take it to the fireplace.

When they get it lit they're just about to throw the Ouija board in but... the demon appears and distracts them.  So they can't throw it in.  Just then Lynette grabs it and throws it in!  In a rather impressive moment, we see the demon get ripped apart the moment the Ouija board is tossed in the fire.  Awesome moment.  What the!!!  Joseph walks into the house!  And Gracie's here too!  ""What is going on?"" the one man says.  I'm asking the same thing!  Joseph walks Gracie into the bathroom, a camera floats in the air and the film ends.

Wow, a movie that was horrible in the first half gets dramatically better in the second!  I didn't see such a big improvement coming at all either.  I almost feel bad for giving this film 4 stars since you know, found footage stinks, but the second half is really dang good so I have to.  I give in, a found footage movie gets a high rating!",1498435200,,13595,4.509643003693065
