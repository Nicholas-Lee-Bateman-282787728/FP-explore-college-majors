Lex Luger & The British Bulldog vs. The Blu Brothers- openers sometimes set the tone for the show and unfortunately that is what this match did *

Undertaker vs. King Kong Bundy- I'm an Undertaker fan but this match is crap 1/2*

Tag Team Championship Smoking Guns (Champions) vs. Owen Hart & Yokozuna- Second best match of the evening (that's not saying a lot), but all in all it was a solid tag team match ***1/2

I Quit Match Bret Hart vs. Bob Backland- One of the most dissapointing matches in WrestleMania history as two great technical wrestlers put on a long & drawn out match (of course Bret Hart would have a much better ""I Quit Match"" two years later at Mania, but that's a different story) **

WWF Championship Diesel (Champion) vs. Shawn Michaels- Match of the night, HBK puts in a solid performance, not one of his mania classics but a very solid showing none the less ****

Main Event Lawerence Taylor vs. Bam Bam Bigelow- Worst main event in WrestleMania History, I'm a diehard New York Giants fan so I love L.T., but I definately didn't want to see him in the main event of a WrestleMania. Although, as I said this is the worst main event in WrestleMania history, I thin it could have actually been a lot worse (which is scary). However, I will give credit to Bam Bam for carrying L.T. to a watchable match **1/2

Conclusion- I own all of the WrestleMania's and in my opinion (as well as the opinion of many others) this is the worst WrestleMania ever. There were no classics, there were only two memorable matches, one of which is the main event which is memorable for all of the wrong reasons, and a whole bunch of crap. I only recomend this tape if you are trying to collect all of the WrestleMania's",1116720000,3,1920,4.661721068249258
1004424,2,6305277001,"This WrestleMania usually ranks near the bottom on most peoples lists.  It's good to have to complete the collection, but if you are getting one Mania go with 10 or 12, both of which are very good.  Onto the card

1The British Bulldog and Lex Luger vs. The Blu Brothers - 1 1/2 *

2. Jeff Jarret vs. Razor Ramon - Pretty good match, though bopth men have put in better performances.  3 * s

3.  King Kong Bundy vs. The Undertaker - any match with the taker is good, though its probably best to pair him up with big guys who are sort of mysterious the way he his to give it some flair.  3 1/2 *

4.  Yokozuna and Owen hart vs. The Smoking Guns - This was a good match making this Mania along with Wrestlemania 2 as the Mania in which the best match was the tag title match.  Yoko and Owen, both of whom have since passed away, made a great tag team, which was completely unexpected.  The Guns put in a good effort and jobbed really well.  5 star match for sure.

5.  Bob Backlund vs. Bret Hart - Ok 2 *  Best part is the fact that you get to see Roddy Piper.

6.  Shawn Michaels vs. Diesel - Good match.  Probably gets 4 stars but three of them go to Michaels who gives a memorabile performance in just about every Mania he's in.

7.  Bam Bam Bigelow vs. Lawrence Taylor - ugggh how shall i put this.  NFL WWF crossovers have to be done right else they come out really weak.  In WrestleMania 2 it worked because it was a Battle Royal and the wrestlers were able to help move things along.  This match was sort of absurd from the lead up.  Match was pretty bad, but what were fans really expecting.  L.T. wins and gets attention from mainstream sports media, (I think it was in the papers)so i guess that was cool.  But for a main event it was a poor finish.",1112832000,2,1756,4.073313782991202
1004425,2,6305277001,"This was another terrible WrestleMania along with WrestleMania 9. Here are the matches.

1. British Bulldog and Lex Luger vs. Eli Blu and Jacon Blu 6/10

Bad choice for an opener. This was probably not good because none of the wrestlers made it interesting to watch.

2. Double J vs. Razor Ramon 6/10

I was not such a fan of the match these two guys had at the Royal Rumble 1995, but tobe honest that one was better. This match was okay but this not the best from either men, especially Razor Ramon. Razor Ramon wins by DQ. Back to Back bad matches, not good.

3. King Kong Bundy vs. The Undertaker 7/10

This match okay. I ight have been expecting a little better but it was satisfying. The Undertaker barely wins with a knockdown, then a half chokeslam (because Bundy is so heavy), followed by I think a slam.

4. Owen Hart and Yokozuna vs. Billy Gunn and Bart Gunn (The Smoking Gunns) 8/10

This was satisfying and entertaining to watch after the first few matches. This had a lot of action in it, and those cowboys did pretty well against Yokozuna. The ending is funny because Yokozuna squashes Billy Gunn, and then gets the victory. Yokozuna and Owen Hart are the new WWE Tag Team Champions.

5. Bob Backlund vs. Bret Hart (I Quit Match) 7/10

When I saw this, I was not expecting it to be like the I quit match at the Royal Rumble 1999 between The Rock and Mankind, but I was expecting something in that nature. It turned out to be nothing but Submission. That actually got pretty boring sothat is why it was bad.

6. Shawn Michaels vs. Diesel 8/10

This was an okay/good match. It had a couple good moves (only from Shawn Michaels) and a lot of action. The problem is that it was boring at the beginning but it got better as it continued. It was also REALLY long. It was also funny when Shawn Michaels tosses some camera guy at ringside because he was in his way.

7. Bam Bam Bigalow vs. Lawrence Taylor 7/10

Really bad choice for a final main event. It was an okay match with some good moves from both men. I was a little amazed with Taylor's talent. The end was pretty predictable with Lawrence Taylor winning, I knew they were not going to let him lose. I also think Bam Bam Bigalow was going a little easy on him.",1108857600,6,2226,4.319711538461538

1004427,2,6305277001,"Wrestlemania 11:  Hartford Civic Center.  April 2, 1995.

I think that this particular Wrestlemania was below par by Wrestlemania's standards.  This probably would have been more suited to be an In Your House than ""the showcase of the immortals.""  I don't understand why Vince McMahon thought that this would be such a great event.  Sure, there may have been some good matches, but overall this is more like an extended episode of Raw than the biggest event of the year.  Also, the focus of the event seemed to be more on the celebrities on hand than the actual wrestling itself, and this is what I believe dragged Wrestlemania XI down.

Here is my review, match by match (maybe not necessarily in order, and ratings are out of 5 stars)

Tag Team Match:  Lex Luger and the British Bulldog (the Allied Powers) vs. The Blu Brothers (Jacob and Eli) with Uncle Zebakiah (sp?)

Total waste of time. 1 star as Luger and the Bulldog win it.

Intercontinental Championship Match:  Jeff Jarrett (with Roadie) vs. Razor Ramon (with 1-2-3 Kid)

Pretty good match, but too long for a crappy DQ ending.  I like the little ""brawl"" afterwards though.  3 stars.

Undertaker vs. King Kong Bundy.

Didn't really like this one.  Like other reviewers have mentioned, the match moved INCREDIBLY slow.  Also, I find it lame how the Untertaker won without using a chokeslam or the Tombstone Piledriver.  2 stars.

Tag Team Championship match:  The Smoking Gunns (Champions) vs. Owen Hart and (the late) Yokozuna.

Probably the best match of the night, and it isn't even five stars!  4 stars as the titles change hands after Yokozuna's devastating Bonzai Drop to Billy Gunn.

""I Quit"" Match:  Bret ""Hitman"" Hart vs. Bob Backlund with Guest Referee Rowdy Roddy Piper.

If you're thinking ""Mankind vs. Rock at Royal Rumble 1999,"" don't.  This match is a far cry from that thriller.  No weapons were involved, it was just submissions.  3 stars because of an excellent performance by Bret as he defeated the annoying Bob Backlund with his own hold (the Crossface Chicken Wing).

WWF Championship Match:  Diesel (Champion) with Pamela Anderson vs. Shawn Michaels with Jenny McCarthy.

A pretty good match, but would have been more suited for an In Your House.  Pretty underwhelming by WM's standards (like the event itself).  Also, Diesel's jacknife power bomb on HBK at the end looked so fake, I actually laughed when I first saw it.  3.5 stars.

Grudge Match, Main Event:  Bam Bam Bigelow vs. Lawrence Taylor.

The match is long and boring, and, like another reviewer mentioned, the fact that a non-wrestler beat a wrestler was total crap.  It was also real predictable.  Wrestlemania's main events are supposed to be among the best of their respective years, but this one just sucks.  I have nothing against Lawrence Taylor (who is perhaps the greatest linebacker ever), but he shouldn't have been in this match.  It should have been someone else (maybe Bret Hart), and the WWF title should have been up for grabs.  But no, we're stuck with this sluggish, mind-numbingly dull match instead.  0.5 stars.

Overall, this is a very disappointing Wrestlemania.  I don't know if it is the worst because I haven't seen all of them yet, but it leaves a lot to be desired.  This is Wrestlemania, the showcase of the immortals!  Make it good!

I highly suggest getting Wrestlemania X, XII (for the Iron Man Match, but it's better than ALL of XI), XII, or XIV.  But skip WM XI unless you want to complete your Wrestlemania collection.",1092528000,,3497,4.811129848229342
1004428,1,6305277001,"Diesel vs Shawn Michaels
This was the most low key, underserving main event in Wrestlemania history up to this point.
Diesel had been in the WWE for about 5 minutes and was put in the main event, against a guy nobody took seriously at that time.
I can't stand HBK, but he should've won the championship as it seems a wasted oppurtunity not to trade titles at Mania.
This was insignificant, compared to previous Mania main events with Diesel totally undeserving of this match.
However, it was the best match of the night (more down to lack of any other good matches). And Pamela Anderson's ass looks hot as she is at ringside.
(3/5)
Undertaker vs King Kong Bundy
Taker is hopeless and need to work with guys who can carry him. Bundy couldn't carry a box of tissue. On paper this was a decent opponent for him (Bundy headlined Mania 2) but on screen it was a total joke match

Bret Hart vs Bob Backlund
This should've been the best match in years, but the stupid I Quit gimmick soon killed it off. Hart is good, Backlund sucks and Roddy Piper (guest ref) is just annoying.

Lawrence Taylot vs Bam Bam Bigelow
Awful, just terrible. Worst match in Mania history. Bam Bam was great, and should've been a WWE Champion at least once. But this match killed his career and LT was abysmal.
By having a non-wrestler beat a wrestler in a wrestling match it makes WWE wrestling look like a joke. We all know wrestling has its critics, and this is why, when a wrestler loses to a footballer it destroys credibilty.
Bam Bam should've crushed LT's head. But instead he jobs in the worst way.
Its stupid decisions like this that kill any type of wrestling credibilty and this the worst move the WWE made in the 1990's.

While Bret Hart vs. Bob Backlund is a good technical match, it is far from being one of Hart's better matches and is often forgotten when compared with some of his other classic matches.

7886775,2,6305277001,"Just based off of its card alone, I had avoided watching this wrestlemania for a long time but when i recently purchased volume 3 of the wrestlemania anthology DVD box set, I finally decided to give this wrestlemania a watch. Let's be totally honest, 1995 was arguably the worst year to be a WWF fan [Diesel was the champion, WCW Nitro was a MUCH better show with often MUCH better wrestling, The storylines were still very silly and cartoonish]. Despite being a wrestlemania, This show just didn't feel like a wrestlemania [Instead it felt like a three hour 1995 episode of Monday Night Raw with celebrities]. With the presence of celebrities of the time like Lawrence Taylor [who's in the main event for some reason.....], Jonathan Taylor Thomas, Pamela Anderson, Jenny Mccarthy, Salt-N-Pepa, and Nicholas Tutorro, This show did make an effort to keep the wrestlemania feel alive [although it failed]. Here's my match-by-match review:

1. Lex Luger and British Bulldog [RIP] VS. Jacob & Eli Blu
A boring opener. I don't really remember who their opponents were but i was hoping that this match would be decent since it did at least feature one of my all-time favorites in the late great British Bulldog. A VERY skippable match. Luger and Bulldog win. *1/2

2. For the WWF Intercontinental Championship
Champion Jeff Jarrett VS. Razor Ramon
An improvement over the previous match, This match was somewhat watchable at times as it did feature some pretty good action from both wrestlers. It wasn't really that good of a match but it was ultimately one of the best matches on this show. Razor wins by DQ when the Roadie [Who would later be known as Road Dogg in DX and who would later be known as BG James in TNA] interfered. ***. Now if only they could've put The 1-2-3 Kid in a match.......

3. The Undertaker VS. King Kong Bundy
Of all of The Undertaker's wrestlemania matches, This one definitely takes the cake as the worst. This was simply a short predictable big man's match and you'll be happy when the inevitable outcome of this match comes to pass. Undertaker wins and is 4/0 in his 19 wrestlemania victory streak. *1/2

4. For the WWF World Tag Team Championships
Champions The Smokin Gunns VS. Owen Hart [RIP] and Yokozuna [RIP]
Heading into this match, Nobody knew who Owen Hart's tag partner was gonna be but he announced that it was Yokozuna who at the time had been absent from WWF for a little while. Needless to say, this is one of the more watchable matches of this event and while it wasn't exactly great [or even good] it was at least satisfying to see the late great Owen win some gold. **1/2

5. I Quit Match
Bret Hart VS. Bob Backlund
Special Referee: Roddy Piper
If you're expecting a match like their underrated submission match at Survivor Series 94, Then you will be HEAVILY dissapointed! In what may be Bret's worst match of all time, Bret essentially has a squash match with Backlund that is actually the worst match of the night. Needless to say, Bret won this one. *

6. For The WWF World Heavyweight Championship
Champion Diesel VS. Shawn Michaels
This match was the ONLY worthwhile match on the whole show and this also should have been the main event. Although Diesel [Kevin Nash] wasn't exactly a good wrestler, he did put on a decent performance in this match although he was clearly outclassed by Shawn Michaels. This match was actually pretty good as it did have some nice action and it did keep you awake until the very end [Thanks also in no small part to the presence of Pamela Anderson and Jenny Mccarthy]. Needless to say, Shawn seriously should've won the title in this match as he clearly deserved it MUCH more than Nash. This match definitely saves this wrestlemania from getting a 1 star review from me and while this match took place on a bad show, I advise fans of either HBK or Kevin Nash to watch this match. Watch for the end of this match where Diesel botches the Jackknife Powerbomb. Although Shawn Michaels failed to win the title here, He would go on to win the WWF title at the next wrestlemania in a classic ironman match with Bret Hart. ****

7. Lawrence Taylor VS. Bam Bam Bigelow [RIP]
Similar to what would happen at wrestlemania 24 with Floyd Mayweather Jr. and The Big Show, A sports figure from another sport was brought in to have a feud with one of the WWF's stars and it was a halfway decent match. For what it was worth it was pretty entertaining to see how well LT could work in the ring [even though he was pretty stiff which was to be expected] and it did at least surpass most of the other matches on this show. Although Diesel-HBK should've been the main event instead, This did at least allow the late great Bam Bam Bigelow to main event a wrestlemania. LT wins following a second-rope clothesline. ***

Overall, This is the third worst wrestlemania of all time [Behind Wrestlemania 9 and 27, Both very awful and very forgettable]. Back in 1995, The WWF hit an all-time low point in their existence as they lost many of their biggest stars to WCW and to add to that their revenues took a big hit as they recovered from the infamous steroid scandal of the early 90's meaning that they could no longer pay their wrestlers the often lavish salaries that they paid them prior to the scandal. Believe it or not, Some see this wrestlemania as the event that helped to save the WWF and while this is partially true, It definitely isn't an event that WWF/E fondly looks back on [and with good reason]. I would only reccomend this to die-hard WWF fans. NOTE: As said before, I own this wrestlemania on DVD via the wrestlemania anthology box set and if you own that version, Then you won't get to see Salt-N-Pepa's performance before the LT-Bam Bam Bigelow main event. But, To my knowledge, The VHS versions have retained this performance.",1315180800,,5804,4.595559845559846
7886776,2,6305277001,"I was surprised this event took place at Connecticut's Hartford Civic Center. WrestleMaina is the biggest PPV of the year and it gets put into a small venue. Then again, this years WrestleMaina wasn't too exciting. Too many Hollywood actors, actresses, and NFL players and Vinnie Mac laugh after ever Lawler joke got to be real annoying after the first few matches.

British Bulldog and Lex Luger VS Eli and Jacob Blu: Not a bad opener but Luger and Bulldog didn't gel well together in this match. Luger scoop slammed one of the Blu boys onto Bulldog in the first few minutes. Not bad but not a great.

Double J VS Razor Ramon: I really hate Jarrett and I don't know why. I recently saw a few older matches of him in the WWF and I was quite impressed. Too much outside interference and the DQ ending was lame.

King Kong Bundy VS The Undertaker: Not Bundys best match and the Undertaker's WrestleMaina streak is alive and well.

Owen Hart and Yokozuna VS Smoking Gunns: The second best match on the card. All four men can wrestle a good match in an age where wrestling didn't really matter.

Bob Backlund VS Bret Hart: Roddy Piper yelling a mic every twenty or so seconds while a match is going on would be fine- if he was a commentator. This match sucked.

Shawn Michaels VS Diesel: Shawn carried Diesel thru out the match. A good match but Diesel is again put over because he is big and that what Vince likes. Forget that he almost put WWE under during his regin as champion. As a side note, I wonder why WWE had all those photographers at ringside.  It was a stupid and dangerous move. Shawn even threw one out of the way at one point.

Bam Bam Bigelow VS Lawrence Taylor: A cocky, loud mouth NFL player gets the babyface treatment to fight Bigelow in the main event. Taylor couldn't wrestle and kept on trying the same manuvers. Too bad Bigelow lost but he probably got a big paycheck in return. Many the NFL players on the outside would be employed by WCW a few years later. I wonder why they never had Taylor come in and wrestle.

But here is why I believe it to be the best of the best of Wrestlemanias. The number one reason is the massive amount of media coverage that can be found all over the ringside area. They had a tremendous amount of photographers all over. And that is what Wrestlemania is supposed to be all about, a mecca. A place to be. A happening. Even the interview areas backstage were jam-packed in some skits. They also provided a lot of celebrities. Former Home Improvement star Jonathan Taylor Thomas is there and can be found playing chess with Bob Backlund in the back at one point. NYPD Blue star Nicholas Tuturro conducts interviews with various superstars. Pamela Anderson was on hand to be in Shawn Michaels' corner when he faced Big Daddy Cool Diesel for the World Wrestling Federation Championship, as was stipulated by Michaels winning the previous January's Royal Rumble. Although, as it turns out, it is revealed that Michaels had previously tried to force Pam to get a tattoo. Pam didn't like it, and winds up in the corner of Diesel. Shawn does okay for himself, however, as he is later accompanied by Jennifer McCarthy. The whole angle was merely a storyline, however.

The I Quit Match is a rematch to the Throw In The Towel Submissions Match the two had at the previous November's Survivor Series. Yokozuna makes his return to the WWF at this event also, and helps Owen Hart capture his first WWF title, when they capture the World Tag Team Titles from Billy and Bart, The Smoking Gunns. Undertaker and King Kong Bundy have their match, set up from the Rumble. This match, like the one at the Rumble, set up another future match. At the Rumble, King King Bundy had gotten involved when 'Taker fought I.R.S, setting up the Wrestlemania match. In this match, Kama (previously known as Papa Shango, and later known as Kama Mustafa and The Godfather, and The Goodfather)steals the urn from the Undertaker, and later melts it into a necklace. This would result in a 'Taker/Kama Casket Match at Summerslam 1995.  Power And Glory, Lex Luger and The British Bulldog Davey Boy Smith's tag team, battle The Blu Brothers, Jacoub and Eli. ""The Bad Guy"" Razor ramon and Double J Jeff Jarrett have a rematch for the Intercontinental Title Match. Instead this time, not only did Jarrett have The Roadie in his corner, but Ramon  comes packing,too, bringing The 1-2-3 Kid with him. And of course, Bam Bam Bigelow and L.T. Lawrence Taylor have their big payoff from the angle they started at the Rumble. This match actually is the Main Event. L.T. has other NFL players serve as his back-ups, known as the All Pro Team. Bigelow, backed by The Million Dollar Man Ted Dibiase, has a team of superstars including Tatanka, King Kong Bundy, and I.R.S. at his side. This is a star and superstar packed Mania and should have a spot on every collector's shelf. 6 out of 5 stars!",1183507200,,3205,4.660777385159011
7886778,1,6305277001,"1. Lex Luger, British Bulldog vs Jacob and Eli Blue--

First RIP Bulldog AND everyone else on here all these wrestling reviews who passed so I want have to mention them all.. RIP!!.. Now on to this match.. It was NOT  a good match and it gets 1/2 star because it seemed to much filler material you'd see on Heat

2. Razor Ramon vs Jeff Jarrett- I read peoples reviews on this match.. Some liked some didnt.. I just didn't like this match very much.. It was very inconsistent in my eyes.. Had its spots but could have been better is all I got to say.. 1 1/2 star

3. Undertaker vs King Kong Bundy

Sorry Taker but this match was not good at all.. No decent finisher and was VERY boring!!! It gets 1/2 star

4. Smoking Gunns vs Owen Hart, Yokozuna for the Tag Titles-

In my eyes this was the best match on this card... It was fast paced.. Only slow when Zuna was in but that wasn't bad because they had to try to outsmart the big man etc... This was an amazing match in my eyes.. 3 stars

5. Hart vs. Backlund.. I Quit-- Hart deserved better.. This match sucked so bad.. I just don't know what to put here for this match.. Utter dissapointment.. 2 stars because Bret carried this match worth watching...

6. HBK vs Diesel for World Title-

- Considering the talent.. I didn't even like this match.. It had its spots but its inconsistencies overshadowed.. Too many restholds.. Not enough variations.. Weak jackknife.. I will give it some slack because it had spots and give it 2 1/2 stars

7. Lawrence Taylor vs Bam Bam Bigelow

- Bam Bam tried all he could to save this match.. But lets get serious this main event was VERY BORING... VERY SLOW PACED... Maybe one or two ""decent"" spots... and thats all I got to say.. 1 1/2 star= WORST WRESTLEMANIA MAIN EVENT IN THE HISTORY OF THE WWE....

In conclusion there were 2 matches that were Heat material.. And 2 matches Raw material.. The  2 WM matches material were Smokin Gunnz vs. Yoko.. And why I didn't put Diesel, Shawn is because the expectations were higher and not met in my eyes... Hart and Backlund make the list only because Bret carried this match to where I could watch it but it was almost like he faced himself against someone in the crowd in my opinion.. Still I watch this match just for Bret alone but of course Bret is my favorite wrestler of all time

Advice to all the ones who order Wrestlemania The Anthology- Watch Wrestlemania 11 last out of ALL the Wrestlemanias because it didn't meet Wrestlemania  material. If you watch it the only good matches in my eyes were Bret's because of Bret only.. And the Tag title match.. Razor and Jeff may consider some watching as some did like it.. I guess I will say HBK and Diesel for HBK fans.. Thats it for WM 11",1130025600,2,2722,4.328740157480315
7886779,2,6305277001,"WM 11 not be the worst WM but it's close. The undercard lacked some real quality wrestling and doesn't hold your interest.  I still find it very odd that Bam Bam Bigelow fought a football star for the main event.  Anyway, here's the run-down of the show.

1.  Lex Luger and the late British Bulldog vs Jacob and Eli Blue

- All you need to know is that Luger and the Bulldog carried the blue brothers throughout the match and got the victory.  Just another way to give Luger something to do until his contract expired.

Rating: 1/2

2.  Razor Ramon (a.k.a. Scott Hall) w/ 1-2-3 Kid (Sean Waltman) vs Jeff Jarrett w/ (Road Dogg) for the Intercontineal title

- Even though the first few minutes of the match started off with Hall throwing punches at Jarrett, the match ended up being a good wrestling match.  Jarrett focused on Razor's bad knee but also used some good technicial wrestling.  Not saying Hall didn't use any but Jarrett put on a better performance.  The match was fairly good.  Should've been the opener for the show.

Match: **

3.  Undertaker vs King Kong Bundy

- The whole storyline was the urn that Bundy stoled from the Undertaker at the Royal Rumble.  The match was very slow and contained a very stupid ending.  I like the bodyslam Taker gave to Bundy.  After the slam, Taker waited for Bundy to get up and delivered a flying clothsline for the victory.  WOW, no tombstone or chokeslam!?!?  The only real entertaining part is the angle where Dibiase and the Kama (a.k.a Godfather) reclaimed the urn after Taker snatched it from Dibiase at the start of the match.

Rating: 1/4

4.  Smoking Gunns vs the late Owen Hart and the late Yokozuna for the tag team titles

- Before the match Owen was giving a chance to have a mystery partner for his match, Owen revealed Yokozuna.  Oddly enough, Owen never won a title up to this point despite scoring an upset victory and a classic match with his brother Bret at the previous Wrestlemania.  The Gunns worked over Owen throughout most of the match until Yokozuna came in and that team pretty much dominated the rest of the match.  Yoko hit the Banazi Drop on a young Billy Gunn but got attacked by Bart Gunn.  Yoko was able to fight back and make a tag to Owen who teased us with a sharpshooter attempt but decided to just pin him for his first championship gold.  I'm glad that Owen finally got his due, but the match sucked and Owen didn't really get to do much.  The WWE decided that YokoZuna's days as a heavyweight champ are over and now he's stays in midcard hell for the rest of his life.  In fact, The Smoking Gunns carried them throughout most of the match.  I think it's sad that it took 4 years for Owen to get a title despite his classic bouts with his brother and being a KOTR a year ago.

Rating *

5.  Bret Hart vs Bob Backlund (I quit match) Roddy Piper as Ref.

- I don't know if was just me but this match did not hold my interest hardly at all. Match was full of restholds and was just too short which was unfortunate considering how good their feud has been and the fact that they had a much better match at the 1994 Survivor Series.  Hart oddly enough made Backlund surrender to his hold the Crossface Chickenwing.  Backlund then does the stupid ""I'm running for President"" angle for the rest of the year.  Other than some of Bret's great wrestling, Piper's officiating were the only high points to the match.

Rating: ** 1/4

6. HBK vs Diesel (Kevin Nash) for the World Title

- this was the time when WWE finally gave Shawn Michaels a big push that he had deserved for quite sometime.  HBK quickness and agility vs the raw power of Nash made a great main event match.  The action was fast paced, moves were accurate except for Nash's powerbomb, and it held the crowd's interest all the way through.  Even though Shawn was the heel, the crowd was behind him which is probably why WWE made him a good way a few weeks later.  The bad parts of this match were some of the restholds and a few deadspots.  Shawn had Nash beat with the sweet chin music, but the referee sprung his ankle when he jumped off the apron to break up the action on the outside of the ring.  Nash would recover a few minutes later to hit the powerbomb to retain his title.

Rating **** 1/4

7.  Lawrence Taylor vs Bam Bam Bigelow

- For those of you who are not familiar with the setup for this match, let me give you the story.  At the Royal Rumble, Bam Bam Bigelow lost in a tag team match and ended up getting pinned.  After the match, Bam Bam was able to leave the ring until he noticed LT was in the first row laughing at him.  Bam Bam was offended and ended up shoving LT to the ground.  Bam Bam issued a challenge to fight him and he accepted.  The match got alot of great publicity but the concern was on wither or not the match would be worth seeing.  The match ended up being a pleasant surprise.  Although Bam Bam carried the match, LT actually showed us some decent wrestling moves.  LT wins with a flying forearm from the top rope.  Bam Bam was soon kicked out of the Million Dollar Corp. for this match.  Rumor has it, Bam Bam was supposed to get a huge push after this but the clique (Hall, Nash, HBK, Waltman) protested and convinced Vince to give them their pushes without Bam Bam interfering.  Match wasn't anything spectular but Bam Bam deserves some props for putting LT over.

Rating ** 1/4

Bottom Line:  WM 11 is not a good show.  I'm glad Owen finally got a title even if it was just a tag title and Bam Bam got to do something useful in his WWE tenure but to job to a football player in the biggest show of the year was not good for his career.  Noone took him seriously after that.  The only thing really worth checking out is the Heavyweight title match b/w HBK and Nash.  Hall vs Jarrett was okay but they've had better matches and Bret's match doesn't hold a candle to his wm matches against Piper, HBK, and Austin.  You'll probably be spending most of the time fast forwarding the tape than watching it.  Just a bad venue.
