6410627,3,B00KAEIFCQ,"Rage is the right name for the viewer, ""Revenge"" would be more appropriate for the movie. I am very grateful to be able to watch this at home, as if I'd been in the cinema I would likely have mist the plot, and come away deaf.
I do not know who engineered this but the sound is lousy. I had to crank it up each time to hear the dialogue, but when the music, and effects (i.e. explosions, & gun fire) it was so loud my house rattled. The volume balance is out of whack, else is would have been at least entertaining.
Sorry Mr. Cage you need a better crew.",1405296000,15,554,4.0
6410628,4,B00KAEIFCQ,Good plot. Enjoyed it.,1405123200,,22,4.75
6410629,5,B00KAEIFCQ,"Cage plays a protective father who has been out of his criminal life since his wife passed away, and completely falls apart when his daughter (Caitlyn) goes missing, presumably kidnapped. Cage has to go back to his criminal lifestyle in order to solve the mystery of Caitlyn's disappearance. blah, blah, blah.

I went into this movie thinking that it would be a Trespass-esque Cage movie with the ironic hilarity of Wicker Man, and I couldn't be more happy to be disappointed. Nicolas Cage pulls out all of the stops for Rage. His Cage-isms, as I call them, are still present, but they are within the context of his character losing his mind as a desperate father; there were many times in the movie where my mouth was agape, mostly because if I were to watch Wicker Man and see this type of freakout, I would be on the floor laughing, peeing my pants. That is not the case in this movie.

Everyone else gives a stellar performance, which from the trailer you cannot tell at all. Every character, including Cage, is grounded in the Universe that this takes place and nobody steals the show more than another person.

When I recommend Nic Cage movies, I will recommend this movie over Face/Off hands down.",1404864000,27,1204,4.643192488262911

6410651,2,B00KAEIFCQ,"Wow... I'm left speechless after watching this train wreck of a movie. I guess Cage must've received another unanticipated IRS bill, because the problem with this movie is not necessarily what Cage is capable of, but the movie script and plot itself.

Everything about the movie screams amateur. Without giving away actual spoilers, let's just say that the script created some unintentionally hilarious moments that involved beating up a dead guy for interrogation, slicing up a guy just to hug him, and an attempt at conjuring up whatever sex appeal to teenage libidos by dialing up a weird and completely incoherent tension scene in the bedroom. Awkward.

In fact, awkward describes this movie through and through. Then there is the god-awful, anticlimactic ending. Here is my spoiler-free analogy. Imagine you go in to a restaurant and the chef claims to be serving lobster ravioli in a zesty white wine sauce. When the dish is served, the white sauce is neither zesty nor wine. Instead, the bland sauce had bits of peppers added in, and an occasional gummy worm just because. Then when you dig in to the lobster ravioli, SURPRISE! IT'S ACTUALLY TILAPIA!!

Two stars for unintentional comedic appeal and contribution to the compilation of Cage Rage moments.",1469145600,,1260,5.048076923076923

6410658,1,B00KAEIFCQ,"If it hadn't been for the ""plot twist,"" I might have given this one three stars. Even with the plot twist, the first 2/3 of the movie or so is a three star movie. Without resorting to spoilers, here's why I gave it one star.

1). Danny Glover pretty much plays Sgt. Murtaugh in this one, but his performance lacks any gusto. He doesn't actually say his trademark line ""I'm getting too old for this ****,"" but the tone of his entire performance is ""I'm getting too old for this ****."" He shadows Cage's character for the entire film, playing out that worn and tired plot of warning Cage that if he doesn't stop what he's doing right now, the consequences are going to be dire. Do the math, people. This isn't a Disney film. Take a wild guess at how things turn out, with or without Glover's stern warnings.

2). The first two thirds of the movie set themselves up and play out like a ""good"" Steven Seagal flick. I say ""good"" because I am sure that some of you aren't Seagal fans, and yeah...he's made more than his share of direct-to-DVD stinkers. Once again I won't spoil the film by revealing too much of the story but suffice it to say that if you have ever seen a ""good"" Seagal film, you will think you are watching one, UNTIL...

3). The PLOT TWIST. Ham-fisted, amateurish, a real ""face palm"" moment. The film telegraphs its punches early...YOU KNOW there is going to BE a plot twist...but when it comes, you almost want to stop the movie. But because you've watched 2/3 of it, you won't.

4). The exciting, dramatic, ""didn't see that coming"" climax. Of course, I'm being sarcastic. The ending spirals out of the plot twist, and it's pure garbage. It's what a screenwriter comes up with after he thinks he's crafted a clever plot twist but has then run out of ideas.

ONE star, and I am being generous. If you want / need to see a Cage film that delivers, watch ""Con Air,"" ""The Rock,"" or for a double dose of fun, hammy overacting, catch the double threat of Cage and Travolta in ""Face Off.""

""I'M CASTOR TROY!""

But in THIS turkey, he's not. Caveat Emptor.",1454025600,,2061,4.407894736842105

6410664,2,B00KAEIFCQ,"There are many excellent reviews of this movie that cover many aspects of it. The acting is good, but the story and put together of the movie leaves something to be desired. It's not a B movie - but maybe a B++ or A---. The ending is lousy - a true tragedy.

There are lots of great movies that can be watched over and over, but I'm afraid this isn't one of them. It isn't even that good as an action movie, just mechanical with bullets and blood dumped in over the top of it.

Someone in an earlier review compared it to ""Face Off"" - not even close. They are not even in the same ball park as far as action, excitement, story, and movie producing. I wouldn't even compare them by saying Face Off is better, as they are not comparable quality wise.

This could have been a great movie, but the writing and directing let it down big time. If you like sad, tragic movies, without real drama, this one will fit the bill. Personally I like a little more magic in the movies I watch and keep.

I'm a collector of movies but I will probably put this one on the selling block, as I can't think of any reason why I'd want to watch it again.",1445817600,,1132,4.108597285067873
6410665,2,B00KAEIFCQ,"Pauli (Nicolas Cage) is a former gangster who has gone straight and keeps Grecian Formula 14 in business. His daughter (Aubrey Peeples) goes missing and is later found dead. She was killed by a Russian Tokarev. In an attempt to find the killer the retired Pauli and two friends turn the town upside down, causing havoc to the Russian mafia.

Danny Glover has a small role as the policeman investigating the case. Rachel Nichols plays the part of his young second wife who loves the daughter as her own.

The location appears to be a small city, one where you wouldn't expect such a heavy influence of Russian mafia. There are numerous flashbacks to an event they believe is somehow connected to the present. The film had scenes that worked well, but the overall plot felt uneven, with an ending that made me feel I wasted my time watching the film.

Will have camp value second time through knowing the ending.",1439596800,,910,4.6397515527950315

6410669,3,B00KAEIFCQ,"In this 2014 film a successful business man who about a dozen years earlier was a killer who worked for a mob, a man who now gives much money to help build his community, finds out that his daughter, his only child, was shot in the head. He is understandably shocked, hurt, and angry. But his anger turns to rage, and he wants to learn who killed his 16-year-old and kill the killer(s).
He is warned by his previous mob boss and by a senior police officer who knows his past, but likes him, that he should leave the investigation to the police. He refuses to listen. He meets with his former two cohorts and the three agree to do all they can to discover the culprit or culprits. He tells his friends that they can use force to find the killer(s). The three do use force and are very brutal, but it soon becomes clear that with all the brutality and all the connections they still have, no one knows who killed the girl.
They soon come to believe, without any evidence, that a Russian crime boss, in a different gang than their prior boss, may be responsible, and a mob war develops.
There is lots of suspense in the film due to our not knowing the murderer(s) and much violence because of the brutality used to secure information and the retaliation.",1436659200,,1251,4.373390557939914

6410676,3,B00KAEIFCQ,"Critics and audiences alike have savaged this film, possibly because of its uncompromising (read: realistic) finale. I can think of no other reason.

The movie, directed by Hispanic Paco Cabezas who has a short track-record of few film credits and this likely is his best, turns the usual father's revenge story (think of Clive Owen in ""Trust"") on its head.  This is no typical blast 'em-and blow-'em-up action flick, but a TRAGEDY.  Never has a title captured the salient point of a movie better; The Nicholas Cage character loses it--and all sorts of others lose their lives because of it, despite (and this is a hallmark of true tragedy) the heartfelt sentiments of two supporting characters who in no-nonsense language, urge this man to simply ""walk away.""  Does he?  Nope.  Worse, his own very supportive wife helps him write his sad finis, too.

So, yeah, it's what we call today a ""downer."" but a good one.  Hats off to Cage--he loves to sink his teeth into a fleshy character--and this guy's a beaut.",1429660800,,1008,4.786127167630058

Rage had all the elements of a good gangster movie: bad good guys, good bad guys, guns, fighting, intrigue, and nary a bare breast to be seen.  Odd, eh?

6410760,3,B00KAEIFCQ,"Laying on her death bed, Paul McGuire (Nicholas Cage) promises his wife, that he will leave his life of organized crime behind to be there for his daughter. That all changes when a decade later his daughter goes missing. The gloves come off and McGuire connects with his old crew and goes after old enemies to find his daughter. This was an entertaining film, but I think it would have been so much better if it were less violent. I love violent action films as much as the next guy, but the story here calls for a more investigative approach, but all McGuire wants to do is beat people for answers. Nicholas Cage stars and is one of those action stars that never goes out of style. He's been going after the bad guys and surviving impossible odds for nearly three decades, becoming very good at it. Despite being an independent film, Rage has a huge cast with many notable names that really help the story along. In fact, with all the named actors in the film, I'm really surprised that Rage wasn't released in theaters. While being entertaining, Rage isn't anything you haven't seen before, as it's your typical who done it, with all the gun fire and explosions you'd expect from an action movie. The cast is experienced and very good, while the plot does have a back story and moves at a reasonable pace. Rage is one of those film where you don't really have to think and ultimately it is somewhat forgettable, but if you're looking for something to watch without having to think too much, than Rage is a perfect choice and it is currently streaming on Netflix.",1411171200,,1564,4.530035335689046

6410834,1,B00KAEIFCQ,"The trailer and the implied plot is very different from the actual movie. I can only imagine the writer/director was trying to make a statement. It failed miserably. This is not another knock-off of Taken. Its so slow, its not an action movie at all. Its a bunch of very angry men with guns killing each other for the wrong reasons.

I did not rent a movie to get a moral lesson about crime, guns and violence. I wanted the action movie shown in the trailer. There is an expectation, in that type movie, of there being a good guy and a bad guy. The good guy wins. The bad guy doesn't. Except there are no good guys in this movie unless you count the cop spewing sentimental philosophy and the other cops. And the ending made me realize I wasted that money and time on a intentionally misleading movie.",1406246400,5,801,4.34
6410835,5,B00KAEIFCQ,"Unrelentingly harrowing, bleak.  Not a false note anywhere.  Cage and his bride are equally fascinating to watch.  The outcome of this movie will make many viewers feel STUPID, ""I should have seen this coming.""  But I think it's a beautifully perfect ending.  The meaning is clear and should serve as a warning to all:  ONCE YOU ENTER A LIFE OF CRIME, IT FOLLOWS YOU FOREVER.  THIS TRAGEDY WAS HIS OWN FAULT.",1406246400,3,408,4.661971830985915
6410836,1,B00KAEIFCQ,"This is clearly the worst movie of Nick Cage's illustrious career. I don't even know where to begin. Terrible script, stilted and cliche'd dialogue, completely unrealistic action sequences (bad guys just standing there holding their guns and waiting to be shot by good guys, a motorcycle running a car off the road, what?) moments of just wanting to scream out, ""THIS MAKES NO SENSE!"".  Rachel Nichols who I liked in Continuum must be ruing the day she got involved in this movie as it may have essentially relegated her to a B level actress.  Her character was also completely nonsensical and added nothing to the plot other than providing another 'loved one' to shed some tears. I didn't care about a single character in this movie and I can only hope Cage fulfilled whatever mob contract or money laundering scheme that was needed to get him to do this movie and get back to something better.",1406160000,3,895,4.730769230769231

6410844,3,B00KAEIFCQ,"""No child should have to pay for their father's sins."" Paul Maguire (Cage) lived a life of crime and violence but has since reformed and is straight. He is doing everything he can to make a life free of violence and his past and just raise his daughter the right way. One night when he is out he is told that there was a break-in in his house and his daughter was taken. The police begin to investigate but to Paul they aren't doing enough, so he takes it upon himself to find who did this and make them pay. It's no surprise by now that you know how I feel about Nicolas Cage. I do have to say though that this is one of the better ones he has come out with lately (for me at least). I'm not exactly sure why I think this was a good one because the movie was a little generic and the idea has been redone a million times. There are some twists in this to make it seem fresh and they do work but again this is nothing all that original. It could be because of my dislike for Cage and my very low expectations for this but it was better then I expected it to be. The fact that it's so overdone makes it hard to review but I will say that if you are a fan of Nicolas Cage you will probably enjoy this more then me. Overall, generic but had a few twists to keep it interesting enough to keep you watching. I give this a B-.",1405555200,2,1320,3.9291044776119404

8656934,5,B00KAEIFCQ,"Didn't like how this ended. Probably better that it ended as it did, but I still didn't like it. Upon reflection, this is because of my prejudice, which is what must end. As I am often reminded, ""We don't see things as they are; we see things as we are."" If a short movie like this gets me to realize such an important lesson, I should rate it higher, and will. Just changed from two to five (four - just rated upward) stars. Prejudice is never becoming, even if seemingly justified, which it never is, for any of us. We are more connected than we are ready to admit. Peace and love is the only way. Strange this, after such a violence filled film, but the ending took me through this loop, for which I AM grateful.",1530057600,,715,4.226277372262774
