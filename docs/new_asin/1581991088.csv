It is a visually stunning, exhilirating look at one of the most beautiful and powerful jungle cats in the world.  It's filmed in the steamy rainforests of Belize in spectacular 35mm and gives you a glimpse into their magnificent world filled with colorful wildlife and brimming with gorgeous plantlife.  Sets were constructed over  100 acres so that every facet of this elusive jungle cat could be recorded on film.
If you love wildlife and big cats in particular, this is definitely the videotape to add to your collection.  Narrated by George Page and peppered with haunting sounds of the jungle, this is one tape you will want to view time and time again.  Filmed in letterbox format.",974419200,4,860,4.588235294117647
