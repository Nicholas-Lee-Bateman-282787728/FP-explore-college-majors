Although on VHS, if you have a VHS/DVD recorder, like me, you can easily dupe this to standard DVD and have a good copy since VHS is pretty dead as a format for viewing anything.
The VHS quality is good and sound is good. Narration is well done!
Highly recommended if you are a Jayne Mansfield fan like me.",1426377600,2,438,4.104651162790698
7904761,5,B000006Q92,"This A&E Biography of the glamorous and eccentric Jayne Mansfield who died June 29th 1967 of a fatal car accident is a very accurate and rather intimate account of Jayne's life. With ex- husband Mickey Hargitay, yes that is Mariska Hargitay's father and Jayne was her mother, recalling their marriage, their three children in which they were also in Jayne's car when she died, but were not badly injured and Jayne's immense and unusual larger than life image and personality. Jayne is often compared to THE #1 sex goddess of all time, Marilyn Monroe. While Jayne physically resembled Marilyn Monroe, the two women were really rather very different. Monroe gave off an innocence, a vulnerability and magical presence. Jayne's image was tougher, more false and a little threatening to American men in the 50's, whereas Marilyn did not seem threatening at all. While Marilyn's image said ""look, but don't touch"" Jayne's image simply said ""devour me"" thus more of a put-on. However, Jayne held her own and a big difference between the two was that Jayne could bear children, she had five altogether, while Marilyn could not but desperately wanted to. Jayne was a very loving and attentive mother despite her career. Jayne's first child, Jayne Marie Mansfield, was born when Jayne was only seventeen with her first husband, Paul Mansfield. Jayne kept her married name of her first husband because she said that it ""sounded like a star"". She was born Vera Jayne Palmer on April 19th, 1933. Lovely Jayne was just thirty-four when this horrible accident robbed her of her life. She will always be remembered and live on in the hearts of those who loved her, including her fans. A must see!",1243296000,3,1681,4.901754385964912
7904762,3,B000006Q92,"I agree with Sandra Preston's review of this movie, but can only give it 3 stars due to the quality of the picture (5 stars for content, 1 star for picture quality).  The color is all washed out, and some of the color scenes you can hardly tell are in color.  This surprised me since generally speaking, A&E does a superb job on the quality of the production.",1075248000,,359,4.264705882352941
7904763,5,B000006Q92,"I first saw this documentary on A&E and was excited that a program  decided to FINALLY pay homage to an almost forgotten and overlooked star of  Hollywood. I grew up in the 1950's and I never even knew much about Jayne  Mansfield. Most of the time she was immediately linked to Marilyn Monroe as  sort of a copycat. Jayne held her own and her story was inspiring for those  who want to achieve a goal that seems impossible. However, her life took  some unexpected turns , but she always stayed a trooper to her popularity.  This documentary chronicles her rise and fall on the Hollywood scene like  no other program concerning a star that remains a legacy. I became an  instant fan and have remained one since. Her talent didn't always lay in  film, but she was a wonderful comic actress on television and for the  troops during Bob Hope's U.S.O. tours. I encourage anyone to see this video  and you won't be sorry for the choice made. Watch it and this bio. will  amaze you about the Blonde Bombshell that could have been more. Thank you  A&E and Amazon.",959299200,10,1055,4.484210526315789
