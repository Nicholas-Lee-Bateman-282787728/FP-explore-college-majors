The second one, which I saw, was a nice story for fans of the Pokemon series, which I used to enjoy. So, I guess you can say I enjoyed the film as well. The first movie, which I saw, too was the best one to my opinion. The story seemed much more constructed then the other ones. It is nice to have them ALL in one set. Fans of the movie will deffinatley buy that. Just like STAR WARS. I am a BIG fan of the movies, and bought the boxed set. It is nice to have good movies all in one set. I think that this will be a good seller!",996105600,2,646,3.828358208955224

7945505,1,B00005MHOI,"I will never buy anything from Amazon again.  I placed an order on Dec. 5th and the item was in stock.  When the item did not arrive as of 12-18 I called to see what the problem was.  They told me it would not arrive until after Christmas.  Unacceptable!  I asked that they ship the two items I ordered 2-day at no extra cost to me, they said they could only get one item to me now and the other after Christmas.  I said okay, but at no extra cost to me, they again said no.  I canceled my whole order!  They are horrible at customer service!  If you order this item, I am told on the phone (not on the web) that it will take 1 - 3 weeks!  Don't buy from these people!",1197936000,,668,3.8814814814814813
7945506,5,B00005MHOI,"They are short and yet entertaining for all kids.  The only part is that if you want to watch the movie, you have to skip ahead through the Pikachu Adventure manually.  Not very kid-friendly.  Thanks!",1174953600,,200,4.6571428571428575
7945507,5,B00005MHOI,"Although we own all the video games and tons of cards, and watch the TV show, I was trying to avoid buying the DVD movies. Then came the day when we just had to have them. And not just some of them, of course, but all eight. I won't talk about the content itself, because the quality is somewhat uneven, but if you have to have them, and you know you do, this three pack is a little easier, and a little cheaper, than getting them separately.",1163030400,,442,4.091954022988506
7945508,4,B00005MHOI,"My 4 year old LOVES Pokemon, in a big way. These movies had a colorful variety of all the Pokemon. And they presented a good moral at the end of each movie. I thoroughly enjoyed these movies with my child, and would recommend it to any child that likes to see new creatures, or Pokemon :)",1142208000,3,288,4.160714285714286
7945509,5,B00005MHOI,"Well now I am not much of a Pokemon fan as I used to be. Before when I saw these movies I thought they were great! Yea it can get boring in some parts but in all it's pretty good. Personally I liked the second movie the best. Then the first. The 3rd got a little boring for me. But that might be becuz I started loosing intrest to Pokemon or in other words, Pocket Monsters. In all I would buy this set.",1046304000,2,403,3.8674698795180724

Anyway I have seen all four of the pokemon movies and enjoyed them all. If I were to rank them from best to worst it would be as follows..Pokemon The First Movie, Pokemon 4ever, Pokemon 3 and finally Pokemon 2000. Since this set does not have part 4 (Due for release in March 2003) I will only review the 3 in this set.
Pokemon The First Movie is by far the best of the original 3 as well as the mini movie. The mini movie was nothing more than a great comedy caper to prepare you for the somewhat darker atmosphere of the first movie. If you have yet to see a pokemon tv episode it dosnt matter. You'll like this movie greatly. Mew's clone created by Giovanni of team rocket now self conscious wants nothing more to do with giovanni or the human race for that matter. After destroying the lab and fleeing to a nearby island Mewtwo clones his own army of pokemon intent on taking over the human race or eliminating them. One of the best lines in this movie is when Jessie, James and Meowth are witnessing the birth of the clones as the clone sillohuete passes by James utters ""Who's that pokemon?!"". Priceless. If you don't understand that joke you have never seen the tv show.
Pokemon 2000 is my least favorite of the bunch. I only seen it like two times so I don't remember much about it other than it deals with three legendary bird type pokemon. And Sloking utters a very funny line that had nothing to do with anything that had gone on in the movie since. ""I could use some pants now"" not an exact quote but funny none the less.
Part 3 alot better. Entei was just insane. Makeing that little girl wish for her mommy come true in the wrong way. He kidnaps Ash's mom and the little girl thinks she's her mom. Of course Brok falls for the little girl as a teenager. She wished she could be older and got her wish compliments of Entei. Anyway I only seen this one once so there is no funny quote as I am sure there is one. To review Part one the best, part two the worst and part 3 a very good one indeed. Now if whoever owns the rights to these movies please re-relaese them on dvd with commentaries on all 3, widescreen presentations on all 3 as well as the original Japanese language versions of all 3. Get with it you studios.",1045699200,,2370,4.222466960352423
