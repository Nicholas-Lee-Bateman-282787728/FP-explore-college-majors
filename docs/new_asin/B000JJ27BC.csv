2670632,3,B000JJ27BC,"The Mask of Fu Manchu, like most Fu Manchu films, has always been a bit of a disappointment to me, especially in light of the potential the character and stories offered. Yet in its uncut, restored and very politically incorrect version recently released on DVD it plays considerably better, if only because the stereotyping adds a historical interest to the piece. Curiously there's very little belittling of Chinese beyond the odd line like ""They have ways in the East..."" Mostly it's Karloff's Fu belittling the Westerners and promising to send them to their Christian heaven - after he and his perverted daughter Myrna Loy have had their way with them. For Karloff that means feeding salt water to a parched man tied under an endlessly ringing bell while to Loy that means whipping the best looking hostages before getting down and dirty with them. Some dodgy English accents and bad Chinese make-up highlight the unreality, but there's also some striking production design and the film at least taps into the sado-masochistic attraction/revulsion that is such a key part of Sax Rohmer's original novels.

Mark of the Vampire may have lavish MGM production values and Bela Lugosi reprising his vampire shtick, but it's all too typical hackwork from Tod Browning. Unlike his Dracula, this moves at a lightning pace - too fast, in fact, for us to ever get involved in the characters or plot or for it to conjure up any atmosphere - but still manages to be dull and uninvolving, with the typical 30s trick ending just adding to the general air of disappointment. The main remaining point of interest is Lionel Barrymore's performance, which seems to have served as a template for every vocal inflection and mannerism Jack Nicholson has inflicted on unfortunate audiences for the past quarter of a century since giving up acting for panto. Still, it does include a historical audio commentary and a trailer featuring Bela Lugosi summoning the audience to their local movie house that's far more fun than the movie itself.",1165104000,12,2021,4.961651917404129

Director Tod Browning's ""Mark of the Vampire"" (1935) resembles a murder-mystery with gothic sequences  beautifully rendered by cinematographer James Wong Howe. The vampiric presence of Lugosi remains chilling. Produced by Irving Thalberg, ""The Mask of Fu Manchu"" (1932) contains one of Karloff's finest performances. MGM's gloss adds to the  stylized depravity. Politically incorrect to the extreme yet decadent fun.

2670655,4,B000JJ27BC,"Mark of the Vampire, a 1935 film with Lionel Barrymore as the professor called in to investigate the murder that the viewer is convinced is just another horror film where a vampire is blamed for the death of Mr. Karrel, a rich man in the hills around Czechoslovakia, (not 100% sure of the location, central Europe for sure), with Barrymore in the Van Helsing role.

But things are not as they seem.  The Baron, played by Jean Hersholt, is apparently above suspicion, saying Karrel was his friend.  Hes also a friend of Karrels daughter, who is distraught.

The usual villagers are afraid.  The usual cops are scoffing.  Everything that is usual in a horror film, right down to the fog, moaning and Luna & the Count Mora (Bela Lugosi with his evil grin and staring eyes) lead you to think this is a typical horror film.

Its been said some critics did not like the ending, that it was a cop-out.  I don't think so.  It was fun that this murder mystery had a twist ending that if anything is a parody of horror films.  This was filmed a few years after Lugosis Dracula, also directed by Todd Browning.

No spoilers but be assured not is all as it seems.  Barrymore is sly and clever as the visiting professor but most characters are really throw-aways and could have been better developed.  The ending saves it.

-----------------

The Mask of Fu Manchu

Yowza, what a cool, campy collection of crazy hijinks, with Boris Karloff as the evil Fu Manchu, an Oriental with a taste for the sadistic and who has a strange way of entertaining his guests.

Karloff is after the location of the burial place of Ghengis Khan, ruler of Mongolia and the Eastern world.  Fu Manchu believes that with the mask and sword of Fu Manchu the yellow peril (as the Westerners think) will sweep across Asia and wipe out the white race.

Yep, plenty of racist overtones in this film, and during the decades were chopped out.  They are all here in this DVD set.

Enter a British spy, his daughter (played screamingly and hysterically by Karen Morely), and a few other throw-away character actors.  Jean Hersholt appears in this one too as well as the Baron in the earlier Mark of the Vampire.

Without writing out the whole plot, I was highly entertained by not only the high production values of light, shadow and music, but of the myriad ways Fu Manchu devised.  How does he fit all those torture rooms into a small building in Peking?

Myrna Loy plays the sexual sadist, who wants to play with the boys as they get whipped by large black men who look amazingly like the Oscar statuettes.  Great to see Myrna in something other than the foil for William Powell in The Thin Man series.  Great acting and atmosphere.

The torture of the bell, the alligator teeter totter, and the fingers of death are a few of the awesome machines.

Bottom Line:  If you can handle what the censors of the time could not, with the torture and the racist overtones, you will enjoy this great, campy addition to the filmography of Boris Karloff.

Both DVDs have some great commentary tracks, but no other special features.",1387238400,2,3077,4.570383912248629
2670656,4,B000JJ27BC,"MGM was famous for family fare, glossy dramas, and intelligent musicals--but during the 1930s horror films were all the rage, so it is no surprise the studio took an occasional crack at the genre.  The result was seldom memorable, but along the way the studio did manage to generate at least three minor classics, each of them remarkably notorious in their day: FREAKS, MAD LOVE, and the 1932 THE MASK OF FU MANCHU.

Based on the characters created by novelist Sax Rohmer, Dr. Fu Manchu (Boris Karloff) has determined to consolidate all the powers of Asia by obtaining the mask and sword of legendary Genghis Kahn.  He is assisted in this by his daughter Fah Lo See (Myrna Loy), and indeed it is hard to know which is more depraved.  When an English expedition actually obtains the mask and sword, Fu Manchu and his daughter resort to torture to obtain the items--and the tortures are memorable indeed, ranging from an endlessly tolling bell to a crocodile pit to moving walls of silver knives.  Perhaps the single most disturbing torture sequences involve the handsome young expedition member Terry (Charles Starrett.)  He is first stripped half naked, hung by his hands from the ceiling, and viciously whipped while Fah Lo See screams ""Faster!  Faster!""  Later he is reduced to a loin cloth, secured to a table by clamps, and wiggles in an effort to escape as he is pawed by Fu Manchu.

By all accounts the production of THE MASK OF FU MANCHU was shambles, and the resulting film is uneven, but frankly pre-code films of the early 1930s just don't get any more kinkier or any less politically incorrect than this one, and the frequently cut scenes and bits of dialogue have been restored.  ""Kill the white man and take his women!"" Fu Manchu shouts to his leering Mongol horde.  The DVD has the bonus of a particularly interesting audio commentary by film historian Greg Mank, who notes that Karloff seemed to regard the film as a lark and Loy described the script as ""obscene.""

And then there is THE MARK OF THE VAMPIRE, a 1935 made when censorship was in full force.  In some respects it is an interesting film.  It based on the ""lost"" Lon Chaney film LONDON AFTER MIDNIGHT, and inasmuch as both were created by the same director, Todd Browning, it gives us a notion of what the Chaney film might have been like.  The film also has several interesting performances, particularly two largely silent performances by Bela Lugosi as Count Mora and Carroll Borland as Luna, and it further developes the ""Dracula"" imagery in a number of remarkable ways, most particularly in terms of how Luna is presented.

Unfortunately, the script is so ridiculously uneven that it becomes difficult to follow the story line.  Essentially, several years earlier Sir Karell Borotyn (Holmes Herbert) was mysteriously murdered, two fang marks found on his throat.  Now that his daughter  Irena (Elizabeth Allan) is about to be married, equally dangerous forces seem to be gathering around her in the form of Count Mora and his daughter Luna.  Fortunately, Professor Zelen (Lionel Barrymore) arrives on the scene, ready to battle the undead.  But can he?  And are they?  What exactly IS going here?  As Dorothy Parker so infamously said on a different occasion, ""There's less here than meets the eye,"" and the end result is singularly unspectacular.  Fortunately, THE MARK OF THE VAMPIRE is at least entertaining in a visual sense, and it also has a memorable audio commentary by historians Kim Newman and Steve Jones.

THE MASK OF FU MANCHU is probably a must-have for fans of 1930s horror, THE MARK OF THE VAMPIRE not so much.  Even so, both are worth watching, with FU MANCHU the clear winner when it comes to jaw-dropping viciousness and kink.  Recommended.

2670660,3,B000JJ27BC,"Mark of the Vampire

(Contains Spoilers)

This 1935 Universal movie directed by Tod Browning is one that i've been curious about for a long time, particularly after having seen various classic stills of Bela Lugosi & Carol Borland many times in various horror film books over the years.
At only 1hr long, it's a short movie which was apparently quite heavily edited, but he basic plot takes place in a village near Prague, & concerns the murder of a nobleman, who's death is believed by many of the villagers to've been caused by legendary vampires Count Morla (Lugosi) & his daughter Luna, (Borland) from the local castle. This belief is dismissed by the authorities, but after the nobleman's daughter Irena is attacked by Luna, further suspicion is cast, which is fuelled further by a local Van Helsing-esque Professor.
The great strength of this movie lies in it's iconic imagery, particularly evident in 'Luna' who was quite clearly the model for later 'daughters of darkness' from 'Vampira' to 'Morticia'. And also for it's superb cinematography, which IMO is far superior to both Browning's 1931 Dracula, & it's spanish made companion. The scenes featuring Borland look really good. Even today they're fabulously eerie. The first scene with Lugosi, where Count Morla & Luna are walking silently, almost as if hynotised, through the ancient ruins of the castle are very remeniscent of 'Dracula', complete with cobwebs, insects, & bats & so on, & it's further enhanced by some great spooky sound effects. This effect is further augmented in the follwing scenes where Luna encounters travellers in a horse drawn carriage on her way to attack Irena. Borland looks the very epitome of the gothic vampiress. In the light of the Addams Family, i can see why many people would find it totally corny, but i think it really works. Even though we see several examples of Lugosi's famous malevolent leer during their scenes together, it's the ghostly, hypnotic Luna that i'm drawn to when they're on screen. There's another effective moment later when we see Morla transform from a bat out the swirling mist, before advancing menacingly on the servants. Later, when the Professor & the police inspector investigate the castle, backed by some highly atmospheric organ music which is incorporated into the scene, the film pre-empts Stephen Somers by 70yrs, when we see Luna descend from above with giant bat like wings, like the 3 brides of Dracula in 'Van Helsing'. Obviously, there was no CGI in 1935, but cleverly photograhed as it is, as a fairly long shot, it looks pretty damn good for it's time!  Luna even hisses like Christopher Lee's Dracula in one scene!
But despite all the supernatural ambiance that makes this a recommended film for anyone interested in the vampire movie genre, IMO the plot resolution at the end, seriously spoils everything that makes this film so watchable.......
The whole thing turns out to be an elaborate sham set up by the Inspector & the Professor to catch the murderer. In the final scene we even Lugosi & Borland as the hired actors that were employed by the police inspector.
This 'rational' explanation really degrades the film for me. It goes even further than Universal's 'Dracula's Daughter' (see the 'Dracula Movies' thread) in debunking the possibility that vampires might exist. It annoys me because it's so patronizing & condescending to the viewer. Surely even in 1935, Hollywood didn't really imagine that people actually really believed in vampires did it? It makes the film such a cop out for those who enjoy the escapism that the fantasy provides. I had no idea that the film was going to end this way, & i was disappointed!
However, despite such an anaemic ending, i liked the film a lot for the other reasons that i've outlined, but all things considered, it does make it difficult to rate. I would've given it a 7.5/10, but it has to lose at least a point for the ending, so i ultimately award 6.5/10.

The Mask of Fu Manchu

'The Mask of Fu Manchu'. (1932)

Somewhere beneath the sands of the Gobi Desert lies the Orient's greatest treasure - the grave & relics of Genghis Khan. Ancient legend says that whoever possesses his sword, scepter & mask will lead the East in the conquest of the world. The insidious Dr. Fu Manchu, Asia's most evil criminal genius, does not know the location of the hoard, but he knows how to set a cunning trap to lure specialists from the British Museum who do know the secret. With his wicked daughter by his side, he plans to stop at nothing in his quest for world domination, once Genghis' mask becomes The Mask of Fu Manchu.
Sax Rhomer's Fu Manchu stories are very much fantasy/adventure rather than fantasy/horror, & the character was brought to life for me by Christopher Lee, who starred as Fu Manchu is a series of films during the 60's, which i remember watching when i was a kid. I bought the films on dvd a few years ago & i was delighted that they still stood up as good entertainment.
This is a film that i was previously unaware of, & i probably wouldnt've bought it on it's own, but as it's part of a double bill with 'Mark of the Vampire', i thought of it as a bonus, especially as it stars my favourite actor from the Universal films; Boris Karloff as Fu Manchu.
Karloff's not bad as Fu Manchu, but IMO even he pales into relative insignificance at the side of Christopher Lee's portrayal. He doesn't have the starch, ruthless quality that Lee brings to the role, & doesn't look the part in the same way that Lee with his slightly devilish appearance does. Karloff's portrayal is ok, but it leans more towards an Emporer Ming type of villian, & edges into the panto-esque just that little bit too much for my taste.
It's still a watchable film even though it does come across a bit old fashioned, but it's not something i'll probably watch many times in the future. There's nothing really wrong with it, but it's no more than average entertainment. Ok for a lazy Sunday afternoon, or something. 5/10",1190419200,10,5998,4.751439539347409
2670661,3,B000JJ27BC,"This DVD set consists of 2 horror films from MGM who were not famous for their products in this genre.

The first is ""The Mark of the Vampire"", a remake of a lost Lon Chaney film called ""London after Midnight"".  If ever a film was butchered between preview and release, this is it.  It was cut from 80 to 60 minutes and there are so many holes in the continuity that it becomes a farcical mess.  To top it off, it switches from horror to detective story in the blink of an absurd eye and the resolution is nonsense.  Lionel Barrymore is the star and he gives a rich display of familiar mannerisms.  When he was good, he was great, but when he was bad, ugh...  The DVD comes with a rotten commentary with 2 enthusiasts vying for who can interrupt the other the most.  They speculate endlessly about the film and provide very little facts except the obvious.  At least we have consistency - poor film, poor comments.  The best bit in fact, is the trailer, which promises so much more than is delivered.  Poor Bela Lugosi has more dialogue in the trailer than he does in the film!

""The Mask of Fu Manchu"" is a masterful pre code production full of racist slurs, perverted sex and masochistic cruelties.  Boris Karloff plays Manchu and is a model of inscrutable evil. Myrna Loy provides solid support as his perverted daughter.  Best of all, this print has been cut from the original negative so the film survives in its original version with all cuts, dialogue or otherwise, restored in a pristine print.  A masterful commentary is included and the commentator is able to tell us about the cuts, the production problems and many first hand comments from the cast about their involvement.  He does a superb job.

The production values of both films are excellent for these are MGM products. The set is only OK value because one film is as poor as the other is good.",1187222400,4,1862,4.494047619047619

8150459,4,B000JJ27BC,"Mark of the Vampire was directed by Tod Browning who also directed 1931s Dracula.  The film was a remake of Brownings lost silent film London After Midnight which starred Lon Chaney Sr.  Punctuated by an outstanding cast featuring Lugosi, Lionel Atwill, Lionel Barrymore, and Elizabeth Allan, its one of Lugosis best yet most underrated films.  While his role isn't huge, his presence can be felt throughout.

Sir Karell Borotyn is murdered in his home and found with two small punctures in his neck.  The doctor who examines the body concludes that he was killed by a vampire.  When Borotyns daughter Irena becomes the next target, Karells best friend Baron Otto von Zinden sends for an expert in vampires and the occult, Professor Zelen (Barrymore) to help track down the undead fiends.  The eyes of suspicion fall upon Count Mora (Lugosi) and his daughter Luna (Carroll Borland), two very weird and creepy figures that live in a nearby mansion.

Sure enough when Zelen spies on Morla and Luna, he finds a mansion straight out of a gothic nightmare with giant spiders crawling, bats flitting about, and even Luna sprouts bat wings and flys.  In the end though, Browning dishes up a swerve that reveals Morla and Luna to be mere actors pretending to be vampires in order to help catch the true killer.  The horror elements work well because Browning never revealed his twist to the actors until the very end so they all played it as if it was a straight horror film.  Lugosi felt the twist was silly but as always he gave 100% in his performance.

Mark of the Vampire has some of the most ghoulish scenes of horrors Golden Age.  The scenes in Morlas mansion and of him and Luna in a cemetery are spectacular and rival or even surpass that of Draculas brides rising from their coffins in Dracula.  The films greatest strength is its atmosphere although the twist ending does take the edge off somewhat.

Youll notice that Morla has a bullet wound on the side of his head throughout the film but there is no explanation ever given as to why.  In the original script, Morla was to have had an incestuous relationship with Luna, resulting in his committing suicide and rising from the dead as a vampire.  Of course, the studio balked, particularly after Brownings previous film, Freaks, had been such a disaster for MGM.  This is why the original running time of 80 minutes is cut down to 60 minutes, and leaves the film with numerous plot holes.

Borland was only 20 when she did the film and even though she has only got one line, she became a cult hero to horror fans.  Borland got the role after becoming friends with Lugosi while she was a student at UC Berkeley.  And while Lugosi was merely a red herring and didn't play a true vampire, it nevertheless was one of his more chilling and potent performances.",1411776000,3,2810,4.647773279352227
