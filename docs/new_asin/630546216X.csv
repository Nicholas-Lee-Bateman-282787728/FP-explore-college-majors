7890170,5,630546216X,"""IMAX Presents - The Great Barrier Reef"" has beautiful photography of the Great Barrier Reef near Australia. The music in the background drowns out the commentators voice much of the time though. But the pictures alone is worth the price of the DVD.",1375488000,,249,4.813953488372093
7890171,1,630546216X,"The absolute worst reef documentary I've ever seen.  As short as it is, a lot of time is wasted on silly pretentious landside footage.  The main feature of the program is poorly lit underwater footage showcasing Ron and Valerie destroying coral and harassing marine life while exhibiting sloppy, careless diving skills.  The university of Minnesota should be embarrassed to put their name on this.  Unbelievable!  To top it off, we're expected to sit through not one, but TWO obligatory ""shark shock"" scenes.  During the stupid ""shark shock,"" be sure to have the remote handy to turn the thundering noise down or brace yourself for a headache.",1123459200,20,643,5.018867924528302

7890173,2,630546216X,"I was very disappointed that the DVD is not widescreen although it claims to be. When I watch it on my widescreen TV I have two big bands on each side of the screen. However, the film and music are beautiful. I would give  it five stars for the content. If you don't have a widescreen TV then I  highly recommend it.",944092800,21,316,4.080645161290323
