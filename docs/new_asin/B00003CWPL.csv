1269364,5,B00003CWPL,"This is one of the most haunting and beautifully made movies I think that's ever been made.  The story and the symbols continue on and on and never seem to tire of new interpretations.  Henry is haunted by his own  problems and contemplates the most ultimate of self-destructive behaviour.  I think this movie deserves a premier place in cinematic history as the  most visually and symbolically rich film of the latter half of the 20th  century.  It's a masterpiece that I believe is duplicated in Lynch's recent  movie Lost Highway.  LH is essentially a re-make of Eraserhead but  obviously murder, in Lynch's eyes, doesn't quite capture the depression and  horror of suicide.  Both movies take place within the mind of the main  characters.  In the end Eraserhead is by far the better movie and the  better story because it was ground breaking.  You can't rate this movie on  the scale provided.  It surpasses the scale for sure.",952992000,5,931,4.821656050955414
1269365,5,B00003CWPL,"This is not a strange movie, if you watch it with that in mind you won't see it for what it is: a smart, funny, satyrical, complex, disturbing, and beautiful masterpiece. Lynch spent five years of his life on ERASERHEAD,  which might be why it is one of the greatest films in cinema history.",952732800,5,291,4.388888888888889
1269366,5,B00003CWPL,"David Lynch's debut is definitely something everyone should see, are they interested in artistic cinema. ""A dream of dark and troubling things"", as Lynch describes it, it is indeed written and filmed with  the logic and coherence of a nightmare - and when you're through dreaming,  you start wondering what it all really meant.
Like Andrei Tarkovsky often  did, Lynch deliberately tells us as very little of what's actually going  on, and it makes it much more interesting than most films; the audience  gets to construct a whole out of the pieces and is allowed to think  further, beyond what's actually said, and that's what makes artist and  audience into equals in the interpretation of the film.
Whether you're  interested in art film, cult film or horror, you must pick this up. Not for  everyone, though.",952646400,5,811,4.904411764705882
1269367,5,B00003CWPL,"David Lynch's first movie is by far the weirdest movie ever made. But if you can watch it without going mad, you will discover that there is alot of metaphors and symbols that make the movie more fascinating and fun with  every time you watch it. Its far scarier than any typical horror movie  because it messes with your mind and it plays on your imagination. It also  lulls you into a state of pure shock when you begin to feel the whole movie  is a nightmare of yours. This movie is filled with wonderful imagery,  beautiful cinematography and also appeals to the cult-filmgoer. Watch it  and love it.",951868800,6,604,4.495412844036697
1269368,5,B00003CWPL,"I've never liked David Lynch's stuff. 'Twin Peaks' was a totally left-field affair that never attracted my attention. Still, his 1977/78  'Eraserhead' is the exception for me. A bizarre hybrid of visual lullabye and sonic nightmare, this film is on par with 'Vampyr' in terms of its  concealment of any plot line. What you get instead is a string of images  that contribute to an overrall impression of the printer's world. He's 'on  holiday' from work, terrified of fatherhood and is being slowly eaten alive  by his own sense of perceptions regarding the mindscape he is trapped  within. I always watch this very late at night because I believe that the  images will soothe me and implant interesting mental sequences in my  slumber hours. Shot in black and white, they present themselves as some of  the most memorable in cinema history. The movie's score is droning at  times, thundering at others, occasionally helped along by the shrill  squeals of the dolphin-like offspring of the pathetic, stack-haired  'protagonist'. The true beauty of this picture is that you have to watch  everything over and over again to glean more. You can never really hope to  'get the point' of the work in its entirety but what you do manage to  decipher in the film is worth retaining in your memory banks. The acting  conforms to a style not seen since Bertolt Brecht wrote and the dialogue is  minimal. I would surmise that drug-oriented people would have a dull time  here as the effects of the chemicals and the power of the film would likely  cancel each other out. Definitely worth seeing at least once in your  life.....",951696000,27,1616,4.807272727272728
1269369,3,B00003CWPL,"This is quite possibly the strangest movie I have ever seen, however, its also David Lynch's first movie, so its justified. The movie is about how Nance and Stewart have a deformed chicken creature-like baby that just  screaches all of the time. The scenes with the baby are very disturbing,  and eerie. Nance is also visited, intermitantly, by an angel like women who  lives in his radiator! He also has several dreams within dreams. Thats the  movie's plot, yeah I know its weird, but altogether its a good movie,  although impossible to follow. It can only be enjoyed as a Lynchian vision  of an over-industrialised society and what the effects of that lifestyle  have on us all. Well worth viewing, but keep an open mind.",951177600,5,725,4.752
1269370,4,B00003CWPL,"This is without a doubt the strangest movie I have ever seen.  It has no violence, no bad language, and very little sex, yet it is probably the most disturbing movie I have ever seen.  It is done in black and white and is  almost a silent movie.  This makes no sense what so ever.  I guess it is  good in the fact that it makes you feel different and it disturbs you.  Get  it, you will think different of movies.",950486400,,413,4.012345679012346
1269371,4,B00003CWPL,"This was a strange--yet good--David Lynch film to view.  Not only does the low exposure B&W film make it all the more foreboding and better, but the visuals--such as Henry's infant child--add to the overall mystery of  the film.  A little hard to follow here and there, but if you start looking  over what your mind recorded when you watched it, thousands of conclusions  can be formed.  Overall, a great David Lynch film.  Buy it, rent it, JUST  PLAIN WATCH ERASERHEAD. --Matt Fore FilmGuy102@aol.com",949708800,,501,4.880952380952381

1269536,5,B00003CWPL,"I watched something called Eraserhead 2000, which isn't available here. This is a review of that item.

The film looks great, with a nice luminosity test at the beginning. The story is fantastic with all of its nuances. Since the days when this was released, we've seen quite a few new David Lynch items, including his TV series Twin Peaks, so se can see what came from this and what didn't. The mounds of dirt... some zig-zag flooring... crackling bulbs... even the Radiator Girl has movements like Audrey Horne... and is that cream corn erupting from the baby at the end!?!

The early intro bits are a bit like a James Bond film from Hell, and the planet scenes are pure Dune!! Like Sergio Leone, for the first dialogue comes after 10 minutes briefly One of the great things about this is the sound effects, all the way down to the rubbery eyeball sounds. Bravo!!

There's a documentary that's nearly as long as the movie that is one continuous interview with David Lynch, who smokes and drinks coffee and reminisces about being in diners... it's unhelpful in some ways, as it's light on details, although it does have some charm, with Lynch telling rambling stories about the people involved, the situation he was in when the movie was made, and odd anecdotes about how the logistics of certain scenes came about. He also describes how there was a lost scene of Mr & Mrs X in front of Henrys apartment, a planned scene of a nurse in the hospital basement. He discusses the pilot stories, he mnentions how Henry Nances marriage with Catherine ended because his wife was always teasing his big hair. There are pictures of David Lynch with his weird hatwe find out that Henry got his suit from Goodwill. There is a hand-held video of planning a shoot. Apparently, David Lynch lived in Henrys room at the stable for 2 or 3 years, it might have been a living room at one time for the maids, double door. We learn that there was off-and-on shooting for many years. At one time Henry approaches a door, 1.5 years later he comes through it.

Ultimately, he doesnt talk about the movie, but he talks about his life at the time. At one point they discover a dumpster full of light bulbs! It was beyond Christmas! Later on they were driving around and looking for alleys locations were mostly downtown LA. He discusses the heritage behind the tar cat scene that never made it into film part of it is seen at the menu loop. Some odd references to the tale of the ghost of Dohini, Jack Nance also saw him. The Lady in the Radiator was not in the original script, but an inspiration that came later. He talks about eating pie on the sly at Hamburger Heaven. Sound stock came from dumpster diving - filled a VW to busting with stock!! He tells the story of the road to Cannes, in all its futility. There is the tale of first screening, with an acquaintance saying oh, I wouldnt want to have a dream like that Well... that was the famed 100-minute version that no one has seen since!! Eventually, the film played in 17 cities as a midnight film, in some of them they played for four years. Lynch also tells a strange story of four Woody Woodpeckers. Nice!!",1494633600,,3143,4.499124343257443
1269537,4,B00003CWPL,Great cult classic. If you are expecting a nice pleasant movie this will confuse the hell out of you. It's so good if you are into the strange.

1269611,5,B00003CWPL,"The weirdest and most discomforting story ever seen on film. The plot is basic, but its telling is artful. SPOILER ALERT.

Henry is suffering from depression and taking an  extended ""vacation"" from work. He receives a call summoning him to the home of his girlfriend. Hoping to learn why she's been ignoring him, he arrives for an awkward dinner with her parents. Then it's revealed the purpose for the visit is to inform him that he knocked his girlfriend up. Not only that, but in the time she's been ignoring him, she already had the baby... ""if it even is a baby"". Tired of dealing with the grotesquely mutated baby on her own, the parents force Henry to take responsibility and take in their daughter and his child, which he does, after being pressured.
Once back at his dirt-filled apartment, you get a look at the repulsive baby, compliments of the fruit of Henry's loins. His girlfriend can't take the constant crying and sleepless nights, eventually abandoning Henry (again) with the baby. Henry has been staring longingly into the radiator while references to suicide play in his mind. Cue ""In Heaven, Everything is Fine"".
Who knows why, but the slu- er, the uh, seductive woman from across the hall invites him in to have ""sexual intercourse"", which he does. Why not? He's a tender lil guy though, and is shocked when the neighbor lady is already ushering another gentleman caller into her apartment the next day. Apparently that's the last straw. He runs in the apartment and kills the baby, then himself.

Yep. That's pretty much exactly what happens. You can read deeper into it if you'd like (theories range on how crazy Henry is), but as far as actual facts, that is it.",1482192000,5,1686,4.727891156462585
1269612,4,B00003CWPL,"One of David Lynch's best films.  Highly recommended.  Be prepared for peculiarity, though.  Well, it IS a Lynch picture so that admonition ought to be obvious!",1480636800,,160,5.076923076923077
1269613,4,B00003CWPL,"""Boring, pretentious, overlong, with fleeting moments of delightful weirdness."" That was my first impression of this film 5 years ago. But something strange happened after that. I couldn't get it out of my head. The horrific B&W imagery, a cinematographic nod to 40s film noir. The industrial wasteland locationbarren, harsh, and alien. The eerie tone, the diegetic mechanical drone, and the howling winds. The crazy characters, the parenthood metaphors, and indecipherable weirdness of it all. I couldn't shake that image of Jack Nance with his wild hair with smoky mist behind him. His lonely one-room home, the unrelenting cries and fish-eyed stare of his hideous ""baby""and who could forget the Radiator Lady, her deformed cheeks singing her strangely catchy tune. I had to see Eraserhead again. Hell, I had to own it. So I saw it again and really dug it. Sure, there are stretches of slow, dull, nothingness. Some of it seems to make no sense. But it's just so enjoyable to me now.",1480636800,,985,4.975757575757576

1269699,5,B00003CWPL,"This movie takes the psychological distress associated with an accidental pregnancy and turns it into a full-blown horror movie: it's one of the most bizarre and disturbingly relatable examples from the genre, though it's definitely not for everyone. Personally, the subject matter of this film made me feel extremely uncomfortable, but overall, I feel like that was the director's intended goal. It's definitely worth a rental if you've never seen it, and in the pantheon of great horror movies, I feel that it is one of the very best that the genre has to offer.",1475971200,2,564,4.947368421052632

1269702,4,B00003CWPL,"The picture and sound quality on this DVD are excellent. I'm watching it on 32-inch LCD and the sharpness of all those weird textures is amazing. Kudos to DP Frederick Elmes.

Also excellent is the sound quality, especially all those menacing sound effects courtesy of Alan Splet.

As for the meaning of Eraserhead, well, who can really say? Lynch directs his movie in such a way as to obstruct any attempts at interpretation. German Expressionism is an obvious influence, and along with it the themes of fate and determinism. The movie's opacity seems to put us in the unfortunate plight of Eraserhead himself, a comically inept Everyman overwhelmed by forces he cannot understand. Another obvious target is the American nuclear family and all the conformism and shallow optimism that it promotes.

Beyond that, Eraserhead depicts some of the lewdest, appalling, and grotesque images I've ever seen. I'm tempted to call it a horror film--some people do--but its relentless emphasis on granite-like abstraction and impenetrability prevent the movie from being very frightening simply because Lynch keeps the events in the movie too far away from us. His characters are live beetles wriggling on pins--gross and sometimes pathetic, but never frightening or sorrow-inducing.

It's that detachment and coolness that prevents me from totally like the movie--not because it prevents me from feeling compassion but because it prevents me from feeling anything besides repugnance, repulsion, and the occasional sick laugh.

The special features include a long interview with Lynch which includes many useful reflections about the making of Eraserhead. However, Lynch offers little discussion of the movie itself.",1466208000,,1705,5.418867924528302

Also; this masterpiece reveals one of the greatest epiphanies of the Ages, regarding the TRUTH about where pencil erasers come from. This revelation is a leaked secret that was kept under wraps by the Illuminati and the Masons for hundreds of years. If you didn't like this film, you simply don't understand it. The images you see on your screen have very little to do with the greater message. It's the billions of transparent molecules inside these images that are getting beamed directly into your brain.

1269879,5,B00003CWPL,"My favorite movie. Ever.

Some will not understand it. Some will be confused by it. Some will be disgusted by it. Some will hate it.

But some will get it. And for those people, it will be an experience like no other.

By ""get it"" I don't mean that people will uncover some hidden meaning in Eraserhead, or will walk away from the movie understanding what took place. By ""get it"" I mean that some people--like me--will resonate the movie on an emotional level even if their conscious mind can't make heads or tails of it. This movie is a like a dream that you still feel hours after waking even if its images and ideas don't make any sense to your waking mind.

The only thing I've ever experienced that hits that same level of incoherent emotional intensity would probably be the music of early Industrial music acts like Skinny Puppy. Indeed, the movie's immersive soundtrack is reminiscent of some Industrial music, with its washes of white noise, throbbing bass, and heavy atmosphere. Considering that Eraser was released in the same year as The Second Annual Report of Throbbing Gristle, the album that invented Industrial music, there may be a hidden lineage between this movie and early Industrial acts.

Much like Throbbing Gristle, this movie isn't necessarily a pleasant experience, but it becomes all the more powerful for it's horrific imagery, which is so memorable it will probably be with you the rest of your life. The movie is not a gore-fest or anything so straightforward: it's much more powerful than that. The ending was so visually and emotionally intense that I was staring at my screen, slack jawed and shaking, all throughout the credits and for several minutes afterward. No movie has ever affected me even half as much.

You have to be in a certain mindset to watch and enjoy this movie. It helped define the ""midnight movie"" phenomenon, and I can see why: even if you just watch it on a laptop, I highly recommend watching it at midnight.

But, there are several prints of this film avalible, which makes it hard to choose which one is best.

Be aware  that Criterion is releasing a new digital restoration in Blu Ray in September 2014.
I have mine on preorder.
We will just have to wait and see if the new Criterion version is any better then this Blu Ray.

So, if you want to buy this disk, you would be well advised to wait until September, when the restoration
hits the market.
I am sure I have bought this film at least 4 times, as formats improve over time.

The film it's self is very dark in saturation, and you cant see some of the details.

This was also the case in the theater when I first saw it at the AFI (Washington, DC), when I was a member.
No one had seen the film, and Mr. Lynch was supposed to have been there to introduce the film, but he
didnt show up. It was his actual final work print that was screened that evening.

The Blu Ray edition fixes the black saturation so more details are finally visible.

Eraserhead (1977) is a cult classic David Lynch movie.  In fact, he wrote, directed and produced it.  This black and white movie has great cinematography, an interesting sound effects track, great atmosphere, and is all around well shot.  This movie is very bizarre.  This is one of those movies that you'll either like or you won't like.  This movie's atmosphere and feel I think is very similar to another David Lynch classic, The Elephant Man (1980).  Lynch definitely has his own unique style, and Eraserhead is no exception.  I don't want to give anything away, so you'll have to watch the movie yourself.

Eraserhead comes highly recommended.",1400976000,2,763,4.984126984126984

1270239,5,B00003CWPL,"Eraserhead (1977) is a very low budget surrealist horror film written, produced, and directed by David Lynch. If I had to sum up this movie in two ways, I'd say that it's darker than dark, and weirder than weird. This film definitely is a love it or hate it affair; to say that it's surreal is an understatement. However, it truly is a work of art, and a break from the norm. What makes this film work is the black and white color format; it's dark, eerie, and subtle, and the plot is unusual and full of psychological and sexual references. And the music? The music is a low-toned, sort of an industrial sound, or a nuclear reactor sound, which adds to the film's eccentricity and far-out feel. From a graphic standpoint, this film is tolerable, in my opinion. So many people think this film is too graphic; I've seen way worse. Overall, Eraserhead is quite an experience, and even manages to amuse at times. Does this film make sense? Probably not at first, but a second viewing will bring clarity to those who appreciate films depicting a psychological struggle. There is no other movie like Eraserhead; it's in a class all by itself. I highly recommend this film for someone looking for an unusual flick once in a while. This film (for me) is assimilated best with all the lights turned off, and preferably after midnight. :-)",1399680000,7,1330,4.592436974789916

1270243,5,B00003CWPL,"Amazing film, I'd definitely recommend it. David Lynch is an absolute genius. I could watch this film over and over and never get tired of it.",1394668800,,142,4.5
1270244,3,B00003CWPL,"This is understandably one of those films that divide an audience.  Some think it's mad genius; a brilliant piece of art.  Others can barely stand to watch it, finding it intolerably boring and obtuse.  I guess I'm that small percentage of people who are somewhere in the middle, though I definitely sympathize with the camp who hate it.  I totally understand why.  Still, a part of me likes it.  I know.  I can't make up my mind!

It's got arresting visuals and originality in spades.  You definitely haven't seen anything like it before.  But being original isn't a good thing in and of itself.  People watch movies to be entertained.  And for a lot of people, it's hard to be entertained by a movie that they can't begin to understand.  Again, I sympathize.

I won't try and explain the plot, since I have no idea what it is, or if there is even supposed to be one.  This seems to be Lynch's thing.  ""Plot"" doesn't enter into his films.  He denies this, saying that his movies are decipherable, and do indeed have a point, but I personally have no idea what any of his movies are about.  Roger Ebert wasn't a big fan of Lynch either.  He sort of enjoyed some of them, and respected Lynch's talent with a camera, but in the end, he didn't like being ""jerked around"" by the director.  I feel much the same.  If Lynch just came out and said his movies have no point, I might enjoy them more.  But when he says, ""Here, I have a jigsaw puzzle for you,"" you can't help but try and piece it together.  But in the end, at least for me, the pieces simply don't fit.

That isn't to say that I don't ""enjoy"" some of his movies, in a loose sense of that word.  Like I said, he's got a real talent for making striking, disturbing visuals that can really hypnotize the viewer.  Eraserhead certainly has a lot of them.  And there's something to be said for a director who keeps a viewer like me, who is constantly puzzled and infuriated with his films, coming back for more.  He might just be a genius.  But I can't shake the feeling that he's mostly just a filmmaker with a lot of ideas, but no ability (or maybe just no interest) in telling a coherent, satisfying story.

So, if you want to be provoked, disturbed, and watch some really strange dream-like images, then by all means, give Eraserhead a go.  Just don't expect any attempt at traditional storytelling.  And don't make any effort to piece this thing together.  I'm almost positive there is no ""point.""  It's a trip without a destination.  Just sit back and watch it go.",1393286400,2,2521,4.406521739130435
1270245,5,B00003CWPL,Easily one of the most jolting yet eerily somber films you will ever see. a simplified paranoid dream in which the visuals are foreign though the substance is all too familiar. A surreal horror-comedy masterpiece. Don't watch it high.,1392076800,,234,5.0256410256410255
1270276,5,B00003CWPL,"This movie is not going to appeal to everybody. It is disturbing, hypnotically plodding, depressing--yet oddly funny. The film has somewhat of a reputation as being unintelligible; however, the story itself is actually pretty basic. It is the unorthodox way in which the story is presented that confuses everyone. The movie is loaded with unexplained symbolism and weird intercut scenes which will probably be annoying to a lot of viewers.

If you're of an artistic nature, you can just see the movie for the bleak sets, rich visual textures and unnerving sound effects.
It was filmed in grainy, industrial black and white, which really heightens the depressive, nightmarish quality. Horror fans, you should see this movie just for the mutated baby--truly a groundbreaking special effect.

As surreal as it all is, there seems to be a lot of honesty in this film--real feelings about relationships, birth, death, possible life after death...the whole human experience. And as bleak and spare as the movie can be, it is not without hope and poignancy. The Lady in the Radiator sings: In Heaven everything is fine, and she means it. And poor Henry, who hears her song, is the model Everyman, plodding along as best he can through whatever crap life slings at him.

All in all, if you're more than a little bored with mainstream stuff, and are in the mood for a cult film, this is one of the best.",1389916800,,1394,4.848739495798319
1270277,5,B00003CWPL,"Nine Things about Eraserhead"" (USA, 1977)

1. This surrealist masterpiece by David Lynch is in my Top 10 List of Strange Films. It could be considered an early example of the body horror film genre. It also has strong absurdist elements that are sort of funny. Sort of. This is not a comedy.

2. It fills me with a sense of awkwardness, hopelessness, and an undefinable dread every time I watch it. I have to be in just the right mood for it.

3. Visually and sonically, its about a man who lives in an industrial dreamscape where it is never sunny and where nothing nice ever happens.

4. The plot has something to do with this man, Henry, who may have gotten his girlfriend pregnant. He ends up raising a deformed child-thing in his tiny apartment and being distracted by a lady that lives inside his radiator.

5. What I just described above doesnt even come close to explaining what happens in the movie. The less said about it, the better.

6. Even though this is Lynchs first movie, he has always refused to explain it. One of the consequences of being so unforgivingly surreal is that the movie has about as many interpretations as viewers.

7. One obvious interpretation of the movie is that it is a metaphor for the fears that come with being a responsible father. I used to agree with this interpretation. But there are too many elements that don't fit.

8. Now, I think its about a man who is so alienated and isolated from others that he feels powerless to create the life he wants for himself. Any efforts he makes are either rejected, or are so deformed and shameful, that he doesnt even understand what he did.

9. Despite being in my personal Hall of Fame, this is a movie that I don't really recommend to anyone. Like all of Lynch's movies, people need to decide for themselves if they should watch it and what they think of it.",1388966400,4,1845,4.451038575667655

1270284,1,B00003CWPL,"Just DO NOT WATCH IT. This movie needs NEGATIVE STARS to be properly rated. Okay, are you masochistic? Love to make yourself suffer? This movie is so horrible it should be banned as torture. Oh, are you ""sophisticated"" and pride yourself on having a higher sense of artistic appreciation than others? Yes, watch it, you stuck-up, jaded, dead-souled thing, and write glowing reviews about the masterful use of dark and light, surrealism, etc. But none of these positive reviews fool me -- NOBODY could watch this film even once -- not even partly through -- and actually enjoy it unless there was something very wrong with their head and even deeper in their psyche. The only reason there's so many positive reviews is that nobody in their right mind (truly right mind) would think of watching it if they had heard much about it, and wouldn't watch much of it if they didn't know what they were getting into and started watching it. Take it from me: I gave in to a dark impulse of morbid curiosity and now wish someone had warned me. I have a taste for the weird, bizarre, even avant garde, at least when I'm in the mood, but this monstrosity isn't so much strange and bizarre as it is willfully designed to create a constant strain and irritation of the mind!  It is unrelenting, there is no island of sanity, no glimmer of hope or happiness, not a moment when it doesn't grate like chalk, fingernails, claws on a blackboard accompanied by a can opener grinding on a mispositioned can. Maybe it should be watched by the people who say there is no sign of God in this world, or if there is one, he's evil -- because THIS shows what that sort of world would be like; there's no good in this world, and its creator obviously was evil. It might also be good for those contemplating having sex with someone they are not married to -- obviously nobody is really going to have a baby with a head that looks like a cross between a giant sperm and a lamb's that was skinned alive, but the imagery is so stark and merciless it will certainly cause a loss of appetite for sexual relations (or food, maybe living...)",1382745600,12,2104,4.479166666666667

1270405,4,B00003CWPL,"More than 35 years after its initial release, Eraserhead remains a curious enigma wrapped in shadowy symbolism. It's a shining example of what can happen when a director cracks the door open just enough to glimpse his vision, but not enough to fully grasp the story. David Lynch, for better or worse, intentionally or not, delivered a heck of a story, but stumbled on the punchline.

Others have already spelled out the plot, but in a nutshell: Henry Spencer (Jack Nance) is seen in the opening, in a montage with the 'Man in the Planet' who manipulates a sperm-like creature (which has exited Spencer's mouth) and the creature appears to fall to earth. Later, we're introduced to the world of Henry. He's a Nobody, the anti-hero. A printing company employee on vacation who returns to his dreary apartment building to be informed by his sexy neighbor across the hall that 'Mary' has called, and wants him to have dinner with her parents. Mary appears to be a past love interest. Henry obliges and finds that Mary's family puts the 'funk' in dysfunction. From the catatonic grandmother to artificially chipper father Bill, the dinner goes from bad to worse when the 'baby chickens' (probably Cornish game hens) weren't cooked long enough. This is one of the best scenes of the entire film.

Mary's mother soon corners Henry and informs him that Mary had a baby, and that the two should marry. But the baby is anything but. Imagine an infantile 'E.T.' Henry and Mary are now in his apartment, but the infant's incessant crying forces Mary to return home. Henry now embarks on a series of bizarre visions and dreams as he attempts to care for the strange infant. The finale, both shocking and graphic, leaves the viewer wondering, what the heck did I just see?

Much of what this film has going for it is atmosphere. The sounds are creepy. Now add to it the pipe organ meanderings of the legendary Fats Waller. And we see Henry as he travels what resembles a post-industrial landscape. We hear the noises of factories operating, but nowhere near total capacity. One can easily imagine modern day Detroit, with its large areas of urban blight and abandoned housing, the result of 50+ years of liberal politics and the greedy hand of the auto unions. A city dying, a city in decay. The film is as stark as the visions shown, a curious play on light and shadows. It's difficult to imagine this movie in anything BUT black and white. But it was used to great effect by Lynch.

But at the end, there are too many questions and not enough answers. A director can leave too much to the audience to try and interpret. Much has been made about the sexual undercurrents, but was the baby the epitome of the fear of fatherhood? Was the child an alien implant? And just who was the Man in the Planet? An intergalactic father looking for a surrogate parent? And the Lady in the Radiator, was she trying to draw Henry away from the dark side and to the Light? It could be argued (and I'm sure there will be plenty of argument) that Eraserhead might be the horror film equivalent of Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. Long after you've stopped pondering about the plot, the nightmarish images will stay with you.

TRIVIA: Due to funding problems, it took more than 4 years to complete the film. The late Jack Nance (1943-1996) kept his crazy hairstyle for the entire time, until the movie was completed.",1375488000,8,3384,4.6521739130434785

Lynch as a student of film outside the mainstream paints a portrait of the ugliness and bleakness of a modern Western culture cut off from the past centuries.  The woman in the radiator reminds us of outsider portraits of the shadow self of Marilyn Monroe.  She sings a haunting hymn:  ""heaven is a place where you've got yours and I've got mine"" describes a longing for material means, but devoid of meaningful relationships or purpose.",1374883200,,540,4.966666666666667

1270465,5,B00003CWPL,"Eraserhead is, without a doubt, one of the best and most disturbing films I've ever had the pleasure of watching. It was written, produced, and directed by the great David Lynch, and was his directorial debut, released in 1977. Due to a low budget it was filmed in black and white but I think that it improves the film's overall quality and makes the film look more eerie and unsettling. I actually think it wouldn't had been as good had it been shot in color. The basic plot follows a mild-mannered man named Henry Spencer (Jack Nance) who has a wild frizzy hairstyle that makes his head look sort of like an Eraser, hence the title. He lives in an industrial wasteland in a small apartment filled with odd plants and other objects. One day, when returning home, the beautiful girl across the hall (Judith Anna Roberts), tells him that his girlfriend Mary (Charlotte Stewart) has invited him over for dinner. When he goes over for dinner, which itself is an extremely awkward and odd scene, he finds out from Mary's mother that she recently had a baby, although she says it's premature she doesn't tell him that it doesn't even look human. Looking more like a cow fetus, after they bring it home it cries incessantly, and this is where the film truly delves into a surreal nightmare of vivid dreams or hallucinations where the line between fantasy and reality gets thinner and thinner as the film progresses. Eraserhead is a true cinematic gem and one of the most original films I've ever seen. I've never seen another film quite like it, although a few, such as Tetsuo: the Iron man and Begotten come close. Not even David Lynch has made another film like it, although Inland Empire comes close, in reality it's a more mainstream film, at least as far as dialogue and characters go. Overall Eraserhead is a great surrealist film that would make directors such as Luis Bunuel and Alejandro Jodorowsky envious and I can definitely see why Stanley Kubrick enjoyed it so much, and the influence it had on his film, The Shining. As far as interpretations on this film go, it definitely varies. I've seen this film interpreted from everything from a dark comedy satirizing marriage and parenthood, to a psychological horror focusing on a man going insane, to a surreal nightmare, to a film focusing on the negative effects of industrial pollution, focusing on mental and physical illness and deformity . Personally, I see this film as a surreal dystopian film which focuses on a friendly, likable, sympathetic protagonist (Henry Spencer) who is trapped in a hellish industrial wasteland which he views as a literal hell, and many of the dreams and hallucinations scattered throughout the film are his way of coping with his bleak reality. In the beginning of the film Henry is miserable and lonely, he seems unable to smile or find any real happiness, but in his own way he seems joyful when he learns that his girlfriend Mary has invited him over for dinner, it is here when we get a clearer glimpse of just how bad things are for him and the other people who live in his world, all of Mary's family is just as mentally ill and disturbed and he is, although in their own way, and you often have trouble distinguishing what real and what's not. Things get even worse when Henry learns he has a baby with Mary, and just like everyone else in Henry's world, it is deformed to the point of not looking human. It cries incessantly, and both him and Mary seem truly unhappy and miserable together, after she leaves and Henry's reality is left even more bleak and miserable, he begins to hallucinate even more, imagining a joyful, oddly beautiful, innocent looking woman who represents or symbolizes heaven, he is eager to go to heaven, meaning he is actually suicidal, reaching out to touch her, but as he does, he sees the grotesque man in the planet, symbolizing hell or the devil, which could possibly be a religious reference, since it's a common Christian belief that people who commit suicide go to hell. In the end, regardless of how you interpret the film, it remains a thoroughly original, thought-provoking film of the type that is sadly lacking in much of today's cinema, obviously Hollywood but even among independent and art-house films. David Lynch created a true masterpiece with Eraserhead, and it's the first film I've seen of his and the reason why he's my favorite director.

Sound is perfect, using the same Dolby 48kHz 192 kbps compression as on the DVD.  True PCM is not needed on a soundtrack like this.  Another improvement on the DVD is the prescence of chapters.  My only gripe is that the disc is kept consistently spun-up at 30 Mbps, so the player never has a chance to settle down.  It's constantly rumbling at full capacity.

I am going to have to watch it again at some point to see how it strikes me now that 30 years have gone by, but my impression then was that it is a masterfully nauseating descent into a Freudian dream-hell exploring (among other things) the male fear of paternity.  I'm a woman, and a mother, and this movie, if I interpreted anything about it correctly, gave me the rawest, most honest insight into it might mean to some men to contemplate becoming a father...and it resonated with me.

For all those new to this Lynch film one thing to keep in mind in this film is that every bizarre event that happens is from the main character perception.

Shot in black and white and set in a grungy, unattractive, and factory-like dystopia, the film has a definable plot, at least of sorts.  Briefly, Henry (Jack Nance) gets his girlfriend Mary (Charlotte Stewart) pregnant, and she gives birth to what appears to be a non-human mutant.  She hates the creature, which refuses to eat and makes endless whining sounds, and she abandons both.  Henry makes an effort to care for the creature, but he experiences a number of inexplicable events that may or not be dream states that drive him to try to kill the creature.  His attempt backfires in a singular way.

Different people describe the film in different ways.  Some consider it slow, and it is true that dialogue spare, the plot spotty, and the images are deliberately repetitive.  Some find it very funny, and it is true that there are moments when it displays an unexpectedly wacky sense of humore.  Some describe it as disgusting, and again it is true that the film's imagery includes a number of set pieces that about as appealing as a genital discharge.  But the chief comment about the film is that it doesn't seem to have a point.  I disagree with this: I felt the point of the film is to display an overwhelming sexual nausea.

A great deal of the film's images consist of not-so-covert sexual references.  Near the film's beginning, Henry opens his mouth and emits what appears to a deformed or mutated sperm.  Later in the film, he discovers a facially deformed woman living inside his radiator, who sings of heaven in a simple childlike way and moves about a stage crushing similar sperm-like creatures by stomping them with her feet.  The camera constantly peers into boxes, orbs, trash cans, holes, and frequently espys pock-marked skin that seems to suggest veneral disease.  When Henry attempts to carve a chicken, it comes to life and pours out a bloody liquid.  He has, or perhaps dreams, of a sexual encounter with the woman who lives across the hall--but the experience is disrupted by the creature and degenerates into a series of unpleasant experiences.  Ultimately, when Henry attempts to kill the creature, it opens like a toxic vagina before transforming into what seems to be a grotesque sperm akin to the creature that came out of Henry's mouth at the beginning of the film.

ERASERHEAD was clearly influenced by a number of earlier directors and artists, but is distinctly David Lynch's own, and it touches on the various effects that would ultimately make him famous: circular logic, bizarre and surreal imagery, and the creation of an intellectual and artistic exercise that is ultimately dark mystery.  I cannot say that I found the film appealing, and I cannot not imagine seeing it again, but I have to admit that, love it or hate it, ERASERHEAD is nonetheless memorable.  There have been several DVD releases, but the most commonly available seems to be one that includes the original trailer and a fairly long monologue by Lynch in which he describes how the film was made but otherwise gives away few secrets.  Its an arthouse flick from start to finish, and people who want a nice linear plot will loathe it, but if you're up for something entirely different, this is it.

Throw in equal parts of Monty Python, Alien, Charlie Chaplin, George Orwell and Andy Kaufman into a cuisinart, puree for 10 minutes and dump into a toilet and you have you have the plot. There is virtually no dialogue, much less meaningful dialogue.  Since it has no plot, the ""action"" is excruciatingly painfully slow developing to whatever extent one would considered that it developed at all. The end befits the rest of this abortion, it just truncates in mid-frame.

Reading all these reviews after watching the film does explain some things but so what?!  It doesn't make my viewing experience any better.  But then again, I did not enjoy Blue Velvet either.  There, I said it!  Another unforgettable movie that I wish I had never seen.

He created it, literally and figuratively.  The misbegotten and misshapen thing is the malformed inner person of Henry made manifest.  He cannot escape his anxiety -- his world barely supports life.  Even the plant in his apartment is dead.  His girlfriend is mad, her family is oddly inappropriate, and he cannot create but only erase.  He is afraid that his neighbor, with whom he fantasizes about having sex, sees his malformed inner self, the mewling, needy, grossly immature thing that he is.  But in the end, uncovering the core of his anxiety, he is able to overcome it, as seen in the calm expression that suffuses his face as he is bathed by light in the embrace of the lady in the radiator.

The reason I mention this is because this usually indicates that something may be disappearing.  My guess is that if you want to add Eraserhead to your collection, do so now.  As to the movie itself, there is sufficient textual analysis without me adding much beyond the simple warning that this is NOT a horror movie, and where some of the reviewers here got that idea is beyond me.  There were some disgusting moments, particularly when Mary is having the little... whatever they are... in the bed.  That was tough.  However, I had forgotten, after several years without having seen the movie, how laugh out loud funny it is!  Is there a story, yes of course.  Is there a deeper text, I believe there is.  My own take, if anyone is interested, is that this is the most glaring indictment that I have ever seen of the chain of domesticity killing art, which leads to death.  Maybe a stretch, but it seems clear to me that Lynch was not excited by the idea of parenthood!  Anyway, the remastering is beautiful.  I also encourage you to get this for the Lynch interview that is included here.  Between this extended discourse, his commentary from Twin Peaks, and his discussions from Inland Empire, it is clear to me that this guy is one of the towering artists of the latter half of the twentieth, first decades of the 21st century.  And from all I can gather, people who have worked with him love him.  You don't want to let this one slip away.",1292544000,2,1591,4.533333333333333

Hypnotic, fascinating, you just *have* to see what weird or funny thing happens next. The gag with the suitcase had me laughing as hard as at anything else. I thought it was sad too, though. The baby's mother didn't love him, and he was always crying and got sick. I wasn't disturbed by the baby, I wanted to give it a hug. Deformed cow-fetus babies deserve to be loved too.

If I can get a smidge philosophical, I think the film stretches cinema to limits it hadn't been stretched to before, although Bunuel, Kubrick, Fellini, and Tarkovsky are definitely forerunners. As an adherent of Tarkovskyish views on cinema, I think this is a very good example of what he called ""sculpting in time,"" and the irrationality of so much of the movie underlines the irrelevance of plot, characters, stories, 2+2=4, etc., of cinema itself.",1290988800,5,1124,4.73469387755102

1270801,5,B00003CWPL,"Most have felt the surrealistic sensibility of this film. Yet, wasn't it that way with the films of Cocteau? And, wasn't it Cocteau who named a film about a painter (and himself and art in general) 'The Blood of a Poet.' So why do I say poet-filmaker? Well, in a broad sense we could say that all film is literature, but most film deals heavily with the development of plot (narrative). And what can a poet throw out? This very thing for the purposes of pursuing the freest figurations and self-expressions. Of course, when events are placed in a sequence, we can always call the cohesive (enough anyway) flow of 'events' plot. Yet, when, whether or not the 'events' have taken place on the same universe (as the prefix 'uni' implies that the various states cohere in some way and operate under the same fundamental laws) what we have is something other than narrative in a film operating as the cohesive thread. There is no getting to the bottom of this film. If an artist could 'say' or show something without doing the art, art would never be created. Anyone that has studied Shakespeare understands that ambiguity is one of the most powerful means of evoking meaning. It is the spectator who will have to untie these intricate knots. The ambiguity is then, an invitation. Perhaps the most ambiguous film yet produced is a grand triumph for the fans by virtue rather than in spite of its absolute resistance to claims of finding resolution & closure.  Yet there are enough lurid parallels to invoke the spirit of an initiated viewer's 'visionary reading.' So? We provide the thread, but without the medium we wouldn't want to. I've been out on my porch thinking, 'I'm on to this Eraserhead thing now.' Then I get curious and turn on the movie only to find that my abstractions are once again blown away by the particular forms, sounds, imagery, language, in short, everything that Lynch has at his disposal (he uses it all well and considers it carefully. Man, aren't those Fats Waller organ pieces perfect!). And I think that present film-makers would do well to learn from Lynch and Cocteau as well. Let's face it: film can appeal to our senses and sensibilities in so many ways that we can be moderately 'entertained' by unambitious trash. But, as for making an art of it, the only filmmaker I can think of that consistently produced movies of this caliber is Fritz Lang. And he new well how to use image--if not surreal, certainly not ordinary. 'Video' in Latin means 'I see.' And for today's film-makers, this mostly means very mundane things. The vast majority of films being produced are hardly worth calling mediocre because it is actually disgusting that billions of dollars are being spent on them (to make and to view).  Alas, people even like them. The 'video' that is 'I see with my intellect' and will reveal with imagery more akin to the the mind's eye is a rare thing to pull off. It's hard enough to find a movie with good acting and a decent plot that is not so hackneyed that I want to vomit. Though I earlier compared Cocteau to Lynch, I think Lynch has far exceeded Cocteau. As for Lynch's other films, the one most akin to this by virtue of its highly 'poetic' revelation is Inland Empire. I highly recommend it and believe that Lynch was very brave for creating a film that he knew would very likely displease even many of his fans. I recommend giving I. E. a chance. It can be painful at first, but I've learned when to watch it (it's definitely not every night, and it's far from pleasant). Everything Lynch has done (with the exception of Dune) is worth owning and watching several times a year for me. Lynch digs pretty deep into thematic explorations that sometimes span several projects, and I don't think after Blue Velvet the sadistic man ever really left his mind. I mention this because the spirit behind Eraserhead was growing from '70 (and probably before). A great treasure is the release of The Short Films of David Lynch. Whereas with Twin peaks you can see strong parallels with Blue Velvet, there's not much for Eraserhead. But the Grandmother and the Alphabet, though short, place this film in a slightly larger context.

1270806,5,B00003CWPL,"Eraser head .... It's hard to start a review of a movie such as this. The movie is slow paced and, it's 10 mins and 30 seconds before anyone says anything. It's dark, moody and sometimes confusing. If your mind is open while you watch it you won't rush to judge it negatively.

For me, the movie represents a TRUE study in the art form of movie making. Basically the budget was probably 50 bucks and change but out of that came this gem. The darkness and awkwardness of the whole thing is somehow riveting. The soundtrack is just awesome. The sound alone is SO key it is almost another cast member.

Henry (Jack Nance) is an awkward, odd guy who finds out he is a father. The father of what ? A mutant like premature baby. He and the mother (Mary X) attempt to live together and raise the child. Mary X is soon gone as the hell of the whole situation just drives her away.

Henry starts to drift inside his own mind while attempting to care for the ""baby"". He seems to see death as a better alternative to his life. Weird fantasies enter his mind via the ""girl behind the radiator"" who appears to be offering him a much better life in heaven.

A night of passion with the woman across the hallway seems to bring him around a little but, he sees her with some other guy and only sinks back into his descent into dark depths.

From there Henry descends back into his own dark, murky depths and takes care of things the way only Henry can.

David Lynch has a mind all his own and hasn't actually told us what this movie is about from his perspective. I kind of appreciate that as we can form our own conclusions and they won't be right or wrong.

It's dark, it's slow, it's confusing but you can't look away. Personally I see this as a descent into madness. Henry knows he's odd, awkward and broody and I feel life has beaten him and he needs a way out.

I feel if people watch this and jump up here and write critical reviews, then, as an art form, the movie has done it's job which is to provoke an emotion whether good or bad.

Note: The 2000 DVD has a narration by David Lynch and one of the things that struck me was that this film took 5 years to make due to budget (or lack of). There is a scene where Henry comes wandering down the hall to his apartment, puts his hand on the door knob and turns the handle. Then there's a cut to inside the room and Henry comes in. Apparently it took 18 months for Henry to get through that door. Ah, let's hear it for independent film noir.",1256515200,,2480,4.171548117154812
1270807,4,B00003CWPL,"This movie isn't for everybody, but if you're like me, and weird stuff is enough to entertain you, you'll probably get some enjoyment out of it, particularly the dream (I guess?) sequence where the movie gets its title.  It's got to be the ugliest movie I've ever seen.  Ugly people, gross special effects, this movie has it all.  There's nothing in this movie that's pretty, except maybe one or two disturbed women.  At many points I wasn't quite sure how to feel, so I was very disturbed.  I'm not sure when the movie was made but it seems to provide some very ambiguous commentary on the whole abortion issue.

Of course, it's an art film, so expect a butchered plot and lots of moments without action or dialogue.  At least it's only an hour and a half long, which isn't bad compared to 2001 A Space Odyssey.

I bet most people who see this movie already know what it's going to be like before they see it.  It's not a particularly easy movie to find, so people probably find out what goes on in the movie in the process of deciding whether or not to see it.  Not for kids.

(10/29/09 - Some (maybe all, I'm not sure) DVD versions of this movie have a menu sequence that looks a little too realistically disturbing.  I later found out that the corpse of the cat in this footage is a real corpse.  Lynch broke a promise to not film this dead cat he acquired, and the poor cat's remains were clearly treated in an undignified manner.  It was some hard footage for me to watch since I recently lost a cat myself.

1270808,4,B00003CWPL,"I think the ideal way to experience this movie is to think of it as the viewing of a bad dream.  David Lynch provides the images and leaves everything wide open for each viewer to interpret.

Lynch claims that Eraserhead is his most spiritual film, and it is set in a rundown industrial society where there doesn't appear to be any quality of life.  Secular pursuits seem pointless for these characters, so maybe spirituality is found in these dreamlike states that Lynch displays here.  All the lead character, Henry, can do to escape his surroundings is stare at a heater and imagine a deformed girl on stage singing ""in heaven everything is fine"".  To top it all off, he's trying to take care of his mutant baby while he's on vacation with a girlfriend who is afflicted with sporadic seizures.  Not exactly your typical storyline but there is no need to take anything literally here.

I found this movie to be very engrossing.  The images are very surreal but that's what I was anticipating and was in the mood for.  I also found it to be very humorous in several places.  This review is for the DVD version pictured above.  There aren't many special features on this version, other than a David Lynch bio and filmography.

1270810,5,B00003CWPL,"This is perhaps David Lynch's best film. Eraserhead came out in 1978 and has been a cult favourite ever since. It is a surreal story filmed in haunting black and white. It is a horrific and funny story. It is a nightmare.

My impression was that the film is a depiction of a possible dark future with warnings about the dangers of an industrial society gone off track. There are deformed monstrous babies, and people living scared in their dark apartments not knowing their neighbours, surrounded by noisy industrial complexes where no trace of nature seems to exist anymore, only railway tracks, dirt and gravel. A picture in a room doesn't show a tranquil beautiful landscape, but an atomic explosion. People are living in the shadow of this industrial world which has overtaken everything, and has even darkened the sky with its soot.

Whether taken as a movie with a message or as just the representation of a surreal, nightmarish world, this film is truly unique and is one of the most perfect cinematic films ever made.",1250985600,2,1025,4.785310734463277

1270876,5,B00003CWPL,"This movie/film is unlike anything I've ever seen or experienced.  I first saw it when it was first released, a bit later when I saw and studied it in film school, then sometime around 1993 or 1994 when I was visiting with my brother, and we were looking for a video to rent and I suggested this, and last, only just recently on the ""on-demand"" service on cable.  Needless to say, this film has, from my first viewing to most recent, held up as probably one of the greatest films I have ever seen, of any kind.  While my first viewing of this was from that of an aspiring filmmaker, the second being when I actually examined it in detail as part of my film school studies, and later on in further screenings, having recently seen it on cable on ""on-demand,"" I am and will forever be amazed at this work.

I had not seen this film, in any form or format, for nearly 15 years, but seeing it recently on the cable-tv ""on-demand"" service, I have to say that my positive feelings about it originally experienced, have only been refreshed and reinforced, big time.  In my past memories, I had and have always considered this one of the best films I've ever seen, but again experiencing it again and again (thanks to on-demand), I found so much more value and meaning in all the strange weirdness of it all, that I'd really have to say that this film is at least in my top 20 movies of all time.  At the very least.  What makes it deserve such a spot?  Just the overall weirdness of it all, but specifically, how all that weirdness all seems to make perfect sense if one thinks about the movie's various scenes and contemplates the same.

Having read the main Amazon reviews and user-reviews, I was and still am reluctant to add my two cents in, because most of the positive reviews here are really great and enlightening.  But here's my two cents worth, for what it's worth.

This movie, by David Lynch, was an AFI (American Film Institute) project, but which was completed and enhanced, long after it was a ""student"" work.  While very low budget, it is proof positive that with imagination and vision, a little money can go a long way in creating a truly eternal, superior work of art, film-wise.  The film is truly unlike anything before or after it, and while I had fond memories of it before seeing it again (and again) recently on the cable ""on-demand,"" seeing it again after so many years just reinforced my love for it.  In other words, while I had loved it before, viewing it again only added to my appreciation for it.

There are many films and movies which ""fans"" will buy and replay and enjoy again and again, but this one is really special.  Not only because it is just sooooo weird, and a real shock to the system (our brain cells), but because it is a movie/film (DVD release) which almost DEMANDS numerous viewings, just to get all the details and to start the old brain working in the process of interpreting all of those details.  For the truth is, this is a really one-of-a-kind cinematic treat, and deserves more than almost any other film, repeated viewings to ""get"" the most from it.

Very slow-moving and deliberate is ""Eraserhead"" that I guess a lot of people will give this a try at first, only to be too impatient to stick with it.  But many movies are like that, including so many critically acclaimed films.  For those who stay with it, who just relax and enjoy the images and sounds which follow throughout however, I can't imagine anyone really being too dissapointed with this.  Even if one doesn't truly ""get it,"" but who watches it to the end, there is a great reward here in much, much after-thought.  For no matter what one's station in life, in no matter what time period of one's life, this is something that will stick with you, for life.  Whether it be a few small, seemingly insignificant scenes and ideas, or the larger picture, this is a movie which will make you THINK.  Think about a lot of things and challenge the intelligent viewer, about a lot of things, some a lot more comfortable to think about than others.

Over time, many have tried to break down this film and impart upon it various meanings and supposed metaphors.  I would reject none of them however because this film is just so unique and different.  In fact, a single viewing really doesn't do justice to the whole.  Only with repeated screenings (even if they may seem tiresome and unnecessary), does the pure genius of this movie become apparent.  For me, it is a horror film, a comedy, a sci-fi work, an experimental try, and so, so much more.  It is really one of a kind, was when I first saw it and studied it, and remains to present day.  Even if you see it once, you need to see it at least once more.

My own interpretation of the film is that it is a satirical and comedic view of a strange man in a strange land (20th, 21st century) who finds himself in a hell-ish, nightmarish existence, in an ugly, urban place not too distant from that world a lot of us live in.  Specifically, the movie deals with the industrialized/crazy living environment, bad dream, all of us deal with at some time or another and are forced to deal and live with.  In this case, that of a single man living in a weird world, who seems suddenly forced into a marriage of convenience, and worse, fatherhood.

All of this does not begin to describe the bizarre journey here though.  I give 3 thumbs up to this, but if one is in doubt, I strongely suggest a rent before a buy.  If one gets it, on any level, and one's budget can afford it, it certainly is a must-have for any collector of totally weird and rather deep movies, if one thinks about it enough.  ""Eraserhead"" is without equal, and after seeing it so many times, all I can think is that this is not all that far away from the reality of most people's eventual experiences in ""romantic"" relationships and marriage, and of how having kids (or at least one) can change everything for the worst.  However one may interpret all the weird images, sounds, sound effects, and ""music,"" this is truly a masterpiece of cinema after all is said and done.

A stranger and more delightfully disturbing, enlightening Hollywood, linear movie you will probably never experience, and I think everyone should see it at least once, if not several times after to fully appreciate the genius here of David Lynch's finest work.",1245283200,,6351,4.483927019982624

1270879,5,B00003CWPL,"I finally got a chance to view this much-hyped, forever-talked about freak fest known as Eraserhead by David Lynch.

First and foremost, I am QUITE sure that subsequent viewings will find me liking this movie more and more.  To date I have only seen it once.  I KNEW I would have to write a review and my thoughts about it were all over the place - I was disgusted, frightened, amazed, laughed like hell but ultimately was THOROUGHLY entertained.

Secondly, I had to come up with a plot line to couch a review in.  After only one viewing that seems virtually impossible. Hello folks, this is a David Lynch film - plot is ENTIRELY too restrictive a concept. Suffice it to say, it deals with loneliness, insecurity, frustration, a horny mother, an endlessly smoking grandmother, a hapless father, a mysterious Lady of the Evening, and a VERY disturbing baby.

Lastly, pegging it as merely ""different"" is a masterpiece of understatement and for a directorial debut is MOST unforgettable.  Actually, I have come to like most, if not all of Lynch's work because it was NEVER commonplace, trite or contrived.  Lynch is behind such fascinations as ""Lost Highway,"" ""Blue Velvet,"" ""Wild At Heart,"" and, of course, ""Twin Peaks.""  My ultimate justification is that David Lynch and I share a birthday which probably explains a lot.

1270883,5,B00003CWPL,"David Lynch's first film, Eraserhead, is a very odd beast, a cinematic experience on par with 2001: A Space Odyssey or 8 1/2.  The hype on this one is for real, this movie truly is odd and very dark, though it may not be scary for some, especially for people who are used to or merely find surreal, bizarre, creepy things extremely entertaining and awesome (raise hand).  Eraserhead is not a perfect movie.  It's heavy on the symbolism (one of most overrated aspects of art), but the images are creepy and quite breathtaking actually. it's one of the very movies that's heavy of symbolism that works.  It's not a mere crappy boring art movie made by some idiot.  It's still a little pretentious (as most Lynch movies, especially Mulholland Drive), but unlike the average ""art"" movie that has no atmosphere, this one is very immerse and creates a world that you will not want to leave, and will enjoy the whole ride for it's 90 minute running time.  From the creepy images, to the stunning atmosphere and immerse world, it's a great movie to watch alone, at midnight, with good speakers.  It will immerse you into the world of this movie.

Eraserhead doesn't have much of a plot to speak of, and to be honest, I still have no idea what this movie is about 100 percent, especially after Henry's girlfriend leaves him.  Lynch himself hasn't give many comments to what the movie means.  According to him, this movie is what he was experiencing in Philly at the time, ""a dream of dark and troubling things"", and he has also added that this is most spiritual movie (as there was a bible verse that, according to him, fulfilled his own vision).  It's widely said that Eraserhead is about fatherhood (he began this movie when his first wife was pregnant), but Lynch has said that every interpretation has yet to match his.  Hopefully he might one day say what it is about, but for now, it just leaves us to make our own interpretation.

This movie needs to be watched properly, as watching this in the day would probably diminish the impact greatly.  This movie isn't merely a movie, it's a cinematic experience.  Few movies out there have as much immerse atmosphere and surreal images, this is the reason why surreal can sometimes be breathtaking.  Unlike his other movies which would cross on boring and feel like any other art movie, Eraserhead never loses interest.  And really, how could you go wrong with the Lady in the Radiator, the head in the pool of blood, the baby, and the utterly ugly but strangely beautiful industrial decayed landscape?  Further backed by this is a fantastic sound design work, and the movie would be lost without it.  It's rife with howling wind, a machine-like ambiance, industrial sounds, and various sound effects, from the creepy tinging of a music box, sirens, the whiny cry of the baby, the splattering of a chicken spewing blood, to the delightfully creepy sparse dialogue. The black and white shooting only heightens the experience a great deal.

And really, that's the final cement of Eraserhead's watch-ability, in my opinion.  Despite all of the symbolic elements of the film, taking the whole thing literately works extremely well, perhaps even moreso than symbolically.  Sure, you can find meaning in the decoder-ring symbolism that gives about the same ""a ha!"" satisfaction an ink-blot test (well, not quite.  But sometimes it feels like that.  And that's not good).  But literately, it just works like a surreal dream, an otherworldly world like no other.  Given all of the creepy images, the atmosphere, the sound design, and everything else listed above, taking it all literately gives you one of the most unique experiences ever put onto film.

The DVD is kind of expensive, and the documentary is surprisingly nice considering it's just David Lynch talking for 90 minutes at length.  There really is no deleted scene, just a scene that was cut from the film that plays in the background.  However, even though it takes some thought of what you want this movie to be like, once you get into it, you'll find the 22 dollars will bring you a lot and lot of experiences in the world of Eraserhead.  And that is why this movie continues to compel to this day.",1240185600,3,4198,4.734525447042641
1270884,5,B00003CWPL,"The closest thing to describing Eraserhead is to say it's a film transcription of a very odd dream...

Visually stunning, always surreal. Not sure what the message is (if any) but I'm drawn back to this puppy after I saw it in a theater 30+ years ago...",1239753600,,253,4.382978723404255
1270944,5,B00003CWPL,"I first saw ERASERHEAD at a midnight screening at the Waverly in New York. That was 1978. I was 29 years old at the time. I didn't understand ERASERHEAD then, but the visuals and sounds totally blew me away, and even now, despite the great quality of this DVD, I still maintain that the full effect of the movie can't be appreciated unless experienced in a theater.

ERASERHEAD went through a number of revisions during it's 5 year period of conception, gestation, and birth. David Lynch, had arrived in Hollywood in 1970 to study film at the AFI's Institute for Advanced Film Studies. He had come from Philadelphia, where he went to art school, got married, and unexpectedly became a father. The ERASERHEAD project evolved from a much less ambitious idea. Lynch had already made a number of short animated movies and one combination live action/animated film (the Grandmother),and ERASERHEAD would be his first feature length live action movie. He produced, directed, wrote the script, designed the sets, edited, and mixed the sound of this unique film, which explores the darkest recesses of his then troubled mind, and gave free reign to his wild subconscious imaginings and powerful creative thought processes. Lynch, a child of the small town Pacific Northwest, was deeply affected by his experience in urban Philly. Besides trying to adjust to a dangerous (at times violent) environment that was the polar opposite of what he was accustomed to from childhood, his marriage to 1st wife Peggy, had started deteriorating due to his infidelities. The unplanned arrival of his daughter Jennifer, who was born with club feet, further complicated his life. Rather than collapse under the pressure of these dilemmas, Lynch used them as the source material for ERASERHEAD. The sense of environmental dread, and the conflict between responsibility as a spouse and parent, and responsibilty as a creative artist, vividly manifests itself in ERASERHEAD. Lynch has referred to ERASERHEAD as the real Philadelphia Story.

Henry Spencer, the troubled protaganist with the inflated hairdo, whose life is mechanically controlled by an ominous ""man in a planet"", is almost a cinematic doppelganger for Lynch himself. Henry solemnly treks through an unnamed industrial wasteland to have dinner with the strange family of his girlfriend Mary X. There he learns that he is the father of a deformed baby. He and Mary take the baby back to his apartment, where it's constant crying disturbs them. Mary X has had enough of the wailing monstrosity and leaves, so Henry alone must care for it, but the temptations of a sexy neighbor, and visions of a strange puffy cheeked blond lady who lives in his radiator and sings a song called ""In Heaven"" keep distracting him. The inspiration for the radiator lady came from Lynch's discovery of T.M. during the time he was making the film. She represents the means to an escape from a harsh ""reality"" into an enlightened state. At one point, he dreams he has entered the radiator to commune with her and winds up losing his head which is found by a boy and taken to a pencil factory where it is used as the material for erasers. The symbolism of the mind's ability through meditation to erase a false reality in favor of a heightened consciousness is too obvious to ignore. Henry's squeamish destruction of the baby who symbolized all his troubles in a sick, deformed world, is followed by that iconic image of him, hair ablaze, surrounded by a field of charged particles, as the radiator lady joins him in an embrace that illuminates the screen in white light and abruptly ends in darkness. The ""man in the planet"" is no longer in control. Henry's mind (spirit) has left his physical body to commune with eternity.

ERASERHEAD was originally 2 1/2 hours long. Lynch pared it down to it's present 90 minute running time for general release. In it we find the dark humor, weird characters, and foreboding use of light, darkness, and sound, that will be hallmarks of later projects. After it's original screening in Hollywood, David Lynch's mother reportedly said to him ""God, honey. What have I done?"" What she did, was give birth to a creative genius.",1238198400,4,4173,4.933143669985776
1270945,5,B00003CWPL,"Much like orgasm, sleep is necessary, life-affirming, soul-enhancing and mysterious.

Two things have led me to 'Eraserhead':
1] The recent death of Patrick McGoohan brought back into focus his obsessive cage motifs and dynamic rants against collectivism and conformity - and 2] a heavy cold: your humble scribe has been suffering from a brutal attack of catarrh. When lying down to sleep, the phlegm sticking to the back of my throat is making the same noise as Henry Spencer's horrific issue - Beechams just isn't the answer.

McGoohan's removal is the most telling of the two events. Just as it looks like Lynch will never fully explain 'Eraserhead', so too the hidden substratas of 'the Prisoner' are probably now lost for ever. There are those of us with theories - which however passionately and indignantly we expound - can now never be proved.
Just as it should be.

There isn't sufficient mystery in the world. Not nearly enough child-like wonder.
The pressure of life is a clanking, hissing reality. I have no fear at all of getting old but the thought of ever-increasing responsibility and reliance is breath-restrictingly worrying.

The things that make me jump from sleep aren't terrors of mortality or disease, but mundane fears of phone-calls not made, a deadline missed, an enquiry unattended. Everyday nonsense - sorted in twenty minutes of light and consciousness - takes on twisting, uncomfortable apprehensiveness when the eyelids finally start to flutter.

In Lynch-World horrors are deeply personal, not shared. 'Eraserhead' reminds of Derek Jarman, 'the Wicker Man', Hammer movies (Lynch has definitely seen 'Curse of the Werewolf'), Powell and Pressburger, Cocteau, Morrissey...
It's also the funniest film. Lynch exorcises his inner-demons by laughing at us, and by laughing with him, we laugh at the biggest joke of all...
(Imagine ladies, answering one of those 'lonely hearts' ads and Lynch turning up!  Pockets stuffed with cigarettes, 'the Undiscovered Wit of Noel Edmonds' in one hand, and a dvd of 'Attack of the Mushroom People' in the other!)

'Eraserhead' - furtive and under-hand - is a case of tell the truth and shame the devil. It's not possible to harbour misgivings when the joke being played is such a good one.
Henry, by Jack 'Chaplin' Nance is enthralling. The 'Man in Planet's (obviously the viewer) death throes in the same white light that finally gives Henry the freedom he craves, only to have everything snatched away by 'heaven' is almost Ophulsian in its pathos and symbolism.

The fact that there is no final escape is the political satire, but it's the presentation of 'normal' family life, or God-help-us, family life as Lynch sees it, that gives the comedy its snap and edge.

Insane chickens splutter blood at the worst dinner party in the world, a shoot grows from a mound next to Henry's bed where an alarm clock should be, his unfettered lust for the woman across the hall (very probably a prostitute), his dour, angry partner who is even more consumed by the depressing inevitability of existence than he is...
The tears will roll down your cheeks.

'Songs in the Key of Life' could easily be titled 'Songs From the Key of Dreams'. Without food or water - we die; but take away our sleep and we thrive as conduits. All the best serial killers motives are in their dreams and your appendix can randomly kill you.
We're right on the edge, every hour of every day. Brittle, delicate, full of doubts and unfulfilled aspirations and then lastly, we're hurled into the void.

What you don't realize is That that is the point, wether art makes you happy or upsets you, it's done it's job. The task real film artists set for themselves is AFFECTING people, good or bad, it doesn't matter. As long as the film makes you think or feel something then the film-maker has succeeded. It would be more upsetting if you saw it and had felt nothing and said nothing. Personally, I think that the fact that the film has made so many of you uncomfortable rather than leave you with the feeling of complacency that most modern films do would give Mr. Lynch an extreme sense of satisfaction.

I first saw it on Much Music or MTV years ago, when it became a mainstay of Halloween Week films they ran.  I am entranced by the images and camera angles, film contrasts, lighting, etc., not sitting there with a wet hanky following the sad story line.  Would a sweet and sentimental story, filmed this way have been as effective?  Of course not.  It requires total wierdness from all aspects.  Would Salvador Dali's work have been as effective with pancakes and whipped cream, banana splits and teddy bears floating about?  Of course not.

Was it an interesting ride? Yes. But did I enjoy it? No. I didn't enjoy it not because I didn't ""get it"". I didn't enjoy it for the same reason I wouldn't enjoy looking at a car crash, or at a dead body in the morgue. Yes, I may stop and stare, just like scores of others, gripped by morbid fascination and compelled by my illogical, contradictory human nature. But I would not enjoy it. Some may say that movies this dark and disturbing are not to be enjoyed - and I will respectfully disagree. Shindler's List wasn't enjoyable to watch either; the enjoyment came not from the visual, but from the emotional fullfilment that the film brings the viewer. If you want a more relevant comparison, I would say see ""City of Lost Children"" - while it's also Bizarre with a capital B, there are nevertheless an original and imaginative plot, a rich world, and intriguing characters. There was none of the above in Eraserhead - at least, not in the traditional sense. If you want to see social commentary, deeper underlying meaning, and/or startling revelations, you probably will. But it's more possible that you'll see Eraserhead as nothing more than a collection of bizzare, disturbing, ugly images and sounds compiled to confuse and perturb the viewer. You might peruse the Internet to find frame by frame ""guides"" to this film - and that, to me, is an indication that no matter how original, Eraserhead is not true art. Hide it away and bring it back out a couple hundred years from now, and no one is going to understand it. True art does not need manuals or explanations, it speaks for itself. It survives the test of time. Eraserhead is not art; it is more like a nightmare - you know it's trying to tell you something, but you don't understand a thing, and you can't wait for it to end.",1217030400,9,1946,4.562857142857143

Don't show this to small children!",1213315200,,652,4.166666666666667
1271034,4,B00003CWPL,"This movie is what ""WTF?"" was invented for.  When I first saw this film 25 years ago I was at the age and stage of my life in which I was willing to romanticize something just because it was odd.  Someone might take a dump on fine dinnerware and I'd be inclined to consider it ""edgy"" or ""Freudio-sculpturally brilliant.""  I don't have that kind of energy any longer and I see the world differently.

So it was with interest and forty-eight year old eyes and ears that I sat through my second viewing of Lynch's most famous art film.

And I liked it very much.

I still don't understand the movie (and I think people work too hard trying to impose meaning upon it), but it kept my interest and I loved Lynch's use of black and white, light, nightmare noises, dialogue. . . everything.  This is the Twilight Zone on 'shrooms, a sort of ""Lynch's Inferno"" with an odd protagonist named Henry.  Well, ""protagonist"" is too strong a word.  More like a subject-victim moving through the sad experiment of his own existence, an experiment in which no one's in charge and everything is grinding to some sort of unknowable, nothingesqe end.  Mr. X is an oddity; a little spash of congenial personality with his own quirks in an otherwise dark gray world.  ""The Woman Across The Hall"" seemed to represent that which might remove us or distract us from our responsibilities/duties/things that bind us (the baby).  Who knows?  Oh, and this film might very well put people off on the whole ""having kids"" thing.

I may even watch it again sometime, if I live long enough.",1211932800,,1555,4.566787003610108
1271035,5,B00003CWPL,"Shortly after finishing `Eraserhead' I told my wife that I feel like a different person.  The film, strange as it is, is one of the most incredibly complete films I have ever seen.  It is truly a film about vision and mood and director David Lynch creates the perfect mood for his fantastic vision.  There is so much debate about the meaning of this film and I think that is what will essentially immortalize the film as one of the greatest pieces of cinema ever filmed.  David Lynch has stated that he has yet to read an interpretation of the film that matches his thoughts upon penning it (he even claims that he cannot remember writing the script) and I feel that he will take the films meaning to his grave.  I personally hope he does, for if I knew what to think of this movie then maybe I'd stop thinking about it.  The mere fact that I have no idea what this movie is meant to mean moves me to consider it over and over and over again.

The film, shot in vignettes of strange dream sequences and nightmarish realities, follows Henry Spencer (I just love the hair) as he embarks on fatherhood.  You see Henry and his girlfriend Mary haven't spoken in some time.  He wrongly draws the conclusion that she has severed things with him when in actuality she has been giving birth to their child.  She breaks this news to him over dinner with her eccentric parents.  Forced to marry her, Henry soon finds his apartment filled with the dreadful screams of their new baby who just so happens to be a reptilian monster.  When Mary cannot take the stress of motherhood she returns to her parent's home, leaving Henry to care for the creature alone.

This is really the best way to describe the plot, although the film veers off into Henry's head to create subplots and storylines that deserve our examination.  There is the strangely deformed woman who lives in the radiator who sings to Henry and appears to bring him some comfort.  There is the beautiful woman who lives across the hall who apparently has feelings for Henry and eventually works her way into his bedroom.  There is the `Man in the Planet' and the repeated appearance of umbilical cords that all lead me to my personal conclusion of the films message.

David Lynch has claimed that this film is about all the fears and anxieties he faced in Philadelphia while attending the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts.  In all honestly this helps boast my interpretation.  I feel that `Eraserhead' is Lynch's answer to mans ingrown fear of commitment.  Henry would rather consider his relationship over than pick up the phone and call Mary.  The depiction of the baby as a monster seems to draw on mans fear of fatherhood; the biggest and most important commitment one can make.  There is a scene where the lady in the radiator, while singing and dancing, squashes falling umbilical cords with her feet, to me symbolizing the need for man to sever the cord and be independent and free.  The advances of the beautiful neighbor also impress mans desire for freedom, casting aside the restraints of marriage for a fling.  The man in the planet could serve to represent many things, but looking at his appearance and demeanor I lean towards the idea that this man represents mans disinterest in physical labor; work.  Henry himself is on vacation from his own job as a printer.

Then again, I firmly believe that this interpretation is wrong; it cannot be this simple.

There is a pivotal scene within `Eraserhead' where Henry's head is used to create eraserheads for pencils.  This scene is obviously where the films name is derived from, but it is also the scene that baffles me the most.  It could be an obvious stab at the fact that our brains retain information, thus we can use them to erase what we don't like, but I don't think that `obvious' works in any sense for this movie.  This scene is probably the scene that, if identified, would reveal Lynch's thoughts on this film and it's moral.

The acting in `Eraserhead' is flawless when you consider the type of film this is.  Jack Nance gives one of my favorite male performances as Henry Spencer.  His nervousness is key to creating the mood that Lynch establishes with the film, and if he had dropped the ball then the film would have sunk.  Charlotte Stewart is insanely effective as Mary, but it's Allen Joseph and Jeanne Bates that really make the most of their small roles.  The dinner scene alone is one of the most memorable scenes in the film when it comes to performances, and Bates steals that whole scene with her domineering mother.  Her performance is yet another reason I fall towards the whole `commitment' theory, her character truly proving to be the horrendous wifely stereotype of dominance.  Joseph is great as Mr. X, Mary's father.  His performance is manic and commanding.  Judith Roberts is leering and Laurel Near is entrancing, both actresses embodying their performances magnificently.

Lynch is the true star here though, delivering a rich and fulfilling film that is unlike anything else you've ever seen.  The films rich black and white delivery, not to mention the machinelike score, completely engulf the film and add layers to the feeling, the mood, the structure and construction of this flawless film.

Sure, no one may really know what it all means, but half the brilliance in `Eraserhead' is that very fact.  It is a blessed unknown, a riddle that one must try to crack fully aware that they never will.  Lynch has created a masterpiece, a creative gem that will serve as one of a kind; a film never to be repeated.  `Eraserhead', whether you want to admit it or not, may very well be the greatest film of all time.  Like poet Charles Bukowski stated, after `Eraserhead' there is nothing; ""starting with `Eraserhead' we sit here, click, click, click - nothing.""

1271036,1,B00003CWPL,"I first rented Eraserhead back in the early eighties on the recommendation of someone. Later that year I visited him in the asylum but didn't bother asking why (he considered this movie worth watching). I just assumed it had something to do with bad acid. Nevertheless in the late eighties I rented it again determined that there must be something to this movie I wasn't appreciating. In the late nineties my girlfriend threw it into our basket for an all night viewing of the worst movies ever made. It was last on the list and we had mercifully passed out in each other's arms before even plugging it in the machine. Somewhere around 2001 it showed up on television. I turned it off and went to bed.

There is something unique about Eraserhead in that no matter what category or classification you put it, no matter what angle you view it from and no matter what you compare it to... it stinks! It really is the product of a pathetically sick mind that should be occupied with anything but writing or producing movies. Perhaps flipping burgers is more up David Lynch's alley but please... don't let it be at a restaurant in my city!

Rating this movie a zero it would be much too lenient. Total junk!",1210032000,14,1202,4.534562211981567
1271037,3,B00003CWPL,"...I think this is an effective film, as it apparently sets out to disturb, and it does, in spades. Don't get me wrong, I like weird movies, weird stories, weird music, et cetera, but this is just so nebulous, and Lynch himself has said it is such a personal film, no reviewer, regardless of who they are, will ever accurately sum it up. But it left me with a strange, uncomfortable feeling. It was unpleasant, but I think that was the intent; to have some kind of lingering effect on the viewer. Detractors say it's trash, and nothing but, while fans say it's a masterpiece. To say it's both, sounds like fence-straddling, even though that's what it really is. Both. It's intentionally bad, to the point where any attempts to ""improve"" on it, would completely destroy it.

So much of this movie just seems so pointless, one wonders why they are sitting through it. It really does seem like a long, terrible dream. But the strangeness of it all is done with such conviction, and the fact that the people involved stayed with it from beginning to end, literally for years, until completion, is commendable. Slow and steady wins the race, as they say.

Really, though, how do you hold a film like this up to any standard, when, it being possibly the most bizarre film ever made, has no standard to be measured against? Two recommendations are appropriate to the uninitiated, though: Do not watch this if you are the least bit tired, as the slow pacing and constant rumbling sound in the score, WILL lull you to sleep, however disturbing the images and events on screen are to you. This happened to me, I was tired when I first watched it, and had to scan back to the last part I remembered seeing. The other: if you are a woman expecting a baby, it might not be a good idea to sit through this, which becomes apperent upon viewing. A newborn requires your UNCONDITIONAL love and care, no matter what it is. Pregnancy hormones make a woman a volcano of mood swings, and uh, well...

Some things are just too odd to size up, like the woman in the radiator. This is obviously a dream-within-a-dream concept, and she is, despite her pleasant nature, repulsive. Some say frightening; ""...in Heaven, everything is fine..."" Does she represent the allure of death? Who knows?

The character portrayed by Jack Nance, as the film unfolds, it turns out, is an upstanding man, marrying the woman he impregnated, despite the train-wreck that is her gene pool, and stays with their offspring, but the character in the film I had the most sympathy for, isn't even portrayed by a human being. This newborn ""baby,"" is a complete innocent, and doomed to live in this state of being until (spoiler) Henry (Nance) tries to put the poor little creature out of her (his?) misery, and apparently ends his own life..

In a nutshell, this film is a sequence of images, events and sounds, which disturb and unhinge. It's not funny enough to be a comedy, and it's not scary enough to be horror. I guess it is a classic ""Art Film,"" and the fact that it still gets attention many years later says something. But what, I just don't know.",1209772800,4,3105,4.587387387387388

He roams the rotting, rusting landscape like a ghost, drifting from place to place, uncomfortable no matter where he winds up. Henry is anyone who has ever felt completely out of synch, out of place, out of time. He represents my own insecurities, fears, and general unease. Ever felt like you were on the wrong planet? Welcome to Henry's world. Parental responsibility (curse of the mutant offspring), family (dinner w/ the x-family), passion (the affair w/ the hot, dangerous neighbor), etc. are all just hideous pieces of the terrible whole.

I think ""Eraserhead"" is surely the type of movie most people will either hate (casual, mainstream viewers) or like (an open-minded viewer for film appreciation). I found myself unusually drawn to it (and mesmerized) because quite frankly the more weirder it got, the more interesting it became.

In a nut shell, this film is about the solitary life of a man (who is on vacation from his job as he constantly reminds people) that lives in a run-down almost abandoned building in what appears to be an industrialized, urban city. Throughout the film we learn the man eventually gets a baby that is abnormal (at least appears abnormal to us) with mutant-like features from a woman that appears disturbed (from a family with a disturbed behavior but appears normal looking). The film constantly shows images from what appears (to me) from the man's dreams because he struggles to sleep in the presence of his disturbed wife, screaming mutant baby and the inquisitive, but seductive lady neighbor next door. A lady with a slight, mutant appearance sings about ""dancing in heaven"" every time the man is near his room's heater radiator.

CONS FOR THE MAINSTREAM VIEWER;
It's in black & white. The characters are dull. I don't understand it.

PROS FOR THE INQUISITIVE VIEWER;
The black & white and the dull appearances of the background sets the tone for the film which is dark & depressive. While the images and scenes are disturbing and unusual (such as the menstrutating chicken, the tapeworms & the destruction of the baby), they are memorable because chances are you have never seen a film quite like this. After all, I think one of the unique purposes of film is to create long, lasting impressions. There really isn't much of a plot to this film. It's just open for your own interpretation.

If you can casually watch ""Eraserhead"" and appreciate for what it is and what it attempts to present then you can enjoy it. If you hate it, then you better stick to the mainstream movies with overpaid actors/actresses, multi-billion dollar special effects and the always happy, Hollywood, endings.",1205884800,,2252,5.227146814404432
1271043,4,B00003CWPL,"Finally caught this last night at a midnight type showing. I'd love to give this all my thumb's up but a few elements within the movie I just couldn't take. One being the squiggly tape-wormish creatures that appear during periods of the film. Another being the menstruating miniature chickens and worse of all the alien looking newborn.
But.....and I want to emphasis the but, aside from those quibbles I was drawn and mesmerized by the whole of this film.
I loved the constant sounds of the film. The aural background. The steaming, the hissing, the industrial pounding. The black and white visual textures reminded me of the look of David's next film Elephant Man. Right from the start I was interested in Henry(Jack Nance)...his movements, his speech, his expressions. His small apartment where an old phonograph sits near the door and Henry will place the heavy arm on the black plastic which envelopes the room with an antique music hall caliope courtesy of ""Fats"" Waller. (the night before I had seen ""Be Kind Rewind""). This music perfectly enhances the atmosphere of this scene. Spooky, really. And the needle skips back and forth at the end of the record as the circle goes 'round and 'round. But all of it....Henry's girlfriend, her mother and father, the sitting round at the dinner table. The frozen look on the father's face after asking Henry what's doin'. With the introduction of the baby my interest began to wane and when the scene where Henry is not allowed to leave his room for the crying out of the 'baby' I let sleep enter and I awoke with the final slicing sound from the soundtrack at picture's end. So, you could say I missed a lot. On the other hand, Eraserhead definately made an impression on me and I shall try to stomach the unpleasant elements with a further viewing/rental of the DVD.
update:march 25, 2008
finally did rent this. the dvd included an bonus interview with David Lynch himself. An extremely lengthy interview I must say. I do not know if all versions of this film on dvd provide this extra. But the interview is superb! David gives a T H O R O U G H account of the history of, the making of and his thoughts, opinions and anecdotes pertaining to Eraserhead. I learned watching this and listening to Mr. Lynch speak what a wonderful story teller he is.  There is archival footage of the actual shooting of the film too that screens while David is speaking. This entire extra bonus feature interview was a whole evenings watching all by itself. And, what do you know, I never got around to watching the film before I had to return it.

But one things for sure he makes normal scenes quake with terrifying fear at the sound of just the music. It's always very interesting to see where Directors began and what they started off with..(i am keeping up to date with some new indie/underground films)there's almost an innocence to say 'Here it is i made this what do think?' I wonder deeply what they (Film Companies) first thought when they saw this. It looks like nothing you have ever seen before, truly a surrealist piece shot in shades of black and white interwoven with normal lives currupt and interrupted by other means/forces in some way. It's not one of Lynchs best works, but i always think without a beginning there wouldn't be any of there great latter works. It may not be one of his best Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks Elephant man are better films but what a debut what truly and a original concept. His work still innovates and inspires today without bowing down to Hollywood happy endings or flinching a muscle to ease up atall.

Pros- Original, Scary, weird and bizzare and disturbing.

From that point on the rest is strictly left open to interpretation....

I went through multiple possible meanings. One possibility was I thought everything was dreamed up by him or he was the baby and then finally breaks free from whatever was holding him back.. The true meaning is almost impossible to figure out for sure and I cant stop thinking about what it could have meant. I still have a feeling it was about more than meets the eye, more than just a deformed baby and adulthood- I think it was either about something sexual or something in his head.. maybe inner fears. For instance some kind of psychological inner war with yourself kind of thing or it could have all just been a dream.

I heard this movie was supposedly disturbing... it wasnt. It was like a dream almost. You feel like you are in a another world when watching this movie. Almost transe-like. With this movie its all about the sounds and images more than dialogue.

I read David Lynch said there is a specific meaning and nobody has figured it out yet.. hopefully one day he will say what this movie meant. This was more than a movie, it was an experience.",1194998400,,1400,4.373076923076923

I have some ideas, but this is really a strange film. There's a lot of seemingly random stuff that happens. Whether it is or not, I have no idea. With Lynch it can be hard to tell.

That being said, this is an interesting watch. At first I thought it was ridiculous, but I decided to give it another try, with a different way of thinking about it. To my surprise, that actually worked really well. Trying to piece together the meaning behind all the bizarre occurences, the soundtrack, the imagery: all of these are very appealling to the right type of person.

The soundtrack, especially when Henry is outside, is a little creepy. It can very easily crawl under your skin and rearrange your psyche. Be careful with it. :-)

The black-and-white imagery at first made me a little iffy. I generally dislike black-and-white films, because they're so limited. Most of the time I prefer very ""specific"" colors, used in an artistic fashion. The contrast in Eraserhead, though, is really quite interesting, even striking in some places. It's different from many black-and-white films, in a very good way.

For most people, it's not the kind of thing you can watch over and over and never get tired of it, unless you're trying really hard to figure it out. Even then you'd probably burn yourself out and maybe go crazy.

The bottom-line: If you're into surrealism (really into it, not just pretending to look cool) you will probably find something to enjoy in this.

1271158,5,B00003CWPL,"It's either a testament to this films' artistry and/or a very disturbing & possibly psychotic kink in my nature--but I find ERASERHEAD to be fascinatingly wonderful. The strange vision presented in the film is not so much anti-social as a-social.

It's is unique, to say the least.

ERASERHEAD defies a definitive description because it taps into the inner realm of the viewer--and no two inner realms can ever be the same.

To me the high achievement of David Lynch in his film is that he works with unknown, possibly untrained actors (in some cases anyway) & guides them to produce outstanding performances based on extraordinarily nebulous characters in an even more nebulous & totally bizarre script. In this respect ERASERHEAD brings to mind John Waters' POLYESTER or PINK FLAMINGOS--the main difference being that Water's films have a more-or-less recognizable, if campy, scenario. Even Divine's 300-lbs. drag impersonation is accepted as ""reality"" within the context of the script & its comic format. ERASERHEAD, on the other hand, has no familiar landmarks, not even the illusion of reality, and no place to get your bearings.

But then who needs bearings--for 89 minutes, at any rate?

And those 89 minutes are important, because the film ends exactly at the right moment. Any longer & it might have been expecting too much suspension of belief from the audience.

My favorite moment in the movie is the way bizarre cabaret scene performed by The Lady in The Radiator (picture left). Despite the grotesque setting, the actress turns in a truly mesmerizing & emotive performance. If there is a sort of illusive ""meaning"" in the film, then it is symbolized in this scene: if you can understand the scene, then just maybe you can understand the whole picture.

What I can I expect though; this is (I believe) Lynch's debut feature lenghth film, and he definately improved his work on other films. I heard that this was Lynch's commentary on the birth of this first child. That makes sense; I guess he was frustrated with being a new parent, and it shows in this film. I'd recommend it only to true Lynchian fans who are curious about all of his work and to people who like ambigious, confusing films.

1271253,5,B00003CWPL,"David Lynch is a genius. From his more ""mainstream"" movies, such as Dune and Elephant Man, to his quirkier works like Wild At Heart, Lost Highway, Mulholland Drive, Blue Velvet and more recently Inland Empire, his films have been dark, creepy, moody and often, at the same time, hilariously funny. His visual imagery, while often simple and stark is also awe inspiring. He uses light and shadow with music and sound to create mood like no one else. Surreal twists of fate and bizarre happenings mark all of his work. He took all of that creative brilliance and changed television forever with Twin Peaks. People often ask of his work "",What does it mean?"" I think his most lasting gift is that it always means whatever you want it to.
  Eraserhead is a masterpiece, creating for us a lonely, dark, industrial world of looming shadows and ominous stretches of silence peppered with clever twists of plot and dialouge. It is an introduction to the world of David Lynch, rich with all the promise of the filmaker's career that it ushered in. Perhaps one of the most atmospheric movies ever made it stands alone as a classic in a genre it created. Brilliant!!",1185148800,2,1155,4.712871287128713

This is the most creepy, depressing movie that I've ever seen. The one thing that I do know is that this movie is supposed to be a dream(or a nightmare I should say). I've also had the idea of turning a dream into a film(or a film into a dream)and can see that David Lynch had that same thought almost forty years ago and pulls it off perfectly. If you have one of those dream trans-later books lying around it would probably help to dig it out for a viewing of ""Eraserhead"".
I believe in actuality that Henry Spencer is a normal man with a some-what
normal life and that we are just witnessing his dreams and his doubts about life, lack of communication in his relationship,doubts of being a father, loneliness, suicide and the after-life. I don't think anybody really knows what the message is behind ""Eraserhead or if there is a message but thats the great thing about it.

1271260,5,B00003CWPL,"I've watched several David Lynch films before and now that I've finally watched Eraserhead, I feel that I have a deeper understanding of Lynch and his films.

I think a lot of people who have watched Eraserhead have probably said, ""What the hell was that?  That was boring, pointless, pretentious and made no sense whatsoever.""  On the other end of the spectrum, many people might try to find some meaning with the film and try to make sense of Eraserhead in terms of it's imagery and the narrative.

I think they're both missing the point.

Eraserhead is a film that you surrender yourself to and absorb.  It's a work of art, a dark, surreal painting with real people that has been committed to film.  It's a gateway into the psyche and unconsciousness of a young artist (at the time) named David Lynch.  The film is an experience - probably as close as you'll ever get to being able to watch someone's darkest, strangest dream unfold on your home theatre.

So is it good art?  I think so.  Good art should provoke a reaction in the person experiencing it, and Eraserhead certainly did that for me.  It left me feeling unsettled and bewildered but at the same time I had the thrill of knowing I had just watched something completely unique, haunting, funny and in it's own weird way, beautiful.

Of course, beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  Eraserhead certainly isn't for everyone, but I recommende it for film buffs, David Lynch fans and anyone who thinks movies can be more than just mindless entertainment.",1180742400,3,1515,4.646616541353383

I saw this movie a dozen times on the midnight circuit over the years, and with gems like ""Pink Flamingos"" and ""Phantom of the Paradise"" and ""Freaks"" and ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"", the midnight movie became my staple for a long, long time. Of them all, ""Eraserhead"" ruled supreme. I have had various versions of this over the years, and have seen it more than 30 times. This is the movie that makes, or breaks a relationship. Really. I have my own interpretation of this movie, but you probably wouldn't agree. Henry, our hapless hero, marries into a family that makes the fine folks in ""Two Thousand Maniacs"" look like the Cleavers. She is pregnant (the horror!) and has a baby that makes ""It"" look like an angel. Henry is tempted by the neighborhood harlot, falls in love with the Cauliflower Lady (who sings the beautiful ""In Heaven"")and wanders about looking generally uncomfortable. The kicker is that his head pops off..... and is scooped up by a kid who sells it so that standard #2 pencil erasers can be made from it..... yeah, that kind of movie. This is a GORGEOS print, of one of the greatest movies of all time.

I finally saw this legendary cult favorite, Lynch's first feature shot in black and white with the most unusual sound effects and arresting visuals for the first time and I had rather unusual reaction to the film. Its genre is presented as combination of Fantasy / Drama / Horror and the keywords that have been used the most are disturbing, depressing, and bizarre. I found the movie hysterically funny and I laughed for the first 80 minutes of it (I saw the 88 minutes long version). The ending is surely disturbing and unpleasant but the movie has so many comical scenes and images that I wonder if someone else has got the same impression? How about Henry Spencer's (Jack Nance) electrified-looking hair that seems to point to Heaven, where ""everything is fine. You've got your good things. And I've got mine"" as sung by Lady in the Radiator (tell me she was not hilarious)? The dinner at X family with the carving of chicken scene in particular is a comical masterwork. How about a mutant baby? I think there is (or should be) a rule - the scariest monster is the one that we never see, the uncertainty is the scariest monster of all and as long as we don't see it we picture it in our imagination and get scared of what we imagine. Once the monster is for us to see, it is not scary anymore, it is laughable...

After the movie was over and left me puzzled and uncertain to what I just saw, I decided to watch the interview with Lynch to see what the father of ""Eraserhead"" has to say about his movie, its idea, his interpretation. I've got to tell you that he did an awesome job in not telling anything about his own vision of what he created. The interview was longer than the movie and Lynch recalled the smallest details about the days (and months and years) of working on his first film while he was a student at the American Film Institute's Center for Advanced Film Studies when he was shooting mostly at night and used the most unusual buildings for his story or rather for collection of nightmarish images accompanied with the soundtrack that sounds like it was recorded in a machine shop. Yes, Lynch talked about many things but when it came to the question on what the movie is about he only said that for 25 years since the movie was released, he had never heard or read a single comment from the critics, viewers or reviewers that would come close to what his vision or concept was. Not a single one. The major impression I had that the movie was a meditation on the male-female relationship that culminates in parenting, and how far from ideal it could get. His first marriage ended while he was directing ""Eraserhead"" and there was a child from the marriage. My guess is that maybe Lynch did intend to bring his own bitterness, resentment, and disappointments to his first movie and during all those years he had been working on it, he turned it into the dark comedy.",1178755200,3,2931,4.49718574108818

I absolutely love this film, it is in my top 10 list at NO.2.

It has a deep and profound resonating tone of wit and strange mind bending imagination that I love.

Yes Mr Lynch owes much to German Surrealist movie makers and artists, but he brings something more to this genre that almost defies description.

This film is a living surrealist artwork and without disappearing into some artsy intellectual critique, I just say, watch this film, soak your dendrite's in this mire of dark dreamy nightmare's.

I don't really want to be so pretentious as to state that I understand Lynch's themes and ideas that are the genius that is Eraserhead....But I am compelled...

Eraserhead is partly an illusive lucid dark response to the hood placed over the father's head as he is dragged to the gallows that is responsibility of making and raising a baby.......

Fatherhood as nightmare without a manual....in the end in heaven everything may be fine, but life on earth is a nightmare....The rest is purely up to the eye of the beholder and there in lies the genius.

1271355,5,B00003CWPL,"This was the  film debut of David Lynch, the most prominent promise in what concerns to imagery and display of nightmarish implications. After the raising of John Carpenter (Dark star) and Nicholas Roeg (Performance) in the early seventies, the figure of the weird presence of Lynch augured for many viewers at that moment a career filled of innovative proposals; and the time finally has been the best judge.

A good part of the monstrous creative talent of David Lynch resides in having translated and formulated in terms of semiotic language, peculiar dreams, devilish landscapes and claustrophobic ambiances impregnated and nourished of sardonic humor and surrealistic visions ( the sequence of the bleeding chicken, for instance).

The essential core of the bizarre universe of David Lynch may be found in this post- apocalyptic nightmare, hovered by shocking sequences that basically work out as a huge background of this poignant love story around a weird couple who has given birth a very strange creature (that reminds us closely to the horrid Alien 1). This hateful presence of this devilish being conforms the horror in its most brutal nakedness and at the meantime allows Lynch to show us part of his never ending imagery, filled of sarcastic touches and spasmodic visions.

Like Bunuel, Lynch simply carves in relief his obsessions, without trying to explain or solve nothing. He is a social scalpel, a febrile entomologist that exposes with crude realism the sinister symbols that conform his personal vision of the world.

You know what implies to follow the indications of this talented and outlaw filmmaker, but it will be an absolute reward in case you do. Since its release, the film achieved a cult status all around the world.

As for ""Eraserhead,"" think of it as a combination of Kafka's ""Metamorphoses"" and T. S. Eliot's ""The Wasteland"" told in the cinematic style of Bunuel/Dali's ""Un Chien Andalou."" The area in which Lynch strikes me as inarguably inventive if not innovative is in the use of the soundtrack to convey narrative and emotional meaning. Not since Orson Welles (who parlayed his radio creativity into movie fame) has a filmmaker found more ways for representing the sonic dimensions of human experience. Whereas Welles used reverberation in conjunction with deep focus to convey the sense of space separating human beings, Lynch employs much ""white noise"" to take us into an ""inner space"" of expectation, anxiety, and dread. Put another way, he's a master at recording the ""silence"" that, as Robert Frost puts it in ""Desert Places,"" scares us all.

Besides the emptiness of his spiritless surroundings, Henry (the protagonist) clearly suffers from acute anxieties towards women--they entice, seduce, threaten, trap and abandon, alternately motivate and disintegrate any sense of ""self,"" their biology constantly returning him to a natural ""muck"" that is hardly a satisfying alternative to the denatured and depressing industrial world.

I'm left pondering the meaning of the title. Henry's high hairdo could be described as an eraser, though it looks more like a broom or brush hiding the pinhead-sized structure beneath it. When Henry loses his head (quite literally) and a boy brings it to a pencil factory, we get our fullest glimpse of what Lynch might have in mind. The ""natural"" wood of the pencils is parodied by their assembly-line production. When the machine operator occasionally tests one of the pencils by scribbling something and then immediately erasing it, we sense the illusory quality of human thought and the notion of a coherent and continuous ""self."" In that respect, human identity along with what I've just written and the film itself are all extremely tenuous and erasable--an ending that might be viewed as the antithesis to that of ""The Elephant Man"" (""Nothing can ever die. Nothing"").",1168041600,3,2499,5.196029776674938

If you watched a documentary of someone, would you be pissed off if they cut out anything at all, including scenes where people just sit around, or perform mundane activities like making salads?

Eraserhead is an experiment in patience (on the viewer's part.)  It starts slowly, the (meager) plot unfolds slowly, and it ends slowly.  Nothing is lost by watching this movie 2x-4x (except the... unique... soundtrack.)  There ARE some interesting/worthwhile scenes but they are few and far between.  There are however, many riveting scenes such as someone getting out of bed, in bed, and out again, someone else walking, walking, walking.  People sitting on a couch.  A woman ululating for no apparent reason.  And many many more.  I don't know about you, but my dreams are more interesting than this.  This film really could have benefited from having 30 minutes or more cut out, but it seems to me like the director felt it necessary to pad the film with unecessary scenes in order to make it 'feature length.'  It's possible to have an artsy film not be boring (see Space Odyssey, Waking Life) but I think you need a little more than what is presented in this film.

If you've never seen this movie before and don't really know what it's about, I highly recommend you rent it first.  This film is not for many people.

Since this film is about 1 quarter interesting and 3 quarters boring, I give it 1.5 stars, plus .5 stars for a good job on the baby.",1164067200,12,1852,4.565349544072948
1271533,5,B00003CWPL,"Eraserhead is filled with strange, uncanny scenes.  What is it to be uncanny? Dictionary.com defines it as having or seeming to have a supernatural or inexplicable basis; beyond the ordinary or normal; mysterious; arousing superstitious fear or dread; uncomfortably strange.  I would want to define it for this film as the quality of being familiar and strange at the same time. One has the sense of having never seen such weirdness and having vaguely remembered seeing it somewhere.

The movie does not have a linear, logical storyline.  It is a mood piece, for want of a better term.  A visual poem, which depends on what the viewer brings to the interpretation as much as what appears on the screen.  If you let your mind play among these images, it will begin to invent meaning for itself.  You may be surprised and enlightened at what meanings you find in it.

The cinematography is stunning, not beautiful in any traditional meaning of that term, but arresting: you simply cannot turn your head away.

Will you like it?  Well, I think this is one of those movies you either love or hate.  Think of it as a Rorshach -- how interesting you find it may just depend on how interesting you are!",1158019200,5,1195,4.669856459330144

This stinker convinced me Mr. Lynch owned shares in Kodak and wanted to sell film by the mile.  The only reason you may want to see this is so you will convince yourself never to see a David Lynch work ever again.  Do not buy it!!  Manos, The Hands of Fate is much more watchable than this.

I get Brian Eno and ambient/atmosphere music is so you will use it as a background along with your imagination to create your own inner experience.  Film doesn't work that way (another reviewer compared this with Eno).

I find Memento a brilliant piece of work, really making me forget I am watching a film.  I think Videodrome is wonderful and compelling.  This - make sure you can watch something else.  Watch this in 100x speed.  You won't miss a thing.

Okay, I just remembered, there is one movie worse than this one.  Reflections Of Evil.  If you actually like Eraserhead then get that movie too.

1271536,3,B00003CWPL,"I'm a little behind the times, never having seen this, the first of David Lynch's films. But having viewed it only last night, it's still too early for me to tell whether ""Eraserhead"" is a weird batch of disconnected and meaningless nonsense, or something more.

For now, I'll settle for faint praise by calling it...interesting.

I'll say this: the film does not lack for fascinating visuals. Henry, the film's protagonist, sports a bushy, foot-high coif that becomes a signature of the film. Another classic image is of a stiff-limbed Henry waiting patiently a good 30 seconds for elevator doors to close. Then there's the bizarre babbling of Mrs. X (the mother of Henry's paramour, Mary) and the odd alien baby that Henry and Mary seemingly produce. The goo-spouting tiny chickens offered for dinner by Mr. X certainly keep your attention, as does the gorgeous neighbor across the hall that Henry lusts after. And let's not forget the dream sequence in which matter from Henry's head is used to manufacture pencil erasers. Phew!

""Eraserhead"" is vintage Lynch. There are dreams within fantasies within bizarre real-life. There are inexplicable elements -- black planets and a little wormy thing that Henry puts into his cupboard -- that defy analysis. There's the bizarre, as with the ""Girl in the Radiator,"" the puffy-jowled young dancer who minces across a small stage while wormy aliens fall from above.

The film as transferred to DVD is extremely well produced. The lighting captures the grime and rundown appearance of Henry's flat. The industrial sound effects, while relentless, are perfect. There seems to be not a stray spot on the image nor any stray blip in the soundtrack...which makes you suspect that a director who exerts such loving care on production values *must* be communicating something of worth.

The DVD extras are mostly comprised of a 90-minute long interview with Lynch, looking back 30 years to the shooting of Eraserhead. Interspersed with old video and photos from the 6-year shoot, Lynch's monologue is rambling and halting and occasionally illuminating. Most instructively, he claims that no one in the quarter century since the film's release has interpreted the film the way he did. Don't expect Lynch to spill the beans on his idea of the film's meaning. But for those who find the film hard to understand, don't worry. You're evidently in good company.

I'm proud to say that Eraserhead is one of my all time favorite movies.  Everything about it is dream like, nightmarish, and surreal, making it one of the most unique experiences one will ever encounter in cinema.

Eraserhead's content and story can't be explained with words.  You must see it to really understand it.  Basically it revolves around a paranoid man in a decaying industrial world who discovers he is the father to a hideous mutant baby.

Like David Lynch's other films, there is no official explanation to Eraserhead.  It is up to the audience to figure out what all of the symbolism means.

Eraserhead isn't for everyone.  It is easily the weirdest movie ever made, and it can be disturbing to certain viewers.  However, the artistic quality is great, and the surrealism makes it unlike any other movie.

Bottom line, whether you love it or hate it, Eraserhead is definately worth viewing.  The meaning behind it is up to the viewer to decide.",1153612800,5,1057,4.811111111111111

Show them computer cars or appeal to the urban demographic. Its you and him in constant communion.

 As a side note while watching Eraserhead. I couldn't help but thinking to myself: that Raimi wholesale lifted effects and moods straight out of Eraserhead for Evil Dead. Its so obvious, Raimi could at least have tried to mask it a little, I cant believe he didn't find it a little embarassing to be so unoriginal.",1151280000,3,711,4.503875968992248

1271626,5,B00003CWPL,"I saw this movie when I was still in high school over my Christmas break. Needless to say, it completely ruined my vacation. Nonetheles, when the new DVD came out, I was extremely reluctant to purchase it as the horrible feeling that followed seemed to sink back in. However, the huge Lynch fan that I am, I gave it another go.

The first thing that I noticed after purchasing the DVD is how crisp and clear the picture is. Never before has anything lynchian looked this good. Additionally, the sound is as great as it was when I first watched it. It's beautiful, mysterious, haunting, and challenging. After the movie ends, silence is horrible company and the urge to turn on a radio is overbearing. The extra features are incredibly interesting and worth a look as well. David Lynch always gave great interviews.

However, what impacted me the most this time around was the story. Not completely understanding the film in high school, this second time around was a real treat for me as my tastes in film have developed greatly. Eraserhead is a piece of art that combines the imagination of Lynch, the style of the painter Francis Bacon, and the technique of the late director Kubrick. It challenges our concept of reality, morality, loneliness and perhaps even concepts of what defines sanity.

Eraserhead isn't simply a movie; it's the first and most powerful movement in a musical piece for an artist that has shocked and awed American crowds for over forty years. The last time I watched Eraserhead, I cried. I wept for the charcters and the creativity that was delivered. If you seek both inspiration and sensationalistic imgagination, watch Eraserhead. You will be only too happy to be caught up in this horrorifying tragety.",1148601600,9,1732,4.824915824915825
1271716,5,B00003CWPL,"David Lynch's ERASERHEAD is a cult classic that has wowed, befuddled, and even angered audiences for nearly thirty years.  It was one of Stanley Kubrick's favorite films, and it impressed George Lucas to the point where he asked Lynch to direct RETURN OF THE JEDI (Lynch declined, opting to direct DUNE instead).  Still, ERASERHEAD never got much farther than cult status.  This is somewhat saddening, because the movie truly deserves more.

As with most of David Lynch's films, not a whole lot is clear here.  One can't be sure whether this is all just one big nightmare or a look at a post-apocalyptic future.  Whatever the case, this much is clear: ERASERHEAD revolves around Henry Spencer (Jack Nance), a young man with an absurd hairstyle.  Henry is in the printing service.  He was dating Mary X (Charlotte Stewart), but then she disappeared for a time.  She suddenly reappears and invites Henry to dinner with her parents (Allen Joseph and Jeanne Bates).  There, Henry discovers that Mary has given birth to a premature baby, although Mary admits that the doctors aren't sure whether it's a baby or not (!).  Mrs. X - Mary's mother - forces Henry to marry Mary.  Thus Henry deals with his moody girlfriend while taking care of his horrific baby.

If this sounds odd, or even a bit scary, you may have a hard time enduring ERASERHEAD.  It really isn't an easy movie to watch - it's filled with terrifying images and surrounded by an atmosphere of unease.  The dialogue is abnormal and weird to the point where it's frightening.  The fact that we really have no clue what the movie's about makes it even more chilling.  David Lynch has said that this movie was how he dealt with his fear of becoming a father, but neither he nor anyone else has ever disclosed any more information.  (By the way, if you're pregnant or a soon-to-be father, STEER CLEAR OF THIS MOVIE.)

The special effects, by Lynch himself, are extraodinary.  Henry's baby, no doubt the most famous (or infamous) part of the film, is absolutely horrific.  (To this day, Lynch won't even give a hint as to how the baby was made, though there's a rumor that it was made from an embalmed cow fetus.)  The black and white cinematography is exemplary, really emphasizing just how bleak and depressing this industrial world is.  The movie's soundtrack consists primarily of mechanical and industrial sounds which run throughout most of the movie, creating a sort of claustrophobic feeling.  There's also a few brief snippets of carnival-style music, as well as a great musical number performed by the ""Lady in the Radiator"", entitled ""In Heaven"".

ERASERHEAD has more in common with austere surrealist paintings than it does with other films.  Lynch succeeds in making a stylish, gruesome, depressing, horrifying, and yet shockingly beautiful movie which a meaning so deep (or non-existent) that to this day, audiences still haven't figured it out.  I was completely mesmerized throughout the film, unable to avert my attention from David Lynch's brilliant, repulsive masterpiece.  I think one can safely say that a review can not do this film justice.  The only way to really know ERASERHEAD is to watch it.  It's a film much darker and more bizarre than David Lynch's other films - after all, it's a horror/fantasy - but it still ranks amongst the master director's finest works.

One of the greatest aspects of Lynch's films is that they leave it up to you to interpret them as you will.  ERASERHEAD is no different.  It's an uncrackable enigma, ready to be interpreted in any way but impossible to truly solve.",1147824000,9,3579,4.843492586490939

You will notice the lulls and lack of editing if you watch with others. It's more like a wierd book to read quietly in your home.

Now, I think it's one of the best surreal films ever made. Seeing Lynch's other works since then has enabled me to see Eraserhead as his warped masterpiece.

The lighting and cinematography are great, and the lack of dialogue adds to the creepiness. It's a wonderfully nightmarish dreamscape of the macabre world of Henry Spencer.

Because there is no correct explanation of the film's meaning, it's a beautifully obscure work that can be interpreted differently with every viewing. Lynch has said that all the explanations he's seen of the film don't come close to the meaning he intended--and I hope he never explains it.

Some of his movies I absolutely love (Lost Highway, Mulholland Drive, the Twin Peaks series) while there are others that I see as being absolutely pointless (Blue Velvet, and this film).  Eraserhead is an exercise in style, and nothing else.  If you just look at it from that angle, it is a very stylistic, cool, creepy movie.  However, looking at the film from the viewpoint of a normal movie fan, you will get absolutely nothing out of this movie.  It basically has no plot, and the film is tough to follow because of the complete lack of dialog.  Conversations are sparse in this movie, and when people do talk there is nothing to give the viewer any more clue as to what is going on.

The main character of the film, Henry, is a paranoid, nerdy man who lives alone in a one-room apartment.  Henry has apparently been in a relationship with a girl, and when he goes to her parents' house for dinner, he finds out that she was pregnant and gave birth to some sort of creature (definitely not a human child).  So they get married (I assume) and move into Henry's apartment together, while keeping the newborn creature on top of a dresser.  The rest of the film is basically about how the creature drives both of them crazy, and, as most David Lynch films do, the movie ends without really revealing anything of what it all means.

I like some of David Lynch's stuff because while it might be impossible to ""get,"" he at least makes good movies that are interesting.  This film wasn't even interesting, and it had no semblance of meaning or purpose.  Mostly it was just a creepy, unnerving film about horrible things happening to weird people.

1271724,5,B00003CWPL,"Some films target your mind and seek to educate you.  Some films expect you to put your mind on hold and pull for a purely emotional reaction.  A few films (darn few these days) seek to stimulate both the mind and the heart together.  ""Eraserhead"" is none of these; it is a visual experience that invites your mind's input, but only after your most basic emotions have had their fill.  If that sounds confusing, brother we're just getting warmed up.

I will not relay the events that take place on the screen (I prefer not to say "" the plot"" as that term feels limiting).  A description of the events would be counterproductive; it would not elicit a basal emotional response.  Suffice it to say that odd events take place, framed in an environment that both challenges and directs the senses.  Auditorially, the film has a ubiquitous background of almost rhythymic industrial noises.  Visually, the film is balck and white, shrouded by ill defined borders and shados.  This framework gives the events a dream-like quality.  The events are strange, and yet, strangely familiar (new parents and guys who have met their girl's parents over dinner will recognize some of the feelings protrayed in the film).

After seeing ""Eraserhead"" you are likely to feel confused.  Try to resist the impulse to analyze it intellectually.  Instead, take stock of your feelings.  Did the film repulse you, attract you, or both?  Are you intrigued?  Disgusted?  Nervous?  Excited?  Personally, I had numerous emotional reactions to the film, some of which developed gradually.  That kind of varied response is something vast majority of banal Hollywood fare can never hope to provide.

Above all, avoid the temptation to make ""Eraserhead"" a mere intellectual exercise.  Anyone claiming to know the ""true meaning"" of the film is either deluded or putting you on.

I think it is about how life always manages to be both enduring and harsh no matter how good we have it at times.  Human nature is compelling and contradictory sometimes simultaneously.  The visual themes usually have a distorted way to them as if man made or manufactured.  The organic materials even seem somehow void of life which makes for very dreary watching.  I don`t quite know how to describe the experience, but, I know why you should sit through from beginning to end for this film.  It manages to make more sense when you have seen it all in one.  The cut Lynch originally had shown probably would have made less sense if that`s possible.  He went back in and trimmed the thing based on his first screenings.  Hard to place my finger on something so imagined.  The are imaginings within imaginings that can make the viewer perhaps uneasy with complexity to have an easy happy read - or a simple sad read.  There is no easy read to this riddle.  One thing I`d like to note is that I didn`t feel bad, sad, or happy for any of the characters either.  Maybe because I never really could understand anyone`s motives for their actions through-out.  One more reason to have this industrialized feeling about all of it.

Since it was a David Lynch movie, I knew that it was going to be bizarre, but I had no idea just how bizarre it could get.  Maybe I missed the point, but there just didn't seem to be much to figure out.  The girls that I watched this movie with (Elizabeth and Roma) have since revoked my movie choosing privileges.

Anyway, to me this movie was just way too abstract, had very, very sparse and bizarre dialogue, and did not seem to make much sense.  A friend of mine had heard of the movie and we watched it on fast forward with me stopping it at several places -- that saved us from wasting so much time and that is the only way I would recomend watching this movie.

Maybe this movie will grow on me, but I will seriously worry about myself if it does.",1141948800,9,1157,4.203619909502263

I think Lynch is one of the most important directors in the whole story of cinema because He succeeds in make his audience to travel between dream and reality, just cinema has to do.

1271821,3,B00003CWPL,"This may be the weirdest movie I have ever seen, but also one of the most unforgetable.  It supposedly took him 5 years to make it.

It is an indictment of the modern industrial society, pollution,

and social isolation.  The main character works in some non-

descript factory ,  marries, and fathers a ""child"".  The child

is some type of mutant with an eraser like head with its

internal organs contained in a cloth like suit.  The baby cries

all the time.  This family lives in a barren apartment with weird

sights  and sounds happening continuously.  One review I read

said you should see it in a theater as the sounds are more

prominent.  After a while , the story goes all to hell.  The mutant baby reminds me of Rosemary's Baby  where the Mia Farrow

character still loves her baby even if it is the devil.

In any event, it is cettainly worth seeing if only to experience

the David Lynch wierdness.  If you want to see other Lynch

gems, get Blue Velvet, Elephant Man, Lost Highway , and most

importantly , Mulholland Drive, which is a masterpiece.

1271822,5,B00003CWPL,"First off, Eraserhead it is not a movie. It is not a film. It is a piece of art.  Having said that, this movie will not be enjoyed by those who enjoy movies that are mainstream and only made for those not used to watching movies with an open mind.  The movie you are watching here is like 'a piece of art that has to be viewed to be understood'.  This movie is like taking drugs, without taking drugs.  It's a drug in itself.  In fact, I can't even imagine taking drugs with this movie (your head or eraserhead might explode).  This is a movie like no other (written in 1977), but looks like a movie from 2005.  I would compare this movie to Brazil, Naked Lunch or even The Order (Cremaster Series) in the fact that it forces you to watch this movie in almost a stand still (it's like your stunned and not sure what or why your watching this movie).  At the end of the movie, you turn to yourself and say ""Wow, what did I just watch?""

Eraserhead is the other film that excels in sound. A frankly disturbing concoction of industrial score and white noise with undercurrents of musical hall and sonorous church organ, it is almost an extra character in the film, and easily it's most prominent factor.

Yet Eraserhead is to be recommended for more than its incidentals. An impenetrable and gloomy work, what is it actually about? Who is the credited `man in the planet' who pulls levers that control giant spermatozoa? Many questions like this permeate a film which perhaps has to be seen several times to get over the initial shock of it's avant gardism. Lynch extracts the everyday and supplants it with the exceptionally bizarre. The experience of meeting a girlfriend's parents for the first time is never worse than here, where the parents in question gyrate spasmodically to the animated legs of a blood-spitting chicken. It's these scenes - along with the deformed mutant baby - that could lend the film the air of an abortion debate. Birth and repressed sexuality thrive throughout the film, from suckling puppies to the seductive appeal of the `beautiful girl across the hall' and a mother-in-law that gets too close for comfort. I guess the entire film could be a man's mental breakdown when faced with the premature responsibilities of marriage and fatherhood. Though to be honest I couldn't even begin to imagine what it's really all about.

Encroaching blackness fills every scene, where lights are intermittent at best, and at worse fail completely. Often sets - particularly the bedroom when `Mary X' is feeding the child - are like prison cells. Two of the most eerie segments involve a title-explaining dream (?) where Henry's (Nance's) head is carved into pencil rubbers and an unsettling musical number from the `lady in the radiator'. This is the same lady with two candyfloss-like lumps on her cheeks that alternates her stage appearances between stamping on giant sperm to singing with religious convictions.

Direction and cinematography are brilliant throughout, though the climax is the ultimate extension of a film that borders on darker, extremely unpleasant aspects of reality. Folks, if you want to impress your friends that think they have seen it all (and haven't seen Eraserhead, then my friends, this film is a film for anyone who enjoys to go to the 3rd world for a dreamlike, drug indused moment).  I'm still in augh over this film and I've seen it at least 5 times. Must buy for all movie collector's of the abnormal (yet mindblowing movies).  I'm shocked this is Lynch's first movie (he did many shorts prior to this, but for a first movie 'KUDOS' Lynch).  You must see his other great films also... The Shorts Of David Lynch, Mulholland Drive, Lost Highway, Blue Velvet, Hotel Room, Wild At Heart, Lumiere And Company, The Elephant Man, Dune and of course Twin Peaks (The Series) and Twin Peaks - Fire Walk With Me (2 of my favorites).  I'm still patiently waiting for Twin Peaks the 2nd Series and Lost Highway, to come out on DVD (my VHS copies are getting worn out).

1271824,4,B00003CWPL,"I have been a David Lynch fan every since I saw his version of Frank Herbert's sci-fi classic, ""Dune"" on the big screen back in the mid-eighties.  Although it was met with mixed reviews, I just loved the whole visual appearance and the mysterious, brooding atmosphere of the film.  During the time between then and now, I had somehow managed to see and enjoy all of Lynch's major works except for this one, although I had been aware of it.  This is definitely the most avant-garde of his features (way more so than even Lost Highway).  If you're not a fan of movies that play with metaphor and symbolism, you may not like it.  In my opinion, it's not going to be terribly accessible to a majority of viewers.

On the plus side, it's a virtual candy store for those who like to experience a film in a visceral, subjective sort of way and who do not necessarily need to have all (or even any!) answers wrapped up and neatly packaged by the time the credits role.

That doesn't mean we can't have some fun puzzling over Henry's strange quasi-world and try to draw some conclusions from it.  Some questions I find myself asking: who is Henry really and what does he represent?  What is the meaning of the strange string like creatures that keep showing up?  I have come to interpret the image of the dark planet as a sort of anti-Earth, and the man pulling the levers as one of the ambiguous and dark allusions to ""men behind the scenes"" who frequently turn up in Lynch films.  They are the secret manipulators.  The real powers that be.  Who is the lady in the radiator?  I interpret her as one of Henry's alter-egos or possibly Henry's desire to escape.  ""In heaven everything is fine,"" she sings.  I think escape may ultimately represent death, but that (like everything else) is up to interpretation.

Another of Lynch's favorite themes in the film is the stark, industrial feel to this world.  Henry lives in a grim place of factories and pumping stations and concrete and grime and loud noises made by mostly unseen machines and unknown entities.  Eraserhead is presented in black and white.  It lends to the feeling of fear and uncertainty that we empathically feel for Henry.

Typically I've enjoyed how Lynch can take the common place and give it a twist into the surreal.  By the end of Eraserhead, I find myself wondering if maybe I'm just not ""getting it"", but maybe that's the point.  Like an abstract painting, the meaning is subjective, and that's half of the fun of the experience.",1140480000,,2493,4.577878103837472
1271884,4,B00003CWPL,"I first saw this film when I was about 18 years old. It didn't make much sense to me then, and it doesn't make much sense to me now. But I remember the fun we had as we would repeat the lines of the movie, over and over again. It never was a horror film to us, but rather a different type of satire.

There are only a few parts of this movie that you might want to review prior to youth watching. The scene with the mother asking about the relationship he has with her daughter, and a scene with the lady across the hall. Other than those few scenes, this is a classic film that will keep you entertained each time you watch.",1140393600,,625,4.0
1271885,5,B00003CWPL,"Dark, distorted, and disturbing feeling like a nightmare with structure but no logic. It repulses and attracts all at the same time as yuo wait in anticipation for the next bizzar thing to happen.

The gist of the story is this. It centers on the main character Henery. A quiet, shy, easily minipulated young man with a strange taste in hair styles. It basicaly starts out with him going to his girlfriends parents house for dinner. The characters here are strange yet likable especially his girlfriend Mary's father. Forget about any bad time you've ever had meeting the parents for the first time, Henery's includes a bleeding half alive chicken and the knowlege of him being a father. The story then flashes to Henery's place where Mary and the baby are living. Only problem is that the baby was premature and looks more like a skinned alien then anything you would want to call cute. Mary looses her patients one night and leaves suddnely to go to her parents where she can get a decent nights sleep without a baby crying. Here Henery takes responsibility and cares for his baby who is now sick. The rest of the story is a daze of absolutly bizzar situations including a singing lady who lives in the radiator who likes to dance to old roller ring music while stepping on and squashing small embryo looking creatures with unbilical cords still attached.

I don't want to give the ending away but it does keep in line with being as stranges as the rest of the movie. As I said there is no logic to the movie and really no plot either. Keep in mind that it's a nightmare and it makes a little more sence. A must see at least once. You may want to rent it first though just to make sure this is your cup of tea.

The film is, as another friend of mine at the time said, nothing but ""distilled ugliness."" There is no point to it, except perhaps to inject nihilism into the soul. Many scenes are outright hideous (I would never describe them to anyone) and the overall effect is oppressive, dark, and despairing. Having a a meal afterward with my young colleagues, we sensed this heaviness and had to pray to break the spell.

Yes, some will say we missed all the artistic nuance, and so on. No, we were repelled by the repellent. If you want a creative encounter with the possibility of meaninglessness, then consider an early Igmar Bergman film, but not this.",1140048000,28,895,4.767741935483871

1271891,5,B00003CWPL,"David Lynch's first feature-length film is a truly original work of art. There is simply no other movie that is remotely like Eraserhead. The plot is simple enough; a mutant baby is born to an unwed couple in a post-apocalyptic industrial dreamscape. The ensuing events and details that unfold defy any paltry explanation I could give. Suffice to say, the viewer is in for a wildly surreal ride (or multiple rides; I can't count the number of times I've watched it).

Jack Nance delivers a performance that is right on key and somehow lends credibility to the surrounding nightmarish circumstances. He conveys a great deal without words, which is good, since dialogue is exceedingly sparse. It's unfortunate that after this film Nance was mainly relegated to supporting roles.

David Lynch worked on this film for five years, an amount of time that enabled him to achieve a level of perfection that has been realized in only a handful of movies. I only regret that I can't give it more than five stars.",1138665600,4,1002,4.819767441860465
1271892,5,B00003CWPL,"I'm one of those people that saw this movie decades ago and was ready to see it again since my memory had faded. There are many, many undertones in this movie that represent our world today. Hard to follow at times, humorous at other times, and downright disturbing most of the time.

It's the typical storyline. Girl meets boy, have baby, get married. She can't stand the situation and leaves. Baby is left with father. Nothing is normal in this movie, but could be anyone's life. Please read Stanley Allen's review on Amazon. I think he relays much of what it taking place and the symbolism.

Here's my perspective of the baby: I felt sorry for this creature of a baby that was brought into this crazy, insane world. There was something lovable, yes lovable about the innocence of this living being. How traumatic to be brought into this cold, dark world and having a mother that can't and won't take care of you. (Would she have aborted the baby if she had the time? He/it was born so quickly.) Neither parent ever showed love for this child. The baby just layed on the hard table top. They never picked up and barely touched the baby. They didn't know how to love this child or anyone else (including the cute little puppies). No wonder this child cried and cried. I think that Henry was confused and upset that he had brought this child into his terrible world. And the thought of creating another baby with the lady across the hall deeply concerned and scared him. But his desires took over. My heart was crushed when Henry &%$#&%# and I saw the miserable death of the baby. Putting this innocent creature out of its misery relieved Henry. It made me wonder about the number of babies born in the world today, many of which would be better off not being brought into this world at all.

Halfway through the movie I was not sure whether I could continue watching. ""When is this going to be over"" my love and I asked each other, but continued to watch intently. It definitely freaked us out and made us think But, I would much rather watch a movie that is thought provoking. I really appreciated my normal, lovely life after this movie was over. This movie is not for everyone. You'll either like it or hate it....

1271893,4,B00003CWPL,"The one and only, Eraserhead.  What can I say about this film?  I can either say it's boring and stupid, or that it's artsy fartsy or that Lynch is  genius who has created a wonderfully nightmarish film.  Whether it's your thing or not, Lynch has created a rather unique film.  Personally, I'm not gonna tell you that I understand all that is going on.  There is a thin plot running throughout the film, so it's not just a bunch of nonsense that you can't follow.  I just like the mood and feel of the film, which is rather unsettling.  If you allow yourself to get into the mood that is.  Alot of folks will just watch this, shake their heads and not allow themselves to just go with it.  Like most folks say, it's like a filmed nightmare.  That's quite accurate, coz it does play out like one.  It's full of bizarre sounds:  Humming, wind, machinery, steam, strange music, crying, squeaking, factory noises.  The sounds themselves are nightmarish.  The film looks to be either in the future or a really desolated part of town.  Everyone in the film needs psychiatric help coz they say and do oddball things.  With no ""normal"" characters to relate to, you lose all sense of reality.  Even Blue Velvet had a few normal characters to save you from the craziness of it all.  Jack Nance looks either frightened or confused the entire time, yet he is probably the most normal one in the film.  The dvd looks and sounds great.  It even has an 84 minute interview with Lynch about the film.  It's very long winded though.  He talks for a half hour before he even gets to the meat and potatoes of the whole thing.  He tends to get off on tangents that are just downright boring unless you're a drooling Lynch fanatic.  I'm not gonna sit here and tell you this is a great movie.  It's hard to do that coz this film doesn't really exist in any other film category.  It's not really as pretentious and arty as you may think-I think Lynch just did a great job of making an extremely unsettling universe.  If that's artsy, than I guess it is.  People into Lynch and have seen many of his other films will no doubt want to see this.  Not all Lynch fans like this, I've known a few.  Some feel obligated to like it coz it's Lynch, and that's no reason to claim to like a film.  And no, you're not shallow or ""unintelligent"" if you don't like the film.  If anyone calls you ""unintelligent"" for not ""getting"" or enjoying Eraserhead, you can always be happy with the fact that you're at least not a snobby, uptight prick.  I suggest not disregarding the negative or positive reviews posted here.  You will most likely fall into one of the two camps when you finish the film.  However, the staying power of this film cannot be denied.  Many of the negative reviewers state, ""I saw this movie 20 years ago......I saw this years ago.....It sucked and it still sucks!"".  If you saw this film once many years ago and are now looking it up on Amazon to bash it, there is something to be said for that.  Should you watch Eraserhead?  Most definitely.  Then you decide, then tell us how much you love it or hate it.  Now you don't have to wait 20 years to do so.",1138406400,2,3137,4.375

The very simple plot of the movie takes backseat to ERASERHEAD's atmosphere.  Through brilliant sound design, fantastic black and white photography, and the strangest of subjects on which to focus his camera, Lynch has created a fascinating, unnerving tone in this movie.  It is certainly not reality - it is, in fact, quite nightmarish - but Lynch masterfully lets this movie get just close enough to reality to make the nightmare atmosphere extremely chilling.  This film sticks with you, haunting your mind for days after you view ERASERHEAD.

1271991,4,B00003CWPL,"Lynch stretched the boundaries of black & white film to their limits when making this film.  I've read he had to send parts back to the lab repeatedly because the techs kept ""correcting"" it on the assumption that he couldn't possibly have wanted what he asked for...  Consequently, there are scenes that contain extremely subtle images on film which frankly, don't reproduce worth squat in the more limited dynamic range of video.  If it wasn't for that I'd give it 5 stars.  This is the first movie you should use to test to see if HDTV and/or your new plasma TV has any better intensity range, and not just XY resolution.  It may not fare any better in HDTV than it does on NTSC/PAL if all they did is pump up the X & Y when then designed HD.

Otherwise, Lynch has successfully captured the surrealism of a nightmare, along with its disconnected logic and frightening imagery.  The extreme surrealism will no doubt throw many people off, but it's not by any means without plot or point.  It used to be my favorite film until I came to realize I now prefer more optimistic dream-surrealism-- my favorite film has since been Tuvalu, a film that tells its odd little story with far less dialog than Eraserhead (!), and quite a bit more heart.

With Eraserhead, Lynch kicked off (or helped to kick off) the ""industrial"" movement of the 1980s, bringing us new visions of the dark ages of the big cities around 1900 as the industrial revolution began, an updating of the environment in Fritz Lang's Metropolis.  Lynch also used much of this imagery in The Elephant Man, his second best work (after this one), noisy gas lamps, industrial accidents, the oily grime of the proto-industrial city.  Unfortunately, such scare tactics do not seem to have abated the continuing negative effects of industrialism on modern life in the slightest...

Addendum 09/2010:

A lot of the negative reviews on this site claim that there is ""no plot,"" that it is ""abstract,"" pointless, etc.  Frankly, I think there's very little in Eraserhead that has no point.  Certainly it is a nightmarish dream world, but most of it makes sense, if you're paying attention.  This includes things like the faulty electricity, the railroad references including the brakeman (and roller coasters used to use those kind of brakes), the woman in the radiator, the ""premature"" umbilical cords.  It is a dismal caricature of life as the recipient of an unplanned pregnancy.  Henry Spencer inhabits a bleak little universe in which everything is disfunctional, and he's completely resigned to it.  A dream that is so bad that it is short circuiting, going ""off the tracks.""  And Lynch explores Henry's nightmare universe with a magnifying glass.  I'm sure for some people, their unexpected experience as a new parent is every bit as horrible as it is for Henry Spencer, in it's own way.

But despite the bleakness, Eraserhead is packed with droll humor.  It's clear that many people don't get or don't like droll humor (perhaps they should stick to movies like ""Airplane"" instead).  The symbolism is obviously over many of these reviewer's heads, or the references are a bit too obscure, or they just don't have the patience, or just don't find the absurdity of the Lynchian nightmare funny.  And  Lynch, like Kubrick, does not lead you around by the hand and explain everything to you as if you are a child.  Lynch's universe is completely at the other end of the spectrum than Walt Disney's.

One reviewer wrote, ""A woman ululating for no apparent reason.""  Obviously, someone unfamiliar with epileptic seizure.  And combing the hair is an old home remedy, as it would calm the person.  If you've seen any other David Lynch films, you might have noticed that many of his characters have mental disorders or head injuries, it's one of his trademarks...",1137974400,,3810,4.815384615384615

The Movie ""Brazil"" was also disturbing, but at least the cinemetography was a rich visual tapestry.

1271993,5,B00003CWPL,"I find it highly interesting the reaction that this film provokes - there are very few 3 star reviews but many 5 star  and many 1 star reviews. So is it a classic? We're obviously split, but it is easily the most viscerally unforgettable movie ever, for better or for worse depending on where you stand.

This movie is not ""fun"" to watch, so don't expect it for entertainment value. Nor is it an action film - the pacing is slow, and if you give it the chance, quite effective. I would agree with other reviewers that you should watch this before you buy, and be prepared: you are about to have an experience more chilling than any horror movie or more intense than any action movie. If you don't like movies that require the viewer to think deeply and that provoke visceral reactions, you probably shouldn't even try it - you will only end up regretting it because you won't be able to forget it.

It is indeed an ""art film."" However, I would say that the movie's intensity overwhelms the artsy pretentions that in most cases would turn me off immensely.

The symbolic imagery is kind of open to interpretation, although it seems as though the movie's theme generally revolves around a fear of fatherhood. The meal, the sex scene, the baby, the chipmunk woman in the radiator, the eraser factory and the murder are all highly memorable and symbolic images, characters and scenes from the movie, on which there is an echelon of internet analysis.

I can't recommend this movie to everyone, especially not those who expect their movies to be a fun escape with typical plots, cardboard Hollywood characters and happy endings. Even people with more eclectic tastes may hate this movie. Expect to be repulsed, frustrated and upset by this movie, if you want to watch it.

I can't really explain what makes this movie my favorite, but I feel like it touches something deep inside of me, a gritty intensity that pulls me in like no other movie.",1137888000,5,1938,4.619186046511628
1271994,3,B00003CWPL,"A wonderful film.  One of the most important movies of its time.

Yeah, right.

The best way to attend a showing of Eraserhead is to take your own chair and place it near the front of the auditorium facing the crowd.  Observing the audience reactions to this ""interesting"" film is a much more enjoyable and enlightening way to spend 90 minutes than watching what is on the screen.

Bizarre stuff -- kind of intriguing in spots.  May turn you off chicken for a while.  Definitely not a film to see if maintaining a positive outlook on life is not one of your strong points.  It may just push you over the edge.

Otherwise, a good Friday Night film.  You'll forget whatever has been eating at you during the week.  The boss driving you nuts?  About ready to kill your coworkers?  The spouse plucking at your last nerve?  Watch Eraserhead.  You'll forget all about it.

Sorry I can't be anymore descriptive than this; I don't have any kind of reference point to attach it to.  Nobody does.  This is one STRANGE movie.

I actually have a friend who likes this film.  He appears to be a sane, intelligent human being other than that.

The best thing about it is that there is very little likelihood of anyone generating an insipid remake, or any remake for that matter.  It's one of a kind.  And for that, we can be thankful.",1137715200,10,1320,4.453781512605042
1272054,5,B00003CWPL,"I can halfway understand the negative reviewers who give this movie one star and say ""don't waste your time, money, etc."". If you didn't know anything about this movie before watching, chances are you hated it. This film is not standard filmmaking by any stretch.  It has its own unique place, and there are some who will appreciate and be receptive, and there will be others who will not get the point and write caustic reviews on Amazon.  The most fair suggestion I can say is, watch the movie first (or at least research it), then decide to buy or not.

Statements such as ""the Straight Story and Elephant Man were brilliant movies"" can just as easily be refuted.  I hated both of those movies.  The reason I can sit through Eraserhead but not the Straight Story is because I WANT to see something different, something bizarre, something that is open to interpretation.  David Lynch is an artist; I view this movie like I would view a painting.  Is a Jackson Pollock painting 'garbage' or a 'waste of space' because you cannot discern an image in his swirls and sploches?

A good review, or hundreds of good reviews will not change who will like and dislike this movie.  I like it, I stand by it, I vouch for it.  Your average person will not like this movie.  It's weird and hard to watch.  It's unpleasant.  Its low budget.  But those of us who like this movie will not be bothered by negative reviews; I feel the same way about almost every mainstream film that plays in the theatre.

PS.  Why do people critique this movie on a moral basis?  Who ever told you this movie was ever supposed to be uplifting or have a moral lesson?  There are a plethora of other movies with prettied moral lessons or that focus on the 'good' points of humanity...go watch those if that is what you want!  Yin and yang....not every movie has to make you feel good about your life.  This is clearly a negative movie in many regards.

Without question, Lynch has created a virtually flawless piece of cinematography. All the scenes could be a painting, a photograph. Everything has a place, even if the place is without concrete definition. This is abstraction twisted within reality. Maybe, that is the definition of surrealism.

This film certainly is a masterpiece - a definition of cinematic art.

The soundtrack is incredible. It's subtle but intensely powerful. It can't be overlooked. It will affect you and how you react to each scene. Everything has its place.

Its meant as a surrealistic excercise, much more than a conventional dumbed down Hollywood movie where you can guess the ending by the first scene.  As someone who has been through it, whether intentional or not Eraserhead captures the world of schizophrenia and psychosis.  The unbelievable imagery cropping up, such as the scene where Henry is asked to serve dinner and encouraged to ""cut up the chickens like regular chickens"" and they suddenly start bleeding. Yet he is in front of his girlfriend's family so he has to pretend everything is okay.  Things pop out of nowhere, suddenly a litter of puppies, the baby he is forced to take care of is a grotesque monster that he must destroy, the asexual mother like ""radiator lady"" that suddenly redeems him. As well, Eraserhead captures the spirit of the times, dark, industrial and depressing. A crumbling society where everything is dehumanized and degraded as where Henry is literally turned into erasers.  This vision of a dark and bleak world was lifted by everyone from Matthew Barney to Guy Maddin to Begotton to James Fotopolous. There is no other David Lynch film like it.

Ayn Rand has said that, ""Art is a selective re-creation of reality according to an artist's metaphysical value-judgments."" As definitions of art go, this is pretty good. That's why I did not like this work of art: the film was a dark chaos, a nightmare of disconnected events without plot, theme, or direction. The director's values come from a selective representation of reality I strongly dislike. The overview begins, ""This is where the Lynchian nightmare started."" That's an understatement. It is out-and-out nihilism. It is entirely lacking in any values I could connect with.

Instead he educated me to the pretentiousness of the coasts--he roared with laughter through the whole thing!

Not at it, mind you, and it wasn't the nervous laughter of discomfort. He thought it was a great stitch, a merciless funny-as-hell parody on dating, getting your girlfriend (who you don't care much for to begin with) pregnant, dealing with the idiot parents, dealing with the alien baby (as all babies are for a young accidental parent), etc. Dang if my yokel cousin wasn't right and dang if most of the trendies and intellectuals oozing over this wonderful movie weren't missing the point utterly because they had very different lives, more directly in tune with John Water's nearly contemporaneous middle-class rip, Polyester. Eraserhead was working class, laboring folk stuff--it reeks of Akron, Ohio, and Wal-Mart, and homes next to decaying factories that are still, by a thread, in operation.

Since then I've seen this movie as it is and enjoy it as a first-rate black comedy that makes tons and tons of sense. My college friends still don't get it, after all, if the girlfriend gets pregnant it's an inconvenience that's dealt with elsewhere.

First of all, David Lynch is an artist.  I met the man recently in Ann Arbor, Michigan and he stated at the beginning of his talk that he started out as an artist, and in one of his paintings that he did many years ago, he invisioned it moving, thus was born ""Five Men Getting Sick"", which, as the professor mentions, you can purchase, along with other Lynch goodies, at Davidlynch.com!  The video is just that, six men, actually six distorted head like images consistently vomiting to the sound of a siren.  But that is the artist in Mr. Lynch.

Here is my definition of Eraserhead.  The film, to me, represents good versus evil(Lady in the Radiator vs. The Seductive woman across the hall).  Notice how she violently reacts when LITR appears, then all of a sudden she laments ""In heaven, everything is fine.""  Then there's the guy at the beginning of the movie who has power of the controls which, when he starts manipulating them in the beginning of the movie, Henry reacts in a frightened manner, especially when those white, pre-fetus like abominations appear.  The whole movie is, as some of the reviewers put it ""dark and eerie"".

It is a really nice disc to own, and well worth making the extra effort to buy it on his site.  I got mine in a week or so, and it looks very good (they put a lot of work into getting the details just right) and has some nice extras.  Apart from wanting to get the transfer right, I think another reason Lynch decided to do it himself was that he dislikes features on dvds that allow you to skip around from chapter to chapter.  If you are going to see his movie, he wants you to see it in order.  I do think that is his prerogative as an artist.  I can't even get my disc to fast forward any faster than the lowest speed, and I believe that is by design, for much the same reason.

Eraserhead is a movie like none I have seen. It did remind me somewhat of Pi, however. Eraserhead is another cult classic that has a following. However, I found it at times painful to watch (though possibly because I started coming down with the flu while watching it). I have never seen another David Lynch film, as none of them seemed very interesting to me, and after seeing Eraserhead, I doubt I will in the future.

Though I didn't care for the film, I appreciate it for its originality. The actions of the characters are classic and unforgettable, as is the film. Henry, the main character, is the first of many oddballs we see in the film, as he seems to walk around in a daze, or in his own little world. I think my favorite part was the old lady being maneuvered to toss the salad, and then having a cigarette lit for her. I did find it quite annoying (though I'm sure that was Lynch's purpose) when the baby (if that's what you want to call it) is crying and making noises for quite some time while Henry and Mary are trying to sleep.

I'm not sure what Lynch meant to show in this film, other than its oddness and absurdity. It basically has a no plot, or one that you can follow for any length of time. It has little dialogue, very odd characters that appear and disappear without explanation, and dream sequences that make no sense and go nowhere.

I think David Lynch appeals to the cult audience for his humor, which is evident in Eraserhead. It's twisted and almost sick at times. He makes films that he wants to make, not something the mainstream would praise him for, and I respect him for that. Obviously Eraserhead wasn't intended to be seen by the same type of people that would go see Wizard of Oz or Titanic. It was intended for the underground folks who like things to be edgy and not quite make sense, which he achieved with this film.

1272265,5,B00003CWPL,"The earlier reviewer is right: Along with anything else one might say about Eraserhead, it is a loving homage to German Expressionism. One film in that style is ""Der Testament Des Dr. Mabuse"" by Fritz Lang (1933). The movie opens in a dark, cramped and cluttered basement, and a terrible, loud throbbing noise that shakes every object. It was never clear to me what caused the pulsing racket -- but I felt almost certain that it was the heartbeat of the terrified little man hiding behind a crate, waiting for his enemies. I was reminded immediately of Eraserhead.

Periodically through Dr. Mabuse, characters are ushered into a barren room that has been stripped of all furnishings and plumbing; a curtain hangs along the back wall, and a dim light reveals the shadowy outline of a man. The characters refer to him only as ""the man behind the curtain"". That ominous shadow and name felt perfectly David Lynch!

If you enjoyed Eraserhead, keep your eyes open for ""Der Testament Des Dr. Mabuse"" I wholeheartedly recommend it -- and don't be disappointed by the fairly rational resolution at the end -- it is still full of eerie atmosphere and creepiness that will delight any Lynch fan.",1128902400,,1185,4.803921568627451
1272266,5,B00003CWPL,"""Eraserhead"" is the bizarre story of a man named Henry who fathers a prematurely born child that just won't stop crying.  Crying, and crying, crying.

The movie is shot in grainy black and white, and is constanly filled with sound. Crammed with sound: crying, subway cars rushing, pipes clanking, weird organ music playing, machines humming, and the white noise roar of silence, the loudest sound of all, coursing through all of it.

The story unfolds like a dream--and probably actually includes the dreams of the main character as well.  Events transpire associatively--as in dream--going from one thing to the next as a conversation hops from something to something else that one of its speakers was just reminded of.  It doesn't progress at all like a typical narrative, though the darkness and the confusion and the noise and the stress and the awkwardness of it all could classify this movie as a horror film, though it's much, much more.

Its images are stark, and its dialogue almost nonexistent.  When there is dialogue, it's often funny (although creepy): ""Did you and Mary have sexual intercourse?""

A terrific organ music soundtrack underscores much of the movie, and its images, although black and white, will blaze themselves into your brain.

When my younger brother was in high school, he got obsessed with this film.  He watched it literally hundreds of times, painted his room gray, put up ""Eraserhead"" posters, wore a black ""Eraserhead"" T-shirt, stopped bathing, and got weirder and weirder by the day.  He's never quite recovered from it.

This is definitely David Lynch's best in my opinion.  I don't think he's ever equalled it.  It's a great movie to have on in the background of a party, or to watch by yourself late at night.  It's a classic puzzle that no amount of viewings could ever solve, and a fun, wild, weird ride.",1128384000,7,1847,4.893890675241158
1272267,5,B00003CWPL,"In order to enjoy Eraserhead, you must be willing to watch a movie that is almost completely devoid of joy and is so deep and personal that it's painful to watch. If you prefer to watch typical Hollywood fare - action movies, chick flicks, whatever - this is probably not the film for you. I don't mean that to sound elitist, I'm just trying to be honest so you know what you are getting into.

This is not a film to take lightly, and I strongly disagree with a previous reviewer that it is not worth deeper analysis since it is a student art film. On the contrary, the movie is an intense reflection on director David Lynch's fears of fatherhood and a perfect landscape to deeply analyze shallow sex, an unhappy marriage, regret, pain, insanity and redemption. The movie is filled with symbolism, motifs and metaphors. In fact, the movie itself is basically a metaphor.

Actually, I would recommend that people rent this movie before they buy it. It is pricey, and it is definitely an acquired taste.

I find similarly intense thematic and metaphoric parallels (musically) in Neutral Milk Hotel's album ""In the Aeroplane over the Sea"", and (literarily) in Chris Ware's graphic novel ""Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest Kid on Earth."" I recommend these to fans of Eraserhead.

It took five years for David Lynch to finish Eraserhead; despite the low budget, Lynch's movie is very professional and is truly a labored work of art and subtlety.

1. I understand the movie better.

2. I like the movie less.

The movie is about...oops I don't want to let the cat out of the bag. The movie lacks real action, dialogue, and has the feel of an old, cheap plastic toy...classic, yet not intended to stand the test of time. Movie buffs will love it, people on drugs will love it, Lynch fans will love it. Most people will hate it. If you want a movie to fill in the blanks for you, Eraserhead is not your bag. The movie is not exactly rife with plot twists, but its completely untrodden ground, so you have no idea where you'll end up anyway.

If you like movies that are visually and psychologically challenging, then Eraserhead is for you.

I was also disappointed to find out that the subtitles were Korean.

I should also add that you couldn't make me give up my copy of Eraserhead for anything; it's quintessential.",1124755200,4,1097,4.300970873786408

This film also started the tradition of movie houses screening cult flicks at midnight, it actually premiered with a midnight screening! This film also what convinced Mel Brooks that Mr. Lynch was the right person for the job of directing the film version of _The Elephant Man_",1124323200,2,501,4.617977528089888
1272273,4,B00003CWPL,"It's difficult to take Eraserhead seriously, really. It's more of a film student's exercise than a proper film, really; and if Mr. Lynch says in interviews that he refuses to reveal what Eraserhead is about because he wants each viewer to try and figure it out for himself, the only reason for saying it is that he has a mysterious reputation to maintain; or, in other words, he's full of horse manure. Eraserhead is about nothing. It's an exercise in visuals, in visual effects done at minimum budget; and homage to the German Expressionism of the 1920's that Lynch obviously loves so dearly, influences of which are obvious here but can be seen in all of his movies up to Mulholland Drive.

It's painfully pointless to try to find a deeper meaning connecting all the pseudo-surreal dream-scenes in Eraserhead; it's better to just sit back and enjoy the grotesque humor, the creepy visuals and the eerie music and to appreciate Mr. Lynch's unique and strong sense for atmosphere, for his completely original freak-show vision of the grotesque and the bizarre, in the very early stages of its development. Eraserhead is the perfect preface to Lynch's celebrated career, and while most people will find it pretentious, dull and incomprehensible - which, invariably, it truly is - it's essential viewing for devoted fans of this unique director; for lovers of grotesque, dark visual humor; and for students and those interested in the history of cinema, and especially in German Expressionism like that of Murnau and his contemporaries. Remember that this is merely an exercise created by a young and enthusiastic filmmaker making his first steps as a pro; don't judge it too harshly, but also don't bother with the effort of seeking a depth to it.

1272346,5,B00003CWPL,"Well, you see what happened was I met a new friend on-line and he noticed that I review things. His name is The Curmudgeon and I guess he is big over-seas. I think. Anyways, he reccommended a few things for me to review. I sent a member of my web-site team up to Video One to get the DVD and a pizza for me. I'm waiting right now. To use my time efficiently, I'm going to write another review somewhere else while I wait. I'll see you over at the Conan section of Amazon.com.

Okay, I'm back and so is the movie. Er.....movieS I guess....Alright, there's a small problem. He wasn't sure which movie to get.....Says there were 2 different ones he was looking at. Uh-oh. The first one is pretty non-descript, and the other one is an Arnold Shwartsaneger movie. I have no way to get ahold of The Curmudgeon right now. The names ARE kind of similar...I guess it would be easy to confuse them.....Hmmm. I have an idea. Sounds like it's time for the first ever.....DUAL-REVIEW! The Arnold one is on DVD so I'm having these guys play it on a lap-top computer. Sadly enough, he says the other one was only available on Video-Tape. I'll put that one on the V.C.R. they have.

Okay, computer on the left, TV (with V.C.R.) on the right. Alright, they're still setting up the DVD on the lap-top, so I started the V.C.R.......So far, so good. A monster-worm just flew out of a guy's mouth. I'm game.....Hmmmm....Black and White. Wonder if it will change to color like the movie with the girl, and the dog, and the lion, and the wizard, and.....Okay, the DVD is starting on my LEFT side...Ok, well THAT one is in color so it makes up for the RIGHT side's lack of color............Okay, a few minutes have passed. The LEFT side has some mild action stuff....the RIGHT side though, is pretty interesting. The main guy in it is walking out-side and WHOOPS! His foot goes right in a mud-puddle. Kind of reminds me of the Three Stooges by the way it looks. But without any hitting.

Okay....after a while a LOT of action happened on the LEFT, with a really big gun. It's really hard to stop watching. But my eyes are drawn to the RIGHT side now. The guy is at a house and no one is talking to him and he seems uncomfortable. I can totally relate to this. I feel like that sometimes. The old lady looks dead. Wow, the dad at the table seems dangerously enthusiastic. Nobody really talks much and it's akward. Kind of like dinner at my place LOL. The LEFT side is in a boring part. The plot seems IMPOSSIBLE to follow. You know, it's kind of weird. I'm watching the RIGHT side more than the action-move on the LEFT! Okay, WOW! Look what's for dinner at the weird house. AMAZING. Let me watch for a few minutes.

Okay, wow! How do I catch you guys up? Ummm, the LEFT side had a really crazy scene where Arnold is in a gunfight on an airplane and he jumps out and catches a parachute! And the plot is completely lost on me now. But the RIGHT side has blown my mind. There is a mutant-alien thing. But it doesn't look like either a puppet or a muppet. It looks...real. This is crazy. Give me a little while....

Now the LEFT side has alligators! And another wild shoot-out, and EVERYTHING! The RIGHT side is a cloud-nightmare on earth. There is weird little worms and a chipmunk lady that sings, and the alien is out of control and just SCREAMING. I feel like this guy sometimes when I'm around the house with Morris (my dog) and I try to leave and he goes crazy and barks and barks until I come back. Okay, the LEFT side of the movie is...well, I guess you could call it ""pure-action"". If there really is a plot now, it doesn't matter. Arnold has a really big action-gun now. For all I know this is a Terminator sequel. Or prequel. Maybe. HOLY CRAP! On the RIGHT side, the guy that reminds me of me (I think his name might even be the same as mine) has completely been engulfed by his Cloud-Nightmare! He fought the alien, and if I tried to expain what happened next you wouldn't belive me. Some bratty little kid just stole his head and sold it to a pencil-factory. SEE! You don't believe me! I'm not even sure I believe it. WHAT!? I'm being bombarded by both movies at the SAME TIME!! I look to the LEFT, I see a HUGE gunfight with a HUGE gun in a boat-yard! I look RIGHT and I'm absolutely terrified by the chipmunk lady on the screen! Don't touch her! No! AAAAAAAA! Wow... the credits are playing now (RIGHT side only) with some herky-jerky organ music. It compiments the action on the LEFT side, strangely enough. Okay, LEFT side is done with action and almost over. Okay, it's over. That was incredibly rare.

Jeez, you guys simply HAVE to try this. I'm not kidding. See what I did there? I didn't know which movie he wanted me to review, so in an amazing display of innovation, I have created a new reviewing medium. The Dual-Review style. It can serve many purposes. First off, it can enhance two mediocre movies to make a sort of super-movie. Secondly, it can save time on reviewing. I never imagined I could increase my productivity by DOUBLE! And third off, the reader (you guys) can benefit from the review because it's something they just can't get anywhere else. THIS is why I'm the reviewer of the future. I fascinate myself sometimes. Partial credit can be given to my friend, since he reccommended one of these movies, but I'm still not sure which one. Later.

1272350,4,B00003CWPL,"Often called the greatest cult film of all time, ""Eraserhead"" is unlikely to blow you away if you're: 1. seeing it on a small screen; 2. viewing one of the 2nd-rate Asian DVD copies widely available on the internet; 3. already familiar with ""Elephant Man"" and/or ""Blue Velvet,"" both of which combine all of the visual, aural, and thematic elements of ""Eraserhead"" with topnotch production values.

As for ""Eraserhead,"" think of it as a combination of Kafka's ""Metamorphoses"" and T. S. Eliot's ""The Wasteland"" told in the cinematic style of Bunuel/Dali's ""Un Chien Andalou.""  The area in which Lynch strikes me as inarguably inventive if not innovative is in the use of the soundtrack to convey narrative and emotional meaning.  Not since Orson Welles (who parlayed his radio creativity into movie fame) has a filmmaker found more ways for representing the sonic dimensions of human experience.  Whereas Welles used reverberation in conjunction with deep focus to convey the sense of space separating human beings, Lynch employs much ""white noise"" to take us into an ""inner space"" of expectation, anxiety, and dread.  Put another way, he's a master at recording the ""silence"" that, as Robert Frost puts it in ""Desert Places,"" scares us all.

Besides the emptiness of his spiritless surroundings, Henry (the protagonist) clearly suffers from acute anxieties towards women--they entice, seduce, threaten, trap and abandon, alternately motivate and disintegrate any sense of ""self,"" their biology constantly returning him to a natural ""muck"" that is hardly a satisfying alternative to the denatured and depressing industrial world.

I'm left pondering the meaning of the title.  Henry's high hairdo could be described as an eraser, though it looks more like a broom or brush hiding the pinhead-sized structure beneath it.  When Henry loses his head (quite literally) and a boy brings it to a pencil factory, we get our fullest glimpse of what Lynch might have in mind.  The ""natural"" wood of the pencils is parodied by their assembly-line production.  When the machine operator occasionally tests one of the pencils by scribbling something and then immediately erasing it, we sense the illusory quality of human thought and the notion of a coherent and continuous ""self.""  In that respect, human identity along with what I've just written and the film itself are all extremely tenuous and erasable--an ending that might be viewed as the antithesis to that of ""The Elephant Man"" (""Nothing can ever die. Nothing"").",1118361600,34,2508,5.196029776674938

Thing just cries, but has signs of intelligence cuz it did not wanna eat food and spits it out.

1272456,3,B00003CWPL,"""Eraserhead"" is a film which challenges the intellect to challenge itself; it is ""experimental"" experimental cinema; it is a gauntlet to the audience, and it threatens to polarize any viewing group into two distinct camps: those who want to try and get it versus those who believe that those who want to try and get it are wasting their time and would be better off coming up with valuations for stocks or something more akin to rank normality.

Trying to sum the film up wouldn't necessarily do it justice, because any formal summary would not take into account the raw, naked style on hand. It's almost impossible to figure out, because all of the variables aren't known, let alone the formula to wrangle them into a species of detectable context (think of complex fractal patterns: there's an equation there somewhere, but it is oftentimes difficult to ascertain). The best I can do is this: We have the protagonist -- the Eraserhead that the title speaks of (in my opinion) although that is not his name -- scurrying about in a seemingly post-apocalyptic world (for those who may know the group Devo beyond the superficial awareness of their hit ""Whip It"", think of that New Wave outfit's imagery and mythology about mutations in industrial suburbia) and trying to care for his mutant chicken-child (again, think Devo), all the while contending with a plethora of heady hallucinations that might have some tangible substance after all.

That's good enough; really, it is.  I suppose I could go on, but I'm sure you've already perused many other interpretations on this site. The thing about ""Eraserhead"" is this (and yes, I know I'm being tautological here): the viewer is thrust into an alternate universe where all the rules about that world is not known; as an example, I'm taking a guess that a kind of ""war"" or ""uprising"" took place that turned many of the citizens into odd, almost zombie-like beings that are functioning on mental levels consistent with Alzheimer's patients. It's never explained. And since the movie is sort of like a surreal music video from the 80's (you know the type, where a song is about a girl falling in love at her junior prom but the promotional clip is set in a sacrificial chamber located far below the base of an Egyptian pyramid, and in the corner of the arena are a group of aliens that look like they came out of the Cthulhu Mythos, trying to develop a cold fusion reaction so they can get back to their home planet) without the music, it's almost as if Lynch is purposely dodging any kind of sensible deconstruction.

Then again, he's probably purposely doing that because, well -- he's David Lynch. For those who wish to have a little fun and can get into the deep arthouse-film spirit, give ""Eraserhead"" a go. It's not a date DVD, by any stretch of the imagination. There's a lot of historical context that this film could be put into, but that would be beyond the scope of this review; feel free to do more research if you are so inclined.",1112832000,3,2988,4.6965648854961835

1272459,2,B00003CWPL,"There is no question that David Lynch has a ""vision"". As his first film, Eraserhead demonstrates that he had the ability and skill to deliver this nightmarish vision to the screen very early on. He is a master at manipulating viewers through minimal mise-en-scene, slow pacing and haunting sound design. What can be questioned is whether or not this nightmare is a trip you want to take. What every other review fails to mention is that this movie is really gross! Not that I have a weak stomach, I actually make it a point to find strange and disturbing flicks (David Cronenberg, Takashi Miike, etc).But I do have limits, and, any type of gore involving babies usually is beyond my limit. That being said, this movie is not for those in planned parenthood. Eraserhead and other films like The Omen, Thirteen, Children Of The Corn and Rosmary's Baby are like contraceptive cinema; Movies that will make you never want to have a kid.

'eraserhead' is not a mindwarp, no, it's more like a vacation, that went bad. only this time, you can't blame the airlines. only yourself.

following the main character, henry, we're thrown, metaphorically, don't think for a second lynch has the capability of actually discarding us around, into this medieval, apocalyptic world. imagine the 40's with a sense of death, grey skies, and lots of dirt. well, actually, bad example. imagine the 40's in black and white with a few lamps...there's your motivation. in this world, you have a legion of humans, also known as mutants, and therein lies your fear. what once was, has now become.

the mutations keep coming, as the women still kick out a few gems once in awhile. the result of henry's, is the equivalent to your worst nightmare. imagery being a surrealistic, morphed, venomous semen being, coming from henry and only he. with the offspring now about, henry is forced into a marriage, the two cannot cope with. its not even that rudimentary, its far warped. in a sense, were to believe its an actual relationship, a bond, but in the most primitive way, its just two characters under one roof with this...child? the child becomes prone to henry, who remains a captive under the highly claustrophobic room.

with everything entirely dark, morbid, and revolting, the child grows sick. almost in a sick dementia, the feelings henry inherits, of both fear, disgust, insanity, lust, and intimidation, or rather insecurity, become the physical form of this seclusive, disturbing child. were prone to flashbacks, or hallucinations, of things henry thinks about. all in the same room, we experience the madness in a way text, screenplays, or even words cannot describe. if the term surreal means anything, well, square it and then round...you'll get the picture.

in the end, im not really sure what 'eraserhead' was meant to mean, to be. perhaps its a thought process, an examination on life. why is there birth? to procreate? a reason so simplistic and necessary? perhaps its the offspring that reveal the inner sanctitude in all of us. or maybe, its just a movie thats too underlying in tones, both rich and bland. you can take a road and look at it two different ways, its the same with this film. i, for one, found it to be extraordinary, and im glad someone took something so stellar, and made it into not even something, just...well, 'eraserhead.' you cant describe something that's really nothing...it's a catch-22, and in the end, nobody will ever get it.

1272528,5,B00003CWPL,"In 1977, a director named David Lynch was making a name for himself with the greatly disturbing and sureal masterpiece Eraserhead. The disturbing images and creepy worlds Lynch creates are like nothing else in film.
The film is about Henry Spencer, played by Jack Nance (R.I.P.). Henry is a lonely man who lives in an industrial nightmare. He lives in an apartment with flickering lights and drawers filled with bowls of water. Henry has to visit his girlfriend Mary's parents house. He agrees.
After getting to know Mary's strange family, he discovers that Mary is pregnant with his child. However, when the baby is born, it doesn't look like a baby. It's a mutant. Still, Henry and Mary decide to take care of the baby, until Mary decides to leave when she can't stand the baby anymore. Henry is left with the disformed child, who eventually grows sick. After this, Heny's whole life becomes a living hell.
Lynch's strange debut is one of the weirdest and most obscure films to be released. It's black and white grainy look gives the film it's disturbing feel. The more the film goes on, the more it grows on you. You just want to continue watching. However, this is not a film for everyone. This images of the mutant baby could be one of the greatest nightmares for first time parents, and the film's message of ""In Heaven everything is fine"" could be a drop for deeply depressed film fans.
In conclusion, Eraserhead is a classic Sci-Fi/Horror masterpiece. it gives a look into someone's nightmare and a life turning into complete insanity. Not for the weak, David Lynch's great debut is a must see for fans of obscure and strange films. Hard to find, but worth the money. SEE IT!",1089763200,8,1683,4.6891891891891895

This film however really is surreal and while I don't want to give anything away ( how can I? If I were to describe this you'd probably think I was a bit cuckoo ), it is brilliantly acted. I remember watching this the first time in a friend's house. I brought it over since I really wanted to see it and not some horrible Hollywood movie and all I can say is that when the film was finished and I went to the toilet, I looked at myself in the mirror and I was as white as a ghost. There was not one bit of colour in me. That's how bizarre and scary this film is.
However ( on a side note ) if you're looking for a similar film I would suggest getting Un Chien Andalou. Made in 1928 but equally as baffling and surreal.

1272625,5,B00003CWPL,"Eraserhead poses many questions for viewers but allows few answers. The setting reminds me of something out of a Charles Dickens novel/only darker. Perhaps one could say this is work somewhat like Dickens but with 21st century themes.
  Some have viewed it as social commentary which may include: alienation of modern man in a dwindling post production economy or maybe the power man has over life and death through abortion. These are issues almost any young man/woman faces in the modern era. My favorite scene is the dance number where a young woman continues her routine despite a rather grotesque physical occurence. And of course there is the baby --that wondeful shrieking child. (I don't want to ruin this for anyone so I will say no more).

This film seems to invoke feelings of isolation, depression, and sheer wierdness within the viewer (at least me as a viewer). It is truly a nightmare (imagine, as you watch, that this was a dream you had last night and that you have just awakened from that dream). I think that David Lynch did a great job with the imagery, sounds, etc... If hell has a waiting room, the land of ERASERHEAD is it. It's where things just are the way they are and there really isn't any escape. The characters in the movie are set fixtures who will never be anything more than they are. It is a world darker than most people's reality. I hope that soon this film will make it to the DVD market because it is truly a great film, although, not for all (and I can understand that).

1272627,5,B00003CWPL,"If you're reading this, then you've seen this movie or are at least curious what all the hype is about?

The late Stanley Kubrick, the only major filmmaker Lynch has cited as a direct cinematic influence, believed that ERASERHEAD was one of the most perfect ""cinematic experiences"" created to date.  This movie has enjoyed success on the midnight movie circuit for years, particularly in NYC where it ran almost every night for something like five years straight. I've seen it on big and little screens in three different states.  Insofar as interpretations are concerned, I've long since tossed all that out the window.  In terms of rational comprehension, ERASERHEAD is the fabled big fish that remains brilliantly elusive of any attempts to capture it.

This movie gets better, and more humorous, every time I watch it: in my opinion - ERASERHEAD is the cinematic experience that comes the closest to capturing ""dream logic"", next to the equally brilliant WAKING LIFE.  If you ever get the chance, watch ERASERHEAD in a movie theater with a great sound system - you will understand why Stanley Kubrick was moved enough to make his statement.  It's like experiencing someone else's dream - the ultimate act of voyeurism?  As if I was granted audience to a demonstration of delicate brain surgery, and catching glimpses of the patient's face throughout the operation (particularly the opening scene).  It creates such a visceral landscape with its dark, peculiar selections of image and sound, that it seems to be constantly reminding you that the ""soul"" is helplessly sloshing around somewhere inside an organic bag of blood, bone, hair follicles, industrial shrapnel, dirt piles and antique radiators; a terrifying and beautiful delineation of a living creature suddenly made aware of its own being (birth imagery abounding).  It is a perfect symphony of sound and image, amazing work for a first time feature film director!  I've seen this movie placed in the HORROR section at local video stores; it's better suited for the COMEDY section, I fear.  The movie was created on the AFI campus in California; production beginning his last year there, and continuing on for several more years in secret.  Not for everyone, but certainly worth a peek.

I own a copy of ERASERHEAD on DVD, finally.  Remastered sound and image, includes a few extras - the standout is a ""stylized"" interview with Lynch about the making of the film, the characters involved and anecdotes.",1070323200,255,2466,5.039408866995074
1272628,5,B00003CWPL,"Many viewers of Eraserhead have exhausted all avenues of erudition to decipher the complex pandoras box of Lynch's debut film.  I too, belonged to this cogitative elite.  Many have tried to implicate the intimation of theosophical reference or cosmological theory or refutation of deities as the main focus of the picture.  However, it occured to me sometime ago that Eraserhead is not that complicated.  Not as much as Lost Highway or Mulholland Drive , but certainly there is a trick to it all.  If you know even the most trivial of facts regarding Mr. Lynch, you probably are aware that he despises Philadelphia.  Viewing the film with this in mind, I became somewhat enlightened of the situation that Lynch was in.  In the duration of the five years in which Eraserhead was made, Lynch was living in a penurious and violent area of Philadelphia.  He was also facing the arrival of his progeny-his daughter (born with clubbed feet).  It began to arise in my consciousness, that Henry is thrown into the forlorn world of Eraserhead by a malefic preternatural pater familias (a malevolent God).  This being continually interjects elements into Henry's life to prolong his suffering.  As Henry peers into the demarcating radiator, the only source of warmth in the film, death (in the form of the Lady in the Radiator) tries to convince Henry to commit suicide.
Now I myself cannot certifiably verify nor defend my interpretation, but I personally see Eraserhead as a kind of amphigory about man's inherent possibilities and the precarious stimuli that always seems to threaten the realization of his fullest abilities.  When I attempt to discern any of the lumbering theories about the film's implications, I can only really say that the movie's meaning will depend upon you the viewer.
But meaning is hardly the point of Eraserhead and I would be an arrant fool to attempt to describe its power to you.  All I can tell you is that I have contemplated all the permutations of ""meaning"" regarding the film and I have settled reasonably on my own conclusions (of which I shall not divulge here, as that would be doing those who have not witnessed it a gross iniquity).  I shall merely state that the paucity of individuals who identify with Henry Spencer's predicament and know the tenebrous industrial atmosphere of Eraserhead like the back of their hand all feel the same reverence towards the film.  And I speak personally (once again) by stating that it is the only film I've ever viewed in my entire life that I identified (inexplicably) with.",1067904000,5,2546,4.888372093023256
1272629,2,B00003CWPL,"David Lynch is odd. Odd and he's very talented. Eraserhead is a jumbled mess of mixed visual metaphors and adolescent tripe. Poor Jack Nance. Jack could be the sweetest guy in the world. He was (briefly) my apartment manager during the making of Lynch's Dune. He appears as lost in Lynch's film as Lynch clearly is himself.
Is it art? Sure. Is it good art? It teeters on the fine line between dorky and cool. I can't say I recommend Eraserhead. There are moments that recall the absurdity of Dali (when he was still an important painter). Visually stunning but ultimately as vapid and empty as any amateur art project.
For those folks that are interested (Lyncheads all I'd guess), Eraserhead is available at David's website. It's somewhat expensive but the print looks great although the narrative is as murky as ever. Lynch is a very talented director when working with the right screenplay.

This movie is like spinning wildly in the middle of 125th street in NYC--you feel lost, sick, out of balance and there is nothing real, nothing natural around you, so that you cannot but wonder if your own thoughts are real or natural.  This film goes well with Coppola's Koyanisqaatsi.  Oh, one last thing:  Believe it or not, the most bizarre scenes are those that Lynch edited out, including one where Henry opens a drawer in his bureau and finds only a mound of mashed potatoes with peas in it.  who hasn't that happened to?",1060560000,3,759,4.712121212121212

Judging by the slick, masturbatory, desperate attempt to keep up with the hip, artsy film scenesters that was Mullholland Drive, I guess that comes as no surprise.

Well, it's not for everyone. Only for the intellectual person who loves horror that not only scares you, disturbes you, and makes you laugh, but also one that makes you think. An open-ended metaphor with the tone of a nightmare, David Lynch's debut feature combines disturbing visuals with what may be an even more disturbing sound design to create an unforgettable film that's affecting on a visceral level. A Cronenberg-ian discomfort with the simple fact of physical existence courses through Eraserhead, beginning with, but not limited to, matters of sexuality and reproduction. In an early scene, Lynch turns even a family dinner into a horrific affair, emphasizing the inherent grotesqueness of the mere act of eating. The later introduction of a deformed, extremely vocal child seems not the least bit out of place in a world in which even the most mundane aspect (a radiator not the least among them) is notable for its ability to disturb. While Lynch would rarely return to the outright fantasy worlds he explores here, Eraserhead nonetheless sets up the obsessions that would follow him through his career, particularly the ability of the seemingly ordinary to unsettle upon closer observation. Fans of this should check out Jacob's Ladder, and fans of Jacob's Ladder should take it a step up and see this oddball. I love it, because it is so weird.

The first time I saw this movie was in the summer of 2002. I had maxed my cable modem gigs for that month, then when I found it on DivX to download for the first time, I'd wait weeks just to have that download finish (the highest that it was downloading: 1.5 kbps, when it WAS downloading). One week later--the hottest day of that year--the download finally completed. The transfer? Oh my God...""transfer"". [Laughs] That's a good one. I sat there for an hour and a half, and I probably had seen half of the movie...basically because the picture was MUDDY (and completely black in some scenes), AT BEST! Irremovable French subtitles took up half the screen, the audio lagged behind every now and then, and to say the least, the sound was under pillows with scratches, hiss, crackle, and pop...all enough to even have those rice crispies guys in full blush. Nonetheless to say, I was half-satisfied...but after seeing the film for the first time, who, in the right state of mind, WOULD be fully satisfied with THAT?!
Then after a few days of mind-numbing research, I found it on DVD in the ONLY place available within a reasonable price (I'm sure you've seen some ridiculous prices people charge for VHS copies on eBay). Of course I needed a credit card to purchase it, which I didn't have. But FINALLY I got one, and after my purchase about a month ago off of davidlynch.com, I am EXTREMELY satisfied (mind you, I live in Canada, so paying in USD on my VISA didn't look too pretty to say the least)!
And the DVD? Well, the main menu for the film has a really unsettling scene for a background, in which Henry is tugging at the leash of a dead cat (or a dog?) on the ground with his foot...with no facial expression to mark the meaning. The theatrical trailer (being my favorite DVD feature out of any) is creepy at best, sending a chill of curiousity through your body. And finally, a very informative brand new hour-and-a-half special featurette called, ""Stories"", in which David Lynch talks about everything that has to do with ""Eraserhead"", answering any of those questions that might have plagued fans about the film (sorry, he still doesn't say ANYTHING about the creation of Henry's child). And as for the film's treansfer itself...well, for such a rich price of $.. USD (not including shipping), I'll only say this: I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW MUCH OF THE MOVIE I MISSED...and besides, with the original 1.85:1 transfer FULLY supervised by the master himself, how could you go wrong?!

Many other Lynch films deal with the idea of ordinary people put into extraordinary circumstances, but in ""Eraserhead"" it is the overriding concept of the entire movie, and one that Lynch has teased to its grisly, beautiful perfection.
Set in a retro-future reminiscent of Lang's ""Metropolis"" or the worst parts of the Victorian era mingled with a post-nuclear environment, ""Eraserhead"" follows the perpetually-frizzy-haired Henry Spencer as he learns that his girlfriend is pregnant and is forced to marry her at her parent's request (at a dinner where the roast chickens splay themselves suggestively on the dinner table, no less).  Henry wears a look of almost constant bewilderment at having been put in this position, but it is nothing compared with the outlandishness of the rest of the movie.  Henry's apartment building appears to be abandoned, and the lights flicker on and off uncontrollably, while the woman across the hall gives him phone messages from a payphone, and the woman who lives in his radiator tells him (in song) that ""In heaven, everything is fine.""  When Henry and Mary pick the baby up from the hospital, he discovers that, whatever it IS, it most certainly is NOT human.
Lynch has always concerned himself with bipolar contrasts, and ""Eraserhead"" is no exception.  While Henry pines for Heaven, it is unclear whether he is living in Hell, or simply a world gone horribly wrong.  For all the repeated imagery of copulation, reproduction, and birth, coupled with violence, it could be either, although it is clear that everything that happens is within the realm of possibility, making the latter more probable.  The film is interspersed with postmodern artistic scenes evoking violence, life, and death, and there is little conventional ""plot"" to speak of - simply Henry reacting to the increasingly absurd, which he never gets used to nor ever fully accepts.
So what is Lynch trying to do or say?  I have my suspicions, but to talk about ""meaning"" before the experience would ruin the whole thing.  Let's put it this way: just as Henry sits there slack-jawed and glassy-eyed at what's going on around him, so too is the audience supposed to do the same - it may be one of the best tricks any artist has ever played on his viewers.
All in all, ""Eraserhead"" will not be to everyone's tastes.  In fact, I doubt it would even appeal to those who liked other Lynch movies such as ""Mulholland Drive"" or ""Blue Velvet.""  It is much more an art film, but you're the kind of person who goes to movies to escape, you might want to pass on ""Eraserhead.""  If you like to think, especially on the existential level, see what you can make of it.

1272768,5,B00003CWPL,"To all of my friends who say that LOST HIGHWAY AND MULHOLLAND DRIVE are so weird, I have one thing to say to you. ""Watch ERASERHEAD."" Lynch's first masterpiece that introduced him (gradually) to the world is a stunningly bizarre work of art, not cinema, but art, that makes BLUE VELVET look like a mainstream summer blockbuster by comparison.
Lynch regular Jack Nance plays Henry, a mild mannered young man who lives quietly in a bleak future universe filled with dirty old buildings and industrial machines that seem to run all hours of the day. One day Henry's world is turned upside down when he learns that his girlfriend became pregnant and had his ""baby."" The baby, it appears, is a mutant whose disfigurement was caused by the horribly polluted world in which they inhabit. The baby is sick, the wife leaves him, and Henry is forced to make a choice that could burden his conscience for the rest of his life.
Shot in beautiful black and white, Lynch creates a nightmare world in which machines are always heard rumbling away, characters are quirky, and the only escape Henry has is his own imagination. Lynch uses shocking and bizarre images to blend dreams with reality(which will become his trademark) It is the study of one lonely and depressed soul trapped in a nightmare universe where nobody cares. It is ERASERHEAD, if not David Lynch's best film, then it is certainly his most original. Watch it once, and it will haunt you for a long time to come. Watch it twice, and it will haunt you forever.
On the question of availibility, ERASERHEAD is not a film that you can find in your neighborhood Blockbuster. It's on moritorium and is very hard to find. But like Quentin Tarantino once said, the lack of availability often adds to a cult status. The best way to get your hands on a copy of ERASERHEAD, is to do it like I did, bid for it on EBAY. It might run for a little more than an average video. But I guarantee, you will not regret spending the extra money.",1029369600,18,1974,4.563380281690141

I have yet to find another motion picture that captures this element so eloquently.  It's as if this man got inside of Dali's head and made a motion picture out of his grey matter.

Somehow, if you approach watching this film in the right way, with the right kind of open mind, it will open a door inside you which leads to a place which is impossible to describe - but a place of intense emotion.
This is not a film in which one should look for character development, dialogue and narrative. Throw any expectations along these lines out the window. What's more, if you consider these to be a 'must' as part of your viewing experience, don't even think of trying to watch a film like this.
It is to be experienced rather in the same way that you would experience a painting on canvas or a piece of music. In my opinion, Eraserhead shows just how deeply you can be affected by the medium of film.
The feeling is pervasively dark and introverted.. here we see for the first time Lynch's trademark fascination for the nooks and crevices in ordinary suburban environments. We also see his now (in)famously ambiguous use of symbolism.
Compared to his later films, this one seems far more abstract (a sparser plot and limited 'action') and yet somehow the message conveyed by symbols such as the mutant baby, the 'worms', the 'Lady in the Radiator' and 'the Man in the Planet' is more straightforward and easier to get to grips with than his more recent efforts in a similar vein (Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive).
Themes of isolation, sexuality, and the dehumanisation of industry are all there, but exactly how you fit them together to form the jigsaw of Henry's (the lead character) painful subective experience is largely left up to you. And in my opinion if you concentrate on trying to 'interpret' the film, or to 'understand' it, you will miss 99% of its visceral power.
One could suggest that what Eraserhead is trying to do is to allow you to look nearly directly at your own (sub/un)conscious mind..
And nearly 20 years after first seeing Eraserhead, I now own it on VHS and DVD (region 2) and it is just as incredible to watch the fifth or sixth time as the first. A particularly noteworthy feature of owning the DVD is the clarity of the sound, which is an integral part of the overall experience.",1021680000,2,2270,4.5390243902439025
1272773,5,B00003CWPL,"...I first heard about Eraserhead from a film teacher friend of mine who always provoked heated class discussions with it. I didn't know what he was talking about until I saw it for myself.  Eraserhead is hard and at times confusing to sit through, but its basic plot line is simple:  boy and girl have to get married because of an unexpected pregnancy.  Girl, frustrated with parenthood, goes back home, leaving her husband to care for the child, which was born prematurely. Husband also becomes frustrated because he fantasizes that he would have a much better chance at his sexy neighbor across the hall if he didn't have a child whose hideousness, he believes, reflects on him.  A major portion of the ""action"" is a mock-romantic dream he has about the woman and himself.  The film is filled with gritty and shocking images of Henry's banal daily life.  Some scenes are screamingly funny, especially where the prospective husband must first run the gamut of meeting the future bride's family:  it's a ""meet-the-family"" nightmare with a zombie grandma and the tastiest little chickens you'll ever contemplate for dinner.  Other scenes depict Henry's pathetic desire to escape to some fantasy paradise hidden in the radiator.  The final scenes are guaranteed to have you white-knuckled, though not for the usual reasons.  Soundtrack? Something like chalk scraping a blackboard.  It's as though Lynch did everything to challenge his audience not to sit through the film, but this is a must-see for anyone interested in creative, daring use of the medium.

It's certainly not enjoyable to watch, or entertaining by any stretch of the imagination, but it is compelling, engrossing, and disturbing. A true film ""experience."" There's never been anything like it from anyone else, or Lynch himself for that matter, and more likely than not we'll never see anything like it again. At it's most simplistic it's Lynch's fears and horror concerning ""family"" and ""industrialism"" taken to the nth degree. Most people describe it as post-apocolyptic, but it's truly modern/contemporary, just dark and unfamiliar to most. But again, like with many of Lynch's films--especially the recent MULHOLLAND DRIVE--you'd have to be David Lynch to fully understand everything that takes place or is shown, and that's what makes his movies so intriguing.

1272840,5,B00003CWPL,"Eraserhead, David Lynch`s groundbreaking feature, is for many reasons considered a cult-classic. Both the story and style of the film share the traits which have made director Lynch a spokesman for the alternative and surreal in modern cinema.
The story surrounds around Henry(Jack Nance), and his immediate environment. Henry becomes romantically involved with a woman, and later finds himself facing the troubles of fatherhood. This storyline seems fairly ordinary and straight fotward. But anyone who has seen the film will agree that ""ordinary"" is a word not suited to describe the universe created by Lynch in Eraserhead.
Events take place which have no grasp in our ""ordinary"" world.
The very first minutes of the film show us what we can come to expect throughout the feature; a moonlike landscape is presented to us and shows us the residence of a man(?), whom by pulling a metall stick(controll-bar?) initiates a certain action. This character seems to be the instigator of the action which is to take place.
Similar events of the surreal take place and mix with the more ""wordly"" aspects of the film throughout the feature.
But trying to analyze and disect Eraserhead is in many ways a mission impossible. The film is more a mood than anything else, and a moode must be experienced rather than debated. There are in my view no words which adequitely can be used to describe the very mood which is Eraserhead.

David Lynch himself said that he didn't so much think of Eraserhead, than feel it. Never have I  heard a more true statement. 'Eraserhead' is Atmosphere with a capital A,  and contains some truly unnerving moments that come straight out of our  darkest nightmares. David Lynch is a true artist. To watch Eraserhead is to  be totally absorbed into another world; Henry and his bizarre hairdo; the  gentle yet strangely disturbing Lady in the Radiator; and last but not  least, the hideous 'Baby,' a truly grotesque little monster who is more  terrifying than any other man-made creature in motion picture history.  (Lynch has refused to say how he created the Baby....IF he made it, that  is. CREEEEEEEEEEEEPYYYYY! ) There is an unrelenting sense of menace and  fear throughout all the proceedings. Some may huff and dismiss 'Eraserhead'  as an 'artsy-fartsy' flick intended for the smallest film cults.  'Eraserhead' is not cult; it's timeless.  If only Lynch would create  another film of this magnitude and purity. Maybe he still will. I look  forward to the re-release of this ignored classic with great anticipation.",955670400,93,1246,5.03921568627451

And Lynch never did a thing like that ( sic!). Watch it! watch  it watch it! If you love art and great cinema!",955584000,,270,3.736842105263158
1272884,5,B00003CWPL,"I'm waiting for this film to be release on DVD! In hopes of more deleted scenes, Out-takes and directors comments! I can dream can't I?  Or should I ask for what may be another Lynching of my peace of mind?  It's dark, It's  gloomy, and foreboding!  The film  got such a cold chilling edge on it.  You have to focus on every frozen moment and capture the essence of feeling  of every moment that you view scenes from Eraserhead.  Cold as Ice and dead  on with fear and loathing of the pain of living and dealing with things we  cannot control yet still force our lives into.  We can't paint it any  other way better than David Lynch.  There isn't a better work out by this  extra ordinary director.  You will have to either tie the viewer to the  chair to watch this or threaten them off your x-mas list from watching it  every month.  I fully recommend this film for the open minded and thought  pro-vocable public.  It will make you thankful your neurosis aren't as  obvious.",953683200,11,977,4.376404494382022

I defy anyone to categorize or summarize the plot. I tried with my husband, and he looked at me like I had 4 heads. Must see film, at least once in your life. You will never forget it.",1526083200,,328,4.483333333333333

7917476,5,B00003CWPL,I ordered this most likely Full Screen Korean Laser Disc Transfer for like 4 dollars. Cause simply David Lynch filmed this in 16 mm. And I believe the original version is full screen 4:3. Since 2000 David Lynch has released a beautiful version of it which went to Criterion. But the one issue with it is he made it in Anamorphic format which the top and bottom are cropped. I have a very old copy from a VHS tape that is just so grainy. I rather buy this and see how it looks. From the reviews here. Mostly 5 stars. If it's from a Korean Laser disc in Full Screen we are in luck. Most likely it won't be from a old video tape. I originally bought the 2000 version in the BIG box. Anyone remember those first DVD releases. But in a nut shell this version is the real way it should be viewed. I don't like watching movies I love when they are inappropriately cropped. It drives me nuts. Especially some of the Stanley Kubrick one's that were cropped. But now I can see those one's are restored back to full screen. Depends on the movie. Sometimes I don't care either way as long as I see it. But with this film ............. Full Screen absolutely.,1518393600,,1146,4.261467889908257
