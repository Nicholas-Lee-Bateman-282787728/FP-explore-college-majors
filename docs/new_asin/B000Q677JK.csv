2831601,5,B000Q677JK,"Got this for my wife as she wanted to exercise without always having to leave the house. She loves it and does it about every other day. Great for beginners in yoga or experts as the instructor always gives three options for each exercise for beginners, intermediate, or expert. Also doesn't have really annoyingly voiced instructors like a lot of videos yelling at you or saying really stupid phrases like ""no pain no gain"" or ""come on fatty you can do it!"". Any age can pick this up and enjoy a good workout.",1258502400,,510,4.494623655913978

8194399,5,B000Q677JK,"I'm a trail runner, and have scoliosis, and my hips (one more than the other), get very tight, as do my low back, my calves, and my feet. The Yoga workout in this collection makes a HUGE difference in my running. This DVD (and I'm specifically referring to the yoga disc in the collection) has some relaxation elements, but is more about building strength and flexibility. I always feel looser and more relaxed, and if I do it a few times a week, I have a lot less discomfort in my lower body when I run. There is a bit of core and upper body work as well, (I think of the shoulders, specifically), but I'd say the biggest benefit is to the hips. The video does start a little slowly, with five minutes or so of meditative breathing warm-up, which I sometimes skip if I'm pressed for time.",1352160000,,789,4.302013422818792

8194401,5,B000Q677JK,"The pilates and yoga are both wonderful. It has very good instructions that are easy to understand and follow. It is not so difficult that you can't start out doing it from the first day, however still will make you sore the next day. I have not used the third DVD yet, still working up to it.  Would recommend to anyone interested in starting yoga/pilates.",1282435200,,357,4.492307692307692

8194403,5,B000Q677JK,"Got this pilates/yoga video set at Costco last year. The beginning yoga and pilates workouts are exactly that - for beginners of all levels. Modifications are offered on three levels. The narrator has a calming voice making you believe that you are doing everything correct and gently keeps you on track with reminders sprinkled through out. There is a great section of the videos that goes over fundamentals which is perfect for the novice or for the more experienced who need to be reminded of the fundamentals.

I have tried many other beginning videos and find that the instructors are completely out of the reality of a beginner. They seem to be doing what is a simple excercise for them but it far surpasses what a true beginner is able to safely do. The Maya videos instructors/performers are obvious in shape and advanced but they truly do a basic work out to show the importance of fundamentals. No one is just showing off on these videos. It's all about doing it correctly and safely.

A friend of mine who is in her late 50's recently went through chemotherapy and and needed a low intensity work out she could handle while on chemo. I gave her the beginning yoga video and she swears by it. She searched around on line and bought one of her own.

I only wish Maya would produce more videos, I would love to have more choices. This video set is a true gem and well worth the money.",1268524800,6,1392,4.515873015873016
