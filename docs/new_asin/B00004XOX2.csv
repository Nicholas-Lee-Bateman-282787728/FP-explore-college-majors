1367543,3,B00004XOX2,"Unless you're already familiar with a variety of yoga postures and their correct form (not to mention really flexible and fast on your toes), I'd recommend going with another DVD.
Though the production is beautiful, Yee's rapid-fire commands to adopt one posture after another will frustrate anyone just starting out. Imagine someone instructing, ""Downward dog, lion pose, inhale, exhale, up to forward bend, inhale, back to downward dog, exhale..."" for 30 minutes, and you get a good idea of what this DVD offers.
If the DVD had included some kind of instruction on the poses and their proper form, I'd forgive the rest. Without this, however, the result is an intermediate workout more like yoga-flavored calisthenics and less like something slow, easy, relaxing and doable for beginners.",989884800,17,790,5.228346456692913
1367544,5,B00004XOX2,"I had a baby a year ago and although I've already lost all of my baby weight (and then some) I still need a little toning. I purchased this DVD based on reviews that I read all over the Internet. MAN! Rodney kicked my butt! I never really considered myself COMPLETELY out of shape, but Rodney proved me wrong. I worked parts of my body that I didn't know existed. He's great for beginners like myself - although I had a tough time following along and trying to watch him at the same time. Once I got the basic moves, it got easier. For those of you considering yoga as a means of working out, try this one over all others. Rodney is a great instructor and he doesn't go to fast where you can't keep up. And if you're one of those people that think yoga doesn't make you sweat - THINK AGAIN! Yoga is great for relaxation, meditation and the most restful sleep ever (if you choose to do it before bed.) I highly suggest taking a peek at this workout. It's worth it!",989798400,52,963,4.182795698924731
1367545,5,B00004XOX2,"This is my first exposure to yoga. I found it very easy to follow and much more enjoyable than the usual treadmilling and floor excercises. You have to watch him closely the first time or two to figure out all the positions, but it was much easier than I anticipated. His voice is very soothing and I am completely relaxed at the end of each workout. I think it's a great introduction to yoga and recommend it highly!",988934400,,417,4.358974358974359
1367546,5,B00004XOX2,After using power yoga for beginners not only did my body feel better but my mind was more focused. You learn to relax your body and let the tensions of everyday life flow out while you relax your mind and let the peacefulness of spirit flow in. You will not only see changes in your posture and flexibility but also in your spirit.,970099200,45,332,4.285714285714286
1367547,5,B00004XOX2,"I have been doing yoga at home for about 13 years, starting with MTV yoga. I have recently enjoyed shorter practices that can be added on to a 20 minute Cardio/ weight workout.  This dvd, while a bit older in production value is amazing!  First off, the sceneries and music are beautiful.  The instruction is a bit fast, but once you get into the practice, easy enough to follow.  I also like that the practices offer up a bit of a challenge. It's rare to see crow pose included in a short program.  If you are used to Rodney's newer releases, this may seem a bit more advanced. Personally, I am so glad to have purchased this dvd rather than another newer release.  If you are looking for solid, short programs, I recommend this DVD along with the ""Yoga for Beginners Abs, lower and upper body"" dvd and the ""AM, PM, Stress Relief"" dvd. All offer great, 20-28 minute practices and can be found used for as little as .50 cents each!",1376697600,,931,4.383720930232558
1367548,5,B00004XOX2,"These are all-around great workouts that are accessible to yoga novices.  At 20 minutes, they provide energizing workouts for busy people.",1375315200,,138,5.571428571428571
1367549,5,B00004XOX2,"I really like Rodney Yee, he is easy to follow and listen to.  I always feel better, more energized and ready for the day after my sessions with Rodney Yee",1358985600,,155,4.166666666666667
1367550,5,B00004XOX2,I really love this particular series by Rodney.  I only had the vhs so I am very happy with my purchase.,1356220800,,104,3.9523809523809526
1367551,4,B00004XOX2,"I love Rodney Yee yoga videos.  The scenery is great.  His voice is soothing.  He doesn't talk too much.  The music is good.  The only thing that surprised me is that when I first bought this yoga routine years ago on VHS, I found it strenuous.  Now, after doing so much yoga, this routine seemed easy to me.  I still like this DVD because it's Rodney.  But, I won't do this video when I want a vigorous yoga workout.  I'll do this one for a light yoga routine.",1348531200,,461,4.1477272727272725
1367552,5,B00004XOX2,This video is just the right pace and I like fact that its only 25 minutes a session if you are on a time crunch.,1335139200,,113,3.56
1367553,5,B00004XOX2,"I love this DVD because it provides 3 relatively quick (20-25 minutes each) workouts that address different needs:  strength, flexibility, and stamina.  I take it with me during business trips and play it on my laptop for a quick workout in my hotel room.  It gives me variety to choose whatever I'm in the mood for each day, and the workouts are short enough to allow me to get them done even if I tend to hit the snooze button a few too many times before getting out of bed.

One caveat - this workout moves pretty quickly without much in the way of instruction or tips about positioning.  It is better for someone familiar with the basics.",1334361600,,642,4.406779661016949
1367554,5,B00004XOX2,"I love Rodney Yee.  I have had this DVD for years.  It is one of my favorites because it is vigorous and challenging.  You will sweat and fatigue your muscles.  It is a great workout.  My boyfriend, who is very built and has always been an althete, tried the Stamina workout the other day as his first exposure to yoga.  He was tired at the end.  Highly recommended.  However, this really is not the best video if you are a beginner.  You might start with the AM/PM yoga for beginners video to get comfortable with the poses.",1216684800,,525,4.329896907216495
1367555,4,B00004XOX2,"My friend and I have decided to have a weekly yoga session at my apartment. The Power Yoga for Beginners was my first exposure to yoga, ever, and I wouldn't recommend it for true beginners that have never done yoga.

Yee moves too quickly between poses, using only the technical names that mean absolutely nothing to a true beginner. Since you don't know the terms yet (downward dog, hero pose, etc), you are required to keep your eyes on the screen to follow what is going on. However, a very limited number of poses allows you the luxury of actually keeping your eyes on the screen. I was lucky to workout with my friend, who has experience with these tapes, so I could follow in her footsteps. As a beginner watching a beginner's tape, I was expecting clear explanations about each pose, but there was absolutely none of that.

My suggestion for true beginners is to go with something else and make this series a second, or maybe third step in your yoga progression. I would personally file this series at an intermediate level.

My only other complaint may be based on the fact that these are my friend's old VHS tapes, not DVDs -- but, the video appears a bit grainy and has a low resolution, like they filmed it with a store-bought handicam. I'm not sure if the quality is as bad with the DVD, which I plan to buy in the future. Just something to consider before purchasing...

But after saying all that... I seriously LOVE this series!

It's challenging, it get's my heart racing and the sweat dripping, giving me a real workout that I have not since experienced with my other yoga tapes. The poses never stop flowing, you don't get a moment to rest before moving on to the next challenging pose. It's a relentless stream of movement.

Yee is not a cheesy instructor prone to banal conversation and platitudes. He is direct to the point and enjoyable to watch. The music is perfectly unremarkable, which is how I prefer it. And the ocean background is better than the usual gym (but not as good as some of my other Gaiam videos). So far, this is my favorite yoga series and I expect to use it often in the future.",1137024000,3,2120,4.479274611398964
1367556,5,B00004XOX2,"After badly injuring one of my shoulders doing the bench press, I had to find a safer alternative to weightlifting. So I decided to look into yoga.  Rodney Yee was about the only guy who caught my interest. I have a number of his tapes, but this dvd is the main one I've used over the years. The workouts are challenging and will make you sweat. Some of the poses in the strength section are particularly difficult, but I was able to eventually do them all with practice. Of course, you prolly won't look as good as Rodney Yee doing the poses, but if you're able to get your feet up off the ground that's the main thing in my book! I've always enjoyed the strength section the most as it focuses on arm strength and is quick to the point. All in all, I really have enjoyed the DVD and Yee's workout is definitely a nice alternative to lifting weights for hours on end and chugging protein shakes. And if nothing else girls love a guy that does yoga. ;)",1119744000,5,952,4.259668508287293
1367557,4,B00004XOX2,"First, just a word to A.Vegan. If you have been performing yoga for a while, why would you choose this DVD? It does say for beginners, so it doesn't surprise me that it wasn't challenging enough for you. Maybe you should try something with ""Power Yoga for Intermediate or Advanced Students"" instead? That being said, this is pretty tough for the beginner. Not really in a fatigue sort of way, more the flexibility and the familiarity with the routine. At first, you are constantly looking at the video at the same time as doing the moves, and like people have said, it isn't quite in sync all the time. After a few times through, however, you can follow the voice alone and just look up now and then to double-check.  I have become addicted to Yoga through this DVD and my flexibility has improved as well as my sense of balance. I think this is a worthwhile DVD to purchase, along with other DVDs that complement it.

Mike",1106524800,4,923,4.488095238095238
1367558,2,B00004XOX2,What a terrible yoga workout.  The person narrating the video was inconsistent with the poses.  There really wasn't a challenge to this at all.  It was a nice idea that you can choose to do three shorter workouts or one long one.  I've been doing yoga for quite a while and this isn't a video I'd recommend to anyone.,1075248000,,317,4.322033898305085
1367559,5,B00004XOX2,"This DVD is broken up into 3 workouts, stamina, strength, and flexibility.  The majority of the poses are beginner level (especially the stamina workout),each workout ranges from 20-30 minutes long.  For a total workout do all 3 consecutively.  I have been practicing yoga for 2+ years at least 5-6 days a week, and this DVD still gets plenty of usage. I think this DVD is challenging enough for intermediate level yoga students (check out some of the arm balances Yee demonstrates in the strength workout) yet easy enough for a beginner to try.  However, Yee's workout is not for the faint of heart, the pace is fast (especially the second and third workouts), and you will sweat.  Also, watch the DVD before you follow along with the routines, because they are fairly fast paced.  So, if you want a good sweat, definitely give this DVD a try.",1056931200,7,844,4.707482993197279
1367560,5,B00004XOX2,"This is an excellent video for someone with minimal knowledge of yoga and a good baseline flexibility. Rodney Yee's soothing, calm voice and flawless, succinct voice-over make this DVD worth every penny and ounce of your time. The locales of each segment take me away from my cluttered family room!! If I'm limited on time, I just do the flexibility portion, as each segment can stand alone or be done together as a very good workout.  I sweat through each one, but feel energized after I do it.",1045180800,4,495,4.625
1367561,5,B00004XOX2,"I have most of the Living Arts yoga workouts on vhs and dvd.  I find this to be one of the very best Rodney Yee workouts available.  I have tried a lot of other kinds of yoga workouts, yoga fusion, yoga booty ballet.  They are good workouts in their own way, but for some reason, power yoga makes me feel like I am really cleansing my body and mind.  Doing all three (power, strength, flexibility) workouts at once is a great way to burn off fat and sweat out toxins.  The strength part of the dvd has really helped me to gain upper body strength, which I have been trying to do for years.  It really makes me feel long and lean.  My boyfriend even commented on how I looked taller one evening when he came home from work.  I had just rolled up my mat when he came in the door.  This video rocks!  I wouldn't recommend it to an absolute beginner or anyone who doesn't want to MOVE their body. If you want a good workout that really gets you going, try Power Yoga.",1043798400,11,963,4.129032258064516
1367562,5,B00004XOX2,"Not for first-timers! The program goes fast- so fast it could almost be an audio tape, as you have to rely on a firm knowledge of poses and be able to listen for cues rather than watching and following along. That said, it is the best yoga dvd I have seen yet- a good workout with all three sections, and after 4 months using it once a week I'm still not close to memorizing the material. I suggest getting a hold of Rodney Yee's Yoga for Strength as well, which is much slower, and working with both dvds for a balanced program.",1039651200,2,529,4.196078431372549
1367563,5,B00004XOX2,"The tape mentions that it is for beginners. I disagree. While it is an outstanding workout, it is most definitley not for beginners. Perhaps more intermediate. You need to have a basic knowledge of the poses and form before trying this. However, it is outstanding. I stopped lifting weights altogether because the strength segment is so much more efficient and result effective. Whether you are male or female, this tape, along with proper diet and perhaps pilates, will get you the body you've wanted. It really is that good!",1038355200,,526,4.921348314606742
1367564,4,B00004XOX2,"The Rodney Yee workouts will provide you with almost instant results. In three to four days of practice you will notice a marked improvement in your energy level. Your posture will also improve; however, these exercises are not for beginners. If you have some experience with yoga then  try the Yee workouts. They're strenuous, muscle toning, and ligament stretching programs. For anyone involved in competitive sports these yoga exercises will help to lessen the chances of twists and sprains, but to reiterate, if you are new to yoga approach these DVDs with common sense and please do not subject yourself to overstraining and possible injury.",1038355200,,646,5.152380952380953
1367565,5,B00004XOX2,"Aloha,I did Rodney's excellent VHS ""Yoga for Energy"" 3 times a week for 6 years.  Finally got a DVD player and wanted to try something new.  This Power Yoga DVD keeps with Rodney's tradition of quality yoga teachings.  Imho, it's fine for either the beginner or intermediated student.  Sure, the beginner won't be able to do everything right away, but that's ok, they'll be able to learn quickly. Over the years Rodney has become my favorite ""video"" yoga teacher.  The routines are challenging and interesting, and best of all, he lets the poses speak for themselves rather than submerge the viewer in a sea of new age mumbo jumbo. Rodney Yee's DVD for ""Power Yoga"" is a no risk purchase, imho.  And I *love* the DVD format, head and shoulders better than VHS.Enjoy!",1035331200,3,766,4.7218045112781954
1367566,1,B00004XOX2,"I watched the interview and thought 'Great.  Eventually I'll be able to do this too.'  Then I watched the first program and realized that there is no instruction whatsoever for the novice.
I've never tried yoga before and after watching the one segment one time, offered the dvd to my sister (otherwise I would have thrown it out).
If you are not very flexible already, look for something else.  I would only recommend this to someone who already has some yoga background and can start right out doing most of the positions.",1028937600,4,524,4.673913043478261
1367567,2,B00004XOX2,"The DVD says it is for beginners, but Rodney goes WAY too fast for anyone who isn't well versed in the poses to follow.  Do not get this DVD unless you are already familiar with all the poses, it will not teach them to you.",1028332800,5,223,3.9555555555555557
1367568,4,B00004XOX2,"I am surprised no one mentioned this in the reviews I read: the timing between Yee's visual and audio cues are inconsistent, i.e., sometimes his movements are ahead of his words, other times behind. This is not a big deal if you always follow Yee on the screen but becomes a big deal if you mostly listen. While most of his movements are slightly behind his audio cues, Yee does move ahead of his own words on multiple occasions.
I disagree that it's a ""complete"" workout. IMHO, many fundamental poses are missing. Furthermore, there are 2 sets of distracting cool downs and warm-ups if you do all 3 programs together. Or maybe I have ADD.
I also disagree that this is for beginners. In order for this to be a complete beginners' program, the DVD--at very minimum--needs to include a section that concentrate on individual poses. For example, a person with no yoga background might not know what ""lift the arch"" means.
Despite above shortcomings, this is one of the best instructional videos I've used. The instruction is mostly concise and clear; the choices of camera angles are helpful; and the background music and visuals are awesome.
What I like the most about this DVD is the pace. Yee makes sure you don't just sit there and impatiently wait for next thing to happen. Even when you're not moving, Yee makes you work on ""internal"" elements such as breathing or concentrate on stretching a particular part of the body.",1020643200,58,1424,4.72289156626506
1367569,5,B00004XOX2,"It's a great workout.  I am a beginner and I find it a little challenging to keep up, but I like it alot.  I also like that you can do one of the three workouts or the whole thing.",1017878400,,180,3.58974358974359
1367570,4,B00004XOX2,"The picturesque backdrops make this DVD visually pleasing while the workouts make it physically demanding. Like some have mentioned, it is very quick and the first time I found myself watching the TV and feeling rushed. After I got the poses down I would watch only when I was in a position that lent itself to viewing the screen, and it became easier to keep up. I think the speed at which he moves through the workout is also an example of the difference between yoga and power yoga. I am in fairly good shape and think this DVD would discourage someone that wasn't already flexible. I look forward to keeping it a part of my workout program.",1016064000,6,644,4.466101694915254
1367571,5,B00004XOX2,"Steel is a lot more flexible than I am, and I consider being able to touch my knees an incredible feat. The idea of touching my toes without bending a knee has been nothing more than a dream, at least until I met Rodney Yee. My stiff body finds the idea of yoga intriguing. It's a known fact that flexibility adds to greater gains in strength and sports, plus everyone talks about the mental calming of yoga. When I came across Yee's DVD of ""Power Yoga for Stamina, Strength, and Flexibility"", the word ""Flexibility"" made me decide to try what yoga is about.
The DVD is separated into three workouts: Stamina, Strength and Flexibility, with each program more difficult than the previous one. The first time I tried the Stamina routine, which is the easiest of the three, I thought I had made a mistake in buying this DVD. The posses were rapid, the names of the posses were unknown to me, and my body tired quickly from bending in new directions. By the third day I could complete the routine, and after two weeks I had it memorized.
The big question is, ""Does it work?"". I've only been doing the stamina workout for a month on an every-other-day basis. In that time, I've gone from only being able to touch the top of my ankle in a one-legged forward bend to being able to grab my foot with both hands. That's an increase by 4-6 inches. Some of the posses I'm still too tight to perform properly, but with each passing day, I perform them a little more correctly. If you're inflexible, like me, moving from between posses may be difficult. For the life of me I cannot go from ""Downward Facing Dog"" or ""Plank Position"" into the ""Lunge"" in one simple step like Yee does. Instead, I have to step as far as I can, and then quickly readjust. Don't give up on this DVD because you don't perform the posses like Yee does. Just remember, he's a master and has been doing this for decades. I'm sure in fifteen years I'll be able to move into the Lunge with a simple step.
I don't feel this is like other exercise tapes where you slave to throw punches or jump around a step. This one shows results almost immediately, and it becomes addicting. Yoga is my favorite part of my workout. Once I started yoga I realized just how tight I really am. I have a long way to go before I can fold in half or put my feet behind my head, but I'm looking forward to what next month will bring.",1012953600,85,2370,4.328089887640449
1367572,4,B00004XOX2,"This is the first time I have tried power yoga and even though I was familiar with yoga postures, I found the pace too fast. I couldn't move between the postures quickly enough and ended up missing some. Also, the scenery was so beautiful, I wanted to watch while I was doing it but this was impossible and I had to just listen to Rodney's voice. This is not for beginners at all. Having said this, I try to use this DVD every morning and think it is good value for money and actually feel physically and mentally better. I would recommend this for intermediate practitioners. I DO LOVE RODNEY YEE THOUGH :) I look forward to hearing his soothing voice and seeing his lovely smile every morning. Is there a Rodney fan club? The interview with Rodney included on the DVD is very inspirational and philosophical as he talks about the effect yoga has had on his life and relationship with his father. He comes across very natural and not like a celebrity. After trying other Rodney DVDs, I have found this to be one of my favorites. Go buy it!",1012348800,5,1040,4.421875
1367573,4,B00004XOX2,"I recently started taking power yoga classes at the local Y, and wanted to get a DVD that I can work with at home.  I purchased this DVD because my instructor recommended Rodney Yee.  It's the perfect companion to use in addition of taking actual courses, you get to practice the poses and its flow that you learn in class with three separate 25 minute segments or one entire workout.
Yee does go quite quickly with the poses, but I think it's part of the rhythm of yoga.  Definitely not suitable for someone that has no prior knowledge of yoga.",1011312000,11,545,4.43
1367574,5,B00004XOX2,"Having used virtually all of the Yoga workouts available (Power and Non), this DVD workout is simply the best available.  It provides the option of doing one, two or all three of the workouts:  Stamina, Strength and/or Flexibility.  Each of these workouts is a complete workout on its own.  This is perfect for those times when my time is more limited, such as in the morning before leaving for work when I'll choose one of the three to jump-start my day.  When I have more time such as in the evenings or on the weekend, I'll do two or three of the segments.  Doing just one of the workouts per day is more than enough to help me feel that I am keeping fit.  I consider myslf an average yoga practitioner.  As such, I find the routines to be quite ""do-able"", with the exception perhaps of some serious pretzel-type positons in the Strength workout that get easier each time I do them.  Rodney Yee is a clear and inspirational instructor;  half of the enjoyment of the workouts is listening to his calming instruction.  My recommendation is to view each of the workouts once before engaging in them just to review any positions that may be potentially challenging.  If you're looking for the one yoga DVD that will provide a challenging workout whatever your needs and time constraints, look no further.  This is the one!",1009670400,25,1321,4.594017094017094
1367575,1,B00004XOX2,"Unlike my other reviews, I'm going to be brief here:  This workout is sold as a beginner workout and it is not for anyone who hasn't had a solid background in the poses required.  Rodney Yee ought to include an instructional section to this set that leads the true beginner through each stance and pose, and gives the beginner that he is selling this DVD to a good base to start these fast paced sequences that make up this workout.  I'm very disappointed.
The music is nice, the backgrounds are beautiful, but this workout isn't for anyone who hasn't had a complete yoga class prior to attempting this one.",1007683200,9,607,4.5504587155963305
1367576,4,B00004XOX2,"That's what Power Yoga is: a fairly continuous switch from posture to posture.
The first time I did this I thought: ""My God, this is too advanced for me--it's going pretty fast.""
After the second time I was fine: you end up listening rather than watching, and once you've figured out the routine, you know what's coming (most of the first half of the flexibility segment is repetitive).
If you're an absolute beginner, don't start with power yoga.  If you've done it a while or intermittently and want a step up, I like this DVD.  The music's fine and Rodney's voice is pretty soothing.

1367577,3,B00004XOX2,"Many other reviewers complained that Yee's pace was too quick.  I thought I knew enough about yoga to keep up so I ordered it.  But all those reviewers were right.  I do not have the flexibility to change positions as quickly as he does.  While I don't have to watch the TV screen (I know what position he is going to when he says the position's name), most of the time I end up scrambling around very un-yoga-ically (apologies for the bad grammar) to get into the next position.  By that time he's on the third one.  Only get this if you are VERY fit and VERY limber and you know your poses.",1003449600,16,592,4.1946902654867255

Its quick transitions between moves will get your heart rate up, and you'll be surprised how quickly your poses will improve with this three-pronged approach. Rodney Yee is personable, though I don't think a true beginner who is not familiar with a few basic poses could keep up right away. Just watch it through once or twice and get started--you'll fall in love with yoga!",1000166400,2,530,4.835164835164835

1367580,4,B00004XOX2,"This DVD is pretty good but definitely not for beginners or people who are not already in good shape. The workout is very thorough but there is really no explanation of how to get into the poses if you are not as flexible or experienced as the instructor, nor does the instructor really explain what the poses are supposed to accomplished. For beginners, I would recommend Yoga Zone series.  They are much more thorough in their explanations and usually one of the instructors on the video will show you how to maintain proper form in a pose even if you can't extend as far as the instructor.",999302400,7,592,4.5327102803738315
1367581,3,B00004XOX2,"I am an advanced beginner and has been taking yoga lessons at the local gym and doing yoga to videotapes for the last 3 months. I found the DVD a bit disappointing since to me, it was not very challenging, particularly compared to the Power Yoga classes and DVDs I've seen and practiced. In comparison, Rodney went through the motion far too quickly (for my taste) and I hardly broke a sweat when doing his routine. I also found it disconcerting that what he narrates might not be what he is doing at the same time. However, once you get used to the routine, I just listened to him and rather than watch his positions. Lastly, some of the positions are also way difficult for beginners (for which I assume this DVD is). The cinematography in this DVD is great though. If you truly want a challenging power yoga workout and is advanced beginner/intermediate like me, I really enjoyed Bryan Kest's Power Yoga series.",998697600,29,914,4.579268292682927
1367582,2,B00004XOX2,"If you are new to Yoga, this DVD will not help you.  Everything goes by too quickly.  Most of the really good beginner yoga videos are only on VHS for some reason.  I hope this changes.",995932800,10,185,4.083333333333333
1367583,3,B00004XOX2,"Unless you're already familiar with yoga or/and extremly flexible there is not much you can do with this DVD.
Yee moves rapidly from one position to another without explaining breathing or any of the moves in much detail. (well, he does tell the name of the move...) I've never done any kind of Yoga before and it is nearly impossible for me to follow him. I keep looking up in TV to see what he is doing next (and doing so, do not do the move properly since my head was suppose to be down) By the time I position myself for the next move he is already moving to another...
I suppose for someone familiar with Yoga this could be a great workout -it does look beautiful! But for someone without any basic knowledge it is quite frustrating .
If only this DVD had included some kind of instructions for the poses and proper breathing you might feel that you will get the  ""hang of it"". This way I feel I'm doing everything wrong and I have no idea how to correct it.",994982400,24,963,4.233695652173913
1367584,4,B00004XOX2,"This video is my only exposure to yoga to date.  After doing this workout for several months, I really enjoy it.  However, it's not something you can just jump into.  Since I was already in pretty good shape when I began this workout, it only took a couple of weeks for me to be able to perform the entire routine.  For someone who is looking to get into shape, this may not be the place to start, though.  I still think he moves too fast at times.  A good bit of memorization is required before you can actually flow with the workout, as opposed to trying to see what's going on while your body is moving between positions it has never encountered before.  Overall, I think this video was an excellent entry point into yoga for my fitness level, and I enjoyed the challenging aspects of it as well as the tremendous increase in flexibility this workout has given me.",991526400,12,867,4.38125
1367585,5,B00004XOX2,"What a great set of Power Yoga routines.  At first I wasn't sure that I was really going to be able to do it, but after a few months I was!  This is a great set of videos and is a must to own in anyone's library!",990835200,,212,3.4893617021276597
1367586,2,B00004XOX2,"... and that's not really a good thing. He moves from one position to another about every 2-5 seconds, which makes it hard to keep up. It also makes it difficult to focus on doing the moves correctly or breathing appropriately. This is exacerbated by the fact that he provides either no guidance or very minimal guidance on any of the moves. For example, he'll tell you the name of the position you're supposed to be doing, but if you've never done it before, that's not very helpful. Or he'll say things like ""exhale-right-leg-back-exhale-kneel-exhale-push-up-position"" without ever pausing, and leaving you confused as to whether you're supposed to do one looong exhale, or breathe in and out quickly. Not only does the speed make it difficult to do the moves, difficult to get good stretches in, and difficult to breathe correctly, it also increases the risk of injury--I hurt my knee through overextending, even though it got better in a week or so. I suppose if you've been doing yoga a long time, know the names of all the moves, know what they're supposed to feel like, know what breathing you're supposed to do, and can snap into each position on a moment's notice, you might love this video, since it lets you do the moves at an aerobic pace. Otherwise, it's a decent aerobic workout but fast, confusing, and easy to do wrong and possibly injure yourself.
Another thing I found a little confusing, although it might be OK given the push-relax-push-relax nature of yoga, if you choose to do the ""full workout,"" it simply rolls together the beginning, intermediate, and advanced workouts with NO editing, so you go through the entire warmup-workout-cooldown cycle three full times. I found it a little odd, and also found that it makes it easy to quit the workout early, since there are great places to stop.
So I guess every time I finish the workout I think something along the lines of, ""Cool. I've been introduced to a few new yoga moves, although I'm fairly certain I didn't do them correctly, and my knee is hurting. Maybe I'll try this again in a year or so. And maybe not.""",990316800,12,2088,4.7076502732240435

He uses weird names for poses that is different than other classes, so can be confusing.  And often his instructions are cosmic 'be at one with the earth' stuff that isn't helpful.
