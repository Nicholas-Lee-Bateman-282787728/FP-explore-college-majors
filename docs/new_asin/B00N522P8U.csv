8676299,5,B00N522P8U,I liked that the picture was 16:9. I liked the action and violence. I liked that there was an extreme amount of bullets flying. I always watch until the end of the closing credits and there was more after. If you don't watch to the bitter end you won't get the point of the story. That was a very interesting story.,1503705600,,315,4.180327868852459
8676300,1,B00N522P8U,Don't waste your time. This movie is horrible. Poor acting and it's just all over the place. Wish it was 0 stars.,1495324800,,113,4.181818181818182

8676302,4,B00N522P8U,"This is a campy unintentionally funny film. At no time can it be taken seriously. It opens with a warning that the people in this film are ""not to be role models."" Phew! Dewey Allen (I don't remember them using his name in the film, and it is not in the credits) is a drug runner who wants out after his driver is shot, which in itself was a funny scene. You hear the shot from a silencer. The guy who was hit says, ""I don't feel so good....tell my uncle..."" He then falls over. Dewey examines him and hey! It was a head shot!  Yes, he got shot in the head and didn't realize it. At one point a stripper is tossed a fully automatic assault rifle which she catches with one hand at the trigger, and while swinging on the stripper pole with one hand she shoots up the lousy tippers in the audience with the other hand. No recoil. The acting was the pits, especially when it was two people talking in a car.

And what was the Mississippi madam with the Irish accent and red dial phone?

Some lines:
Preacher to Dewey as he goes into a strip joint: "" Hell does not need scum like you.""

Dewey's boss: ""You want out. But in is in.""

Becky: ""I'm not little, I'm barely legal.""

Then there was a guy with a Russian accent always walking around with a bottomless martini glass. "" Pull trigger. Gun work fine.""

And there was the guy who wants revenge for his sister. He carries two automatic weapons. One is labeled ""God"" and the other ""Justice.""

This could be an MST classic.

F-bomb. Minor sex scene. Plenty of stripper nudity and crude talk and bad crude jokes.  4 STARS for the wrong reasons.",1416009600,,1589,4.249169435215947
