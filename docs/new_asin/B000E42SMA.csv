8105629,5,B000E42SMA,"I highly recommend this DVD.  It is especially helpful for those of us who do not have a lot of time to read alternative health related material (there is some denser material out there).  I suppose my only critique would be that I wish the DVD was longer and more detailed!  I would pay to see a part II, part II, etc. or some segment in which Mr. Brunetti gives firmer details on such practices (such as chelation).  When you first delve into the alternative treatments, this DVD may seem broad, but as you go on, learn more, and return to this presentation, you'll be able to understand the cohesiveness of Brunetti's course of action.  One can visit Brunetti's website for other related presentations though.

Again, I highly, highly recommend this DVD. I am particularly thankful for accompanying pamphlet (with supplement, food, dietary, resource info, etc.).  Perhaps even more so than the DVD, this information has been substantially helpful.  I recommend this presentation to everyone!  Out of all the cancer related literature and DVDs I purchased, this one has probably been tops.",1419811200,,1091,4.950549450549451
8105630,4,B000E42SMA,Jerry passed away recently.  I suppose the cancer got him in the end.  But don't look at that as a failure.  Look at all the extra years he got in good health he probably would not have gotten had he followed the oncologist's advice.  Reminds me of another man who wrote a book about cancer.  He was told he would die in 6 months of acute leukemia if he didn't do chemo right away.  Instead he started juicing and lived another 10 years before the cancer killed him. Was he a failure?  Certainly not.,1419811200,3,500,4.25531914893617
8105631,4,B000E42SMA,I was able to understand nutrition for the body and how to sustain when eating this  recommended way. Its easily understood and very informative.,1398816000,,145,5.041666666666667
8105632,3,B000E42SMA,"Fascinating.  I'm glad he's healed.  I heard him speak once.  However, I found this video dull in its presentation.  Also, with so many therapeutic methods used, I'm not sure anyone could figure out what he did that was most effective.  I felt overwhelmed by all this information.  If faced with cancer, I think I'd still be confused about how to proceed on a more natural path after watching this.",1386028800,2,398,4.695652173913044
8105633,5,B000E42SMA,"Cured himself of cancer. Chemo was offered - but not accepted. Without doubt a most enlightening source of information on cancer, general health, and nutrition. Professional, entertaining, understandable... from a man who practices what he preaches. Produced in 2004, if you see Jerry today [December 2012]... he's looking very well. His speaking diary for 2013 is filling fast.!",1355788800,,379,5.551724137931035
8105634,5,B000E42SMA,"Jerry Brunetti has created an excellent guide for health and longevity not just for those suffering from cancer, but also for those who are perfectly healthy  and who wish to remain so.  I highly recommend this video.",1321142400,3,217,4.837837837837838
8105635,5,B000E42SMA,"This video is incredibly good. It is very well done. Since this video only had 3 1/2 stars, I decided to write a review. This video is a 5 star video. It includes helpful information even for those who do not have cancer. If you have cancer, this is a must have video! You will not regret spending the money to purchase this DVD.",1308268800,6,329,4.15625
8105636,5,B000E42SMA,"Have you ever heard the saying ""If you want to know what it's like to be chased by a bear, you better ask someone who has been chased by a bear""? Well, Jerry has been chased by the bear of cancer, and knows what he is talking about. No speculation, just plain facts. Even though I personally do not have cancer, I bought this because I have had some of the same experiences that the author has had with Western medicine. (I had seen another one of his video's on the internet. [...] Also, I am already a believer in what he teaches, and wanted to fortify my own knowledge. The DVD is very thorough and informative, going through in detail why each food is beneficial. It comes with a small brochure type booklet listing the healing foods that he talks about in this video, making it much easier to shop for these foods. I find Jerry interesting to listen to, and would highly recommend this DVD.",1228694400,18,895,4.365269461077844
8105637,5,B000E42SMA,"Brunetti discusses in great detail the different things he has done to treat & cure his lymphoma.  He refers to the kitchen as his pharmacy & steps the viewer through the creation of his smoothies & special herbal tea.  He discusses vegetable juicing & a number of supplements.  His approach to diet seems wholly consistent with Sally Fallon's ""Nourishing Traditions"".  I was left thinking that his cancer hardly stood a chance given all he was doing.  I am doing many of the same things in an effort to rid myself of my lymphoma.",1176336000,26,530,4.655913978494624
