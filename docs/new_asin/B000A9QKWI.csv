8076414,1,B000A9QKWI,"i've tried this video several times with the same response: DEFEAT!!

i work out 5 days a week AND dance and i could not get this! the warmup was relatively easy and each time i try the video i think ""yeah, i can do this!"" but when the actual workout starts... forget it.

they don't give you enough time to get the moves down plus they really don't explain how to do it. like i said, i do a lot of dancing and i couldn't get it. so if you're doing this video solely to get in shape and have fun while doing it, this is so not for you.",1313366400,2,535,3.8545454545454545
8076415,2,B000A9QKWI,"I've been exercising and dancing religiously for years and years, and am familiar with most dance moves.  However, this workout requires you to be able to incorporate multiple, relatively complex combinations in a very short time.  People who buy a workout tape are using it to get exercise, not learn how to dazzle their friends, so it shouldn't be so hard, you can't do it.  I've tried this at least 4 times with the same response; after the first 10 minutes, I get frustrated and switch it with another one.  Significant turning is a really bad idea when you're learning a routine, because then you can't see the TV, and he's got these turns right in the beginning.  Forget it.",1261526400,3,680,4.633333333333334

8076417,2,B000A9QKWI,"This is a good paced dance that doesn't slow down. He goes right into the basic steps before the dance-inspired good warm-up & the cool down also uses mostly steps & stretching. The only time he slows down is to go 1/2-3/4 tempo to teach you new steps. There is even another window showing his back when teaching new steps. There are 4 girls who do backup who are not professional dancers who will stumble along with you.
What I didn't like was the dance moves. They are all old school Broadway, hand raised high, small leaps, box steps, kickball changes, etc. basics. The routines change & there are several of them, but it's always still the same style.

There's a trailer at collagevideo com",1167696000,3,694,4.552
8076418,3,B000A9QKWI,"I got this dvd  because I was looking for an aerobic workout with some movement and funk. So I looked around and found Patrick Goudeau. I ordered it, got it and played it thinking I was going to get a good cardio workout my first time out...I didn't! This isn't to say that the dvd was bad just that it takes more than a few sessions to pick up the steps.

So I spent my time bumling and stumbling along picking up a few steps here and there hoping that I could get through atleast 20 mins so I could get my heart rate up. I think once the steps are learned, its going to be a fantastic workout, but it is a bit frustrating not being able to catch on. I gave it three stars because I thought that it was not immediately user friendly.",1133740800,18,734,4.02054794520548
