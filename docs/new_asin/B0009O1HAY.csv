8063974,5,B0009O1HAY,"Tom and Martine are well experienced in Tie-Dyeing. Thanks to them for providing 2 DVDs with excellent step-by-step video instructions that are still useful today. The accompanying music can sometimes be intrusive, but audio technology wasn't as good back then as it is today.",1477180800,,276,5.295454545454546
8063975,5,B0009O1HAY,This is a great tool to anyone who is ready to expand their tie dye knowledge,1465689600,,77,3.875
8063976,4,B0009O1HAY,"The information is good, but these were created ten years ago.  So I'm not sure how accurate it is now regarding the dyes themselves.  The folding techniques are shown wonderfully, that is why I wanted to buy the set so I am happy with that.  I contacted the True Tie Dye owners (Tom & Martine) about a defect in one of the DVDs in the set, and never heard back from them.  That was disappointing.",1415836800,,397,4.253333333333333
8063977,5,B0009O1HAY,"Wish this was available for free on YouTube, but everybody has got to make a living. Good information and worthwhile if you are serious about tie dye, nice people, but overlook the 90's video editing and corniness.",1281398400,2,214,4.8108108108108105
8063978,5,B0009O1HAY,These guys know what they're doing. Lots of great tips and tricks. Very helpful if you are learning how to tie dye and want to take it to another level.,1244592000,4,152,4.1
8063979,5,B0009O1HAY,"Tom and Martine have done a wonderful job illustrating their long time,earned experience with the wonderful and colorful process of tie dyeing.  I am a tie dyer myself, have seen other videos on the market, and this is the best.  I have learned a lot from them.  Their presentation, format, explanation, funky music score, illustration of the process with a speeded up review at the end of each lesson is really fun to watch and helps you learn it and remember it. And then theres the bloopers and inserts...too funny! I highly recommend to any new tie dyer to get this and learn it right.  I also recommend it to seasoned dyers as Tom and Martine make some very good points about chemistry to achieve optimum results.  As far as tie patterns go, they are wonderful, gorgeous and brilliant. Better than a class as you can view the DVD over and over again.

TIE DYE LIVES !!!  And more and more people are appreciating it for the art form that it is.  Thanks Tom and Martine for educating us in how to get the primo results we all love to see.

You can't be depressed and wear tie dye!

8063980,5,B0009O1HAY,"You most likely fall into one of two categories. Either you have no idea how to make shapes like hearts and peace signs, or you are using a needle and thread to create theses shapes. If you are the latter, you are most likely ready to give up on creating shapes on your tie-dyes. The process is tedious and time consuming. The results are spectacluar, but you are asking yourself if it is worth it.

Well, put down your needle and thread. Tie Dye 202 teaches you how to create shapes without sewing a single stitch. With this simple technique, you will be creating hearts and peace symbols easily and quickly, without sacraficing the end result. And hearts and peace symbols are just the beginning. Using the technique detailed in Tie Dye 202, your imagination is your only limitation.

Once you have mastered Tie Dye 101 and 202, you will probably be thinking that 303 can't possibly teach you anything you don't all ready know. Well, you are wrong. You might also wonder why an entire DVD is dedicated to mandalas. After all, aren't all mandalas pretty much the same? Not even close.

Remember back to elementy school, around Christmas time. You would fold a piece of paper and cut certain areas to create a snowflake as unique as the real thing. Well, imgagine being able to do that with fabric. But instead of cutting, you use every color of the rainbow to define how the finished product will look. The results are truly breath taking.",1116288000,18,1440,4.6171875
