8061519,4,B0009IWFXS,Covers pretty much all of the really interesting touristy spots in Colorado.  If you ever go there this is a good intro before you go.,1409529600,,134,4.36
8061520,5,B0009IWFXS,"This disc provides a great overview of Colorado.  Obviously not comprehensive (as it is not 27 hours long!) but does a good job of mixing highlights (like National Parks) with lesser known sights.  Also covers both rural and urban Colorado, including Aspen, Denver, and a number of smaller towns.  As with all of the other Finley-Holiday videos I've seen, the photography is very good.  My only slight complaint is that the material is not organized geographically, but rather in what seemed to me to be a somewhat random order.

I ordered directly from the Finley-Holiday website and received my order promptly.  The version of this disk I received included two extras:  footage of snow-clearing on the Pike's Peak cog railway and a '60s era documentary on the history of the Colorado cattle industry.",1331424000,,802,4.984962406015038
