The highlight of this show is the very professional drumming of Gavin Harrison. He's the only musician of the band that really blew me away in an individual sense. In a collective sense, there were a few strong tracks, but not enough to give this 5 stars. Still...if you are a fan at all, this is worth buying. I don't regret that at all!",1159056000,6,452,4.206896551724138
8137869,5,B000HA48A6,"If your curiosity for good music got you this far your an idiot it you don't buy this one...... just read the reviews. Suddenly it's out of print and you've got to wait.

  This is better than excellent!",1158537600,,288,4.053571428571429
8137870,5,B000HA48A6,"Let's get the obvious out of the way.  If you're a PT fan, you're getting this DVD, end of story. For those of you who have never heard of this band, you owe it to yourself to check them out, and find out what you're missing. PT is one of the most talented bands I've heard in quite some time.  1 listen to In Absentia, and I had to have everything they've ever done.

The audio quality is exceptional for this DVD, which comes as no suprise, since frontman/multi-instrumentalist/audiophile Steven Wilson oversaw the production.

I think the drummer, Gavin Harrison, deserves special mention; this guy is a genius on the skins, and breathes new life into older PT songs (Hatesong was a standout performance here); his ""cymbal song"" on the bonus disc plays out like a live-action Animusic piece, and is a terrific showcase of his talents.

Seriously, these guys should be a household name as far as I'm concerned.  Their talent, as well as the fantastic songwriting, should not be overlooked by anyone.  If your new to the PT universe, I'd start with In Absentia or Deadwing.",1158537600,4,1074,4.680851063829787

OK reviewing this, the short review is; get it, this is the best band out there right now.  The material and performance are both superb.

The longer version is, Porcupine Tree and Steven Wilson alter their musical direction every couple of years (sort of the theme of the rarely played Buying New Soul) and this is where they were in 2005 and 2006. This is their first DVD and it perfectly captures what that tour was.  I happened to see the first show of this tour in Tampa (thanks for going Colette) and the DVD shows that they just became tighter and heavier as the tour went on.

The Deadwing Tour was heavier than the old psychadelic, progressive and song based material (yes its too bad there weren't official DVDs for the other phases of PT), but it is still great stuff. (as Steven sings on Arriving somewhere-- all my designs simplified, all of my plans compromised, all of my dreams sacrificed). While the music now may be slightly simplified anyone would be hard pressed to say much has been sacrificed.

Some may question the inclusion of non-cd tracks such as Mother and Child Divided or So-Called Friend, but fans of the band either know these or get to know them quick and they fit the overall feel of the tour very well. Anytime you have as much great material as PT the song selection can be questioned, but this performance is so powerful throughout I'd say just sit back and enjoy!!

The 5.1 audio is as good on this disc as Ive heard (I also highly reccomend the DVD-A versions of Stupid Dream, In Absentia and Deadwing, if you want hear how good 5.1 DTS can sound, and make yourself slightly deaf without realizing you are doing it;-)The video is nicely shot, lots of shifts of focus without being jarring, and the camera seems to be where you'd like it to be most of the time (a real flaw in tons of Live DVD's). Also, there are no cheesy effects or technological experiments which means this should stand the test of time.

Now, let me add, this DVD isn't perfect, but the complaints are fairly minor. The thoughts I had after only a couple of watches... The vocals a on Open Car are a bit buried in the mix, and the video doesnt (and maybe couldnt) capture the size and integration of the films that accompanied the songs.

Also, don't think you are getting 2 discs of live music, Disc 1 is a full concert, Disc 2 is odds and ends.  I wasn't sure why they didn't just include the entire Rockpalast show (if they could show 2 songs, why not the whole show?)  My guess is because it was largely the same material, but fans wouldnt have minded.

Rarely do DVD captures bands at their peak. Fans can argue for the different albums of PT being their best, but this really seems to a document of a great band at the top of their game. If all music was this thoughtful, composed and sincere, I would like a lot more music.

End thought, if you like PT at all, get this!  If you are curious, get this! If you have friends that might like this; show them!  People into this band know there really isn't a way to describe how close to perfect they are (and only God knows why they aren't HUGE, and I suspect he has questions)and here's a great document of that circa 2005-06.",1158364800,10,3795,4.499272197962155
