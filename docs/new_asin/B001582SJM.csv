8257682,5,B001582SJM,"This summer evening campfire is very realistic and cozy.  The video is very clear, you can clearly see the leave on the plants and the fire has little curls of smoke.  The stream is quite enchanting, and you can even see the green moss on the large rocks where the water spills over them.  There are great natural sounds with the crackle of the fire and rushing water of the stream.  There is an option for soothing synthesizer type music or an option for both natural sounds and music.  It is so inviting, you are all set for a relaxing evening imagining roasting marshmallows or s'mores or popping popcorn over the flames.  I love it!!!",1432252800,,638,4.504347826086956
