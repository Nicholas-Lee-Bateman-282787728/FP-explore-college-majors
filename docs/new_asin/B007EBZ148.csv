8515181,5,B007EBZ148,"Why am I giving this five stars? This is an easy to watch, non-threatening, easily digestible documentary with one simple message:  Relationships only work if you make the commitment to invest the time and energy it takes to achieve true intimacy and then actually make that investment of time and energy. I did that when I was young and it was worth it, for that relationship. Once he was gone, I can't say that I have ever wanted to invest in that way again. People die, they get sick and then die, they get sick and change enough such that it feels like they've died, and then they die, and it is quite a bit of work to put in if someone is just going to die. However, if you are young and healthy and so is the object of your affection, this is a genuinely effective and direct message that can help you to achieve your relationship goals. Whether or not you agree with the more spiritual based elements, love over lifetimes, the cosmos, and so on, is irrelevant. The practical advice on living in honesty, forgiveness, openness and friendship with your partner is why you would want to sit through this one and, if you do, I hope it helps you.",1503360000,2,1148,4.389671361502347

8515186,4,B007EBZ148,"the other review says that they don't like the video...I have a direct contrast, I really thought the video was interesting.  I work with couples who could use some reminding on many of these points made in the video.  I am a simple person and don't need earth shattering ideas.  The simple reminders are quite helpful.",1362441600,2,319,4.660714285714286
8515187,1,B007EBZ148,Such a waste of my time. Irritating in every way. I'm surprised this was produced. Would be substandard for an eighth grader.,1361404800,,125,4.7272727272727275

8515189,5,B007EBZ148,"This DVD busts many of the myths and preconceived fairytale notions about what love really is.  While real love is undeniably the ultimate of human experiences, this DVD lets us know that part of the journey of love also includes the surfacing and ideally the healing of the ""shadow"" parts of ourselves.

The ""secrets"" of love shared in this DVD are from the likes of Deepak Chopra, Marianne Williamson, John Gray, Marci Shimoff, and a host of other experts on love.  What they share opens our minds to understand the other person in the relationship in a new way, and perhaps even more importantly understand ourselves and why we behave in relationships the way we do.

If I have a criticism of this DVD it would be the following: I think the DVD would be more appropriately titled ""The REAL Secrets of Love"" as it clearly distinguishes itself from the abundance of garbage online that purports to reveal secrets to experiencing love in our lives.  Also, I would have liked to have seen more practical steps offered on how to incorporate the secrets that are revealed into our daily life. Perhaps a follow up DVD or book will do that.",1340668800,,1135,4.655
