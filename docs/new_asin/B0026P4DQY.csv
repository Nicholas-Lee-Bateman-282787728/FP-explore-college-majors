3856454,2,B0026P4DQY,"This exercise video indicates it is geared for persons in wheelchairs.  Yes, someone sitting in a wheelchair can use this, but it is NOT appropriate for a person confined to a wheelchair.  Amanda Cook clearly is not gearing her program to persons with spinal cord injuries when she discusses exercise form and techniques.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chair-Aerobics-for-Everyone-Wheelchair-Workout/dp/B002AT4PGE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chair Aerobics for Everyone: Wheelchair Workout</a>This video was misrepresented as a program appropriate for wheelchair bound persons.",1295827200,19,620,7.597222222222222
3856455,4,B0026P4DQY,As someone who sits in a wheelchair all day every day I am always on the lookout for well thought out workouts they help me maintain the best level of fitness that I can.  This workout is challenging but doable. you feel it but it does not strain my many arthritic joints.  They are actually less painful after the tape It also is vigorous enough to help me control my blood sugars.,1256256000,21,382,4.291666666666667

3856459,1,B0026P4DQY,This has been wonderful for me. I am a bi-lateral amputee and in a chair or 22 years. Most exercises I get bored with but so far not this one.,1423872000,3,142,3.7666666666666666
3856460,5,B0026P4DQY,My father is a disabled Vietnam vet who lost his leg and is wheelchair bound. It makes my heart smile to sneak in and watch him actually do this every day and even enjoy it! Wonderful!,1415577600,3,184,4.138888888888889
3856461,4,B0026P4DQY,"Good workout, motivating, helps to pass the  time.  I would recommend it.  I like that the instructor gives safety tips and moves limbs with care and safety.",1401321600,,157,4.7407407407407405
3856462,5,B0026P4DQY,"I am in a wheelchair and I wanted to get in better shape so I bought this video. I noticed in some of the lower rating reviews that some said the video wasn't for everyone. Duh! There is no exercise program out there that is for everyone. I have found myself in a pretty lazy and mostly sedentary lifestyle and I was still easily able to do the exercises in this video. In fact, there was only one exercise from the Upper Body Workout that I couldn't do. If there's an exercise from the workout that you can't do, just skip it. That's what I did. The great thing about this video, it offers an Upper Body Workout and a Full Body Workout. My advice is to give this video a try. If you don't like it, you can just return it. It's that simple. But I loved it! I plan on using it to get back into good shape and lose some weight.",1380758400,,825,4.036585365853658
3856463,3,B0026P4DQY,"The workout in this video is suitable for someone in a wheelchair, but the host clearly isn't a wheelchair user and that was a letdown. She does provide some good stretching exercises, but this workout is more suited for someone that can walk and might be in recovery rather than being confined. Good and not-so-good parts equally, but a good effort!",1371427200,2,350,4.754098360655738
3856464,3,B0026P4DQY,"I wouldn't say that this is really what I was hoping for but I did get some good exercises out of it.  I certainly would NOT recommend you pay more than the $10 it costs to download it instantly!!  It's not worth more than $10 if you are an active paraplegic.  Otherwise--if you can move your legs--you may feel paying $25 is worth it. For me I already work out with 5 pound weights several days a week. I wanted something to get my heart rate up and keep it there, while working my muscles a bit.  This didn't necessarily do that on it's own. I had to supplement what was demonstrated...and there was a full section of leg exercises that were irrelevant to me.",1369440000,6,661,4.264
3856465,5,B0026P4DQY,"My father is wheelchair bound so I thought this would be perfect for keeping him active while having fun. Well, it does exactly that, he enjoys it so much!!!! And the order came so swiftly.",1363132800,,189,4.428571428571429
3856466,5,B0026P4DQY,"This exercise DVD is the best I've come across so far for wheelchair exercises. The instructor is a wheelchair user herself so all exercises are do-able and uncomplicated and delivered at an even pace. Excellent DVD. Amanda also recommends various other series of exercises such as ""Wheelchair Salsa"". Haven't tried that yet but sounds fun.",1360108800,6,340,5.2
3856467,5,B0026P4DQY,Chair Aerobics for Everyone: Wheelchair Workout is an excellent DVD for people who use a wheelchair but who want aerobic exercise.  I use it regularly.,1352592000,2,151,5.04
3856468,1,B0026P4DQY,"It seems to me that the sequence is backwards. It starts out with a set of very fast exercises, no warmup, and then later the tempo slows down. Also the disclaimer about caution while exercising is at the very end. Weird editing.
At the beginning I though ""this is a good video for someone who is in a wheelchair and is very fit!""
But how many people in a wheelchair are fit to begin with ?
I have been in a wheelchair for 5 years and I am not fit.
Way too fast.

3856472,5,B0026P4DQY,"I have been in a wheelchair with multiple sclerosis getting progressively worse for the last five years.  I recently started physical therapy and needed something to really help me to workout five or six times a week versus the once a week PT/OT is here.  After reading some of the comments I was hesitant to get this workout video.  However, since there really wasn't anything else at the time that I saw on Amazon for wheelchair bound folks, I got it.  I am so glad I did!  I found that it is definitely aerobic exercise for me.  It is the first time I have moved into my target heart rate without using a restorator or stationary bike since I could walk.  It is fun, a lot of work and focuses on your choice of either the upper body or the full body with a mind to keep you strong and with a full range of motion.  I found Amanda Cook to be an excellent instructor/ motivator.  She is like having my own personal trainer in the house whenever I feel up to a workout.  With MS, my strength varies throughout the day.  Now I can exercise when I feel at my strongest.  I am taking it slowly and building up as each of the two sessions (upper body or full body) is 30 minutes or more.  I just started this week and I am expecting great results with regular use of this workout video.  I am going to try more in the Chair Aerobics series one I have used this one for 12 weeks.",1313280000,25,1374,4.15530303030303
3856473,2,B0026P4DQY,"I bought this DVD to use during my 16-plus weeks of being wheelchair-bound with a broken foot.  Until my accident, which occurred 7 weeks ago, I was a super active 50-year old with many years of step aerobics, competitive swimming, hiking, and (most recently) Zumba behind me.  I was not expecting too much from this workout, knowing that it would not give me the kind of workout I am used to.  BUt I was pretty disappointed anyway.  First of all, the production quality is not good -- especially the sound.  The music is horrible (sounds like Muzak) and it is too loud!  It's not easy to hear the instructor, and I wish I could just turn off the music at times.  To make matters worse, the instructor does not have a very strong sense of rhythm or metric pulse!  She is often out of sync with the music, something that drives me (a professional musician) crazy!  The movements are pretty unimaginative and don't even come close to getting my heart rate into an aerobic range.

Nevertheless I did use this DVD every day for about 5 weeks, feeling like it was better than nothing.  However, 2 weeks ago I discovered the DVDs by Jodi Stolove -- Chair Dancing Through the Decades is my favorite.  The music is still bad, but the choreography is so much better, the cueing is great, and the workout gets your whole body moving.  I have now abandoned my Wheechair Workout in favor of the Chair Dancing ones.",1309219200,16,1402,4.515873015873016
