7825302,3,6302424291,"Boy, it this episode bore me. I mean, don't get me wrong, Clayton Raynor's performance as the deaging Admiral was excellent and the idea of someone deaging from a frail old man to a strong young man is a good one. But the dialogue didn't really give me any suspense for what would happen to this man. Also, as much as the makeup for the run of TNG has been solid. They must of had an offweek with the old man makeup, made it look like he was melting. But maybe that was what it was supposed to be, i don't know. I just didn't like it",1119225600,,533,3.9906542056074765
7825303,1,6302424291,"Again, I've been duped by other reviewers (thanks johnstory). How about NOT giving away the ending?The cast is just going through the motions and even the typical special effects are second rate.
Again, check your brain at the door to enjoy this one! Or better yet, go see a doctor.",1025913600,,282,4.66

For those of you who remember Oliver North; this episode has a 24th century twist. The legendary Admiral Jameson comes aboard the Enterprise.  He rides a mechanical wheelchair that looks like Professor X's from the X-Men.  Picard has to take him to a mission to free hostages.
Unbeknownst to our captain; Jameson made a deal with a terrorist leader years ago.  A brutal dictator named Karnas.  Probably a parody on the word carnage.  He gave him weapons for the hostages.  The admiral declared, ""It wasn't my golden oratory that saved these men,"" he cut a deal.
Actor Clayton Rohner, gave an incredible performance as a man living a lie as a great negotiator.  The rest of the cast took a back seat in this episode.  It was well worth it.  I wonder why Clayton was never asked to return as another character?  It's been tradition with this show that many a guest star has come back as someone else.
X-Files fans take note: Rob Bowman; who directed this episode, went on to direct the first X-Files Movie.",979171200,,1023,4.602209944751381
