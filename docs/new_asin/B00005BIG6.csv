1423812,1,B00005BIG6,"I love Pilates, but this is the most boring excercise video I have ever done.  no music, not motivating and Jennifer Kries drones.  I did it a few times and threw it out.  There are lots of other Pilates tapes out there, don't bother with this one.",1044576000,4,248,4.23404255319149
1423813,2,B00005BIG6,"I bought the Precision toning, and Precision Sculpting tapes years ago, before the Pilates craze started. I had been doing yoga for years and also Callanetics and decided to give it a try. Unfortunately the tapes just never lived up to the expectations I had.
I wanted a workout that 1) wouldnt bother my back and 2) would reshape my body with a mat workout. I had done callanetics for years as a teenager and had been thrilled with the results, when I learned that this was a popular workout with celebrities I didn't think I could go wrong.
If you want to get toned from Pilates you truly need to invest the money in a trainer and use a machine, these tapes are not effective enough. Ive tried several of the method tapes besides these and they were never ""enough"" for me.
If you already excersize regularly like I do (1-2 hours a day 5 days a week) then you just won't get much results from these ""light"" movements. If you are a beginner and want to try something new, then these may be good for you. If you really want to get a leaner body and strengthen muscles you never knew you had, try callanetics. Ive been doing it off and on for 8 years and its never failed to give me the results I wanted.",1026950400,9,1202,4.276315789473684
1423814,3,B00005BIG6,"As a die hard fan of Jennifer Kries and her work,  I can attest to the fact that this recent release could not NOT,  and I repeat NOT possibly be an authorized release on her part! She consistently produces quality work and the video company responsible for producing her Method line has must have released this to cash in on her success as a leader in the field,  to try to rival her new line (which I think was released under a new company title) ...  wonder why she left the old company???
Even the photo on the cover doesn't look like something she would approve of!  And it's NOT a Pilates move! When I viewed the contents,  I knew for sure that she couldn't have just produced this,  primarily because the footage resembled her wonderful ""Precision Toning""  from 1996!  (that's almost five years ago now)!  but wasn't nearly as organized or clear or precise.  And finally,  to sum this all up,  it views like a bad pirated version of her original tape!
She could NOT have been the one to produce or release this!  It is a bad joke and makes her look bad,  which for Jennifer is HARD TO believe!  She has a reputation for producing the highest quality work with finesse and elegance and real intelligence.",993600000,41,1210,4.45662100456621
1423853,4,B00005BIG6,"The first thing everyone wants to know is  - do they work? - yes they do. If you follow these exercises to the letter you will get a tighter trimmer body, and much more flexibility. The only issue I have is that they are extremely demanding for a novice. I'm not, but even for someone with years of fitness under their belt, some of the exercises would be extremely demanding for anyone other than a trained dancer. Of course she makes all of this look like a breeze, which they're not. I find her extremely likable to watch and listen to, and there's no strident manner with her. But watch the lower back, and the straight legged bends!  It would be very easy to injure yourself if you were over enthusiastic. She does warn you not to push yourself, but then she demonstrates moves that would challenge anyone. You have to be patient with yourself. It's also highly unlikely that anyone other than a dancer, will be able to do some of these moves. So face that possibility, and the average persons physical limitations, you'll get results.",1469836800,,1040,4.55614973262032
1423854,5,B00005BIG6,"I used this program for years and had this DVD for many years and leant it to a friend--alas, never to be seen again.  Jennifer Kries is an excellent instructor and the sculpting program is exceptionally effective.  Highly recommend.",1465776000,,233,4.948717948717949

1423861,5,B00005BIG6,"I've had this DVD for over 10 years and every time I come back to it, I wonder why I ever stopped.  This is the only style of pilates I can ever do routinely and feel good about and see results from.  Jennifer Kries has a wonderful demeanor and I never feel the desire to talk back to her during the workouts.  I also love her yoga DVD.  Definitely a keeper, and I'd imagine that her other series are just as good.",1431820800,4,414,4.012195121951219

1423873,5,B00005BIG6,"This has been around for years and as a former gymnast, is still the best stretching and toning tape out there. Forget all the new hyped methods, this is the original Pilates.

1423877,1,B00005BIG6,I have really tried to like to use this DVD but have no idea whether i'm on instructions or workout or is the whole workout her giving instructions. The menu is very confusing. And i've tried over and over to figure it out. I don't want to do an hour long workout that could take 35 minutes if it wasn't so slow from her talking. I think there are 7 or 8 different sections but still can't figure out where the actual workout starts. Frustrated. Getting rid of this.,1401494400,4,466,4.247191011235955
1423878,4,B00005BIG6,"I'd had a Jennifer Kries VHS for a long time which I really liked. Unfortunately, several of the dvds have been redone and issued under the old covers. The new ones have drums and other distracting features. This edition is the best - just Ms Kries showing the way.",1395964800,,265,4.428571428571429

1423881,5,B00005BIG6,"This was my ""gateway"" Pilates experience that really got me into Classical Pilates. I've tried other DVDs and none of them made me work as hard as this one...The other ones were just fluff. Jennifer Kries is my hero!",1380758400,,216,4.564102564102564
1423882,4,B00005BIG6,"Jennifer Kries is a wonderful Pilates instructor.  When I taught, I made a point of learning parts of this--the weight section is something Joseph Pilates himself came up with.

However, the video transfer on this makes it bad enough it's hard to watch.  If you want an instant version of this, it's worth the money.  Otherwise, buy the DVD.",1378684800,6,341,4.728813559322034
1423921,5,B00005BIG6,First purchased this video many years ago and I loved it but didn't keep up with it. Now that I am in a different space and exercise (pilates) is apart of this I revisited this video. It's great! Give her two weeks like she said and you will notice a difference!,1371254400,2,262,4.1568627450980395
1423922,3,B00005BIG6,"I really cannot give this a fair review.
I bought it upon suggestion by a friend, but am not in the type of shape to use this.
I tried some DVDs that had simple Pilates exercises after receiving this and those were challenging.
Doubt I'll ever use this DVD.",1370649600,,257,4.26530612244898

1423924,5,B00005BIG6,"The sculpting part of this DVD is the same as the VHS ""Pilates: Precision Sculpting"".  Not a problem I have the VHS, like it a lot, and was happy to find it on DVD also.  I'm going to listen and try the  Precision Toning  part soon.  I'm sure it will be beneficial.",1367971200,,265,4.019230769230769
1423925,5,B00005BIG6,"I hope this is a repackaged version of my absolute favorite Jennifer Kries Pilates VHS - Precision Toning. If it is, there a 10-15 minute segment at the beginning where she explains the moves and provides modified versions. The real deal follows and it is challenging. This is the workout that made me a huge Jennifer Kries fan.",1360195200,,328,4.672413793103448
1423926,5,B00005BIG6,"I love love love this video. I have tried many Pilates classes & plenty of plenty of Pilates videos. I have even tried several other Jennifer Kries videos. But none compare to this one. The routine is just a clear, simple, well explained full body workout. It's not the sort that leaves you wiped out at the end, but it is the sort that leaves you feeling stretched, energized and just worked out. After a few days and a few weeks, the benefits just continue to stack up- better tone, better flexibility, better posture and even better sleep. I highly recommend this workout.",1357257600,4,575,4.592233009708738
1423927,5,B00005BIG6,"I am completely new to Pilates, but not to exersize. I was looking for a new way to challenge myself, and this is definitely a new favourite in my arsenal of workout dvd's. I tend to favor cardio and strength training dvd's, and while this isn't exactly my regular cardio workout, it did have me sweating almost the entire time. I noticed a difference in my posture and a tightness in my muscles after one workout, and I definitely lost weight within a week's use. Jennifer Kries is an excellent instructor- not pushy or fluffy, which are my number one complaints about most exersize instructors. Two big thumbs up.",1356048000,,615,4.651376146788991
1423928,5,B00005BIG6,"I've purchased several dvd(s) by Jennifer Kries, so I'm a fan. This dvd was the first pilates instruction I'd had (originally purchased in VHS). It got me in stellar shape and greatly improved my overall strength. That was many years ago and now re-committed to fitness, I've come back to beginning and this dvd is better than my original.",1355788800,,339,4.762711864406779
1423929,5,B00005BIG6,"When I first tried this workout, I was 16 years old. I was so unflexible that I could not even straighten my back when sitting with my legs parallel in front of me. Jennifer Kries would pull her leg to her head during many of the exercises. At first, I rolled my eyes when she said, ""If you keep working, you will get to this point too."" But her encouragement was so genuine that I decided to keep going, even though I didn't believe that I would ever be as flexible as her. I did every exercise to the best of my ability. Luckily, I was in the privacy of my home; it was quite embarrassing at first! And after about 3 months of doing this video (6 days a week), I wasn't just flexible, I was able to do the splits! I couldn't believe it myself. After this, I even had the confidence to join a ballet class.

I would highly recommend giving this workout a try. I could have given up but I am very grateful to Jennifer Kries for pushing me past my comfort level. I am now 23 years old and I have not forgotten about this workout!",1342483200,,1028,4.089108910891089
1423930,5,B00005BIG6,"I hate working out, I was pretty over weight, out of shape and had to do something! I tried a yoga workout for begginers with this same person and really stuck to it. I lost a few pounds and was ready to try something a bit more challenging. I was a little worried I wouldnt stick to this one, but to my surprise I love it!! The workout it slow enough that you can hang in there, challenging enough to get a good little workout, and there are different workouts so if one day your feeling a bit unmotivated you can still work out, and if you are feeling like you want to step it up a bit, you can do that too. I have been doing this for 3 weeks and still love it and my husband has commented on the changes, so it feels great. All in all I say YES get this DVD!! Now if your a hard core Pilates person, this might be a bit to slow, but if your the average person and your tired of looking in the mirror and seeing dimples and really hate running or the average 50 reps of everything until your thighs catch fire workout...then this will work  for you!! It leaves you feeling great! Worth every penny!!",1322697600,6,1101,4.0504587155963305
1423940,5,B00005BIG6,"I've been doing the exercises on this DVD since 2001 and I give it the five stars.  Nothing else can tone my abs, butt and abs like this DVD.
Jennifer Kries is the real deal.
I always get complimented on my figure and this is my best kept secret.  :)
I do about an hour of this 3 or 4 times a week.",1303862400,2,298,3.7142857142857144

1423942,5,B00005BIG6,"I really like this DVD.  The workout is very challenging but low impact and it works.  I feel stronger and it really seems to have helped my posture, helped me to lose some weight, and helped keep my lower back and abdomen strong.  And every time I do either of the two workouts on this DVD I feel great afterwards. As for the instrutor, Jennifer Kries is great.  She explains the exercises well and keeps a steady pace throughout.  Her delivery is encouraging and not annoying.  It also seems that she enjoys what she is doing which helps make it easier for the student.  She is also really great to watch.",1299974400,,607,4.414414414414415
1423943,5,B00005BIG6,"A friend of mine who studied dance recommended Jennifer Kries.  I love her style, and you get a great at-home workout.  I highly recommend!",1294272000,,139,4.75
1423944,5,B00005BIG6,"This is a great workout.  It is longer but, if time is an issue, do one part one day and other parts thereafter.  Well worth it!",1259798400,,128,3.8846153846153846
1423945,5,B00005BIG6,"Jennifer Kries is the real deal.  What you will get from her program is  instruction from a skilled professional, slow detailed guidience to prevent injuries and reliable results.  What you won't get is an instructor with a squeaky voice, distractions from a terrible sound track or a bouncy 'cheerleading' routine. In other words, if you're an impatient twenty-something with ADD look elsewhere.
This particular video appears to be out of print.  As luck would have it, I was able to locate a used DVD to replace my worn out copy.  Life is good!",1247788800,,546,4.827956989247312
1423946,5,B00005BIG6,"This product was excellent.  I became a fan of this instructor a few years ago when I was having lower back problems.  After a few weeks of doing her pilates routines, my back problems went away and I felt stronger and healthier than I had in a long time.  So far this dvd is my favorite of all the Method Pilates videos.  She explains each move well and gives good pointers and reminders throughout to ensure you are getting the most from each move and doing them safely.",1239321600,,472,4.329545454545454
1423947,3,B00005BIG6,"Though it's good to have instruction on proper form, she does this throughout making it annoying after you've done it several times.  It also wastes valuable work out time.  It would be great if she included a routine straight through without the instruction so that once you've got the form, you can just do the routine.",1235088000,2,321,4.714285714285714
1423948,1,B00005BIG6,"This video is very old and the flow of it is lousy. I did not like this video at all, but I gave it to a friend who has no pilates experience and she liked it.",1228089600,3,159,3.4444444444444446
1423949,5,B00005BIG6,"I had never tried Pilates before I bought this DVD, but I was really impressed.  Normally I stick with yoga, which I found too gentle in the long term to get in shape, but The Method really works all your muscles.  Every time I do the exercises I notice it is harder and easier in different ways, and I respond differently every time.  Unfortunately I didn't realize until recently there was a second exercise on the DVD (due to a poor DVD remote), and it makes an already cheap tape even more impressive.  I definitely recommend it, and if you keep with it for any length of time you *will* notice a difference.",1227398400,,612,4.389380530973451
1423960,5,B00005BIG6,"This is a very basic and unique workout where Pilates is combined with Yoga.  Jennifer Kries is pleasant to listen to and look at. She is properly dressed and professional which works for both sexes as it's about exercise without distraction due to improper dress.  She explains the moves beautifully so anyone can do them. She encourages any skill level so you can go only as far as you can. I am amazed at how flexible I've become after only a few weeks.  I am 57 years old and can bend down and touch my nose to my knees fairly comfortably now.  I don't recommend it for weight loss but for strength building, toning and flexibility. If you're looking for weight loss, you need to find an aerobic workout that fits with your physical capabilities and use it along with this video.",1227312000,2,783,4.492957746478873

1423962,1,B00005BIG6,"I bought this video to get me into Pilates. Bad idea. The instructor is so monotone and boring, it puts me to sleep. Also, if you aren't already in good shape, the moves are incredibly hard. This will be a video that will sit on my shelf.",1224806400,2,238,4.085106382978723
1423963,5,B00005BIG6,"I taught Pilates professionally for five years.  One of the things that really frustrated me and my students was the number of videos/workouts that were marketed as being Pilates, but weren't Pilates workouts at all.

There are lots of Pilates videos out there:  a lot of them don't teach much Pilates, though.  This is real Pilates Matwork;  more importantly, the exercises are taught in the right order.

The order really matters--without the order, your back isn't as safe:  Joseph Pilates made a point of following spinal flexion, meaning you curl forward, with spinal extension, meaning you arch your back.  Following flexion with extension theoretically means that the material in the discs in your spine is pushed out of place and then back again, by moving the spine itself forward and back.

Also, much of the rest of the Matwork stretches the muscles you will use in the next exercise, again, so you don't get hurt.  Doing Pilates exercises by themselves in a vacuum is nowhere near as safe as doing them in the order that they were traditionally taught.

O.k., off the soapbox:  this is the real thing;  don't waste your money on something else.",1222732800,6,1156,4.866666666666666
1423964,5,B00005BIG6,"I have been doing pilates for 5 years and this is a good DVD for beginners. Jennifer is great at explaining the basics and the reason's behind them. Her unitard is a bit much, but I guess it just shows the DVD's age....haha. However, it does prove the fact that good pilates tapes/DVD's do not expire. In the past 3 years pilates has become more 'trendy' but the philosophy of Joseph Pilates remains in tact no matter what year the tape. If you are just familiarizing yourself with pilates, you will enjoy this workout.",1221004800,2,519,4.531914893617022

1423966,4,B00005BIG6,"This pilates workout is a good one.  I have numerous pilates dvds and I found this to be one of the better ones.  However, the ultimate pilates dvd is the Rael Method.  If you can only buy one, look for Rael 27. It is better paced, more challenging, and techniques are more thoroughly explained.  Rael also gives you options for more advanced workouts.  Method Pilates is good, but Rael is even better.",1196553600,,402,4.527777777777778
1423967,2,B00005BIG6,I expected an advanced dvd on pilates methods.  The exercises are in the intermediate stage and there really aren't many exercises at all.  The workout was much shorter than what I expected.,1189209600,,190,4.90625
1423968,5,B00005BIG6,"First, I would like to address the reviewer who wrote that this program was ""misleading"" and ""not Pilates."" Please do not heed her words. The truth is, in fact, that the first workout on the DVD is a comprehensive classical Pilates program. The differences between the Method rendition and Pilates are negligible, and include such few trivialities as flexing the feet instead of leaving them relaxed and putting the hands between the knee and calf instead of atop the knees during the single leg stretch.  If you know the Pilates way versus the Method, you can easily amend your movements as I do. Second, I would like to remind or elucidate users that Pilates is a mind/body exercise, so the absence of music during the video (as another reviewer complains) is perfectly true to form. A Pilates student should be concentrating on breath, flow of movement, and the core but never Celine Dion.  Third, if you can't feel it, you're either a Pilates maven or, more likely, not doing the exercises correctly. Doing the exercises correctly is initially not the most important thing. Pilates must be absorbed; connecting the mind and body is the ultimate goal, and it takes time to arrive there. You may need to memorize the flow of movement before you can ever accurately use your core to execute the exercises.  Also, just because your body becomes used to the exercises doesn't mean they are not still working for you.  A Pilates body takes basic maintenance, and flexibility and The mind body connection will always increase as you repeat the exercises.

There are many Pilates exercises that exist outside this video, but the exercises Jennifer Kries performs are the core exercises of Pilates and should be done whether you do additional ones or not. This DVD is a great Piltates guide, and while not advanced, leaves plenty of time for personal adjustments.  As a long time Pilates fan and a third generation Joseph Piliates disciple, I cannot recommend this product enough.  I use it in often and add in exercises where necessary. For example, in the time Miss Kries teaches roll up, I do both this exercise and advanced roll over, and then in proper time move with her into leg circles.

This video is absolutely excellent and true to form where so many other DVDs are not (it's hard to find a DVD that even does the core!).  Enjoy.  Your pennies and your time will be worth it.",1171324800,11,2381,4.757281553398058
1423969,5,B00005BIG6,Wow! I really love this pilates DVD. it's hard at first but the more you do it the more results you see and you are able to do it. I really like it.,1168300800,4,148,3.515151515151515
1423980,5,B00005BIG6,"I have been doing Jennifer Kries Pilates for years and just updated to the DVD's. Her workouts really do tone every muscle of your body. She encourages you to stretch to your limit, but without overdoing it. The routines include a variety of different exercises, so you don't get bored.

I would recommend this series to both beginners and people more advanced in Pilates and yoga.",1163462400,3,381,4.7727272727272725
1423981,5,B00005BIG6,"As a relative beginner to pilates (less than 1 year), this is a great instructional DVD.  Jennifer Kries is clear and provides cautions and alternatives if you can't do the whole exercise as originally demonstrated.  She tells you what to do, then why it's done, and then what to be careful not to do (so you don't hurt yourself).  The only complaint I have about this DVD is that none of the segments have times shown in the packaging or on the DVD menu so you have to figure out for yourself, how long the routines are and whether you have time for the whole thing.  The toning section is 60 min total (including 15 minute warmup).  The sculpting section is 45 total (including 10 warmup).  The sculpting section ends with about 5-10 minutes of ballet type moves.  The toning warmup is a short version of the beginning of the regular toning workout.  Jennifer Kries' fitness and flexibility is something to aspire to but she never makes you feel inadequate if you can't do it.  She's very encouraging.  You will definitely get your powerhouse in shape if you do this workout regularly....it will happen in weeks, not months.",1141776000,12,1126,4.641414141414141
1423982,5,B00005BIG6,"I've been doing Yoga for the past 9 years every day and in the last few months have been adding Pilates in daily before my Yoga practice. Since getting into Pilates I've collected a good number of DVD's and VHS's as well as the Alycea Ungaro book ""Pilates, Body in Motion"".

 I was actually given this DVD by Jennifer Kries as a gift from my wife. I only work with the ""Precision Toning"" part of the program  (not the ""Sculpting"" section) because I get all the strength work I need from Power Vinyasa Yoga, but that section alone is enough to make this a praiseworthy addition to my library.

  I find Ms. Kries to be an excellent instructor who gives precise, easy to understand instruction and does a beautiful job demonstrating the exercises. Though she is very advanced and super flexible she shows how to modify all the exercises to make them safe and doable. I find her to have a friendly and encouraging demeanor which makes it a pleasure to do the practice.

 A key thing for me with any Pilates or Yoga program is how it is paced. I really love the ""tempo"" of this program, you never feel rushed yet there is a nice momentum throughout the DVD. That can often be a hard line to walk and she does it to perfection.

 If one is new to Pilates or short on time you can do the essentials practice, but if you are more advanced you can move into the full routine. Basically it's the Pilates Intermediate series but it has an extensive side lying series which really puts me through my paces (actually it has me ""begging for mercy"" :)).

 If you don't have time to do the full program the DVD has excellent chaptering so you can just do the series that you want to focus on at any given time.

 I'm very impressed with this program and would highly recommend it!

 If you've never done any Pilates before you may want to start with Stott Pilates Basics, it's a very thorough program that has detailed instruction which I find to be essentials to learning Pilates as you can strain yourself if you don't approach it properly.",1139875200,22,2027,4.408602150537634
1423983,5,B00005BIG6,"This is the very first pilates dvd i ever bought, not to mention the first dvd workout video i have ever even used! needless to say, i didn't know what i was getting in to. i love the way jennifer interects wth you. i also like that there is no music playing, so you can add yours if you want. i like how it feels like a personal training session with jennifer. she seems really sweet and nice, and she talks very calmly. like i said, i am a beginner, and i just got done having my first baby about 6 months ago, so i am way out of shape. this video, however, has really been great for me. its not too hard or too easy. every day i can really feel good after i work out. This is a great DVD to buy, and even if you don't buy this one, make sure you buy one with jennifer kries. shes fantastic!",1136246400,12,793,3.9012345679012346
1423984,5,B00005BIG6,"I had been a certified  fitness instructor for nearly 20 years, I had taught everything from step aerobics,low impact, aqua, toning, sculpting, personal training on all variations of gym equipment and free weights.

I had never learned anything about Pilates and Yoga.

I injured my quad years ago and had to stop teaching. I've been through rehabilitation, nothing helped. I was dealing with constant pain. My work outs were limited to the eliptical machine and trying to work my lower body was excruciating. I had lost considerable amounts of fitness and strength.

I saw the info mercial for another Pilates system that intriqued me. I wanted to learn Pilates and hoped it would allow me to continue to work out without aggrevating my injury.

The infomercial discs, while great, were  just too 'fast paced' for a novice. I found the Precision Toning DVD  and began with  the Toning Essentials portion. This portion, really instructs on Pilates basics. Jennifer Kries, is a wonderful,straight- forward instructor. I like the non-fussiness of this dvd. I like that it's not 'dated' looking, even though it's several years old. I had no idea. If you've ever worked out to 80's videos, they feel dated in the music and production and styles.  I find that distracting.

I stayed with Toning Essentials for weeks but gradually moved on to the Precision Toning chapters. This workout is very concentrated and it's not easy. Jennifer keeps you focused on your form and keeps a pace that allows you to concentrate to make each rep count.

I am rotating into my workouts now, the  Jennifer Kries Targeted Toning DVD workouts, but am remaining loyal to this DVD as my core workout. I have seen vast improvement in my injury. I own other popular pilates burn type programs and those use a bit more speed in the workout. I actually prefer doing the pilates at the pace Jennifer teaches.

Perhaps as I  become more seasoned, I'll step up the pace.

Maybe not, though. I'm seeing great results in my body shape, fitness level and flexibility is better than it has been in my entire career in fitness.

My husband is also using it with great results. He had also been a gym rat for 20 years, yet he has ZERO flexibility. This dvd really challanges different fitness levels. Day by day, he is seeing excellent improvements in his flexibility and core strength.

There is another section of the DVD called Precision Sculpting which uses light weights. It's excellent and again, divided into chapters so it's easy to plan your workouts, further your fitness goals with this DVD.

This dvd will give you results if you are interested in Pilates,  you will not be dissappointed. I have bought this dvd for my parents and they also love it.",1132876800,14,2722,4.802575107296137
1423985,4,B00005BIG6,"First I love Jennifer. She presents the program with the right mixture between rightoutness, precision (the name of the game!) AND smiles. I have done the toning section (the last part of the 3 chapters)over and over and over and find it- as a well trained pilates practitioner both on the reformer and mat, very educative and focusing on essential information.no nonsense here - this is if you really wanna learn the real thing: learning about isolation and core stabilisation and learn to move your physical body coming from the subtle. AND thanks heaven -- NO esoteric sleeping pill music while working out - only jennifer's voice, which i personally adore because first i find music distracting and after the 50th repetition simply annoying. and if you really need music to ""tune in"" :) - you still may play your own.

So if it is THAT good, why only 4 stars? Well, the setting is a bit old-fashioned, personally i'd like it to be more faster paced and i prefer the toning section to the sculpting which I only did a few times. the sculpting is in itself very ""classical joseph pilates"" as well, educative etc etc.. but as i work a lot on the reformer do personally no need (and not like that much) sculpting with weights. HOWEVER I can only recommend this DVD if you wanna do pilates the precise way and get serious about it!",1125619200,10,1330,4.588235294117647
1423986,1,B00005BIG6,"I ordered this DVD because I am interested in the Pilates method. However, when it arrived I noticed that the small print on the back said that this is not the Pilates method, that it is not recognised or approved by the Pilates Guild and that references to the word Pilates are for discriptive purposes only. In fact, the DVD contains a combination of exercises from various disciplines.

In addition to that, the main focus of the real Pilates method is improving posture, core stability and flexibility of the spine, whereas this DVD is only about 'toning and sculpting'.",1123200000,7,574,4.797979797979798
1423987,5,B00005BIG6,"This is a great, effective yet easy to follow workout.  The instructor can get a little annoying at times, but not too bad.  I originally had the VHS version, but recently switched to the DVD.  The DVD version has an additional sculpting workout which I don't care much for.  The Toning section starts off with an easy to start 15 min workout.  If you skip over to the ""Abs"" chapter, it will take you to a longer 45min workout which I love. (the VHS version however reads it should only be a 30min workout, but it's not!  Don't be fooled!).  The 45 min toning routine is both relaxing and challenging, but not too hard for beginners.  It will make you sick how flexible the instructor's legs are (she stretches them quite frequently up over her head!), but she manages to give good encouraging guidance throughout the exercises.",1121904000,8,828,4.585034013605442

when i started doing this precision workout i got a jump start, the exercises are easy to follow and she demonstrates them in a nice pace. the results did not wait, my abs are strong and defined and i started loosing inches (wich i needed). i look taller and more sculpted, and get complements for my great posture. in addition, I HAVE NO MORE BACK AND SHOULDER PAIN :)- i would recomend this for people with some experience in pilates, in combination to  ana brett and ravi singh ""WARRIOR WORKOUT"". these two workouts together will do wonders for your back, posture, mental focus, and your body!",1117497600,11,793,4.690647482014389

It kicks my butt! The instructor is down-to-earth, but she's a bit of a tease (in a good way). I mean, it will sound like you're almost finished, and then there's one more set. Or there's another whole group of exercises. And at the very end, the (actual) teasers are KILLERS, but in a very good way. I only play the first part of this DVD. The second part, toning, is good, but I prefer a non-Pilates approach to weights, so I generally use something else. No doubt about it, the first workout alone is worth twice the price of the DVD!",1111104000,16,714,4.181159420289855

I have worked out moderately all my life, but i felt sooo pleasantly challenged doing this pilates dvd. She really pays attention to safe and right positions and breathing.

some of the excercises were a bit hard since i am not too flexible and i skipped the beginners pilates all together, but after a week, i was so into it...and still am.

She courages you through each series and you just won't be able to cheat and push STOP button on your DVD player.

Personally, the routine is too slow for me and the instructor talks too much. I think that if she just went from one move to the other with out talking the workout would give a better payoff. By the time she started the next move...I was already 10 reps in. Also... it did not seem like there was enough repitition of the good moves and too many unnecessary moves.",1106784000,3,601,4.4363636363636365

She is also very mellow to the point where I could have fallen asleep rather than worked out. Gave up on this after one try.

I heard a lot of good things about Winsor Pilates so I decided to try that out. I liked how Mari goes though the steps with you, her upbeat teaching style, and overall I really enjoy this DVD a lot more than the Jennifer Kries Method Pilates. Definitely much better for beginners!",1106697600,8,570,4.377358490566038

1423995,5,B00005BIG6,"This is the best Pilates DVD I've ever owned. I believe Pilates is best taught by a dancer because many of the moves are taken from ballet (and Yoga). Jennifer has been dancing ballet since the age of 3 and has incredible flexibility. This flexibility helps teach you Pilates properly.

Jennifer is a beautiful skilled instructor with perfect body line and it is a good thing to have such an instructor as a model role. I even bought her book Pilates Plus Method and it goes well perfect with this DVD as most of her workouts are in the book explaining the detail and what you should be feeling or what you should be imagning to attain each pose. I am so glad I bought both of them. Her instruction is precise, encouraging, friendly, yet professional. I saw Mari Winsor's instructions and I heard she is the sought-after instructor in Hollywood, but quite honestly she neither has ncie figure or looks like Jennifer. If I were the famous actress, then I wouldn't care what the instructor looked like but as a normal person with many choices around, I would definitely choose an instructor who has both skills and model figure.

AT FIRST, I didn't find the workout challenging but there a few things I wasn't doing to maximize my results. (i.e. keeping heels off the floor when in sit-up positions-this enagages the quads continuously). Those of you that say it is not challenging are not performing the exercises correctly or not fully engaging the muscles(which takes a lot of mental concentration).
