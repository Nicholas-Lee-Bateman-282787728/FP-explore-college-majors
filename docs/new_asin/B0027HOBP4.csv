3867648,1,B0027HOBP4,"This is one of those movies where the DVD cover art deserves a better movie. Fantasy is a difficult genre, because it takes some budget to pay for the costumes and special effects. BUt with a good script a good director can make a good fantasy movie on a low budget. Unfortunately, ""Dragon Hunter"" doesn't have a good script and obviously wasn't made by a good director (the same person who wrote the script). The plot is totally uninteresting and moves at a snail's pace. The cast don't help either; I don't expect Oscar-worthy performances in low budget movies but this movie has some of the most wooden dialogue and acting I've ever seen (and I've seen a lot of bad movies). It's slightly amusing to watch for about two minutes but the movie goes on for 90 very slow, very boring minutes. ""Dragon Hunter"" isn't worth spending money or even time on. I'm sure they had a good time making it but I didn't have a good time watching it.",1283644800,,934,4.4678362573099415
3867649,1,B0027HOBP4,Really guys how can you say anything good about this film!? I'm pretty sure it was filmed in my neighbor's backyard on and iphone. Wow....,1278028800,,138,4.56
3867650,3,B0027HOBP4,"The point of a fantasy movie is to help ferry thoughts to a land of your making. The movie provides the setting, perhaps a few plot points and off you go. Great fantasy (or big budget bad ones) does all the heavy lifting, pure escapism through giant set pieces and cgi. No real effort on your part is required: just sit back and stare forward. Bad ones (or low budget ones) rely on your imagination to help mask their shortcomings, financial or otherwise. If you can agree to that simple compact, you will enjoy Dragon Hunter.

Dragon Hunter is not a great movie. It's also obvious from the start that it didn't have much of a budget, either. But from the poorly dressed orcs, to the corny dialog and shaky battles sequences, fantasy does live here. Is it Lord of The Rings? Certainly not. Knights of Bloodsteel? Not even. But it is an effort worth your time, if what you cherish is the opportunity to escape to a world of sword and sorcery.

Three stars are given here for two reasons: I admire every attempt at fantasy, good or bad, in a market that has long since abandoned the genre for anything less than ""Greatest/Most Beloved Children's Book/Fantasy Story Ever Told"". Second, my imagination is powerful, an organ unto itself, its hunger insatiable. Anything that feeds it, is fed to it. Dragon Hunter did just that, now I seek nourishment elsewhere.

3867651,1,B0027HOBP4,"Negatives:
(1.) Assumed, but never mentioned, that the story takes place in a middle, or older, ages time period. However, the problem lies in their use of 20th century props like the shaped arrow heads; high tensile steel swords; makeup, lipstick (pink undertone was the best) and polyester clothing for the female lead; nicely groomed hair styles and perfect collegiate English for all. Shows a lack of authenticity, monetary investment and writers taking some time to do some basic period research. Clothing, which was the overwhelming main prop for the movie, had a cheap high school stage quality to it.
(2.) To save production money the sound was echo ridden and out of sync and a shaky camera was used to represent action. Dragon looked like my Gecko with some added CG effects. Gecko dragon appears in the movie for about 2 minutes towards the very end.
(3.) Poor directorial consistency from scene to scene such as in the beginning a lead actor with a quiver of arrows on his back is carrying a wounded person and the next moment, carrying the same person, no longer has the arrows. Again, in the beginning, lead actors are in a small wood and thatch hut in a small village while a dragon is outside burning down the village and killing everyone yet the people inside hear nothing UNTIL they open their door. Worst of all was that over 50% of the movie consists of boring two person dialogues and closeups of plants.
(4.) Stereotypes:  First was the single sexy female lead amongst a dozen males and second was the African-American represented as big, tattooed, and can't speak (perhaps suggesting intelligence).

Positive:
Candidate for top ten worst movies of this decade.

Suggestion:
Watch Dragonheart again instead.",1257206400,,1729,4.8941979522184305
3867652,1,B0027HOBP4,This is by far the worse movie I have ever seen.  I want the 2 hours I wasted watching this movie repaid to me.,1255564800,,111,3.625
3867653,3,B0027HOBP4,"I actually did some work on this film, I was glad to see it actually make it to DVD, Yes it's corny and the acting is well... ok lets say Isaac (Pirates of the Caribean) did a great job of growling and finally saying a word or two, Kelly Seales (The Ring) was Hot, but the two most famous actors were not the main characters. Interesting... Anyway I thought the film was done as well as can be expected for the budget was done on. In todays world of 200 Million + productions this one was created for pennies in comparison.",1251331200,4,523,4.188118811881188
3867654,1,B0027HOBP4,"I hated to even give it one star, it deserved none. We rented Dragon Hunter two days ago. The title and description were promising, however, once we pushed ""start"" we were in for a great disappointment.  Even my dragon-loving tween was disgusted. A total waste of money-I am glad I rented and didn't buy. Shaky camera, horrible sound, no closed caption, poor quality overall. Not to mention a horrible storyline and a pitiful several-seconds shot of a terrible dragon-like creature reminiscent of 1960-era special effects. Bad, bad, bad.",1251244800,2,537,5.1022727272727275
3867655,3,B0027HOBP4,"I love a really good fantasy film. Movies like this are living dreams when they are done well, or even half well. Well, this movie won it's third star because of the parts it did well. It would be very easy at this point to start a string of nasty, snide, clever remarks chopping this film to shreds because they didn't have a bazillion dollars to work with. I find no joy in cruel humor. So, let's get the weak points out of the way. The locations were nondescript to the point that it could have been shot almost anywhere, or nowhere. The camera work is sadly marred by hand held deliberate jiggles that do not end when the sword fights end. For a film entitled Dragon Hunter, we spent a lot of time talking about Orks, and fighting Orks. Orks? Yup. Ugly armor, hidden faces, cheep action. There is a remarkably small, cute red head with pointed ears who shoots arrows with supernatural skill. She is one of the best performers in the cast, obviously not a child. And nobody dares call her a fairy.
I also enjoyed the fact that there is no trash talk or nudity to keep this from younger viewers. Neither is there the grand spectacle of huge stone cities or enormous caves that are the grand settings for these magical stories. No big armies. No jagged mountains. This lack of eye candy does hurt the movie.
It is very talky and the younger viewers might loose interest.
But this is a film called Dragon Hunter and finally our ren-fair cast does find the beast!
Take this little drama at face value and the pay off is a terrific dragon. Best of all, this was written and designed to be the first of a series. The more money they make, the more they will have to make better movies with.
We can hope!
One final note. Made in the USA! Totally non-Hollywood. I am liking this one better all the time.
  Enjoy!",1250640000,5,1807,4.359050445103858
3867656,1,B0027HOBP4,"But in the end - nothing is as I had hoped. Kids come into the store every week wanting a good live action dragon movie so I order all of them knowing there has to be a hit hidden somewhere...not it.

The cover art and storyline should be disregarded as the title should have been something like ""Travelers and Talkers"" or ""The Merry Gypsies"" or anything more relevant to the plot. Main question regarding dragon time: the first real critter shows up at the 74 minute mark for a couple seconds, then again for the final battle at the 86 mark for less than a minute. He is SciFi Channel quality dragon via the stop motion animation. Total screen time is less than 70 seconds. That leaves the story and acting. Both were pretty bad, but if you go into it knowing there are only a few fight scenes with ""orcs"" and one dragon (all while the camera shakes violently) then you might get something out of their travels and conversations. The best part was watching Isaac Singleton (Pirates Caribbean fame) play the strongest warrior role (but his fate can be seen on the back cover art).

No supplements, the picture quality was good, and the sound was not mixed properly through most of the film. Skipper.",1248480000,10,1199,4.52073732718894

8354777,1,B0027HOBP4,"The dragon on the cover as well as the use of the word DRAGON should have been banned.  It only appeared once at the very beginning and actually for 20seconds at the end.  This was a super low budget below High School drama level movie.  For fights they shook the camera and you only saw  blurred images. The story was worse than the actors and the 4' woman warrior/love interest teenybopper with the ""padded outfit"" to add ""interest?"" and the build of a 8 year old was really bad.  Forgive me this analogy, but I wonder if she was included for the pedophiles market, because she did nothing and there was NO STORY & NO ACTION & NO ACTORS, just stupid talking and slow walking in what may have been someone's backyard and maybe a city park for the shots with the trees.  Kmart sheets for tents must have doubled the cost of the movie. No one carried a bow till they appeared to want to use it but never did...except in the opening shot. I tossed this DVD after paying for it.  IT HAD NO REDEAMING QUALITIES...NONE!!! This was the worst video I have ever ever watched/purchased.",1291075200,,1077,4.409090909090909
