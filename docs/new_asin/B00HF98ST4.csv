8632278,4,B00HF98ST4,The first two episodes on this dvd are great but sadly the last one doesn't even touch on the Vikings witch is sad honestly,1422316800,,123,4.166666666666667
8632279,5,B00HF98ST4,"This was a very informative documentary trilogy.  There was a lot of up-to-date information included in the three separate documentaries, and all the researchers and historians who made appearances knew their subjects extremely well.",1405900800,4,233,5.852941176470588
8632280,1,B00HF98ST4,"This DVD contains 3 History Channel documentaries, none of which focus on the history of Viking conquest of Europe.  The documentaries are very light fare focusing on excursions to North America and a look inside a viking settlement in Dublin.",1404864000,6,243,5.075
8632281,3,B00HF98ST4,"This DVD set is made up of documentaries of variable relevance.  The documentaries ""Vikings: The Voyage to America"" and ""Leif Ericson: Voyages of a Viking"" are worth watching.  Superb photography, reconstitutions, interviews with experts, and adventurer Josh Bernstein make these two documentaries a useful learning experience.  In contrast, ""Viking Underground"" looks and feels like a filler.  This documentary covers several periods that have nothing or little to do with the Viking era.",1399766400,11,489,5.75
