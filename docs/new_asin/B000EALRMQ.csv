8107955,3,B000EALRMQ,"Two dudes keep finding dead clan leaders who have been killed by the Shaolin Palm style.  One of the dudes has a lady-friend who has been accused of involvement.  The dudes want her name cleared so they go to the Shaolin temple to ask some questions and are met with an ambivalent mix of hospitality and aggression.  They leave without solving anything, and later the girl manages to witness one of the attacks.  The dudes take her back to the temple to identify the culprits, but the abbot will not allow them to see all of the monks' faces without first passing a few tests, the likes of which have yet to be passed... by anyone.  Seems fair.

This should be a 4-star film.  The fights are early wire-fu and are quite good.  The movie really is a lot of fun.  It's just that the plot is so absurd at times.  The presentation doesn't help either.  It is not widescreened or remastered and has large Korean subtitles plastered over the picture.  I can live with all of those things, but it does detract from the overall enjoyment.

I'm just picky, I guess.  If you want to see a threadbare plot that propels some great, semi-supernatural kung-fu, then you really should check this out.  If a better copy of this was to surface, I would likely buy it again.

8107956,5,B000EALRMQ,"I'm not going to repeat comments about the version, all I want to say is that this movie blew me away! This is my favorite movie of the genera, which I've seen maybe 20 of (excluding BL, JC, & JL).

When you turn this on, get ready, because there's none of the waiting for good parts crap we're all so used to, this will suck you in! The movie is driven by the plot, great atmosphere, awesome characters, and every actor nails his role. And there's nothing unnecessary, no moments where you're just waiting for the movie to go somewhere, or wondering what you're looking at!  But besides being a great movie, the action is also great, with one really enjoyable moment of cheese (the spear is out of control). Wonderful variety of weapons. Take a moment to appreciate how much actual fighting choreography there is with the 3 section staff. Loads of it. Those are a beast to control (I'd know), and while showcasing forms can be nice, this went for the nitty gritty-- it feels like they're fighting!

If you're into the genera, you can't miss this one.",1185235200,,1051,4.521052631578947

8107959,5,B000EALRMQ,"The entire movie contains 40 minutes of action.  I gaurantee that this movie will keep you on the tips of your toes.  There is a large amount of wire-work in this film as compared to other class gung fu movies.  No training sequences were involved.  This movie is really underrated.  If you are new to the shaw brothers films, this is a good movie to start off with.",1162425600,,366,4.323529411764706
