8223717,3,B000WM84XQ,"Have you ever ordered a DVD of your favorite band in concert, only to find that most of the footage is audience shots, so you wind up spending most of your time watching other people enjoying the show, instead of getting to see and enjoy the show yourself?  That's kind of what this is like.  There are plenty of talking heads, many I haven't heard of (but I presume they're notable Canadian personalities), talking about Bob and Doug and how great they are.  Who cares what these people think?  That's not why I bought this disc.  I want to see Bob and Doug!  I want to see for MYSELF how great they are!

Old Great White North segments from SCTV are interspersed between talking head soundbites, but there's no way to directly access them, you have to fast-forward through the talking heads.  Some Great White North segments are in a ""Bonus Materials"" section, including segments you already fast-forwarded through the talking heads to see in the main section.  Commercials Bob and Doug did for various Canadian companies are also included.  Interesting, and fun to have, but they're still commercials.  More Great White North bits from SCTV, that's what I want.

You're obviously enough of a Bob and Doug McKenzie fan to read the reviews for this DVD in the first place.  Unfortunately, I can only recommend this for the very hardcore Bob and Doug fan, especially if the only way to get this DVD is by paying ""collector's prices.""  Even so - even if you're the hardest of the hardcore - if you're so hardcore that your favorite donuts are raised chocolate in the evening and pineapple overnight because that's what Bob McKenzie likes - I'd only recommend taking a gamble on this DVD if you can get it really really cheap.",1484092800,4,1724,4.6655629139072845
8223718,5,B000WM84XQ,"I absolutely love this!! Anything Bob and Doug. Now, if I could only find the toques they wear & jackets. This is a must buy for any Bob and Doug fan.",1477958400,,150,3.870967741935484
8223719,4,B000WM84XQ,Fun tribute and reminder of the humor and fun of the SCTV days...,1413158400,,65,4.076923076923077
8223720,3,B000WM84XQ,"I got this for my wife, and it's mildly amusing. Lots of stuck together stuff and some random new material, nothing as good as the original bits. Though it's fun to see crowd shots and other interesting memories of the early 80s when Bob and Doug were all the rage. This looks like it was mostly about paying the bills, but still, a little new Bob and Doug goes a long way for longtime fans.",1338940800,,391,4.226666666666667
8223721,4,B000WM84XQ,I thought the little skits and things would all be great....and some of them were but some didn't hit the mark.  It attracted my kids though and I saw them enjoying it.  And kids now scoff at anything from 'back in the olden days',1317686400,2,230,4.204545454545454
8223722,2,B000WM84XQ,"I was interested in rediscovering my Canadian buddies after all these years. The DVD is a good documentary about Bob and Doug. Though you can edit the Paul Shaffer bits from it. With the Olympics in Canada their revival wasn't unexpected, but the 2007 version of the two just wasn't the same. I guess somethings change after 24 years. They're still good friends of mine. ""Beauty, eh!!!",1270339200,4,385,4.7611940298507465
8223723,5,B000WM84XQ,"If you grew up with Bob and Doug, this is a must have. I didn't really get into the rest of SCTV, but these guys are hilarious. This disc has lots of their sketches from the early 80s, as well as new ones. You will also learn everything there is to know about these guys and the hosermania they created in the 80s. A number of current celebrities that were influenced by Bob and Doug are interviewed. A great tribute and trip down memory lane. Still funny after all these years.",1262736000,6,478,4.263736263736264
