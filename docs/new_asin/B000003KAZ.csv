7903146,5,B000003KAZ,"In ""Blood Fever,"" Episode 57 of ""Star Trek: Voyager,"" Chakotay discovered signs of the Borg in the Delta Quadrant for the first time.  The next step that eventually leads to Seven of Nine comes in Episode 59, ""Unity"" (Written by Kenneth Biller, February 12, 1997).  Chakotay (Robert Beltran) is returning on a shuttle from a scouting mission when he picks up a Federation distress call from a nearby planet.  When the shuttle lands to investigate the ensign with Chaoktay is killed and he is injured when they are attacked by a group of humanoids.  A second group of humanoids, led by Riley Frazier (Lori Hallier), rescues him and explains that this planet is the home for members of various species who were kidnapped by aliens and left here.  While many are cooperating to survive, some are decidedly unfriendly.
Meanwhile, ""Voyager"" discovers a Borg vessel drifting in space with over a thousand dead Borg on it.  If there is one constant in the ""Star Trek"" universe it is that two unconnected plot lines come together sooner or later and that is indeed the case here, when we learn that Riley and the others were not just kidnapped by the Borg, but assimilated.  When their vessel was incapacitated five years earlier, some of Borg were able to come to their sense and tried to survive on the nearest planet, where their ""cooperative"" has replaced the Borg collective.
At this point, late in season 3, ""Unity"" ends up being an above average ""Voyager"" episode where Janeway's tendency to help others at the expense of her crew collides with the threat of the Borg.  However, from a history standpoint ""Unity"" is of some importance because even if Janeway knows little or nothing about how Locutus was turned back into Jean Luc-Picard, the example of Riley and the other former Borg is definitely going to be on her mind when ""Voyager"" encounters Seven of Nine and frees her from the collective.  Not a classic episode, but good enough for me to round up on the rating.",1066867200,,1971,4.756598240469208
