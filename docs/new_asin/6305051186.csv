I could hear a bit of Obi-Wan creeping into he Martin character, which is really just his British accent.

970303,3,6305051186,"Nightwatch is a suspense independent film that was probably very clever and artsy for the 90's, but after watching this film it just felt mediocre. Now with such star power as Ewan Mcgregor, Josh Brolin, Patricia Arquette and Nick Nolte, one would think the film had a strong draw in it's writing to bring together all these talented actors. But in actuality the film's characters aren't very interesting and the acting seems not guided very well for character development. The story plot is basic and has the mystery element going till about 30 minutes to the end, and the artistic shots are fun for a limited time then it just seems a bit much. It seems to me this film has a great concept for a short film or even a novel, where we can get more in depth about the characters and the story, but the film seems to fall short and remain ""not memorable"" for me at least. I'll give 3 out of 5 in my review but in reality, I give it 2 stars and I don't think I'll watch this movie again in my lifetime. But you be the judge, watch for yourself and decide if ""Nightwatch is something for you or not.",1431561600,,1095,4.294685990338165
970304,5,6305051186,"In this 1997 thriller remake of the 1994 original, the film opens with a young prostitute being stabbed to death in her apartment by her unseen client during what was supposed to be sex roleplay. After the opening credits, we're introduced to law school student, Martin Bells who gets a job as a night watchman at the local morgue. He's replacing an elderly man who's been the watchman there for years, knows the ins and outs of the morgue, and gives Martin a tour the building on his first night.

One night while on shift, the body of a murdered female is delivered to the morgue, showing that the killer removed her eyes. Martin also meets police inspector, Thomas Cray, who informs him of a killer in the area that's murdering prostitutes and takes their eyes out as his signature calling card. Initially, Martin makes nothing of it...... until the killer begins leaving behind strange, sadistic, necrophiliac clues that has detective Cray and others pointing the finger at Martin as the prime suspect--an accusation Mr. Bells has a difficult time trying to back up. Unless Martin can clear his name and find who's really responsible, everything he may just end up losing everything he has; his job, his girlfriend, and maybe even his life

Overall: Late night channel surfing is a wonderful thing when you come across an interesting movie to watch and Nightwatch just happened to be one I recently came across late one night on TV. The primary plot of the killer murdering women is quite typical but it's the spin the plot takes and turns into a sadistic, clever, and creepy thriller that really makes it worthwhile. While Nightwatch does have its fair share of blood, it's not as gory as many exaggerate it to be. Ewan McGregor stars as out main character in Martin Bells, while the adorably cute Patricia Arquette stars as his girlfriend. John C. Reilly, Nick Nolte, and Brad Dourif also offer some stellar performances in this film as well. Nightwatch is dark, at times intense, really creepy (especially during the last 30 minutes), and will have your full attention on the edge of your seat all the way throughout. It also takes a big plot twist nearing the end as they pull a switcheroo just when you thought you had everything figured out. I highly suggest putting Nightwatch on your to-watch list. It's a highly intense film and is best viewed after dark",1429833600,,2367,4.75669099756691

970497,4,6305051186,"I was surprised by this movie.  I thought it was a recent production, and I kept thinking, ""that guy looks a lot like a young Ewan McGregor.""  Well, in fact, it was a 1997 production, starring MacGregor, Nick Nolte, Patricia Arquette (before Medium) and Josh Brolin, which apparently made not a splash when it was released because I don't remember it in the theaters or on the shelves of any video rental store (remember those?)

This is a good cast that goes through their anointed roles of being variously framed, authoritative, stupidly wandering in to danger and a bad friend. For everyone other than Nolte, this is early in their career so they haven't developed the grooves of characterization that they would bring to their later roles.  Nolte, on the other hand, is thin and dissipated. It's kind of a lightweight role for him. His acting was fine but not energetic.

The storyline is full of creepiness because McGregor takes a job in a deserted morgue where he can study during his last semester of law school. Obviously, he has to regularly patrol the room with body parts and the room where cadavers are laid out.

And there is a serial killer with a thing for necrophilia running loose.

Although the killer is revealed midway in the movie, I have to give the writers credit for not making it fit the usual cliche of modern movies.  More than that I will not say.

If you are looking for something akin to a horror movie which will have jumping out of your seat, and a decent mystery, this is your movie.",1407628800,4,1517,4.588888888888889

970500,4,6305051186,"Creepy, suspenseful, but fairly formulaic whodunit murder-slasher flick. The fact that it's about a young law school student, decently played by Ewan McGregor, who moonlights as a night watchman in a morgue, giving the audience frequent views of the recently brought-in cadavers, some of whom are victims of an on-the-loose serial killer, adds a nice touch of scariness here. Generally good acting by just about everyone, similarly good cinematography, with a script to die for, npi. I first saw this film shortly after its release in 1997. I watch a lot of this sort: What really made NIGHTWATCH stand out to the point where I still remember it years later was the fine performance and script of one of the supporting characters, Brad Dourif as the unnamed ""Duty Doctor,"" who is darkly hilarious here. Sample script from the doctor: ""Can I offer you something?. . . . Have you ever spent any time with the 'Zine' family? Thorazine? Stellazine? Compazine? They're really very nice! They will make you sing hymns while you watch a baby fall under a train!""",1399593600,,1055,4.899441340782123

970570,4,6305051186,"Nightwatch is a pretty good suspense, however it shouldn't be classified as a horror because it's honestly not.  The only ""horror"" comes in how the main character (a night watchman) exaggerates his behavior pertaining to what he believes are dead people actually getting out of a morgue and walking around.

His behavior was total fear and uptight nervousness the entire time which is funny because it's exaggerated for one thing, but even better because whenever this other guy who also works at the morgue would make a surprise appearance due to an emergency call in, he would totally make fun of the night watchman as a result!

This is actually funny to me because you have a guy scared out of his mind over the possibility that dead people are getting out of bed and walking around, and then... due to the sarcastic nature of the other guy (who actually may be the owner of the morgue now that I think about it because of how confident and well-aware he was of the place) the watchman becomes not only scared, but confused as well, lol.

What is actually happening to the morgue is that someone (the bad guy) is setting up the night watchman and accusing him of a crime he didn't commit.  The bad guy isn't your ordinary ""Let's kill everyone!"" type of monster like in many other films.  Instead he's a ""How can I pin these unexplainable chain of horrific events (such as murdering some of the night watchman's friends and other mere acquaintances you will meet later on) on the innocent guy"" kind of suspense.

It's good though... bad acting aside!  Yup, the acting is terrible.  Plus there's portions of the storytelling in the beginning (such as a bar fight incident) that seems completely out of place and uninteresting but other than that, stick with this one folks, and you'll be rewarded with a unique kind of suspense.",1323129600,,1830,4.67601246105919
970571,1,6305051186,"Given the cast and obvious studio muscle behind this movie, I wasn't certain how it flew in under my radar. Now that I've seen it I wish it had stayed hidden. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.

Ewan McGregor  plays a student who gets a job as a night watchman in a morgue at a time when the area is beset by a serial killer. He becomes a suspect and must prove his innocence.

Instead of the usual Hollywood practice of remaking a good foreign movie they simply hired the director of the original Nightwatch, Ole Bornedal, to redirect it with an American cast. This is so terrible I grew more angry each minute it was on. None of the characters acts as they should given the circumstances they are in. Nothing progresses in a logical manner. I know this went through some degree of rewriting but I cannot believe the original was this non-sensical. For instance: When McGregor comes under the scrutiny of the detective, there are any number of things he can say to get himself off the hook. He somehow manages not to think of a single thing. The entire movie is littered with similar idiocies.

The director also tries to infuse scares when there really isn't anything to be afraid of. For instance: McGregor is a watchman in a building housing a morgue. He must go into the morgue itself each hour to ""clock in"" so his employers know he is, in fact, on site the entire night. He shields his eyes so he doesn't see the corpses as he walks the length of the room. When he leaves, and realizes he hasn't turned out the lights, ha cannot even bring himself to go back in long enough to do so. He merely opens the door enough to get his arm in to flip the light switch. Now why is he so afraid of a bunch of dead bodies? And how will he hold up having to the same thing every hour of every day he's on the job?

How all this got past the producers is beyond me. You have a great cast and crew and manage to leave all the brain cells in the meeting room. This movie is a shame. It stinks beyond the meaning of the word. Don't waste your time.",1292198400,3,2051,4.208651399491094
970572,2,6305051186,"This is the BluRay version of the pale Hollywood re-make of the original Danish movie by the same director.  That version was released by Anchor Bay but is now sadly out of print.  The Anchor Bay version is still available new and used by private sellers on Amazon.  Anyone who has seen the original movie would just laugh at this watered-down rehash.

The Danish movie starts off as a what-the-hell-student-needs money lark, moves to creepy-but-hilarious scares, and then goes for the jugular.  The attractive principals are unknowns in the U.S.  This puts the focus on the acting - which is very good - adding greatly to the plot.  The Hollywood re-make focuses on movie stars, which dilutes the viewer's identification with the main characters.  The script has been sanitized (i.e., scrubbed clean and dumbed-down)for mainstream American audiences.  The Danish version is an effective mix of light and dark humor, growing tension and sexual frankness.

If you like your movies mayonnaise, buy the Hollywood re-make.  If you don't, buy the original version.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nightwatch/dp/B00004Y6BM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nightwatch</a>",1263254400,,1195,5.810344827586207

970662,2,6305051186,"In Nightwatch, Ewan McGregor plays Martin, a law student who takes a job as a nightwatchman in the medical examiner's office.  He works from 8pm-4am and his only real task besides sitting behind a desk is to walk through the building once every hour and turn a series of keys to ensure that the's been there the whole time.  This includes one particularly spooky walk through the morgue.  Still Martin thinks the job will be easy money and a give him a chance to study.

What he doesn't factor in is that there's a killer on the loose who has been murdering young prostitutes and cutting out their eyes.  When their bodies start to turn up and he becomes a suspect, Martin has to try to find the killer himself and clear his name.

The first 30 to 45 minutes of this movie move pretty slowly and it takes awhile for the plot to take shape.  At first I wasn't sure if the movie was about the serial killer, about Martin, or about the morgue since all of them seemed important but none of them really stood out. It seems like the point of the beginning of the movie was to set up an aura of creepiness by showing images of the morgue and the dark exterior of the building without showing any scary moments or blood and gore.

 In fact, the best part of the whole movie is the last 20 minutes, though it took a lot of effort to get there. I wanted to turn this movie off several times because there was just too much going on without enough focus. I'd have expected a bit more with the names they have in the cast like McGregor, Nick Nolte, and Patricia Arquette.  In the end, the movie moves too fast to wrap up all the plot elements that were left open, and this detracts too much from the story.

970665,4,6305051186,"Okay, my hands are up right from the get go; maybe I'm biased about this film, but when I heard my two favourite actors; the always cooler-than-cool Ewan McGregor and the impossibly cute Patricia Arquette had starred in a film together, well I just had to see it, and boy am I glad I did.

'Nightwatch' tells a twisted, claustrophobic tale about a young and very wet-behind-the-ears nightwatchman Martin Bells (Ewan McGregor) taking over sentry duties at the local morgue where, as things first appear, his first enemy to confront and overcome is his overactive imagination. Stunning direction details this in one of the most tense and suspenseful sequences of sustained fear put to celluloid. It perfectly mirrors both Martin's unease and the audience's; he knows he shouldn't be scared, everyone in the building is dead - and WE know we shouldn't be scared, it's a film - but somehow, for both parties, the fear at the time seems VERY real, and sets the tone beautifully. A poignant moment highlighted in sound that was emphasised earlier in dialogue by the former watchman that introduces Martin to Security procedure 'Buy a radio, you'll be glad of it. Gonna be studying eh? BUY A RADIO! Trust me!'

Soon enough, 'Nightwatch' slams it's bloody cards on the table as all of a sudden, due to the very public news that a serial killer is most definitely on the loose with the morgue apprently the killer's latest 'favoured' hang out (co-incidence that it's around the time of Martin's employment?) naked mutilated corpses are on full view, blood is lining the medically drab green corridors and.....well they'll be NO spoilers in THIS review but needless to say, the film allows you no respite; not in the conventional sense that it hits you with a violent (though the violence when it does happen MAY be too much for some to stomach) dramatic sledgehammer every ten minutes, but that it's oppressive atmosphere, singlehandedly generated by performance and sound alone, are so strong that once it has you in it's slimy grasp, it's very hard to shake yourself of an overriding paranoia that resonates even after the credits roll - and quite simply, high praise indeed must be bestowed to both.

Ewan McGregor is predictably superb as our hero (though why some directors won't let him act in his natural tongue is beyond me, there ARE scottish people in America you know!), confused, out of his depth, terrified (Martin, not Ewan, lol!) and all of it comes across to the audience wonderfully. Instantly we have a character that we care about. The perfect 'other-half' in a female form is the sublimely 'real' Patrica Arquette (Katherine, Martin's understanding, un-obtrusive girlfriend) who has, in the same beat, innocence, fragility and strength all in her admirable arsenal, traits that simply shine, albeit a tad under-used, a common gripe of 'Nightwatch' I understand but also accept as the true strength and backbone of the film lies solely on Martin's wanderings in the dead hour morgue. Supporting roles go to Josh Brolin as the 'freaky-are-you-really-my-friend? James (who maybe went a little 'too far over the top' in a few scenes) and Nick Nolte proving, if he even had to, that he can command attention in a 'close up' far superior perhaps to any other character actor of his generation.

The sound in 'Nightwatch', both musically and atmospherically, is perhaps - in skill terms - on par with David Cronenberg's 'Scanners' (You know - remember having to turn the volume UP on late night screenings to catch the dialogue - only to have to scramble for the remote when the visceral 'loud as' scenes erupted?!!). It's a tried and tested technique Bornedal exploits that is un-nervingly effective and is a masterclass for those looking to tread a path in movie sound editing.

But let's not forget that at it's heart, 'Nightwatch' is a classic (albeit modernised) 'who-dun-it?' thriller and therefore one clear question remains : is the 'reveal' of the killer obvious or even worth the wait? Surprisingly (and I really can't sugarcoat this) no - not really - but pleasantly 'surprising' (and rather cleverly) is that this very 'flaw' leads succintly to yet again one of 'Nightwatch's hidden strengths; by knowing who the killer is 'early on', it serves as a perfect strategic cat-and-mouse scenario, a kind of 'will he/she get away with it?' and 'how will they get out of this one?' If that sounded intriguing then trust me, the cinematic reality of it is really FAR more gripping, putting our hero into......ah, I won't give it away.

In closing, 'Nightwatch' is not for everyone, it requires a fairly stern stomach and an even sterner moralistic base to truly appreciate it's value, but for those who DO choose to accompany Martin on his nightly rounds, there are some seriously fun times to be had.

Detective Cray(Nick Nolte in an unusual and sick role) suspects Martin as well, but could it be that Cray is the killer? who knows? with stomach churning scenes like when Martin follows the trail of blood and finds the dead woman sitting up against the door, or where Josh Brolin is handcuffed to a pipe and he cuts off his thumb to get loose. great paranoia atmosphere as well. other actors like John C.

Nightwatch never overcomes its genre cliches or matches the visceral intensity of earlier flicks such as Silence of the Lambs or Seven. This, despite a how-can-you-lose mise-en-scene morgue setting, creepy Lynchian details, and normally oddball actors. Instead, it relies on the inherent and cheap titillation of murder itself for any movie excitement-which, if you think about it, leaves a different kind of icky feeling than director Ole Bornedal or screenwriter Steven Soderbergh probably intended.

Nick Nolte stars as the detective assigned to the case and is certain that McGregor is the killer.  The acting is exceptional for a hokey thriller like this (it actually takes itself much more seriously than most viewers will) and many scenes are actually quite creepy, but the story has a few holes and the plot twists are telegraphed a mile in advance.

970747,4,6305051186,"Right from the start I will say Nightwatch is not for everyone. Written by Ole Bornedal and Steven Soderbergh of Sex Lies and Videotape this is a dark movie. However if you like dark movies about serial killers then you may just want to rent this one.
 Martin Bells, Ewan McGregor, takes a job as a Night Watchman at a morgue. He figures he needs to have time to study for his final semester in law school and what better place could he be and still make money? Unfortunately someone is out there killing prostitutes in a most gruesome manner and Inspector Thomas Cray, Nick Nolte, is starting to suspect Martin. Especially when strange things begin to happen at the morgue.
 The movie is definitely a tense thriller. Some of the scenes in it are a bit obvious but others had me guessing. McGegor, soon to be seen as the young Ben Kenobi, does a good job of trying to figure out who is setting him up and Nolte gives his usual fine performance. The supporting cast of Josh Brolin, Brad Dourif (the voice of Chucky) and Patricia Arquette all do a good job moving the film along.
 This movie is tense at times, dark, and bloody. If the previous three things don't bother you in a movie then I strongly suggest checking out Nightwatch.",1017187200,33,1232,4.466666666666667

970751,2,6305051186,"When a respected foreign-film director re-directs his own film for a second time in a different language with a cast of Hollywood yuppie-puppies and a Scottish It Boy as the all-American dupe, warning lights should be going off like the 4th of July.  Nightwatch is a painful exercise in redux and bad screenwriting which pits Ewan McGregor working in the city morgue against Nick Nolte, a police detective on a case of serial killings of hookers.  McGregor's classmate and best friend is Josh Brolin, the kind of friend who is best left at home for family gatherings and formal dinners because his antogonistic sense of humor falls short on charm and social graces.  Patricia Arquette is McGregor's innocent, nice girlfriend who believes her sweetheart is working nights so they can wed.  McGregor completely miscast as an American law student finds himself the target of the serial killer and the prime suspect in the murder investigation of the killings which center at the morgue during his night shift duties.  Although meant to be suspenseful, the majority of tensions is all too obvious as McGregor's character bumbles his way through clues the killer leads him with eyes wide open.  Ole Borendal's original film is a far better version of this story.  Ewan McGregor expressed in interviews his disappointment working in Hollywood after this experience.  The film's ending was reshot after focus groups were critical of its outcome, however, nothing saves this film from its failure to entertain.  On the plus side, McGregor exhibits tremendous talent as a screamer that later resurfaces in films like Phantom Menace, A Life Less Ordinary, and Moulin Rouge.

It's almost a shot-by-shot, line-by-line retelling of the familiar 'whodunit' with a law student (the uncomfortable Ewan McGregor) being menaced by a serial killer during his nightwatch at a medical building.  The character shading, smooth flow of events, and atmospheric chills have been replaced at the expense of visual finesse and inexplicable character motivation.  Style over substance, much in the vein of those melarkey ""Scream"" films, and more than likely to snare in the kiddies.
My two-star rating is based solely on the stylish re-creations of a few scenes, plus admirable performances from Nick Nolte and Josh Brolin, who give the dense material their all.  But my advice is to avoid this version altogether and stick with the real deal.",991180800,6,965,5.287581699346405

The script does it's best to give you three possible suspects, and even though, it's easy to figure out the killer after a lengthy philosophical monologue, the resolution and denouement are quite tense and terrifying.
Ewan McGregor does a fine job in the leading role of Martin, the night watchman who gets embroiled in the serial killings of several prostitutes.  Josh Brolin is also very effective in his role of the strange, death-fascinated buddy of Martin; Patricia Arquette gives a strong understated performance as Martin's girlfriend Katherine; I don't remember the name of the actress who plays the 17 year old Joyce, but she is quite good in a very difficult role---the scene where Brolin forces her to admit her kinky experiences is disturbing and riveting.  Nick Nolte hams it up quite effectively, although one scene where he says nothing but his face undergoes some dramatic changes, is eerily superb.
The direction is brisk, the setting spooky, and the overall effect is quite shattering.

But this is  one movie you cannot tear your eyes from...even at its gruesome best. Ewan  MacGregor stars as a college student taking a job as a night watchman for  the local morgue (I'll grant that he tries very hard to make his accent  less pronounced, but it's still noticeable at times). Essential gory  plotline: a serial killer is on the loose. Ewan (as Martin) becomes the  main suspect, and the only murder witnesses are the dead ones. Essential  plot thickener: his girlfriend (Patricia Arquette) has become the killer's  next target, and it doesn't help that his friend (Josh Brolin) keeps  ""challenging"" Martin into doing things that seem to serve a  purpose of making him look guilty. Essential twist: The twist is, of  course, the killer's identity, and I can't very well give that away, can  I?
I will, however, say that I didn't seriously suspect the murderer  until he basically said it himself. And I felt absolutely horrible as my #1  suspect ended up saving them all.
