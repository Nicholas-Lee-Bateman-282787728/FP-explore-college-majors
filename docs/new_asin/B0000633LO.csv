1686928,4,B0000633LO,"This is a movie based on things that happened in real life, sighting that people have seen of a monster, lots of the information provided here was taken from many sources!!!The Mothman saved some from the hands of death and sent others to an early grave. For 3 years a dark apparition terrified a sleepy West Virginia town, many citizens claim they saw him, is it true? What The Mothman is we will never know, though he hasn't been seen in a long time. From the first time the Mothman appeared in Point Pleasant, West Virginia in early 1964, people have been supplying their own theories about what 'it' was, where he came from, and what his purpose was. Some thought the Mothman was an angel or a devil. With all the UFOs people spotted in the skies, some thought it only natural to assume the Mothman was an alien. Others believed he was the terrifying climax of a 200 year old curse. The truly skeptical decided it was nothing more than a bird and a dose of wild imagination... until the Mothman appeared to them. But in the absence of hard evidence, one guess is as good as another and we may never know...",1010448000,41,1110,4.419512195121952

Richard Gere is very believable in the role of a news reporter, and I was surprised by Laura Linney's casting as a deputy sheriff.  She did a terrific job in her role. and the two seemed to like each other in the movie. If they didn't get along, they hid it well, because together, they did seem to be enjoying themselves in this movie.  I'm not a big fan of science fiction.

1686991,5,B0000633LO,"While a lot of the book was left out--and maybe rightly so, this is a creepy story which may or may not be paranormal. Richard Gere and Laura Linney give fine performances as they struggle to understand what accounts for the deaths and weird happenings. Gere's character is driven to discover the frightening mystery. The bridge scene at the end is terrific, especially on bigger screens. Horrifying. Remember: ""Wake up, number 37.""",1463788800,,432,5.013888888888889

I hadn't ever heard of the Moth man, which fascinated me and I ended up doing some reading on it after the movie, so really that was the only merit in my eyes.

1687002,5,B0000633LO,"OK, maybe not a GREAT movie, but great enough, for the genre - moody, visually stylish/chilly. You actually say to yourself, a few times,""wow, that's a nice shot"". A rare, almost unbelievable, subtext within this 'paranormal' movie is the communication of the serious peril of  becoming seduced/crippled by a fascination with the paranormal. This warning most clearly delivered by the Alan Bates character, 'Leek' ( as in 'Keel', John Keel, who wrote the original book, and really went down the 'Mothman' rabbit-hole ). Chilly & doom-laden, but with a happy-enough ending. LOTS of lovely close-ups; of Debra Messing, Laura Linney, and even Will Patton. Gere is great, but HIS close-ups reveal, surprisingly ( for a Hollywood heart-throb ), beady, beady eyes & a fascinatingly dough-y nose  : D  - just sayin'.  You might want to burst out laughing when you first see cute-as-a-button Laura Linney in her sheriff get-up, but you don't because you're so grateful you're not looking at Lee Ermey(sp?) !",1459209600,,999,5.110429447852761

1687004,5,B0000633LO,"This is a very compelling movie that I saw for the first time recently on the SYFY channel. It's filmed in a very artful way which adds to the tense atmosphere, and the acting is very good. I'm not a 'fear' buff at all when it comes to movies, but this was just the right touch of suspense and creepy and ultimately left you wondering how much reality there was to this situation.
I wasn't familiar with the Mothman mythos before this, but as an Ancient Aliens enthusiast, I found the ideas compelling enough to make me do a little more research. The many reviews of the book upon which the movie is loosely based gave me the impression that Richard Gere's sympathetic character bears little resemblance to the actual person on whom it's based, and I wasn't much interested in reading the book after reading the reviews of it, although the Indrid Cold figure is still very intriguing to me.

I then heard ""train, 26,"" I looked it up the next morning and to my horror, there was a train derailment in another country where 26 people died in '06.

Besides that, the storyline is fascinating to me, as I believe is all things prescient.  If moths, and perhaps even butterflies, are symbolic, as well as physiological/psychological precursors to tragedies, then humanity is in good shape.  Having prescient, communicative beings, in the form of moths (angels perhaps?) in our world to warn us of future events can only be a good thing, helping us progress in the evolution of the planet and cosmos.  That being said, the movie is stellar in its presentation of this theme.",1447718400,,675,5.1
1687022,3,B0000633LO,"I was familiar with the mothman tale from The Unsolved Mysteries episode. It does gets the mind wondering.  The film does have an eerie sense of tone and bleakness to appreciate. Gere was a nice choice to hold the movie together that basically stems from a few eye witness accounts in real life, but not much else to follow other than combos of creepy scares in the town and puzzled looks that wore thin after a while. The stilted voice over the phone when Gere was in the hotel was chilling, but again, if you know the legend it can be told in about a minute and the movie just didn't grip me after the first half as it tried to stretch the story. They should've had an actor in a massive mothman costume with glowing eyes lurking in the chemical plant while Gere attempted to investigate, that would've kept me tuned in. I think they were afraid to really go for it here.",1447200000,,873,4.323170731707317

Knowing the background of this movie and listening to the author of the book it's based on is somewhat fundamental to understanding and knowing what this movie is based on (factual events). It's pretty amazing to me that this actually happened and that people (LOTS of them) really saw the 'Mothman'. As often as this happened over the centuries and has rarely been reported on makes this movie even more of a mystery. If you haven't seen it, you owe it to yourself to purchase and watch this movie. The acting is GREAT and the production and filming are superior to most movies I've watch. HIGHLY recommended.",1443398400,7,766,4.723880597014926

He is not only the recipient of creepy happenings, but is accused of being the cause of creepy stuff happening to others. This movie does a good job of telling a story of what would happen if normal, sane, small town and big city people were confronted with scary, supernatural events... they'd doubt each other, question their sanity, ignore red flags, reach out to strangers, and try to solve things that are unsolvable.

1687138,4,B0000633LO,"I saw this movie at a theater back when it was a new release and I liked it. Not really a scary movie, it's more of a mystery/thriller and it is loosely based on reportedly actual happenings in Point Pleasant, West Virginia. I expect that most people who want to see this movie already have and if not I don't want to provide any spoilers, so just look at the principal players in this thing and decide whether or not you want to spend your time watching. A couple of years ago my wife and I visited Point Pleasant in the hopes of getting some information about the mothman. The town is making the most of this movie and even has a statue of the critter. Was it worth the trip? We both felt it was. There is more history in that town than just the mothman and it was a good visit for us. If you take the right road on the way to town (I'd have to go through our photos to find it) you will go right past a very original diner that serves up hot dogs and beer or other drinks and has a huge display of old memorabilia in and around the building. You get to eat in a school bus if you like and are invited to write all over the walls. We wheeled around when we saw clearly what it was and I had a beer and a dog. I even wrote on the wall. Well, back to the movie...I had the opportunity to watch a high definition version of the film a week or so ago and will be forevermore spoiled by that event. The high definition showing was clear and virtually devoid of any defects while the picture quality of the DVD is less than stellar. I don't know if this movie will ever be released on Blu-ray, but if it is I will be placing my order quickly. That being said, the DVD is currently the only way to buy the movie other than as a streaming video that you can't physically get your hands on; so your options are rather limited. You can tweak your TV and player settings and make the DVD entirely viewable, or you could watch a HD streamed video. Or you could wait it out in case it gets released on Blu-Ray at some point in time. This is an entertaining movie that deserves to be seen, so don't wait too long!
April 2015:
Amazon's policy on these streaming video files is simply deplorable! You buy it, but you can't download it to your pc. And if the content provider ever decides to make it unavailable you lose it even though you paid for it. And Amazon gets to keep the money you paid since they declare themselves the winner. I'm also supposing that any videos you 'purchase' this way would automatically become unavailable to you if you cancel your prime membership. I'm glad I only purchased one video. If this is the future of home movie watching I'll have to bail out.",1405468800,6,2669,4.154440154440154

Should he not?
Is it destiny or all in his head?

What would you do in the situation?

There is lots of nice spooky background music. We get a handful of sudden surprises. Lots of the scenes were shot in the dark with poor lighting to give it abidance. All the clues are there, just not the interpretation.

1687164,1,B0000633LO,"Let me begin by saying that I am a sucker for sci-fi, mystery and horror movies in general. And so much so that I would happily enjoy  movies that most people over 13 would find too childish.. but everything has its' limits!
This movie is one of the most demented and boring I have seen in the last few years (and again, I do watch a lot of bad movies:). If you want to spend two hours of your like watching Richard Gere spending most of his time at the phone, in the middle of a scant story that makes no sense whatsoever, well then be my guest, but my advice is avoid this demented flick like plague! The idea goes more or less like this: happy couple, buying a new house, the Mothman urban legend appears to the wife driving back home, causes her to crash and hit her head against the car window. Turns out she is terminally ill with brain tumor. Spends last days drawing mothlike monsters. Makes sense, right? I guess a mothman's work is appearing to terminally ill people and cause them car accidents. But it gets even better. Couple of years later husband find himself by night in the middle of nowhere(Point Pleasant:) ask for help at a house , turns out he 's been there three days consecutively. Now that's mystery! Then husband goes on an interview spree with a hot female agent asking around for Mothman sightings, kind of a cross between agent mulder and scully of X-Files and a Monsterquest episode. And like if that was not enough, the unfortunate owner of the house that husband went knocking at so often starts seeing the Mothman as well, once even calls husband and actually passes him the mothman on the phone ( I am not kidding...!). Of course the only intelligent questions that husband manages to make are a couple of questions to ascertain that the guy on the phone knows everything about what him and what he's doing in that moment..asking about what this is all about would have of been unpolite I guess. Then unfortunate owner of the house that husband went knocking at so often finds nothing better to do than go into a wood and dying of cold (by the way, no snow, no ice, pretty comfortable climate out there, must have taken a while...). If you are starting to get lost at this point don't worry, you're not alone...
What else, ah yes husband starts getting hissing phone calls from the Mothman announcing an ominous event. Telling which event of course would have been too trivial, Good job Mothman, keep 'em guessing!  Husband single-handedly decides that the disaster is gonna be in the chemical plant the day of the governor's visit (on the basis of the bad luck that politicians always bring, I guess..).  Turns out he's wrong. Bad Mothman.. bad Mothman....Then husband  gets an anonymous letter saying his dead wife will call him at home at noon Christmas. He rushes back home in Washington, five minutes before noon gets a call from the hot police officer in point pleasant. Call you back in 15 mins? No way he chats with her quite a while and she invites him for Christmas with her family.. how sweet! Take that mothman!  Then when she hastily hangs up since he 's whining and weeping on the phone with no sign of stopping he finally gets the call he 's gone back to Washington for. And what does husband do? But rips phone line off and when the phone keeps ringing anyhow he just ignores it and happily sets for a Merry Christmas a Point Pleasant. Makes sense, right?  Then he finds himself on the collapsing Silver Bridge and guess who is there too, the hot police officer of course. The scene when both her and husband go running around the collapsing bridge telling everyone to ""get out of the bridge"" is priceless. Nobody would have thought of that otherwise!!! Finally hot police officer closes himself in car so she can drown better and comfortably when the car goes down, but husband is there and jumps down in the river, swims to the bottom and rescues the fainted hot police officer from her underwater car with skill that every journalist have I assume.. So there it is, hot new fiancee saved! Take that , mothman! .. Or thanks Mothman??  You go figure it out.. I guess we' ll never know...

 The cast is excellent. Gere is always great in wierd parts and wears them like a second skin. His wife, the sherrif, and everyone else involved is A plus. No cardboard cutouts here!

 Very intelligent and expertly directed. Beautiful coloring and mind-twisting flashbacks. The movie messes with the mind, makes you think, and then turns around and comes back for more. There are some truly confusing and creepy events.

 We go in with a tragedy by watching the death of the journalists wife and then follow him to a small town he is led to through troubling means. *His dead wifes call as one of them* There it really goes up on the paranormal meter. We see other townsfolk who have had sightings, visions, whatever you want to call. We get into mystery, myths and legend.

 The movie is glossy and flashes some effective angles; the use of characters is superb; plot and mysterious tidbits keep the ball rolling at high speed.

1687214,5,B0000633LO,"Whatever you think of the bizarre events that served as the inspiration for this movie, I think most viewers will agree that The Mothman Prophecies is an exceedingly good film.  Richard Gere and Laura Linney are just fantastic, and the whole production - writing, directing, cinematography - is top-notch.  In the hands of a lesser cast and crew, this film could easily have been a great big joke of a disaster that would have inspired nothing more than mockery.  After all, the real story of what transpired in Point Pleasant, West Virginia is so bizarre and so outside the range of human experience and knowledge that skeptics basically laugh it off and even many with open minds simply choose to ignore it.

Richard Gere plays Washington Post reporter John Klein, who becomes inextricably linked to the Mothman phenomenon through some kind of weird fate.  It begins with the series of drawings made by his terminally ill wife.  Two years later, he somehow impossibly ends up in Point Pleasant while driving in a completely different direction during the night.  If that isn't strange enough, the first person he meets there accuses him of having harassed his family for three nights straight.  Through local cop Connie Mills (Laura Linney), he learns that this is just one of a growing number of strange local reports over the last few days.  He soon finds himself investigating reported sightings of a giant Mothman creature with glowing red eyes terrifying local residents.  One man in particular seems to have a special relationship with the creature and begins reporting predictions from someone or something calling itself Indrid Cole - predictions that quickly come true.  As his obsession with the story - and Cole in particular - grows, heightened by his own questions about his wife's death, Klein becomes convinced that the Mothman is trying to warn him about a great tragedy about to happen.

If you like your storylines wrapped up in a nice and understandable little bow, you probably aren't the ideal audience for The Mothman Prophecies.  There are plenty of clues but few answers as to the nature of the phenomenon on display here.  That is largely because there is no real explanation of the true events of 1966-67 that inspired the film.  Of course, the film has taken a certain amount of artistic license with that story - moving it up to ""the present day,"" linking it to other Mothman sightings since the 1960s, and introducing fictional characters such as John Klein and investigator Alexander Leek (obviously a reference to John Keel, the most prominent researcher of the Mothman sightings) - but much of what you see here was reported by those who lived through the actual events in Point Pleasant.  In point of fact, much more of the real story didn't make its way into the film plot - e.g., reported UFO sightings and Men in Black frightening certain townspeople into silence.  What is here, though, proves more than enough to fascinate, captivate, and perhaps even frighten viewers, while the performances of Gere and Linney further imbue this bizarre story with an all-important sense of emotional power and humanity.  The Mothman Prophecies is a fantastic movie.",1328313600,4,3191,4.954971857410881
1687215,4,B0000633LO,"First off, I would not call *The Mothman Prophecies* a ""horror"" film. If it were, I could not have watched it, because gore makes my stomach turn and watching sick people doing sick things makes me sick. No, I would classify TMP as what they used to call a ""psychological thriller.""

So you won't see people's intestines slithering out of their bellies, eyes popping bloodily out of exploding heads, serial killers dining on their victims, or any of the gratuitous obscenity that characterizes horror films. In fact, you won't *see* much at all, except to note the shady, eerie atmosphere. The genius of TMP is to take snippets and get the viewer to use them in creating his/her own personal vision and sense of what is happening. There is much that is never really unraveled, leaving the viewer to attempt to connect everything--or to simply experience it. It's one of the few films I've ever seen where the viewer constructs the reality more than the filmmakers did.

*The Mothman Prophecies* is a unique film, and as such it won't be appreciated by everyone. But, if you like to think about what you're watching rather than just letting yourself be led along, and if you like to plumb mysteries even though you know all ends will not be tied into a nice pretty package, and if you believe truth is nebulous rather than concrete, you will want to immerse yourself in this film--and you'll be glad you bought the DVD, because you will want to re-experience it many times.",1328313600,5,1472,4.7015503875969

I really like the sound track. It does create a dark atmosphere right from the beginning. Good acting too, Richard Gere and Laura Linney support the movie very well.

It definitely feels creepy when you watch it a night with the lights dimmed. That being said, I was longing for more. At the beginning, there are a few sightings of the mothman, but past the second half of the movie, the pace slows down and you somehow feel that there will not be anything scarier, and most action focuses around weird phone calls. We receive no explanations about the mothman's intentions, or why he talks to a few select people. Some camera shots zoom in from space on the small village, but I am not sure whether they represent the mothman's view or not.

Right close to the end the pace accelerates again toward an intense climax. I did enjoy the ending. It explained a strange dream that the local cop described.

All in all, not bad a movie at all, but I am not sure whether it should be categorized as a ""horror"" movie. I also wished there was more of a story instead of loose sightings and phone calls which don't really feel connected.",1320710400,3,1158,4.44811320754717
1687217,5,B0000633LO,"I found this film extremely intersting.  After watching the second disc, the documentary of the Mothman Prophecies, I discovered that the actual eye-witness accounts were much more creepy and eerie than the movie.  I also watched another documentary, 2 hrs. and 35 min. I believe, touching on all points of the movie.  I discovered that most of what happens in the movie actually happened to people either in Pt. Pleasant or somewhere in the vicinity (Indrid Cold, for one, is was experienced by someone from a good distance away from Pt. Pleasant.  Having said that, I thought this was a wonderfully done movie.  I love Richard Gere and Laura Linney.  They are very convincing in their acting.  Definitely buy the two-disc version to see the documentary on disc 2.  And buy the separate disc (""Eyes of the Mothman"") if you want to see something even scarier than the movie.  Some interesting facts are that 46 people died in the disaster, not 36, as in the movie.  The director says, in his commentary, that the ""powers that be"" wouldn't let him give the true number, as it made it sound bad.  Well, it was bad, and I don't think giving the accurate number of 46 is going to hurt.  Also, in the end of the movie, a caption pops up and says that no cause was ever found about why the bridge collapsed.  Actually, this is not true, as this has been studied and it was determined that a single eyebar the first link after the Ohio tower, no. 330, failed, a .1 inch crack forming in it when it failed, causing the entire bridge to fail.  Apparently, there was no technology at the time able to find the flaw (it would have meant taking the eyebar apart) The time it took for the entire bridge to fall into the river was approximately one minute, according to eye-witnesses[...] for a good amount of information on the subject).

1687218,4,B0000633LO,"THE MOTHMAN PROPHESIES

This is a film about the paranormal activities that supposedly took place in West Virginia during the 1960s.  It stars Richard Gere, which immediately raises most peoples suspicions about this being a good horror film, and maybe rightly so.  But it's not the acting that carries the film so much as the creepy storyline and setting that establishes a mood of mystery and danger.

Although based on events in the 1960s, the time line in the film is modern and focuses on John Klein (Gere), a successful reporter with a beautiful wife and a rather ordinary life.  The action begins pretty quickly--there is an automobile accident and the wife is found to be harboring a tumor which is terminal.  But before she dies, she draws a number of vicious, moth-like creatures in her notepad.

We jump ahead a year or two, and while driving alone at night, Klein's car dies and he suddenly becomes embroiled in a local nightmare of paranormal activities in the town of Point Pleasant hundreds of miles from his intended destination.  One question leads to another, and soon the journalist in Klein is knee-deep in a bizarre story of night-time visitors, unearthly phone calls, and distortions of time and space.  The eyewitness evidence points to a moth-like creature similar to that which his wife drew prior to her death and Klein begins to suspect his excursion to Point Pleasant may not be accidental, but rather planned by some unseen force.

The fact is, we are never really sure just what the Mothman is.  In the material plane, we don't even know what the Mothman is.  It doesn't have a physical body (that we ever see), and there are implications it might be electrical or extra-terrestrial.  Nor are we sure about it's mission.  At one point Klein speculates its purpose, but we never really know.  This air of mystery keeps the mood bleak throughout the film, and whenever it seems the Mothman's intentions are good, something will happen that starts our thinking otherwise.  It's a maddening puzzle that spins you in circles, and I think it's why a lot of people don't like the film.  For those who like closure, you won't find any here, but I think that's what the director was going for.  Emphasizing the unknown is an effective tool to produce a frightening landscape.

The location and season the film was shot in contributes greatly to this mysterious feeling.  Shooting the film in winter gives it that washed-out look familiar to that time of year, and the cold temperatures mirror the mood perfectly.  The isolated, rural town surrounded by mountains and dotted with industrial symbols (the steel bridge and chemical plant) further lend a sense of chilliness and distance.  The idea that this place is being visited by this inexplicable force renders a feeling of doom and imprisonment, as if this little town so cut off from the light of day is being haunted by a power so great that there is no escaping it.

Parts of the movie are a bit hard to follow.  The scene when Klein visits with an expert on the Mothman phenomena is inaudible at times, and the repetitiveness gets stale for a while till the movie moves on to it's final conclusion, but I thought the feel of the movie was scary.  There are a lot of shocking scenes that make you jump, and watching this alone at night can definitely give you the chills.  I guess the idea of a creature like the Mothman with powers of foresight, telepathy, whatever it is, is unnerving.

Bottom line here is that the movie keeps your interest and most successfully of all, it draws you into the story.  The characters are engaging, and while we never see a conclusive explanation for the mysterious happenings, this only adds to the appeal of the film.  The ending is also one of the most fantastic I have ever seen and ends the entire saga with a bang.",1317945600,3,3831,4.701649175412294

It moves at an extremely slow pace, and I was okay with it. More and more of the story and character development comes in and finally, some of the scares come in. It doesn't really do much until you hear the mothman, who's name is Indrid Cold. I thought it sounded scary and later on you find out it didn't come from human vocal cords, and after that they don't explain anything. What was it then? The film really doesn't do much, although it had good drama. I give it two and a half stars for the drama, story, and intense ending.",1301529600,,838,4.412903225806452

1687235,3,B0000633LO,"`The Sixth Sense', that 1999 blockbuster (groundbreaking if you will) smash hit that earned a ridiculous amount of Oscar attention for a film of it's genre, spawned a huge heap of copycat films that tried very hard to build off the foundation that M. Night Shyamalan created.  Some of then soared (`The Others'), some of them flopped (`Dragonfly') and some of them fell somewhere in the middle.

I think `the middle' is a good place for `The Mothman Prophesies'.

Coming off like an incomplete mixture of `The Sixth Sense' and `The Blair Witch Project', `The Mothman Prophesies' has quite a bit going for it, but it also throws a lot of its promise away by failing to develop its themes to a stronger degree.

John Klein is a grieving widower/journalist who has become consumed with a mysterious urban legend involving a creepy creature known as the Mothman.  With strange prophesies and even stranger `occurrences', Klein stays in Point Pleasant, West Virginia for far too long looking for answers that are never going to come.

I am all about ambiguity, and I like open endings, but there is something about `The Mothman Prophesies' that feels incomplete.  The concept here is quite fascinating, but it feels largely underdeveloped, even with the intensity surrounding the films climax (which I can still see vividly in my minds eye).  The character development found in the likes of John Klein (portrayed with brooding sincerity by Richard Gere) is rather outstanding for a film that fails to tie up any loose ends, but he is the only facet of the film that feels as though it received a fair deal.  The Mothman, who should have received the bulk of the attention, seems to fall to the wayside here.  Yes, the film captures some very creepy tones (thanks to a score that was tailor made for fear and some very chilling camera shots) but the real meat of the `happenings' seems to be missing here.

I am not familiar with the `true accounts' that inspired this film, so I cannot say with any authority whether or not this film captures the realities it professes to.  All I can say is that I'm sure there is more lurking beneath this story that could have been fleshed out to create something eternally haunting.  Instead, this film raises questions it fails to answer, thus crafting a chilling experience that cools soon after watching.",1279065600,,2339,4.788557213930348

1687245,5,B0000633LO,"Although I am a professor of literature, I have often been a fan both of classic horror films and of studies in the paranormal. I have been known to write reviews of horror films and even to contribute an article to the Atlantic Paranormal Society publication about supposedly real creatures in Indonesia.  I am an avid fan of the COAST TO COAST AM radio program and Psychic Radio from Detroit, heard here in China on AOL Radio.  However, I have not, to this point, written my thoughts about THE MOTHMAN PROPHECY, a film that straddles the line between being an old-fashioned (non-violent) horror film that suggests more than it shows . . . and a film about psychic predictions that are extremely eerie when they are shown to be true.

If I had to list my favorite horror film of all time -- and that includes a broad spectrum of classics reaching from Hammer horror films to THE INNOCENTS and the Italian film BLACK SUNDAY-- I would place THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES at the top. It works successfully on a level that no other film I have seen quite approaches. If one wants suspense and ambiguities instead of blood-dripping gore (in a genre made popular by Dario Argento), if one wants to see characters (portrayed by Richard Gere and Laura Linney) who are as perplexed as we are because they keep encountering more questions than answers, one could do far worse than spending time with Mark Pellington's skillfully directed cinematic masterpiece. Each camera placement (from extreme close-ups of Richard Gere's ear to compelling aerial shots) is perfection.  One would be hard-pressed to find a more suspenseful scene than the one where Gere talks on the phone to a mothman named Indrid Cold in his motel room. When Gere thinks he sees his dead wife in his motel room bed, I literally jumped in my theatre seat and almost lost all of the popcorn from the bag balanced on my lap. After seeing such films as EVIL DEAD, I was pretty sure that nothing in a horror film could still catch me off-guard and push the ""surprise"" button. I was wrong.

What makes this film a classic in suspense is the fact that not all of the frightening scenes are directly related to any mothman creature. If predictions that amazingly come true are compelling to those of us fascinated by psychics and their prophecies, perhaps it is because what we don't see that is more important than what we are shown. Pellington knows how to appeal to our sense of wonder, knowing that what we conjure up in our imaginations will remain with us longer than images of CGI monsters and men in creature suits. After seeing this film, I could not help comparing it to other similar films released at about the same time, such as SIGNS, DRAGONFLY, and Stephen King's DREAMCATCHER.  While THE RING (the Canadian remake as opposed to the Japanese original) comes close with some frightening scenes, the others are luke-warm and flat by comparison with MOTHMAN. A close runner-up in the fright department is the Michael Keaton film WHITE NOISE, perhaps because this is based on actual paranormal research with EVPs, just as THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES is based on actual reported sightings in Point Pleasant WV and the real-life collapse of the Silver Bridge in the late 1960s.

According to John Keel's book based on his investigations and reports heard on COAST TO COAST AM (and even shown in the on-the-spot recorded investigations of the TV series PARANORMAL STATE), these mothman entities have been seen elsewhere in the world (even in Asia) and have occasionally been seen again in the Point Pleasant area. Perhaps not enough evidence yet exists to prove that these creatures actually share the planet with humans and animals (as a scene featuring venerable British actor Alan Bates suggests), the realization that down-to-earth West Virginia residents have reported seeing them adds a deft touch of verisimilitude to the proceedings.",1262822400,2,3891,4.842105263157895
1687246,4,B0000633LO,"Usually not a fan of Sci-Fi, I was very pleased with this film in it's entirety.  An age-old story set in today's world.  Well made visuals and the music was a great compliment to the storyline.  I enjoyed Richard Gere, but I hoped there would be more of Debra Messing and some more girth to Laura Linney's character.

I never jumped out of my seat screaming in horror, but I never left the room either.  Maybe a scream or two would have gotten another star.",1261353600,,458,4.341176470588235
1687247,2,B0000633LO,"When this movie came out, I instantly knew they took the excellent, seminal Keel book, crumpled it up, and threw it in a corner of the room.  The trailer alone captured none of the feel or items of the book.  Seeing Richard Gere flagged it as a film trying desperately trying to claw at viewers attending movies to see familiar faces with expectations of romantic interest... and that's kind of what this film is: a romance, slice-o-life, drama, holiday, supernatural suspense story.

And, yes, it is as muddled as my description.  It just tries to hard to be something which it shouldn't be.  This was a film that either was translated perfectly from a very lack luster script, or it was an idea with a hundred hands influencing the making.  I can't imagine a skilled script writer piecing this together from the book.  The film was probably a real holiday fruitcake shoved full of little fruity bits of story and pap philosophy provided by a cartload of studio fruitcakes bent on influencing something and making it their own.

Final analysis: yawn.

Good points: it ends.
Bad points: none, aside from pacing and lack of story.

This could have been a 50 minute made for TV movie.  Too much time was spent on pauses which, while necessary in proper context usually left out of many ""suspense"" films these days, were just over drawn and close to pointless.  How could someone have read the book, which is filled with UFOs, cryptids, Men in Black, Government conspiracies, poltergeists, cattle mutilations, strange aliens, strange dopple gangers, weird psychotropic effects and expreiences, paranoia, strange and vaporous entities calling and visiting people, predictions of doom, and then a moment of disaster, and come away with a 2 hour film about a barely tangible thread about an angel of death?  The book was written in a setting so rich and the story of John Keel's investigation is so crazy and amazing that a person would have to be fairly ignorant to not pull out so much of the underlying themes and obvious visuals to make a memorable movie.

If you love romantic suspense films that allow you to have sex in the middle without missing any plot when you return to viewing, this is the one to see!

If you want a film rich with intense and interesting events boiling over to seat searing finish making you reflect on life and how to live it, skip it.",1260230400,,2361,4.724390243902439
1687248,1,B0000633LO,"I had read the book The Mothman Prophecies before seeing the film, and was looking forward to a spine-tingling thriller.  What I saw was a watered-down romance with almost none of the spookiness that characterized the novel.

The novel contained numerous scenes that would have made for excellent film - late-night encounters in abandoned military bunkers, lovers' lanes, and other remote areas, where the Mothman is seen in all his preternatural horror.  Basically none of that ends up in the film, nor - except for one brief, ambiguous flash - do we ever see Mothman. Nor do we see or hear much the various ""men-in-black"" individuals who feature prominently in the book.

The movie would have been better if it were based on the real-life expereinces of John Keel, and told from his perspective, rather than from that of a made-up Washington Post journalist (Richard Gere) with no background in paranormal research.

Keel's book started out with a 3:00 am scene where he - returning from a paranormal conference, in the middle of a driving rainstorm - wanders from house to house in rural West Virginia trying to get someone to let him use a phone so he can call a tow truck for his disabled car.  A voice-over of this experience, in which Keel skillfully describes how legends are born, would have made a strikingly visual, and eerie, introduction to the Mothman story. I can visualize it, but the film-makers couldn't.  Read the book for sure, but you're taking your chances with this disappointing film.",1259366400,5,1508,4.8671875

I personally have been creeped out by mothman since childhood while reading about the phenomenon in a sci fi comic book while on a twilight road trip in West Virginia.

Well, Gere or no Gere, TMP is excellent. The Mothman is a mysterious entity (Alien? ghost? Angel? Demon??) that haunts the small town of Point Pleasant, West Virginia. We are only shown glimpses or blurred images of the creature. This actually helps to keep the mood at a constant level of creepiness and building dread. We're never 100% certain about what we're witnessing, just like the main characters themselves. Gere is believably shaken in his role. He is a man suffering from great loss, driven by the need to know WHY. His journey into paranormal terror, mystery, and madness is cold and unsettling. The answers he seeks lead him into a dark world of shadows and portents. A displaced, alternate reality, superimposed over the mundane. He ultimately realizes that his quest has drawn him into something far beyond his understanding. Something bleak and disturbing. Something like impending doom, caught for a second in his peripheral vision. Watch this one, and you'll swear that you see it too...",1252022400,5,1176,4.974619289340102
1687251,4,B0000633LO,"It took me years to see The Mothman Prophecies.  I was in the midst of a switch from VCR tapes to DVD player and The Mothman Prophecies was an unfortunate victim of the transition, a tape with no player for it.  I promptly forgot about it, but Netflix didn't.

In a somewhat eerie parallel, I recently started prepping the Dark*Matter adventure ""The Killing Jar"" for my D20 Modern conspiracy game.  The Killing Jar has quite a bit of information about the Mothman and provided a helpful backdrop to The Mothman Prophecies.

What's interesting is that this movie actually makes a lot more sense than the book of the same name by John A. Keel.  Keel covers a wide range of paranormal phenomena, from UFOs to Men in Black, from ghosts to the bizarre Mothman. The Mothman itself even has a name, Indrid Cold, and isn't afraid to make phone calls late at night.

And that's what's so unsettling about The Mothman Prophecies. The film flagrantly violates movie tropes by having its apparition not only adopt a name but make dire prophecies at length over the phone.

John Klein (Richard Gere) is the perfect foil for an exploration of the beyond, a haunted man who cannot move on after the death of his wife. Klein has an entire conversation with Cold, testing its knowledge of the present and the future.  He even tapes the phone call.

But Cold's paranormal abilities extend well beyond phone calls. It can adopt other peoples' voices, both dead and alive. Ghosts show up in the flesh. It can leave messages for you at the front desk. And you can tape it all you want - vocal analysis will show it's an actual voice.  Your voice.  Only you didn't make the call.

If you know anything about the original Mothman Prophecies, you know how all this ends.  But that's beside the point. The Mothman Prophecies is largely about grief and recovery.  But it's also about the burden of the future, knowing that there is an inevitable conclusion to all things that we simply cannot control.  Death brings that knowledge into terrible perspective.

Unfortunately, the movie drags.  And drags.  The eerie sounds are a bit overplayed; in some cases, silence would have been more effective than the relentless sound effects.  The aural assault may have been more effective in the theater, but on television it's just annoying.

That doesn't detract from Mothman's overall sense of dread. If you have an interest in paranormal procedurals, watch The Mothman Prophecies.  It will leave you Cold.  And that's a good thing.",1249862400,,2500,4.7627906976744185

Don't be fooled, however, with the ""based on a true story"" tag line. It might be ""based"" but that could mean only a very, very small part of this film was actual; the rest presented for dramatic purposes. From what I've read, this is the case here.

1687254,2,B0000633LO,"Having always had an interest in psi phenomena, & having read many of Keel's books & essays in magazines, I wanted to see it to see if Hollywood could actually make a decent film of a genuinely interesting phenomenon- whether a true encounter with the unknown, or as myth-in-the-making. The film starts off in late 1999 with Washington Post political reporter John Klein (Gere- 1 of America's hammiest actors) & his wife Mary (Debra Messing from tv's `Will & Grace') looking to buy a house in the DC area. Driving home they are in an accident when Mary swerves off the road after having a vision of some red-eyed creature coming toward their car. She hits her head, is hospitalized, & found to have some tumor that could warp her perceptions. A few weeks later she dies. Gere weeps, but discovers his wife filled a notebook with the creature she saw- some dark angelic being. Gere is solemnity itself. 2 years pass & he's on his way south from DC to go to Richmond, Virginia to interview a possible Presidential candidate: the state's governor. Driving at night he somehow ends up 400 miles west of his destination- in Point Pleasant, West Virginia. His car breaks down & he knocks on the door of a house. Gordon & Denise Smallwood (Will Patton & Lucinda Jenney) answer. Gordon pulls a gun on John & holds him prisoner in his bathtub until town cop Connie Parker (Laura Linney) arrives. She convinces the Smallwoods to let John go. They claim he has harassed them the past few nights. Connie takes John to stay at a motel & the next day his car is towed, but turns out to be in perfect working order. Mysterious music & MTV-like film cuts intone this, & every hum-drum occasion....  This is a film too bad to be good & too good to be so bad it's good. DULL is the watchword, unless watching Richard Gere's Shatnerian reactions to a phone ringing is your idea of edge-of-the-seat horror. That Mothman never makes an appearance would be fine if the film gave us something else, or kept a mystery worth keeping- but nada. & this is perhaps the only `action' film I can recall where a gratuitous love story would have improved the tale. Laura Linney's Connie is the only character developed to any emotional or deep extent, or which induces any concern.

Supposedly based off some factual event, the film does a good job of keeping us in suspense and really keeps us guessing.

1687258,5,B0000633LO,"THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES was an outstanding five star horror film starring Richard Gere, Laura Linney, and Debra Messing. This film was directed by Mark Pellington, edited by Brian Berdan and filmed under the direction of Fred Murphy. I mention these names because of the wonderful visual effects, great camera work and especially fine film editing which assisted the cast to relate the story. Last, but not least, the musical score is as original as it is strange and beautiful.

This film had outstanding acting, an absolutely great script and a well thought out plot. It was meticulously filmed, staged and edited which did not overwhelm the performance. Although it was not critically acclaimed, it was well received by fans and is one of the most visually expressive films I have ever watched.

While scarcely a documentary it is based on the collapse of the Point Pleasant Bridge. The plot involves a Washington Post reporter (Richard Gere playing John Klein) who is deeply in love with his new bride, her tragic and mystifying death and his exposure to dark forces that result when he is driven to leave town in despair.

One night while in a fit of depression he is drawn to Point Pleasant Virginia where several odd sightings of strange lights in the sky, and an inexplicable butterfly or moth like shape (Mothman) have been reported by a small but steadily growing number of people. More troubling is the fact that these folks are good townspeople, solid citizens and even local police, making it difficult to brush off reports as imagined. When this entity begins to make verbal communication it starts by saying ""Be not afraid,"" and then goes on to make tragic predictions. Its last words are often ""I will see you in time"".

After being first drawn into this situation, Richards Gere's car gives out in the middle of a country road due to an electrical problem, conjuring up thoughts of X-Files UFO sightings, angelic or possibly demonic visitations. Once settled at a local motel he is bothered by several strange nocturnal phone calls, wrong numbers, un-requested wake up calls and ultimately hears via phone the voice of the mysterious Indrid Cold.

The reporter contacts a writer and expert on the subject who he learns was once a tenured professor of physics from Cornell. Alexander Leek describes his encounters with the Mothman starting with his receiving predicted disasters, trying to communicate warnings with the authorities and people at risk, being investigated, almost arrested, divorced, and estranged from his family. He last pleads with John Klein to back away from the situation. Mr. Leek made one last appeal saying ""Do you know what four years in a psychiatric hospital can do to you? The real issue becomes which is more important, having proof or being alive?""

When asked on the phone by John Klein what the creature looks like it replies ""It depends on who is looking"". After the call the reporter brings a recording of the strange voice to a voice print analyst who determines that it was not produced by a human larynx as it is carried by too narrow a portion of the audio spectrum close to around 2000 Hz. The specialist identifies the voice as ""artificial"" (i.e., computer generated?).

After Indrid Cold convinces the reporter of his otherworldly nature he goes on to mysteriously predict the collapse of the Point Pleasant Bridge (something John Klein must put together for himself). Just when I was getting ready for the film to disappoint, the destruction of the bridge is convincingly presented in parallel with the telling of the remainder of the very mysterious plot.

The bridge collapse was I believe the result of skillful model and CGI work, and was exceptionally credible looking. Real world slow motion effects which amazed me included: reflected waves traveling along support cables when they were under tension and when relaxed, the flexing, yielding and rupture of ductile bridge structure, the realistic powdering and fragmenting of brittle materials (probably model work), falling massive segments of the bridge and submerged bridge structures and vehicles. In addition to being very realistic it was very artistically done, including the final scenes of vehicles under bridge debris on the river bottom with headlights still on, producing a strange otherworldly visual effect of blue light beams in the water.

In short, after the movie had delivered on every level it went on to provide during the last five minutes some of the most thrilling and realistic special effects I have ever watched. Many of the screen effects provide fleeting glimpses of the mothman, snatches of a strange face in a door mirror, or the fine detail of the morphing shape of a moth reflected in the pupil of a human eye. These hand crafted images hold up during slow scan and were often too subtle to be noticed on the first viewing.

If we can believe the reports, Mothman sightings have been taking place all over the world in areas of great tragedy and loss of life, including Chernobyl.  While none of these sightings have been accompanied by verbal communication, the reports alone were sufficient for many of us to suspend disbelief and allow the story to take us along with it. This great movie is a must see for all fans of the paranormal who appreciate a fine film.

Since I am not a horror film fan at all--I stay away from them--my interest in this, besides the good cast, was that fact that this ""supernatural"" event was at least somewhat true.  I do believe in some supernatural phenomenon so I had an interest in seeing exactly what did happen here.  The story, though, isn't completely factual, so the viewer is left wondering what actually happened and what didn't.  It's so bizarre.  One wonders who was making the phone calls, who was disguising their voices, the time warp, the mysterious re-appearance of the dead wife...etc. etc.  After a while my mind got tired of trying to figure it out and I focused on the possible romance of Gere and Linney.  There, too, I was disappointed, as nothing conclusive is shown.

I guess if you really really love horror films and you don't care if anything is real, then you might like this film.  For me, it is mostly a waste of excellent actors.",1205625600,,1398,4.646341463414634

The Special Edition of this film is the one to get. I already owned the Original Theatrical Release, but re-purchased it because I had to see the two documentaries that were included on disk two. I usually frown at studios double-dipping to rake in more cash from an unsuspecting audience, but in this case it was well worth it. This is a much over-looked movie that was superb in every way.

1687263,5,B0000633LO,"Few movies are as creepy as this one, mainly because there's quite an element in truth to the horror. Compare it to ""The Exorcist"" or maybe ""Ghost Story"" (with Fred Astaire).

It's all about the people in a small West Virginia town on the Ohio River who suddenly become plagued with sightings of a VERY scary entity, The Mothman. A big-city newspaper reporter gets on the story and finds a lot more than he bargained for.

The Mothman is supposedly associated with an old Shawnee Indian curse on the whites as a result of The Battle of Point Pleasant. Given that basis for the appearance of The Mothman, The Silver Bridge, which spans the Ohio River, fell on a cold December night during the rush hour and many people were killed.

This part, anyway, is true... on 12/15/67 The Silver Bridge DID actually fall and 46 people were killed! That's what makes this movie so creepy, in part. The Mothman was blamed by many for the tragedy. I recall clearly the night that this bridge fell and actually had a close friend who had crossed the bridge about an hour prior to the disaster, so this movie is really personal for me.

The other facet of creepiness in this film is that it is simply well-done, brilliantly directed and perfectly cast.

This movie has been a real sleeper and if you haven't seen it, do so. But be ready for the fact that you might not sleep so good on the night that you do!",1197849600,6,1392,4.443137254901961

1687265,5,B0000633LO,"Upon seeing this again it reminds of another creepy ghost movie that came out later (in 2005) called ""White Noise"" with Michael Keaton. I'm sure White Noise borrowed a lot from this movie: the fascination with the paranormal, death of a spouse, the cryptic and eccentric *paranormal* ""expert"", the inevitable tragic deaths along the way, and of course the creepy, scary and inexplicable happenings that adds to the mystery. Both also featured what is now called: EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomenon) experiences. I enjoyed both this movie and ""White Noise"" for all of those things, but I think that The Mothman Prophecies works better as a complete movie and story than ""White Noise"" did.

Also like the some of the best X-File episodes this movie doesn't answer the questions of what the mothman is and exactly what the meaning of everything happening is too. It leaves it up to you to decide.

The horror is more from the suspense of the events than from blood and gore. This is a movie also along the horror-suspense of ""The Sixth Sense"" even more than the asian-inspired horror movies like ""The Ring"" ""The Grudge"" and such. It is more a drama than horror too, but there are good shocks and the scenes with Indrid Cold are perfectly chilling.

In doing that, filmmakers unintentionally detracted from their genuinely eerie plot and instead left themselves open to constant, kvetching criticism that ""none of that happened!"" Of course it didn't. This is a movie. Duh. Leaving all that behind, The Mothman Prophecies is a fun film to watch even if it could have sped its pace up a bit. The ""Chap Stick"" scene was one part giggly funny and three parts chills down your back spooky, and it was little moments like those that made the supernatural elements work when they could easily have been overpowered by the investigative overtones that held the story together. I also felt the entire movie was somehow a subtle homage to The X-Files, with Richard Gear coming close to playing up on the old ""Wow, David Duchovny looks like him"" talk, but he was ultimately so upstaged by Laura Linney's performance that it's easy to miss that. This is a good movie but not a classic. It's well worth seeing once or twice, and it will probably give susceptible people the creeps. Not quite four stars but a little better than three.",1170288000,3,1317,4.681034482758621
1687268,4,B0000633LO,"This story gets involved with the issue of 'precognition' which is the ability of someone (or some 'thing' in this case) to be able to see and foretell the future.

This is an interesting subject.

Some people believe that it is possible not only to see other times but to travel there physically.

One theory is if you travel back in time and for example kill your parents we wouldn't notice the effect of your actions in this time but you would have created an alternate history.  A 'parrallel' time.

What does this mean ?  I have no idea.

But it raises the question of how can it be possible to see the future unless the future already exists in some form ?  Otherwise it wouldn't be possible to see the future now because something could happen to change it.

This is all far beyond human comprehension but anyway the hero of this story is involved with some sort of force or creature who can predict the future.

The creature has been interacting with the population of a small town using telephones, visions, dreams, apparitions, etc.. The usual bridges to other dark dimensions.

But the moth man creature never comes out and says exactly what's going to happen.  It just gives small clues and glimpses.  That's where the 'adventure' comes in.

The opening credits indicate the story is based on actual events.  Doing that in and of itself creates problems with this type of story.

Like many horror / new age type movies this story walks a fine line between being suspenseful and being utterly rediculous.

Supposedly the mysterious Great Pyramid tells the destiny of our human race encoded in the markings on the walls inside the pyramid.

Perhaps our future is really 'written in stone'.

1687269,3,B0000633LO,"I've never read the novel that THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES is based upon.  I am, however, familiar with the events that took place between November 1966 and December 1967 in Point Pleasant, West Virginia.  I first heard about The Mothman when I was in the second grade and read a book about monsters in the United States.  The story scared me so much that for days I had nightmares and was afraid of looking out of windows.  I soon conquered my fear, but in doing so, forgot about Mothman.  That was until I saw a special about the creature and Point Pleasant on the Sci-Fi channel a couple years ago.  It was through that show that I learned a movie, THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES had been made about the events surrounding the 1966-1967 events in Point Pleasant.  I finally got around to watching the movie recently.

The movie takes place in a modern setting and revolves around a man named John Klein (Richard Gere), a successful journalist for the Washington Post.  John and his wife Mary (Debra Messing) finally find and agree to purchase their dream home.  On their way home after the meeting, Mary sees a winged creature with red eyes jump at her and swerves off the road onto a sidewalk.  John is fine, but Mary sustains a severe head wound which leads doctors to discovering a tumor in her brain.  Not long after, she dies.

Two years later, John is driving out of D.C. and in less than two hours discovers that somehow he's traveled over 400 miles and is outside the town of Point Pleasant, West Virginia.  When he approaches a nearby house, he is held at gunpoint by the home's owner until the police arrive.  It seems that a man looking just like John has been knocking on their door for the past two evenings at 2:30am.  A local police officer, Connie (Laura Linney) arrives on the scene and calms the situation.  Connie isn't surprised by John's story because in the last few months in Point Pleasant a lot of strange things have been happening: strange lights, vivid dreams, haunting voices, bizarre physical illnesses, etc.  The most unusual of the events are the reports and sightings of a creature the locals have begun referring to as The Mothman: a giant humanoid with wings and large red eyes.  Upon seeing drawings of the creature, John is reminded of Mary and the sketches she drew of the creature she saw.  He knows they are one and the same and John sets out to find how deep the connection goes and what exactly the mothman's purpose is.

THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES is a well directed film with some very talented actors.  I like director Mark Pellington's film ARLINGTON ROAD and I really enjoy Laura Linney's work (though I could care less about Richard Gere).  However, I really didn't enjoy the movie.  To begin with, the film takes place in a modern setting while the events at Point Pleasant, which is what the film is based upon, occurred in the late 1960s.  I thought the movie was going to be a period piece, but it turned out to be no such thing.  Though there is a basic plot, the movie is highly disjointed with quick cuts moving from one scene and setting to another.  I understand that this was done purposely as a way to produce the confusion the citizens and John feels in the audience, but I simply found it frustrating. Also, even though the Mothman can be seen several times in the movie, he is never seen clearly or in his entirety.  Once again, I believe this is done for affect, but I wish the creature would have been seen clearly at least once.  It might have just been me, but I found the deep friendship that developed between John and Gordon Smallwood (Will Patton) to be completely unbelievable.  Actually, I found the whole idea of how John was able to become almost a citizen of Point Pleasant to be unrealistic.  I'm from a small town and yes small town people are very friendly welcoming, but they are also very protective.  I don't think the people of the town would have adopted John as quickly as they seem to do in the movie.

THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES is often found in the horror isle of the local video store, but the movie isn't a horror movie.  It's more of a psychological thriller/suspense tale.

Overall, THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES is the type of movie that you might enjoy if you like one of the actors that stars in the film or if you're a fan of the director.  I'd also recommend it to people who have an interest in the event that took place at Point Pleasant, though remember that the film is set in the present and doesn't offer any real suggestions about anything (it also avoids the whole UFO and G-men that were also seen in the area).  For the casual movie watcher, THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES will probably be a mixed bag with just as many people liking it as there are who didn't enjoy it.

1687271,5,B0000633LO,"""The Mothman Prophecies"" is one of the most underrated contemporary horror films I've ever seen.  I only saw this once and that was awhile ago, but I do remember being amazed that a movie this good could be swept under the rug as it seemingly has been.

Richard Gere (yeah, I know) plays a Washington Post reporter named John Klein who loses his wife in a very curious car accident.  After the accident which is purposely filmed so that we don't know how or why it really happened, his terminally damaged wife starts drawing really weird pictures of a moth.  She keeps asking Klein if he saw this bird of sorts or not, a kind of Dracula-like figure with two eyes that are too bright to make one comfortable.  At first he insists he saw nothing but keeps the pictures, the childlike and chilling images playing a perennial part in the film later on.

Will Patton has to be the best actor in this movie.  He plays Gordon Smallwood, outwardly a small town nut and actually a man being driven insane by the bizarre enigma that this innocuous little town unknowingly houses.  When Klein shows up at Gordon's house (and has a rifle shoved in his face), it is not by accident.  Nothing in this movie really is.  The way Pellington shoots the scenes of Gordon losing his mind is unforgettable--it happens in a fizzy, weird video game type way which comes off very vividly.

I've never liked Laura Linney too much and have always felt she belongs on TV but she does a decent job as Connie Mills, the local sherrif who basically serves as the dramatic witness for Klein's breakdowns as

the REAL star of the movie--Indrid Cold--keeps calling him. Only in ""The Exorcist"" or ""Black Christmas"", perhaps, have I seen a movie before in which a creepy, otherworldly voice becomes the star.  Even when Klein tries to escape his obsession and tear out the jack from the phone, it keeps ringing and ringing.

This is an exercise in derangement and a strange form of hope.  The climax will strike some as impressive and others as senseless.  Bottom line: every horror fan should see this.",1160438400,5,2068,4.594005449591281
1687272,4,B0000633LO,"I just read Dirk's ""spolier"" ending to the Mothman Prophecies and had to say huh?  Demonic, fallen angles? What?  Did we watch the same movie?  If all you go by is the movie, that might be the impression you're left with. But if you've ever looked into the events that happened around Point Pleasant, or any of the books on the subject, you'll see that the Mothman was more UFO related than anything. At same time of the Mothman sightings the Point Pleasant area  was in a wave of UFO reports, Men-In-Black, and all sorts of goings-on up in the sky. In fact, Mothman played only a very small part in the drama, it was by far predominately UFO related, as Keel makes clear.

Unfortunately, the producers chose to abandon this aspect of the story entirely, and so the happenings at Point Pleasant lost their entire frame of reference. If you see this movie thinking this was the way things actually happened, you might come to the conclusion of the Mothman being evil, demonic, fallen angles, whatever you like. But if you research the incident at all, you'll see you're only getting a fraction of the story from the movie. And if, like Dirk, you thereby think you know all about what Mothman actually was based on just the movie alone, then all your conclusions end up being based simply on a Hollywood writer's imagination and script and nothing more. Mothman having anything to do with demons and angels or any religious overtones is as far from the truth as you could possibly be.

The story takes monster movies to the next level.  Without giving away too much, the suggestion is that the Mothman is a kind of sentient being far superior to humans.  Is he warning or just messing with John and the citizens of a small town?

1687275,5,B0000633LO,"The Mothman Prophecies is a throwback to the time when ""horror movie"" didn't actually mean ""Teenage Gore Fest."" I guess the word for it now would be 'thriller,' and thrill it does.

Based on a true story from Point Pleasant, West Virginia in 1967, the Mothman takes place in present 2001, or thereabouts. It's the story of a newspaper reporter who finds himself in said town on his way to interview the governor. There he stumbles across several bizarre occurances; namely repeated sightings by the townsfolk of a not-quite-seen ethereal creature, and how these strange tales seem to intertwine with the reporter's own life.

The director, Mark Pellington (whose directorial credits include the mediocre movie Arlington Road and the music video of ""Jeremy"" by Pearl Jam) has created a mood and a tension in film that I don't think has appeared since The Exorcist in 1973. And he does so without blood, gore, or cheap scares.

And only a PG-13 rating.

Mr. Pellington falls backs on some outdated ""tricks"" like good acting, excellent cinematography, and an absolutely stunning soundtrack. Close-ups of the actors' faces here convey more real terror than in all the Friday the 13th films combined. The musical score sets the mood from scene 1 to the finale; dark and foreboding, tense and pensive. Sound work this good should have earned an Oscar nomination. The camera work is beyond reproach, as well. Sometimes long shots, setting a mood, sometimes jerky, fuzzy, or distorted like a funhouse mirror, all perfect to what needs to be conveyed - - without giving away too much.

The acting, also, is top notch. Richard Gere, Laura Linney, Will Patton, and Will & Grace's Debra Messing all convey a range of emotions not seen in modern day thrillers in sometime.

If there is a flaw to the Mothman Prophecies, it's that the townspeople are too quick to tell a stranger of their paranormal experiences. A moments' hesitation, a shifting away of the eyes, the use of a softer-spoken voice in public would have made the stories and the characters come more alive, and added only a minute or two to the films' overall length.

Counting Memento, this is the second great film I've seen in the past thirteen months. Get it while you can.

1687276,5,B0000633LO,"""The Mothman Prophecies"" is one of those rare films where everything magically 'works' resulting in a magnificent piece of cinematic art.

Richard Gere plays John Klein, a journalist for The Washington Post who is trying to come to grips with the sudden death of his wife. He soon finds himself mysteriously translated to the town of Point Pleasant, West Virginia. He develops a relationship with the sympathetic but skeptical local police sergeant, played by Laura Linney. Klein soon discovers that many of the town's residents have sighted an eerie moth-like entity, similar to the one his wife saw before she died. Deeper investigation causes Klein to have his own creepy encounters with the strange creature; he becomes convinced that the being (or beings) exists on a sphere far beyond humanity's finite comprehension and that it can predict impending calamities. In fact, he comes to realize that this ""mothman"" is trying to warn the small town of one. Can he decipher what specifically the tragedy will be and when it will occure? Can he save his life and his loved ones before it's too late?

""The Mothman Prophecies"" is not a monster movie or a mad-slasher horror flick; it's a creepy supernatural/mystery story with loads of mood & atmosphere. Every element of this motion picture skillfully works -- acting, story, editing, score, cinimatography, locations, effects, etc.

Sensitive viewers will note an undeniable reverent, beautiful quality to the film. The ending is strangely touching.

The notable Amazon reviewer Lawrence Bernabo claims that the mysteries presented in the story are not supposed to be figured out and, indeed, CANNOT be figured out. This is completely untrue. One must understand that this film is brilliantly intricate. Many questions are raised with varying possible answers. Don't think for a second that there are no real answers in this film; they're all there, but you may have to watch it a few times to discover them. I appreciate the fact that the director and writer refused to spell everything out for the viewer, even allowing room for complete misinterpretation. If the viewer wants answers s/he must have ""ears to hear"" and be willing to work for them.

My initial interpretation was that the mothmen are good spiritual beings that are trying to help humankind by predicting great calamities but can be easily misunderstood because they are so far superior to humans. In a nutshell my interpretation was that the ""mothman"" brought Gere to Point Pleasant to meet and save the future replacement for his dead wife, who died due to a pre-existing condition that only the mothman knew about. This explanation obviously suggests that the ""mothmen"" are good in nature.

I've come to see that this interpretation is false; a brilliantly implemented red herring.

***SPOILER ALERT*** (Don't read the following paragraphs unless you want to consider insights into the true nature of the mothmen)

The mothmen are in truth evil spirits, fallen angels or demons (they're synonymous). This is clear when viewing eye-witness drawings of the creatures; these pictures never show beautiful angel-like beings, but rather disturbing, obviously-malevolent winged-creatures.

A mothman (evil spirit) CAUSED the auto accident that injured Debra Messing. Would a GOOD angelic being cause such a tragedy (regardless of the fact that she ultimately dies of a pre-existing problem)?

The bible calls Satan the ""prince of the power of the air,"" hence, his underlings (demons) are spiritual and electro-magnetic in nature. They can thus easily manipulate a traffic light or speak through a phone that's not plugged in. They can even take human form, like the male nurse who insists Debra's drawings are of ""angels"" and then mysteriously vanishes, or mimic the voices of dead loved ones.

The researcher from Chicago reveals that the mothmen are from hell (the spiritual underworld that underpins the earth) and send out mixed messages to ruin peoples lives. They may seem to be benevolently warning humans but, at the same time, are obvious instigators of human tragedies (the car crash, Gordon's job loss, insanity & ultimate demise and the researcher's loss of his family & a respectable social life, etc.). Also consider the fact that they refuse to reveal their true selves and intentions. They are highly skilled masqueraders.

The reclusive researcher also points out that they have been around for a millennia and therefore see things at least 2 or 3 moves ahead of humans; they naturally use this vantage point to manipulate, deceive and destroy.

At the end, the saved police woman, number ""37"" (research that number), is still a victim  in that her previous views that the mothmen are evil and destructive could now flip-flop into the deception that the they are somehow agents of good. Of course we never find out if this happens because the tale potently ends with Gere and Linney in shock sitting in an ambulance just glad to be alive.

The film powerfully illustrates that humanity is caught in a cosmic war and that there are beings whose sole purpose is to ruin or destroy us. Failure to understand and tactically prepare can be fatal. The only true protection from these evil spiritual beings is reconciliation with God through Jesus Christ's blood shield of atonement (not that the picture ever overtly reveals this, it's simply my addendum).

Reporters report what they investigate, so nothing is 100 percent certain in this world, we can listen to evidence, photos, tapes, proof, witnesses, and then conclude what happened based on our own knowledge and judgement, but it doesnt mean something is not true. There is always that possibility, that these things happened, but you definately have to be into this stuff, have an open mind, and have knowledge of the paranormal and phenomena.

1687282,2,B0000633LO,"(Below is my original review after seeing the movie in a theatre.  Since then, I bought it and watched it on DVD.  While I still felt the way I did earlier, I would have added another star or two because on DVD I could review scenes and freeze frames to see some really cool imagery that gets lost in the quick cuts.  There seem to be a lot of mysterious elements that never seem to connect but THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES is still an intriguing and frequently chilling experience that left me wanting me more.  Keep your finger on the freeze button!).

I grew up near where the Mothman was sighted.  Back then (1960-70s), it was only the real nuts who took the Mothman very seriously.  In the wake of all the UFO lit that hit the market then, everyone focused on the Arkansas fishermen who were abducted by tin-foil aliens instead of giant flying monster with big red insect eyes in West Virginia.
The former seemed more plausible, I guess.

I still visit West Virginia every year and it's been fun to see the region embrace the Mothman--with tongue firmly planted in cheek.  I bought a couple of recent books about the Mothman in Parkersburg's wonderful Trans Allegheny Bookstore last visit (they are online).  There is even a Mothman statue in Point Pleasant.

But the movie, which starts out so promisingly with such an excellent cast, can't pull all the spooky supernatural elements together.

Loosely based on the book, THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES, the film takes it's most intriguing ideas and sets up a really cool story about a reporter (Richard Gere) dealing with the death of his wife--and trying to understand some of the other-worldly weirdness of it.  This wasn't a documentary so the filmmakers should've cut loose and took us further into that weirdness.

They should have shown the Mothman.  That they didn't just hurts the movie badly.
The first half does a great job of playing the mystery--but we're still left with just the mystery by the end.  This is a movie.  Give us a pay-off.

The bridge collapse sequence is so unbelievable that, as cool as it is visually, it's actually more difficult to believe than the Mothman by that point.  The real Silver Bridge crashed in about a nano-second.  The real Ohio River, especially in December, doesn't look like the clear water tank they filmed on a backlot.  And nobody could've survived that.  Sorry.

Some really good moments though.  I loved the concepts so much that I wish there had been a couple more drafts of the script to see where it would go.

(My own theory as to why the Mothman sightings stopped after the Silver Bridge disaster: the community had a real tragedy to deal with and they just didn't have time for spooky campfire stories anymore.  But the Mothman is still fun to read about).",1137196800,5,2759,4.672199170124482

1687284,2,B0000633LO,"This film has several things going for it--a moody, atmospheric look and feel; the star power of Richard Gere; solid supporting perfomances by the always-reliable Will Patton & Laura Linney.  But these strengths ultimately fail to elevate ""The Mothman Prophecies"" into a first-rate thriller.  After an intriguing start it becomes increasingly self-important & ridiculous, and closing credits arrive with a sense of relief.

Richard Gere does good work in his first supernatural thriller, as a grieving widower who grows increasingly frantic that he may be losing his sanity.  The bulk of the action is set on the West Virginia-Ohio border in winter, and the bleakness of the landscape mirrors the wintry bleakness that Gere's John Klein feels in his soul.  I could swear that many of the same exterior shots were used in ""Silence of the Lambs""--the production design has a very familiar look.  In order to accept the action of this film as plausible rather than incredulous, however, one has to be able to accept the basic premise--that a giant moth-like creature exists & is able to predict the future.  I had a really hard time doing this, despite the claims that this film was based on actual events that occurred some 40 years ago.  Whether 'Point Pleasant' West Virginia actually exists is easy enough to verify, but unless you are a dedicated believer in the paranormal already, this movie will do nothing to make the existence of such beings more plausible.  Something that is never established satisfactorily:  are the Mothman's intentions toward humans good or ill?  Does he, er, 'it' warn of impeding disaster or cause it?  If its intentions toward man are benign, why does it have such a satanic aspect that causes people to have car accidents or go insane?  Why would a supernatural creature outside of space and time feel the need to communicate through a telephone?

""Mothman Prophecies"" was released the same year as Richard Gere's triumphant performance in ""Chicago"".  Hard to believe.  This movie is a frozen wasteland removed from any Oscar-worthiness, that's for sure.  If a supernatural thriller involving bugs is what you're after, ""Mimic"" delivers a much more satisfactory chill-fest.  After ""Mothman"", ""Mimic"" practically seems realistic, and I never thought I'd find myself saying that!",1131321600,4,2310,5.1310160427807485
1687285,3,B0000633LO,"I am not a skeptic, but I do like to look for the most logical explanations of paranormal events. Skeptics, on the other hand, look for equally preposterous 'real' explanations for stuff that humans perhaps just don't understand.

The Mothman Prophecies is full of mystery and subversion. Some parts of it could be explained, but negated by others. It's far-fetched but directed with such sombre timing that the unbelievable slowly creeps up on you. Ghost stories (yes, I am aware that the Mothman is not a ghost but I don't know what else to call him) are, by their very nature, far-fetched and this is probably why most people are eager to dismiss them. But most people fail to remember that their very existence in this Universe is the most far-fetched thing of all. There is an infinity out there than man does not/will never understand. It's arrogance to think that we've got our world figured out already and dismiss anything that doesn't fit in with our day to day lives.

So yes, I am inclined to believe in stuff like the Loch Ness Monster, Bigfoot, the Skunk Ape and Little Green Men. Like the movie said, the Mothman has appeared in scriptures and literature of many cultures worldwide for thousands of years. Apparently the book on which the movie is based has more stories of strange happenings and info on Indrid Cold (who is probably the most puzzling, enigmatic character since the Mystery Man from Lost Highway), so it's perhaps a good idea to check it out if you were intrigued by the movie.

Director Mark Pellington creates a spooky and haunting Xmas atmosphere and uses the widescreen frame brilliantly. Occasionally he'll throw in a subliminal shot of the Mothman (sometimes obvious, sometimes subtle) or use bizarre imagery to heighten the sense of dread or mystery. It's very well edited and has a lot more class and sophistication than many recent corny PG-13 'horrors' like The Skeleton Key or The Forgotten. In many respects, Mothman is a lot like The Ring in terms of moody atmosphere and cryptic messages. But Mothman, while not a perfect film, is certainly the better of the two.

My main problem is that nothing is really wrapped up. I mean I know it cannot be fully explained because no one knows what the Mothman is or who Indrid Cold was but maybe there was more explained or suggested in John A. Keel's book (the man who Richard Gere's character was based on) than the movie featured.

Overall, it's a pretty good film and I look forward to Mark Pellington's next movie as I've been impressed with his work on this and Arlington Road so far.

1687286,4,B0000633LO,"In the dizzyingly action-packed tradition of ""Spider-Man"" and ""The Hulk"", ""The Mothman Prophecies"" is the fast-paced story of the reclusive Mothman, a gossamer-caped crimefighter who swoops down on the Forces of Evil from his secret underground base in the hills of West Virginia.

OK, OK, I'm kidding. That's not what the movie is about, I just couldn't help myself.

Alright now: ""The Mothman Prophecies"" is a tastily creepy little mood piece that takes hearty helpings of conspiracy theory, precognition, UFO abductions, hauntings from beyond the grave, and Men in Black, throws them in a big cauldron, stirs and seasons with plenty of dark, brooding, atmosphere, and serves it up with a whallop.

And what a whallop! If you're looking for 8-foot tall Mothmen swooping down from the trees and carrying of their screaming victims, then you should look elsewhere, because that's not what this deliciously spooky film is all about. But ""The Mothman Prophecies"" snuck up on me, whalloped me with its unrelenting creepiness, and left me confused, spooked, and wanting more, and really---what more can you ask of a film?

""Mothman"" centers on the strange adventure of its grieving widower hero John Klein (played---erm, affably by Richard Geere), a Washington Post reporter and political analyst. Two years after his wife dies of a brain tumor following a mysterious car accident, he is dispatched to Virginia to interview the governor. Four hours later, his car breaks down on a lonely stretch of rural road, his watch stops, and, afflicted with a strong case of the creeps, he walks up the road to get help at a nearby house.

That's when things in ""The Mothman Prophecies"" take a wonderful little detour for the Strange.

The man who comes to the door of the first house Gere comes to greets him with a surly ""that's him again"" and a shotgun---and seconds later, Gere finds himself huddled inside Gordon Smallwood's (played to distracted perfection by fine veteran character actor Will Patton) shower, held at gunpoint. When policewoman Connie Parker (played inquisitively by Laura Linney) arrives, the shoe drops hard: Gere has been knocking on Smallwood's door for three nights in a row. Oh, and instead of being in the middle of Virginia, he's in Point Pleasant, West Virginia---400 miles from where he should have been.

Director Mark Pellington takes this fine start and just keeps ratcheting up the creepiness from there; not a single second of the film's running time is wasted, and Pellington crafts an atmosphere of impending dread, doom, and general menace. And he's got some good material to draw on: ""Mothman"" is based on the book by John Keel (who wrote the screenplay), which deals with events that actually took place in 1966 in Point Pleasant, West Virginia.

So what do you get for your money? You get roughly 100 minutes of sheer, spooky creepiness, with very little gore---and this movie doesn't need it. When I finished ""Mothman Prophecies"" and crawled into bed, for the first time I noticed just how easily the shadows in my bedroom could cloak---well, something big, something Mothlike. Brrr....

You get Richard Gere, who in this film, anyway, is no great shakes. He has two expressions: Affably confused, or Confusedly affable. But it's alright, and it works for the most part. Laura Linney is a curious choice; sympathetic, but always appearing as if she's on the edge of revealing something. Patton plays his Gordon with a nice broth of simmering paranoia and kookiness, and steals the show. English actor Alan Bates has a hammy turn as Dr. Alexander Leek, who, asked about the mysterious Mothman, contends ""we're not allowed to know.""

But the real star here is the technique used to build up a sense of otherworldly menace: Pellington's strange camera shifts (and kudos also to Fred Murphy, who did the cinematography), half-seen shadowy figures, dizzying aerial shots, cameras that swoop down on their subjects. It all works well, a little too well, in that you're totally keyed up by the film's final credits.

In addition to that, the movie boasts two of the creepiest sequences in terror movie history: try not to have goosebumps when Gere has a whispered phone conversation with the mysterious Indrid Cold, or when, confused and trembling, he waits for a promised phone call from his 'wife'.

This is nasty, shivery stuff---just make sure your nightlight is working for when the film is over.

Is it a good thriller?

Yes, if you're a fan of the genre -and you're a bit patient. If you need something to happen often in a movie not to bore you out, this might be something you should stay away from -personally I found it very intense, well acted and produced. But it is different.",1123545600,5,496,4.32258064516129
1687288,3,B0000633LO,"Mothman supposedly existed and was a creature that scared several people in the 60's. A book was written about the moral and supernatural angles of these sightings. This film is based on that book, not so much the creature itself, and as a result this is not an accurate horror/monster movie but instead a decent but disappointing supernatural thriller.

Having thoroughly read the history of the alleged titular creature, Mothman, I was at first quite disappointed in this film. The real case dealt with people who were supposedly chased by a tall, bird-like man creature with glowing red eyes and incredible speed. The creature did strange things like flying without flapping its wings, and it sounded like a woman screaming. The case, never officially solved, allegedly involved UFOs, although barely a legitimate link to them was made.

Instead of being based on these things, the film is more directly based on a book of the same name, which itself was more of a hypothetical study of what Mothman may mean and represent. A focal point in the film is how the sighting of the monster allegedly preceded disasters. In actuality, the creature was only scantily reported to have been seen around the Ohio river bridge when it collapsed in the late 60s. The film showed this collapse and is its finest scene. But then it adds extra mysterious details to the event, such as Mothman's ability to make people dream such an event before it happened, etc. This is an example of the film being based on the more glamorous ideas in the book instead of focusing on the facts of the case itself, which were far more interesting and would have made for a more frightening movie.

The movie is, however, well done. It takes itself seriously, is well acted, and features very good mood music and ambience. It sets the mood, leading up to some great scenes such as one in which the main character talks with the alleged creature on the phone. It's creepy stuff, but scenes like that are all too rare in this film. It had a lot of promise and was well done, but I had my hopes up for more of a thriller along the lines of the Sixth Sense, which was well written and acted but still had its fair share of visual chills. As it stands, the Mothman Prophecies is good, and I give it credit for getting a lot of facts and references to the actual case correct. But I was hoping for something much more based on the incidents as they were reported, as opposed to an opinionated book that merely theorized what may have really happened. If you liked the movie at all, I suggest you look up the actual Mothman case and see if you're more interested, as I am, in the supposed real-life creature of 60's West Virginia",1112054400,4,2693,4.58298755186722

The atmosphere is well set, lent extra creepiness by the soundtrack by Tomandandy (The end credits song, ""Half Light,"" is especially haunting).

John Klein (Richard Gere), a political reporter for The Washington Post, is respected at work and happily married to the beautiful Mary (Debra Messing). Then everything comes crashing down: Driving at night, Mary swerves to avoid something - John, in the passenger seat, sees nothing - and cracks her head. In the hospital, she's diagnosed with a rare brain tumor, and dies shortly after. Two years later, John is driving to Richmond, Va., to interview an up-and-coming politician, and somehow makes his way to Point Pleasant, a charmless industrial town on the West Virginia-Ohio border, hundreds of miles from his destination. His car breaks down, he has a run-in with a high-strung local (Will Patton) and self-possessed cop Connie Parker (Laura Linney) lets on that odd things have been happening. Sober, level-headed people claim they've seen a man-sized, moth-like creature with piercing red eyes. Telephone lines screech with unexplained static; people are blinded by inexplicable flashes of red light and bleed from their ears and eyes. And their streaky, haunted sketches of the ""mothman"" look unnervingly like drawings Mary made in the days before her death. Klein sticks around to investigate, and begins to believe the mothman is delivering a warning: Something terrible is going to happen in Point Pleasant. But what, and when? Director Mark Pellington - who didn't want to make a monster movie and so keeps the mothman on the periphery - does a bang-up job evoking the jitters, the way you feel when you've spooked yourself. Everyday sounds become eerie and threatening, branches scrape at the edges of the frame, shadows and light flares coil themselves into vaguely disturbing shapes and falling leaves seethe with menace; in fact, for a good part of its running time, the film feels like a portrait of a troubled man willing himself to madness. But the creepy set pieces are repetitive and the payoff is rather unsatisfying, even though the prophecies do eventually pan out (in a typically cryptic sort of way).

  Richard Gere stars as John Klein, a Washinton Post reporter loosely based on Keel himself.  Laura Linney co-stars as the local sheriff, bewildered by the townspeople's reports of the creature and other strange phenomena and by Klein's sudden appearance and seeming connection to events.

  The only disappointing aspect of the movie is that no attention is given to the numerous UFO sightings and encounters with Men in Black that also plagued Point Pleasant during the time of the Mothman.  Having actually visited Point Pleasant, interviewed witnesses, and written a couple of columns on the events, I can testify that they were every bit as much a part of the terror as Mothman himself.  Still, Pellington knows what makes a real horror story work.  There are no blood and guts here; only genuine psychological scares.
  Note:  Mary Hyre, a Point Pleasant newspaper woman, had the same dreams in relation to real events as Laura Linney's character.  Will Patton's character seems based on Woodrow Derenberger, a UFO contactee.  The movie's climax is almost pure fact, with some minor statistical changes, concerning what happened over the Ohio River on December 15, 1967.

Reporter John Klein (Gere)and his wife Mary return from a house they've just made an offer on. During the drive back, Mary (Debra Messing)sees something coming towards her that causes her to lose control of the car and smack her head against the glass of their car. In the hosptial she it's discovered she has a rare form of brain cancer. The chemo and surgery fails to remove it. She dies. When John Klein goes to pick up her things, he discovers a notebook she kept with drawings of what could be the angel of death. He's mystified by it enough to go back to where they had the accident. He discovers a burn on the bumper of his car that resembles what she drew.
Two years later while covering a political campaign Klein has his car break down in Point Pleasant, West Virginia along the Ohio river. The town's people are spooked by strange things they've seen there. one of the residents draws a picture of it. It looks exactly like the pictures Mary Klein made before she died. John becomes obsessed at getting to the bottom of this mystery but his obsession and the mysterious creature take control of his life.
Featuring an outstanding cast (including Will Patton and Larua Linney), solid script and imaginative direction by Mark Pellington (""Arlington Road""), ""The Mothman Prophecies"" captures your attention immediately. It does remind me a bit of some of the thrillers made in the 70's and 80's (although with more stylish direction). The premise requires you to suspend your disbelief quite a bit but, ultimately, the film is a rewarding thriller that doesn't quite answer all the questions it poses. That's a good thing as thrillers with a cookie cutter ending tend to lose their allure very, very quickly.
This ""Special Edition"" comes with a number of lively features. The best feature, though, is Pellington's sharp and witty commentary track. The previous DVD edition was pretty bare bones with a trailer and not much else. We also get a couple of strong featurettes that focus including a great bit that discusses adapting the original book to the screen and the difficulties in translating it.
""TMMP"" causes just enough chills up the spine to make it a perfect Halloween or fright night movie. Pellington's stylish direction keeps you on the edge of your seat even when the story bogs down a bit. Highly recommended.",1089417600,4,2539,4.825688073394495
1687303,5,B0000633LO,"This is seriously the best movie ever made. Y'all totally need to see it & buy it because it is worth three times the money you spend on it.

It's pretty hard to explain & it is pretty hard to understand. The first time you see it & then for like a week afterward you keep thinking about it & you ask yourself questions. & then you see it the second time & you notice some of the hidden symbols. & you watch it the third time & you keep noticing new things & figuring out more and more. I've seen it at least twenty times & i'm sure there's something that i still haven't noticed. I find something new every time i see it.

It has some of the best quotes - just the plain script would be really cool - - just single lines!

Okay - - you can't listen to the people who have bad reviews of this movie - they just didn't get it. It's kind of weird - everybody either totally hates it or loves it. But you have to watch it a few times to really get it. It's still good the first time but you don't get it. It's really awesome because everything ties together & all the things that happened happened for a reason - it wasn't just randomness.

It is pretty scary too. I can't tell about any parts without giving anything away but you'll understand once you see it. It's the kind of movie that you need to think really hard to get.

You have to watch it & look for Y's. I'm afraid of Y's now! & then look for two red dots.

THE VERDICT: Buy it now!!!!

1687304,5,B0000633LO,"This is a cut-down modernized Hollywood version of John A. Keel's famous UFO story and what a wonderful and rich role for Gere who should maybe experiment more in movies that deal with the realms of the unknown! Also the director, Mark Pellington, is very good and deserves more projects like this one.
A much respected reporter for the `Washington Post' - John Klein (Richard Gere) is about to have his life turned upside down when his wife dies in an automobile accident that seems to have been caused by a mysterious flying creature which he never did see himself. The plot takes Gere to the Ohio/West Virginia border where he meets with the local residents who all seem to be having their troubles with strange lights, weird phone calls and a bird like creature which they call the Mothman. Klein investigates the mystery at the cost of his own sanity and career.
The film is very scary but lacks the pace and fiber that made the John A. Keel's book an awe inspiring read. There are no Men In Black, UFO's, alien impregnated women, phone tapings or a clear resolution to some of the character's fate. In fact only about 10% of the book is actually reproduced in the film. The other 90% seems to have been plucked from an episode of the `X-files'... but what a good episode it is! This is a film that has high production values. The lighting, camerawork, sound and editing are always on top form which is something that prevents the movie from disappearing into the ranks of science fiction B-movie hokum. `The Mothman Prophecies' looks simply `weirdly' gorgeous.
There is not enough Mothman revealed to the viewer but country folk Gordon Smallwood (the well cast and superbly acted Will Patton) creates a much needed conduit into the effects that the Mothman has on the people of Point Pleasant and this is what the film is really all about - The consequences that the supernatural can have on the psyche of a small backward town's population. Although the ending is Mothman free it certainly does jolt the emotions and evokes a sort of belittling sympathy for the human beings of this planet.
Watch this film and then go read the book for a much better look at really went on. All in all, the film is a spine-chilling riveting stuff and well worth repeated viewing even though it never truly escapes its `X-Files' feeling.",1085616000,4,2327,4.664233576642336
1687305,5,B0000633LO,"When I read reviews, it seems to me that the movie critics always start off with the possitive and leave the negative stuff for last. This is not always good because as readers, we now have bad stuff fresh in our memory instead of what we really should focus on - yeah you guessed it, the good stuff!
 Well I'm no movie critic; I'm a movie lover. I'll start with the bad stuff, which isn't much.
Richard Gere is a good actor. Although he has certainly aged with dignity, he looks kinda old to be matched up with Debra Messing, who plays his wife. He doesn't look half as young as in that picture on the cover - probably taken in his ""Pretty Woman"" age. Or maybe Debra Messing is too young to be matched up with Gere..., this was just my first impression when I saw the two.
 And to continue bitching, I really wish we could've had a least one more encounter with the Mothman in person before the movie ended. I wanted to see the entity just a little bit more.

 The story of this movie is vaguely based on supposedly real events, if you didn't know that already. This could easily be just another marketing trick, but regardless of the Mothman being real or not, this movie is VERY real and it's scary as hell.
 The Mothman is probably one of most eerie creatures ever created for the movies. He fits right in there with villains like Sadako (of Jap. Ringu trilogy) who seem more like forces of Nature rather than actual entities. This Mothman seems so naturally, innately evil, as he completely destroys the life of every victim he makes contact with. Intentionally or unintentionally, he plays with our senses and emotions, throwing us into a mind corroding half reality.
Whatever the Mothman is, whether he is a ufo, an alien from a ufo, a demon, a ghost, or a banshee, he so totally non-mixable with the physical laws of our ""human"" reality. He is just ""wrong""! Wrong like Oil & Water or 1+1=3.
Simply an abomination, and that is what makes this movie so frightening.

Like director Mark Pellington states, it's a struggle between art and commerce. I don't know how well this movie made it with the box office but in my book, art and commerce equals quality and thus go together inseparably. The shots throughout the movie are truly tasteful. There is thought behind every shot and every transition. You feel the presence of the Mothman in the form of his glowing red eyes, manifesting themselves as paired red lights that come naturally with urban surroundings. The forgotten backlights of parked cars, road maintenance stop signs, even a pair of red light decorated Christmas trees just to name a few examples. Truly ingenious!
 Two other important components that make this movie great are the score and sounds. The constant music pad greatly adds to the feeling of unease, very ""Twin Peaks"".  It becomes almost unbearable with the disturbing Mothman encounters. The sound design match the visual design perfectly, sending cold shivers down your spine as well as making you jump in your seat.  You do NOT want the phone to ring while you watch this movie alone, like I did - and which also happened several times!

That's enough praising for the actual movie.

 This DVD as a product is a lot better than average. Two discs packed with extra features like documentaries and deleted scenes! Who could ask for more, right? The picture and sound is as should be expected. The animated menus fit like a glove, sporting those eerie drawings and the priceless sound pad from the movie.
And yes, His staring eyes are ever present in every menu.

So there you have it. Another great DVD.
Now I have raised your expectations so much that you'll probably be disappointed once you've bought it. To lower those expectations a bit and to compensate, I say...

If it's supposed to be a 'psychological thriller' the psycology part requires at least some logical completion and this movie full of huge holes in the plot.

1687308,2,B0000633LO,"Although I have to admit that as a stand-alone thriller this movie works sufficiently, and deserves it`s three stars, I have to at the same time express my enormous disappointment in the poor pragmatism of this production. As a dedicated fan of cryptozoology, I was expecting something much more authentic and educative, as the movie story claimed to be based on reallife facts and occurances. However, already in the beginning one can sense that something is wrong - ""Mothman prophecies"" is rather not based on a true story, as it only BORROWS a small part of the plot from it! In addition, this movie was obviously intended for Geere in the first place, as he is simply ""here, there, everywhere"" on the screen throughout the whole 1,5 hours it takes. Especially annoying are all those steady close-ups on Geere`s facial expressions, his emotions, charisma ""look how cool I am stuff"" etc. The Mothman depictions are wrong and the creature is always shown in the dark for only a few seconds, wich is extremely annoying. Also, this movie has a great deal of historical flaws and a bit boring way of threatening it`s subject. Here are some of them:
1. ""Mothman was sighted many times after the Chernobyl accident"".
Mothman-sightings /as such/ were never reported in connection with this particular accident in 1986.
2. Mothman was depicted in a strikingly wrong way, looking more like a thin, diabolic gorgoyle. Out of hundreds of reports, this creature DID NOT had any facial detailes, except for it`s huge, red-glowing eyes. It had neither mouth, teeth (!) nor any nose.
3. Mothman did never talked to anyone.
4. The use of internet and the mention of the Chernobyl accident shows clearly that the events should take place in modern times, although we do all know it happened all the way back in 1966-67. A collapsing bridge in Point Pleasants in 2002 looks hereby completely ridiculous.
5. The plot has it that Mothman was a spirit, and it had many apearances, depending on how the people wanted to see it; it could be a human to some, a monster, or a ghost to others. Yet Mothman appeared more or less in a same way for hundreds of those who saw him, and he was obviously NOT a spirit!
6. The claim that Mothman left particular moth-like signs burned into the trees or vehicles on the places it was sighted, and that some of the people who saw it developed extremely rare brain-tumors, is totally false.
7. Also, the fact that Mothman was seen as a spirit with a strong connection to the main character of the movie, makes it`s characteristic sightings for totally casual people obsolete, and boring.
All in all a very disappointing scene from an authentical point of view, and I do hope sincerely that a new, much more realistic, creepy and entertaining movie about Mothman would be realeased in the near future.",1081468800,2,2815,4.746938775510204

Second, this creepy thriller is best watched at night in a dark room with a friend. If you choose to watch it alone, you may want to shut the window curtains for fear of seeing two red eyes staring at you.

1687310,4,B0000633LO,"The best advice I can give to anyone who has never seen this film about these strange, supernatural events, is to suspend your disbelief.  I'm an Agnostic, so I'm sort of in the middle when it comes to unexplained phenomenons.  I'm both skeptical and willing to accept that there are things in this universe that will be forever unexplained.  I've actually had a bonafide experience with precognition, so I suppose I'm less skeptical than others.  This story deals with sightings of an Angel of Death type figure that appears and tells certain individuals of catastophic events before they happen.  For what it's worth, I have a slight understanding of the strangeness that one feels when something revealed the day before comes to pass soonafter.  I'll relate my own story for credibility.  I went to bed knowing that I was going to the dog track the following afternoon.  That night I had a dream about a sequence of numbers 1-3-8, 3-1-8, 8-1-3, and so on.  But in my dream the numbers appeared in no certain order.  You can guess what happened at the track the very next day.  It happened in the very first race.  There are three judges at the bottom of the race form who predict which dogs will come in and in what order, and they all picked 1-3-8 in varying sequences.  I thought, ""What the hell, I'll bet on a trifecta. There's no way I'm gonna win, anyway.  That would be too bizarre.""  Being uncertain of the sequence, I boxed the trifecta, which means the dogs can come in any order and I win.  They came in, and I won over 50$.  That may not be life or death, but it made me look at the world a little differently afterwards.  Wow, listen to me ramble.  Richard Gere is very good here, and Laura Linney pitches in here and there with another solid performance.  The ending is both eerie and expensive.  I know where half the budget went.  My primary complaint with the film is that the sound is up and down.  I frequently had to turn the volume up as the actors whispered or their voices were drowned in the score.  The score needed to be more in the background when the actors spoke, and the sound man should have been fired.  Some of the dialogue sounds like mumbling, or midway through speaking, background noise washes out key words and I was left wondering what was said.  For hard-bitten skeptics this movie is nothing more than a glorified X-files.  For those who live and breath the supernatural this should be a geniune experience.

1687311,4,B0000633LO,"With ""based on a true story"" as a slugging slogan, THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES flew onto big screens to an expectant audience packed with wide-eyed thrill-seekers.  While the MOTHMAN may not have fluttered along as rapidly as many may have hoped, thrills, chills and trepidation certainly weren't swatted out of the tension-filled air.  Rather, suspense was the stylish sensation of the evening.
  The basic synopsis of the story revolves around a moth-like creature that started showing up in Point Pleasant, West Virginia making predictions about terrible things to come.  When the dreary forecasts began coming true, the townsfolk started to get more than a little worried.  A writer for the Washington Post wound up mysteriously in the not-so-sleepy settlement and started asking questions, like any good journalist should.  Well, the answers he found fly his mind in the face of terror.

  For many reasons, THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES more than adequately fulfilled its role as a thriller.  It was scary, it made the spectators jump, and the story kept the audience guessing but wasn't more ludicrous than any mystery/horror flick should be.  One spooky aspect involved THE MOTHMAN itself.  Though you never really get a good shot of the star specter, drawings and rough sketches that depict THE MOTHMAN were anything but jolly.  Meanwhile, the static/voice gibberish of the creature was something you would never want to hear on the end of the telephone line.  The camera effects used to simulate what the ghoul is ""seeing"" are eerie and effective.  Cheesiness was left on the fly swatter, and the clichd concept of corny doesn't factor into this spookster.  It was like a good episode of THE X-FILES.
  While the account was ""based on a true story,"" many elements were added and distorted to create something more Hollywood for the kids at home. Unlike typical thrillers, however, this story manages to somehow keep you wondering what will happen next or what the point of THE MOTHMAN's predictions is.  Why does the phantom act as a harbinger of terror at all?  This question stays on your mind throughout the flick and is answered and unanswered in very class fashion.
  In THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES, Director Mark Pellington (ARLINGTON ROAD) exploited the same duo of Richard Gere and Laura Linney that Director Gregory Hoblit used in the legal/psychological thriller PRIMAL FEAR also co-starring Edward Norton.  In MOTHMAN, Gere (PRIMAL FEAR; FINAL ANALYSIS; AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMEN) starred as the grieving widower and Washington Post Journalist John Klein.  His search for answers and especially his evolving emotional and psychological state were the drive behind this movie.  Laura Linney was crucial as the voice of reason and as the amorous distraction that kept the horror of THE MOTHMAN from dominating the picture.  Gere and Linney made a fantastic combo by convincing the crowd that there is an honest bit of romance between them, an essential and rare factor in films these days.
  For the most part, THE MOTHMAN completed the mission.  It was scary and intriguing.  However, there were a few unanswered questions that might make some kids a little skeptical.  Also, the validity of this MOTHMAN and its premonitions was incredulous at times.
  Overall, the film was a winner.  The movie-lovers might not be returning to theaters time and time again for double-takes, but they'll probably rent it on DVD in a few months and recommend it to their friends.  The fear factor necessary for any good suspense thriller is more than prevalent.  And, THE MOTHMAN  is just mysterious enough to make you want to get a 10-foot bug zapper for the back porch.",1077840000,2,3659,5.05685618729097

I won't go into the merits of the story according to what happened in Point Pleasant in the 1960s and the director's idea of setting the story today instead of the 1960s, and what the movie is versus the book it's based on.
What I'll say is what a TOTAL knockout THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES is, visually and aurally. I've watched this movie several times now and it gets better with each subsequent viewing. This film is totally brilliant. The cinematographer, editor and the sound effects folks have really created something amazing. I love watching THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES just for the overall look and sound, thanks mainly to the super sharp image on the DVD, which is breathtaking, and the incredible intricate soundscape heard throughout the movie. This is one of the best looking films I've ever seen. And the music score (by Tomandandy) and the sound effects are really effective.
Gere, Laura Linney and Will Patton all give credible and powerful performances. And Mark Pellington's direction is laser sharp, understated and smart. The overall creepy feeling this movie creates is golden, for those who prefer to be creeped out rather than hit on the head with sledgehammer-style scare tactics.",1074124800,4,1298,4.958715596330276

My excitement waned however after the first 30 minutes of sitting through this 2 hour version of an X-Files episode. Aside from a decent bridge collapse scene, I saw absolutely nothing that set it apart, and there was probably better acting on the X-Files. Gere didn't really lend anything to this movie (beside his name) that any other actor couldn't have done. And Debra Messing gave an unconvincing job as a feature actress. At the end of the film, I'm not even sure why she was in it, or what her character's role was.

The ""Mothman"" wasn't very scary or very interesting, and i couldn't tell if I was supposed to be more concerned over possible future prophecies or the lead character's mental state.

I was left watching a film that was so so, and with a lot of questions that the movie left unexplained. Fortunately, I wasn't interested enough in the film to care.

A movie like this should leave you wanting more. I should have finished the film and rushed to the Internet to find out more about the real life sightings and what exactly happened.

I believe if you have some knowledge of the strange events known as The Mothman sightings, you may find this movie more entertaining. Particularly the events occurring in Point Pleasant. If you do not know the legend, you may be lost while viewing this film. Since I cannot possibly explain the entire ""legend"" in this review. I recommend doing an internet search for ""The Mothman""... or... ""Silver Bridge Disaster"".
A quick summary as follows. In 1966, in Point Pleasant, West Virginia,  a bridge spanning the Ohio River collapsed. Many people died when their cars plummeted into the Ohio River or the Ohio River banks. This is documented fact. The name of the bridge was Silver Bridge.
The events that happened PRIOR to the collapse of the bridge is where this event gets truly bizarre.
The story begins with journalist John Klein driving through the night to discover that he has blacked out and ended up hundreds of miles away from his intended destination. He ends up in Point Pleasant. The community of Point Pleasant is plagued with  strange encounters from  a giant winged humanoid, and the  townspeople are have disturbing precognition of disasters. The people have nicknamed the creature  THE MOTHMAN because of his wings and eyes.
Actual police reports were made concerning the strange sightings of The Mothman.
Most of the people who made the police reports met their doom on the Silver Bridge.
Was The Mothman some kind of messenger of death? Or was he trying to warn the people?
Draw your own conclusions.
There is a book titled ""The Mothman Prophecies"" which was written in the early seventies detailing the journalist's adventures in Point Pleasant. I recommend the book as well as an internet search to learn more about these bizarre events. There are also message boards on the internet where survivors of the bridge disaster and their relatives post messages to eachother. Happy Hunting!",1068508800,4,2050,4.913294797687861

The original events, some consider them real others a hoax, took place in 1966, the movie updates the story to 2002 and adds it's own spin on things. This would be fine if the script had been crafted a little better, but instead it wanders around in circles. Plot points are never fully connected or even explained, and we never even get a good look at the Mothman which makes us wonder, why is it even called the MOTHMAN? The photography however, is really well-done and has a nice, mysterious look, like in the early X-Files episodes, but while the material is well-directed, it seems like a puzzle without solutions. At least the original book has it's own explanations, and no matter how out of this world they might seem, they are still explanations. In the film for example, Richard Gere's wife dies as a result from a car crash they were involved in soon after spotting the Mothman, and she begins to draw visions of the creature on paper, ok, interesting. But later in the film no connection is established between her death and the Mothman, in fact, nothing connects in this movie. What exactly are the Mothman Prophecies? The movie has been compared to The X-Files, but The X-Files has always had a continuing thread through-out it's plots and ideas, Mulder is always trying to prove that aliens exist and the government is trying to cover it up, but in ""The Mothman Prophecies"" all we get is a heartbroken widower who gets weird phone calls from a husky voice.

1687319,5,B0000633LO,"If you loved the ""X-Files"" at its best, or films such as ""The Sixth Sense"" or ""The Others"" which placed a premium on creepiness and ""playing with your mind"", and a minimum on blood and gore, then I can virtually guarantee that you'll like ""The Mothman Prophecies"". This movie is an updated version of a classic 1975 book which told the supposedly true story about a series of bizarre and frightening events in the little river town of Point Pleasant, West Virginia in 1966 and 1967. Richard Gere (who I thought gave a good performance, unlike some of the other posters here) plays John Klein, a successful and happily-married political reporter for the Washington Post. One cold evening he and his gorgeous wife Mary (Debra Messing of TV's 'Will and Grace') go to view a house in the DC area that they're planning to buy. On the way back to their current home Mary is driving in a residential area on a deserted street when she is shocked to see a huge ""man-monster"" with wings and glowing red eyes flying straight at their car. John doesn't see the creature, but Mary loses control of the car, they wreck, and she is injured. At the hospital John receives more bad news - Mary has brain tumor and is going to die. After her death he finds a notebook in which Mary has written the word ""RUIN"" over and over, and has done dozens of chilling drawings of the creature she saw. A couple of years later Klein, still grieving over his wife's death, takes what appears to be a routine trip on the interstate to Richmond, Virginia to interview the state's governor. On the late-night trip he seems to ""doze off"" for a few seconds, and when he comes to he's no longer on the interstate but a backwoods country road near Point Pleasant, West Virginia - hundreds of miles from his previous location a few moments earlier. His car suddenly dies, and he is forced to walk for help. I won't give away anymore of the plot, but I will say that the characters he meets in Point Pleasant are all very well-played. Among them are Will Patton, who plays a troubled but basically decent man who is slowly being driven insane by the bizarre ""Mothman"" creature which keeps haunting him at night. Laura Linney is an attractive and down-to-earth deputy sherriff who helps John investigate the ""Mothman"" sightings in Point Pleasant. Over time she finds herself becoming attracted to him - and becoming increasingly frightened at the supernatural events in her hometown and John's growing obsession with them. Alan Bates gives a perfectly creepy performance as a reclusive college professor in Chicago who knows far more about the ""Mothman's"" real identity and motivations than he's willing to admit (at least at first). Those who watch the ""Mothman Prophecies"" expecting to see the creature are in for a disappointment, as he only appears VERY briefly in a few moments of the film - yet this is what gives the ""Mothman Prophecies"" its chills. By limiting the creature's screen time (at one point the ""Mothman"" tells Klein over the phone that it can appear to be whatever the individual person viewing it wants to see), it covers the entire movie with an awful sense of foreboding - a sense that something is not quite right in Point Pleasant - and that things are building towards a terrible climax. This ""Special Edition"" DVD set features the superb ""Searching for the Mothman"" documentary which aired on the FX cable channel just before the movie's release. It features commentary by paranormal researcher John Keel, who wrote the classic 1975 book upon which the movie was based. It also has interviews with Point Pleasant residents who claim they saw the ""Mothman"" back in 1966 and 1967. In many ways this movie plays like a high-budget, high-quality ""X-Files"" episode. If your idea of a ""scary movie"" is to see lots o' blood and gore, then you should NOT buy this movie! However, if you enjoy films which prove that what's not shown is sometimes far scarier than what is shown, then the ""Mothman Prophecies"" will have you looking over your shoulder for a very long time.

The movie tells the story of a reporter who loses his wife after they are in a car accident as a result of her seeing a mysterious being. He goes on assignment shortly thereafter and stumbles, very much by mistake and very mysteriously, on the town of Point Pleasant, West Virginia to discover that many people there have been seeing the same thing his wife described before she died.
The story comes together beautifully with great acting. It will definitely give you goosebumps and may have you freaking out every time you see a moth that mysteriously got into your room when all the doors and windows were shut. When you consider the fact that it is based on a true story, it makes it all the more chilling.

Line up a group of good actors, give them a pointless plot and dull dialogue, film them in scenes that are ALL RED or ALL BLUE or ALL BLACK--and what do you have?
The Mothman Prophecies, a suspense movie without suspense, without interesting characters, without clarity, without a coherent plot, without coherent symbolism, but WITH oodles of odd camera-angles and murky colors to make you think something is going on.
Alas.
Nothing is.
One small, typical example.  Richard Gere tells Laura Linney (a cop) about the near-hallucinatory visions of another character.  ""I had a dream like that,"" she portentously replies; then proceeds to tell the dream, and they show it (All Blue and All Black), and it has no likeness whatever to the other guy's visions--they hit you over the head with the idea that it's a prediction.",1053388800,6,848,4.881944444444445
1687331,4,B0000633LO,"I like a director who knows what to do with his images, and Mark Pellington surely fits in this category. Also, as previously stated in ""Arlington Road"", Pellington knows how to build tension from sparse and even simple facts. ""The mothman prophecies"" has an interesting premise, but the viewer has to be patient not to turn the dvd-player off after one hour of the movie.
Two years after his wife's death, following a bizarre car accident and a rare brain tumor, John Klein (Richar Gere) is inexplicably drawn to little Point Pleasant, a small town where people are seeing strange things, things that resemble very much the death-angel-like drawings his wife made during her final stay at the hospital. As a reporter and as an interested part in the mistery, John Klein will do everything to try and discover what's really going on in Point Pleasant.
The first hour of the movie is really good. It reads like something out of the X-files. Also, it's scarier because it's supposedly based on true facts. Mark Pellington was right on spot when he established, from the very beginning, that ""The mothman prophecies"" was really made on supernatural foundations. If the viewers were left looking for a rational explanation for the facts displayed on the movie, it would be extremely wrong and deceiving. The images, complemented by a dark and moving sound score, are effective in making the viewer in the edge of his seat. And the usual good performances by Will Patton and excellent Laura Linney give credibility to the story. After the first hour and the establishment of the ""mothman"" entity, the movie looses its pace. It kind of drags on until Richard Gere's character finally discovers the truth and the movie moves on to the final scene, which is in fact very well produced and thrilling.
""The mothman prophecies"" is a very effective thriller, based on good visuals and an interesting story, and should deserve five stars. But the boring 30 minutes after the first hour took one star away.

When Richard Gere's wife, Debra Messing, sees the moth, mysterious circumstances ensue which subsequently lead to her death.  Pining for her, Gere eventually loses his mind and meets up with a new love interest, Laura Linney in an attempt to uncover the truth.  While the plot may sound plausible it proves disappointing.
The female characters are seriously underdeveloped with only a brief cameo with Debra Messing.  Gere seems to get all the action.

I, English speaking from birth, had to turn on the subtitles to know what they were mumbling about. Very frustrating.

1687335,5,B0000633LO,"Like Disney's Hunchback of Notre Dame, The Mothman Prophecies is a film to enjoy in and of itself.  Comparison to the book does the movie a disservice, and in no way is this film an historical accounting of the seemingly mysterious events that occurred in Point Pleasant West Virginia in the late sixties.  But as a fictional tale, it is well-told, thought-provoking, original and suspenseful.
Consider first the actual events of Point Pleasant; a series of recent articles in the Skeptical Inquirer responding to renewed interest created by the film indicate that the Mothman himself was likely a large barn owl, that the mysterious phone calls were hoaxes by ""UFOlogist"" Gray Barker, and that the bridge collapse was entirely unrelated to those events.  John Keel, author of the book The Mothman Prophecies, described very few of the events of the movie.  There was no Washington Post reporter, no wife with a brain tumor and prophetic visions, no inexplicable 6 hour drive taken in one hour, no mysterious visits by a doppelganger, no visits from the dead--the list goes on and on.  But for all this, we should be grateful; the reality of the case is apparently so mundane that no film purporting to be a truthful depiction of the facts could have been of interest.
Where the film succeeds is in its willingness to create a new story, a story that evokes the supernatural in so many ways--through cinematography, visual design, and music in addition to plot.  What actually happens is never entirely clear--while other reviewers find this a fault, it seems to me wonderfully appropriate when dealing with worlds beyond our normal perception.  It is in this respect that the film becomes outstanding, in seeking to ""explain that which is beyond explanation"" several thought provoking ideas emerge.  We are never sure whether the Mothman is devil or angel, whether he comes to give warning or to create disaster, whether he is a creature of power or insignificance.  To help create this uncertainty we never actually see the Mothman, although we are treated to verbal descriptions, drawings by witnesses, and haunting near-glimpses.  Is the Mothman to us like we are to the cockroach, and any attempt to communicate doomed to fail?  Or is the creature of no greater power than we are, but simply living in a different perspective through which it can apprehend our world more clearly than we do ourselves?  Viewers desiring answers to these questions will be disappointed, as will those looking for great special effects or a horrifying monster--I feel certain that these were the cause of the lack of box-office success.  But for those looking for something unusual, suspenseful and stimulating, with a terrific look, good acting, a great script and music, I highly recommend The Mothman Prophecies.",1042156800,8,2801,5.023758099352052
1687336,5,B0000633LO,"The real roots of this film almost seem to be more about GRIEF and LOSS, wrapped around the element of supernatural mystery.

This is why the film works as well as it does.

The sci-fi element is cut almost completely, except for a few hardly noticable brief snippets-they ran out of money to film a sequence where much of the town gathers at the cement plant to watch mysterious things happening in the sky, which I would presume, as in the novel- UFOs putting on a dramatic and eerie display above.

In many ways the Mothman almost plays second fiddle to Kleins grief and longing for his dead wife-exploited in mysterious and unfathomable ways by Indrid Cold.

These beings come from a world where ordinary rules of logic don't apply.

And as the late Alan Bates notes-""Their motives aren't human.""

It is especially chilling when he offers the coda to his and John's final conversation of knowing WHY: ""Were not supposed to know""

Interestingly, each character has a variabley played musical cue/theme:

Mary, before the auto accident and later, twice, as her photo becomes the center of the screens attention.

And then Connie, both in revealing to John her dream, and as John rescues her from her submerged vehicle.

And then there is the menacing, eerie Mothman theme, first heard as Mary goes under the CAT-scan in the hospital.

All of these have very deep emotional impact and meaning, at least to myself.

In the scene where John finally 'gets' that he is being toyed with, and that his wife is really gone, pulling the phone from the wall, Mary's cue is played a final time, and as her picture is closed in upon, in the background we hear the flapping of wings, and a deep sigh, as if to signal closure, and that Cold/Mothman is moving on, finished toying with Klein, and perhaps the sigh is signalling that Mary's soul is finally at rest.

Later, as the bridge collapses, if you listen closely, you can hear her tell John to ""Jump"" as John watches Connie's SUV sink underwater-as if telling John to finally let go, and move forward to rescue his new friend, companion, and possibly more-we never know for sure.

I like the way that Connie and Johns romance is implied and grows, and is not obviously displayed as is usually done in Hollywood movies-and you know by the end, as they lean on each other in blankets, that John has finally fully let go of Mary for Connie-but after this is left open-ended.

And Will Patton gives an under-appreciataed perfomance as a simple, working class-man coming into contact with elements he cannot fathom, and seemingly a friendship with a much more sophisticated and worldly man of status-Klein.

In this situation they are equals, under the spell of Mothman-and at a loss as to know what this means to them.

Lucinda Jenny has almost cameo appearences, but her Hospital hallway scene is remarkable, as is the grief she shows as the ambulance takes her husbands body away.

Laura Linney plays her part in such a way that we see very clearly her sincerity, sensibility, and her general unselfish lovingness.

First time viewers may not notice, but the ""Y"" motif signifying the Mothman is a little over the top as once or twice would have been fine-it reminds me of watching the 1960's BATMAN on TV, as a swirling logo spins onscreen, and an announcer intones excitedly: ""Meanwhile, back at the Batcave.....!""

OR maybe there is a conection...

The closing of the film was remarkable-there were to ""final"" explanations, or character resolves, as in a typical Hollywood movie.

It simply shows John and Connie dazed, but safe from the disaster-and surely bonded in a very strong way, as the camera pulls back from the chaos.

Thats it-no loose ends are tied up-like in real life-which may confuse viewers used to being led around, or TOLD what is happening..

They filmed two versions of the last minute of the film-and chose the ending for those with red-state IQ's.

Anyone with an attention span should have picked up on that as the Chief tells John that 36 are dead, we know that Connies 'Wake up #37' dream has come to pass-no need to hit us over the head with it.

The opening and closing music by the group Low, and the score by 'TomandAndy' are also remarkable.

1687340,3,B0000633LO,"The Mothman Prophecies (Mark Pellington, 2002)
Mark Pellington (Arlington Road) once again delivers a movie chock full of potential with just enough annoying traits to make it frustrating. Unfortunately, in this case, the main frustrating trait is the framework itself-the whole Mothman thing, which in the end IS nothing more than a framework. The movie is really about John Klein (Richard Gere) attempting to get over the death of his wife Mary (Debra Messing, from the wonderful, underrated TV series Prey) and fall in love with Point Pleasant sheriff Connie Parker (Laura Linney, previously teamed with Gere in Primal Fear). Never mind that both Messing and Linney are about twenty years younger than the dirty old man...
Had that been the main thrust of the movie, it would have been brilliant. Gere gives a stunning performance here as a guy coming gradually unhinged by his inability to get over the death of his spouse. But weaved throughout this love triangle is a whole lot of supposedly supernatural stuff, none of which makes all that much sense (and none of which, of course, is ever resolved-after all, this is ""based on true events"" that were never resolved, either).
If you go into this thinking of it as a love story gone horribly awry, you may be able to get as much as I did out of it. If you're looking for an atmospheric thriller, you'd do well to look elsewhere. ** ",1038873600,3,1388,4.783333333333333

A ""Mothman"" is delivering messages to certain people in a small town but it actually seems to be mocking them. Why? Because the creature only bestows so much information, just enough to make them realize a horrible accident was predicted AFTER it already occurs. But that's not the creepy part, my friends, oh no.
Richard Gere's character is haunted by his dead wife throughout the film, creating a very subtle, yet very evil feeling during the whole viewing process.  There is also a very terrifying scene where his dead wife comes to...how should I put it...pay her dear hubby a little visit! It gives me goose bumps just thinking about it.
Generally, I do not like Richard Gere but I must say he does a very good job in this film.  If it's the eery, spooky kind of horror you seek, this is the perfect place for you to stop and take a peek(wow, that ryhmed).

1687342,3,B0000633LO,"Though ""Mothman Prophecies"" claims that the film is based on true events, which happened in Point Pleasant, West Virginia in 1966-67, you should quickly forget that idea as soon as you start watching it.  The film is eerie, to be sure, but its eerieness sometimes goes beyond the most outrageous episodes of ""X-Files,"" reaching nearly the edge of pretenciousness.  However, that doesn't mean this film is not worth watching.
As other reviewers have explained, I make my summery of the story short.  Richard Gere is Washington Post journalist John Klein, whose wife saw something weird before their car accident.  Two years later, John finds himself in Point Pleasant as if drawn to the place, to know that there are things going on among that peaceful town by the river.  And John himself is about to witness the phonomena very soon.
Before you watch, remember this.  The director chooses wisely not to expose the key figure of ""Mothman"" too much.  It is revealed with indirect ways -- like sketches and witnesses -- and you may be disappointed its vagueness.  But that is the point the director and Gere are making.
And under the rather slow and ordinary development of story, there are many things that are really strange.  The sound used here is quite unique, sometimes sounds like David Lynch-like noise, and sometimes like ethnic music.  But the most impressive part is its subliminal effects -- I cannot reveal this part too much, but look close some part of the images on the screen, which would be later return in another form.  Or, one alphabet repeatedly shows up at the crutial moments of the film.  Even the lights of cars seem to have some meaning at the end....
But, these ""subliminal"" parts can be damaging, too, because, after all, the basic idea is as realistic as that of MIB and Loswell.  Of course, many people believe them, but I didn't happen to be one of them.  In that case, the whole picture might look superficial just as the director's previous work ""Arlington Road.""  Yes, it was shocking, but do you believe in the whole story?
About acting, there is no problem at all.  Maybe you don't buy the idea of Gere playing an ace journalist (and he is getting more and more nervous), but I find he is very good and convincing.  Laura Linney as a local cop is also good, but they are both helped greatly by underrated Will Patton, who gives authentic feeling to the very unbelievable story.
The film offers much, but the weakness of the story is undeniable.  Or, I should say, if you don't get hooked by the basic idea about prophecies in general, you just don't like the result.",1036281600,3,2600,4.68942731277533

Director Mark Pellington is quoted as saying he didn't want to make a monster movie. He wanted to strip out the melodrama and leave the audience with unanswered questions. I believe Pellington has succeeded beyond his expectations.
""Mothman"" is definitely not your usual supernatural horror picture. Nor is it a slice 'n dice horror movie. In fact, there is very little violence in this picture.
So, then, is it scary? Yes, definitely. The entire movie gives off an aura, an atmosphere of wrongness, of something about to happen, of hold-your-breath terror. And it often fulfills that promise, leaving the audience gasping as that something does, suddenly, happen.
The movie is loosely based on events that took place in Point Pleasant, West Virginia in 1966 and 1967. Dozens of people reported sighting this tall, red-eyed creature they dubbed The Mothman. UFO sightings became more frequent. Cattle mutilation, mental telepathy, mysterious visits from Men in Black, all these took place in this peaceful little corner of West Virginia.
It all culminated with the collapse of the Silver Bridge between Kanauga, Ohio and Point Pleasant, West Virginia. The filming of that scene must have been something to see. The collapse happens at night, and the car lights on the bridge, and, later, shining up through the water, cast an eerie halo around the entire scene.
During the strange events at Point Pleasant, a reporter, John Keel, became deeply involved in the mysteries. Later he wrote a book ""The Mothman Prophecies"" about his strange adventures with the people and the events of the town. The movie evolved from Keel's book.
Richard Gere as reporter John Klein, does a great job portraying a man haunted by guilt and grief over his wife's death. Laura Linney as Connie Parker plays the new love interest. Debra Messing plays the deceased wife, Mary, and makes a startling post-death appearance.
The Mothman? We catch occasional glimpses, brief tastes of the sheer terror and mystery of this being that is -- what? This is one of the questions left unanswered. Just who or what is this Mothman?
I think Mark Pellington, his actors and his crew have done a fantastic job in bringing this strange story to the screen. The use of music helps to intensify the anticipation of approaching terror. Much of the picture, including the collapse of the Silver Bridge, takes place in darkness, again increasing the audience's uneasiness.
Did I like ""The Mothman Prophecies?"" Without a doubt, as did the three people who attended the movie with me. Would I recommend it to others? Well, if you enjoy a movie about something -- not quite right, if you enjoy a movie that leaves you perched on the edge of your seat, if you enjoy a movie that will stay in your mind long after you leave the theater, then yes, I do recommend ""The Mothman Prophecies."" It's well worth the price.",1036195200,2,3115,4.868173258003766
1687344,5,B0000633LO,"This is a very good film, you don't feel like you are watching a movie, you feel like you are watching and experiencing REAL LIFE; the audience is robbed of the safety of being detached -- it could be happening to you--- its the very first film to show the real supernatural war going on behind the scenes all over the world today. Read the other reviewers to get the rough outline of the film plot if you haven't seen it.
The evil beings haunting our world called the ""Mothmen"" in this story could also be termed ""evil electro-magnetic beings or ""EEMBs"" --the excellent scene where a voice analysis shows that the voices are NOT HUMAN has to be one of the most disturbing ever portrayed on film. Throughout the film, the EEMBs flagrantly speak through telephone receivers plugged in or not--and masquerade perfectly the voices of humans to set them up for their demise. Modern society is increasingly electronic and vulnerable to electromagnetic evil beings to sabotage cars, speak through phones, crash airplanes etc. For starters, EEMBs cause the traffic accident that eventually kills Gere's beloved wife.
People today do not see that the world is out to get them--they think the world is ""neutral"" and thus are tactically ill-equipped to defend themselves from supernatural attacks. Consider the principal victims who are mentally attacked by appearances of the thoroughly terrifying Mothman before the final fatal bridge incident: Policewoman played by Laura Linney, pre-marital sex couple, alcoholic plant worker and Gere's character -- a careerist, self-absorbed yuppie dink (Double Income, No Kids).  All are vulnerable to EEMB attack by their lifestyles -- no protection from God and Jesus Christ under the blood shield of atonement. At no point during these supernatural attacks do the townspeople turn to the Bible/God for help. EEMBs can even take human form/appearance: the male nurse in hallway, who vanishes after saying Gere's wife saw ""angels"" is later explained by an excellent prompting scene when Gere sees an outline in a run-down building that free association alerts him that the male nurse was not a human but a/the ""Mothman"" (ie: EEMB). The wife, terminally ill from a brain tumor played by Debra Messing who was seeing and drawing so-called ""angels"" reveals the EEMB's lie/deception since her art shows evil malevolent fallen angels.
Gere's missing time while driving alone long after his wife's death results in him appearing in West Virginia - this common UFO/ET phenomena presents the likely possibility that earthly attacks are linked to the same common EEMB instigators. Also note that in rural areas -- people in isolation are more vulnerable to EEMB attacks. This holds true for UFO/ET sightings/abductions. Mothman = EEMB = demons = prince of the power of air's underlings = symbol is self-destructive moth/flame being. Implications: ghosts, ETs, reincarnated being episodes can easily be convincing masquerades to deceive humans by EEMBs who can perfectly mimic human voices/personalities since they have plenty of time to observe and have the powers to do this.
Most important scenes: Gere meets Mothman researcher -- he reports the evil beings are sending mixed signals -- they sometimes warn but also seem to also be the instigators of human tragedies -- will not reveal selves/true intentions --the researcher elaborates that the Mothmen have been around forever and throughout human history and thus see life at least 2-3 moves ahead of humans; his window washers-on-a-skyscraper-seeing-an-auto-accident-before-it happens analogy is a very good explanation of how these evil ""prophecies"" can sometimes come true.
The film shows several layers of malfeasance -- if you act on prophesies -- it destroys the respectable social life of the human conveyer -- if lives are saved the messenger buys into the validity of evil being's false representations and quasi-goodness. The Mothman phones Gere and tells him to wait for a call from his wife the next day at noon. Minutes before the call, the policewoman gives a fatalistic speech about how people are going to die and there is nothing we can do about it etc etc. but does reveal one kernal of truth -- that the phone call Gere is set to receive ain't gonna be from his wife! She remarks; ""where she is he (the caller masquerading her voice) is not"" -- ie; she's in heaven, he's from hell. Her prior precognitive dreams from EEMBs are elaborate mind screws; she's a single woman unguarded by a male in a very demanding male protective role -- making her very vulnerable --she is outmatched by events throughout the film, but she could have a protector in Gere if he wants the job.
However, the rest of the humans are still 1-2 moves behind the Mothmen and are not thinking tactically-- when the evil beings sabotage traffic light on bridge, stalling vehicles on bridge over-stresses support beams causing bridge to collapse, people are naive to blindly follow easily sabotaged traffic light rather than think on their own. Again, humans not realizing that forces are out to get you. Finally, Gere acts courageously at least 1 step ahead of the others around him and dives into water to save the policeman. However the ""wake-up 37"" message from the electromagnetic evil beings mock God whose two numbers are 3 and 7. The saved policewoman,  ""37"" is still victim in that her previous fatalistic views could now flip-flop into a buy-in to the validity of evil electromagnetic beings somehow being agents of goodness. We don't know because the movie ends with Gere and Linney in shock sitting in an ambulance glad to just be alive.
If you want to be scared, this is the film to do it because its talking about reality not fantasy, but I do not recommend it unless you are certainly under the aegis of Biblical Christianity and the Lord Jesus Christ.",1035676800,4,5833,5.018575851393189
1687345,2,B0000633LO,"As Shakespeare might have said - this film is full of sound and fury, but ultimately signifies nothing.
In order to understand this film to best effect - like why there are two Christmas trees in the hospital, and why we keep seeing rows and loops of multicoloured lights - you really need to watch the 'Special Features' before you watch the main feature. Apart from over-using the contents of the basic trailer, these ""extras"" are genuinely interesting, useful and relevant.
The basic problem with the whole project, as far as I could tell, was that any attempt to raise the film to a metaphysical level (listen to the comments by Richard Gere (star), Will Patton (lead support) and Mark Pellington (director) in the Interviews feature) was effectively kyboshed by the need to produce what somebody thought would be a marketable product.
Despite the frequent claims that the story is ""based on truth"" the fact is that it is LOOSELY related to certain highly subjective reports of ""the truth"" as set out in John Keel's book ""The Mothman Prophecies"".
I mention this because whilst the film uses the idea that the Mothman, or Mothmen, gave detailed warnings - ""99 will die"", ""disaster on the River Ohio"", etc., the message from John Keel is that the prophetic element is IMPLICIT rather than EXPLICIT. That is to say, Keel seems (in the interviews on this disc) to be saying that SIGHTINGS of mothmen imply looming disaster wherever they are seen, but he mentions NO examples of direct communication with human beings, and certainly NO specific prophecies.
As to the film itself, it is unquestionably technically ""clever"", but it is a clever presentation of pretty hackneyed material.
Gere, as bland as ever, is distraught over the death of his wife in a car accident two years earlier (the crash provides the prologue to the main action).
After somehow travelling 400 miles in an hour or so - at the end of which he loses all electrical functions in car and mobile phone (this typical UFO-associated phenomena is never fully explored) - he meets up with Gordon Smallwood (Will Patton), who is apparently being pestered by a Mothman, and Police Officer Connie Mills (Laura Lynney), with whom Gere then proceeds to deliver a ""poor man's"" version of ""The X-Files""'s Mulder and Scully for the rest of the film.
Gere has his own interpretation of the film in general, and his part in particular, which he describes in the interview section of the disc and which certainly helps to explain the way he plays his part.
Unfortunately this interpretation is never allowed full rein, and the film comes down to a fairly straight drive to the final Silver Bridge collapse and consequent loss of life which are depicted the last 10 minutes of the film and which are the only details, as far as I could tell, that were genuinely based on ""true events"".
In the final analysis this is JUST passable as comic book level entertainment - but unless you're the sort of person who thinks that the Bermuda Triangle stories are pure fact, DON'T expect to get anything meaningful out of it. The basic material just doesn't measure up.",1033862400,,3110,4.80410447761194

This change undermined any sense of reality the story might have had.  Not that there was much in the first place.
My subsequent article may be read at this URL: [local website].  There I describe how Gray Barker was responsible for at least one telephone call (and possibly more) to Keel and others in an attempt to generate interest in the Mothman and UFO accounts that were rampant at the time.

Richard Gere plays John Klien, the Washington Post reporter who is blissfully married to Mary, played by Debra Messing.  They are househunting together. After ""checking for adequate closet space"" they decide to take a nice, spacious house.  Everything appears perfect but within an instant this changes.  The movie grips you and never lets go from here.  Mysteriously, John ends up in Point Pleasant, a small, quiet town in West Virginia, where, as Sargeant Connie Mills (Finney) informs him, ""A lot of strange things have been happening lately."" Well, I won't give away anything but must say that strange things continue to happen and get stranger, creepier and scarier!
MOTHMAN PROPHECIES has an terrific cast: especially Gere, Finney, (remember them in Primal Fear? The chemistry is here as well;) Messing, Will Patton as Gordon and my very favorite character, Mr. Leek, marvelously portrayed by Alan Bates.  The editing and transitions are impeccable, the sound effects exquistite which make the most of the the many moods, especially the scary ones! Each scene is well shot/done and the movie is paced so as to build the suspense and keep the viewer watching with non blinking eyes. MOTHMAN PROPHECIES is sure to be a movie you won't forget and that will stimulate your mind and entertain you.
You can find out the answer to the title quote in an engrossing conversation between John Klein and former professor of Physics, Mr. Leer. As well as the answer to John Klein's question to Mr. Leer after he shared his experience with MOTHMAN: ""Didn't you NEED to know?""

It was interesting to see how Gordon, a resident of Point Pleasant who at first holds a shotgun on Klein as he believes him a threatening person who has harrassed him several nights in a row, but who then becomes Klein's ally as Klein searches for the truth and the meaning behind the mothman, introduces Klein to Mr. Cold, who gives Klein another prophecy. But, as Professor Leek, who has had head-on collision experiences with the mothman, tells Klein: Often, people misunderstand the prophecies. Will Klein misunderstand? Or will he figure out the truth in time to make a difference? And what, exactly, does the dream that Connie, the local police officer, has, mean?

1687353,5,B0000633LO,"I already knew of the Mothman story before seeing the movie, and it did not disappoint in the least.  You've got to cheer a director who's willing to make a film, where, in the end, nothing is explained.  Because it's not.  You still don't know at the end what the hell was going on or why anything happened the way it did.  And that's fine with me; because it's not the point with this movie.  The point was the thrill ride and creepy, paranoid tone that takes hold once Gere ends up in that West Virginia town.
Like he did in Arlington Road, Pellington knows how to make the most out of menacing little details.  Whether it's strange lights that appear for a split-second in the sky after Gere's car breaks down, or the blink-and-you'll miss it reflection in a mirror on a door that Gere slams, there's plenty of subliminal stuff here to add to the doom and gloom feel that gets increasingly intense.
If you need your thrillers to go from A to B to C, you may not like the unresolved conclusion, but if you want some real chills--even more chilling because almost all of this stuff really happened--you can't do better than this.
The best scene in the movie involves Gere's character on the phone talking to somebody who may or may not exist, who creepily begins to tell him things about him that nobody could possibly know, and then it accelerates from there.  But I won't spoil it for ya!  Best scary movie I've seen in years.  Read up on the real events if you want to get even more creeped out.",1030320000,,1500,4.386281588447654
1687354,3,B0000633LO,"I enjoyed MP.  Richard Gere usually picks interesting films.  This one is very enjoyable while you're watching it.  After the film, it's one where you start asking questions.  Why was there a moth in the new house that Gere and Debra Messing bought?  Was that the mothman?  Was their house haunted?  If they hadn't bought that house, would they not have been affected?  Was Mary's (Messing) tumor caused by mothman?  If mothman comes to predict major dissasters, why'd he bother with this one woman?  And that's the first ten minutes.  So the plot itself creates some major questions.  Will Patton who I've enjoyed on the tv series ""The Agency"" does a nice job as the half-crazy Gordon who's being haunted by the Mothman.  His wife played by Lucinda Jenney also has a nice supporting role filled with emotion.  Laura Linney who previously starred in ""Primal Fear"" with Gere, does a superb job of adding a bit of sanity and humanity to the role of small town cop.  Alan Bates is convincing as the paranormal author Alexander Leek.  However, when we get to the climax of the bridge collapse, the film unfolds almost as a series of tableaux still shots rather than an unfolding of action.  This tends to place the viewer outside the event rather than becoming involved in it.  While the film's pacing is not the best, I found it engaging as a mysterious paranormal thriller.

The catalyst of the story is the frequent appearance of a moth-like creature, who appears to individuals with prophetic declarations of doom.  Though we never really see the ""creature"" per se, the effects of his prophecies drive the plot of the story.  Richard Gere underplays well in the lead role, and gets fine support from the always excellent Laura Linney(and thanks to the filmmakers for not following the cliched route and putting these two characters together romantically), Will Patton, and Alan Bates.

1687356,4,B0000633LO,"I came to The Mothman Prophesies with a clean slate.  I had never heard of what happened in Point Pleasant and so was not expecting a true to life account.  Because of that, I was able to enjoy the movie quite a lot.  It was creepy and exciting, with a tone of lurking menace.  The filming is excellent.  A light hand was taken with the special effects and some psychedelic colorings add interest.  Many of the events in the movie are on the light-fright side, so lovers of serious horror will be disappointed.
The basic premise is that John Keel, Washington Post reporter, loses his wife to a brain tumor that is discovered after a car accident.  The car accident is caused when his wife, who was driving, sees the mothman.  Two years later, John takes a 1 1/2 drive, going six hundred miles in the wrong direction to end up in Point Pleasant.  There he begins to have strange experiences and hears rumors of others having similiar experiences.  This puts him hot on the tail, good little investigative reporter that he is, of the mothman - and perhaps his dead wife. I won't tell you more, except that it is worth watching.
I love that while the various things happen, nothing is flatly explained.  We don't precisely what the mothman is, what it's motivations are, or even if it is a creature of good or evil.  The uncertainty is lovely!
I detracted one star from the DVD (not the movie itself) because I was sorely disappointed to see that there were none of the juicy extras that I love so much with a DVD.

Many people encountered a very strange being in Point Pleasant and thereabouts, and some extremely strange happenings took place, culminating in the unexplainable collapse of the Ohio River Bridge, but this entire aspect is not dealt with at all in Pellington's account.
Of course, there IS no accounting for what happened in consensus reality terms and, to Pellington's credit, he at least has grasped
that essential fact. But why not at least try and deal in the film with what the townsfolk actually went through? The central fact is that people saw a large being with legs, arms (in some instances, at least), and glowing red eyes... it followed cars at high speeds, with large wings that didn't seem to flap at all!  It's clear we'll never know what these events are all about, and Pellington grasps that... so why avoid the central figure of this fringeworld mystery, the Mothman, whatever the Mothman was or represented?
The film stands up fairly well on its own. It's just that the film doesn't exist in a vacuum.  In my opinion, it doesn't deserve the right to associate itself by name (and even proclaim ""Based on True Events!"") and then fail to deal with said True Events.

I am, admittedly, a person that is VERY difficult to please in the whole ""horror"" experience. That said, I REALLY enjoyed this movie. A lot. Perhaps the fact I wasn't expecting much helped me enjoy it more, but I honestly feel the film's merits had more to do with that than any state of mind I may have been in. This is the first movie in quite some time that has genuinely creeped me out to the point where I actually turned the lights OFF so that I could revel in that all-too-seldom experience. I did not find it slow, or overly-long, or boring in any respect. And I'm not even claiming ownership of a wider than average attention span. My honest opinion as to why so many people seem to have been turned off by this movie is the fact that at some undiscernible point in the movie, it stops being a horror movie and starts becoming something else. A bold move, in my opinion, which unfortunately seems to have alienated the movie-going throngs hungry for your typical violent, bloody, lame climax. ""The Mothman Prophecies"" is a movie that should satisfy anyone with an imagination who longs for the days when scary movies were actually scary, and should rightfully displease those whose idea of a good scare is only equivalent to the splatter-content therein.

1687361,4,B0000633LO,"Certainly ""The Mothman Prophecies"" reminds me more of ""The Blair Witch Project"" than any other film I have seen.  Both films become almost oppressive in their use of cinematic cues that something is about to happen (a feeling propelled mainly by the ominipresent eerie music in ""Mothman"") and you are not quite sure what the hell happens in either movie.  Director Mark Pellington definitely does a nice job of putting the audience into the perspective of the protagonist, John Klein (Richard Gere) as he tries to unravel this mystery.
The hook for this film is a car accident in which a sudden mothlike image startles Klein's wife, Mary (Debra Messing).  The resulting accident is not fatal, but leads to the discovery of a brain tumor that proves to be.  Klein is haunted by not only Mary's death, but her dying wish that he be happy and her frantic question, ""Didn't you see it?""  After her death he discovers she has drawn pages of disturbing mothlike images.
We then jump ahead two years to the line.  Klein, a political reporter for the Washington Post (and therefore a cynical skeptic by occupation if not temperment) leaves at 1 a.m. for Richmond.  But at 2:30 he finds his car breaking down near a house in Point Pleasant, West Virginia--400 miles away--with no memory of how he got there.  Curiouser and curiouser, when he knock on the door of Gordon Smallwood (Will Patton), he is threatened with a shotgun and told this is the third night in a row he has come knocking on the door.
The sinker is Connie Mills (Laura Linney), the local cop who saves Klein from Gordon and who admits that strange things have been happening in this neck of the woods for quite some time, usually having something to do with disturbing mothlike images.  You might think that there is an inevitable romance to be had here between Klein and Connie, but whatever attraction exists between the two is nothing in the face of the growing mystery.
One of the reasons ""The Mothman Prophecies"" creates such a sense of disquiet in the audience is that we are not sure exactly how to read the film.  Should we be thinking straightforward gothic horror or something more along the lines of science fiction?  Eventually I came to the conclusion that part of the dynamic of this film was that we were not supposed to figure it out; indeed, you cannot.  I watched the film a second time specifically to try and make pieces fit (no, did not read the book, but am interested in doing so given the comments of other reviewers), and I could not do it.  Nor could I really lay out the powers of the Mothman in a way that would be particularly helpful.  Indeed, I became so wary in this film that I was unwilling to believe phone calls were from the characters we heard unless we actually saw the person talking to Klein on the other end of the connection.
Gere's character is trying to proceed in good old journalistic fashion, but is constantly left befuddled by the people he talks to and the events he witnesses.  Linney provides the stability in the film, not just to Gere's character but to the entire situation.  The emotional heart of the film is Patton, as the local guy caught up in events beyond his wildest imagaintion, although Lucinda Jenney, playing his wife Denise, provides wonderful support (her scene in the hall of the hospital where she offers her husband total support is the small acting gem in the film).
""The Mothman Prophecies"" is not a conventional horror film, and I suspect that those who have the most trouble with it will be those least satisfied by unconventional films.  Ultimately, this is a film (and a story) where the questions are more important that the answers.  The fact that those answers are virtually nonexistent only underscores the point that we are not supposed to know what is going on.  Actually, there is something to be said for a film that reduces both its main characters and audience alike to asking themselves ""What just happened?"" and ""What does it mean?""",1027382400,66,3982,4.662857142857143

Gere is somewhat leaden and is looking as if he's had his face tightened with the attendant expressionlessness that accompanies plastic surgery. Or else he just didn't feel it. Some good scenes keep the movie going, along with nice, tight editing. It's entertaining but fairly forgettable; certainly not the worst film I've ever seen.

I finished the movie very dissapointed.  Most of the plot questions had been answered but I felt as though there were too many instances where scenes and characters where added to the story for the sake of confusion or misdirection. I think the director tried too hard to show the terror of the experience.
For an event based on real events, it deserved more directorial focus. The acting was superb as expected, but the actors where not given a script in which they could truly shine.

1687373,4,B0000633LO,"If you enjoy suspense centered around the paranormal, this film is likely one you'll enjoy. First, three ideas helpful for considering this film's premise:

1. Joseph Campbell (Power of Myth, vol 6) speaks of forces ""too powerful for the forms of time and space"" that therefore ""come through as monsters"". Campbell remarks elsewhere - quoting Buddhist scripture - that, ""When the Angel of Death approaches you it is terror; when it reaches you - it is bliss"".

2. Jung speaks of a ""collective unconscious"" connecting we all share, contribute to, and paticipate in on some primal level, and how ""repressed"" contents of the psyche may come to be perceived externally and ""demonically"" when they inevitably ""spill out"".

3. Electricity, electromagnetism - call it what you will - is a ""force"" physicists understand to have a certain ""infinity"" about it: electromagnetic waves ""go on forever"".

The film is scintillating, tightly edited, well scripted, well acted, enjoyable, and filled with aesthetically subtle and unique visual effects. First, the visuals, then the story (no plot spoiler), then a brief assessment.

1. THE VISUALS
The film is heavily visual, opening surreally with what appear to be foreshortened - therefore ""V-shaped"" - hall lights folding back upon themselves, juxtaposed with an aerial view (the first of many) of the city where Gere works, followed by a view of a commercial Christmas angel in a department store. As the story progresses, we suddenly are introduced to a chilling image of a V-shaped ""moth"" clearly resonant of the images just mentioned. From here on the film starts pouring it on, continuously expanding the range of emotional valences associated with this ubiquitous V shape until almost everything you see in this film starts looking like a moth. This relentless technique of imposing a strongly centered but outbranching nonverbal imagery - the wings of a moth - upon the verbal action of the film, coupled with camera angles that crop up and creep in from all sides, causes the film to take on a ""decentered three dimensionality"". A similar technique is employed with sounds - particularly creakings and respiration. Not quite ""imagery"" in the standard sense, what you start to experience is a psychological assault from all sides as the cascading ""unfoldings"" of the V shape become connected with other shapes such as arches and circles and spheres. By the film's climax - again - just about every shape or sound has become immediately evocative of the seemingly ubiquitous and eldritch Mothman.

2. THE STORY
A distinct advantage of a contemporary setting is a sense of immediacy vital to ""pull you in"". Were it otherwise, the film would have a dud-docudrama feeling about it. Here, however, everything feels familiar. Another strength of the film lies in its refusal to draw conclusions for the viewer about what is happening. No one in the story knows; neither do you. The film *suggests*. It is a specious critique that the film leaves unanswered questions because much fiction does: Shakespeare's plays - the tragedies, particularly - being a prime example. The story suggests the Mothman phenomenon might be a manifestation of the unconscious - the ""Deep Deep Unconscious"" - as it appears in several different persona (and purportedly throughout the world). Events begin taking on a surreal character as even time and space are warped about the happenings of Pleasant Point.

As the moth-like figure appeared to Gere's wife far away from Pleasant Point, this argues circumstantially against the ET hypothesis. But is the Mothman - whatever it is - benign? She saw the figure before her death, but did it *cause* her death? Apparently not, we are reassured by the neuropathologist because her MRI scan revealed a rare glioblastoma clearly [?] predating the traumatic epiphany of Mothman. Perhaps the Mothman suggests nothing so much as an Angel of Death, which figure also is ubiquitous throughout world literature and culture? The parapsychologist Dr Leek remarks that the Mothman appears differently to different people, but invariably foreshadowing catastrophe. It is suggestive, then, is it not, that to the man who had lost everything, Gordon, the Mothman was perceived as human and benign, but to Gere's wife - who had everything to live for - the Mothman appeared horrific, much as death would appear to us all under similar circumstances?

However, the burns and bleeding several people suffered, the telephonic recording of the entity's inhumanly high-frequency voice, the light and pyrotechnics associated with its appearance - these suggest an affinity of the creature with electricity. (There are frequent intentional camera effects which regenerate the V imagery around electrical lights and fixtures.) Lastly, the entity's self-professed name (""kINDRED oLD"") reinforces Dr Leek's notion of such beings having always existed here on Earth. Is the Mothman our ""oppressed"" psyche, or ""oLD"" creatures ""oppressed"" by our mere presence and inevitable sufferings, or are we merely ""oppressed"" by them?

3. PARTING THOUGHT
A great deal of salutary aesthetic discipline was exercised by director Mark Pellington in not allowing this film to descend to the level of ""shlock shock"". This is not an ideal film, however, for watching with an impressionable child. If your child is going to see this film eventually, first watch it together with long, frequent breaks. Overall, this movie requires no blinking and sufficient time to watch before the sun goes down. It's mildly electrifying - even haunting, and stays with you. (Oddly enough, my stereo receiver started acting up as soon as the videotape ended.)",1025827200,11,5660,5.210989010989011
1687374,3,B0000633LO,"Richard Gere stars in this psychological thriller based on the editorial novel by John Keel depicting the bizarre and uncanny events in the small town of Point Pleasant West Virginia.  Klein (Gere) is the star reporter for the Washington Post, he has a new wife, is about to buy a new home, and life is looking good, or so he thinks.  On the way back from purchesing their new home, a freak image appears out of nowhere sending the couple crashing into the snowy embankment.  Klein can't understand what happened, as a few weeks later his wife suddenly and mysteriously dies of a rare brain tumor.  Later he finds himself on a new assignment on the way to Pennsylvania to interview a political candidate when oddly enough, he arrives in Point Pleasant.  The film does offer sometimes very frightening and disturbing images of the ""mothman"" as it is called by its viewees, but altogether it seems to be lacking a fundamental element that makes a good story-a point.  Just like the novel its based on, The Mothman Prophecies is simply a loose collection of harrowing events that take the viewer on a wild (and weird) ride through Point Pleasant- and thats it.  The weird happenings don't add up in the end, and the film doesn't even attempt to give any form of explanation- it simply leaves you hanging.  Some people would argue that the whole point of the film is simply because it does not have one, but I argue- you need a basic solution to any film. One that lacks a solution does not make for a very interesting story. That is because whatever it is you have to say through your film is not confirmed, it is simply lost.  The ending is a pretentious letdown, boring, under developed, and seems like the writers were just too lazy to come up with anything interesting that might have served as a viable explination to the film's intriguing beginning mysteries.",1025395200,3,1862,4.635258358662614

The presentation by director Mark Pellington is nothing short of superb.  From a visual standpoint, Pellington heightens both the suspense and paranormal feel with some of the best camerawork I have seen in some time.  Each shot is meticulously planned for maximum effect and the editing is phenomenal.  He mixes tight shots with odd perspective shots, extreme close-ups and vistas, zooming in, zooming out, and giving the viewer a visual workout that never lets up.
This is a story that teeters on the line between believable and incredible as an entire town seems to be receiving supernatural warnings of an impending disaster.  Not only is it well told, but well acted.
Richard Gere seems determined to break his own mold as an actor, taking chances that keep paying off.  Long considered a lightweight pretty-boy with limited breadth, Gere continues to surprise me with his growth as an actor.  I was impressed by the mature performance he gave in ""Autumn in New York"", shedding his impassive macho image for a more vulnerable character.  This role is an even bigger departure from his standard fare and a better performance.  He gives us a strong and believable performance of a man totally obsessed with understanding the strange events in Point Pleasant and how they might relate to the death of his wife.  If he keeps this up, he is going to start appearing on awards lists.
Will Patton also presents us with a phenomenal supporting performance as Gordon, the man fixated on the mothman.  Patton is a fine actor who often plays villainous or offbeat characters.  Here he renders a character that is paranoid to the point of distraction as he is slowly driven insane by the voices he hears.
Laura Linney is a throw-in playing a minor role, but she has a couple of compelling scenes with Gere that continue to show her talent.
This is a world apart from your standard hack and slash horror flick.  It is intelligently presented and well performed.  I rated it a 9/10.  It makes you wonder, what really happened in Point Pleasant, West Virginia in 1967?",1025222400,6,2184,4.846361185983827

1687377,4,B0000633LO,"If you read The Mothman Prophecies you may be disappointed in this movie. While it has some elements of John Keel's story, it is a total departure from what supposedly really happened.
I first heard about the Mothman in some obscure UFO rag in the 1970s. It is an interesting story of a town visited by a giant flying creature, the real Men-in-Black, and an alien (Indrid Cold) over a period of time. All this strangness culminates in a bridge collapse that killed a number of people. Afterward, life returned to normal for this small town in West Virginia.
John Keel heard of the sightings at the time they were occurring and visited the town and befriended a number of people who witnessed the various phenomena. There were many strange things going on indeed, phones ringing with mechanical voices on the other end, UFOs being seen, cars being chased at 100 MPH by a huge winged creature and strange looking men in black suits asking people weird questions. Keel himself experienced some of the weirdness when a phone started ringing that was not plugged in. He also on numerous occasions heard someone banging on the wall, even though there was no one there.
The movie, with a present day timeline (VS the 1960s) casts Richard Gere as Keel's character. So right off from the start the movie strays from the ""real"" story. There are some elements that are supposedly true. The Mothman was seen by numerous people on roofs and in yards like in the movie. Gere sees a strange light in the sky and has ""missing"" time. There were strange lights seen in the sky during the Mothman time period. Indrid Cold, an ""alien"" appeared to at least one individual in the real story. In the movie he is calling Keel and almost is used like a fusion of the real story of Indrid Cold and the MIB seen all over town.
The movie has good acting and you do get this feeling of something weird is going on. It definately has a creepy atmosphere, probably due to most scenes being shoot in winter with overcast skies or at night. I have to say that without a doubt this DVD has one of the best Dolby Digital 5.1 sound tracks of any DVD I have seen (including the Matix, ID4 and Armageddon). I had seen this at the movies and when I got the DVD I watched it in broad daylight, with the volume turned up a notch, and the first scene with the Mothman/car crash still made me jump out of my seat.

It is a little bit of everything, and does all of it superbly.  It's a very sad love story, an intense thriller, a paranoid psychodrama, and, if reports are to be believed, a compelling true story.
All characters are drawn very well by the great cast, including Richard Gere, Laura Linney, and especially Will Patton in his turn as Gordon Smallwood.  There's a quiet desperation throughout that, while it isn't necessarily pretty or fun to watch, is very real and personal, and easy to identify with.

The first thing that I find bad about this film is its lack of a convincing story. The fact that the box says Based On True Events really means nothing. The film ""Titanic"" was based on true events as well. They base a fictitious plot around a true event. ""Based"" is your key word. I believe that's what they did here. The Mothman accounts in West Virginia were real, but the story happening around that event was put in. I could be wrong, but it seems to me that the film relied on those four words to push its story. That was the major problem I found in the film. Another problem I found was there really wasn't enough Mothman in the film. All the Mothman was was an electronic voice on a phone which got really repetitive after the fifth time he called. They should've focused more on encounters with the Mothman. In the last twenty minutes of the film I nearly forgot that there was a Mothman involved. Other than that, there were some good parts to the film, mainly dealing with the predictions of the Mothman coming true.

1687383,3,B0000633LO,"THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES

(USA - 2001)

Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Super 35)
Theatrical soundtracks: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDS

Following the loss of his wife in a fatal traffic accident, a successful journalist (Richard Gere) is strangely drawn to the small town of Point Pleasant in West Virginia where sightings of a weird moth-like creature appear to foretell a devastating tragedy...

Mark Pellington's portentous drama claims to be based on actual events surrounding a disaster on the Ohio River in 1967. Stylish to a fault, the film develops a keen sense of foreboding as Gere's world is transformed by his wife's mysterious death, leading to a series of genuinely creepy episodes as soon as he arrives in Point Pleasant (eg. Gere's 'first' encounter with Will Patton, his 'telephone conversation' with the Mothman, etc.). Apparently, neither Gere nor director Pellington were interested in making a conventional 'monster movie', opting instead for a series of bizarre plot twists and sudden shocks, linked to various glimpses of the title creature in a number of clever disguises.

Scripted by Richard Hatem (UNDER SIEGE 2) and based on John A. Keel's non-fiction book (an overview of the entire Mothman phenomenon), the film exhausts its sleight-of-hand trickery around the halfway mark and subsequently loses some of its forward momentum, despite a welcome cameo appearance by acting heavyweight Alan Bates as a grizzled professor whose personal encounters with the eponymous Mothman have reduced him to a shadow of his former self. Elsewhere, the movie is lifted by an explosive climax, but this remarkable sequence seems a little hollow and inconclusive, despite the elaborate pyrotechnics, perhaps because the characters have been kept at arms-length throughout the narrative, playing second fiddle to the unfolding mystery.

For all its drawbacks, however, THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES - clearly inspired by the recent popular success of like-minded chillers THE BALIR WITCH PROJECT (1999) and THE SIXTH SENSE (1999) - is mature, intelligent, and often deeply unsettling, and both Laura Linney (TALES OF THE CITY) and Debra Messing (""Will & Grace"") are excellent in crucial supporting roles. Good title, too.",1024012800,14,2210,5.372832369942197
1687384,3,B0000633LO,I was really looking forward to this movie for awhile and as always I expect too much from a movie like this. My first complaint was that the being was never really seen. There was always some type of blur too quick to get an idea of what that thing looked like. Other than that the story keeps you on the edge of your seat. The movie seems too outrageous to be based on true events but it is good enough to buy. My advice is to rent it first then go from there.,1024012800,,462,3.925531914893617
1687385,5,B0000633LO,"I really enjoyed this movie, and to me it was much more intriguing than the book.  I read John Keel's book after seing the trailer for the movie and doing some research on the Internet; I found it extremely unbelievable and not very well-written.  Keel gives his theories and tries to explain how and why everything happened to the reader, which is opposite of what the movie did--the film leaves you with many unanswered questions, which is fine with me because I like unsolved mysteries that no one can explain.  What really happened in Point Pleasant, West Virginia?  Nobody really can answer that question with certainty.
On to the movie, the film starts with John Klein(Richard Gere) and his wife, Mary(Debra Messing), looking at a house they're interested in buying.  The two of them seem to be newly married and very happily in love.  On the way home from the house, Mary sees something.  She looks closer, not sure what it is--and then whatever it is hits the car, which sends it spinning out of control, and Mary ends up being badly injured.  While in the hospital, Mary starts drawing pictures of a winged creature with two blazing red eyes--the Mothman.  She asks her husband: ""You didn't see it, did you?"".  I won't go into anymore details about what happens after, because it will reveal too much.  What I can tell you is that strange things start to happen to John Klein, and they all seemed to be related to this winged creature and a place called Point Pleasant.  The more he learns about what's happening there, the more he is drawn into the mystery.
Mothman Prophecies has a very eerie feel to it.  There are not many scenes that will have you jumping from your seat--it's more a creepy feeling of dread which heightens the tension with each passing moment.  There are some great performances by Laura Linney, Will Patton and Debra Messing, but Richard Gere really steals the show.  He gives a terrific performance as John Klein, a man that is close to losing his mind trying to solve the mystery of Point Pleasant.  I really related to what his character was going through.  Great job of directing by Mark Pellington--he keeps the pace moving just fast enough to keep it interesting.

1687387,3,B0000633LO,"""The Mothman Prophecies"" has a spooky atmosphere, several creepy moments, and some good acting, but, overall, this horror thriller is less than satisfactory. Though set in the present, it is loosely based on events alleged to have occurred in a small West Virginia town in the 1960s.
John and Mary [Richard Gere and Debra Messing] are a happily married couple living in Washington DC. One night they are in an auto accident, and Mary is badly injured. She asks John if he saw `it' before the wreck. He doesn't know what she is talking about. She begins to draw pictures of a moth-like creature, but before he can figure anything out, she dies. A few months later, John has to drive down to Richmond, VA. Somehow he winds up hundreds of miles off course in West Virginia. He has no way of accounting for this. Soon he is running into people who have seen the same creature his wife saw. John decides to investigate and is assisted by the local sheriff [Laura Linney]. As he searches for the mothman, he increasingly gets the feeling that something disastrous is about to happen.
Photographically, the movie is excellent. The actors give their best shots to their rather limited characters. The problems are in the screenplay. The creature is never clearly seen, and its purpose is only vaguely defined. The story tries to get around these weaknesses by switching directions at the end. I won't say how because it would spoil the plot. While the ending is spectacular and exciting, it's almost as if it belongs in a different movie. A happy ending seems tacked on, and the audience is still left wondering where the creature came from and what it wanted.",1023494400,2,1652,4.719723183391004

1687389,2,B0000633LO,"The Mothman Prophecies was a major disappointment.  With a good concept, terrific actors, and a proven director, you would think this would be a terrifying film.  It was not terrifying.  Actually, at times it was laughable.
Even the claim that it is based on ""true events"" doesn't make me the least bit scared.  Anytime a movie is based on a true story, you know that things have been fudged to make the movie more interesting.  And sometimes, like in this case, I don't know how they can even consider it to be based on anything, besides an idea.
Richard Gere put out a decent performance.  I've definitely seen better by him, and I've seen worse.  Laura Linney was good as the town cop.  And Debra Messing had a small role.  I feel that if her role was more developed and expanded on, the movie would have benefited.
Mark Pellington did a terrible job directing it.  It was way over done.  There were too many out-focus-shots.  There were scenes in which needed to be cut out of the movie because they had absolutely nothing to do with it.  They could have chopped off about 10-15 minutes.  I don't understand how he could go from a terrific movie like Arlington Road to this train wreck.
The one plus about The Mothman Prophecies is the music.  It's the only thing that kept me interested at all.
The Mothman Prophecies will not scare you or intrigue you.  It will only make you wonder why such a good idea was turned into such rubbish.  2 Stars",1023494400,4,1448,4.486590038314176

While Mary is driving, she hits the mysterious, urban-like legend ""Mothman."" In the hospital, when she asks her husband, ""You didn't see it, did you?"" John replies, ""See what?""
A cat-scan reveals Mary has a fatal brain tumor that ""has been there awhile."" Her journals later reveal drawings of this moth-like being. ""She knew.""
John goes to the site of Pleasant Point, West Virginia where Mothman terrorizes locals. Mothman leaves mysterious messages and clues that Klein and a local police officer, Connie (played by Laura Linney) try to unravel.
Mothman is an enigma throughout, not very visible but his presence is haunting and predictions of doom abound.
The Mothman Prophecies will get your attention from the start and keep you enthralled for two hours with suspense and intrigue. The only disappointment is having a star like Debra Messing and using her talent for a small portion of the movie. Her role could have been developed much more. Regardless, I purchased the DVD on her star power - worth every penny!

When a friend of mine mentioned that the film's director (Mark Pellington) was also the director of Pearl Jam's ""Jeremy"" videoclip, my curiosity got even bigger.
I was not disappointed.
The film gets most of the pieces of the puzzle right.
The screenplay, which is loosely based on real events, has all the right twists and achieves in keeping the viewer restless on his/her seat. Ok, at some points it gets pretty predictable, but the ending's climax is without any doubt satisfying.
The music really helps in enhancing the movie's atmosphere, giving us a few good scares, too.
As for the direction, Pellington borrows some videoclip tricks (grainy images, perspective shots, strange angles) but uses them masterfully, keeping the tension high to the last scene.
I intentionally left the acting last. Many people may have objections over the use of Richard Gere for the leading part. I found him more than adequate. As for the supporting cast, I liked Alan Bates, who plays a former professor having some valuable information to share. Will Patton is also solid in portraying a man being haunted by the Mothman.

There he finds the town in an uproar over bizarre sitings, the suggestion being that they are encounters with an entity not unlike what led to his wife's death. There he meets a small-town cop, played by Laura Linney. Their interaction is at first quite hokey. She's utterly paranoid that he will stereotype her as a country bumpkin, deeply resenting what she suspects. In so being and doing, she stereotypes him at least every bit as much as she's suspecting him of stereotyping her.

 For all you thriller-type people, I highly recommend this movie for the suspense.  For all you regular moviegoers, wait until this movie comes out on video or DVD.
 When his dieing wife leaves behind mysterious drawings of a winged-man, Washington Post journalist John Klein (Richard Gere) must solve the mystery of the Mothman Prophencies in order to find love again.
 Richard Gere plays the spotlight role as John Klein.  Richard Gere is very passionate in the love scenes, but does not create the feelings of the horror scenes.  He is able to create suspense, but not to fulfill the scare of the Mothman.  However, in the end of the story, he does develop as a character and finds a new love relationship.
 This movie is very suspenseful and keeps you on the edge of your seat, waiting to see what happens next.  Throughout the movie, the picture of the Mothman and sightings of him turn up creating this figure but not knowing what he looks like.  The movie creates suspense of who is going to be the next victim, but not it does revealing whom it is until all the clues are revealed.  There are no blood and guts scenes, so this is nice on the stomach for all you girly girls.
 The best part of the story is the development of the plot.  After an unexplained accident, John finds that his wife Mary (Debra Messing) has a fatal tumor.  She dies a few days later, but she leaves behind a notebook of mysterious pictures that have a black figure with wings and a glowing red light behind him.  This is where the plot of the story begins and the prophecies start.  After his wife's death, John examines the front of the vehicle they were driving the night of the accident to discover the imprint of a figure.  Next, we find him mysteriously in Point Pleasant, West Virginia in the middle of the night, and the story goes from there.  All and all, there is no strict plot, and the story can be confusing at times, but this how the Mothman Prophencies were in real life.",1017187200,,2039,4.494565217391305

This movie is one of my top ten thrillers of the century, totally blowing away Don't Say a Word (Michael Douglass), Unbreakable (Bruce Willis), and I am convinced that it has way more replay value than The Sixth Sense (Bruce Willis). Don't get me wrong I loved these three flicks the first time around, especially in the dark huge theater, but the second times for these three made me snooooooooooooozzzzzzzzzzzz. The second time watching Mothman still intrigued me and I saw things I never saw before, it was a whole new experience the second time around.
The basic plot is: a series of events refuse to let a Newspaper Writer (Richard Gere) leave a small town where a lot of wierd things are going down. I can't say ANYTHING about this film that wouldn't ruin it, especially if you do not know anything about the Mothman, except that IT ROCKS, it is a definite heartstopper with plenty of shock value and it raises some very interesting questions.

1687405,2,B0000633LO,"The producers might have got away with this picture if it had been only 90 minutes long and lacking the most disastrous direction in living memory. It had mostly terrible reviews. So why did I go and see it? Not for Gere, that's for sure. Remember when they used to make films like 'Gone With The Wind', 'The Great Escape' and 'The Big Country'? Nowadays, you get two hours of Richard Gere blinking. No wonder he missed the Mothman. At one point he starts to blink very slowly as if disbelieving the script which, although allegedly possessing a far greater intelligence than the average moth, he mysteriously signed up to. We also get to see the full range of Gere mannerisms. The puckering of the lips. The breathing in and the flicking back of the head. Then the blinks. No, Gere isn't the reason and I have no love for Moths, either. I went to the wardrobe recently and found all my jumpers full of holes. So why pay money to see more of the little bastards? Well, I'm not a bitter man. No, really, I'M-NOT-A-BITTER-MAN! The motive was not revenge as you never get to see the vindictive, cowardly runts anyway. I admit the real reason is pettiness and gross moral turpitude. I wanted to see someone else suffer the way I have suffered and get their cardigan chomped, preferably an American. They have it too good over there. Well, not so good as it turns out. So I'm sitting there in the cinema waiting for some nice jumpers to show up and sure enough Gere is soon wearing a very fetching blue one. Looks expensive, too. A twisted grin crossed my face. Go on, Mothman, sick him - SICK HIM! But sadly, no. This moth crashes cars, sends cryptic mail and makes crank phone calls but not one jumper is munched. Great, I pay good money to see two hours of Gere blinking and the world's biggest slacker moth. I'm not a bitter man.
Point Pleasant is well named, though. A courting couple in a car get down to some back seat action when suddenly ""something happened that we don't understand."" By those flashing lights, It looks to me like you both experienced an organism. I read about them once in a medical journal. Unfortunately for him, Gere does not experience an organism. He walks around a lot, goes through doors, gets a cup of coffee. Damn fine coffee, but no organism. He also gets some peculiar phone calls from a chap called Indrig Cold that give him the heebie-jeebies and much scratching of the head. To get the message he should have read between the lines of that name. Insufferably Naff Direction Rambling Incoherent Gere Can Only Lead Down. Unless I misheard and his name was Indrid in which case, panic over. Well, not really over because Gere meets an odd man who nearly blows his head off on first acquaintance, but turns out to be really quite sweet in the end. This man is later seen sitting in his car and having similar flashes experienced by that courting couple. Is he having one of those organisms too? Or several, by the look of it? How does he manage it with both hands on the steering wheel? Dodgy suspension, perhaps? It's another deep mystery that Gere must uncover about the small town he accidently finds himself stranded in. So he consults a parapsychologist called Leek. After nearly two hours of plodding, wobbly movie I felt the need for one myself.
The town cop is gorgeous, though. Do she and Gere get it together for a few more flashing organisms or will she reject him in favour of a bit of moth diving? Either way, I'm definately going to get a speeding ticket driving through Point Pleasant just to meet her and I know for a fact that I will. Just after I found my eaten jumpers, the phone went and someone asked for me by name. I was immediately suspicious as it's usually a wrong number asking for a massage parlour. It's the mothman, I tell you, and he wants me to go to Point Pleasant, although sadly without a nice warm wooly jumper. But I'm not a bitter man. I also prophesise that all you groovy moths out there will love the end title music of this film. I like it so much I'm generously giving 'The Mothman Prophecies' a star.

I will probably scandalize many a ""People's Sexiest Man Alive"" fans by saying that Gere was too old for the part of Washington Post reporter John Kline, which practically screamed for a younger, hipper actor. Think wide-eyed first season Fox Mulder, who Gere is obviously failing to immitate (he looks confused rather than frightened). And through a serious lack of editing even the most climactic sceenes in this film were not suspenseful, but tedious. The television comercial was scarier, the one with the creepy voice saying ""Ch-ch-chapstick!!"" I had to bite my coatsleeve so as not to yell at the bridge to hurry up and collapse...

The plot is jumbled at times, the true to life story certainly sensationalized, but never the less the very threat that such a story could be true gives the movie its punch. Without giving away too much, I did find the concept of paranormality and precognition to be believable, and the tension in the flick to be real. Still, I think the movie would have been best served if it did not feature Richard Gere and several other note-worthies.

They've done a superb job with all of the elements we've come to expect from a big budget picture, and yet managed to avoid many of the commonplace failings of American cinema.
The casting is very nearly perfect. Richard Gere is a Washington Post reporter who suddenly finds himself thrown into the deep end of the Twilight Zone. He takes the uprooting of his deepest convictions just as you might expect; his anger, fear and obssessive need to make sense out of chaos is entirely believable . . . which is a good thing, since the entire story hinges upon it. This is exactly the sort of role at which Gere excels and he makes the most of it.  Laura Linney is also terrific as a small town cop every bit as intelligent and far better grounded. She's a good match for Gere and more than holds her own.
Make no mistake: this *is* a Hollywood movie. The story plays fast and loose with the facts and legends of the Point Pleasant incident. The film leads you by the nose to that one interpretation the director wants; you're left with no choice but to accept the paranormal ""explanation"" for the Mothman phenomenon.
On the other hand, this is *not* a typical Hollywood horror flick. If you're looking for blood, guts and gore, don't bother with this one.
All in all, I truly enjoyed this movie. Its frightening without being disgusting, sweet without being cloying. Go see it and have fun!",1012521600,10,1501,4.518382352941177

In 1964 a dark phantom appeared and haunted the small and dreary little town of Point Pleasant, West Virginia. The Mothman is a bird-like creature that drives some people nearly insane and others to their death.  The movie starts out well and one is quite hopeful given the interesting plot and the starring actor.  But it never really picks up the pace and the story begins to drag and never fully develops.

1687418,2,B0000633LO,"""What Do You See?""
In ""The Mothman Prophecies,"" one doesn't see much more than a shadowy figure surrounded by brilliant white and red light, an apparition that serves as the basis for the film's story. Operating under the notion that what we don't see can be equally effective as what we do see, director Mark Pellington helms the story with a sincere sense of menace and a sublime display of visual trickery, but the movie makes the mistake of losing focus from the mystery it claims to lay rest to. Furthermore, it doesn't trust its audience to embrace an ending where loose ends remains, and insists upon supplying us with a less-than-thrilling climax that attempts to mask one problem by providing a resolution to another.
It's a classic case of a promising premise that seems to run out of ideas once it comes time for delivery point. Beginning in Washington D.C., we are introduced to the lives of Washington Post reporter John Klein (Richard Gere) and his wife, Mary (Debra Messing), who have just finished buying themselves a new home on Christmas Eve. During the drive home, Mary reacts in shock to something unseen and runs the car off the road; at the hospital, the doctors locate a fatal tumor in her brain, deeming that as the cause of the accident.
But Mary knows otherwise, asking her husband, ""You didn't see it?"" Soon after, she dies, leaving behind a notebook with a collection of drawings of a moth-like creature with red eyes and an expressionless face. The film then skips ahead two years, and we find John sullen and emotionally empty. On his way to Richmond in the early morning hours, he soon finds himself in the small town of Point Pleasant, West Virginia, a mere hour and a half and a whopping four hundred miles after his initial departure from Washington. This, and a bizarre incident involving a local man accusing him of trespassing numerous times, gives him enough initiative to start questioning reality.
Hooking up with local cop Connie Parker (Laura Linney), who speaks of strange occurrences throughout the town, John begins to look for clues as to what his wife saw before the accident, and how he strangely arrived in this town, two things he believes are connected to the events surrounding a mythical creature known to those who see him as ""Mothman."" Soon, he starts getting strange phone calls, reports of his dead wife seen at the police station, and the premonitions of events soon to pass.
And this is where the movie starts to collapse on its own agenda. The phone calls, the re-materialized spouse, foretold disasters, all of which work as diversions from the fact that there is no resolution to the mystery surrounding the Mothman. The movie's unwillingness to emphasize that point, much less trust its audience to accept it, sends the third act into a tailspin of ludicrousness, relying on an unneeded climax in hopes of tying together all its loose ends, when it deserves to end on a note of uncertainty. Even the Mothman himself does little for the movie's plot, remaining little more than a botched juxtaposition of good and evil, an identity crisis the movie never clears up.
Director Pellington does manage to grab our attention with some very effective camera movements, stylistic dabbles in hallucinatory imagery, and an environment where nothing is without a sense of unease. Many of his shots appear to be the Mothman's point-of-view, a tactic Pellington uses throughout much of the movie, along with intense collages of psychedelic colors and bright lighting. His cast is also first-rate, with credible performances from Gere and Linney, who carry much of the story through expressions of fear and paranoia.
But for all of its stylistic approaches and well-meaning performances, ""The Mothman Prophecies"" lacks the courage to tell it like it is. In my research of the events in Point Pleasant prior to the film, I felt a great sense of unease that the movie is curiously lacking in its most essential moments. As a result of the film's need to keep things simple in the end, we learn nothing about the Mothman, nor does the mystery surrounding him ever reach a high note of interest. As a director, Pellington hasn't lost his touch; as a storyteller, he has a lot to learn.",1012348800,22,4230,4.835862068965517
1687419,2,B0000633LO,"Richard Gere, who, last fall told an arena full of New York firefighers and policemen they should ""channel all their horrendous energy into peace and love"" decided to channel HIS energy into ""Mothman Prophecies,"" a film that plays like a medicore episode of ""X-Files"" minus that TV show's hipness and wit.
The screenplay (based on actual events in which a group of citizens of Point Pleasant, West Virignia reported seeing a huge moth like creature who became a harbinger of doom; predicting tragedies yet to come) has Gere as an investigative reporter for the Washington Post (THERE's a novel idea-- casting a movie star as an investigative reporter; maybe the filmmakers got hold of some old episodes of ""Night Stalker), who, following the death of his wife, mysteriously finds himself in Point Pleasant, where the mysteries, such as they are, begin to unfold.
Director Mark Pellington (""Arlington Road"") tries to lift the material with a lot of flashbacks,quick cuts, and dissolves, but none of it quite works...and this film might boast the worst sound editing of all time; one has to strain at times to hear exactly what that muffled voice on the phone is telling out intrepid hero.

The Mothman Prophecies is a metaphysical thriller, a psychological rollercoaster that will keep you on the edge of your seat (and sanity for that matter). The film is done with a lot of grainy footage and very independent-film type styles and dialogue.
Definitely a psychothriller, this film begs many questions about the nature of phenomenon. It also displays the psychological effects of aknowledging evil.
I went and saw this movie with my parents (I am 20 years old) and they both liked it as well.  So I am convinced that both the weekly movie-goer and the picky critic will like this movie equally.

I really liked this movie. It was very unique and very creepy. Espesially because its all based on true events. Though I don't know if thats true or not. I really didn't know much about what this was about with the trailer but it didn't take long to figure out. Its basically about paranormal activity. Its actually very frightening and very unpredictable whcih I think can make or break a movie. I never knew what was going to come next and I really enjoy that kind of movies.

1687425,5,B0000633LO,"Richard Gere plays Washington Post writer John Klein who's wife Mary Klein, played by Debra Messing, suddenly sees a strange creature and gets in a car accident. A few days later she dies of a suposed brain tumbor, which plagues John's mind still two years later. Suddenly John ends up in a small West Virginia town called ""Point Pleasent"", which at the moment is being plagued itself by numerous sightings of a so called ""Moth Man"", a creature that looks to be half man and half moth. Slowly John is drawn into the sightings, trying to figure what is going on, and in the process falls in love with a local police officer, played by Laura Linney.
""THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES"" is based on true events that happened in Point Pleasent, West Virginia in 1966 - 1967, obviously the film is updated to these times to make a bit more modern. The tone of the film stays in the same tone throughout the film, with all the intensity and drama at an always high. All the cast give great performances, especially Debra Messing who has the smallest role in the film. The film has been dubbed a thriller but with all its creepy moments and its terrifying climax, I can assure you the film is nothing but horrifying.

1687426,4,B0000633LO,"The Mothman Prophecies in general was a good movie.  Richard Gere does a wonderful job in the portrail of the main character, though his emotions are somewhat odd occasionally.  The thing which impressed me the most with this movie was the cinematography.  The camera angles and seemingly random use of special effects adds greatly to the overall atmosphere of the film.  The suspenseful moments were accentuated by the eerie camera angles, as well as some unorthodox ""modern art"" shots that bring out the emotion and mood of the scene.  Sound design, as well was wonderfully done, in most cases doing away with the traditional ""Screaming violins"" in suspense situations.  As for genuine fear value, the Mothman Prophecies actually had me frightned for a while, which is extremely rare in moden movies.  The traditional shock scares are present, as with all horror movies, however they were rare and tastefully done.  In one instance, for example, I believe that I was the only person who did not flinch or scream; You could actually feel a rush of air as every individual in the theatre gasped en mass.  --POSSIBLE SPOILER WARNING AHEAD-- The only negative point to this movie was the over-use of foreshadowing.  Very early in the movie, I had determined the nature of the final climax due to an unfortunate shot of the structure in question.  Furthermore, the precognitions having to do with the climax were too well-explained to not reveal the plot to most movie-goers. --END POSSIBLE SPOILER WANRING--.  Overall, The Mothman Prophecies is a very well-done film, reccomended to anyone who does not have a heart condition and enjoys a good dose of ""strange happenings"".",1011916800,2,1671,5.0144927536231885

Much to my surprise, this was not the case at all here. I enjoyed this flick a fair amount, including the few times I nearly jumped out of my skin during surprise scenes! This is generally tends to be a thinking person's thriller/suspense type movie. It has overtones of the 'X-Files' television series everywhere. You are kept thouroughly off kilter by events and unsure of what the threat exactly is much like in Arnold Schwarzenegger's 1987 movie ""Predator"". I'm generally not much of a Richard Gere fan but, he did a great job here along with all the other actors and actresses. The angles used and editing combined with superb suspense building music is masterful. There is no blood and gore, just a lot of mystery and intensity leading up to a decent, but not superb ending. Give it a try whether you are young or older, male or female, scary movie fan or not.

The movie challenged me.  I had no clue what was going to happen.  Richard Gere and Laura Linney (who were so great together in ""Primal Fear""), have great chemistry on screen, and it was a joy to see the two of them together again.  Richard Gere plays a Washington Post journalist who, after getting in an accident with his wife, finds his life turned upside down.  Winding up in Point Pleasant, West Virginia, he encounters a man who claims (well, I don't want to ruin the surprise).  Staying in town to research the strange claims that the locals have made, he finds an ally in  local cop (Linney) who explains that for the past couple of months, ""strange things have been happening"", with even the most upstanding citizen claiming to have seen ""something"".  The film puts you off kilter with its eerie shots, dark nights, and even the ringing of the telephone is enough to put your nerves on edge, because you know something strange is going on, but what is it?  The climax of the film was very intense, and I found myself with my knees drawn up to my chin (thank God for stadium seating).
