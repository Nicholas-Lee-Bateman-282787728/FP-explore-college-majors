6449744,5,B00KVFHBPG,"I was surprised at the quick results of this workout. I've always loved Denise, and she always keeps on top of things in fitness. She gives you the latest trends, and will never hurt you. I happen to enjoy her ""girlfriend"" chatter, but if you don't, you can play the workout with the music only.

Considering how short this workout is, it's time well spent.",1414540800,4,357,4.492307692307692
6449745,2,B00KVFHBPG,"I was so psyched to receive this after the positive reviews,especially since I am close to Denise's age and sometimes want a dvd that isn't super high intensity. That being said,this dvd was way too easy,even for a rest day. The only thing I really liked was the scenery-I felt that she does not do enough reps to feel much of anything. For a true Booty lift,I highly recommend Tonique Mat or Tracy Anderson Metamorphisis-I felt that this dvd would not make it into any of my weekly rotations,due to the fact that I did not feel worked at all. The title is very misleading because it is not a Fat Burning workout,even for a couch potato.",1412380800,5,637,4.452991452991453
6449746,5,B00KVFHBPG,"Very nice new workout from Denise! This is one of her best new routines. It is her alone in a nice living room set with nice music. The moves are a perfect flow of yoga and barre. It is an intermediate level routine as well. Do not expect a tough workout from Denise- this is a toning routine with lower reps and it is not harder or easier than most of her past workouts. If you love Denise and her past workouts- you will love this too! This is really exactly what I was hoping for in her new workout! If you are used to hard or advanced workouts- this is not for you. If you area beginner or intermediate that wants a toning routine, but not an intense workout- this is for you. Denise is nice and mellow in this one and I really liked it.",1411948800,22,741,4.0476190476190474
6449747,5,B00KVFHBPG,"CREATIVE MOVES, GRACEFUL FUSION FLOW OF BARRE & YOGA!
Love it, love it, love it!  Denise's best work in years.  Efficient moves that flow, never feels forced or choppy, always controlled and graceful.  Also loved the arm workout.  No dread -- I can see myself using this one often.  Option for voice instruciton or music only.  Personally I happen to like Denise's voice, to me it's soothing.  This workout was filmed in her own home, nice background.  Music is appropriate and unobtrusive, just adds to the workout.  Highly reocmmend.",1409875200,37,535,4.921348314606742

6449755,5,B00KVFHBPG,"Surprisingly pleased. Denise is calm, low key and relaxed, in her living room. Exercises are yoga inspired as well as some barre style, using an ordinary chair.
The arm toner is a plus. Very nice. Worth the price to own.",1433808000,3,220,4.525
6449756,5,B00KVFHBPG,Love Denise!!!  She always gives all she has for a wonderful work out,1433116800,3,69,4.3076923076923075
6449757,4,B00KVFHBPG,"I do barre workouts regularly. I bought this looking for something to do once in a while to shake it up. I enjoy Denise's relaxed style and how she mixes the barre moves with yoga. This is not super strenuous, but is a nice change from my rigorous routine.",1428796800,7,256,4.244897959183674
6449768,4,B00KVFHBPG,Really like this dvd for the butt,1427760000,,33,3.857142857142857
6449769,5,B00KVFHBPG,This is a great leg and booty workout! I've been doing it for a couple months now and see a lift in my butt. :),1427414400,3,111,3.48
6449770,5,B00KVFHBPG,Love the yoga booty lift and the arm toner bonus. I own many of Denise Austin's videos and again was not disappointed!,1423699200,8,118,4.409090909090909
6449771,5,B00KVFHBPG,This exercise is really a good workout.  Hope to do it several times in the week along with cardio,1422230400,2,98,4.157894736842105
6449772,3,B00KVFHBPG,"My main complaint with this video is that in almost every 5 minute section, Denise goes from floor to standing, then back to floor, turning over onto back, then to front, etc.  it seems she doesn't stay on one exercise long enough which is always part of problem when you try to crunch too many movements into a short amount of time!  I love Denise's videos and have nearly all of them but this one done for the second time today, really bugged me because I was constantly needing to reposition and look at TV.  Is it just me that had this problem?",1421020800,2,548,4.300970873786408
6449773,5,B00KVFHBPG,great workout! Love the setting! VERY happy! Denise great as always. :),1420329600,2,71,5.0
6449774,2,B00KVFHBPG,Not her best dvd. Buy the old exercise tv bootylicious buns instead,1418256000,2,67,4.666666666666667
6449775,5,B00KVFHBPG,Great Video!,1416700800,,12,5.5
6449776,4,B00KVFHBPG,I actually liked this Denise Austin DVD! I like the fusion of different types of exercises and I always do the 10 minute arm section after the barre workout it makes a nice 40 minute workout you work your whole body!  However you do need some cardio though and you can accomplish that by going on a 20 minute fast paced walk all in all it's a nice hour workout,1416096000,9,360,4.142857142857143
6449777,5,B00KVFHBPG,"I LOVE Yoga Booty Lift!!  As w/ all Denise Austin dvd's, you get a great workout and the area's targeted get toned and tight!  I would and have recommended this dvd, as well as all her other ones to friends! :)",1415577600,2,210,4.097560975609756

8661861,5,B00KVFHBPG,"I have worked out with Denise for more than 20 years. I incorporated this DVD into my weekly workout routine to stretch and relax. It's wonderful! I feel great after doing it. I do like to hold the stretches for a bit longer, however, so I sometimes hit the pause or rewind button.",1495843200,,281,4.320754716981132
8661862,5,B00KVFHBPG,"Another great workout from Denise! I love that it's just her in this one. This is really great if your just getting into yoga or need a workout that's easy on your joints ( also great for post baby, like me! ). It doesn't feel like 30 minutes at all and it's awesome that she has the bonus arm workout. I feel rejuvenated after doing this!",1489449600,2,339,4.151515151515151
8661863,4,B00KVFHBPG,"I have this DVD and bought a version for my kindle so I can use it travelling.  I did it daily for 6 months and actually grew .5 inch.  I was very happy.  It is a good video,  but Denise could tone down her comments.  Although they make me laugh because I ignore them, when I did it with my sister she did not like it.  One example is "" make your bottom half your better half,  it is the last part that leaves a room.""",1486598400,2,418,3.7906976744186047

8661867,5,B00KVFHBPG,I absolutely LOVED this DVD!!! It is the perfect blend of yoga and barre!! It's the perfect balance between the two! She even has an extra arm workout which is a great addition to this dvd!! The arm workout incorporates yoga moves with arm weights! It's great for beginners and if you're looking for an effective yet somewhat easy workout! One of Denise Austin's best DVDs!!!,1465084800,,375,4.696969696969697
