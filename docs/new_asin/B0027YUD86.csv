8355262,5,B0027YUD86,"Interesting, I've never seen the particular cover shown in this photo however a few years ago I was fortunate enough to find 5 Sing Mit Heino VHS tapes put out by Pantoffel-Kino in 1987-88. 4 at a German bookstore, they were languishing away in their video rental section and by good fortune they were all in great shape. I also found another volume on ebay. These tapes are old German TV ZDF shows circa 1977 called ""Sing Mit Heino"" and feature this great singer performing his greatest songs in a variety of settings. A definite must have for any Heino fan, if you can find them.",1282003200,,581,4.490566037735849
