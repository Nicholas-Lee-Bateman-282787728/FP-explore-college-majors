8492538,2,B0064EGKVE,"Not one of the best. Buckley and his guests, Eudora Welty and Walker Percy, can't really connect and engage. You can tell this by the fact Buckley continually and abruptly moving from one topic to another in his effort to have the conversation. Also no mention of Flannery O'Connor is a glaring omission in any discussion of Southern literature.",1472774400,,345,4.864406779661017
8492539,3,B0064EGKVE,"Some good points were made, especially by Walker Percy.",1466467200,,55,5.222222222222222
8492540,5,B0064EGKVE,"What a privilege to hear these two extremely talented writers and thinkers be interviewed by such an incisive interlocutor.  The relatively poor technical quality of the video and audio is ironic, as it reveals something about the changes in our society in the years since this was taped in 1972:  our society seems to have moved forward in technology to the same degree that our public discourse has degenerated.",1464998400,,413,4.971014492753623

8492542,2,B0064EGKVE,"The host and guest writers are mumbling which makes me repeat the video to listen again.
If you are used to hear CNN pronunciation, you would feel boring.",1379116800,,154,4.535714285714286
8492543,4,B0064EGKVE,"The time is spent by pursuing what can only be called ""the Southern Imagination"".  The discussion is not so much what is but rather why such a sub-culture is successful and the future or lack of future for this and other similar movements.  It is an interesting study of writers and why they were/are successful.  It briefly touches on southern culture and great writers of the south.",1362355200,2,384,4.701492537313433
8492544,5,B0064EGKVE,"This video is a rare look into the thoughts of Eudora Welty and Walker Percy on topics as varied as the influence of Faulkner, the role of the novelist in the segregated south, and the south's role in America after the Civil War.",1353715200,4,229,4.348837209302325
8492545,5,B0064EGKVE,"Starts a bit slow, but as anyone who has read Percy or Welty knows, it couldn't help but be good.  It is sad that we don't have conservative talk shows like this anymore.  Who would air it on television?  It is wonderful that we can go back and watch these archived episodes at the click of a button.",1333843200,8,300,4.137931034482759
