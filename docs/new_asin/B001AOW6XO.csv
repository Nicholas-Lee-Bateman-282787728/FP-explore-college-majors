8278441,5,B001AOW6XO,"This is actually Mindy Myrlea who leads the workout, though Keli Roberts is in the background. It's quite intense! Yet petite Mindy, a world-class athlete, smiles and jokes all through it; even the exercisers backing her up look challenged at times! That BOSU makes it hard but will really build up your legs...and of course your sense of balance. Another great workout from the Body Bar people, thank you!",1374537600,,406,4.898550724637682
