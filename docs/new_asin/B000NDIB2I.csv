Movie is terrible. The cover is beautiful. But other than that it is terrible.
I swear nobody and I MEAN NOBODY  knows how to say Anastasia.
They all say ANNA-STAAH-SEE-UH like her name is a disease or something.
They copied the Disney movie. They copied it she even had the necklace and the dog.
This one was better than others. As far as historically accurate She had all three sisters and her brother
If you want a good one go watch the Disney movie

~Spoilers~
The ending is terrible by the way.
Yes she understands she doesn't want to be royal anymore.
I get that.
It seemed to me they really just wanted to get this over with.
Yes she made it to the place she wanted to go
But really now? It couldn't have shown her Nikki and Alexander walking into a nice home or something and saying They lived happily ever after or whatever? Really now.",1388707200,,936,4.252808988764045
8177240,5,B000NDIB2I,I have seen a different Anastasia and this one seems less scarier than the other one.  My children enjoyed this one.,1364860800,,116,4.523809523809524

8177243,5,B000NDIB2I,"This is a decent remake of the classic story of Anastasia, the film stared Ingrid Bergman, this is by no means as good, but good for a cartoon.",1348272000,,143,4.142857142857143
