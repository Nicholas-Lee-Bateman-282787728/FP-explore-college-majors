8162034,3,B00008V5TU,"This is a no budget VHS horror flick that's solely for those who are interested in seeing this stuff. It was made with a VHS camera, has a low amount of gore overall, and simply doesn't deliver the goods overall; when I see VHS horror flicks, I at least want them to be really explicit. The story involves a woman who can't leave her house due to a mental disorder, a little alien bug type monster, and a couple of human aliens who are trying to get the thing. In the beginning, there's an off-screen death that's followed by another death where only a slight bit of blood splatter is shown. About the next 20 minutes are boring; you're just waiting around for something to happen while they add some filler. Later, there's a slight bit of topless nudity in a tub, and she gets all this ultra cheap FX slime on her when that thing bites her; it bites you and your veins protrude and slime oozes from you. The movie would've been better if the other deaths had more slime like this scene. There's more boring filler in the midsection of the film; this stuff is unnecessary because most are just buying this for exploitation. Some more deaths follow that are tame with a couple showing a low amount of slime. The locations where they made the movie are at least decent because it takes place in the countryside, but there's no effective atmosphere. Acting is what you would expect from this type of no budget VHS movie, and the directing is below average and made me loose interest during the boring parts. So why 3 stars? Well, it does have a certain no budget, awful type charm to it. Just remember that it's bad and gets boring.

There's a commentary, bloopers, behind the scenes and trailers for extras. The DVD quality just looks like you're watching this on VHS.",1418342400,,1766,4.484472049689441
