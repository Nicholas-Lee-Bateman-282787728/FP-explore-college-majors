8396116,5,B003FSTVEU,"This DVD shows divers off Cocos Island, 300 miles off the coast of South America, with hammerhead sharks, rays, turtles, lobsters and a wide assortment of colorful fish. This film will interest ma and pa, gramma and grampa, kids of all ages, neighbors and  the canines and felines residing in your house. The second half shows filming secrets photographed off the coast off California. The show is well presented with Linda Hunt (not Linda Hall, whoever she might be) doing the narration, If you would like to have a career as  an ocean diver, don't miss this one. Highly recommended.",1383523200,,584,4.83
8396117,5,B003FSTVEU,"I adore this series of videos from Wondrous Secrets of the Ocean Realm. I admit I am kind of a junkie when it comes to nature documentaries and often it feels like I am watching the same thing over and over in different shows. This one though I learned so much from and saw creatures new to me and I am better many other people as well. I am delighted to share these videos with my 4 children and help them explore the natural ocean world that is sadly disappearing thanks to mans mistakes.

 It is written so beautifully and the videos while not wide screen are still wondrous. Worth watching!",1376956800,,594,4.342342342342342

8396120,4,B003FSTVEU,"The Wonderous Secrets are enjoyable to watch, beautiful and fascinating footage with narrative that descibes the creatures and their lives. These episodes were good, but not as good as some of the others I've viewed. The Filming episode was a also not like the others, since it included interviews with the film crew.",1366416000,,317,5.0
