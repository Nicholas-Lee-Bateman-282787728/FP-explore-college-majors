7749190,4,B01F6EHOGM,Color is looking lovely & it's set in Paris with all the recognizable sites. I don't like the fact that the characters are even thinner than Barbie dolls - even the boy hero is skinny & in costume looks like a girl. Voices are American so that could be the reason but would rather see them drawn with a little more weight on them. Not the best image for girls but of course my granddaughter consciously doesn't notice.,1474848000,,418,4.371794871794871
7749191,4,B01F6EHOGM,"I like the show.

I just wanna know, on the dvd I have the image is cut so it only shows about 4/5 of the image and it don't help zooming out.
I 'am I the only one who has this problem?",1474156800,2,185,3.4047619047619047
7749192,5,B01F6EHOGM,"I had this preordered and was not disappointed. In addition to including both the French and English audio we expect with Ladybug, the DVD also included a tiny little comic of Evillustrator, which was not expected.
Overall, Season 1: Volume 2 was just as good as the first volume. Plus, Amazon got my delivery to me on time even though it was a holiday.",1473033600,3,353,4.53125

8760322,5,B01F6EHOGM,"This is an amazing dvd,but it's too bad they didn't just put the entire season in one dvd boxset.
But,like Disney,who puts only a few episodes of each show on dvd like:
Austin and Ally,
 suite life on deck got only one dvd release,etc.
They figure they'll make more money by separating them into three different dvds.
Making us fan's have to search forever for every episode and pay more for it,too.
That's right:  season one of miraculous is three different dvds.
You have to search awhile before finding the green one with both ladybug and cat noir on the cover.
The other one's show up pretty easily.
Anyway,i highly recommend buying all of them,since there's no other way to get each episode.
Plus, once you watch all these,you'll be wanting more.",1500508800,,751,4.681818181818182
