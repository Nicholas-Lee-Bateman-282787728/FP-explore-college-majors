8765084,1,B01HDHA9EO,"Bought this as a Xmas gift. Horrible video quality to the point of being almost unwatchable.  Tried changing deinterlacing, DVD upscaling, nothing works. Avoid buying this set. A shame because the wife loves Paul Naschy and was really excited to see this one movie we don't own of his.",1482624000,2,285,4.816326530612245
8765085,1,B01HDHA9EO,"Got this set the other day and returning it today for a refund. The video quality is really bad, they look like they're from old VHS masters with burnt in subtitles which are hard to read. Even the newest movie from 2005 with Paul Naschy looks bad and it's only 11 years old. Anyway, stay away from this poor release. I added some screen caps so you can see for your self.",1476230400,28,372,4.180555555555555
