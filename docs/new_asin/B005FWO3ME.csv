8470774,4,B005FWO3ME,I'm not sure if this was considered the series finale. But I would say that this series does deserve a reboot. And every war on a TV show also deserves a definite ending; no cliffhangers.,1519516800,,187,4.371428571428571

8470780,5,B005FWO3ME,"This is the icing on the cake, folks! Voltron: The Final Battle DVD is what has made me an Official Voltron fan. This DVD features the collection of episodes ending out Season One in which the Voltron Force faces their biggest challenges yet; from Haggar's evil Omega Comet which threatens to rip Voltron apart, Lotor's fearsome Dark Doom Castle, to King Zarkon mutated into the most powerful Robeast himself! Special Features include: A sneak peek at the highly anticipated new Voltron video game from THQ, A special look at the new Voltron toy line from Mattel,
and a special sizzle reel of the new Voltron Force series(which does the Voltron series justice, let me tell you).

If you want a little taste of just what the Voltron license is, get this DVD collection as well as Voltron: The Legend Begins. I can guarantee that you walk away LOVING this show. I did and I'm picky when it comes to my taste in cartoon shows.",1321315200,9,923,4.628048780487805
