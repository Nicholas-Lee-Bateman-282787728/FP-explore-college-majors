2398877,5,B000AZ0LCM,"Lovely film, sensitively portrayed. I want to buy the DVD if there is the option of having either Spanish or English subtitles. In Spain you can look and see if it is marked SORDOS (for the hard of hearing), and if so, it will have Spanish subtitles as well as English. It is easier to listen to a foreign film if the subtitles are in the same language, rather than trying to concentrate on two languages simultaneously. Please let me know how to get the version with both sets of subtitles.",1140825600,,491,4.406593406593407
2398878,4,B000AZ0LCM,"I liked this movie.  It was a nice way to spend the afternoon.  The dog in the front seat of the Jeep Overland makes a great image.

The story does not seem unrealistic.  It is the story of a 52 year old mechanic who finds himself out of work (much like the US today).  I could have known this guy.

He obtains a champion dog as a reward for helping a woman with her car.  The mecahnic learns the dog breeding trade, while hearing tales of shows in Miami and the US, the promised land of the dog breeders.

Throughout the movie, I kept wondering how does he pay for the gasoline for these long drives?",1326412800,,601,4.120689655172414

2398880,5,B000AZ0LCM,"This is one of those stories about someone ending up with a dog they didn't want, but they end up bonding with the beast anyway. The basic plot outline may be very familiar, but the story is never predictable or sentimental and  it contains other interesting themes about life in Patagonia, social class, etc. that add depth to the story.",1286668800,,338,4.633333333333334
2398881,5,B000AZ0LCM,I stumbled on this movie one day while clicking through chanels with my TV remote. I was captured by the scenery and the interactions of the characters. I was keen to share it with my dog loving friends.,1277337600,2,203,4.368421052631579
2398882,4,B000AZ0LCM,"The simplicity of rural Argentina is reflected with honest endearment in this story.
""Coco"" and ""Bombon"" speak loud with glances, half smiles and heart about the struggles of people that refuse to go down without a fight. Cinema like this, reminds us that the most amazing stories are played out by everyday people. If there was awards for Doggy acting, ""Bombon"" would walk away with all of them, is not what he does but what we see in him that will make you laugh and cry.
You can't miss this chance to be humbled by love, loyalty and a hero called Bombon.",1267401600,12,557,4.470588235294118
2398883,5,B000AZ0LCM,"Shot entirely in beautiful Patagonia, Argentina, by the great director Carlos Sorin, this film follows the relationship between a middle age working class man who has just lost his work, and a pedigree dog that is given to him as payment for a free lance job he has done at a Southern farm to get some money.
In the beginning, he doesn't know what to do with his new friend, but after a while, he realises that the dog will be the most important companion in his lonesome life; and perhaps, even help him make some profit.",1247961600,19,522,4.391752577319588
2398884,5,B000AZ0LCM,"Since Harry y Tonto in 1974 was exhibited, no other film had acquired such poetic dimension and expressive eloquence beauty like this one.

We are in Patagonia (Argentine) a vast  and lonely territory, the most emblematic wasteland in Latun America, like we made reference to Colorado Canyon, for instance.

This landscape works out as a perfect background  to remark the existential loneliness of this simple man whose kindness nestles in his gaze. Thanks to a favour he makes in the middle of the road, he will be rewarded with a dog named ""Bombon la chien"" , proceeding from a distinguished breed. Since that moment we will engage ourselves with this revitalizing twist of fate in his life around the sympathy and unpredictable subsequent actions.

A movie whose admirable narrative simplicity still demonstrates you don't need a big budget to build a sensitive and thoughtful film.

Don't miss it!",1221177600,3,901,5.054054054054054
2398885,4,B000AZ0LCM,"""Bombn: El Perro"" (= ""Bombn: the dog"") is a film by Carlos Sorn, a well-known Argentine director who was also behind ""Historias mnimas"".

The heart of this road movie is the relationship between a man and his dog. Juan (played by Juan Villegas), is an old mechanic down on his luck that was sacked and can't get a new job, due both to his age and to the economic crisis affecting the country. Everything starts to change for him when, thanks to an act of politeness, he receives a purebred Argentine Dogo as a gift. That very big white dog he didn't want at first will become his good luck charm, and eventually a reason to hope for a better future. The two unlikely friends will begin a journey thoughout the harsh but beautiful Patagonia in search of new opportunities for Coco, meeting new people along the way.

I can say that I enjoyed this simple but heartwarming movie, and that I believe you are likely to appreciate it too, if you are in the mood to watch something that strikes true.

2398886,4,B000AZ0LCM,"""Bombn El Perro"" is a sweet little story from Patagonia, southern part of Argentina. Nothing big happens here. The film's narrative is episodic (or perhaps deceptively so) with two central characters - Coco (Juan Villegas), middle-aged, out-of-work mechanic and a Dogo Argentino, a big white dog whose name is Bombon.

Coco, after working honestly for 20 years at the gas station, is now unemployed. He is looking for a job, selling hand-made knives, but things do not go well. One day, however, Coco is given a dog by a lady whom he had helped on the country road, and since then his life slowly starts to change.

As I said before, the story does not contain big events. Coco and his dog enter the local dog show, but that is not the real goal of these two likable characters or the plot itself. The film shows colorful and realistic characters. (They are played mostly by non-professionals who did effective jobs and Juan Villegas is, believe it or not, actually the director's car parker.) The film is also blessed with authentic shots of various places in Patagonia, but it does not have dramatic tension that some viewers might miss.

Director is Carlos Sorin (""Historias mnimas""). You may remember his ""Eversmile, New Jersey"" and its traveling dentist, which I am afraid is not Daniel Day Lewis's best work. In ""Bombn El Perro,"" however, Carlos Sorin succeeds in blending comedy and pathos in a simple story, greatly supported by the dog who can really act.",1192233600,3,1464,4.801587301587301
2398887,5,B000AZ0LCM,"A lovely, lovely, deceptively ""simple"" movie that left me feeling more than any movie had in years.  It is not a sad movie and it is not a happy movie, and yet it moved me to tears - there is a dignity and humanity about the main character that will always stay with me.  Beautiful indeed.",1153267200,5,289,4.142857142857143
8081119,5,B000AZ0LCM,"First saw this film when living in a foreign country, and fell in love with it.  Haven't been able to catch it again in USA, so, what better way than to have my very own!",1418256000,,170,3.857142857142857

8081122,1,B000AZ0LCM,"Sorry, but this move was crap. It was boring, it didn't really follow a plot, the acting was bad. The main actor had the weirdest and laziest personality. Just completely disappointing. Don't waste your money on this.",1350172800,,217,4.891891891891892
8081123,4,B000AZ0LCM,"I admit that I bought this movie for the adorable dog on the cover.  I really did.  And the dog is adorable in the movie too.  The movie is about a nice, middle aged guy that is sweet and sincere, but kind of lost in his life.  He is hapless, but has a big heart.  The movie is rather simple, but overall I really liked it.",1349568000,,323,3.8333333333333335
8081124,1,B000AZ0LCM,"I was excited about receiving this film since I love foreign films and many recent films from Argentina have just been excellent...except for this one. It does have a tender story line but so many good ideas seem to get wasted in this very slow-moving and uneventful film. I don't need a lot of action for a movie to be great as long as the plot is riveting and holds my attention. I found myself getting up to go to the kitchen often without pausing the film...I didn't miss a thing while gone. Do not recommend this film, don't waste the $$$ or time.",1349136000,,552,4.3173076923076925
8081125,4,B000AZ0LCM,"I bought this movie because I am constantly looking for things to use in my high school Spanish classes.  Story line is more interesting to an adult, and I enjoyed the film.

About an old guy trying to do something productive with his life and time after being laid off, but getting taken advantage of along the way, due to his pacifistic, shy nature.  Not a bad movie, per se, just didn't appeal to me.",1326585600,,288,4.277777777777778
