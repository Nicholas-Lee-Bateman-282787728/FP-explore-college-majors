8018405,4,B0001Z35DS,This was a good starter for some people who want to get into Anime. You can get lost if you aren't paying attention with the plot.,1419465600,,130,4.038461538461538
8018406,5,B0001Z35DS,"Saikano is a strange little tale about a hapless small town school girl who's been turned into a secret ultimate weapon by the military.  Now, before you turn away thinking this is a typical screwball comedy, I assure you, it's not.  It's serious and tragic as we watch the war progress and everyone's life change for the worst.  Even the ending was good, and I usually hate the way animes end.",1225152000,,394,4.52112676056338
8018407,5,B0001Z35DS,"It may be because they put the commercials with the actors or having seen the crazy girl from the first disk get me all excited over watching this until the end but I do like this drama.  The love story continues to falter and hold after battles and struggles with fidelity.  A memorable scene is when the girl can't stand not fighting, almost as if anything else would be more difficult and thrust her back into emotional pain.  Intense.",1211760000,,438,4.518987341772152
8018408,2,B0001Z35DS,"Shuji and Chise's relationship is not going so good these days. Shuji continues to carry on an affair with one of his former teachers and NOT lying to Chise about it. In fact, he flat out tells her. And to me that's even more cruel, because the reason for it is that he no longer sees Chise as human. He cannot be aroused by her because of the ugly scar that is imprinted on her chest from her transformation into the ""Ultimate Weapon"". If they consumated their relationship, I think that Chise's fading humanity would be saved. But Shuji just keeps getting this fearful or disgusted look on his face when he talks to her. The irony is that as long as she has that scar, it means she is still human. No matter how many thousands or millions of people she kills. Because Shuji is not able to give Chise unconditional love, Chise suggests that they break up.

This show is becoming a little trying. Because Shuji is obviously such a complete loser. Chise never asked to become what she has. It was forced on her. If Shuji could just accept her, I think everything would work out. He should treat her like a woman instead of a monster. The tears in this show have come to represent the inborn weakness of the two main stars. I do respect Chise though. At least she's doing something, even though her protection is allowing Shuji to wallow in his own private morass.",1130630400,,1362,4.426294820717131
8018409,5,B0001Z35DS,"What can I say...I'm one of the lucky ones that has been able to get the japaneese version of Saikano here in Chile, and let me tell you (for those who're going to buy the DVD here in amazon.com) the investment you're about to make truly worths your money. In this DVD, you'll see the saddest and deepest part of the chain of events unleashed when Chise reveals to her boyfriend, Shuji, the truth: She is ""The definitive weapon"", the last resource of the Japaneese Army against exterior military threats. Here you'll see how weak is the human beeing when it faces death, disaster, but above all, fate. From this moment on, Chise is no longer human and she can trigger herself by just processing a strong feeling as a menace, and therfore she becomes quite dangerous. You'll also see how Tetsu becomes emotionally involved with Chise, and what finally happens to him, which by the way it's very important in the story because he teaches his most valuable thoiught to Chise. On the other hand, Shuji will learn how to express his feelings and ultimately, they will face the final challenge toegether. Yes, love can move mountains... (i won't give you any spoilers about what's coming so you either search for another source or read the comic books as I did, i'm a true fan of Saikano).
You've just got to see this. It will truly bring tears out of your eyes for hours, and it will leave you thinking about your own existance and the way you spend every minute of your life.
Beeing myself a true otaku, I can tell you this is THE best anime in several years. Shin Takehashi made some extraordinary job with this story that was supposed to be compiled in 4 episodes but finally took 13. You make your own conclussions when you get to wathc this incredible story.",1085961600,5,1758,4.548895899053628
