8607430,4,B0001CNQNA,"I am the father of a 3-yr old girl who has a great imagination, but doesn't laugh easily.  She enjoys watching typical toddler fare, a lot of which is pretty funny (Nemo, Wallace & Gromit, Monsters Inc.), but she takes her viewing seriously, to the point that it's hard to tell if she's actually enjoying it.  A lot of times, she wants to watch alone and asks/tells me to leave!  It's different with this DVD.  She likes seeing real people doing real--often goofy--things.  She seems to respond to seeing other kids laughing and playing with their parents.  She also talks more about what she's seeing on the screen and likes to watch it with others, maybe because she is able to relate more easily to what she sees (as opposed to some of her other shows).  For adults, there are some good ideas about how to interact with your kids in a fun way and how to play with them at their level.  There are a lot of different segments, so if you want you can pick and choose the ones that get the best response.  The songs are really good, too.  Overall, this video is a good option when you and/or your kids are in the mood for something fun, and you might pick up some good ideas on how to get your child to lighten up.",1081468800,,1213,4.280701754385965
8607431,5,B0001CNQNA,"This children's video is one the most entertaining, fun-loving videos I have ever seen. My children ask me nearly every day if they can watch ""the giggle"" DVD. This video provides not only entertainment for children, but also offers ideas for both new and ""experienced"" parents as well as other loved ones ways to share wholesome interaction with children. I hope to see a volume two! Thanks.",1081209600,,392,4.865671641791045
8607432,5,B0001CNQNA,"Our 3-year-old son refers to this DVD as ""the party movie."" And what a party it is! Kids and parents frolicking and laughing. How much more fun does a party get than that? Okay, maybe a few of your college parties were more fun than that, but those days are long gone, buddy, so crank up the fun folksy soundtrack and watch as playful parents get their children to chuckle and show you how to do the same with yours. A purple fuzzy guy with dreadlocks is your silly mascot. For the first three weeks, this one was looping on auto-play 24/7, and it's still a favorite over 6 months later.",1080777600,2,587,4.297297297297297
