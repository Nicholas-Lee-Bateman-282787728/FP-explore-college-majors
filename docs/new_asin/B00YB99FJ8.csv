7210847,5,B00YB99FJ8,"Since Mad Men every network has tried to do period pieces on network tv
CBS had Vegas (which was  awesome to bad nobody gave it a chance)
ABC had Pan Am, and The Astronaut Wives Club
NBC's first  attempt was The Playboy Club (so stupid and pointless)
WGN's Manhattan is freaking amazing in every way  (Check it out)
FOX never once even tried there to busy making old over played cartoons
NBC took a gamble and tried again with Aquarius
Is it worth of the hype? was NBC playing bait and switch or was it something special?
Without a doubt it's deserving of all the hype it got
While it's far from flawless and perfect there is a lot to appreciate and love about it
the detail with the wardrobe, hair, make-up cars, buildings, everything is amazing!
a few episode in you'll feel like you are in 1967  The director did a amazing job
the quality of this series is like a big budget film

The Cast is really good all around
David Duchovny gets to trade in his FBI character for a much better character in Detective  Sam Hodiak
(at first he's a jerk-off but, you have to realize '67 things were so much different you have a middle age man who no longer fits in a police department that's changing in leaps and bounds
Grey Damon  as  ""young"" plain clothes cop Brian Shafe  (great performance he represents all the changes that are coming in the future)
Claire Holt  as  Charmain Tully (the only female cop that wants to be a detective)
Chance Kelly  as  Detective Ed Cutler  (you might not know his name but, your know the actor)
Bran F. O'Byrne  as  Ken Karn  (great performance over all)
David Meunier  as  Roy Kovic (anyone who is a FX Justified fan will know him)
Emma Dumont  as  Emma Karn, (They set her up as the person you as the viewers should see the story through but, there are so many twist and turns
Michaela McManus  as Grace Karn
Jodi Harris  as  Opal ,
Spencer Garrett as  Hal Banyin,
Ambyr Childers  as  Sadie
Graham Beckel as  Lieutenant
Gethin Anthony  as  Charles Manson (This was a very odd casting choice he looks nothing like Manson he has the voice down but, psychically  it don't work) Gethin's version of Manson is the biggest problem with this show over all... Once you get use to him you're over look it but, it does take a lot away
NBC all did the right thing with all original licensed music AAA+++

It's also the most Adult series on there network
(lots of sexually content nothing hard but, NBC usually don't use sex in this way)
The less you know about it the better that might sound hack and lazy but, the story is very complex everything bleeds together
and there's plenty of cool payoffs.....

For anyone who loved american history growing up this is very interesting
The series itself has so much going for it there is a deep social commentary through-out the season
If you put a mirror against 1967 and 2015 have we really gotten better? have things changed for the better or worse?? we still are at war!
 This is a  very different and unique  period crime drama  9.2/10",1446681600,9,3002,4.422303473491773

7210849,5,B00YB99FJ8,"Such an interesting and engaging show. Though its based on certain historical events, the liberties taken make it a fun show to watch that fits into a 12 episode (or so) season. Gethin Anthony especially shines as the crazy Charlie Manson (very different than Game of Thrones fans are used to seeing him). A great watch!",1442793600,9,320,4.732142857142857
7210850,4,B00YB99FJ8,"Everyone knows the name of Charles Manson and his infamous Manson Family. One of the most notorious criminals of the Twentieth Century, Manson led his commune of hippies in a series of grisly killings in the L.A. area near the end of the 1960s. His murder of actress Sharon Tate, the pregnant wife of director Roman Polanski, scandalized Hollywood. NBCs new series, Aquarius, operates as a prequel to those historical events. Seasoned homicide detective Sam Hodiak (David Duchovny) begins investigating Manson and his family of hippie followers when an old friends daughter becomes one of the deranged cult leaders newest disciples. This first season is smart, engaging entertainment that beams with energy from its Summer of Love setting.

It is 1967 in L.A., the height of free love and the beginning of major social upheavals. L.A. detective Sam Hodiak is a strong, intelligent cop looking to do the right thing, even when that means bending a few rules. Hes a pragmatist aware the country is going through changes and simply wants to stay ahead of the curve. An old flame of Sams comes back into his life, Grace. Now married to a rich lawyer, Grace asks Sam to investigate her missing teen daughter, Emma (Emma Dumont). The sixteen-year-old Emma has fallen under the spell of Charles Manson (Gethin Anthony). This charismatic version of Manson is able to charm when necessary. Grace is married to Ken Karn (Bran F. OByrne), a closeted lawyer with ties to the Californian Republican Party. Not everything is initially what it seems on the surface between these people.

Actress Claire Holt, now freed from the CW, is a young female cop looking to make a name for herself despite the old boys club on the police force dismissing her ability. Sam takes a fatherly liking to her, guiding her through a series of increasingly dangerous missions. Sam also takes a young undercover cop under his wing, Brian Shafe (Grey Damon). Brian is a good cop with a rough edge, one that can blend in with the younger generation. He keeps his hair long and is willing to smoke a little dope to stay undercover.

The cult-leader has already amassed a house full of followers, including many young women. The commune is all about free love and espousing Charles hippie philosophies. Under the surface of the outwardly serene, Manson is a boiling sea of rage. Hes willing to hurt or discard anyone that gets in his way. Manson dreams of being a musician and pals around with the music industry. Its a hopeless dream propped up by Manson sharing his women as favors to achieve what he desires. He wants to become more famous than the Beatles.

Filled with a groovy selection of popular tunes from the late Sixties, Aquarius uses the hits wisely. It is the perfect soundtrack for a gritty television drama set in this period. It is also great to see the return of David Duchovny back to network television in a dramatic role. The former X-Files star hasn't lost any of his acting chops from being on Californication the last several years, a premium cable comedy.

The edgy nature of Aquarius is reflected in the challenging risks it takes, including tackling social issues and explicit sexuality. This home video version has additional footage and language than what was broadcast on NBC. What had pushed the envelope on broadcast becomes even more risqu, including the occasional four-letter obscenity and nudity.  Gethin Anthony plays Manson with a sexual swagger and charisma likely beyond historical reality. Aquarius is a dramatic, fictionalized telling of Charles Mansons years before the horrific murders that made him famous. I wouldnt take it as a documentary by any means.

The first half of the season is expertly managed as we learn more and more about the surprising connections between all of these characters. It paints a superb portrait of how a penniless hustler like Manson could seduce so many into following him, including the young Emma. Special mention should be made for Emma Dumont, who shines as the naive teen runaway. Season one of Aquarius is as much about her characters journey than anything else, a wise storytelling move that pays dividends. If there are problems, the procedural undertones later in the season get overly predictable as the show tackles each kind of social issue from the late 1960s like some kind of check list. Womens rights, gay rights, racial issues, a plodding arc about Vietnam; no stone is left unturned in season one.

Ambitious in scope, Aquarius is an edgy broadcast drama with the production values of a premium cable show. Star David Duchovny turns in an admirable performance but Aquarius is more than just his performance. Fans will be excited to see what happens in season two of this excellent new drama that deserves more buzz.

7210855,5,B00YB99FJ8,"What a great show!  And David Duchovny, how can you go wrong!  Surprised that no one has ever ""mined"" this incredibly wild and interesting  period in our history before to do a serious drama about. Because this was more than just about the Manson case, but everything else that was going on in our nation at the time.  So, of course, NBC has cancelled it, after just two seasons.  Maybe if they hadn't moved it all over the schedule, and pre-empted it for weeks for the conventions and the Olympics, it would have gotten a bigger audience share and we'd have at least a 3rd season to look forward to.  Because this show deserved at least a third season to at least wrap up the Manson investigation and trials.  What a shame.",1476316800,,724,4.4393939393939394

I am anxious to see the full second season come out on DVD.  There is always a lot going on in each episode so it is great to get the full season on DVD to see everything again from the beginning.

7210868,3,B00YB99FJ8,"Semi-decent show. The plot is somewhat weak - the Manson character looks and acts nothing like we know him to be. In fact, his character looks so much like a few of the others that you can get them mixed up. This actor does not portray the 'charisma' that Manson used to attract and keep his women. He's too much like any other hippie on the show. He also sings a lot better than the real Manson LOL
David Duchovny's acting is good but he appears a bit bored. The plot is thin. But not bad for a binge watch if you're out of options.",1464739200,2,533,4.085714285714285

7210881,1,B00YB99FJ8,"All I'll say is that the creators of this show accomplished the near impossible - made a boring series based on the Manson family. I didn't believe it could be done, but the convoluted bizarre story lines maybe help. There are a couple great actors, but many more actors I recognize as being the worst from other series, hired because of their resemblance to Barbie and Ken dolls I guess to provide eye candy if nothing else. There are some other story lines going on about how awful it was for women, homosexuals and minorities in the 1960's - so sorry but Man Men did a much better job in that department even though it is interesting to get the West Coast perspective. Pick any one of the Manson Family documentaries out of a hat and I guarantee you it will be far more interesting than this sorry series. Like the Hannibal series, I think this is just made for an audience that loves depravity and violence with no story to get in the way. I can't help wondering what the producers at FX might have done with it - at least they write amazing scripts and characters to serve with their depravity and violence.",1452556800,,1112,4.429268292682927

There are facts in it that, even with all of my researching, I was unaware of and they were facts because I did further research and found them to be true.

7210890,5,B00YB99FJ8,"Aquarius - Season 1 - [0655 - TV series - Police Procedural - November 6, 2015]

Summary:
 This show is like a voyage in the cultural trivia way-back machine for those of us who were in our teens and twenties in the 1960's - Black Panthers - hippies - LA's vice underbelly - Viet-Nam - Nixon - war protestors etc. Against this extravagant backdrop is a smart, gritty police procedural mashed up against the degenerate excesses of Charles Manson and his followers. The interweaving of the principal characters and the Manson cult followers is the fulcrum that makes this a compelling series.

Broadcast Version:
 The 13-episode season 1 was first broadcast on NBC May 28 - August 22, 2015. On June 25, 2015 NBC announced there would be a season 2 of Aquarius.

Retail DVD version:
 Season 1 was released on DVD during September 2015. It contains nudity and sex scenes not shown in the broadcast version. Having seen episode 1 in the broadcast and DVD version I was impressed with both but could do without the extra sex scenes.

Cast:
 David Duchovny as detective Samson ""Sam"" Hodiak is in my estimation reason sufficient to watch this series. He brings believability, empathy and a measure of sanity to a morally obtuse world.
 At first I was put off by Gethin Anthony as Charles Manson. He just seemed too wimpy for the role. I envisioned Manson as a real hard case like a young Christopher Walken on meth. It took a few episodes but I now think Anthony will do just fine as Manson.
 Other supporting cast members are competent and creditable in their roles.

Positive Comments:
 The show has the ""look"" and ""sound"" of 1960's LA. Before cell phones, computers and social networking it's enjoyable to see the innards of a police procedural solving crimes and busting perps.
 The Manson story arc is very interesting and snags most of the principal characters. Nonetheless we are repeatedly informed that, yes, some of the characters are based upon real people but the story line is mostly fiction - good fiction, but still fiction.

Negative Comments:
 Manson is portrayed as a low-life looser yet we are made to believe that he could compel a bevy extremely attractive young ladies to worship him. To see these teen-queens fawn over him is hard to accept. True the ""real"" Manson had female followers but in this fictionalized show his ""sex appeal"" is difficult to accept.

Conclusion:
 This is as sharp as a tack 1960's Los Angeles police procedural against the backdrop of Charles Manson's degenerate life story. It has a gritty period look, some excellent actors and an intriguing story line. I enjoyed watching it and l am looking forward with baited anticipation for season 2.",1446681600,13,2681,4.793478260869565

8718112,5,B00YB99FJ8,I've watched most of episodes so far I'm surprised how well the acting is especially Gethin Anthony as young Manson. Anthony is one of the most underrated actors of our time but hopefully that will change. His definitely a chameleon adapting well to any environment or human personality he's asked to portray. In Aquarius he is very charming at first then becomes more unhinged and violent unlike the character in Helter Shelter movie which he gives orders to kill to his followers. Gethin Anthony is a very charismatic and seductive person and shines in his portrayal of Manson. Unlike many actors he's a real professional as he attended college and graduated from the top school in London then went to the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts on scholarship. His adaptation of delects is impressive and perfect. I would recommend this series of the movies to everyone who wants to learn how people resort to murder and have the ability of persuasion.

8718114,4,B00YB99FJ8,"There a are many troubling things about Aquarius, not least of it that some people think it's a true story.  It's definitely fiction, and things did not look or sound as depicted in Aquarius.  But the depravity of the story sure feels authentic and makes it hard to look away.  If the mixing of characters who existed with those who never existed wasn't confusing enough, the story is told in flashbacks (""16 months earlier...."")  Good luck following that.

The acting and dialog are mostly top notch and some of Duchovny's exchanges are priceless.  A sordid and depressing story, well told.  Or, as we said in those days, life sucks and then you die.",1498780800,3,651,4.707964601769912
