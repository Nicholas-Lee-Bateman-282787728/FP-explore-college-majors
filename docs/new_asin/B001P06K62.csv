8331835,4,B001P06K62,"Traditionally the title of a non-fiction publication makes a fictitious statement about its contents, so it is natural that the DVD ""How To Draw A Portrait"" by Chuck Vogan does not show the viewer how to draw anything in the normal sense of the word ""draw"".  Instead, it shows the method of copying a portrait photograph onto drawing paper by using grids.  Mr. Vogan says that he discovered this method.  Since there are already thousands of people who copy photos using grids, I presume he means that he had a personal revelation.

Using a photograph of Abraham Lincoln as an example, the DVD demonstrates the following procedure:

1. Use a computer and printer (or a commercial printing service) to make a black-and-white print of a portrait photo on 8 1/2 by 11 inch paper

2. Draw a grid of 1 inch squares on the photo, positioned so one grid line is roughly down the centerline of the photo.

3. Draw a similar grid of 2 inch squares lightly on  a sheet of 18 x 24 inch archival drawing paper.

4. Locate points on the gridlines of the photo that belong to outlines of significant areas on the photo.  (He calls these ""way points"".)  Measure these locations to the nearest 1/32 nd of an inch using a ruler  that has divisions of 1/16 th of an inch.

5. Double the measurements and use these values to locate the corresponding ""way points"" on the drawing.  Mark them lightly.

6. Lightly draw the boundaries of features by drawing lines through the appropriate ""way points"".  Using darker pencils, shade, blend and erase in order to duplicate the photograph.

One aspect of Chuck's method that seems slightly nutty to me is the use of a ruler divided into 1/16 ths of an inch.  Perhaps I have not learned how to appreciate thinking happy thoughts like  ""seventeen thirtyseconds  times two is thirtyfour thirtyseconds, which is one and two thirtyseconds, which is one and one sixteenth of an inch"".  My inclination would be to use a child's compass to measure a distance on the photograph and swing it in an arc on the drawing to double that distance.  A more dignified approach would be to add a draftsman's dividers or a ""proportional caliper"" to the list of permitted implements.  A liberal minded person could also investigate the advantages of the metric system.

It's rather hopeless for a a reviewer to protest against misleading titles and packaging.  So the cover of the DVD case shows someone drawing a portrait of Lincoln without a grid line in sight?  - so what?  Aren't consumers supposed to be savy enough not to trust the cover?

Let's evaluate this product for what it is, a DVD instructing the viewer how to use grids to copy a photo with pencils.  From that point of view, Chuck Vogan does a crackerjack job.  I rate this DVD as four stars out of five to indicated that it is an above average demonstration of how to perform that task.  Chuck narrates clearly.  He is speaking from a carefully written script.  The DVD demonstrates how he shades eyes, mouth, nose, hair, clothes etc.  In addition to Mr. Lincolns features, we also see a demonstration of a non-Lincoln eye and some non-Lincoln teeth being done.  The video has many shots showing Chuck working on  a detail in the drawing in one window and the photo itself in another window with an arrow indicating the subject of the work.  Chuck gives some useful hints.  One important piece of advice is not to get into the situation of trying to draw a portrait of some ancestor from a hazy or small photograph since the photo won't be clear enough when printed as an 8 1/2 by 11.

There are a few things to quibble about.  Chuck calls kneaded erases ""gum erasers"".  He makes some inconsequential statements about how perspective  in three dimensions on a two dimensional grid has something to do with putting a grid on a two dimensional photo.  Some might object to his statement that the presence of a sharp edge in a pencil drawing shows that it was done by an amateur.  Chuck might object to statements by prominent drawing teachers that one should not draw a line by making dozens of tiny strokes each a fraction of an inch long, since that is what he does.

Anyone who does not understand the procedure of copying photos in pencil by using grids and needs detailed instruction can get it from this DVD.",1271462400,5,4282,4.613245033112583
