7385168,5,B0146L092C,Best show ever.,1464220800,,15,4.333333333333333
7385169,3,B0146L092C,"Isn't complete. Doesn't include webisodes, which makes it incomplete.",1462665600,13,69,6.777777777777778
7385170,5,B0146L092C,"One of the best Sci-Fi series ever.  This box set, just like the show, is a work of art.",1461110400,,88,3.6315789473684212
7385171,5,B0146L092C,"Battlestar Galactica - The Ultimate Collection is all blu-ray disks and even the Caprica series in 1080p.  This is the re-envisioned series from the 2000s, not the original series.  Nor does this contain the original series in any form.",1459296000,6,236,5.0256410256410255
7385172,5,B0146L092C,"This product has been 'MOST EXCELLENT"". I've been looking for this show in Blu-ray and with all the added stuff that came with it I was quite pleased. I would recommend this product to anyone that is a Battlestar Galactica  fan.",1453766400,2,228,4.560975609756097

7385174,4,B0146L092C,"This series is amazing!  This set in particular will satisfy any BSG aficionado.  The packaging is a perfect representation of the series...from the layout to the shape.  The discs have plenty of extra features that will provide hours of entertainment.

I only gave four stars, which isn't reflective of the series itself.

Like some of the other reviewers have mentioned, the Caprica discs will NOT play on any of my BluRay players, including PS3 (United States).  The BSG discs all play fine on all of my players, but the Caprica is a no-go.  I even bought a new BluRay player (Samsung) hoping that it would mitigate the problem, but keep getting a message about ""disc restrictions"" when I try to navigate the disc menu.

Looks like I will be looking for a multi-region BluRay player.",1485561600,,786,4.770370370370371
7385175,3,B0146L092C,"Love the series, just not this boxed set.  Most of BSG worked fine on our Panasonic Blu-Ray.  One disc wouldn't, but I got it to play on a Sony PS3.  First disc of Caprica wouldn't play on either and I have not tried the rest yet.  I would advise buying them a different way.  Since I'm outside the return window, I may give this to my brother and try again or sell it on eBay and order normal dvds and not Blu-Ray.  So five stars for the series, but one star for this boxed set.",1485216000,4,479,3.9894736842105263
7385176,5,B0146L092C,It's BS Fracking G! All of it! Bought this because I finally talked my wife into giving BSG a chance after doing the same with GOT. She enjoyed GOT so I figured a great reason to buy this.,1480982400,,188,3.973684210526316
7385177,5,B0146L092C,I recently purchased this and for all you Battlestar Galactica fans currently living in the United States that would love to have this collection but worried that it won't work and United States Blu-ray players I have this to say I have an LG Blu ray 3D player and it works and the Blu-ray player if it does not it will work in your PS3 which is region free so if you have a Blu-ray player and a PS3 and the collection won't work on your Blu-ray player it will work in your PS3 I have not watched it fully yet because it's supposed to be a Christmas present but I will have a Battlestar marathon on Christmas morn,1480723200,,613,4.159663865546219
7385178,5,B0146L092C,Fantastic.,1477958400,,10,10.0
7385179,2,B0146L092C,Was this used? My bad if I didn't notice but there were some small dings to the case and part of the box label had peeled off. The main complaint is that at least 3+ discs won't play so I have to return it. Bummer,1477008000,2,213,3.7555555555555555
7385180,4,B0146L092C,"Unfortunately I have a stand-alone Sony and my one computer that has a Blu Ray player is also a Sony.  So all Caprica discs fail to get past the screen where you pick the language of the menus.  I tried going to Sony for help but they put their hands up.  If you have Sony and can live without seeing Caprica until you get around to swapping out for a better Blu Ray player, then this is the box set for you.

Even with Caprica unplayable, this collection still ranks 4 stars.  The show itself is 5 stars.  Sure there are some weaker moments such as the fleet's pit stop in New Caprica, but the good far outweighs the bad here in this quality show.  The showrunner is currently doing Outlander, the second highest production value in television today (behind GoT).  He does quality work.  Buy this.",1476748800,,798,4.374149659863946
7385181,5,B0146L092C,Truly the ultimate collection for any fan of the rebooted series on Syfy.,1475193600,,73,4.6923076923076925
7385182,5,B0146L092C,"Having the complete Battlestar Galactica set is perfect. It even comes with the prequel series Caprica, the two movies and the mini series. And the binding is beautiful too. Well worth it.",1473897600,,188,4.90625
7385183,5,B0146L092C,Amazing and comprehensive collection of one of the best sci-fi series ever created! Fantastic purchase. So Say We All.,1472947200,,118,5.2631578947368425
7385184,3,B0146L092C,"It was just great until we wanted to watch Caprica, and the disks won't play.  We get a message about having to change resolution,  which is nonsense.  And it's past the return period, so we're stuck with a collection we can only watch part of.",1471478400,9,244,4.377777777777778

7385187,4,B0146L092C,"Buyer beware, I couldn't get the Caprica disks to play in either of my (different model) Sony Blu Ray players. I had to play them on my XBox One. All the other disks besides Caprica played fine.",1468540800,6,194,4.27027027027027
7385188,5,B0146L092C,Love the series and completely love the packaging.  I admired the way their books had their corners squared and was in awe when this collector set did too.  Thank You!!,1467072000,,168,4.566666666666666
7385189,5,B0146L092C,Sci-fi at its best.,1466899200,,19,4.0
7385190,5,B0146L092C,The ultimate collection says it all and region free!  If you want everything on the reimagined series then this is the collection you want.,1466467200,,139,4.791666666666667
7385191,5,B0146L092C,"This review is for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Battlestar-Galactica-The-Ultimate-Collection-Blu-ray-Region-Free/dp/B0146L092C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Battlestar Galactica - The Ultimate Collection [Blu-ray] [Region Free</a>] ...and it is just that! (If the link doesn't work - it's the blackish Ultimate Collection blu ray box set with the seal in front and angled edges (the shape of the books you see in the series).

The box came a little scuffed, but I don't mind. The product packaging is fantastic. Hard box, then book containing all the disks. Think one of those children's books with the cardboard pages, with the disks embedded in pockets. Episode list on each page with character pictures and quotes and a booklet in the back.

VERY IMPORTANT: I was worried about having to buy more. This includes everything. I read through a lot of overly complicated reviews telling you which to buy for your needs. They were very helpful reviews, but let me make it simple: THIS IS IT. It has everything: ALL of BSG (Razon, The Plan, Blood&Chrome), all of Caprica, and a ton of special features including behind the scenes, deleted scenes, and extended episodes...that's 27 disks of awesomeness. This set is all-region and works fine for me here in the US.

Worth it.
Enjoy!",1465516800,49,1321,5.595
7385192,4,B0146L092C,This show is awesome. The only problem I see some times the screen goes into squares when there are dark scenes. The box was not perfect when I received it. It may have been the packaging. But the design is great for collectible.,1465084800,,229,4.348837209302325
8729934,5,B0146L092C,"Has all the media a BSG fan could ever want!  Love it.  My one complaint/warning is that the extended versions of episodes play AFTER the original length episodes. If you don't check ahead on the disc (and one extended version is actually on the following disc), 80% of what you see on the extended version, you have just watched. Extended versions should play first OR a the original versions should have a 10-12 'notice' that another version is available. Having said that, DO make sure you watch the extended versions. They add a lot to the respective story lines.",1498867200,,567,4.717171717171717
8729935,4,B0146L092C,Although I live in the US getting a UK version of the show did not take away from the thrill of having the entire series with the complete Spano's as well in the case. The only drawback I saw was sometimes it was difficult to remove the Blu-rays from their sleeves.  I was sad when the series finally ended but it was better that way so I didn't go on until the ratings would kill it if they took it too long,1495238400,,408,3.975609756097561
8729936,5,B0146L092C,"This is one great package set.  Looks good, plays perfect and love the packaging.
Order was what  I wanted and shipped on time.
Could have used better shipping packaging but it arrived in perfect shape.

Great job",1493856000,,213,4.702702702702703
8729937,5,B0146L092C,I recommend watching the Caprica Prequel and then Battlestar Galactica. This is a great purchase for any fan.,1493078400,,109,5.111111111111111
8729938,4,B0146L092C,"I loved the original, but this is good too, it almost a completely different story.  I'm not going to ruin it for anyone who hasn't watch this yet, but you could easily this into a drinking game every time someone says ""cylon"" or is a cylon.  It's Sci-Fi, so it already has bonus points in my book, it's not The Expanse,  https://www.amazon.com/The-Expanse-Season-1/dp/B018BZ3SCM but it's good.  As for The Expanse, you gotta watch it, forget anything else that your binge watching, that is the show to watch, going to download the books and start on them as well.",1491955200,,564,4.783505154639175

8729940,5,B0146L092C,I'm a big fan of BG. I love this set.,1489881600,,37,2.8
8729941,5,B0146L092C,"Was this used?  Bought this 2 days ago for the awesome price of $138.99. It was advertised as new.  Product came today and did not have the MFGR's platic wrapper on, it was however inside a sheath of bubblewrap. HMMM?  Other than part of the top paper covering coming slightly undone (easily fixed with some Elmers Glue, it was in near perfect shape.  There was an inside crease on the thick cardboard between the end of BSG and the beginning of Caprica, but nothing major.  All this leads me to believe that the item was used.  Since I did read that some people were having issues in getting the Caprica discs to play on their american Blu ray players, I was slightly nervous myself, but I popped the first Caprica disc into my Oppo BD-103 and it played without a hitch. Other than the slightly dubious listed condition of the product, I love it.",1487116800,4,847,4.467532467532467
