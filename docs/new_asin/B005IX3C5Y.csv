4710621,4,B005IX3C5Y,"I had watched this when it was on tv and had most of it taped on vhs, but I no longer have a VCR and it wasn't complete anyway. I've only watched this once since I bought but enjoyed seeing it again, and will definitely rewatch it. Price was reasonable even with shipping, exchange, and tax. Whether you've seen it or not, this is a good modern version of the story, with a vehicle somewhat like the more recent theatrical movie The Core. It's unfortunately the pilot never got continued in a full season or a miniseries. The characters and premise were interesting.",1362700800,5,566,4.504854368932039
4710622,4,B005IX3C5Y,"This was one of the better twists on the original ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" Story.  I Liked the ensemble cast approach and fast paced action of the film.  In terms of the characters, one memorable one stands out which is ""Dallas"", short for Daedalus, a peace loving yeti-like creature who joins the team of explorers midway through the film.

While I love the fast pace, it also felt at times that the producers were squeezing in too much story at 90 minutes and it really would have benefited from an extra half hour to let everything play out properly.  This would have been a natural for a weekly television series and you get the sense at the end of the film that this was the intention but it never materialized.

F. Murray Abraham of ""Amadeus"" fame has a cameo role at the beginning of the film which is important to the overall story development.

All in all though, an enjoyable diversion!",1353110400,5,908,4.5060975609756095
4710623,5,B005IX3C5Y,"Wow ! Got to give this older movie a 5 star rating! I had seen this on TV years ago, but could not find it anywhere. But did find it at Amazon. The quality was very good and shipping was fast. Good work guys!

If you are a movie critic, you may not give it a 5 star rating, but it is very good anyway. Very intertaining. It is really different from most Sci-Fi movies. Some explorers enter an undergorund world through a volcano.
 If you never saw this movie, try it!",1325289600,6,467,4.065217391304348
