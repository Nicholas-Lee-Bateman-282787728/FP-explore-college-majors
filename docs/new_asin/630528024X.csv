Combine that with a great plot and you have something that could've been a major blockbuster. Unfortunately, it was overlooked by hollywood. I highly reccomend this film. You won't be disapointed.",1300060800,,282,4.66
7886646,1,630528024X,"Haven't seen this flick but whenever amazon.com rates an item as ""not for sale to persons under age 18"" take it seriously.  The reviewer (hmph!) below who says this is good for the whole family likes to place honey-smelling mudpies (so to speak) in the path and run away snickering.",1120953600,,282,4.64
7886647,3,630528024X,"I give it three stars for the actors and the story, but not for the quality of the DVD.  The picture quality is about that of a VHS, but there are no, and I mean no, extras on it.  No trailers, no cast bio's, not even scene selections.  Whoever cranked this out should take some lessons on what is expected of this format.",986947200,6,322,4.079365079365079
