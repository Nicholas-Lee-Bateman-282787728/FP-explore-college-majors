3137246,4,B00151QYC6,"I just saw this for the first time on LMN a few days ago, and this is better than most of the tawdry dramatics of Lifetime's psycho chick movies.  If you liked Rose McGowan in Devil in the Flesh and Josie Davis in The Perfect Assistant, chances are that this movie will be up your alley too.  Don't be fooled by the DVD cover, because it's not that gorey.  It is predictable, as all these genres are, but our Dear Abbey Reed (played very convincingly by little known Miariana Klaveno) is definitely one twisted sister who won't let anybody or anything get in the way of her obsession with the attorney who once took her away from her horrible, abusive mother.  I always like Gail O'Grady and William R. Moses, but they don't shine in their roles like Klaveno, whose character is sweet and idyllic one moment, and then truly scary and menacing the next.  That angry look on her face all the time is enough to give you the creeps, and you wonder why nobody else notices it until it's too late.  Nothing groundbreaking, but it's impossible to turn off because Abbey always keeps you wondering what she will do and how she will do it next.  If anything, this movie really makes you consider background checks a lot more thoroughly when employing somebody into the sanctity of your home!",1322179200,,1282,4.523809523809524
3137247,3,B00151QYC6,"Psycho babysitters are nothing new.  Remember Rebecca DeMornay's HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE?
This Lifetime movie was originally titled WHILE THE CHILDREN SLEEP is one of those guilty pleasures.  Every move is calculated to be predictable:  the lecherous partner of our ignorant dad; the nosy neighbor who knows too much; the workaholic mom who loses her child's affections; the mom's sexy and suspicious best friend.  All fall prey to the malevolent sitter.  The movie does have a twist at the end I didn't see coming.
Mariana Klaveno is quite good as Abby, the sitter, effortlessly switching from sweet to savage at the drop of a shovel.  Gail O'Grady, William R Moses and Stacy Haiduk are good if not memorable.

Abby is a demented live-in nanny with a false identity, who zeros in on Meghan's family and is determined to take over her life.

3137294,3,B00151QYC6,"This was a made for TV movie in 2007 which is why it is unrated. There are some PG-13 scenes. Abbey Reed (Mariana Klaveno)moves in as a nanny with the Eastman family in Carpenter Falls, a bay city with that looks like LA. There are no mysteries. When people die, we see her kill them. We also know who is next, especially the ""Gladys Kravitz"" neighbor. Abbey was an abused child from the opening scene. In spite of that, there is a slight mystery, so slight I wouldn't call it a twist, even a TV twist.

The writing was formulaic. The acting was mostly made for TV grade, along with the unimaginative credit fonts and lame music used in every made for TV film ever made. There are no real surprises and might do as a family night slasher rental, i.e. threaten the kids you are going to hire a nanny if they don't behave.",1388102400,2,820,4.290322580645161

This is the same story that has been done many times before, with the babysitter trying to take over the family. There is a slight plot twist at the end but it's nothing that makes the story great. From the beginning I thought Abby's character could have been done better. Right away she starts murdering people and seems to have no fear at all of getting caught or seen by someone. It is a little hard to believe that a person like her would be capable of killing so many people and getting away with it.

Toward the end of the movie when she just starts making it obvious what she's doing, it makes the whole thing kind of pointless. Obviously if the husband knows that she pushed the wife down the stairs he will never willingly be with her, so what exactly is she trying to do? The story would have made more sense if she was trying to make it look like an accident and make the husband fall in love with her.",1353456000,,940,4.280898876404494
3137300,5,B00151QYC6,One of my favorite lifetime movies. Abby will have you on the edge of your seat wondering what she is going to do next. So much drama!,1340928000,,134,4.0
3137301,3,B00151QYC6,"Featuring a married couple who hire a delusional nanny, The Sitter (2007) is a psychological suspense thriller that while not offering anything that is really new, still manages to hold your interest and entertain, as it proceeds to a somewhat predictable conclusion.  The film originally aired on Lifetime, under the title While The Children Sleep.

William R. Moses, perhaps best known for appearing in numerous Perry Mason TV movies, is Carter Eastman, a lawyer and father of two.  Carter and his wife Meghan (Gail O'Grady, NYPD Blue), a real estate broker, decide to hire a live-in nanny, so that Meghan can return to work.  Young, personable, and attractive, Abby Reed (Mariana Klaveno) is hired, to look after the Eastman's kids, Casey and Max, and soon becomes part of the family.  It is revealed very early that Abby has her eye on Carter, and from here it's kind of a familiar story, as she begins to undermine Meghan.  Then, in order to keep her secrets from coming to light, Abby resorts to homicide, and then the fun really begins.

The story has little happening in the romance and sex departments, and focuses more on the family's changing dynamics, and Abby's delusions and increasingly violent acts.  You know Abby will engage in mayhem, the question is how extreme it will be.  The worst is when one of Carter's friends gets a shovel slammed into his neck.  Meghan's nosy neighbor who is suspicious of Abby, also incurs her wrath.  And poor Meghan takes a fall down the same flight of steps twice!  Mariana Klaveno (True Blood) pulls off being the deranged Abby quite well.  While Gail O'Grady and William R. Moses, are fairly credible as the too trusting couple.  The twist involving Abby's past isn't very realistic, but it's still a very good fit in a drama like this.

Although ""unrated"", this made for television movie is has no nudity, and probably features just PG-13 type violence.  Abby's outrageous initial murder is a decisive turning point, after which it is clear that the journey to follow will be more twisted and fun, than genuinely serious.  As such, The Sitter is a decent watch for a few thrills and some wicked laughs.",1322524800,,2155,4.8125
