7950505,5,B00005QFEQ,"What a wonderful series.  Who knew that Harry Potter's uncle could be so entertaining.  Truthfully, this is a great little British mystery series with some great comedy and terrific characters thrown in for good measure (sounds like a recipe, huh?).  This series really needs to be released over here.  It is so unfair that it is available in the British Kingdom, but will not play on our machines in the US.",1197504000,,408,4.704225352112676
7950506,5,B00005QFEQ,"From the cover....After being shot on duty, Detective Inspector Henry Crabbe decides, against the will of his superiors and his accountant wife, to retire and open his own restaurant- Pie In The Sky.  Of course, life is never simple and between his first love-cooking- and being constantly called back on duty by a needy ex-boss, Chief Constable Fisher, Henry finds that he's not going to fulfill his dream in peace.

A lighthearted British mystery series with good plot and great acting.",1137456000,4,488,5.012345679012346
