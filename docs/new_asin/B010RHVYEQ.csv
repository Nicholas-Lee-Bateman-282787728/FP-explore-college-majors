I can feel it all over my legs and glutes.  I always love Linda's workout!  Honestly, I think it's one of the best workout I've ever done and I've been exercising for 20 years!",1465171200,,312,4.220338983050848
8723034,5,B010RHVYEQ,"I've only been doing Linda's Barlates workouts for less than four weeks, and I've already noticed a huge difference in how my clothes are fitting and how my body is shaping up.  I discovered her workouts through some posts on the Video Fitness forum, and have purchased all five of her DVDs and fifteen of her downloads.  I can't get enough of how great these make you feel!

I consider myself an advanced exerciser (I do a lot of Tonique, Cathe Freidrich, Dream Body, and Ballet Beautiful), and these are giving me better results with less cardio and less burnout.  I'm an hourglass shape who carries most of my weight in my lower half, and these are slimming me down.  My husband even commented yesterday that my rear was getting ""skinny"" -- and let me tell you that my rear has never been described as ""skinny"" before.  :-)

To do this DVD, you'll need a resistance band and also at least one circular band like the ones in this set:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aylio-3-Loop-Fitness-Bands-Stretch-Exercise-Set-for-Legs-Light-Medium-Heavy-Resistance/dp/B0054MQUHQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aylio 3 Loop Fitness Bands Stretch Exercise Set for Legs (Light, Medium, Heavy Resistance)</a>

This specific DVD has the following premixes:

Full Workout (95 Minutes)
Upper Body Only (44 Minutes)
Lower Body Only (50 Minutes)
Upper & Cardio (55 Minutes)
Lower & Cardio (61 Minutes)

You can also select individual chapters:

Warm Up (6 Minutes)
Upper Body (21 Minutes)
Cardio Legs (11 Minutes)
Barre Legs (23 Minutes)
Glutes (15 Minutes
Abs (11 Minutes)
Stretch (6 Minutes)

The low-weight, high-rep format will have your muscles screaming, and these kinds of exercises work really well for us hourglasses.

The production value is pretty basic on this DVD and the music is generic, but the workouts are still so fun and effective that I don't mind.  You can also stream your own music if you want something louder and more upbeat.

On her website, Linda has some suggestions of how to rotate her workouts, and here is the basic template:

Day 1: Upper Body and Abs (additional cardio optional)

Day 2: Lower Body (additional cardio optional)

Day 3: Total Body (additional cardio optional)

Day 4: Upper Body (additional cardio optional)

Day 5: Lower Body and Abs (additional cardio optional)

Day 6: Total Body (additional cardio optional)

Day 7: Active rest or yoga/stretching workout

Since most of her workouts are about 20-40 minutes, I've been mixing and matching two of them a day, about five days a week.  Linda also has a ton of free workouts on her YouTube site so you can try them out before committing to buying anything.

Barlates is my newest obsession, and I love how low-key, positive, and yet tough Linda is.  She's fantastic!",1448668800,4,2787,5.178970917225951
