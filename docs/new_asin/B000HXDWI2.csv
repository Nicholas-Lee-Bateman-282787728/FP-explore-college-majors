2647810,2,B000HXDWI2,"This is a movie for women. If you are expecting a teenage sex comedy romp with gratuitous nudity, this is not your film.

Kelly Brook sporting a bad Italian accent-yes? comes to Newcastle and opens up a school for seduction. It is in part a confidence school for the women, who try what they learn in class at home, but without the kind of results that they hoped for. The results border on comedy and tragedy as the women come to terms that the problems in their life have nothing to do with their ability to seduce. For the guys you might want to check out Kelly Brook stroking a broom handle. There is no full frontal female nudity, just male from behind nudity.

The frequent use of boring Italian music soundtrack was too much to endure. The movie is not hilarious or brilliant. The cockney accents were so thick, that at times I had difficulty understanding the dialogue, for what it was worth. Gals, do your guy a favor and don't make him watch this movie as all men are stupid and self-centered (so what else is new?).",1282521600,2,1026,4.423280423280423
2647811,4,B000HXDWI2,"This is a great movie for the girls. It brought different types of women together. The movie did have a funny side and a serious side, but it was about girls helping each other when they needed it the most.",1271894400,,206,4.175
2647812,3,B000HXDWI2,"After watching the Ballykissangel Series, I became a fan of Dervla Kirwan and purchased this movie solely for the purpose of seeing her in a role other than Assumpta Fitzgerald.  She is an accomplished actress with a great range, and I would like to see much more of her; however, in the US, it is difficult to find her work.

Overall, this is a fun movie, probably a PG13, but not offensive.",1244678400,5,392,4.430555555555555
2647813,2,B000HXDWI2,"Yes I will admit I bought this movie only because it features Kelly Brook!  I read the description and thought I might possibly enjoy the movie for it's other merits.  I'm usually a fan of action, adventure, thriller type movies and about 10 minutes into this movie I realized I was watching a Euro Chick flick.  It was not quite as shallow as most American chick flicks but almost.

Okay. I have to admit I was expecting/hoping to see Kelly in some sexy clothes and maybe a bikini or even a nude scene. There was none of the above.

You might like this movie if you want to watch a chick flick.

If you are fan of Kelly Brook you should check out Survival Island.

It's an adventure movie and Kelly is in a bikini showing off her nice legs and everything else for the entire film.

2647814,4,B000HXDWI2,"This movie I caught by pure accident.  I caught it in the middle and laughed all the way till the end.  The plot is funny, the females are awesome, everyone has a friend or loved one like one of them.  If you want to a have girl night, with margaritas and tons of fun get this and sex and the city and your night we be the best night!!",1235260800,,335,3.8260869565217392
2647815,5,B000HXDWI2,"This was a light-hearted treatment of some hard-to-discuss perspectives on life.  It was ""alsost G"" in its approach to the ""M"" material and did it with a lot of class.  I will be looking for more from these collaborators.",1210464000,4,221,4.641025641025641
2647816,4,B000HXDWI2,"This is a wonderful little find of a movie. A mysterious women arrives and a group of ordinary, overworked women decide to undertake her course in seduction Italian style. But this is more than a film about how to stand in high heels, like The Full Monty, School for Seduction is at its heart about worth and how one values oneself whether at home or at work.",1206489600,7,359,4.373134328358209

8142120,5,B000HXDWI2,"This is the BEST movie for learning about seduction (smile).  It was hard to understand what the characters were saying a few times.  Because of the accent if they spoke too quickly or mumbled, you had no clue what they said.  BUT the story line is just precious and watching the women (and one guy) change and evolve over the course of the movie was fun.  Some really hysterical parts, too.  I caught this movie on one of those pay movie clubs (netf**x) and liked it enough to order the DVD to watch over and again.  It is a very feel-good movie!",1394928000,,547,4.313725490196078
8142121,1,B000HXDWI2,"I got this because Kelly Brook was in it, I have her ""survival island"" movie not bad at all and she shows off her sexy breast and ass in that movie, I though I would at least see as much, exspecially with the name of the movie as it was. but it sucked, no skin, a boring story line, and I will be trading this title in asap. I would like to have my money, and time back for even watching this stupid flick",1380326400,,405,3.8333333333333335

8142124,5,B000HXDWI2,"I first found this movie while working at a video store, and was bowled over by it's charms. The gorgeous Kelly Brook stars as an Italian seductress who arrives in Newcastle, England to open a 'School of Seduction' for lonely women who want to please a man, and soon she receives more than she bargained for with women from different backgrounds, each having issues with their love lives. The premise, while not original, is well directed by Sue Heel, with excellent performances from the female cast, including Dervla Kirwan as Claire. She's the highlight of the movie for me, living with a boorishly sexist husband who's only love is his Alfa Romeo Spyder. Sometimes the thick English accents are hard to understand (no subtitles are available)..but the humor is well played (including one hilarious scene in the fish and chip shop to the strains of Nat King Cole)..definitely a charmer.",1294617600,,889,4.933333333333334
8142125,5,B000HXDWI2,"I actually saw this movie on cable, and had to purchase it for my collection! Although it has no subtitle options (because sometimes the British accents can be hard to understand for an American (like myself :), the movie was quite enjoyable. Initially I thought the movie was about learning the art of seduction, but it's about coming into your own, and accepting everything that makes a woman confident and self-sufficient!",1291334400,,425,5.0
