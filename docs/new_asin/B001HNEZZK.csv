Easily one of my favorite travel adventure videos. Been chasing this ever since they broadcast this piece on PBS. Took another year for this to be released on DVD. Jay Harding has done a wonderful job taking us along on one of the most amazing ski-hike experiences in the Alps going across three countries over a 7-day period.  If I ever get my skiing right, this is one adventure I would love to go on.  A mus-have for any travel/adventure enthusiast, and especially if you are also a ski-enthusiast.
Having said that, one thing that often irritates me about GlobeTrekker films is their tendency to film in both high and low resolution and then mix them both in their final film-edits. But given the awesome subject matter and coverage in this film, I am quite happy to overlook this one jarring aspect and endorse this wholeheartedly.",1353715200,,947,5.4353741496598635

8309170,5,B001HNEZZK,Globe Trekker has come out with one of there best film productions yet. The photography is absolutely stunning and I am willing to bet that this was one of their most challenging trips to capture well on film. Captures the sheer beauty of the Alps and some of the challenges facing area explorers and many of the hidden perils that lurk in this pretty extreme environment. This company has really matured and improved in there quality of productions and I look forward to their coming products !!!,1232928000,2,497,4.724137931034483
