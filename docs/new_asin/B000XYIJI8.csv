3010167,5,B000XYIJI8,"As a college student who has to almost daily confront the skeptical and downright atheistic stuff that passes for modern scholarship, this new DVD release is a literal God-send.  In the end, Dawkins/Hitchens/Harris' (etal)beef is really with the Bible and this program powerfully refutes the argument that the Bible is - as the title suggests - a fable or a fraud.  It is a FACT, the ultimate fact (in fact) and without it and its worldview the possibility of knowing any thing as a fact (including whether Richard Dawkins even exists) goes right out the proverbial window.  GREAT STUFF!!!!!!! Thank you, Dr. Kennedy...this program is just one more jewel in your crown.",1193529600,4,669,4.955357142857143

8230272,5,B000XYIJI8,Well presented and informative. A must see documentary. A most see for all believers  as well as non-believers. Highly recommended.,1402617600,,131,5.55
8230273,5,B000XYIJI8,"This is  a very good documentary to be seen by Christians especially the youths because it is their generation who are vulnerable to the deceptful ideas or thoughts that are popping out ,which if not answered point by point by  Christian Apologetics Experts such as seen in this video will be swayed into wrong beliefs and will lose faith in the true biblical Christ who is our Savior and Lord. I highly recommend this to be viewed in young people gatherings of the churches.",1358812800,,475,4.642857142857143
8230274,1,B000XYIJI8,"It is very interesting the amount of strawman, ad hominem's and even deliberate dishonest tactics being used in this so-called documentary. During the beginning of the documentary they try to equate the higher criticism was liberalism and then attribute the thinkers such as Strauss as antisemitic. Anyone who has read Frederick Strauss work that he attributed much of the Gospel accounts of Jesus as mythic creations. The earliest mention of higher criticism being equated with antisemitism is in an article titled ""Higher Criticism, Higher Antisemitism,"" written by a rabbi who is complaining that the Higher Critics do not allow for Jewish Scholars to lay claim to the authenticity of the rabbinic claims of Jewish origins.

In many cases their conflation of Higher Criticism with Liberalism is based on a modern understanding of liberal politics, when in reality liberal politics in the 1920s had very many of the same traits that conservative politics have today.

They also make the most astounding use of an appeal to authority by claiming that this one fringe New Testament Scholar says that all the books of the New Testament could be dated before 40CE. And the most ridiculous claim being made above all is this conflation of this notion that of a scholar is going against the mainstream of his own school of thought he is to be taken credible on face value, and they use an analogy of law to get this across. Of course the difference is that in legal courts an expert is taken in to give information about evidence they deem to damning and then they bring in a second expert to verify independently of the other expert that this is what the evidence seems to point to and on the defendants side they bring in an expert to dispute the evidence. It may be one or the other. That being said however, these experts are in no way trying to convince other experts of their errors, they are in fact trying to convince the judge or the jury. In peer-review, you are supposed to provide evidence, interpretation of that evidence and a conclusion based on a follow of examination of the evidence through methodology to convince your peers who will rip it apart piece by piece in an attempt to falsify or find any errors. There is a huge difference in method and presentation of evidence and the crowd in which they convince between the legal system and academicians.

Another issue with this is that having a fringe academic and those who agree with him does not make him credible. What makes a case by a fringe academic credible is the evidence, method and conclusions they come and how many have been convinced by his case.

Basically, a bad DVD to buy if you are a skeptic, a good documentary if you are an apologist and wish to use bias to interpret evidence and would get a feel for the various strawman arguments to use in a debate to convince the gullible of your case.",1339372800,2,2877,4.691089108910891
8230275,1,B000XYIJI8,"Yet another piece of Christian apologetics, this time in a DVD rather than a book.
I suppose this DVD will impress those whose minds are already made up; certainly it reinforces their
beliefs - which is after all the purpose of apologetics. No real critical scholarship here, just a rehashing of stuff we were all taught in Sunday School.  Nothing more than "" I want to believe it's true, so therefore it must be true"" and so around and around the self-serving, circular arguments we go...",1298246400,2,489,4.686046511627907
8230276,5,B000XYIJI8,"I recently viewed The Apologetics Group's production, ""The Real Jesus,"" an informative DVD response to the Peter Jennings special report in 2000 on ""The Search for Jesus."" This nearly two-and-a-half hour DVD is packed with answers to the current attacks on the historical Jesus; including 1) the reliability of the New Testament, 2) the evidence for the resurrection of Jesus, 3) Jesus' claims of Deity, 4) the case against Christian borrowing of pagan myths, and 5) the skepticism from within the Church. ""The Real Jesus"" producers also demonstrate a thorough knowledge of the history of the arguments against Christianity, specifically with regard to how individual arguments began, who began the arguments, and how these arguments developed over time. Another helpful aspect of the DVD is the charts utilized to visually aide in comprehending the wealth of information presented. One of the charts is a representation of the continuous claim for the authority of the New Testament from the time of its authorship to Eusebius in the fourth century. This is a powerful reminder of the amount of writings available to us for historical investigation from just the first few centuries, let alone the rest of history! And there is still much more to this DVD.

The Apologetics Group has put together a great resource at an accessible level. The explanations are thorough, yet easy to follow, as the presenters tackle seven myths concerning Christianity. I definitely recommend ""The Real Jesus"" for those seeking to answer modern skepticism about the person of Jesus Christ.",1216857600,5,1571,5.209486166007905
8230277,5,B000XYIJI8,"Who is the Real Jesus?

Ever since the dawn of modern rationalism, skeptics have sought to use textual criticism, archeology and historical reconstructions to uncover the ""historical Jesus"" -- a wise teacher who said many wonderful things, but fulfilled no prophecies, performed no miracles and certainly did not rise from the dead in triumph over sin.

Over the past 100 years, however, startling discoveries in biblical archeology and scholarship have all but vanquished the faulty assumptions of these doubting modernists. Regrettably, these discoveries have often been ignored by the skeptics as well as by the popular media. As a result, the liberal view still holds sway in universities and impacts the culture and even much of the church.

This presentation explodes the myths of these critics and the movies, books and television programs that have popularized their views.

Presented in ten parts -- perfect for individual, family and classroom study -- viewers will be challenged to go deeper in their knowledge of Christ in order to be able to defend their faith and present the truth to a skeptical modern world - that the Jesus of the Gospels is the Jesus of history -- ""the same yesterday, today and forever"" (Hebrews 13:8). He is the real Jesus.

Speakers include: George Grant, Ted Baehr, Stephen Mansfield, Raymond Ortlund, Phil Kayser, David Lutzweiler, Jay Grimstead, J.P. Holding, and Eric Holmberg.",1206489600,3,1419,5.206140350877193
8230278,5,B000XYIJI8,"This video is indicative of The Apologetics Group continued commitment to high quality, thought-provoking, and most importantly, Christ-centered productions.",1202342400,,157,7.315789473684211
8230279,5,B000XYIJI8,"""The Real Jesus"" is a perfect title for this provocative DVD. It is a well-researched response to the superficial reporting and shoddy scholarship offered by Peter Jennings and ABC News concerning modern revisionist theories related to the historical veracity of Christian claims about Jesus Christ.

This expose is thoroughly historical, thoroughly  Biblical and carefully documented. It is particularly appropriate for honest skeptics who doubt the basic truths of Christianity. Open-minded doubters will find it to be distinctly challenging, but in a non-polemical and non-insulting way. If someone is truly looking for answers about who Jesus Christ really was, what he really did and what he really taught, then this is the perfect place to start.  I would challenge every genuine skeptic to test the strength of their skepticism against the compelling scholarly evidences contained in this DVD.

Of course, ""The Real Jesus"" is also a perfect tool for Christian believers who would like to know more about the solid historical evidence that supports their faith.  They will also want to have a copy in order to share it with their honestly skeptical friends who might be willing to watch it but are not motivated enough to purchase it for themselves.",1201046400,7,1255,5.255
8230280,5,B000XYIJI8,"My childhood faith was almost shipwrecked in college.  Half the professors I had made me feel like an idiot for believing the Bible was factual, trustworthy and the true Word of God.  It took several years, some self-inflicted hard-knocks,the prayers of my parents and the good grace of God to undo what my college years inflicted on me.  (And to think that my parents paid for the abuse!)  Anyway, I digress.  I saw this video when it first aired on Coral Ridge years ago and it really helped iron out the kinks in my brain.  I'm greatful that it has now been released on DVD - and will use my copy to help other lambs who so-called ""higher education"" may try to take to the slaughter.",1194739200,8,686,4.404761904761905
8230281,5,B000XYIJI8,"The Bible: Fable, Fraud or Fact? is for sure one of the best documentary/apologetic on the subject of the Bible's validity.  Included are scholars such as Gleason Archer, R.C. Sproul, James Boice, Ravi Zacharias, Josh McDowell, Gary Habermas et al; if one views this video with all the evidence revealed therein, and then still don't believe the Bible is true and trust worthy--one quote quickly comes to mind--""there are none so blind then those who refuse to see.""  Skeptic's and atheist's have no ground to stand on with the concrete validation this resource provides.  In fact, the Bible is the most scrutinized book from antiquity to date, and continues to stand the test of time.  As Dr. Kennedy has stated, many skeptics and atheist's have hammered away at the Bible and their tools all lay shattered on the side of God's Anvil--The Bible.  The Bible is the Indestructible Book!  So don't even hesitate to get a copy of this DVD ASAP!
