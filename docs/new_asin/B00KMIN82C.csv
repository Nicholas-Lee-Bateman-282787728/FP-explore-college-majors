6433729,4,B00KMIN82C,"With Two Rode Together, John Ford revisited the same true story that inspired The Searchers, and with many of the same supporting cast - Harry Carey Jr., Ken Curtis, John Qualen by yimminey and Henry Brandon, who played Scar in the earlier film and this time gets to play the Comanche chief he was based on, Quanah Parker. It even boasts the same screenwriter, Frank Nugent, but if anything it's a far bleaker film that offers little hope and takes a dim view of almost every character in the film. Perhaps that's one of the reasons it has such a low reputation in the Ford canon, spurred on by Ford's assessment that the film was ""the worst piece of crap I've done in twenty years"" (he made the film during one of his frequent deep depressions, allegedly purely for the money), but along with The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance it's one of his best late films.

The plot certainly has similarities to Ethan Edwards' quest, though this takes place over a period of weeks rather than years. James Stewart's small town sheriff is reluctantly shanghaied by John McIntire's cavalry officer into trading with Quanah Parker for any white captives he may still have after their distraught families turn up en masse demanding the army take action, with Richard Widmark's old army friend ordered to desert and accompany him to make sure he goes through with it. Stewart may be given an introduction deliberately reminiscent of Henry Fonda in My Darling Clementine, but it soon becomes clear that behind the bonhomie there's a very dark individual. But rather than racism, he's driven by avarice: the kind of lawman who buys votes with free beer and never saw anything he didn't want a 10% cut of, he's the kind of deliverer who's all too eager to squeeze every dollar out of the distraught fathers and agree to pass off the first white seventeen year old he can find as one long lost son. He's a mean drunk with a particularly venal temper that makes it brutally clear what the families can expect if he finds the hostages - that they'll be no better than animals who'll happily rape their own sisters and then sell them ""for a good knife or a bad rifle"" - and what's worse, the shockingly pitiless finale shows he's right. Some are too ashamed to return or even let their families know they're alive, others can't remember a life before they were taken and fight tooth and claw to stay behind even though to their own chief they're worth less than a few rifles.

As Julie Kirgo points out in her excellent liner notes in the Blu-ray, it's not just the hostages who have suffered, the film detailing the way their families have changed for the worst, some driven mad, others gone bad while Shirley Jones' character is so guilt stricken about not protecting her younger brother that she dresses like a boy as if to fill his place. Worse, the very people so desperate to retrieve their lost children turn on them when they see what the intervening years living as Comanches has made of them - the fate of one of them is particularly brutal when the Ford stock company turn into something more at home in Ox-Bow. Nor are they any more sympathetic to one who tries to make the readjustment, either shunning Linda Cristal's 'squaw' or pruriently asking for details of just what she did with her Comanche husband. While there's something approaching redemption in the ending, it's a begrudgingly reluctant enough kind to have almost come from an Anthony Mann film, the closest thing to a happy ending being trying to run away further than the lascivious stories have travelled.

Stewart's on good form and so is Widmark, who's game enough to just about pull off his romantic subplot despite being obviously far too old for his character. Ford's direction is unfussy but it's still a good looking film even though he's a long way from his Monument Valley stamping grounds courtesy of Charles Lawton's strong cinematography that's well represented on Twilight Time's beautifully remastered region-free Blu-ray. George Duning's excellent albeit largely monothematic score also gets its own isolated track on the disc (aside from the aforementioned booklet, the only other extra is the original trailer, which begins, like so many Western trailers of its day, with a crack at TV Westerns).",1403136000,14,4268,4.764864864864865

8660028,5,B00KMIN82C,"John Ford is a most difficult filmmaker to approach. He is controversial in many quarters for what is perceived as his conservative and racist glorification of the Conquest of the West, pitting the Native Americans ,portrayed as ruthless savages in need of annihilation, against cowboys and the Army as, romanticized as the embodiment of courage and the bringers of civilization. The truth does not lie somewhere in between, but all over the place.
The fact is Ford made some racist pictures, but I guess not more than many of his contemporaries. But he also made some more complex, intelligent films dealing with the same issues, such as the woefully underrated Two Rode Together.
Inexplicably, Ford himself called Two Rode Together one of the worst picture he had ever made, which probably accounts for the critical neglect of this movie for decades. I only became aware of it a couple of years ago, when the awesome Twilight Time put out a limited blu ray edition of this classic movie, followed by a release in the UK by the prestigious Eureka Masters of Cinema series.
The story pairs James Stewart and Richard Widmark on a mission to retrieve whites captured by the Comanche years ago. Stewart is an amiably corrupt sheriff of a ramshackle town, where he takes 10 percent of everything in exchange for his services, including 10 percent of the local brothel and 10 percent of the local madam. Richard Widmark is Stewart's opposite, an honorable Army First Lieutenant who works for very little money but whose ideals are in the right place.

John Mc Intire plays Major Frazer, Widmark's chief, who needs to enlist Stewart on a mission to retrieve the captives, as the Army can not be officially involved as this would violate a recently signed peace treaty with the Comanches. Major Frazer is not above exerting some extra legal pressure himself, and he cajoles Stewart into accepting, who only does so if the family of the captives agree to pay him money for each captive he brings. Major Frazer also finds an extra official way to force Widmark to go with Stewart, to embark in the perilous mission.

As you can see, this is not your typical John Ford, starting with Stewart's character, who is not a heroic figure in any way. The movie starts with Stewart sleeping on the porch of the brothel (calling out to the similar Henry Fonda way in My Darling Clementine), and then we are surprised to find out that this cad is the sheriff. This is the darker Stewart that we saw in Hitchcok and Anthony Mann, but it's more of a comedy performance, as is the movie at first. Stewart's character is balanced by the always dashing and sexy Widmark, who is a more of a straight arrow, and who constantly teases and makes fun of Stewart's corrupt ways.

The comedy tone is key for the success of Two Rode Together. The film begins as a comedy, but not a broad comedy. Atypically for Ford everybody is somewhat restrained, and there are not carnivalesque performances, not even Andy Devine. The comedy is cynical but without being despairing. Two Rode Together is masterful in the sense that it examines the tensions and the conflicts which The Searchers only thread lightly upon. Stewart warns the settlers about bringing back their loved ones after being with the Indians for so many years. Do they really want them back? Whereas some people might see this as racist, it is really daring to be more realistic and more brutal, something which Ford is not known for.

As Stewart and Widmark go deeper into Indian territory, the film only becomes more surprising and more unpredictable. The slight comedy tone gives way to a more oriented and dramatic action movie, but with the comic cynical realistic tone established at first the transition is not jarring (which sometimes hurt some Ford films). All the cast is brilliantly directed, with top notch performances from everybody, and Ford making great use of Shirley Jones, Linda Cristal and Jeannette Nolan and Annelle Hayes.

As said the movie goes into uncharted, eventually tragic territory and it does not give the audience what it wants. Maybe that accounts for its unpopularity, even with critics, as this is a more thoughtful Ford. The film is not that action oriented but it's always very suspenseful. Based on some of his films, I think Fonda is a much smarter man than he lets through in some of his films. For instance, I don't understand anybody calling Fort Apache racist, when the movie makes very clear that Henry Fonda's maniacal general who is responsible for the breakdown in relationships with the Indians. However, that movie was not successful at the box office and Ford was accused of being too dark and anti-American, at the time of the Communist witch hunts, so it's not surprising that he swung back and came back with the inferior She Wore a Yellow Ribbon.

I still think The Searchers is a conflicted film, where Ford has a great subject, which he does not explore in depth. Maybe he felt that way and then came back to do it with Two Rode Together, in which he enlisted his Searchers writer Frank Nugent. This time he succeeded greatly. A superior movie and a real elegy, much more than the simplistic and cartoonish The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.

8660034,4,B00KMIN82C,"Two Rode Together (1961) is a western film directed by John Ford. The movie was based upon the novel Comanche Captives by Will Cook.

The major theme of ""Two Rode Together"" is far too often overlooked because of the wonderful chemistry between its two great stars: the ""Two"" of the film's title. Some have called the film a romantic comedy western, but it is much deeper in that it deals with the psychological trauma that loss can have on those who refuse to deal with it in a healthy way and then move on.

Although the two main characters (James Stewarts Guthrie McCabe and Richard Widmarks Lieutenant Jim Gary) gain something in the end, the entire story is moved by a single theme: loss. Coping with loss is something that all humans have to deal with at one time or another. Psychologists will tell you that loss, death, abandonment, deep disappointments and the pain they inflict on the human soul can leave profound scars that for some, may never heal. Different people have different psychological coping mechanisms that help them to take positive and constructive steps to overcome loss and move on. If not, the loss will cause them dwell upon negative feelings of anger towards those they feel are responsible, or it can end with unresolved guilt if they feel they are to blame. If loss is not dealt with quickly, negative emotions can become terribly destructive.

All of the psychological coping mechanisms are expressed by one or more of characters in Two Rode Together. It begins in a sleepy southwestern town kept in line by a quiet, but formidable Marshall, Guthrie McCabe. His reputation is established in the story by his ability to terrify and run out of town a couple of gun-toting gamblers at just at the mention of his name. McCabe is living a contented life marshalling the town of Tascosa, Texas and by raking in 10% of all the profits of all the businesses for his services. His business arrangement with the town includes a stake in the saloon of the towns attractive but no-nonsense madam Belle Aragon (played by Annelle Hayes) who keeps a lethal stiletto secured in her garter to keep customers in line. McCabes relationship with Belle is revealed to be much more than strictly business.
All of this is upset with the arrival of a troop of soldiers from a fort about a days ride from the town. Led by Lt. Gary, the troop is sent to fetch McCabe for a mysterious mission to the fort. To Lt. Garys surprise, McCabe hardly puts up a fight and willingly goes along although he has no clue what the mission is about. Later McCabe confides in his good friend, Lt. Gary that he went with him to get away from Belle who was pressuring him to marry him by offering him a 50/50 stake in all her profits. McCabes tepid response to her proposal had riled Belle and he wanted to get away and let things cool down between them.

Once McCabe and Lt. Gary reach the fort, the reason for McCabes mission is revealed. At first McCabe is surprised at the adoring reaction to his arrival from the people of the wagon train camped around the fort, but when the forts commander, Major Fraser (John McIntire) tells him the wagon train is filled with the relatives of whites that had been taken captives by Comanche raiders, and that they believed McCabe had come to free them, McCabe wanted nothing to do with any of it. Maj. Fraser insisted that McCabe was the only man for the job because he had dealings in the past with their Chief, Quanah Parker (Henry Brandon) and could deal with him again, now that another treaty had been signed. It takes all the pressure that Fraser and Gary can apply on McCabe (plus a promise that they would not interfere if he could raise some good ransom money from the families of the missing) to convince McCabe to go on the adventure. Maj. Fraser has no respect for McCabe and no trust in him so he orders Lt. Gary to desert and accompany McCabe on the mission to Quanah Parkers camp inside of Indian Territory.

This is where the tragic stories of loss collide with the hard reality that only McCabe knows. McCabe knows that none of the tearful accounts of how loved ones were suddenly snatched away but never forgotten could have a happy ending. Attached to each story is the refusal to let go of the lost and the belief that McCabe would be their savior to deliver their lost ones from bondage to the Indians. The classic signs of disbelief and denial, disorganization and dependence, intellectualism and rationalization, anger, unresolved guilt, fear, anxiety, and depression are seen on the faces and heard in the pleas of each person that parades before McCabe. First there is Mrs. Mary McCandless (Jeanette Nolan) who lost her little boy Toby. Unable to cope with the loss, she descended deep into denial and disbelief that her son was gone forever; this has driven her totally mad and out of touch with reality. Her husband now cares for her in a co-dependence that gives him a reason to carry on through his pain. It is a poor choice for Mr. McCandless in that only keeps him locked into his wifes mental prison.

Next is the Reverend Henry Clegg (Ford Rainey) who is consumed by anger. He seems to hate the Comanche more for wounding his pride and depriving him of something that was his, than by actual grief over the loss of his wife. Ole Knudsen (John Qualen) carries with him the mental picture of his little blond-haired, blue-eyed Freda who was now 16 years old. Ole refuses to accept that the little girl he once knew and loved is gone forever and if she is still alive will most probably have a Comanche husband and half-breed children. Mr. Harry J. Wringle (Willis Bouchey) represents the intellectualization and cold calculation of someone who remains emotionally detached to loss. It is the son of his wifes first marriage that was lost and so he feels only like an observer of his wifes loss. His only concern is to end this chase for his wifes boy and return to his business as soon as possible  even if it means lying to his wife and paying  McCabe to pass off any boy he can find as his step-son. Wringle is an individual who wants to keep control over his life and not be caught in a hopeless search for a two-year old boy that had been missing for 15 years. Lt. Gary is romantically involved with a young woman who lost her brother 12 years before. Marty Purcell (Shirley Jones) has spent her adolescence trying to make up to her father, Judge Edward Purcell (Paul Birch) the loss of his curly-headed 5 year old son. Her guilt is so deep that she tries to be the son her father lost by playing the Tom boy  a role she has outgrown now that she has bloomed into full womanhood with a serious suitor in Lt. Gary. Marty feels personally responsible for not saving her little brother Steve and is haunted by his memory. She keeps a music box that belonged to him - not only to keep his memory alive, but also to feed her guilt every time she opens it.

The last person we meet who has met tragic loss is actually discovered in the Indian camp of Quanah Parker. Elena de la Madriaga (Linda Cristal) was captured after watching the Comanches murder her father and fianc on the way to her wedding. Now the woman of the hotheaded Stone Calf (Woody Strode) Elena was resigned herself to her fate.

Only three captives from the families waiting back at the fort are found in the camp. Most have died or were traded and sold in Mexico. Rev. Cleggs wife is found but she refuses to go back, knowing that her old life can never be restored and as far as she is concerned she died years ago. The Knudsen girl is found to be in the camp; and as McCabe predicted, she is now the wife of a brave and has a young child. She is terrified of leaving the only life she now knows and runs back to the arms of her new family with the Comanche. The last captive they came looking for is the teenaged, Running Wolf (David Kent). He has so completely forgotten his past that he has to be tied up and delivered to McCabe after being traded by Parker for a handful of rifles. Almost as an afterthought, McCabe trades for Stone Calfs woman whom he has yet to see, but only knows she is white. Parker is glad to trade her as a way of shaming Stone Calf, his major rival for control of the tribe. Stone Calf is part of the sect of fanatics the Buffalo Shields that believe they can turn back the tide of whites flooding Indian lands and return the hunting grounds to the tribes. All the captives have overcome their suffering and loneliness to one degree or another by letting go of their past lives and embracing their new reality (which is a total contrast to the lack of emotional relief and recovery of their families waiting for them back at the fort).
The teenaged boy, Running Wolf refuses to accept that he is white and shows nothing but hate for whites. In order to cope with the loss of his previous life, his mind has completely wiped out all memories of the past and he has completely emerged himself into his new Comanche identity. Elena, Stone Calfs woman is conflicted. She wants to seize the opportunity to be free, but finds it difficult to believe she can truly break free of her captivity. McCabe gives her the choice to follow him to freedom or go back to Stone Calf; she chooses freedom.

In a dramatic moment, McCabe and Gary have a parting of the ways. McCabe knows that Stone Calf will follow and wants to face him. Gary wants to keep moving and hopefully escape without a confrontation. Gary takes Running Wolf back with him believing McCabe will be killed by Stone Calf. Once safely back at the fort, Gary has to put Running Wolf into a jail cell where he is put on public display like a caged animal. Running Wolf screams he is Comanche and curses all the whites who pass by his cell. He empties a bucket of water on Wringle and curses at him in Comache. Wringle turns away in disgust, determined to break his agreement with McCabe and refuses the boy, saying he would not take him for free.

In a meeting presided over by Maj. Fraser, no one wants to claim the boy. At first a move is made to free the boy, but a hysterical Mrs. McCandless insists that Running Wolf is her little Toby returned to her and begs them not to send him away. Mr. McCandless accepts the boy even though he knows Running Wolf is not their son. In an effort to help his wife, he is willing to accept a lie.

In the meantime, Stone Calf catches up with McCabe and Elena as Elena shares her story with McCabe in front of a campfire. Stone Calf appears out of the darkness and is immediately shot dead by McCabe. At first Elena starts to perform a death ritual over Stone Calf, but McCabe stops her chanting and programmed mourning. She runs back into McCabes arms.

Lt. Gary and the others are shocked to see McCabe and Elena show up at the fort just as the McCandless are leading Running Wolf away to their wagon. Once hailed a Moses come to deliver their loved ones, McCabe is now a social outcast. He has forced them all to face the harsh reality that their losses will never be recovered. The shock of seeing Running Wolf has made them all realize they are chasing after loved ones that were lost a long time ago.

The final scenes of the film are about breaking with the past. Running Wolf seizes his first opportunity and murders Mrs. McCandless. All the others are unable to accept Elena. She represents to them their lost hopes. Their prejudice and hate are evident at an officers dance that McCabe has dressed her up and taken her to in a first step for her to break with her experiences with the Comanche. McCabe is trying to force Elena to come to terms with who she is and what she has been through. He urges her not to let her past be tattooed across her forehead. The wives and sweethearts at the officers dance are far less gracious and are not willing to let her forget her past. The make her the object of their gossip. Secretly, they wish she had killed herself and spared her and them the embarrassment of having to confront the unpleasant thoughts of what life must be like for captives of the Comanche. McCabe stops Elena from fleeing the dance and confronts with the truth all those who rejected her. He tells them that her religion forbade her from taking her own life and pronounces that sometimes it is a lot harder to live in the present than to die. Then he informs them that Elena said she wanted to go back to the Comanche because she was treated better by them they she was by the civilized whites at the fort. McCabe and Elena leave the dance followed by Lt. Gary and Marty.

By now Marty has broken with her past by accepting Lt. Garys proposal of marriage at the dance where she came all dressed up in completely feminine attire. She is no longer allowing herself to be a prisoner of her guilt. Lt. Gary escorts her back to her wagon where he sees the music box that belonged to her brother. He starts to play it and Marty tells him that it was her brothers and he refused to go to sleep at night without listening to it. Just at that moment a mob comes storming through the wagon camp with a rope around the neck of Running Wolf. They have tried and convicted him for the murder of Mrs. McCandless and were on their way to lynch him. Gary attempts to stop them and they knock him down and out. In the process Running Wolf knocks over Marty's music box and it starts to play. Running Wolf recognizes the melody and grabs the box screaming out in English, mine, mine but it is knocked out of his hands and he is dragged away by the crowd. Marty realizes that Running Wolf is in fact her long lost brother Steve, but once again, she cannot save him. The mob lynches him and her father who does not know that Running Wolf is his son is part of the mob. But this time, rather than submersing herself in guilt, she understands that nothing could have been done to bring back the brother she remembered; that the attempt to bring him back only ended in death and destruction. She accepts that her future is with Lt. Gary and runs to him for consolation.

Days pass and McCabe returns to Tascosa with Elena now transformed into a lady and dressed in new clothes ready to return to civilized life. McCabe, Gary and a small troop arrive back in town in front of Madam Aragons saloon where the story began. McCabe finds out that he has been replaced by his goofy deputy Ward Corby (Chet Douglas). Ward is now Mrs. Aragons fianc and is not only wearing identical clothes to the ones McCabe was wearing in the opening scene, but is also wearing his Marshalls badge. Gary follows McCabe into the saloon to watch him confront Mrs. Aragon. A moment later, Elena enters the saloon looking for a cup of coffee. Mrs. Aragon, who has heard about Elena, viciously abuses her as Mrs. Stone Calf and offers her a job as a prostitute in her saloon. Elena flees the saloon. McCabe threatens to beat Mrs. Aragon, but she draws out her stiletto and threatens to kill McCabe.

At that moment, McCabe has a revelation. All he had before he left on the mission with Lt. Gary was gone. But it was not anything that was worth fighting for to get back. It was all corrupt and degraded. It was obvious that he and Elena had fallen in love, and a future with her was worth going after, so he decides to leave everything behind in Tascosa and to go to California with Elena who is overjoyed when she realizes that McCabe is now riding shotgun on the stage in which she was leaving town. Madam Aragon and Lt. Gary watch as the horses bolt forward and carry McCabe and Elena to a new life waiting for them over the horizon.",1469923200,2,15557,4.427523576667831
