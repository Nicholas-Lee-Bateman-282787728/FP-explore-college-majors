7385130,4,B014662LPA,i enjoy it and if seen high school dxd not as funny but still good watch,1453334400,,72,3.5625
7385131,3,B014662LPA,"A good and enternaining story,but with too many cliffhangers and unanswered questions. The characters are somewhat developed and contain some depth, but there is nothing ground breaking about it. It has some cool twists, some of which you can see coming a mile away if you look closely, others you can only infer and are not fully explained due to the short running time of the show. All in all, even with its short commings, it still an entertaining show, just that it has a lot of wholes left open that could have added a lot to the experience.",1449360000,3,546,4.525252525252525

7385135,5,B014662LPA,"Thought this was a really good series. For those wondering yes there is fan service as others have noted. The story line was good to the point it kept me watching. I do wish the series was longer but for the price it was well worth the purchase. I am not going to summarize the story as others have already done this. If your a fan of anime I would recommend this series.
There wasn't much in the way of extras but that was expected with save edition.",1514937600,,451,4.136363636363637
7385136,5,B014662LPA,Loved it. It was interesting from the very beginning and was just all around awesome. I would like to know when the rest of it is coming out though. So when?,1514505600,,157,4.096774193548387

7385138,5,B014662LPA,"My nephew requested a long list of  anime' items for Christmas, including this series. He is a huge anime' fan, so he was very happy with this DVD set. He tells me it's very good. I'm glad he was happy with my choice of gifts.",1498089600,,226,4.022222222222222

7385140,4,B014662LPA,"This is a pretty short series. Has 12 episode in total which one reason I gave it a 4. The beginning was pretty good but to me the story was cut up way to much to make sense of what's truly going on. It's not that bad of a show but it could be better if we had more in debt with our main characters. Their is very mild fan services but the story line is what kinda kills the humor to anime. Great music, casting voice was great, story line to short fells all crunched up in just 12 episodes is the draw back. Not in debt with our main characters to get a good feeling on what's the true meaning and purpose. Still a good show just to pass time imo",1491350400,,647,3.8721804511278197

7385143,5,B014662LPA,"- Synopsis: An anime showcasing the adventures of students learning to tame dragons. Our main character is the center of attention as he is looked down upon for being the only one who doesn't have his own dragon. Until one day, all that changes. His own dragon mysteriously appears, but it isn't what he expected: his dragon takes the appearance of a cute dragon girl. Not only that, she has moxy and claims that she is the master and he is the servant. Join in on the daily lives of these unique academy students in a world filled with dragons.
===========================================================================================================

- Comments: Pretty cool anime with a likable main character. Though he is like many other anime characters that by default are nice/have a soft spot for the ladies. The fan-service is quite heavy, as well. Especially a few...stimulating scenes. Keep this in mind if fan-service isn't for you.

- Features: English and Japanese audio with English subtitles. Contains 12 episodes on 2 Blu-rays and 12 on 2 DVDs with a run-time of about 5 hours. The cover features changeable cards so you can change the girl shown on the cover, as well as the positioning. Rated TV-MA for sexual content and nudity. Some of the scenes are borderline hentai.

- Conclusion: Some of the character interactions can be amusing, especially when the main character is often teased by the ladies. Typically, nice guys in animes tend to be a target for teasing due to their innocence and indecisiveness. It just seems to make them prone to this, but it adds some entertainment factor. It would be unfair to expect high school students in an anime to be extremely calm or otherwise nonchalant. That's part of what being young is about: enjoying their youth.

7385144,1,B014662LPA,poorly done perverted I think the manga artist and the writer should be locked up behind bars for the rest of their lives. the anime is based off of the manga which was done in poor taste.,1481241600,,188,4.108108108108108
7385145,4,B014662LPA,Serious and funny! this awesome show is definatly worth your time!,1479168000,,66,5.090909090909091
7385146,3,B014662LPA,"Had to drop this a star due to one all-too-common feature of this type of show. With two notable
exceptions, all the female characters are of the ""big, bigger, or biggest"" variety, meaning that at
the upper end, their bras aren't measured with letters, but cubic yard capacity, like blimps. Ironically
though, most of the series' copious nudity is of the two exceptions, which begs the question, why
include all those deformities, if you don't plan on pandering to the drooling teenage boys who buy
the shows for that reason?
Beyond that pet peeve, the show is fairly entertaining, if in no way compelling. It strays from the usual
path of ""harem"" shows in that only a few of the girls show any interest in the earnest but bland hero. Of
those that do, one is a princess forbidden to him, and another is the humanoid dragon-girl Eko (and don't
ask the hows and whys of that, because it's never explained). The story plods along to its inevitable ""to be
continued"" conclusion...if that's the right word.
On the plus side, the art work is exquisite, the colors breathtaking. The detail in the backgrounds almost
reaches overkill. The English dub is just okay, with one or two familiar voices. At the price I paid, I can't
say I got my money's worth, so I have to agree with the reviewer who recommended waiting for a ""SAVE""
edition.",1475366400,6,1330,4.639830508474576
7385147,4,B014662LPA,"My son loved the anime though he wasn't thrilled with the slight nudity, he adores the dragons and even the plot that people can be partnered with dragons yet the plot leaves a lot to question.",1472256000,,193,4.388888888888889
7385148,3,B014662LPA,"On fan service scale of 1-10 1 being like Spirited Away and 10 being Queens Blade Dragonar Academy is a solid 7.  Not so much because of quantity of fan service, but because of the type.  Most of the fan service is of a very young girl, so be warned.  Decent story and animation.  Boy is special.  Boy gets young girl to partner with him and she is mysterious.  Etc, etc.  Worth the money and the watch if you wait until a S.A.V.E. version is released.  Otherwise I would avoid.",1470873600,5,478,4.233333333333333
7385149,4,B014662LPA,"I am a fan of the manga, so I was keen to see the characters brought to life.  This did not disappoint.  It is a bit difficult when you know most of what the plot is going to bring, but I enjoyed it anyway.  Watching Ash and Sylvia grow was fun.  I never did get the reason Ash was called the biggest delinquent in the school: he stays a well-mannered boy throughout, and I wound up putting it down to his fellow students' worry at his unique ability to ride any dragon (except Gawain).  I would recommend this to anyone.",1470009600,,521,4.17
