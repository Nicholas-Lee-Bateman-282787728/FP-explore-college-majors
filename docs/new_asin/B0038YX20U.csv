4092377,4,B0038YX20U,"Starting your own business is risky, painful and full of stumbles. And that's what&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/How-To-Make-It-In-America/dp/B0038YX20U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">How To Make It In America</a>&nbsp;is all about -- a clever little dramedy about three different businesses that are trying to get off the ground, and the highs and lows they encounter along the way. It's a little quirky, gritty, and riddled with romantic problems.

Mild-mannered Ben Epstein (Bryan Greenberg) and his street-smart buddy Cam Calderon (Victor Rasuk) decide to start a denim clothing line called Crisp, but run into a bunch of problems -- they have little money, one investor, no business plan and a disastrous sample. Even as their dreams seem to crash and burn, they discover a new business road has just opened up -- if they can keep their hands on the merchandise.

In the meantime, Ben's ex-girlfriend Rachel (Lake Bell) has a wealthy new boyfriend named Darren, which might be good for her designing agency -- but bad for her personal life. And Cam's cousin Rene (Luis Guzm&aacute;n), who has just gotten out of prison, is going legit with an energy drink called Rasta Monsta -- which is encountering the same sorts of problems as Crisp.

""How To Make It In America"" is all about pursuing the American Dream in the 21st century: you need opportunity, street smarts, connections, and lots of hard work. It's not quite as brilliant as some of HBO's other shows, but it does have an endearing, gritty earnestness -- and it reminds you that for every successful business that takes off, there are dozens of failed ones.

Along the way, there are lots of dimly-lit New York nightclubs, shady street venders and warehouses piled high with vintage T-shirts. The writing is fun and often clever (""Edie, do you know where I can find some X?"" ""Top drawer on the left""), and the writers balance out drama and low-key comedy with an expert hand.

The one downside: it feels a bit unfocused at times, with side-plots about a crazy skateboarder and Ben's new girlfriend. They don't really add anything to the main plot.

Greenberg and Rasuk are a strong pair of Odd-Coupley leads: Ben is a pleasant, mild-mannered young man who's been disappointed over and over, and Cam is a fiercely ambitious, optimistic young man who pounces on every chance for success.

Bell does a pretty good job as Rachel, but she honestly doesn't get to do very much for the first five episodes or so -- but her about-faces in the last few are great. Guzman is compelling as an ex-con valiantly trying to run a legit business, and Shannyn Sossamon is wildly underused as quirky trust-fund art-dealer Gingy Wu.

""How to Make It In America"" is a gritty, sleek little show that might blossom into something more. All it needs is a little more oomph and a bit of the fat trimmed off.",1286755200,15,2887,5.0

However season two sucked. It's as if they fired all the season one writers and completely retooled it. Too bad. Made it unwatchable for me. But season one is so well worth a look.",1450051200,,367,4.318840579710145

Has some comedy, drama, love triangles, dishonesty, betrayal, and much more.  Such a shame this got cancelled.  Enjoyed this show a lot, actually.  I've heard some people argue that it isn't the strongest writing.  Honestly, that doesn't matter. The show is very enjoyable and you should watch it.  Sad it didn't get renewed.  Naturally, a lot of questions and plot points will remain unanswered, due to the early cancellation.

The biggest travesty of the cancellation, in my opinion, is that we no longer get to see the character Rene develop.  Luis Guzmn absolutely nailed this role.  Best performance I have seen him in.",1446940800,,737,4.816

But this was the most ridiculous overkill of trendy-everything, un-hipster-and-therefore-super-hipster, glorified (though trying not to be) and commodified display of young, urban life I've ever seen. It's like a showcase of new ""cool"" stereotypes in the most one-dimensional characters to hit the airwaves. Montage overkill, anyone? (Seriously! I appreciate artistic style, but it was so overdone that it was distracting!) The target audience is so obvious, yet unlike a show like ""Girls"" (which also depicts a particular way of life in a particular place among a particular groups), it can't possibly ""reach"" anyone but those who can identify EXACTLY with these paperdoll characters. Skating, NY life, hip-hop, the 'starving artist' crap--it's unbelievable how mainstream this stuff is now.

4092854,5,B0038YX20U,"HBO made a mistake when it didn't sign on for season 3.  I love this show.  Honestly, the only reason I started watching is because I'm a big Victor Rasuk fan (he's very under rated).  And once I started watching I just could not stop.  The first season really draws you in.  As the viewer, I really wanted these guys to make it.  One guy being laid back and anxious and the other being an all-or-nothing type personality really balances the show.  These are the people you want to see win it.  They are young, ambitious, broke and using their skills and personality to push forward and BE SOMETHING.

I think this show appeals to my generation because it's filled with people who have ambition and don't know HOW to do anything with it.  On the flip side, we also have a lot of people trying to make it and scraping by.  Also, the characters in the show are at the age where it's make it or break it.  If this doesn't work, they'll have to sit behind a desk and hope they don't get fired from their 9 to 5 jobs.  This, mixed with personal stories, and the charming edge of the Lower East Side setting really made me love the show.  Wish there were more than two seasons.",1362700800,5,1171,4.263636363636364

I have seen each episode quite a few times already but it will be nice to see a whole bunch straight through instead of having to wait the usual week for the next episode.

As for my view of this show, it's amazing. It's a little gritty and sometimes you really do not know what is going to happen. As much as I enjoy the mulitple story lines the only one I could of done a little less with was with Lake Bell and Martha Plimpton. I'm not saying it should of not been included at all, just a little less of it. I do find Lake Bell sexy as hell. A naturally looking beautiful woman.

As for the plot lines, the writers have it right. Thank god it's on HBO because they can basically do what they want and make it sort of real. No language or content barriers to deal with make this show so much better. Luis Guzman nails his role as man just out of prison trying to make his way in a sort of, but not quite, honest way. As for they main characters, Ben & Cam, watching them struggle and everything not always coming out right keeps you wanting to see what will happen next.

The new season (2nd) is about to start. It's been a real long wait. Other shows that started at the same time are already going on their 3rd seasons why 'How to..' is only on it's second. I guess the actors had to be free from other roles and scripts and locations have to be obtained. Still, if season 2 is anywhere near the 1st season it should be great. I only wish HBO would release the seasons faster. I know they want people to subscribe to their On Demand or watch their channel for it but I love being able to watch them whenever I want on blu-ray.

So Amazon, please send me this ASAP. I'm dying here.",1317168000,,1805,4.090395480225989

It's a real good shown and Season 2 premieres October 2nd, a must see. Mark Wahlberg did a good job producing this it's great.",1317081600,,411,4.421052631578948
4092863,5,B0038YX20U,"I didn't even know this show existed until HBO re-ran the entire series a few months ago.

All I can say is 'Wow'. I was a big fan of 'The Sopranos' until it ended. But ""How to make it in america"" has gotten me hooked more than the Sopranos ever did.

The cool thing about this show - for me - is that I can relate to it. The desperate search for *some* way to make it big, the tumbles the characters take, the questionable paths they take...

I'm told this show comes from the director of ""Entourage"". However, Entourage never appealed much to me - for the simple reason that it is all about Hollywood. But I live in the real world.

You can see similarities shared between the two shows. They both follow a small group of young guys, as they try to make it big. In Entourage, they make it in Hollywood; in ""How to make it in America"", they make it in the gritty neighborhoods of NYC.

This show is a must-see if (i) you've struggled for any length of time trying to make it big, (ii) you live in the city. It's a must-see otherwise too, but the impact will be greatest if you fall in these two categories.

I've been looking everywhere for this show. ITunes has nothing, HBO has almost nothing, YouTube has little, HBO rarely replays the first (and only) season. Things should get better when the second season comes out.

Just watch. This show WILL be bigger than the Sopranos.",1309478400,11,1380,4.305019305019305
