Who in their right mind would call this an ""Enjoyable and Exciting"", ""major leap forward"", ""highly watchable and entertaining romp"", ""but still worth watching"". There is no amount of words I can use to properly convey the lack of enjoyable entertainment. So let me just point out that the pirates wear sweat pants and the leading lady Doc Martin boots complete with tread pattern. I believe the positive reviews are from family and friends with the aid of a large helping of pharmaceuticals. This is no B movie. I like B movies. This is a couple of cell phone cameras and a handy Goodwill near by for costumes.",1327881600,,646,4.626086956521739
4572864,4,B0055A5VAY,"There is plenty to admire and enjoy in Mark Atkins' Dragon Crusaders. It was shot on location in Wales and features incredibly beautiful background locales.  It has a cast of excellent Welch actors who are superb on their roles.  Yes, the movie is low budget but within that reality it accomplishes wonders. There are lots of dragons (including an amazing black dragon) and lots of gargoyles too.  The heroes, a band of outcast Knights Templars, are very believable and flawed but still heroic.  There is an amazing swordswoman who performs seemingly impossible acrobatic feats. The story is full of twists and turns and holds interest to the last.  I loved this movie!  See it and judge for yourself.",1326153600,3,701,4.898305084745763
4572865,2,B0055A5VAY,"Well there's a smidgeon of something for every appetite here except for those hoping the R - rating is actually justified.  This DVD contains no flesh-fest eye candy, and as serious as I know how to be, the FX are late 1960's genre.  ""Dragon Crusaders"" came out in 2011, runs 96 minutes, and if the single beheading event was edited out, this film could be PG in the USA as for the year 2011 by censorship standards I've seen elsewhere.  I'm fairly certain this was shot in Wales (the country not the fish), and it mixes just about any action / adventure / fantasy / Sci-Fi tidbit you can conjure up in a film that includes pirates / dragons / gargoyles / Templar Knights / female warrior (alone fights up to six seasoned sword-wielding pirates simultaneously - kills them all, and never breaks a sweat or gets short of breath)/ witches/ sorcerer/ and railroad box-car loads of hubris.  There's an ancient book of evil incantations kept pivotal throughout, horses, transformations, a sailing vessel moored just a few rows out from the shore, caverns, sky battles, and sizable explosions all thrown in, too.  Renaissance lifestyles, slave labor, very primitive conditions (except for the Templar Knights and the female warrior having modern broadswords, an archer having a magic quiver that never stays empty of arrows longer than five minutes or so) - but what we all expect to see on this type of setting is pitchfork impalement; but alas no, the producers and writers let us down on that last detail.  Did I mention there's no nudity?  How much violence you query?  I've had more trepidation bringing home my Jr High school report card.  The budget for this film was apparently slightly more than what was spent on the Blair Witch Project.  ""Dragon Crusaders"" stars Dylan Jones, Cecily Fay, Feth Greenwood, Shinead Byrne, Tony Sams, Simon Lloyd-Roberts, Charles Barrett, Christian Howard, Gary Crosbie, Mark Richard Hayes, Mike Lockley, William Huw, Kathy Francis, Iona Thonger, Steve McTigue, Carys Elen, Nia Ann, and a couple dozen or so others (I've named the big-name actors and actresses already).  Yes the movie is better than the one I made, but then again, that's because I haven't made any.  The DVD picture is clear, the DVD sound is pristine, and the costuming is actually pretty good (the peasants look like peasants; the pirates look like pirates; the Templar Knights look like Templar Knights; etc. etc.).  I'm feeling generous . . . . . two stars.  Although there is a gag reel in the special features, I didn't need it; I was gagging already.",1320624000,4,2560,4.841743119266055
4572866,4,B0055A5VAY,"Dragon Crusaders represents a major leap forward for home video company The Asylum. Although the film was shot on a low budget, with only a two week shoot, the result was a highly watchable and entertaining romp through a Wales forest complete with dragons, pirates, and gargoyles.

The film opens with pirates raiding a small peaceful village. Dragon Crusaders is a bit bloody, but in the fantasy violence way. Our small band of holy warriors are on a hill overlooking the small village and decide to help. Each of the men have a certain fighting skill, including an archer.

When they reach the village the dispatch the pirates with the help of Aerona portrayed with captivating ferocity by Cecily Fay. Although Fay is rather short, she wields her sword with precision and purpose. The director Mark Atkins mentioned that he put her in the film because he wanted people who already do the action, rather than hiring a series of stunt people. In addition to her sword prowess, and acting ability, Cecily is also a singer and sings some of the tunes used on the movie.

After they dispatch the pirates, the holy warriors sail in a small boat to the pirates' ship and board it. Below deck is a woman named Neem, she has put a curse on all who enter the boat, by turning them into gargoyles. Neem's character is played with wistful passion by Shinead Byrne. Shinead really fits the part of damsel in distress and she has a likable innocence to her. The meat of the plot begins with the quest on how to remove the curse.

The movie was shout mainly outside in Wales, on two Canon 5D still cams outfitted with special lenses. Mark Atkins said the cameras allow for extreme portability, much more so than a tradition digital video camera. In addition to the outside forest shots a real 13th century castle was used, for some interior and exterior shots.

As the movie progresses we see that the wizard that the group seeks to remove the curse has powerful dragons protecting him, along with a stoic warrior Calvain played deftly by Christian Howard. Another interesting aspect of the film is that Aerona seems to constantly be protecting the men with her voracious fighting skills. This was clever, and obvious that all of the actors fighting Cecily in the film were well choreographed. Cecily did the choreographing for her fight sequences, and her fight scenes are top notch, although some of the edits were rather quick.

This is a very good low budget film. All of the acting and action is entertaining to watch and there are no dull moments in Dragon Crusaders, yes it is campy to all the detractors, but that is the beauty of it. Although there is copious amounts of fighting, the dialogue is pertinent and never drags down the film. The actors all show good emotion, have clear speaking voices, and the character development, although basic, helps the flow of the Dragon Crusaders.",1318723200,8,2883,4.7103174603174605
4572867,4,B0055A5VAY,"Starring: Cecily Fay & Dylan Jones. Directed : Mark Atkins.

I interviewed Cecily Fay earlier on this blog

[...]

Without seeing her wonderful turn in this film, She can better any number of baddies with a sword or two and do some stunts,That well,Someone taller might not try.

The special effects,Actually thats kind of rude explaination of how we can see Gargoyles,Dragons and other assorted creatures.

The plot where the Gargoyles come from is very creative and once seen,Makes you anticipate.

Hate to go and on about Cecily Fay,Because Dylan Jones is very good as male lead and breaks all kinds of molds of heroes past.

This was mostly filmed in Wales and it looks great for on-location.",1318118400,2,696,4.8474576271186445
4572868,1,B0055A5VAY,"Filmed in 14 days with a crew and budget the size of a cantaloupe. IMDB gives it a 3/10 and Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic and Movieseer do not find it worth a rating. Incidentally, the ratio of males to females watching this flick was about 25 to 1 and strangely those very few females rated it above average whereas almost all the males rated it below average.

The actors are largely stunt substitutes, or first time actors and if any film experience it consisted of video shorts, TV series or nothing.  Is it too much to ask that the females not wear heavy red lipstick or hair extensions and the guys not have neatly trimmed/barbered hair? Oh, and teeth whitening in the middle ages? And, Old to Middle English from that period would be unintelligible today.

Really bad are scenes where a quiver of arrows is being shot at a high rate yet the number in the quiver never changes and when it finally is empty it suddenly is full in the next scene. Equally as bad and poorly executed were the Hong Kong Shaw Brothers style screams, tumbling, wire spins and kick boxing showing up in the middle ages. The props and costuming were very fake especially when you see a purple nylon draw string in a hoodie - yo' bro'.  The swords, bow and arrows looked like they were manufactured for a Target/Wal-Mart Halloween display. As far as the animated Gargoyles and dragons they were nothing we haven't seen for the past 20 years although I always wonder how dragons can produce a perfect 200 meter stream of flame without singeing their tongues. Also wonder how they can turn in the air without flapping their bat wings and not stall/plummet to Earth like a rock. Must be anti-gravity dragon physics.

So, is this worth seeing? Definitely, your incredulity will have you laughing the entire movie which I assure you was not the film crew's intention.",1317686400,4,1840,4.631901840490798
4572869,4,B0055A5VAY,Yes - low budget - but still worth watching for anyone that likes dragons and stuff. I rather like it myself,1317513600,3,108,4.190476190476191

4572877,1,B0055A5VAY,"When I watch a movie called ""Dragon Crusaders,"" I expect two things: dragons and Crusaders. Or crusaders who turn into dragons. Or Crusaders RIDING dragons.

Well, the movie TECHNICALLY has both dragons and Crusaders, but sadly our dragon action is limited to about five deeply unsatisfying minutes smushed in the last act. Instead, we're forced to wander around with Ye Olde Xena, Medieval Bella Swan and a gang of not-very-interesting Templars who do NOT turn into dragons.

The aforementioned Templars have returned home from the Crusades. The king (of England, I assume) has outlawed them, and they are fleeing to Scotland with the king's men in hot pursuit... or so they say. That plot point is forgotten after the first five minutes.

They stop at a village of about nine people, which is being raided by a very small pirate gang. But when they venture out to the pirate ship to rescue a young woman named Neem (Shinead Byrne), she reveals that during the FIVE MINUTES she was captured, she put a curse on anyone who sets foot on the ship. Now the Templars are doomed to turn into horrible gargoyle monsters.

Unsurprisingly, the Templars aren't crazy about the idea, so they begin a race against time to somehow undo the curse. Along with Neem and the female warrior Aerona (Cecily Fay) -- who just sort of appears for no reason -- they set out to confront the evil sorcerer who created the spell, the Black Dragon.

When I watch a movie with ""Dragon"" in the title, I expect there to be some serious draconic screen time. ""Dragon Crusaders"" was a big disappointment in that respect -- not only do the Crusaders not turn into dragons, ride dragons or have anything to do with dragons, but there is a whopping FIVE MINUTES of dragons doing ANYTHING in this movie.

Aside from that disappointment, it's the usual Asylum fare -- dropped plot threads, hilariously awful special effects, deus ex machinae (a mortally wounded crusader is saved by a Random Singing Faerie), and bursts of bad sword-fighting. There are a few interesting scenes, such as when the knights consult with an anachronistic trio of druids, but most of it is pretty dull.

It's also quite obvious that the people who wrote this knew nothing whatsoever about the Knights Templar. I'm just saying.

I will admit that most of the actors playing the Templars are decent enough, but they're all playing characters who have no real depth. Each one has exactly one defining character trait -- paranoid, noble, naive, snarky -- with no history or dimensions outside that. And the female characters are... mind-blowingly awful.

Quick rundown: Aerona is a cut-rate Xena clone, who spends most of her time wearing a leather miniskirt and giant fountain ponytail, bouncing around unconvincingly with a sword. Also, she kills unarmed people. And Neem is basically a medieval Bella Swan -- passive, whiny and effectively useless... and she causes all the problems in the ENTIRE MOVIE. I was rooting for them to just kill her.

""Dragon Crusaders"" is pretty much what you'd expect from the Asylum -- a disappointing mess of bad special effects, lame characters and NOT ENOUGH DRAGONS.",1352246400,4,3142,4.878048780487805

To be able to escape the mundane and experience the impossible makes for a nice few hours of entertainment. This movie though...not so great. I do have to say though that the director himself stated that he opted for horse riders who can act vs. actors who can ride horses. Big difference in quality.

The story was average: group of knights help village, one falls for a girl, there's a dragon somewhere, blah blah. The only saving grace for the film was the setting. My God was the setting gorgeous. Besides that pass on the film.",1341014400,,604,4.490909090909091
4572880,4,B0055A5VAY,"I saw in IMDB that this had a very low rating, typical for 'Sy Fi'  movies, and was shocked at how good it was. The main actress is the most athletic I have ever seen.
---Another example of how critics can make it so people are not interested in seeing a movie. I will purchase it and tell my friends about it",1335916800,3,309,3.9838709677419355
4572881,4,B0055A5VAY,"The latest fantasy epic from micro-budget studio The Asylum and director Mark Atkins (PRINCESS OF MARS, DRAGONQUEST) is probably their best genre effort yet. DRAGON CRUSADERS (2011) is a lively and exciting mini-epic that benefits from a reasonably original story, a good cast, and gorgeous Welsh location work.

A small band of outlaw Knights Templar are accidentally cursed with a magic spell that will turn them - one at a time - into vicious, bat-winged gargoyles. The only hope of breaking the curse is to journey to the mountain stronghold of an evil wizard who not only controls a flock of fire-breathing dragons, but has the ability to become one himself.

With DRAGON CRUSADERS, Atkins fulfills the promise I perceived in his earlier fantasy epic, MERLIN & THE WAR OF THE DRAGONS, with a beautifully shot, well-paced, sword & sorcery adventure. Returning to many of the same picturesque and appropriately Medieval locations seen in MERLIN, and once again employing some very talented Welsh actors, CRUSADERS - shot in 14 days on a shoestring budget - plays and looks far more expensive than it is. Atkins' cinematography and editing are both very slick, and his screenplay is perfectly tailored to make the most of his limited resources.

The cast is uniformly solid. Dylan Jones (who previously appeared in various supporting roles in other Asylum productions, including MERLIN) is appropriately stoic and heroic as the leader of the knights, and handles the swordplay and riding with aplomb (the multi-talented Jones was also the horse master for the film). Sexy stuntwoman Cecily Fay makes a convincing (if tiny!) warrior woman, and Merlin himself, Simon Lloyd-Roberts, is memorable as the youngest of the cursed knights. Really, though, everyone in the cast is surprisingly good.

Production-wise, the costumes and props look fine, the digital creature effects appear to be somewhat more polished than usual, and Atkins makes terrific use of some truly impressive - and authentic-looking - locations. Composer Chris Ridenhour once again rises to the occasion, with another sweeping, epic musical score.

The Asylum DVD presents DRAGON CRUSADERS with a crystal-clear, rock-solid 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen transfer. The viewer's audio options are 5.1 Surround or 2.0 stereo. Supplemental material consists of a ""Making Of"" featurette, a gag reel, and an assortment of trailers for other Asylum titles.

I must say I was pleasantly surprised with DRAGON CRUSADERS. We all know that I'm a pushover for fantasy material, but my expectations were far exceeded by Atkins' accomplished film. If you're an aficionado of dungeons and dragons and mystical tales of heroic deering-do, I suggest at least giving this one a rental - or checking it out when it makes its inevitable SyFy Channel showings. I enjoyed it quite a bit, and you may, too.",1328659200,8,2849,5.209606986899563

It had characters from all over the spectrum that should have never been in the same movie together. It all started to go downhill for me when the ""raiders"" showed up and started ransacking. There were women standing there and they just picked them up and carried them away. No fighting, no screaming, nothing. I remember watching this all the way through once and it was so unremarkable that I forgot about it until I tried to watch it again and remembered that this is not one of those movies you watch twice.",1528156800,,662,4.434426229508197
8457731,2,B0055A5VAY,"Some movies are so bad they are good. Others are just so bad they come off as silly and really pretty poor. This movie is in the latter category but by goodness it tries hard with practically nothing.

Basically this is a tale of a bunch of Templar Knights who... well there isn't really any indication what they are wandering about for - and they happen upon a village that has just had the stuffing smashed out of it by pirates. They sort the pirates out and then go out to their ship that is moored in the bay. Along with them goes this woman (Cecily Fay) who is darn handy in a fight who was also in the village when it was attacked. No indication as to what a fighter of her calibre was doing randomly there is given, she just happened to be hanging out in the local chapel when the pirate attack happened..... Anyway I digress. Once they get on the ship they find out that a young woman from the village played by Shinead Byrne has cursed anyone who gets on board the ship who has spilled blood to morph into some sort of gargoyle creature. And rather inconveniently this includes the Templars who have just rescued her. And she can't remove the curse. Hence they are drawn into an adventure as one by one of them succumbs to the curse. And there is a dragon, which can control the gargoyles the Templars morph into.

This is a very budget movie. The ship is obviously a modern yacht, the whole thing was filmed on the cheap - the costumes, the effects, the camera work - everything screams of poverty. It actually often reminded me of what would happen if your local theatre company decided to make a movie. Cecily Fay is so tiny she looks ridiculous as someone who can fight and the lack of back story for her character is just bizarre. Sinead Byrne manages to have the same frightened/confused look on her face the whole film and the guy who plays the sorcerer towards the end looks like the guy that collects the tickets at your local museum roped in, put in a robe and told to recite some lines. But hilariously it's just because it's all so earnest that you feel churlish complaining overmuch about the performances.

If you enjoy low budget fantasy then this is worth a look. It can't be compared to what might be termed 'proper' movies and probably only rewards viewers who played too much dungeons and dragons as young pups. But we all know there are plenty of those....",1527033600,,2385,4.403628117913832

She tried to do that urban fighting stuff where you jump up on a wall and turn around, but she couldn't get that far up the wall which made it look comical. In one seen she fights with a towel, perhaps a tribute to her former film, ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.""
