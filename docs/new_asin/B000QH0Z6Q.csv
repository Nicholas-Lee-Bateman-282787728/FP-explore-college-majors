8196395,3,B000QH0Z6Q,"In the Italian crime drama, The Killers Are Our Guests (1974) a gang of jewel thieves takes refuge at the home of a physician, after one in their group is injured in a robbery.  It's a dark tale that becomes more suspenseful and sleazy, as various visitors arrive at the residence.

Anthony Steffen plays doctor Guido Malerva, who is forced to tend to the wounded man.  Much of the film is centered on the doctor's wife Mara (Livia Cerini), who draws the attention of several gang members, including Eliana (Margaret Lee).  Mara is terrorized throughout the film, and is attacked and sexually molested several times.  Although seemingly far from the scene of the crime, the doctor's residence still draws the attention of the police, who are led by the Commissario (Luigi Pistilli).

While your attention is fixated on the abuse of Mara, there are some deep undercurrents in play, and the film finishes with a mean and violent twist.  While the story has some issues, if you're into Italian crime dramas, this is one that is worth checking out.",1414368000,,1044,4.798882681564246
8196396,1,B000QH0Z6Q,This movie is not worth the money.  It is shot on a low budget and the acting is bad.  It drags along and never builds up to anything that make you want to keep watching it.  They must have had a short of actresses because they have a dude playing a woman.  I give it one star because Is seems like it was shot in one day.  The killers are our guest is not worth watching.,1306281600,,372,3.8421052631578947
8196397,4,B000QH0Z6Q,"Alfa Digital has released another rare Italian thriller from the seventies 'THE KILLERS ARE OUR GUESTS' aka 'GLI ASSASSINI SONO NOSTRI OSPITI'-1974 and is a welcome treat for all Euro fans.  A jewel heist goes incredibly wrong when one of the robbers is wounded. They quickly find a doctors address who happens to be a prominent surgeon and force him to treat their crony and of course, the events explode.  Sounds like a carbon copy of Enzo G. Castellari's 'COLD EYES OF FEAR' but it isn't.  The plot twists from screenwriters Bruno Fontana and Renato Romano will have you guessing until the end what the outcome of the proceedings will be.  Euro star Anthony Steffen is the surgeon who downplays his performance throughout and the real surprise is Margaret Lee who seems to be the den mother to the robbers.  Never has she looked more beautiful and in this case , more stone cold with a lot of under currents to her character.  She always made each film role that she was in extremely unique and here she portrays a lethal lady with a changing heart keeping the viewers on their toes.  You'll also see Luigi Pistilli as the frustrated detective on the case and an incredibly moving performance by Livia Cerini as the surgeon's frustrated wife.  Vincenzo Rigo practically does a one man operation as he Edited, Photographed, and Directed the 90 minute opus.  The icing on the cake is the beautiful music score by Roberto Rizzo which glides and crackles at just the right moments.  Alfa releases it in a beautiful 1.85 transfer in English and supplies a nice photo gallery .  Highly recommended for fans of rare Euro titles and of course, the ones who love surprise twist endings.  And for all you Margaret Lee fans out there, this is the piece de resistance of a performance. She rocks.",1301270400,,1787,4.6923076923076925

I love this film. Twists here and there that actually were surprising. If you can find it, get it!!!!!!!!",1242864000,2,244,4.4222222222222225
