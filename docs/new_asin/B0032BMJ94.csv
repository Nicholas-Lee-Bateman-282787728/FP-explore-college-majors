8387393,5,B0032BMJ94,"Drama, comedy, action, and romance... there is a taste of everything in this delicious slice of life film.  Set in a cozy and bustling cafe, Eavesdrop allows viewers to quietly observe the beauty of everyday stories that unfold around them.  The characters are so real, it is easy to forget the familiar faces are award winning cast members like Lynn Cohen from The Hunger Games, Chris Parnell of comedy fame, Wendie Malick of Hot in Cleveland, My Girl's Anna Chlumsky, Ted McGinley from Married With Children, and more.

My warning to viewers:  the story unfolds slowly, as all good stories do... be patient.  Enjoy a cup of coffee or a bowl of soup as you eavesdrop.",1418256000,,668,4.724137931034483
