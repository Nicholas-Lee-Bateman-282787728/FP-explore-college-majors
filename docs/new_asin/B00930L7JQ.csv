8534977,3,B00930L7JQ,"Lisa Haynes (Julie Gonzalo) on a beach in Florida walking her three golden retriever puppies - Mario, Luigi, and Pasquale - and, also, her neighbor's boisterous golden retriever, Jake. Observe Jake's leash slips out of Lisa's grip and off the scamp beelines towards that couple there on the sand, the gobsmacked girl and the guy on his knees, proposing. Now calculate the odds that the proposer whom Jake just knocked over is David, long ago Lisa's David.

David Bennett (K.C. Clyde) and Lisa Haynes were friends since they were five until they became college sweethearts, until they broke up.

A mortified Lisa apologizes like crazy, but you can see how David and his prospective fiance Kelly (Kelly Stables) may question her sincerity. It is an epic coincidence. For David, proposal's on hold, mainly because the engagement ring got lost in the scuffle.

Lisa has just moved into her new digs. If I were to move, I hope I'm as lucky as Lisa in that she right away makes friends with her upstairs neighbors, Rod (Bruce Davison) and Katherine (Alley Mills), a sweet retired couple. It's Katherine's golden retriever that Lisa offers to walk with her pups.

Lisa works for Helkin & Meyer Public Relations. David completed his MBA and is a Senior VP at Quantifund. Meaning Lisa and David are responsible adults now. Meaning they should let lie feelings that they once had as callow youths. But you know they won't. And, besides, fate - or the movie plot masquerading as fate - keeps throwing them together. Take Rod, Lisa's old upstairs neighbor. Rod runs into a guy at the park and plays a game of H-O-R-S-E with him, ends up trying to set him up with new friend Lisa. Of course, that guy would have to be David.

I've liked Julie Gonzalo in everything I'd seen her in. She has the cutest crinkle or scar just between her eyebrows. This isn't the best romantic comedy, but Julie elevates it to watchable status. She's ably abetted by Mills and Davison who convincingly play an older couple still very much besotted with each other. Mills and Davison were in the first movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Golden-Christmas-A-Tail-of-Puppy-Love/dp/B00GK6LHGY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Golden Christmas: A Tail of Puppy Love</a>&nbsp;(Amazon Video). (Consider 3 Holiday Tails - aka A Golden Christmas: The Second Tail - a very loose sequel.) But the movie's secret weapon is Alexandra Peters who plays Lisa's sweet but meddling little niece Myra. You'll see Myra again in the third movie,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Home-For-Christmas-A-Golden-Christmas-3/dp/B00DNF1RDI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Home For Christmas: A Golden Christmas 3</a>&nbsp;(DVD).

David's ringtone for Kelly is hilarious. It's Kelly's voice nagging at him to answer the phone. So, yeah, it helps Lisa's cause that Kelly is a bit on the shallow side. Kelly's actually relieved that David's ring got lost because of how cheap a bauble it was, never mind that it's David's Aunt Pearl's ring and, yeah, it's a plastic ring his uncle had gotten from a toy vending machine for ten cents and then had given to his aunt... For David, Aunt Pearl's ring harbors considerable sentimental value. But give Kelly her due, the last we see of her is in a bittersweet scene that reveals more depth to her character than we'd been led to believe. Kelly, your ringtone was dope.

3 out of 5 stars for 3 Holiday Tails. It's a cute romcom, but it's fluff and falls flat in spots. And I admit to feeling some kind of way whenever I see Christmas decorations festooning sunny beaches. You need snow and frost and near-freezing temperatures for it to truly feel like Christmas. Anyway, it's not as much a Christmas movie as it is a movie what's set in December. So, for fans of the twelfth month, this is your huckleberry.
