2223535,5,B0007NN6JC,"As a mid-season filler for ""NYPD Blue"", ""The Job"" turned out to be one of the best shows aired in a long time. With a sharp-witted irreverant script and a uniformly great cast, it should have run longer than 19 episodes.

Denis Leary, co-creator, co-producer and co-writer (with Peter Tolan) stars as unscrupulous Mike MacNeil, a pill-popping chain-smoking NYC Detective trying to keep his wife/family, 26 year old girlfriend and job all in balance. When the show ended, everything was unravelling in his life....

The rest of the cast is just too good to single anyone out, even with the recurring ""guest"" roles - with one stand out there being Janet Hubert-Whitten. Although listed as appearing in only four episodes as Bill Nunn's (Pip) iron fisted domineering wife Adina, her presence is felt in nearly every episode looming over the whipped Pip like a dark menacing cloud.

Nothing whatever is sacred whether it be race, religion or severed body parts. Case in point would be Lt. Williams, played in the pilot episode by Richard Gant, who can't remember the two Hispanic detective's names and calls them rice and beans (""I've been a detective for 36 years...I'm too old to learn new names"")

While many things in the show would be offensive if they were played straight, the brilliant scripts don't pull it's punches on any topic and delivers dead-pan humor with gleeful zest.

The four DVD set comes nicely packaged and has few, but substantial extras, including interviews and a gag reel. Definitely one of the best releases of the year!",1117152000,40,1544,4.900383141762452
2223536,5,B0007NN6JC,"This was probably my favorite t.v. show ever.  It was brilliant.  Every episode made me laugh out loud and not very many shows make me do that.  In fact, for the most part, I hate t.v.  But 'The Job' was not only clever, intelligent and funny, but the casting was perfect and it had believable and fascinating characters.

I'm sure Denis Leary's character being addicted to painkillers was too controversial for an ABC show.  But I found it to be very insightful because there are tons of everyday working class people addicted to painkillers and you'd never know it.  (Doctors really do hand out Vicodin like candy these days and many people get seriously addicted to the stuff and it's more serious than a lot of people realize.)  Mike McNeil had demons, but the writing never became wishy-washy....instead, the humor surfaced bigtime and it made for an entertaining show.

I also appreciated how Denis Leary's character did some of the most despicable things, yet he was still so lovable.  The writing was simply hilarious.  I loved how he put Robert Kelley in an episode playing a character named 'Luiz' when Robert Kelley in his stand up act talks about how annoying it is that everyone in L.A. always thinks he's Hispanic when he's IRISH!  Hahaha.

Probably what I liked most about the show though was its top notch writing and comedic intuition- they really knew how to cut the fat, there were no pointless scenes, uninteresting characters, etc.  I might be the only one who feels this way, but to me each episode was almost like a mini-movie.  They were so perfect!

Anyway, this was a brilliant show.  The characters found themselves in some of the most absurd and ridiculous scenerios that you'll remember for years.  Insanely original.  You won't be disappointed if you watch it.",1116115200,18,1790,4.790849673202614
2223537,5,B0007NN6JC,"I was extremely pissed when ABC kept moving this show around in its short time on tv and then the idiots cancelled the show. In the proverbial Seinfeld character line of ""I like to watch things that don't make me think"" this must have been the reasoning of the ABC schmucks who let this great show go.  I've been waiting since the show was cancelled for it to come out on dvd.  What a great couple of months, first ""The Bob Newhart Show"" comes out and now ""The Job"".  Truthfully, I've never watched a show that continuously made me laugh as hard as this show did.  Thank You.",1113350400,10,575,4.296296296296297
2223538,5,B0007NN6JC,"It was on the set of 1999's The Thomas Crown Affair where acid-tongued comedian/actor Denis Leary met Mike Charles, a New York City cop and technical advisor on the film. Sharing a sense of humor and a working-class Irish background, the two clicked so well Leary decided to turn the veteran detective's stories into his first TV series. Originally planned for a series run on HBO, it wasn't until Peter Tolan (The Larry Sanders Show) came on as executive producer that ABC got interested, offering a bigger budget. In exchange for giving up cable's freedom to use the ""F-word,"" ABC let Leary ""do the show his way."" The result was The Job, an acerbic crossing of Hill Street Blues with NYPD Blue and Barney Miller.

Denis Leary plays Mike McNeil, a good cop with a bad attitude who's made a name for himself by bending the rules; juggling ""the job,"" a suburban wife (Wendy Makkena), a manhattan girlfriend (Karyn Parsons), too much booze and too many pills. Armed with a superbly hilarious ensemble cast and smart & edgy writing, The Job was easily the funniest new show of 2001. The unforgettable supporting cast includes Bill Nunn (Do The Right Thing, Spider-Man films) as Mike's partner Pip Phillips; gorgeous Diane Farr (Roswell, Loveline) as Det. Jan Fendrich; Adam Ferrara and Lenny Clarke as detectives Tommy Manetti & Frank Harrigan; Julian Acosta and John Ortiz as rookie detectives Al Rodriguez & Ruben Sommariba; and Keith David (The Thing, Gargoyles) as Mike's frustrated boss Lt. Tom Williams.

With all 19 episodes from the critically-acclaimed series, it's laughter in the first degree with The Job - The Complete Series. Guest stars include Elizabeth Hurley, Gina Gershon and Janet Hubert-Whitten among others. Here are the contents of this 4-disc collection:

Disc 1: Pilot, Elizabeth, Bathroom, Foot, Massage, Anger

2223582,4,B0007NN6JC,"This is a prequel to Denis Leary's later masterwork ""Rescue me"". The ""JOB"" is entertaining but lighter and easier on the emotions. The main characters can be seen in the early process of evolving their roles as caring public servants with a civic duty and a desire to have a good time. Denis Leary plays a detective with a demanding job, a wife, a family and girlfriend. The show finds humor in the day to day issues of sex, marriage, kids, bosses, and friendship. The funniest scene takes place at a backyard party that goes wild. It is absolutely a hoot, one of the funniest things I can ever remember seeing.

Every episode brought me back to the streets of New York in the Precinct I worked at. I identified with almost every situation portrayed in each episode and I knew some cop who fit that profile, whether it be the ""Goomadas"" on the side, the pill poppers or the alcohol drinkers. I'm sure this series touched home with every cop who has seen it. A truly phenomenal series!!!",1255219200,,457,4.325581395348837

2223592,5,B0007NN6JC,"Before the huge FX hit of Rescue Me, there was ""The Job"".  A show that had great potential but was cancelled because ABC just didn't have the vision of the appeal.  Though cancelled, The Job was a great experimentation lab of portraying NYC's finest on ABC that evolved into portraying NYC's bravest on FX.

The Job stars Denis Leary as NYC detective Mike McNeil as a cop with typical drinking, smoking, self-medicating, and girlfriend/marriage issues.  While out of the house, he manages to cope in rather ""unorthodox"" ways (i.e indulging in his vices) with his girlfriend on the side.

At work Leary is joined by many other cast members (Lenny Clarke, Adam Ferrara, and Diane Farr) that are recognizable from Rescue Me that makeup an absurd rag-tag bunch of detectives that take on some rather strange cases (involving anything from chasing a man in a wheelchair, and almost losing him, protecting movie stars Elizabeth Hurley and Gina Gershon, and spying on women using a telescope from evidence lockup).  I don't know if I laughed more at the humor itself or just thinking of the fact that ABC was owned by Disney by this time and they actually let this air...for TWO SEASONS!

This show is not based on typical police procedurals like NYPD Blue or Law & Order.  The Job is more of a short comedy sitcom that dwells on the ridiculous events that seem to happen on a day to day basis for Det. McNeill and his squad, landing him in hot water with their Captain.  The Job does not always end up with an arrest in every instance.

Special features includes standard gag reels, interviews, and promo commercials.  Some select episodes also include a commentary for that particular episode.  The commentary must have been done quite some time after the show and well into a season or two of Rescue Me, because creators Denis Leary and Peter Tolan bring Rescue Me into the mix of the commentary many times.  So you probably won't get commentary that properly reflects the creators of this show as how this show ties into Rescue Me as a building block to the FX big leagues.

If you like Rescue Me, this one is worth it.",1245110400,2,2116,4.653225806451613

If you're a ""Rescue Me"" fan then you'll recognize several of the same actors are in both series (Not usually to the same extent as they wer in The Job)  The humor from the job transferred easily into Rescue, but The Job was basically a comedy where as Rescue is more of a comedy drama.

If you're a fan of Rescue Me then you really should get this series.  There are some episodes that are so funny all the way through that my stomache was sore from laughing so much.  One of my favorites was when the detectives from the precinct of the main characters was called to invesitgate a corpse of some homeless guy.  After questioning a witness they figured that the detective for the adjoining precinct had lifted the body over the fence so that he wouldn't be stuck with the paper work.  So the same body kept getting dumped back and forth in different locations until someone at the newspaper caught wind of a series of bodies being found in the two precincts as if there was some muder spree going on.

The Job was so funny and original that I just couldn't believe the show would get axed before it had time to build a bigger audience....Anyway this is a damn good laugh though and through....The bonus interviews were pretty good too.",1204416000,3,1463,4.369003690036901

2223603,5,B0007NN6JC,"Think of the job as a comedy Hill Street Blues..a Gritter Barney Miller..

In 2001, Denis Leary created the Job with Peter Toland (who also created Rescue Me).It was an ensemble cast that meshed as well together. It was too bad ABC could not stay the course and would not let this show grow. The complete series only lasted 19 episodes, but they are as good in 2007 as the espisodes were in the year 2001.

Leary plasys Mike McNeil, a tough as nails cop who has an opinon on everything. He is partner with Pip (Bill Nunn), who is McNeil friend and voice of reason. Diane Farr (Numb3rs),Lenny Clarke and Keith David (the voice of Spawn-the HBO cartoon) are supporting players, as was the crew in Barney Miller was to Hal Linden.

The comedic timing in every day situations makes this show work and make this show as timely as it was in 2001. My favorite episodes are both on the first disk, Elizabeth (with Special Guest Star Elizabeth Hurley ) and Bathroom (where Mike is held at gunpoint in a john)

ABC, you canceled Kevin Smith's Clerks the Cartoon and This show, maybe you need to think before you cancel quality and niche shows. Both complete shows on DVD and well worth to buy

SO GET OFF YOU BUTTS AND BUY THIS ONE!

2223606,5,B0007NN6JC,"I found out about The Job by viewing Denis Leary and Peter Tolan's second series, Rescue Me on broadcast TV.  Although a very dark comedy, I found Rescue Me interesting and entertaining.  Based on a TV interview of  Leary and  Tolan, the creators of both shows, I ordered the Complete Series DVD of The Job without much information about the series.  I am very pleased with The Job DVDs.

In some ways, I find The Job more entertaining than Rescue Me.  Its humor is less dark and less threatening.  Rescue Me is more visceral.  The Job is more clearly a satire and less emotionally demanding.  It tickles rather than smacking the viewer.

Leary is the star of The Job, but the ensemble cast is outstanding and each character and actor adds much to each show.  It is worth mentioning the some of the other members of The Job cast--in particular Diane Farr and Lenny Clark--also show up in Rescue Me.

The series is unconventional in characters, plots, language, drama and presentation.  Mike McNeil, the Leary character, is a lovable scoundrel whose approach to police work is both insulting to and appreciative of actual police behavior.  A sensational send up of policing and police dramas and comedies, this series presents police and criminals as human failures.  Not entirely real world, but amusing.  It is a priceless commentary on the job and its tensions, pressures and the tragic human comedy of the dirty work of crime and punishment.

The fact that the show was filmed entirely on location in New York harkens back to earlier TV police drama like  the Naked City.  The setting is nearly as important as the action and the dialog.  The city scene infiltrates every aspect of the show.

The special features such as the commentaries of Leary and Tolan and cast interviews increase the value of the DVD set and enliven appreciation of the series' artistic achievements.",1170028800,2,1877,4.8

2223613,3,B0007NN6JC,"this show is all about comedy..  it doesn't ever seem to get serious like ""rescue me"" does.  the comedy is decent, but with ""rescue me"" you get better comedy AND drama... and much better characters, too.  so in my mind there's not any point in watching ""the job"" unless i want to waste some time and be amused.  it's about wacky cops doing silly things.  but i won't be laughing hard and revelling in all the plot twists like in ""rescue me.""  and this show is basically an earlier version of that show... even some of the same actors are used, and denis leary's character has a drug problem.  it all comes across as like an early version of ""rescue me,"" before denis leary really did the whole thing right.",1156377600,3,706,4.384615384615385
2223614,5,B0007NN6JC,"I watched this one renting from my local Online Rental service.  I truly believe this to be one of the funniest Major Network cop shows ever appearing on TV.  It is chock full of belly laughs.  I find it hard to believe that this, Boomtown, and other great series dramas don't bring in the viewers and sell the network.  I blame it on marketing, but what the heck do I know, I'm just a clog in a big wheel.

Dennis Leary carries this one high above other shows he's appeared on, though I see Rescue Me is doing quite well.  His relaxed scumbag character works very well for him.  The fact that the writers give him his lumps at the right time, makes him a loveable ""Playa.""

I checked a website, which lists and gives a description of each episode, and I noticed the order they list, is not the order I had it on my DVD's.  So, I'm confused by this.  When I watched the show, in the order on the DVD set, it seemed to work for me. And the final episode, Betrayal, left several cliff hangers, that made you want to watch the next season.  Can anyone enlighten me on this?

Possible spoiler:  I also loved the running gag about the detective (name?) who never talks.  And in the final episode, Betrayal, he damages his mouth, and then decides to start talking, and nobody, except the other detectives can understand him.  Halarious!  Anyone else catch this?  It took me about 5 shows, before I realized that this detective never uttered a word.  Funny stuff!

Two hard long thumbs way up!

2223615,5,B0007NN6JC,"Leave it to ABC to cancel a classic series.  It would have been cool to see the development of this series over time. Good thing ABC went with shows like the ""World according to Jim"" instead of ""The Job"". Great series.",1154044800,4,218,4.317073170731708
2223616,5,B0007NN6JC,"As I write this, 28 others have already reviewed this box set and 27 of them have given it 5 stars with the lone dissenter giving it a respectable 4 stars.  I think that probably speaks for itself.

If you need further evidence for the quality of this show consider that it was cancelled after only a season and half, thereby putting it into that depressing Pantheon of shows that were just too good for the average public (other members include: Freak and Geeks, Wonderfalls, My So-Called Life, and Undeclared).

Now to the show itself.  It's funny and engrossing.  Denis Leary and his frequent show-biz cohorts, including Diane Farr, Lenny Clarke, and Adam Ferrara, are convincing in both the dramatic and comedic elements of the show.  The writing is smart and inventive-- Leary himself is among the credited writers-- and the characters are people that you'll actually care about.

It's sad that series ended so soon, especially since the final episode reveals so much potential for further development, but with this box set you can at least experience 18 episodes of one of the all-time great TV shows.",1151193600,6,1108,4.861702127659575

2223620,5,B0007NN6JC,"Cop shows and sit-coms are two of New York's cultural gifts to the world, and this terrific show succeeds in both genres. As a cop show it seems authentic - work is secondary to gossip and various private pursuits (like any office job, then), and the only cases that get solved are the ones thrown in our heroes laps. The comedy arises out of the multi-faceted characterisation, and is dark, biting and satirical. The scripts are superb, helped by the sensible half-hour running time, and they're incredibly dense for a TV show. Perhaps that's one of the reasons why it took a while to find an audience. It's a shame, because the last half dozen episodes are brilliant. Season Three could have been stellar.

Actually, no it wasn't .... this show was too smart and too funny for ABC and the average Raymond-watching couch potato.  So, like all intelligently hysterical shows, it had to die an early death.  OK, enough editorializing! :)

I don't remember any particulars (sorry!) as it's been so long since I saw this show, all I remember is from the end of one episode looking forward *all week* until the next one came out!  It was filled with wicked black humor, as anyone familiar with Denis Leary would expect.  The supporting cast were just fantastic ... the two standouts I recall in particular were a big, older white guy and a black guy.  (Gee that's helpful, huh?  Go ahead and click the 'this review not helpful' link - I deserve it!)  The chemistry of these two actors with DL was just fantastic.  This show had me in tears each week, it was so funny, and so fresh, and so unlike anything else on TV at the time.

I'm ordering this TONIGHT and paying extra for the overnight shipping, that's how badly I want to have this DVD in my possession!  And it will be worth every penny!",1131926400,4,1212,4.429864253393665

Denis Leary doesnt have the chance to be as selfish and obnoxious as his character in Rescue Me and as such Mike McNeil suffers a little in characterisation.  Lenny Clarke and John Ortiz are the other most enjoyable actors here.  Clarke is hilarious and Ortiz is very sweet.  Its a pity the relationship between McNeil and Diane Farr's detective Jan didn't have time to develop because they were definitely being set up as a possible romance.

The extras on the disc are quite good: the outtakes are great of course, the inteerview with Leary and show co-creator Peter Tolan is the best of the rest.",1127260800,3,713,4.672

The duration of each edgy comedy show is 30 minutes.  I highly reccommend this first and only season television show because Denis Leary is not very adept at all the lying and cheating he does, although he seems to think he is.

""The Job"" was a very funny show, that was obviously a little too edgy for network TV.
