The science behind this ""cure"" should have had more history & explanation. This could have been made into a good & interesting movie, but it failed.",1478304000,9,269,4.294117647058823

Good movie to watch, different!",1357948800,,194,4.705882352941177
4331216,4,B004D2R1BW,"Some believe that the soul escapes the body at the last breath. It was believed that this breath has the power to cure disease and give eternal life. In the 1930's Dr. Kaminsky harnessed the power to contain this last breath. Susan Jordan runs an antique shop and has a cox that Dr. Kaminsky kept this secret in. The box draws the attention of 2 men with very different intentions. Susan soon finds herself in a perilous battle to protect the secrets inside the box.

This movie has a very interesting premise, and a lot of mystery and suspense. However, the acting is kinda bad. The characters have lots of potential, but the actors are not convincing at all. I really did enjoy watching this movie for the interesting story. It's very different and intriguing. This movie has tons of potential. I think that if the right person got their hands on the script and a better budget, this movie could be remade and do very well. Unfortunately the way things are now, this movie is just a little better than average.",1353715200,3,1012,4.56043956043956
4331217,4,B004D2R1BW,"In 1936, a doctor working on curing diseases discovered that if you could capture the dying breath of someone, after they drank an elixir, inhaling that breath could cure ailments and stop the aging process. It also had the ability for the person who inhaled the substance to obtain some of the memory of the deceased and personality traits. Unfortunately the memories he obtained were from the criminally insane. A box containing the doctors last breath ends up in Baltimore. It is owned by a woman with a terminal disease who ironically runs a curio shop called, ""Second Chance.""

When 2 people come calling for the box at the same time and is willing to pay huge amounts for it, she becomes suspicious. The movie has a few plot twists.

It was an interesting concept and plot. The cast was less than spectacular. Matthew J. Wright speaks lines that were meant for Nicolas Cage. Tracy Teague was about a C+. Good script. They could have made the vials fancy, more like ampules, and instead of breath looking like black soot, they could have used the glowing white eerie smoke...LIKE THEY SHOW ON THE DISPLAY!

No sex, f-bomb, very brief nudity in the flashback (don't blink).",1305504000,4,1177,4.7317073170731705

If youve got 90 free minutes to kill,, it's not the worst, but it ain't the best.

Plus what were all those math equations about i all you need is for a person to breathe their last breath into a vial?

4331254,1,B004D2R1BW,"If you like those ""Pandora's Box"" type movies, try The Possession (2012 about a ""Dybbuk"" box) which far superior, not to be confused with other movies of a similar title.

""Respire"" is indeed possessed of a terrible script, terrible editing, terrible premise and showcasing a terrible way to behave towards ones physician who's been treating you for cancer.

Oh right, paying $30K for something that can be very easily faked and is already questionable as to it's stupid-natural properties.
museums and auction houses are fooled all the time.

love the interior of this tack-o-rama box; fake blue velvet in mint condition, no signs of discoloration, wear or aging.
Anybody would have been knocked unconscious by the mold and mildew alone.

4331257,3,B004D2R1BW,"It's an original story in the genre but obvious at the lower end of the budget scale for productions. The main protagonist (Tracy Teague) is an attractive milf type, but appears to be the only cast member that's ever acted before. As mentioned in another other review the cover art depicting the Respire is far better in appearance then the cheesy way it is portrayed in the film.

The doctor had hidden vials in several places and his wife saved his last breath in one and kept in a secret box....then the story comes to present time where it explains more what properties this breath has.

Well, I guess if you have no idea how to create the movie that should come from these ingredients you bumble around, going nowhere fast, then let the whole thing descend into a Keystone Cops style zombie-fest (they're not actually zombies but a bunch of over stimulated extras running in circles covered in blood is basically the same thing). Those are the sort of movies that require none of what you have, just a few idiots that want to get on camera, a cellphone and a budget that will cover beer and pizza. Why would you do that? I have no idea but the whole thing is a let down.
