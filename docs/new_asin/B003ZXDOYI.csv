4236543,5,B003ZXDOYI,"Managed to catch the second half of this documentary on TV and upon finishing it, I made sure to catch it on the next airing so I could see the whole thing. I was a big fan of the Columbian soccer team and knew almost nothing about their background. I knew Escobar (the footballer) who scored the own-goal in the US World Cup was murdered when he returned to Columbia but that was the extent of my knowledge.

I HIGHLY recommend this documentary to soccer fans as well as anyone interested in Pablo Escobar and the many roles he played in Columbia.",1285718400,,548,4.372549019607843

4236547,5,B003ZXDOYI,"This sports documentary was fantastic. I had the chills during and after seeing it. It is a very powerful movie, and living in the U.S. it really opened my eyes to see the passion, the corruption, and the extreme devotion in the sport of soccer in other countries. This is about players from different Columbian club teams coming together to represent their country in the world cup. I love this documentary and it is definitely in the top 5 sports documentaries I have ever seen.",1369699200,,480,4.658823529411765
4236548,5,B003ZXDOYI,"This is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen.  There is such a complex story here I can't believe Hollywood hasn't made a major motion picture based on it.  This is one of those programs that is not only interesting for someone who has no interest in soccer, but creates an interest after watching.",1363910400,,308,4.482142857142857
4236549,5,B003ZXDOYI,I am colombian and I learned a lot of what was going on during this time. I usually show the movie to my students and they love it.,1360022400,,131,3.7142857142857144

4236551,5,B003ZXDOYI,"It's surreal to realize that I watched the Colombia v USA match in 1994 on television but didn't learn about the death threat that the Colombian players were playing under until viewing this documentary. These were brave lads to even take the pitch. This documentary, linking the rise of Colombian soccer and Andres Escobar to the rise of the Colombian drug cartels and Juan Pablo Escobar (no relation) is brilliantly told. The interviews with family members, politicians, and former drug cartel leaders interspersed with exciting footage from Colombian soccer's heyday is put together in a way that not only tells the story of those two people and their families but also of how Colombia came to be conflicted in its own views of the drug lords and the lasting fallout from those tragic days.",1349395200,,793,4.925373134328358
4236552,5,B003ZXDOYI,"Best 30 for 30 Documentary hands down! I remember watching the game and seeing Andres Escobar score against his own team and saying to myself, ""He's going to have some problems"" I didn't realize just how bad. I finally got a chance to see this documentary and not just about his killing but of the life of Andres Escobar which is far more interesting than his death. The documentary is truly engrossing with it's interviews and archival footage.",1341878400,,445,4.717948717948718
4236553,5,B003ZXDOYI,I am  Colombian and I grew up during a really difficult time in my country. The first hand interviews are a plus. I showed the documental in my Spanish classes and my students loved it.,1318118400,,185,4.285714285714286

8411203,4,B003ZXDOYI,"""The Two Escobars"" (2010 release; 104 min.) brings the parallel yet indirectly intertwined stories of Pablo Escobar and Andres Escobar (they are not related) in Colombia of the late 80s and early 90s. From humble beginnings Pablo eventually becomes the No. 1 drug king of Colombia, which is saying something. Andres, from equal humble beginnings, eventually becomes a star soccer (football) player, becoming even captain of the Colombian national team, which reaching new peaks as never before, eventually rising to the No. 4 ranking on the FIFA world rankings/. Then comes the 1994 World Cup in the US, where Colombia enters as one of the favorites...

Couple of comments: first, this movie is a riveting political and sports documentary (or is it a sports and political documentary--you decide)., you simply can't make this stuff up. It's the reason why facts always trumps fiction, and why I am such a fan of documentaries. Second, with the passage of time, this documentary, reflecting on events now 20-25 years ago, has become a great time capsule of how things where then. Check out the incredible footage of Medellin, Colombia's second largest city, in the 80s and early 90s, when the drug wars were being played out in the open, every day. Third, the movie does a great job documenting how soccer was used to money-launder drug money, creating Colombia's so-called ""narco-soccer"" peak in the late 80s (when Andres' team wins the Copa Libertadores, the first Colombian team to do so). At one point, Pablo, then in jail, summons the Colombian national soccer team to come play a soccer game, AT THE PRISON, and they do! It would be the equivalent of a jailed drug king summoning the Yankees for an intra-squad game of baseball, can you imagine? Last but not least, the documentary does a decent job bringing the non-sports angles (drugs and politics) of Pablo Escobar. We see him move heaven and earth to influence the Colombian parliament to abolish extradition to the US. ""Sooner a grave in Colombia than a jail in the US"", he comments. Wow.

This was originally released in the ESPN 30 For 30 series of documentaries, but the merits of this documentary go far beyond sports. Even if you don't care for sports or for soccer, I guarantee that you will be moved by this documentary. ""The Two Escobars"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1394150400,3,2330,4.89620253164557
