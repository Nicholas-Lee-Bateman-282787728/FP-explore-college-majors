I would definetly recommend for anyone who's kids like Thomas!",1332201600,3,346,4.028985507246377
4444012,3,B004P7CMIW,"I thought that this was going to be a new Thomas movie about a special birthday event for Thomas or something like that. It is just a compilation of all of the little clip movies that are already on other Thomas DVD's that pertain to a random party or celebration.
I was watching this with my son and was bored because I had already seen all of this before.
He wasn't dissapointed because he is only 2, and didn't realize that he should be dissapointed... so thats good... but I was sad I wasted money on this. The box was cute, and the whistle was a nice touch, but those whistles are only $1.25 by themselves.",1312502400,14,611,4.275862068965517
