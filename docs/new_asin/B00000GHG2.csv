It's more than that - it is ridiculous; unless of course he/she is refering to the original B/W 1940s Brief Encounter starring Trevor  Howard and Celia Johnson. That was a classic. Is the reviewer aware that  he/she has lavished praise on the 1970s version with Richard Burton and  Sophie Loren? Oh yes, it's a nice enough love story - in a daytime soapy  sort of way. But it also happens to be the worst remake in the entire  history of remakes!",945475200,9,529,4.526315789473684

Hot Toasty Rag, July 21, 2017

This movie reminded me of Falling in Love, starring Meryl Streep and Robert DeNiro in 1984, since both plots involve two married people falling in love when they meet during their daily train ride to work. In both movies, the affair is built on companionship rather than sex, but when I looked it up to find out if Falling in Love was a remake of Brief Encounter, the director and screenwriter specifically stated that their film wasn't a remake. I suppose in Hollywood, you can get away with something like that, but in my opinion, the original deserved a nod and credit as such. Also, this version is itself a remake of the 1945 Brief Encounter, but at least it gives credit to the Noel Coward play both films were based on.

Brief Encounter stars Richard Burton and Sophia Loren, but for some unknown reason, there isn't much chemistry between the two. And its Sophia Lorenare we really supposed to believe Richard Burton is only interested in her personality? Hes awkward and anxious at best, and she seems utterly disinterested in him, so the overall story doesnt really work. Id recommend watching the 1984 version instead; its quite cute.",1500595200,,1202,4.746411483253588
7909108,1,B00000GHG2,"This is such an incredibly bad attempt to rip off a classic that all copies should be collected and burned.  Who could possibly have imagined casting one of the sexiest women who ever lived?  Sophia Loren.  Why not Marilyn Monroe?  And Burton?  The only choice that could possibly have been worse is W.C. Fields.

The badness begins with it being in color.  How would you like The Maltese Falcon in color.  Or Casablanca?  Imagine the last scene with a lovely pink fog and an orange Braniff jet liner.  Ruby red lips .... you get the idea.  Brief Encounter is meant to be in black and white.

Then you couple a roue with a sex kitten and they are supposed to be accidentally attracted to each other?  To fall in love?  Maybe in Flying Down to Rio but not in a 40's era, English railroad station.

This film has absolutely NO redeeming virtue.  Quite the opposite.  It is like an open casket funeral.  I don't like them because I don't want my last memory of my friend or relative or spouse or other person to be of him or her lying dead in a casket.  If you are a fan of the original, this version will have the same effect.  It will be your last memory of a wonderful film and you will find it sticks in your head like a bad advertising jingle.

If you loved the classic, do NOT watch this thing.  You will regret having done so forever.",1500336000,,1338,4.268

7909111,4,B00000GHG2,"Anna Jesson (Sophia Loren) meets Alec Harvey (Richard Burton) accidentally at first, when she gets some of the railroad dust (grit) in her eye and he helps remove it.
They then run into each other outside a cathedral the following week, while Anna is having her exotic lunch of prosciutto on crackers or was it bread...either way, it intrigues Alec and draws him in to wanting to know Anna more...The conversations seem to flow easily, perhaps given Anna's part time job as a councellor...
Over the following weeks of innocent meetings, they realize they are now madly in love with each other, all this while not having even touch each other even briefly (Wow, I have to bow to that, as it would have driven me mad, to not even hold hands or kiss the person I am so madly in love with)....
The question I do have at this point is: what was lacking in Anna's houselife that led her to let her guards down when chatting up Alec?
It seemed from the glimpses of her home life that everything was quite satisfactory, in a dull and boring way, needless to say.
While it was made perfectly clear when Alec was unhappy in his marriage, his wife was obviously just not there for him, she even claims that the love had long faded away, says this while reading her book, while Alec is hoping to strike a conversation, while relaxing in the living room...
The movie does show the building of the romance in a way that is almost a breath of fresh air, today, when every movie we come across is really a porn fest with skin being flaunted in your face within the first 10 minutes of the movie.
It also seems like documentary of Sophia's own true life story almost, is she saying that she would rather choose the safety of her own boring married life, rather than give in to the temptations of the exciting, sexual romances that may have come her way during the course of her career...
Either way, it is a fine movie, but seems Richard Burton has given this more of his heart than Sophia. There have been scenes where Sophia seems to have dropped it like a hot potato....
It is still a good movie, as you see, I am a sucker for romantic movies.",1363046400,2,2129,4.3924050632911396

7909113,4,B00000GHG2,"This film is very good but has a central fail even considering it's made in the decade of 1940's. Interpretations, drama and black & white photography  are superb. A man and a married woman, both in middle age, knows each other by hazard in a railroad station near London and falls in love. One must accept the moral and uses are these of the decade of 1940's, but even so, the situation becomes a little absurd as they don't consummate any sexual act nor even appears a slight suggestion. I think sex is exaggerated in today's cinema but in this movie it seems so hot passion rest incomplete and unreal, being substituted by cinema sessions, restaurant lunches and many walking by countryside, and that seems to me a little absurd. Also, curiously I have the feeling this film is conceived under a feminine point of view, being the director a man.",1155427200,,848,4.6158940397351
7909114,5,B00000GHG2,"Well, after reading previous reviews, I am glad I don't read them before seeing most movies.  I loved this film and thought the chemistry between Burton and Loren was great.  I yearned for more intense romantic scenes, but that was part of the effect of the film- to relay to the viewer the frustration of the characters.  This movie really moved me.  Don't pay attention to the negative reviews. If you like a good romance with substance and message, this is excellent.",1033689600,13,470,4.695121951219512
7909115,4,B00000GHG2,"A bad reviews always seems to be destiny of remake films; everybody compares a film with an old one-without any understanding that new version should be ground in a new startingpoint-new time, new attitude. Sometimes this very limit attitude is very difficult to understand, specially in a case of Alan Bridges ""Brief Encounter""-what is very good and beautiful story, and remake film-to TV. Or should I believe that all this missunderstood and critics of this film are only resalt of inability feel any emotions , any sensability to see relatioship of two person under sosicial pressure?
Brief Encounter-starring Sophia Loren and Richard Burton is very beautiful and moving film-without any overacting. It's a full of real life and deep emotion-and expectations of rolemodels of the housewife-and sosial life eihgter. It seems to be very difficult for the American audience understand, that real acting is not acting like those past greats Joan Grawford or Bette Davis usually did; manerism-emotions could be shown more minimalism ways-like Loren and Burton exactly do- and do one of their best roles! Director Bridges has got an interesting athmosphiere between homelife-and railwaystation-where two people try to get something new taste of life-and a world around is so noicy-cruel and routine. I thing that is what is all abouth question in love-and this film shows it very beautiful way; dream of better life-and the ties of ordinary life. Pictures of this VHS-movie are colorfull, sharp and clear. So...",1007856000,8,1508,5.261410788381743
7909116,1,B00000GHG2,"The only reason anyone would watch this utterly inferior remark of the Trevor Howard ""Brief Encounter"" is because they want to ridicule Burton and Loren's wretchedly bad acting. Not only is the script insipid,  trite, boring and absurd, the acting by the two major players is an  atrocity.
We can expect over-acting and drunken on-camera stupors from  Burton, but in this turkey, even the usually reliable Loren falters badly.  These two had zero screen chemistry and Burton particularly sleepwalks  through every scene.
If you want class, please purchase the excellent  original version of 'Brief Encounter' and avoid this bomb.",962928000,19,629,5.303030303030303
