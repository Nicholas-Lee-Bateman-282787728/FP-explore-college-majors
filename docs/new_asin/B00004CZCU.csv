8166342,5,B00004CZCU,"I  originally saw this movie on PBS here in Region 1 (Pittsburgh,Pa. ) and have been waiting for a DVD release which has never come. So I bought a multi-region DVD player to watch the movie here in Pittsburgh, At the time this struck me as one of the best World War 1 movies ever made. I received my copy a few days ago and watched in awe at Paul McGann's performance! A tour-de-force, indeed. There was much bitterness among the Tories about their portrayal in the movie and claims of historical inaccuracy. That  squashed the movie. Socialism, class distinction, and training brutality at Etables  are all covered here---welded together by Paul McGann's performance as the professional thief and scamp, Percy Toplis. Absolutely great..but I must worn you this is written by an Irish-American--no friend of the Tories or British Empire.

Someone has to pick up the ball and make a Region 1 copy so it can be seen stateside.",1418774400,2,924,4.75625
8166343,5,B00004CZCU,"Ah, they don't make them like this any more. Back in the eighties, you only had four channels, so you had prestigious drama series like this. This is much shorter than the two greatest eighties miniserieses- Brideshead Revisited and The Jewel in The Crown. There are only four episodes here- 75 minutes each, though we get the treat of a 90 minute finale- but unlike in the modern era, programmes could take as long as they needed in order to tell the story, so the running times are perfect.

As for the historical accuracy of the drama, it's all very dubious. Lots of people at the time got huffy with the BBC for what they saw as being lefty propaganda, as it's written by the writer of Boys From The Black Stuff, Alan Bleasdale. There is a clear left-wing aspect, particularly in the finale, but at least it raised some questions and caused a debate about WW1. There's no nostalgia pondering about the futility of war- it's actually just a brilliant story about a fascinating character.

Whether Paul McGann's version of Percy Toplis and Bleasdale's version of events are true to reality is debatable. You, casual viewer, should not concern yourself with such things. McGann is certainly a lot better looking than the real life Percy Toplis, who looked like a conniving rat. Toplis is much more likeable here as a sort of anti-hero who really couldn't care less about the conventions of the period. The first episode looks at his humble beginnings in the grim North. There's some accidental humour where McGann has to play fifteen-year-old Percy, but once Percy becomes twenty, it's a little easier to deal with.

So how does this ne'er-do-well become that guy on the DVD cover? Through sheer guts- or maybe stupidity. By night, Toplis- an unwillingly conscripted private- takes on the identity of a dead officer, with a monocle for a nice touch (if not a little sinister), in order to enjoy the high life. It's a brilliant exploration of class and rank- the controversial message is that there is nothing more to it than clothing and manner. But McGann doesn't simply play dress up- he morphs into this dashing illusion. On a visit to his home town, the entire village, who shunned him, bow down to him, and Toplis can revel in his new-found 'heroism'.

When his troop go to a brutal training camp in Etaples, Toplis' casual mutiny becomes real, as he encourages his fellow men to create chaos. However despite Toplis' popularity, he is loveless. In peacetime he finds love but will his past catch up with him?

A lot of WW1 dramas have similar themes, which can all go under the umbrella of 'War Is Bad'. You'd be forgiven for thinking that this was like Birdsong, full of the horrors of war and the sentimentality of love, but it has its own personality. Not that it shies away from the horrors, but instead of these horrors being on the battlefield, they're in the training camps, run by sadists. Brigadier General Thomson (Timothy West), who oversees the camp, is a nuanced character. Initially he's as smarmy and unconcerned as any fictional WW1 officer but then we learn how as a young man he had tried a looser more democratic way of leading and been humiliated for it. Toplis has the advantage of being able to escape his class but Thomson cannot. Another character who is stuck in their class- and sex- is Lady Angela Forbes (Penelope Wilton), who witnesses the brutalities firsthand but whose pleas to Thomson lead nowhere. Wilton is great at balancing comic verbal sparring and sassy feminism with the tragedy of powerlessness.

For me, these characters help to combat the myth that the drama is only concerned with glorifying anarchist Percy Toplis and singing the praises of the working class. As I have said earlier in the review, the central theme for me is the demystifying of class. It's not about saying that the working class are better and more honest; Toplis is a far from innocent character. He's a man- barely more than a boy- whose prime concern is what will benefit him, and how far he can push his luck. As he says right at the start of episode one, ""The funny thing is that when I had nothing to lose, I always won"". That line is why Thomson, Forbes, and Cruikshank will always lose- because to the world at large, class is everything. It would have been a lot easier for the public to come to terms with The Monocled Mutineer if it blamed a particular class but it blames class itself. Almost communist!

It's a well-made, well-acted piece, with Paul McGann showing how charismatic and nuanced he can be in a lead role. Unfortunately, whether it is by choice or accident, he has only cropped up in secondary roles. You can see him in lead roles in Paper Mask (where he uses his imposting talent) or Dealers (where he plays a beautiful but vapid dealer in a second-rate Wall Street) but he's never had anything like this role again. An added bonus is that he has a lovely singing voice and gets to sing two songs here- a comic period number 'Oh Antonio' and a lovely old-fashioned love song, 'Let The Great Big World Keep Turning'. You'll have to keep some smelling salts handy for the latter as McGann's dashing-o-meter is up to full. Swoon!",1390521600,2,5174,4.666666666666667
8166344,1,B00004CZCU,"Percy Toplis, the subject of the series, was a colorful criminal who functioned for many years within the British Army during and after World War One. But while he was a real person, this drama is total fiction which only includes small incidental bits from his life. That is a shame because the real story of Toplis is actually quite interesting to seemingly everyone but Alan Bleasdale who did the adaptation.

The real story of Toplis was interesting because he was a criminal who could function perfectly within the army. He could game the system in any number of ways. Get nearly whatever he wanted, travel wherever he wanted and live in reasonable comfort. Toplis was not as they would make him a deserter living a miserable life out in the forest. The life he lived at the margins of the army was a reality for some who fought in the war but a reality rarely talked about. In a war involving millions, large numbers of men could easily slip through the cracks.

Bleasdale wrote a fictional story where Toplis is a sort of world war one sparticus who takes command of an army mutiny and then gets chased down by an inspector Javert type character. Toplis, as per the logic of these things, is a natural leader but lacks the political education necessary to lead the revolution. The author takes a real event (the riot at Etaples in France during the war) and replaces it with his own fiction. Rather than a small riot at a training camp that lasted a few days, it becomes an all-out mutiny where ordinary soldiers and deserters flying red flags take over the camp killing NCOs, military police and officers. It often seems more the wishful thinking of the author rather than any sort of story grounded in history.

Every officer in the military is either Colonel Blimp or a homocidal lunatic out to exterminate the socialist menace. All the ""bad"" non-working class characters talk in absurdist conspiratorial terms. The solution to a military mutiny is simply to send those who participated up to the front because apparently in this version of the war, everyone who fought at the front died immediately. Britain is a fascist country run by the army who apparently round up their political enemies off the streets. Better yet, senior generals apparently spend their time removing candidates for parlament they don't like.

The first episode features an officer being executed for being a coward. But as far as I can tell, the script just makes the event up. There were only three british officers executed in the war. Total executions (all ranks) for cowardice and throwing away arms was 20 in the entire war. But the program tries hard to create a different view.

Toplis takes command of the mutineers and negotiates a deal with the commanding officer of the base. But of course afterward the OC is removed and replaced with competent officers who kill their enemies and bring in ""Javert"" to hunt down Toplis. Young Sparticus (Toplis) is such a danger to the established order that they are still hunting him down years after the war.

Toplis then makes the inevitable mistake that all proto-revolutionaries make in these dramas: He tries to make money and live a normal life. We all know that the only way that can end is death. Sure enough, success brings Toplis nothing but a storm of bullets through the chest.

The story is trash. Its always usually a bad idea to use real people and real events to tell an utterly fictional story. The writing is extremely paranoid and many of the characters are simply 2-dimensional props. But the production and the cast are excellent. Especially Paul McGann as Toplis. Philip McGough as Woodhall and Cherie Lunghi as Dorothy.",1386201600,2,3675,4.759811616954474
8166345,5,B00004CZCU,I do not own this dvd as I'm in the US and it's in non USA format but I was able to watch it online somewhere. It is a fantastic production with fine acting and great period detail. I would love it if this was released here for fans of quality British tv!,1261872000,8,255,3.830188679245283
8166346,5,B00004CZCU,"I saw this as a TV series when it was broadcast by the BBC in 1986 and then purchased the VHS set. I now also own this on DVD.
It's a first class movie (series?) which captures, amongst other things, the filth and squalor of the Trenches during the Great War.
How true the part of the story concerning Toplis' involvement in the British/Anzac mutiny at Etaples will only be known when the Official Papers are released in 2017.
The movie covers Toplis' life both before and after the War, right up to his eventual demise at the hands of armed British police.
All exciting stuff!
Despite some of the story possibly being fiction, it's a great piece of entertainment as well as social comment on the conditions that the soldiers had to fight under.
Well scripted, well directed and well acted by top class Brit and Aussie actors.
I can highly recommend this movie.
Buy and enjoy",1194912000,5,875,4.544303797468355
