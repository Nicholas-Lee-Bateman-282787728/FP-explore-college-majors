2737670,4,B000MNOXJO,"In a day and age where the American Pie films are considered raunchy sex comedies, a movie like Pervert is quite refreshing coz it shows us what a raunchy sex comedy really is.  Director Jonathan Yudis has made it his mission to practically duplicate a Russ Meyer film.  The dialogue, flow, humor, feel, and even the cover art are all Meyer.  Even plot points and direct scenes are taken straight from Meyer films and recreated, and that makes it kinda fun for a Meyer fan to play ""Guess that movie"".  Some might call it a ripoff, but it's so damn close that you know it's a tribute/homage film, and that's certainly welcome since we don't see films like this anymore.  If you're gonna recreate a style, might as well do it right, and Yudis does a damn fine job.  He does up the gore content however, and it makes the film a little more horror-esque in nature.  Meyer's films had scenes of violence as well, but Pervert does up the ante.  Raunchy?  Damn straight!  It's about as nasty as the law will allow without calling it a porno film.  And Yudis uses sexy full figured women as opposed to Hilton types who look like they belong hanging in an anatomy class for students to study.  I'm not sure which is nastier in the sex department, this or Meyer's Beneath the Valley of the Ultravixens.  The only problem I have with Pervert(and it's not that big of a problem) is that it makes you think of Meyer and you find yourself longing for one of his films.  Kinda like going to see a tribute band, where it can be a great and accurate performance, but in the end nothing beats the real deal.  But hey, if you're not familiar with Meyer you won't have this problem, but it's only right that you know where this film comes from.  But on it's own, Pervert is one of the best comedies to come along in a long, long time.  A great tribute that brings you back to those wonderful days of the 70s sexploitation picture.  Way to go, Jonathan!",1177891200,4,1932,4.379213483146067
2737671,5,B000MNOXJO,"...it has an old feel for those old Grindhouse films. Plenty of nudity, sex, violence, one liners, and cheese! Only for select audiences. I loved it. Most shocking of all was the killer...you'll have to watch to find that one out. Add it to your collection now! Also recommend ""Mad Cowgirl"" if you like this one.",1177286400,12,312,4.589285714285714
2737672,5,B000MNOXJO,"Wow....where do I even start? the above reviews have pretty much covered all the bases already, so I'll just add that if you're looking for a more accurate ""GRINDHOUSE"" experience, look no further. This movie is no doubt what Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino were shooting for with their GRINDHOUSE opus magnum. But whereas they both fell short (With Rodriguez's PLANET TERROR being the better of the two) PERVERT! hits the ball right out of the park. Big bare boobs, bouncing butts, and some pretty funny one liners make this a MUST HAVE for any fan of low budget cinema, or anyone who wants a softcore romp in the park. Mary Carey, in her role as Cheryl has NEVER looked better, and here she's joined by equally bouncy supporting players who know how to work their best assets.

RECOMMENDED.",1176768000,12,799,4.748201438848921
2737673,4,B000MNOXJO,"Roger Corman and Russ Meyer would be soooo proud!

And maybe even somewhat envious.

""Pervert!"" sort of perfects, all by itself, an entire genre of niche films from the 60s and 70s that were giddy, over-the-top romps of bad filmmaking, bad writing, bad acting, and - of course - bad taste.  Ridiculous amounts of gratuitous nudity, sex, violence and offensive humor ensue.

And for this film's target audience, who would want it any other way?

The reason I say this film almost perfects such low-grade, high-exploitation awfulness (read: greatness) is because I have seen a lot of movies that have attempted to do this, pretended to be this, but ultimately fail and up being something closer an 80s teen sex comedy along the lines of ""Revenge of the Nerds"" or one of those low budget ""Friday the 13th"" teen slasher movie spoofs.

Those films weren't all bad of course, but this one gets the spoofing of an entire era of like-films right.  And fearlessly doesn't hold back a thing.  The prudish need not apply.

""Pervert!"" is a 2006 film shot like it was made in the 70s, trying to look like it takes place in the 50s or 60s.  It is reminiscent of the beach blanket bimbo flicks from those decades, the grungy low-budget horror flicks of the 70s and the teen sexcapade flicks of the 80s.

Emphasis on the latter.  For the first three quarters of the film, I would wager there is not more than a span of three minutes where a naked female body part does not grace the screen (and by grace I mean front and center, gratuitous, for no reason whatsoever; like while simply driving a car - don't ask).

The first half hour is essentially a spoof of porn films, with real-life industry starlet Mary Carey, who obnoxiously ran for governor of California a few years back (!), in skimpy outfits (and just as much time spent without them at all), spouting truly bad dialog composed entirely of sexual-suggestivities, and doing all sorts of beyond-suggestive things with corn on the cob and homemade preserves.  For all her on-camera, drunken, public obnoxious rants in real life, Carey, though admittedly a bad actress (but hey, in this movie, the worse you are, the better you are) comes off as a rather sweet bimbo type.

Then the plot kicks in; something about a mysterious killer on the loose, which brings more scantily-clad starlets into the fray, basically to get naked and tote shotguns. Juliette Clarke has perhaps the most memorably fearless lone, mock sex scene in any film outside of actual porn.  The dialog going into the finale is absurdly hilarious, and the revelation of the killer - and the way he/she (don't ask) is brought to life is not only absurd and completely out of the realm of good taste, but is a salute to all that is so eye-popingly unholy about this type of junk food cinema.

""Pervert!"" really pushes things as far as possible. There is more shock value on this DVDs main menu selection screen than in probably any entire movie I have ever seen that slaps ""Unrated!  Too Extreme For Theatres,"" or what-have-you across the box.

I revel in that but, obviously, this will not be everyone's cup of tea; and nothing here is appropriate for children - Duh!  (Even though it does play to every adolescent male interest in the book.)

Consider yourself fairly warned.

Hollywood A-listers Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez are collaborating on ""Grindhouse,"" a throwback to the exploitation flicks of the 70s that were often shown as double features at drive-ins and seedy cinemas on the wrong side of the tracks (called grindhouses), and made outside of the rules and regulations of Hollywood.  These films specialized in over-the-top violence and sexuality in order to bring in an audience they could not otherwise get with their lack of starpower and Hollywood budgets and publicity.  RR and QT's film(s) hope to encapsulate the whole grindhouse-going experience by offering two films that are filmed with scratches and grain to look cheap and worn and adding fake trailers for equally over-the-top cult-type horror and action flicks that will separate the two feature films.

""Grindhouse"" will no doubt be far sharper and much more skilled in its presentation, but I would wager ""Pervert!"" is precisely the idea the guys are going for in terms of presenting grindhouse, exploitation, cult films from a bygone era to audiences of today.  ""Pervert!"" focuses more on sex, and absurd humor (it even includes BOING! and SQUISHHHHH sound effects), whereas ""Grindhouse"" looks to be going more for violent, adrenaline ride stuff.

Both are clever in their ambitions to pay homage to these types of films.  The main reason this movie even jumped out at me was because I was looking for some old school grindhouse films to check out before I saw the RR/QT film.  Everything right down to the DVD artwork makes this flick look like its straight out of the 70s.  But that's just part of its overall commitment to sell the gag that this is an homage to those flicks.  They did a good job with the film itself; if I didn't know better, I would be convinced this thing was made in the 70s (save for a few recent references).  If you ""get it,"" ""Pervert!"" is a ton of fun.

And if you are 14 years-old or a drunken college kid (or either at heart), you will most likely consider this to be one of the best movies you have ever seen.

This is one fake cult classic that deserves to become a real one.",1175040000,27,5407,4.710945802337938

The kills are satisfying, the comedy is so bad you have to laugh, and the boobs MAN LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT THE BOOBS. It stars a Porn Star what do you expect?",1388620800,,335,4.014925373134329

2737678,1,B000MNOXJO,"This movie is an abomination.  How they tried to cash in on Russ Meyer's greatness is despicable.  The film has nothing -- I repeat: nothing -- to do with Russ Meyer.  The actresses are over weight cellulite trash, the writing is abysmal, the direction is fourth rate.

I was looking forward to a true homage to Meyer and got vomit-producing junk.  I am convinced the ""good"" reviews were put there by people involved with the film, because no one in their right mind could think this waste of time was any good.

Please stay away.  You have been fore warned.",1316476800,,558,4.52
2737679,1,B000MNOXJO,This is a real waste of time.  The nudity does not save it.  Glad I just got it from netflix.,1309996800,2,93,3.6
2737680,1,B000MNOXJO,"A thorough look at the range of my reviews should readily demonstrate to one and all that I am no prude, so believe me when I say that Pervert has to be one of the lamest movies I have ever seen.  I had no trouble going with the flow for the first two-thirds of the movie - porn star Mary Carey isn't really my type, but I have no problem looking at her naked - but the final few scenes of this movie are well nigh unbearable and an insult to anyone possessing half a brain.  Any fondness I might have had for Pervert died the first time I saw the awful claymation, which only made the identity of the ""killer"" even more ridiculous than it already was.  Spare me the crap about the whole homage to 70s exploitation films or the coronation of director Jonathan Yudis as the next Russ Meyer - unless you're a horny fourteen-year-old boy or an inmate at some sex asylum, I don't see how you can enjoy anything about this film.

I know how appealing a low-budget horror flick like this can be, but Pervert just takes a good thing and runs it six feet into the ground.  I thought this movie would be good for some laughs, at the very least.  Alas, I was wrong - Pervert isn't good for anything at all.  It's going to take me weeks to restore all of the IQ points I lost watching this cinematic trash.",1293580800,6,1295,4.176706827309237
2737681,5,B000MNOXJO,"Well, maybe not ever, but it totally rocked...How can you NOT love a movie with boobs, sex and death?? The acting is just A+ and the props, such as the snake....CLASSIC!!! My husband and I laughed so hard! This is DEFINITELY one for B movie fans, and/or those fond of John Waters movies. If you're expecting a serious serial killer movie, do not rent Pervert! You will be hugely disappointed...Pervert is for those of us who really enjoy crappy movies...hahaha",1181433600,2,460,4.7625
2737682,5,B000MNOXJO,"There is not much more you can say about this movie other than those three words. There's sort of a plot, but not really. Mostly it is just the nudity to the point where it's really just straight degradation and you're almost wishing for a break from it, but no, not really, you love it. Then there's monsters and violence and rednecks which make it more fun because what good is nudity if there's not some insanity to go alongside it.

Who cares about the plot. It's ridiculous and nothing makes sense at all through the whole movie. But it's fun. And funny. And messy. And has nudity. You either love this sort of thing or you hate it, and Pervert's description perfectly prepares you for the adventure the film takes you on.",1180051200,6,727,4.466165413533835

8170373,1,B000MNOXJO,"I like the movie and had seen it before. The DVD showed up like it was supposed to. Cover looks legit but the disk is very generic with no info on it other than the word ""Pervert"". Looks like a home printed label. The disk would not play very well in 3 different players I own. All my other DVD's play well in them. I put in for a replacement and was sent one quickly. Sadly the same problem existed on the replacement. It makes me wonder if this copy is a bootleg copy.

8170378,5,B000MNOXJO,"This movie is alright. Mary Carey's acting is really bad but her boobs are super big, bouncy and real. There is a scene where she is bathing outside under some water falling. Wet, soapy boobs. Awesome. Most of the time, Mary Carey is wearing clothing that leaves little to the imagination. Not a bad thing at all. Those sun dresses flow over her voluptuous curves like you can imagine. And I imagine she is wearing nothing underneath. There is a girl-girl scene and in the extras and bonus material, the scene is longer and uncut. This movie is basically a parody of itself and of '70's exploitation films. One of my favorite scenes is of a penis with a mind of it's own, screwing some girl in the middle of the desert. The woman is hot. The acting is bland, the storyline is awful. But, Mary Carey's boobs.",1442188800,,807,4.45945945945946
