8208014,4,6304681445,"The concert itself was great. If you listened to the radio broadcast then you were able to hear the entire concert without the edits as is on this box-set. The performances by most of the acts were great and to see Jimmy  Page and Robert Plant playing in concert again was THE highlight of the  day. To hear them do ""Wearing and Tearing"" is fantastic. If you  are looking to get a copy of this show on video and can't get a hold of the  full show then this is for you. Paul McCartney's set was great to see, as  well as Pink Floyd's mind blowing set. Too bad Cliff Richard got invited to  this show, other than his cheesy performance it's a great set. There is so  much more that is not included on this , that hopefully the BBC or VH1 with  air the concert un-cut to celebrate it's ten year anniversary. But until  then pick this up and play it LOUD! It's great to have just for the  archives if not to listen to the greatest artists of rock together in one  concert.",946425600,5,968,4.150537634408602
