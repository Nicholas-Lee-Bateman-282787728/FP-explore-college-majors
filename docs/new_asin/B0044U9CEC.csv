4261538,2,B0044U9CEC,"The TV series Soldiers Of Fortune was a dim memory for me, remembering I saw a few episodes many years ago and just one scene where a ""native"" kid jumps into dangerous waters to snag a coin a tourist tossed in.  When I got the DVD set of the series, I watched the first episode, ""The Gaboon Viper.""  I couldn't believe how bad this episode was.  The producers spared every expense: shoddy sets, mismatched stock footage and plenty of talking.  How this show even made it to a second season is a surprise to me.

I have the Timeless Media DVD set of The Texan and the episodes on that set were in fine shape.  Not so Soldiers Of Fortune, where episodes I viewed on my computer monitor had bad decomposition on the edge of the film frame.  That problem can be fixed by cropping the bad parts out digitally, something pretty easy to do.  The problem with the soft image on some of the episodes is harder to fix, since these episodes seems to have come from a bad VHS recording of the show.

Impossible to fix were the abysmal scripts that series stars John Russell and Chick Chandler were stuck with.  Awful does not begin to describe how poorly written this show was.  Even if the episodes on this DVD were in pristine condition, I would have been disappointed with watching Soldiers Of Fortune.  The bootleg quality of the video was bad enough that I gave up watching these DVDs after a few episodes.",1306972800,4,1399,4.421875
4261539,3,B0044U9CEC,"Low budget show, we bought it because the ""Lawman"" was a co-star on this series. We were disappointed, although a few of the episodes were OK.",1303257600,2,142,4.5
4261540,5,B0044U9CEC,"One of the vague memories of television shows I had in the late '50s was of Soldiers of Fortune. Half hour adventure shows were popular then, and this was one of the best. John Russell starred as Time Kelly and Chick Chandler as Toubo Smith traveled around the world each week with adventures ranging from building a tunnel in Cuba to searching for missing people in the jungle.

This is a five disc set, and the episodes appear in the same order as they originally appeared on TV.  There are a few audio and video imperfections,but otherwise the quality of the DVD's is very good. It is fun watching these old shows, and there are some interesting twists in the stories. I highly recommend this series.

Was this review helpful to you?",1302566400,5,736,4.5606060606060606
4261541,5,B0044U9CEC,"I was only a toddler when this series was on the air but my Mother always talked about the series.  When it came out on dvd, I bought it for my Mother.  I finally got to watch the series and it is a really good adventure series.  John Russell is the handsome hero and his sidekick is always there to help out and throw in his advice.  I am glad I had the opportunity to see the series.",1301270400,6,385,3.8974358974358974
4261542,5,B0044U9CEC,"This was my childhood's all time favorite tv series and, although it had a short run, I waited excitedly for each new episode of the ""Soldiers of Fortune"" which ran during 1955-56. There are some technical problems with images and sounds at times but the reconstructed episodes seem to impact me as they did when I was but a small boy. So here I am, a lifetime away connecting to my childhood spent growing up on the beaches of Panama City and Tyndall Field AFB, Florida. I am back there, my parents, now long gone, are youthful and full of life, again. Life is good when you are a child if family is important; it was. While some of the dialog is perhaps silly and the action amateurish, it is the era before today's extensive special effects. I find myself engrossed as before. It's sad to think that co-star John Russell, athletic and handsome then, died of emphasema, some years ago. I watch his character lite up a cigarrette and feel the urge to warm him not to do that, knowing that that is what took the lives of both of my parents when they were too young. Does this review help a prospective buyer make ""Soldiers of Fortune"" a purchase? I suspect not for one needed to be a boy in the mid50s to appreciate this series. In my experience, it was a meeting of the child within  reaching out to the innocent boy I was so long ago. How many experiences allow one to do that?  For me, ""Soldiers of Fortune"" is so much more than just a short lived tv series, I was allowed to be the boy who loved this series so long ago and that made everything worth well.",1298678400,45,1560,4.302721088435374
4261543,5,B0044U9CEC,"in exotic locales around the world. And it definitely stands up today. I give this DVD, exquisitely reproduced in crystal clarity, my highest recommendation. Don't pass this one by!",1296864000,8,181,5.275862068965517
4261544,4,B0044U9CEC,"Well ,this is one series I never expected to turn up on DVD so all credit to Timeless Media for resurrecting it.

Back in the 50's,television was awash with various 30 min.action/adventure series. Tough cops,private eyes & cowboys in abundance & 'Soldiers of Fortune' sits right alongside these.

John Russell (before his stint on the long running 'Lawman') stars as Tim Kelly & Chick Chandler as his curiously named partner'Toubo' Smith.

If you fancied hacking through the jungle in search of lost tribes,building a pipeline across the desert,infiltrating gangs of smugglers or searching for buried treasure then Tim & Toubo were your men. This occupation took them to all the remote corners of the world, represented here by armloads of stock footage which also included earthquakes & erupting volcanos.

If you are looking for deep,meaningful plots & state of the art graphics then this series is not for you. On the other hand if you enjoy old 'B' movies & are prepared to suspend your disbelief for half an hour then I am sure you will be entertained by 'Soldiers of Fortune'.

All 52 episodes are presented here on 5 discs housed in 3 slimline cases. I don't know where Timeless sourced the prints (probably old 16mm) & no remastering appears to have been done. There is evidence of print damage & 'wobble' at times & Timeless have noted this in announcements prior to some segments. Sound is generally OK. Possibly best viewed on smaller screens. They are however, superior to the few 'gray' copies which have been circulating amongst collectors for a while.

I found the series a lot of fun & if you like early TV you probably will as well.",1296000000,50,1649,4.809187279151944

4261556,4,B0044U9CEC,"I had never seen this show before, but it's nostalgic and entertaining.  I would say it targeted young teenagers during its time.  A lot of stock footage from around the world coupled with back lot filming.  Acting, plots, dialogue is excellent.  Huge amount of episodes and the quality is decent.  Too bad there are no real extras to go along with this: commercials for the series, cast interviews, writer narrations, toy spin off documentaries, actor career reviews (not just a few paragraphs typed in ie 1980s tech), etc  Anyway, I liked it.",1408060800,,544,4.858695652173913
4261557,5,B0044U9CEC,"Great old forgotten Universal series at a great price. Low budget and fun to watch little stories done before John Russell did Warner Brothers' Lawman, which had a bigger budget and better stories with better lessons to be learned. Russell is a little more fun loving, and cheerful in this than he was as Marshal Dan Troop. Good to see Chick Chandler again. He makes a great sidekick. Mercifully short shows without the commercials padding them out to 30 minutes. Some of them feel like the endings were a bit rushed to fit the time slot. Tim and Toubo apparently charge large fees but always seem broke. Not much of a fortune is in evidence. You don't see them living high and blowing their money. Their jobs must be far between. The DVD package and discs don't pull any punches about saying ""from best possible sources..."" but it is probably better quality than most tv owners could have seen back then anyway. There are some surprises guest-star wise with actors that are better known now. (Frances ""Aunt Bea"" Bavier, Aaron Spelling, Andy Clyde, John Doucette, Jean Byron, Beverly Garland, Claude Akins, etc.) Good direction moves the plots right along. This series travels the world but never leaves the back lot and the usual locations such as Iverson Ranch, Republic cave and other familiar Los Angeles spots that pass for many different countries and continents.",1406678400,2,1369,4.854700854700854

4261559,4,B0044U9CEC,"A series with bad sets, bad action, bad scripts, bad costumes, bad acting and likely a very low budget.  But, a great show to fall asleep to or put on while playing on the computer or reading a book.  Basically, the show revolves around two, always broke adventurers.  Somehow, I never did figure out how, or why, they are recruited for adventures worldwide.  One minute they are working on a dock for a meal and the next minute rescuing, finding treasure or doing something heroic. John Russell did this show before he did the Lawman series.  Chick Chandler plays his angry sidekick.  This is a DVD that sits in the DVD player and as you do other things and sit down again you eventually see the complete episode.  As bad as the show is I still like it more than today's TV.  I never heard of it before either.  If you like great production or great plots this is not for you.  If you like passing the time it's not that bad.",1386115200,,926,4.3313953488372094

4261561,2,B0044U9CEC,"There are disclaimers about bad audio and video but the only really ""bad"" are the pieces of stock footage and footage borrowed from earlier films. The most frequent writer was Fenton Earnshaw who wrote ""Biff Baker,"" ""State Trooper,"" ""77 Sunset Strip"" and the like. The plots creak, the attempt to cover the world gets to be more trouble than it's worth. The acting is not that bad. It is better than Terry and the Pirates, Whirlybirds, Crunch and Des. Not as good as Highway Patrol. Guest ""stars"" like Michael Ansara, Alan Napier, Edward Platt. The boys are up for anything. Whaling, chess, looking for lost treasure in an old house, and the usual lions and tigers and bears etc. 1955-56. Helping the French stamp out rebellion in Vietnam seems like a VERY long time ago.",1380672000,,771,4.718518518518518

The video quality is what you would expect from this early adventure series and the audio is not far beyond in it's quality.

Fortunately ""Laramie"" will be released next year (the remaining seasons) and everybody can get a message from amazon.com now once ""Bronco"" with Ty Hardin will be available.

On my DVD wish list is still a lot of the classic TV series that's unavailable:
1. Kentucky Jones (Dennis Weaver)
2. The Farmer's Daughter (Inger Stevens)
3. Bourbon Street Beat (Richard Long)
4. 77 Sunset Strip (Efrem Zimbalist Jr)
5. the first 4 seasons of ""Lassie"" with Tommy Rettig aka Jeff (ca. 116 episodes)
6. Adventures of the Seaspray (Australian TV series from 1965)
7. The Magic Boomerang (Australian TV series from the sixties)
8. The Detectives...please all 98 episodes (a few episodes are now available via amazon.de) (Robert Taylor)
9. Yancy Derringer (please all 34 episodes) (Jock Mahoney) would be worth a restoration!
10. He and She (Paula Prentiss)
11. Rin Tin Tin (the TV series from the fifties)
12. SOS Charterboat (Ty Hardin)
13. Hank (Dick Kallman)
14. last, but not the least: ""Sea Hunt"" (unfortunately you can only get bootleg copies so far) which is still a very compelling TV series nowadays",1324252800,3,1340,4.898678414096916
4261574,3,B0044U9CEC,"The good folks at Timeless Media Group (TMG) bring you Soldiers of Fortune (1955-57), a half hour television program that ran for two seasons, and produced a total of 52 episodes.  The series features John Russell as Tim Kelly, and Chick Chandler as Toubo Smith, expert hunters, guides, and adventurers, who are available for hire, to go wherever there is mystery, danger, or perhaps a buck to be made.

The partners have no set base of operations, and the unpredictability helps make the program interesting, as their adventures take them to some of the far corners of the world, to engage in a variety of tasks.  They could be hiking through the jungle, out at sea, acting as guides, on safari, blazing a trail, on a rescue mission, or looking for some missing person.

Kelly and Chandler get along well enough, but there's not a lot of personal warmth in their relationship.  Both men are rather reserved, and bring a mostly businesslike attitude to what they do.  More imposing physically, Kelly usually takes the lead in the decision making.  Chandler and Kelly may not be the smoothest most charismatic guys, but they are pretty savvy, and mostly dependable in tough situations.  Although they do get into scuffles, fatalities are rare.  They usually handle situations on their own terms, without law enforcement getting involved.

The quality of the stories varies quite a bit.  Some of the adventures feature fresh situations and ideas, while others seem well-worn or clichd.  Obviously to save costs, the program makes use of various kinds of stock footage for locations, backgrounds, or to feature wild animals.  This technique doesn't always work too well, and sometimes produces some amusing results.  While kind of a mixed bag, the program could be a hidden gem, for those into adventure programs from the 1950's.

TMG's releases are usually high quality (Coronado 9 is a fine example), but unfortunately, the image quality of Soldiers Of Fortune is fair at best, as the source material has apparently deteriorated over the years.  Although there is often some softness, and some dirty or damaged areas, the program is still certainly watchable.  The 52 episodes are divided between five discs, and total to about 22 hours of viewing time.  A `play all' option on the menu would be nice, rather than constantly having to return and select the episode you want to see.",1311465600,19,2380,4.952141057934509
4261575,5,B0044U9CEC,I enjoyed the series of shows with Tim Kelley and Tobou Smith.  I watched the shows back in the fifties and thought they were very exotic in terms of settings and plots.  I was very happy to see them once more and found them very interesting for the world view that they had for the fifties.  Good stuff.,1309996800,5,304,4.206896551724138
4261576,4,B0044U9CEC,"A young boy in the mid-fifties, there were only two ""can't miss"" tv shows on the airwaves- one was ""Dragnet"" and the other was ""Soldiers of Fortune"".  My favorite episodes were ""Aloha Means Goodbye"" and ""The General"".  To this day, I don't not know why I remember these particular episodes or why I loved the series so much.  I ordered this DVD for nostalgia reasons and although it is very juvenile and just plain silly at times, I have watched all 52 episodes and enjoyed each one almost as much as I did 55 years ago.  I guess some of us ol' boys never truly grow up.

  John Russell was always one of my favorite supporting character actors.  He is light and affable in this series, unlike his heavier portrayal of Dan Troop on the ""Lawman"" series and his numerous ""bad guy"" roles (recall Nathan Burdett, brother of Joe- played by the great Claude Akins) on the big screen.  I don't remember Chick Chandler being in any other series but he does a good job as the comical sidekick.

  The episodes last between 24 and 25 minutes giving an indication of how few 7-UP commercials we had to endure back in the fifties. A 30 minute show these days contains about 15 minutes of actual program.

  I doubt you'd care for this DVD unless you were a kid between 8 and 18 in 1955.",1309392000,13,1274,4.384615384615385

John Russell, who would go on to Lawman and Chick Chandler, a veteran character actor who complemented Russell well are the two Soldiers of Fortune. They roam the world as White Hunters and adventurers. Even then, there is a environmental aura to their actions.
