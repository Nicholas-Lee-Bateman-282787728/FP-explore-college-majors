8322628,2,B001MZUWZU,"Championship creates a dvd with a big name coach, but fails to deliver anything worth while for coaches wanting to implement or use the shuffle offense.  Coach Smith's thoughts are scattered and he assumes way too much for coaches to use what he uses.  Basically he shows the first few passes of the Shuffle and then UNC would go into their passing game offense, so I fail to see how this entire video is on the Shuffle Offense.  Also, like my other championship dvd's, the quality of the dvd is not good.  The screen turns black and white every ten seconds.  It is quite annoying, but nothing compared to Coach Smith mummbling while he tries to teach.  I love Coach Smith but was very disappointed with this dvd.",1231113600,,713,4.53125
