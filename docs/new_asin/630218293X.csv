Many noir films deal indirectly with the effects of war on protagonists' psychology, the complicated intrigues that govern life from behind the scenes, etc.  This movie makes all the connections explicitly, but without being pedantic--part spy thriller, part detective story, with an excellent cast, cinematography, and sound design.  Really a must-see.",1274140800,4,407,5.639344262295082

441484,5,630218293X,"This is one of John Garfield's most unheralded films, in my opinion, mostly because it has been nearly impossible to see or obtain for many years. VHS copies were rare and highly-priced, bootleg copies were hard to come by, and it was rarely shown on TV or in theaters. Recently, it was made available through the Warner Vault series, and this is a really good thing for Garfield fans. In it, Garfield plays an American who had fought with the Spanish against the Nazis, was captured and then tortured and brain-washed while being held. It is plain to see he is extremely traumatized, and the film is a very accurate portrayal of PTSD in the clinical sense.

But it is first and foremost an impassioned and suspenseful war-time drama that explores the meaning of loyalty and integrity, and the need to confront and eradicate evil. Parallels between these themes are drawn in the realms of friendship, family ties, romance, and partiotism, and in this sense the film is rather complex. Still, it never stops being entertaining and engrossing. The performances by Garfield and Maureen O' Hara are solid, taut, and highly energized; I think they call it ""chemistry"" and there is plenty of it. Walter Slezak is perfectly despicable as the amiable villain. The film has some proto-noirish overtones in its use of voice-over narration and the evocation of nightmarish inner states, but still falls strongly in the realm of a war-time thriller, and would make a great double bill with something like 13 Rue Madeleine. It's just so satisfying when Nazis bite the dust!  Would that we had that kind of clarity in today's world!!!

My only suggestion to the potential buyer is to look at the TCM website for much better pricing (under $20) than can be currently found on Amazon. But if you want to make your life easy, and just want to see a great Garfield film ASAP, click away and let this sparrow flutter on in...",1254268800,22,1906,4.75226586102719
441485,4,630218293X,"RKO masterfully and faithfully adapted the 1943 movie version of Dorothy B. Hughes's novel THE FALLEN SPARROW (TFS), condensing the novel without watering it down. The film brings us into the mindset of troubled yet determined hero John ""Kit"" McKittrick (John Garfield). Kit's boyhood friend Louie had helped him escape the Spanish prison where he'd been tortured for two agonizing years after the Spanish Civil War. Back in New York City, Kit's stunned to discover Louie's been killed in a 12-story fall from a window at a party for wartime refugees Dr. Skaas (Walter Slezak) and his nephew Otto (Hugh Beaumont, pre-LEAVE IT TO BEAVER). Hell bent on proving Louie's death was neither accidental nor a suicide, Kit starts sleuthing. His grim goal: killing Louie's killer.

Kit's suspects include the women in his upscale circle. Was it Kit's alluring old flame Barby Taviton (Patricia Morison)? Lovely, sad-eyed refugee Toni Donne (Maureen O'Hara)? Songbird Whitney Parker (appealing Martha O'Driscoll. By the way, this character's name was ""Content Hamilton"" in the novel)? Kit's biggest obstacle: he has what we now call Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, haunted by the memory of the mysterious limping man who tortured Kit in his dark cell, trying to make him reveal where he'd hidden his regiment's battle standard. Kit imagines hearing the drag and thump that signaled his sadistic tormentor's arrival -- or IS he imagining it? Terror mounts as Kit realizes his enemies may have followed him home, maybe even planting their spies into every aspect of Kit's life, placing not only himself in danger, but also his friends and loved ones...

The role of Kit, a working-class, self-described ""mug"" in gent's clothing with a heart full of all-but-shattered ideals, fits John Garfield like a glove. Garfield's toughness, tenderness, and humor have us rooting for Kit. As Toni Donne, the guarded beauty with a terrible hold over her, lovely Maureen O'Hara is an unexpectedly effective femme fatale, conveying Toni's inner fear and regret in her poignant, soulful portrayal, winning my sympathy. O'Hara has great chemistry with Garfield. Walter Slezak's performance as Dr. Skaas is silkily sinister, though his true evil nature is telegraphed earlier than in the book, with his interest in ""the cruelties of men towards other men"" and ""comparing modern scientific torture with the methods of the ancients."" TFS keeps the paranoia percolating and the suspense simmering, even keeping much of the novel's best dialogue. Today's audiences might not understand Kit's obsession with the battle flag, even with the explanatory scene at Toni's home -- but then again, I bet the men and women fighting overseas will get the significance of a battle standard and what it symbolizes.",1223078400,17,2768,5.246049661399549
441486,5,630218293X,"Dorothy Hughes' best selling suspense novel translated into one of the best early film noir movies made. In a role originally offered to Jimmy Cagney, Garfield hit a magnificent major chord of acting. In an era before visual flashbacks of the mind, Garfield's voice-over and facial expressions nail a psychiatric basket-case destroyed by torture at the hands of the German secret police during the Spainsh Civil War. The plot is a little dated, but Maureen O'Hara gives one of her best performance and Walter Slezak is a great villian, oozing EVIL from every pore..",1202256000,9,565,5.0212765957446805

If you get tired of seeing women wearing rags, and walking around staring into their iPhone, this is the movie for you. Here, you will find beautiful women, wearing beautiful clothes.  For the most part, this is now gone in our modern age.

7822920,1,630218293X,"John Garfield, Maureen O'Sullivan, Walter Slazak- what a lot of talent, wasted! Like the 'fixed' drink offered to Garfield by the bad guy near the end of the film, this is a movie that the seasoned film watcher approaches for the first time with considerable interest, but is disappointed by almost every aspect of the movie.
Who are what's at fault? Macroscopically it's the plot. Someone is after someone to get something from him. The Nazis are thrown into the stew to spicin' it up. This is a talking movie and boy do the characters talk, but that's about all they do: the narrative is advanced by preciously little action. Then there is the dialogue. Dialogue can be one of the most deciding factors in making the film either great or fall flat. Along with good acting and direction, in Bogart's 'The Big Sleep' it catapulted a confused story into a minor masterpiece. Here, the dialogue is limp, neither clever nor convincing. As for the acting, I'd like to say that the three principals struggle to make the film work, but I find them patently unconvinced that they are making a worthwhile movie. Garfield makes a lot of faces in the cloase ups that I guess is supposed to make up for not saying anything that makes sense, while the others read their lines like a shopping list for most of the film.
Usually the fault of a bad film has to be laid at the feet of the director and I think that is the case here, although it must be admitted that he could only do so much about a man being chased by a the bad guy with a limp which he hears but doesn't see until the 'surprising' revelation near the end of the film that it is Maureen O'Hara's kindly old grandfather.
In short, this film was a waste of time for the actors and a waste of time for this viewer. Warning: Don't waste your time, too!",1360627200,,1800,4.408408408408408
7822921,5,630218293X,"This is one of the lesser entries in the Spanish Civil War films.  What makes it really worthwhile (and keeps the whole thing afloat) is the well directed (by Richard Wallace) 'film noir' atmosphere that pervades the entire project.  It's always good to see John Garfield, the beautiful Maureen O'Hara and, of course, Walter Slezak revel in the nasty goings-on, involving some slick under cover Nazis. The supporting players (including a pre 'Kiss Me Kate' Patricia Morrison ...who knew?) are excellent.  The plot may be a little vague and pay off may not be that all that great but this is a fun, dark film to watch, if only for the performers.  The black and white print isn't the sharpest quality (even on DVD) but perfectly acceptable.",1353456000,5,739,4.7952755905511815
7822922,4,630218293X,"""The Fallen Sparrow"" is based on a bestselling novel by Dorothy Hughes. A former POW from the Spanish Civil War (John Garfield) returns to New York in 1940 to find the killer of his lifelong friend, and in the process he stumbles upon a Nazi spy ring and is stalked by the man who conducted his torture sessions.

The film stars ruggedly handsome John Garfield (1913-52), the original ""method"" actor. Garfield made his screen debut in 1938 with the popular ""Four Daughters"" for which he received his first Best Supporting  Actor nomination (he got his second in 1947 for ""Body and Soul""), and ""They Made me a Criminal"" (1939) propelled him into the A list. He's best known for ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" (1946). Blacklisted in the communist scare of the early 50s, his career was cut short, and he died in 1952 at age 39. This film comes at the height of his popularity and it was his chance to show a wider range of acting skill, which he does.

Maureen O'Hara (1920) plays the granddaughter of a French nobleman who appears to be part of a Nazi spy ring. Early on she lit up the screen at 19 as Esmeralda in ""Hunchback of Notre Dame"" (1939). She could play comedy (""Miracle on 34th Street in 1947), or action (""Bagdad"" in 1949), but perhaps is best known for  the 5 films she did with John Wayne - ""Rio Grande"" (1950), ""The Quiet Man"" (1952), ""Big Jake"" (1971), ""McClintock"" (1963), and ""Wings of Eagles"" (1957). O'Hara does her usual good job.

Walter Slezak (1902-83) plays a sinister character who is interested in torture. Slezak was a great character actor who appeared in more than 50 films, often as a villain (e.g., ""Lifeboat"", ""Born to Kill"") but he did well in comedies (e.g., ""The Pirate"", ""The Inspector General"") and musicals  and won a Tony for ""Fanny"" (1955).

Martha O'Driscoll (1922-98) plays a friend of Garfield. Her good looks and great singing voice helped her through three dozen films between 1936 and 1946 after which she married a rich businessman

Richard Wallace (1894-1951) directs. Wallace was best known for his work with female actors and he made 3 films with Shirley Temple.  He was a versatile director and among his more than 60 films are ""Sinbad the Sailor"" (1947) and ""Bombadier"" (1943).

This was his last film as an editor for Robert Wise (1914-2005) who is best known as the director of the Oscar winning musicals ""West Side Story"" (1961) and ""Sound of Music"" (1965). Just prior to this film he worked as an editor for Orson Welles on ""The Magnificent Ambersons"" (1942) and while Welles was overseas Wise reduced it to 88 minutes. Welles said it had been edited ""by a lawnmower"".

The musical score from Roy Webb (1888-1982) is excellent, a great example of how music can supplement the story without imposing. Webb is best known from his work with Val Lewton, though he worked on more than 200 films and was nominated for an Oscar 6 times between 1938 and 1946. He was nominated for an Oscar for his work on this film.

1943 was an OK year in films - The top grossing films included ""This is the Army"", ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"", ""Song of Bernadette"", ""Coney Island"", and ""Stage Door Canteen"". Other notables included ""The Ox Bow Incident"". The big Oscar winner was ""Going My Way"", and other winners included ""Gaslight"" and ""None But the Lonely Heart""

War films were particularly popular - ""Action in the North Atlantic"" with Bogart and Raymond Massey, ""Air Force"" with John Garfield, ""Bataan"" with Robert Taylor and Lloyd Nolan, ""Bombadier"" with Pat O'Brien and Randolph Scott, ""Corvette K-255"" with Randolph Scott, ""Five Graves to Cairo"" with Franchet Tone and Anne Baxter"", ""Hangmen Also Die"" with Brian Donlevy and Walter Brennan, and ""Hitler's Children.""

The NY Times called it ""a strange and restless melodrama... far-from-flawless"" yet also an ""uncommon and provocatively handled melodrama"". Garfield was praised for a ""taut performance"" and Wallace ""has used both soundtrack and camera to suggest the stresses upon the volunteer's fear-drenched mind.""

Bottom line - a compelling drama.",1340928000,4,4044,4.815295815295816
