8421341,5,B004B3AH8W,"It appears both productions in the DVD are the Australian equivalent of Public Television in the USA.  Both movies are excellent for family viewing.  Often it is forgotten in the past, military service was required of young boys even at the age of 14 years old in some
countries, and our Nation was no exception.  Boy Soldiers are not a new subject, including conscientious objectors (COs).  Some
COs refused to carry a gun, but were highly decorated for heroism as medics and male nurses.  Boy Soldiers reminds the viewers not to be dogmatic about this subject.  On the lighter side is the humor of the movie, His Masters Ghost.  An Australian School for
young men and girls of Middle School and High School Ages is the theme of this movie.  Due to the outback and remoteness, it is
not unusual in a country like Australia for boys and girls to be sent to a boarding school setting.  Simon Grey is an outstanding actor for a young boy, and he as well as other students as players in a school symphony on a Summer outing, learn to achieve their potential with the help of His Master's Ghost who lives in the Mansion where they stay.  Another excellent family movie to learn about youth in another culture and country.",1385337600,,1217,4.566820276497696
8421342,1,B004B3AH8W,This was the  most boring movie I have ever purchased.  My kids did not last five minutes in watching it.  Not worth the money.,1365292800,,127,4.208333333333333
