The film is packed with wonderfully vivid artwork, interviews, stories, and discussions on a range of art, entertainment, spirituality, and metaphysical elements. Also gives us a very intimate look at the artist, his story, and the creative process.

It would be a disservice NOT to see this film! 5 Stars!",1459900800,,576,4.637254901960785

7565537,5,B01994IW9S,"""Chet Zar: I Like to Paint Monsters"" (2016 03 08)
NRG Creations, Happy Cloud Productions, 80 mins

""Enter the dark and foreboding world of Chet Zar..."" (see product description^)

ILTPM features the humanity/artwork of an ever-evolving human/artist (with respects to an ever-evolving 'Dark Art' scene).  Panning creativity (like gold) from insight (and deeper insights still from that), director Mike Correll pivots the entire thesis of his documentary on the Joseph Campbell adage to 'follow your bliss'.  ""...To Paint Monsters"" is Chet Zar's bliss; and how apparent and awe-inspiring a bliss it is!  The documentary, therefore, as with Chet Zar's artwork, is itself an invitation for others to take a similar leap of faith, to 'follow your (own) bliss'.  Organic, personal, vulnerable, emotional, intimate, therapeutic, meditative, spiritual ...and, most of all, important.  The placement of Zar's artwork - against the backdrop of music, words, and recollections - is not only intentional but incredibly effective, correlating perfectly with the film's overall mood/feeling.  ""Chet Zar: I Like to Paint Monsters"", however, is far more than just a visual invitation into worlds of monstrous realms (see: Dy5topia).  As Chet Zar notes, ""[It is] not just horror stuff ...[it has] elements of mystery & magick.  To me, 'dark' doesn't mean 'evil' necessarily.""

5 of 5, that dvd cover alone...
But seriously, everything about this... get it.

Damien Echols: ""It's like the poet Ogden Nash said, ""Where there's a monster, there's a miracle"". The word 'monster' itself comes from the latin word [monstrum, monere] which means 'to show forth, or to reveal' [an overseer's divine omen, warning, reminder, portent, admonishment, instruction, guidance, teaching, sign, advisement, etc]. So I think some people instinctively know, on some level, that when you're seeing a monster you're seeing divinity at work ...and other people can't see it at all, and even ...kinda get offended and outraged by it.""",1461110400,,2706,5.489156626506024
7565538,5,B01994IW9S,This is one of the best documentary out there. To look inside the mind of Chet Zar and what he has done for the dark surrealism art community. It is one to watch to help further understand the misconception of the world of dark art.,1461110400,,232,4.177777777777778
7565539,5,B01994IW9S,"I love Chet Zar's work, and story. The creatures are not only entertaining in their individual demeanors, but also in my opinion darling, and his style of art is very inspiring to any fan of macabre goodness!",1460937600,,208,4.648648648648648
7565540,5,B01994IW9S,"I assumed this would be a cool movie about cool art. I was wrong. What i got was a movie that indeed covered Chet's artistic output but this is an emotional, mental and spiritual journey.  Paralleling Chets' evolution as a painter and human being is pretty gripping storytelling and kudos to first time director Mike Correll for making this so much more than a movie about cool art.  Even if it did take forever to get my Kickstarter rewards.  #ohsnap",1460937600,4,451,4.6125
7565541,5,B01994IW9S,"I have been a long time fan of Chet's, and have been lucky enough to acquire an original sculpture and painting, as well as numerous prints and a couple of his production sculptures.

I had been dying to watch this documentary, and just a few weeks ago I ordered from Amazon and watched as soon as it arrived.

It gives so much background about Chet growing up and really shows you where his inspiration for his art comes from. I enjoyed every minute of it and learned a lot of new things about Chet that I didn't already know.  What was reconfirmed is how humble and nice of a person Chet is.

The documentary was very well put together and it had high production value.  Even the cover is a piece of art that looks so cool on my shelf!  Easy 5 stars.",1460851200,3,752,4.223776223776224

8744428,5,B01994IW9S,"Great biopic of dark artist extraordinaire, Chet Zar. Very interesting journey into the artist's origins and source material that inspires his art, revealing a humble and talented individual who has followed his passion and succeeded in living his dreams. A very inspirational journey for other artists or creatives, especially those of a dark persuasion. My only quibble is that his techniques and processes in creating his art - especially his oil paintings - were not really detailed in great length. As an artist myself I would love to know how he created EVERY painting, but of course there would not be enough time to do that as he is very prolific and, hey, I guess something needs to be left to the imagination right? A very good documentary and one that I would recommend highly. Buy a copy now.",1496448000,,804,4.7913669064748206

8744430,5,B01994IW9S,"The most amazing DVD I own. This gives you a first hand look into the mind of a multi-faceted genius.
His story is one that you may relate to, as I felt I was in his shoes through personal struggles, to coping, creating, and becoming a Warrior.
I find the desire to watch my DVD multiple times, and discover things I missed. This shares the evolution of my friend, Chet Zar.
Purchase your own, and I guarantee you will not be disappointed.

8744431,5,B01994IW9S,"What if I told you that Rembrandt was reincarnated, but now he paints monsters?  Well he was, and his name is Chet Zar.  One of the MOST important artists of our time brought into the light for us to examine a little closer.  What a remarkable journey he has had, so inspiring!  This film will leave you hugging those around you and appreciating all the little things that make us special.  Beautifully compiled, compelling story even if you are not into monsters or even art!  Chet is the embodiment of do what you love, a real role model for passionate people & artists alike.",1469491200,,578,4.509615384615385
8744432,5,B01994IW9S,"Chet Zar is an amazing artist I own one of his prints and hopefully will own one of his original oil paintings soon. Ive followed his art for many many years. I first became a tattoo artist back in the late 90s, and seems like his art was always present in the subconscious of the tattoo world.

ANYWAYS, FIVE STARS! EVEN IF YOU'RE NEW TO MR. ZAR.  YOU WILL ENJOY THIS!!!",1468800000,,371,4.211267605633803
8744433,5,B01994IW9S,"I've been a fan of Chet Zars work for many years, but didn't know much
about the man behind the monsters. This documentary provides insight
into how and why Chet paints what he paints. I think the mark of a good
documentary is one that transcends the subject matter and tells a great
human story, ILTPM has this in spades. I watched it with my partner
(who has no interest in dark art) and she found it very informative,
heartwarming but most of all entertaining (Also probably doesn't hurt she has the hots for bearded, slightly chubby guys ;). If your an artist (of any
discipline) trying to ""make it"" this movie is an inspiring must watch.
It shows that if you have an unstoppable work ethic, talent and drive to succeed then you might just be able to paint for a living.  My favorite parts are the bits where Chet is painting, and thankfully
the DVD provides some little time lapse videos that just show him
working. Now if only Netflix would sign these guys up to make a Bob
Ross style series ""The joy of painting monsters"", then my life would be
complete.",1468713600,,1061,4.441025641025641
8744434,5,B01994IW9S,"I suspected this documentary would be excellent, but it was much more than that.  It was life changing, Chet Zar is an amazing artist with an amazing outlook on life. Everyone should watch this documentary.",1468540800,,206,4.885714285714286
8744435,5,B01994IW9S,"Humble, loving, caring and funny. Not what you expect from a painter of mon5ters, though that is what makes Chet Zar Chet Zar. I loved following Chet's journey and delving into his world of mon5ters. You can feel the emotion that has been captured in this film. Most enjoyable and definitely inspiring.  5/5

8744436,5,B01994IW9S,I had anticipated the release of this documentary for quite sometime.  As a long time fan of Chets I really appreciated the thoughtfulness that went into making this film.  An intimate look at at Chets world and the amazing work he does.  Even a dark artist can have a soul filled with light.  Looking forward to many more years of following the evolution of a very talented artist and relatable human.,1468368000,,402,4.619718309859155
8744437,5,B01994IW9S,"Outstanding artist with a compelling story. Met Chet at Monster Palooza in Pasadena and was totally impressed with how down to earth and genuinely kind he was.
I purchased his book which he signed with a nice drawing of a skull!
Fantastic artist and person.",1467849600,,257,4.733333333333333
