7986498,3,B00008R9L5,Movie was pretty good and had a good story line was worth watching the ending really had a twist to it.,1284768000,,103,3.9523809523809526
7986499,4,B00008R9L5,Good film but follows similar storyline and ideas as I know what you did last summer. You know _the guy with mask killing people one by one. Exact same almost.,1183766400,,159,4.333333333333333
7986500,3,B00008R9L5,"THIS SLASHER FILM HAS A LOT OF SEXY WOMEN IN IT.

THE PLOT IS NOT TOO GOOD AND IT IS VERY LOW BUDGET.

LOTS OF 'EYE CANDY'.",1153180800,,123,3.5185185185185186
7986501,1,B00008R9L5,"Mediocre acting, dumb script larded with implausibilities and outright idiocies. A vague knock-off from ""I Know What You Did Last Summer."" There were two or three scarey moments, but you had to wade through a sea of yawning half-absurd story-telling to get at them. A one star disappointment. I had to struggle to keep awake during it",1084665600,,334,4.87719298245614
7986502,2,B00008R9L5,This movie is a typical horror movie/teenage slasher flick starring the wonderful Jeff Fahey. It is actually one of the more watchable movies he has recently made. If you like Jeff (he is really nice looking in this one) and/or typical horror movies with an ending screaming for a sequel you'll like this one.,1055635200,,309,4.7407407407407405
