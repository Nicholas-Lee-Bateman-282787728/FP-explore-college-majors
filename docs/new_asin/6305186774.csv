1006309,1,6305186774,"I liked the other Eisenstein movies that I've watched.  Alexander Nevsky is a classic and would probably be more of a classic if it were American.  Battleship Potemkin is pretty good and has some stuff that gets ripped off by Hollywood.  So I thought I would give this one a try.

I really wanted to like this movie.  It's about the Russian Revolution but for me it lays things on a little too thick.  I could only get to about half way through the movie (as the horse is hanging off the bridge is where I stop).  Excellent cinematography and music but I couldn't watch more of it.  Way too thick for me.",1167004800,2,604,4.283185840707965
1006310,4,6305186774,"October is a re-telling of the events of the Russian revolution. However, it was commissioned as a propoganda piece so that the only ""character"" that stands out is Lenin, who, of course is idolized. There are the populace and soldiers who are on the side of the Bolsheviks but they are basically nameless and faceless as is the other side (mensheviks). However, its not the plot that makes the movie fascinating but the use of montage and imagery, sometimes dizzying. Not quite as good as Battleship Potemkin but still fascinating. Certainly, not as morally disturbing as Triumph of the Will (which it influenced) but still, a film made to support a government sanctioned point of view. However, the crowd shots and the quick cuts from one scene to the next in a rapid but still coherent fashion, resonates through current film and even music videos.",1159920000,6,850,4.86896551724138

1006312,5,6305186774,"Rating and reviewing movies like these are often difficult for the average critic.  On one hand, they're done absolutely brilliantly done in ways that take one's breath away; on the other hand, how much credit can you give to a movie that is pure propaganda, especially propaganda for something the reviewer doesn't agree with?

This ""realistic re-enactment"" of the events of October 25th, 1917, is actually anything but realism.  Instead, it is a harrowing and amazing Romantic experience.  This is not to say it's bad--it's brilliant!  The direction and editing on this film are much more refined than Eisenstein's previous and much-more-heralded film, Brenonsets Potyemkin (Battleship Potemkin), and it has a whole lot more symbolism and focus on literary devices.  His fast-paced cutting is not as disjunctive as previously; instead, it works to shock the viewer with the juxtapositions.  I don't think I shall ever get the quick back-and-forth cutting between that one soldier's face and the firing machine gun ever out of my mind.  It's just that powerful.

This movie is so good, in fact, that it makes me proud to be a Bolshevik... and I'm not, not in any way or form!  How's that for being a powerful, well-done movie?  The Birth of a Nation didn't effectively make me proud to be a Klansman, for a comparison...

Because of its intense political alignment, I can't see everyone appreciating this film.  There will always be those out there who say, ""Ah, it's only Communist propaganda"" (which is right) ""so it's not even worth watching..."" (which is wrong).  For those who are looking for a magnificent cinematic experience, however, this movie is a fine choice indeed.

1006313,5,6305186774,"I was reluctant at first to write a review about Eisenstein due to the very hot political nature he is still regarded under...that being said I feel his first three films are absolute masterpieces of cinematic art.  His ability to create tension through sequencing and visual narrative make him an uncanny choice for the greatest director of all time.  He was making these films under very primitive conditions.  However, Eisenstein has an incredible sense of knowing how strong the visual medium can be and is not afraid to go places in his directing where no one has gone to since.

Sadly time has been somewhat unkind to him.  I also read that his last years were very unhappy and he was shadowed by the Stalin regime.  As to Nevsky and Ivan the Terrible I am less defernetial...they are obviously not as close to Eisenstein's heart as the first three..Strike, October and Battleship P>",1103500800,10,889,4.777777777777778
1006314,5,6305186774,".. I won't go into the propaganda nature of this film. It's obvious &, to me, unimportant in enjoying this movie as entertainment. What I will say is that this picture has left a mark on my mind & it's not due to any inherent political nature- it's because it's a very entertaining film. The story of an indigenous man who gets placed in power (after almost being killed) by a group who attempts to use him to get what they want only to be overcome in the end by ""the masses"" is fantastically displayed in this silent film. The lack of vocals only seems to add to it's quality. This movie contains one of the funniest scenes ever put to film & it could've only been done in a silent film using font size- the 1st meeting w/ the reincarnation of the Dali Lama. Oh, my. I had to watch it 3 times in a row the 1st time I saw it. Plus the soundtrack that was added works perfectly. Sometimes this isn't the case w/ DVD/VHS releases of silent films..

1006315,5,6305186774,"This film is not available in wide screen. Why? Because wide screen technology was not available in Russia in 1927, therefore it is unable to be translated to this current DVD (we are all becoming so spoiled by this wide screen thing!). What was available was academy format, which, while having a significantly narrower ratio than wide screen, served to get the job done. I think it is amazing that a piece of film shot 75 years ago has survived into the next century, mostly intact, for us to watch and analyze while all around us bright shiny new pieces of wide screen film seem hardly worth the effort. I digress... Now, this particular offering of Eisentien also features a bit of history some film majors and industry people (because really, who else knows about this? Sad but true..) may not know. The storming of the winter palace DOES take place within the winter palace. Why is this strange? Because a lot of the props in the movie, and the sets themselves were either rescued from destruction or pilfering by Stalin, just so Sergei could benefit from a wealth of ""accurate"" material to move his camera through and over. Therefore this film is known for having an ""accurate"" portrayal of what the winter palace, sans about 75% of it's original glory (and inhabitants), appeared like during czarist Russia. Neat huh? Now as for the historic validity of ""October"".....no. Sorry. This is a propaganda film, and one of the world's finest by far, but this is most definitely, without exception, Stalin's view of the ""glorious"" revolution as portrayed by Sergei Eisenstien. Did Sergei support the revolution? If he wanted to get a film made he sure did, and Stalin could be counted on to be Sergei's WORST critic if something did not agree with Stalin's personal ""version of history"". I like Eisenstein. He is, after all, the father of ""the dialectical theory of montage"" (film school phrase for Film as dialogue) which I prefer to think of now as MTV.",969667200,11,1956,4.772861356932153

7887074,4,6305186774,"I agree with the reviewer who wrote that OKTOBER would be a difficult film to follow if the viewer didn't have an historical grasp of the events depicted. I have an above average knowledge of the events because I made a point of studying them. Nonetheless, private studies aside, there were events depicted in OKTOBER that left me feeling a little confused.

OKTOBER is undeniably a straight-up propaganda film--and (Stalinist)revisionist propaganda at that. For example there are 2 scenes that include Leon Trotsky, but he is never identified (Unlike Lenin, of course.) I could identify him because 1. The actor playing the role was pointedly Semitic to promote the anti-racist program of early Bolshevism (Marxist-Leninism). 2. The 2 scenes illustrated tactical discussions in which the real Trotsky advocated the ideas expressed in the (silent) movie. They would mean nothing to people unfamiliar with the polemical clash between Lenin & Trotsky.

I also agree that some of the metaphoric imagery is murky or down right incomprehensible. For example, the role of women and ethnic minorities is stressed in the film in oder to, again, illustrate typical social liberating views of early Bolshevism. However, even these straight forward images become blurred with the obviously abundant editing of the movie. At one point one is left wondering if a Lesbian theme is being promoted--and at that point in time, it's not impossible that that were the case! But was it?

Regardless of these & other mysteries, I gave the film 4 Stars because it is an immensely important acrhival document and, despite Stalinist ""tinkering,"" remains a cinematic milestone & masterpiece in its own light.

IVAN THE TERRIBLE remains my Eisenstein personal favorite.

I plan to write a more indepth review for Parallel Perspectives (see my profile for link.)

7887075,3,6305186774,"Only thing I can say about this movie is that it is really hard to understand each shot that the director was trying to express, respectively, if you do not have a brief understanding of what was going around 1917 in Russia.

The whole movie is considered to be a mess since it was first published in the 1920s by a large amount of people's point o view. And I still think it is true even today, Although one may classify it into the soviet montage method and claim that it is where the success this movie got. However, what i saw in this movie is just random switch between shots that are supposed to be continuous and link unrelated things together. For example, Kerensky is obviously linked to Napoleon by a sense that frequently switch the facial expression of Kerensky and the statue of Napoleon in the Palace. I did not know who Kerensky is, and I googled it and still have no clue about why those two men are related to each other.

Soviet montage is a worthwhile method of film making you should enjoy, but not on this movie, you could try 'The battleship of Potemkin', which is the best soviet montage movie in my point of view.",1273536000,2,1137,4.38388625592417
7887076,4,6305186774,"I have reviewed Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky's definitive three-volume work The History of the Russian Revolution that covers this same topic elsewhere in this space. (See April 2006 archives.) Trotsky's work gives a sweeping literary expression to the ebb and flow of the revolution much as the film under review, October 1917, does so cinematically under Eisenstein's masterful direction. I noted in the Trotsky review that his work represented partisan history at its best. One does not and should not, at least in this day in age, ask historians to be `objective'. One simply asks that the historian present his or her narrative and analysis and get out of the way. That same standard is also applicable to the film director Eisenstein's work to which he was commissioned in order to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the Russian Revolution in 1927. Although Eisenstein has taken the usual cinematic license in presenting his epic that one has come to expect from that medium and furthermore was working in the period of the Stalinist consolidation of political power it is no the worst political documentary produced in that era, not by a long shot.

Eisenstein was the master of montage, stage direction and reenactment of historical scenes. That skill does not fail him here. In scenes such as Lenin's literally whirlwind arrival at Finland Station from exile in April 1917, the brutal response of the nefarious Provisional Government during the 'July Days', the Petrograd proletariat's response to the counter-revolutionary attempt to seize power by General Kornilov and the events surrounding the storming of the Winter Palace and the transfer of political power to the Soviets Eisenstein uses every trick of the cinematic trade. It shows in the faces of the actors used to portray the various participants. One may criticize this work as being too didactic in its portrayal of the `good' and `bad' guys but my friends that is what this film is all about. It is a propaganda film made in the 1920's and reflects the state of the art and the state of working class politics. The hoary-handed Petrograd worker, the star-struck Siberian peasant and the steely-eyed Kronstadt sailor were not society's `beautiful' people. And that is exactly the point. The intent of the revolution was to turn that world upside down with the forces that the Bolsheviks had to work with, warts and all.

I have endlessly pointed out that the October Revolution was the definitive political event of the 20th century. The resulting change in the balance of world power with the demise of the Soviet Union in the 1990's is beginning to look like a definitive political event for the 21st century. I have urged those interested in the fight for socialism to read, yes to read, about the Russian Revolution in order to learn some lessons from that experience. Trotsky's history is obviously a good place to start for a pro-Bolshevik overview. If you are looking for a general history of the revolution or want an analysis of what the revolution meant for the fate of various nations after World War I or its affect on world geopolitics look elsewhere. E.H. Carr's History of the Russian Revolution offers an excellent multi-volume set that tells that story through the 1920's. Or if you want to know what the various parliamentary leaders, both bourgeois and Soviet, were thinking and doing from a moderately leftist viewpoint read Sukhanov's Notes on the Russian Revolution. For a more journalistic account John Reed's classic Ten Days That Shook the World is invaluable. If, however, you want a quick overview of the revolution and view the film with that purpose in mind then Serge Eisenstein's masterpiece is not a bad place to start.",1188864000,5,3730,5.004830917874396
