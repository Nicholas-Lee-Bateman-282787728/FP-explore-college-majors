It does not spend much long time on each subject and so you cannot get bored, at the same time, it creates the inquisitiveness to know the background of the place. I like the narration too - it makes the audience interested about the place and enacting situations from past in some places makes the video more interesting (though the dresses chosen for acts does not look like matches with time periods).",1354060800,,569,4.876288659793815

1848602,5,B00008J2FO,"My 4th- 6th grade gifted students have enjoyed ""travelling"" the world with this series.  The 2 disks have both man-made and natural world wonders.  Disk 2 also has a PowerPoint type of section with appropriate music from that world location in the background.  It gives a bit of cultural flavor to the scenery.  I will be playing this as a loop during my in-school Wonders of the World museum.",1269302400,10,393,4.6521739130434785

7984687,1,B00008J2FO,Grainy footage. I cannot decide if these are old videos that have been repackaged with a newer copyright date or if they have been burned onto the lowest quality DVDs. It is a pity because the locations are interesting. Even the credits are hard to read. Very disappointed in this product. I do not recommend them.,1425513600,,314,4.625
