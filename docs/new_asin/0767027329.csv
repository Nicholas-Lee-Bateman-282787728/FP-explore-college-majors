5196,5,0767027329,"Much has been said already making the quality of this dvd obvious, but I think another person listed as completely satisfied is in order here.  I cannot explain how completely eerie it is to see some of these events recorded in color.  You will never forget the scenes from the concentration camps, and how you are assured with color that these things were allowed to happen not that long ago.  The complete and utter destruction of 'modern' cities in color is so very strange to see.  Should be in every history class.  Nice to see Canadians getting recognition for their contribution too!
Incredible, eerie, mesmorizing, well-edited and educational.",997574400,16,651,4.9907407407407405
5197,5,0767027329,"This is the most astonishing, complete and concise documentary I have EVER had the pleasure of viewing. Worth twice the price. I am a WWII collector and I can say without a doubt that this set is a MUST for any WWII collector!",982108800,14,226,4.27906976744186
5198,5,0767027329,"If you weren't alive during WWII (and that means a lot of you) then you should see this. It has the clarity and appearance of the color footage from the Vietnam War. I'm 30 years old, and this DVD made me realize just how recently these events took place, and how swiftly they escalated. Color brings a humanity and reality to film that strikes home. Some of the scenes are quite disturbing because they're real images of real events involving real people just like us.
They did a fantastic job cleaning up the footage.",978393600,28,519,4.531914893617022
5199,4,0767027329,"All the previous reviewers seem to have covered it all. This two DVD set is essential viewing for everyone. The colour and quality of these two DVDs brings to life the horror and grim reality of WW2. They give a brief and tragic insight to what it was like to experience the second global war, not only from a soldiers view point but also a civilian's one. The focus is more on the human element of the war rather than strategic or tactical view and makes good use of diary and letter extracts to compliment the unforgetable colour images.
The only disappointing feature was that the review on the back of the first DVD suggested there would be combat coverage of the Battle of Staingrad, however this coverage was merely in the form of colour still shots unlike all the other images in this DVD set.
Potential buyers from Australia and New Zealand should note that this has viewed on T.V. as ""The Color of War"" and not to confuse it with something different.
Everyone should view this DVD to get a feel and an appreciation for this particular period of time.",976924800,11,1059,4.520833333333333
5200,5,0767027329,"Every human being should see this documentary. The vision will change your everyday life that you realize the burden of what we have inherited from those who fought and suffered just a little over 50 years ago. I really hope that the International Versions of this film would be distributed to the rest of the world, so that everyone on this planet will have a chance to understand this legacy to teach ourselves and give lessons to our next generation.
There is especially an important piece of message here, as all the people whom experienced WWII will pass away and a whole new generation in the 21st century know nothing about.  As Roger Mudd quoted Stephen Ambrose in epilogue, '..This is not an ancient history.'",975110400,12,718,4.744
5201,5,0767027329,"This is an astonishing set of videos.  First there is the jaw-dropping, almost hallucinogenic experiance of seeing WWII events in technicolor.  It reminds one of how much black-and-white film aestheticizes and abstracts events.  Admittedly our eyes don't see in technicolor either, but the color makes you feel far more psychologically ""there"" so to speak.  The second thing is the amazing quality of most of this footage.  It hardly seems to have aged at all in 55-60 years!  When you consider that film from the 1960's sometimes looks atrociously degraded and washed out, the almost pristine look of this footage is remarkable to say the least.  It must have been stored well and never projected.  (Of course, the producers could choose the best-looking bits from what was reputedly hundreds of hours of rediscovered film.)  Watching this film is a tremendously emotional experiance, sometimes frightening, sometimes grueling, sometimes stomach-turning.  The voice-over narration makes heavy use of contemporary letters and diaries of soldiers and civilians, and is often touching.  The cumulative impact of all this----the island fighting, Nazi rallies, shipyard workers, civilians hanged by Nazis, radiation victims, Pearl Harbor wreckage, air war footage, death camps, and on and on----is almost overwhelming.  Like having your nose shoved into the sheer mess and folly of mass war.
Now that I hear that the UK version of this documentary was narrated by the redoubtable John Thaw I'd love to see THAT version, but otherwise I unreservedly recommend this to anyone and everyone.  Too many people think of documentaries as boring but this demonstrates how mesmerizing they can be.  For anyone too young to have first-hand memories of it (which is most of the population now) this makes WWII far more visceral than you ever thought possible.",973036800,114,1844,5.313793103448276
5202,5,0767027329,"This is an excellent DVD with spectacular color footage and excellent commentary about World War II. The historical value of this program is excellent as the facts and historical aspects are presented in a clear and concise manner. This documentary also has the human aspect well covered as most of the footage is accompanied by voiced-over commentary that is taken from actual letters written by soldiers and civilians during the war. The color footage of the home fronts in Great Britain, Russia, Germany and the USA is vivid and superior in quality considering it's 56 - 64 years old. The battle scenes favor the Eastern front and the Pacific with only a few scenes taken from the Western front. There is some footage from the Battle of Normandy but unfortunately no footage from the war in the desert, Operation Market Garden or the Battle of the Bulge. However, there are some incredible scenes taken from occupied Europe/Russia and the liberation of two death camps which are eerie to view in color. This two DVD set is very impressive and well worth it. The bonus footage of Hitler, B-17 bomber crews and the war in the Pacific is absolutely mesmorizing. I would highly recommend this DVD for any WWII historian's collection or for those who want to learn more about the war.",970099200,111,1282,4.8054298642533935
5203,5,0767027329,"I expect as you read this, the most two most important questions of your mind (if you're thinking of buying this DVD) is; what is the picture quality like and is it better that the other `WW2 in Color' DVD. The short answer is the picture quality is consistently superb - sharp, saturated and clear. Over three hours of bewildering, sad, horrific and poignant color film. The other DVD is a very good effort, but cannot compete because the new DVD contains footage never before seen anywhere in the last 60 years.  This new DVD has been carefully re-packaged to disguise the fact that it is a British-made Documentary aired last year only in Britain (1999). What distinguishes this from out of the ordinary is not just the picture quality, but what you will see in color. It took three years for the team working on this project to find some of the material. You might think you have seen all possible color footage from WW2, but you will be stunned by some of the 35mm material in this DVD. Much of the new footage comes from two sources; Kodachrome 16mm color film shot by both the Germans (up to 1941), so for example, you will see the movies of an SS General who lead the invasion of France. You will see the pre-war build up in Britain, which starts with the optimism of the 1937 British Coronation (in rare 35mm Dufaycolor) and leads on to extraordinary fiery red images of London being bombed by night. You will see America on the dawn of Pearl Harbour and color film of the actual attack.  Other footage is shot on 16mm German Agfacolor stock and includes the only color film of the Warsaw Ghetto, with the sharp, clear color looking so real that you may think it was only shot recently. Another film is perhaps the most horrifying, footage, which defies detailed description as it shows the day that an SS Troop rounded up the unfortunate Male population of a rural town and executed them by both hanging and rifle. This footage is so shocking that you will never forget how terrifying this war is (you may find this footage distressing, I found it disturbing). The clear color burns the images into your mind.  It is all here; Pearl Harbour/Battle Of The Atlantic/ Stalingrad/Pacific/D-DAY/ Berlin/Buchenwald/Dachau/Hiroshima/ Nagasaki/Paris Liberated/Germany 1938-9/London/The Spanish Civil War. A quiet, respectful commentary by actor John Thaw is augmented by Diary readings from the people who saw the events. This restrained approach is all that is needed as the footage speaks for itself. At the end of the war, we close on footage of Times Square by day as New Yorkers celebrate V.J. day.  You will feel as if the footage is so real as to be a fake, but it isn't and all the more moving because of that.  Here are ordinary people, just like you and I, trapped on color film and shown a half century later.  The images live on. If you want just one DVD about WW2, buy this and never forget what you will experience.",963705600,348,2931,4.626923076923077
5204,5,0767027329,"I like the color film documentaries and this one is very satisfying.  The footage is pretty good and includes many scenes I have never seen before.  If you're a fan of the color film documentaries of WWII, this one should be in your collection.",1361145600,,244,4.5227272727272725
5205,5,0767027329,"I don't know how I missed this one. I have a library of DVDs on WWII but this one really brings it home for me. The photography is fine, but the things
that stay with me are the letters and diaries of the participants. Some of them are nothing short of astonishing. Heartbreaking and shocking. I thought
I couldn't be shocked by WWII material anymore, but I was wrong. It's always been the cost of the war in human lives that I find so unforgettable. To me, the study on Gypsy children by the Nazi working on her doctorate was madness incarnate. I know you have to fight sometimes, but overall this war was insanity in action started by insane men. Who was it who asked, ""Was there ever a good war or a bad peace""? I might add, ""Was there ever a sane war or an insane peace""?",1356566400,,775,4.208053691275167
5206,5,0767027329,"This is a very solid video series for WWII.  In three episodes it chronicles the war as a whole.  As a teacher there are many chapters that can be selectively used in the classroom on a variety of WWII topics and themes.  Since it is in color, it is also more appealing to the students.  I recommend it to anyone with an interest in WWII and to history teachers as a classroom resource.",1337126400,,386,4.2465753424657535

I can frankly say that ""The Lost Color Archives set does contain new, never before seen footage and in color.

No new flying sequences or ground fighting film, but seen here is prisoner of war footage and many striking civilian realities. I never knew that when the Russians took Berlin, every Russian soldier was given three days to enter any home or apartment and take what he or she wanted; a grim reminder of hell.

Home movies of Hitler and Eva Brown and others are shown during leisure moments. The walk-through of German citizens ordered by the American authority at the site of a newly liberated concentration camp. Horrific!

Many scenes of English life during and after the bombings and I could go on.

This set is a worthwhile addition to what I have listed above. All are available at amazon.com.",1322870400,,1070,4.61578947368421
5209,2,0767027329,"For the price of these documentaries,,,the color footage is definitely worth 5 stars.(if you pay under 7 dollars).The quality of the color footage is very very good..and not seen in other documentaries I have seen (I have seen most of the ones on Amazon).

HOWEVER....  the History Channel takes the footage and mixes it with its USUAL propaganda and more propaganda stories than talking obectively about WW2. and what happened in the war. so much of the time you will be watching a propaganda story and footage associated with it..and not hearing about the stages of the war.

5211,5,0767027329,"This is a great window in time.  The color footage really brings the story home in a closer, more intimate view.  You think you're watching Vietnam footage, untill you see that the uniforms are from 2 decades before. (color was expensive back then, so they didn't do too many).  It talks about the hopes, the fears, and the eventual hopes of the Greatest Generation. (without their sacrifices our world would not be possible).  Let's hope that we learn the lessons, and not deny there was a Holacaust.  Anyone who embraces this view are just as bad as the people who sent 6 million to an untimely demise.  If we don't learn from the past, we are forever doomed to repeat it sadly.  THe best parts are the liberation sequences.  Especially from the GI's point of view of getting such a warm welcome from the Parisians.",1295740800,,817,4.586206896551724

5216,3,0767027329,Good enough for some WWII info and best of all it is closed captioned.  I have many other older WWII documentaries and most are not closed captioned.  Big deal it my world.  This was one of the main reasons I bought this DVD.,1240099200,,225,4.186046511627907
5217,4,0767027329,"Much of the footage in this 2 DVD set is spectacular. It really makes the events of WW2 seem like they could have happened a couple of years ago. Some of it is so good that it looks as though it might have been faked! Not all of it though. A few clips appear grainy, yellowish, etc. Also, I was truly surprised at how few of these clips I had seen before. Some of them I recognized but the majority were totally new to me (and I have seen a lot of ww2 documentaries). A word of caution: like most war docs, there are some pretty gruesome scenes.
As far as the content, it was pretty good. It was a little like ""The War"" by Ken Burns in that actors would read letters, diary entries, and the like. Indeed,the writings of Quentin Aanenson and Eugene Sledge make their rounds here too (you will know them well from ""The War""). It was kind of funny that the actor would read the letter in English but with an accent from the author's country of origin. I guess it would remind you that the speaker was German, French, Russian, Japanese, or whatever. Kind of goofy but I got used to it. Also, keep in mind that it is only about 3 hrs and they were limited to only showing color footage. Because of this, there is very little detail and some major events are barely mentioned. This is primarily a visual experience. If you're a WW2 buff, you won't learn anything new. Then again, of you're a WW2 buff, I highly recommend this DVD.",1227225600,2,1424,4.25830258302583
5218,5,0767027329,"I was amazed when I saw some of this as a child in color at a time when most films were black and white.  I thought that color film wasn't even invented prior to WW II.  Ted Turner can colorize anything these days, even WW I, but this is the real thing and you can tell.  Very nice indeed",1223769600,,288,3.847457627118644
5219,5,0767027329,"World War II--The Lost Color Archives gives people a rare opportunity to essentially witness World War II as it actually looked in color. The quality of the color footage varies at times but it certainly gives you the feeling that you were there much more than if you were to watch the same footage shot only in black and white.  The quality of the sound is excellent. Thank goodness for the History Channel from which this program comes!

The first of the two DVDs contains color films of events beginning at about the time of The Spanish Civil War and the coronation of a new King (George) in Great Britain. We witness footage of English statesmen actually visiting amicably with Hitler; Hitler sure had them fooled! There is interesting footage of great historical value concerning the German invasions of countries like Poland and The Soviet Union; and we also see the horrifying color footage of the fires in London during the German bombing of the city.

The first DVD also includes footage of the fight in the Pacific; we see our men fighting to capture islands in the Pacific that could be sued as bases for important military maneuvers including the Enola Gay flight that would drop ""the bomb"" on Japan.

In addition, there is color footage of the brutal Wausau ghetto where Jews were housed like cattle and children were left as orphans on the streets to die. The brutal treatment of the Jews and other Nazi atrocities are made very clear throughout the course of this two DVD set.

The second DVD gives us footage of the last year and one-half of the war. We see D Day, the rescue of France, other countries, and the people in concentration camps from brutal German occupation and the gradual erosion of Hitler's German military machine. The footage continues to show us a great deal of bombing, damage from bombing and carnage. It's truly fascinating to watch World War II in color.

The DVDs have some extras on the second of the two DVDs. What we get is mostly more color footage that was not used for the actual program of World War II in color. There is footage of Hitler and the elite guards at his country estate and we get great footage of Americans fighting their best. We see more footage of fires raging through destroyed cities--and more. This is excellent bonus footage and it lasts about twenty minutes.

Overall, I highly recommend this two DVD package for history buffs, military buffs and veterans of World War II. This color footage is actually quite rare and I believe that it has great historical significance.",1197072000,2,2541,4.696629213483146
5220,5,0767027329,"History and war buffs, rejoice. Just when you thought you'd seen every World War II documentary, from ""The World At War"" to ""Victory At Sea"", this set appears. While you may not glean a wealth of new information or insight into the period, the color films imbue the war with an immediacy you've never experienced before- unless of course, you were there. This alone makes the DVD a worthwhile investment of time and money. Bear in mind this is all bona-fide color footage-nothing has been colorized. The effect is spellbinding, almost miraculous- as when Judy Garland as Dorothy first lands in Oz.",1185753600,3,597,4.862745098039215
5221,4,0767027329,"Based on reviews I'd read beforehand, I expected something big with this 2-disc set.  To its credit, it runs 2 hours and 51 minutes.  But it's on the pricey side and a lot of what's shown here has been on other more recent (and less expensive) DVD's, like ""Hitler, in Color,"" which is really outstanding.  I also expected this DVD set to be better than ""World War II in Color, the British Story.""  On the contrary, the latter costs less than half of this one, ran over an hour longer and had more unique footage and commentary.  The ""British Story"" is all on a single, collector's edition, digital disc.

For those building a DVD library on World War II, especially color features, this 2-volume set belongs in your collection.  For those operating on a budget, choose the two DVD's noted above, first.  Then, consider ""Visions of War, Vol. 2--Hitler, in His Own Words,"" and various pieces on Winston Churchill, for greater value.",1151971200,9,930,4.697530864197531
5222,5,0767027329,"Apart from the obvious important issue of color, ""Lost Color Archives"" is different from many other documentaries dealing with World War II.  The emphasis is much less on causes and facts than it is on the impact of the war on society and individuals.  Its use of personal observances is remeniscent of the way Ken Burns used eye witness accounts in ""The Civil War"" to make more of an impact on the viewer.
Evenso, from a historical perspective, ""Lost Color Archives"" does deserve high praise as a solid explanation of the war as a whole.  Because it is told largely from the eye witness point of view, the viewer has a sense of the impending conflict, then the endurance through the war, and finally, the exhausted conclusion.  Emphasis is placed on the fact that the war was over, but that much of the world had been destroyed and that the effects and rememberance of the war would linger on.
Add color to all this and the documentary clearly stands above anything else I've ever seen about the war.  Some of the images are average, some are stunning, some are beautiful, some are horrifying, but all are in color.
The combination of the color video and the first person narratives often sent chills down my spine.",1068163200,13,1216,4.637209302325582
5223,3,0767027329,"A good overall look at the available color footage during the war. The commentary is quite good as well. Unfortunately, much of the footage is not as good as it could be. The first program on the first disc has a disappointing black level, and as a result, much of the footage looks too bright and washed out. While the next two programs improve on this, other DVDs such as ""The Third Reich in Color"" have presented color European theatre and Third Reich footage more carefully. However, none can compete all at once with this two disc set.
The color footage shot during actual battles and preperation for D-Day are high points, as well as the seven minutes or so of Eva Braun home movies on the end of the disc. Pacific theatre buffs will feel shortchanged; I'd say 80 to 85% of the material concerns Europe. This DVD set is certainly worthwhile if you wish to see a large quantity of period color footage with informative commentary. It succeeds in bringing the war and the period to life.",1064102400,20,991,4.5418994413407825

7788675,4,0767027329,"Overall, this is a great documentary.  The main interest of the documentary is, of course, the color images.  I found the images from the Holocaust more powerful in color, looking more like a real-world news report than a movie.  Also, the diaries and letters read by the narrator add a lot of emotional depth to the documentary as most of the quotes are from individuals who died during the war (often shortly after the quote was written by the author).

My only complaint is that I enjoy John Thaw's narration in the original version, yet, despite this product's description, this DVD version is NOT narrated by John Thaw (better known for his work in Morse).  This version is narrated by actor Edward Herrmann. To me, Thaw's serious, deeper tone gives more power to the images.  Overall, a great 3 hour presentation, but if you want a more-in-depth color presentation of the war, I suggest the Color of War series.",1378684800,,917,4.735849056603773
