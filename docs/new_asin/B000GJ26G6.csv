2614678,5,B000GJ26G6,"Beautiful Freaks is one the best DVD's along with Bellydance Tribal East Coast. Tempest is just wonderful. I love everything about her! Very professional, clear and at the same time very down to earth through all her lessons. Wow!! I just love the whole concept of this DVD. It has showed me another perspective of bellydance. I am a goth (one could say). I just feel so identified with her style.

This is a must have!!",1160784000,8,420,4.526315789473684
2614679,5,B000GJ26G6,I ordered this dvd just hours after meeting Tempest in person!  Don't let her Goth exterior fool you - she is very nice and down-to-earth.  She is also a wonderful teacher!  I enjoyed this dvd very much and would recommend it to anyone looking to explore other dimensions of belly dance.,1159833600,11,287,4.588235294117647
2614680,5,B000GJ26G6,"When I got Beautiful Freaks, I really didn't know what to expect. But about an hour later I'd pulled out my high-heeled boots, worn one of my more rebellious skirts, put on my best Kill Bill look, and was dancing to Collide's Halo (acquired at top speed online).  Blame it on Tempest.

I don't know whether this is what belly dancing is supposed to be or whether this is true to the gothic culture or not. But it's so much fun dancing this way, I don't really care.

No point re-describing this video since anyone who's interested will find enough information on it at the World Dance New York website. Also photographs that give you a very good idea of the mood of this dancing. I'll focus instead on what I think of it.  It's funky, dramatic, sophisticated, and sensual. Very sensual. I particularly love the slow combinations and the song they're set to (though you could do these to any other music you think fits). I also love the way you can do these anywhere.  These are made up of temple arms, chest circles, hip circles, figure 8s and undulations. Tempest doesn't go into as much detail as you'd find on a full fledged belly dance dvd, but if you're aiming to just have a bit of fun and turn heads on the dance floor, that's just fine. She does give safety and technique tips as she goes along. For these combinations,s she wears a black dress I'd kill to get.

I see this being quite easy to do on a crowded dance floor - except you might put a halt to everyone else's dancing as they turn to look. Which is fine with me. The fast combinations are more funky and freaky with some hip work. On the video the fast and slow combos are done in different costumes, but that doesn't mean you can't combine them while dancing to a piece of music that has both slow and fast bits.

If you've never danced before, follow Tempest through a warm up (unless you're very keen on dance injuries), then go on to the combinations. Also listen to what Tempest has to say about gothic belly dance because... well, because she's very, very cool and funny.

As a passionate dance hobbyist (latin, jazz, belly dance) and owner of 46 belly dance videos, I'd have to warn you that you won't find as much detail on belly dance as you'd find on a full-fledged belly dance isolations and basics instructional dvd. I don't think that's what this video is intended for.

I'm tempted to shave off a point because I find the combinations too few. But to someone who hasn't belly danced before, anything more would probably be intimidating. So would a lot of information about timing, transitions and muscles. A small annoyance is that the Step by Step section and the About the Combinations lead to the same parts.

Anything that ventures into uncharted territory has the thumbs up from me, and this one is definitely a unique video. For a new dancer it'll give a quick bit of funk and style with moves that can be done on the dance floor any time--doesn't matter if it's not dead serious isolation-based movement. For the seasoned dancer it sets a nice mood and gives ideas on doing more with the combinations you already know in this style. For both, it's fun, and so well-made. For me--it gives me that it's-go-good-to-be-bad feeling that I love.",1159574400,23,3229,4.504273504273504
2614681,5,B000GJ26G6,"Inspired by Tempest's hypnotically beautiful performances in the Gothic Bellydance DVD, I ordered this one. Not only is Tempest a fabulous dancer with great style but she's also an excellent teacher, demonstrating and describing four combinations of goth/bellydance fusion moves with a unique blend of clarity and humor. There's also a series of yoga-inspired warmup exercises, insights into the nature of raks gothique and two enchanting performance pieces at the end. Love it!",1158883200,26,478,5.561643835616438
2614682,4,B000GJ26G6,"First,dance is art and expression which evolves with time, so keep an open mind if you are a traditional dancer or new to gothic style bellydance and purchasing this program. Tempest's instruction is clear without overdressed jargon and she breaks down the moves simply. I would suggest knowing the basics in bellydance first, because they are dramatized in a fashionable way to gothic style. This may cause a beginner some confusion but at the same time spark an interest at the very cool approach to bellydance or simply club dancing. Tempest saves the best for last when she slips out of her stomp boots and puts on 2 spectacular performances and as a bonus, contributes great tips and advice for the dancer/performer. I find myself referring back to this dvd; blending this very cool style into my personal style of bellydance.  I rate it 4 STARS!!!",1158883200,6,853,4.842465753424658
2614683,5,B000GJ26G6,I loved this video! It was so fun and diffrent from any bellydance I've done with some funky twists. Love it! A must have for bellydancers wanting to break out the norm.,1201564800,2,169,4.3125
2614684,1,B000GJ26G6,"I really enjoy gothic bellydance. I love the styling and dramatic quality, but this dvd is horrible.  I can not give it away.  Her technique and presentation of moves is terrible.  I have been taking bellydance for over 10 years and have moved through various styles.  I hope no one see this and thinks it is a good example of gothic bellydance.",1198627200,6,345,4.516129032258065
2614685,5,B000GJ26G6,"I picked up this because I saw it advertised in Gothic Beauty Magazine and thought it might be fun. I was looking for a how-to sort of video and this dvd was really what I was looking for. What makes it unique is the amazing presence of Tempest. She is a patient teacher and the pacing of the lessons are really great for this type of instructional video. The music was great, and overall I am very pleased with my purchase. I gave it 5 out of 5 stars because it exceeded my expectations and it has me considering purchasing other similar works. I highly recommend this video. It has been very useful both as a daily workout as well as for new ideas for dancing at the club.",1191974400,3,674,4.232558139534884
2614686,5,B000GJ26G6,"What you will learn most from this marvelous DVD is not so much about bellydance technique, but style. Tempest has a sumptuous, dramatic and elegant style, that also has a whimsical, mischievous side to it...she is both sophisticated and witty in her dancing, and has a sensual grace and beauty in her movements few get to equal. Tempest's arms and hands are exquisite, and she makes a point of emphasizing how important ""pretty hands"" are and to be aware of the position they are in while dancing.

One of the most valuable sections in this DVD, of benefit not only for bellydancers, but for any type of performer, is ""Gothic Bellydance Expression Workshop,"" where Tempest talks about facial expressiveness, how to convey a ""deep sense of drama,"" the type of smile one should use, and much more. One can see she has had a variety of different dance disciplines that have influenced her, especially Spanish flamenco, which she mentions in this section.

Contents: #1: A ""Welcome,"" where Tempest among other things discusses footwear (the warm-up is done barefoot, the combinations in both platform heels and a pair of killer boots). #2: A nice warm-up that starts with a breathing exercise and has stretches and isolations. #3: 2 slow combinations (lovely and ideal for a beginning student), and 2 fast combinations, that are more in the ""punk/industrial"" mode. All 4 are demonstrated and then broken down step-by-step.  #4: The ""Gothic Bellydance Expression Workshop"" mentioned above. #5: 2 fabulous performances, that one can watch again and again and never tire of. The first is one where Tempest looks like a honkey tonk saloon girl with a modern day twist, and the second one has the classic appearance of a woman on a Wedgewood vase. Well produced, the teaching sections of this DVD are presented without a horizon line, so that Tempest floats on a blue background, and the music is always interesting and appropriate. Tempest teaches and performs the ""...darker, more dramatic side of bellydance,"" but also says ""The most important thing is to have fun."" This DVD will make a unique and wonderful addition to your dance instruction DVD library.",1187049600,11,2151,4.986072423398329
2614687,1,B000GJ26G6,"I like Raks Gothique (Gothic Bellydance) and enjoy Tempest's website of the same name so I was looking forward to getting this video and studying her technique. I was, however, extremely disappointed with the DVD. As a Middle Eastern dancer and teacher for the past 25 years, I was appalled to see how badly the movements were broken down. In several cases, I'm not sure that Tempest herself really knew what movement she was trying to teach. For example, is the ""Paisley"" supposed to be a ribcage Figure 8 with one loop larger than the other or is it supposed to be an undulation to the side combined with a quarter turn to the front (a move favored by many tribal dancers)?
Tempest doesn't appear to have mastered these moves yet either. Her execution of the steps is often sloppy or awkward. A shoulder shimmy with locks or pauses, for example, should be sharp, not jerky and the arms should remain high, not drop to the waist. Likewise, hip circles should not be made so large that they rocket out of control and the hands should be energized even when they are in a down position.
Beginning Middle Eastern dancers looking to study Gothic bellydance will either be frustrated or pick up bad habits. Intermediate and advanced dancers will be disappointed. Apart from being badly done, the steps show are not particularly challenging and there is not enough demonstration of the ""Gothic style"", in my opinion, for anyone looking to take style tips away from this DVD.
Overall, Tempest strikes me as an intermediate dancer who began teaching before she was really ready to do so. Bottom line: save your money and don't buy this DVD.",1186963200,35,1633,4.713286713286713
2614688,5,B000GJ26G6,"After watching Ansuya's Hot Combinations DVD, my exact words were, ""Hot, Hot, Hot!"". Unlike her and just like her is Tempest. She's simply cool. So cool.

A friend of mine and I share our collections of DVDs as we have the same taste but this one I got as a freebie from her, at a bottom of a plastic bag. ""Sell it for me or just take it, whatever"" she rolled her eyes when I took it in my hands. I had a feeling about it though and I wanted to give it a shot chance, so I did. It was great.

The title does leave some space for speculation. At first, incorrectly, I thought it referred to the  type I call Snowhite's-stepmother (no one's prettier than me...). In fact it teaches some interesting moves to goths at heart who need some dancefloor suggestions.

When you pop the DVD in the ROM, you see first a young woman,  rather homely than beautiful, dressed in black. You may be ready to get unimpressed but Tempest's appearance is very misleading. First off, she's a brilliant dancer and a very good instructor, and there we go, she's got a sense of humor to kill.

This DVD targets those who have some dancefloor experience but don't have a lot of, if any, bellydance skills. Tempest takes 4 combinations, 2 slow and 2 fast, completely breaks them down, providing detailed instruction of all basic moves such as chest slides and hip bumps. I believe that for the purpose of this video, Tempest does a great job, often dropping hints at the right time, all a total beginner would need to show off at the dancefloor. But how about us, advanced bellydancers? Those of us who can shimmy for hours and do complex Raks Sharqi choreographies? When do we do when we go to a party, or a nightclub? This is how the DVD can help us, suggest a couple of good moves we already know that we can use safely, getting the *right* kind of glances.

I thoroughly enjoyed this video for several reasons. I really appreciate the way Tempest took time to explain about the ""attitude"" of gothic bellydance, in other words, educate us how it is different from other styles and what makes it unique. She is totally correct, it is that attitude, or lack of it thereof, that can make freaks look beautiful, or ridiculous. I adore Tempest she is SO FUNNY! I don't think I've ever laughed so hard watching a bellydance lesson! For example when she demonstrates hip circles, she leans in and says, with a very straight face to that, ""don't put too much dip in it because there will be too much chest showing... maybe we do, but let's pretend we don't!"" IMHO it's a true art-form to crack up smart jokes all the time and amuse people - I don't think I'd be able to say any of that without bursting out in giggles. But isn't that what the gothic subculture is about?

Maybe I should have started with this but this DVD may be the worst, or the best, depending on what you consider 'cool'. If you are a goth fan and if you mean to dance in a club with other fans, you would definitely enjoy it. It is so full of insider jokes. Whether of not Tempest's video is good or not is as debatable as to who is a true goth and who's a goth-wannabe. I say, it would appeal to the true goths. To the wannabes it won't.

*What I liked about this DVD:
1. Tempest's personality and sense of humor
2. Paisley undulations (first time I see anyone explaining it)
3. Explaining how some moves work in crowded areas and what to be avoided
4. The warmup section - very important not to skip it
5. Clear and sound instruction

*What I disliked about the DVD:
1. I would have prefered to see another combination or two suggested even if that meant shortening the 'attitude' part
2. Both performances were OK but I think they were an understatement of Tempest's skills.

*You may want to have this DVD if:
1. You hang out at goth clubs and want to learn a few bellydance combinations good for the dancefloor there. Tempest actually takes into consideration the limited space in clubs and the kind of shoes and clothing you may wear.
2. You like new wave/ new age/ gothic, etc contemporary music.
3. You have experience with bellydance but don't know how to apply your knowledge in dance clubs
4. You appreciate a good joke being told with a straight face

*You should better skip this DVD if:
1. You don't plan to apply your bellydance knowledge in nightclubs
2. Gothic bellydance is just not you
3. You want/need a DVD teaching you a wide variety of moves
4. You hate drama and anyone who has anything to do with that

Depending on your taste in music and dance, you may like, or hate this video. My friend didn't care for it, I love it. Whether you will or not totally depends on your definition of a ""beautiful freak"".",1186185600,28,4670,4.378752886836028
2614689,3,B000GJ26G6,"My motivation for buying this DVD was to find a fun workout. I should point out I'm a dance beginner and not in very good shape. I like Goth clubs and the music but I never dance. My friends tell me it's foolproof but I'd still like to look good doing it. I was hoping this DVD would be a good workout and give me practice with Goth dance moves.

In short, this DVD is too advanced for me. Tempest explains everything clearly with ample demonstrations. The problem lies not with the DVD itself but my skill level going into it. I am not as good a dancer as is required to do some of the moves. Also, I was expecting more of heart-pumping experience when what I got were isolations of muscle groups. Again, not a problem with the DVD and actually it's a good toning workout.

I've put Bellydance for the Beautiful Freaks on my shelf while I work on getting into better shape. In my opinion it's not for newbies. However, I would recommend it to someone wanting to improve dance moves and once I'm in better shape I'll start practicing the moves.",1177372800,4,1044,4.321428571428571
2614690,4,B000GJ26G6,"Every level of bellydancer can likely come away with something from Tempest.

I'd definitely recommend the DVD for the arm work and the performances at the end as well as for Tempest's down-home goth wisdom for stage. She really does have a certain presence, a confidence and creative independence that translates quite well. She's very likable.

There is one very small part that didn't do it for me. The overly dramatic facial expression, the green goth attire, and the big black boots do not mix well with the sideways rocking, hard shoulder shimmy in one segment. It's clunky, and not particularly attractive. Thankfully, it's a rather short segment in a much longer DVD.

Although it's goth, the DVD does have some solid elements that can translate into other bellydance genres. While other instructional DVDs are copied move-for-move, this one requires a dancer to be a bit more discerning what she takes into her dance from here.

All in all, it's worth a look-see. You may not watch it quite as often as your other bellydance DVDs, but you will learn something from it.",1170028800,2,1077,4.868852459016393
2614691,4,B000GJ26G6,"I like Tempest and I want to meet her someday. I like how this video is presented, she first shows you how to incorporate bellydance moves onto your standatd goth club dance floor, but you can also use this part to make your bellydance more goth. She explains things in a clear and easy to understand manner, and her outfits are amazing!

I did have one bit about the Expression Workshop, she is a little too ""candid"" in a couple places, and tends to overexplain. (""porn face""). But I suppose the target audience for this video is of the more open-minded set (not many prissy grandmas and soccer moms) so it's not a huge deal. It's a good thing to include though, and Tempest makes a good point that Goth BD is NOT the same as Cabaret or Tribal; IMO, it's as different from each of those as they are from each other.

And of course, her performances at the end are great to watch!",1168905600,12,880,4.327272727272727
2614692,5,B000GJ26G6,I had the oppurtunity to meet Tempest. Her workshop was great and having the DVD covers what she did and more at the workshop. I purchased Beautiful Freaks as well and totally impressed with it as well.  I think it's worth the money to learn some new tricks to bellydancing.,1163721600,6,274,4.48

8133223,3,B000GJ26G6,"I'm a big fan of fusion belly dancing. While I certainly respect belly dancing purists, I am all about personalization in dance. I love watching dancers who fuse belly dance with other types of dance or use non-traditional music, and I am working toward finding my own style as I improve my craft. That said, there are core moves in belly dance that should be executed solidly before fusion, and certain things in belly dance that I believe are necessary for executing those core moves. One of the biggest issues I had with this video is the amount of dancing that was done wearing chunky, clunky, high / platform Gothic style shoes - while I loved the fashion of it, I truly believe that dancing barefoot (or nearly barefoot) is very necessary for executing core moves, particularly due to the position your hips, spine, legs, etc, should be in to safely perform these moves. In my opinion, the dancing suffered greatly due to the shoes. If this had been purely a performance video, it wouldn't bother me so much - to each their own, after all - but as an instructional video, I felt that this was a problem. The soundtrack was fabulous (omg, I absolutely LOVE Jill Tracy!), which shows new dancers that they aren't limited to traditional music, and the fast and slow performance segments at the end were lovely. Overall, I think it the video is best for showing how deeply one can personalize belly dancing, but as an instructional video it fell short. I watched it through twice when I received it and I haven't watched it again since.",1403136000,2,1538,4.637362637362638

She both terrified me and inspired me to begin dancing. I have begun. We have been meeting every other morning, Tempest and I. Of course, she shows up via dvd, but still, she shows up.

8133225,2,B000GJ26G6,"I bought this DVD at a festival a few years ago when I first started taking classes. I might have liked it more if I didn't already have Ariellah's. The dance instruction is pretty basic and unexceptional. The performances are boring, although I do like the music.

Not saying Tempest is a bad dancer or teacher in real life, but I outgrew this disc before I even got it. Might be useful for a teen who loves Hot Topic.",1325289600,,419,4.30379746835443

I've always wanted to dance but until recently, felt my body size excluded me. Tempest is sleek, but makes a point of saying that anyone who wants to can learn her moves.

I really like her style of teaching, and found myself catching on right away. In addition, she does an excellent job of giving cues. The music is phenomenal, and includes the beats of gothic artists such as Jill Tracy and Collide. Tempest also includes some flamenco-inspired moves in Bellydance for the Beautiful Freaks, making this a true fusion winner.",1263254400,3,690,4.8474576271186445
8133227,5,B000GJ26G6,"Being very new to Belly Dance and loving anything goth, I couldn't buy this dvd quicker. Especially being that it is by Tempest.
She has a very witty sense of humour. She runs through the moves and makes it easy. The warmup wasn't quite as good as I thought but it definately warmed me up enough.
Tempests' performances at the end are very good. Pity there's only two though.
The routines are broken down easily and in two sections. One slow and one faster. I found it easier (for me) to do the slower one as Im only a beginner.
The gothic workshop was fun and full of info especially if you will be performing on stage, which one day soon I will be.
Loved it :)",1247184000,3,662,4.2204724409448815
8133228,4,B000GJ26G6,"This video is helpful and interesting if you're a beginning bellydancer looking to get into alternative bellydance. It gives you four routines, two slow, two faster and with more of a gothic edge, that are then broken down, as well as tips on how to manage them on the club dance floor, on maintaining a dramatic element through expression and costume, etc. The choice of music is excellent - Collide is definitely the music to come to mind when I think of this kind of bellydance.

Tempest is down-to-earth and impressive, yet I would say a touch unprofessional at times (I don't know why, but I feel like towards the end there's a part where she's a bit sloppier with giving instructions, like she got tired of repeating them, hah). I think it would actually be better if there were a background behind her, as it kind of just looks like she is floating in a blue space, which isn't all that atmospheric. I agree with what another reviewer said, that the part where she talks about the gothic aspects of bellydance doesn't seem necessary and isn't as interesting as it might be. I don't think she does a very good job of defining what gothic bellydance really is. Finally, despite her emphasizing how important it is to have dramatic facial expressions, she is very expressionless throughout, so perhaps she isn't the best candidate to demonstrate that aspect of her advice. But just a minor thing. I know not everyone can look smoldering or piquant.

I really don't know anything about bellydance, but I've heard this repeatedly, so maybe this video isn't the best for strict, very technical bellydance, but would be great if you are interested in this stylistic element of the bellydance revival and getting a sense of that. It does repeatedly refer to incorporating this into dance at goth clubs. I think of gothic bellydance, just as all elements of goth/alternative culture, as above all alluring, stylish, elegant, dramatic, and edgy. It is fun and interesting, nor do I want to just do traditional bellydancing, so that's all that matters.

This is definitely worth taking a look at, it's enjoyable and definitely got me excited about bellydance!",1234137600,3,2155,4.818918918918919
