2344395,2,B0009ZE9XK,Our son is just too young to be exposed to that many scenes where fear and violence are a major componant. Maybe when he gets older and is able to have a better understanding of what is going on and does not get as scared as easily as he does now we will try this series again.,1214524800,2,277,3.8771929824561404
2344396,5,B0009ZE9XK,"The Land before Time series  is excellent. I personally wish they would number them again. I know they have done 8 or more, since I have acquired at least this in VHS  format. And the thing that impressed me was that the Young Dinosaurs grew as the stories progressed.
Whilst I personally love the first film the most, it is in Widescreen, and the craft in art shows light and dark in artistic as well as emotional levels. After the first movie I think the series was bought and turned into the popular Full Screen Commodity version. Whilst it kept many of its great qualities, helped by the appearance of people like Kris Kristofferson as the Lone DinoSaur, the level of the quality slightly lowered. I can understand this to some extent. Characters such as Chomper became favorites, and re-appeared in several films. I wish the Creators would take into account that there are fans of this series who not just young kids. Whilst I am not likely to buy the sing along, karaoke like tapes, or DVDs that have come out ( they usually include songs from the movies), I like the songs in the films to some extent, since they work well as a sort of animated Musical.
It is very clear that a lot of very good character work went into the first movie, and much of this still exists in the following films. I hope they still realise they have a great Franchise that works well for many ages",1199750400,,1381,4.454545454545454
2344397,5,B0009ZE9XK,These two movies are perfect for the young ones. Both my sons ages 4 years and 20 months watch all the Land Before Time movies. These were a great addition to our collection. I recommend this combo to anyone who has kids that like the other Land Before Time movies.,1168128000,8,265,4.32

8070913,5,B0009ZE9XK,The kids love this DVD and ask for Little Foot by name.  This is a quality children's production that teaches important life lessons as a bonus.,1349049600,,144,4.538461538461538
8070914,1,B0009ZE9XK,This series of videos is scary for young children.  Do not let the G rating fool you.  I watched the video with my three year old son who loves dinosaurs and he was scared during several of the scenes.  Also there is a lot of name-calling and teasing in the videos.  Not something I want my child learning.  Very poorly done story lines.  Pick Dinosaur Train or Dino Dan instead!,1337299200,,379,4.3428571428571425

8070917,5,B0009ZE9XK,My daughter and son love Little Foot and the rest of the Gang.  This set introduces new characters.  My daughter likes that Little Foot has a new friend who is a long neck also.  Great stories and songs.  If your kids love the Land Before Time movies than they will like this one too.,1234224000,,284,4.203703703703703
