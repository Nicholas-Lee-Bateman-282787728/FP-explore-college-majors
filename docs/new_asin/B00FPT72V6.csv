8617763,4,B00FPT72V6,"The subject matter is something the tennis world has never seen before, or will ever see again. An aging, legendary tennis champion returning to the scene of his greatest triumphs, after a year's absence due to an injured wrist. With all the cards in the deck stacked against him, he came within one card of holding a royal flush, by reaching the semifinals. But that's not the story. The real story is HOW he managed to do so. One couldn't wish for more gripping subject matter, or a more charismatic protagonist.

The real story tells itself, if allowed to do so. The ideal way to do so would have been with more actual footage of the event and less irrelevant interviews with persons who had as much to do with the story as Muhammad Ali would with a pork chop. Absent were people with first-hand knowledge. People who witnessed the splendor of Connors rising  - like the mythological phoenix - from the ashes of defeat in several riveting matches. Instead, we were presented with, for example, the likes of Chris Fowler and the Bryan brothers - who contributed nothing to the narrative. Yet, in spite of shooting itself in the foot several times, the story is so strong that it, like the play of Connors, refuses to be defeated. It is the greatest chapter in the history of tennis. And a must see for tennis fans.

8617765,4,B00FPT72V6,"I saw Jimmy Connors play, and what set him apart from the others was his passion for the game. That was why I was a fan of his playing style. I gave up watching tennis not too long after he retired. It became a boring game of stiffs except that Andre Agassi did make it fun to watch though. Believe me, Johnny McEnroe was the most hated player of the era, and I never saw that way about Jimmy.

The documentary of the '91 US Open run is excellent, but I saw the matches back then. What he did that year remains among the best tennis matches ever played. And poor Aaron, he seems like a nice kid.

The deduction of a point in the rating is that I can't stand listening to the outsiders. The interviews should have been confined to those who were actually there and know what the hell they are talking about. All in all, 30 for 30: This Is What They Want is a time capsule for those who have never seen Jimmy Connors play.",1425340800,2,920,4.105555555555555
