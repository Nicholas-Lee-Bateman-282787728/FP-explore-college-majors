8406124,5,B003UQ1VQ8,"This DVD set was exactly what I needed to fill in the gaps in my knowledge and experience as a starting film maker. Getting a BA in film taught me a lot of useful, ground level information. Working freelance gigs gave me a lot of practical, on-set experience. While both aspects of learning taught me a lot, there were still quite a few gaps in my knowledge. This DVD set has done wonders in bridging that gap. It shows you all sorts of neat tips and tricks in capturing the perfect shots to make your film really stand out. The camera techniques are specifically what drove it home to me, personally. They explain the reasoning behind the shots, provide good examples of where and how you can use it, provide film examples of where it's been used, and give you visual examples to really drive it home. But there's so much more to the set than just the videography tips. Writing, shooting, editing, gear info and tips, all sorts of great stuff. I would highly recommend this set to any beginning filmmaker that wants to make a name for themselves in the industry.",1399766400,,1063,4.512953367875648

Do I really need to explain why this DvD set is awful? Like I mean goodness gracious these people are actually lying to people saying that this is a good film start up set to get people into the field. Please do not wate your money on this crap set.",1361664000,,256,4.019607843137255
8406126,1,B003UQ1VQ8,"The things they teach you in this are extremely basic if you've ever read an instructional film making book. ""The most incredible Film School DVD Course money can buy."" is a hilarious joke. This DVD set only seems good for making at best mediocre quality YouTube videos you could probably do on your own anyway.",1361664000,,311,4.672727272727273
8406127,5,B003UQ1VQ8,"This is just the perfect course for starting with film making. If you want to be a director this is the course to get to try your hand at it. No need to risk tens of thousands of dollars and years studying film making. First take a course like this. It has everything you need to know to create great cinematography. It covers many techniques and gives you the opportunity to create professional quality images. A great asset is that the course covers audio, which is very important. Many video courses do not cover audio sufficiently and this can become and Achilles heel for many videographers, who then need to rely on expensive and hard to find audio engineers to get professional projects completed. Clearly a complete course that will make you the envy of your schoolmates.

There are some shortcomings. It does not cover editing and has a limited section of special effects. However these are more complicated fields that you will face further on in your career and do not interfere with your ability to start your film making career as a pro. Overall an excellent course that every aspiring film maker should have!",1304899200,,1122,4.724489795918367
8406128,5,B003UQ1VQ8,"Listen man.... since I was a small boy I was always in front of the TV watching movies enjoying stories of film makers. To be able to have this kind of information in your hands is such a time saver. Ever heard anyone say ""school is good but it does not teach us everything"" well if you are a college student studying film you are going to want this and if you are not a college student but you want to learn film then YOU NEED TO GET THIS COURSE my friend. this is a must.

5 DVD's full explanation and instructions on how to make your own films. THis is good to get your foot in the door of hollywood.

I don't know about you but I rather spend my money on this course and get a head start then to spend $20,000 on school( but school is still important of course).",1303862400,,766,4.0
8406129,5,B003UQ1VQ8,"I have just spent several hours viewing parts of this tutorial. I can not believe the detail and clear thinking that has gone into putting so much information into a form that can be sucessfully grasped by anyone in the field. From camera angles, lighting, focus, depth to acting tips, time saving, budgeting, camera equipment etc : the scope and depth of this course is far beyond the nuts and bolts that usually pass for master film making 101.

The generosity of the instructors in bringing together such complete information is unusual, and certainly will be appreciated and absorbed for generations by the Industry.

I am inspired, and know I will do better!",1279238400,,663,4.8584070796460175
