6440295,5,B00KQ82IO2,"Halloween is fast approaching and what better way to celebrate it than with the friendliest ponies around?  Theres over two hours of laughs and valuable lessons to be learned in this cartoon collection.  As an added bonus, theres a sing-along for the song Bats.  In total there are six episodes including:

Boast Busters  Twilight Sparkle is good at magic, but modest about her talent.  That is until a boastful newcomer arrives and challenges her to a magic duel.  Will the arrogant Trixie be humbled in this match?

Stare Master  A babysitting job goes wrong when the young ponies venture out into the Everfree forest.  Can Fluttershys stare intimidate a cockatrice and save the young fillies from danger?

Luna Eclipsed  Princess Luna is in town for Nightmare Night, but is given the cold shoulder no matter how much she tries adjusting her attitude.  Will the ponies accept her present form and forget about her evil past?

Sleepless in Ponyville  The ponies are on a camping trip and some of the ghost stories start becoming more and more real.  Scootaloo must learn to face her fears.

Castle Mane-ia  Applejack and Rainbow Dash are competing to see which pony is the bravest.  Their competition takes place is a creepy castle.  Who will be the victor?

Bats!  Vampire bats have invaded Sweet Apple Acres on Apple Bucking Day.  Applejack and Fluttershy cant agree on how to solve this dilemma.  To make matters worse, Fluttershy is accidently turned into a bat-pony from one of Twilights spells.

All of my kids, son included enjoyed this DVD collection.  The girls liked and hung up the bundled poster as well.  My Little Pony: Spooktacular Pony Tales retails for $15 but can be found for closer to ten dollars on Amazon.  This is a great deal and I highly recommend it for fans of the My Little Pony series.",1410566400,6,1815,4.767741935483871
6440296,5,B00KQ82IO2,"My Little Pony Friendship is Magic: Spooktacular Pony Tales is a clever and amusing collection.  This exciting and adventurous DVD is comprised of six episodes and a bonus sing-along. When you watch this DVD it surely makes you smile with great delight.

This series is a Halloween/spooky edition, but don't worry it is not scary at all, but there are a few really great lessons in each series.

My favorite episode is Boast Buster. It is really interesting and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The Boast Buster episode teaches you a really impressive lesson, which is do not boast or brag instead remain humble. If you have a special talent or, if you learned how to do a really cool trick, do not use your talent to make others feel bad.  Another lesson you will glean from this particular episode is to have an admirable spirit and use your special talents for good and not just to show off or brag that you are better than others.

My favorite character is Apple Jack, who is very enthusiastic, gracious and good-natured. Everyone loves her. She has a very unique southern accent that brings a new style to the My Little Pony series.

The voiceover actors Tara Strong, Ashleigh Ball and Andra Libman are simply stupendous at making each pony unique and special.

My Little Pony, Friendship is Magic:  Spooktacular Pony Tales is definitely an entertaining series that you will not want to miss. I recommend this DVD series for ages 5 to 12, probably more to girls than boys but, who knows. And, I give it 5 out of 5 shining stars.

6440297,5,B00KQ82IO2,"Its that time of year again! I see the light changing and it actually gets a little cool at night. Its time for fall! YAY! And with fall comes of course, Halloween!

And yes, my little girl was excited too.

The Episodes Include

Bonus Feature:
Sing-Along
Halloweeney
I think my five year old Paige was expecting it to be more Halloweeney so to speak. Some of them are more subtle Halloween things and themes than just being literally all about Halloween. Like bats and Luna Eclipsed. She loves Halloween as much as I do and I think she expected every single episode to be about Halloween night. But that would be boring right?

Ages and Stages
Paige is five and I think these shows are slightly old for her in some of their content and references but not in a bad way. Im fine with things going over her head, as long as theres nothing inappropriate for a five year old, which there isnt.

Spook Scale
Even though the word spook is in the title, there wasn't anything that scared Paige at all. There are things that are meant to be scary in theory but the execution really isnt, which is great for the little ones!

Nostalgia
I grew up playing with My Little Pony but the shows either weren't around yet or I never saw them. Either way, I love watching these guys come to life! It brings back happy memories of childhood and playing ponies with my little sis for hours on end. We would brush their hair and braid it. Paige isn't into the actual playing with the ponies as much as I was, but she loves the show! Its so nice to share this with her.

My Conclusion
My Little Pony: Spooktacular Pony Tales DVD will get you in the spirit for Halloween if you aren't there already! Its definitely worth the money if you have a fan, or are one yourself!!",1410220800,,2017,4.411290322580645
