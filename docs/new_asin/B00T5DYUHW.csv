7000620,3,B00T5DYUHW,"An okay kids movie, which is to say a dumbed down movie aimed at kids.
Which is sad because the CGI animation is top shelf. All of the animals are well done. The raptors and T-Rex all have plumage which is nice but the dromae are far too large, as usual. The microraptor was very well done and takes up the most screen time of the animals.  The plumage was especially nice with wind and lighting effects.
The writing is awful. Of the two kids, Kate (Kate Rasmussen) is better written and acted than Lucas (Darius Williams) but little effort was put into the script.
In fact the entire movie rushes us through the story. It would have been nice to have seen a bit of wonder to Lucas' character considering his age and what he's seeing. This goes particularly for one particular artifact in what I'll call the Valley of Derelicts. I simply refuse to believe that Lucas would have simply run past it, even to get home.
As far as the basic story goes I can see incredible possibilities for it, and with the CGI it could have been so much more than what it is.
A shame really.
I bought it simply for the animated dinos so I give it 3 stars.
The box says it's unrated but I say it's a G rated movie. A little bit of drama but no actual peril or danger.",1431993600,,1246,4.2133891213389125

7000627,4,B00T5DYUHW,"this is a great movie for kids not so much for adults. the cgi is terrible, kinda like discovery channel tried to make a dinosaur movie with real humans.

story: boy and girl on lost island of dinosaurs

my kids went nuts over this movie (ages 2, 4, and 6) due to the giant bugs and cool dinosaurs in bright colors but my wife who is an adult could not stand it because of bad dialogue and cgi. I am just a big kid so I enjoyed it. the cgi was a little annoying but I got over it when I seen the bright colors and cool looking dinosaurs.",1430784000,,537,3.9174311926605503
7000628,3,B00T5DYUHW,"Lucus (Darius Williams) is a 13 year old student who finds a quartz crystal in his grandmother's library. While flying in a plane, he encounters a mist and lands on an island with dinosaurs and 15 year old Kate (Kate Rasmussen) who has been there a while. Together they look at a few CG dinosaurs which look similar to birds with bright plumage...the latest theory.

This is clearly a kid's film. The acting was outrageously bad as was the dialogue, aimed at kids. The question is what age group? Normally the age of the kids in the film are a couple of years older than the target audience meaning tweens. I would go younger than that, maybe 8-10.

If your kid is into dinosaurs...and whose kid isn't...go for it. If your kid wants to be in the drama club, don't let them watch it.

7000632,3,B00T5DYUHW,"This is watchable, but you'll probably ever only do so once, as although it has some nicely drawn CGI dinosaurs in it, they clearly are on a green screen and never look like they are sharing the same space with the actors. It's a pretty weak predictable script too which leaves a lot unexplained and doesn't make sense at others. This is also one of those Australian movies where the actors put on American accents clearly to try and sell the film to an American market.  The island is clearly the Blue Mountains west of Sydney with bits of Vanuatu thrown in for some island location scenes.  They haven't even bothered to alter the landscape of mountain skyline to try and make it look different.

Basically a school boy is put on a plane where he has somehow got a long dagger like crystal through airport security that he found in his dead grandfathers house, taking it because his mother wants to get rid of everything.  He brings down the plane and wakes up on an island which has wrecks of ships, planes and giant feathered reptiles, spiders and centipedes.  He is saved from being eaten by a 15 year old girl who has somehow had the time to construct a really well built resort looking tree house compound, which for some reason is never trashed by the dinosaurs and other animals on the island.  She has witnessed many planes crash on the island, which bring her useful cargo, but there has never been any other survivors, until now.  Spoilers  - However throughout all this time on this small island she's somehow missed seeing, and they her, a bunch of African tribesman, who of course tie her up and abduct her first time they encounter her.  Likewise she's never ventured near the volcanoes.  The plausibility of this thing is pretty hard to fathom as your watching.  End movie spoilers - We've also got an older actor who is supposed to be an older version of a character but looks nothing like them, or even the same race.  We never find out what happened to every other victim on the plane the boy was on, nor does anyone at the end of the movie seem to be interested in asking him about it.  Plus how he ended up back in a hospital in the city of his departure when he activated the crystal bringing down the plane in the middle of the ocean is never explained either. If he came back to 2014 he should have been on the island (or mountain top if that what it is today) wherever it was located.",1480982400,,2410,4.425339366515837

7000640,3,B00T5DYUHW,"OK, I looked forward to this movie.  I like dinosaurs, I will watch pretty much anything that has dinos in it.  And I bought this movie because, hello, dinosaurs and people said that the dinos were ""good' in that they were not shoddy CGI's.

And the dinos are great.  I loved them and the other creatures, I loved the idea of the ""lost portal"" thing, I wish they explored the ships and planes and HELLO was that a flying saucer that was drawn into the portal?  I would have been all over that like a duck on a june bug.

Now the bad parts:  first the acting is not bad.  It would have to improve to be bad.  Second there are some good parts in the acting, but not much and finally huge, huge plot hole.  Possible spoiler:  Was Kate supposed to be his grandmother or aunt or what?  That was not made clear BECAUSE I couldn't understand a word when they mumble in what was supposed to be English.

All in all, it is worth a look.  All in all the creatures are MUCH better actors.  Both main characters are beyond irritating.  There were times I just wanted to slap them both.  Also was Kate lying to him about being alone on the island?  I wasn't sure about that.  Also, the distances that were supposedly traveled seemed to be miles and miles that took them about two or three minutes by ""flight"" and five minutes by foot.

And the thing is that there was a really good movie here.  Both characters need to be rewritten, the boy is very smart, I liked him at first, but then he just became irritating and boring.  Talk about a one note acting job.  For someone who was, supposedly, so intelligent, he had all the curiosity and imagination of a rock.  Kate started out to be excellent and then about 1/3 of the way through the movie she became tedious.

There was, actually, a potential classic here.  Too bad.  But like I said, it deserves at least one viewing.  And then about six months later, another.",1470700800,,1903,4.314447592067989

Well, I would disagree completely.  This movie is clearly scary for younger children.  We turned it off when we got to the creepy man-eating plants covered in eyes.  For an older kid, it would probably be fun, but I do not feel that ""all ages"" applies to this movie AT ALL.  Maybe 8 and up.  Also, as an adult viewer I was bored beyond belief.

Something about this flick kept me from turning it off, although I may never know what.

PROs
 Fantastically bizarre. So strange, really, that Dinosaur Island is only enjoyable if either [1] you are a child, or [2] you completely surrender the idea of making any sense out of it (if you are an adult). The script may well have been written by a psilocybin-induced scientist (yes, evidence of actual science makes its way into the movie).

 Dinosaur Island successfully mixes a nostalgia for old (like a half-century ago) children's movies with 21st century filmmaking and an updated cultural perspective (with the exception of a deplorable ""Hollywood Natives"" trope).

 The young Kathryn ""Kate"" Thompson is a good role model for girls. She's brainy, into science, and doesn't need rescuing when confronted with creepy things or dire situations.

 The CGI ranges from acceptable to decent (this isn't and was never intended to be Jura$$ic World; people who say the CGI is horrible apparently haven't seen horrible CGI). Plus, many more types of critters here than in the adult dinosaur movies.

 I can't remember the last time I heard characters exclaim ""Oh my goodness!"" outside of a sexual situation; while it served as a source of laughter for me, I'm sure there are some parents out there who will be pleased at how thoroughly innocuous the exclamations are in Dinosaur Island.

CONs
 Children won't notice when the script is flopping around like a fish out of water, but adults surely will. That said, Dinosaur Island includes some notably humorous lines, even for the jaded moviegoer.

 Basically, the film's strengths are also its weaknesses.

 Oh, I wish, I wish I hadn't killed that fish... I wish Dinosaur Island had been around when I was about 8 years old.",1436572800,,2100,5.791530944625407

7000703,3,B00T5DYUHW,"This movie was ok. It's perfect for kids but it's no Jurassic Park. The main issues I had with the film was not so much in the story itself but the Actors. The actors are AWFUL!! Seriously a made for TV movie has better acting than this. 2nd issue is the dinosaurs. No it has nothing to do with the added plumage (which they had), but really the CGI rendering was no better than a Sci-Fi channel movie, it was really hard to get past the uber shiny CGI models. I really think that this wasn't so much the fault of the film or the people involved so much as the budget it was given. If this movie had received more nurturing for better CGI (especially on those Pterosaurs) and for a more serious cast.

7000707,4,B00T5DYUHW,"I watched this on VUDU where you can rent it for only .99 cents in any format, including HDX. Would highly recommend you rent it there if you have the ability for that reason. The script for this film comes off like it was written by a 13 year old for 10 year olds, but the dinosaurs are surprisingly realistic given the obvious low budget, and it's about time somebody wrote a movie that includes feathered therapod dinosaurs, as the paleontological evidence increasingly indicates was the case for a lot-if not most-of the therapod dinosaurs. I can't help but highly recommend it based on that alone. If you can watch it with children, all the better. Don't expect a good story,  but do expect to  see great looking dinosaurs: and within the first 12 minutes. It fortunately doesn't provide a lot of tedious build up, and quickly moves the cheesy storyline to scenes of very cool dinosaurs.",1435104000,2,892,4.67515923566879

7000740,3,B00T5DYUHW,"A marvel of set and art design, Writer-director Matt Drummonds Dinosaur Island is well-meaning, old fashioned adolescent adventure story which obviously has taken a lot of inspiration from the works of Jules Verne (most notably: the similarly titled Mysterious Island). Its a quick paced, harmless and enjoyable (especially for pre-teen boys) but conventional journey with wildly hit and miss elements to the screenplays writing, that gives us many of the usual trappings of tales of a now parentless youth, this time named Lucas Winston (played by Darius Williams in a role that alternately charming and cloying), who finds himself suddenly ashore on an enigmatic island teaming with dinosaurs and ghost ships after being sucked through time on an airplane to his vacation getaway.  Soon our lead is taken aboard the treehouse home of a young fifteen year old girl, Kathryn Rose Thompson (played by Kate Rasmussen in a performance that hits all the right notes and proves her too be a promising young actress), who opens his eyes to the wonders that abound.
 It is in this sense of wonder, which is helped by a subtly striking musical score and many scenes of beautifully realized C.G.I. dinosaurs (there is also a nice variety of these aforementioned giants which keeps matters fresh and never tedious), which keeps Dinosaur Island consistently watchable. It takes its time to look around, ponder its prehistoric surroundings and that helps us get right into the child-like hearts of our characters. Such is a small thing that is sadly lost in most fare oriented children nowadays, in a cinematic world where the mainstream idea of kiddie fare is a free pass to act as inane as possible (and often stuff the dialogue with thinly veiled sexual innuendos which are wildly inappropriate), but it reminds us of the sense of wonder which made the dinosaur themed works of Verne and Edgar Rice Burroughs such literary treats that I would re-read often in my own wide-eyed youth (where I built an admiration and fascination with these prehistoric creatures that has never left me and, in turn, has been a bridge to gentler times).
 As previously mentioned the dinosaurs are colorful, but authentic looking, and this makes the proceedings all the more likable because as an adult one can appreciate the fact that these are modeled after our current Paleontological knowledge of what these wondrous giants appeared to look like. As a child one can sit in awe over their bright, vibrant appearance. It also immerses the old fashioned, Indiana Joneses-like action pieces with a sense of excitement that seems genuine but never too fearful that its inappropriate for a childrens film.
 This right note between youthful spectacle and adult intrigues and concerns also smacks with the dialogue between Lucas and Kathryn. Lucas offers plenty of comic relief (some of it a bit corny and cringe-worthy which takes a way a bit from the experience Drummond has set-up so well) but Kathryn is the more mature-minded adult who fills his ear full of facts about the creatures, allows him to abandons his fears and seems to be speaking more to the mature mind than the juvenile. They balance each other out nicely and provide another example of the great measure of young and not so young that Drummond knows will be his wide-ranging audience with a subject such as this film provides.
  Its also an effortless watch, though it ends on a strange and forced note, which at a mere 82 minutes is just long-enough for its topic and to sustain a childs interest and though I wouldnt go as far as to call Dinosaur Island a must-see, it certainly is worth your time (especially for fellow dinosaur enthusiasts). Dinosaur Island harkens back to innocence without cynicism, but with a loving and affectionate eye for the people and the creatures which surround its storyline and it is a worthy view because of this facet. Much of what happens fills the runtime of other, possibly better, dinosaur oriented fare but not many have its heart or sensitivity when dealing with such a subject. The fact that it is gorgeous to look at, in cinematography and effects design, only helps it rise above the competition and, in so doing, gives us a cinematic trip back to youth (especially for us who grew upon Verne, Burroughs and their film versions) and because of this gives us a simply pleasant time at the movies, if not a truly memorable one.",1432771200,16,4407,4.900804289544236

7000742,4,B00T5DYUHW,"So, a modern day boy is zapped back to ""Dinosaur Island"", after a plane crash, encountering a
15-year-old girl that was born in 1940... and dinosaurs.

A time travel/dinosaur movie aimed at the child in MOST of us.
The film doesn't take itself TOO seriously, so I didn't either.
Entertaining? Yes. The Computer-Generated dinosaurs, insects, and other animals were done very well.
The movie didn't have a huge budget, so there's very little ""dust'n'footprints"" as the dinos trot by the [live]
backgrounds. Speaking of backgrounds---and I liked this movie---though I probably won't revisit it for SOME-
time, the ""bone yard"" of planes and ships sucked into The Island was unique to say the least!

I bet IF I looked close, I would have found that plane that, recently, disappeared somewhere into the sea...
and was NEVER found.

Still looking at this review?

One, background, mat-painting included lost things from The Devil's Triangle: Flight 19's Avenger torpedo
bombers; The S.S. Cyclops; a huge flying saucer wreck [ala Galaxy Quest]; and even Doc Brown's BTTF's
Delorian.
