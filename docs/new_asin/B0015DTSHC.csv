8258135,5,B0015DTSHC,"I think it was a HUGE mistake when lifetime did not renew this series.  I used to work out to this show every day before work and was in AMAZING shape, the dvd's are great though and though some workouts are a little redundant (because they each tend to do a little of the same thing, ie squats, albeit differently) it is a great workout.  I wish they would bring it back!",1384646400,,372,4.152777777777778
8258136,5,B0015DTSHC,"I bought this DVD after the lifestyle channel discontinued this program in this era where obesity and sedentarism is on the rise. I absolutely love the DVD cause its intense,and I can see amazing results already, my whole body is toned and I have so much energy. I have been checking frequently on Amazon and finally this DVD was available. If you want to see amazing results faster , in the comfort of your home, then this is your DVD,the results are amazing....",1364428800,,463,4.590361445783133
8258137,5,B0015DTSHC,I remember when this show was on Lifetime. I was SO upset when they took it off. My body was in the best shape it had ever been in because of the variety. I love this DVD I only wish they put more than 4 Workouts on it. It's excellent!,1341360000,,235,3.72
8258138,5,B0015DTSHC,"This is my all-time favorite workout DVD. I never get bored, and I always feel challenged no matter how many times I have done the same workouts. I own all of the DVDs in the set. Though I was outraged that MyWorkout powered by PodFitness was cancelled on Lifetime, I was excited to see that they were selling the episodes. If you are looking for workouts that do not require you to memorize dance steps, but instead challenge your mind, muscles, and empower you through strength training using different instructors, THIS IS FOR YOU!",1285977600,2,534,4.691489361702128

8258140,5,B0015DTSHC,This workout DVD is wonderful. Both my mom and I watched the show on lifetime until it was cancelled. It was the BEST workout show we have ever done. These trainers are the best. They give you a great workout in a short amount of time and you can actually feel and see results quickly. I look forward to the rest of the episodes coming out. I'll definetly buy them.,1214784000,,365,4.228571428571429
8258141,5,B0015DTSHC,"It's unfortunate that this show was cancelled and replaced by the same ole, same ole Denise Austin. Once I discovered My Workout on TV it took me to a whole new level in how I work out. I had no problem getting up at 5:30am and looked forward to it knowing the results I was going to get. The trainers are fabulous and not overly exuberant and annoying. The exercises are easy to follow and perform and they include moves for all fitness levels. With just a tweak of your foot your talking a whole new ball game. I have dozens of exercise DVD's and rarely use them since I purchased My Workout. It is by far the best in the quality of the exercises, results & presentation. I still have several of thier shows on my DVR that I continually go back to as well as using the new DVD. Looking forward to purchasing volume II and hope there are many more to come. I highly recommend!",1208908800,,877,4.226190476190476
8258142,5,B0015DTSHC,"I missed this show when it was taken off the air and have been waiting for the DVDs.  I have enjoyed the challenging workouts once again.  The only disappointing things are that without the commercials the routines are only about 20 minutes and that my main DVD player (which won't play burned DVDs), won't play these.  I am forced to exercise elsewhere.  In any case they are great, I'll get more!",1207008000,,398,4.563380281690141
8258143,5,B0015DTSHC,This is a great workout DVD!  It doesn't just target a specific body part; you get five different workouts.  Thank you Podfitness for making these available after a certain network cancelled your show.  These workouts are much better than anything Denise Austin offers.,1205884800,,269,5.209302325581396
