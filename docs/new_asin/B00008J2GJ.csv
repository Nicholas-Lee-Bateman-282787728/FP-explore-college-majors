But you can't live on steak all the time.....there is a place for an ice cream cone too.....and this film is great ol' campy Southern California back-country early 1950's FUN, like Highway Patrol, Brodrick Crawford, ""10-4!"" And Crawford was in a Fellini movie, but that's another story. And OMG, Jazz fans, at the beginning of the film, at the the Saddlepeak Diner, guess who's playing on the radio....Chet Baker! If you are a classic car buff as I am, you'll have a hard time deciding what gets you more excited, Dorothy Malone in her prime, or the luscious white Jaguar which was the real star of the flick. Yeah, I know, the script wasn't penned by Dalton Trumbo or Woody Allen, but who cares? I love this flick! I have watched it so many times!  At first I rated it five stars, then I remembered you have to save five stars for classic art films like ""La Dolce Vita."" However, this film certainly  deserves four stars, the highest number of stars you can give to a movie that's pure ""guilty pleasure."" Thanks, Roger!",1336780800,,1243,4.6454545454545455

1848622,5,B00008J2GJ,"This film is nothing like the 2001 film of the same name and that's good. John Ireland does a great job being the criminal in this one and Dorothy Malone is good as the head smart woman in a man's world. While the film really does look like Roger Corman found a group of racers and decided to build a film around them, this is definitely not a bad film. It is defiantly a great little classic to watch.",1227225600,6,402,4.10126582278481
1848623,2,B00008J2GJ,"This review is for the 2003 Alpha DVD

The synopsis of the film is that a truck driver played by John Ireland is arrested for vehicular homicide.  Claiming to be innocent, he escapes from prison and kidnaps a beautiful woman (Dorothy Malone) and together drive towards the Mexican border in her late model Jaguar sportscar.  Since the police are after this kidnapper, he realizes his best chance of escaping is by racing her car in a road rally that goes across the Mexican border.

The problems and flaws with the film seem insurmountable.  The acting in the opening scene in the diner is hideous and improves only marginally as the film goes on.  The cinematography is suspect at times, especially in many of the outdoor scenes where no fill lighting was used, thus creating harsh shadows on the faces of the characters.  The editing was poor at times also.  But the biggest problem is the plot itself.  There are just too many situations that don't seem believable - mainly the ongoing hate-love-hate-love relationship with the two main characters.  The most idiotic scene has to be where John Ireland locks Dorothy Malone in a small wooden shack with no windows out in the country and she decides to set the shack on fire from the inside to get herself out.  Another obvious flaw is why would a beautiful and wealthy young woman settle for this poor and plain looking loser who could be a murderer?  The only two things that save this film from being a complete bomb are Dorothy Malone and some marginally interesting film footage of early 1950's European sportscars racing through the mountains and rural countrysides.  But inspite of the serious problems, I found these flaws morbidly laughable at times, and therefore I can at least credit this film for having some minor entertainment value.

As for the DVD, the B&W full screen picture shows lots of film damage and lacks sharpness and at times has contrast problems.  There are also several breaks in the continuity of the film, probably due to poor splicing jobs.  It's obvious that Alpha found one worn copy of this film and transferred it to DVD without any restoration or re-mastering.  The DVD did not have any bonus material.

1848624,2,B00008J2GJ,"(Note this movie shares its title with a more recent film.  Apart from the name and the presence of allegedly fast cars, the two films have nothing in common.)

If you like the interaction between the two main characters, then you'll almost certainly like THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS (1954).  However, if -- like me -- you find the relationship shallow and unbelievable, then the rest of the movie will probably fail to impress you too.  The problem is that there isn't much else to the film outside of that relationship

The plot is overly simple.  A man (John Ireland), wrongly accused of murder, is on the run from the authorities.  By necessity, he kidnaps a woman (Dorothy Malone) to make use of her car.  It turns out that not only is the car a souped up sports car, but the woman is a race car driver on her way to an international car race (starts in California, crosses into Mexico).  Ireland's character decides this is the perfect way to escape the US police and plans to enter the race despite never having raced before.

I can certainly appreciate what the film was attempting.  It's a character study.  Put two dissimilar people in close quarters and see what happens.  Unfortunately, while I like the theory, for me, this film lacks in execution.  I just didn't think that the characters had as much substance as the movie thought they did.  And the way they eventually feel about each other comes across more as contrived than natural.

I don't understand why Connie (the kidnapped woman) begins the film with absolutely no fear of the criminal.  She doesn't know he's an innocent man.  All she knows is that he's wanted for murder and has escaped from jail.  She's seen him beat a man to unconsciousness.  He has a gun and threatens to use it on her and their pursuers.  I find it unfathomable that she would be so blas about the situation.  Shouldn't she act at least a little scared of this guy?

There are lots of little moments of illogic throughout this film.  Why are the cops so mindbogglingly stupid?  At one point a spectator comes up to the man and young woman in a Jaguar, tells them how the police are searching for a man and a young woman in a Jaguar and then obliviously heads off with a cheery farewell.  Oh, and in another sequence, a rescue of a car crash victim takes place in which the rescuer actually encourages the head of the victim to flop around all over the place.  Neck injuries, guys!

As this is a Roger Corman produced film (more on this later), film buffs will know to expect a very low budget.  However, apart from some obvious back-screen projection filming during the driving sequences, the production doesn't really suffer from the lack of money.  The problems with this movie stem from the script and not from the production values or the acting.

As an aside, along the way, the ""innocent"" man gets in a scuffle and assaults a rather large truck driver (by the way, I'm not sure it's exactly justifiable to commit loads of other crimes while on the run from a crime of which you're innocent).  I couldn't figure out why this man was familiar to me until I consulted the Internet Movie Database.  It's Bruno VeSota, who I fondly remember from the mocking that the MST3K guys gave him in THE GIANT LEECHES (another Roger Corman produced film).  Small world.

I'm reviewing the Digiview Productions release of this movie, and their lack of packaging care has struck again.  The text on the back of the box proudly states, ""The Fast and the Furious was the second film directed by legendary director Roger Corman [...]""  Leaving aside the ""legendary"" descriptor, there is a rather obvious blunder in the statement.  Namely that Roger Corman is not the director of this film.  According to the credits (and confirmed by the Internet Movie Database), the co-directors were Edward Sampson and star John Ireland.  Corman produced the film, he suggested the story, but he did not direct it.  Apart from that, the description is flawless.

Despite the problems with the Digiview DVD box, the movie itself is in decent condition as far as sound and picture are concerned.  It's not great; there are some places where the film skips and drops out.  But it's certainly watchable.

THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS is a film I didn't like, though I can concede to understanding how others would.  Even ignoring the central relationship, I found the movie too full of people acting stupid just because the plot requires it.  You can get this movie cheap if you look in the right places, but I don't think it's particularly worth it.",1122681600,3,4560,4.635455680399501

According to the Wikipedia Roger Corman produced this for $50k and got back $250k in box office receipts. The plot is improbable but entertaining. The acting is ok given the lines the actors were given.

The footage of vintage racing cars may be especially interesting to some.  One of the stars is a Jaguar XK120 one of the best looking cars ever made.  I also liked seeing a shiny new Cadillac Allard. Recognizable locations include Pebble Beach, Laguna Seca, and the Monterey/Carmel region.

1848651,3,B00008J2GJ,"Most cinephiles don't want to admit it, but this kind of lurid, ""B"" movie fare had a larger influence than it is usually allowed.  Just think of Quentin Tarentino and the whole school that he inspired.

There's a flimsy plot to this flick, in which the barest of ideas (a female participant in a California car rally, sidetracked by a suspected felon) is allowed to snowball, picking up whatever detritus the writers could come up with.  There are only two actors of any prestige involved, Dorothy Malone and John Ireland, and outside of a couple of funky locales, like a truckstop diner--there's really nothing to it.  All that the plot hangs on is a simple road chase.

These type of shoestring budget movies (""Carnival of Souls"" is another) showed aspiring kids that just about anybody could make a movie, if they could just develop a rudimentary style of filmmaking and keep a simple contrivance rolling for 90 minutes.

The carelessness, the cavalier attitude of the director--rather than some Brando-esque anti-hero-- became an inspiration to some modern moviemakers.  And for a certain type of viewer, the tossed-off dialogue, characters who have one scene and are then dispatched to linger a while in a vegetative state, and clunky production values, became part of the charm of watching movies 'so bad that they are good'.

Personally, I'd rather watch ""Gun Crazy"" anyday, but for some people this kind of mindless ride is the cat's meow.",1364428800,4,1447,4.950413223140496
1848652,1,B00008J2GJ,"Some great vintage racing shots at the beginning, the musical sound track is truly horrifying. The dialogue in the opening 2 scenes was enough to make me turn it off and place it into my discard pile.",1351987200,,200,4.4324324324324325
1848653,3,B00008J2GJ,"Not to be confused with the entirely unrelated Vin Diesel vehicle from a half-century later, Roger Corman's production of ""The Fast and the Furious"" from 1954 stars John Ireland and Dorothy Malone, with a large cast of supporting players like Snub Pollard and Bruno VeSota, who you may remember from a wide variety of roles including ""Kojak,"" ""The Wild Wild World of Batwoman,"" ""Attack of the Giant Leeches,"" and even ""Leave it to Beaver."" While VeSota does fine, the low point for acting has to be the opening scenes in the restaurant anytime waitress Wilma (Iris Adrian) opens her mouth: her voice may be the most grating I have ever heard. Ireland and Malone do reasonably well with their parts, although the script is frequently implausible and extremely melodramatic.

The film has lots of typical 50s action ploys: the radio announcement providing the background, the hero wrongly accused of murder who gets a wealthy woman with lots of money and a Jaguar to fall for him, loads of terrible dialogue delivered with hypersincerity, etc. While the plot meanders around Ireland's fight for justice and flight to Mexico, the story strains all possible credibility with the pretense that the police know where the murderer is, they know he's driving a Jaguar, but he's seen all over the place in a Jaguar and he is never caught by their clever detective methodology. The ""I love you-I hate you"" romantic story of kidnapping, fleeing from police, and hilarious driving tutelage are somewhat improbable at their most likely, and detract from the film substantially. Head-scratching plotpoints abound: my favorite is when Ireland locks Malone in a shed while he flees to Mexico. Mind you this shack is in the middle of nowhere, so how does she escape? She sets fire to it from the inside, expecting someone to free her. In what way does that possibly make sense? It doesn't of course, except that this is a Roger Corman production from 1954.

The film concludes in the most over-the-top way imaginable, though I doubt anyone will be tremendously surprised. Will Malone make Ireland an honest man? You'll have to watch to find out! I am a Corman fan, but this is one of his more middling projects, perhaps because he was more involved as a producer and writer (""From a story by Roger Corman"") while letting John Ireland and Edward Sampson share directorial duties. It's not a wholly unenjoyable experience, but don't plan on any groundbreaking drama, it's really all about the cars.",1345507200,3,2479,4.914081145584726
