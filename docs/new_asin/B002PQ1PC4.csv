3965734,3,B002PQ1PC4,"I have to admit that the standard for this kind of production has been set by the BBC on films like Planet Earth and Galapagos.  This film has great video images, but the story line is rather weak and could have used a lot more research.  The background music tries to follow popular African music, but makes one wonder:  How would you like to hear a background consisting of American spirituals, or American folk music, in a film about the eastern White Tailed Deer?  It just left me thinking that the animal world, in both cases, has little to do with human culture, and it was distracting.  Linkage with several side-themes on different animals or plants was not too good, and more on the distinctive African flora would have been of interest.  The relationship of the fisherman to the habitat in the piece on Victoria Falls was not well developed, and one wonders what the story was supposed to be here.  People live near the falls?  What is their relationship to the wildlife in the area that were depicted?  Still, the images in the blu-ray version make this a very interesting set of video segments, even if the narrative and the story line left us hanging in places (for example, did the Impala just hang around in the burnt out area until the green grass returned there?  Was the whole place burned up, or was that brown grassland in the background still intact?  The temporal sequence of the Impala herd could have been better described, as it appears from the film that they move up into the mountains, just in time to get caught up in the bad weather that forces them down again.  In one place the narrative suggests that they just move where they want to, so maybe the migrations vary from year to year.  Several times, animals (Impala or Baboon) are shown dead, cause unknown.  How did that young baboon (Was it the same one shown previously?) die?  Apart from narrative and story line, once again, the video is great.  It would be nice to have an alternative sound track, say with only natural sounds, or descriptive without the story line.

I have one more issue with PBS/Nature, other than what appears to be a problem with narrative quality.  They keep putting advertisements for their web site as banners across their videos, right in front of the images.  This is not too cool when you are trying to experience the imagery, and they are trying to distract you with something that could be covered in a separate menu item.  What gives here?",1259884800,37,2459,4.609195402298851

3965771,3,B002PQ1PC4,"There doesn't seem to be a clear/cogent thought line that ties this together.
I love the cinematography, but it just sort of erratically bounces around to different places.
It makes it hard to want to just sit and watch it, but watching it in small snippets, or as you're doing something else (laundry, computer work, etc...) is very enjoyable.",1387324800,4,344,4.8474576271186445
3965772,5,B002PQ1PC4,"The first program is Victoria Falls, one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World.
Why were the falls named for a British queen? That should be changed. The falls span the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe.
The second program is Drakensberg: Barrier of Spears. Let's not name this area for a Brit. Is there some famous leader in South Africa whose name could be used to rename the Drakensberg Mountains? Who would you suggest?",1372464000,2,428,4.72
3965773,5,B002PQ1PC4,"Program One:  Victoria Falls

The program starts out by highlighting the Zambezi River. It follows how the local residents and animals, have only a short window of opportunity to fish, and engage in recreational activity, and only when the level of the powerful river winds down. Before that it's too powerful for even fish to swim in. The waterfall is the largest in the world, and the rushing water is dangerous to everything. From there it covers the animals that depend on the river for survival.

A misprint on the back of the jacket cover has Victoria Falls as program number 2, but when you insert the disc, Victoria Falls is really program number 1. Other than that the program is interesting, the music is pleasant, and the visuals are very clear.

Program Two: Drakenberg Barrier of Spears

This program is about the Dragon Mountains, that is what they call these mountains because they are shaped like the spines of a dragon. The mountains span for 600 miles across southern Africa. From there the documentary covers the everyday survival strategies of the local animals and its inhabitants. This program on the disc is also very interesting, and has some wonderful visuals.",1364083200,12,1185,4.875621890547263

Victoria falls is basically a hole in the ground that the Zambezi River falls into to produce Victoria Falls. The river itself before and after the falls is not that attractive, nor is the surrounding country side. A better title would be Two Weird Places in Africa.",1468195200,,439,4.4875
