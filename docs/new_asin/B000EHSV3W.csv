8110290,5,B000EHSV3W,Interesting video. The girls are of Australian style. A bit different from the girls in the U.S and the U.K. Very nicely done.,1393632000,,126,4.521739130434782
8110291,2,B000EHSV3W,"you would need a pole for most of the routines. Wanted to learn for my hubby. But it seems more soft porn for men, not instructional for dancing. Not quite what I had in mind.",1171756800,5,175,4.0285714285714285
8110292,2,B000EHSV3W,"I pretty much agree with everything that is said about the content of this dvd. The menu & production overall is good, good video & clear sound. Most it is set to look like a good strip club with a good runway & 40' + ceilings with the pole going all the way up.
It starts with a min or so of basic boring demonstrated ideas about outfits. Then the pole tricks: There is very little voice over other then explaining what you see in normal speed, slow-mo & normal speed again by 3 athletic women. There is upper frontal nudity.
As the video is in slow-motion, the voice over says, ""She starts with taking her left step forward, hooks her elbow on the pole to propel her body around & then slides down gracefully."" That's the amount that is said from the first 2 semi-easy turn around moves, to the 2 harder ones that require you to hold your body up for several moments or turn your body upside down, to the really crazy ones that show climbing up the pole like you would any rope in gym class up 10-20 feet, then do splits & turning your body upside down while up there & hang out up there for over 20-30 seconds like it's the easiest thing in the world.
It ends with a whole routine by one of the women from beginning to finish with a few people acting as audience. I didn't think much of it, but then again, I'm straight.
The lap dancing was so boring, I couldn't even bother to finish watching. I showed it to 2 male friends, they drooled while watching the pole demonstrations.",1163808000,2,1481,4.25531914893617
8110293,2,B000EHSV3W,"I'm always hesitant to give erotic dancing videos a low rating as there are not many tapes about this subject in the market place, but I resent producers who market performance related stuff as being instructional.  Yes, there is some instructional value on this tape, but not enough to qualify as being instructional to people new to erotic dancing, and certainly not in the least bit instructional to those of us who have erotic dance backgrounds!

That being said, I warn potential viewers that this tape will not ""teach"" you how to dance and if you have an erotic dance background of the least sort, it will be a waste of your time and money!

This tape is broken down into the following sections:  Fashion, Pole Tricks, Floor Moves, Lap Dances and Performance.  In the Fashion section, there is brief info on lingerie, evening wear and fantasy wear.  The models, who are the performers, are in excellent shape and extremely photogenic!  My beef is that women of size and color are not portrayed in this video.  We get the same old, tired, crazy idea that in order to be sexy or sensual, one has to be a certain race, height, and weight!  I hope all women will begin to challenge those mostly male producers who feel that this is the only image of females that needs to get promoted because it's bankable! Yuk!!! In reality, we all know that men and women find a range of bodies acceptable for sexual viewing. In the fashion session, no info is given on how to work with problem areas or what clothes will work best on different body types. Also, there is no mention of make-up application, the use of wigs or how to properly select those sexy, but mainly painful stripper heels!

In the Pole section, there is brief info given on how to do some (namely 6) pole moves.  Be warned that the moves progress from beginning moves to advanced moves very quickly.  I cringed on this part of the video!!!!  No info is given about safety or how to keep from sliding your a** off of the pole!  People with no pole experience should completely skip this part of the video as you'll end up hurting yourself! Plus, I do not advise beginning students to practice pole moves with 6in heels on...you are asking for spains and breaks!! I do like how the moves are broken down by showing them is slow motion. :)

The floor work section is a total waste of time!  No instruction at all is given to the core moves in erotic dance.  No tips are given on how to smooth out the moves or even what the moves are!  My main dislike of this section is that it involves the pole moves presented in the pole section.  So if you don't happen to have a pole in your home, you're out of luck! Also, there is no narration on the moves or what the dancers are doing...you just have to watch and try to catch on.

The Lap dance section is another waste of time!  The performers dance well, but they give very basic, tame performances.  No instruction is given on how to perform the moves other than some info on eye contact.  Don't get me wrong...eye contact is good, but you'll look like an idiot if you're giving eye contact, but not able to execute the moves properly!

I think this video could have been better if the performance element of it was taken out and more focus put on instruction.  It's so obvious that the producers have the talent as the dancers are really excellent, but the focus of this video is lost!  Is the audience meant to be for men?  Dancers with experience?  Beginning dancers?  I just don't know!  I will given them credit on the sound track...it's very good!

My recommendation is that if you are familiar with erotic dancing then this video might be able to give you one or two ideas.  If you are trying to learn how to dance erotically, skip this one and get Leah Stouffer's or Susan Bremmer's videos.",1158451200,10,3803,4.443001443001443
