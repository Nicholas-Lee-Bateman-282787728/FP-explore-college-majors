International stars David Niven, Charles Boyer, Gig Young, Robert Coote, and Gladys Cooper (with 10 Academy Award nominations and two Oscars among them) played a far-flung but closely-knit family of debonair con artists whose credo was ""honor before honesty.""

Episode: ""The Personal Touch"" - Niven poses as reclusive Australian zillionaire to pull off a daring, perfectly plotted million dollar swindle. Guest villain Walter Mathau is his mark, a greedy Greek shipping magnate who discovers - too late - that his Midas touch is no match for the personal touch of the Rogues.
