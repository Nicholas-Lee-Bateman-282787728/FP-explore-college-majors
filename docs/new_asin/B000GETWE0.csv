8131045,4,B000GETWE0,"Hi everyone.

I don't know who posted the actors that are in this season of Doctor Who (obviously someone with NO knowledge of DW and just wanting the $$ in their pockets), BUT if you are looking for DAVID TENNANT, MATT SMITH AND KAREN GILLAN in this season, you'll be disappointed! They DON'T join the cast until SEASONS 2(DT) AND 5 (MS & KG) respectively.

Hope this helps some of you and have a happy Whovian Day =)",1307145600,4,418,4.346153846153846
8131046,5,B000GETWE0,"Dr. Who is Forty (actually he's 900, but like the Doctor, the show had been around in one form or another since 1964). During March and through June the BBC celebrated by bringing the show back to television for its 27th season (or as it is more consistently called: SEASON ONE)in a glossy, fast-paced enough to satisfy contemporary audiences, while still conscious of its roots. This SET contains all 13 season one episodess for the 2005 rebirth of the longest running sci-fi series in TV history. The producers, clearly have a respect and understanding of the UK icon. Obviously, fans, the creators do things with the show we would do ourselves.

This set includes BOOM TOWN in which the Doctor, Rose, Capt. Jack and Mickey team up to stop Margaret, the sole survivor of the Slitheen family (from World War III and Aliens of London.

This was filmed as a cost-cutting ""bottle episode"" but has some great writing in it, as consequences of the Doctor's actions are explored... what happens after the action, when the Doctor must dirty his hands with the possible execution of a defeated foe.

In the 12th episode, BAD WOLF, the Doctor, Rose and Captain Jack have to fight for their lives on board the Game Station, in the season finale, THE PARTING of the WAYS, Rose Tyler has seen danger and wonders alongside the Doctor, but now their friendship is put to the test and the Doctor says goodbye...sort of. This 2 parter features ""Big Brother,"" & ""Weakest link"" gags as the Doctor becomes a ""flatmate"" and Rose a contestant. Also features the ""Final Battle"" of the ""Time War,"" the return of an old enemy in a battle sequence that couldn't be beat even if Dr. Who goes to the big screen!
