7971064,3,B00006L91X,Anthony Valentine must have had great fun doing this series because it shows on the screen. He bounces his way about bedrooms with his bored fellows and borrows life from the rich. Silly at times but good British entertainment. Recommended.,1372550400,,240,5.025
7971065,1,B00006L91X,"I've loved the show ""Raffles"" ever since it came out (around the same time the first ""Star Wars"" premiered). I thought it was fun and entertaining then and I still enjoy the adventures of silly Bunny and the more sophisticate, rascally Raffles. However, this Granada TV transfer leaves much to be desired. Shot in the old NTSC/PAL format and ratio, this series needs to go back and redo the transfer from the original negatives before its too late. This video tape transfer has so much ""noise"" in it that it's nearly unbearable to watch. The show's creators should reformat the show to the current ratio of 9:16 by using the original 35mm negative and rescan the negative for 1080p display. Otherwise, this will end up on the heap of forgotten shows and no one will ever bother with it again. Because of the poor video quality, I cannot give this show any higher rating, even though I love it (Is this a love/hate relationship?)",1367539200,2,928,4.664634146341464

7971067,2,B00006L91X,"I always enjoyed the old classic Raffles films so when I ordered this series I ordered both volumes. Mistake! I have so many DVDs to watch they often sit on the shgelf for a month or two before I get to them, so I was most unhappy when the first disk would not play beyond the first half of the story. As this was the introduction to the series I did not want to watch any more until I had replaced the disk. The company that produces the set require you to send in the faulty disk only and not the set for replacement. And they only give you thirty days to replace the disk. After a month I was able to watch the first episode only to find when I got to the third episode, it also skipped. At this time I have watched two complete episodes and have not bothered to open the second volume at all. This is not good as the stories are worth watching. A lot of fun in that low-key British style humor. This deserves five stars - poor disks lowers the value.
I have to add that I have selves overflowing with DVDs and not one of them have the skipping problem as this set of Raffles.",1089158400,6,1079,4.046728971962617
7971068,4,B00006L91X,"A Sherlock Holmes turn of the century series from the 1960s but a gentlemanly pair with a twist - Raffles is the gentleman thief and Bunny, his sidekick, is the bumbling accomplice.
Lovely sets, wry humour, Anthony Valentine at his best - he IS Raffles.
I waited many years for this to come out on DVD and my only complaint is that this 2 volume set does not have all the episodes of the Raffles saga - but only 6 episodes! And episodes seemingly chosen at random!
We await the full set of this series.",1068854400,3,502,4.294736842105263
7971069,5,B00006L91X,"I've always been a great admirer of things that are somewhat different in the realm of entertainment.  I've appreciated things that are genuinely entertaining, strictly for being different from the norm.  And this short-lived, but absolutely delightful series based on the stories of E.W. Hornung is one of them.  These are the adventures of A.J. Raffles, who in every aspect is the personification of a gentleman, except for one small detail, he happens to be a thief.  It was that intriguing aspect that drew me to this series, and I have not regretted my decision at all.  Anthony Valentine is perfect as the title character, giving a keen intellect, sharp wit, good looks, suave sophistication, and a gentlemanly manner in his treatment of women, while at the same time giving great moments of being quite debonair and adventurous.  Bunny is equally a charming character, perhaps a bit dim at times, but very loyal, and of course quite the worry-wart.  It's enticing to see how Raffles will come out on top again, that is the charm of this series.  In some ways, Raffles and Bunny kind of remind me of Holmes and Watson, it is quite an extraordinarily charming series.",1051315200,7,1172,4.8542713567839195
