8381485,1,B002US87CI,"My low rating for this dvd (called by the Spanish title CYRANO Y D'ARTGANAN) is not for the picture quality, which is very fine, from a very watchable print, in Technicolor, transferred ably for today's widescreen televisions.  No, it's that this French film is in one language: Spanish.  What's more, it offers no subtitles in English.  It would be nice if customers were informed.",1445472000,3,382,4.9375
