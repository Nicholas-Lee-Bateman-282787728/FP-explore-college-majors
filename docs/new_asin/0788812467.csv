75113,5,0788812467,"This is the absolute classic boy-and-his-dog movie.  Tommy Kirk loves his rascally dog, Yeller, who is brave and loyal to the end. It's a sad movie, but you'll want to see it again and again for the tenderness and honesty.  Life in the old west was hard, and Old Yeller made it a little easier for a while.  It doesn't get better than that. A must-see movie!",1024012800,,358,4.313432835820896
75114,5,0788812467,I just love this movie. I first saw it when i was like 8 or 9 and i loved it. I think most kids will enjoy this one but it;s sad at the end. I still cry to this day 15 years later. Great movie gotta see it.,1000684800,,206,3.3125
75115,3,0788812467,"When pa Fess Parker has to take a long trip, he entrusts the care of ma Dorothy McGuire and little Arliss to older son Travis, played by Tommy Kirk of ""Shaggy Dog"" fame. Life isn't easy on a Texas farm in the 1860s and that Arliss sure is a handful for Travis. Then a stray dog comes on the scene, one that doesn't so much bark as yell, and so earns the name Old Yeller. Travis learns to love and rely on Old Yeller as the two go through many adventures together, until Yeller bravely saves the whole family at a crucial juncture. But there's one more lesson in growing up in store for Travis regarding Old Yeller before Pa's return, one that marks the turning point between boy and man. A good movie to watch with children above the age of eight.",999388800,4,747,4.230769230769231
75116,5,0788812467,"""Old Yeller"" was Walt Disney's first boy-and-dog film, and is his best. Just about everything in this movie is perfect: the Technicolor photography, the acting, performances, and scenery. The best performance in the movie is from Tommy Kirk, as the older boy Travis. Tommy Kirk has been on The Mickey Mouse Club in the 50s', and a lot of Disney live-action films at that time, but this is his best role. For Disney lovers or first-time viewers, be prepared to cry during the scene near the end when Travis has to make a difficult decision about Old Yeller. It's one of Disney's most memorable heart-rending moments, along with Bambi's mother's death from ""Bambi"". ""Old Yeller"" is very much like ""Bambi"". ""Bambi"" is my favorite Disney animated film, and ""Old Yeller"" is also at the top of my favorite Disney live-action films list.",987206400,5,830,4.852112676056338
75117,4,0788812467,"I never had a dog.  But I had this movie on tape.  It was so sad with the boys and the mom and that big silly dog.  I wanted a dog.  My mother before she died said no.  But I could always pretend. in my clubhouse I would.  I  liked to pretend i was on the fronteir with Old Yeller, only he wasn't  dead.  We hunted stuff and he would lick my face. If Old Yeller wasn't dead  and he was my dog the movie would be better.  I guess it just happens and  stuff, but did it have to be him.",959040000,4,483,3.627450980392157
75118,5,0788812467,Excellent movie about an unwanted stray yellow black mouthed curr that adopts a family and wins their hearts by saving their lives several times in 19th century Texas. I wish my cowdog worked cows like that one.,957398400,2,211,4.72972972972973
75119,5,0788812467,"A boy, a dog, the old west... AND Fess Parker!  This movie simply could NOT have failed!  If someone out there still hasn't seen it, I envy their opportunity!  Fred Gipson's book was filmed faithfully by Disney (you  can't say THAT very often! ) in fantastic Technicolor and the dog actor was  GREAT-- one of the all-time best canine performances!
Sure, we all know  it's a bummer, but it's also the best, most character-defining bummer on  film!
It just can't be recommended highly enough!  AL",952992000,3,494,4.729411764705882

75142,5,0788812467,"What a great movie! Way better than I remember. My boys ( 4, 6, 8) were not overly taken back by the notorious scene. FANTASTIC advice given by the father at the end of the movie. I think this is an extremely healthy/mandatory movie to watch with kids. Teaches them that life it tough, sometimes bad things will happen and we can't let those bad things rob the good ones or it will be all bad. The dad even gives some ways to help get past those bad times.

My boys were entertained the whole time and loved the show. So glad we watched it!!!!",1517184000,4,543,4.171428571428572

So my grandma purchased the movie from this seller and within my daughter watching it all day for a week straight it started skipping and buffering with no damage done to the DVD. So I ordered her another one from the same seller and again the SAME thing happened for the second time with no scratches or damaged DVD. I'm extremely disappointed. I'm not sure if they are bad disks or what. But now my daughter has to sit there waiting for it to play because it's frozen half the time.,1503878400,,643,4.193548387096774

75174,4,0788812467,"My wife and I were talking not too long ago about movies from our childhood. Like many kids who grew up in the 60's and 70's, we both saw this once as kids and never watched it again. My wife's dad apparently loved this film. We decided to watch it again together and we are so glad we did. It's a timeless classic that anyone can enjoy. There is something magical about this cast and story. The phrase ""They don't make `em like that anymore"" comes to mind. And, yes... my wife cried at the pivotal moment. I actually remembered it being sadder than it was. Maybe as a child, I was a little more sensitive...?

Anyway, the main reason I am writing this review is that neither one of us remembered that there was actually a sequel to Old Yeller. So we happily watched Savage Sam as well. Even though the cast is pretty great, that magical quality of Old Yeller is not present here. The young actors have grown up some here and they did a fine job. Brian Keith and Slim Pickens are smart additions to the ensemble, but the whole thing still fails to gel like the original. The story begins promisingly enough but soon falls apart into a scattered mess. There IS plenty of action but it's not balanced to set against any kind of backdrop that would help to tie everything together coherently. Therefore, you end up not caring too much what happens.

Still, as mentioned, it is very difficult to recreate the kind of magic contained in Old Yeller so for those (like us) who weren't aware of this sequel it's an interesting watch just to see the characters after the original story. Just in case someone was considering this purchase thinking that Savage Sam was equal to Old Yeller, I wanted to give you a heads up.",1499299200,,1711,4.428571428571429

just watched Old Yeller with my granddaughter today! I could see she was on the edge of her seat! She talked a lot and asked a lot of questions, but she loved the movie. I can't tell you how many times I have seen this movie, but I still get that 'edge of the seat' feeling. I enjoy watching the old yellow dog with his saving ways and always the hero. It is sad near the end of the movie when the dog needs to be destroyed and the teenage boy becomes a man. This is a feel good movie to share with your grandchildren",1495238400,,738,5.426086956521739

75390,5,0788812467,"I read of an experiment run by the army psychological unit that was interested in nature vs. nature in response time. The anecdotal evidence had come from a childrens movie being shown on service bases. It was a cheap sci-fi flick. Rubber puppets were filmed in extreme up-close. The creatures first appearance was a cinematic masterpiece. It popped out of a lagoon. Shock was total  children in the audience screamed and recoiled in their seats. The reason seemed to be worldwide.

The psychologists agreed that the reaction to extreme danger was a rational response derived from evolution. But they knew about nurture, and maybe even mutation. So, they wondered if children were born with or without the recoil reflex. It would be counterproductive in terms of survival of the species, but possibly useful to the military, and, I thought, to individual survival.

They sent the movie to remote bases in the Pacific at Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines for a largest possible test sample. The Pacific because they wanted kids not yet exposed to even rumors of the movie. Inconspicuous cameras were set above the screens focusing on the first row. When the monster reared its head, the cameras were timed to snap to capture the stills of thousands of four-to-nine year old children. They all showed the same thing: small children, mouths open, eyes wide, jerking back against their seats, and some bolting for the exit. Except, in one still of a front row, one boy was jumping forward with his hands raised aggressively.

About the same time as the Pacific experiment, I was in the front row, a crewcut nine year old, at an Idaho Falls movie house. Old Yeller is a 1957 Walt Disney family tragedy about a boy and his stray dog in post-Civil War Texas. In a memorable scene where the yellow Labrador mix encounters a western diamondback rattler, the snake coils, rattles, and But I was out of my seat flung into the screen grasping the viper by its ugly neck to save Old Yeller. As a kid, at my first movie, I thought it was real for a split second. Everyone else in the theater had recoiled in their seats. But I had the snake by the neck.

The monster movie petered out, and the boy probably got labeled by long words, and recruited by the military. But Old Yeller launched me into a life of survivals, by nature and by nurture.",1461628800,,2329,4.670731707317073

75796,5,0788812467,"I've  seen  the  movie  plenty  of  times.  I  still  enjoy  it  to  this  very  day.  You  don't  run  across  too  many  dogs  as  smart  as  Yeller!  The  movie  itself  starts  out  with  Jim Coat's  leaving  on  a  cattle  drive,  &  Travis  (Tommy Kirk)  wants  him  to  bring  him  back  a  horse.  But  his  father  tells  him  what  he  needs  more  is  a  good  dog.  So  he  gets  a  good  dog.
Yeller  was  only  trouble  in  the  beginning.  That's  what  Travis  thought  anyways. Chases  old  Jumper  the  mule  &  wrecks  the  fence,  But  soon  proves  he  can  be  loyal  to  Arliss  &  Travis  &  their  mother,
Arliss  (Kevin Cochran)  wants  to  keep  the  dog,  &  enjoys  every  moment  with  him,  Travis  doesn't  want  him  around,  Yeller  himself  I  don't  think  wanted  to  leave.  It  takes  time  for  Travis  to  get  use  to  him  &  for  him  to accept  Yeller,  he  finally  does  when  Old Yeller  saves  Arliss  from  a  mother  bear,  from  which  Arliss  had  been  messing  with  her  cub,  &  she  comes  charging.
&  that's  not  all  he  does,  he  also  protects  Travis  from  a  cow,  when  Travis  is  trying  to  bring  her  &  her  calf  back.  Arliss  is  very  mischievous  &  messes  or  gets  into  everything!  &  fights  with  his  brother,  throws  rocks  at  him  &  stuff.  But  I  liked  him  okay,  the  situation  between  him  &  Travis  kind  of  reminds  me  of  how  things  can  sometimes  get  or  use  to  get  between  me  &  my  older  sister.
Yeller  was  proving  to  be  pretty  useful.  Chases  the  raccoons  out  of  the  corn  field,  then  when  Old  Yellers  original  owner  shows  up,  Both  Travis  &  Arliss  must  show  Burn Saunders's  (Chuck Connors)  just  how  much  the  dog  means  to  them!  Though  Arliss  doesn't  take  it  too  lightly  when  the  man  starts  to  leave  with  the  dog  &  throws  rocks  at  him.
Lucky  for  Arliss  the  man  did  not  lose  his  patients,
&  then  they  work  out  a  small  deal.
He  allows  the  family  to  keep  the  dog  after  all!
But  things  get  a  little  rougher  for  Old Yeller  down  the  road  when  he  &  Travis  go  out  to  mark  hogs.  Travis  ropes  a  hog  too  big  for  him  to  handle,  &  falls  off  the  tree  limb,
The  hogs  get  after  him,  Travis  had  tried  getting  on  top  of  the  large  rock  for  safety,  but  they  attack  him  &  tare  up  his  legs,  Yeller  comes  to  the  rescue,  What  happens  afterwards,  is  Yeller  himself  gets  injured,  &  Travis  has  to  get  help  from  his  mother,  &  says  we  must  go  back  for  old  Yeller  or  else  he'll  die!  So  they  find  him  stitch  him  up  &  get  him  home,  A  couple  of  weeks  go  by,  Old  Yeller  had  just  barely  got  done  healing  when  he  had  to  fight  off  the  wolf.  Mother  suspected  something  was  wrong,  something  suspicious  about  the  wolf.
But  Travis  wasn't  going  to  kill  Yeller  like  he  was  nothing!  I  think  Travis  made  the  right  call  to  wait  &  explaining  things  to  his  mother. So  they  pin  him  up,  a  few  weeks  go  by,  &  nothing  was  happening,  one  night  Travis  finds  Yeller  growling,  Old  Yeller  had  gotten  rabies.  From  the  wolf  he  had  to  fight,
The  most  disturbing  part  was  when  Travis  had  to  shoot  him,  That's  tough  &  sad!  Me?  I  believe  in  real  life  back  then  there  was  a  cure  for  rabies,  the  cure  had  already  been  found.  &  do  correct  me  if  I'm  wrong!
Anyways  before  yellers  death  Elizabeth Searcy  had  brought  a  puppy,  &  they  found  out  that  he  was  the  son  of  Old  Yeller,
&  eventually  took  old  Yellers  place.
When  their  father  returned  home,  everybody  was  happy  to  see  him,  but  he  wasn't  happy  about  the  story  of  Old  Yeller  dying  when  he  heard  what  he'd  been  through.  &  his  death,  I  could  imagine  that  anybody  would  be  heartbroken  over  something  like  that!  Anybody!  Yeller  was  a  good  dog,  &  weren't  none  better!  &  everyone  wishes  all  our  dogs  could  be  just  as  smart.
Jim  does  give  his  son  Travis  some  good  advice.  The  kind worth  listening  to,  some  of the  best  advice  a  father  can  give  a  son.
Good  movie!!  One  of  my  favorites,  The  ending  is  very  sad,  about  as  bad  as  losing  one  of  our  own  dogs,  even  if  they  don't  die  from  rabies.  I  have  found  it  hard  to  live  without  some  of  my  dogs  that  have  died!!",1433808000,,4525,4.148448043184885

As soon as I do, I will update this review.  Old Yeller is a classic tale fit for ages 1-100 +/- a few years.  This comes from a time when Disney made outstanding movies.

keep this family protected while their husband/father is gone (played by the great Fess Parker).  Chuck Conners makes
an appearance as Yeller's previous owner and the scene between him and Arlis is great as Arlis tries to fight for ownership
of Ol' Yeller.
The second story of Savage Sam has the boys older and owning another dog.  Brian Keith plays their uncle.  He is terrific.

Bring Kleenex and prepare for a heart-warming, life-affirming, coming-of-age classic with the incomparable Tommy Kirk giving us a very fine performance as that big 'yeller' dog's human counterpart. The quality of this Blu-ray easily advances over the old 2-disc Vault Disney DVD. Solid colors, general sharpness, a light smattering of film grain looking very natural and accurate contrast levels. Occasional built-in flicker does not distract. A few scenes exhibit less than stellar color and slight fading. Overall, you won't be disappointed. Unacceptable - Disney Inc.'s decision to jettison virtually all of the extras that came with the aforementioned DVD set. Dumb marketing decision. Really dumb!!! So, best advice - buy this Blu-ray for the vastly improved image quality. But keep your old Vault Disney set for the extras. Buy with confidence. Treasure forever. Did I mention?

Tommy Kirk is without a doubt one of the most natural and appealing child actors to come out of the Disney studio. This is a family film that stands the test of time. As for ""Savage Sam"", this was my first time seeing it, and it's a nice film, but without the childhood memories that ""Old Yeller"" invokes, it doesn't seem to be in the same league.",1358640000,,452,4.033333333333333

77045,5,0788812467,"I don't know about you, but I grew up on `Old Yeller'.  This is, by far, my father's favorite movie.  The only time I saw him cry while growing up was when the family sat down to watch this movie, which was actually quite often.  I remember growing tired of it, wishing that we could watch something else, but denying the power of `Old Yeller' as a whole seems foolish now.  I remember when I read the book in school and then had to watch the film afterward.  Sitting there, with the whole class and obviously separated from the treatment it received in my own home, I was able to view it without a cloud of preconceived bias.  I was eleven.  In that moment I realized WHY my dad loved this movie so much.

It speaks to you.

Bypassing the obvious clichs (yes, this movie is clichd, but not in the way you may fully expect), there is something `real' about `Old Yeller' that I still respect to this day.  Despite having the perfect `presentation' with regard to its Disney values on home life and family, there is a rugged reality that swells within each frame.  The dialog is sharp and beautifully whole, the performances are all above average when you compare to Disney `live action' films of the time, and the general progression of story is also really well handled.  The impact from that crushing finale still hits you like a ton of bricks.  For those of us who are dog people, who love our pets and consider them family, there are few films that can really capture the weight of loss that comes with that territory quite like `Old Yeller'.

So, sixteen years have passed since my eyes were opened in that classroom, and they remain open to the fact that family films rarely reach the beauty contained in `Old Yeller', a film I would be pleased to have my children `grow up on'.

And yes, as a grown man this film still makes me cry.  I guess I AM becoming my father.",1336089600,2,1872,4.3826086956521735

77062,5,0788812467,"Ah, Old Yeller. He makes Lassie look like a pansy. It's a classic ""boy and his dog"" story. A family in post-civil war Texas is trying their best to make money, and the father goes on a four month cattle drive. Young teen Travis is left in charge, and is less than thrilled when a stray dog causes his mule to destroy their fence. Much to his horror, Travis' younger brother Arless takes in the dog and names him Yeller. The boys' mother convinces Travis to give the dog a chance, and soon Yeller becomes more Travis' dog than Arless'. Throughout the movie Yeller and his family go through many dangers and adventures in the untamed west. He saves the lives of everyone in the family (and a family friend at least once) and manages to father a litter of pups. Yeller even gives the ultimate sacrifice in the movie's heartbreaking ending. It's a great movie for dog lovers of all ages.

The documentary about the actors in Old Yeller, including Spike the dog (who was actually owned/trained by the same man who trained the Lassies) is great. It was interesting to learn so much about the filming, actors, and even the book the movie is based on.

As for Savage Sam... don't even bother. I couldn't even stand to watch the whole thing it was so boring. First of all, Sam is supposed to be Yeller's son--the puppy in the first movie. However, in this Sam is some sort of hound. It looks as though it's been at least seven years since the first movie and the characters did not age well. It also does not have all the original characters/actors. But most of all, the movie is so racist against Native Americans I'm shocked Disney released it.

All in all, this is a great DVD. Old Yeller is still one of the best Human-Dog relationship movies there are, and the documentary gives lots of interesting facts about it. But... just skip Savage Sam.",1324771200,,1839,4.483582089552239

77118,2,0788812467,"Review of ""Savage Sam"".
If you have never seen ""Old Yeller"", you will not be so disappointed by ""Savage Sam"", and may enjoy it.

Dorothy McGuire and Fess Parker are noticeably absent. Beverly Washburn, the girl who played Elizabeth Searcy the daughter of the lazy neighbor is replaced by another actress breaking believability. Elizabeth's part was small but memorable, and she could not be replaced without notice, or even left out without notice. The dog is not the yellow dog pup we saw at the end of ""Old Yeller"". The film begins repeating things done in ""Old Yeller"" in an attempt to connect us to ""Old Yeller"", is really lazy trading on ""Old Yeller"" instead of coming up with something new. Disney had several of the original actors under contract, still had the cabin set, and decided to make some easy money without putting any effort into the script. Disney got away with shooting Texas in California in ""Old Yeller"", but could not get away with trying to tell us the Indians in this film are Apache and Comanche amidst California Oak trees when such Indians inhabited the red rocks of Arizona.

Kevin Corcoran was charming in earlier films ""Old Yeller"", ""Swiss Family Robinson"", ""Pollyanna"", and ""Toby Tyler"" just playing himself, and reacting as a kid his age would, but here he has grown much bigger, 6-years after the first film, and outgrown those roles. A kid his age and size in this film would respond differently. The writers here force cuteness that looks out of place. Brian Keith should have used his normal voice instead of using an odd accent for no purpose.

The writers could not successfully continue the story without Beverly Washburn who played Elizabeth, because her continuing romance with Tommy Kirk is the next logical step. Disney should have wined and dined her to get her to appear. Even a 30-second appearance by Fess Parker and Dorothy McGuire at the beginning would have helped immensely. Otherwise, Disney would have been better off putting Tommy and Kevin in an entirely different film. It is a lazy script. I heard Mr. Searcy wrote the script.

""Old Yeller"" is a great film.",1241654400,4,2115,4.818181818181818

77120,3,0788812467,"Of all the movies I saw as a young in the theaters in the 1950s, the only one that haunted me or brought tears to my eyes was this one. It made a lasting impression on everyone in our family. Not long afterward, we bought a Golden Retriever puppy and it was a fabulous dog.

After a long, long absence, I saw it for the third time in the late 1990s on VHS - the one you see pictured here.  Since I never forgot the sad ending, I was prepared for that. My attitude was great going in, especially since I had become a fan of Dorothy McGuire since her magnificent performance in ""A Tree Grows In Brooklyn.""

Anywa - to be honest - this time around I was disappointed. Yes, it was still a nice old-fashioned story but the impact was so-so and McGuire looked like she had aged 20 years since ""Brooklyn."" She didn't look like the same person from the famous 1945 drama.

Tommy Kirk went on to be a star on television and in the movies for Walt Disney while I don't believe Kevin Corcoran, who was just as good as Kirk, did a whole lot after this....some westerns into the '60s. Good 'ole ""Davy Crockett,"" Fess Parker, also is in this movie but has a minor role, being seen only in the beginning and at the end. Chuck Connors also had a small role.

A nice story, no doubt. Perhaps another viewing with lower expectations would make me rate this highly again. Just the name ""Old Yeller"" is still special to me; it just appears a bit too dated at this point.",1238371200,,1450,4.2202166064981945

77143,4,0788812467,"When I saw this double feature I could not pass up the temptation to see ""Old Yeller"" again, and ""Savage Sam"" for the first time since I saw it at the theater.  I have just finished watching them, and can state that I have no regrets purchasing this DVD.  While I have seen ""Old Yeller"" many times, it remains fresh and exciting, with all of Walt Disney's little touches to details.  Conversely, ""Savage Sam"" was actually a little better than I remember it being.

While ""Savage Sam"" is a sequel in that several of the characters were central to ""Old Yeller,"" the themes of the two movies are quite different.  ""Old Yeller"" is a wonderful story about boys and dogs; it is a story of caring and love; and it is a story of overcoming the travesties that life throws our way.  ""Savage Sam"" is a tale of life on the ""Texas frontier"" that has been portrayed many times before.  Like the dog, Sam, the characters are now older, wilder, individualistic, less caring, and angrier at the world.  While the Comanches--not Apaches as most other reviewers mistakenly refer to them as--along with ONE Apache are not completely stereotypical, they come close to it.  I should inject here that I am uncertain why there was an Apache included, as the two Nations are quite distinct and seldom interacted, let alone act in conjunction.  While it would be easy to interpret the Comanches as being cruel when they are tossing young Arliss (Kevin Corcoran) around, Travis (Tommy Kirk) is shown explaining to Lisbeth Searcy (Marta Kristen) that ""it is their way of having fun.""  This, and other attempts to partially humanize the Comanches, is why I stated above that ""Savage Sam"" was a little better than I remember: because as I remembered it, the film depicted the Comanches as completely evil.

Hence, I have given the two movies an overall rating of four stars.  Individually, ""Old Yeller"" is a five (plus) star classic that personifies Disney movies at their best; ""Savage Sam,"" on the other hand, is a two or three star movie devoid of the classic Disney nuances.  Yet they are both ""fun"" to watch--especially if one keeps in mind that ""Savage Sam"" is really a western that plays upon a Texan frontier theme of Comanches ""kidnapping"" women and children.  As such, I would recommend explaining the differences between the two films to children.

77144,5,0788812467,great movie. had never heard of savage sam.  it was also a great family movie,1217808000,,77,4.133333333333334
77145,2,0788812467,"This movie hit the theaters on Christmas Day in 1957 starring Dorothy McGuire as Katie Coates, Fess Parker as Jim Coates and Jeff York as Bud Searcy. Based on the novel by Fred Gipson, Old Yeller is set in Texas in 1869. While his father is away on a cattle drive, 15-year-old Travis Coates takes over management of the family farm. Adopting a strictly business policy, Travis is irritated when younger brother, Arliss, adopts a frisky stray dog. Soon Travis is as fond of the dog as everyone else in the family is; moreover, ""Old Yeller"" is an excellent watchdog. However, while fighting off a mad wolf, Yeller is infected with rabies. Though Yeller seems unaffected at first, he eventually behaves so viciously that the disheartened Travis has no choice but to **** *** ***. A heart-to-heart talk between Travis and his returning father coupled with the adoption of a new pup, paves the way to an emotional but reasonably happy ending. Earning eight million dollars domestically on its first release, Old Yeller convinced Walt Disney to devote more and more time to live-action films and less time to animation, which at the time was a great business move. In 1963, Disney released a lesser sequel to Old Yeller titled Savage Sam. I was wasn't that crazy about this picture either. To me once the dog got in the fight the movie was over. I give this movie Two-weasel stars because there was not much drama or action in this movie other then the fight with the wolf.",1215129600,,1467,4.689922480620155
77156,5,0788812467,"When I watched Old Yeller a few years ago, I had not seen it for many years. I had completely forgotten how powerful it was and was completely blown away by it's brilliance! One of Disney's finest! This film has stood the test of time incredibly well and, in fact, is probably only more powerful now than when it was first released. Superbly scripted, sensitively directed, and loaded with power packed performances! Simplistic and sincere, honest and real. Old Yeller plays like a breath of fresh air, making most movies of today look like cinematic smog.

Perfectly cast, with fine, first rate performances. Tommy Kirk gives the standout performance of his career! Completely convincing, he brings an authenticity and genuineness to his character, in this most challenging of roles, as he runs the gamut of human emotions. Dorothy McGuire is perfect as Katie Coates, bringing a gentleness and warmth to the role of the mother. Not to be over-shadowed though, Kevin Corcoran gives an outstandingly astounding performance, especially for one so young, as the youngest member of the Coates family, Arliss. Jeff York, as always, is a delight, injecting some light-hearted humor into his role. And while Fess Parker may not have a great deal of on screen time, his performance is played with great sincerity, strength, and warmth. Rounding out the cast, with fine performances, are Beverly Washburn and Chuck Conners. Not forgetting scene-stealing Spike the dog, who is totally charming and completely disarming in the title role.

More than just a story about a boy and his dog, this is a story about life and living. About the highs and the lows, of good times and bad, of loving and losing. For me, the most memorable moment of the film is the scene towards the end, between Fess Parker and Tommy Kirk, between father and son. To quote from the film, ""Well, now and then, for no good reason a man can figure out, life will just haul off, and knock him flat. Slam him again' the ground so hard it seems like all his insides is busted. But it's not all like that. A lot of it's mighty fine. And you can't afford to waste the good part frettin' about the bad. That makes it all bad."" To me, this sums up the heart of the movie, and is one of the most touching and moving moments in motion picture history.

This is certainly one of Disney's best movies of all time. Endearingly enduring, it remains great wholesome family viewing. A must see for everyone!

77160,5,0788812467,"Shortly after Jim Coates leaves his wife and two young sons alone on their Texas frontier homestead to go on a cattle drive, the family takes in a large, thieving, stray, yellow dog as pet and protector. The story follows the time of Jim's absence and Old Yeller's stay, as the endearing dog takes on the roles of play-pal to little Arliss and chore partner to teenage Travis, and fights off dangerous animals to protect them all, putting himself in great danger. However, with the closeness of animals to the lives of American frontier-folk, diseases like rabies prove to be just as looming a threat, as the Coates family comes to learn in one of the most heart-wrenching endings in both literary and cinematic history.

""Old Yeller"" is a masterpiece of filmmaking and definitely among the finest work from the Walt Disney Studios to date. The tale is plain and simple, softer than the famous Fred Gipson book it was based on but extremely loyal at the same time, and easily one of the greatest coming-of-age tales of love and loss ever written or filmed. Painstaking detail was put into recreating life on the Texas frontier in this Disney classic, and though it was released in 1957, claims that the film is loaded with 50's sensibilities may be a bit unjust. This film is set shortly after the Civil War, not in modern day. Having things like the man being ""head of the household"" or ""breadwinner"" aren't always just 50's sensibilities. Anyway, if one takes a good look at Disney films of the time, one might be surprised to find that the Disney films often depict more believable families than what you'd see on television sitcoms and other films of the period. ""Old Yeller"" doesn't fall short in that area either. There are only seven human members to the cast, and all are outstanding (most Disney regulars) in strong, believable roles. Tommy Kirk (The Shaggy Dog, The Misadventures of Merlin Jones, The Hardy Boys, Swiss Family Robinson) is the human lead as Travis Coates, the young teenager who grows closest to ""Old Yeller"" and is hurt the most when the dog meets his emotional and legendary end. Kevin ""Moochie"" Corcoran (The Shaggy Dog, Swiss Family Robinson, Toby Tyler) is little brother Arliss, a feisty little boy who throws rocks and never sits still. Dorothy McGuire (Swiss Family Robinson, Summer Magic) is the ever motherly Katie Coates, and Disney legend Fess Parker (Davy Crockett, The Great Locomotive Chase) rounds out the family as fatherly and loving Jim Coates. The always hilarious Jeff York plays lazy, meal-mooching neighbor Bud Searcy, with Beverly Washburn as his sweet and put-upon daughter with a crush on young Travis. The final human castmember is the well-known Chuck Connors, who plays Old Yeller's original owner and a kind visitor to the Coates' farmstead. Throw in Spike the dog as the title character, no less impressive an actor than any of them, and you have one of Hollywood's greatest casts! Not to mention that this was directed by Robert Stevenson (Mary Poppins, Darby O'Gill and the Little People, The Love Bug), one of Hollywood's all-time greatest directors! No, there's really nothing much corny or extremely '""50's"" about this movie, if that's what you've been led to believe, aside from the ""Old Yeller"" theme song, though us Disney fanatics rather like it. It's wonderfully sung by Jerome Courtland (Disney's Andy Burnett).

As for the DVD edition, the 2-disc Vault Disney release (now out of print) is a real triumph! Disc One includes two bonuses in addition to the beautiful widescreen presentation of the film: A delightful Pluto Cartoon, ""Bone Trouble,"" in which Pluto's attempt to swipe Butch's bone breakfast leads him to be chased into a hall of mirrors, and an excellent audio commentary (featuring Kevin Corcoran, Fess Parker, dog-trainer Bob Weatherwax, and more than anyone, Tommy Kirk; it seems that Kevin and Parker were recorded separately). In addition, the DVD menus look great. Disc Two's amazing Vault Disney menu is loaded with goodies. There's, ""Old Yeller: Remembering a Classic,"" a lengthy making-of documentary full of tear-jerking interviews with the surviving cast-members along with animal trainer Bob Weatherwax and T. Beck Gipson, the son of writer Fred Gipson. There's also a nearly 15 minute featurette titled, ""Conversations with Tommy Kirk."" This is an enjoyable, in-depth interview with Tommy about how he got into acting as a child, met Walt Disney, and various details about his career at the Disney studios, including an unfortunate misunderstanding with Fred MacMurray. There are a couple of montages too. One is a bit of a commercial really, and doesn't have much value. It's called ""Dogs!,"" and is nothing but a fast-paced montage of Disney dog clips. The other montage is more appreciated. It's called ""Disney Studio Album,"" and is a montage of Disney events of 1957. A sort of Disney video yearbook. ""Lost Treasures: Ranch of the Golden Oak"" is a guided tour of the California property where many films are still filmed, along with reminiscence from Old Yeller's cast members of course. A Production Archive on Disc Two is loaded with galleries in the categories of ""Production Stills,"" ""Publishing,"" ""Advertising,"" ""Screenplay Excerpt,"" ""Documents,"" and ""Biographies"" (of everyone but Jeff York for some reason). There's also a slideshow titled ""Production Gallery,"" though it just features some selections from the Production Stills gallery. The DVD also offers the original theatrical trailer, a 90's TV commercial for a TV airing, and another tear-jerker labeled, ""News Segment: Old Yeller Memorial."" This is a report on an Old Yeller statue dedication in writer Fred Gipson's hometown and focuses on his son. Laura Bush also gives a speech at this sentimental ceremony. What non-Texan folks might not know is that this isn't really a news segment, it's from an excellent Texas television program called ""Texas Country Reporter."" It's a long running show that is not unlike ""Made In America"" or other such shows on the more educational/informative cable channels like TLC, Travel Channel, or Food Network, just a little more down-homey. Also on Disc Two is a virtual jukebox featuring various audio explorations. There are two interactive Sound Studio experiences, a selection of Radio Spots, a Foley Demonstration, and a vintage ""Old Yeller"" record album story told by Fess Parker with dialogue from the film. Last, but certainly not least, one of my favorite types of extras to find on a Disney DVD, we get a complete episode of the Disneyland TV series! The episode, hosted by Walt, is ""The Best Doggone Dog in the World."" This treat shows us dogs of the world, introduces Dorothy McGuire talking about the film ""Old Yeller"" and narrating clips, and presents to us a ""True-Life Adventure"" type story about Arizona sheepdogs at work. A wonderful addition to a wonderful DVD release!

Ya know, I gotta say, as much as I love the Disney Renaissance period of films like ""The Little Mermaid,"" ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids,"" and so on, whenever I am walking around a Disney theme park and taking in the sights, sounds, and smells, it's films like this that really come to mind for me. The company still churns out some gems now and then, but Walt's legacy is the work the studio made under his guidance, and it really is at least as good as anything made after he was gone. Walking down nostalgic Main Street or anywhere else in the Magic Kingdom, I love having films like ""The Happiest Millionaire,"" Pollyanna,"" ""Swiss Family Robinson,"" and ""Old Yeller"" to look back on, and it's a shame that more young people aren't exposed to such films today. Thank goodness they're available on DVD for those who care enough to purchase them. Of course, as I mentioned, this Vault Disney 2-disc release is no longer in print and recently has become difficult to find. As with a few other excellent Disney releases, they have been recently rereleased in double feature editions, sometimes still in 2-disc sets, but usually missing some very nice extras. In Old Yeller's case, the film has been released on another 2-disc set, this time paired with its underrated sequel, ""Savage Sam."" While it's a fine way to acquire ""Savage Sam"" if you don't have it yet, I still recommend seeking out the Vault Disney edition if you don't yet have ""Old Yeller."" All the double feature lacks is the audio commentary, but for me that was reason enough to seek out the Vault Disney release. I will probably get the double-feature anyway to acquire ""Savage Sam"" though.",1189555200,,8536,4.967832167832168

77162,5,0788812467,"I fell in love with this movie many years ago as a kid, and it still remains a treasured classic in my heart.  This movie embodied more than just the heart-warming love between a boy and his dog who've been through thick and thin together.  What this movie embodies is old American values, things we barely see anymore in today's society.  I loved seeing a woman worry about her husband who was about to go off on a three-month long cow drive.  I liked that men acknowledged young Travis's delegated authority to be in charge of the house while his father was away.  They did their part by grooming him and helping him to be a man.  You could also tell who was worthless.

Yes, Old Yeller was more than just a movie about a young man and his dog. It was about a young man becoming a man by making one of the toughest decisions in his life at a very young age.  As Fess Parker's character at the end of the movie says to Travis, ""That's pretty rough son, but I'm proud of how my boy handled the situation.  I couldn't ask much more of a man.""

77180,4,0788812467,"Life was tough in the old west.  There were wild critters, Native Americans (annoyed that someone was taking their land, again), insufficient rain, the lecherous fat guy looking to mooch your food, and hydrophoby (hydrophobia, also known as rabies).  Yep, life was tough in the old west.  But no problem, Katie Coates (classy actor Dorothy McGuire who appeared in numerous roles in movies such as ""Friendly Persuasion,"" ""Swiss Family Robinson,"" and ""Summer Magic"") manages to survive everything with the support of son Travis (Disney regular Tommy Kirk).  Katie needed help because her other son Arliss (Kevin Corcoran, another Disney regular) was an obnoxious brat.

Father Jim Coates (Fess Parker, who was already a huge success in Disney's Davy Crockett shows) goes on a trip, leaving Katie, Travis and Arliss to fend for themselves.  Before long a big yellow dog shows up, much to Arliss's delight.  Initially Travis resents the dog because it causes him a lot of work when the dog causes destruction on the farm.  However, the big yellow dog is friendly and manages to save Arliss's life.  Old Yeller even wins Travis's love.

Much of this movie is a comedy.  Arliss and Old Yeller keep us entertained with their antics.  Old Yeller is so big and lovable that you have to laugh sometimes.  Old Yeller is also very protective of his new family.

As I said before, life is tough in the old west.  Wild animals existed all around the Coates homestead.  One day a wolf attacks the family.  The only thing that saves the family is the big yellow dog.  Katie quickly realizes that the wolf had rabies, and she pens Old Yeller up to learn whether the wolf has given Old Yeller rabies.

I leave you to watch the end of the movie for yourself.

""Old Yeller"" is one of those movies that deliberately tugs at your heartstrings.  Even I struggled to keep my eyes from watering when Travis faced Old Yeller in the shed.  However, Disney movies nearly always end with a message of hope and love, and so does this one.

Sometimes it feels good to have your emotions manipulated, even if you are sad for a little while.  This movie does it so well that you may want to watch it twice in a row.

77183,5,0788812467,"""Old Yeller"" is, simply put, one of the greatest films (and books) ever laid on celluloid.  If you're unfamiliar with the story, you don't know what you are missing.  ""Old Yeller"" tells the story of two boys (expertly played by Tommy Kirk and Kevin Corcoran) who stay on their Texas farm with their mother while their father (Fess Parker) goes on a cattle drive.  Yeller shows up and gives the elder brother, Travis Coates (Kirk), quite a bit of trouble until the dog proves his worth by saving everyone in the Coates family in one way or another.  Of course, the ending of this heartwarming film is perhaps one of the most depressing in cinematic history, and Tommy Kirk handles his emotions onscreen to perfection.

""Savage Sam,"" which is sort of a sequel to ""Old Yeller"" since it has Travis and little brother Arliss in it, not to mention two other memorable characters (which I'll get to later).  In it, Sam is the Coates' new dog and much like Yeller, he's smart, brave, and manages to get into trouble often.  Unlike ""Old Yeller,"" which was more of a study in the relationship between a young boy and his dog, ""Savage Sam"" plays out more like a Western adventure, full of Injun fightin', cowboys, and even a touch of romance.  Travis, Arliss, and their friend, Lisbeth Searcy (Marta Kristen of ""Lost In Space"") are captured by a band of Apache warriors who plan to do who knows what to them.  The Coates' uncle Beck (Brian Keith), Mr. Searcy (Jeff York) from the first film, and a gang that includes, among others, Slim Pickens and Dewey Martin, head out to save the kids.  Along the way they pick up Sam, who was thought to be dead.  Eventually, Sam picks up the kids' trail and he leads our heroes to the three captives.  The ending of this film is a lot happier than ""Old Yeller,"" but that ol' yeller dog set the bar so high that most will consider ""Savage Sam"" inferior to it.  That's a fair statement, but there are few films out there that aren't inferior to ""Old Yeller.""

Bud Searcy (Jeff York) almost manages to steal both of these films.  His proud, lazy, and ""always around about dinner time"" character is easily the funniest in the lot.  Tommy Kirk and Kevin Corcoran act well beyond their young years should allow in this film.  Kirk is especially good at conveying the heartwrenching emotions that he feels as he puts Old Yeller to rest.  Beverly Washburn portrays young Lisbeth Searcy in ""Old Yeller,"" but she didn't return for ""Savage Sam.""  No reason is given, but Marta Kristen fills the role nicely and the character gets a considerable amount of screen time in ""Sam.""

The DVD extras are very nice.  ""Bone Trouble"" is a Disney short in which Pluto has a run-in with a neighbor dog over a bone in a mirror funhouse.  It's a nice addition to this set.  The real gems here are the features on Don Gipson, author of both ""Old Yeller"" and ""Savage Sam.""  Gipson's son is interviewed on the day that Yeller and Travis are to be enshrined in front of the local library in Mason, TX, where the Gipson clan is from.  There's also interviews with the cast in recent years about the making of the film.  In it, Dorothy McGuire, Chuck Connors and Jeff York are fondly remembered by the rest of the original cast.  There's also an intimate look at the Disney film life of Tommy Kirk.

""Old Yeller"" is a must-have for any true fan of film and/or Disney.  It's a Western tale that rivals ""Shane"" as one of the greatest Westerns of all time.  ""Savage Sam"" is also a delight to have, and I'm glad it's included on this disk.

Also this movie may have been much better if the acting had be decent. The acting of the boy made me laugh instead of cry when the dog died.

77198,5,0788812467,"Disney has done outstanding films about a boy and his dog - Old Yeller tops them all, including Lassie w/Roddy McDowell.  And this DVD set comes with a second disc filled with an array of quick dog flicks coupled with interviews of people in the dog flick business.

This 1957 movie is set in pre-Civil War America and centers around a frontier family whose ""Pa"" (played by Fess Parker) heads out on a cattle drive and leaves his eldest son, Travis, (is he only twelve?) in charge of ""Ma"" and his little brother Arliss.  The boy feels like the odd one out with his little brother getting all the attention, until a stray yellow dog turns up.  Travis and Old Yeller become best friends.

Old Yeller wins the rest of the family over too by saving Arliss from a bear, saving the sweet corn from raccoons, and protecting Travis from wild hogs.  The hog fight leaves both boy and dog with flesh wounds from their frightful encounter and everyone worried whether either of the two would come down with rabies.  However, they both recover without incident.

Then Old Yeller has a run-in with a wolf.  Soon after, Old Yeller is frothing at the mouth trying to get out of the shed that Travis put him in as a precaution.  Travis keeps telling his mother that Old Yeller will get better.  But Old Yeller becomes so sick and so out his mind, that Travis has to become a man and put his best friend out of his misery.

77199,5,0788812467,"A pair of delightful, classic (in the classic sense of the word) Disney animal stories, and nobody did animal stories betters than Disney.  OLD YELLER and SAVAGE SAM are a couple of family safe gems.

 OLD YELLER (1957) is the story of a big, barrel chested, half-lab half-mastiff and all big yellow haired mongrel who adopts himself into a farm family some time shortly after the American Civil War, somewhere deep in the heart of rural Texas.  As the story opens Pa (Fess Parker) is leaving for the summer to drive and sell cattle for some much needed cash money, leaving Ma (Dorothy McGuire,) teenage son Travis (Tommy Kirk) and six-year-old son Arliss (Kevin Corcoran) to tend the farm in his absence.  No sooner has Pa disappeared over the hill when a big yellow dog explodes on the scene, scaring the plowing mule and, a bit later, stealing a hank of middling meat.  Travis wants to kill him, for young Arliss it's love at first sight.  Old Yeller's status is a little shaky until Arliss, one of those kids whose pockets have to be emptied of garter snakes and horny toads before he's allowed into the cabin, starts playing with a young bear cub far enough away from the cabin to make human rescue impossible.  The mama bear and Old Yeller gallop onto the scene at about the same time, and their confrontation is quite exciting.  The rescue is enough for the family to accept Yeller into the fold, and in return Yeller will save everyone in the family's lives at least once.  Anyone whose read Fred Gipson's novel of the same name will be prepared for the serious trouble when `the hydrophoby' hits the valley.  To its credit Disney doesn't rewrite the tragic ending.  Gipson, by the way, also is credited as the screenwriter.

 SAVAGE SAM (1963), another Gipson dog story, revisits the Coates family five years on.  Kirk and Corcoran, both five years older, are back as Travis and Arliss.  This time Ma and Pa are off visiting Ma's sick mother, Uncle Beck (Brian Keith) drops in on the boys now and then, and the family dog is now Savage Sam, a hound dog (mainly hound, something else is mixed in his blood.) Sam can track just about anything, which comes in handy when he and Arliss go off chasing a egg-stealing bobcat and along with Travis and young Lisbeth Searcy (Marta Kristen,) are kidnapped by a horse-stealing band of Apaches.  Sam is hit over the head and left for dead.  Sam recovers, though, Uncle Beck organizes a chase party (including Royal Dano, Dewey Martin, and Slim Pickens) and sets out after the kidnapped children.  Ultimately, a left-for-dead Travis and a groggy but enthusiastic Sam join the posse.

 OLD YELLER is the big `un in this two-pack, but I enjoyed SAVAGE SAM nearly as much.  It's an exciting chase movie, and it doesn't plumb the tragic depths its predecessor does.

The bonus disk contains a number of specials. A 35-minute special entitled ""Old Yeller: Remembering a Classic,"" a 2002 talking head documentary featuring a number of the remaining stars (Kirk, Corcoran, Parker, etc.) recalling the making of the movie.  Interesting if not deeply informative.  A 15-minute ""Conversation with Tommy Kirk"" pretty much explains it all, with the nearing-60 Kirk recalling his work with Disney.  ""Ranch of the Golden Oaks"" is a 7-minute short about the ranch on which OLD YELLER was filmed - had kind of an infomercial feel to it.  There's a short feature with Gipson's son celebrating the unveiling of an Old Yellow (and Travis) statue in a small town in Texas.  A rebroadcast of a television episode of The Wonderful World of Disney from 1957 entitled `The Best Doggoned Dog in the World"" devoted to, you guessed it, dogs.  I don't remember seeing the animated short `Bone Trouble,' but navigating Disney's special feature disks is tricky sometimes.  The specials were enjoyable enough, gently selling Disney products, emphasizing Old Yeller and pretty much ignoring Savage Sam.

 I'd recommend these without hesitation, but the presence of horse stealing, kidnapping indians in SAVAGE SAM is a little beyond the politically correct pale.  Even though the kidnappers include a brave who steps in to protect the children a few times, the overall impression is that of scary, lawless savages.  Those sensitive to such portrayals may want to watch SAVAGE SAM first before sitting down to it with the whole family.",1145145600,30,4349,4.824561403508772

77201,5,0788812467,"""Old Yeller"" is one of my favorite Disney live-action films.  Tommy Kirk and Kevin Corcoran play brothers with parents, Fess Parker and Dorothy McGuire on the western frontier.  The father is going away on a cattle drive and tells his oldest son, Travis (Tommy Kirk) that he might bring him back a horse.  Travis and Arliss (Kevin Corcoran) are at odds throughout the picture, as Travis works hard on fencing and plowing, and Arliss mostly plays and cuts up.  The mother usually takes Arliss' side reminding Travis that Arliss is ""just a little boy.""  During this, a yellow stray dog takes up residence with the family and Arliss is thrilled.  Travis eventually comes to love the dog too, as he proves himself worthy by keeping raccoons out of the garden's corn and helping to save young Arliss from a vicious bear.  As the story progresses, Travis decides to take Old Yeller along to help him mark some wild hogs.  A local neighbor warns the family of the spread of rabies in some near-by communities and cautions Travis to be careful of the hogs.  During the hog marking, Travis is pulled into the herd of hogs and his leg is badly injured.  Old Yeller is also injured by the hogs fury and both dog and boy are taken home to recover.  Travis recovers well, and it seems Old Yeller has escaped any possible threat of rabies, as well.  Many reviewers have told of their dismay of Old Yeller's fate, and the following events that lead to Travis becoming responsible enough to do what has to be done.  I find the story true to life and what it must have been like to face unfavorable circumstances while trying to make it on the west's frontier.  All in all, ""Old Yeller"" is a wonderful film and very entertaining.  I highly recommend it , as well as the splendid sequel, ""Savage Sam.""  The dvd plays well, however, the picture is more grainy than I remember seeing it when aired on television.  The second disc is loaded with extras and are very enjoyable.  I've not seen the new two-movie release of ""Old Yeller"" and ""Savage Sam,"" however, I'd like to know if the quality of the picture of ""Old Yeller"" has in any way been restored?  Walt Disney left us with a vast library of wonderful films, and this is one of his best!

Newer Disney movies seldom have animals that appear to suffer.  And why not?  What is more natural.  People suffer and die.  Animals suffer and die. Welcome to our world.  That is what drives us to realize our own frailities and own humanity.  And that should drive us to look to our Maker.  To seek after His mercy and connection and forgiveness in our Savior.

Enjoy the movie, but with young children, please talk with them before and after.  What does it all mean.  What is  life. What is death.  What is our purpose in this world. What is our responsibility to others and to animals.  God cares just as much for them as he does for us.  So, discuss it with Children.  No, this is not a movie for Barney-aged children.

The ""Vault Disney"" releases are promoted as ""high end"", supposedly better than the cheapy ""movie-only"" releases of many of Disney's live action movies.
From the initial opening credits, with the worst example I have seen of ""grain"" in a picture outside of a non-major-studio release, I knew this was going to be another Disney disaster. Though the grain subsided SOMEWHAT, the softness of the picture throughout was not even close to what I would expect of a classic movie release. While my widescreen television is relatively small, I'd hate to see how bad this picture would look on a large widescreen display.
In addition, the chintzy packaging for these movies is hardly up to ""special edition"" quality either, and the majority of the extras are nothing more than more ""Disney"" horn-blowing.

For children who need confidence to face the difficulties of life, this story is extraordinarily well suited to children who need heroes.

77236,2,0788812467,"Old Yeller"" is the heart-wrenching family drama about two brothers, Travis (Tommy Kirk) and Arliss Coates (Kevin Corcoran) and their faithful golden retriever - Yeller.  When the boys' father, Jim (Fess Parker) leaves on an expedition, mother Katie (Dorothy McGuire) becomes the head of the household. This is one of Disney's first attempts at capturing the great outdoors and vitality of the old frontier plains and it is one of their enduring live action masterpieces. Arliss is always getting into trouble - engaging wild bears and skunks and other critter in the brush, only to be saved in the nick of time by Yeller. However, when Yeller contracts rabies it is left up to Travis to do the humane thing and put his best friend out of misery. Upon its initial release the film did phenomenal box office. And there are still those who get a lump in their throats and a tear in their eye when this heartbreaking family drama and coming of age flick is mentioned in mixed company.

Unfortunately for DVD-philes, this isn't Disney's best despite being advertised as part of their new 2-disc ""Vault Disney"" series. In fact, visually it's not even close to what a film like ""Old Yeller"" truly deserves. For starters, the print used to master this DVD is very softly focused while still managing to be riddled with edge enhancement, aliasing and shimmering of fine details. There's a lot of pixelization throughout that really breaks up fine detail. Color is poorly balanced, betraying the lushness of many of the outdoor scenes, with greens, in grass and trees shifting color from brownish beige to muddy beige and then back again. Flesh tones are never natural but appear too, too orange. Fine detail is generally lost in the darker scenes. The audio has been remixed to stereo but is very, very strident and forward sounding. At times it's painful on the ears and really doesn't hold in comparison to the fidelity of the period.

Disney does gets top marks for their supplemental materials. We get documentaries, isolated scores, vintage advertising and short subjects, a gallery of stills, trailers and television spots and interviews with the surviving cast members. What more could anybody ask for? A better print of the film, sadly!",1051228800,16,2235,4.923076923076923
77237,5,0788812467,"The DVD treatment of this film is also the way a classic should be treated. Disney pulled out all the stops for the DVD's in their new ""Vault Disney Collection"" which has 4 different releases as of 1/29/03. I have always loved this movie, and you can read all the great things about the film itslef from other reviewers and from the vhs reviews. I want to talk about the DVD treatment. First and most importantly it's WIDESCREEN, maybe for the first time outside of a theatre. What a difference it makes, the film is beautiful in its scope as it was originally intended.

EXTRAS!! Read all about it!
There are about 3 hours worth of incredible extra material here. To find all of the extras is not easy, so make sure you poke around and push on every icon (especially arrows) you can and be sure to even pursue the items that do not sound interesting to you since they can in turn lead to yet another submenu of goodies.
The 2 disc set has much more than is listed here or even on the packaging itself. One of the best bonus features is a complete vintage episode of the Walt Disney television show from 1957, the episode called, ""Best Doggone Dog in the West"". It has half the episode devoted to a  behind the scenes promotion of the film, featuring Dorothy McGuire as our narrator. The other half had a great old featurette called ""Arizona Sheepdog"", that ran in theatres in 1955 before a main feature. (TRIVIA not on this set - this episode was altered in 1961 for its rerun, and the Old Yeller segment was replaced with a 101 Dalmations segment.)

 Several featurettes and archive Galleries with studio fan cards, costume design sketches, lobby cards, invitations, film production letterhead, posters, magazine ads, screenplay, and the complete exhibitors campaign book; Audio features with production photos and behind the scenes shots with the sounds of Radio Spots from the original release, two songs, a foley sound effects demonstration, and 2 interactive ""Sound Studio"" demonstrations. Also more production archives; included is the fan letters sent to Gibson the author; a news story from TV about the unveiling of the memorial to Old Yeller in Gibsons home town, which Disney studio participated in; a documeentary on the writer; a short new video called ""Dogs"" ; recent interviews with cast members;

My favorite, a nice featurette giving us a first ever rare glimpse of the famous ""Golden Oak Movie Ranch"" owned by Disney where this film and so many others were filmed. I had always wanted to see it and my wish finally came true. Another feature is the 1961 Disney Studio Album which is a photo album/video showcasing everything the Disney Studio created in 1957 from Parks, to TV, to film. A really neat extra is the actual complete recording of the original ""Old Yeller"" storybook LP album released as merchandising, narrated by Fess Parker. Next there is yet another documentary on the making of the film.

Also included here as a big bonus is the original theatrical Pluto cartoon ""Bone Trouble"" released along with the Old Yeller in 1957, so you can see it the way you did back when. Show the kids the way it used to be, when you went to the movies and you saw more fun stuff than just commercials before the main feature.

I challenge anyone to watch this without getting caught up in the story, or to keep from singing the great title song. All ages truly love this family film. The book that the story is based on by Gibson will long be remembered as a classic. Disney respected the book in their film, and made a movie that is many great things.

Thank you!, whoever at Disney pushed to treat this DVD like this. The extras have caused me to rave about the Vault Disney series to everyone I know and buy extra copies for my loved ones as Christmas presents. I hope all Disney fans buy tons of these so Disney understands it is worth putting the extra work into a DVD. If I could give it 10 stars I would, well worth the price!",1043798400,27,3950,4.5929078014184395
77238,5,0788812467,"The added feature at the end of the film about the making of Old Yeller is wonderful. Fess Parker(the father) and Tommy Kirk (Travis) talk about their experiences making the film as well as other information on the making of the film such as how the sound effects were made and how the part of Yeller was cast.
The film follows very closely Fred Gipson's book.
This refers to the 40th anniversary edition.",1043712000,,405,4.561643835616438
77239,4,0788812467,"I hadn't watched this movie for many years, but I still remembered the basic story as I watched it again recently trying to get my 18 month old to be interested in the big yellow dog, the horses, cows and pigs.  She was only vaguely interested.  It is hard for this type of movie to compete with Toy Story and other modern movies that start and finish with lots of action and special effects.
But the story here, a well done coming of age story, is timeless and classic and well worth sitting down with the kids and a bucket of popcorn to watch.  There are lots of things this kind of movie can bring for topics of discussion, and unless one has seen it a few times, the emotional parts should stir up at least some feelings (even for non dog lovers).
I give a strong recommendation for this movie, it is a simple and straight forward story, and what it lacks in action and effects, it makes up for in it's timelessness and powerful story line.",1038182400,,944,4.292134831460674
77240,5,0788812467,"Old Yeller is as wonderful and colorful here as ever, but what distinguishes this DVD for the real fans and for the new viewers alike are the extras.  Older viewers who grew up with the cast in this movie as well as the Mickey Mouse Club (Tommy Kirk, Kevin ""Moochie"" Corcoran), Davy Crocket (Fess Parker), and other movies (Dorothy Maguire) will be thrilled to see their ""friends"" in outtakes and (all but Dorothy Maguire, who has passed on) reunion discussions.  The making-of stuff is newly-produced and wonderfully insightful for old-time Disney fans.
Newer fans will like other features as well, including a featurette on the ""Golden Oak Ranch,"" the Disney-owned ranch where it was filmed.  It was cool to learn about all the movies (Disney and non-Disney alike) that have been filmed there, and continue to be.
They really went all-out on the DVD.  I agree with all of the previous positive reviews of the film itself.  It still stands up.  But I just wanted to point out the wonderful extras on the DVD!  Good show!",1037577600,6,1021,4.767045454545454
77241,1,0788812467,"Yes, most of the reason this movie is popular is because of the overrated dramatic death scene at the end, when I first saw it, it wasn't sad at all to me, so buy the DVD or VHS because it's a good movie not because of Old Yeller's demise!",1035849600,2,239,3.8979591836734695
