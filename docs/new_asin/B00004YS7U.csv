7927477,5,B00004YS7U,"This is an outstanding visual tour of Yellowstone National Park.  The video presentation is superb, probably the best of any travel or nature video I've seen.  It's easy to understand why Tom Murphy is an ""award winning videographer"".
Take note, however, that this is not really a ""travel"" video.  There are no tips for planning lodging, tours, activities, etc.  There are also no campy ""reenactments"" or kitschy nostalgia segments like I've encountered on other videos in this category.  The DVD extra's are limited to Screensavers and a calendar that did not work on my WinME system.
The emphasis is obviously on the 35 minute visual presentation.  The pace is modest, segueing gently from one beautiful view to the next, accompanied by a pleasant soundtrack mixed with ambient sounds.  DISCOVERING YELLOWSTONE does a great job of showing the diversity of Yellowstone.  While geysers and thermal pools are included the mountains, waters and wildlife of the park are better represented than is sometimes the case.
The audio commentary is quite sparse - there is dialogue for perhaps 15-20% of the total running time.  Fortunately the editors also included quite a few captions identifying various landmarks, so it's possible to enjoy the view without those nagging ""where IS that, I wonder"" questions.
This DVD is probably best suited to those who have already visited Yellowstone and want to relive the experience.  For those planning their first trip, or just curious about the world's first National Park, DISCOVERING YELOWSTONE does a excellent job of presenting the many visual wonders of Yellowstone.",1023148800,22,1607,5.217898832684825
