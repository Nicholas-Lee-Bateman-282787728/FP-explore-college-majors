3103355,4,B0013D8L86,I saw this movie on the Sci-Fi Channel yesterday and I thought it was fairly entertaining.  Nice suspense and not bad effects.  Good shots of the bear and not such a bad story.  A group of teens doing stupid things and how they must pay for their actions in the end.  Enjoy the suspense!,1206921600,5,287,4.2592592592592595

3103366,4,B0013D8L86,Overall and okay movie the plot was very good low budget film though so you know if your into low budget and movie about grizzly bear attacks check it out it is at a great price and and alright movie,1479340800,,199,4.0
3103367,1,B0013D8L86,"Four dopey kids ignore several no trespassing signs and run over a grizzly bear cub.  The mother, who obviously wasn't watching her kid, goes after the four idiots with a vengeance.  After that they continue to drive recklessly, continue to crash and wreck the jeep several times, run and run and run some more.  The bear finally shows up (on occasion) in extreme close-ups.  There are no thrills but plenty of spills.  The kids get weepy a couple of times in the middle of the crisis to chatter about their misspent youth.  The radiator wasn't the only thing cracked................  And insult to injury, some nitwit decides to cram in a couple of ill-fitting songs just because!  The funniest, unintentionally funny scene, has one of the dopey kids running for help because they cant get any cell phone reception.  He stops at an abandoned building and slowly-slowly snoops through the place poking at things in bottles.  As though he had a limited attention span and totally forgot what he was supposed to be doing!  The biggest offense is that all four kids are unremittingly obnoxious and unlikable.  If the bear didn't get to them fast enough I was more than willing to tell it where they were hiding!  This non-horror horror movie wasn't just bad, it was pitiful.

The bear was very believable though, except that this mother bear was played by a male grizzly bear called Koda.  To get him to open his mouth and look menacing they fed him marshmallows.  I would have considered feeding him the so-called actors.........who never actually ever appeared with Koda onscreen!",1476576000,,1579,4.857677902621723
3103368,2,B0013D8L86,"One of the earlier entries in the 'Maneater Series' Grizzly Rage is strictly by-the-numbers TV. A group of recent graduates ventures out for some reason or other and decide to detour somewhere remote. Why they do this is never clear, partly because the very dated music is too loud over the actors' voices. Anyway, after breaking into someone's property they run over a bear cub and unleash the wrath of the cub's mother.

There were a number of plot points raised that were never explored and I gathered they were used just to advance the story rather than add any real value. It was a waste as the film ends with an obvious conclusion but a whole load of questions about what else was going on.

Of course, I'm over-analysing this. The film was meant to be a budget timewaster and I guess it meets that brief. But at the end of the day if you never see this film you haven't missed anything.",1475366400,,893,4.439024390243903

3103381,2,B0013D8L86,"This movie could justifiably also be called ""The Idiot's Guide to Dying in the Wilderness"".  It is chock full of excellent examples of things you should never, ever do...

1) Never drive off into the boonies with a bunch of morons, none of whom have bothered to tell another living soul where you're going.

2) Never drive your vehicle 80 mph through rough, dense, unfamiliar terrain--especially if there are bound to be trees in the way.

3) Never, ever, EVER run over a bear cub.  And definitely don't go back, touch the dead body, and leave your shirt lying next to the carcass, thereby enabling the enraged mother bear to more easily pick up your scent.

4) Never split up and go wandering through the woods when a killer mother bear is on the hunt and just waiting for a chance to go medieval on your butt.

5) If you do happen to get injured, never expect friends like these to help you.  They will either abandon you like yesterday's trash while trying to save their own skins, or do more harm than good with their non-existent medical ""skills"".

6) Never stupidly assume that placing a wimpy, old wagon wheel in front of a cabin door is going to stop a full-sized, raging grizzly bear.  Bears never fall for that stuff anyway.

7) And, lastly, never pick up a movie like this expecting award-winning acting, special effects, and storyline...it ain't gonna happen.

Ultimately, this is a mildly entertaining show, as it's at least good for a laugh.  Nobody here will win any awards for acting, although their characters all certainly qualify for Darwin Awards as their stupidity and unwavering determination to self-destruct are truly awe-inspiring.  No, it's definitely not the best movie I've ever seen, but it isn't the absolute worst either.  For those who are into the ""Maneater Series"" flicks, I would personally recommend ""Croc"", as it was the best I have seen so far.  Alternatively, for anyone interested in realistic re-creations of actual animal attacks, ""Your Worst Animal Nightmares"" is very good.",1379030400,,2017,4.819767441860465
3103382,1,B0013D8L86,"We start out with some fast motion cuts through traffic in some city in the Manitoba province, where four teens (played of course by early 20 somethings) are heading out to the woods for a camping trip. These people seem to forget one particular thing about the deep woods, that is that animals can go crazy, in particular mother bears when these idiot partiers accidentally kill a mother's young bear cub.

They probably should've realized the area they're partying in was fenced and closed off for a reason, but a killer mother grizzly, nah that's not a reason to worry. However in a plot twist, this bear has been drinking from a lake where lots of toxic waste dumping which makes her stronger than any other grizzly alive. Nevermind the questions of how she survived ingesting the radioactive materials.

From early on you're just rooting for the cast to get killed, they crash their jeep into a tree, one guy takes his shirt off to cover up the cub, which of course just helps the mother pick up his scent. They bring next to no water, so when they need to cool down the jeep's engine they have to separate to get this vital water. The dialogue is just beyond terrible as is the acting. The bear is the best actor in the movie, though there were some shots where an actor in a bear suit was used, so the real bear wasn't put in any danger while filming.

I'm pretty baffled how this film cost $2 million (estimated budget of course), which is a low budget for most movies, but still it looks cheaper than that. The forest shots are actually very cool looking up in the Great White North, but thats about the extent of anything positive to say about the movie. I've seen worse but the cheapness and stupidity of the characters really makes this something you slum through rather than just watch. * out of 4 stars.",1369526400,,1817,4.483383685800605
3103383,1,B0013D8L86,"And I'm not joking.  I caught this movie on television some years ago while channel surfing with my uncle.  What begins as a stupid premise created only by those with screenplay-writing credentials but none of the creativeness to back it up turns quickly into a downhill ride of stupid, stupid things.

That bear?  Clearly just a couple of bear-paw gloves some key grip picked up at a costume store in the next town.  The people who die?  I have never seen ""actors"" and movie characters so richly deserving of being mauled to death by a woodland animal.

By the end of the movie, I was glad they were all dead.  Spoiler alert.  They all die.  And it's the most redeeming thing about the movie.

Now, I am a man of Irish heritage.  I am a ginger who wears a kilt, but I have an American accent, I live in Ohio.  At the end of this movie, I was so upset that it even existed that I began to speak with an Irish lilt.  This was something new to me.  Only twice in my life, apparently this happens to me, have I been so upset that the tone of my voice took on another accent entirely.  Genetics, maybe?  I guess.

Since, I have bought this movie on DVD.  Why, you may ask yourself?  Because I threaten people with it.  Drunken nights at my apartment eventually dwindle and when I want friends out of my house, I threaten to finally, after two years, bust the DVD out of the plastic-wrap and force them to watch it.  Ten minutes later I am asleep in bed with no more guests downstairs.

So if you want an empty house, or to see if your genealogy produces any unintended side-effects brought on by spats of rabid rage, this movie is 5-stars.  Otherwise, spend money on something that won't make you want to swallow a bullet.",1365984000,,1718,4.313479623824452

3103386,3,B0013D8L86,"2007's ""Grizzly Rage"" would have worked as a one-hour TV show (with commercials), but not as it is, an 86-minute film.

This is a `confined-location' creature-on-the-loose film in the manner of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Prey/dp/B000JJRYDS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Prey</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Water/dp/B00111YM56/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Water</a>,"" both also released in 2007. Like those films ""Grizzly Rage"" takes the material seriously with zero self-parodying, which is a good thing as far as I'm concerned. The main problem with all three films is their thin plots. A group of people are harassed and hunted by a fearsome animal (a bear, lion and croc respectively) in a confined location. Some might survive, some won't. Both ""Prey"" and ""Black Water"" are able to (barely) get over this weakness with pretty good results, but ""Grizzly Rage"" fails.

There's just too much time devoted to what is essentially a 45-minute story, which means there's about 35-40 minutes of padding where we watch people climb cliffs, walk in the forest, stroll in their SUV, have meaningless conversations, etc. Needless to say, these scenes are mind-numbingly boring.

Another problem is an overlong and unbelievable sequence where the survivors coast in their broke-down SUV when, up to that point, there was no evidence of hilly terrain to coast down - it's all relatively flat (!). This reflects unimaginative, pad-the-runtime writing.

Thankfully, there are some good aspects that make the film somewhat worthwhile for some: a quality cast, particularly the two main protagonists, the beautiful Kate Todd with her stunning face and blond hair, and Tyler Hoechlin, who is a good masculine principal with semi-angular facial features in the manner of the Sub-Mariner. The cast take the material seriously and are convincing.

The `confined location' is the outskirts of Winnipeg. Although this area isn't scenic or notable at all, it's nice to have one of these films shot somewhere besides British Columbia or Eastern Europe for a change.

The film features a real, huge grizzly throughout, no cartooney CGI.

There's also a 4-minute sequence early in the second act featuring the moving song ""Belonging"" by Jet Set Satellite. It's a great song and the sequence makes the viewer wake up and take notice.

But the film's fatally bogged down by too much runtime and not enough plot. Still, it's worthwhile if you like these types of flicks and the positives noted above trip your trigger.

GRADE: C- or a weak 3 Stars (I'm being generous)",1325721600,,2641,5.5825

3103389,3,B0013D8L86,"I saw this movie on the Syfy chanel a few times, worse animal horrror i ever seen.  Gory but still sucked.  The only thing that was good with that movie was Tyler who plays Derek from TV series Teen Wolf.",1311724800,,204,4.075
3103390,1,B0013D8L86,"After watching too many Syfy channel movies in a row (my Xbox is inaccessible these days), I've come to a startling conclusion.  When a group of teens get in a vehicle and the idiot boyfriend tells the clueless girlfriend that she is not allowed in the passenger seat next to him, we - the actors, the characters, and the viewers - are all doomed.

I get why the writers do this - they have a limited amount of time to get the characters into a vehicle so they can promptly start dying at their monster-infested destination, and there are only so many ways you can show a frat boy being a real jerk to his girlfriend.

One way to do this is by kicking her out of the front seat.  I repeat: ONE WAY. There are other ways. But shlock horror filmmakers apparently don't know any other way because this exact sequence happened in Lockjaw: Rise of the Kulev Serpent.  And yet Lockjaw was better than this movie.

Instead of clipping some guy's wife with a SUV like in Lockjaw, the collected idiots in Grizzly Rage run over a bear cub. This happens because they 1) decide to take an out-of-the-way path, 2) are driving like idiots while hooting and hollering, and 3) aren't paying attention to the road.  Said idiots then dither uselessly trying to figure out what to do about the bear cub, knowing that mama grizzly is surely on her way for revenge. Thus the title.

There are no special effects to speak of in this film.  There's no CGI, because there's nothing to animate.  It's just spliced bear footage, a guy in a bear suit, actors screaming at things off camera, and unbelievably boring sequences in which the four cast members climb, walk, jog, run, and otherwise waste 80 minutes of your life you will never get back.

There is a moment in Grizzly Rage where the two remaining survivors commiserate about their plight.  And, with a straight face, the female lead shares that the grizzly is hunting them as a form of punishment because she hit a parked car once and never fessed up to it.  It's pretty clear that was script writer Arne Olsen's car.

Grizzly Rage has pulled off an amazing feat by convincing many reviewers that the film is about a ""normal"" grizzly.  This is a sure sign that the reviewer didn't actually watch the film.  Grizzly Rage has two different sequences involving a peculiar abandoned shack with bear traps, collars, chains, beakers, tubes, and what looks like a mutated bear claw.  It's all the trappings of a mad scientist experiment except for the pink neon sign flashing ""This is a Mad Scientist's Experiment."" In other words, this mama grizzly, who certainly has better things to do than expend so much energy chasing people miles across the wilderness, is in fact A MUTATED BEAR.  Grizzly Rage is NOT original, it is not that different, it is in fact a pedestrian mutant monster film lacking the slightest shred of originality...

Except for the abrupt ending. The ending is either a real genre-breaker or the producers ran out of money. Your opinion of Grizzly Rage's ending will probably depend on your state of inebriation. I was unfortunately sober at the time so...yeah, I'm filled with grisly rage about it.",1281225600,8,3146,4.636036036036036

Granted, horror movies are about that certain lead character making a bad choice at some crucial part of the film that sets off a chain of increasingly gory events that usually leads to an intense climax.  This film, however, is a hallmark of one bad choice after another.  We'll just blame this on the writer--this has to be one of the lousiest written movies to come out in a long time.  It's truly offensive how that writer somehow got away with penning this POS, and then got paid for it!  Observe:  these kids had obviously not one iota of wilderness experience, which didn`t stop them from going in the middle of Nowhere, Canada.  Does any of them think to build a fire to ward off the angry bear, as just about every animal fears fire?  When they first hit the baby bear, do they turn around and go back?  Noooooooo, these pieces of work head deeper into the wilderness.  And we're supposed to root for them?  Then there's the bear.  How does this huge bear suddenly become ninja-like and sneak around up behind some of the characters.  Not only that, she's positively ubiquitous!

True, the plot might have gone somewhere had they hired actors based on (Le gasp) acting instead of their looks, Four kids, teens rather, kill a baby bear on a trip and ~BAM~ momma bear is out for revenge.

3103410,1,B0013D8L86,"Ugh, where to begin with this piece of trash? First of all, the actors and actresses in this film are terrible. As is the case in most ""horror"" films, they were obviously chosen for their looks, not their acting abilities. The bear is even more pathetic. They did use a real bear for part of this film, but because of the ""danger"" it posed to the cast and crew, it never appears in the same scene as the characters. Instead, a man in a bear suit takes over during the ""action"" scenes, and giant fake bear paws come flying out of the nowhere to smite some of the victims at various points in the movie...

To sum up the plot, the bear is attacking a group of stranded 20-somethings because their jeep broke down. In one scene the man-in-the-bear-suit actually mauls the vehicle and rolls it over and lifts it up and kills people by hitting them across the face with its paws and... you get the point. Not all of the victims die so easily, though. One of them arms himself with a tire iron before dying. And another escapes death by fake-bear-paw multiple times only to trip and fall and die later in the movie.

To be honest, I watched this movie for laughs because I knew it would be stupid, but this one is so ridiculously bad it isn't even funny. The characters are too stupid for even the cheapest of slasher flicks, and the man-in-the-bear-suit is almost as boring as the actual bear, which, if I remember right, the crew got to growl by taunting it with food. And boy does it growl. The characters in the film actually hear it roaring from miles away. If I didn't have the giant fake bear paws to remind me, I might think I was watching ""Tyrannosaurus Rage."" Unfortunately, I'm not that lucky.

I do not recommend this movie to ANYONE, including those looking for a laugh at the expense of a low budget horror flick. It's not funny, it's just disgustingly boring.",1233360000,2,1868,4.424418604651163

What the hell would horror film directors do otherwise?), so it's a fight to survive out in the boonies with an angry grizzly on the prowl.
This ""Maneater"" series from the Sci-Fi channel isn't scoring high points with me.  Grizzly Rage was rather boring.  I don't mind four cast members stranded and wandering around with no action for minutes on end, but there has to be some kind of hook for a movie like this to work.  Piles and piles of gore would have helped.  Instead the bear tends to just throw people in the air.  Since a real bear was used(thank God), there are no scenes of it actually attacking people.  You see quick cuts of the bear roaring and a comic book like dash of animated blood that streaks across the screen.  That would be fine if it wasn't the only trick in the director's bag.

3103413,4,B0013D8L86,"Yeah, this is yet another one of the Man-Eaters series, which feature low budget Sci-Fi Channel originals where various wild animals go on a rampage eating people. It's also kind of a low point for the series. At least 'Man-Eater' and 'Eye of the Beast' had good acting - this one is just a straight up cheesy animal attack movie. Of course, if your the type of person would would buy or watch this movie, your probably looking more for animal attacks and bad acting than cinematic quality.

So the basic premise is that a bunch of teens go joy-riding in the back woods, hit and kill a grizzly cub, and get chased and eventually mauled by the enraged mother. The characters aren't particularly sympathetic or well developed - they seem more cardboard cut outs of your typical dumb teenagers. In fact, you'll probably find yourself rooting for the angry grizzly. Nor are the characters especially intelligent. Theres quite a few moments where I found myself laughing or questioning WHY they took a particular course of action. Of course, the plot is pretty straight forward, but even then there are a few other baffling moments. Like the mysterious (and appearantly abandoned) shack in the woods, or the random drums of toxic waste that play no part in the movie's storyline whatsoever. And the ending was seemingly random, as if they just ran out of script (or money).

But the REAL highlight of the movie comes from the bear attacks! Oh yes, they actually spent the money on having a trained bear appear in the film, but never actually with anyone else. Most of the 'attacks' involve the grizzly roaring and then close ups of a screaming victim (sometimes with animated 'claw marks' across the screen). My favorites, though, were the man in the rather unconvincing bear suit attacking their SUV (sometimes with head-butts!). All in all, this is a fairly entertaining movie, best watched with a group of your friends. It certainly didn't make me afraid of being attacked by an enraged she-bear or anything, but it was a fun movie. If you like cheesy movies, this will be right up your alley.

The mother, who obviously wasn't watching her kid, goes after the four idiots with a vengeance.  After that they continue to drive recklessly, continue to crash and wreck the jeep several times, run and run and run some more.  The bear finally shows up (on occasion) in extreme close-ups.  There are no thrills but plenty of spills.  The kids get weepy a couple of times in the middle of the crisis to chatter about their misspent youth.  The radiator wasn't the only thing cracked................  And insult to injury, some nitwit decides to cram in a couple of ill-fitting songs just because!  The funniest, unintentionally funny scene, has one of the dopey kids running for help because they cant get any cell phone reception.  He stops at an abandoned building and slowly-slowly snoops through the place poking at things in bottles.  As though he had a limited attention span and totally forgot what he was supposed to be doing!  The biggest offense is that all four kids are unremittingly obnoxious and unlikable.  If the bear didn't get to them fast enough I was more than willing to tell it where they were hiding!  This non-horror horror movie wasn't just bad, it was pitiful.

The bear was very believable though, except that this mother bear was played by a male grizzly bear called Koda.  To get him to open his mouth and look menacing they fed him marshmallows.

Anyway, after breaking into someone's property they run over a bear cub and unleash the wrath of the cub's mother.

There were a number of plot points raised that were never explored and I gathered they were used just to advance the story rather than add any real value. It was a waste as the film ends with an obvious conclusion but a whole load of questions about what else was going on.

3337878,2,B0013D8L86,"This movie could justifiably also be called ""The Idiot's Guide to Dying in the Wilderness"".  It is chock full of excellent examples of things you should never, ever do...

1) Never drive off into the boonies with a bunch of morons, none of whom have bothered to tell another living soul where you're going.

2) Never drive your vehicle 80 mph through rough, dense, unfamiliar terrain--especially if there are bound to be trees in the way.

3) Never, ever, EVER run over a bear cub.  And definitely don't go back, touch the dead body, and leave your shirt lying next to the carcass, thereby enabling the enraged mother bear to more easily pick up your scent.

4) Never split up and go wandering through the woods when a killer mother bear is on the hunt and just waiting for a chance to go medieval on your butt.

5) If you do happen to get injured, never expect friends like these to help you.  They will either abandon you like yesterday's trash while trying to save their own skins, or do more harm than good with their non-existent medical ""skills"".

6) Never stupidly assume that placing a wimpy, old wagon wheel in front of a cabin door is going to stop a full-sized, raging grizzly bear.  Bears never fall for that stuff anyway.

7) And, lastly, never pick up a movie like this expecting award-winning acting, special effects, and storyline...it ain't gonna happen.

Ultimately, this is a mildly entertaining show, as it's at least good for a laugh.  Nobody here will win any awards for acting, although their characters all certainly qualify for Darwin Awards as their stupidity and unwavering determination to self-destruct are truly awe-inspiring.  No, it's definitely not the best movie I've ever seen, but it isn't the absolute worst either.  For those who are into the ""Maneater Series"" flicks, I would personally recommend ""Croc"", as it was the best I have seen so far.  Alternatively, for anyone interested in realistic re-creations of actual animal attacks, ""Your Worst Animal Nightmares"" is very good.",1379030400,,2017,4.819767441860465
3337879,1,B0013D8L86,"We start out with some fast motion cuts through traffic in some city in the Manitoba province, where four teens (played of course by early 20 somethings) are heading out to the woods for a camping trip. These people seem to forget one particular thing about the deep woods, that is that animals can go crazy, in particular mother bears when these idiot partiers accidentally kill a mother's young bear cub.

They probably should've realized the area they're partying in was fenced and closed off for a reason, but a killer mother grizzly, nah that's not a reason to worry. However in a plot twist, this bear has been drinking from a lake where lots of toxic waste dumping which makes her stronger than any other grizzly alive. Nevermind the questions of how she survived ingesting the radioactive materials.

From early on you're just rooting for the cast to get killed, they crash their jeep into a tree, one guy takes his shirt off to cover up the cub, which of course just helps the mother pick up his scent. They bring next to no water, so when they need to cool down the jeep's engine they have to separate to get this vital water. The dialogue is just beyond terrible as is the acting. The bear is the best actor in the movie, though there were some shots where an actor in a bear suit was used, so the real bear wasn't put in any danger while filming.

I'm pretty baffled how this film cost $2 million (estimated budget of course), which is a low budget for most movies, but still it looks cheaper than that. The forest shots are actually very cool looking up in the Great White North, but thats about the extent of anything positive to say about the movie. I've seen worse but the cheapness and stupidity of the characters really makes this something you slum through rather than just watch. * out of 4 stars.",1369526400,,1817,4.483383685800605
3337880,1,B0013D8L86,"And I'm not joking.  I caught this movie on television some years ago while channel surfing with my uncle.  What begins as a stupid premise created only by those with screenplay-writing credentials but none of the creativeness to back it up turns quickly into a downhill ride of stupid, stupid things.

That bear?  Clearly just a couple of bear-paw gloves some key grip picked up at a costume store in the next town.  The people who die?  I have never seen ""actors"" and movie characters so richly deserving of being mauled to death by a woodland animal.

By the end of the movie, I was glad they were all dead.  Spoiler alert.  They all die.  And it's the most redeeming thing about the movie.

Now, I am a man of Irish heritage.  I am a ginger who wears a kilt, but I have an American accent, I live in Ohio.  At the end of this movie, I was so upset that it even existed that I began to speak with an Irish lilt.  This was something new to me.  Only twice in my life, apparently this happens to me, have I been so upset that the tone of my voice took on another accent entirely.  Genetics, maybe?  I guess.

Since, I have bought this movie on DVD.  Why, you may ask yourself?  Because I threaten people with it.  Drunken nights at my apartment eventually dwindle and when I want friends out of my house, I threaten to finally, after two years, bust the DVD out of the plastic-wrap and force them to watch it.  Ten minutes later I am asleep in bed with no more guests downstairs.

3337883,3,B0013D8L86,"2007's ""Grizzly Rage"" would have worked as a one-hour TV show (with commercials), but not as it is, an 86-minute film.

This is a `confined-location' creature-on-the-loose film in the manner of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Prey/dp/B000JJRYDS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Prey</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Water/dp/B00111YM56/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Water</a>,"" both also released in 2007. Like those films ""Grizzly Rage"" takes the material seriously with zero self-parodying, which is a good thing as far as I'm concerned. The main problem with all three films is their thin plots. A group of people are harassed and hunted by a fearsome animal (a bear, lion and croc respectively) in a confined location. Some might survive, some won't. Both ""Prey"" and ""Black Water"" are able to (barely) get over this weakness with pretty good results, but ""Grizzly Rage"" fails.

There's just too much time devoted to what is essentially a 45-minute story, which means there's about 35-40 minutes of padding where we watch people climb cliffs, walk in the forest, stroll in their SUV, have meaningless conversations, etc. Needless to say, these scenes are mind-numbingly boring.

Another problem is an overlong and unbelievable sequence where the survivors coast in their broke-down SUV when, up to that point, there was no evidence of hilly terrain to coast down - it's all relatively flat (!). This reflects unimaginative, pad-the-runtime writing.

Thankfully, there are some good aspects that make the film somewhat worthwhile for some: a quality cast, particularly the two main protagonists, the beautiful Kate Todd with her stunning face and blond hair, and Tyler Hoechlin, who is a good masculine principal with semi-angular facial features in the manner of the Sub-Mariner. The cast take the material seriously and are convincing.

The `confined location' is the outskirts of Winnipeg. Although this area isn't scenic or notable at all, it's nice to have one of these films shot somewhere besides British Columbia or Eastern Europe for a change.

The film features a real, huge grizzly throughout, no cartooney CGI.

There's also a 4-minute sequence early in the second act featuring the moving song ""Belonging"" by Jet Set Satellite. It's a great song and the sequence makes the viewer wake up and take notice.

But the film's fatally bogged down by too much runtime and not enough plot. Still, it's worthwhile if you like these types of flicks and the positives noted above trip your trigger.

3337887,1,B0013D8L86,"After watching too many Syfy channel movies in a row (my Xbox is inaccessible these days), I've come to a startling conclusion.  When a group of teens get in a vehicle and the idiot boyfriend tells the clueless girlfriend that she is not allowed in the passenger seat next to him, we - the actors, the characters, and the viewers - are all doomed.

I get why the writers do this - they have a limited amount of time to get the characters into a vehicle so they can promptly start dying at their monster-infested destination, and there are only so many ways you can show a frat boy being a real jerk to his girlfriend.

One way to do this is by kicking her out of the front seat.  I repeat: ONE WAY. There are other ways. But shlock horror filmmakers apparently don't know any other way because this exact sequence happened in Lockjaw: Rise of the Kulev Serpent.  And yet Lockjaw was better than this movie.

Instead of clipping some guy's wife with a SUV like in Lockjaw, the collected idiots in Grizzly Rage run over a bear cub. This happens because they 1) decide to take an out-of-the-way path, 2) are driving like idiots while hooting and hollering, and 3) aren't paying attention to the road.  Said idiots then dither uselessly trying to figure out what to do about the bear cub, knowing that mama grizzly is surely on her way for revenge. Thus the title.

There are no special effects to speak of in this film.  There's no CGI, because there's nothing to animate.  It's just spliced bear footage, a guy in a bear suit, actors screaming at things off camera, and unbelievably boring sequences in which the four cast members climb, walk, jog, run, and otherwise waste 80 minutes of your life you will never get back.

There is a moment in Grizzly Rage where the two remaining survivors commiserate about their plight.  And, with a straight face, the female lead shares that the grizzly is hunting them as a form of punishment because she hit a parked car once and never fessed up to it.  It's pretty clear that was script writer Arne Olsen's car.

Grizzly Rage has pulled off an amazing feat by convincing many reviewers that the film is about a ""normal"" grizzly.  This is a sure sign that the reviewer didn't actually watch the film.  Grizzly Rage has two different sequences involving a peculiar abandoned shack with bear traps, collars, chains, beakers, tubes, and what looks like a mutated bear claw.  It's all the trappings of a mad scientist experiment except for the pink neon sign flashing ""This is a Mad Scientist's Experiment."" In other words, this mama grizzly, who certainly has better things to do than expend so much energy chasing people miles across the wilderness, is in fact A MUTATED BEAR.  Grizzly Rage is NOT original, it is not that different, it is in fact a pedestrian mutant monster film lacking the slightest shred of originality...

Except for the abrupt ending. The ending is either a real genre-breaker or the producers ran out of money. Your opinion of Grizzly Rage's ending will probably depend on your state of inebriation. I was unfortunately sober at the time so...yeah, I'm filled with grisly rage about it.",1281225600,8,3146,4.636036036036036

It's truly offensive how that writer somehow got away with penning this POS, and then got paid for it!  Observe:  these kids had obviously not one iota of wilderness experience, which didn`t stop them from going in the middle of Nowhere, Canada.

As is the case in most ""horror"" films, they were obviously chosen for their looks, not their acting abilities. The bear is even more pathetic. They did use a real bear for part of this film, but because of the ""danger"" it posed to the cast and crew, it never appears in the same scene as the characters. Instead, a man in a bear suit takes over during the ""action"" scenes, and giant fake bear paws come flying out of the nowhere to smite some of the victims at various points in the movie...

To sum up the plot, the bear is attacking a group of stranded 20-somethings because their jeep broke down. In one scene the man-in-the-bear-suit actually mauls the vehicle and rolls it over and lifts it up and kills people by hitting them across the face with its paws and... you get the point. Not all of the victims die so easily, though. One of them arms himself with a tire iron before dying. And another escapes death by fake-bear-paw multiple times only to trip and fall and die later in the movie.

To be honest, I watched this movie for laughs because I knew it would be stupid, but this one is so ridiculously bad it isn't even funny. The characters are too stupid for even the cheapest of slasher flicks, and the man-in-the-bear-suit is almost as boring as the actual bear, which, if I remember right, the crew got to growl by taunting it with food. And boy does it growl. The characters in the film actually hear it roaring from miles away. If I didn't have the giant fake bear paws to remind me, I might think I was watching ""Tyrannosaurus Rage."" Unfortunately, I'm not that lucky.

I do not recommend this movie to ANYONE, including those looking for a laugh at the expense of a low budget horror flick. It's not funny, it's just disgustingly boring.",1233360000,2,1868,4.424418604651163
3337908,2,B0013D8L86,"Four annoying teens on a road trip decide to stray from their original route to go goofballing in their truck and make a....ahem....grizzly discovery.  Splattering a cub with their truck starts a reign of terror as the mother grizzly goes on a rampage for revenge.  Naturally the truck's broken down and the cell phones don't get reception(Isn't it great that cell phones have that weakness out in the middle of nowhere?  What the hell would horror film directors do otherwise?), so it's a fight to survive out in the boonies with an angry grizzly on the prowl.
This ""Maneater"" series from the Sci-Fi channel isn't scoring high points with me.  Grizzly Rage was rather boring.  I don't mind four cast members stranded and wandering around with no action for minutes on end, but there has to be some kind of hook for a movie like this to work.  Piles and piles of gore would have helped.  Instead the bear tends to just throw people in the air.  Since a real bear was used(thank God), there are no scenes of it actually attacking people.  You see quick cuts of the bear roaring and a comic book like dash of animated blood that streaks across the screen.  That would be fine if it wasn't the only trick in the director's bag.
Hell, I'm not gonna write a novel about this movie.  Watch it at your own risk if you think you can....cough...cough...bear it.",1220227200,4,1352,4.568464730290456
3337909,2,B0013D8L86,"Has a great plot and could've been ALOT better, I actually dozed off once and I never do that on scary films.  Grizzly Park was alot better!",1217548800,,140,4.185185185185185
3337910,4,B0013D8L86,"Yeah, this is yet another one of the Man-Eaters series, which feature low budget Sci-Fi Channel originals where various wild animals go on a rampage eating people. It's also kind of a low point for the series. At least 'Man-Eater' and 'Eye of the Beast' had good acting - this one is just a straight up cheesy animal attack movie. Of course, if your the type of person would would buy or watch this movie, your probably looking more for animal attacks and bad acting than cinematic quality.

So the basic premise is that a bunch of teens go joy-riding in the back woods, hit and kill a grizzly cub, and get chased and eventually mauled by the enraged mother. The characters aren't particularly sympathetic or well developed - they seem more cardboard cut outs of your typical dumb teenagers. In fact, you'll probably find yourself rooting for the angry grizzly. Nor are the characters especially intelligent. Theres quite a few moments where I found myself laughing or questioning WHY they took a particular course of action. Of course, the plot is pretty straight forward, but even then there are a few other baffling moments. Like the mysterious (and appearantly abandoned) shack in the woods, or the random drums of toxic waste that play no part in the movie's storyline whatsoever. And the ending was seemingly random, as if they just ran out of script (or money).

But the REAL highlight of the movie comes from the bear attacks! Oh yes, they actually spent the money on having a trained bear appear in the film, but never actually with anyone else. Most of the 'attacks' involve the grizzly roaring and then close ups of a screaming victim (sometimes with animated 'claw marks' across the screen). My favorites, though, were the man in the rather unconvincing bear suit attacking their SUV (sometimes with head-butts!). All in all, this is a fairly entertaining movie, best watched with a group of your friends. It certainly didn't make me afraid of being attacked by an enraged she-bear or anything, but it was a fun movie. If you like cheesy movies, this will be right up your alley. Also consider checking out their other releases in the Man-Eaters series.",1214697600,5,2165,4.786096256684492

3337912,4,B0013D8L86,"The bear in the film is not CG, i repeat they used a real trained bear. That being said i quit enjoyed the film and found it both a great horror mauler but also a very accurate image of a really pissed off bear. The cast is made up of 4 people, teenagers who break into a reserve to celibrate school gradution. High School, College, i don't know. Anyway they accidently kill a baby bear cub and unleash momma bear with a vengence. A very fun film with great special/bear effects. and as to the sci-fi channels involvment. They did not produce it, only distrubited and braodcasted it, therefor the way better quality from a studio owned by dimesion films none the less.",1211760000,5,668,4.439024390243903

How can you go wrong with that scenario, you ask?  Answer: Leave out the gore.  All we get is a bear chasing people and, if we're lucky, throwing them a few feet through the air.  If you're a rabid gore fan like me, you'll be bored to tears.  Come on, guys, if you're gonna make a horror movie, make a HORROR movie!

3337914,5,B0013D8L86,"Director David Decoteau delivers a suspense filled, tense and occasionally frightening action/adventure film.  The cast is impressive and Graham Kosakoski is exceptional.  There isn't a lot of plot going on here, but there are many beautiful shots from Decoteau and some cool attack scenes. The grizzly bear is pretty cool as well.  The DVD is packaged in an attractive embossed slipcase.  The transfer looks much better than what I recorded from the SciFi channel and the soundtrack is acceptable but nothing special.  The DVD also includes a trailer for the Maneater Series.",1210032000,3,576,5.217391304347826

8249991,2,B0013D8L86,"This movie is filmed well enough to sit through it once. Typical dumb young people, break and enter, trespass, speeding on an unknown dirt road, hit baby bear, you can see what's next. What makes this move wreak, is the fact that the actors and bear are never in the same place at the same time. The reason?, I understand that our cast is too afraid of being by the trained bear to make this move. So we get those grade school blood on the lens thing. This could have been pretty good if we had the realism, like say in The Edge. Anthony Hopkins and Alec Baldwin play alongside Bart the Bear and his trainer. It makes for a movie that has you on the edge of your seat, no pun intended. I understand it, Alec was a bit uncomfortable, but he did it, that is realism. Our girl finally traps the bear in an old building, and instead of running as fast and far as her and her friend could, they stop and, well, you can guess what happens next.",1509926400,,938,4.15934065934066
