3983121,4,B002SZ7Y7W,"I've followed Brule since the first CD ""We the people"" and this concert was just as entertaining except for one thing.  I found the flute player (his daughter Nicole) extremely irritating to the flow of the music.  I love the sound of native american flute playing but the standard (metal) flute sounded to me harsh and I found it to be an intrusion in the music that I have always loved.  I found myself hoping that at least one song would be without it but alas it was not the case.  The guitar work was wonderful as well as the percussion, but I really feel that the flute was superfluous and unnecessary.",1339372800,3,608,4.401785714285714
3983122,4,B002SZ7Y7W,The DVD gave valuable information about the native American tribe involved in it.  The music and dancing was great.  We enjoyed the DVD and plan to watch it again soon.,1325980800,4,168,4.566666666666666
3983123,5,B002SZ7Y7W,"While billed as an Indian rock concert, it is neither rock nor traditional Indian music. To me, it is New Age instrumental music. Very, very, good music. Unlike much New Age music I have heard, it is not self reflective and mystically mournful. It is joyful, happy music from start to finish.
The concert is a mix of true personal warmth and a polished stage performance. Ian Anderson would be proud of the flutist. The ""Fabio"" effect for one drummer was humorous to me, but must go over well with the crowds in Branson. Highly recommended.",1320278400,5,540,4.635416666666667
3983124,5,B002SZ7Y7W,"I was curious about Brule, the Native American musical group, because I've been studying my Native American ancestry for awhile now. Paul LaRoche's story is an inspiration to me and his vision for reconciling the white and Indian nations through music is fascinating. I'm a big fan now, and I'm so glad I picked up the DVD of the concert filmed at Mt. Rushmore. You have to understand something of the history of the Lakota Sioux to understand the importance of the choice of venue for this concert. It's a memorable trip through history, one that everyone in the country should take before they can fully appreciate the journey Paul and his group have made. I'm so glad they are doing well and have their own show in Branson, sponsored by RFD TV. If you love new and unusual music with a Native American flavor, and can appreciate the beautiful Native American dances, this DVD is for you. The costumes and energy of the dancers is amazing and the music is unlike any I have heard. I love this group, and I know you will too.",1307836800,11,1026,4.521505376344086

This is one of my favorite dvd's to watch over and over.  Glad Paul finally achieved his dream.  I also loved the  dancers, beautiful.

8379720,5,B002SZ7Y7W,I stumbled upon Brule's Concert for Reconciliation of the Cultures on a local PBS channel.  I loved the concert so much that I purchased the DVD for myself and as gifts for co-workers.  I watch it whenever I'm feeling down.  It is uplifting and the message is universal.  I believe everyone should watch it at least once.  You will learn something about the Native American culture and its history.  Kids will love it because of the dancing -- my favorite is the woman mimicking a bald eagle.,1416528000,,492,4.597701149425287

So is the video production itself. On top of that you have the key message of this show, to open our minds and hearts to all people. I am surprised this video has not won higher acclaim. It deserves it, and then some.",1375574400,4,382,4.319444444444445
