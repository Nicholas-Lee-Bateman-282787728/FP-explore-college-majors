8083553,5,B000B8TIKY,Jennifer Beals what more can you say about this great actress? She gives her all in this movie and singing to boot. I have watched this movie three times. I'm a fan! Long live Jennifer!,1464048000,,185,4.314285714285714
8083554,5,B000B8TIKY,I love the movie but the only thing that did not make it perfect was the absence of closed captions.  Now that I am old I do not hear as well as I used to so when I see movies on DirecTV I  rewind and read the closed captions.  Unfortunately we are all headed that way and closed captions will help everyone as they grow old and cannot hear as well as when they were young and gay.  I am a Jennifer Beals fan and I would see her in a movie watching a dog fight.  That is me in 1961 age 30.,1449619200,,489,3.70873786407767

8083558,4,B000B8TIKY,"This is a movie about a popular singer who is sort of going downhill in her career and an assistant with a dark secret. The storyline is very nice and Jennifer Beals gave a stelar performance. In fact, the main reason I love this movie is because of her acting in it. She is gorgeous and carried her role very well.
