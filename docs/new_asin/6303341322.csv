Pappys Crappy Movies #35

HELL COMES TO FROG TOWN (1988)

Like the rest of the civilized world, my thoughts were with Paris last weekend and so I did not publish a crappy review. This week, an unbidden Freudian subconscious connection compelled me to review a 1980s post-apocalyptic sci-fi action comedy with the politically incorrect but somewhat appropriate title of ""HELL COMES TO FROG TOWN"".

Starring professional wrestler/actor Rowdy Roddy Piper of WWF fame, this movie could have been the greatest porno ever made if they had dared go there. Instead we get a highly entertaining, marginally acted, occasionally witty oddity that often has the viewer dumbfounded at what they dared put on the screen.

Set in a devastated world after WWIII, survivors of both sides are scrambling to rebuild their population ostensibly to resume the war and gain victory. Rowdy Roddy plays Sam Hell of the title and yes, hes going to Frog town. Dont you just love it when a movie title just lays it all out there?
Speaking of laying, most of the population has been rendered infertile by radiation. It seems Sam is one of those men who can still get the job done and so he has been conscripted, against his will, to go forth and multiply for his country. He is accompanied by Sandahl Bergman, fresh from playing Ahnolds main squeeze in Conan, as a nerdy military/medical gal whose mission is to keep Piper pumping away at any skirt they happen to come across in the desert. Piper has to wear a high tech chastity belt, controlled by Ms. Bergman, which will zap his package if he refuses to perform his military duties and blow his balls clean off if he tries to run away. I told you this could have been the greatest porno ever!

Where does Frog town come in? It seems the war created mutant frog-humans that have been exiled to reservations. Piper and Bergman get wind that a group of fertile human women have been kidnapped and are being held as sex slaves in Frog town (Ewwww!). They take off, along with Bergmans butch underling, in a pink van mounted with a 60 mm machine gun. The cigar smoking gal on the gun is tough as nails but nice to look at and shes the first to get the hots for Piper. The bad guys are the mutant frogs and a mean border guard (played by biker movie veteran William Smith) who has it out for Piper for impregnating his daughter. Rory Calhoun rounds out the cast as a crusty old uranium miner.

As they say, hi-jinx ensue as Piper and Bergman try to infiltrate Frog town as slaver and slave giving us the opportunity to watch Piper drag Bergman around in a dog collar and chain. There are also nude scenes and near nude scenes as first the NCO and then Bergman and then a Frog woman stripper try to seduce Piper. Read this paragraph again and tell me its not a crappy movie home run.

Frog town is run by Boss Toady. The (non-sexual) action parts involve lots of shooting, explosions and Piper doing some sweet wrestling moves on frog bad guys. The most outrageous scene has to be when Bergmans character is dressed up as a harem girl and forced to do the dance of the three snakes for Boss Toady. Whats that? Well, it seems that Boss Toady is mutated in the nether regions and has been endowed with a triple, er, threat, shall we say? If one is successful in dancing all three snakes into attention, he lets you live. Wow! I mean, just wow!

Obviously, this movie has nothing to do with Paris but, being mostly French, I claim ""frog"" privilege for the use of the derogatory term like a black rapper claims the N-word. If you can get past the sheer audacity of the plot, it makes for a fun time. The frog makeup is very good for its day; theres some good support work, fun dialogue and sexy/funny scenes. As an actor, Piper is both good and bad at the same time which fits this movie perfectly. Its done with a light enough touch that one might not realize the fundamental offensive premise that Piper is basically a government sanctioned rapist. But thats something for deeper thinking reviewers. From a crappy standpoint, HELL COMES TO FROG TOWN deserves and receives the full FOUR CRAPPIES. I paid four bucks to watch this on Amazon Prime. There is a Spanish dubbed version on YouTube for free if you habla Espa&ntilde;ola.",1448323200,,4377,4.530379746835443

And this Hell is Sam Hellman, the toughest, roughest, and... well, happiest (darn it!) Hell to ever visit this Frogtown or any other.

If you do not love the following, this may not be your favorite flick in the West: ladies, nudity, tough guys, loads of smack-down violence, then more violence, and some more besides, plus some humour and a wee bit of tenderness. (Yes, just a wee bit, really, it's not too bad that way...)

The Frogboys don't know anything about the plot, and they really never get involved, but that's not their place. The ladies come across the plot a bit, but at least clothing gets lost along the way.

Besides...from a B-movie bomb you don't care about the plot anyway, as long as the actors make a good show of it, some stuff blows up and a few dozen dregs get wasted by fists, gunfire and explosions.

626134,1,6303341322,"I cuddled up to a 1988 low budget sci-fi

flunky on a cold Sunday evening to watch a film entitled ""Hell Comes to Frogtown"".  No

foolin'...That is the honest to goodness title.

Granted, it's freezing outside, and I should have

started the fireplace and read a good book, but

instead I wasted 90 mintes of my life waiting for this

loser to light a fire under me.  Never happened.  I

was hoping it was a comedy.  What I got was a croaker

from start to finish.  This film is definitely colder

that a frog's butt (no pun intended).

Catch this!  It's the tale of post world-war

destruction.  67% of the male population is wiped out

and Mr. Sam Hell is identified as a fertile male.  He

is recruited by the government, fitted with a cast

metal loin brace, and sent to Frogtown to impregnate

wanton and fertile females.  What's the point?  They

want to perpetuate the war by increasing the number of

male soldiers.  (Kinda sounds like the Bush regime,

huh?)  Now I know why Colin Powell was axed.  He was

the likely screenwriter and co-producer.

By the way.  The apparatus they affix to his groin is

a time bomb.  If he tries to escape the grasp of

government moguls it will explode...by the twist of an

earring.  That's right...an earring.

I wish I could say something good about this film.

Not even the ""Dance of the Three Snakes"" (performed by

a skinny blonde ""Twiggy"" look-a-like) was worth the

effort.

Hell really didn't come to Frogtown.  It came into my

living room.

Don't even think of renting this.  I'd watch a Kermit

and Miss Piggy flick first.",1100995200,2,1578,4.5234657039711195

626137,3,6303341322,"Meet Sam Hell. Life for this poor guy has never been the same after the world fell apart. Before the apocalypse wiped out most of humanity, Hell was just another bloke trying to make it with the ladies. After the end of the world, he suddenly found himself in great demand. Why? Sam Hell has the unique distinction of being one of the only-if not the only-men on the planet capable of fathering children. This ability is a big deal in a world where fertility is a highly prized commodity for both men and women. Radiation rendered most of the lads and lasses incapable of bearing children, so if the human race is to once again thrive and eventually rebuild the planet, the right man must meet the right women. Besides, our side needs more children so they can raise good little soldiers to continue fighting the Russians (or whoever it was who turned America into a desert). Fortunately for this barren world, and for lovers of low budget trash cinema, Sam Hell just happens to be former wrestler turned actor ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper. I can sleep better at nights knowing Piper made more films before and after his memorable turn in Carpenter's ""They Live.""
Hell's adventure begins when a group of scientists working for something called Med Tech (or some such thing) save his life from a sadistic soldier, a Captain Devlin (William Smith), bent on killing the fertile fool. It seems Sammy impregnated this guy's daughter and attempted to mosey on down the road, something the soldier finds reprehensible. As part of the bargain for rescuing Hell from an early demise, Med Tech insists that he sign on to a most peculiar mission. He must rescue a bevy of fertile women from the clutches of humanoid frogs. Just in case Sam attempts to run away from his duties, the scientists saddle the hapless dupe with a rather painful looking chastity belt that will explode should he attempt to remove the device or flee. Heading off to Frogtown with a sexy scientist and a punk rock looking bodyguard, Hell and company spend most of their time schlepping around the desert making crotch jokes. Predictably, his two female companions hit on him, the chastity belt inflicts pain on several occasions, and the trio picks up a ratty looking girl in the desert. If you're not laughing so hard by this point that your sides hurt, you can keep watching for more hijinks as Sam and his gang stroll into Frogtown.
From the moment Hell walks into a bar inhabited by numerous mutated frogs, the film takes on a weirdness and utter ridiculousness I have rarely witnessed in any other movie. There's a vivacious frog stripper with eyes for male humans, a sadistic thug frog who seeks to do humans harm, and Rory Calhoun as an elderly miner named Looney Tunes. Lots of chase scenes, ""exotic"" dancing, and explosions follow as Hell attempts to free the women and fulfill his contract. Tricking human sized frog creatures bent on controlling the human race is never easy, but Piper and the rest of the cast sure give it the old freshman try. The movie tries hard to have a twist ending, but by the time Count Sodom and his cronies arrive on the scene I began to divorce myself mentally from the proceedings. Regrettably, the man called Sodom shows up at the end of the film, meaning I actually paid attention for most of the movie. It's not that ""Hell Comes to Frogtown"" is a bad B budget film; rather, the problems I had with the picture seemed to revolve around the fact that I watched it while I was awake. My bad.
It's easy, too easy in fact, to bash this movie for its cheesy production values, ridiculous eighties haircuts, and ludicrous plot. It takes a hardy soul indeed to overlook the myriad flaws in this film. I found the experience more bearable when I concentrated on the familiar actors and actresses parading across the screen. You've got Sandahl Bergman, of ""Conan the Barbarian"" fame, playing the role of Spangle, the sexy scientist charged with guarding Sam Hell on the trip to Frogtown. William Smith plays the dual roles of Captain Devlin and Count Sodom with his usual gravel voiced charm. Don't spend too much time scratching your head over the appearance of Rory Calhoun as the oddball Looney Tunes. This actor, whose career stretched back into the Golden Age of Hollywood, was apparently willing to take any role as he entered the 1970s and 1980s. He's probably best known to B movie lovers as the grinning Farmer Vincent in ""Motel Hell."" His appearance here is ample proof that earning a paycheck in the movie business beats working a real job any day. Really, the only redeeming quality of ""Hell Comes to Frogtown"" is Roddy Piper in the lead role of Sam Hell. Piper isn't a great actor by any stretch of the imagination, but there is always something fun about watching him tackle a part. He's much, much better in ""They Live,"" of course, but his presence helps this movie immeasurably. Piper's ability to keep a straight face here should win him some sort of award.
Amazingly, the picture quality of this DVD is quite good. It's even in widescreen. The only extras are a trailer and a commentary track from the director and writer. Why they didn't let Piper make a few remarks is a mystery and a sad omission. Seriously, most fans of cheap science fiction will want to give this one a watch if for no other reason than to see giant frogs with human attributes pummel Piper senseless. Watch it as a double feature with ""They Live.""",1085097600,19,5428,4.655208333333333
626150,4,6303341322,"HELL COMES TO FROGTOWN is a little seen gem. After nuclear war, almost every man on the planet is impotent and frogs have grown to human size. One of these frogs, Commander Toty, has kidnapped some fertile women because of their value to humans. Sam Hell (Rowdy Roddy Piper) has the highest sperm count of any man on the planet and he is called in to save the women from Frogtown and get them pregnant. The DVD of this film is good, but doesn't have nearly enough extras. The trailer, production notes booklet and commentary (by Donald G. Jackson and Randall Frakes) are good but this release could've been helped by more extra material.",1071360000,8,637,4.5964912280701755
626151,4,6303341322,"Roddy Piper (wrestler and star of They Live) is back in another science fiction thriller.  This time it is the future and very few men are fertile.  Roddy leaves pregnant women wherever he goes.  Because of this, Med-Tech wants him to help with the repopulation of the country so that they can carry on the war that created the mess.
But no sooner does Hellman (piper) sign on the dotted line than he is railroaded into an attempt to rescue a group of fertile women from the mutants of Frogtown.
What follows is a pretty good film although it is obvious that the budget was not huge.  The acting is pretty good and Piper appears more boyish and less sharp-edged than he does in They Live.  I particularly liked the frog mutant playing at Sydney Greenstreet's The Fatman.  The only thing I did miss was that there was no great one-liner from Piper.  He had one of the great lines of all time in They Live.
Sure it's campy and low budget but it is also very fun.",1063584000,,960,4.359550561797753
626152,2,6303341322,"Ok another 80's post nuclear holocaust movie. The humans are racing to re-populate the human race faster than the 'toadies' which are frog mutants. Problem is all the nuclear radiation has made most men sterile. Not our man Sam Hell, aka Rowdy Rodney Piper, the WWF wrestler. He has the highest sperm count the government has ever seen in one man. So they bolt him up with a government chastity belt and now he must mate with as many females as he can. Rough job huh?
Well a handful of seductive young maiden have been captured by the frog-people and the government sends Sam, a female corporal, and a hot blond scientist into Frogtown to rescue them. Get this they arrive in a hot-pink Mercedes with an M60 mounted on top.
The absolute lowpoint of this flick is the scientist dancing to arouse the 'Three Snakes'. I won't go into detail on this. You'll just have to see it to believe it. Words cannot describe. For those who lived through the 80's and loved it as much as I did, then you know there were many songs and movies that just made us lower our heads in shame. This is one such movie.",1040774400,2,1094,4.394088669950739

626155,5,6303341322,"If I felt this is one of the worst films ever, then why did I give it a five star rating? Well, because this movie is so bad that I found a lot of appeal to it. I never laughed so hard at the bad acting, the bad hairstyles, and of course, the worst costumes you have ever seen. Just wait until you see those mutant frog people. Never in my life have I ever seen costumes so poorly done, the people who made those costume did such an awful job at making them look like frogs. And nothing is so silly as to see Sam Hell's genitals attached to a device that electricutes his genitals if he strays too far. This is the type of film you wonder why it was never featured on Mystery Science Theater 3000. Of course you're in for a bad film where the only credibility one of the actors, ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper had, is bodyslamming his opponents in WWF pro-wrestling. But this movie deserves a five star rating because it's so bad, it's actually great.",998352000,,940,4.198895027624309
626156,4,6303341322,"Pro Wrestling's ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper makes his second film appearence in this silly but fun Sci-Fi adventure.  Roddy is one of the last fertile men left on a post-appockolyiptic earth.  He is captured by an all fremale scince group who forcew Roddy to impregnate all the fertile wild women they come across, and while not in action, roddy is forced to wear an explosive coddle belt (to prevent him from escaping).  Guess what happens if Roddy (Hell) gets farther away than a specified distance to the Science group's van?  One of the important women to the science group is captured and held in Frogtown (a town full of half human/ half amphibian mutants), and now Mr. Hell must penitrate the main group of mutants to save her.  Actually, this movie is a lot more entertaining than it sounds.  As expected, it is a low budget sterling flick, but it's vastly entertaining in it's action and humor.  If you've nevver seen this film, it's worth seeing at least once.  If you liked ""They Live"", Roddy's other film, buy this one.  It's an underground classic!",988329600,13,1053,4.7103825136612025

There is no way that Roddy Piper (Sam Hell) can compete so he appeals to their sense of humanity. Propagation is implied throughout the movie. There are even a few sweaty scenes and no one stays in the car.
