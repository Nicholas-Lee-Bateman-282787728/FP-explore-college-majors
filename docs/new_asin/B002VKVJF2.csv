There are 3 different levels; beginner, intermediate and advanced. We do it together some times or, we will do different levels. I love the format of the workouts. Ladies, just because the video talks about MMA fighters and fight fit and such, do not be afraid of this video. It will work well for you. The beginner section is about 20 minutes total. He lays it out in 5 3 minute rounds with 1 minute to rest in between each round. Within each 3 minute round, you do 3 different exercises, each for 1 minute. I hate working one body part for a long period of time and I do NOT want to hammer out a straight 5 minutes of pushups!! This is the perfect mix and it will kick your butt. It works your entire body and it does not demand an hour of your time. My boyfriend does the intermediate and advanced. They are a bit longer and more difficult. He loves them. No matter what your goal is, this video will definitely put you there. You will not be disappointed! Also, visit fightfittv.com. There is a video titled workout of the day. It shows you a few exercises and challenges you to see how many rounds you can do in a certain amount of time. Usually, 10 or 15 minutes. So, if you ever need something really quick, those are great too.

Well, I am impressed. Very much. The production quality is good. The layout is good. The menu is easy to navigate. It doesn't perceive that you are any one type program level but gives you the beginner, intermediate and advanced options of the necessary area to start with; warm-ups then workouts. That is, even in warm-ups you need to start at your physical abilities and be able to work up to the workouts. But the menu design allows you to pick where you want to go.

Their world. Its different. To a lot of people its a controversial sport. One thing I was impressed with was the basic story line and background of MMA and the fighters used and the workout program as the overlay. You get to ""see"" where they workout, learn a little bit about the fighters, and then workout with them!

Needing a good full body training and workout program? Complain about your belly? Dress size? Give this 12 weeks, follow the instructions, and get in shape!",1257724800,,1198,4.562790697674418
