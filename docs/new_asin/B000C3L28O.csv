8095592,1,B000C3L28O,"A woman falls from a balcony and is presumed dead. Her mouth is sewn up to prevent her from casting spells. She is buried in the back yard and no one notices she is missing. 25 years later a couple honeymoons at that resort home only to be annoyed by a ghost.

This is a Thai film that was not interesting. There was an extensive shower scene where Mook (Chutima Every) soaps up her body while being watched. The camera doesn't show any nudity, but does show her soaping up her midriff with a single hair growing from near her belly button.

Not worth viewing.",1405814400,,560,4.3238095238095235
8095593,1,B000C3L28O,"I love Asian films especially Thai and Korean but this was a disaster. Poor acting, too much sex,not scary, just gross. I usually can't stop a movie after I begin to watch it even if its not very good because I always end up curious to see how it ends. However, I could only get through the first 40 minutes of this film. I DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!",1303084800,,343,4.134328358208955
8095594,1,B000C3L28O,"This movie was wretched. I wasn't expecting much, but WOW. The acting, writing, camera, and the ghost, actually everything was done very poorly. It's like watching a soap opera, but this makes soap operas look amazing. If you like BAD Asian Horror, stick with Carved.",1233187200,,267,4.955555555555556
8095595,1,B000C3L28O,"I don't think there can be any doubt that the greatest horror movies of the past decade have come out of Asia - but that does not mean that every Asian horror movie is worth watching.  This particular film, Diecovery, is as painfully awful a horror movie as you are ever likely to see.  Part of me hates to come down so hard on this film - after all, it's more than a little unfair to judge a Thai movie by Western or Japanese/Chinese standards (I think the fact that this film is routinely classified quite wrongly as Japanese says a lot about the state of the Thai film industry).  On the other hand, I have to tell it like it is, and it's more than obvious to me that Diecovery is well-nigh abysmal - so much so that any sort of ""you have to understand Thai culture to appreciate the film"" excuse doesn't have a single leg to stand on.  Cinematic putridity such as this transcends all language and cultural boundaries (but I will concede the fact that much is obviously lost in translation here, as the subtitles were apparently done by someone who only knows enough English to be dangerous).

A half hour into Diecovery, you'll realize that no horror experience can possibly be worth the price you are paying, as this story drags along at a snail's pace.  I didn't need to see the main characters frolicking on the beach for what felt like hours to believe that they are in love.  They're newlyweds on their belated honeymoon, for Pete's sake - of course, they're in love.  Boy, did they choose the wrong resort to stay in, though.  Not only is the place run-down, it just so happens to house a ghost in its environs.  Twenty-five years ago, a catfight between two young women in love with the same man ended with one of them taking a nosedive from the upstairs balcony.  The man and the other woman did what anyone would do in that situation: they sewed the dead woman's lips together so that her spirit couldn't escape to torment them and then buried the body in a shallow grave right in front of the house.

I won't even bother to describe the type of ""haunting"" that our newlyweds endure, as most of it doesn't make much sense and it's not the least bit frightening (if the DVD cover doesn't scare you, the movie itself certainly won't).  A few interesting things do happen, such as the priceless moment when, during an intimate moment, the woman asks her husband to move his hands, only to discover it isn't his hands but a snake that she is feeling.  Clearly, hubby has a lot to learn about touching a woman.  There's also a ""when garden hoses attack"" moment to enjoy, and the awful subtitles are good for a few laughs now and then.  Unfortunately, an already weak story falls completely apart long before the end, and even the evil ghost grows tiresome.

I'm afraid Diecovery fails in just about every way possible.  The story goes from boring to ridiculous, the acting is lackluster at best, the music sounds like some sort of cheap late 70s American claptrap that never establishes any sort of connection with the story, and the special effects could be more accurately described as ""special"" effects.  It would also appear that they just don't teach proper lighting techniques in Thai film schools. Worst of all, though, is the camerawork.  Along with a bunch of weird angles, there's the fact that the camera's steady moments are few and far between.  All of this permeates Diecovery with an inescapable - and decidedly poisonous - air of amateur filmmaking.",1207785600,2,3473,4.569354838709677
8095596,2,B000C3L28O,"Ok I'll start by giving the correct technical information on this film.  It's in Thai, not Japanese.  It does have English subtitles.  But it does not have an English dubbed track.  It's in mono sound.

Diecovery is a story based on a spirits revenge.  The film starts with two women arguing.  Sunee is angry at her (husband?) who she accuses of never loving her.  Apparently she believes he married her for her money, and title to her properties.  During the argument, Sunee charges the other female, who is supposedly her husbands true wife, and falls over the ledge killing herself.

Fearing they may be implicated in killing her, the remaining couple sew her mouth shut and bury her on the property.  Apparently they also fear that she may haunt them since she died in a rage.  Twenty five years later, another couple goes on a belated honeymoon to the property where Sunee died.  Mook and her husband Ton enjoy their stay at first, but soon discover strange occurences around the property.  Mook starts seeing things such as blood skirting from a hose on the property owenr.  And both Mook and Ton keep encountering a snake on the property which Ton would really like to kill.

As the movie progresses we discover that the current owners of the property were the same couple who buried Sunee 25 years earlier.  We also get more information about Sunee which contradicts the previous story.  Apparently she tried to use black magic on the current owners husband to steal him from her.  That was the reason for the argument 25 years earlier.  I couldn't really tell which story was the correct one. But what is important is that Sunee returns from the grave angered.  She wishes to get revenge on the owners, and tries to possess Mook, since both women are linked by being born on the same day and time of the month.

As the story progresses we see Sunee creeping around the property haunting some individuals.  She does kill 3 low life hired hands and attempts to take over Mook.  Things sort themselves out in the end, I won't spoil it for you.

Well I don't know what to say about this one by Tokyo Shock.  It was a strange choice for them to release.  I didn't find it very scary, which was likely do to the production value.  Low budgeted and poorly acted in some parts.  While the prodcution value is not great, the story is actually not bad for an Asian ghost film.  It would have come across better if it had been given a bigger budget.  Which brings me back to Tokyo Shock.  I know Tokyo shock must have had better choices than this to release to an American audience.  My wife happens to be Vietnamese so I am familiar with the Asian style of low budgeted cinema. But to whom  Tokyo Shock was catering to here I'm not sure.  My guess it was a test to see how well people would react to this type of film.  Taiseng  Video did something similar with made for TV Kung Fu series' and has had some success. Maybe Tokyo Shock had the same idea in mind.  Diecovery does come across like it was made for TV.

Overall I found the film interesting.  It had a good story.  Reason for the two stars.  My advice is that most people will not want to keep this film unless they happen to speak Thai.  It dosn't have a great production value, and it dosn't really deliver the goods as far as scares.  Try to rent it if your interested in seeing it.  But really Tokyo Shock has far superior choices out there if you really want an Asian horror flick.",1203033600,3,3446,4.4432
8095597,1,B000C3L28O,"I can't even list all of the problems with this film here-not only would it take too long, but I can't even remember all of the mistakes made because there were so many! The Thai film begins with a couple going on their honeymoon to a small resort outside the city. They soon find out that the resort is haunted by the spirit of a murdered young woman, who died after she was betrayed by the man whom supposedly loved her but in fact, was only using her. He was really in love with his ex-wife; they had divorced only so he could marry the doomed woman to dupe her into signing over the deed to the resort. When she discovered she'd been used, she went mad and dove at the ex-wife to attack her but instead missed and went over a porch rail, falling to her death.

First off, the woman threw herself at the ex-wife to attack her but missed by a highway mile before going over the railing. She wasn't even close. Second, she fell all of about ten feet-hardly enough to be deadly unless she was impaled upon something. Then the ex-wife drags her body all the way up the stairs to the porch again to sew her mouth closed (an ancient superstition) before dragging her back down the stairs to bury her. Who would drag a body, weighing as much as your own weight, up a flight of stairs just to sew the lips shut, then drag it back down again?

Then they buried her in a shallow grave and ""covered"" it with a picnic table. The mound under the table was ridiculously obvious and yet we're supposed to believe nobody discovered this grave site or the body for 25 years. Yeah, and there weren't any animals in the jungle to dig it up, either!

I could go on and on about how laughable this film was but it isn't even worth laughing over. It was just plain bad acting and bad directing.",1180483200,2,1775,4.245562130177515
