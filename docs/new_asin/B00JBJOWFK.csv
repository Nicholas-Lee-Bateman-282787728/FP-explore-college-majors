6353995,4,B00JBJOWFK,"""Elektra"" is in no sense a typical opera:  a single act, highly dissonant music, and a plot taken from Greek legend.  First staged in 1909 it was intended to have shock value and more than a century later it continues to have that effect.  This performance and this recording of the work is excellent.

I do not claim to be an expert on ""Elektra"" but I do come to it as a reasonably experienced opera-goer.  (Thirty years of anything is reasonable experience.)  I first saw the work in the 1980s at the San Francisco Opera.  Heard live and with relatively little experience, I found the opera hard to appreciate:  I remember thinking of it as slightly painful to hear and having a profound relief that it only runs one act.  Seen later, with more experience, and on this DVD, I finally found that appreciation.  The vocal performances of this challenging music are uniformly strong, with Evelyn Herlitzius singing an outstanding Elektra,  She is passionate and unforgiving, both musically and emotionally, throughout.  The production is minimally staged (Patrice Chereau's final production) and the camera work is just active enough (moving from long shots to closeups and otherwise changing angles) to be visually interesting without becoming distracting.  Esa-Pekka Salonen conducts a detailed and precise performance which is rendered in an admirably clear DTS recording.

I will pick one nit, which lead me to give the disc four rather than five stars.  The English language subtitles are presented in an almost halting fashion, almost jerky.  Yes, they match the sung lyrics, but if you miss one, you've missed the line, and the subtitle disappears even if the musical line continues.  If you don't speak German (and I don't, at least not well enough to follow this dialogue), this presentation of the subtitles has the unintended effect of drawing the eye from the stage action to the titles themselves.  The titles are also cast in a dated English, a sort of pseudo-Shakespearian prose.  Both these perceived flaws may come from the origin of the opera itself:  Strauss wrote the music to set Hugo von Hofmannsthal's treatment of ""Elektra"" to music, and conceivably the titles are trying to preserve Hofmannsthal's meter.  (If I were a truly dedicated student of the opera, I'd read the poem to find out...but I'll leave that as an exercise for someone else.)

Overall this is a great disc to own if you like Strauss, enjoy this opera, or if you are curious about it.  For that last group, I actually think approaching it from the comfort of your own living room may outweigh the excitement of live performance, at least for a first exposure.  If twentieth century dissonant music is not your cup of tea, rent before you buy.",1423785600,3,2732,4.901960784313726
6353996,5,B00JBJOWFK,"This recent, but already famous production, earns all of its enthusiastic reviews. The disc is a chance for all of us that were not present in Ax en Provence where it was produced in 2013 to experience it as best as a film can mimic sitting in the opera house. Apart from the illuminating and always appropriate production of Strauss' take on the Greek play, and story of revenge, even onto the killing of one's mother, there is the singing of  the lead role which is outstanding. The balance of the cast fits perfectly the roles and production and fits more closely to the story then any production I have seen - and I have seen some famous ones.",1423353600,2,647,4.436974789915967
6353997,3,B00JBJOWFK,"It is given to certain women the courage, the voice, the stamina and the brilliance to sing the entire length of Strauss' Elektra and to do it proud. Evelyn Herlitzius is not one of them. This 1909 one act tour-de-force of Richard Strauss based on a play after Sophacles by Hugo von Hoffmannsthal came only a few years after his first opera, the one act tour-de-force 'Salome' of 1905. Both center around a deranged woman oppressed by the world of men. In both operas, the composer has stretched tonality and passages of atonality for dramatic effect. But neither should be thought of as ""flag wavers"" for the ""new music"" fervor that was going on in Germany and Austria at that time. The next collaboration of Hoffannsthal and Strauss was to be 'Der Rosenkavalier'.
Elektra has always had a special place in my opera pantheon. My first Elektra was the 1949 Vienna LP recording under the great conductor Dimitri  Metropolis with Astrid Varnay. I played it almost every day for months (perhaps too much). Since then I have heard a number of great singers in that role e.g. Cristal Goltz, Birgit Nilsson and Leonie Rysanek.
This recording does have one fine portrait that is the Klytemnestra of Waltraud Meier. Often done as an ugly, deranged harpy, Ms Meier did her as a fearful, ageing, sleepless guilt-ridden women but still the royal person that she was born. She was no monster but almost sympathetic. Adrianne Pieczonka is also a long suffering and commendable sister Chrysothemis (also a new invention from Sophocles) to Elektra. She wants only to live a normal woman's life. She wants to care for babies and not for revenge.
The staging also disturbed me. Yes, this is set in a garbage dump but it is outside a royal palace. This is a Greek myth play after all with nobles and Gods battling each other. The people and the servants should look Greek and royal and not outfitted at the local Goodwill!
There is no Elektra in old Greek mythology or pre-classic epics. She appears first as a cypher but important as Choephoroe in Aeschylus  series Oresteia. But she develops more into a strong personality in Sophocles 'Electra' and a self effacing psychologically challenged person in Euripides' Electra written at about the same time. Hoffmannsthal used bits of both to form his character for the opera. (The play by Hoffmansthal was given performances before Strauss proposed making an opera.) What Strauss and Hoffmannsthal have created is an epic encounter of tremendous opposing forces of Gods and Men. As the curtain falls here, the next chapter in this relentless tale (The Oresteia) is already unfolding. Elektra is dead but Orestes will be pursued by the 'Furies' for all of his remaining years because he is a royal son and has killed his royal mother. (Fodder for more operas)

I have tremendous respect for Patrice Chereau but this appears an unfinished product.",1416787200,9,2876,4.865306122448979
6353998,5,B00JBJOWFK,"Elektra is based on the Greek tragedy by Sophocles, the story of a girl who had only one loving parent, and watched her mother and her mother's lover murder her beloved father, Agamemnon.

Since that horrifying moment of her father's death, Elektra and her sister, Chrysothemis had been imprisoned in a dungeon in the palace.  Although Chrysothemis had desires of living a normal life, she felt hampered and constrained by her sister's constant longing for revenge.  Elektra could think only of justice--the murder of her mother and stepfather.

Gruesome as the plot sounds, it can be (and is here!) a captivating story of living only for the hope for justice--for revenge.
The singing, acting, and staging are perfect for this dark story, with nice touches I've not seen in many other productions:

There is more acting interaction between Elektra and her brother, Orest, as he watches her unwrap the axe she has saved and hidden after her father's murder--so that it can be used on his killers.

He listens with growing understanding as she sings of how he didn't at first recognize her, because her imprisonment had resulted in such debasement that she was barely recognizable as a princess:  ""This hair, which used to make men tremble, is now stringy and matted.""  She's ashamed that she's been deprived of her humanity, and has become a crazed animal.

Perhaps only one who has felt the pain of being terribly wronged can appreciate Elektra's mental state.

German soprano Evelyn Herlitzius has all the energy of a crazed Elektra.  Her delirious, jerky dancing in celebration of ""revenge realized"" is a frenzied ecstasy.  Despite the sustained dramatic tension, after the curtain falls, she is still ""high"" on the enthusiasm of her performance, and practically drags director Patrice Chereau forward for more grateful applause from the audience.  Adrianne Pieczonka sings and acts a Chrysothemis sometimes bewildered by her sister's obsession with revenge.

Waltraud Meier shows us a somewhat different than the usual Klytemnestra.  She is not as garishly dressed and insane as most of the ""Elektra's mothers"" have been portrayed.  She is so evil that (perhaps like many serial killers) she is unaware or has pushed from her memory the depravity of her murderous actions.

All in all, a wonderful Elektra, that will have you transfixed from start to dramatic finish!",1416096000,11,2371,5.101036269430052
6353999,4,B00JBJOWFK,"A daughter yearns to avenge the murder of her father, her sister just wants to have a life, and her brother comes back after a long absence to kill the murderer and his wife -- who just so happens to be the mother of the three siblings.  Not exactly the most appealing and attractive plot. Richard Strauss has taken this story, which has evolved from a story by Sophocles to a drama by von Hofmannsthal, and composed a thrilling and captivating opera.  He paints each psychological portrait with his music, an almost 90 minutes of buildup to the sonic explosion of vengeance achieved.
This opera is all about the music. The orchestra is unusually big with a wide range of sonic effects, masterfully used by the composer.  This Blu-Ray is specially fitted to provide the watcher (and listener) with the full experience.  Patrice Chereau lets the music do the talking. It is a somber and sometimes dark stage, perfectly fitted for the tragedy unfolding and the dark psychological scenes. Chereau passed away a few months after the performance; this Blu-Ray was dedicated to him.
The singers and orchestra are impressive. Salonen was able to balance this huge orchestra with each singers voice, giving the orchestra its full sound participation without overshadowing the singers.
The English subtitles are annoying.  The language is archaic and difficult to follow. As the music is the upmost component of the opera, it is a shame to have to devote attention and focus to trying to understand the translated libretto.
A musical thrill. Highly recommended.",1415318400,3,1552,4.976833976833976
6354000,5,B00JBJOWFK,"Amazon has mistakenly posted two three-star reviews for another production in this thread, bringing down the average for this Aix festival production. (t's not clear what production the 2-star review is referring to, but it may be this one--it is definitely dark). In any case, I wholly agree with the two five-star reviews. This Chreau production, shown only four months before his premature death from lung cancer, left me completely wrung out. The intensity of Evelyn Herlitzius's Elektra is almost frightening. The words ""pity and fear,"" which Aristotle used to define the effect of tragedy, came readily to mind. It's as if what we are seeing here were literally true. After this, the Lehnhoff producton from Salzburg seems to me very much just a performance, albeit a very good one.

I am thrilled that this production is coming to the Met, although I think Christina Goerke, as wonderful a singer as she is, will have a hard time matching the shattering intensity of Herlitzius's wrenching performance. This is a must-have for anyone who cares for this astonishing opera.",1415232000,4,1078,5.056179775280899
6354001,2,B00JBJOWFK,"As others have said this is beautifully sung and the sounds is magnificent. UNFORTUNATELY it has two terrible faults: The picture is so dark at times one can hardly see what is going on on stage. In the opera house with opera glasses that may not be a big issue but on disc where there is no way to easily lighten things up it is a disaster. The second issue is for those who need ENGLISH subtitles. The other languages are fine but for English this production has used an obscure translation that is almost incomprehensibe. To make matters even worse they are on screen only fleetingly and there is not enough time to read them let alone work out what they are trying to tell you. Subtitles are a functional tool to tell you what the singers are singing about, they are NOT a test of the translator's ability to concoct mediaeval English!! The Salzburg production is the Elektra to get, this one has sadly shot itself fatally in the heart which is such a shame as musically it is wonderful.",1410134400,11,991,4.450549450549451
6354002,5,B00JBJOWFK,"This is an Elektra not to be missed! Its incredibly dramatic, one of the few that has come along recently in the 2000's and one of the BEST! Evelyn Herlitzius portrayed the venegeful daughter with such zeal not seen since Rysanek and Nilsson, this woman is one of the few who actually dances, and what a set of lungs this lady has, her low and high notes and every note in between amazing. She approaches Elektra with style, and the same can be said with Waltraud Meier as Clytemnestra. I saw Waltraud in the 2010 production at the Salzburg festival which was very good as well, but here she portrays a woman that isn't hell bent on sacrifice and hate for her daughter,but rather a woman haunted by her crime and in fact has maternal feelings yet for Elektra. Patrice Chereau, saddly is no longer with us, this was his last production unfortunately. This production is chock full of great performers and singers, and there are quite a few surprises in it for those who appreciate a great Elektra (which is often times done very wrong.) And this production was the production I've waited for since Nilsson and Rysanek. I would not miss this production, it is one of the best!",1409616000,18,1174,4.568720379146919
6354003,5,B00JBJOWFK,"Just what those few left who take opera, music and theater seriously have lost with Chereau's passing last October is made abundantly clear by this performance. As in a previous generation Boulez' antisceptism was set on fire by Chereau's passionate RING, this generation's version, Salonen, when partnered with Chereau's uncompromising theatricality, leads a blazing journey through Hoffmanstahl and Strauss' gargantuan sonic orgy. The cast is as good as it gets these days, and more so in some cases. Waltrud Meier is up to all of this approach, presenting another performance riveting in its understated intensity. Yes, who'd think Klytemnestra could be portrayed as anything other than the grotesque, reeling monster, unreal in both musical and dramatic terms, who is generally encountered? Christa Ludwig lead the way, and now we have Ms Meier's superb incarnation. How any of these singers would fare over such an orchestral orgy of sound in our American barn-sized theaters will, hopefully, be put to the test when this production arrives at the Met. But in this DVD, they come over with no signs of damage. Evelyn Herlitzius is fearless if non-stop forte, and Adrianne Pieczonka's sound provides a more traditionally Straussian foil. But they and a starry supporting cast are clearly in it together, following through the searing, austere line of Chereau's production (which is gorgeously lit, as always). This is the kind of artistry that asks questions, digs into the text, and accepts nothing on assumption, gratuitous vanity, or unthinking tradition. The piece lives in a place both Classical and modern. Who is out there to carry the torch? Chereau will be greatly missed; this DVD is a superb memorial to his art.",1409529600,24,1727,5.215827338129497
8649634,5,B00JBJOWFK,"With some skepticism brought on by one reviewer's negative comments about Evelyn Herlitzius' Elektra, I at last felt sufficiently prepared to view the video.  Her acting and voice in Vienna's Ring last year was exciting and thoroughly captivating.  She is a genuine singing actress.  I came away with a completely different understanding of the Ring, especially Brunnhilde. It was a magical and moving and memorable experience, one that I never expected to occur.

So, this Elektra?  No need for any skepticism.  It's a fantastic performance in every respect.  As with her Ring's Brunnhilde, Herlitzius is Elektra - a woman gone mad with love so much so that her only hope lies in revenge.  She loves her brother and sister so very, very much which makes her madness even more sad.  You are drawn into her psychosis to the point that her final dance is almost unbearable to witness.  This a performance I will watch often.  Now, we have to wait for the DVD of Stemme's Elektra at the Met.

Which begs a question.  Why did the Met choose Stemme over Herlitzius given the latter's Aix-en-Provence triumph?  Not to be disappointed, however.  From the reviews we have two great Elektra's.",1463702400,2,1184,4.8793969849246235

8649643,5,B00JBJOWFK,"By the time of his death in the autumn of 2013, months after the acclaimed premiere of this ELEKTRA at Aix-en-Provence, Patrice Ch&eacute;reau's standing as opera director was that of the widely respected, even beloved veteran. A senior singer such as the bass Ferruccio Furlanetto (once his Don Giovanni) could cite him as an example of theatrical vision allied to professionalism and musical sensitivity, while criticizing younger directors of the 21st-century Regietheater vanguard. But in the 1970s, Ch&eacute;reau had enraged and provoked with his Bayreuth Centenary RING, and in those days, he was compared unfavorably to Wieland Wagner...who had enraged and provoked in the 1950s with his bold disregard for his grandfather's explicit stage directions. As time moves on, and the composition of audiences changes, expectations are adjusted and reactions evolve.

Richard Peduzzi created the sets for all of Ch&eacute;reau's opera productions, and most of these have received commercial video release: the RING, WOZZECK, COS&Igrave; FAN TUTTE, TRISTAN UND ISOLDE, FROM THE HOUSE OF THE DEAD, now ELEKTRA. Peduzzi's work apart from Ch&eacute;reau (for example, the current Met TOSCA of Luc Bondy) has a consistent aesthetic, with looming walls and generalized ""starkness"" being specialties, but one got the best of him in this ongoing collaboration. He also occasionally makes use of moving platforms. One that carries Klyt&auml;mnestra's body into view reminded me of the stagecraft in the WOZZECK.

I have heard here and there that Ch&eacute;reau could be difficult and demanding, but it obviously did not keep him from assembling a loyal troupe. Donald McIntyre and Franz Mazura (the latter approaching 90 at the time) had worked with the director in the 1970s in the RING and LULU, and they return to the fold in small roles here. So does, in a large role,  Waltraud Meier, whose Marie in his WOZZECK began a fruitful partnership that included, memorably, a lioness-in-winter Isolde at La Scala. Roberta Alexander is the Fifth Maid. This assemblage of veteran talent in small and large roles gives the director's last opera staging the feel of both a reunion and a sendoff for someone embarking on a journey without them. Perhaps Ch&eacute;reau knew it was the end of the line.

Ch&eacute;reau talks in the bonus interview on the DVD about his decision to cast the Fifth Maid with the oldest soprano of the bunch, when usually she has the youngest, lightest voice. He feels this should be the member of the group with the longest, strongest memory of Elektra and Orestes in better times, to account for her loyalty. He also feels that an old woman being beaten is more upsetting and terrible than a 19-year-old girl being beaten. He and Alexander give this idea logic and validity. More than by the beating, I was very moved some time later (during the part of the opera when Orestes is believed dead), when the camera catches Alexander's face with brimming eyes, a single tear sliding down. This is a great image. She has quite a presence on the perimeter here, and the Aix-en-Provence crowd gives her what must be the lustiest ovation ever for a Fifth Maid.

Ch&eacute;reau's sympathy also encompasses Aegisth. I had just seen the tenor Tom Randle as the Painter in LULU, and I know he recently created the role of Jack Twist in BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN. We usually get either a character tenor in the Gerhard Stoltze mold or the remains of a former Siegmund/Florestan like James King, rather than a lead tenor in his prime. Randle gets a great moment when he sees the body of his bride laid out, the victim of brutal murder. He runs to her and takes her hand. He is horrified and also, immediately, grieving, in the few moments he has left.

If I were listening to an audio recording of this performance, I would not like it as much. Maestro Esa-Pekka Salonen goes for extremes, with the effect that some scenes feel ""milked"" for dramatic tension and reaction. Among my ELEKTRAs, this one is toward the slower end of the scale, running 10 minutes longer than the Abbado/Kupfer. But my sense is that Salonen is not just dawdling and savoring for the sake of it. Every tempo has been worked out with the details of the staging, and he and Ch&eacute;reau and the singers have arrived at a timetable that has inner logic.

I had never heard a complete performance of anything with this Elektra, Evelyn Herlitzius, and what I hear is a sound with a lot of strength and force behind it, but a rough sound. The greatness in the performance, beyond her uninhibited stage acting, is in the way she handles the text and the music. She is bang-on with the rhythms, the intervals, the pitches. You have to put up with a fair amount of flapping on the sustained notes, but you never doubt she *has* the notes, nor her ability to pin you back with them. She impresses with visceral commitment, seeming to be feeling and experiencing the drama in her whole body, and it is quite a show. She is lithe and looks less than her nearly 50 years; I was reminded at moments of the younger Sigourney Weaver. At this writing, the production is slated for the Met with Nina Stemme taking over, and I could well imagine Stemme singing it ""better,"" certainly with more steadiness of emission. Can she be this dynamic, this (no pun intended) electrifying on the stage? Perhaps there will be gains and losses.

Walrtaud Meier is getting on a bit (she was 57), and even under broadcast/video conditions, I can hear that the voice has lost something in size when compared to performances she was giving 10-15 years ago. But it is a good role for her at this juncture, and not just because she does the usual Waltraud Meier things, the brilliant word-coloring and individual phrase-shaping. It is because a hint of frailty and diminishing powers is not out of place in this role. When she and Herlitzius are on stage together, two Germans who know exactly what they are singing and have the full measure of their characters, it is not only great music theater, it is great theater, period. I would pay to see them act the Hugo von Hofmannsthal play version. Here we get superlative musicianship with it -- so much the better. I had first seen Meier's Klyt&auml;mnestra in Lehnhoff's 2010 production for Salzburg, and she gave a similar performance there, a vulnerable, ""human"" queen. Here, with her favorite director, she is allowed to go even further, because Lehnhoff has a taste for camp that has to be appeased, and so he has her enter the scene in turban, sunglasses, and fur wrap, and she gradually sheds those accoutrements of hauteur as the scene gets closer to the bone. At Aix-en-Provence, she is very accessible and raw from the start; there are no airs to penetrate. This is not a waxwork horror, just a sorely beset woman of middle age, still regal and glamorous, who did a terrible thing for her own reasons and is tormented by the fallout.

The big Elektra/Chrysothemis and Elektra/Klyt&auml;mnestra scenes, I felt, were as completely worked out as any I had ever seen. In stage and musical direction, there is an ""ultimate performance"" quality to them, everyone involved seeming to breathe as one. I was slightly let down, then, by the scene with Orestes. Maybe the bar had been set very high, or maybe the very fine Mikhail Petrenko was not quite up to the engagement of the others. For whatever reason, after a promising beginning, that scene sagged a bit, more than anything else in the opera. When the senior members of the household staff intrude to crowd around Orestes and take turns hugging him, the irreverent side of me could not help thinking of the old timers of Cecil B. DeMille's film crew paying homage to Norma Desmond. Still, the early brother/sister exchanges are as well staged as I have ever seen them. Elektra is some distance away and not even looking at Orestes. It would be impossible for her to recognize him.

Adrianne Pieczonka is another very good video Chrysothemis, not as distinctive as her sister and her mother, but the role has been fortunate on video (Studer, Voigt, Westbroek).

An archaic translation in the subtitles is a minor nuisance, though not as bad as it could have been. A bigger problem, in my opinion, is that the translations come and go quickly, almost as though the captioning service was apologetic about intruding on the Ch&eacute;reau/Peduzzi stage pictures. It is tough to grapple with mayhaps and thouests and fains *and* read everything in a glance, and I am a fast reader -- I usually have time to read a subtitle several times before it moves on. Not here. I was grateful for my familiarity with the opera and its source material.

I would not want to be without the ELEKTRA DVDs of Kupfer, Lehnhoff, and now Ch&eacute;reau for this opera, and the better technical reproduction of the last two (which are very recent; Kupfer's is 25 years old) gives them the edge. There is more of Sophocles in the Lehnhoff, albeit with his own camp-horror overlay. But Strauss's ELEKTRA is not straight Sophocles, it is Sophocles via Hugo von Hofmannsthal, incorporating Freudian elements from its own early-20th-century era. Now Ch&eacute;reau has taken some of his own liberties in adapting *that* (bringing the murders on stage, changing stage action to give Chrysothemis's final cry a new meaning). I find his the deeper, more sober treatment than Lehnhoff's, one I expect to wear better. Lehnhoff may have the slightly stronger cast, vocally speaking, and it is quite a murderers' row (Theorin, Westbroek, Meier, Pape, Gambill). In the all-important role of Elektra, I prefer Herlitzius to Theorin.

Ch&eacute;reau was much more than an opera director, but he ended a fascinating career in that discipline on a high. I never saw a bad opera production by him, and now I never will.",1423785600,10,9819,4.858422939068101
