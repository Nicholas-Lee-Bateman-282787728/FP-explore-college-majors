8635518,1,B00HSOIRY2,Don't waste your time on this movie. Even illogical things have some logic because you can easily detect where they went wrong.  This movie is beyond illogical.  It will drive you crazy.,1465948800,,186,4.78125
8635519,2,B00HSOIRY2,"This movie felt like a high school film project gone wrong. Pretentious attemp to address mental disease, and point out Czech racism against Romani people, and perhaps also advertise the touristy sights of the Czech Republic. Well, it all falls flat, and you are left with puzzled look on your face.

Chandan, mentally sick architecture student travels to Prague. There, he meets Elena, a dancer, who claims to be Czech. Unfortunately for every Czech speaker, it is obvious that Elena's Czech is grammatically broken, and heavily accented. I was grateful for English subtitles, otherwise it would be hard to understand what Elena meant to be saying. Never mind that, most viewers probably don't speak Czech anyway.

Then it turns out, that Elena's native langauge is actually Russian. I'm confused, but I'm not giving up. OK, I'm thinking, so she must be a Russian &eacute;migr&eacute; with Czech citizenship. But then it turns out, that she is actually Roma (despite the fact, that the Czech population has accepted the term ""Roma"" or ""Romani"", people in this movie keep stubbornly referring to our Romani population as ""Gypsies"". Intentionally offensive? Idk. That goes even for Chandar and Elena who hold very strong pro-Romani feelings.) Why would a Russian Romani go to the Czech Republic if this movie is telling us that Czechs are not tolerant to Roma? Again, I don't know.

Elena wants to visit her Roma grandmother, so she takes Chandan to Lety (there used to be an interment Camp for Romani during World War II). Thanks to this, the director squeezes in some nice travel footage of Czech countryside. It was little surprising that in order to go southwest to Lety, Chandan and Elena head east first to Sedlec u Kutne Hory, but, yes I get it, this movie is not about logic, and the beautiful Ossuary in Sedlec was just too hard to pass. The grandma meeting is supposed to be only spiritual, grandma is probably long dead. Idk. But I don't ask anymore. I just let this mess evolve in hope that I'll see some more pictures of my country - and yes, ofcourse there is couple views of Charles Bridge in sunset, and some disjointed shots of St. Vitus. There, I can be happy. The climax is that Elena is pregnant, and deals with the situation, while Chandan resolves his relationship with his imaginary friends, caused by his disease. Or maybe not. Who knows?

Two stars - only because I got to see some Czech sights, and hear some native Czech (not Elena's). But then, I could have just watched a travel video instead..",1464825600,,2522,4.7908045977011495
