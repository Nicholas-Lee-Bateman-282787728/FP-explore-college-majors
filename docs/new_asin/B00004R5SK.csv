1341136,4,B00004R5SK,"Hey. I'm Win Harrison, but my middle name is 'Towne', named after the Towne sisters of the Salem Witch Trials. My great (great great...) grandmother was Rebecca Towne Nurse. The oldest one of my 3 great great aunts the Towne Sisters. All 3 were accused, only one survived. The survivor, Sarah Towne's story - 'Three Sovereigns for Sarah' - tells the story with horrifying accuracy. Ignorance, jealousy, land ownership - every soul should see it to understand what hatred can do...
There are flaws in this Public Television film. Much of the soundtrack is over the top and more fitting to a Hammer Horror production (though I suppose the material is fitting). The print is so-so, with cheap set-design and cheap lighting duking it out the way only early '80s PBS work could. It is interesting that the '80s was absolutely the worst decade for child performers. This movie proves it - most of the kids in this movie are pretty awful (never as fine as the best moments in 'The Crucible'). But as shaky as the film starts, you can't help but be caught in the hysteria. Most dialogue is in historical record, and this is a worthy film. Highly recommended...",1017705600,14,1152,4.707920792079208
1341137,5,B00004R5SK,"Recently my wife and I took our children back to New England for a visit.  When we were at Salem, I was disappointed in all of the tourist hype.  I remember watching this movie on PBS when my wife and I lived in Massachusetts, so I began looking for it in the gift shops.  Unfortunately the witch museum gift shops contained only tarot cards, crystals and things with witches on them.  Fortunately I found the video here.  I can't wait for my children to see it and gain a better appreciation of the history behind the hysteria.",998265600,5,528,4.402061855670103

I do not believe there is a better movie showing America's Puritan past, as well as the awful Salem witch trials. Another one of those 'you are there' epics, the THREE SOVEREIGNS FOR SARAH is a must see for all students of American history. Knowing that this was filmed in the actual buildings where the original events happened sends shivers down my spine.  Now, where's the DVD of this movie?",988329600,39,483,4.551724137931035

The story was one of the most interesting and deeply-moving ones that I had ever seen, and inspired me to visit Salem with my family.  Finding the Rebecca Nurse farmhouse was probably the highlight of our trip.

1341146,5,B00004R5SK,I've tried to find this movie (though now I realize it was a PBS mini series) for more than 10 years.  When I found it on Netflix I decided to see if Amazon sold it.  I was pleased that they did.  This is the story of the Salem witch trials when a group of teen girls and compliant adults persecuted members of the community to take their land.

It is a historically accurate portrayal of the Salem witch trials of 1692.  Academy Award winning actors portray the historical figures.  If you are looking for historical accuracy rather than made for television fiction (e.g. AMCs Salem) this is your source.  As indicated on the DVDs case: All of the costumes, locations, buildings and props offer a rare, authentic glimpse of the late 1600s in America.""",1463875200,4,519,5.0588235294117645

1341181,5,B00004R5SK,"When I was in Salem two decades ago with my two sisters, sis-in-law and my mom, I had no idea that I was viewing my family's history. This film brought to life the heart-wrenching story of my 8x Great Grandmother, Sarah Towne as well as my two 8x Great Grand Aunts, Rebecca and Mary. This film portrays a very difficult and desperate time in our history, and Vanessa Redgrave was so convincing in her role as Sarah, that you believe you are watching Sarah's life unfold before your eyes, sad as it was. I believe it is important that this tragic time in our history is portrayed by the truths of what actually and factually occurred, and this film accomplishes that very well. Clearly, these events were spurred by greed, power, jealousy, grudges, dislike, etc., and had nothing to do with any sort of witchcraft at all. Sarah was quite courageous for having endured being jailed and treated so inhumanely, and then fighting to clear the good names of her sisters, who endured the same inhuman jailing, and subsequent hangings.

When you realize that Rebecca was on trial three times, found innocent twice, but found guilty for not answering as swiftly as they thought she should, and then finding that she was hard of hearing, makes this story that much more tragically sad. Aside from the witch hysteria and the resulting horrific and senseless hangings, this film portrays a realistic presentation of the world of Colonial America, in which the Puritans lived. It certainly makes the comfort of one's own living room, while watching this film, feel quite like a palace in comparison.

I have learned so much about Ipswich, Sudbury, Salem End and Framingham, Massachusetts while researching genealogy and this film helped bring those people and that time in our history to life. The colonial settlers endured great hardships, and many of us would not be here if they hadn't done so. It is humbling to see ... from whence we came.

I highly recommend.,1272758400,2,337,4.728813559322034
1341200,5,B00004R5SK,"I read about the trials in grade school, and have heard about them my whole life, as I'm sure every American has (not to exclude others). In the mid-1990's, I visited Boston and had a chance to visit Salem. It was October and they were gearing up for Halloween, so the town was decked out with a witch theme. In the historic Old Town, they had reenactments of the trials and walking tours of the town. Okay?

Turns out I knew next to nothing about what happened. Granted, I could read up on the subject on Wikipedia, but I happened to watch this last night (my wife bought it to show her 8th grade class) and felt transported! Visiting the modern town of Salem, you can't understand the isolated lives led by the people of Salem Village. It was a harsh life, cold in the winter, just hard the rest of the time, a half day's ride to Salem Town, and a day or more by ship to Boston.

Petty village politics over land disputes were common. The village council was afraid of villagers who would soon inherit or buy land, thus raising their status to the point where they could vote the current leaders off. Combined with an intensely religious view of life, imbued as it was with rampant superstition, these were a powder keg waiting for a match.

That match came in the form of the new preacher, who coming was opposed by a number of village leaders. The preacher's young daughters, with their Caribe Indian slave Tituba, started playing fortune-telling games with some local girls. When they were caught, they claimed they were being attacked by the invisible specter of certain people who were actually witches. When anyone questioned their inane, they started their fits again, claiming that new person was also a witch. And the town council arrested dozens of people on suspicion of witchcraft.

You might say, ""My invisible specter attacked you, invisibly, and drank your blood from an invisible wound? Yeah, right!"" But people bought it. And if you rub your hands together nervously? You're a witch. Have a mole? It's really a third nipple, from which the devil sucks your blood. Actually able to say the Lord's Prayer, even though a witch isn't supposed to be able to recite it? The (invisible) devil must be whispering the words in your ear.

Infuriating!!! But it really happened, and I'm glad I watched it. And forget about ergot. This movie makes a very good case that the trials were more about politics than religion.",1271808000,6,2427,4.648018648018648
1341201,4,B00004R5SK,"I used this movie for my 8th grade American History class.  The kids really seemed to enjoy it! It was probably the most historically accurate movie regarding the Trials that I have seen.  Not only did it bring the Witch Trials to life, it allowed the kids to see what life was like during the 17th century as far as general info. - New England climate, government, church, dress, speak,etc...It is not really graphic, just realistic, but I did forwarn the students about parts that may make them uncomfortable.

1341202,5,B00004R5SK,"""Three Sovereigns for Sarah"" [1985] was part of the American Playhouse series, an anthology television series periodically broadcast by PBS. I have watched most dramatizations of the Salem Witch Trials, be it the History channel's docudrama about the Salem Witch Trials, The Crucible [based on Arthur Miller's work], and more recently Salem Witch Trials [2003 CBS mini-series]. Three Sovereigns for Sarah stands as a gripping reenactment of the tragic events that unfolded in Salem village in 1692 and tells the compelling story of the victims, focusing on three sisters accused of witchcraft.

The main star of this production is Vanessa Redgrave who plays Sarah Cloyce, one of the three accused sisters during the Salem Witch Trials. It's been 10 years since the tragic events of 1692 in which 20 innocent people were put to death for witchcraft [19 hanged, one pressed to death]. Sarah is aging and frail in health and is accompanied by her nephew Samuel Nurse [whose mother Rebecca Nurse was one of those hanged] and goes to Boston to see the English magistrates [who are representing the Queen] and seeking vindication for her and her sisters. Sarah tells the magistrates her story in the hopes that they will be convinced of her and her sisters' innocence.

Sarah takes them all via flashback to the year 1692 when all the troubles began - in the Reverend Parris' household [minister of Salem Village] whose house slave Tituba [Sylvia Ann Soares] passes idle time by indulging young Abigail Williams [Parris' niece] and Bette Parris in dangerous pursuits such as palm-reading and crystal gazing. Not long after a couple of the other village girls begin to attend Tituba's sessions such as Ann Putnam Jr whose mother Ann Putnam Sr is an embittered woman who manipulates her own child for her and her husband's advancement in the community.

Eventually, the girls start accusing townspeople of witchcraft, including Sarah Cloyce's devout sister, the aging and ailing Rebecca Nurse [Phyllis Thaxter]. Soon after, Sarah herself is accused followed by her other sister Mary [Maria Todd]. As the beginning of the story already mentions the fact that both of Sarah's sisters are found guilty and hanged, the rest of the story focuses on Sarah's retelling of the events, with the aim of convincing the magistrates of her and her sisters' innocence.

I liked this production particularly for its historical accuracy. Actual transcripts of the trials were used in the production which added to its' authenticity. What elevated the show for me though was Vanessa Redgrave's compelling portrayal of the wronged and anguished Sarah Cloyce. Be it in her narration of the events [her voice manages to evoke all the pain and horror of the times] or in her acting, she is truly magnificent and ably carries the production. The other adult actors did a credible job too, especially Shay Duffin as Judge Hathorne, the only judge who never repented of his actions and who also happens to be the ancestor of author Nathaniel Hawthorne [of Scarlet Letter and House of the Seven Gables].

The child actors though left much to be desired. I felt they were not very convincing in their roles as the 'afflicted' victims of witchcraft and more annoying than menacing in their expressions of malice.

The production values seemed rather cheap compared to the 2003 CBS mini-series which is to be expected, but what truly annoyed me was the background music. The banging drums in particular seemed really out of place and were played at the most inopportune times.

But those small gripes aside, Vanessa Redgrave's narration and acting truly makes this production a must-see, and it's historical accuracy makes Three Sovereigns for Sarah a compelling and authentic retelling of the Salem Witch Trials. Highly recommended!",1224288000,13,3797,5.075320512820513
1341203,5,B00004R5SK,"Three Sovereigns for Sarah is, without doubt, the best dramatic presentation of the horrific events of 1692.  Without melodrama and remaining true to history this captivating DVD shows how politics mixed with fear leads to persecution and the public sanction of the suspension of civil rights.  A poignant message and warning.

1341205,5,B00004R5SK,"I have watched Three Sovereigns for Sarah because Vanessa Redgrave one of my favorite actress is in it. I also was curious about the Salem Witch Trials. The only thing I knew about it was from the play The Crucible. The film was very realistic and it really showed the victims as people and the impact their executions had on their families. This movie is an excellent case why religion and the law do not mix and should be kept seperate and also how bad blood and land disputes can escalate into an unimaginable horror. I think the film really showed how the adults instead of stopping the children helped encourage them for their own gain and feed into what they were doing. Sarah Cloyce played by Vanessa Redgrave was an amazing, courageous woman. She fought for her sisters, and herself, and did not back down. I thought what she did in clearing her sisters name was so courageous and moving. Through it all she never sunk to the accuser's level and showed such courage- that to me really stood out. So, I would recommend this movie to anyone for the excellent acting and for the lessons it teaches us.

1341206,5,B00004R5SK,"Lord,have mercy on us all!!

This film came recommended by a friend and I am writing this review angry,incensed,upset,sad and still in disbelief at what I just saw in American Playhouse's PBS DVD release of the 1985 ""Three Sovereigns for Sarah."" Not only is this story totally true,based from the original transcripts of the horrific Salem Witch Trials of 1692,but the acting done by legends Vanessa Redgrave,Kim Hunter and Phyllis Thatcher as the three accused sisters, is one of the most impressive bits of female ensemble acting I have ever seen!

If you are familiar with the famous play ""The Crucible"" by Arthur Miller concerning the havoc that little girls played in 1692 Salem,Massachusetts that resulted in the senseless and unjust death of twenty people accused of witchcraft, then this story will feel quite uncomfortably familiar. I say uncomfortably because Miller's work,though extremely compelling and was made into a successful film,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Crucible/dp/B00013F2S6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Crucible</a>&nbsp;starring Daniel Day-Lewis (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/There-Will-Be-Blood/dp/B000YA9R3C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">There Will Be Blood</a>),was historical fiction.""Three Sovereigns"" IS NOT! You will be accurately transported to 1692 Salem and you will see and hear the accused and their accusers in a way that Miller could only hint at.

I would love right now to type a ton of SPOILERS, but I won't. I must say, that anyone who feels that religion and politics should be mingled,I would challenge them to view this film to see WHY the two don't mix, no matter HOW strong your belief system is.""Three Sovereigns for Sarah"" shows us the terrible plight of people living in a Theocratic Rule in Colonial America as Massachusetts was in 1692. This film is not without hope, though, and certain restitutions eventually are made. RENT THIS,BUY THIS,BORROW THIS or STEAL IT (no not really!) in order to see this.

I still hold this PBS special film to be the penultimate when it comes to exposing the complete truth behind ""the Salem Witch Trials"" of 1692. THREE SOVEREIGNS FOR SARAH concerns the 1711 mission of one Sarah Cloyse,(Vanessa Redgrave) to vindicate the names and reputations of her two sisters Mary Estey and Rebecca Nurse,both falsely accused and hanged as witches in the hysteria and manipulative deceit of greed,jealousy,land disputes and Church politics nineteen years earlier. What makes this retelling of the madness of the time so compelling, is that all of the characters and dialogue comes from the historical records of the time. I have viewed this film countless times since it first premiered in the '80's and still the amount of anxiety and anger that it produces in me is palpable!
I visited Salem,Massachusetts in 2004 and stood in the Memorial Garden where the ""hanging tree"" was for 20 innocent people who were hanged or ""pressed to death"" by the accusations of little girls who were the pawns of manipulative knowing adults. The 'three sovereigns' concerns the three gold coins,each given by an apologetic court,who overturned the verdict for Cloyse,Estey and Nurse. The accuracy of the times,prevailing New England thought,religion and superstition is positively unparalleled for insight and knowledge on this tragic open wound on Early pre-American history.
As A+ as any production can get. 2 and 1/2 hours,divided into 2 episodes. Perfect for teachers,dramatists,and essential in understanding why religion and politics were decided to be separated when the 1776 Founding Fathers drew up their Declaration and Constitution.
I once saw a bumper sticker that read,"" The last time they mixed religion and politics,people were hanged.""",1202688000,8,2311,6.225
1341208,4,B00004R5SK,"Three Sovereigns for Sarah is arguably the best dramatic account of the infamous Salem Witch Trials. It certainly has an outstanding script that provides the perfect creative material for legendary actress Vanessa Redgrave. Indeed, Redgrave is outstanding as one of three sisters condemned by the mass hysteria-vendetta-land grab that lay at the center of the deadly accusations & fantasies.

The story is told in flashback by Redgrave and details aren't pretty.

It is a story of inhumanity, conformism & greed.

The course of the persecutions paralleled the witch trials in Europe (referred to as The Burning Times by some people.) Most victims were elderly, unmarried women with little or no property; people on the fringe, like the homeless today. In Europe there were both Protestant and Roman Catholic inquisitors. Their primary goal was to use indefensible claims against people in order to impress the need for religious conformity. There were also elements of sexual sadism involved and the unconscious need for individuals & the community as a whole to feel superior at the expense of somebody else: a social pecking order gone homocidal.

However, in the American Colonies there was the added  element of financial & property gain.

Near the end of the film Redgrave's character, Sarah, needs to prove the property angle to a sort of ""Witch Commission"" in order to exonerate her sisters after their death. She does this by showing a map she had drawn of the township that clearly delineated the property lines of the accusers and their victims. By this time the imperial authorities intervened because 100's of people were being targeted by the ""possessed"" girls who were clearly out of control. It had mushroomed beyond the Salem township and threatened the highest social circles. In fact, the final incident that put a definitive stop to the madness was when the wife of the Governor was added to the ever longer Witch List.

Playwright Arthur Miller similarly utilized this theme of financial gain in his play ""The Crucible."" In his play Miller was deliberatly drawing parallels between the McCarthy Era, and that prosecutor's demand that one victim name another if they were going to have any chance of personally get off the hook.

A more recent suggestion by a researcher played down the financial aspect, replacing it with a psychedelic interpretation. According to this theory the bread in the township had turned moldy, producing ergot, the organic & potentially lethal ingredient of LSD. Children were more adversely affected than adults--and this is why the ""afflicted"" victims, with one exception, were children. However, this theory fails to explain why ALL the victims were female. There should have been boy hysterics too--or at the very lest very energetic boys bouncing off highly colorful & melting walls.

Although veteran actress Kim Hunter (from Streetcar Named Desire to Planet of The Apes) is particularly effective as the elder & pious sister of Vanessa, the rest of the cast, although quite good, don't quite shine or match Redgrave's performance. It's an awesome act to follow.

So I debited 1 star from the overall production rating.

Incidentally, after seeing this film it can only be hoped that people playing at being witches (including those making money in today's Salem at the original victim's expense) will have a flash of clarity & find something more socially relevant to do.

There was nothing ""fun"" or ""romantic"" about being condemned as a witch.

1341219,5,B00004R5SK,"I really loved and appreciated this film when I saw it, and was so glad to have the incomparable Vanessa Redgrave playing my Great (x10) Aunt, Sarah Bridges-Cloyce, whose maiden name was Towne and who was sister to Rebecca Towne Nourse (of ""The Crucible"" fame) who was actually born in England (as were all but two of Joanna Blessing Towne's children), before the family's voyage, and to Mary Towne Eastey, whose letter to the Court is available to be read in Salem (I have a copy, and it is heart-wrenching in its quiet assertion of innocence and in Mary's faith in her God). These three sisters, two of whom were hanged, were amongst the first of the Towne women to grow up in the New World. All three of them fought back in their own ways, and after the deaths of Rebecca and Mary, both elderly and pillars of the community, the Towne family broke Sarah out of her prison cell (which was merely an old back shed in someone's yard--by this time the jail was full and the accused were being housed by all sorts of greedy people who were paid to house them); they took her back to her childhood home in Topsfield, which was out of the jurisdiction of Salem Village. (This bit of the story is only known in our family--it is not documented, as far as I know, even in the Village Museum. In this film, she's rescued only after the trials have ended, when in fact she was snuck out before-hand; now you know this bit of family history, too.)

As has been mentioned by another reviewer, ""The Crucible,"" for all its brilliance, is not terribly accurte (Abigail was only 11 and there was no sexual relationship between her and any of the men in the village). Miller used sexual freedom vs. repression to represent the stultifying atmosphere of the entire colony.  ""Three Sovereigns"" is the only accurate play/film to show how some of the people, particularly the women, did not all just accept their fates in stoical silence. I believe, however, that only Sarah fought for restitution in her lifetime; three sisters, one sovereign for each, three weeks after her appearance before the magistrates, she died. Lots of threes... Her descendents went on to found Oxford, Framingham, and other towns in Massachusetts: the last of our particular family branch with the surname Towne was my great-uncle Charles Towne, who was Editor-in-Chief of the Hartford Courant (one of New England's first newspapers) for decades. Unlike the Quakers out of Philadelphia, Puritans in New England, like our family, were not moneyed, merely dedicated, and I am proud to be a Towne woman, doing my best to follow the tradition of strength Sarah and her sisters began (ironically, on the other side of my family I represent one of the Natives the Townes and other settlers unsettled and eventually waged war on--I guess that makes my sister and me rather too extremely ""American""!)

I have always wanted to contact Ms. Redgrave to tell her how much I appreciated her portrayal of this brave woman. Sarah's outrage and lawsuit used to be just proud family history, so it was a great joy to see her strength so well-written and acted.

I gratefully and whole-heartedly recommend this film, particularly for people who can show it in a classroom or otherwise use it to teach kids.

1341220,5,B00004R5SK,"As a decendant of a victim of the witchcraft hysteria and student of the period, I find this to be one of the best portrayals of what went on during 1692.  We only really know bits and pieces of the details, but what is known is used as the basis for the story. The PBS presentation was shot totally on location in Salem and neighboring Danvers (the Salem Village where it all began).  Vanessa Redgrave is supurb as is Kim Hunter.  Some of the dialogue might seem a bit stilted, but I can excuse this because so many local actors were employed that only have been in theater groupsin and around the area.

The production values are very high, and the photography excellent for a television production.  There is an occasional creepiness that exists through the photograpic images, note the very beginning and the clay pipe falling from the scaffold during the first execution.
