2783877,5,B000NVI29C,Nothing to add that hasn't already been said -- this is some of the best British TV of the decade and it's bizarre that I can't buy it on DVD here in the US.  Someone needs to fix that. Boxed set of Seasons 1-3 and both specials should do it.,1269561600,6,242,3.84
2783878,5,B000NVI29C,"It is fabulous but definitely not that funny. We must not imagine but realize we are governed by this kind of social climbers, this kind of social egotistic selfish egocentric psychopaths who only try to capture some power, not really for the power of it, or at the most the power it provides them with over their direct employees, their direct associates, their friends who are friends as long as they are useful. These people have no vision whatsoever. They can advocate a solution today and exactly the reverse on the following day. They can be gross and pretend they are dainty, or just plain liars and let you know they are suffering so much because they told a lie because they could not avoid telling such a lie because otherwise their wives, husbands, spouses, boy or girl friends, plain friends, children pets or even gold fish, or whatever, would have suffered in a way or another if they had not changed positions and convictions during the night and over the week end. Then you end up wondering why they are in their position of power, who in hell elected them, and you suddenly realize you elected them by not voting at all or by wasting your vote on a marginal side-kick candidate. After seeing such a perilous voyage in the stormy waters of political intrigue and the schizophrenic superman complex, you can only finally decide to vote for the good side next time. But is there a good side? Can we vote for Head without seeing that Head entails Tail, or vice versa? The only thing that changes in these people are not the teeth but the dentures. They all bite abundantly with steel or gold but always with gusto since for them the public is a piece of meat and the media are the pepper and the salt of the barbecued beef.

2783879,5,B000NVI29C,"Rich with wonderful characters, from the inept to the insane to the evil, 'The Thick of It' is so much more than a grown-up 'Yes, Minister', but that'll do for a brief description.  If you want truly adult comedy - intelligent, truthful and bloody funny - check this out.  You don't even have to be THAT knowledgeable about British politics.

The visceral script has the ring of truth about it, an impression aided by the damped-down, utterly believable acting, and Malcolm Tucker, played by the stunning Peter Capaldi (ED. THE NEW DOCTOR WHO!  CANNOT WAIT) , has to be up there with the great monsters of comic creation.  How can you not love a character who, when accused of being a bully by a cowering colleague, snarls, 'How dare you call me a bully?  I am so much worse than that.'  Fantastic stuff.",1223251200,19,804,4.580419580419581
2783880,5,B000NVI29C,"Absolutely brilliant!

I came across Thick of It because I was amazed by Yes, Minister series, and wanted something that has the same wittiness and weight to it. I was impressed from the very first episode of the series with it's brilliant satire on modern and political life. Some of the episodes especially the second one are crushingly addictive with its situation comedy and wordplay.

Truly a gem.  A rare comedy where profanity actually embellishes the texture of the plot.  A witty, profoundly entertaining and immensely satirical political comedy. The series contains some of the finest collection of oaths that ever I listened to. The two specials are a masterpiece of comedy.  I've actually watched all the episodes online, including the specials.

British Television from time to time does produce some very delightful and original series that I must say are a mile ahead of others. Series like Seinfeld, Cheers, MASH look utterly foolish and childish in their insistence on portraying cynical and meaningless characters.  It is an absolute tragedy that these witty, funny and entertaining series have only 6-8 episodes, while the above mentioned crap have volumes and volumes dedicated to them. An absolute tragedy!!!",1202169600,13,1229,5.239795918367347

We couldn't watch more than the first episode:  this is fly-on-the-wall drama pretending to be a (badly made) documentary in its style.
The camerawork seems to have been done by a drunken amateur - I know that's fashionable these days, but it's so annoying, and gets in the way of the acting.
There appears to be no script, either the actors are really extemporising or they are very good at making the script seem stilted and 'natural'.  Sorry, it doesn't work.

Then the guy got the main role for Doctor Who, then I found this.

Enjoyable, intense ""flavor"", sort of like black pepper, love the flavor of it, but a little goes a long way and I wouldn't put it on everything.  Also has a tendency to become one noted after awhile, relying heavily on the profanity and attitude of the main character to drive things forwards, definitely works and in small doses is fun, but I fast forwarded through season one in one night and that was a bit much.

Get the series, keep it in your back pocket.  Have a bad day at the office dealing with politics and jerks?  Come home, throw on an episode and vicariously release a bit of tension.",1381190400,,860,4.3375

Peter Capaldi is beyond brilliant as Malcolm Tucker, the manic, foul-mouthed, perpetually furious government spin doctor for 10 Downing Street. This is vicious, scathing political satire delivered with that insane yet deadpan humor that the British do so well. I wish Hollywood could deliver something this raw & irreverent about U.S. politics, but it can't.  Thankfully, we Americans can enjoy the British exports.  WARNING: this series is filled, start to finish, with foul, hilariously obscene profanity. Malcolm takes the art of filthy invective to dizzying heights never before reached on television. That is a major component of the humor. If you don't enjoy that sort of thing, don't watch this series. You have been warned.

2784003,5,B000NVI29C,"This is an extremely fast-paced, brilliantly written, hilarious political comedy that looks at the inner workings of the fake Department of Social Affairs and Citizenship, and in general satirizes modern government.

This is the show behind the supremely funny movie In The Loop.  Many of the same characters are present, including Malcolm, the main character (played fantastically well by Peter Capaldi).  In the series, Malcolm is just as foul mouthed and fast talking as in the movie, and he always means business.  You'll be laughing and find yourself repeating his brilliant lines for days.....  Malcolm, the enforcer, appears to very much be the man behind the throne in all of his interactions with completely inept politicians and the other do-nothings who work in the DoSAC offices.  A hilarious (and realistic?) peek inside government offices and ministries, I recommend The Thick of It to anyone with a good knowledge of politics and an excellent sense of humor.

I will warn you, the accents may be difficult, though after the first five minutes, you'll start to understand better.

2784006,5,B000NVI29C,"This has all the British deftness with understated humor coupled with a rightness about it that really made me think. The aspect which stands out for me is how much of their time is spent as politicians and their aides on how they will be perceived by the media and the public.  I would estimate over ninety percent of their time.  The time spent on actual legislation is less than ten percent.  I suspect way less. When I think about it though, doesn't a democracy virtually guarantee this? That most of one's time will be spent keeping the majority of people who vote content, if not happy?

I never quite figure out what this Minister for Social Affairs does and he seems equally at sea as to his purpose.  He does have to answer to Malcolm, the PM's communications honcho.  He is brilliant.  His entire job is putting out brush fires with ministers and there seems to be a continual onslaught of those.

This is also shot as if it is a semi documentary and not a sit com.  This makes it all the more effective. Give it a try.

In the Loop was deffinitely the funniest, wildest, and yet most believable political comedy that I've ever seen (and one of the funniest comedies I've ever seen - political or not), so when I found out that it was based on the TV series called The Thick of it, I had to check it out.
Those who, like me, started with In the Loop, should be aware that most of the characters from The Thick of It are different from In the Loop with only Malcom Tucker, Jamie, and the bald ambassador having roles in both. The Thick of It focuses on a minister and his aids in some small branch of British government. They make mistakes and end up trying to keep them off of the front page or 6 o'clock news while getting screamed at by Malcom Tucker for everything they do. The plots are clever and the characters are all very credible, but the dialogue is flat out funny - although I should warn that it is also very dirty, but the Brits don't come across as being as vulgar...

8181657,5,B000NVI29C,"This is one of the funniest shows I have ever seen in my life.  I have to watch it with captions due to the accents plus the fast talking.  I can watch these over and over again, and still hurt from laughing afterwards.",1473552000,2,219,4.069767441860465
8181658,2,B000NVI29C,"I'm sure that with this cast, the series is funny. However, SHAKY CAM ruins the entire show. Shaky cam was ""hip"" in the 90s. Stop it. NOW. We want to watch shows without becoming seasick.
Sorry. Had to turn it off.",1473379200,,214,4.2439024390243905
