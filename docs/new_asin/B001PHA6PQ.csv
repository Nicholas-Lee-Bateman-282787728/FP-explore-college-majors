3747244,5,B001PHA6PQ,"I purchased this after my boys (4 & 5) fell in love with the book.  It has several different stories and the option of having the ""read along"" captions at the bottom of the screen.  Both my boys watched this DVD from beginning to end. They told me they really liked all the stories and now like to watch the DVD while going through the physical books.  They ask to watch it at least once a week and enjoy it every time.",1338422400,,419,4.085365853658536
3747245,5,B001PHA6PQ,"I have a home daycare and bought this DVD in the box set with other Storybook Treasures DVDs.  This is by far one of the kids favorites.  I have often found that many of these products from the 70's are a bit hard to watch, but the ones on the DVD are all really good.  Highly recommend! I have had kids ages  2-7 who have all enjoyed watching it.",1337904000,,347,3.9855072463768115
3747246,5,B001PHA6PQ,"We originally rented this dvd from the library and my 4 yr. old liked it so much, that when it was time to return it, we decided to buy one. The entire process was quick and easy and the quality was great. Very happy with the whole experience.",1334793600,,243,4.083333333333333

3747248,5,B001PHA6PQ,"My nephew and I read this book first at the library.  This year for Christmas he wanted Stinky the talking garbage truck, and I got this book to go along with it (they are not related items or brands).  He loves this book.  You can read it and it allows for lots of noise making and fun!  Small words are great for beginner readers, and it's a nice book for show-and-tell too.",1325721600,,376,4.180555555555555
3747249,5,B001PHA6PQ,"My 2 1/2 year old son LOVES this DVD!  We have the books for ""I Stink"" and ""Trashy Town"" also.  The story is easy for toddlers to memorize and say together (""I've got... LIGHTS. Ten wide....TIRES"").  ""I Stink"" also has ""alphabet soup"" that the garbage truck eats (A- apple cores, b- banana peels...) which help us recount the story and practice our ABC's.  ""Trashy Town"" has a great beat to it and is also easy for toddlers to participate and remember with frequent repetition.  My son loves those 2 so much we rarely watch the other shows in the collection.  A great buy for anyone interested in trucks or trash!!!",1269734400,5,615,4.545454545454546

It fun, cute, and educational--what a combo.",1380844800,,114,4.476190476190476
3747253,5,B001PHA6PQ,"My 4 year old son really loves this DVD.  He enjoys all of the stories, but I think Runaway Tricycle is his favorite.  He has other DVDs, but still likes to revisit this one frequently.",1374883200,,185,4.257142857142857
3747254,4,B001PHA6PQ,"I found this at the wholesale club the other day for 5 bucks, and since we still had plenty of shopping to do I used it as a bribe to get my two year old to be good while I finished!  He absolutely loves the McMillan book, ""I Stink"" and he was so excited to bring this home. The feature story is(I think) the shortest one of the DVD, and so the bulk of the viewing is the other stories. We have watched it several times, with and without his 7 year old brother.  Here is what we thought...
-""I Stink""- The title story is by far the favorite of my two year old.  We read the book often, but watching it has reinforced his love for it, and I find him quoting it randomly throughout the day.  My 7 year old and I shared the same opinion that the voice was not what we had imagined and was not quite right.  Maybe a little too low and gruff, and not enthusiastic enough.  But of course we have shared this story together for a solid 5 years already, and so have perhaps greater expectations.  We all thoroughly enjoyed it though, and the little guy would be happy if I would just continually repeat it without ever watching anything else.
-""Mike Mulligan"" I have not read this to my two year old yet because it is too for him, and despite his love of all machines, he looses interest in this one about half way through.  The 7 year old watched this fondly and commented about how this is one of his favorite books, prompting me to pull it out to read again. This telling only shows the illustrations from the book as stills and is narrated over it, and does not have moving animation.
-""Trashy Town""- I think this is my favorite!  We don't have the book, but I think I will get it because I can tell that the great rhythm of this story will make it a fun read aloud book.  It is infectious.  This one is animated.
-""The Remarkable Runaway Riderless Tricycle"" A surprise hit!  This live action short is totally dated(my guess is late 70's), but the 7 year old thought it was hysterical!  He burst into laughter when the little trike took off, and thought it was strange and funny when the police pursued him(like they had nothing better to do!) He showed real concern for the trike and the little boy who owned it and was delighted and relieved when they were reunited.  Who knew?  His enthusiasm peeked the interest of the 2 year old, who did not really seem too interested before watching it with his big bro. The musical accompaniment to this is really catchy and effective at helping to ""tell"" this story which has no words.
-""The Beast of Monsieur Racine""- To be honest, we rarely make it to this point in the DVD, and I think that this and the last, ""Arnie the Doughnut"" do not really go well with the other stories that involve ""things that move.""  These both involve food, and we do not have either of these books, so maybe if you do you will appreciate these ""bonus stories.""  Both are animated and are bright and cute, but just don't hold the attention of the kids.
Overall this DVD is enjoyable and I would recommend that you check it out if you like any of these stories.  I would not pay more than the 5 dollars that I did for it, and think that this would be better to borrow from the library(if you can find it) as it may not be necessary to own it, especially if you are only familiar with, or like the featured book ""I Stink.""  We have many scholastic books that we love and I will probably look to borrow more of these DVD's featuring other classics from the library as well.",1363046400,,3488,4.257575757575758
3747255,4,B001PHA6PQ,"I bought this for my 3yo son who LOVES garbage trucks, but I was happy that the collection included some gender-neutral selections that my 5yo daughter also enjoys.  There are a couple of slow-moving stories in the middle that we tend to skip over: Mike Mulligan's Steam Shovel and one about a runaway tricycle, but Trashy Town and I Stink are enduring favorites, and so is Arnie the Doughnut. It was a good purchase :)",1361491200,,419,4.586666666666667
3747256,5,B001PHA6PQ,"Well told, artfully done stories, some familiar, some new to me. Can play with words on screen for beginning readers. A classic.",1356480000,,128,4.863636363636363
3747257,4,B001PHA6PQ,"My five-year-old loved the original book by Kate and Jim McMullan, so when I saw a video adaptation at our local library, I grabbed for it immediately.
The video was a very respectful adaptation of Jim McMullan's original illustrations, with the garbage truck speaking in a perfect gravelly voice provided by Andy Richter.  The little guy loved that, too.
And then we moved on to the rest of the disk, and other delights which included a special favorite from my own childhood, ""Mike Mulligan and his Steam Shovel"".
Tonight, the little guy asked if he could watch ""the garbage truck video"" again, and I had to admit that we had borrowed it from the library, and would have to see if we could check it out again.
But clearly this is a sign that we need to buy our own copy right quick.",1353542400,2,784,4.4825174825174825

He also likes Mike Mulligan and the tricycle video. He doesn't watch the other videos. In my mind, the highlight of this collection is I Stink, which is very well done. My son's love of the video has led to some embarrassing moments, however, when he cried out ""I stink"" in the supermarket or mall.

8333295,5,B001PHA6PQ,"Though I do not look down upon any profession, I did sort of cringe when my son said that he wants to be a dump truck driver when he gets big.  I suppose I can support it as long as he receives an exceptional education first ... for now, I think it's just cute.  He loves the ""I Stink"" (Andy Richter) and ""I'm Dirty"" (Steve Buscheme) books and movies.  The narrators are popular actors and they do a wonderful job.  The other stories included on the DVD are not as amazing, but it's a good bit of entertainment for a 4 yr old and if he enjoys it I am ok with that.  Also, the movies are fairly short, so the entire DVD is only about 40 minutes or so long.",1393632000,,655,3.969465648854962
8333296,5,B001PHA6PQ,He loves the garbage truck.  He is 2 and will watch I stink over and over.  He does not care for any of the others stories on the cd just I Stink.,1392508800,,146,3.53125
