7993487,5,B00009VTXA,"OMG!  The scary thing is that this could happen to anyone! Okay, almost anyone. Only a nice person, a helpful person, a considerate person could easily fall into this/his trap. You GOTTA see it!!!!  I'm trying not to say too much.....  My favorite movie! And......educational? Background checks don't weed out all the bad guys.",1360195200,,327,5.018518518518518
7993488,3,B00009VTXA,"I would say this is a movie without morals.  It seemed strange to me that Ann, when she had multiple chances to go to the police, instead chose to submit to her boyfriend's increasingly dangerous threats.  So, each incident put her in more and more danger.  Wouldn't any normal, moral person, when they are out alone with a little girl they'd learned had been kidnapped, go to the police both to get the girl back home and for their own protection?  There is a good bit of suspense, but without any reasonable resolution.  I thought the ending was totally unconscionable, making the movie hardly worth wasting time watching it.",1156377600,,627,4.715596330275229
7993489,5,B00009VTXA,"This film shows style.  The choice of camera placement, lighting and the blocking is excellent.  If the director had been able to work with better actors, this film would have won the Sundance Film Festival.  The one  non-actor, Roger Clinton (Bill Clinton's brother!) was inspired to give his  best performance.  Maybe he understood that he was working with someone who  will undoubtedly become the next Spielberg.",951609600,5,415,5.196969696969697
