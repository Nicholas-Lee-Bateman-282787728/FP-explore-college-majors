773044,5,6304075413,"An interesting timeline of events that transpired during the time of the Tonight Show Johnny Carson departure and the scrambling for the position that ensued afterwards.  It is certainly a depiction of the ugliness of television power brokers that is seldom told.  If you're a fan of latenight talk, and want a better appreciation of how the hosts got there, this is an entertaining watch.",1140652800,,389,4.969230769230769
773045,5,6304075413,"This is a great HBO telefilm based on the late night talk show wars of the early 90s. The actors portraying Leno and Letterman give dead-on impersonations as their respective hosts. In particular, the Leno was able to capture the essence of unfunny smarminess that is Leno's personality. While these guys were great, the real star is Kathy Bates as the foul-mouthed control freak, Helen Kushnik! What a tour-de-force! She is at her nastiness while behind the wheel of her Mercedes shouting insults and cutdowns galore at uptight studio heads. Unfortunately the real Helen is no longer with us, so be sure to pay tribute to her memory by purchasing this now!",1111017600,,657,4.875
773046,5,6304075413,"I can't tell you how long I have waited for this DVD. A very true story of the dark side of late night comedy, specifically focusing on the year Johnny Carson gave up his chair on The Tonight Show.",1110585600,2,197,4.076923076923077
773047,4,6304075413,"This is a terrific video with Kathy Bates absolutely hateful as Leno's manager.  The actors portraying Leno and Letterman are good but try too hard to mimic rather than portray each.
The video is great at showing the behind the scenes maneuvering that allowed Leno to steal The Tonight Show from David Letterman.  That may be harsh but I don't think there is any other way to describe what happened.  The rightful heir to Carson was Letterman.  Leno was (and still is) a poor pretender to the throne.
That being said, the intrigue and lies used to move the transfer of the Tonight Show to Leno is great.  CBS's decision to enter the late night market and lure Letterman is played out realistically.  It's interesting to note that if Letterman got the Tonight Show, CBS was ready to go after Leno.
The video is a good companion to the book.  The book provides much more detail and inside information but the video hits the highlights.  If interested, you may want to read the book before viewing the video.
Look forward to seeing this on DVD hopefully with some extras.",1036281600,34,1068,4.613756613756614

773049,5,6304075413,"This is a fascinating movie.  It attempts to accurately depict the battle over the coveted position which was opening up after Johnny Carson announced his retirement from the Tonight Show.  The actors all give good  performances, but the true standout is Kathy Bates.  She is absolutely one  of the best actresses fo her generation, and gives a brilliant performance  as Jay Leno's wild manager Helen Kushnick.  She transforms this movie from  a really good one to a great one.  HBO has done it again with The Late  Shift.",955152000,15,522,4.829545454545454

773318,3,6304075413,A film with very annoying corporate types that care too much about late night television.  Maybe in the 90's it actually mattered?  Amazing how the transition after Leno and Letterman barely made a blip as late night is now just basically a parade of celebrities hawking the latest film/tv show and rarely a book.  Under Carson it actually had content and the show was watched by far more people.  Anyways could not finish watching it.  Leno's agent had a screw loose and I don't feel like being irritated by a terrible woman.,1466553600,,526,4.673913043478261
773319,3,6304075413,"Blast from the past! This is a look back to the first ""Tonight Show"" battle in the early 90s. Though produced through HBO, the production value is clearly indicative of its time, 1995. The actors/impersonators used to portray David Letterman and Jay Leno are quite good, though the makeup, at times, appears cartoony; what else could be expected from anything but the real people. While it's true this was more relevant shortly after it happened, rather than 20 years later and additional ""Tonight Show"" debauchery, at this time it's all quite dated. I wouldn't recommend this for historical overview, but more for a pinch of nostalgic 90s era flashback from before TV as we know it today existed, before Internet available free play and streaming (let alone on the device in your pocket), and when, ""do you have cable?"" Was a legitimate question.",1466467200,2,847,4.93006993006993

773323,4,6304075413,The movie was interesting. I remember the transition when Jay Leno took over the Tonight Show from Johnny Carson and I knew it wasn't an easy one. But I didn't realize that there was so much going on behind the scenes.,1466208000,,218,4.341463414634147

773326,4,6304075413,"I saw this when it first aired back in the '90s and watched it when it popped up on Amazon Prime. Aside from somewhat dated production values, I was otherwise impressed by how well it held up. The always good John Michael Higgins pulls off Letterman fairly well, Daniel Roebuck just a little less so as Leno. Watching it again, neither Letterman nor Leno don't come off as badly as they did as I initially thought -- they were just two ambitious guys who wanted the same thing. Mix in massive egos and reputations, and with hundreds of millions of dollars at stake, they were both caught and entwined in the politics of Hollywood, particularly as NBC tried to have its cake and eat it too by giving Leno the Tonight Show but still trying to keep Letterman happy too. In retrospect, NBC made the right call for itself -- as did Letterman for himself -- but I'm sure it didn't feel like that in the moment.",1465948800,,904,4.419161676646707

It's worth while to know who all the players were but the personalities and stars are not represented anything like the real people involved in the events leading to the Tonight Show with Jay Leno.

The representation of Jay, David and many other key players made them out to be pawns and whiny babies which is an insult and far from the truth. Many scenes were pure fiction to make the story more exciting. Even the idea that Hugh Grants appearance somehow made the ratings flip-flp was embelished to take advantage of a minor sex event.",1416614400,,685,4.472

774052,3,6304075413,"It's fine. A fairly interesting tv movie about the early 90's late night wars. Both Letterman and Leno come out as fine normal people, nobody in this movie is really the bad guy...except for Leno's manager played by Kathy Bates. She comes across as a bitch on ice, and Leno is just her weak toady. However, I do feel that in real life Leno is a bit more conniving. Anyway, by far Leno's manager is the most interesting character and Bates just delivers a great performance. Other than that I really don't have anything positive or negative to say about the movie, it's just straight down the middle OK. However, if you want to watch a funny, yet fictional, behind the scenes show I recommend 'The Larry Sanders Show' instead.",1404518400,,725,4.584615384615384
774053,5,6304075413,"Kathy Bates steals the movie as Jay's ruthless agent.  It is a fine film, but it is difficult to feel sympathy for Letterman who wallows in pain because he can't realize his dream to host the Tonight show - boo hop.  So he has to settle for 12,000,000 a year on CBS.  His self-pity is loathsome and this film captures it very well.  Leno comes off as a simp.

The guy who played Jay Leno was TERRIBLE. One of the actors from SNL could have portrayed him better. The actor that played Letterman was not as horrible, but definitely was not Oscar caliber. Rich Little as Johnny Carson had the best performance of the film, too bad he's only in it for 3 minutes. Kathy Bates was alright, but not great. The direction was sloppy and some scenes went on too long with no point. I understand this is a cable made-for-TV movie and you should not expect perfection, but they could have done a lot better with this.

Many times books made into movies drop a lot of information during the transfer from the page to the screen, but this movie left out a good half of the book. Not only that, but the half they depicted was the least interesting half of the book. Emotions and stress levels were incredibly high for all involved in the late night debacle. Legacies were on the line and nobody wanted to be the one to destroy the late night powerhouse at NBC, yet everyone had strong opinions on what direction to take. All of that should have created several explosive performances, instead we end up with a spotty cast portraying their characters like they are reading about them out of...a...book  :)",1348444800,,1394,4.594377510040161

Unfortunately, my parents (in their 80s) were also watching the film with me, and they kept objecting to the bad language.  While I didn't care for the language, myself, I realize that that is how many people talk nowadays, so I tried to overlook it and concentrate on the absorbing story.  So, that could be a minus, for family viewing or people offended by impolite language.
We see these people--the stars--on television and think that we know them, but this film reminds us that their private lives may be rather different from their on-screen personas.

It is, I think, a fair look at the original source of contention between Letterman and Leno. Letterman was Carson's choice to succeed him and probably would have done fine, taking the Tonight Show to a little more edgy place.

But if the scenario portrayed here is to be believed, then NBC obviously doesn't pay heed to the axiom about history repeating itself. Just as in the more current imbroglio involving Conan and Jay, NBC had the exact same situation back then, except Carson actually wanted to retire, whereas Jay had been given five years notice by the NBC suits that his career would be over. In both cases, NBC had a talent they wanted to hold onto and in trying to eat the cake they were trying to have, they ended up botching the whole enchilada.

774336,5,6304075413,"I remember back when this all happened.  The Leno people screwed Johny Carson, and David Letterman.  And Leno was rewarded with a hit late night TV show.

This was a movie made by HBO for HBO. I loved this movie since I first saw it new on HBO. I am sure there were some exaggerations in this movie for entertainment purposes, but the main storyline was on the money.  John Michael Higgins as Dave, and Daniel Roebuck as Jay are good actors, and did their characters justice, right down to Leno's chin, and Letterman's tooth gap.  They even have their habits and movements down pat. But I don't remember Letterman ever having red hair. Kathy Bates is fantastic as Leno's hot headed, back stabbing, foul mouthed bi*ch of a manager. You just want to smack the skin off her face.

The movie fills in a lot of gaps about what happened behind the scenes. I was just glad to see David Letterman move to CBS and get away from the NBC scumbags that screwed him over. The people who play the NBC executives are true to form, and show just how the TV biz really works.

And now Leno has pulled the same BS on Conan O'Brien. I can't understand why people still watch this back stabber.  I can't wait for ""The Late Shift II"" about how Leno once again screwed another good talent out of the ""Tonight Show"".  It's amazing what people will do for ratings and money.  Leno should hang his head in shame. But first he needs a heart and a conscience.

The DVD is good quality widescreen, but the sound is only Dolby Pro-Logic stereo. I guess they didn't have 5.1 at HBO back then.  But the stereo soundtrack is good quality.

It was while she was producing ""The Tonight Show"" that Kushnick's behavior became even more unbalanced as she harrassed backstage personnel and abused network executives and other agents who wanted their acts on the ahow.

774466,4,6304075413,"Alot of twenty-somethings today don't remember the late-night chaos the former king of late night, the late great Johnny Carson, made when he left The Tonight Show after 30 years it's host in mid-1992. There was only two guys even considered for the chair, Jay Leno, a former stand-up comedian who recently took up sub-hosting it when Carson needed a weekly break, and David Letterman, the sarcastic follow-up host who over 10 years held NBC's 12:30 late night anchor. What this film dramatises is all the back-stage fighting between the three parties, including the suits of GE/NBC at the time. So many great things are going on in this film, including Leno's foul-mouthed rude female manager (Kathy Bates in one of her best performances), former teenage character actor (River's Edge Daniel Roebuck as Leno with prosthetic believable chin), and newcomer at the time John Michael Higgins, who is amazing as Letterman, down to a tee of the host's former 44 year old attitude and appearance at the time. Even 70's impressionist Rich Little as Carson (an impersonation he did for years, played realistically this time) is enjoyable to watch. This is one made-for-cable film that truly deserved a theatrical run, no matter what the real life Letterman thought, he hated the film but then again, he never liked himself on screen anyway.

Though made in 1996 for cable, this film is Anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) with a 2.0 Stereo channel (but sorry, bare-boned with no extras), but what really gets to you is how even in the 90's what big decisions were made to forever change television history by so few people involved. If you are a fan of either late-night host currently, or waiting to see Conan take the 11:30 reins (not me), this is one film you cannot miss. One of HBO's best original films ever. Ever.

774467,4,6304075413,"If you are fascinated by what went on behind the scenes in the battle for who will succeed Johnny Carson between up-and-comer David Letterman and seasoned Carson fill-in Jay Leno then you will find this movie very entertaining. This movie orginally aired on HBO in 1996 and by then Leno was beginning his long run as King of Late Night over Letterman.

While John Michael Higgins (as Letterman) and Daniel Roebuck's (as Leno)only somewhat phyically resemble the late night giants, what drives this movie are the supporting roles. Most memorable is Kathy Bates as Leno's fiercely devoted but horribly misguided Agent Helen Kushnick; the fall from her position of power in the Leno camp evokes a feeling of someone getting what's coming to them, but nonetheless sad.  Bob Babalon and Reni Santori are excellent as the exasperated, but ultimately triumphant NBC exces Warren Littlefield and John Agoglia who fret over choosing Leno but are rewarded with big ratings (this was before Littlefield's next cash cow - a guy named Seinfeld). Finally, Steven Gilborn's portrayal of Letterman's confidant and moral center Peter Lassally is superb.  The one role which truly stretches the boundaries of credibility is Rich Little, who briefly portrays Johnny Carson; he sounds like Carson, but physically is really not a match.

The movie is based on the book by Bill Carter of the same name; it is fairly faithful to the book (it includes the must-see scene depicting the now-infamous true story of Leno hiding in a closet eavesdropping over NBC execs who are meeting to discuss his fate)

While this movie doesn't quite reach the height's (or is it lows?) of the funniest and most bitingly vicious depiction of what goes on behind closed doors in Hollywood portrayed in the criminally under-apreciated Larry Sanders Show, it is a excellent way to spend an hour and a half if you are up for a funny, true tale of Hollywood hi-jinks.",1216598400,,1921,4.953416149068323
774468,4,6304075413,"""The Late Shift"" is based on Bill Carter's book, a blow-by-blow account of the back-stabbing battle for NBC's ""The Tonight Show"" that was waged in board rooms and over power lunches on two coasts 1990-1993. CBS approached Jay Leno (Daniel Roebuck) while he was ""The Tonight Show""'s guest host, hoping to lure him to a competing late night talk show. But Leno's agent Helen Kushnick (Kathy Bates) preferred that Leno seek a deal with NBC that would guarantee him the job when Johnny Carson (Rich Little) retired. David Letterman's (John Michael Higgins) ""Late Night"" had been a hit for NBC for a decade, and Letterman expected to succeed Carson himself. With a waffling NBC trying to retain both comedians, CBS courting Letterman with a favorable deal, and Kushnick using any means necessary to hang onto ""The Tonight Show"", this comic drama went on for three years.

""The Late Shift"" peeks behind the curtain at some of network television's big personalities, their ambitions, tactics, and professional dilemmas. It's largely true, as far as I can judge from articles I read about the saga at the time. Leno and Letterman are represented sympathetically. David Letterman comes off as an obsessive neurotic who tends to be glum -but less so than he does on his show. Leno seems like a nave guy who doesn't want anyone to get hurt. Letterman and producer Peter Lassally (Steven Gibson) half-jokingly compare CAA agent Michael Ovitz (Treat Williams) to The Godfather. Helen Kushnick's weapon of choice seems to be extortion. She sued Bill Carter but is now deceased. It's funny to watch NBC's John Agoglia (Reni Santoni) and Warren Littlefield (Bob Baleban) go around in circles over the same issue for years.

7860691,4,6304075413,"Follows very closely to the book of the same name.  Good performances by John Michael Higgins and Daniel Roebuck. Supporting cast is very good, too.",1496707200,,148,4.92
7860692,3,6304075413,"The irony of this movie is the business hasn't changed and power ultimately corrupted both of these guys.  As if it wasn't enough the first time around, Jay later bumped Conan out of the Late Night job too.  Dave wound up apologizing on his own show for having multiple affairs with young interns.",1491696000,,297,4.584905660377358
7860693,2,6304075413,"After ten minutes of watching this dead duck sink under the lily pads ever deeper, I got up for some fresh air. The lines are bad, the impersonations of Letterman and Leno are pretty awful, and the whole purpose of this rewarmed farce is totally lost on me. Skip it. Watch instead an episode of the real thing--if you can't get hold of a noose and a stool.",1485993600,,356,4.25

7860696,3,6304075413,"Unfortunately, the effects and cinematography clearly don't hold up real well. That's the negative. I thought Kathy Bates both phoned it in AND was over the top at the same time. I know that doesn't make sense, but it's true. But, I know Ms. Bates received numerous accolades for this role, so it could just be me. However, I thought the two leads were great. I thought the supporting cast was decent. I had fun with it, and was pretty well invested in it from beginning to end. I would watch again, but I'm not so sure I would pay to watch it again.",1474761600,,550,4.298076923076923
