There are  several great cameos by Dave Velzy, Greg Noll, and Robert August(just to  name a few) who tell the viewer about their experiences with Brown and the  movies they made together.  It unfortunatley is only 70 minutes long.  It  has great out takes from ES and ES 2 and a short blooper series that is  classic.

1106646,4,630597554X,"This film was recommended to me by an independent documentary filmmaker. I approached it hesitantly, not expecting much except one or two new tips. What I experienced was an inspirational and emotional event, a journey into the behind-the-scenes look at true indie filmmaking as it was in the 1960's.  I know most of the film's fans are surfers. I am not. But I enjoyed this film nonetheless. In fact there were moments where I felt like I'd missed out on something great in the 1960's. More importantly, for independent filmmakers who struggle with the same old notions of how to make and distribute a film, this film offers tremendous insight into out-of-the-box self-distribution. I find this film as valuable, if not more so, than the Robert Rodriguez director commentaries and books. Buy it! You'll want to watch and listen over and over again, but not just for the beautiful waves and scenery. You'll want to watch for the brilliant information.",1239580800,,951,4.94375

1106648,5,630597554X,"Having been in the same group of surfers as Bruce, surfing the Ranch at the same times (I was the young kid that asked a million questions and borrowed wax that never got returned) I couldn't wait to see how he had set so many shots up for TES. I had a great talk with Robert August about an article I was going to do on Tahiti for Surfer. Great guy.. The""Revisited"" version was that much more interesting.. Great laughs!!
  Its a keeper for us that can bring back memories from those great uncrowded days..
 It is worth every penny..

1106649,2,630597554X,"Quick review: Dana Brown opens this documentary by describing it as (paraphrased) ""another chance to rip off the public,"" and he's somewhat right.  ""The Endless Summer Revisited"" is mostly a series of interviews of the original filmmakers, promoters, and one of the stars of ""The Endless Summer"" and it doesn't reveal a whole lot that wasn't covered during the Surfer's Journal series on surf movies.  I can't recommend buying this, but it might be worth a rental if you can find a copy.
More details: ""The Endless Summer Revisited"" tells the story of the filming and distribution of the original ""Endless Summer"" as well as a little bit about its sequel.  It runs chronologically, startingwith some early footage of Bruce Brown as a surfer and then progressing forward.  Interviews shot on video are mostly of Bruce Brown, Dana Brown, and Robert August, with appearances by Greg Noll, Steve Pezman,  Dale Velzy, Hobie Alter, Nat Young, Wingnut, Pat O'Connell, and some other old guys whose names I don't recall.
I got a few chuckles from Noll taking digs at Brown whenever he could get a chance, and there was some interesting grainy footage here and there from the original film that I hadn't seen before.  They show a little bit of from-shore shots of the filming of the water camera footage, and Brown tells the real story of how Cape St. Francis was discovered by Mike Hynson.  Hynson, by the way, is not interviewed at all for this film.  The lack of his perspective is  a major gap.  The film winds up with details that I hadn't heard before of how they found a distributor for ""The Endless Summer,"" including taking the film  to Kansas during a snowstorm to prove that it could  be shown to a wider audience.  By the time they get to the sequel, the makers of ""Endless Summer Revisited"" have run out of gas, and don't have much to say other than ""it's the same thing only better.""  There's not much additional footage at all from that film, which is disappointing since they must have a lot of it in the can.
Summary: Don't buy it, rent it if you're interested in surf media history.",1058140800,24,2091,4.646739130434782
1106650,1,630597554X,"Endless Summer Revisited is not worth the time you spend watching it, not to mention your wasted money buying/renting it. Instead, try Endless Summer II: you'll watch it several times and enjoy it each time.",1040428800,11,207,4.942857142857143
1106651,5,630597554X,"I had seen ""The Endless Summer"" (TES) and was fully expecting ""The Endless Summer Revisited"" (TESR) not to live up to it, if only for the fact that it was not a follow up to the original TES or ""The Endless Summer II"" (TES2). This was more of a documentary of how they made TES, TES2 and some other surfing during that timeframe. When it started, I was fully prepared for 2 stars. However, many of the interviews led me to 3 stars. Some of the new surfing footage led me to 4 stars. Then, with footage from TES2 (which is not available on DVD yet), I had to go with 5 stars. It is not the same as TES, so if you expect that, it will be disappointed. But, if you want to know more of the surfer life, then TESR is worth it. I especially liked them pointing out that it is NOT like ""Beach Blanket Bingo"" or other silly movies where they just throw sex into the mix. Sure, hormones are prevalent, especially when young, but that goes out the window when riding waves. I was glad that they pointed that out and that they followed it in the films.",1035244800,27,1042,4.137931034482759

7899157,5,630597554X,"""Endless Summer Revisited"" (2000) Is A ""Must See"" For Admirers of Bruce Brown's ""Endless Summer"" surfing movies
-------------
This is a documentary which explains how the two Bruce Brown (1937 - ) ENDLESS SUMMER  (1964 and 1994) ""surfers surfing around the world"" movies were made.

The ENDLESS SUMMER (1964) movie really captures the spirit of the early 1960's, it's optimism, possibilities, and joy.

The 60's, in my opinion, got grabbed by bad people and exploited, but the ENDLESS SUMMER (1964) movie (and the later one in 1994, too) really communicates the spirit of those days (51 years ago!) at their very best.

Life really could be and should be (and for a few years in the early 1960's was, for some of us in our early 20's) as simple, yet as fulfilling as depicted in the ENDLESS SUMMER (1964) movie.

I can't praise it enough.

It is a statement of ""the ideal life"" and a description of it.

At the time the original ENDLESS SUMMER movie was made (shot in 1963), it was entirely possible to do just what the two protagonist surfer heros of the movie (18 and 21 year old guys) did.....

Spend a year travelling around the world on the cheap, having wonderful, memorable, edifying adventures.

It was the time when books were being published with titles like EUROPE ON FIVE DOLLARS A DAY, and Icelandic Airlines charged $100 for a plane ticket from NYC to Paris.

Greyhound Bus Lines charged $100 for an ""Ameri-Pass"" which allowed unlimited Greyhound Bus travel anywhere in the USA for 3 months.

American Youth Hostels charged $5/night of less, and were clean, OK places to stay almost anywhere.

The ENDLESS SUMMER (1964) movie really captures the promise and possibilities of those times.

For me, it's a statement of my ideal politics and social policies!

That's the kind of life for me.

Bruce Brown's son, Dana Brown, was the director of the movie (he is seen as a 1959 toddler baby in footage shown at the start of the movie).

The movie is made up of wonderful interviews by many of the ""players"" part of Bruce Brown's long career as a movie maker about surfers and surfing.

The question ""How did we do it?"" is answered by Bruce Brown himself, and many other who were surfers in his movies in the 1950's and 1960's and who were part of the team which created the first blockbuster documentary movie hit titled ""The Endless Summer"" (1964) and the follow up ""Endless Summer Part II"" (1994) movie as well as movies Bruce Brown made in the 1950's and early 1960's.

Home movie footage is included in this wonderful documentary which tells the story of how Bruce Brown and his team ""did it,"" making wonderful, unforgetable movies about surfing all over the world.

Anyone interested in documentary and narrative feature movie production and behind the camera problems and challenges should see this movie.

It is so good, I can't find the words to say how good it is.  Get it, enjoy it, re-screen it often along with the other famous Bruce Brown surfing movies.",1425168000,3,2976,4.706563706563706
