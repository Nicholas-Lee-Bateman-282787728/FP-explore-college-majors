8092130,3,B000BT99DO,"You won't often see Buenos Airies portrayed in movies, so this gritty little street drama offers a special look at one of the world's great cities. The plot is minimal: four teenage thugs scratch out a low grade living robbing cab passengers until they decide to go for bigger prey. Nothing much happens and the dialogue subtitles are mostly four letter words and macho posturing. In the end, a couple get shot in a shootout and the movie is over. Doesn't sound like much, but it's very watchable.",1246924800,,497,4.659090909090909
