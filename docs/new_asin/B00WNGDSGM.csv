It's not flawless, looks pretty much just like the DVD version, but at least it's 1080P native and doesn't suffer from blocky artifacts and blurriness from being upscaled like a DVD.  If you're a fan of this movie or series, it's worth grabbing to replace your DVD copy.  Some subtitles are different, but it's mainly the same.  BUY IT",1467417600,2,379,4.449275362318841
8713824,3,B00WNGDSGM,"I am a fan of GOG and also collector since its release on VCD, DVD and Blu ray.

I do not get a full digital remastered quality. Trust me, DVD quality looks better than it is on blu ray.

Won't recommend this.",1441843200,,209,3.9523809523809526
8713825,4,B00WNGDSGM,"There is rarely as slick and smooth a movie as God of Gamblers for the first 30 minutes. Chow Yun Fat plays out a fantasy of the everyman and truly is the God of Gamblers, complete with a 3 piece suit, an 8 figure bank balance and a Rolls Royce to boot. However if you think this is the movie you are about to see, you're in for a big surprise.

The film takes a pretty dramatic (or comedic) turn in tone and pace and starts into a much more light-hearted action comedy. However, in the final half hour or so the movie slowly begins to return to how it began. If you've seen it you know, many love it, I enjoyed it but personally would have much preferred seeing the movie that it started out to be.",1433894400,2,699,4.065217391304348
