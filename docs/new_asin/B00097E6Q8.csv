It shows church leaders who are critical and unwilling to allow the youth group leader to
  help the teens deal with important issues in our society.
The ending is a real disappointment and ruins the story.  It lets the church leaders
  stay critical and unaccepting. God would be against such leaders.
The film isn't worth seeing.",1352937600,,414,4.774647887323944
8057914,5,B00097E6Q8,This film is a diamond in the ruff. A rare find. Buy it and be set on a journey of true Love. He is Judged by the Church for his actions. Where would Christ go and what would Christ do? I hope that many find this tool to be an asset to your youth and teen ministry.,1227744000,4,265,3.6666666666666665
