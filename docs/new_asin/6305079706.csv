Clear presentations of the written (upper and lower case,) spoken and signed alphabet are added benefits to this generally entertaining learning video.  It moves along at a comfortable pace for repeated viewings.  The actors are engaging and this is one of few signing videos my 1-8 year old children watch repeatedly.",1072310400,,426,5.235294117647059
7882765,5,6305079706,"I am teaching my 2 yr old son to sign.  He knew about 30 signs before seeing this video and he is learning most of the signs presented on this video.  He loves to watch it and asks for it everyday - unlike any other video we own.  He is now learning to sign letters and has learned to say the alphabet correctly after viewing this video.  The video presents the letters of the alphabet in written form (upper & lower case) and sign.  Each sign is shown multiple times by both adults and children.  Yes, some of the children do not smile ... do not know why that is, perhaps they are scared of the camera or concentrating, but that has not affected my son's enjoyment of the video.",1013990400,3,680,4.1923076923076925
7882766,1,6305079706,"After buying Sign Songs, I was eager to buy more videos produced by the same company.  So eager, as a matter of fact, that when Amazon informed me they were unable to get Sign and ABC, I logged onto the company's website and ordered it directly from them (ten dollars more expensive than with Amazon).
I can definately see where someone would think this video is creepy or strange.  The main song was meant to sound like a folk song, but didn't quite come off right, and the sound quality is poor.
A few of the children signing don't smile at all, either glaring at the camera or looking very apathetic.  It's not fun to watch at all.",980640000,10,634,4.3559322033898304
7882767,4,6305079706,"In my opinion, This is an excellent tape if you are interested in learning the basics along with your child. The viewer is taught finger spelling,some numbers,as well as some words. great for the family.",964569600,2,203,4.828571428571428
