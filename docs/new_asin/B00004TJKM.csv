7922592,2,B00004TJKM,"A man marries into a family which has a secret; the head has stolen gold from the manchus, and hidden it. Only his fellow four guardsmen know where it is, and one by one they all die, murdered by unknown assassins. Can Chang find out who the killer is?

The original story is ok, if a bit repetitive, with a very annoying womanizing sidekick. The kung fu fights are ok, if a bit too brief. The movie really suffers with the incredibly stupid tacked on ending, which is an excuse for another fight that has zero impact and relies on the true villain being an idiot. If it weren't for that, it'd be a solid three stars, but there are better films here, like Clan of the White Lotus or Phantom Kung Fu",1512950400,,698,4.2481203007518795
