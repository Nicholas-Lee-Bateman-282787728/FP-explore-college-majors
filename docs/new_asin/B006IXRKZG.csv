4992259,4,B006IXRKZG,It is a great workout although I wish that it was broken down into smaller segments so you could choose which segment to do every day. It's very ab intensive and I never do abs for that long.,1394841600,,191,4.052631578947368
4992260,5,B006IXRKZG,"From an old dinner table prayer....
I have loved Gilad for over 20 years.  He's been my go to work out every week.  I loved Total Body Sculpt series and now love the Lord of the Abs series for added definition.  I am a runner so strengthening and core are paramount.  I truly believe that by doing his workouts my speed has improved dramatically.  Also everyone says they notice the definition in my slimmer body.  For a 55 year old woman that is empowering!",1393113600,3,458,4.392857142857143

4992264,4,B006IXRKZG,"For about 10 or 12 year's I've been doing Gilad's Abs Workout (on and off) but felt I wanted a change.  This video incorporates much more full body movement; I feel that I get a cardio workout and some stretching along with an abs workout.  There are about 4 or 5 separate workouts, plus warmup and cool down.  My only complaint is that the segments aren't separated out into separate ""chapters"" on the DVD, they just flow one into the next.  This makes for a smoother workout if you're going to do all of them in a row, but you can't easily jump forward or back with the remote.  Overall a very solid video.",1336003200,12,608,4.298245614035087

8499022,5,B006IXRKZG,"Challenging work out. My abs and obliques are still sore 2 days after using this DVD. Gilad is energetic as always and this workout combines elements of yoga, pilates, and traditional ab exercises. The time passed quickly and I definitely felt my core engage.",1420243200,,259,4.909090909090909

8499024,5,B006IXRKZG,"get ready to get ripped abs! :)
i'm able to do gilad's core and more dvd without a single pause and still found this dvd difficult. it builds intensity gradually but surely and in the second half of the program you end up doing a loooot of exercises while in the plank position and it is hard! believe me.
i like the fact that this program helps me define my abs so well without a heavy impact on my heart as other (younger) instructors claim that the fastest and surest way to ripped abs is high intensity cardio. after trying high intensity cardio and finding that it does more harm than good to my cardiovascular system,it feels so great to finally find a program that definitely gets my core ripped and gets me sweating without being too strenous on my heart.
gilad provides very good cueing as always and gives very good explanations on proper form.
the people in the dvd look genious and don't wear fake smiles that make you even more annoyed with the fact that you're not able to do the entire program from the first time. there are DVDs from other instructors where everyone is smiling when it is quite obvious that they haven't shot the entire program at once, but with pauses. in this DVd from Gilad you can actually see the people in the program sweating and having a bit of difficulty in performing the exercises in the second part perfectly to the very last count.",1408320000,6,1377,4.468253968253968
8499025,5,B006IXRKZG,"Incredibly cheesy name and photo cover; really good, non-patronizing workout. Also works out arms and legs to some degree. Surprisingly good.",1400371200,,141,5.761904761904762
