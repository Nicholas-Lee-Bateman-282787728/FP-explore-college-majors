3886434,5,B002AL2TZQ,"Such a gem! Yumi Lee has created three challenging but doable routines with, for me at least, no dread factor. I look forward to doing the workouts, probably because there are always three level options: beginner, intermediate and advanced. If I'm feeling strong I can follow Lee (intermediate), or sometimes even Basheera who demonstrates the advanced option; or if I'm feeling tired and/or uncoordinated I can follow the beginner modifications. Most times, I switch back and forth between all three.

As has been mentioned, the interval sculpting workout only clocks in at about 16 minutes, which doesn't bother me as I usually try to cram as many workouts as possible into my morning. Lee uses compound moves such as squats with overhead lifts to get the most bang for the buck. Many of her moves are done on one leg and require good balance, but beginners, don't let that scare you as the beginner modification is to keep the toe of the non-working leg on the floor for stability.

The kickbox cardio section is a full 20-minutes (it may even go over a minute or two) and works up a good sweat while having fun. Lee demonstrate the moves slowly at first, which I prefer because the slow sections allow me to catch my breath and concentrate on form. I'm thrilled to have a high-energy 20-minute routine to add to my library.

The metabolism boost clocks in just around 20-minutes (maybe a few seconds under) and, like the interval sculpt, uses compound moves with weights. Lee even throws in a little plyo.

All three workouts are really well conceived and thorough. I have been doing them for about three weeks now and still feel the burn the next day. I will probably have this DVD in such high rotation that I'll eventually get sick of it. Hopefully by that time Yumi Lee will have another workout DVD on the market!

There are a few cons which do not bother me, but may annoy others. The woman showing the beginner modifications appears to be doing the routines for the first time. She gets lost throughout the workouts. (Perhaps she was called to fill in at the last minute?) Although she usually makes a quick recovery it can be a little frustrating if you are trying to follow her. Beginners should probably preview the video before doing the workout as she gets almost all the way through the first set of one-leg squats (moderate and advanced) without realizing she was supposed to keep her back toe on the floor (beginner modification). There is also the occasional bad edit, at one point the camera focuses in on the advanced exerciser when she is on the up motion of a bicep curl but when they cut back to Lee she's on the down motion. It can be a bit disconcerting. But to me these are trivial issues. The routines are just too darn good to be spoiled by these little glitches.

Yumi Lee is that perfect combination of motivational and no-nonsense. I love her attitude and her ability to make you focus in on what you're doing. Message to Ms. Lee: Please put out more workout DVDs!",1273622400,3,2997,4.613508442776736
3886435,5,B002AL2TZQ,"After watching a trailer of the DVD I had to have it.  When it arrived to day,I popped it in the player straight way.  I got a really good cardio workout from the kickboxing & strength training on this dvd. The pace was not too fast or slow and you will sweat.  I loved this DVD! I'm a total fan of anything kickboxing & this has a simple routine that even a complete beginner can follow with out feeling lost.

 Admittedly, the time is off on workout #2, its  shorter than the  20 minutes as desrcibed on the case but its good never the less.  I enjoyed  all three  sessions and I can see myself reaching for this workout on regular basis.  I

Just try it, if you don't like it ,pay it forward to someone else who enjoys a good cardio workout..chances are you will keep it for yourself!!! Go 4 it!",1271030400,,798,4.143790849673203
3886436,4,B002AL2TZQ,"OK - parts of this video are definitely fun - lots of kickboxing (in the cardio portion) which is something I wanted and good attitudes - one of the women is in several of the Jillian Michael's videos & I love her (the high-impact girl).  I like that there are lots of variations of each move (low-impact, standard, hi-impact) and I felt like I wasn't staring at the clock the whole time (a habit of mine) waiting for it to be over because it was fun.  Also, I liked out she did cardio bursts throughout the cardio portion...not a million of them but enough to keep your heart rate raised.

Bad stuff:

She goes really slowly at first through each move in the cardio section...ok that's great for the 1st time or the 2nd but I don't know how I'm get through her slowly guiding me EVERY time I do this dvd...the moves are not that complex as it is!  It would have been a lot smarter to add a separate section on the dvd where she breaks down the moves so the cardio is not so much stop/start.

The toning section...it's only about 15 minutes TOPS...I checked on my dvd player...that's WITH the warmup- I thought it would be 20 minutes as stated...I feel a little jyped there...there's nothing too intense...I didn't really feel that all-around toned after...",1269820800,3,1257,4.467248908296943
3886437,4,B002AL2TZQ,"Let me start by saying that the instructor, Yumi Lee is really great - superb cueing, friendly and motivating. 5 stars for her.
One of the previous reviewers already gave a very detailed description of the workout itself, so I won't be repeating it here - it is
a challenging yet safe ( as far as I can tell ) kickboxing-infused routine. I find that the sculpting section really challenges my core
as Yumi often combines moves, forcing you to fight for your balance.
Why four stars then? As someone already wrote, the cardio routines are not particularly diverse, so you may get bored quickly. The second
problem I have is the flow of the workout, especially its first part. The way new moves are introduced ( broken down in single steps, carried
out in slo-mo ) is great the first time you do it, but as soon as you learned them ( i.e. in my case first time I did it, as they are not
too complicated ) you wish you could skip the intro in order to keep your heart rate up.",1268265600,,973,4.293478260869565
3886438,5,B002AL2TZQ,"I recently got this DVD and it is one of the best work dvds that I have (I own over 60).  I feel that Yumi is not only an great with her cuing, but also the workouts themselves really are effective in giving a complete workout!  I definitely agree with the other reviewer that I wish Yumi would make more workout DVDs (maybe something that would help those of us interested in getting a toned upper body like hers!)",1267920000,,415,4.2405063291139244
3886439,5,B002AL2TZQ,I love Yumi Lee and her instructions in this video. I think she's a great instructor and should make more exercise DVDs.,1265932800,,120,4.5
3886440,5,B002AL2TZQ,"Yumi Lee is probably the best cue-er in the business. Her form tips are right on, she tells you why you are doing each move and what muscles to feel. Her voice is soothing but motivating. I love the emphasis on balance throughout the 3 workouts. I love that she definitely designed this workout so that we would not injure our knees or other joints (unlike Jilliam Michaels 30 day shred which caused me to tear the miniscus in my knees). The only problem I have with it is that the first 2 workouts are slightly repetitive and not as challenging as I had hoped. However, I find when I do all 3 workouts and the ab booseter, I have done a fantastic workout and by my heart rate monitor, I burned 620 calories in an hour and 15 min. I highly recommend this video over the 30 day shred but you need to do more than 1 20 min segment to see results. Even my husband who usually hates female fitness instructors (Denise Austin is waayy to perky for him) loves Yumi because she ""gets down to business"". I woud love to see more videos and more Yumi on TV! She's soo much better than Jillian and Denise who seem to be all over the place.",1262304000,12,1128,4.202764976958525
3886441,4,B002AL2TZQ,"Shape: Get Lean in 4 Weeks is led by Yumi Lee, an excellent instructor who has a motivating voice - and is not at all annoying. Her form pointers are excellent and helpful even for the advanced exerciser. She really helped me focus so that I could get the most out of the workout. The DVD consists of three separate workouts:Fat- Burning Routine (20 minutes), Total Body Interval Sculpting Workout (15 minutes) and Metabolism Boost. I'll explain each workout in detail below. Overall, I like the workouts. Low impact, beginner and advanced options are shown throughout so that you can personalize the workout. Also, you get a FREE 1-year subscription to Shape Magazine with the purchase of the DVD! I think this workout is mostly for intermediate level due to the balance and stamina

The Fat Burning Routine is 20 minutes long and consists of kickboxing moves with cardio bursts of jumping jacks or jogging in place. You start off with a brief warmup of light punches and side steps then learn a sequence consisting of two jabs, a cross punch, one knee strike, front kick, side kick, squat and side kick - then repeat it on the other side.  The sequence is not too complicated to learn, and you learn each individual move and practice it many times before putting the final product together.

Total Body Interval Sculpting Workout is a circuit workout consisting of strength moves with cardio. This workout is supposed to be 20 minutes but my DVD player clocks it at 15. The strength moves use multiple muscle groups at a time and consist of a single-leg deadlift with back row, squats with shoulder press, a plank move with pushups and lunges with biceps curls. Sometimes you perform the upper body move without the lower body move, but it still is quite repetitive. She advises using 3 to 8-lb dumbbells for this section. I used 5 lbs for my first time- and it was not too much of a challenge.

Then there is a 20 minute Metabolism Booster workout designed to test your stamina and agility. You perform moves like squat thrusts, jumping drills, lunges and pulse squats. There are also some upper body strength moves interspersed with the cardio for your biceps, triceps and shoulders.

My main complaint with the workout, and the reason I give it only 4 stars, is that the workouts are simply not varied enough to make it interesting over any period time. You will learn the one kickboxing sequence your first time out and there are really only like four moves in the 2nd workout- so how will you keep from becoming bored? Yes you can increase the weight used and level of impact- but I feel advanced exercisers will quickly find this workout dull.  Also, I don't like that you can't program the DVD to play each session back to back. If you want to do more than one workout, you have to go back to the main menu and select it. Overall, a solid workout but could use a little more complexity.",1261612800,13,2895,4.622568093385214
3886442,5,B002AL2TZQ,"SHAPE GET LEAN is a challenging, efficient workout! It exceeded my expectations by far. The DVD contains three 20 minute workouts, plus a bonus ab toner.

Yumi Lee is an awesome instructor. Prior to this, I was unaware of her. She explains proper form in such a thorough manner - no other instructor has had this type of impact on my form.  Her cues are right on, personality has to be one of the best.  She didn't annoy me at all.

On back, shoulders up, bicycle legs with feet flexed. All I know is I will feel this one in the morning!!!!

I highly recommend this DVD for all levels. Beginners will enjoy each workout, as it offers quite a challenge while being efficient with time. Intermediate/Advanced exercisers - the Metabolism Boost and Bonus Abs make this DVD worth purchasing!! The first two workouts are not as challenging, but great for easier days =) Balance is challenged throughout the different workouts - for me, that is something I struggle with - so the challenge is more than welcome. Well choreograhphed & instructed workout.",1259625600,73,6522,4.188
3886443,5,B002AL2TZQ,"I started working out at home about 10 years ago, so now I have about 50 fitness DVD. I don't generally write reviews of my DVDs, but I felt I had to review this one because it's become by far one of my favourites!

I will not describe the workout in detail (since other reviewers have done this a lot better than I would do). Let me just say that I love this DVD because I am returning to home fitness after a hiatus of a couple of years (and after gaining 20 pounds).

I just needed something to adapt to my needs and to motivate me enough to return to exercise.  Here you have two different levels (beginner and intermediate) so you can choose the one that suits you best (and change level once you get to a more advanced level). I like that some of the exercises in the ""beginner"" level are low impact and without any jumping.

Plus, the trainer is very pleasant, she motivates you without being too chatty or annoying like so many others.

As an overweight, over-40 exerciser, I generally use walking workouts, so this is a nice change. Despite having so many fitness DVD's, I'm so glad I purchased this one, and I really hope to see more workouts by Yumi Lee.",1369094400,,1165,4.301369863013699
3886444,5,B002AL2TZQ,"I was purchasing another Shape DVD and had to jump on and give this one a review bc/ it is seriously my favorite DVD ever.  It is EASY, EFFECTIVE, and who doesn't have 20 minutes?

This coupled w/ Running+Abs most days gets me in shape every summer.  This DVD is literally priceless for me.  My arms and abs are probably my least problematic features - and this is a great boost to get them super-toned.  I use 8lb weights, and only really do the Sculpt track (though the others are cool - I just wouldn't call myself a ""DVD workout-er"" so they're not my cup). Also - I just prefer to use this for my weights training.

If I'm not IN the gym - I'm lazy and the thought of a 30 min or even hour DVD sounds like torture.  I've had this DVD for about 2yrs - and I use it on rainy days - or days I don't want to go to the gym or lace up my running shoes.  It's enough to make me sore in the legs for the first few times I watch it, then it just feels like I got a decent workout after.

I've done a TON of DVDs growing up, and they're always super annoying and boring and monotonous.  I actually (after a year) always mute sweet&gorgeous Yumi (no offense Yumi - I just already know all of your moves & words) - throw my phone on some hi energy workout playlist - have something in the oven or on the stove on low while I do this video for 20 mins - and Boom: easiest workout ever, you did something effective that day, it took less time than a sitcom, and dinner is done when it's over.  I'm telling you - this DVD is my jam.

Yeah so it cuts from the group during some reps and doesn't give a ton of ""form instruction"".  But it's a curl.  You can't do a curl, bad reviewer person?  Maybe try a youtube video and just watch for the changes or count... not that hard!

Highly reco :)

3886445,5,B002AL2TZQ,"I like these three short but challenging workouts.  While they are only 20 minutes long they can be challenging, especially if you are following the hardest level person.  Good balance is necessary on some of the moves!",1366761600,,219,4.891891891891892
3886446,3,B002AL2TZQ,"This workout was just average. There are a lot better workouts out there. I did work up a sweat in 20 minutes, though, which is why I gave it 3 stars. I'm not big on kickboxing which is what the Cardio workout was. The ab routine was disappointing, too, in that it was hard to do and watch at the same time when you were on your stomach. Correct form is everything!",1365984000,,365,4.083333333333333
3886447,5,B002AL2TZQ,Very impressed with Yumi Lee. I've never done the whole dvd but I am this week. I've always just done the cardio portion. So far so good. Great job!,1360022400,,148,4.137931034482759
3886448,3,B002AL2TZQ,"I have to agree with the other reviewer who had some gripes regarding Yumi and her backup not being in synch.  Maureen, the beginner modifier, especially, was obviously not sure what she was doing at any given time, and Yumi had to remind Basheera of her advanced modifications too.  The whole thing had the feel of not having been practiced enough.  It was like they had one or two practice runs, but not enough to work out all kinks out of the routine, especially for the modifiers.  Thankfully, I was ok just following Yumi, who did the intermediate level routine.

Otherwise, however, I really liked the exercise routines.

1)The fat burning kick-boxing routine was not too strenous compared to, say, some of Billy Blank's dvd, but with much better reminders about form and intent.  I really really liked Yumi here - her no-nonsence style was great.
2)The strength training segment was not too challenging, but did get my heart rate up, because of the high reps.  Very good for those mornings after a rought night with the baby.  Do not be fooled, however - the workout, if not too strenuous while performing it, can definitely be felt the next day, and I'm not a beginner.
3)The interval routine was great.  It was challenging enough to get me sweating and red-faced, but not so challenging to create the dread factor (think Jillian Michael's Ripped in 30, especially weeks 3 and 4 - urgh).

Overall, great exercise routine with a wonderful instructor, but a bit more effort could have been dedicated to the actual shooting.",1354060800,2,1529,4.775665399239544
3886449,5,B002AL2TZQ,This was a great deal and a pretty good video to boot. I will definitely add this one to my rotation of workout videos. I had never done a Yumi Lee video before-she is a little fast with the cueing but overall it was a fairly good workout. Not super hard but I ended up with a pretty good sweat and I would say I am an advanced level exerciser.,1350259200,,344,3.9285714285714284
3886450,5,B002AL2TZQ,"I'm not in the best shape of my life, so I would think for those of you that can run a 5k and do a 50 minute Jillian Michaels DVD back to back this is probably not the DVD for you.  I can tell you off the bat that it is not as difficult as Jillian's 30 Day Shred DVD, but in the 20 minute Fat Burning Routine according to my heart rate monitor I burned 193 calories.  The first 5 minutes I was worried, because for a 20 minute workout I'm used to getting right into it and having trouble breathing off the bat.  She makes up for it quickly by combining kickboxing cardio moves that will make your legs weak and breathing heavier.  For the days that I just don't feel like jumping on the treadmill for an hour, and when I know I'm going to kick my TV and shatter the screen imagining it's Jillian's face, this will be a great DVD to pop in.",1339632000,,839,3.9761904761904763
3886451,5,B002AL2TZQ,"Now, I will say that this was the first exercise dvd I have owned. This dvd got me addicted to exercise dvds though. It's really fun to follow along with Yumi and seeing the 3 of them smiling the whole time really just gives you the motivation to keep going.

The fact that there's 3 levels of intensity is also really nice.  That way if you feel you can barely handle one move then you can do the level 1 modification of it or you can push yourself to level 2 or 3.

I thought this dvd was a good balance of cardio,cooldowns and strength training. The fatburning section will definitly make you work up a sweat in the end (just like it's supposed to). Not to mention the kickboxing of the fatburning section is just plain fun. This dvd is more than worth the time and money and is a great introduction to exercise videos.

Yumi does a great job at showing you the moves and keeping you motivated.

Buy it, sweat and have fun :). This dvd makes you feel like you're personally working with Yumi and her assistants.
Do be careful though in the metabolism boost and total body sculpt section. If you dont' do the moves just right you could find yourself with slight back pain a few days later for a couple weeks.",1334275200,,1210,4.2894736842105265
3886452,2,B002AL2TZQ,"I was excited when I received this in the mail after the wonderful reviews I read about it.  Unfortunately it did not live up to my expectations.  I liked Yumi as an instructor and would consider purchasing another of her videos.  She is great at cuing and not the least bit annoying.  I do find fault in her recommendations on form, many times she doesn't mention anything, and others it is at the end of the movement.

This video seemed really low budget and not prepared well.  The camera angles were horrible - they often framed her face and shoulders so you could not even see the movement or they would focus on the low impact girl who is doing the move you started with so you can't even see what the more advanced moves are.  The three were often not in sync at all.  I found the whole thing extremely repetitive.

The cardio section had a lot of kickboxing and punching.  It was ok, but repetitive and lacking instruction on form for those that usually do not do these types of movements..  The metabolism boost was probably my favorite, it had cardio intervals with strength, but the movements were repetitive and I didn't feel like I was getting my heart rate up.  The strength part was SUPER repetitive and boring, I stuck through until the end but I had to force myself.  And I absolutely hated the ab workouts, which consisted of a lot of plank and stomach work that didn't seem effective or time efficient.

I would never waste my time with this workout again and I will be selling my copy.  I vote that it is not worth the money, there are many better work out videos out there.  If I could I would give it a 2.5, but it is definitely not even a 3 in my book.",1326153600,12,1675,4.32051282051282
3886460,5,B002AL2TZQ,"Everything you want in a good workout. There is not that much jumping as, say, Jillian Michaels' routines, but you get just as good a workout. Also, it is not repetitive, so that means its hard(er)to get bored with this DVD.",1323820800,,224,4.487804878048781
3886461,4,B002AL2TZQ,"I really like this DVD.  I recently started working out at home when my kids are napping because I can never find the time to get to the gym.  I'm in moderately good shape, but need to tone up and lose a few pounds, and this workout is helping me get there.  I'm a runner and was surprised that after the first Body Sculpting segment my thighs were killing me! All those squats work muscles that I'm not used to working. I like the use of weights in combination with cardio, and I really like that all I need to do these workouts is the weights - no balls, bands, steps, etc. My only complaint is that I'm very uncoordinated and I find the Cardio section (with kickboxing) hard to follow. I've only done that part 3 times so maybe it will get easier for me.

3886462,5,B002AL2TZQ,"Che bello che  questo allenamento mi piace tantissimo io di solito lo faccio dopo aver fatto un workout della Leslie Sansone o 4 o 3 miglia e mi sento benissimo dopo, io compro tantissimi dvd di fitness sono una appassionata di allenamenti in casa, la palestra non la sopporto, e poi  anche pi pratico. solitamente non scrivo recensioni su dvd ma quando mi piacciono in modo particolare si. Ora ho ordinato Shape: Ultimate Bikini Body Workout cos alterno un giorno uno e un giorno l'altro. Io adoro questi allenamenti della Shape e sicuramente comprer molti altri e spero che Shape faccia altri dvd.
Altamente consigliato.",1305676800,3,622,4.914285714285715
3886463,4,B002AL2TZQ,"Yumi lee is an excellent instructor.  The dvd has four sections--cardio kickboxing, toning, 'metabolism boost,' and abdominals (which is 10 minutes compared to each of the aforementioned's 20 minute lengths).  A strength of the DVD is that it really targets the legs and glutes without giving you the dreaded hamstring-burn-of-death the next day, it's a nice all-over tightness instead.  The metabolism portion was a bit too reminiscent of the strength portion, but other sections could be combined to make a complete, effective, informative workout.  Quality!",1303171200,,560,5.552941176470588
3886464,5,B002AL2TZQ,"Completed workout for people in shape. You will exercise every single muscle of your body and you will see results in less than a month. Great if you don't have strong knees like myself, because it is a low impact workout. However, you will sweat and burn calories to the maximum. I swim twice per week but I exercise with this dvd once or twice per week and I can tell that it is very effective in terms of strengh and shape. The instructor is clear, direct, no bs and has nothing in common with the girl in the cover. One of my favourite videos. It has also the advantage of having an all region format, so I can use it anywhere.",1286496000,,631,4.180327868852459
3886465,4,B002AL2TZQ,"I would place myself at a medium level of fitness.

Pros:  Overall, I felt this was a really good workout - worked up a decent sweat on three of the four routines.  Really good instructor is non annoying and has great explanations and reminders.  Has three levels so you can choose beginner, medium, and high fitness level.

Cons:  Excellent for beginners with thorough explanations and breakdowns to demonstrate moves progressively - the downside meaning it really slowed down the kickbox cardio section.  Routines have a lot of balancing moves that I don't love (but is very popular as a strengthening technique) and not keen on the one foot hopping in place.  The abs section has long stretch breaks between moves which is good if you are just starting out but, again, really drags down the segment if you want a more intensive workout.  As I progressed and gained more endurance, I found these cons outweighed the pros.

I haven't seen much else by this instructor --- hope she does more workouts for shape.",1280361600,,1011,4.791907514450867
3886466,4,B002AL2TZQ,"I was very impressed with this video.  This video is for the intermediate exerciser.  There are three intensity levels/modifications available.  However, I cannot imagine a beginner doing the ""Level One"".  There are many compound moves.  Although I have one not so great knee, the higher-impact exercises did not irritate it.  With that stated, I will have to keep my eye out for more Yumi Lee videos.  My only issues are the toning section did not last 20 minutes.  Lastly, the bonus ab segment didn't make any sense to me.  Only when she used a real world example of how to do the excercises did I start to understand how I was supposed to do them.

Off topic:  The lady on the box is NOT in the video.  That makes about as much sense as the ab segment.  So four stars for content and zero stars for the cover.",1277510400,3,812,4.405405405405405
3886467,5,B002AL2TZQ,"I am really impressed with this new release from Shape. There are three great workouts that are awesome on their own or to mix & match on days that you want to kick it up a knotch.

The Cardio workout is all kickboxing, which is a lot of fun & goes by quickly. The Strength/weights workout is definitely a challenge in the short 20 minutes it covers, as is the Metabolism Boost workout. I also love the 10 minute Ab Express to add on at the end of your workout which has some interesting moves, instead of just the boring old crunches.

The instructor, Yumi Lee, is motivating without being annoying & cues really well. It is also easy to follow with two back-up women showing how to make all the moves either more or less challenging.

I love this DVD and find it to be an awesome value - it's so rare to get 3 great workouts that you love, all in one dvd!!",1275696000,,858,4.1878787878787875
3886468,5,B002AL2TZQ,"I'm an avid Shape DVD user since 2002 and this is the best one yet! I'm not the most coordinated person so dance workout DVDs or DVDs with a lot of combination moves are not a good idea for me as I tend to hurt myself or others near me. This is the perfect combination. The 4 segments are all done at different levels and I love the fact that the instructor, Yumi, is not doing the highest level! She stays at level 2 for most of the time, occasionally jumping up to level 3 but she lets you know she's going there. The level one modifications are good as well and Yumi will sometimes ask the level ones to up the level which I find encouraging in a DVD. I particularly love that she's not afraid to upper body strength combined with plank poses. I've done all 3 main segments separately and get a pretty good burn going between level 2 & 3. A word of caution, doing all 3 together is intense a great burn but you pay for it the next day. I highly recommend a day of rest after doing it. This video is good for people who like to combine cardio with weights and don't like to dance around attempting to burn off calories and fat.",1275436800,,1129,4.113122171945701
3886469,5,B002AL2TZQ,"I really enjoyed this workout.  This Shape DVD gives you 4 great workouts.  The first is a focus on cardio with kickboxing.  The second in interval training and the 3rd is a metabolism booster.  The bonous is a workout for the abs, which is a problem area for most people.  The instructor is personable and factual.  You are given the option to take it high or low impact.  The moves were challenging yet not overwhelming.",1275004800,,422,4.546666666666667
8359735,1,B002AL2TZQ,"This is by far the most boring workouts I have ever done
I tried all the sections and they are just so dull . The instructor just doesn't have the presence to be inspiring or create a fun or effective workout. I am fit and athletic and have tried all kinds of classes and DVDs and have yet to come across any workout that I dislike more",1463011200,,336,4.029850746268656
8359736,5,B002AL2TZQ,"I love this workout because when I'm pressed for time, I know I'd get a good workout. I love Yumi. She's very instructive/informative. She tells you everything you need to know about each move/muscle, etc. She's a great trainer. I wish she has more videos.",1459555200,,256,4.711111111111111
8359737,5,B002AL2TZQ,"I love this dvd.  I have had it for about 6 years and have worn it out!  It is easy easy easy to follow and when I haven't done it for a while I really feel the burn esp when I do the ab work out and the last weighted one.  I have lots and lots of work out dvd's, but this one is like an old slipper for me.  I default to it every time I get out of the habit of working out.  It is fairly easy, but I always feel like I sweat when I do it and if I do all of them together I get a really great work out!",1454976000,,502,3.3304347826086955
8359738,4,B002AL2TZQ,Great workouts that will work out your entire body.  I love that they are 20 minutes. Everyone can fit in 20 minutes a day if you try.  They work.  One routine focus on toning your muscles while another is a kickboxing cardio routine.  Yumi is a great instructor that will help keep you motivated without being too chatty and annoying.,1445904000,,335,4.533333333333333

8359740,3,B002AL2TZQ,"These are great beginner-intermediate workouts. They are a little too short. I wish they were all 10 minutes longer. A good workout though. Also, i like the instructor, Yumi. I would recommend these videos to be doubled together or in addition to another DVD.",1422057600,,259,4.909090909090909
8359741,5,B002AL2TZQ,"I rated this a 5 because this is exactly what I was looking for.  Exactly as it claims, these workouts give whole body workouts in 20 minutes.  The bonus, they can all be done with limited space.  So if you have a small area like an apartment, or a hotel room if you travel, you will have plenty of space to get in shape at home.  Another bonus, these moves are not ""dancy"".  So if you are like me and have 2 left feet, you'll do just fine with these workouts.  Bonus number 3, Yumi is not annoying like a couple other ""popular"" workout DVD queens!  I wanna be like Yumi.  There are 3 levels in each workout that you can follow based on your own fitness; beginner, intermediate and advance.  Before I started these workouts, I had been running about 3 miles 3-4 times a week.  Unfortunately, in training for 5k's, I neglected my strength.  I lost a great deal of upper body & core strength in the last 2 years.  Surprisingly, I also lost a great deal of balance.  These workouts addressed those weaknesses.  Sadly, when I started I couldn't even hold a plank for 30 seconds.  After 3 weeks of doing one or more of these workouts every day, I am proud to say I can complete the planks without falling!  If you need low impact, you can follow the beginner or intermediate host.  But if you can take a little more intensity, the advanced host offers a great workout in limited time and space.  However, if you are into CrossFit or P90x style workouts, you will not be challenged.  I wish I would have taken measurements and weighed myself when I started.  I have no idea if I've lost weight or inches.  But I feel so much stronger and my clothes fit much more comfortably.  And THAT's what it's all about.  Not a number on a scale.",1402444800,2,1728,4.314641744548287

8359743,5,B002AL2TZQ,"A couple of co-workers and I wanted to start working out at work and this DVD is great for that purpose.  Decently gets your heart rate up.  If we had more than an hour to workout and eat, doing two routines would be a great workout.",1391904000,,233,4.043478260869565
8359744,4,B002AL2TZQ,after a few viewings you get tired of the slow beginners pace Yumi Lee starts every set with. I understand she is trying to teach the proper form but MAN does it slow down your momentum.,1377993600,,186,4.194444444444445
