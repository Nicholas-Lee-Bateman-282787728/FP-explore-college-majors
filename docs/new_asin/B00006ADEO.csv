1736737,5,B00006ADEO,"Very unexpected movie, fresh and creative.  Its a different type of movie that will appeal to every age, loved Peter O'Toole and Joan Plowright are awesome choices and truly make it what it is - very entertaining.",1490918400,,213,4.756756756756757

1736739,5,B00006ADEO,"Stupid name for a great movie. And Silverstone, though I'm a fan of hers and loved her in Clueless, is not the reason to watch it. IMO, Peter O'Toole and Martin Clunes steal the whole show. (And is that Peter O'Toole smoking a giant doob in the outtakes? The world may never know.)",1490745600,,281,4.320754716981132
1736740,5,B00006ADEO,I was not sure if I would be interested in this movie but it had great reviews so I gave it a try. I am so glad I did. This movie is hilarious. Peter O'Toole was priceless throughout the whole movie. He truly carried the show. Great supporting actress with Joan Plowright keeping the laughs coming by being the straight man routine. I highly recommend watching this movie. The funniest parts though were the deleted scenes being run with the ending credits. The scene with Peter O'Toole and the peanut butter made me laugh so hard I couldn't breath. Sooo Funny. :-) Caution: This movie does have bad language so it is not appropriate for children.,1490659200,,647,4.586206896551724

1736743,5,B00006ADEO,"I am so grateful for movie watchers.  If it weren't for you and all of your ratings I would've cheated myself out of such a delightful film.  The description of this film plot seemed dull and ordinary, but thanks to you I watched.  And BOY; ya'll did NOT disappoint!  The presentation of the plot is quite unique, and the cast bring much charm and flair.  It is extremely entertaining and rich with humour.  Definitely a feel good movie no matter the mood, it will indeed make you smile.  Casting (many thumbs up!) was well done, and seeing Peter O'Toole and Dorothy in these two roles absolutely had me in stitches!  Yes it is definitely worth your time!",1490313600,,655,4.538461538461538

1736745,5,B00006ADEO,"This is so funny. I never expected to find a movie with both Alicia Silverstone and Peter O'Toole, but it does work. The pained look on Peter O'Toole's face while the young American musicians make fun of the ancestral portraits and walk around in full antique armor is so priceless. As long as you don't expect anything too deep or too surprising, this is a great movie.",1489708800,,370,4.537313432835821
1736761,5,B00006ADEO,"It's cool but the script, written by bright but post-adolescent sensibilities, is heavy into agism, exaggerating for comedic value. The story is well enough written with jokes related to character over several scenes, reminiscent of Marx Brothers films and O'toole as a more modern W.C. Fields. Alicia, who wins on looks alone, conveys the ingenue with authenticity. I'm still laughing at one of O'toole's jokes",1489536000,,411,5.338461538461538

Their host are the actual owners, down on their luck, pretending to be the butler and cook. Meanwhile the band's record company is attempting to get them to sign a contract that has fine print they won't like. Since our butler, Lord Foxley (Peter O'Toole ) is also a lawyer, we know where this formula film leads.

The film has charm, but is hardly a classic or even a good comedy. Worth watching one time through.

And every time I watch it again, I see some new element that I missed before - a nuance in a relationship; a shift from indifference, even disparagement, to interest, acceptance, and friendship between characters; even specific items  in the household itself.

1736845,5,B00006ADEO,"ROCK MY WORLD - discovered on a premium channel some time ago, finally has made its way, happily, into my DVD collection.  The DVD was unavailable for several years - but now we are lucky to have this rockingly fun story in our living rooms!  Starring Peter O'Toole and Joan Plowright, Lord and Lady of an English manor house with a gallery filled with paintings of ancestors, are forced to rent out the manor, but can't find the servants, so take on the role themselves, relucantly indeed by Lord Foxley, masquerading as servants, Peter O'Toole playing the off-beat, and quite humorous role with grace and style--and occasional outsburts of temper.  Imagine Lord and Lady Foxley's surprise when they discover they are renting the manor to a ROCK BAND! Alicia Silverstone charmingly plays their lead singer, hired by the boys in the band to fill in for their missing star.  It's not possible to describe in a review all the humorous, romantica, musical style, twists and turns of this really good movie - you'll enjoy every minute - and the outcome as well.

Also known as Global Heresy, this movie was released in 2002.

It's a heartwarming movie with Joan Plowright and Peter O'Tool (The Lord and  Lady Foxley) playing very well off of each other, as they attempt to cover their identities to earn money for their home, Foxley Hall. An American rock band in hiding, Global Heresy, rents Foxley Hall to work on some new music with a new bass player (Alicia Silverstone). That's when the shenanigans really get started!

Though everyone I've shared this movie with has loved it, I believe it was a victim of poor to no marketing. It just never gained the popularity I think it deserves.

1736864,1,B00006ADEO,"I first saw this movie years ago but I remember I didn't finish it because it was so bad. I decided to recently give it another chance since it was on television and I should have stayed away. This movie saddened me because it was so unbelievably funky and I mean that as in stinky. This movie was one of the worst movies I have EVER seen in my life. It was horrible. The acting stunk, the humor was nonexistent, the writing pathetic, the plot predictable and it had more holes in it than a cheese grater. The film also seemed to be filmed on a budget of 100 dollars or less.

The reason I found it sad the most was because of Alicia Silverstone. I was a big fan of Alicia's back in the 90's when she was one of the hottest actresses around. It was pitiful seeing her in something like this and all I could think about was how fast she faded from super stardom.

As the movie went on I kept wondering and asking myself why in the world Alicia would be in this crap? I know the mighty has fallen but this was pathetic. This movie would've been horrible if anyone was in it but it was sad to see Alicia waste the talent she has left on this. But I guess beggers can't be choosers.

I will forever be an Alicia fan and for those who don't remember her glory days, please do not watch this and make a decision about Alicia based on this grotesque film. If you really wanna see Alicia in something decent then check out her older films. Even Excess Baggage was better than this. You can also catch her in various co-starring roles since this movie and they are well worth it compared to this crud.

The music wasn't even good. Nothing about this film was redeemable. Peter O'Toole and Joan Plowright were the best things about this film. At least they were half funny. Everyone else was...sad. Just sad. This movie should have never been made.

Skip at all costs or if you must see it, wait until it comes on television. This film isn't worth buying from the dollar bin.

Rock my world? Really? How about just keeping me from throwing up during this ridiculous movie?",1323820800,,2062,4.287917737789203
1736865,3,B00006ADEO,"This movie was much better than I expected, but not to Alicia Silverstone's credit. Peter O'Toole, Joan Plowright and the band's cast of characters are very amusing here. I found the movie quite funny and oddly enough the band was so good I'd buy the soundtrack if it existed. Alicia is basically a bump on a log here but her bandmates are believable actors so i recommend it as a fun rock flick.",1295827200,,396,4.438356164383562
1736866,5,B00006ADEO,"This review will probably never see the light of day.  Amazon has refused to publish my last four reviews and of course I have no business knowing why.  This is such a good find I can't resist doing it.

I hessitate to call the sounds the rock band make music, but generosity compels it.  You, hopefully will enjoy it because there is a lot here--more than necessary.  Even it can't detract from this very funny and charming movie.  With O'Toole it is assured.

A very stiff Lord and his lady, strapped for cash, rent their mansion to this country's most famous rock band annonymously.  To keep it secret the butler and cook are sent on holiday.  Time runs out and the group's arrival is immenent, but they are still without staff, so the lord must assume duties of the butler while his lady acts as cook.  From this point all fun breaks out.

1736869,2,B00006ADEO,"A light-hearted comedy about a pair of English aristocrats forced to rent out their estate to an American band and pose as their servants. This is a vehicle solely for the enhancement of Peter O'Toole and no one else. Alicia Silverstone is completely underused, with her supporting role barely a bit more than a cameo; it could've been anyone else in that role and the movie would've still been the same. This movie is okay to watch on a rainy afternoon, while you are channel surfing.",1210896000,,485,4.651162790697675

O'Toole and Plowright are adorable and the rest of the cast mesh really well.  The icing on the cake is the excellent music!!  I'm so mad they didn't make a soundtrack!  If you're interested, however, the band Casino that played most of the songs (along with Northstar which is a separate band by the by) is now called SpiderSimpson.  The lead singer is the actually the guy who wrote/co-wrote the songs in the movie.

The treat here is Peter O'Toole (sounds way, way too much like the name of a porn star). He adds his own ""vintage"" style to this flick. The other actors hold their own and make this a fun Straight-To-Video release. Alicia is on the cover for marketing purposes. DO NOT think that she is the focal point of this film or you will be let down!
Overall, better than I expected. Being a pop/rock music fan also helps!",1193184000,,570,4.287037037037037
1736911,4,B00006ADEO,"""Global Heresy"" a/k/a ""Rock My World"" is an odd little ($12 Million) production that was incorrectly marketed as another ""Spinal Tap"". I've seen ""Spinal Tap"" and this is no ......... But what it lacks in comedy it makes up in unpretentious charm.

You wonder what idiot determines the target audience for these productions. With Alicia Silverstone posed in tight silver pants on the poster, they tried unsuccessfully to market it to Gen X viewers; but Alicia has at best a small supporting role and never appears in the pictured outfit so it is no surprise that it did not catch on with that demographic. Peter O'Toole and Joan Plowright play the two main characters and they are unlikely to attract young viewers. Baby boomers are the audience most likely to connect with the film, despite a cast that is a mix of actors older and younger than that group. But boomers are the real rock fans and are old enough to appreciate the subtle script and the underplayed performances of O'Toole and Plowright. Too bad it was not originally marketed to that group.

The original ill-conceived title refers to the name of an American rock band whose founder has disappeared and is feared dead. Needing time to integrate his replacement (bass player Silverstone) into the group, their management company rents an English estate from the impoverished Lord and Lady Foxley where they can secretly rework their material. The couple finds out that they can make even more money by impersonating the servants. Much the same premise as ""High Spirits"", where O'Toole rented his haunted Irish castle to tourists.

The band members like to party but are basically likable young people and their music is actually pretty good. O'Toole's character starts out as a Lionel Barrymore type curmudgeon but eventually loosens up (big surprise). The two disparate groups learn a lot from each other and the film almost crosses the line into sappy city. Fortunately Plowright manages to hold things together with a performance that nicely grounds things and makes the whole concept seem plausible.

On the plus side the film was nicely shot and has an overall great look to it. And there is a nice bit of misdirection concerning the record company executive that you might or might not see coming-the clues are there but you might miss them.

On the minus side there is an extremely weak homage to George Roy Hill's ""Funny Farm""; instead of a speeding mailman ""Rock My World"" has a Mini driver paperboy who terrorizes O'Toole's character. This bit is not funny the first time and is repeated on countless occasions throughout the film.

Bottom line, ""Rock My World"" is a good watch for boomers.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1157328000,,2711,4.867678958785249

I was surprised the see Peter O'Toole and Joan Plowright in these roles but they seemed to be having fun!! I like when actors take on tongue in cheek roles and don't mind stepping down a bit.

I made sure I caught the full movie next time it was showing. I must admit that I found the movie fun to watch.  You didn't have to think, you didn't have the melodrama or depressing attitudes of today's movies. You just sit and enjoy the movie and the music.",1143590400,,602,4.271929824561403
1736914,5,B00006ADEO,"This is a surprisingly good and entertaining movie you've probably never heard of, and it's a shame.  Just spending ninety minutes with Peter O'Toole and Joan Plowright is worth the price!  They play a snooty Lord and Lady undergoing financial strife who rent out their lovely manor to a famous rock band who is looking for a place to regroup and write new music.  They've lost their founder and leader, and have hired Alicia Silverstone to replace him as their bassist.  But what makes this movie so delightful is the cultural differences we see between the masquerading butler and his wife and the wordly demeanor of the band members.  Director Sidney J. Furie smartly keeps the focus on these differences and how the inter-relationships change all involved.  The entire cast is perfect, with Silverstone surrendering gracefully to the marvelous performances of the seasoned veterans.  ROCK MY WORLD is a refreshingly entertaining surprise of a movie.

1736915,4,B00006ADEO,I saw this on Starz a couple weeks ago and ever since i have wanted to get the movie just for the music.  I was really disappointed to find they didn't have a soundtrack to it.  The movie itself isn't that bad. A little predictable (but that is typical Disney there) but good.  Does casino have any cds out?,1096156800,,307,4.169491525423729
1736916,4,B00006ADEO,"it's a feel good movie, and it's a good one. it's bursting with life and one can tell that the entire cast had fun making the movie. peter o'tool and joan plowright were great, adding just the right touch and the whole band was excelent, excelent. very believable. the plot got a little questionable toward the end but on the whole it was great. i have watched this movie, again and agian and again. the music was excelent, extremely good, surprisingly good and i was very sad, sad, to find no sound track, anywhere, for this movie.",1094256000,,532,4.494845360824742
1736917,3,B00006ADEO,"Thanks to some try-dtv-package, I stumbled upon this movie on showtime. No, it is no threat to ""Lawrence of Arabia"", but it is great fun. If you're down in the dumps, you won't be by the end. I think its great charm lies in the fact everyone seems to be enjoying themselves BIGTIME (you know that before you get to the hysterical outtakes during the final credits). I liked the small touches of dressing up in ""disguise"" and going to a country dance or watching tadpoles in the lake.

 The cast, from experienced to newer are endearing. Peter O'Toole and Joan Plowright are very good sports, easing minor wince-enducing moments with grace and I admit grinning ear to ear at seeing them shake it on the dance floor.

 What really surprised me was the music. I may not be an expert rock n'roll critic - but they was good. The songs stick in your mind and as another reviewer mentioned, written and performed by a band called ""casino"" (formerly northstar). Really too bad they released no soundtrack.

 I really don't care if it puts my good taste into question. I liked this movie. It was sweet.",1091491200,,1093,4.551020408163265
1736918,5,B00006ADEO,"This movie was G-R-E-A-T.  It showed girl power, great music and to have fun.  Although I disagree about all the drugs in the movie, it was very funny and entertaining to watch.  Nat showed that she was very sweet but she could ROCK ON.  The movie's music was great, me and my sister were dancing.  The friendship in Rock My World was incredible, nothing could take them apart.  I want to thank the cast, director, and the screen writer for making suck a good movie.",1079740800,,466,4.423529411764706
1736919,5,B00006ADEO,I love this movie. It is not often that I find a movie that I can watch a million times and still love. But I have found just that in ROCK MY WORLD. It is the perfect mixture of music and cinema. The comedy can't be beat. Absolutly loved it.,1079136000,,241,3.84
1736920,5,B00006ADEO,"I had an entirely different experience than all the other reviewers did for this movie. I thought it was possibly one of the worst movies I ever sat through...and I absolutely loved it. For some reason I think it very funny to see actors scraping around for cash doing terrible movies. The music WILL make you tap your toe...for some god-awful reason, and you will become interested in the charachters, but only because you'd like to see them fail. I love movies like this. Another fine example of this type of movie is Whacked with Carmen Electra and Judge Reinhold.",1068249600,,567,4.68
1736921,1,B00006ADEO,"Not a terribly interesting movie unless you're really bored, the real reason to sit throught this is for the music.  Why oh why isn't there a soundtrack?  Casino is brilliant!  I don't care very much for the movie and yet I've sat throught it four times just to hear this band.  Do they have any cds?",1066780800,,300,4.303571428571429

1736923,5,B00006ADEO,"This movie was great! I totally enjoyed it! But I have to say it wasn't really about music, but about the relationships of people. I rented it, and I thought it was going to [stink], BUT NOW I CAN'T STOP WATCHING IT!! I was really good!",1055548800,,236,4.1521739130434785
1736924,5,B00006ADEO,Alicia Sliverstone rocks in this movie...i came across this movie one night thought it would be silly..but i actually enjoyed the movie..the cast is perfectly cast. and it is a movie that rocks...a must hav ein any dvd collection.,1049587200,,230,4.923076923076923
1736925,3,B00006ADEO,"The plot of 'Global Heresy'  spans one week, when a young,  American rock-band-on-the-rise spends a weeks seclusion in the country mansion of Lord and Lady Foxly in England, who have leased out their home to stave off bankruptcy and must pose as butler and housemaid for the week, to proud to admit their position to anyone.
I found this film a more than pleasant surprise - I'm not sure what my expectations were, but this was definitely a comedy worth seeing.  Peter O'Toole and Joan Plowright are perfect as the pompous, 'old school' Lord Foxly and his broader-minded, long suffering Lady.  They bring a mature, intelligent and extremely dry 'englishness' to the comedy of their situation, which will appease fans of 'keep everything to a minimum to gain the greatest effect' British comedy.
These characters are perfectly offset by the group of talented and exuberant young actors who play the band members of Global Heresy.  Brash, talented, diverse and very, very American, the band members are also dealing with in-band conflicts whilst trying to keep a united front against sleazy record company-execs, and their own abilities to stand up under the spotlight of constant public scrutiny.  Martin Clunes (from Men Behaving Badly) is a wonderful bridge between the two brands of humour represented so far, as the devious hospitality-man whose given the job of watching over the band for a week, and is a definite gem of the film.
Plotwise, 'Global Heresy' may not be particularly groundbreaking, but the various layers of conflict (between Charles and Diana Foxly, between the Foxly's and the Global Heresy members, between the band members themselves and between Global Heresy and their record company stooge) are played out with presiscion and humour, with many moments of genuine insight by the actors well articulated by clever direction which keeps the action and character-development moving.
Add to this a surprisingly good soundtrack - made up of original music from Northstar and Casino - and you end up with a well crafted comedy with light dramatic moments, which is well worth taking a second look at.",1047340800,,2119,5.074712643678161

I kept wondering if perhaps I misread the ratings this received, cause it couldn't have been rated so high. I'm a musician myself, and I still couldn't hang in there, and watch a minute more.... Oh well, music is like that, too, millions will hate, and millions will love the exact same piece of music, or artist. Keeps the world interesting.",1491609600,,455,4.7

It seems like all the movies these days are horror pics, girls with no clothes and a horrible life, with an even more horrible end with no sense to it, other than to make us all get numb to violence against women. It was a delightful & satisfying change so have a good time at the movies with wonderfully kind and compassionate characters who all acted as if  they were having a grand time.
