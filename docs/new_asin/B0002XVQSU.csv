2138295,5,B0002XVQSU,"When I think of Season 3 of 24, many things come to mind. Mainly, Chase getting his arm chopped off, Jack shooting the evil-boss-chappelle in the head, and KIM NOT BEING CHASED BY A PANTHER! Season three isn't perfect, especially when JB is in Mexico, but it brings quality back to the series. Amen!",1096243200,,299,4.555555555555555
2138296,5,B0002XVQSU,"I've been a fan of 24 ever since FOX started advertising 24's first season in the summer of 2001.  I was like, ""wow, a show that follows the clock every second of the way, I gotta see this.""  24 season one was by far my pick for the best season out of the three.  Seeing Jack making the impossible possible (family on the line, presidential candidate on the line, himself on the line, everything on the line) was nail-biting.  Everyone Jack worked with seemed like a potential enemy.  Season 2 and 3 to me both had the same elements, but just different storylines.

  Although I am a fan of 24, I will not ""cuse"" out someone or strangle someone if that person said that 24 Season 3 sucked.  The majority of the reviews here (with one or two bad reviews) gave Season 3 five stars.  I gave Season 3 five stars too not just because I am a fan of 24 and will support 24 no matter what, but because Season 3 has the many qualities of that of Season 2 and 1, and these qualities make this drama series the number 1-2 show on FOX and number 1-10 show in America (drama).

  Some might think my review seems to be on the pointless side, and wonder where are my reviews on the material of Season 3.  But, like I said, if you watch and am deciding on watching Season 1, watch it.  After that I predict an 80-90 percent chance that you will want to watch Season 2 and 3.  Also one more thing.  Kieffer Sutherland is such a great actor.  He's the whole reason why I rented ""Taking Lives"" (besides the obvious of that of Angelina Jolie).  Although he did not have much dialogue in the movie, the acting he DID do was excellent.  In my opinion, I am glad to see that Kieffer got nominated for Best Lead Actor in a drama series.  Too bad he didn't win, but still, congrats to 24 Season 3 for nabbing 4 emmy's (4 on September 12 during announcement, but none in the Sept. 19 show of the Emmy's).

  In Short, watch 24 and you will love it.  Can't wait for Season 4 (airs on FOX on Monday's at 9:00pm in January I think - moved show because of American Idol conflict).",1095724800,,2051,4.1841432225063935
2138297,5,B0002XVQSU,Does anybody know if the season three of 24 will be delivered with spanish undertitles?,1095638400,,87,4.866666666666666
2138298,5,B0002XVQSU,"24 is, by far, the best TV show ever. You have to watch every season over and over, and you always have to start at the beginning and move on through each and every episode. Newbies to the show, watch at least season one first. It will help explain some things in season three. I also recommend seeing season two as well before watching this, but it is not essential. The threat this time is a very lethal, very fast virus, once again in L.A. Set on the day of the Presidential debate, it makes for great TV once again. The time is 3 years after the events of season two. Another great storyline with incredible twists that will shock and take even veterans such as myself by surprise. Only two problems with this season: 1. It takes a few episodes to get the story going, but once it gets going, the story takes off and leaves you on the edge of your seat craving for it to be next week already so you can watch the next episode, so just be patient and it will pay off, I promise. 2. It leaves you on the edge of your seat craving for it to be next week already so you can watch the next episode! I highly recommend this to anyone and everyone who loves a great storyline that leaves you on the edge of your seat and likes to see a good amount of action and hear some incredible music and see great acting. Can't wait for season four!",1094947200,17,1335,4.138461538461539
2138299,5,B0002XVQSU,24 is simply the best! I ordered my 24 DVD set through amazon.co.uk and as with Season 1 and 2 it is a must to see it on DVD. My opinion about season 3: it is just perfect!!! Buy it on DVD and book yourself a 24 weekend!,1094947200,6,220,3.6041666666666665
2138300,5,B0002XVQSU,"Having seen the complete third season two times, I must say that it is a must for every fan. Character development, the plot, the twists are much much more stronger than previous seasons. Kiefer Sutherland you are great, all the cast, all the crew are great.

2138321,5,B0002XVQSU,It came in excellent condition of course and I love this show!,1497484800,,62,4.25
2138322,3,B0002XVQSU,"Although still addictive and fun, there are some jarring characterizations and plot issues which make this season inferior to the first two. It just stretches incredulity.

The good: intense, return of Sherry, very fast pace. Adam + Chloe debut and those characters/actors are amazing. Hector was the best villain but turned out to be insignificant.

The bad: The first 12 hours seem like another season and it seems too impossible to have occurred on the same day.
President Palmer sacrificed his moral code. Just too unrealistic that a president would bow down to a terrorist like that.
Jack was not Jack. Real Jack would have found a way to save Ryan Chapelle.
Tony + Michelle was a good for a couple of tears, but it became pathetic that they tried to copy Jack-Terri Season 1.
Deaths of some major baddies were anti-climatic.
Kim just can't stop being in danger, even with a desk job working for daddy.
I am with Kim, though, Nina's death did not satisfy me.
Such a joke that the other teams were able to disarm the bombs quickly, while Jack can't seem to do anything drama-free.
Wayne Palmer? I don't know where to begin.
The virus was getting played out too much.",1494892800,,1170,4.674757281553398

2138378,5,B0002XVQSU,"The Fox Network series entitled ""24"" is a post-9/11 counter-terrorism television program, which premiered in November, 2001, just two months after the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001. This third season examines another 24-hour time period in the hectic life of Federal Agent Jack Bauer of the Los Angeles branch of the Counter-Terrorism Unit, known as the CTU, as he battles frantically to thwart yet another diabolical conspiracy. The novel structure of this groundbreaking television series involves each episode representing a single hour in this very action-packed and challenging day. The character of Agent Jack Bauer is portrayed perfectly by actor Kiefer Sutherland, who plays an old-fashioned tough guy, who utilizes any means necessary to vanquish the forces of evil. Of course, the rather aggressive and sometimes brutal methods of Agent Bauer often blur the distinction between good and evil. This third season of ""24"" continues to be decidedly intelligent, fast-paced, and suspenseful, and it is a superb combination of the political thriller and action/adventure genres. Its use of real-time plot development, and the innovative split-screen technique, are absolutely brilliant. The riveting intrigue and captivating plot twists keep the viewer totally enthralled, because one never really knows who can be trusted. This outstanding Counter-Terrorism series ""24"" is truly my all-time favorite television program, and I enthusiastically give Season 3 a five-star rating, along with my very highest recommendation!",1486252800,6,1548,5.734782608695652

2138416,4,B0002XVQSU,"If you are a new watcher to the 24 saga - you have already found yourself being drawn into a complete new definition of the word 'cliffhanger'. Season one starts it off quite nice, and season 2 puts that in overdrive. Season 3 gets that way as well, but it takes a long time to start up. With season 3 it felt as if the writers got a little bit lost; a good concept, but not really a way how to bring it all to a good start.

The biggest issue is that this season lacks the timed pressure that the first two seasons had. The villains feel more like idiots than criminal masterminds. And I guess the studio got the feedback as well, as a couple of characters, directions and concepts launched in the first few episodes are moved around. Characters are re-introduced - which might have been a little unnecessary in my opinion - but at one moment everything clicks into place again and it will move forward then so nicely again as you have expected it. The second half of the season makes up for it.

So, if you watched the first 2 seasons and were also bewildered by the first half of this season - just sit through it - don't stop watching. And then you will be so happy you continued watching, and leading up to the great season 4, and the best of the series; season 5.",1485907200,2,1269,4.2181069958847734

Every season CTU has some highly dysfunctional secret agent who endangers the entire world.  Jack kills his boss; tortures witnesses (since that is the only way to get to the truth); is a junkie and completely ignores the US Constitution and the laws of land. The characters are a group of misfits; Chloe is a IT savant who cannot understand humans have feelings but can crack any security system in any language in less than 60 minutes.

2139157,5,B0002XVQSU,"I realized I missed this Season when I binge-watched the series on Netflix back in their DVD days before Amazon.  Definitely this is a cut above ""Designated Survivor""....  Season 3 really hits the mark as far as action, story, production values, direction, sound, music.... it delivers. This is by far the best Season of the lot -- it kind of goes South in Season 4, and further south from there from what I recall. Nevertheless Jack Bauer is a ""hero"" I deeply enjoy and relate to (in my own profession) and will probably watch all the Seasons all over again!",1480982400,,559,4.58

It also deals with issues of integrity and what might push a person of integrity to make choices that fall short of that standard. What pressures might push a person into a no-win situation? Are there any situations that justify acting deceitfully? It also raises the ethical issue of one innocent person having to surrender his/her life willingly or unwillingly to save large numbers of people.

Well done series, and Season 3 is the best so far.  Haven't gotten to Season 4 yet, but soon.  The character of Nina Meyers is so well done...a villain you love to hate.  One must, of course, suspend disbelief when it comes to all the amazing technology feats prepared by a handful of CTU techies, but that's part of the fun of this series.  Kiefer Sutherland can do no wrong as an action-adventure actor in my book, and this series is really showing his stuff.

have seen a few minutes , of a couple of episodes, walking through my living room.  Sure,  I heard the hype,  like "" Jack  Bauer for President"" and since Bauer was my maiden Surname, it always caught my ear !  Now I understand what the chatter was all about.
Well written, directed and cast, this series is a joy to watch.  The real time format is refreshing, the music score is awesome and if there has been any ""bad"" acting, the caliber of every other aspect of this production outshines it.  I will be buying the entire series for my library in the near future.  I am almost finished watching Season 4 and already dreading the show's finale !  I actually sought the show out AFTER watching  Kiefer Sutherland in Touch (on Netflix) which was his return to network TV , after ""24"";  I was impressed with his acting skills & searched for more if his work.

2139634,4,B0002XVQSU,"Great show, good stories, great acting.  2 things prevented me from giving it 5 stars:  First, sometimes there are too many stories going on at once, especially in the first season when Kim kept getting into trouble, time and again.  Second, I just noticed that here in season 3, when it's 8 pm, the digital clock shows 0800.  At 8 pm, it should read 2000 hours. I don't know if it was always like this from the beginning, and I don't know if it gets fixed in later seasons.  Of course this is assuming that they are using military time and not just a digital clock with seconds added to it.  ;-)",1474243200,,596,4.276785714285714

I am a Hugh 24 fan.  season three is critical for insight into the remaining five seasons. it amazes me that Jack Bauer and the other characters never sleep, eat or take bathroom breaks.

2139749,2,B0002XVQSU,"This show has gotten progressively more ridiculous and self-important.  In season 3, a bunch of air-brushed 20-somethings are given the job of supporting super-hero Kiefer Sutherland (a continuation of Season 2).  OK, nothing NCIS or any dozen other shows of this genre haven't done before.  But the utter lack of humor and portentious nonsense finally got to me, after binge watching seasons 1 and 2.  If you like some California mogul's idea of beauty (all blond, doe-eyed, twirly hair strands, half-open mouths and super-sized lips), by all means watch.  But, if exciting and reasonably plausible human beings are your bag, avoid this like poison ivy.  It's toxic crap.",1472688000,,672,5.175925925925926

The good side: Being of the Donald Sutherland era, I've had difficulty of thinking of Kiefer Sutherland as ""his own man""; 24 has set that thinking aside. Also, I love how recurring themes are interwoven... all the way back to Season 1. So, I know I'll return after taking a hiatus.",1469664000,,460,4.287356321839081

If you're like me and find enforcement related subject matter makes for predictable, boring, and highly laughable TV (the entire CSI franchise comes to mind) then you're in for a treat with 24. This show managed to avoid all the ""13 years and under"" and under story telling pitfalls and B rated acting most enforcement entertainment like CSI attracts on TV. It's why so many years later it does not look as dated to me as I thought it would.

2140439,5,B0002XVQSU,"By far the best CIA - Covert show ever produced.  The Blacklist runs a close second,  but Kiefer Sutherland did a magnificent job writing and acting in this series!  I'm simply shocked I never watched this at all while on live TV in the mid 2000's.  It's so good I've been enjoying all 8 seasons, commercial free in 10-day marathon viewing.  Truly one the greatest shows IMO. Would have been 10-stars if it had been on cable TV and more R-rated, but that's all.  SPECTACULAR

That being said, it was a series full of action and suspense and good acting. But, after watching seasons 1 & 2, I was tiring of the constant drama and suspense. I am not saying there is anything wrong with the series. For some, this will be very entertaining.

2140792,5,B0002XVQSU,"I'm new to watching 24.  It is one of those edge-of-your-seat thrillers that gets your blood racing!  I wasn't surprised to see that the director of 24 is Kevin Hooks, who also was director of the series Prison Break which also  has that same energy.  You simply can't stop yourself from watching episode after episode - when it's available on line like this - to the point of exhaustion!

I have MIXED response.  On one hand I do love it... but although I am not a drug user, I imagine that this is what it feels like to be addicted to something that, if you continue at the same pace, simply wears you OUT!  GREAT series.  However After completion of Season 3 I can't watch any more.  It kind of freaks me out a bit and I had a few nightmares about murderous virus carrying assassins.  I need my sleep!  I had a similar exhaustion after about 40 episodes of Prison Break --- also binge watched.  GREAT job but PHEW... What a roller coaster ride!  No doubt a lot of folks will just continue to push through all 8 seasons!  You're stronger than me!  Enjoy the ride!  :)  Yes, friends have called me a wimp.",1454976000,,1106,4.317073170731708

2140871,5,B0002XVQSU,"High intensity action throughout each episode. Only one complaint: this group of CTU people would be considered extremely incompetent in real life. Anything that could possibly go wrong usually does. I find myself thinking the correct course of action I would take that would easily prevent most of the myriad problems this team constantly faces. They cause as much trouble as they solve. One lie causes untold difficulties, whereas if each of the CTU team would simply tell the truth, a solution could be found without all the unnecessary drama. Some characters are unbelievable, like the President of the United States being involved in murder cover-ups, ex-wives being so untrustworthy that it boggles the mind why anyone would have anything to do with this manipulative, vindictive poor excuse for a woman. I find myself getting angry at all the stupidity and incompetence, which, looked at another way means that this series draws me into the action, and I find myself furious by the actions of most of the characters. So, in my view, it is a stunning series that draws you in, confuses you, infuriates you, and engages you. That would seem to be a perfect example of a successful drama series. It's just so aggravating because it mimics real life so closely and angers me at feeling so impotent to correct the problems that the characters face. All in all, a must-see series, and you can try to figure it out for yourself.",1453507200,,1428,4.85655737704918

For example, a guy throws a trash can through a glass window which alone releases a virus to the outside air, but the federal agent only worries about the man leaving the building through the hole in the broken glass. Hmmmm. Too many ""Drop your weapon or I'll kill (my hostage)"" which somehow always works for Jack. The first thing any law officer learns is never, never, never give up your weapon. Because when you do you give up control of the situation to the bad guy. Then bad things happen by bad people. Begin suspension of working brain. At least they compensated with a little more sexiness in the characters than in previous years. Hey, it helps when the brain is off.
  Too many people in important positions making dumb decisions. You have to leave your brain at the door, yes, but too many times you have to REALLY leave your brain at the door. A block over. In the next county.",1446076800,,997,4.383783783783784

The show makes everything seem like the CTU  characters are the only ones who can figure anything out just because the are standing there. And, my number two pet peeve, they keep arresting everyone and bringing them to CTU. Really?

2142250,4,B0002XVQSU,The first two seasons of 24 had me on the edge of my seat at the end of nearly every episode. Season 3 had a very involved storyline and yet...it somehow wasn't as good. Partly because they kept threatening to kill off primary characters--and sometimes did. It won't stop me from watching the rest of the seasons but I did feel that the first two were able to hold their storylines together better.,1432944000,,398,4.465753424657534

2142343,4,B0002XVQSU,"Acting, art direction, action, casting, almost EVERYTHING about this show is EXCELLENT.  EXCEPT:  it seems incredibly implausible that so many horrifying circumstances and events occur one after another in any 24-hour period, and all are solved, mitigated or prevented, and dismantled with the leadership of one human being.  It is just not believable, although I confess it has me on the edge of my seat with artfully generated suspense.  The show is also disappointingly two-dimensional, leaving out the larger context (including the part of the U.S. in the back story[ies]) giving rise to terrorism.  This show would be perfect if the writers were dedicated to revealing historical truths that would make the origins of terrorism more understandable and this show less like a Saturday super-hero matinee.",1431734400,,807,5.373015873015873

The cast was perfectly played and as the first two seasons were phenomenal we couldn't imagine that more seasons could live up to their greatness but yet again we were hooked. Each season gets more and more exciting. We can't wait to get home every day so we can watch more. It's too bad they had to stop making this series . Very few programs have the kind of ability to capture the dynamics that 24 has been able to. I will keep watching this show until the very last episode of the last season and then watch it all over again. The members of CTU are our heroes! Thank you for such wonderful entertainment.

2142602,5,B0002XVQSU,"Season 1 started it off, Season 2 makes the series a must see, but Season 3 takes it to a whole new level.  Jack Bauer is dealing with a bio-threat this time, and the stakes are much higher.  Their is an undercover sting, the return of Nina Myers, as well as Sherry Palmer.  This season has so much going on, it's hard to believe it all takes part in one day.  There are surprises, intrigue, and interesting characters in nearly every episode.  When going back to purchase the seasons, I knew this season had to be my first I would buy.  This is my favorite season because of the twists, action, and pace of the storyline.  There are so many major characters who die or whose future is in doubt.  Jack has to make several tough decisions and it really shows the true extent of what it means to be Jack Bauer.  Chase Edmonds is a good new character this season, and this season also introduces Chloe O' Brian as well.  Season Three also has some great villains.  The extras on this DVD are pretty inclusive as well.  It allows you to get into the series on a whole different level.  I highly recommend this season to anyone, though I think you need to watch the first two before this one in order to fully appreciate the complexity of the series.",1426809600,,1245,4.337662337662338

2142646,5,B0002XVQSU,Why doesn't the name of actor Morris Chestnut appear in the opening or closing credits for his role as President Palmer's brother/advisor in Season 3? He was not an extra; he had quite a few significant lines and multiple appearances at crucial moments in the plot lines.

2142688,3,B0002XVQSU,"Unfortunately, there are these repetitive and trite story lines in season 3.  The worst is the Sheri Palmer story line.  Are we to believe that the president is so stupid as to let her back into his life to ruin it yet again??  Sheri Palmer in general is a detestable character and really exists in the show just as filler to keep the Palmer storyline going.  And then Nina is captured, then escapes, then is captured, then escapes, captured, escapes, etc.  At least she is finally killed.  And, a virus that causes symptoms within a few minutes of infection is quite literally completely beyond belief and is just dumb.  Bright spot:  Simply put, Michelle Dessler's character is awesome.  She is a good actress and kicks ass.  The action just doesn't reach the level as later shows, but it's okay.  If you are binge watching 24 and you are pressed for time, season 3 is definitely a skipper.",1425427200,,892,4.617834394904459

2142877,3,B0002XVQSU,"Of the first three (I'm viewing them in order), I felt this was the weakest.  Too much of the plot was derivative of previous years.  Devious Sherry Palmer doing bad things?  Check.  Chief of staff making screwing things up because agenda isn't in line with the President?  Check.  Palmer's lack of judgment on these issues was completely implausible.  I guess every great man has a blind spot, but Palmer's inability to surround himself with the right people is stunning.  Jack was fine, although the heroin addiction was a bit nutty.  Even Tony an Michelle have a parallel construction to Season 1 with Jack and Teri.  I was unimpressed with the Kim/Chase dynamic.  On the plus side, the addition of Chloe was excellent, and of course the dynamic with Ryan Chapelle was an instant classic.  And Hector and his girlfriend (and former Jack girlfriend) was high camp.",1419897600,,866,4.8561643835616435

2143246,4,B0002XVQSU,"I actually finished the last episode months back but decided to watch it once again (before beginning Season 4).

In looking back, I had forgotten how intense Season 3 was!

So many surprises! So much suspense!

Of course there are (as often happens in a continuing series) some parts that seem ridiculous but many of the twists and turns one encounters in the series easily makes up for them.

As far as the main character himself (Jack), the thought of cramming that much life into a 24 hour period just makes my head hurt; yet the idea of forfeiting ones' conscience for the sake of winning (at any price) is a cost that will eventually break even the best of men.

For that reason, the last few minutes of this season were exactly what they should have been. In them one comes to see that Jack is, like most of us, human -- and in his pursuit of the protection of a nation -- parts of him are also being sacrificed and put to death. (And not necessarily the worse parts.)

Winning at any and all cost...

Is it worth it?

That answer is no longer as clear to some of us as it might once have been and, as grey (the adherence to relativism) becomes the norm, we -- as a nation and society -- may find ourselves torn between the two while forfeiting what's best in us.

Season 3 was action-packed, filled with surprises, and (most of all - to me) thought provoking...

Watching it should not be missed.",1414540800,,1404,4.344827586206897

2143299,1,B0002XVQSU,"It is difficult to describe how bad this series is.  To start with, it should have been called ""Incompetence - when everything that can go wrong, does.""

The plot relies on characters bungling with predictable regularity, repeating their mistakes over and over, resolving problems more by accident than design.  Implausible and illogical, the show is just the sort of drivel Fox News enthusiasts will be entertained by .

2143450,5,B0002XVQSU,"Great script! Plot hangs together almost perfectly.
Amazing cast.  Mary Lynn R., who plays Chloe, is fantastic. She establishes Chloe's quirky and endearing character within the first few scenes ... And she just gets better and better as the season continues.  The characters of Stephen Saunders, Jayne Saunders, Chase Edmunds, Claudia and Michelle Dessler were well-scripted, well-cast, and well-acted.
Fantastic!!!!
Jack, was everything you would expect--well done.

Elisha Cuthbert does well.  Finally, the writers don't put her character into ridiculous situations.  She is a talented actress.  Good nuance.

Top scenes include
- The final scene with Jack (will be remembered always)
- every scene with Michelle in the hotel and while being held captive
- Nina's smirks
-  Nina's interrogation at CTU
- The axe  (yikes !)
-  Chase gaining Jack's respect and approval
 Sherry with Millikan and Sherry's final scene.  Boo-yah!
 And of course, Ryan Chapelle at the railyard

SPOILER ALERT *** I thought Chapelle was the most annoying character ever.  If Jack hadn't have killed him, I would've crawled into the TV and done it myself

If Fox had any brains, they would already be preparing for season 10.  Complete with Jack and Chloe.  And, find ways to bring back Chase, Michelle and Ren&eacute;e Walker.  By all means, don't screw up the atmosphere by trying to make 24 into a movie.  75% of the tension comes from the TV format.

2143493,5,B0002XVQSU,"24 is the only TV thriller that isn't an insult to the viewer's intelligence. 24 is unique because the plot develops, the characters develop, and the dialog and the video work together. For example, Penny Johnson Jerald returns to give a celluloid chewing performance as ""Sherri"", President Palmer's ex-wife. The Sherri character is as down and dirty as David Palmer is decent and fair. When she holds campaign contributor, Alan Millikin's, medication out of his reach so that he will die from a heart attack, Sherri evolves from an ambitious, scheming bitch to a murderer. It took her three seasons to become a Lady McBeth, but she made it and she is not finished. She is such a shark that she is going to bring down her husband and his presidency if he doesn't take her back.

Her husband, David Palmer, played by Dennis Heysbert, insists that he remain in Los Angeles in spite of an imminent threat of a lethal biological attack. In spite of how noble he is, Sherri gets her hooks into him and holds on as she circles the drain. These two are sinner and saint, the devil and an angel, hero and anti-hero. Like many of the pairings in this series, the writers pair opposites who define each others' character as they move the plot forward. This is unique in TV.
Most TV is either action, comedy, or soap opera. 24 gives the viewer all the action they want plus all the character development they need. It is important to note that no other TV series has ever packed a Chloe O'Brian, Sherri Palmer, Julia Millikin, Michelle, or a Nina Myers character into a series. Women, in action adventure series, are usually sex objects who cry, strip, and screw. The inclusion of complex and developed characters in this and of itself, that is brilliant and unique. I could go on, but where have any of us seen a Claudia, a Nina, a Julia, a Michelle, and a Sherri so brilliantly developed? You'd have to look to Agatha Christie's THE HOLLOW to find anything like it.

2143822,5,B0002XVQSU,Season 3 is the best. It has not lost any impact in the ten years since its original showing. Enjoyed binge watching the episodes rather than watching an hour each week.,1406505600,,169,4.483870967741935

2143836,5,B0002XVQSU,"24 is undoubtedly one of the more creative shows on TV. The premise that all takes place within 24 hours ensures a steadfast audience. I have watched these series features on my Roku over a weeks time and am still amazed at the coherence from episode to episode. My only complaint is that Keifer Southerland  has too much of a role for any believeable hero, but then, so did superman. A great series all in all and a TV classic.",1406246400,,428,4.35

2143867,4,B0002XVQSU,"I hope this Season's plot is not indicative of more to come.  The actors are good to great - but their characters' background stories need work; this would really enrich the plot. I know it's expensive to add actors and scenes but come on - surely Jack's problem isn't the only news breaking story in the whole world that is in play!  A few snippets, a word or two, background TV news, calling in department heads and identifying their assignments, something!  ""CTU"" needs to keep up a 'global' presence.",1405814400,,504,4.640449438202247

2143874,5,B0002XVQSU,This show never ceases to entertain.  On the edge of our seats from hour 1 to hour 24.  Season 4 was the same action and tension.  just started season 5 - two episodes - and we are hooked already.,1405641600,,196,3.9743589743589745

2143888,3,B0002XVQSU,"Watched the first 3 seasons so far. I guess I was expecting more because so many people talked about how great the show was. To me, they had to ""shoe-horn"" in too many scenarios to make things work. It was like watching one of those stupid teen movies where the girl goes down the basement, or into the attic, or into the woods, when everyone knows that's where the killer is hiding. Too many people ""should have listened to Jack"" to avoid the predictable outcome. All that said and I'll continue watching a while longer for basic entertainment.",1405382400,,545,4.571428571428571

2143894,4,B0002XVQSU,I just recently started watching the series from episode one.  In preperation for the series coming back on tv.  I found this episode really good lots of twists and turns and thought provking questions like what would I do in that position!  Jacks daughter is back AGAIN  but she is a better as I found her anoying in the first two epsidodes.  The ending is a little bit of a let down as the lead up is exciting.  Enjoyed it a lot and now watching the tv show trying to figure out what happened in between this episode and now.,1405296000,,527,4.22

2143930,4,B0002XVQSU,"...because I'm not glued to the TV (computer for me, Amazon streaming) quite so much. My back ""goes out"" sometimes, particularly when sitting a lot, and I could hardly tear myself away from the Season 1 & 2 episodes. Definitely not good for my back! I'm enjoying Season 3, but for some reason, it's not as engaging. Some reviewers say it's a season more focused on relationships. I tend to like plots about character relationships way more than action, so I don't know.

It's hard to be critical of this show, when you consider it has twenty-four action packed, high-tech (for the year of production) episodes per season. I don't see how it was possible to get this many episodes produced, written, acted, etc. in the time frame available.

That said, I'll still be a little critical anyway in a picky way. Even though I love Dennis Haysbert as President Palmer, I found the casting of DB Woodside as his brother hard to believe. They just don't seem related to one another. As chief of staff, though, Woodside is great. A similar comment, back on Season 1, I also found it hard to believe that David Palmer's son was related to him. This actor just didn't seem to fit into the family--didn't look or talk like the others. Good actor though, I'm addressing casting here.

Topic shift: here's background has to how I came to watch 24 in 2014, free on Amazon Prime: I had just discovered ""24: Live Another Day,"" and began watching it on Amazon streaming at $2.99/episode. Somehow, I decided to go back and have a look at Season 1, just for comparison I guess (and also since it's free  with my Prime membership). I had seen ALL of the 24 episodes on DVD as as soon as they were released, which has now been a number of years ago. It's been long enough that I had forgotten most of what had happened and could enjoy them all over again. As I write, I'm almost halfway through Season 3.

I imagine I'll continue on to Season 4. I can't recall for sure if it gets better than Season 3, but I think it may (NOT good for my back!) And I don't know if I'll ever make it to ""24: Another Day.""

PS - just a tidbit: I read that several reviewers have issues with Kim's character. The first time I watched 24, I found her irritating. This time around, for whatever reason, I like her. I don't think it's that far fetched, as one reviewer wrote, that she was a ""teenager who partied with losers"" who turned into a tech savvy CTU employee. After all, she had four years to get her act together. Elisha Cuthbert does a great job and is well cast as Jack Bauer's daughter.",1404518400,,2556,4.404661016949152

2143991,3,B0002XVQSU,"While this show is exciting there are some *incredibly* dumb things about it

a. Every season has one or more CTU / Government ""Good Guys"" that try to undermine Jack from saving the USA. It's stupid. The dude saves the USA in every season, after a few times doing it, wouldn't they know to just let him run the show? If it's not one bureaucrat it's another, and sometimes people flip like Tony Almeida helps him then suddenly needs to do it by the book then suddenly helps him again. It's dumb.

b. Story lines with the daughter have no relevance and for the most part are annoying. If he says ""go meet me there"" then she should just freakin' listen.

c. The real time aspect is not believable. No showers, food, bathroom breaks.. ok maybe. But going what seems like long distances in no time at all? That's silly.

d. Everything bad seems to happen in LA, at least in the seasons I've seen thus far.

The best way to watch this is with Amazon Fire TV - the skip 10 seconds button is your friend. I like to fast forward through the stupid parts, usually cuts the episode time to nearly half.

EDIT:
-------------
As I've seen more episodes, I'm liking this show much less.

Almost all of the bad things that happen are a result of people just not talking to each other. There are countless examples and it's just mind-numbing. In the following season (spoiler alert) it turns out that Audrey is captured and Jack is being extorted to steal some super secret thing to save her. Of course he only tells Chloe, it gets out at CTU, and they bust him for it. Then of course he can be open about it and calls the president, etc., blah blah. 10 minutes lost. If the first thing he did was call CTU and tell them, they could've worked together to solve the problem. Nope, apparently common sense makes for bad television.

I have to wonder if there's any plot-quality-control in the writing process. Maybe stupid things seem stupider once filmed, and not so moronic on paper.

This show has incredible potential. But all the dumb stuff is being carried over to the current / new season.",1403481600,,2078,4.447368421052632

The Drug Lord/Mexico thing...and them using Biological

bargain with Terrorists. Or at least we hope that is still
the stand of America.  Just not that interesting of a
plot to me...but others may just love it. It's a personal

2144068,3,B0002XVQSU,"That's what this show boils down to.  It can be enjoyable to watch, only if there's nothing else on.  Themes of political correctness and micro managing by the president, that would never happen in real life.",1401840000,,208,4.75
2144069,4,B0002XVQSU,The video quality is great.  Same old Jack Bauer. The only suspense is how he will avoid almost certain death.,1401840000,,110,4.5
2144070,4,B0002XVQSU,This season is about virus release threat from terrorists and how CTU with Jack's effort prevent mass killing of people. I felt second season is more of an action oriented-thriller while this one is more of action-drama kind.,1401753600,,225,4.947368421052632
2144071,5,B0002XVQSU,24 is probably the greatest show EVER after the first episode I haven't been able to stop I actually stayed up 24  hours watching 24,1401753600,,132,4.28

2144075,3,B0002XVQSU,Some good action. Keeps you on your toes. Story lines are a bit out there though. Would recommend if you ha e nothing else to do.,1401753600,,129,4.0
2144076,4,B0002XVQSU,"It's been great to be able to see these again as I missed quite a bit during the original airings.  As most of the other reviewers state it is addicting and wonder if there aren't subliminal government ""Blip Verts"" imbedded to enhance the effect.  The acting, directing, writing and cinematography is most excellent but the editing is world class.  I can barely comprehend the schedule and logistics to get these out on a weekly basis!  We have been watching these in Marathon style and it is wonderful to have this on Prime and catch up with Jack for the latest season...Good to keep Yang up.

Season 3 is no less enthralling than the previous two and helps to tie down the previous seasons with some closure and new character twists.  There are some issues with believability in a few places as with other seasons but overall it has to be one of the greatest action TV dramas ever done in my opinion.  A must see if you haven't and worth a second ride if you have.",1401667200,,966,4.454545454545454

2144101,3,B0002XVQSU,It wasn't as interesting as season one.  Tony didn't do anything as bad as Jack did but Tony was the one punished.  He even helped after he was told he was going to serve jail time.,1401321600,,181,4.0
2144102,5,B0002XVQSU,"Season 3 was yet another fantastic season.  With the entire 24 series you have to accept the fact that they apparently have no background checks and no redundant security procedures in place, but it's otherwise a winning formula.",1401321600,,229,5.026315789473684

The actors, the plot, the action, the drama all in one show.  Wonderfully done, I just speak for myself.

2144125,3,B0002XVQSU,"First season quite interesting even though some events were ridiculously flawed in conception.
Additional seasons were redundant. Predictable. Watching Jack Bauer was like watching Agent 007!
Super human with super human  results.  Better would have been human thinking and actions with
surprising but realistic results... I guess I am expecting too much...",1400803200,,357,5.846153846153846

There are additions to the primary  characters and some returning ones.  And a surprise but not in warrented demise of a character from the first season.  If you've enjoyed '24' then you'll enjoy this season too.  I never watch the show when it was orginally broadcasted.  But I don't know if I would have had the patience to wait a week to see a new episode.  Being able view them back to back to back... Is super.

involment up to the White House. Continuous suspense due to the traitor, you don't know who they are. Jack Bouer the
star of the show is dedicated to get the bad guys and bring them to justice no matter who they are. To me Jack is a combination of Jason Burne, Rambo and MacGyver. I'm retired, watching TV is my hobby and I love this show.",1400284800,,460,4.423529411764706

2144224,5,B0002XVQSU,FANTISTIC AS always the  cast is a good and they all fit their roles well. some episodes better then others,1397692800,,107,4.35
2144225,3,B0002XVQSU,"Season one maintained a certain level of excitement even though the mini-scenarios created within the overall theme were rather absurd.  Season two seemed to repeat the overarching theme with the same kind of absurd mini scenarios.  So, by the time I got to season three, I was more curious about how this show ran as long as it did given the absurd mini scenarios.

I don't want to be the spoiler for those not yet seeing the series, so I won't spell out the details, but, given the parameters of the show supposedly capturing a 24 hour period, the character recovery from pain and injury starts tilting the show toward cartoonish superheroes and villains rather than drama series.

I have migrated from watching for the excitement to watching for observation of how silly the plot and characters can be.  I suppose it would have also been a little more accepted if I was watching one episode a week rather than a few at a time.  There is, however, something about the show that still has me watching it, even though my wife gave up on it.  Maybe Im now viewing it as fantasy genre.",1397692800,,1083,4.551546391752577

2144237,4,B0002XVQSU,It's a great series that keeps you guessing. Just when you think it's over there is more trouble in the plot. Palmer has almost as many lives as Jack.,1397433600,,150,4.206896551724138

The entire episode goes so fast because its so good, it is like 5 minutes have passed.  I am always shocked when it ends because the time went so fast.  24 is the most exciting show I have ever seen.

2144271,5,B0002XVQSU,"There's trouble in the Ukraine! Gosh, who saw that one coming? After watching seasons one and two, I kept saying, ""I wish David Palmer were President."" In season three, however, David is having trouble getting his ""health care bill"" passed. Maybe David is not as perfect as I thought he was. Still, his refusal to bow to terror and his willingness to put America first and actually oppose foreign nations who seek our destruction is, to put it mildly, refreshing. As for Jack, he will still do whatever it takes to save our nation. Once again ""24"" is the perfect blend of reality and fantasy - the reality that we are a nation at risk and the fantasy that we have leaders who view America as exceptional and act in the best interests of our nation.",1395964800,,748,4.507352941176471

2144280,5,B0002XVQSU,"Got started on ""24"" late in life.  After finishing a two week binge of watching this season I must say that it was pretty good.  Not sure how people went a week between episodes.  The ""cliff hanging"" endings drove me to watch 4 to 5 episodes at a time.

As in all ""drama/adventure"" works, there are lots of times that you are dumbfounded by the contrast in CTU's high tech systems, agents, resources, etc.  Then, out of the blue, they can't accomplish the simplest things or make mistakes that even I wouldn't make.  Like forgetting to watch key witnesses so they don't escape and such.  Overall this is a very exciting and interesting season.

Have fun watching.",1394496000,,663,4.6068376068376065
2144281,5,B0002XVQSU,Season 3 continued the excitement with no disappointment and was full of action we have learned to expect.  Looking forward to season four.,1394409600,,139,5.043478260869565

The plot twists are imaginative, I must admit, but now I'm expecting that the plot you start with will ultimately change into something altogether different.  This was my least favorite season of 24 so far.  As I said in past reviews, I wouldn't watch this show after it came out so soon after 9/11 and, even now, I sometimes ask myself why I'm watching it.",1393459200,,560,4.214953271028038

2144296,5,B0002XVQSU,i loathe jack bauer. Not really really injoyed this series. The reason I loathe him is the fact of getting sucked in to the series and ended up watching too many episodes.,1392940800,,171,4.375

But 2nd half of the season really puts it in gear.  Plot twists, suspenseful sequences, and one of the truly shocking and well-rendered sacrifices/decision sequences I've seen.  Suffice it to say, being Director of CTU isn't a cushy management job, devoid of personal risk (see Mason in season 2; Chapelle in 3).  Binge-worthy second 12.",1392249600,,495,5.294871794871795

This season is about an airborn virus that threatens to take out the population.  The president is a moron who takes advice from morons.  His ex-wife makes you want to shoot her yourself.  Then, there is the show where Jack is ordered to kill someone, that is just bizarre, disturbing to say the least and Jack has no problem with it, probably not so if it had been his daughter.  Past seasons, you have the President giving a pardon to really bad people, but he can't at the end of this season, makes no sense.  Mostly, it is just one ridiculous thing after the other but, like I said, we watched it and I kept asking myself WHY?",1390867200,,743,4.197183098591549

I'm not a prude but 24 reflects that it really is possible to  have exciting programming that reflects ""great"" taste withOUT overboard trash talk, sex, or gore. The amazing  respect shown for co-workers even during tough times....hey public, ""thank-you"" & ""please"" work for me! The family enjoys this so much that we delay watching our regular programs to catch up w/Jack Bauer & Company. The story lines are so well written, the episodes are intense, the acting is so great that 24 keeps us on the edge of our chairs.

Big things happen during this season such as the introduction to Chloe O' Brien, the deaths of recurring characters, David Palmer runs again for Presidency and much more.

2144384,4,B0002XVQSU,"Don't get me wrong, I love 24 and always playfully argue with my wife that we're naming our first born Jack Bauer (She loves the show probably more than me but always says no! I don't get it!!). Yet season 3 has something missing. Season 1 was so original in its style and so patriotic immediately following 9-11 that it blew everyone away. Everyone wanted more Jack Bauer and season 2 delivered. Season 3 is sort of a lull between 2 and 4 though, and we begin to see Jack Bauer escalate from unbelievable super agent to unbelievable super hero.  He is simply unstoppable even while battling a heroin addiction from an undercover operation.

After watching enough 24 all the seasons sort of blur together to me except for 1 and 3.  1 stands out as the original and just plain awesome while 3 simply doesn't stand out at all, and I always have a hard time recounting details from it.

With all that being said...if you like 24, have watched seasons 1 and 2, and plan to watch the remainder of the series, you still need to watch this season before going forward.  Regardless of how unmemorable it was to me, you'll still have a blast and a racing heart while following Jack Bauer.",1377648000,,1179,4.465116279069767
2144395,5,B0002XVQSU,"In my option, 24 brings a great balance to strategic thinking, game theory, psychology, and body language.  Jack uses all of these skills to resolve one improbable situation to another.  Time and time again he comes to the conclusion significantly quicker than others and is resolute once the decisive decision has been made.  The character shows great personal integrity throughout his journey despite all personal expense.  This is a must watch show for all people, but especially more so for business professionals.",1377129600,,518,5.280487804878049

2144496,4,B0002XVQSU,"I love "" 24"" but this season has been a hard one for me. The storyline of drug lords and bioterrorism are surprisingly dull. President Palmer is good but his business with an evil campaign contributor and a greedy husband of his present girlfriend are somewhat boring too. The best part of this season is semi-evil ex wife Sherry Palmer. She is her normal sneaky self and livens up the action with her usual shenanigans.",1366329600,,420,4.613333333333333
2144497,5,B0002XVQSU,I am almost 60 and love the series. It keeps you both intrested and on the edge of your seat. Amazon Prime is just great. All of shows and movies they offer CAN'T be touched by other on demand companys. Get Prime,1366156800,,212,4.071428571428571

2144502,3,B0002XVQSU,Some episodes are great and some are annoying because the situations are contrived . Yes there is suspense but an anti terrorist group would make sure to not let alot of the things go wrong that went wrong.,1365465600,,206,4.447368421052632
2144503,5,B0002XVQSU,"I never watched ""24"" when it was on network TV, precisely because I knew I'd get hooked! And at the time, I couldn't afford to add one more show to my ""must-see"" list.

But now, years later, after getting Amazon Prime and being able to stream the show on my kindle fire, I can't stop watching it!!

In less than a month, I've gone through Season 1, 2, 3, and now I'm on Episode 2 of Season 4!

The show is truly amazing! Not one single episode so far would I give less than five stars!
What I like about the show, besides the action and the drama, is the sheer suspense of wondering who is and is not who and what they appear to be. And my God! All the characters you just love to HATE: the terrorists, the people working for the terrorists, the people bankrolling the terrorists, the people inside CTU covertly helping the terrorists, the people whose bumbling and idiotic acts inadvertently aid the terrorists!! And that super evil, conniving witch of an ex-wife to President Palmer!  Man, this show keeps me enthralled!!",1365465600,,1023,4.454545454545454
2144504,5,B0002XVQSU,"I loved every season but season 6 -- The writing, plotting, pacing and execution are unequaled - Surnow, Cochran, Katz, and Loceff are super, super writers. In fact most of the writers on 24 were excellent. When Jack's parents and brother were introduced as the head honchos behind David Palmer's murder, the program's overall direction went downhill for me. Season 3 is unequalled in its excellence although Season 8 is my favorite. Loved Gregory Itsin and most of the guest stars. I really cannot say enough great things about the show.",1365033600,,538,4.923076923076923

2144518,3,B0002XVQSU,"Barely watchable. It's unfortunate that this show does not have a single intelligent character. Everyone keeps getting themselves in trouble by making idiotic choices. What doesn't help also is the fact that the protagonist, whom we are supposed to respect and admire as a hero, is such an enormous douche -- patronizing to his daughter, ruthless to his enemies, and sanctimonious to everyone around him.",1364515200,,404,5.230769230769231

The only negative comment for me is, how in the hell can one man get into so nuch trouble?  Get past the aspect of his life being impossible and his aim always being better than the armed terrorist and you can enjoy.",1363910400,,508,4.685393258426966

2144534,4,B0002XVQSU,Excellent series for adults.  Watched the entire season in one week.  Every episode leaves you wanting more.

2144535,4,B0002XVQSU,"Season 3 was a little ridiculous only because the situations were so unrealistic but overall, it's still a thriller and stills keeps you wondering. I do think it was ridiculous to have Kim suddenly working at CTU - she hardly seemed qualified given her lack of reasonable thinking in season 1 - ""oh, great idea, I'll follow a stranger down a long, curvy stairwell into his bomb shelter."" Really, Kim? But, still, who doesn't love Kiefer? It's a good show. I've started season 4, and for all the season so far, it's more  of a ""page turner"" so far. I do think, though, it's too violent overall - they definitely just ""shoot and kill"" people without thinking about it - one more way TV is desensitizing people to violence. That part, I don't much appreciate, which is why I took a hiatus for a while. I still turn down the volume and look away when they shoot - not something I need to see; but I love the espionage aspects - and getting the ""moles"" inside CTU. I think that has a very ""x-files"" feel to it, and I enjoy that suspense.",1363219200,,1032,4.375

Some of the characters of the show are ""out of character"" as they do whatever it takes to thwart evil and the bad guys who threaten the security of the country.  President Palmer makes one decision that is totally out of character for him and that by itself was frustrating but all all in all the show continues to hold my attention from one episode to the next.  At one point I found myself saying out loud, ""No, no, no!""  (And I used to be amused at my grandmother who would 'talk' to the TV.  I'm turning into her I see.) Regardless, this season is shocking, violent, cut throat and ruthless as the villians will stop at nothing to further their cause and CTU must take drastic measures to keep it from happening.",1361923200,,761,4.293706293706293

This season is not as well-written as the stellar Season One, with way too many domestic/soap opera-like subplots competing for screen time with the main terrorist theme.  Jack is off-screen too much and often-annoying lesser characters (his dopey daughter, Kim, in particular) clutter the story.  Plot holes and unrealistic story lines abound (they drive across LA in one minute without getting a red light, and no one ever says, ""My shift ended 16 hours ago!"") but it's all so exciting and compelling that you just go along for the ride.

Keifer Sutherland is still superb as the super agent who can do anything.  He is a talented actor and carries the show squarely on his shoulders.  And the special effects, location filming, and high production values make this a great series.",1357862400,,1044,4.864406779661017

But no, the worlds most stupid blond bimbo is here and now a CTU agent. God Lord.... this individual has yet to make one single responsible, mature decision, utter a single sentence that makes sense or do anything but make a total joke of herself.  It wastes valuable air time on this show having to deal with her.  Somebody pull the rug from her feet and let her actions cause her timely death.

Yikes, no more seasons for me... I just can't take it anymore.  I also think the script writers went on permanent vacation, because you know exactly what each character is about to say at any given time.  Very sloppy and lazy.

2144598,2,B0002XVQSU,"I'd heard about this show but never watched it until now, 2012.  I hammered my way through Season 1, struggled through Season 2 and hesitantly started Season 3.  Don't get me wrong, I like the general story line and premiss. But and it's a big BUT, I was really hoping that Kim's character would leave the show and go to college or something far far away and not show up again.  So it was with utter dismay that I see she is now working for CTU.

I mean c'mon, she's the epitome of the dumb blond who's every decision is wrong, drastically wrong, based on immaturity and just plain stupidity at times.  It doesn't help that the script writers gave her character nothing to work on and promoted her awful character as nothing more than an irritating sideline taking up valuable air time.

Shame, this is likely to be the last Season I'll bother watching unless she happens to die.

Oh yeah, it's a little sad that every other characters script hasn't changed either... I can guess exactly what each one is about to say at any given situation and now that Jack is still Mr. 6 Million Dollar Man, Hulk, Spider man, Avengers, Superman, Kermit and Shelock Holmes all rolled together, I'm surprised that any other Agency exists and why CTU isn't really just a one man show.... he sure can't work in a team can he?",1339718400,7,1307,4.466386554621849

2144600,5,B0002XVQSU,"Season Three of ""24"" is a masterpiece of drama.  I'd easily give it 6 stars if possible.  From the very first hour of the season until the last hour, each episode is packed to the brim with tension, action, suspense, tragedy, and triumph.  The plot lines, and there are many, take unexpected, mind-blowing twists that leave the viewer nearly breathless and shaking in amazement.  I viewed the first two seasons of 24, and though it could get no better, yet, Season 3 exceeded all my expectations and more.  The acting is superb, the direction curt and stunning, the music background is of ""movie"" quality, and the plot lines all drive inexorably forward with every tick of the clock.

Briefly, the plot of season three revolves around a drug smuggling ring out of Mexico that evolves into the smuggling of a lethal virus into the US city of Los Angeles.  A terrorist has possession of the virus and he threatens to release the virus all over the USA if his demands are not met.  Jack Bauer, CTU agent and head of field operations is assigned the task of finding the virus and the perpetrator and stop the release of the virus before it can be spread nationwide.

The underlying theme of this season is how the job of being a CTU agent affects the personal relationships both inside and outside of work, as the job is all-consuming, and makes physical and emotional demands that make marriage and family nearly impossible.

Absolutely superb supporting acting is demonstrated in episode after episode by Jack's CTU co-workers, Tony Almeida, his wife, Michelle Dessler, Chloe O'Brian, Kim Bauer, and Chase Edmonds.  Major kudos for the acting of the character Ryan Chappelle and President Palmer as well.  Not enough accolades are adequate to praise the actors and actresses that make this show such a compelling view.

Five stars are not adequate for this season of 24.

2144601,5,B0002XVQSU,"I didn't really notice ""24"" until it's last season. I heard about it before, but never really bothered to try and watching it until it's last season and was surprised that it was actually a decent show.

I then noticed that seasons 1-7 were availible for Prime for free, which allowed me to watch every season on amazon, which took a few months watching a few episodes each week.

Kiefer Sutherland plays Jack Bauer, the main character, who seems to have everything go wrong at the wrong moments, somewhat reminds me of Bruce Willis in Die Hard. Many things in this series such as the circumstances and outcomes are not the most realistic scenarios. If you are looking for a realistic type show, this is not for you.

Each season has many twists in its story, while some more obvious than others. As of this review I have finished all seasons of ""24"", and have enjoyed watching Jack Bauer's experiences throughout the series.

While I am not a die hard 24 fan, I still enjoyed the series and will certainly watch the movie if/when it does get released. Would recommend watching to those who haven't already been immersed by this show!",1331942400,,1134,4.626865671641791

Kudos to the writers and directors for accurately portraying the real time events and how they coincide with one another. They stories are suspenseful and almost always have many twists that you would never see coming. This show doesn't shy away from edgy subject matter like torture and the moral dilemmas that must be addressed in today's sick world. They do this with class and adds to already great stories that make you think along with the characters.

From the babysitter turned top level analyst to the absurdly scripted presidential ex-wife one is forced to suspend all intelligence at the door and the repetitious suspense payoffs are just not worth it. The manner in which CTU is run defies belief - spouses and offspring working side by side, constantly understaffed with employees seemingly unaccustomed to stress, oafish security just waiting to be tasered and an endless stream of myopic bureaucratic bosses hell bent on hamstringing the field operatives.

taking place 3 years after the previous Season, Our protagonist Jack must do all he can to help prevent a virus from being exposed to millions of civilains...to due this he must break a man named Ramon Salazar..""Why""? I cant say..you have to watch it yourself. trust me there are hundreds of twists and turns in this season that will once again leave you breathless.

Bottom line, this show is the most intense on tv, is comparable to a really long suspense movie, and has the biggest hard--- on television: Jack Bauer.  If you like the other seasons, or if this description sounds appealing, then don't overthink it: this show rules.",1226793600,,626,4.553571428571429

2144657,4,B0002XVQSU,"Since there are over 200 reviews probably relaying the whole season,I want to make it my review short and simple.
This season was the craziest, most dangerous season I've seen so far. If I thought Jack Bauer couldn't surprise me, he definitely left my jaw dropped on several occassions. And I like the fact that they show Jack making mistakes that make his character a bit more believable. Although it sucked that almost everyone he came in contact to and agreed to help ended up dead, it was good and needed for the storyline. True enough some decisions seemed rushed and left the audience lost and a bit disappointed, but it was overall a really good season. I think this one had my heart beating the most and kept me wanting the hit my computer screen! LOL
it was a good watch for me and I would watch it again.

2144660,3,B0002XVQSU,"This Series is pure FANTASY. In order to watch it, you have to actively suspend your disbelief. If you can't, you will not be able to watch it. Each Season asks you to be increasingly Dumb and Dumber...but it is still somewhat entertaining (often laughable). Nothing really changes with each Season of this Series. Super Man Jack Bauer...an indestructible SuperHero with unlimited Super Powers: never gets hurt, travels at the speed of light, can hit any target with a pistol, is the most intelligent person ever created... etc. Only Jack Bauer, singlehandedly, can save the World! All the Villains are intensely Evil. If you like watching Bad Guys..specifically, Terrorist Moslems getting killed you will love this Series.. and that is a big plus. The Villains also has Superhero Powers and intelligence... The actress who plays Agent Michelle Gessler is the worse Actress that has ever appeared in the history of TV. She makes all these weird faces in an attempt to portay seriousness... it just makes her look mentally deranged. The actor who plays Tony Almeda is almost as Bad. They both reappear in Season 4, at about the same time...I am sure you will be disgusted with these two. It is INSULTING to the VIEWER that after Season 3, Tony Almeda again joins CTU to save the World. After watching Four Seasons, I recommend you watch each Season as fast as you can. Otherwise, any person with average intelligence will lose interest...if you have time to think about the Plot you wil realize that ""24"" is really just a TV Comic Book: Superhero against SuperVillain... it is Fantasy with a big dose of Violence...and that's what the viewing public seems to want. The Best Way to decide if ay Season of 24, an Audio/Visual Media Creation, is Good is the ability to watch it over again...and still find it to be enjoyable. For example: You can listen to your Favorite CD or watch your Favorite Movie many times. However, using this criteria, each season of 24 is just Contrived Crap,  there is no way you would want to watch it any Season again.",1215820800,2,2044,4.7740112994350286

The twists were incredible, I can actually watch this season over again because it was that good. The very last scene was great, really showed the toll everything takes on Jack. Keifer Sutherland does a great job as Jack Bauer. The Salazars were great, all of CTU. I'd love to do a better review but I don't want to give anything away, its so much better not knowing what to expect. It was easy to get addicted to this show.",1208822400,,583,4.12280701754386
2144664,5,B0002XVQSU,"This is the season of 24 I would compare to a wonderful, gritty, cinematic masterpiece.

I found this season to be second in originality, but first as far as action, plot, drama, and acting.  The reintroduction of Sarah Clarke was great: no longer imprisoned she can get back to being evil.  Reiko Aylesworth is also fantastic as Michelle Dessler and of course Tony Almeda is the best character other than Jack Bauer.  Many of the new characters introduced in this season are interesting and it is unfortunate that the bonehead writers decide to 'off' so many in the coming seasons.

The story arc in Mexico is one of the best the series has shown.  The play between Jack, Chase, and the Salazars is masterful.  Joaquim de Almeida is simply AMAZING as Ramon Salazar.  He breathes fresh air into the villain's role and one can't help but become intertwined in his and Jack's attempt to locate the virus.

Other key plot factors that are wonderful:
*Jack's addiction to heroin due to his undercover stint with the Salazars.
*Kim Bauer no longer being attacked by cougars or creepy bomb shelter guys (basically thank goodness she is no longer damsel in distress).
*Introduction of Chloe O'brien, one of the best new characters.
*The budding relationship between Michelle Dessler and Tony Almeida.
*What happens to Ryan Chappelle (no spoilers!!!)
*The plot tie up of the Nina Meyers multi season arc.
*Part of the story FINALLY takes Jack more than 60 miles from L.A.
*The scandal involving Sherry Palmer and the resulting mess.
*Finally the military does what it does in real life: stop terrorists by shooting them with missiles!
*The use of the decoy in the beginning (the teenager with the 'stuff') so that the terrorists could throw off CTU
*The fact that CTU does NOT get attacked in this season.
*The revelation that the terrorist mastermind is an American.
*Limb-chopping with axes.
*No nuclear threat for once!
*The multi-episode arc with the hotel.

All in all, this season has a lot going for it and it does not fail to entertain!",1206230400,,2036,4.824712643678161
2144665,5,B0002XVQSU,"Season 3 of 24 focuses on a threat of a virus being released into the city of Los Angeles as well as other major population centers. As usual, Jack Bauer is on the scene to stop the bad guys. Because so much of the entertainment value of the show comes from the twists and turns of the plot, I won't reveal many of the specifics but there two major story arcs that should be familiar to those who have watched the first two seasons. First, there is Jack and the other CTU agents who are racing against time to stop the terrorists from releasing the virus. Then there is President David Palmer and his administration that are fighting various potential scandals at the same time they deal with the virus.

The first thing that a viewer notices about this season is that the pace starts off a bit more slowly. It's not dull by any means, but it is definitely less frenetic out of the starting gate. The good part of this is that the writers have also eliminated the flaws that were evident in the last third of the first two seasons. This season is the first that felt like the story had been thought through to the very end with solid pacing throughout leading to a good climax in the last episode. I found this a welcome change from earlier seasons where it seemed that all the good ideas were used up early and increasingly preposterous ideas ruined the story at the time when it should have been building to the big finale.

Jack's character is generally much more under control than we have seen previously. He is still willing to go further than most men would, but he no longer seems to be driven by constant rage or a death wish. I found this change a welcome one. Kim Bauer is also improved as the amount of time she spends as a prisoner/hostage is radically reduced and she even proves useful at times in her new role as a CTU computer analyst. The performances of the villains were quite good, especially Joaquim de Almeida as Ramon Salazar. He brings a combination of charm and ruthlessness that is just right to make him a bad guy you love to hate.

The biggest low point of the season was the soap opera swirling around David Palmer's presidency. This is a man who was shown to be very principled in the first season, but since then he has consistently done the wrong or immoral thing any time he's been faced with a tough choice. His judgment is so consistently poor that I found myself no longer pulling for him and hoping that he would be brought down by the scandal of his own actions. It's a shame, because Dennis Haysbert has terrific presence and the writers did not need to insert all this cheap melodrama into the story.

I've only watched the first three seasons so far, but this is clearly the best one to date. The story holds together much better from beginning to end, and a lot of the worst plot contrivances that plagued the first two seasons have been done away with.

2144671,5,B0002XVQSU,"This series starts off as a slow burn and builds the tension to breaking point. The first episode sets up the game pieces and characters that we are about to see for the next 24 hours. The first hour while slow establishes that it is 3 years on from the last series and the people that we know and love have moved on with their lives. Michelle and Tony are married and re happy. Kim is working at CTU (where hopefully she stays out of trouble, YEAH RIGHT!) and Jack is the most intrigueing of all, he has spent the last year of his life bringing down a Pablo Escobar-like drug lord Ramon Sallazar played deliciously by Joaquim De Almeida, in doing so he has pushed away Kate Warner (the woman he met in Season 2) and developed an addiction which could seriously effect his performance as head of Field Operations for CTU. Jack also has a protege named Chase who is almost as resourceful as Jack but who is also seeing Jack's daughter Kim. President Palmer, we learn, survived his poisoning at the cliffhanger end of season 2 and is returning to LA to compete in a presidential debate with Republican opponent Senator Keeler.

With that out of the way we come to the plot, a body is left at health services by terrorists. The body shows that the person died from exposure to a weaponized virus (think of it as fast acting ebola). Terrorists demand the release of Ramon Sallazar from prison, if the authorities fail to comply they will release the virus upon the public. Being that America does not negotiate with terrorists it looks like there is gonna be a lot of dead bodies, as CTU has no way of stopping it's release, it could come from anywhere.

This series throws most conventions set by the previous 2 out the proverbial window. A lot of the characters that we know and love make some tough life-altering decisions and not necessarily for the better. Jack is just flat-out ruthless this season, he is a workaholic who is still dealing with his wife's murder almost five years on, all he has is the job, he has just about pushed away all who care about him. He does whatever he has to do to accomplish the mission even if it means hurting friends and collegues, the man is separated from his humanity, which makes the ending so powerful, more on that later.
Palmer is almost aloof this season but I think he was meant to be written that way as he has developed a certain hubris from being in power, what he sows comes back to haunt him at the end of day.
Series 3 rips it's characters to shreds sometimes physically, always emotionally and we can't help but watch. The theme of this series seems to be about sacrifice, Jack, Tony, Michelle, Palmer, and Chase all lose something. Even Palmers brother loses the proverbial love of his life in a major subplot.
I feel that this series concludes a trilogy. There is no big suprise cliffhanger ending like the last two seasons, no silent clock, essentially the producers could have ended the series at 3 and I would have been satisfied. This series wraps up the whole Jack-Nina and Palmer-Sherry saga. Which have been the crux of three seasons.
Buy this series, the acting is superb and the themes are almost Shakespearean when you look closer. The plot as I said is a slow starter but delivers a great pay-off with scenes and scenarios that rival those of a Hollywood blockbuster, this folks is TV at it's best.",1187395200,6,3363,4.511475409836065

2144673,5,B0002XVQSU,"Anyone who's tired of Kim Bauer running around, don't worry.  She's pretty much done with that here.  I know a lot of fans of the show were sick of her after Season 2, if not already from Season 1.  While she does have a very minor storyline here, it's small enough to not really have an impact on the rest of the plot.  Thank God!

Season 3 introduces a new storyline and plot.  I think you'll find that it is not like what we found in the first two seasons.  This is good.  I think the writers of 24 realized that they needed to come up with something different, and they also needed to add a new dimension to the character of Jack Bauer.  There is also more of a ""shock"" element in this season, which is why I actually liked this season better than the first two.  The surprises caught me off guard, and, for the most part, the story didn't wander into the bounds of the ""oh, come on, that wouldn't happen,"" which is good.  The story is more even as well.

The first two seasons, we saw Bauer doing some amazing things, but here, you may start to question if he's doing more harm than good on this mission.  Bauer puts himself in a situation that might have you quickly asking, ""what is he doing?!?""  I know I did.  I won't say more than this, because to do so would give away a key plot-point.  In any case, you'll see Kiefer Sutherland add more characterization to Jack.  He has more depth in this season as he has new struggles and issues to deal with.  The question now being, can he deal with it?  Or is Jack Bauer finally in over his head?

The plot in this season has to do with a deadly virus.  This is mentioned on the back of the box in the synopsis, so I know I'm not giving anything away here.  Everyone in the world knows the seriousness of biological warfare.  This was a good direction for 24 to go in.  You figure that after the threat of a nuclear bomb in Season 2, the most logical place to go next would be the threat of a deadly virus.

Once again, the supporting cast is tremendous.  Dennis Haysbert as President Palmer is back and seeking a second term in office.  However, something comes up that might threaten his chances of staying in office.  D.B. Woodside plays Wayne Palmer, David's brother.  He's also the Chief of Staff.  I know it's stepping outside the boundaries to have your own brother as the second most powerful man in the government, but just go with it.  You'll find that this relationship is not all that's cracked up to be, and David turns to an unlikely ally to help him.  Will it work?  Or will it backfire?  The answer might surprise you.

Carlos Bernard is back as Tony Almeida.  I like Almeida because there is a lot of depth to his character.  Almeida is much like Jack as far as dedication goes, but just how far is Tony willing to go?  What is he willing to give up?  These are questions that will plague him during this season.  Tony is now the director of C.T.U Los Angeles.  His second-in-command is his wife, Michelle Dessler, played by the lovely actress, Reiko Alyesworth.

Reiko does a great job with Michelle.  She's able to find the balance between being sensitive and compassionate, and being tough and gritty.  She'll do what it takes, and her focus never really strays.  Aside from Jack, she's the one person you want helping you in a crisis.

Kim Bauer is back in this season, but she's got a job at C.T.U. as a computer analyst.  I know, I know...you have to wonder about this.  Trust me, just let this story arc go.  She's basically been relegated to a much more secondary role than before.  Also, this story takes place three years later from season 2, so one could argue that she's acquired the necessary training.  Kim also has a new love in her life, Chase Edmunds.

Chase Edmunds is Jack's partner, played by actor, James Badge Dale.  He does a good job with the part.  Jack already has issues with Kim becoming involved with a field agent.

Season 3 is very effective because there are several surprising events that take place that I doubt you will see coming.  One of the things that I like so much about 24, is the willingness of the writers to do anything.  These guys are not afraid to kill off main characters or instill severe tragedy into the storyline.  In short, nothing is untouchable as far as their concern.  They are always willing to push the envelope further and further.  24 is a show where anything can happen.  And much like the first two seasons, the episodic power of the show is still intact.  In other words, you simply can't stop with one episode.  You HAVE to find out what happens next!  And it's this element that keeps 24 aloft as one of the best shows in television.",1181433600,9,4669,4.368298368298368

The plot is a little hard to believe, but the whole thing is so well done that whether you believe whats happening could really happen doesn't matter in the least. As always there a number of different subplots running to keep you on edge and most of the main characters you have grown to know from the first two series are back in place. The story grabs your attention right from the start.

2144679,3,B0002XVQSU,"The problem with a TV series that takes place in real time is that, unable to telescope time and flash forward or back, it has to have a number of different and interesting plot lines to fill the time (what would happen if two or more interesting things were to occur simultaneously is not known). So, on this particular 24 hour day a multitude of unrelated crises has to occur. In this series, these crises and their associated plotlines seem to me to be particularly ridiculous and contrived, and the plots frequently cross the boundary from implausibility to complete farce. The cliff-hangers are still often wonderfully nerve-tinglingly, cliff-hangerish, but I find it so much harder to suspend disbelief these days.

Jack is back, of course, doing the right thing, dispensing arbitrary justice, failing to get the girl, any girl, and still having problems with daughter Kim, she of the eternal pout. This time he's solving the US's problems and fighting off heroin addiction at the same time (incurred in the line of duty).

The dastardly Moriartyish arch-villain is fiendishly clever and (almost) infinitely resourceful, but, even though he's always several jumps ahead with wonderful baddie telecommunications  (anybody know why the baddies can always call the goodies on the `phone?), in the end he's no match for our Jack (naturally).

I was sad to see the end of the wonderful pantomime villain Nina Meyer, always in black (probably the equivalent of the baddie's black hat in cowboy films) and just plain bad without any redeeming features whatsoever (at least Moriarty proves to have some). She was nearly (but not quite) as clever, dextrous, omniscient and superhuman as Jack himself - a worthy foe, if you like. Jack shows his respect for her and her capabilities, even when she lies badly wounded, by putting so many bullets into her that they probably sent her to be smelted rather than burying her.

On the side of the angels, there's Jack's new partner (and Kim's love interest), Chase (he does a lot of it, I guess), nearly as devoted to duty, impervious to pain and indestructible as Jack himself, who is in perpetual trouble with his hands (watch and see...). And then there's the brilliant but slightly scatty and totally socially incompetent Chloe, who pulls off computing miracles when not competing with Kim for the Pout of the Year.

In short, entertaining enough, but be prepared to suspend disbelief to the most amazing degree. Should I get next season? In the trailer on these DVDs, Jack, whose previous strongest expletive referred to the male offspring of a female canine, uses A Very Naughty Word and is seen romping in the cot with an attractive lady. I am mortified. Next thing, he'll be claiming evolution is proven scientific fact...",1179014400,7,2769,4.956896551724138
2144680,3,B0002XVQSU,"Wow, you really have to suspend your disbelief to get the full effect of this show.

Are we to believe that a man in Jack Bower's position, not to mention his age would just start taking Heroin?  Even if that were the case, is it believable that the magic pills that Ramon Salazar gave him completely removed his withdrawals for the rest of the day?  Maybe he has some super healing factor.

Speaking of healing, why did they even bother to stitch Tony up?  The only ill effect of his terrible neck wound was he fell on one episode, and had to wear a patch sometimes.

The only person who didn't completely heal in two episodes was Chase, but I did notice him wiggle all four fingers after a hole was blown through his hand.  A few more torture sessions and he will probably be able to recoup as fast as Jack.  At least his missing metacarples didn't get him ""taken out of play.""  To his credit at least he tried not to use his hand very much for the rest of the season (until the end).

Are we also supposed to believe that the beautiful, but dim witted Kim is now smart enough to work at CTU?  Come on, her whole character has been based on her dumb decisions, and all of a sudden she turned smart.  The brief scene where she shows up the new computer man just doesn't give her credibility in the light of her past impulsive decisions.  She needs to be taken out of play.

I work in a school and even there the system policy is that a person cannot supervise his/her spouse.  I would think a high level, top secret, govenrment agency would have a similar policy, especially if one spouse was going to be put in harms way.

Also, what idiot would put an axe in a middle school?  An axe!? Ask any middle school teacher or administrator if that is in any way believeable, and all you are likely to get is a wide eyed blank stare.

Too bad Tony isn't as above the law as Jack.  How many people has Jack murdered, not just killed but murdered, and gotten away with it?  Did anyone take him out of play in the end for the prison riot?  How many innocent people were killed there?  Tony makes a couple of mistakes to help his wife and they want to hang him from the yard arm.

Tony must have forgotten the double secret rule of CTU, that you can break any law as long as you are doing it for the good of the country and are successful.  Tony only had part of that formula down.  Well maybe Jack can get him out of prison too.

Finally, there was no need to bring a baby into the series.  The whole Chase, Kim, Jack triangle delved too close to a soap opera.  I especially liked(hated) the part in the end where Chase wants to settle down, as if that formula hasn't been played out in every cop show:  The partner wants to retire, or sees a peaceful future, then we feel sorry for him when those dreams are smashed by an axe weilding Jack.  Bower, not Nickelson that is.

Enough of the critisims.  This season had alot of action, a lot of suspense, and because Kim is now smart, many of the problems to be solved were not the result of dumb decisions.

I also liked the fact that a couple of the tired old characters were permanently taken out of play.  However, I was looking for more of a twist either in the middle or end.  Nothing thus far has topped Nina's betrayal in the first season.

Season 3 scores a 3, because it moves further and further from what could even possibably happen.  If you really like 24 then buy it.  If you sat on the fence on the last season, borrow it.  If you were disappointed with season 2, you will kick yourself for all the productive hours you wasted watching this one.",1178582400,9,3599,4.221407624633431

2144682,5,B0002XVQSU,"I am continually impressed with the way 24 delivers on all levels, especially going into season 3.

I am a late bloomer to the series. I try not to get addicted to television and suspected I might with this show. I had a few shows I already watched and didn't want to add another.

But during a seminar by Robert McKee, he told us a story about becoming addicted to the show that finally made me go the video store and rent it. I don't need to tell you that I bought the first two seasons and after two weeks ordered the third from amazon.

What I do need to tell anyone who might read this review is that it very quickly became my favorite show on television and it achieved that status by telling one of the most interesting, heart pounding, nail biting stories I've ever sat down to watch - beginning, middle and end.

Most shows offer a captivating premise and get lost from the original idea. (Most movies do the same for that matter). Most shows have a gimmick or a great cast with chemistry that quickly fades with each passing season and most shows tell a story we've all seen at least one hundred thousand times. 24 doesn't make any of those mistakes - not in seasons 1, 2 or 3.

24 delivers. It plays more like a film than a TV show and the restraints forced on the creators, writers, producers, actors, directors and crew somehow makes the show even stronger.

For anyone out there who has tried to write any kind of story, imagine how hard it would be to effectively tell a story as capivating as 24 over the course of one single day -- and now try to make every single hour of it a show stopping hour of drama on television. To me, it seems a near impossible task. And having the love of storytelling that I do, I've actually taken notes from this show. Yes, it's THAT good.

In response to the constant badgering the show receives for its use of torture and violence, yes - it's brutal. One 30 second clip communicates that rather effectively. No, torture is not glorified on this show. It shows the consequences of what violence does to people, about the consequences people must face - professionally and personally - as a result of their choices, including Jack Bauer. And it is important to remember that this is also a FICTIONAL storyline. It's unfortunate our world has changed to a point where we can see the parallels between the show and real life, but this is a healthy way to release those fears that are maybe a little too real to us today.

I love the show. I love that there's a crew of people who put themselves out - I can't even imagine their exhaustion - for working so hard to stay one step ahead of the audience. To raise the bar so high that they don't even know if they'll make it is a pretty amazing thing.

I wonder about how Kiefer is able to stay maxed out for 14 hours a day, six days week to make 24 hours of our entertainment so satisfying. And he produces the show. I don't know how one human being can expend so much energy without fizzling. I'm in awe of him and of all of the people who are behind the camera doing the same thing. I appreciate their hard work and am pleased to be addicted to such a groundbreaking show.",1174435200,5,3167,4.291457286432161

2144685,5,B0002XVQSU,"24 once again in its third season pulls out all the stops in creating countless scenes of tension, excitement and complex entertainment.  This time it's a deadly virus that catapults Jack Bauer and the CTU team into action.  And the return of the spider women, Nina Meyers and Sherry Palmer sweetens the pot.  There's so much going on in this season it's hard to adequately summarize here.  Suffice to say, it's a tense and exhausting season but affirms this shows ability to make the incredible seem credible.

Kiefer Sutherland as always imbues Bauer with a complex variety of emotional crises, including his heroin addiction, his daughter's new boyfriend, and confrontations with the nastiest of villains.  Reyko Aylesworth as Michelle also shows why she's been such a strong presence, as do the rest of the season's cast:  Dennis Haysbert as the President who sees his re-election crumbling around him, and whose calling in of ex-wife Sherry to help proves disastrous; Sarah Clarke as the vile, sociopathic Nina, who once again tries to demobilize Jack; Penny Johnson Jarrold, the coldly calculating Sherry who pulls one stunt too many; Paul Schulze as the seemingly inhuman Ryan Chappelle; Carlos Bernard as Tony who finds himself bargaining for his wife's life; Doug Savant as the doomed hotel security chief; DB Woodside as President Palmer's brother/chief of staff whose indiscretion lands Palmer in the thick of mud.  Actually the whole cast steps up to their roles with gusto, even the usually annoying Elisha Cuthbert who plays Kim, Bauer's daughter.  A riveting season for this superior drama series.",1170288000,,1612,5.145593869731801
2144686,5,B0002XVQSU,"Love the show. Period. Have just finished watching the first 5 seasons (something of a marathon over the last month).

(WARNING: Minor spoilers ahead.)

Seasons 1 & 2 were good, but were a bit too focused on Jack's daughter going through lots of hokey, ditzy stuff. In season 3, JAck's daughter was moved to CTU as an analyst so Jack could keep an eye on her (and perhaps so she could stop being the center of so many hokey, ditzy, whiny moments that detracted from the show in prior seasons). This time around, Jack's on crack (umm sorry, heroin, my bad) but manages to keep a major ""hot virus"" under wraps and contain fallout. The action is good. We finally get ""closure"" on Nina Myers and Mrs. Palmer. For the latter reasons, this season has several quite satisfying moments and ties up some nagging loose ends. Overall, great season.

As to packaging and the discs themselves: the first 4 seasons come in fold-out packaging + outer sleeve, much like the Highlander series and a few others. The first discs contain the episodes themselves, and the last disc contains some bonus materials. The discs with episodes also have an option to play deleted/extended scenes in-line to the episode. Cool feature.

Season 3 continues to do a good job with chapter breaks, scene selection menus, and bonus features. The video and audio were up to par. Of course I don't have a large-screen/wide-screen TV nor surround sound, so I can't test under all conditions. But if there were any video or audio issues I didn't notice them. Perhaps some moire/color issues in scenes with close parallel-line patterns. But I've noticed that on any number of DVD releases of other series from other studios, so I wouldn't say there was any more in 24 than other series.

Overall, I highly recommend this for anyone who hasn't seen 24, and who likes the spy/thriller type show. If you liked Alias and/or La Femme Nikita, you'll probably like 24 as well. There are some ""intense"" scenes and some harsh language, so preview episodes before showing it to any youngsters, if at all.",1170288000,3,2054,4.742296918767507

When you think one thing, a surprising twist is thrown in so you don't know where the story is going to lead, but you are more than willing to follow. One thing that sets this season apart is that a couple of regulars from the first two seasons don't live to make it season four! I won't say who they are, but it is worth buying alone because it is a big part to the 24 universe. If you haven't seen this yet, but have seen the others, then this is a must have. I wouldn't recommend this season to new fans because the deaths won't mean anything unless you have seen the two seasons that back up their stories. It makes it more emotional.

2144693,4,B0002XVQSU,"After the disappointment of season 2 I was anxious to see how it would improve for season 3. Improved? Yes. Even less believeable? Most definately. It's what you should come to expect from 24, plots that come and go, storylines that require a little more imagination to take them seriously. But isn't that why we love this show in the first place?

 The main plotline is the threat of a deadly virus being released and superhero Jack Bauer is giving it his all to stop it. The plots and storylines this year seem a bit more far fetched. Some even completely unnecessary but you should expect that when it comes to 24 episodes. The main villan passes from person to person every few episodes but again, most likely to keep the audiences attention, but it does seem hard to believe 5 different people would hold this virus in a span of a day.

The season starts off slow, very slow. An uninteresting set of villans, and action leads you into the halfway point where it gets drastically better. Nina Meyers, the woman you love to hate, is back to destroy the world. As soon as she is introduced the season is in full gear. Along with Nina we also see the return of Sherry Palmer, another fantastic edition. She continues her no good ways in an attempt to blackmail President David Palmer (who besides this storyline, had the worst all season).

The MVP for me without a doubt was Reiko Aylesworth, who plays Michelle Dessler. She gives an absolutely riveting performance about 75% of the season through and it lasts until the end of the year. Her scenes were suspenseful, emotional, and dramatic. Last season I kept thinking they drastically under used her, and they made up for it this year.

The season reaches its high point 3/4 the way through thanks to Aylesworth, but to me in fell off in quality the last few eps. For the 3rd consecutive season I ended up disliking the season finale. Maybe other people will like it, but it left me a little bored, from an otherwise suspenseful season.

 Despite a very up and down year, the section from half way to about 3/4 through are so good, that it overcomes any inconsistentsy it has. A step up from last year, but it can get better. Still a must see for any kind of 24 fan.",1168214400,,2220,4.493796526054591
2144694,3,B0002XVQSU,"**NOTE: This is a brief review of the actual season, not the DVD or its special features.

I'm an avid fan of 24.  I have enjoyed every season thus far--even season three.  However, I feel that having now sat through five seasons I can reflect back and say with absolutely clarity and certainty that season three was the most disappointing.  And so, Three Stars for Season Three, even though I've given all of the others five star ratings.

I cite several reasons in order of impression:

1. Dark, and not in a good way (ala Empire Strikes Back).  Even though each season inevitably calls for the killing off of various key characters, I feel that there was just a whole lot of gratuitous death and despair permeating the entire season.  Whereas I usually am looking forward to the next episode and watch 24 in marathon style, I actually found myself dreading each coming episode. I wound up having to take breaks of a couple of days between some episodes because this season was so emotionally overwhelming and intense.  It actually affected my mood.  Some might argue that this would be indicative of good television.  I disagree.  Other seasons were able to provide credible death and despair without this level of frustration.

2. Continuity.  It's been mentioned in other reviews, so I'll only briefly touch on it here, but the season is mired with gaps and inconsistencies.  Watching it, you often get the sensation of a disjointed plot, woven together by questionable ties.

3. Acting.  I love watching Keifer portray Jack Bauer, and he's true to form, but a majority of the performances given by even some of the lead characters in this season were sub-par.  As an example, the relationship between Kim and Chase felt so contrived I wanted to smack the television at times.

The bottom line:

24 is a great show.  Season three continues in this vein, with the exception a few issues outlined above.  If you plan on staying caught up in the Jack Bauer saga, it's important that you watch this season. Personally, I think this season could be skipped and seasons 4 and 5 would still be just as enjoyable.  Just remember to take season three with a grain of salt.",1167868800,4,2168,4.707446808510638

2144696,4,B0002XVQSU,"An outstanding series, 24 Season Three brings to the screen the parallel stories of mainly: Jack Bauer, Tony Almeda/Michelle Dessler, Kim Bauer/Chase Edmunds and President David Palmer/Wayne Palmer/Sherry Palmer among others.

The setting is Los Angeles 3 years after the nuclear incident and over 4 years after the events on the day of the Democratic California Primary, and Federal (CTU) agent Jack Bauer is trying to thwart an attempt to release a deadly virus on the general population. As is the case with this series though, there is much more than meets than eye...

Kiefer Sutherland, Sarah Clark (who is GORGEOUS!), Reiko Aylesworth, Carlos Bernard, Dennis Haysbert, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least.  Very well written and very well presented, the series is without a doubt guaranteed to provide hours of entertainment.

The major setbacks are in relation to:

1) There is no closure between Seasons Two and Three; e.g. how Carrie was removed, what happened to Mason's son, the President/Nation rewarding/thanking Bauer for preventing the country from going to war, what happened with Kate Warner and Jack, how they got together and how/why they ended up splitting up.

Instead Season Three starts off abruptly and with a lot of gaps and unpleasant surprises in the form of new, very young and very annoying CTU members.

Way too much has happened in the last three years and we get very little info.

2) Season Three starts off in a rather uninteresting way: the whole Mexican underworld/crime boss is very weak compared to the themes from the previous two seasons.  The gardener's daughter and her brother were especially bad.

The magic of the first two seasons is definitely not here.

The result is that the first 3 dvd's (about 10-12 episodes) were dreadful.

3) There's also the whole Kim and Chase story and the unnecessary child issue (!!!) in typical soap opera fashion...

4) Supporting/minor characters like Adam and Chloe were just not likable.

5) Chase has a lot of nerve talking to Bauer (who is a legend by now) like they are buddies going way back.

6) The President's ""relationship"" was unnecessary and left a bad aftertaste.

7) No-brain-Kim is still as annoying as ever, and now she works at CTU???  It must have been a BIG presidential favor though they could have her do simple things like make the coffee...

8) The ridiculous capture and then re-capture of Michelle out of blue.

9) The average agent's age dropping unrealistically low so that it's almost like a bunch of kids running CTU.

10) The President's brother who arrived out-of-nowhere was just bad and the whole thing brings to mind the Kennedies.

11) Season Three speaks some truths about the USA being despised globally due to bad foreign policy, but ideas of withdrawing within their borders and minding their own business is not necessarily a bad a thing and should not be ""demonized.""

On the positive side:

1) Very original to have the whole series be ""24 hours.""

2) Kiefer Sutherland and Sarah Clark are AMAZING and have an AMAZING chemistry, while Dennis Haysbert and Carlos Bernard were born for their respective roles.

3) 24 Sheds light on US Gov. operations that lead the rest of the world to resent America.

4) A good look into the dirty world of politics.

In short, 24 is a series definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!  KEEP'EM COMING!!!",1165536000,5,3490,4.91965811965812

I loved the show from then on, but knew I would have to get caught up to know what was going on. I never watched an episode again for a long time (because I always worked when it was on). Recently one of my friends was telling me how great a show 24 is, and a store had the Seasons 1-4 on sale for $16, so I decided, why the hell not. I bought Seasons 1-3, then four and now 5. This is by far the best TV show I have ever watched. You will litteraly get hooked on it, as you will want to know what is going to happen next.

Season 3 is about a virus that is set to be released in L.A. and 11 other locations.  This season blew me away! It is fast paced action packed from start to finish.  A lot of events occurred that I never expected (don't want to spoil it).  Please, if you haven't got this far start from Season 1 and work your way up to the end, you will appreciate what is ahppening more.

TV ads and sneak peaks into the new episode keep me waiting for the next hour of suspence, action, plot twists and thrills. A question I would want to ask is would a day like these days go by slow? As slow as the whole season goes? Jack Bauer did say in season one ""this is the longest day of my life"" which I'm sure it was when his wife and daughter were kiddnapped while the same people responsible attempt to assasinate a senator running for president, and in between investigating about a traitor inside CTU.

Unfortunately, I was disappointed by the lack of creativity in this season.  There were also some troubling moral themes.  Three things I particularly disliked...(SPOILER WARNING)

1. Jack executes a dislikeable but innocent fellow federal agent.  This compromised him morally, a new element for this show.  Up to this point, he has had the best interest of his fellow agents at heart.

2. Euthanasia.  When innocent citizens are infected with a deadly virus, government agencies do the *compassionate* thing and bring in the cyanide tablets so that victims can make a cowardly exit.  When a key federal agent contracts the virus, a fellow *compassionate* agent hands him a gun to end it all. (he refuses)  When a villian agrees to be an informant, a condition is that if he shows first symptoms of viral infection, he will be euthanized with a bullet.  This theme was the low-point of this series so far.

3. The president's compromise of his ethics involving his ex-wife.  It is really unbelievable and implausible that he would seek her involvement after the first two seasons.  She is totally predictable, and most of her lines are recycled from previous seasons.  ""I'm doing this for you, David.""",1158105600,4,1347,4.92

1) The President Palmer escapades are far too much - his moral level of Season 1 was washed completely down the drain. I ended up rooting against him.

2) (Spoiler Follows) In the virus attack on the hotel when 600-800 people were confined to stay inside, and nearly all of them expected to die. The show's story has NO MINISTERS, PRIESTS, or RABBIS to help these trapped people in their final hours! What is offered in their place are SUICIDE CAPSULES. I was disgusted. Plus I began hoping that Michelle would be one of those found infected after she MURDERED (not killed) a hotel guest trying to escape. Rather than approach him as is correct procedure to get a better shot with a handgun after her warning him not to try to leave, she stayed at a distance and then fired her gun twice hitting him NOT IN THE LEGS but the middle of his back. I view that as MURDER. She is not above the law and should face a criminal investigation - but this series fails to recognize this limit by failing to punish all criminal actions such as the one I just described.

3) The Kim and Chase romance I found unconvincing. Chase in the series has shown himself unreliable in his relations to Kim and she bushes that away with no discussion. If Chase was truly committed to her as he claims, his conduct should have exhibited no selfishness which he did exhibit, far better at showing/accepting responsibility than he exhibited, and certainly should have shown a clear, full committment to Kim which he clearly did not. They should have backed up their relationship not moved into fast forward.

4) The last six hours of the day are so choppy. Its as if their script was pieced together at the last possible moment. This effected the hour-ending cliffhangers that I loved in Series 1, they became a sham of their former self. I could not wait in Series 1 to see how the cliff hangers were resolved, here you don't get the buzz to keep going.

Bottom Line - the DVDs that I purchased will be traded for something else. (The series' first year is a KEEPER though!)",1157068800,2,2268,4.495145631067961
2144709,5,B0002XVQSU,My Season 3 of 24 arrived earlier than I expected and was in perfect condition.  Really enjoyed Jack Bauer again.,1156723200,,113,4.65
2144710,5,B0002XVQSU,This is great television that gets better every season.  The two main story lines involving Jack Bauer and David Palmer evolve nicely over the season.  This series is addicting and the DVD format is a great way to see it all at once without stretching it out over 5-6 six months as when it aired on network television. I highly recommend this DVD. If you have not yet seen the previous seasons buy those and watch them in order.,1156204800,,428,4.405063291139241
2144711,4,B0002XVQSU,"24 is certainly one of, if not, the best television series that I have ever seen.  Season three is very good overall, but it does have some flaws.

This season has some incredibly intense episodes with lots of action.  It has a major bio-terror threat with a weaponized virus, murder, intrigue, treasonous acts, political corruption and much more.

For anyone who has not seen the series before, I would highly recommend viewing seasons one and two prior to season three.  If you have seen the series before, you should definitely watch season three.

I will include a couple of spoilers here so if you have not seen it yet, you may want to stop here.

One of the worst parts is the disconnect and lack of transition from the first part of the season (the Salazar drug cartel involved with biological threats) and the second part (where a former MI6 operative, Steven Saunders, runs a major terror/blackmail plot).  There seemed to be little connection between these parts.

Some other poorly written subplots are when Chloe, a computer whiz, comes to CTU (a fictional governmental agency called Counter Terrorism Unit) with a baby that is not hers and it is unclear to whom it belonged.  It had no sensible connection with the rest of the plot and should not have been there.  Another one is a situation in which Tony Almeida is allowed to stay in command of CTU when his wife who is another CTU agent has been exposed to the deadly virus.  This creates more than one situation which is totally ridiculous.

There are certainly some hard core ethical dilemmas present such as when Jack Bauer is ordered to kill his boss (one of the terrorist's demands made to the president).

The suspense and action is really top-notch in the second half of this season and makes it well worth getting.  One hopes that the writers clear up some of their inconsistencies prior to future seasons.",1155427200,,1880,4.706422018348624
2144712,4,B0002XVQSU,"I find it difficult to imagine the tension of those who were forced to watch 24 in its original TV broadcast.  As I rent my way through what I consider one of the most innovative TV shows of our age, I occasinally try to imagine how I would have reacted had I only been able to watch it one hour at a time.  I'm sure the suspense would have been unbareable.

This is particularly true of Season three, the most uneven season of 24 so far.  Many sequences where cliche and tired;  Yet ultimately, the series managed to transcend its unequal beginning in the best sequence 24 has had so far.

In the unlikely event someone here is unfamiliar with the premise, I'll recoop.  24 is a 24 episode series occuring in ""real time"" (that is, every minute on screen equals one minute in the lives of its characters).  Every season follows its heros through a single 24 hours day (but the days are not consecuitive - Season/Day 3 occures approximately 2 and a half years after Day/Season 2).  The main hero is Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland), whose position varries with the seasons, but is always affiliated in some way with the Los Angeles sections of a fictional government organisation called CTU (Counter Terrorism Unit).  Every season the heros face a threat, normally from terrorists working in cohoot with government or ex-government officials, and Bauer has to -almost- single handedly save the day.

Note on spoilers, I'll try to avoid them, but I make no guarantees. Read onat your own peril.

The season features three main plots revolving Jack Bauer and the CTU units.  In the show's first ""movement"", so to speak, Latin American Druglord Family Salazar use thge threat of a deadly virus to force Jack Bauer to secure the release of Ramon Salazar, the Drug boss whom Bauer captured while going undercover.  In the second movement, we learn that things aren't quite what they seemed, when the Salazars have to bargain for the Virus, with results which are surprising to them but surely not to the astute viewer.  In the show's final, and best sequence, CTU have to deal with Stephen Saunders, an MI6 defector, whose ruthlessness and viciousness make him one of the most challanging villains of 24 so far.

Meanwhile, President David Palmer, having replaced all of his advisors, is counting on his brother Wayne.  But Wayne is a Sherry Palmer type manipulator, and his machinations cause Palmer to quarrel with the woman he loves and gain a vicious new enemy.  Speaking of Sherry Palmer (the President's Ex wife), she is back with a vengence;  After having almost been redeemed for her evil past in season 2, she is cast as a villain again, losing more then just the audience's sympathy in the process.  The entire Palmer plotline for this season is weak.  Dennis Haysbert is of course excellent in his role, but the story is weak.  It is neither as harrowing as the paranoia-trip he had to go through on day one,nor is it a natural part of the main plot as in season two.  Palmer learns some humility in this season, but his dilemmas felt false.

The weakest part of the show is its trend away from the action series to Soap Opera.  There has been signs for this in previous seasons (and from what I've seen of season four, the worst is yet to come), but the show really focuses too much on the loves and hates of  its leads.  We get Kim Bauer (who, in the wierdest decision of the producers, has become a pencil pusher in CTU) falling into a relationship with her father's young partner, and Jack having to deal with it.  We get a character who discovers that he is a father, and no less than three ex flames for Jack Bauer.  Oh, and I almost forgot, Bauer had became a heroin Junkie during his last undercover mission.

But season three has plenty going for it.  Like its predecessor, this season forces characters not only through difficult physical travails, but also through moral decisions.  In the second season, the question raised is torture - how far can a democratic country go in order to secure necessary information.  In this season, the question is surrendering to blackmail - when an enemy controls everything that is dear to us, what won't we do in order to save it?  Like always, 24 is both refreshing and shocking in its willingness to cross all lines.  I have never seen a show as brutal and as honest as 24, and its grimness means that no one (excepting Jack Bauer, always) is really safe.

In the climax, the show uses one of the best loved couples of the show - husband and wife team Tony Almeida and Michelle Dresler,in order to truly expose the dilemmas of the high stake game everyone in 24 is playing.  Its the nature of the show that the ""good guys"" must prevail - but by the time they do, you are not quite sure how good they are.",1155340800,,4758,4.568396226415095

2144732,5,B0002XVQSU,"On the day of The California Presidential Debates, an infected body with a geneticly engineered virus is dropped at the Las Angelos Heath Services Center. The source is that of a druglord demanding the release of his captive brother, who was placed in prison by none other than: Jack Bauer. Unless his brother is released in three hours, the druglord will release the virus. Anyone infected with the plague will be dead within the next twenty four hours, and there is no known cure. Jack Bauer soon realizes that the only way to stop the virus' release is to track its entry into the country. Jack's assignment takes him on a devastating discovery of what the virus is really meant for, and who truly has possesion of it. The clock is ticking....

Kiefer Sutherland returns as the notorious Jack Bauer, and co-executive producer. This year, he redeems himself with his character and his duty behind the scenes. The third season of 24, is much more focused on Jack Bauer and the story is much more connected in succession than its previous year. More characters are added to the cast to cause conflict, and at times this does not really apply to the main story. Kim Bauer however, is much more intelligent and important to the story than in previous years. She still makes some ditsy mistakes, but not the devastating ones she has made before. The story is much more simplier and this causes the season to beautifully flow with most of its aspects. The story does drag towards the last few hours, but it is much more closure than 24 has ever seen before. The highlight to this season is; the viewer gets to see Jack out of his element. Several hours have Jack tracking the virus down in Mexico, and they are very intense hours. This segment also displays; that it would be great fun if the show sent Jack and a CTU team on a mission, prefferably overseas. Sean Callery also provides a new and refreshing score for this season, and it stands out. Several awards were won this year for its cast, writing, and score. 24 SEASON THREE is an edge of your seat thriller, and a must see.",1152489600,2,2078,4.571045576407506

2144734,2,B0002XVQSU,"I always tell the unvarnished truth in my reviews.  First, please know that I am a dedicated neo-feminist.  I watch ""24"" and I quite enjoy it if I turn off the more discerning part of my fertile brain.  But Season 3 is, so far, the nadir of the enormously popular series.  And, surprise of surprise, I'm not saying this due to the on-going, ever-present latent misogyny that runs throughout the show.  I'm saying this due to the poor pacing and strangely uninvolving story.  Seasons 1 and 2 were loaded with thrills.  Season 3 is half-baked, never quite getting off the ground.  I am loathe to reveal plot details, as many reviewers here continue to do (and you all should be ashamed of yourselves), so I cannot carry on in great detail about what works and what does not.

Most interesting development:  Kim Bauer has grown a brain in this season.  But just when you begin to think that maybe the show's writers/producers have decided to allot a modicum of intelligence to a - GASP! - femele lead... they saddle her with a subplot straight out of a daytime soap, undercutting the skill with which she does her job.  Speaking of her job, it is highly unlikely she would be qualifed for this kind of work (c'mon, she was a lowly aupair in the previous season).  Despite this stretch of the imagination, I *almost* applauded the show for awarding a female character with anything approaching admirable qualities.  Because the rest of the females are as contemptible as ever.

Whether you call yourself a female, femme, or butch-femme - please proceed with caution when exploring the male-dominence of ""24."" Thank you and God bless women.",1152316800,2,1635,4.72791519434629

I rank it right up there with one of the better seasons of 24 because we're already so involved with the characters at this point -- Tony, Jack, Kim, David Palmer, Michelle and Nina. We all are invested in them from the first couple seasons and so we care about the characters, what they do, etc.

Great season, great storyline.

2144738,4,B0002XVQSU,"As I've heard that the seasons of 24 get better as they go on, it may have been a mistake to view Season Four before Season Three, because while Season Three was great, it wasn't as explosive as the action-packed Season Four, which had it's bad and good moments.

KYLE SINGER IS INFECTED-  The season kicks off with a virus being introduced to America by a boy named Kyle Singer, who unknowingly is carrying the virus--or so CTU thinks.  This kick-off to the new season is interesting, but a bit too abrupt and ""placed"" to seem natural.

JACK BAUER IN MEXICO- Jack's stay as a double agent with Mexican gangsters, The Salazars, is breath-taking.  Ramon Salazar is a great antagonist, and the whole Mexico sequence is utterly brilliant.

BACK TO AMERICA- The hunt for the virus in America is a bit boring because every time CTU thinks they have found their man, it turns out to be bigger than they thought, and the process repeats.  If this was done once, great.  Twice, okay.  Three (+?) times, no.  However, the episodes themselves never ceased to entertain--they just lacked the ""WOW"" factor.

JACK'S ANGST- As Season Three comes to a close, everything comes to a huge climax as Jack makes more then one moral decisions, a key character meets their end, and the emotions of Jack Bauer are truly shown for the first time.

Overall, this season is quite work your pay check, even if it is flawed.

Seasons 1 & 2 were awesome and while this season is a bit uneven and at times boring, it does have good moments.  First, though, the bad.  Kim Bauer working for CTU?!  Who would have thought that that would a good idea?  And all of a sudden she's a computer whiz!  Come on!  And Chase felt very one dimensional to me and was glad to see him go (except it was a cool scene when Jack was willing to shoot him in the head in order to not blow his cover - although gun didn't have a bullet).  And Chloe was so unbelievably annoying in this season, I wanted to pull my hair out!  It wasn't until Seasons 4 & 5 that I realized how great of a character she is to the show.  And the good aspects of the show?  Keifer, as always!  I did think it was cool how Jack was a heroin addict from his going undercover (talk about going all out for your job and country!) and the Salazars had moments of being interesting.  But overall, it turned out to be just a ""good"" season.  Season four, in my opinion, is where the show reaches its peak.",1151539200,,1130,3.995515695067265
2144751,2,B0002XVQSU,"I got this (as well as season 2) from China a couple of days ago and now that I've seen it I'm fighting the urge to send it back (without refund) to where it came from. And I will at least put this in a box deep in my closet or basement (not on my bookshelf along with seasons 1 & 2, visible for all to see).

Why?

SPOILERS BELOW!

For starters, Jack deceives the audience for the first several episodes. I had the opinion that Jack was the only person you could always trust but apparently no. (He knows the first virus threat is a fake.) Oh well!

In addition, in that plan that started with breaking that guy out of prison and ultimately intercepting the real virus so many things had to go right and so many things could have gone wrong (as they did) that the more sober heads of CTU who knew about it would have stopped it. This for me is the point when the series goes from very, very improbable to outright defying reality.

Bringing Nina and Sherri back the way they did was a terrible judgement call. In season 2 bringing them back was, for a show that thinks its realistic, not the best decision but, nevertheless, forgivable and I was able to look the other way. This time I can't. Though Sarah Clark is sexy and I loved Nina's new hair cut, there's no way, if this were the real world, Nina and Jack would ever meet again. I'm sure the writers and producers of 24 brought her back because they wanted to find closure in the Jack/Nina conflict. Though it was cool how Jack finally did get his vengence in what seemed like the exact same spot Nina killed Jack's wife, I wish they had done this in season 2.

And I thought Palmer was supposed to be an honorable and wise man who would never forsake principle for politics. How could he order shooting down a helicopter with Jack on without shedding a tear or at least choking on his words? He seemed incredibly indifferent. How is not accepting his brother's resignation better than re-enlisting Sherri (who any sane person would know by now can never be trusted) back to do some ""dirty"" work? How can he worry about his health bill and his reelection campaign when the US is in its biggest crisis since the nuke threat? He was so aloof to what CTU was doing that they could have edited him out this year and you would still follow the virus plot. The 24 writers should have thought about this ahead of time.

But the most bizarre thing about this season is Kim working at CTU. Why would a government agency hire the most unlucky and the most annoying girl in the universe to a job that affects the lives of many? She's attractive but I would never go on a date with her for fear of being kidnapped or chased by a couger! In addition, I doubt the government would let a father and daughter work together because their relationship could conflict with their work just like I doubt Tony and Michelle could be married and be allowed to work together. I've read that Kim is not in season 4 so at least they've learned from their mistakes.

It's not all bad. It has its moments. I still love Jack during this trying ""day"". But only the most die-hard 24 fan should consider buying this. Since I've, unfortunately, already bought it, from now on, I'm going to pretend that this show was cancelled after season 2. From one avid 24 fan to another, please play along!",1150588800,7,3317,4.347334410339257
2144752,3,B0002XVQSU,"You don't need me to tell you what the show was about, how it's organized, etc. In fact, you'd do better to avoid all of the other reviews (and the ""product description"" above) and know only that it's a sensationalist political/terrorist thriller that purportedly happens in real time. Anything else would be giving away plot devices and twists and turns that would diminish your enjoyment. (I will, though, mention one odd one that I don't see in other reviews: the use of cell phones to continue dialogue and keep characters ""in play"" while they move from one location to another.)

What you DO need me to tell you is that the ""real time"" aspect is a stretch you shouldn't get too caught up in. Since I live in LA, and have travelled many of the routes covered in each of these seasons, I can pretty much guarantee that the travel times are often BS. I can also assure you that some of the cell calls (see above) wouldnt happen as they're depicted, because of lousy cell coverage in some of the locations. (Jack's phone may not be a conventional cell phone, but several other characters' are.)

You also may need me to tell you that while Season One was blisteringly exciting and gripping, from the first scene to the last, the other seasons diminished radically in entertainment value. Season two involved several false starts that didn't add much except and episode or two of confusion. Season three includes some absurd side plots that went nowhere fast and then ""back to square one"" (an overused phrase anywhere, including in this series). I started watching Season Four but, frankly, gave up. The plot connections were growing thin, the character backgrounds had begun to be overplayed, the emphasis on Jack has hero didn't pan out as clearly as the network's obvious need to keep Keifer in the mix - and I wasn't going to risk wasting any more time on episodes that didn't add to the story line.

So, get Season One. Definitely. Maybe even watch in straight through, in 24 hours (taking the 7-minutes-per-half-hour commercial reductions for bathroom breaks, snacks, naps, and/or reflection). Consider watching the second season - and skip the other two unless you're just insanely bored and can't find something better to do with your life - which, one might argue, would be sad. :)",1150416000,6,2290,4.777777777777778

In doing so, he has picked up a heroin habit he has kept secret. He's not really interested in the drug trade but the drug lords have ties to terrorists with some nasty plans.

This season has many characters from previous seasons and some new ones. The plot twists are more unexpected than ever before and the geographic range is wider but the season as a whole seems to start off slower. It DOES pick up and it is another excellent effort.

Episode Synopses appear below:

1 PM - 2 PM - Jack has spent a year under cover to get the goods on a drug dealer. This guy has ties to terrorism and a deal is about to be cut where the dealer, Salazar, will give up information. In the middle of signing the deal, Salazar takes a pen and murders his lawyer giving an ominous warning. About the same time, a body is dropped off which is infected with a deadly virus. A phone call reveals that the virus will be released into the general population unless Salazar is released. This is a bug which can kill millions in days.

2 PM - 3 PM - President Palmer gives CTU carte blanche to do whatever is needed to find the bio terrorists. They get and ID on the dead body which turns out to be a low level drug dealer. Jack heads out for his last known address to try and backtrack. He nails a suspect who gives up the name of a dumb kid being used as a mule to smuggle the weapon in. It looks like regular cocaine. Kim, Jack's daughter, is now working at CTU. She is dating an agent and Jack doesn't like it. CTU has worse problems, though, there is yet another mole loose working there.

3 PM - 4 PM - Jack Bauer knows the location of the mule carrying the virus and is getting set to raid the place but the kid makes the mistake of getting in a fight with his father who suspects he is a drug dealer. The kid doesn't know what he's carrying but the virus doesn't care. The bag is ripped in the fight and the kid fleas. The mom makes things worse when the feds bust in. She doesn't want her kid going to jail so she tries to flush the evidence. She flushes the wrong stuff. Salazar manages to get out without the BIG THREAT. A guard breaks him out because his own son in being held hostage. President Palmer has more problems. He is running for re-election and his opponent is ready to spread some dirt. Further problems come from the mole in CTU and from Kim's boyfriend who is a hothead. Because the mole has the kid under surveillance, the agent who tries to get the kid gets hit.

4 PM - 5 PM - The infected kid escapes the sting set up to get him and gets away from the Feds but not from the BAD guys tailing him. Salazar's brother is the guy organizing the terror plot to release his brother. He's got extra problems. His girlfriend is giving him grief about sucking her father and brother into the nasty business. Jack decides that the only way to save the city is to go under very deep cover. He clears it with the president and then proceeds to break Salazar out on his own. In doing so, he further antagonizes Kim's boyfriend. The Bureau of Prisons can't be too happy with him either.

5 PM - 6 PM - The big prison break is not going well. In order to stage a diversion, Jack opens all the cell blocks and tries to sneak out in the ensuing prison riot. This does not work out too well. Jack and Salazar are both captured. Now the cons and the feds are both after his hide and Salazar wants a piece as well. He has to take to the air. Jack's involvement in the breakout has extensive repercussions. Kim comes under suspicion because she is his daughter. The investigation of his office turns up evidence that Jack is a drug addict. Kim turns up some evidence that not everything is going well at CTU. The cloud over her head makes her reluctant to let anyone know.  The president goes forward with his debate and, as expected, his opponent starts throwing around dirt. He does not handle it well although he does handle it with integrity.

6 Pm - 7 PM - Jack gets away with Salazar but does not realize that the kid has been captured. The higher ups at CTU want to shoot down his chopper but are hesitant because of his relationship with the president. The president is contacted and asked to make a decision. This takes place during a live, national debate. The president abruptly leaves the debate and has to make a decision over whether to fire or not. He makes the decision but it comes too late. Jack and Salazar escape. That is bad because it turns out the kid is not the vector for the virus. Something else is planned and Jack has now gotten himself kidnapped by Salazar's gang. Worse, Kim discovers the mole at CTU just as it discovers her.

7 PM - 8 PM Whoa! This one goes in some unexpected directions. Most of it takes place on the plane in which Jack and Salazar are heading to Mexico. Salazar is impatient to kill Jack. Jack doesn't want to be killed but there is more than just self preservation going on. The mole at CTU is being sweated and clearly knows more. What his involvement is turns out to be truly mind boggling. The president is trying to conduct damage control for his campaign. He is hampered by being truthful, by his brother who serves as chief of staff and is more interested in politics than truth and by a girlfriend who takes it into her own head to right the political wrongs done to him.

8 PM - 9 PM - Jack, Tony and an unexpected member of CTU are involved in a sting operation of gigantic proportions. When they clue the president in on it, he is hacked off but sees no choice but to continue. There is a virus. The wildcard in the deck is Kim's boyfriend. He has no idea what is going on and is going to make a serious attempt to screw up the operation. The attempt succeeds. The president's girlfriend heads out to try and stave off the political damage but gets herself in over her head.

9 PM - 10 PM - Salazar and his brother are finally beginning to trust Jack. This trust is predicated on his willingness to kill his former partner and on him being the one to make contact with the guys selling the virus. Special Forces are in place ready to grab the virus and rescue Jack but there is a problem. In his scuffle with his partner, his tracking beacon went dead so no one knows exactly where he is. Jack does head for the meet but there is another complication. Somebody else wants to buy the virus. The seller wants to set up an auction. When the other buyer shows up, she knows Jack and does not trust him. The auction does not go well. Back at CTU everyone is struggling to find out where Jack is but Tony is not functioning at full capacity. The earlier bullet to his neck is affecting his ability to think. The President gets a call from an old friend. The friend wants to meet him without his brother present. He has reason not to trust the brother, the chief of staff, and wants him fired. The president does not respond well to threats and the friend does not respond well to refusal.

10 PM - 11 PM - Jack and Salazar get in touch with CTU to try and track the seller of the virus; the Salazars still think their mole is in play. They manage to get the location where Nina is going to meet the seller but Jack gets himself captured by Nina. He does manage to get her interest is possibly betraying her employers. The president is not happy with the way his brother has behaved but is not willing to give in to blackmail either. Neither is he willing to sit still and let an old friend blackmail him. He calls in the queen of dirty tricks: he calls his ex wife. Jack's partner manages to escape from the Salazars with the help of Hector Salazar's girlfriend and her father and little brother but the girl doesn't make it. Now, he is stuck and awaiting rescue. Getting the virus takes priority.

11 PM - 12 AM - Jack manages to turn the tables on Nina and now she is his prisoner. She is forced into agreeing with setting up a meet for the transfer of the virus. Jack manages to let CTU know where it will happen but tensions and nerves are getting frayed. One of the Salazars is getting cold feet and the other is determined to proceed. The Confrontation gets ugly. Nina is using this tension to further her own goals. The president's brother and ex-wife get together and start plotting. Each has a political motive.

12 AM - 1 AM - Salazar is cold blooded. His brother is gone but he is ready to go through with the transfer. Everything is set up. Salazar is staking out the transfer and CTU is staking out Salazar. Lots of things have to go right. Nothing does. The transfer takes place but a premature shot sends everyone scurrying. In the confusion, Nina escapes and so does Salazar. Salazar is caught again but he does not appear to have the virus. The brokers have pulled a double cross and everyone is left hanging out to dry. The Ex Mrs. Palmer is not having any better luck. Her attempts to get some dirt on the opposition founder in confusion.

1 AM - 2 AM - The virus broker has escaped and is on his way to Los Angeles. Nina has been captured and is being transported back to CTU.  She gives up some useful information but when she offers more, she dupes CTU into releasing a computer worm that starts destroying their computer network. She refuses to tell them how to stop the spread of the worm unless she is released. The president's ex wife is still up to her own brand of skullduggery and makes contact with the wife of the man trying to blackmail the president. She too turns out to be a backstabbing b*tch. Though frightened, she is convinced that if she can get the goods on her husband, he will go to prison and she will get his money. She gets caught by the husband but it's of no consequence since the two women manage to arrange for his heart attack. CTU manages to narrowly avert the computer disaster but that leads to its own complications. The Geek who fixes the network is in trouble because of a strange baby she is taking care of. When she is finally forced to reveal who the baby belongs to, Kim Bauer is not amused.

2 AM - 3 AM - Nina is in custody at CTU. She is being interrogated but not giving up much in the way of information. She manipulates even her interrogators and uses an injury to herself to plan an escape. It goes badly for all involved. Jack is being interrogated also. His interrogation is because he was a heroin junkie while under cover with the Salazars. The higher ups are willing to lie to make his story sound better but Jack is not. The president is interrogating his ex wife. She claims she has nothing to do with his opponent's death but the president doesn't trust her.

3 AM - 4 AM - The president's wife is implicated in the death of the guy trying to blackmail the president but manages to avert suspicion for a while. The wife of the blackmailer is the prime suspect and she is dragging the president's brother into the matter. CTU gets a location on the virus courier and makes a bust but they are too late. They get the courier but not the mastermind.

4 AM - 5 AM - Jack finds evidence that the target is a hotel and a team is dispatched there. They catch the terrorist but not before his device goes off in the main ventilation system. He claims that there are eleven more but will not give up their locations. All that is known is that the planners for this escapade have some sort of history with Jack Bauer. Whether this history is from working in conjunction or opposition is not known and the guys in custody are too scared of Mr. Big to tell CTU. Jack arranges for one of the guys to escape so he can be followed but Mr. Big eliminates the guy first. Mr. Big then calls Jack. He still doesn't identify himself but demands to talk to the president. He has big demands. The president is having more troubles with his ex wife. She owns up to being involved in the death of his opponent but then threatens the president with plausible lies if he tells the truth.  The people isolated in the hotel are beginning to panic. Some are showing symptoms and all want to leave. Leaving will spread the virus but CTU does not seem to have enough people on the premises to contain the situation.

5 AM - 6 AM - CTU now knows who is running the terror threat. He is a former British agent who worked with Jack in Kosovo. He was presumed dead but he is very much alive and looking to kill unless the president does exactly as he wants. He starts out small. The president just has to hold a press conference on any subject whatsoever and utter a code phrase. From there, he goes on. He wants the president to have the division director of CTU killed. Jack has a lead involving a Madame who used to do business with the chief bad guy. He tracks her down and takes her into custody to deliver to British intelligence. He gets her there but the place comes under attack from armed terrorists and many are killed including the woman. Jack does make it out, however, with a vital piece of hardware. People at the hotel are starting to drop.

6 AM - 7 AM - The president steps across a big line. The terrorist orders him to kill the divisional director of CTU and the threat of millions of innocent deaths makes him concede. Shappel's only hope is to figure out what why he has been marked for death and follow the lead to the terrorist. The terrorist is one step ahead, however and is hacked off that they tried to get him. That means that Shappel has to die. He is not a very likeable character but, in this case, one feels sorry for him. More bad news comes when it is realized that somebody has escaped from the hotel and that person is likely carrying the virus. The icing on the cake is that the press is beginning to snoop around and they are going to do their best to turn a tragedy into an even bigger tragedy.

7 AM - 8 AM - Shappel is dead and his execution is trying everyone in knots but life goes on...and so does the threat of death for millions. The head terrorist finally reveals his agenda. He is an America hater and wants to dismantle the entire US military and intelligence operation. CTU gets one lead. They find out that the terrorist has a daughter in college in Santa Barbara. They want to talk to the daughter about her father but suspect that she is under surveillance. They decide to pull a switch but the only agent who can pass for the daughter is Kim Bauer. They pull off the switch but she is soon caught by a terrorist. While trying to escape, she shoots him. The guy who escaped from the hotel quarantine is showing symptoms. That means he is contagious. He is caught in an emergency room but not before he had contact with other people. There is now the potential for wide spread contamination.

8 AM - 9 AM - The virus is out and is starting to spread but CTU finally has a way to locate the terrorist. They have his daughter and convince her of her father's doings. She gives them a private phone number for him. Through this, they are able to locate his position. He knows they are coming but waits in place anyway. He has gained some serious leverage over a CTU member and persuades him to botch the apprehension. The press is getting more and more restless and the president has to clamp down on them. At the same time, he draws a line in the sand. He will not knuckle under any more. Meanwhile, 11 other vials of the virus are still in play.

9 AM - 10 AM - The terrorist gets away because he holds the wife of the CTU director hostage. This seems to be a hostage situation that will just keep growing and the terrorist will get more and more mileage out of it. The situation is used to force Tony to break the daughter out of CTU. The president's ex wife contacts the opposition candidate. She wants to sell out her ex husband and frame him for the death of the extortionist. She's reaching for power again.

10 AM - 11 AM - Jack catches Tony as he flees with the daughter. He forces him into trying a sting operation. Meanwhile, the wife escapes custody and manages to place a call to CTU. Jack convinces her to let herself be caught again so that they can pin down the kingpin. For a change, the exchange goes well from CTU's point of view. They have their prisoner but they still do not know where the other vials of the virus are and the kingpin shows no sign of cracking. The opposition candidate confronts the president with another blackmail scheme. He is insisting that he withdraw from the race. This leads the president's brother to look for some dirty tricks of his own.

11 AM - 12 PM - The head terrorist is in custody but the virus is still in play and he will not reveal it's whereabouts. Not even pleas from his daughter are effective. He has a cause and is willing to die for it. Jack has to get dirty. He threatens to put the daughter in the infected hotel unless they get the information. That works for 10 of the 11 vials but the last one is till in play. It is in Los Angeles but even the head guy does not know where. He just gave instructions for it to be put into a ""very public place with maximum casualties"". Tony is in lots of trouble over his part in breaking out the terrorist's daughter. The bureaucrats are even talking about the death penalty. The president is setting up a meeting with his ex wife. He is trying to distract her while his brother and a burglar break into her place and steal the damning evidence. She gives him an ultimatum and he plays along but she gets suspicious and leaves. She returns home while the burglars are burgling. The brother tries to wimp out but the professional burglar lands the most satisfying punch in the history of television. They get the evidence they need but then the widow of the former blackmailer shows up and makes a hash of the situation. The last vial is located on an LA subway but they still don't know who it is whose doing the dirty work. They manage to grab the guy with the tracking device but it seems it was planted on him. The last terrorist is still at large.

12 Pm - 1 PM - The subway where the virus is presumably located has been locked down but they still have no idea who controls the virus. A video link is established so that the head terrorist can ID the courier. He doesn't get to do his job though. The widow of one of the agents killed by the virus grabs a gun and kills him before he can make the ID. They get a good idea of who he is, though, when he flees and leads Jack and his agents on a high speed chase that ends at a middle school. They get their man but not without a few unexpected plot twists. The episode has taken its toll on the president. He makes an honorable decision.

2144762,5,B0002XVQSU,"This is the season of 24 that most shines.

I reference events from Season 1-3 in this review, but I am as vague as possible, so much that you won't even recognize them unless you've seen them.

If you are reading this, you're probably already into the show, otherwise why would you be starting with Season 3? Since you're already a fan, I don't have to tell you that Seasons 1 & 2 of the show were exceptional, both had their strengths in different regards. But as a hardcore 24 fan, and as a filmmaker, I must say that Season 3 includes some of the most brilliant writing and acting you've seen in the series yet.

I'll start out by challenging some of the complaints fans have had with Season 3. Some say that the season is uneven and inconsistent in the story. While it is true that many of the central storyline and conflicts are focused on and then quickly (within 6 or so hours) resolved, it is exactly this that makes the season so great. You have to remember that each season of 24 is about 18 hours of footage, that's about 9 movies worth of action and plot in one storyline. You simply have to introduce and resolve major plotlines repeatedly, otherwise the overall story will seem dull and lackluster. I will admit that one of the twists did leave me feeling cheated, but it only adds to the drama.

And 24 has always been a true drama, reflective of Shakespeare's great tragedies. Both include over-the-top drama and deal with issues such as betrayal, death, and most prominently inter-family relations. Remember the scene from Season 2 between Jack and Kim when Jack is in the airplane? Probably one of the most emotionally powerful scenes in television history, but unfortunately Season 2 didn't have another knockout scene like that. Season 3, however, is full of outstanding performances and dialogue like that. If you don't at least come close to crying at least 5 times in this season, you're a liar.

If you never really liked a particular character in the previous 2 seasons, I guarantee your opinion will be turned around with season 3. Paul Schulze and Penny Johnson Jerald (played as Ryan Chapelle and Sherry Palmer, respectively) give absolutely mind numbing performances here. And these great performances are only facilitated by the superb writing in this season. Not only is the dialogue razor sharp, but the questions that arise from each character's actions are truly amazing. Questions like is it worth it to kill one man to save thousands, do the ends justify the means, etc. All questions that Season 1 or 2 have handled before, but Season 3 truly takes these issues and hurtles the drama full speed in your face.

It is my opinion that Season 3 is far and away the best season in the 24 series so far. You will not find the kind of amazing writing and jaw-dropping performances more consistently in any other season.",1141948800,7,2850,4.656063618290259

There was just too much stuff that happened that even I, not the most intelligent person, thought was silly.  Too much stuff that anyone with any amount of common sense knows would never ever realistically happen.  Season 4 is the best, followed by 1,2 and 3 in that order.  But that is like saying finding a $100 bill is better than finding a $50 or $20 bill.  They all rock, just to different degrees.  Watch them all.",1139875200,2,694,4.212121212121212
2144769,5,B0002XVQSU,"Maybe I'm the only one who waits until the autumn (or winter) to see the latest season of 24 rather than trying to catch it every week. But ever since Fox fell into releasing recently broadcast television seasons immediately on disc, it makes a lot more sense to do it this way, even with TiVO. With a show like 24, that approach makes even more sense. What other show out there can boast that one entire season is one complete story?

And what a story it is. As the third worst day of Jack Bauer's life begins, he's struggling with a drug habit he picked up as part of his deep cover mission to bring a drug lord with terrorist connections, Ramn Salazar, to justice. He's just found out his daughter Kim has been secretly dating his partner Chase, a man just as devoted to his work as Jack is. And Salazar's brother Hector has just had delivered a body infected with a deadly virus which he threatens to release in L.A. if his brother is not released immediately.

As with previous seasons of 24, this plot soon transmogrifies into something slightly different, and by the time the day ends, the deadline to a different sort of threat is approaching. Unlike previous seasons, this one retains far more of its original threat through to the very end. Also, in seasons one and two, storylines were left hanging in the air, and plot contrivances too farfetched to go anywhere abounded (spontaneous amnesia, anyone?). Season three has far less of these difficulties, while it also continues the 24 tradition of making sure the audience knows that no one, repeat, no one is safe. Jack Bauer doesn't die this time, but a few hairy moments make you wonder if that's what's going to happen - and meanwhile, some people you'd never expect to die do exactly that. I'd tell you who, but if you haven't seen this season yet, then you're in for something good. Make sure you have a comfortable chair, lots of snacks, and a full day to kill. You'd need all three (plus a strong bladder) to enjoy this properly.

Once the ""day"" is over, there's all the commentaries (full of spoilers, and some of these just aren't that interesting to listen to) as well as a seventh disc full of bonus material. While the ""24: On The Loose"" minidoc isn't as lengthy as last year's season finale behind-the-scenes featurette, there's at least far less of director-producer Jon Cassar's bitching and whining to endure. The ""Biothreat: Beyond the Series"" documentary is downright scary, while the ""Boys and Their Toys"" special effects featurette is pure popcorn. The best bits, however, are the season four teaser and promo. A rarity for 24, the teaser is a six-and-a-half minute mini-film taking place three months after the events of day three and a few hours before day four begins. Not only does it provide some much needed backstory for the upcoming season, it results in the fantastically unbroadcastable Jack Bauer line, ""I can find my own f*ckin' job, Erin."" Call me juvenile, but that alone is worth the seventy euro/dollars!",1139788800,4,3001,4.701520912547529
2144770,5,B0002XVQSU,"""24"" is the most riveting, amped show on television. I'm not someone who follows TV series normally, but this one has gotten to me unlike anything I can remember. I've now watched the first four seasons, and Season 3 is terrific. The traversal of characters and situations is complex and deftly accomplished, and the dramatic tension is relentless yet never monotonous. Beware, there are situations here that can be very upsetting, but the pervasive humanity and the high stakes bring it all together and propel you forward. An amazing show, and another great season.",1139616000,3,567,5.042553191489362
2144771,5,B0002XVQSU,"Season three definitely got off to a slow start.  At one point , episode three, I even considered not finishing it, and just about the time I was ready to quit watching, it began to take hold.  I hung on until episode five and it took off.

This season evolves around a flu-like virus attack.  Jack and company have only a few hours to head off the spread of a disease that will decimate America, and possibly the world.  The plot takes awhile to gel, but eventually prevails.

Two new characters are introduced, Chloe and Chase.  Chloe is a computer specialist and has an extremely irritating personality.  Chase is Kim Bauer's boyfriend and Jack Bauer's partner.  Chase is young, dumb, and makes stupid mistakes, just like his girlfriend.  The combination of Kim, Chloe, and Chase are almost too much, and they cause the plot to creep along.  One of the problems I had watching these three characters was how could they be so stupid and be working for such an important government agency.  After all, it is about believability.  Shades of Bush, I guess.

President Palmer returns, as does his ex-wife, unfortunately.  She is tiring, and it is even more tiring having to watch Palmer have to deal with her.  She gets her much needed due at the end of the season.  Unfortunately, President Palmer's unflagging credibility suffers in the process.

While this season does get off to a slow start, the final six or seven episodes are simply over the top exciting.  The last two episodes will have you on the edge of your seat, and viewers will have a great opportunity to see how ruthless Jack Bauer is.  The climax is riveting, and the accompanying music is perfect.  Whoever orchestrated the music when Jack swings the axe really put some great thought into it.  It's fantastic.

While I was not as satisfied with this season as the second, I was very pleased with it.  The soap opera sub-plots get very tiring, but I guess it's just part of the price.  (We must keep the women viewers viewing, after all.)  I was very sad to see Tony Almeida make his exit; he's a great character to work in opposition to Jack Bauer.

2144774,5,B0002XVQSU,"24 has returned to us fans for a third round of thrills and chills as Jack Bauer comes head on collision with his third worst day of his life.

  It has been three years since the events of Season Two. JACK BAUER (again played by Kiefer Sutherland) has long since returned to CTU and is again working as the head of CTU. TONY ALMEIDA (again played by Carlos Bernard) is sort of assisting Jack in running CTU. MICHELLE DESSLER (again played by Reiko Aylesworth) is still in her usual position at CTU, as well as being married to Tony. But CTU has three new employees since the events of Season Two. First, we have CHLOE O'BRIAN (played by Mary Lynn Rajskub), a computer programmer who is very rude (without trying to be) to her co-workers, but Chloe is a good person deep down inside. The second new employee is...KIM BAUER (again played by Elisha Cuthbert), Jack's beautiful daughter. Jack has gotten Kim the job, for he wants to make sure that she is close to him whenever something out of hand comes up. The third is CHASE EDMUNDS (played by James Badge Dale), who goes out on Field Ops, with Jack by his side, for he is Jack's partner. Chase is even dating Kim.

  The FBI receives a dead body that has been infected with a deadly virus. The FBI informs CTU of the situation, and as it would turn out, CTU and the FBI reveal that the U.S. could be under attack of another deadly terrorist attack. This time, the terrorists are releasing a deadly virus that is extremely fatal.

  Working with CTU on this day's threats is none other than...PRESIDENT DAVID PALMER (again played by Dennis Haysbert). Side by side, David and CTU do all they can to stop this deadly virus from escaping. In order for Jack to do this right, he has to break a former nemisis out of jail...Ramone Salazaar. Six months ago, Jack had been on assignment, under cover. He had been tracking down Ramone and his brother, Hector, two Druglord Mexicans. In order for Jack to have caught Ramone, he had to become addicted to heroine. But now, after throwing him in jail, Jack has to break him out, since Ramone is connected to today's attacks. He breaks him out, but Ramone has dooped Jack, by kidnapping him in revenge of being betrayed and thrown in Jail.

  Ramone arrives in Mexico with Jack, where Ramone and Hector will be buying the deadly virus. Jack works up his charm as he did six months ago and earns their trust again. But Jack is interested in buying the virus in order to destroy it. As Jack and the Salazaar's head into the building where the virus will be sold to them, Jack is shocked to learn there is another buyer and that mystery buyer is...NINA MYERS (again played by Sarah Clarke). Ramone gets the virus, but Nina had dooped him, where that particular virus vial was rigged with bomb, blowing up both Ramone and Hector. But there are more terrorists involved with this virus. Arriving in Mexico to Jack's rescue is Chase. He and Jack take Nina back to CTU for questioning.

  Jack and Chase arrive at CTU with Nina, where Tony questions Nina, but Nina tries for an attempted suicide, just to make an escape. Since Nina has arrived, Kim has been feeling a severe anger, since Nina is the one who killed Kim's mother. She heads downstairs and finds Nina trying to escape again. With a gun aimed at her, Kim warns Nina to stand back or she'll shoot. But Nina, with her gun, aims right at Kim. Before she could shoot, Jack comes in and shoots Nina in the shoulder. He has Kim head upstairs. He stands over Nina and shoots Nina to death. All I have to say is simply this...DING-DONG! THE B*TCH IS DEAD!

  As Jack tries to handle today's events from his end, David has SHERRY PALMER (again played by Penny Johnson Jerald) come in and help. Mainly because David's biggest campaign advisor, Alan Milikan, is giving David problems, for David's brother, who is there with David, had an affair with Alan's wife Julia. But Sherry really messed up this time, for she intentionly killed Alan screaming at him horribly for his threats against David, which leads him into a fatal heartattack. Hours later, Sherry and her brother-in-law show up at Julia's where Julia shoots Sherry to death and then kills herself.

  Jack and Chase are still on the hunt for the last of the virus vials. They have since settled the terrorists by killing them. They find and destroy each and every vial. Kim and Chase have been dating, as I said earlier, for three months. Jack, at first, had been enraged, but has come to approve and accept that. Tony's life has now been drastically altered, for during this ordeal, he had committed treason. Michelle had been kidnapped, which led Tony into saving his wife, while risking the lives of millions of innocent American people. But the ordeal of today's events has been successfully settled one again by Jack Bauer, along with the help of Michelle, Tony (considering his act of treason), Chloe, Chase, and Kim, while David reveals to Jack, his one true friend, that this term of his Presidency will be his one and only term.

WHOA! This season had me on the edge of my seat way more than the first two seasons had. I'm just glad that Sherry and Nina had got what those two b*tches had coming to them, with Jack, once again, saving the day. This is season is awaiting your buy.

2144775,5,B0002XVQSU,"Season 3 of suspense thriller 24 served up the most suspenseful and most emotional season of the show to date.

Set three years after season 2, Jack Bauer (Keifer Sutherland) is working with a partner named Chase (James Badge Dale).  Jack's daughter Kim (Elisha Cuthbert) is also working for the LA branch of CTU (Counter Terrorism Unit).  President Palmer (Dennis Haysbert), meanwhile, is running for reelection.

This particular bad day starts at 1 PM, when Jack learns of plan to release a virus unless a criminal he just spent six months trying to arrest is freed.  This leads to a chain reaction of events trying to get a hold of the virus before it is released into the population which includes hunting down drug dealers, a prison riot, a trip to Mexico, and time in a high rise hotel.  The terrorists seem to be one step ahead of Jack and CTU the entire time.

President Palmer, meanwhile, is facing tough rumors again, this time targeting his doctor and new girlfriend.  But that's nothing compared to what happens when his main backer demands that Palmer fire his chief of staff, who also happens to be his brother (D. B. Woodside).

To me this is the best season to date.  The first few hours are a bit scattered, but things come into focus much earlier then previous seasons and once the story gets going, it stays strong.  While there are still a couple soap opera plots, they are kept to a minimum this year.  The biggest improvement is Kim's storyline.  Since she's working at CTU, we don't get any crazy storylines with her, but things that actually move forward the main story.  And the second half of the season gets really intense.  The early morning hours especially are emotionally hard to get through.  But the episodes where things don't work out are what make this show so wonderful.

Fox again has released a wonderful season set for the show.  All 24 episodes are presented on six discs in wide screen and surround sound audio.  There are a total of 45 deleted scenes scattered over the six discs and each disc has one audio commentary from various members of the cast and crew.  The seventh disc in this set is devoted solely to extras.  The 45 deleted scenes are collected in one place, this time with optional commentary by the producers.  In edition, there are special features on the gadgets of the show and the reality of a biothreat.  Finally, there are a couple teasers and mini-scenes that bridge the gap betweens season 3 and 4.

While I am addicted to several serialized shows, this is by far the most addictive of the lot.  Plan plenty of time to watch this season because once you start, you won't want to stop.",1132617600,17,2650,4.611111111111111
2144776,5,B0002XVQSU,"How many bad days can one man have?  That was what many were wondering when the 3rd series of classic drama 24 was announced.  Would the format tire?  The answer is emphatically no, it is another classic series.

3 years on from the 2nd series and Jack is now a heroin junkie (all in the course of duty), it is scarcely believable but as the plot advances the reasons become clear.  The early episodes of this series are great, you are lead to believe again that Jack has lost the plot as he seemingly goes on a tirade of law breaking, but as always Jack has his reasons.  Another fantastic episode happens around half way through the series when Jack apparently eliminates the terrorist threat, only for the true enemy to surface.  It may no longer be original but it is exciting TV and the twists and turns keep coming.  You are left in suspense until the final episode, where there is another great, though more predictable ending.  The best storyline however involves Ryan Chapelle, anyone who has watched will know what I am talking about, I won't spoil it for the rest of you, but it is a surprising turn in the plot.

Series 3 is essentially more of the same, if like me you loved the first 2 series you will love this.  Anyone who hasn't seen it before I would advise to watch the series in order as everything makes more sense then, but this is again unmissable drama.",1130803200,2,1377,4.424603174603175
2144777,5,B0002XVQSU,"'24' Season Three is a tense-filled, adrenaline-fueled thrill ride that is better than its second season, which saw Jack Bauer (Keifer Sutherland) preventing a nuclear bomb from being set off in Los Angeles. In this season of '24', Jack is dealing with a biological threat and is the head of field operations at CTU, where his protege Chase Edmunds (James Badge Dale) is having a secret relationship with Kim Bauer (Elisha Cuthbert), who went through unnecessary suspense in the previous season. Tony Almeida (Carlos Bernard) and Michelle Dessler (Reiko Alyesworth) are married, President David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert) has a new love interest and a brother working for him, and new characters Chloe and Gael are introduced.

I can't give you more than a basic plotline without spoiling the surprises and shocking twists this season churns up, so here are the highlights:

1) The main plot involving the biological threat is always exciting and produces some of the most suspenseful and tense episodes in '24' history.

2) The unpredictability factor of '24' reaches new heights this season with the deaths of a few major characters. Perhaps the most unsettling moment in '24' history occurs in this season when Jack has to choose whether or not to sacrifice someone he works with in order to save millions of lives. The scene plays out unexpectedly and is nothing short of riveting.

3) Sherry Palmer (Penny Johnson Jerald) and Nina Myers (Sarah Clarke), fantastic villainesses from seasons one and two return to play a part in the day's events. Their character arcs are never dull and give some episodes a powerful edge.

4) The acting is terrific in this season. Keifer Sutherland does a fine job at keeping Jack Bauer as a man on edge personally and professionally. James Badge Dale does an excellent job as the calm and collected Chase, offering the perfect counterpoint to Jack's anything goes way of dealing with terrorists. The best acting of the season is done by Reiko Alyesworth. Her work in the midseason episodes is brilliant and shows the complexities of her character when she is faced with life or death situations. Alyesworth's work was definitely deserving of an Emmy nod, but she never received one.

5) The last episode of the season is very exciting and ends in an unexpected way. It is a very personal ending, one which the audience will appreciate after taking into account what has gone before in the character's life.

6)The quality of the sound and picture is terrific. The action sequences look very well-done and polished.

'24' Season Three is better than season two and almost matches the powerful first season, in that the biological threat plot goes on the entire 24 hours, never letting up. What makes Season Three weaker than season one is that the main plot takes about four episodes to really start, due to many subplots which slow down the pacing of the story. Those flaws aside, '24' Season Three is one heck of a roller-coaster ride, providing the viewer with a most twisted plot that only the writers of '24' could devise.",1130371200,7,3062,4.909090909090909
2144778,4,B0002XVQSU,"I was looking forward to seeing how Mia Kirshner was going to play into the third season.  She was the one at the end of season two who made the very clever attack on the president.  The last scene in season two had just a quick view of her attack, but then in season three there was nothing connected

to it at all.  It was a story they just left hanging, and that's a damn shame because Mia would have made a damn good terrorist.  This season did do what they do best though and kept the action tweaked so that you're always wanting to catch the next episode.  Personally I'm too impatient to

wait from week to week so I don't watch the series until it becomes available on DVD.

The primary story line was a bit too scattered.  There were too many back stories going on to make this as compelling as the first two seasons.  I had read they were going to start season four with a mostly new cast.....When they give someone the axe they sure make sure it's forever.  Several of the people who were in the first two get permently removed with no chance of resurrecting.

The writers and/or directors seemed to stretch the envelope a bit too far at times.  One of the things that irritated me was how everyone at CTU became like a bunch of grade school tattlers.  The worse of these were Kim Bower and Chloe.  The first time or two I could understand it, but after a while of snooping in everyones business (Especially as a relitively new member on the inside) Kim really started to come across as the kind of busy body that would piss most every one off, and thus be shut out of the loop.  Chloe wasn't quite as snoopy, but wasn't anyone who others would trust very far.  My point is that even in a work place like the CTU there has to be some comaradrie between the employees that would keep some of those items at a more personal confrontation rather than running

to the supervisor to snitch.  That's just not realistic.....And what was with all the suspicious looks everyone gave each other this season?  That just got strange after a while..

One other item that's a personal irritation:  Why in 24 does Jack and Tony always seem to talk in sort of a whisper except when they're yelling at someone?  When they talk on the interviews in the features area they don't talk in that whisper at all.  It would be one thing if they talked that way when they were discussing something sensitive, but they just talk that way all the time.  There's other such little irritations, but I'm sure when making 24 episodes there's not a lot of time to iron out all the ruffles....",1130284800,,2570,4.36

2144780,5,B0002XVQSU,"Truly the most significant disadvantage of DVDed TV series is the fact that, with a weekend ahead of you, you can watch the whole thing from beginning to gripping end. Great stuff from the 24 guys again. Left me champing at the bit for 24 #4.",1127692800,,242,4.282608695652174
2144781,5,B0002XVQSU,"Set your watches, hark ye the cuckoo clock, for something bad and cliffhanger-ish doth happen at the 59th minute of every hour.

You'd think the characters of 24 would've cottoned-on by now to the remarkable synchronicity in their lives. Nothing happens by chance in the gritty, increasingly overblown universe they inhabit - if something's going to go wrong (and you can bet that it will), chances are it'll happen but a whisker before that bleeping digital clock marks the hour.

Such is the beauty of this show. On 24's watch, a whole years' worth of excitement is crammed into a single day - and, dammit, we'd feel shortchanged if it were any other way. But, after Season Two's vertigo-inducing rush through Islamic terrorism, nuclear bomb blasts and what-have-you, the latest installment threatens to offer little but diminishing returns.

After a slightly humdrum opening flourish, though, Season Three turns out to be a bit of a humdinger. Those who grumbled through the weaker moments of the preceding series - Kim's meandering escape-the-psycho road trip, Sarah Wynter's bland turn as Kate Warner, the revolving cast of ever-more-inept baddies, etc. - will be relieved to find that a lot of the chaff has been excised this time around. The path towards Season Three's denouement may be no less gnarly than the ones 24 has trodden before, but it's less given to pointless detours and... sorry, awfully mixed metaphor there, but you get the point.

Anyhoo: there's lots to recommend. Kiefer Sutherland is never less than utterly compelling as the gruff, increasingly haggard Jack Bauer, and he's given plenty to chew on this time around (his final scene, in particular, should melt even the hardest of hearts). Mind you, he's got some worthy foils to contend with, too: Sarah Clarke is back again as Nina Myers, but she's all but blown off the screen by Joaquim de Almeida's screen-chewing turn as Mexican druglord Ramon Salazar, not to mention charismatic Brit badboy Paul Blackthorne as agent-gone-bad Stephen Saunders.

Elsewhere, we get all the political shenanigans and snatched-from-the-jaws-of-hope plot twists you'd expect - many of them surprisingly vicious (suffice to say that the roster of regular characters has diminished significantly by the end). The producers clearly had a lot more money to play with, too: some of Season Three's action scenes rival anything your average Hollywood flick could throw up.

It is, of course, not without its failings. As David Palmer, Dennis Haybert has to shoulder the burden of some pretty implausible plot devices, and - it must be said - doesn't do it particularly well. More tellingly, a fair amount of (you'd think) pretty important baggage is shed willy-nilly by the screenwriters along the way - anyone who gets to episode 24 with but the foggiest recollection of the first one might find themselves wondering how the hell anyone is still standing, let alone performing at 100%.

But, well, that's just 24 innit?",1125619200,2,2976,5.086065573770492

For seasons 1 and 2 I amlost always felt like I just HAD to watch the next epsidoe.  I didn't really feel that for this season.  I mean, its worth watching, but I just didn't find it as exciting.  The story definitly takes some time to get interesting, whereas last year Kim's babysitter job at least had me hooked from the first episode.  I didn't really get hooked on this season till halfway, but then I felt that some of the decisions made by important characters was a little riduclous.  Personally I feel that the President acted way out of character this season (SPOILER AHEAD).  When he said we need to get dirty...and calls Sherri to do his dirty work, I thought it was ridiulous.  I like seeing Sherri in the show and I enjoy seeing how she works, but I thought it was a bad excuse to get her in this season.

2144789,4,B0002XVQSU,"Mystified by my title? Let me explain...

I was rather surprised by how much I liked Season 3 of ""24."" After hearing a lot of negative things about this season---how meandering its first half is, how unbelievable some of its twists are, how silly some of its subplots are, etc.---I was expecting to find Season 3 a disappointment. This was not the case; in fact, if anything, I think, in spite of all its faults, this could be almost as good a season as Season 2 (still probably the best of the four).

But first, the bad points. Yes, this season is not as confidently plotted and paced as Season 2. The problem with the first half of Season 3 isn't that it's slow---I prefer to think of it as more plot- and drama-oriented than merely ""slow."" It's that, as the events unfold over Day 3, the prison break and the excursion into Mexico both turn out to be negated by plot twists that are, frankly, a little too incredible. Instead of being genuinely surprising, as most of the twists of Seasons 1 and 2 were, some of the twists of Season 3 seemed hollow, twists for the sake of being...well, twisty. And yes, some of the subplots are a little silly: the subplot with Chloe O'Brian's (Mary Lynn Rajskub) baby, for instance, strikes me as little more than time-filling (although, I suppose, it is good for a laugh or two).

And yet, as uneven as Season 3 is, there is at least one positive constant that makes this season, for me, valuable: Jack Bauer. If Season 2 displayed a slightly darker, more ruthless Jack Bauer, Season 3 takes the character even further, and raises even more questions about our favorite antihero. In the beginning of the season, Bauer has recently completed an undercover assignment, getting druglord Ramon Salazar (Joaquin de Almeida) into prison, but at a cost: he got hooked on heroin, and on Day 3 he is trying very hard to quit and focus on his job. The personal cost of Jack Bauer's job comes into sharp relief in Season 3; it's ultimately what this season is really about. That's why the final scene of this third season---a simple scene in which Jack sits in a car and releases his anguish----is so moving. Jack Bauer may be willing to do anything for his job---even kill an important figure from CTU (although, to be fair, he was forced to do so)---but, underneath his near-psychotic intensity is his humanity. It's what makes the character of Jack Bauer one of the more complex action heroes in recent years, I think.

Kiefer Sutherland embodies all the contradictions of this character to near-perfection. People who acclaim him for his ""intensity""---as maybe I have in previous reviews, admittedly---may be missing how nuanced and believably human he is in his characterization. Sutherland does not always play Jack Bauer for maximum appeal---he isn't always likable---but somehow he makes him a compelling, convincing figure nevertheless, with moments of real fear, desperation, and sadness puncturing the cold, intensely focused agent outside. There's a reason why, despite all of Jack Bauer's faults, people still continue to watch the character on ""24"": Sutherland never forgets the human being underneath the action-hero exterior.

There is really not much left to say about this surprisingly decent third season of ""24,"" except to say that this one is about a deadly virus and the threat of biological warfare. It's perhaps also, more than ever, about the divide between politics and personal morality, as President David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert) is forced to make some hard moral choices in the course of this particular day in his reelection campaign. The Palmer subplots have also been widely derided, but I still think they, as a whole, make a strong statement about how sometimes you can't always be true to your personal morals and convictions in the world of politics. Even though President Palmer has earned a reputation for honesty and uprightness in the past, he is severely tested in Day 3 as he is forced to deal with potential scandals and such.

Overall, though, Season 3 is notable for being the season of Jack: a season which explored the character of Jack Bauer further and deeper than any of the previous two seasons. It once again emphasizes one of the strengths of ""24"": it's an action-thriller series with a real soul. You might have to put up with meandering plotting, uneven pacing, and some disturbing lapses in credibility to get to the good stuff, but I think the rewards are worth it. Recommended.",1123891200,4,4465,4.814863102998697
2144790,3,B0002XVQSU,"As a HUGE fan of Season One and Two, I have to say Season Three left me disappointed. YES there are great moments and cliffhangers, and YES some characters finally came out swinging (Michelle esp.), but as I watched, I kept asking myself, ""would the CTU of Season One ever allow this to happen?"" What I LOVED about the first season was how smart and tightly wound the team was. The least little misstep in protocol was vehemently scrutinized by everyone. There was a sense that this was the best of the best...a top notch agency with brilliant minds and strategists at every turn.

Now, we have Kim Bauer working at CTU? WTF? I mean, a few years ago she was a pouty teenaged brat partying with losers. And now she's working the computer system like a pro? Sitting in on most of the important meetings and even field ops?

Since when did inter-office sniping become the norm at CTU? Someone gives an order, and the answer is, ""look...I'm working as fast as I can"", or ""you yelling at me doesn't help"". This happens about fifty times throughout the season. Again...WTF? This is CTU, not the DMV for crissakes.

Chloe. I guess she was supposed to be the ""humor"" point, but, again...in Season One, the team would have canned her so fast.

It all just makes the CTU team mediocre and not as cool and heroic as they used to be. The finest intelligence operation in the country should NOT remind viewers of their own offices and coworkers.

The President Palmer storyline was ridiculous. By the end, I hoped he would go down, I disliked him so much. And he was, up until this seaason, one of the strongest characters of integrity on television. They messed him up with a sub-par set of stupid circumstances. Dang.

I really hope Season 4 will return to a smart, slick suspense format, and stay away from the silly soap opera antics of Season three.",1123459200,45,1841,4.546827794561934

2144792,5,B0002XVQSU,"24, arguably the best show currently on television, has incredibly managed to be stunningly good four seasons in a row. The series' third season is usually considered to be the weakest, but still possesses the the series staples of blistering action, riveting characters, and stunning twists, while maintaining a unique flavor all its own.

The season starts with Jack Bauer (the amazing Kiefer Sutherland) working for the government again, about to work out a deal with a vicious drug lord that he helped put in jail. The drug lord's equally vicious brother, however, obtains a deadly virus that he threatens to release unless his demands are met. As always, it falls on Jack and his fellow counter-terrorist agents to save the country from disaster.

Season one's strength was intensity, season two's was action, and season three's is plot. We are quickly introduced to several new characters, such as Jack's young but ruthless new partner, and Chloe, the giddily annoying computer analyst. Old favorites have had new developments; Tony and Michelle are now married and in charge of CTU, and President Palmer is still alive, though at times not so well. Most notably, Jack's daughter Kim now works for CTU, and luckily stays clear of her previous crazy misadventures.

It isn't long before the plot goes in unexpected directions, important characters die in sudden and terrible ways, and all races up to a shocking climax in a terrifying place. Season three contains what is easily the biggest twist in the series, and certainly one of the most wince inducing moments towards the end. Fans of the hard edge that easily tops anything else on TV won't be disappointed.

Season three isn't without its flaws. Certain plot lines get dropped a bit too easily, and wrapping your mind around a few of the decisions made is like working an advanced calculus equasion without a calculator.  However, even if it is the weakest season of the series, it is still light years ahead of 99% of the rest of shows ever put on TV. It isn't a good place for 24 fans that are just starting out, but for those who have already spent a day or two with Jack Bauer, you can't go wrong with this set.",1122595200,2,2177,4.794666666666667
2144793,5,B0002XVQSU,"How I started watching 24 is a strange story. In its first 3 seasons, I always knew of it, but never watched it. After watching a few (probably 3) minutes of the first season, I wasn't impressed and for no reason decided never to watch the show. It's pretty obvious that I never gave it a chance (and somehow people do this all the time). So years later when Season 4 premiered, I happened to be in my room on my computer with the TV on fox (only because Seinfeld just went off). I can honestly say the only reason I didn't change the channel, or simply turn the TV off was because I couldn't bear the 10 ft walk without my remote. As the show progressed, I found my self more and more engrossed till the point where I couldn't walk away for the next two hours. As the show ended, I was shocked to find how entertaining it was. Like most people, the most thrilling show I had seen till then was Law & Order (no offense). I soon went to Amazon to find that the first season was available for 25$ and I quickly purchased it. Thinking back, that was most definitely the best investment I've ever made in a DVD. 25$ for 18+ hrs of sheer entertainment, there's no doubt. I was able to buy and watch the first 3 seasons in less than two weeks, sad to some but fun for me.

Like my description of Season 4, season 3 simply to put it is enthralling.  And what amazes me most is that after two seasons (36+ hrs), the writers of this show are still able to piece together PLAUSIBLE plots with a solid balance between drama and action.  This DVD is definitely worth the money and my advice is to clear your schedule and buy it.",1122163200,,1616,4.173076923076923

2144795,5,B0002XVQSU,"After two highly successful seasons, many looked for the third season of Fox's ""24"", to be the weakest for one of the best dramas on television.  As, yet again, Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) must save the day from another terrorist plot.  But as the clock began ticking on yet another bad day for Jack, it was clear this season was much different from the previous two, and would clearly show that this show still has plenty of life left in it.

""24: Season Three"" finds Jack Bauer working full-time at CTU along with daughter Kim (Elisha Cuthbert), and things seem to be going Jack's way for once.  However, it is quickly discovered that all is not as it seems, Jack is now addicted to heroin from months of being undercover with a South American drug kingpin, whom he eventually imprisoned.  As Jack tries to overcome his addiction, his daughter is dating his new partner, Chase, and to top things off the brother of the drug kingpin is threatening to release a highly contagious virus into L.A. if his brother is not released from prison.  As if life couldn't get worse for Jack, President David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert) is in town for a debate during his campaign for re-election.  The twists and turns are more present than ever in Fox's most explosive drama, as Jack and the rest of CTU rush to stop the virus from being released.

Incredible acting, storytelling, and attention to detail make ""24"" one of the best shows on television today and possibly one of the best dramas of all time.  Continuing to use it's famed real-time format, and sticking with the same cast would seem to doom most shows that deal with similar material, simply if for no other reason than that audiences wouldn't want to keep coming back to see the same hero save the same city from a different form of terrorist threat.  Obviously, this is not the case, as ""24: Season Three"" continued the solid ratings the previous seasons enjoyed.

""24"" as I've said already in this review and in my reviews for the previous 2 seasons, is an outstanding show that continues to better itself, not only every season, but every week.  ""24: Season Three"" is highly recommended, you will not be disappointed.",1120435200,2,2176,4.68241469816273

2144799,2,B0002XVQSU,"[NO spoilers]

I have to say I watched season one, six hours at a time.  I probably didn't sleep a couple of nights staying until the morning.  The idea was brilliant, one hour, real-time, multiple screens, multiple plots converging.  OK, that daughter of Bauer wouldn't just stay put as her father said, but what can you do ...

The ending also was different than the obvious, and I appreciated the effort to suprise the viewer.

Season two didn't seem right.  The plot seemed weak, but something from season one propelled me ahead.  I do have to tell you though that I am watching season three out of misplaced sense of ... duty to finish it up. (In between I watched two superb seasons of ""The Wire"" (HBO), and season 3 of ""The Shield"" (FOX), excellent as well.  I am half way through, so unless something spectacular about the show happens, I must say I am very disappointed.  Unfortunately I cannot see how ...

In it's not so much about the plot and the sudden turns. That also becomes somehow predictable. The secret, I think, a good story depends a lot on the capacity contain enough true elements that we can relate to, so that the ""unreal"" ones become possible. Not the case here.  So may things seem impossible. For example the decision-making in the White House.  We read newspapers, we watch the news, we even watch other movies to have a general sense on how a Presidency works, and how it couldn't.  I have no problem having a President developing an unprecedented relationship to an agent so that they are calling each other on the phone more than I call my best friends, but there is no way on earth that decisions on serious matters like - I am using an unrelated example to the story - a hijacking of a plane that include foreign dignitaries held for ransom money is decided between a President, his brother and his ex-wife (who mind you repeatedly and over and again convinced us that is worthy of no trust).  As you watch the movie you go ""come on..."" way too often.  And that's just one example of many.

The characters are thin.  They exhibit no real emotion.  Death, sickness, loss, threat, sacrifice, heroism, treason, all exist, but there is nothing under the surface.

I was a big fan of `24' in the beginning, but if you haven't bought any of the series, I would say go and buy season one and leave it there.  It was a stroke of brilliance that was followed by mediocrity, despite all efforts.",1115856000,9,2421,4.519540229885058
2144800,5,B0002XVQSU,"24 has become one of my favorite shows becuase of its tight, fast-paced, edge-of-the-seat action and suspense. It's a race to the finish through twists and turns which leave you breathless, exhausted, and at the end, strangely satisfied.

In season 3, two evil, world-class villainesses, Sherry Palmer (President's ex-wife) and Nina Myers (Jack's ex-girlfriend/colleague) reappear full of venom and mischief. They really are forces to contend with.

24/3 is all about action and relationships. This season is a showcase for Tony and Michelle's love and marriage, Chase and Kim finding themselves, and President and Mrs. Palmer using each other again, and President Palmer working things out with his brother Wayne. We are also introduced to the eccentric Chloe who is terrific; if quirky beyond repair. Finally, the boss we love to hate, Ryan Chappelle, leaves us stunned and sad with a wrenching story line. Only the writers of 24 could make me sympathetic to Ryan Chappelle.

All in all, the season ends in a satisfying way - wrung out emotionally, exhausted from the frenetic pace, and anxious to see 24/4.",1114128000,4,1109,5.15
2144801,5,B0002XVQSU,"First airing in November 2001, 24 quickly established itself as one of the best television series around and solidified itself as a cult classic icon. Utilizing a novel premise, each season of 24 comprises a single day in lives of its characters, with each of the 24 episodes representing a one-hour time segment of that day. Kiefer Sutherland stars in the imminent role of Jack Bauer, a government agent periodically faced with enormous challenges within a single day. Each season is reminiscent of a fast-paced Hollywood action thriller, but it's only a busy day in the life of the heroic Bauer...

Season 3 begins almost three years after Jack's successful thwarting of a terrorist conspiracy to nuke Los Angeles. An extremely powerful drug kingpin, Ramon Salazar, has recently been captured and imprisoned due to Jack's efforts, but the Salazar case is far from over. Ramon's brother contacts federal authorities and threatens to release a deadly virus on the American public unless his brother is immediately freed. Yet again, Jack is tasked with hunting down the terrorists in a 24 hour timeframe... Will he succeed? Or will innocent people die in mass?

The 24 (Season 3) DVD features a number of breathtaking episodes including the season premiere in which a dead body is tossed just outside of a healthcare facility in Los Angeles. The Counter Terrorism Unit quickly learns that the body is infected with a deadly virus, a blatant signal of blackmail when the unit learns of a threat to release the virus at large unless drug lord Ramon Salazar is let out of prison. Meanwhile, President Palmer is preparing a presidential debate in the company of his brother (also his chief-of-staff) and his doctor (also his girlfriend), and Kim who now works at CTU with Jack has secretly been dating her father's partner, Chase Edmunds... Other notable episodes from Season 3 include (#53) in which Jack is taken hostage in an inmate riot while trying to break Ramon out of prison, and (#71) in which Jack is on the verge of discovering the location of the deadly vials...

2144802,5,B0002XVQSU,"Season 3 starts off rather slowly, so one might not be that enthusiastic about watching the first few episodes at a stretch. But proceed beyond 6 episodes and watch the drama unfold with alarming alacrity and suspense! The script is great (as usual), the acting immaculate, the timing precise and the plot, though having a few glitches, immersive and wholly absorbing.

Kim's very own storyline may be irksome, and it's just not fair if people call her annoying; I mean, it's not her fault that she keeps recurring her role in sub-standard sub-plots! At least there are no cougars roaming anywhere on the set. Personally, the number of demands needed to be narrowed down to 2. I mean, the ""sky is falling"" thingy truly annoyed the heck out of me. And that social escort? Her relevance was absolutely temporary and insignificant to be wasting valuable on-screen time. Oh, and it gets weirdly melodramatic sometimes, even in mid-conversation. That's something they have to resolve separately, not while simultaneously trying to track down terrorists. The disconnect is obvious and awkward, to say the least. Character development is top-notch, though; can't say the same for the relationship between Jack and Kim.

Those who criticise the third season as less than what they would have expected after 3 seasons should ask themselves this: after 24 blazed the pioneering path to real-time drama, did anything in its genre even come close to challenging it for supremacy? The unarguable truth is NO. This show, however flawed, is truly in a league of its own.",1113696000,,1555,5.023255813953488

2144804,5,B0002XVQSU,"Seasons one and two of 24 began with a bang, and you were hooked from the start. Season 3, while a great season, does not manage to hook you from the first episode. Sure, there is an interesting surprise about Jack's activities over the past year at the end of the first episode, but overall something seems missing.

Fear not. This is 24. And good things come to those who wait.

Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) is back at CTU, now head of field operations. It's been roughly three years since terrorists attempted to detonate a nuclear bomb on US soil, and Jack has spent the last year undercover with a group of drug dealing brothers- the Salazars. Jack has managed to take one of them, Ramon Salazar, to prison but it soon becomes apparent that Hector Salazar might have some leverage that could lead to his brother's release- a deadly virus that he could release upon Los Angeles.

Jack and partner Chase Edmunds (James Badge Dale) soon find themselves caught up in a struggle to stop the release of this virus. Also returning to the fold are CTU director Tony Almeida (Carlos Bernard) and his now-wife Michelle Dessler (Reiko Aylesworth). Jack's daughter Kim (Elisha Cuthbert) has spent the last few years finding ways to make herself less useless and is now employed at CTU under Tony and Michelle. Meanwhile, President David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert) faces his own troubles when it appears his opponent in the Presidential race has dirt on his new girlfriend.

While this may seem like a lot of spoilers, I assure you, this is nothing. Anyone who has seen Seasons One and Two of 24 (and if you haven't, I suggest you start with those as this is a series meant to be viewed from the start) knows that 24 is a series jam-packed with action and the plot will take many twists and turns.

Kim is still annoying in this season, but at least she is annoying in a less distracting capacity as she is directly involved in the main plot of the season this time around. The initial story involving President Palmer is not nearly as interesting as last season's conspiracy against him but that story will pick up considerably, especially when Sherry Palmer (Penny Johnson Jerald) returns midseason. Also returning is 24's other favorite villainess Nina Myers (Sarah Clarke). Also, I feel it necessary to inform you: this season has no amnesia, and no cougar. You can all sigh in relief now.

The DVD also has great bonus features. In fact, there's an extra disc worth of features. Most notable is a brief prelude to season 4's events that you can't see anywhere else.",1111190400,2,2562,4.682222222222222
2144805,4,B0002XVQSU,"I loved first two seasons of ""24"". The third season has many attributes that were so good there, such as acting (Kiefer Sutherland is just great), suspense, etc. At the same time I found this time that the action is a little bit slower, especially in the first few episodes, and the plot is dilluted somewhat by less interesting developments (in particular, I am tied of the president' evil wife). The plot also often lacks credibility. It was the case even in the first two seasons (and it would be difficult to expect anything else when authors had to pack a lot of twists and turns into 24 hour period) but this time they are more obvious. But even given all these shortcomings the third season is still the great entertainment.",1110931200,,731,4.587786259541985

This is the producers and writers trade mark: doing what other movies and television series won't, not glamorizing the action to make a fairytale picture perfect ending.  Rent it, buy it, whatever, just be sure to watch it.",1110672000,2,511,4.462365591397849

Kiefer Sutherland, once again, puts on an awesome performance.  Having gone through all of the seasons, Jack is like a member of the family, and you can tell the emotions he's going through as he lives through the days in these seasons.  Kiefer is the man, pure and simple.  Carlos Bernard as Tony, great in the first two seasons also, is really great in this season.  Tony goes through a lot, and Carlos flawlessly exhibits all of the emotions Tony goes through without missing a beat.

2144809,4,B0002XVQSU,"While some of the threats faced by CTU, Jack Bauer and his daughter Kim during the second season might have seemed hokey, it added a soap opera quality that enlivened the series a bit considering the glum situations they faced. With nuclear devices out of the way and assassination already addressed, this time Jack, Kim (who now works full time at CTU) and CTU face a bioterrorist. Jack infiltrates a drug lord's business operation to try and arrange a deal to purchase the virus in hopes of finding and stopping the terrorist. The only problem is that to convincingly work his way into the organization, Jack became a heroin addict.

While the situations faced in season two might be more mundane (Jack and a drug lord?) the sharp writing makes it all worthwhile to still through the entire run. There's a number of twists and turns that will keep fans guessing as to the final outcome of the series.  Luckily a number of ""24"" regulars return including Jack's nemesis and former lover/co-worker Nina Meyers (Sarah Clarke) and the blunt political black widow former First Lady Sherry Palmer (Penny Johnson Jerald) continues to spin her webs. With a largely new cast working at CTU, it's nice to have some familiar faces and some nasty villains return to keep Bauer from appearing too heroic. Likewise Tony and Michelle return from last season giving a sense of continuity to the series.

Like the previous two sets, Fox has done a very good job in transferring this to DVD. With an anamorphic transfer, the higher resolution looks much better than conventional TV with richer colors, better clarity and solid deep blacks. The crisp, inventive soundtrack also keeps things lively here as well.

 A number of great extras include a  number of behind-the-scenes featurette, deleted scenes and alternate takes. Additionally, we get the original extended version of the premiere episode which is a big plus for fans of the series. ""Boys and Their Toys"" focuses on some of the devices Jack uses to aid his efforts to prevent the destruction of the world. There's also, for the first time, a multi-angle study of one of the action sequences and a discussion (albeit pretty superficial) of the real threat from bioterrorist to the United States and other countries. Finally we get a season four prequel that runs about 6 minutes on disc 7.

We get a number of great commentary tracks on this set. Writer Howard Gordon and actor Kiefer Sutherland provide commentary on the fourth episode on the first disc. Writer and co-executive producer Evan Katz and actress Kyle Singer provide a commentary on the first episode on the second disc and -JOY!- Sarah Clarke and Howard Gordon provide commentary on the the 10pm to 11 pm episode on disc three. There are three other commentary tracks with one on each disc. Additionally, there's also all the deleted scenes with optional commentary as well.

 A winning boxed set for the third season, Fox continues to set the pace with some of the best DVD boxed sets out there. With a total of six commentary tracks, a number of very interesting featurettes and a sneak peak at the fourth season (which premieres in January 2005), season four of ""24"" will be everything that fans will want.",1107820800,5,3217,4.834545454545455
2144810,4,B0002XVQSU,"The second season of this series ended with Jack Bauer (Sutherland) saving the country, but also with President David Palmer (Haysbert) being victim of vicious chemical attack that left him at the edge of death. This season starts three years later with Jack being in the process of obtaining important information about several terrorist groups from one of his prisoners, Rafael Salazar. Jack infiltrated the Salazar cartel, captured Rafael and now is making every effort to get the information he is looking for. But when Salazar is ready to close the deal of giving the information in exchange for a reduced sentence, he decides to kill his lawyer, and all hell breaks lose.

Rafael's brother is in possession of a deadly virus and is threatening to release it across different cities in the US. The virus is supposed to kill at a rapid pace, but it has been altered to kill in...want to guess? 24 Hours! So now, Jack has to find the terrorists before it is too late, because the policy of the US is not to negotiate in this situations and Palmer is not willing to yield. The president is still alive and going through the turmoil of another political campaign. He now has his brother as his right hand but is getting pressure from an important financial supporter to fire him.

The series is still very good and maintains the viewer on the edge of his seat almost at all times. Some aspects of the series however are starting to get old; for example the creators overuse the technique of keeping the suspense level high by interrupting a character that is going to reveal crucial information. Also, some characters keep coming back and getting second and third chances; they also keep going back to similar ploys to the ones they have attempted in the past and that are starting to get repetitive. On top of this, for a series that tries to make the events as believable as possible, they go over the top sometimes. I am not going to mention what some of these things are because I do not want to give away crucial plot elements, but anyone that watches this season will figure these out easily.

There are several things about the series, and this season in particular that I do like though. For example, I love the fact that the series is in real time; this was a novel concept when it started in its first season, but it still provides a special feeling in the third year. I have found though that I cannot watch this series on TV, because the suspense between episodes is too much to wait a whole week to see what happens next. I prefer to wait for the DVD release and watch it in longer batches. The other aspect I really enjoy is that Jack usually has to deal with personal problems that have an effect on the end result. In this case, he has problems with his addiction, which is a result of his undercover operation with the Salazar group. He also has to deal with the fact that his daughter is working in CTU and she is involved with one of the agents there. I think that the way in which the creators present Kim Bauer in this season solved one of the main flaws in the series in the past. In previous seasons she was always getting in trouble, and even after surviving a dangerous situation she would immediately get involved in a tighter one. I found that now she is a more believable character.

In conclusion, even though there are some aspects of the series that some people will probably see as flaws, like the ones I pointed out, I find this a highly enjoyable series. It would be great if they could improve on the aforementioned points for the next season. I am looking forward to it!",1107475200,4,3607,4.5022900763358775

Some scenes would play on a loop until you skipped to the next one manually.  also one of the submenu's on disc 4 came up as black on the screen.  but you are still able to play the episode.  aside from that weirdness it is a must have for any 24 fan.,1105747200,,432,3.808988764044944

The reason being is that much of the shows today seem to insult the viwers intelligence, and as a result I just stopped watching and opened up a great book to read(which isn't a bad thing either). What a breath of fresh air it was to discover this gripping series, known as 24. I can honestly say that I actually think this show's acting, characters and writting are better than alot of movies that are out there today. Thank you to Joel Surnow(the creator) for putting  something creative and interesting on the market.

  As Season 3 begins, we find our Hero Jack Bauer facing another bad and most eventful day. This Day takes place 3 years after the events in Day 2 (Season2). It is difficult to write a review of 24, as much has to do with Spoilers, but I will try and be as vague as possible. Season 3 features some of the best character development. In this season I felt characters were really fleshed out very well and offered the viewer an ability to connect with them on a new level. I also must point out that I would highly reccomend viewing or buying the 1st 2 seasons of 24 before watching this season. You won't really understand Bauer as much and the resentment he has for things and people if you don't start there first.

  I also would like to comment on people who negatively give this a one star rating. I am aware that everyone is entitled to their opinion, but please give this show a chance. With so much junk out there that is infiltrating our televsions, it is refreshing to know that their is a show known as 24, which actually acknowledges intelligent viewers and what they watch. I guarantee you this season is no exception, and once you put your first disc in, good luck trying to stop consciously.

Like I said, it's a great show but it is on Republican TV (Fox) and it depicts terrorists as if they really were sophisticated with CIA type technology and resources. Why? Because as long at American's really believe terrorism is that much of a threat (it's not) then they will continue to be afraid and that is how fascist governments rule their citizens -- with terror. Bush and his cronies will continue to get away with their attack on our freedoms and their imperialistic wars for oil as long as Ameicans believe their terror propaganda.

Enjoy the show, but don't believe ANY of it. The so-called terrorists don't have all those 007 toys and technology. They got lucky once. That's all. If you want something to fear, fear the USA's current administration's war on your rights and their goal of world domination.",1105315200,6,952,4.798780487804878
2144814,5,B0002XVQSU,"Thus reads the back of the boxed DVD set.

Fox's primetime hit series =24= has peaked new heights in edge-of-your-seat storytelling with its third - and best - season. Commercials provide the only pause, the only letup, in this colossally suspenseful terror-trip.

For those who would do so, there is no need to bash it for being less than perfect - nobody could expect absolute flawlessness from 980 minutes of television drama, no matter how refined. I will briefly mention the two foremost problems. (1) That so many events of such large and interrelated significance would take place, all within twenty-four hours, stretches probability way beyond the breaking point. (2) I have had the privilege of working occasionally with a substantial number of Spanish speakers; consequently, I can say that, for the show, the Mexicans should have spoken to and among each other always in Spanish, very nearly never in English (a problem with the Czecks in the first season as well). But the handling of the story is so very good that, understanding and accepting these and other minor flaws, most of us can suspend our disbelief.

Jack is back! - this time to stop terrorists from unleashing a weaponized virus into the American public. The quest to capture it takes him through twists and turns, to a Los Angeles prison, northern Mexico, run-down neighborhoods, a hotel, subway, and an elementary school. This time the threat is biological ... on a virtually unimaginable scale.

Since the series began in the fall of 2001, coinciding, as it would, with the awful tragedy of 9/11, the characters have become quite distinguishable, possessing interesting personalities, and colorful - if in some cases annoying - subtleties. Most of the acting appears quite convincing; as network dramas go, there is minimal contrivance. I shall go quickly through those at CTU and the president's company, first; followed by the terrorists, second. Jack (Kiefer Sutherland) has a secret this time, and he seems genuinely fearful of being exposed. We have a Tony (Carlos Bernard) who, not suprisingly, is down-to-earth, sometimes rigidly so, yet every now and then we see that he carries at his side a sense of compassion. Michelle (Reiko Aylesworth) has married, and though occasionally it doesn't look like she's handling things splendidly at first, we see quite the turnaround later. Kim Baeur works at CTU, not far removed from boyfriend Chase Edmunds, a newbie to the team. Those who like having Kim remain in the series but dislike the idea of her working for CTU should consider the alternative: Kim, on the outside, getting herself into further trouble. We watched this during Season One, then we were thrown the same KIND of thing in Season Two. Chase Edmunds is a tough guy; the more we see of him, the more we think, `Here is a would-be Jack'. Chloe (a quirky, annoying, protocol-wary technician), Adam (efficiency-loving), and Gaiel (cautious, ostensibly a mole) are new sign-ons as well. Finally, getting much more screen time than in Season Two, Regional Director Ryan Chappelle - a no-nonsense, give-it-to-me-straight boss. President David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert) remains the strong moral compass we grew to admire in the first two seasons. But this time, it's not just him dealing with interpersonal problems within his own campaign and the ensuing damage to the outside world. Here we see how he responds to new situations, posed by the competing political party (Republicans, we may say, given Sherry's Season One statement to that effect) toward his own campaign, as opposed to the press and personal staff adversaries of the earlier seasons. And later in the third, we come upon a nasty and inevitable dirty struggle between the president and his much-needed contributor, Alan, who tries to extort him. In the middle is Alan's wife, Julia, not wanting to get involved but eventually forced to. How will David deal with new problems that tempt new compromises, as his steadfast morality goes head to head with the convenience of relativism? Taking Mike's place as chief advisor is his brother Wayne, whose broader philosophy is at least faintly like, however much less devious than, Sherry's. She, too, is back ... with intent more malicious than anything we've seen from her yet.

Now, for the terrorists. In particular, Joaquim de Almeida does a terrific job portraying Ramon Salazar, the initially incarcerated leader of a north Mexican drug cartel. He looks, feels, and smells like a bad guy in every conventional way. His younger brother Hector is believable as a second-man in charge (even if the director should not have cast them as brothers; they don't `look' at all like family). Nina returns, escaping confinement in North Africa, and as we've seen what she is capable of in One and Two, it is not that difficult to imagine. Former CTU mole, conspirator in a domestic nuclear attack, and now buyer of a biological superweapon, Nina is more of a matter-of-fact `bad guy': a cold, sinister, `I-just-enjoy-this'-type killer. Michael Amador is an arms dealer, reserved in nature, and we think we know his intentions .... Alvers is a loyal agent in Stephen Saunders' plan, sent to distribute the virus in L.A. Saunders himself is the worst terrorist - a man with a single weakness - as he sets into motion a diabolical arrangement that more terrible than anything that's come before it. A final note: a teenager named Kyle Singer, while not a terrorist per se, constitutes part of the plan to deliver the package.

Several hours into the season, a drastic plot shift will hit most first-time viewers more or less like a freight train. As in One and Two, perhaps the best reason the bad guys keep falling is, well, they underestimate Jack. Consistently: from Hector to Jack's airplane guard to Ramon to Amador to Alvers and even Saunders. Nina seems to be the only exception ... which makes sense enough, given their past. (Sorry, I can't reveal what happens to her.)

I don't think I've ever seen one other network series attempt what =24= has. It would not be exaggerating, nor employing hyperbole, to say that if enough things went wrong over the course of trying to take and contain the virus, it is entirely possible that the vast majority of the WORLD's population might have perished, probably within several weeks. In no other show have I witnessed TV drama so carefully weave together a tapestry of plot and subplot, push the limits of suspense, raise the stakes as high - with so very, very many lives caught in the balance - or represent so tenacious, so persistent, or so very deadly-serious a counter-terrorist agent as Jack Baeur.

They were getting old.  Will miss President Palmer next season, although his story lines weren't the best this year.  With Tony in jail and Chapelle killed (by Jack), next year will offer almost a totally new cast.  I think this is a good thing and might reinvigorate the series.",1105056000,5,437,4.837837837837838
2144816,4,B0002XVQSU,"""24"" is an intresting show with a great concept. Like many, I would assert that this season was good, but not great. I do apperciate the loaded amount of extra features, this is why I apperciate every penny spent on this dvd set. I often wonder why there was less extra features on the first season release, being it was possibly the best season of the three.

""24"" season three borrows alot of the cliches that made the second season good. It's also truly amazing how the storylines never cease to disappoint me in anyway. I always find myself glued to the television awaiting the next breath breaking scene. The character developments aren't as strong in this season as they tried to be in the first year. THIS IS POSSIBLY THE MAJOR REASON WHY THAT SEASON WAS SO SUCCESSFUL. In someway however, I have to say, this show is alot more entertaining when the action is sped up. Still, it leads a little confusion to me when I see charactors that I can like on scene but never truly understand from the movement of the show.

If you like dvd sets, I have been curious why this set doesn't have a ""play all"" display on its menu. This show is a show that need one of those, if you know what I mean.

All and all, this is a perfect buy along with the other two great season. If you haven't already picked it up, ""24"" is pure entertainment that we will lead you on the edge of your seat for a full twenty four hour marathon.

2144817,4,B0002XVQSU,"Season Three starts off by not finishing the story from seaon two, which I found very disappointing. The cliff hanger at the end of #2 deserved closure.

The story in #3 is solid but we contiune to see some predictable activities. Further some story lines have gotten old and no longer believeable, for example, Sheri Palmer. How many times can she rear her ugly head and still be given an opportunity to have influenece? Not credilbe. We also see several blunders on the part of CTU which is not credible either.

Overall the show was good, but I am starting to lose interest.",1104624000,6,577,4.592233009708738
2144818,4,B0002XVQSU,"Much like Alias, 24 slipped in it's third season (2003-2004). Both set themselves up with a challenging plot line and didn't plan their story arcs out ahead of time. In the commentary for 1 a.m.--2 a.m. in this set, the producer explains that, ""for the third season we were behind on every single episode, stilling writing it while it was in pre-production and even shooting. We just had a vague idea where we were going in the next few episodes.""

This is the root of all the problems; continuity issues, random twists, and a slow first half.

I must say though, the second half is quite good-- and if you ignore a few issues-- contains some of the best episodes of the entire series. Michelle's hotel storyline comes to mind as the best of the season.",1104451200,,753,4.529411764705882
2144819,4,B0002XVQSU,"The third longest day of Jack Bauer's life has all of the elements that make for great television; surprise twists, cliffhangers, action and drama.  But there is a sense of desperation that you get from certain situations this season, as if the writers have painted themselves into corners from which they can't escape without stretching their credibility too far.  Its safe to say that the premise of 24 itself is a stretch with each hour-long episode representing an hour in the day in the life of counter terrorist agent Jack Bauer.  There's no way that all of those things could happen in the span of 24 hours.  Most of the time, its easy not to care, particularly when Kiefer Sutherland does such an excellent job of drawing you into Jack's tortured soul.  But the cracks begin to show in the armor this season and things don't always jell as they should.

Jack Bauer has just put away a ruthless Mexican drug lord, Ramon Salazar, after spending a year under cover with his operation.  Now, Salazar's brother is threatening to release a fast-acting, deadly virus into the general LA population if his brother is not released.  Jack must track down the deadly virus while battling a heroin addiction he picked up during his covert mission with the Salazars.  He also has to contend with a new partner, Chase Edmunds, who is dating his daughter, Kim.  Kim is out of the woods and is now a CTU employee.  Meanwhile, Tony Almeda and Michelle Dessler are married and find themselves forced to choose between their marriage and their duty to their country as the strain of the trying day wears on.  The chase to locate the virus leads from a young boy and his family to a prison riot, a midnight shoot-out in Mexico and another bloody confrontation with Jack's arch nemesis, Nina Myers.  Things finally come to a gruesome head and the show reaches its peak at a hotel when Michelle must deal with the viral outbreak and Jack and Palmer must give into a series of demands from the terror mastermind behind the attack.  One demand in particular involving the ordered execution of a central character makes for the finest hour of the day.

While Jack's plot is intriguing, things aren't so good in President David Palmer's camp.  Palmer survived the attack on him from the finale of season two and has returned to LA for an important debate with a rival candidate during his reelection.  But he finds himself facing scandal when his enemies dig up dirt on first his girlfriend, then his brother who is acting as his chief of staff.  The political scrapping causes Palmer to seek an unholy alliance with his evil ex wife, Sherry, who will do anything to get back into his life.  While Palmer was well connected to the plot in previous seasons, his story this season is disappointing and only serves as an unpleasant distraction from the intensity of the virus plot.  It's sad that the writers misused him as they did, since Palmer is such an important figure both inside and outside of the 24 universe.  There's also a subplot involving a mysterious baby at CTU that ranks with cougars and amnesia as the throwaway plot of the season.

The DVD extras are a wonderful treat with deleted scenes, three bonus documentaries and six commentaries.  There's also a preview of the fourth season and, of particular note, a six-minute prequel that sets up events for the next day.  All and all, this is a great package and, despite some plot holes, the roller coaster ride is still worth the price of admission.",1104364800,5,3496,4.69344262295082
2144820,5,B0002XVQSU,"A lot of characters continue, but in new roles. There are new relationship twists, some not surprising. The action is still good.

If someone is new to the series, I would still have them start with season one instead of this season (for background information). Great gift idea.",1104019200,2,440,4.5125
2144821,4,B0002XVQSU,"24 is an ingenious concept show that is miraculously still going strong. By playing out a difficult day in the life of government agent, Jack Bauer, the show's structure is set up so that each hour-long episode is shown almost in real-time. This results in many tense, white-knuckle moments that have been unsurpassed on TV. The first season did a great job of establishing the show's look, structure and the characters. The second season, arguably the strongest one, began with an incredible momentum and never let up as it showed a much darker, edgier side to the show's hero, Jack Bauer. Now, with the third season, the show has definitely hit its stride but how can it top itself again?

Disc one features an audio commentary on ""3:00 pm - 4:00 pm"" by writer-producer Howard Gordon and Kiefer Sutherland. The actor points out how the show works on multiple levels.

Disc two has an audio commentary on ""5:00 pm - 6:00 pm"" by writer Evan Katz and actor Riley Smith (Kyle Singer). Katz mentions that this was a tough episode to write and it went through seven drafts.

On disc three there is an audio commentary on ""10:00 pm - 11:00 pm"" by executive producer Howard Gordon and actress Sarah Clarke (Nina). They touch upon Nina's character and how she was originally supposed to die in Season 2 but the writers couldn't think up a decent way to do it so they brought her back to torment Jack for another season.

Disc four features an audio commentary on ""1:00 am - 2:00 am"" by executive producer Joel Surnow and actress Mary Lynn Rajskub (Chloe O'Brian). They crack jokes in this light, amusing track-Rajskub, with her self-deprecating humour and Surnow playfully poking fun at her.

Disc five has an audio commentary on ""5:00 am - 6:00 am"" by co-creator/executive producer/writer Robert Cochran, actress Reiko Aylesworth (Michelle Dessier) and actor Carlos Bernard (Tony Almeida). They talk about how this episode shows Michelle taking charge and getting out from the desk and into the field.

On disc six there is an audio commentary on ""10:00 am - 11:00 am"" by Bernard, actor James Badge Dale (Chase) and producer Tim Iacofano. With the presence of two actors, the emphasis on this track is obviously on performance and casting.

Disc seven is dedicated exclusively to extra material. First up, is a teaser trailer for the next season. This is followed by a promo that is basically an extended trailer that runs for six minutes and provides the build-up for what will happen in season four.

""24: On the Loose"" shows the hard work and meticulous planning that went into making the third season. There is even on the set footage of the prison riot that figures prominently in episodes five and six and the tedium of being an extra in these scenes.

""Boys and Their Toys"" focuses on how the creators of 24 were able to convince the Defense Department to fly two F-18 fighter jets over Los Angeles especially for the show!

""Biothreat: Beyond the Series"" is an extra not for the squeamish as the real science behind the virus used in the show is examined. The writers couldn't find one that was deadly that fast so they ended up making one up.

""Multi-Angle Study"" allows one to view the midnight shoot-out in episode 12 from three different angles-two separate ones and then with both combined.

Finally, there all 45 deleted scenes from the season with optional commentary from various crew members. These scenes can also be viewed on individual discs with their corresponding episode.

24 works so well as a political thriller because it stays current on the kinds of threats that are actually possible and very real. The bioterrorism threat that looms over this season scarily echoes the anthrax scare that the United States faced a few years ago. One has to wonder how long they can keep up this level of excellence and extremely difficult structure. So far, they've been extremely consistent, producing one of the best shows on TV.",1103587200,5,3939,4.783505154639175

2144823,2,B0002XVQSU,"The excitement is still there in season 3, but it's hard to stomach some of the outrageous logical lapses in this season.  There are a lot of spoilers in what I'm about to write.  DO NOT READ THE NEXT TWO PARAGRAPHS IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE FIRST TWO SEASONS.  SKIP TO THE VERY LAST PARAGRAPH.  AND BY ALL MEANS, SEE THE FIRST TWO SEASONS; THEY WERE THE BEST TV I'VE EVER SEEN.

Anyway... first, Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) broke his neck the first two seasons to SAVE his daughter from danger.  But in the 3rd season, she's WORKING at CTU?!?!?!  His wife was murdered at CTU in season 1; CTU was bombed in season 2.  There is no earthly way that Jack would have his daughter working there.  Also, in season 1, a character blasted all the ""personal relationships"" in the office, and their adverse impact on their work.  But now, Jack's daughter is there, and there's a married couple there.  The problem is that these relationships drive the story, when you know they would never be allowed to work there.

There is an agent that is revealed as a mole, who later turns out NOT to be a mole, but was posing as one.  Only TOny & Jack knew about it; the rest of CTU didn't.  But when they discover evidence that he's a mole, he tries to escape.  He actually shoots guards in the process.  When he's captured, he allows them to torture him, rather than tell the truth.  He turned out not to be a mole; what the hell was he shooting people for?!?!?

END OF SPOILER......

The bottom line is, far too many things in season three make absolutely no sense.  Events that happened early on are completely disregarded and treated as though they didn't happen, or happened differently.  The characters do things egregiously out of character.  It's one thing to go from mind-blowingly good (seasons 1 & 2) to OK, but this season is not OK.  It's terrible.",1103500800,11,1845,4.458083832335329

Empty plot holes and never resolved problems throughout the epsisodes plauge this season. As some events may appear way over-the-top and exaggerated, the pace of the show is as blazing as ever. Any 24 fan will feel right at home. However, if you are new to the show, I strongly suggest watching Seasons 1 & 2 before hand.

The biggest problem of the Season 3 is the complete (and unnecesarry) shift of the whole plot midseason. A lot of unanswered questions remain. I also did not like how President Palmer's problems in the season did not really concern the biothreat. Most of them revolved around backroom politics, involving his ex-wive, his brother and his Presidential contender. Only in rare events did Palmer actually address the threat, as he was neck-deep in his own personal affairs.

The last epsode was intense, and the ending gave substancial closure on the season and it holds for the future. I expect to see MANY new faces in Season 4.",1103328000,,1175,4.6124401913875595

But I think if you're going to write a review, you've just got to watch the entire season. You were quick to say that you didn't like any of the new characters, and that it was obvious that Gael was a spy. Had you continued to watch the show, you would have realized how wrong you are about him. He was actually working with Jack and Tony on a plan that nobody knew about.

The core of every episode is a gritty, suspenseful spy/police thriller with numerous plot twists and the possibility that any character (except of course, Jack Bauer) could be killed at any time.  The President Palmer storyline has deteriorated into a tepid soap opera linked only be the occasional phone call.  In the first season, presidential candidate Senator David Palmer was the target of an assasination attempt that CTU had to stop--this made movements and actions by the candidate significant to the plot and unexplained activities by his staffers as suspicious and suspenseful.  In season three, Jack Bauer is down in Mexico with drug kingpins trying to purchase a deadly weaponized virus before anyone else can, while President Palmer is worrying about the political consequences his brother's adulterous affair.  After a few episodes, I found myself getting up to freshen my drink (or whatever) when the David Palmer character would appear.

2144828,5,B0002XVQSU,"There are a number of signs that the series is running of steam and ideas. Even though it is still gripping in terms of editing and plot, it still however falls short.

Basically from the first few episodes, the viewers would be treated to a TV version of Soderbergh's Oscar winning ""Traffic"". The actors used, the locale, the context, the setting and even the MacGuffin device, a bag of cocaine, are veering towards the look and feel of ""Traffic"". Even the cinematography of some of the scenes set in Mexico, recalls the special filtering process that Soderbergh used in his film.

Sutherland remains as intense as ever. Elisha Cuthbert remains as irritating as ever. Why can't she just quit the series, she has absolutely nothing to contribute to the series except trouble. No, wait, maybe the reason why she's there is to fill in the empty plot holes and time it needed to fill in a full 24 hours...

They weren't really, but seemed to be, because of the many characters and setups to be accommodated.

The high point, in terms of drama, was the episode in which Jack had to terminate Ryan Chapelle for the good of the country. Even though Chapelle was a complete pain to work for, it was an emotional moment, and put some of Chloe's subsequent and  nerdy whining into perspective.

2144830,3,B0002XVQSU,"It is very odd that Amazon has elected to post ""reviews"" of this DVD release beginning in June when the DVD release date was/is December 7, 2004.

I preordered this set and I received it on December 8.  I've watched the entire DVD set and, now four days after I received the seven DVD compendium I will post my review.  NO SPOILERS.

All 24 episodes are present on seven discs with the seventh disk dedicated to special features and season four promos.

There are gaps in logic in this season's plot, but none greater than those in the first two seasons.  The acting remains very high quality, as are the production values.

The third season of 24 opens slowly and goes scattershot for the first two hours.  Everything begins to come together in the third hour but the plot becomes so harsh that it is hard to believe that this show was ever broadcast.

24 was never intended for a juvenile audience, and this season has pushed the edge of the envelope well beyond any ""PG"" rating into solid ""R"" territory for brutality.  In my experience only The Killing Fields and The Deer Hunter have more explicit violence. Strangely enough, the more time-limited films manage to place the violence in context better than does 24.  The nature of 24 is to set up and play out twenty-three cliffhangers and that does take up most of the script.  It seems that the writers have fallen back on the expediency of shocking brutality to carry the story.  In the end the viewer is left fearful of Jack - certain that there is nothing that he won't do.  It falls to the supporting cast to show compassion where Jack is well past human this season.

After the wrap the scorched earth of season three leaves us with two questions: what direction will season four take and, how can Jack top this season's ""action"" while remaining a broadcast show?

Cast and crew commentary is included on selected episodes.  The disks include the original season premiere together with deleted scenes and alternate takes.

A three star rating for way too much violence.",1102809600,2,2029,4.635854341736695
2144831,2,B0002XVQSU,"Though this series had an excellent beginning, it has been going steadily downhill with each passing season.  I stopped watching about mid-season (SPOILER:  Jack and Sandobar had just been outbid in negotiations to buy the biological weapon).  I gave up because the last five or six major plot twists required that someone in the cast do something UNBELIEVABLY STUPID and unprofessional to bring it to that point.  If, during such a crisis, the fate of our nation is in the hands of such a group of emotionally friable nimrods, God help us all.  It'd lost so much credibility that it became unwatchable.

As I stated in the title, I won't waste my time on season 4.  I gave it 2 stars because, as always, it did have excellent production values.",1102809600,5,745,4.684615384615385
2144832,4,B0002XVQSU,"Season 3 tends to present growing pains for most TV shows.  The first season generally sets up the franchise, the second season reacts to and raises the bar on the first...and the third tends to be uncharted territory, the true proof of a show's mettle.  Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, The Sopranos, and countless others all followed this arc more or less.

In the case of 24, the challenge is doubled because the first two seasons seemed to have thrown in every stylistic conceit, story twist, and character turn warranted by the espionage action/thriller genre.  And Season Three carries on the tradition, but you can see the difficulty in maintaining the momentum.

The story is the main problem.  It was almost inevitable that this show would utilize a biological-weapons plot sooner or later, but at certain key points in the A storyline, the plot finds itself with nowhere to go -- or rather, it knows where it wants to end up six episodes from now, but not in the next two.  The narrative drive of this season lags very badly at two points, around the eighth episode and near the end.  The Mexico portion takes up more time than it needs, and near the end the virus subplot ends up taking a back seat to the scanty political scandal around President Palmer.  Dennis Haysbert is reliable as Palmer, as usual, but when put alongside the virus infection and inevitable death of 800 people in the biological attack, Palmer's manoeuvrings with the petty Millikens seem downright trivial.  And just when I thought they'd given the character of Sherry Palmer some depth and believability in Season Two, here she once again reverts to a character whose actions will have you scratching your head in bewilderment.  Her blackmail of Palmer oscillates wildly between ""I want you back"" and ""you're a dead man""; to pull this off, they needed to give her emotional layers, and she doesn't get them.  The result is that she is not believable emotionally and holds no weight.  And while DB Woodside is appealing as Wayne Palmer, his attraction to the void-headed Julia Milliken (a skin-deep Gina Torres) makes for poor motivation.  The two previous seasons wove President Palmer's political stories and the terrorist threats far more deftly, and in this season, Palmer takes a definite back seat.  Luckily, the entrance of smarmy main villain Stephen Saunders raises the stakes nicely and boosts the narrative back up to the peak levels of Seasons 1 and 2.  Easily the most evil villain this show has seen, and that's saying a lot.

The CTU plot fares much better.  The revelation this season is Reiko Aylesworth.  While she was quite good in Season Two, here she seems to take a quantum leap forward in screen presence, intensity, and emotional engagement.  The character of Michelle Dessler is not only stronger but more multi-layered and therefore more appealing; this was the first time I didn't miss Sarah Clarke as Nina Myers.  Kiefer Sutherland's Jack Bauer is always fun to watch, though despite a heroin-addiction subplot, Jack doesn't really do anything too different from before.  Kim Bauer is now a cursory character at best, giving Elisha Cuthbert far fewer occasions to shine, but the addition of Mary Lynn Rajskub as oddball, insensitive analyst Chloe is great -- the character ellicits a weird mix of annoyance and sympathy that's perfect for the CTU dynamic.  Kick-butt Portuguese actor Joaquim de Almeida is stunning as drug dealer Ramon Salazar, one of those bad guys so effective and charismatic that you almost respond to them as if they were a protagonist.  Carlos Bernard gets to explore new, sensitive aspects of director Tony Almeida's character, James Badge Dale as Chase Edmunds provides a worthy action-man sidekick to the cast, and even long-running antagonist Ryan Chappelle (John Schulze) gets a moment in the sun in a small but touching subplot.  It's nice to see a ""good-guy"" character in 24 who's not steely and self-sacrificing, but cowardly and vulnerable.

Tonally this season is darker than the previous two.  24 has always been strong in making you feel like everything's falling apart, and this season aces the previous two in catastrophic excess.  That can't be a bad thing, since it definitely unsettles you, taking away the sense of safety and familiarity that TV series can often fall prey to.  In short, good suspense thriller material.

A major weakness, though, is that the plot holes and iffy character motivations that have always orbited the plotlines of 24 are now pretty glaring.  The twist (""Gael's wife"") which opens the final episode of the season is ridiculous, the discovery of  the ""Jane Saunders"" link not satisfying, and the two big character reveals of Sherry Palmer and Nina Myers definitely have the feel of rehashed material from Season Two, even though I still enjoy Sarah Clarke's understated performance as insidious rogue Nina Myers.  And but for Sherry Palmer's erratic actions, I still like Penny Johnson Jerald in the role -- she provides some much-needed sense of humour into a show that's by and large devoid of levity and comic relief.

Once again the story fails to wrap up loose strands, trying to explain questions away in broad strokes but leaving us hungry.  Season One had left us wondering ""How did Nina Myers get evil"" and ""Who did she work for"", questions never addressed in Season Two, and similarly Season Three pole-vaults over the final twist of Season Two just by saying ""President Palmer survived the virus attack, no problem"".  And we know ""something happened"" to make villain Stephen Saunders from a ""patriot"" into a fanatical terrorist, but we never find out what.  Sorry, guys, that ain't gonna cut it.  It's important to keep current story strands active, but certain loose ends just can't be left untied.

This show still makes for great fun watching, but now that the franchise has been shaken up so much by the substantial story shifts in this season, I wonder what the next season will be like.  If internet sources are to be believed (and I'm not saying they are), and if my eyes didn't fail me in watching the ""Season 4 Trailer"" on this DVD set, we're about to lose about 75 per cent of the main cast, to be replaced by new characters.  That would take some major getting used to.  And I hope the writers and producers don't do the ""turn-a-blind-eye"" trick towards the major developments started in this season, because aside from this unsettling habit, this is still a good, engaging show.",1102723200,13,6483,4.893870082342177
2144833,4,B0002XVQSU,"In the aftermath of season two the producers of '24' had a problem on their hands: How would they manage to bring the series to new heights using the same basic premise used in season two - when it had already reached the peak of all peaks with some of TV's most gripping and breathtaking episodes of all times?

In light of the third season, it's clear that the asnwer they have agreed upon was: ""Let's take everything we have done in season two - to the extreme.""

And indeed, some of the scenes you will witness on the screen have never been seen on TV before; the meaning of 'shocks' is redefined to something that more than once is undigestible. The viciousness of some of the characters goes over the top, and in a few cases you will see atrocities you have never dared to imagine.

Admittedly, '24' continues to march alongside with the real-life horrible events the world has observed in the passing year similarly to what it has done in its last season, when it partly mirrored - in a critical manner - the events that led to the war with Iraq.

The moral guidenace the show has occasionally provided in the first and second seasons has become ambiguous and blur in the third season; you will learn that dealing with extreme situations causes ground principals of black and white - to fade to gray. However, two outstanding instances prove that the show does carry worthwhile messages; the first instance occurs when a leading character will demonstrate how to deal with extreme difficulties by the sheer power of will and determination. The second one occurs as a simple phrase - ""You can start all over again. People do it all the time"".

Evidently, the producers themselves had come to realize they would have to start ""all over again"" to keep the viewers interested and intrigued - and therefore created serious changes in the fouth forthcoming season.

Let's hope they will fulfill their goals.",1102550400,4,1908,4.663690476190476

2144841,4,B0002XVQSU,"If you've never seen 24, you might as well start from the beginning and pick up the first season DVD.  It was arguably the show's strongest season (but they've all been good), and there's no reason to start in the middle since you'll inevitably want to see the whole thing.  24 is one of the most exciting and daring shows on television, and it's not one to be missed.

For fans of the first two seasons, the third season won't disappoint.  Some loose ends from the second season are left dangling, and at times it gets bogged down by storylines that seem out of place in its 24-hour format, but for the most part it's a great ride.

The third season picks up as Jack Bauer and CTU (the fictitious Counter-Terrorism Unit) are trying to track down the carrier of a deadly virus within Los Angeles.  A few surprises, red herrings, and plot twists later, and they discover that there's a much bigger threat than they originally realized.

Meanwhile, President Palmer is campaigning for re-election, and (of course) he happens to be in Los Angeles for a debate that day.  Palmer's storyline is surprisingly weak this season; rather than being forced to deal with the virus threat, he seems distracted by a barrage of family problems.  I think they missed out on some great opportunities for his part of the story this season.

I suspect they had an increased budget this season.  Action sequences seemed more plentiful--and more explosive--this year.  As usual, they were top-notch.

I enjoyed this season almost the whole way through.  It stumbled around for a few episodes near the middle, but it wasn't long before the show found its footing again.  The final ""act"" of this season has some of the most satisfying (and, at times, somewhat unnerving) episodes that 24 has ever had.",1100217600,3,1778,4.7272727272727275
2144842,4,B0002XVQSU,"Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) and his partner Chase Edmonds (newcomer James Badge Dale)spent the last year going undercover into drug kinpin Ramon Salazar's(Joaquim de Almeida)crime syndicate to bring him down. Now Ramon's brother Hector (Vincent Laresca) has threatened to release a deadly virus into the population of Los Angeles if they do not release Ramon from prison. Now it is up to Jack to discover a way to stop the virus from being released without giving into the Salazar's demands.

I have been a loyal fan of 24 since the very first episode. It is one of the most action packed and suspenseful shows that I have ever seen. With that being said, I was expecting great things from season three because the first season was amazing, and the second season somehow managed to be even better. Season three is very good and manages to supply all the usual twists, turns, and nail biting suspense. Unfortunately the third season manages to take a step back from the stellar first and second seasons. Kiefer Sutherland was amazing in season three and I have never seen him give a better performance. Season three featured the best development of Jack's character we have seen yet. Especially since he developed a drug addiction while being undercover with the Salazar brothers. However, even though the development of Jack and his storyline was superb, there was not much happening with the other characters.

One of 24's many strengths has been well rounded character development. Jack is the main character, but he cannot carry the whole show on his shoulders. Take Dennis Hayworth's character President Palmer for example. The first season had Palmer being the first ever African American presidential nominee in history that was targeted for assasination and the second season featured President Palmer in danger of being relieved of his presidency when a nuclear bomb is detonated on American soil. Both the first and second season featured a solid mix of Jack Bauer saving the day, and a solid storyline for Palmer. But in season three, all we get from Palmer is him trying to be re-elected and not much else. The good news is that we do see a few characters come back from previous seasons to shake things up. The other reason why season three was not quite as good, was because it supplied one of the most anti-climactic endings I have ever seen in my life. The first and second seasons featured outstanding cliffhangers that made the 24 episode ride we went through worth it. But season three's ending was perhaps one of the biggest letdowns ever.

Overall, season three of 24 was very enjoyable. It featured top notch development for Jack Bauer, and tons of action and suspense that will keep you on the edge of your seat. There are at least five episodes in season three that are up for top ten honors. If the ending had been better, and if the storyline for Palmer had been better, it would have been the best season yet. The thing that I liked best about season two's boxset was that the special features were excellent. Season three's extras manage to be just as good with deleted scenes, featurettes, and more.

A solid 4 stars...",1100217600,6,3150,4.806273062730627
2144843,3,B0002XVQSU,"There were many episodes of this season (particularly toward the end) that individually I would rate at 5 stars, but as a whole it did not gel.  When scripting a show that describes events that take place over 24 hours, maintaining continuity and suspension of disbelief are key.  In the previous 2 seasons, 24 managed to maintain this balance (though there were notable lapses from continuity brought about by manuafactured plot twists).  In this season the writers seemed to have decided mid-way through that they were going in the wrong direction and just decided to ignore that some earlier events had even taken place.  <SPOILER warning> For example, the scene early on where one of the Salazars was overseeing the mass burial of Cordella virus victims, was contradicted later when it was determined that the Salazars had never had the virus to begin with.<End Spoiler>  Overall, my sense was that there was no real vision for the season's arc from the first episode to the last.  Some inspired triage towards the end made it an enjoyable show to watch again, but a part of me demands far more internal consistency than was delivered.  In particular, the Palmer story was all over the map with a vast array of potential scandals materializing and then quickly resolved within a 24 hour period (his girlfriend's ex-husband, his brother's adultery, his ex-wife's blackmail).  On the positive side, Reiko Ayelesworth did spectacular work this season and finally brought Michelle to life as a beleivable, strong and extremely competent person.

If 24 wants to get back on track the writers need to have the season's events outlined in detail before the first script is written and not obsess over pulling the rug out from under the viewer with random 'twists' that seem to come from nowhere (the Sixth Sense and the Usual Suspects being good examples of how to do twists correctly).  I will tune in for another season I think, but not with the same enthusiasm andanticipation that I have in the past.",1099008000,60,2001,4.893491124260355
2144844,4,B0002XVQSU,"24, in my opinion, is probably the best show on television (although, there is not much viable competition). The actors always do a great job with the material, the locations are beautiful, and the writers, who probably have the hardest jobs in Hollywood, are not only able to consistently create stories that last 24 hours, they are almost always able to keep them interesting. This year, 24 remains in its loftyspot at the top, HOWEVER, compared to previous seasons of 24, this year doesn't exhibit the same level of direction or interest.

This year sees Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) tracking down the deadly and uncurable virus Cordela Virus (I'm not sure, but I think that the writers admire the work of Joss Whedon; first of all Joss is probably the single best writer alive, many people that are used in Joss's shows appear on 24, and the name of the virus sounds a lot like Cordelia, a character from two of Whedon's shows). The virus fell into the hands of the Salazaars, a family of Mexican drug lords, and Bauer helped arrest Ramon (Joaquim de Almeida) the kingpin of the family. Ramon's brothe Hector (Vincent Laresca) threatened to release the virus in LA unless Ramon is released. Soon, things escalate and the entire United States is threatened.

Furthermore, President David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert) is running for reelection, but when one of his campaign funders starts to threaten him, he calls his ex-wife Sherry (Penny Johnson Gerald) to help him out. Obviously, the help he receives is not what he was expecting.

This year, many of the characters ""lost their souls"", in a sense. By this I mean that some of our favorite characters did things that were totally uncharacteristic of them. Palmer calling his ex-wife was one, and Tony Almeida (Carlos Bernard) sacrificed his morals to help save his wife Michelle (Reiko Aylesworth). Although, Tony's actions were more understandable than some other poor decisions made throughout the season. Kim (Elisha Cuthbert) did not have too much to do this year; she was working at CTU, and therefore did not get into as much trouble as she has in the past couple years. Then, the two new characters, Chase Edmunds (James Badge Dale) and Chloe O'Brien (Mary Lynn Rajskub) were both little annoying. Chase seemed to have only 1 purpose: cause extra problems for Jack, and don't get me started on Chloe.

One other thing about the characters: in season 4, Jack will be the only returning regular. It seemed like the writers were systematically killing off or removing characters. Two major villains were killed, Palmer won't be back, and Tony will probably get the death penalty. Also, I was really angry that the storyline involving Max, the guy on the boat from the end of year 2, was not picked up. Maybe he'll come back next year.

Also, unlike in previous years, there was a large gap in interest levels. The year started off great, then kind of trailed off midseason, then became great again in the last 7 or 8 hours. The season premiere was one of the best yet, and the finale was great up until the final shot.

Despite all the faults this year, this was still a great season of television, especially compared to all the other stuff on TV. If you have never seen 24 before, look into the first 2 seasons before this, but by no means overlook this box set.",1098835200,10,3322,4.748700173310225

I, for one, do not watch 24 while it is on television and wait for it to come out on DVD so I can watch it without the psychological stress of waiting week after week.

I am only rating three stars because I haven't seen it yet, but if it is half as good as the other two seasons it is worth the three stars.

To be courteous to those like me please do not give away major plot points for shows like this in your review.  Your opinion may be valid, but if you can't make it without citing an example that ruins the show for those who haven't seen it yet, then simply don't make it.  If you absolutely must get this burning thought off your chest, simply putin the title to your review....'WARNING - SPOILER BELOW!'

I'll never forget the horror when I realized what Chase was willing to sacrifice in the line of duty.....relive the suspense with this great DVD, without having to wait a week to see what happens next.",1096329600,5,472,4.698795180722891

8034394,5,B0002XVQSU,"24 Season 3's awesomeness never lets up in this fantastic season. Rewatching this for the third time, I am just extremely impressed on how such a fantastic season could be put together and this isn't even my favorite 24 season! It's the best show with a stellar 3rd season well worth watching no matter how many times you have seen it. I highly recommend this gripping action thriller show and amazing season that as much as it thrills, it also tugs at your heart to make it unforgettable. Season 3 of 24 is among TV's best.",1521244800,,524,4.46875
8034395,5,B0002XVQSU,"The first season of 24 broke new ground in the television world with its cinematic style and unpredictable storytelling. Season 2 came back with a bang and reinforced the idea that this show could leave us breathless with its twists and suspense.

I've always maintained that season 3 is where the series really started to feel ""refined"". The production was of course top notch as always, the acting was once again fantastic, and the character development was superb. Where I feel like the show displayed the most progress in season 3 was in the writing and overall handling of conflict. To me, there still isn't a show on television that does drama like 24. Season 3 is a great example of this as we see Jack struggling with some internal demons while also trying to protect those around him at all costs.

The threat this time is one of the scariest out there as it deals with the threat of biological weapons. The entire plotline inside the quarantined hotel was handled brilliantly and would be worth watching the entire season on its own.  Jack's complicated dynamic with field agent Chase is engaging and felt very real to me. Michelle really has the chance to shine this season and her relationship with Tony adds even more dramatic tension to the plot.

Keifer Sutherland solidifies his already stellar reputation as a dynamite dramatic actor in his portrayal of our beloved tortured hero. He has an ability to show intensity and anger while breaking our heart at the same time. Kim's character is handled much better this time around and her relationship with Chase gives her side story a little more emotional weight than in the past. Overall, I would put this particular season up there with the best of them and highly recommend it to anyone looking for great binge-worthy television.",1520294400,2,1796,4.802588996763754
