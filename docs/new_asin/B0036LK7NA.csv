8390101,4,B0036LK7NA,"El Salvador has vanished from the news, but its people continue on since the end of a 12-year armed struggle. This documentary provides a unique view into a tiny country that captured the world's attention for a brief time - a David versus Goliath story. This documentary includes never before seen footage documenting the use of white phosphorus against civilian targets. It also contains an eye-opening interview with Bob White, former U.S. Ambassador to El Salvador, who admits the death squads could not get away with killing him, so they chose, instead, to bring down Archbishop Oscar Romero. It ends with the unlikely scenario in which the enemies of yesterday (the FMLN) win an unprecedented electoral victory and take the highest office in the nation.",1290211200,3,759,5.08
