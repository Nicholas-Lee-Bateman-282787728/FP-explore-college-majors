6600302,5,B00MRA9M0U,I love hip hop abs. I need to lose weight but wanted to have fun while doing it this was the workout for me. I lost 12 pounds my first month and still going atrong. Shaun T is amazing and funny and its like he's right there with you. He doesn't push too hard so you can definitely go at your own pace.,1441152000,3,301,3.7936507936507935

6600307,4,B00MRA9M0U,"Still waiting to see results after 1 month but like the video it is not overly complicated moves, time flies doing the workout which motivates me to use it nearly daily.",1418256000,8,169,4.483870967741935
6600308,5,B00MRA9M0U,"This is a fun workout. Just challenging enough to keep you interested, but not so difficult that it's discouraging. I've been doing it every-other-day for 3 months, and definitely see a difference in my mid-section. There are 2 DVD's. I'm still on the first. It's a 30 minute fat burning workout. I'm sure I will get the courage soon to try the second DVD with the 40 minute work out. I'm in my 50's and was getting upset about the middle-age bulge. So I started this workout. I'm glad I did. And for what you get, the price is great too. Just go for it, you won't be sorry.",1495324800,3,574,4.275229357798165

6600325,4,B00MRA9M0U,"I picked this up thinking it would easy, but it is a real work out!! I need to shed a few extra pounds and can't really get on the floor for sit ups.  I just felt out of wack with my body. So, my first work was very difficult, just to see how out of shape I was. But the more I did it the better I got. I really like to work out now, Iv'e had it for about a month and work every other day. It nice for people who need to start slow, because you can pace yourself and each session you get better.",1456704000,6,495,3.6261682242990654
