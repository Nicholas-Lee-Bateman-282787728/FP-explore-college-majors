1363682,4,B00004WG2H,"While in a final season, ""ze goofy funsters"" are still as creative as ever. Cleese is notably missing in silly action, however, his creativity is not. He is factually credited with ""additional blank verse"" in episode 43, ""Hamlet"", which for me is the epitome of Pythonic silliness, from bogus psychiatry to Palin's helmet-fixated Bobby to a bargain piston engine. The last episodes are characterized by show-length sketches, and is the ONLY season when the shows were aired in the order that they were recorded (why Idle suddenly appears as the linkman in #2!). Nonetheless, a priceless, timeless, and an essential peice of blatant stock film of women applauding. (that two-second clip was found in the BBC archives, and no-one knew why it was there in the first place)",973296000,3,769,5.015625
1363683,4,B00004WG2H,"The only reason that people might this particular season isn't as good as all the others is because John Cleese is gone.  There is, however, in a special section of the DVD called the ""Loony Bin"" where you can see John Cleese do an especially funny bit.  (I think this part was filmed for their 30th anniversary last year.)
My favorite episode in this package is ""The Light Entertainment War,"" which contains such sketches as ""Woody and Tinny Words,"" and a delightful rendition of ""Anything Goes"" that Cole Porter obviously didn't write.  I also loved the sketch with the stupid TV programmers, and Michael Palin's German Louis XVI.
All in all, not as good as its predecessors, but I enjoyed it just the same.",972950400,2,709,4.701612903225806
1363684,5,B00004WG2H,"To this day, Monty Python remains THE idol and source of inspiration to humourists all around. Monty Python's Flying Circus made the group famous, and it is the best ever to come out, not only from Monty Python, not only from Britain... but humour in general!
Highlights on this tape: Zeppelin, Different Endings, Woody And Tinny Words, Bogus Psychiatrists, Post Box Ceremony and The Man Who Finishes Other People's Sentences.

1363685,4,B00004WG2H,"There is a tendency to dismiss these final 6 eps as lower in quality than  the 3 seasons that preceded it. My personal recollection (from the days  when MPFC played on American public television) followed that, perhaps  because of the absence of John Cleese (by far the most famous Python here  in the U.S., then as now).
But Cleese's departure didn't so much drag the  humor down, as jolt Python out of a remarkable balance of styles that had  served them well. The result is a very different breed of Python: the  sketches are much longer, and often a single story thread predominates -  though the longer narratives still exist to hang sketches on (anticipating  the structure of their next two films). They are also much more surreal;  the logic (twisted though it was) of Cleese and Chapman's collaborative  efforts now gives way to Jones and Palin's flights of fancy.
Well, okay,  but is it *funny*?  Absolutely - my memory of these episodes didn't do them  justice at all.  Sure, the stuff I always loved was still there: Golden Age  of Ballooning, Anything Goes, the Queen Victoria Handicap - but even the  stuff that had me scratching my head in the past (e.g., the entire Michael  Ellis and Mr. Neutron episodes) worked surprisingly well for me. And Terry  Gilliam (who appears onscreen much more here than in the previous seasons)  had me gasping for breath with his part in ""The Most Awful Family in  Britain""!  BEEEANS!!!",968803200,10,1434,4.7439024390243905
1363686,5,B00004WG2H,"Maybe I'm weird too, but Mr. Neutron has got to be one of the funniest  things I've ever seen on TV (and this is a full 30 minute sketch).  If I  was to recommend a single MPFC episode to someone it would be this one.  As  the U.S. military chief says after bombing London...""Do we have any  statistics on how scared they are?"".
The Michael Ellis episode is  also very funny and surreal (also a full 30 minute sketch).
The Golden  Age of Ballooning is excellent.
The Most Awful Family in Britain speaks  for itself...hope you like beans.
All in all an excellent set.",968803200,7,566,4.365384615384615
1363687,5,B00004WG2H,"This may not be the best collection of episodes, but Mr. Neutron kills me.  ""I can eat vast quanities of ice cream"" They nailed the US  General and the extreme madness of the CIA. Not all that far from reality.",968284800,3,210,4.225
1363688,4,B00004WG2H,"Maybe I'm weird, but I actually think ""Michael Ellis"" and  ""The Golden Age of Ballooning"" are two of the funniest Python  episodes of all -- and they're in this set. Everyone seems to sneer at the  later episodes, but I think they're even more surreal than the earlier  stuff.",966297600,2,276,4.571428571428571
1363689,4,B00004WG2H,"These are the last six episodes of the series (episode 45 *will* be included in this set though it doesn't say so here.  The first two episodes  of this season (""The Golden Age of Ballooning"" and ""Michael  Ellis"") are easily the weakest two episodes of the entire series, but  the later episodes, including Mr. Neutron (one of my favorite Graham Chapman  characters), are pretty good, and the final episode, featuring The Most  Awful Family in Britain, ranks with the some of the best episodes from the  first three seasons. Overall, this is for the completist, and casual fans  should stick with the first three seasons.  Also worth noting: these are  the six episodes John Cleese does not appear in.",965433600,24,701,4.815126050420168
7925042,5,B00004WG2H,"Great stuff.  Despite their age -- maybe because of it -- these are a laugh.  One quarter shock humor, one quarter jokes about British radio and TV programs and the other 5 / 6ths is funny stuff.

7925044,3,B00004WG2H,"This encapsulates the fourth and last season of the Flying Circus, consisting of a mere 6 episodes. While a few of the sketches are humorous, many times I found myself suffering through a bad (or worse, boring) sketch and hoping the next one would be better. If interested, I would recommend viewing these sketches before buying. While the first three seasons are masterpieces, the final season simply isn't worth owning.",1391558400,,421,5.0285714285714285

7925047,5,B00004WG2H,"I remember these 6 episodes, which are famously known as ""the ones without John Cleese"".  This is probably the main reason they've never been widely televised in the US.  I remember only seeing them once in a great while, and while watching them, I didn't realise that Cleese wasn't in them, because they are absolutely hilarious, and they are just as good as anything Python ever produced.  With Cleese gone, Palin and Jones took over the writing, and deliberately made long form sketches, i.e. with a story thread running throughout the whole programme.  This works brilliantly in Michael Ellis, The Light Entertainment War, and Mr. Neutron.  The sketch with the ""anything goes"" song in Light Entertainment War is side splittingly funny.  The Mr. Neutron show gets in hilarious digs at the US (something the Pythons weren't really known for doing), and Michael Ellis is a brilliant one about buying an ant.  I get somewhat annoyed at people who dismiss these episodes as an afterthought, because they are stand on their own with any other Python episode.  After the show ended, Jones and Palin went onto do Ripping Yarns, which has many similarities with these 6 episodes.  I remember taping these 6 episodes while they were on Comedy Central, because I was afraid I would never see them again.  But I have the DVD now, so I'm OK.",1148256000,,1332,4.828193832599119
7925048,4,B00004WG2H,"In 1973, the Pythons decided to do another series. But John Cleese (who had been anxious to leave for a while) decided to leave the series to the rest.
  Although this isn't the best material Python could have put out, there performances are quite good in these episodes. Only a few sketches here rank with the best. I love the end of Golden Age of Balloning ""I've enjoyed being in it."" (Note: During the credits right after that, Jaques Mongolfier, is still trying to put his tongue in Carol's mouth.)Well here's the play-by-play for each of these episodes.
40- The worst one of the season. It just gets weak and boring during that whole stupid ""It's not a ballon"", and all of the bodies in the German's drawing room. Ironically, the season opener.
41-One of the few actual stories in the series. One of the strangest Python episodes (that's saying alot). I use Micheal Ellis as my fake name.
42-Probably the best of the season. Lots of strong sketches, but still a few turkies. (Note: Look for Neil Innes in the closing credits).
HALFWAY BREAK- It says in different books, that there's no more it's man in this season, and ""Flying Circus"" isn't in the title anymore. Well that's not exactly true. The It's man is in ep. 42, and in the first half, you can see flying circus on the screen, with the two strange men with breasts.
43-Another weak and boring one. The father in law is funny, but that's almost it. Almost nothing happens in this, that Hamlet thing is dumb with the recurring line.
44-MR. Neutron episode. Most of this is funny. But it's annoying to hear the Pythons trying to do American accents.
45- Last one. Not good or bad. The awful family is pretty funny, but the cartoon in this one goes on too long. Gilliams cartoons are usually good though.
Well these aren't really as good as the others, and new
Python fans shouldn't start here. Cleese was a key element, and losing him (just for the series for that matter)took off a lot of force.
Skip this, and get the whole set. What I decided to do, when I had no idea what I was getting myself into...",1090195200,5,2065,4.48936170212766
7925049,4,B00004WG2H,"I give this 4 stars just because it IS Monty Python (note, no ""Flying Circus"" in the title for the last year), but the absence of John Cleese's physical humor does detract from this set as well as the relative brevity in terms of number of episodes.

7925050,4,B00004WG2H,"The forth series of Python is essentially the only moment when the performances outweigh the script. Terribly under-written episodes like THE GOLDEN AGE OF BALLOONING do feature some excellent performances, like the embarrassed pauses between Palin 's psuedo-French King and Idle. There are still some classic bits of writing, but they seem stranded between vast slabs of underwriten tripe. Highlights include the Most Awful Family in Britain (particulary Gilliam's bean-eater), the Courtmartial sequence in the third episode, and the wonderfully exaggerated Banter sketch. Sketches like these make the videos worth buying alone (just fast-forward throught the other sketches...)",985046400,5,679,5.938775510204081
7925051,4,B00004WG2H,"When the second season ended for ""Monty Python's Flying Circus,"" John Cleese announced he had had enough, but he was talked into a third season. The fourth season came to pass without him and the effect was not all that good, as you can tell from the A&E release of the very last six Monty Python episodes: <Monty Python's Flying Circus, Set 7> (AAE 70088).
  Some of the six try to stretch a single idea into a full show. The first concerns the Montgolfier Brothers and ""The Golden Age of Ballooning"" and falls flat. The second is the best of all with the classic ""Michael Ellis"" sketch and comes as close to Kafka as this show ever did. The Court Martial sequence in the third, however, comes very close to pornography but makes up for it with the wonderful ""Anything Goes"" (not the Cole Porter one) lyrics.
  The ""Bogus Psychiatrists"" of the fourth merely repeats a formula done many times in the past, as does the ""Mr. Neutron"" sketch in the fifth. The latter, though, does have the hilarious bit of Master CIA Agent Teddy Salad disguised as a dog. The very last show gives us a bloody cricket match that is still not as gory as the ""Salad Days"" sketch from an earlier season. At the end, it was Eric who put thumbs down on a fifth season--and the show passed into history.
  For those who own the other sets, this is a must for the sake of completeness. Cleese is missed but the others--Graham Chapman, Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones, Michael Palin, Eric Idle, et al--are in top form. The menu system of the DVD is just as complicated as were all the others and at times it really is difficult to find your way into the episode. Still the ability to directly access your favorite parts (even the naughty ones) is a great advantage over having these shows on videotape. The added features are not particularly exciting.",983232000,8,1819,4.513677811550152
