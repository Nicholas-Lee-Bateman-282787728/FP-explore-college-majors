8641994,4,B00IGJKPAC,"In spite of the best efforts of low-budget filmmaker Edgar Muniz, an interesting concept never quite comes together. The first third of the film sets up an interesting premise -- a man becomes obsessed with an old western film he sees on TV but does not show up in any listings or guide -- and we are brought into the story wanting to know what is going to happen. The editing and dialogure in this early part of the film are inventive and crisp with some nice cinematic touches. Duing the middle third of the film, the story becomes more unfocused and by the last third, the movie has fallen apart. In spite of overall excellent performances and some talented people who show some considerable potential in the cast, I cannot recommend this title to the average viewer. It is however, of considerable interest to low-budget filmmakers, who, like Mr. Muniz are working with virtually no resources to put together a project some talent, some chewing gum and a prayer. Hats off to Muniz and his cast for such an effort. Also of interest are the attempts to create an aged period look for the scenes from the old western. The more saturated and high contrast images, combined with the added film grain create a visual look for these scenes that is different from the surrounding story in which they are set. Four stars for effort and as a showcase on what should and should not be done on an independent film of this type.",1400198400,,1419,4.568627450980392
8641995,5,B00IGJKPAC,"This is more than just a western. It's a small personal film that uses the western genre to explore deeper questions about masculinity and obsession. There are cool allusions to other westerns throughout but there are also references to Hemingway and ""Frankenstein""! It's a shoe-string budget movie, but it doesn't hinder the storytelling. Just don't go into it expecting heavy-handed exposition and traditional cowboy stuff. There are only a few action scenes, but they're good - and by ""good"" I mean BONKERS AND ABSURD AND BLOODY!
The music by Lucas Maldonado is GREAT! So weird!",1396137600,,581,5.126315789473685
8641996,4,B00IGJKPAC,"Provocative and strange.
At the heart of the film, it appears to be about a couple who can't have children.

And cowboys.
And Lynchian hallucinations.

It's an indy flick worth checking out, at the very least it'll have you intrigued and perplexed and maybe even staring down at your hand.

I'm glad i checked this out, it pays to peruse the dark, back alleys of Amazon.com.",1395273600,,374,4.636363636363637
8641997,5,B00IGJKPAC,It's bizarre and unsettling in places but it's fresh and engaging! The acting is intense and the concept is really interesting. This is a western on crack!,1395273600,,155,4.777777777777778
8641998,5,B00IGJKPAC,"Great, traditional theme, done in a modern original way. Acting, editing, and sound near pro-level. Well done guys. Support true independent film makers.",1393891200,,153,5.695652173913044
