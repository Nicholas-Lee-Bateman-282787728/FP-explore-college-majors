He spent all those years in school to do this?  Say it isn't so!  Don't quit your day job.  Ooops, you already did!",1113696000,,280,4.055555555555555

7936235,5,B00005AX74,"Being a fan of Essence Atkins since her days on the late WB sitcom ""The Smart Guy"" back in the late 1990s, I have always wanted to know what else she was doing in the way of acting projects. This film gave me an answer. The story of a 17-year-old girl living with her religious widowed mother (Roz Ryan, who co-produced the film) in Southern California, Essence plays the title character, Nikita, a smart yet feisty, sassy female who sells clothes from her job at a clothing store to fellow students at her high school as well as has a thing for a very handsome English teacher at her school (Kenney Lee) who happens to be engaged to the school's associate principal (Mari Morrow).  In spite of all the high-risk behavior Nikita is taking, she is willing to stop at nothing to get what she wants.  I often wondered how Essence would fare in a lead role versus the supporting role she had on The Smart Guy.  This movie gave me an answer.  Not only did I like Essence's intelligent yet sassy persona--adjacent to her Smart Guy character yet more understated there--but she was also able to convey different types of emotions in displaying the conflict of a teenager trying to move on and help her family out in light of her father's passing.  Down the stretch, when things became undone for Nikita, Essence displayed remarkable depth I wished I had in standing up to my parents at her character's age.  Yes, this movie, as it goes along, has something of a Christian undercurrent to it, yet keeps things on an even keel without becoming overtly preachy nor judgmental.  As the climactic scene approaches, certain points of God and faith get brought up in ways not always approached in adjacent films with such an underlying presence. And those points not only come about with the title character, but also some of the supporting players as well--all of whom chimmed in loudly and largely.  Here, Nikita Blues, in making its point, does so without the tremendous heavy-handedness evident in some other instances.  It gives up just enough to let the viewer sense what it is about. For that, I also credit Marc Cayce, who directed, wrote and produced the film.  I truly enjoyed this movie--especially Essence Atkins herself.  May we please be able to see more of her not only in other projects in the future, but also being able to carry the ball to literal daylight, in the lead role, as she clearly did in this production.",991526400,3,2419,4.6416861826697895
