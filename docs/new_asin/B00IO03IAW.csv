6283114,3,B00IO03IAW,This isn't a great movie.  It is actually more of an excuse to insert as much drama as possible with the main idea of the movie resting on the back burner.  The acting isn't so bad.  The lines aren't horrible.  It will be hard to resist the thought of kicking a field goal through the gap in Laura's teeth.  The end will make you feel like you wasted a couple of hours of your life for nothing.  The concept of this movie could have reached greater heights if they wouldn't have taken a soap opera tangent.  It almost seems like a romance-comedy actually.  Save your money and wait for this to hit prime if at all.,1396828800,16,614,4.232758620689655
6283115,3,B00IO03IAW,"""This is not the apocalypse and even if it is didn't we all say this would be the perfect place to ride it out?"" After a group of friends receive a text that just says goodbye world they are confused. After the very real threat of an apocalypse occurs old college friends show up at an ""off-the-grid"" home to wait it out. Little by little old feelings of love and jealousy start to creep in as they all brace for the end of the world. This is a tough movie to review and explain. Some parts of it are very funny and entertaining while others really slow the movie down. The mood switches from happy comedy to downer drama. Some of it is very predictable and some of it comes out of nowhere. I did like this movie for the most part but there was a movie that came out about a year ago called It's A Disaster which was about the same idea and I liked that one much better. Overall, an OK movie that struggled to find an identity. I give this a B-.",1396656000,,945,4.086021505376344
6283116,1,B00IO03IAW,"This might be the worst movie I've ever seen. It was The Big Chill, pot-smoking generation-X style, meets the Apocalypse, but in a gentle California way. Horrible plot, dialogue, and acting. Who thought this one up?",1396569600,10,215,5.0

It really is misleading.  It is a good story with a good script.  The writers developed the characters enough so that the viewer is actually able to understand what motivates most of them,  This is something that is missing from so many movies.

I am an avid watcher of The Walking Dead, but it is refreshing to see an ""apocalyptic"" movie that doesn't involve man eating beings!  It is always interesting to watch human nature in its raw state.  I am a sucker for happy but not sappy endings.

6283189,4,B00IO03IAW,"Good movie. Yeah, the cover art on the DVD doesn't give an indication of the type of movie that this will be, but you can never judge something by the cover. It's an indie film about former college friends reconnecting and exploring old problems after society collapses due to an internet attack. It's entertaining and well acted. So, plenty of dialogue, not a lot of action, but a great movie.

If you buy a movie based on the cover, then you have nothing to complain about because you did not bother to read anything at all about the movie. So, basically, ignore any review that complains about the cover art as those individuals did not take the time to read anything about this movie before watching. I actually watched this for free somewhere a year or so ago and didn't spend any money on it, but plan on buying the DVD or Blu-Ray at some point.

I give this a 4-star based on the acting and story, not the cover of the DVD. I won't explain any of the main plot points, other than the fact that society collapses as the result of an internet attack, as this will detract from your viewing experience. The bottom line is that Goodbye World is The Big Chill set in a world that collapses.",1472256000,,1192,4.389140271493213

Tonally this is actually pretty daring for it's willingness to ignore the idea of dark comedy and instead go with a lot of outright comedy beats in the face of some pretty serious topics. Occasionally it results in an unpleasant selfish hipster attitude but overall it's well placed and well carried out. I'd have liked to see that daring continue and give it some edge, whether the plot had focused on the disaster movie side, or the character relationship side. Unfortunately, both are pretty blandly done, leaving you with a distinctly TV movie feel.

As far as the 'how do we survive the collapse of society' angle there was next to nothing here. One character has a fairly ideal setup and everyone else just kind of shows up. The screenwriter did make sure to get in the standard features of this kind of story: the scary guys in town are all bikers, the 'military' as represented by 2 jack asses traipsing around taking what they want is useless, and the government is only interested in setting up martial law. However all of that happens as incidental pieces of the background to the story of a weasely jerk trying to steal away his old flame (with his current wife in tow) from his unlikeable ass of a former business partner. Other equally shallow characters include their former felon buddy who has done nothing with his life, the girl who was part of the government until she was outed on a sex tape with a high ranking official, and their pal who destroyed the world by accident because he found something 'interesting'. All in all just a run of the mill 'bunch of friends in a confined space' story with a lightly different backdrop.",1419120000,,1206,4.536697247706422

6283271,4,B00IO03IAW,"Liberal apocalypse love story? Sure, but still worth watching. The cover can be misleading and most survivalist type movies are more right leaning, there are still things to take away from the movie.

First, have some kind of fall back plan. A cabin on the mountain is out of reach for most, but you can see the benefits of isolation.

Second, have some supplies on hand. I wished they had went into a little more detail about his preps, however you can see the importance of having a supply of medicine.

Third, weak people will be taken advantage of.

Fourth, and really the ironic thing about this liberal leaning movie... You need to be able to protect yourself; guns go a long way.

Fifth, and the overall point of the movie... Our society is fragile. A series of coordinated events can change the world as we know it.

Low budget movie? While it didn't appear to cost that much to produce, there was solid acting and never did I think it was like most of the other low budget survival movies. The story line also worked for the movie. Hopefully, this movie can get a few more liberals to join the preparedness movement; escape the entitlement society.

I would give it five stars if they went more into detail about he preps, went over their gardening/canning, and if they had some kind of protection/security system.  I also didn't appreciate how they depicted the two soldiers in the movie; rather tasteless if you ask me.",1417219200,7,1430,4.602362204724409

6283273,1,B00IO03IAW,"The cover makes it look pretty good right?  Even the premise sounds promising.  When I looked at this I thought that it might be like a Walking Dead, or maybe Revolution, or Jericho, all of which I would fully recommend, but this... nope.

  Goodbye World is a perfect example of ""don't judge a book by its cover"".  It is absolutely horrible.  It embodies everything that gives Indie films a bad name.

  The premise has a ton of potential.  A mass text which reads ""goodbye world"" goes out to every phone in America.  The text opens the door for very bad people to infiltrate the America communications network, and a virus shuts down all things connected to the web, which is just about everything.  With the infrastructure down, all chaos breaks loose.  There are riots, looting, and a generalized shutdown of society as we know it.  But then, it gets weird.

  The story follows a group of intellectualized friends who reunite at a cabin away from society, after years apart.  They each have diverse lives now, but used to be great friends.  Instead of mayhem and destruction, as the cover would suggest, you get to listen to the extremely boring politics, personal histories, and intellectualized, unrealistic ideals.  The cabin is well prepared for an apocalypse because the couple living there are completely ""granola"", and the house is self-sustained with solar panels, gardens, and a well-supplied basement with meds and whatnot.  There is a weak love triangle.  The dialog is horrendous.  The focus of the movie is so boring I almost fell asleep.

  To make matters worse, the director threw a bunch of swear words in (a lot of ""F"" words) because the movie couldn't stand on its own.  You could almost feel the director or writer's desperation as they tried to make the movie appeal to an ""adult"" audience.

  The actors were horrible, and none of the characters were believable.  I wanted to stop this movie so many times, but kept watching hoping the the group would be slaughtered by real people.  Sadly, that never happened.  What little conflict did arise was so fake, and diffused by hippy love, that it made the whole plot fall flat.

A bunch of twenty-somethings get together in a remote house when an apocalypse virus crashes the internet and the power grids, turning the nation into chaos. The cover had us fooled into thinking this was some kind of science fiction epic. Nope.

When these people eventually converge at this place and hole up, we get a bunch of at first, mild mannered sniping, whining and angst that goes on and on and on until it just gets worse. When the movie finally ended with a big whimper, the one and only significant scene near the end was anticlimactic at best. I sat through an hour and a half for that?

The artsy crowd and character-study people would probably love this, but I found it an awful bore, especially watching a bunch of twenty-somethings whine for an hour and a half. Sorry, not my cup of tea.",1415404800,,973,4.4858757062146895

6283276,4,B00IO03IAW,"EMPs or Electromagnetic Pulses, are what can be caused by solar flares and a low level nuclear bomb set off in the Earths atmosphere. This would wipe out the electrical grid. A former US Secretary of defense warned that either of these causes was immanent, he said probably with in a 10 year time...but it has been longer than that since he said it. R. James Woolsey, who served as director of the Central Intelligence in the Clinton administration says we are vulnerable to attack, as evidenced by the constant break ins to our nations secret documents via computer hacking.  This film is about a couple of computer nerds setting off a virus that knocks out the electrical grid.

The U.S. electrical grid, which
is, by report,  very vulnerable, if knocked out would act like dominos and life-sustaining critical infrastructures dependent on the grid twould also cease to function. Our water is pumped to our homes, that would stop. The fuel for our cars, has to be pumped, that would stop. That means cars would stop, trucks bringing food to stores would stop. Garbage pick up would stop. Electricity, refrigeration, communication, transportation, and much more would stop.

It would take at least 4 months to over a year to restore systems, by then it is estimated 90 percent of the population will be dead.  And that is just for the grid going down, there are other scenarios....like Ebola. (did everyone hear that the doctor that was admitted to Emory with Ebola and was sent home as cured, came back with the Ebola virus TEEMING in the vitreous humor of his eyes? (I suppose the virus hunkered down in the jelly of the eyes where the chemicals in the blood had a harder time of accessing it; and so when the man seemed to get well, they said he was. But this explains why Ebola just keeps popping up over and over once they think they have it eliminated.)

Solar flares can be up to 14 times the size of Earth. Most are not as large as an X-class flare which is the most powerful flare, mid range is M-class, least intense is C-class. Solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation, that can disturb the atmosphere layer where GPS and communications signals travel. The radiation does not physically affect humans on the ground that we know of. NASA and the National Science Foundation estimate  a direct hit to the US from an X-class flare, could cost the US $2 trillion in the first year and kill up to 90 percent of the U.S. population because of failure of services, starvation and disease. (reference www.wnd.com/2014/08/nasa-dangerous-sunspot-aligning-with-earth)

The Ebola scare in the US hit and I was wanting to find a movie that could give me a feel for what could happen.  I found this film about the grid shutting down.

It was about a group of friends. These friends had either smarts,  money, connections and so would do better than most of us surviving; and it was clear that they might not.
One of the guys was living off Grid and had stocked up in case ""something"" happened in the future. He might be what they call a ""prepper."" Seeing what he did gave me an idea of what would need to be done. Seeing the problems they had, gave me an idea of what you would have to anticipate for and defend against. Though I am sure there is a LOT more that needs to be thought of,it was a beginning to start thinking and a way to get the discussion started.

He had invited some friends to his place, some of them had a open invitation which they used when they realized civilization was melting down. So as the world goes to pot, these different people's relationships are explored.

It was well acted/ The filming was well done and visually attractive. It was sugar coated and some of the people you got to know just left, and that was not satisfying. But it held together well enough to be enjoyable and profitable. There was enough action to be tense and hold your attention.

It was a little strange that this prepper had gone so far as to stock medicines, but had no defensive strategy. IF the world goes to pot, and supplies and resources are no longer available, people are going to become cavemen again. They will take, and kill.  What good does it do to have your own power supply, and goods if it will be taken?  Where were the walls, the gates, the fortifications so that someone could not just shoot through a window?

Ezekiel says that God will send a pestilence that will cover the earth like a cloud. That 5 of every 6 people will die. That brother will kill brother, and even good people will try to take from their neighbors.  Ezekiel says that places that do not have walls, gates, and bared doors will be the first attacked. And that this pestilence and war will last for 7 years and that afterwards it will take 7 months just to pick up the dead from around us. That the birds and the animals will eat the bodies.

The movie did have biker gangs and renegades taking over, and trying to set up groups; where they were in charge by force. Like a good Californian the day, in the movie, was saved by a woman using a speech of George Washington in which it says that ""the enemy is us"" and ""each day determines what the future of the world will be like."" .and THAT brought sense to a whole group of people who had been senseless and running scarred before....?  The movie left it like that, which is why I said it sugar coated it. BUT STILL there are NOT many films out there that even deal with this issue, so it was enjoyable and worth something in addition to watch it.

As a movie, it was OK plus, so a 3 1/2, and then add a bit more for it being a ""times appropriate movie."" up to a 4. There was no nudity that I remember, but there were sexual scenes. The words, and situations were not for young children.",1415145600,3,5738,4.471770334928229

Hell no.
It's a movie. The acting is pretty good, and the storyline isn't bad. Some people are at a cabin when civilization collapses. They deal with it, over a very short period (just a couple of days).

The visual aspect of the movie is okay, there's some pretty scenery where they live in the woods.

Really necessary?  A new couple enters the fold and the girl (whom they've not met) just drops her pants squats and pees.  Yes, and it comes complete with sound effects.

I'd sum this up as: A bunch of yuppies make it out in time to watch society experience a little snag in which the power grid goes down and unrest and looting breaks out and even their small community experiences price gouging and other unsavory characters. The protagonists enjoy their well stocked refuge while their less prepared neighbors scrape by.

My main criticism is that the movie doesn't know what it wants to be, it lacks the grand destruction of a disaster movie, it has no likable actors you can identify with, no real bad guys either (the one potential bad guy get killed within seconds of getting out hand...) and the plot inconsistencies around the prepping don't help either. You'd think if someone puts that much effort and thought into his survival also gotten the means to defend his stash...

It supported the liberal anti-gun stance by having all this stuff but no way to defend it yet at the end it becomes one big happy commune.
Liberal child raising  because discipline is wrong and children should just develop on their own with screaming fits and tantrums.
Characters made their money off the system and ""sold out"" to the system then complained about the system they got their money from.
Soldiers are bad and evil ( they were deserters and anyone should have been able to see that.)

Amazingly, the rest of the movie was one sly surprise after another - by the end I was completely in love with everything about it. It's funny, clever, startling, and thoughtful - the sensibility that informs it is terrific.  If you're looking for a refreshing antidote to the usual formulaic entertainment, this is it.

For those that remember the 80s or see reruns on cable, there used to be a social drama called '30 Something', and for me this best sums up the fusion between this film and the Apocalypse. This is American post-apocalyptic film telling the story of a couple who raise their daughter while living off the grid, until a disaster brings about radical changes in the life they have been living and the way they will view their friends. A film that is made up of series of vignettes as a group of friends intermingle and loosely try to figure out who may have caused the break down through a computer virus. Then add into the mix a biker gang and National Guard soldiers - both of which play out to their stereotypes.

This is indie film with some rather good actors, but the story and the narrative seem to be out of phase with the premise of the movie. As an example - who would discuss property values in the middle of world meltdown? The DVD cover is really poor thinking on the part of the marketing company that were given the job to put out the DVD, and is misleading at best.

Goodbye World misses this. None of the characters seem to be ""good"".  The turn to self-preservation is so quick that the audience doesn't care if they live or die.

6283404,2,B00IO03IAW,Not enough depth to characters. They were shallow. In all how well do we know our shelves in certain situations? Charaters just weren't there ......would not recommend,1397520000,,167,5.222222222222222
6283405,2,B00IO03IAW,"Not a terrible movie, it's just marketed completely wrong. The actors all deliver very strong performances that make you identify with them or despise them as intended. My problem with this movie was that the trailer and the product description tricked me into thinking that the movie would be more about societal collapse and the struggle for survival, while this theme turned out to be more of a minor road bump for the main characters. This movie was more about old college buddies that retreat to a house in the country and then smoke a bunch of weed and drink a lot of booze while they confess their mistakes and character flaws about each other and bring to light old crushes etc. So, I was led to believe this would be an adventure/apocalypse film and was instead tricked into watching a chick flick.",1397520000,47,807,4.65034965034965
6283406,3,B00IO03IAW,"A ""Goodbye World"" virus infects all cell phones and the power grid. Some trucks blow up so all vehicles stop delivering food. This is like a a bad ice storm without the ice and sudden anarchy with riots.  A group of people gather to a self sufficient community in northern California.with the expected neighbor problems. The group went to college together...sort of.

Two people in the group are hackers...wink, wink, nudge, nudge. The movie centers on personality conflicts plus that end of the world thing.

The drama conflict got boring. The film did make good use of character build up and flaws, but it really needed direction instead of giving us a daily soap opera.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. sex. No nudity. 3 stars is a stretch.",1397347200,3,735,4.809523809523809

6283409,1,B00IO03IAW,"Great misleading synopsis. Bad low budget movie! This is more a love story than an adventure/action movie.

8643781,5,B00IO03IAW,"I thought this movie was very insightful and captivating. I enjoyed the character development and watching as each of them changed their ideological viewpoints in one way or another. I was able to believe this is how a group of individuals with their back-story would react and interact with each other and others during the initial days of the crash of society in which they are not fully aware of the full ramifications. I thought the script was well written and the acting, by all, was surprisingly good. The cinematography was well filmed. I thought they did a good job of creating conflict, guilt, humour, misunderstanding, grief and forgiveness while keeping it all believable. There was definitely some funny parts when they were stoned and drunk as well as a couple of very surprising scenes. I am very happy to have chosen to watch this movie.",1521763200,,852,4.842465753424658

8643785,5,B00IO03IAW,"Solid acting, but the 5 stars is more for the way the human relationships under stress are explored. Whoever allowed that cover to be put on the movie is doing the effort serious injustice. This is relatively slow, somewhat thought provoking in spots, with characters that are not drawn for the purpose of the viewer liking them. It is definitely not an action film. Pretty sure i watched this before that cover was chosen. I most likely would have skipped it.",1505174400,,460,4.691358024691358
