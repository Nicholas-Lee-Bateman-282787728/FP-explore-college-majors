5825534,4,B00DL47YY2,"Scott Cooper (Director: Crazy Heart) has made not just a movie, but created a memorable, dark force of a film about two brothers in a small steel town that enter the underworld of illegal bare-knuckle boxing.

Casey Affleck plays an Iraq War vet that starts fighting to make a little money. His older brother, played by Christian Bale, tries to protect him against the pull of the underworld controlled by a cruel but highly watchable and fascinating Woody Harrelson who plays the fight promoter/drug dealer.

Its gritty, violent, and at times mesmerizing. For those that liked the movie The Fighter, this is definitely worth a look, as it is that film, but way darker and a whole lot more butt kicking.",1393545600,,703,4.801652892561983
5825535,3,B00DL47YY2,"First off I am a fairly big Christian Bale fan. This movie sports a pretty impressive cast and a surprisingly only decent plot. Out of The Furnace tends to move very slowly, however it delivers just often enough to keep you watching. To me this movie is a standard revenge based movie, with a bit of grittiness to make it better than most revenge movies out there today. If you can stand sitting through a few slow moving parts then its worth at least a one-time watch.",1392336000,3,469,4.402298850574713
5825536,4,B00DL47YY2,"Check out the actors. All do an admirable job. One take on a man who has lost it all. Another movie with powerful silences. The only negative, lots of mumbling, causing the viewer to say ""What?"". This movie stays with you.",1391558400,29,222,4.439024390243903
5825537,4,B00DL47YY2,"I must admit I found the trailer for Out of the Furnace to be one of the more intriguing ones I have seen in 2012, which filled me with a burning curiosity to see it. It was released in early December which suggest it might have had some Oscar ambitions, but disappeared from the theaters before I had a chance to find it, and so I watched it online instead.

Director Scott Cooper's first movie Crazy Heart won two Oscars;one for Jeff Bridges as a country singer grappling with alcoholic demons, and one for T Bone Burnett for the music.

Casey Affleck has demonstrated like his brother an ability not only to act but to wear the multiple hats of screen writer and director. Interestingly like Ben for Goodwill Hunting he wrote a screenplay with Matt Damon for a movie in which they both starred called Gerry, apparently based on a true life case of murder involving two friends lost in the desert. Interestingly, someone I know was friends of the victim, and he was very miffed at how the case turned out.

He starred in the acclaimed Gone Baby Gone written and directed by Ben Affleck, and I found his performance in the disturbing movie The Killer Inside Me where he plays a mild mannered small town sheriff, and a serial killer to be quite compelling. A scene with a prostitute played by Jessica Alba many found too disturbingly real for a murder movie.

OOTF also stars Academy Award winners Forest Whitaker and Christian Bale, and a particularly menacing and realistic killer played by Woody Harrelson, and Willem Dafoe as a local fixer. Zoe Saldana plays the girlfriend.

Out of the Furnace relates the story of two brothers Russell (Bale) and Rodney Baze (Affleck) who live in a small town whose main industry is the mill, and where abides a shadowy world of drugs and bare knuckle fighting. The relationship of the two brothers is well developed, and one can sense a foreboding in the seeming ordinariness of their lives, for Rodney Baze is not at ease in the town and wants something more than a mundane job at the mill, the two options being bare knuckle fighting or joining the military, and the older more responsible brother (Bale) has to keep an eye on his younger brother, particularly as he does not adjust to the corrupt realities of diving in the underworld.

Although we can see the recklessness of the younger brother being a tragic flaw, it is the older brother who ends up in jail. For a while it seems as if tragedy is frustrated as the younger brother goes off to war, but wars don't last forever, and neither do military careers, and Rodney finds himself once again at the burning end of his desire for something more, this time dogged by the horror of his war experiences.

If you're like me there is some symbolism which may put you in mind of The Deer Hunter.

Before long our characters paths will cross once again with the antagonist, and there are enough warnings about the lethal potential of this world for young Rodney to take heed, and we sense his lack of ability to control himself in the heat of a fight may have lethal consequences.

By the way we do come to love Rodney even if he is reckless, because we know he is a good guy at heart.

When someone is murdered and Rodney disappears, Russell an accomplished marksman and hunter has dilemmas. Should he leave it to law enforcement, follow his girlfriends advice and let it go, or take matters into his own hands against a dangerous individual and the leader of a gang who places no value on human life above his own ego and impulse.

Revenge or no revenge, that is the dilemma.

Woody Harrelson has made a career out of playing tough uncompromising manly guys. There can be no denying his bad boy credentials. But the biggest surprise in this movie is the brilliant acting performance of Casey Affleck, probably his best performance to date. I would not have bought him as a tough military guy or a street fighter before seeing this movie as it seems so out of character for him, but he succeeds in bringing intensity and nuance to this character, essentially he becomes the heart and soul of this movie, shining out among very well established actors who have won the greatest awards.

His performance is so good I think it does deserve an Academy Award Award nomination, and I would be extremely gratified if it did, but I suspect this movie in general, though not the best movie of the year by a long shot, might slip entirely through the cracks, and Affleck's performance with it.

If the premise of this movie intrigues you I would recommend you go for it. I think most people will enjoy it, and I hope this was helpful.",1391299200,2,4618,4.554885404101327
5825538,5,B00DL47YY2,"I loved this film.  I am a big fan of everyone involved in the movie.  It is a gripping crime and family drama that hits close to home.  All of the characters are someone that the average person can relate to.  It has lots of emotion and tension, keeping you on the edge of your seat for the entire film.

While Christian Bale and Casey Affleck are two of my favorites, Woody Harelson and Zoey Saldona really steal the show in this movie.  They show so much power that I forget they are actors while I watch... and that is the reason I watch movies!",1391126400,,549,4.180952380952381
5825539,4,B00DL47YY2,"Dark, gritty, and saturated with rust, dust, and smog, Out of the Furnace is both a compelling ode to the people of the Rust Belt, bravely persevering through urban decay and rising crime...and a rather predictable thriller elevated by stunning work from Scott Cooper's amazing cast.

Rounding out the terrific cast is a riveting Willem Dafoe, a sturdy Forrest Whitaker, and an underused Zoe Saldana. As I said before, it is thanks to Cooper's winning cast that his movie succeeds as it does.

Technically, the movie is excellent. The cinematography is saturated and grey almost to the point of post-apocalyptic-wasteland, but often strangely beautiful. However, if FURNACE has a fault, it would be that it is too focused on being gritty and grim to give any real insight into the people of the Rust Belt.

Continuing with cons, the thriller aspect of the film...is sadly, rather predictable. The plot is hardly original, with everything happening in exactly the way the average moviegoer forsees it to happen. This predictability hampers the film and reduces suspense. FURNACE also continues the The Mentalist school of old-men-getting-shot-and-running-for miles reasoning.

But heck, enough with the cons. In conclusion, Scott Cooper's OUT OF THE FURNACE is a mostly engrossing drama with tremendous acting, but with a lackluster plot. Standouts go to Woody Harrelson's scenery-chewing performance, and Casey Affleck, whose haunting performance was memorable and heartbreaking. The screenplay may need tweaking, but this film should get out of the furnace, and into your DVD player. 4/5 Stars.

P.S. If this review was helpful to you, please give it a like! Cheers.",1390953600,147,2477,6.493939393939394
5825540,4,B00DL47YY2,"Russ Baze (Christian Bale) is a blue collar worker in a mill town working at the local furnace in North Braddock, Pa. His father (Bingo O'Malley) is in his death bed, have given his life to the mill. Russ has a girlfriend Lena (Zoe Saldana) who lives with him. His brother Rodney (Casey Affleck) has a gambling problem and owes John Petty (William Dafoe) a bar owner who also sponsors unlicensed fights.

Russ becomes a guest at the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections after a drinking and driving accident. His dad dies, girlfriend leaves him and Rodney comes back from Iraq with some mental issues, but still owes John Petty. Rodney participates in the fights and becomes involved with the ""Jersey mountain inbreds"" of which Harlan (Woody Harrelson) is the worse with his own anger management issues and sense of ethics. This does not go well and forces Russell to get involved to the dismay of local police chief (Forest Whitaker) a man who is now living with Lena.

The acting was good. Woody Harrelson could have been on the screen more for me, but it appears they maximized his minor role with the opening scene. The film was more drama than the action thriller I was hoping for. Christian Bale's character was slow and thoughtful, yet he found himself in the kind of trouble generally reserved for those who are less so.

Very good second effort for director/writer/actor Scott Cooper.

5825541,4,B00DL47YY2,"""Out of the Furnace"" (2013 release; 106 min.) brings the story of 2 brothers, Russell and Rodney Baze (played by Christian Bale and Casey Affleck, respectively), living in a depressed steel mill town near Pittsburgh. As the movie opens, we witness a man (played by Woody Harrelson) getting into an argument with his date while they are watching a movie at the drive-in, leading eventually to the pummeling of a bystander who wants to stop the abuse. It makes for almost uncomfortable watching but it certainly established the Woody Harrelson character (we later learn his name is Curtis DeGroat) as one of the more brutal, mean and outright sadistic characters on the big screen in a long time. Meanwhile back to the Baze brothers, Russell causes a car crash, sending him to jail. Rodney is back from another tour of duty in Iraq, and dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder which lead him to get involved with illegal/underground bare-knuckle fights. Then Russell gets released from jail. At this point we are a good 30-35 min, into the movie. To tell you more of this plot-heavy movie would surely ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: this is the second movie from director Scott Cooper, after 2009's excellent ""Crazy Heart"" (the Jeff Bridges vehicle). Here again, Cooper tackles a tough relationship drama, albeit in a very different setting. Second, the parallels between this and ""The Deer Hunter"" are striking: both are set in a dying steel mill town, both deal with post-war stress (then: Vietnam, now: Iraq), both provide hunting as a possible form of temporary stress relief (down to the one-on-one confrontation between the hunter and the deer). Third, the acting performances in this movie are nothing short of stellar, and this movie features a veritable all-star cast. In addition to the already mentioned Bale, Affleck and Harrelson, there are equally juicy performances from the likes of Sam Shepard (as the old uncle), Zoe Saldana (as the (ex) girlfriend), Forest Whitaker as the police chief, and William Dafoe as a deranged underground ring leader. Fourth, check out the excellent soundtrack from Dickon Hinchliffe, which is available here on Amazon, but which strangely does not include Pear Jam's ""Release"", which plays over the closing credits of the movie.

Bottom line: ""Out of the Furnace"" is a heavy and gritty movie, dealing with/exposing an ugly underbelly of society. This is not the kind of movie that you walk out of thinking ""well, that was a jolly good time!"", but I nevertheless enjoyed it from start to finish (actually: almost finish, as I thought the last 5 min. of the movie are a bit too ambiguous). This movie opened last weekend here in Cincinnati and I couldn't wait to see it. The screening I saw this at was not well attended, and it makes me wonder if this will last long in theatres. That aside, if you are in the mood for something darker and heavier than your usual Hollywood fare, you will not go wrong with this, be it in the theatre or on DVD/Blu-ray. ""Out of the Furnace"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1386806400,61,3120,4.884905660377359

5825621,4,B00DL47YY2,"So the thing about Cooper is he does BIG IDEAS.

This could be a whole blog post or something ... maybe someday it will be ... but if you've seen Hostiles, this is one of the guy's earlier pieces. Both also feature the immensely awesome (disciplined, dedicated) Christian Bale.

What I mean by BIG IDEAS is that Cooper's films seem to get into huge-ities ... LOVE, DEATH, FAMILY, MARRIAGE, REVENGE, etc. I counted a dozen or so in Hostiles. There are 4 to 6 here, at least.

The ""downside"" is that plot holes appear, though in service of the BIG IDEAS. So you'll notice a couple ""Why the hell did this guy do that?"" and you have to accept it, give it a bit of a pass, and buy into the overall thing that's going on, for the film to work.

Someone once told the director Sam Peckinpah after watching Straw Dogs (the original, with Dustin Hoffman), ""I didn't enjoy your film."" Peckinpah replied, ""I didn't want you to enjoy the film  I wanted you to look deeply into your own soul.""

Forest Whitaker's character was played well, as was the story line of the of Zoe Saldana.  I finally know the actor named Tom Bauer who I've seen many times before.

Bale brings a lot of depth to a character that could almost be equated with a modern-day Job.... a VERY good man who's trials are unfair & ongoing. But Harrelson.... I can only think of two other characters whom I've felt a palpable contempt & disdain for... he completely emulates & doesn't wear the piece well, but seriously seems to BECOME the heinous beast he plays, almost seeming to get pleasure from how unbelievably abhorrent & horrible he has to be. This is a dark & sad movie illuminating the plight of alot of American families in parts of the country that have seen serious economic decline & the director replicates that perfectly in the details of the house & furnishings, the neighborhood streets, the handwritten signs in the bar..... Though dark & sad, it pulls you in & a good deal to contemplate regarding the situation in general and specifically, each character's idiosyncrasies & the inevitable outcome.",1490140800,5,1205,4.770334928229665

5825818,5,B00DL47YY2,"I'm not sure why so many rate this movie at basically a ""C"" or ""C+"" level. I am a huge Christian Bale fan, and would rank this movie as one of his best performances. I'm not sure how the Academy ever missed Casey Affleck for best supporting actor either. It's not JUST another revenge movie, it's a movie about the downtrodden in this country, the victims of the changing economy, without beating you over the head with it. The revenge portion of this movie is only the setting that allows for some of the best acting you'll ever see  by a slew of fine professionals. Woody Harrelson is almost terrifying as the lead bad guy, and the rest of the movie is filled with GREAT actors, Zoe Saldana, Forest Whitaker, Sam Shepard, and others. No part is left to anything but excellent and experienced character actors. The photography sets the mood, and again, is overall excellent. When I see this movie I see a slightly different version of ""Winter's Bone""  and of equal status and quality, as well as a shared mood of the dark underbelly of modern America. Do not listen to the derogatory remarks about this Film. This is the difference between Movies and Film, make no mistake about it. This is ART versus Entertainment. It will always be in my top ten list of great American movies. And yes, it is an AMERICAN movie, and in my opinion a great one.",1488672000,21,1345,4.508196721311475

This is Oscar material that was allowed to be forgotten.  It's years old but some of the finest acting I've seen in the last decade. Beautiful cinematography is not praise enough. I would watch it again without sound just to see the play of image and color. It's not the element you expect to notice in a film like this, but it is what stands out and makes you want to watch the film repeatedly.

Overall, of the quality that Manchester by the Sea displayed. Are some of the metaphors obvious? Yes. Nevertheless, this film made me want to live more, not less. And that matters.",1488585600,,721,4.413533834586466

5825821,4,B00DL47YY2,"(Moderate Spoilers) The revenge premise in ""Out of the Furnace"" is hardly original, and it will likely give you deja vu for many films (there are definite shades of ""The Fighter""), but Christian Bale (""Russell""), on-screen brother Casey Affleck (""Rodney""), and foil Woody Harrelson (""Harlan"") jockeying for your attention with their superlative acting talents make it all one hell of a white-knuckle ride, rounded out by A-list supporting roles by Forest Whitaker, Sam Shepard, and Willem Dafoe.  And, in what may be a surprise to some, it's Harrelson who gets my vote, by a nose, for best performance in the film, which centers on two brothers (Russell and Rodney), each fighting their own demons, Russell's being alcohol and heartache and Rodney's being PTSD.  Although hard as nails on the outside, we see that Russell is both human and humane in showing the viewer that, through it all, he wears his heart on his sleeve.  In Spanish, we call this type of film ""bruta,"" which means brutal and not for the fainthearted but still very entertaining, in a machismo way (women may not go for it), so it's highly recommended for that demographic, with attractive locales in West Virginia and parts of Appalachia.  Co-produced by Leonardo DiCaprio and well-known director Ridley Scott (""Alien,"" ""Gladiator,"" ""Thelma and Louise"").",1486857600,8,1325,5.12037037037037

5826137,4,B00DL47YY2,"I am usually the first of the haters to criticize Christian Bale, as I never really thought much of him, but sometimes it just takes one performance to start to sway your mind in the other direction. Rarely do you see an actor cast in a role, that is absolutely perfect for them, but the lead role of Russell Baze fits Christian Bale like a glove. I have never seen Bale fit more easily into a role or take charge of a story the way he does here. Russell is an ex-con and the shame of his family. As Russell rots away in jail, his little brother, Rodney (Casey Affleck), has to take care of his ailing father, and try to keep Russell's wife from leaving him. When Russell finally gets out of jail, Rodney, an amateur fighter,  finally gets the chance to leave the rust belt and earn some real money. Rodney appears on his way to doing just that, when he disappears in a notoriously brutal part of the mountains, leaving his brother alone to try and do the right thing. Along the lines of Winter's Bone, Joe, & Mud, Out of The Furnace is another dark, rural thrillers, that is all the rage in Hollywood these days, and while there are a lot of wannabes and copy-cats, when someone figures out the correct formula you end up with a gem like this. The writing here is Oscar worthy and the character development is everything I crave in a film. Out of The Furnace is under two hours long, but when it's done, I feel as though I know the characters in the same was as if I'd just watched 100 episodes of some TV show. I felt their emotions, I was empathetic to their situations, and I was on the edge of my seating waiting to see what would happen next.

It requires patience, humanity, empathy, and thoughtful appreciation for character development and cinematic story telling.  A ""box office bomb"" as some have suggested this film was, is more accurately reflective of the general moving-going public than the film's shortcomings (of which, there are few).  The performances are convincing.  The raw emotion displayed by Afflect in the ""working for a living"" kitchen scene with Bale was an extraordinary performance.  Either Afflect suffers from PTSD himself, or he did an exemplary job of learning what that monstrous disorder truly feels like.  As for the many mysteries the movie supplies from beginning to end, the viewer is compelled to put themselves in the character's position in order to comprehend the scene.  Sadly, many people simply lack the wherewithal to do so.

Incredible performance by Casey Affleck as a war vet who can't stop fighting, and Christian Bale as the flawed older brother trying to watch out for him. IMO Forrest Whiticker was not utilized enough. Woody Harrelson gives a turn as a dangerous drug runner/fight promoter who crosses paths with the brothers. In the mix is choices made, prices paid, love lost, a bit of redemption. The ending seemed out of place; as if the writers got that far and didn't know how else to finish the story.

Christian Bale is perfect in this role as a guy who tries to do everything right, but his best intentions for his younger brother (Casey Affleck) always end up costing him. Affleck is really good, (I think he's a better actor than his brother,) and Woody Harrelson is amazing as a creepy, sadistic, meth-head. Throw in Sam Shepard, Willam Dafoe, Forrest Whitaker, and Zoe Saldana, and there isn't a weak performance by anyone.

5826501,4,B00DL47YY2,"Out of the Furnace has a cast of darn good actors.  Christian Slater, Casey Affleck, Willem Defoe, Woody Harrelson, Forrest Whittaker, Zoe Saldana and Sam Sheppard star.

Slater and Affleck play siblings.  Slater just out of prison presumably for vehicular manslaughter while Affleck is back from a tour in Iraq.  Affleck cannot find himself to work regular work and takes to street fighting.  Eventually he and Defoe end up in the New Jersey boonies (Appalachia) with Harrelson.

On the way back home from a fight which Affleck had to take a fall, Defoe and Affleck are killed by Harrelson and his crew.  Local law enforcement (Whittaker) claims he'll handle things and/or things are out of his hands.

Slater decides to take things into his own hands and heads with Sheppard into the uncharted territory of Redneck, NJ.  During the ""investigation"" he runs into Harrelson's goons in a crack house while looking for Harrelson.

The acting, considering the caliber of people involved, is professionally sedate.  Nothing is over the top, but that too, is how this should have been played out.  Even Whitaker, who far too often is annoying (ie, The Shield), plays his part well as not only the law, but Saldana's, Slater's former love interest, baby daddy.",1422144000,,1253,4.971153846153846

5826648,5,B00DL47YY2,"This movie ranks in my top 5 favorite, and it takes a lot for me to thoroughly like a movie to that point. Christian Bale, Casey Affleck, and Woody Harrelson all did amazing jobs in this movie - heck, the entire cast was awesome. I love stories about brotherly love and the older brother doing everything he can to protect his younger sibling. It's obvious from the get go that Christian Bale's character wants the best for his brother, and is on the lookout for him.

The family is obviously blue collar and have had their bad luck. Christian Bale and their father both work at the mill and Casey Affleck's character refuses to. He'd rather fight his way out of debt, but it's later revealed that there is more to his ""wanting"" to fight - due to what he has seen in Iraq as soldier.

I don't want to give too much away with this - Woody Harrelson plays a verrrrry bad man, but does it well. Christian Bale has his own issues he's working through, but you can tell his intentions are good and he only wants what is best for his family and his brother. Casey Affleck's part was probably the most shocking, and like I said, I don't want to spoil it for anyone who might read this review.

It's a story of revenge, family, brotherly love, and making things right. It is dark and sad at times, but definitely a thriller that will make you think days after you're done watching it.",1415491200,,1376,4.346303501945525

Out of the Furnace is a very special film in that I have not witnessed a sadder character in years that the one Bales plays in this movie.  I was 'suspended in suspence' the entire movie wondering what turn his character would take, which is where Christian Bales' talent lies.  He takes you on a ride and you have his undivided attention the whole way!  I distract myself during his films by constantly repeating to myself, ""How does he do that to me?  How can he stay in focus so completely?  How can he go from one character in one movie to a completely different character, with a different weight, accent etc. in another?""  Love CB and love all of his movies! Now, Moses????  Yes, yes!!!

5826856,2,B00DL47YY2,"Out of the Furnace should be thrown into the furnace.  Before I watched this movie I thought it was going to be good because I liked the story where Rodney Baze Jr. (Casey Affleck) mysteriously disappears and his older brother, Russell (Christian Bale), takes matters into his own hands to find justice.  First, this disappointment was written both Scott Cooper and Brad Ingelsby while it was directed by Scott Cooper.

This starts off at a drive in movie theater with Harlan DeGroat (Woody Harrelson) being very abusive to his date, one of the guys in the neighboring cars tries to do something about it but gets beat up.  Then it goes  to show you  the area that Russel and his younger brother Rodney live in.  You find out that its not the best area because Rodney is gambling to to try and break even.  Things just get worse for him though because he gets more in debt and then Russel finds himself in prison.  To try and work off his debt Rodney gets involved with some street fighting but that alone does not make enough to get his head above the water so he gets himself involved with one of the most violent crime rings, one that will cost him.

 d2

There is absolutely no flow to this film and it drove me crazy, I just wanted to throw something at the TV I was so irritated.  Russell gets into a car accident where he is very disoriented and very upset, screaming asking for help because there are people in the car that he doesn't know if they are OK or not.  The very next scene he is in prison... WHAT THE HELL!  Why not start the movie off with him in prison instead of giving us a little bit  of him with his brother before hand and then a car accident??  As an audience we can put it together that they are brothers and love each other based off of their interactions they have when Rodney comes to visit Russel we didn't need the first twenty minutes building up to that its just a waste.  That isn't event the tip of the iceberg of things that annoyed me in this movie though.  His entire prison stay was three scenes that lasted a total of 7 minutes of the film so why even have that at all???  You could easily get the same point across by just starting when he got out of prison and giving us the story from there.  Having chopped scenes leading up to him getting out of prison did two things for me, 1. I started to lose interest in the film because it started annoying me and 2.  I lost where the story was because it wasn't being told smoothly.  I don't want to give away anything for those who want to see the film so I won't tell anymore about it but the rest of the film is the same way very choppy and hard to follow.

The best thing about this film was Casey Afflecks performance he did a very good job as a person suffering from PTSD and he shows it when he gets up in Christian Bale's face.  I don't know what they were thinking when Zoe Saldana was cast because I think she is amazing and her character was highly underused.  Woody Harrelson did do a good job at being the villain in this film from the first scene all the way until the end he embraces the character.  These are a group of some really good actors but I feel that because the story and the way it was put together they couldn't shine to their full potential.

Overall this movie is not one I would recommend seeing and it gets a D.  With the fact that it doesn't flow makes the story really hard to follow which just made me lose interest in the film.  That is unfortunate because I was really looking forward to seeing this.  Don't waste your time watching this because there are so many other films that are better than this that you can enjoy.

He has a little of Mickey Knox from Natural Born Killers in him. Bale shows emotion and plays the opposite from the crazy tough guy,selfish roles you usually see him in.

5827009,5,B00DL47YY2,"Out of the Furnace is a brilliantly artistic movie, but it's not an easy movie to watch. A lot of filmmakers aspire to dark and gritty, but few really capture the despair and dysfunction of the white rural underclass. As someone who grew up around bikers, cholos and white trash hippies (the kind who are more into drugs and thievery than peace and love) I have a seen countless movies where the criminals are white washed, maybe to make them more believable to people who don't know the subculture.  Director Scott Cooper either really knows this class of peopleor he really did do his homework.  The only other movie that I can think of that so correctly depicted rural criminality and poverty is Winters Bones.

Christian Bale plays Russell Baze, an honest, nose-to-the-grindstone steel worker living in Pennsylvania with his pre-school teacher girlfriend Lena (Zoe Saldana). His brother Rodney (Casey Afleck) is a troubled Iraq War veteran addicted to high risk activities. He loses big betting on horses and fights in underground bare-knuckle MMA style matches to pay his debts. Hes supposed to throw the first match we see him fighting in.  Local bar owner and hustler John Petty had money on Rodneys opponent. Rodney was supposed to throw the fight to pay off his to Petty, but suffering from PTSD, he loses control and beats his opponent into the ground. Petty is upset that Russell didn't follow directions, but understands the younger mans problems.

 Knowing that his brother is spiraling downward, Russell goes to Pettys bar to pay off part of his Rodneys debt. Before seeing Petty he had a couple beers. After he pays Petty the hustler gives him a glass of hard alcohol. On the way home he is looks down at the radio for a brief second, but that is time enough for a car to pull out in front of his pickup. He hits the car, totaling it. He rushes to the aid of the driver, only to find a dead child in the backseat. We next see Russell in prison where he tries to keep his head down and do his time. But during his incarceration Lena leaves him and his sickly father dies.  The only contact he has with the outside world is the visits of his brother Rodney.

When Russell gets out of prison he moves in with Rodney in his fathers house. He gets his old job back and starts fixing up the house. He finds out that Lena has moved in with Wesley Barnes (Forest Whitaker) the local police chief. He wants her back but gives up on that when he finds out that she is pregnant with Barness child. Russell goes deer hunting with his uncle Gerald (Sam Shepherd). He cant bring himself to take the shot, but his uncle gets a deer, and the two bond over skinning and dressing the animal.

Meanwhile, Rodney has pressured John Petty to set up a fight for him with a group of criminals in rural New Jersey. The group is lead by a fierce backwoods criminal named Harlan DeGroat (Woody Harrelson).  Petty is clearly scared of DeGroat and tries to talk Rodney out of it. Rodney won't take no and eventually Petty gives in and sets up a match. But things turn bad and DeGroat murders John Petty and Rodney Baze, not realizing that Pettys phone what connected to a recording device.

Chief Barnes notifies that John Perry was murdered and Rodney is assumed dead as well. But Russell refuses to believe that his brother is dead. He and Uncle Gerald go to New Jersey, into the belly of the rural underclass, to track down DeGroat. They find him, but before they can act they are confronted by a local police officer who knows who they are and what they want. Instead of arresting them he escorts them to the state line. Russell agrees to let the police handle things. Eventually though, the police bungle the arrest of DeGroat. The criminal has eluded them. So Russell embarks on a plan to lure DeGroat back to Pennsylvania.

I won't give away the ending. I will say that this movie is blesses with a wonderful cast, great writing and superb direction. Its a great movie, but for many it won't be an easy movie to watch.",1407542400,,4012,4.533886583679115

5827011,4,B00DL47YY2,"The steel town working mans America washed out palette evokes comparisons with The Deerhunter in this compelling and gritty drama.  The performances are certainly in the same ballpark, intense and utterly believable, but ultimately its hard not to feel that the movie feels a little hollow by comparison.  It just doesnt seem to about anything more than convincingly portray the milieu and the characters.  Convince it does though, with Christian Bale inhabiting the blue collar steel worker trying to make ends meet  he has the beautiful girlfriend (Zoe Zaldana who is a little underused here  this is a story about the men.), and he has family and is making ends meet.  His brother has returned from Iraq physically untouched but mentally and emotionally scarred.  Its clear he has not found the balance in his life  and his descent into the world of bare knuckle boxing to alleviate gambling debts eventually drags his brother
Believability really is the order of the day, with everyone concerned (Harrelson and Whitaker as well as Bale and Casey Affleck) at the top of their game.  The production design and photography really nails the atmosphere, too.  So what of the story  well it is compelling while you watch the drama unfold, even when the ending grows increasingly predictable or inevitable.  A more modern kinetic style is eschewed for old fashioned slow burn storytelling  - and the movie and viewer benefit from this.  The director has stated his desire to immerse the viewer in his movies, and you will feel immersed here for sure.  All of this makes a worthwhile watch  but it fails by a long chalk to reach 5 star territory by just not having a strong enough reason for being.  Theres a thin line between balance in life and a spiral descent into despair or catastrophe, the movie seems to say, but it doesnt seem to say much else.  If the mise-en-scene and acting are masterclass, the story seems screenplay 101 by comparison.  I guess there is a thin line between good drama and classic drama, too.  Still, for a moody tale well told, well acted, well shot and well directed we shouldnt quibble, this is still worthy of recommendation.",1407542400,,2155,4.836065573770492
5827012,3,B00DL47YY2,"'Out of the Furnace' is the story of Russell Blaze (Christian Bale), a Pennsylvania steelworker in a decaying Rust Belt town at the dawn of the Great Recession. Russell represents upright working class masculinity. He regularly works a double-shift and knows how to throw a punch and aim a hunting rifle. He visits his ailing father every day, pays off the gambling debts of his unstable Iraq-war veteran brother, Rodney (Casey Affleck), and stoically accepts the consequences of his actions. Following a tragic accident, Russell's world begins to fall apart, culminating in a showdown with hillbilly crime lord Harlan DeGroat (Woody Harrelson), who is more of a force of nature than a villain.

The characters are iconic, if a little cliched. Their actions seem guided more by fate than their own choices, perhaps a commentary on the condition of the working poor in America. This gave the plot a forced feeling at times. Director Scott Cooper wrings strong performances out of his all-star cast, which also includes Forest Whitaker, Willem Dafoe, Sam Sheppard and Zo Saldana.

Very little here is ""predictable""; furthermore, what is ""predictable"" is pulled off with aplombby a talented director who stays clear of cliches.

5827054,4,B00DL47YY2,"Bale, as usual, is great in this. This is an ensemble cast that really works. The film's a dark one, so keep that in mind. It will certainly have you biting your fingernails to their nubs.",1407110400,,188,4.25
5827055,5,B00DL47YY2,"I went in to this movie picturing it as a heavy action thriller, judging only by the cover, Christian Bale's typical movies that I love, and the director who I also love.  I couldn't have been more off.  This movie is definitely a drama at its core.  That being said, I loved this movie and was not in the least bit disappointed.

The most engaging part of this movie is by far the amazing acting.  Christian Bale never disappoints but in this one he really shines.  I could just watch his character, Russell, go through everyday mundane things and I'd be completely satisfied, but of course things change throughout and we watch him react to all the difficulties this life has to offer.  The best comparison I can make is to Breaking Bad and I think its a fair one.  For fans of the show they will definitely see what I mean when watching this movie.

Just as much of a joy to watch is Casey Affleck.  He does a spectacular job in his portrayal of a war vet suffering from PTSD.  It is from him that we get the most emotional scenes and wow does he do an awesome job.  Love him or hate him, in this movie you won't be able to stop yourself from caring about what happens to him.

Yet another top notch character is Woody Harrelson as Harlen.  Right from the beginning we hate Harlen in the best possible way.  We see what he's capable of and for some reason can't look away any time he's on the screen.  It makes me wonder if anyone alive today could be so heartless and cruel, but Harrelson does such an amazing job that while watching this movie he seems plucked straight from reality.

The story-line plods along slowly throughout, but that being said, that is precisely what lends to such a stunning ending.  If you're thinking things are going too slow just take a deep breath and relax, enjoy the amazing display of near perfect acting skill and enjoy it for the genius that it is.  If the story went faster we wouldn't understand why things happen the way they do when we get to the end and we certainly couldn't be so connected that we feel the most intense rush of emotion possible for a make-believe character.

Conclusion
Over all I would say that everyone should go into this movie knowing that they are watching a drama.  Anyone looking for a fast paced action flick will certainly feel disappointed and maybe even bored at times.  If you are in the mood for a amazing drama however, watch this movie, there are none better and it will hit that cinematic sweet spot.

I won't even begin to give any spoilers, just suffice to say, it has action, drama, sorrow and a good story line.  Maybe not a movie for everyone as there is a bit of blood and such in it.. but again.. if you like action and drama this is for you.",1407024000,,394,3.9

But this is not a revenge flick. It is also not a thriller.
This is a drama about dysfunctional relationships.
The ""revenging"" doesn't happen until the last 20 minutes of the film... and it's a let down.

Don't watch this expecting a ""Death Sentence"" style revenge movie. It's a blue-collar drama about two brothers trying to get by.

5827355,4,B00DL47YY2,"This is an extremely underrated film.  I agreed with the general ""great acting, mediocre plot"" consensus after watching it the first time.  But something told me I was missing something deeper after finishing it.  So I watched it again, and I loved it.  This is not your standard ""revenge movie"".  This film, set in the backdrop of Great Recession era America, is about loyalty and inner torment.  You get to see the realities of the mental effects that numerous tours of duty in the middle east are having on combat troops when they return home.

Needless to say the acting is superb.  Woody Harrelson is a menacing, meth addicted, backwoods crime boss.  He was absolutely fantastic villain which was a surprise for me, as I'm used to the Roy Munson/Billy Hoyle comedy Woody.",1405382400,2,776,4.774436090225564

5827358,4,B00DL47YY2,"Out of the Furnace is a raw, heart-felt drama with some harsh twists and satisfying violence.  Not an action flick.  In fact, this film is pretty slow.  In this way--and because of the terrific performances--Out of the Furnace is quite realistic.

Be aware that this is not the feel-good movie of the year, nor is it too depressing to watch. It is gritty and a bit dark--like its two PA and NJ settings.  It's a movie about hard people having hard times and clashing with hard criminals.  The end is appropriate and leaves you with some questions and speculations.

The only issue I have is that--being familiar with Jersey--I am not sure this movie portrays the impoverished, semi-rural people properly.  I don't remember any hillbilly mountain justice tales coming out of Jersey.  LOL.  But Jersey has a LOT more strange and ""country-ish"" areas than you might expect.  Pick up a ""Weird New Jersey"" book or magazine and you will get the idea.

Good film, if you have the patience to enjoy slow development, superb performances, and gritty, realistic experiences.",1405036800,,1063,4.877094972067039
5827359,4,B00DL47YY2,Gory violent beautiful slow movie... great story but was 30 minutes too long... those who want action and adventure look elsewhere.,1405036800,,131,5.285714285714286
5827360,3,B00DL47YY2,"There is so much to like in this movie but some bad decisions bring it down.

Here's the scoop. Christian Bale plays a Pennsylvania steel worker. His brother (Casey Affleck) is back from 3 tours in Iraq He fights in underground fights to make money. Bale spends time in the joint on a DUI and Casey takes a fight overseen by a real sleazeball (Woody Harrelson) in New Jersey. Things go way South.

This is a real shame. The acting is generally very good. Bale has an interesting character. He lives in a rough world but is a genuinely good guy who loves his family. Affleck is good as well. He needed a few more scenes to really shine. Harrelson is really greazy. He's a meth freak with a mean streak and I wouldn't want to be anywhere near him. The proverbial bomb waiting to explode. Sam Shepard, Zoe Saldana and Forest Whitaker all needed more lines, but the did well with what they had.

Some scenes are written extremely well while others are really clunky. Likewise, the directing is uneven. Some scenes are spot on while others just don't work. And some of the symbolism is regrettably heavy handed to boot. People can complain about the ending and I can't say I'd argue. Something missed the mark there. I liked the music score a lot and some of the location shots really added to the overall mood.

This is a bit better than the three stars I gave it but it could have been great. Do see it. It won't waste your time.",1405036800,,1426,4.390151515151516

We both enjoyed this movie,  and I was surprised by how much I liked the story line (I don't remember ever seeing the previews for this movie). Can't really say anything else without spoiling it for others. Christian Bale, in my opinion, is an outstanding actor.

5827363,3,B00DL47YY2,3 stars is a very generous rating. I give it because of the strong lineup of actors but this movie has so much in its storyline that it's just thrown at you with no context. Events are mentioned or briefly shown but are never really explored and this pattern leaves this movie feeling thin. This storyline would have made a good TV series much like The Killing and the story and characters could have been developed and made more interesting.,1404864000,,442,4.5375
5827404,3,B00DL47YY2,"This movie isn't as good as Winters Bone or Joe or Mud. It has the southern grit if those films, the drama, and moodiness but is missing a bit of southern authenticity. But the plot is slow a bit like the film Joe. But this film is pretty boring, it didn't hold my attention like winters bone or Mudd. It's the slowest of the 4 films. It doesn't hold as much emotional weight as the other 3 films, the acting is good but the plot is thin, script is thin, mood is too slow. The first hour does little for the film, the expressionistic shots don't help the film like winters bone. The preview to this film looked amazing, but it wasn't. Like a not as good rehash of Deer Hunter. Wasted talent of some of my favorite stars. They're great actors but they lack the true soul and charm of the south, the soul and charm/vibe of the south in the films winters bone, mud and joe were captured more realistically than this film.",1404777600,,918,4.251428571428572

Someone else who reviewed this movie said that the ending was ""predictable"".  However I think the exact opposite is true.  There are many ways that it could have ended.

5827551,4,B00DL47YY2,"I am giving four stars because I liked it more than I expected.  The trailers don't tell the entire story as I thought they would with the movie just adding in the details.  But Christian Bale shows again just how talented he is.  Aside from crazy train Woody (not that the meth problem isn't everywhere, too; it is), the elements of the Baze family situation are all too common and happening all over the US to more and more people and not just in the lower classes.  So, it comes down to having your family if that is something good in your life.  If that is taken away, what do you even have to get up for in the morning?  And Sam Shepard just keeps showing up in these movies, adding his bit of backwards charm.  I am afraid I relate quite a bit to Russell's situation (psychologically), and yes, it sucks.  And these cities and towns exist all over the U.S.  David Simon wrote about West Baltimore with The Wire (but he was writing about it back in the 90s with Homicide), and it's true all over West Virginia, PA, and going west.  The same thing happened in the South when Wal-Mart would come to town.  Not much left but to work and shop at the Wal-Mart at the outskirts and no little downtown with a movie theatre or soda shop to hang out.  The circumstances of the car accident seemed questionable to me, but (I thought maybe he was set up; and if not, why did that driver pull out into the road at that time of night with a child?); but likely a wealthy person would have had a different result with the justice system.  It's Two Americas now.  And this is a movie about the the majority--time to wake up and get what we've earned and invested BACK.  The poor fight our wars, the poor go to prison, the poor suffer just for being poor.  That's not how the US is set up to work in the Constitution.  And really, that's what this movie is about more than anything:  one town among many, lost and forgotten in these United States.",1403913600,,1936,4.271978021978022

5827553,5,B00DL47YY2,"The acting superb. Chock full of great actors, all doing star-quality acting jobs and not vying for best prima donna - the acting is more like excellent character actors (not stars), than of stars. A refreshing subtlety to the acting that allowed emotion and story line to shine through. Raw view of a facet of American life, controlled good-vs.-evil, and even enough action/violence to please action junkies (but enough to disturb those more sensitive to violence). Oddly, as much as I appreciated the film, I did not really connect with it on the next day when I tried to re-watch it. I think that it is because I was so engaged and able to follow it the first time (it is archetypical dying-small-steel-town setting familiar to anyone from the Rust Belt) that I just did not want to focus.

5827663,3,B00DL47YY2,"There is something about Scott Cooper's film, ""Out of the Furnace"", that perpetually niggles away at the back of the mind, making you feel all of the time that it could somehow have been so much better.  And yet I for one could not put my finger in just what it is. Perhaps it is no one thing, but a combination of many, all of them interconnected.

There is much about the film that is, superficially at least, reminiscent of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Deer-Hunter-1978/dp/B000J20CVG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Deer Hunter [1978</a>]"", with its mix of combat fatigue, world weariness and self-destructive leanings of broken men. It also shares some of the earlier movie's iconic screen moments, which it is hard to believe are coincidental. But the comparison does the film no favours: Christian Bale, good as he is, is no Robert De Niro; the action is so slow-moving as to be glacial and the storyline takes so many sideways hops it is often unclear just what its real message is meant to be.

In summary, then, this is not a bad movie, but neither is it a great one. It is a slow-paced movie, and a depressing movie, and one that feels to have nothing new to bring to the party. And yet, it is oddly compelling and also, in an weird sort of way, almost likeable.",1403136000,,1317,4.896860986547085

The performances by Christina Bale, the amazingly nasty Woody Harrelson,  and Casey Affleck, and the rest of the incredible cast, Sam Sheppard, Forrest Whittaker, Zoe Saldana, Willem Dafoe, were sharp, smart, and moving.

It's dark a and compelling enough to be scary.  Christian Bale is painfully convincing as a working man whose world is hopelessly falling apart around him.  Perhaps the most pleasant surprise is Casey Affleck as a self destructive adrenaline addicted Iraq War veteran.  These and other good performances are woven into a tale about a family forced into making the best of bad decisions.  Due to the direction and caliper of the cast, the film doesn't seem contrived or preachy.  Watching this movie is more like sharing someone else's bad memory.",1402358400,,712,4.932773109243698

5827705,1,B00DL47YY2,"Okay, so the trailers for this  movie make it look friggin' awesome!  It looks like we have two brothers, one who is trying to live a normal life and one who is into underground fighting for profit.  The fighter gets into trouble and the hard working brother has to take the law into his own hands and go and save him.  That's kinda what happens but it's so boring and takes so long that you'll lost interest in it before you get to any action.

Plus you really mean to tell me that this cop is actually telling this guy that the police won't go after this group of rednecks because they are too pyscho and violent?  If that's the case, you call in the state troopers or if that doesn't work the, the case is a murder, therefore it'll pop up on the FBI's radar so you could probably call them in to help you.

Not to mention that at the end when we FINALLY get some sort of climax, Christian Bale's character has a rifle trained on his brother's killer and the one cop in town is watching while he does this, and just tells him not to do it.  Okay look, if someone is pointing a gun at someone else, I'm pretty sure that a cop has the authorization to shoot that person in order to keep the other person safe.

This movie had Casey Affleck, Christian Bale, and Woody Harrelson in it.  But even that cast of talented individuals couldn't save this movie and make it enjoyable.  And frankly after watching it, I'm not surprised that it bombed at the box office.

Don't waste your time or your money, don't buy this and don't even rent it for a dollar at the Redbox.  Go watch a good movie instead.",1402185600,4,1595,4.224422442244224

The younger brother is in 'fight club' mode for most of the movie and somehow manages to stand up after taking beating after beating. There is no human way to do this. But...since actors are such studs with the camera rolling - this happens time and time again. Actors must think they are so tough after doing these kind of movies - yeah right!! No one could stand such blows. No one. Can you imagine an actor in real life getting pummeled in the face - I think they'd be whining about their career while trying to call 911 and their lawyer.

I won't go into WH's character in full, but he is way over cooked, to say the least. Made to look evil in every possible way, the things he does and gets away with are cases the Feds would be on in a heartbeat.

5827770,4,B00DL47YY2,"Another dark veteran story, partly reminiscent of the Deer Hunter, the 70s epos about the Vietnam War with Walken, de Niro and Streep.
This one is about a later war. Casey Affleck is the ruined Iraq returner who can't find his way back into normal life. Normal life isn't normal anyway. His family background is blue collar, steel factories in Pennsylvania. There is unemployment. The outlook is miserable. The young man gambles and runs into debt. He wants to pull himself out of his deep ditch and becomes a fist fighter for money. This leads him into deadly dealings with an evil rural gangster, played by Woody Harrelson.
The hero of the story is Christian Bale's character, the selfless brother, who tries his hardest to keep the young man solid. He fails and goes for revenge. We find ourselves in an industrial kind of Western, with a shoot out in a steel yard railway system.
The film has strong scenes and a wonderful cast, but something is lacking. The plot is a little too predictable. Bale's character is a little too heroic and selfless. Harrelson is a little too disgusting and bad. All in all you could do worse than spend the time for this film, but there is more 'like' than 'love' here.
Bale is impressive. This film was shot at about the same time as American Hustle, where Bale is a fat greasy con man. Here he is a skinny gritty working class hero. The man has breadth.",1401062400,,1390,4.564

It was just okay for me.
I think most of the movie was a little slow-paced, and it didn't really pick up until the end. Sadly, not soon enough though.
The idea of it being loosely based on the old adage, an eye for an eye, wasn't for me either. It's been done too many times to count, so in order for it to stand out it needs to be impeccably done.
The ending as I said was different and what I liked most about the film. Don't think it was because it was finally ending, though honestly, that helped too. I was over it at that point. The last of the movie was really gritty, and if you read my blog regularly, that's kinda what I'm into. I don't want fluff, I want blood and gore. What can I say?!

While the plot is not entirely unlike others, there is something about the rawness of the acting and the rawness of the landscapes, that makes Out of the Furnace one very good slow searing burn of a film, a cut above all of the rest that contain similar elements.  The movie is raw, downright raw, and brutal, so much so that you can absolutely feel the desperation and heartbreak of traditional Americana.  It feels authentic and real, and through visuals and some first rate dialogue, captures an image of old America that is crumbling to its foundations.  The beautiful America we once knew is disappearing, and Out of the Furnace captures is as perfectly as one can envision.

  The acting is just tremendous, and the movie's slow burn to the climactic showdown betwen Baze and Degroat feels like someone just lit a match poured some gasoline in it, and shoved it down your throat.

Their mother is dead, their father is dying from age/sickness.

Forest Whitaker, local cop and Zoe's current boyfriend. Sam Shepard is Christian's uncle. Willem Dafoe is the local bookie. Now for the 2 standout performances, drum roll please, Woody Harrelson is THE bad guy, runs a street fighting kind of thing in NJ. Truly a nasty piece of garbage...plays it so well.

5828055,5,B00DL47YY2,"I just love a movie with good characters and good actors playing them.  Very seldom, it seems to me, does a movie match the all-star cast that is in it.  In ""Out of the Furnace"", Willem Dafoe, Casey Affleck, Sam Shepard, Forest Whitaker, Woody Harrellson, and especially Christian Bale deliver in this excellent dystopian tale of revenge for a brother's killer.  Bale plays the role of the blue-collar older brother, working and living in a darkly-filmed steel town with no future, in a seemingly amoral, hopeless world, who is recently out of prison on a vehicular manslaughter conviction, on the hunt for the sociopathic killer (Woody Harrellson) who killed his troubled, bare-knuckled fighting brother, brilliantly played by Casey Affleck - (Gone Baby, Gone"").  Bale loves the dark moody pictures; if you have not seen him in ""The Machinist"", and how he starved himself to play the role of a guilt-ridden man who killed a young boy in a moment of distracted driving, or in ""The Illusionist,"" then you might not truly understand the depth of this man's commitment to his art.  The scene where his ex-girlfriend tells him she is pregnant with another man's child, after Bale's character had unsuccessfully tried to talk her into having a baby with him, is priceless in and of itself, and says so much about Bale's ability as an actor, and Coopers ability and discretion as a director, many of whom would have had a lot of screaming and yelling in that scene.  This is not a movie for the meek, or the impatient; director Scott Cooper takes his time and allows the plot to develop slowly, especially taking the time to flesh out the character of the younger brother, as played by Affleck, who suffers from PTSD and fights his own demons, in both a literal and figurative fashion.  A dark, riveting movie, for those who enjoy serious drama, and serious acting ability, it will keep you firmly entrenched in your seat and possibly have you thinking, ""Oscar nominations - but how many actors from one film can get one?""  While trying to avoid a spoiler, I will tell you that the final scene, as stated in part by Director Cooper himself, is intended to demonstrate that there are all kinds of prisons.",1399766400,6,2198,4.765789473684211

With the exception of Forest Whitaker, the cast was excellent. Whitaker just didn't sell the role of the love rival or sheriff. Everyone else was as gritty, human, and real -in their own way- as you or me. You could imagine that they all live out there somewhere.

Some people complained about the long, wordless scenes. I thought those were effective. It was the writing and directing that made this less than the stellar movie it could have been. It's disjointed. There is no flow to connect them. You have a love scene, an accident, jail, a break-up (for example) that gives you juice in each one, but they land like separate events. They don't appear to have happened to the same people. You don't get the full impact of these things. This happens for the scenes in one person's life as well as interpersonally, meaning that what happens to one person doesn't particularly show the effect for those around him/her (like apparently the girlfriend really loves Bales yet you never get a sense of why she made the choices she did. That is important. It fleshes out the story and makes you care).

Then you have this really jacked up ending. Whitaker is saying something like, ""Put the gun down. Don't do it"" when Bale is just standing there with a rifle in his hands. He's not aiming or even behaving in a threatening way. He looks pretty calm, cool, and collected. I couldn't tell that he was thinking about killing anybody. He had just shot him twice in the leg and let him run. If anything, I thought the sheriff was saying those things so that he could kill Bales and make it look like Bales was threatening either him or the Harrelson. It just didn't play sincerely. When the ending is that messed up, I can only give a film 3 stars. The acting was fine, however. Just wasted.

5828176,3,B00DL47YY2,"Sometimes you look at these small films that fly under the radar with reasonable reviews and find yourself a real gem.  They have powerful narratives and ample actors and they carry with them a pedigree that seems ripe for the taking, and the under the radar aspect only heightens the glisten when it really does pull something special off.  I had those high hopes for this film going in.  I love the ensemble, or at least generally respect them, and the trailer had me really excited.  The good notices yet no awards traction bolstered my anticipation because it felt like one of those small movies that had a lot to offer yet was unfairly disregarded or overlooked.

And ever since 2007 Ive been waiting for Casey Affleck to just become a really big deal.

I just want to address something that has felt like a really big issue with 2013 films in particular.  Maybe Im just being picky or overly sensitive to something, but for me this year has had its fair share of films with issues regarding the passage of time.  I found this particularly distracting in 12 Years a Slave and this film had the same issues.  Couple that with a real pacing problem and Out of the Furnace nearly burns off all its fuel not even halfway in.  The story itself is compelling, sort of, but overall the film feels extremely bogged down by a real storytelling problem.  The first half of the film seems to be centered on building up to a specific crux that we all knew was coming from the films advertising (brother goes missing, other brother gets mad) but in the process it just wastes so much character development in this swift passage of time.

I need to take a breath and elaborate.

The film opens with working man Russell plugging along at life with a hard job, a sick father, a wayward brother and a beautiful girlfriend who seems to make everything manageable.  His brother, Rodney, has a gambling problem and borrows too much, but Russells standup reputation saves his brother from too much consequence.  Then Russell gets drunk and makes a reckless decision that costs him years in prison.  In those years (that pass by in a few minutes) his brother goes to war, his father dies and his girlfriend leaves him for a cop.  Then Russell is a free man trying to pick up pieces of a faltered life.  His ex-girlfriend is now pregnant and his brother, back from the way with too many memories, is street fighting to pay off gambling debts.

Then stuff happens and Russell finds himself in search of his brother and a backwoods (literal) gangster named Harlan DeGroat.

My issue is this; the film was so concerned with getting to this final half (the search for Rodney) that the entire first half, which could have been so ripe with actual character development, feels rushed and underwritten.  It all feels like a cluttered and lazy way to throw a bunch of characters and situations at us without ever really developing anything, to the point where it all feels unnecessary.  Some of the actors are horribly underused, especially Zoe Saldana, and the tonal shift to revenge thriller in the films second half seems to make the first half feel like a different movie.

The first half is also the far more interesting movie, despite being poorly filmed.

But beyond the pacing issues, the storytelling problems and the tonal uncertainty, the film offers us a really respectable cast that anchors the film and does their best to reel us in.  Affleck is easily the standout, full of a ferocity that makes every aspect of this character so compelling.  I honestly wish the entire film had been about his character, ending right in the middle where he goes missing, because he was all I thought about the whole time.  It isn't that Bale is bad here, because hes actually very good, but Russell is easily the least interesting character in the film.  Harrelson is ruthless and chews the scenery brilliantly, and the softer shades of Sam Shepard, Willem Dafoe and Forest Whitakers performances really help make this ensemble sing.

I just really, really wish this had been a better film.

Its beautiful to look at (the lighting captures so much), but Scott Coopers script is so ridiculously underdeveloped and misguided that it takes the wind out of every sail.  The film just deflates on impact, and by the time its over its completely forgotten.",1398643200,2,4323,4.686092715231788
5828177,3,B00DL47YY2,Bale and Harrelson phoned it in.  Casey Affleck makes the film worth the watch.  Sad seeing an actor like Forrest Whittaker take such low level roles.,1398643200,,150,4.730769230769231

5828179,3,B00DL47YY2,"This movie is all about Bale's performance coupled with the PA steel-town backdrop. Casey Affleck has a small but powerful performance as a troubled vet. I think his anger about facing the reality of working an ordinary job is a common issue with most young males. Affleck really captures this frustration and the destructive answer his character chooses. Christian Bale's character is a flawed individual with a dutiful purpose of family, work and his love interest. However, no good deed goes unpunished and he eventually is victimized by the brutal steel town environment. The cinematography of the town, steel mill and woods are documentary style. I like the choice of having PJ's ""Release Me"" for the score and it does compliment the photography. I did think 'out of the furnace' would have a more heart wrenching effect and was sad to find out that it was a little flat on delivering emotional effects on me as a viewer. Harrelson's role is disturbing and he does make up for this flat emotional tone set throughout the film. Christian Bale could have been the cause of this flatness of feeling and emotion. Or, the story itself is a little flat since the outcome of the story is not what a viewer anticipates going into the film. OOTF does make you question the heroism of individuals in real life and the inability of people able to establish themselves as heroes with society's constraints.",1398556800,2,1399,4.833333333333333
5828180,4,B00DL47YY2,"With an all star cast this is a production that has `promise' written all over it but is actually not greater than the sum of its parts. It is set in a depressed part of America referred to as `the rust belt' by the production team. Christian Bale plays Russell Baze who works at the local steel works like his daddy before him. Younger brother Rodney (Casey Affleck) just wants out and has joined the army to escape the hum drum existence of small town USA.

On his return Russell has landed up in prison for a terrible twist of circumstance. Rodney meanwhile has got involved with the world of underground bare knuckle fighting in order to pay off his debts. Problem is this is a world dominated by the likes of Harlan DeGroat - played by an as ever excellent Woody Harrelson. He is the sort of guy that would give you nightmares and he don't take prisoners. Throw into the mix some very unsavoury characters a small but very good part for Willem Dafoe and a caring cop - Forest Whitaker, and you have what should be a more than satisfying crime thriller.

The thing is this should have been excellent - even the music is done by Dickon Hinchliffe (ex of `Tindersticks') and adds excellent mood and pace, but it is still just above pedestrian in places. I think this could be down to the plot which will hold scant few surprises albeit with a few twists along the way. The acting is often from the `mumbling is acting' school, which just makes people hard to understand and some of the on screen antics require a bit too much faith on the part of the viewer. Still this is far from a bad film and is more than adequate to keep you entertained on an evening's video choice and if you are a fan of any of the main stars you will not be let down by their performances.",1398556800,,1767,4.319277108433735

There are no giant space robots, or superheroes, or guys who can outshoot and outfight 30 men with just 5 bullets and one arm. This is a tale of two brothers from the poor side of town and the influences and every day despair they deal with in their despondent lives. There is true evil, deliciously done by Woody Harrelson and Christian Bale is, as usual, marvelous as the everyman who loves his brother and finds justice, at the expense of his own soul perhaps, for his fallen brother.  It feels real, without the usual Hollywood pretentiousness found in most vapid movies today. The script may not stand out, but the acting, esp. from Bale and Harrelson does.

The steel mill, the characters and more pay homage to Cimino's ""Deerhunter"". Harrelson's performance as the totally ammoral and violent badman in the opening scene is just the start of many cracking portrayals.

I did.  I was just expecting more from it.  Aside from Casey Afflecks character ***spoiler alert*** dying relatively early on in the film, which was surprising (the preview made it seem as if Christian Bale went out on a suicide mission to save his brother), most of the movie was fairly predictable and drawn out.

I think that this movie did not get what it deserved, at least its cast.
Christian Bale, Woody Harrelson and Casey Affleck are just great, deserving some
kind of recognition (you hear that Academy). The movie also has Sam Shepard, Willem Dafoe, and  Forest Whitaker among others. So you know that quality of acting is
guaranteed. Photography is also great.
Unfortunately the plot is nothing unusual, a rather simple story of things gone wrong and of revenge, with a rather problematic ending.
Still, it was a great movie.

just understand them. I mean talking slowly and quietly with a heavy deep rural

I don't know that I will ever watch it again, but it is one of the better movies I have watched in recent memory. It won't make you feel good, is mostly lacking in humor (although there is a touch of sardonic humor in the movie), and will leave you feeling sad and somewhat introspective.

However, all of these subjects are dealt with better, in a more interesting or entertaining fashion, in other movies.

Deep down, it's really a character study and examines the lives of people in a Pennsylvanian steel town. The two principal characters are Russell and Rodney Baze (Bale & Affleck, respectively). One is a down-to-earth, unassuming guy just trying to make an honest living, while the other is a former soldier who feels that his country has let him down. One thing the movie does really well is establish the relationships between the characters, and the one between Russell and Rodney rings especially true. However, the choices of one leads the other one down a path that he might have preferred to stay off of. There's also a rather impressive supporting casts, with turns by Willem Dafoe, Forrest Whitaker and Zoe Saldana. However, these supporting characters are never really given their due. But the best performance, aside from Bale and Affleck, is given by Woody Harrelson as a drug-addled, boozing, backwoods and generally malcontent criminal who runs an illegal fight operation (and a crackhouse). Despite his limited screen time, he manages to give a full-bodied performance of someone who just doesn't care about anyone but himself. Very nihilistic, selfish, grimy, dirty, unlikeable, etc. Of all the supporting cast who don't really show up a lot, him not showing up as much makes some sense. It doesn't really take much time to get a sense of who he is as a character. Other positives include some gorgeous cinematography and the direction by Scott Cooper is competent, if unremarkable.

It was pretty dirty and messy...and at times a bit depressing, but it had a very authentic, true-to-life flavor about it, and was gripping and very fun to watch (at times through your fingers). Some reviewers have noted that the plot was pretty transparent and predictable, which I definitely didn't find to be the case. But even if it was, some of the greatest movies ever made had very simple, real life story lines. If a movie is well written and acted, there is no need for huge sweeping Tarantino'esque plot twists. This baby is definitely worth a watch.

how they deal with life's challanges. Casey Afleck's character did an amazing job as the young ""hot-headed""
brother to Christian Bale's ""Serious,mellow"" Older brother"" character. yes, it becomes violent at the VERY
END. This movie showed a lot of the town of Braddock,PA....I did notice in this Working Class town there
lies the everyday struggle of people just trying to survive with lifes ups and downs. I would recommend this
 movie to folks who can understand the struggle of ""when all is gone...do what you gotta do"" to
make it right. Russel Baze (Cristian Bale) loses his father,brother and the love of his life in this

5828923,4,B00DL47YY2,"Out of the Furnace is a very convincing look into the blue-collar, low-income life of a small Pennsylvania town where a local steel mill provides the area's premiere source of employment. Christan Bale, Corey Affleck, Willem Dafoe, Forest Whitaker, and Woody Harrelson star as the ensemble cast.

Russell Baze (Christian Bale) is a quiet, soft-spoken steel mill laborer who leads a simple life. Russell looks out for his Army Vet brother, Rodney Baze (Casey Affleck), who supports himself through underground, no-holds-barred fighting matches. Things go sour after Rodney fails to payoff his fight promoter, John Petty (Willem Dafoe). Russell meets with John in his office. The pair share a couple of drinks and Russell pays off his younger brother's debt. On the way home a sedan backs out of a driveway and is broadsided by Russell's truck. Russell kills both passengers, one being a little boy. He is sentenced to prison for vehicular manslaughter.

The film doesn't go into much detail as to what occurs behind bars. Russell catches an obligatory beat-down after being accosted by another inmate. Rodney pays his raccoon-eyed, jailbird brother a visit, and informs him that their old-man has passed away. Just when things can't get any worse, Russell's girl leaves him for his hometown's sheriff (Forest Whitaker). A scene shows Russell getting inked up to commemorate his sorrows. He resumes his job at the steel mill upon release.

Rodney's life as a prize fighter takes a nasty turn when he arranges a fight with Harlan DeGroat's (Woody Harrelson) circuit, a ruthless drug dealer based out of New Jersey. The cash prize is meant to settle a debt between Rodney and Petty, who happens to owe DeGroat a large sum of money. In turn, DeGroat offers Petty and his fighter ring time with a caveat: take a dive and all debts are settled. Rodney swallows his pride and is forced into the agreement. His disappearance is soon to follow.

From here, the movie gets violent. Russell takes his brother's disappearance into his own hands, and goes out in search of his missing sibling. Russell's single-minded mission to find his brother is amplified by the rising tension of being an ex-con who lost the love of his life. The movie comes to a grueling climax where Russell must choose between freedom or revenge. What will he decide? Find out for yourself!

Every actor does a great job with their performance for the most part. Bale and Affleck are brilliant as the Baze brothers. Dafoe shines in a role almost as colorful as transvestite agent Paul Smecker in ""Boondock Saints."" Harrelson is decent, though his recent string of films have him typecasted as a cardboard villain. Eddie Vedder (Pearl Jam) was contracted to compose the movie's theme song, ""Out of the Furnace,"" a haunting track that plays during the end credits. The overall film provides a very realistic glimpse into the setting and characters it portrays, and should have received much higher ratings from critics and audiences alike.",1396483200,2,2998,4.988

5828931,4,B00DL47YY2,"Out of the Furnace starring Christian Bale, Woody Harrelson, Casey Affleck, Zoe Saldana and many other awesome actors is a movie about small town, back hills life. The gritty story talks about blue collar workers, specifically Christian Bale's character Russel Baze who works in the back hills of New Jersey for a Mill. As can seen across the American economic landscape, this kind of work is few and far between and surviving in this town is a constant struggle. I think you see the dynamic between two characters of the Baze brothers with Casey Affleck's character Rodney Baze - just coming out of the military and not having a clue how to survive in this real world. Scott Cooper does a phenomenal job hitting home with having the audience really question who is good and who is bad. (Spoiler Alert below)

Christian Bale's character Russel works hard and for the most part tries to stay out of trouble. He pays his brother's debts as best as he can, but they seem to be large debts that nobody really knows how large. Then one event changes his life as he drives drunk and kills a family. He then ends up in jail and what you see in this transition is a character's resilience to always try to do the right thing. As he gets out of jail it's a different world now. The woman that he loved ( Zoe Saldana) is in love with someone else (The local police chief played by Forrest Whitaker). His father has died and he missed the funeral. Now his brother is street fighting for money and taking falls for the gamblers. This is where Woody Harrelson's character comes in. Woody Harrelson is just amazing as usual as a drug dealing, money grubbing criminal. Knows how to almost get caught and escape and yet continues to murder and commit crimes with no penalty whatsoever. That is the parallel you see in the movie - that struggle for Bale's character to constantly do the right thing.

So you immediately know that Bale's only path forward is revenge. I would've rather seen Affleck enslaved by Harrelson and forced to fight like his personal pit bull or something and Bale comes in, kicks some ass and rescues him (yeah I know same premise done 1,000 times before but it would have been more entertaining) but with Affleck dead the rest of the movie is a predictable downhill and anti-climactic path.

I was moved by it and disturbed by it.  Woody Harrelson and Casey Affleck were also fantastic.
It's a gritty story. It's not full of all the typical Hollywood bells and whistles.
It's not for the faint of heart, but it will likely pull out of you every possible emotion (literally).

5829378,4,B00DL47YY2,"I won't waste your time forcing you to read big, complicated words for what is really a very simple movie. Maybe the simplest you will ever see. And I'm not going to write a movie review that's actually a book report on the film. If you want to know what happens, rent the movie. I did. I said the movie is simple. There is no fluff here. There is no moral lesson. There is no political message. I would say that there is nothing particularly ""right"" or ""wrong"" in this movie. Right and wrong are in the eye of the beholder. Characters are warned not to do things. They do them and there are consequences. Characters try to stop others from exercising free will. The characters attempting to interfere with the free will of others face consequences. This movie is about realities and consequences. The reality is bad things happen to good people. But good people also do bad things. Actions have consequences. You can plan to act and hope to achieve a consequence. And you WILL achieve a consequence. That doesn't mean it's the one  you seek. There are no real judgements of anybody in this movie. You can draw your own conclusions about whether or not they got what they ""deserved"". People die in this movie. Though there is violence, there is no violence for the sake of violence. Though there is killing, there is no killing for the sake of killing. There's not even a great deal of foul language. Perhaps someone decided to make a movie that has REAL foul language instead of Hollywood-style foul language. The characters are...simple. There is no psychoanalysis of them. There is no attempt to create a ""biography"" of characters so you know why they are  the way they are. It doesn't matter. This movie is stunning in that respect - there are no politics involved. More shots that COUNT are fired by the good guy in this movie than by the bad guy. In the end, the good guy essentially tortures the bad guy by shooting to wound him more than one before finally ""finishing him"". When the bad guy committed the crime the good guy seeks a reckoning for, he shot his victims only once each. He may be evil. But he is also merciful. Who can say who the real ""villain"" in this movie is? Is it the man who shoots the lead character's brother as a professional matter, but not a personal one? Is it the main character who kills at least twice in this movie, but perhaps more? We don't know. We only see one victim of each of his acts of homicide. There could have been another in the first act. We have no idea how long he is punished for his crime. Its not relevant. An argument could be made that the only main character in the movie who causes suffering without experiencing any is the girlfriend who doesn't want the main character to leave when he's free, but leaves him when he's in prison. When he tries to reconcile with her, and after she leads him along with a smile at the park and then a trip to the bridge, she shatters him by telling him she's pregnant with another man's baby. Did she have to tell him that? No. So why did she? Did it make things easier for her? Yes. It did. In this movie the main character loses three people he loves. His father who dies of illness supposedly caused by their shared occupation. His girlfriend who leaves him and moves out while he is in prison without ever facing him there to tell him she's going. Yet he still defends her as his little brother, who he also loses, tells him that he's better off without her. When it's all said and done, this movie is just a story. It doesn't try to teach a lesson. It doesn't try to get you to think a certain way. It doesn't even try to entertain you or shock you. I wouldn't say its a good story or a bad story. Or a good movie or a bad movie. Its just a movie. The movie just is what it is. There are no egos at work. There is no point being made. There are no sales to be made via product placement. There is no huge commercial aspect to the movie. The characters aren't beautiful. They're not  perfect or striving to be perfect. Basically there is no character development. I think that what this movie actually is just hit me. It's almost a police report adapted to the movie screen. One written as a final report on several connected but separate crimes along with the standard, short biological sketch the police might make of each person involved while trying to put all the pieces together.",1395446400,,4384,4.389913899138992
5829379,3,B00DL47YY2,I found this movie slow and although it depicts life in mining towns very well the story of a brother taking care of another unconditionally is well portrayed.

Like everyone said, nothing groundbreaking in terms of plot. But depending on what you're looking for, that won't have a huge impact on the feelings it evokes. A well-trodden premise can still bring out the best in actors. I felt that was the case here.

Bale and Affleck were great and the dynamic between the brothers they portrayed felt sincere. And that goes really for most of the talented cast. Each actor brought an honest depiction of the people they portrayed. The bulk of the film seemed to move beautifully, albeit bleak and tragic, without being too self-conscious. It only started to feel rushed when the melodrama and suspense kicked in during the final half-hour.

Ultimately, it was a resonating depiction of ordinary men in tough situations doing their best with the cards they have been dealt.",1395360000,,1005,4.9

The symbolism displayed creates the final showdown between protagonist and antagonist taking the watcher to the nail biting end.

Working class nice brother with brother in some war du jour is coming home and having a hard time adjusting. Usual fight scenes, bad guys selling drugs, extorting money, one brother gets into bad company and other brother comes to the rescue by dispatching the bad guys - how creative.

This one scene sets the tone: In this accident scene one brother while driving on an arterial hits another car that is backing out of a driveway onto this arterial (dumb). Backing out car gets dented on the rear panel (parking lot dented) resulting in that driver being head bloodied and presumed dead. Further, an unsecured (more dumb) child is in the back seat and apparently dead. Oddly, the driver's side window and door glass are not even broken. The back seat area is fully intact. So the accident scene doesn't add up along with the next scene of the brother already in jail.

film where Jeff Bridges is an alchoholic country singer... that was also pretty forgettable.
There are some good performances, but the whole thing is so relentlessly glum and humorless, and the characters are not particularly sympathetic (except for Bale, but he is so glum and mumbly.....) so it's hard to get too invested.
There is one scene that I saw coming a  mile away, because it was lifted completely from ""Silence of the Lambs"" (yes! you will understand if you catch it), but that's a minor quibble.
My big quibble is the ending, which I will not reveal, but it is tremendously unsatisfying.  Again, I think the writer/director was attempting to veer from the standard ""revenge"" plot, but in doing so, robbed the film of both momentum and resolution.

Relentlessly depressing, too. There is not one ray of hope in this bleak retelling of the classic, ""The Deer Hunter.""  The actors do their best at first, but then I think they, too, just gave up. The ending feels very tacked on. Not just in terms of the way they wrap up the plot, but literally - feels like they tacked on a scene that is unconnected to the rest of the story. There is no one that the audience can root for or identify with. There is one good moment - the very first scene in the film - which shows Christian Bale getting out of jail. It's one of the best getting-out-of-jail scenes because of his evident joy at being free. That's literally the first scene and it's way downhill from there.",1395100800,,864,4.468354430379747

Dafoe plays as good a role as I've seen him in for a long while.  Zaldana is unremarkable but no doubt was a good move relative to Bale.  I've long felt the younger Affleck a better or more compelling than his elder brother.  Harrelson seems mostly type cast into these type cast in these tough guy/bad guy image.  Everyone else is very versatile.

In a sense this is a modern, darker version of ""Any Which Way But Loose"".  The greed, betting and fixing fights between dog, cock, reptiles, bugs and people in all realism.  Being a former Golden Gloves boxer I can say some of the fiercest, toughest fighters I've ever seen were oil field workers who fought bare knuckles.

The main problem I had w/the movie are ""omissions"" I'm no legal expert but it seems unlikely Bale's character would A) receive a drivers license so readily after his release from prison and reason for sentencing, and B) seems incredibly unlikely after being partially reasonable for possible 3-4 people and the cold blooded murder of another regardless of monstrous crimes would not be tried and likely convicted of a few counts of involuntary and one case of pre-meditated murder.

5829771,4,B00DL47YY2,"Going into this movie I had a certain idea of what it would be (and isn't that usually the case...), but not only did I not get what I was expecting, I was given something that, in retrospect, was much more grounded and thought-provoking. After seeing Out of the Furnace in theaters I was surprised to find that its ending had stayed with me for a while. I was baffled, really, because I had to ask myself what it was about and there was no easy answer. And that's this movie in a nutshell. It makes you work to get it, but where most films with this ""problem"" fail in senselessness, Out of the Furnace rewards your extra cognitive workout with something that becomes maybe not enjoyable per se, but relatable. This movie was not made for spectacle, and it was not made to make you feel good: many of these characters are good people who are victims of circumstance and, while justice does come, it is bittersweet.
Visually it is ugly, in the sense that Out of the Furnace brings you into a dying industrial town, to dying people who have accepted their fates and intend to walk sleepily into their inevitable demise. It is dusty, rusty, covered in graffiti, and filled with depression. Christian Bale's character, Russell, tries to fix up his home, but all it really amounts to is a coat of paint hiding the age of the place (if you're pickin' up what I'm puttin' down, here).
Out of the Furnace is one of those movies that most people will not understand, and they'll probably criticize it (fairly), because its talented cast will likely lure in the unsuspecting. Be warned: this is not Batman. That said, if you are willing to give this film a chance and really sit down and consider it, you will be rewarded.",1394928000,,1712,4.508038585209003

5829774,4,B00DL47YY2,"Director Scott Cooper co wrote this script with Brad Ingelsby and somehow it feels like big chunks of the story were either overlooked or landed on the cutting room floor. Essential information is absent where it should be focal in order to make this story more poignant.

Russell Baze (Christian Bale) and his younger brother Rodney (Casey Affleck) live in the economically-depressed Rust Belt (some of the buildings indicate Reading, PA), and have always dreamed of escaping and finding better lives. Their father (dying) and uncle Red (Sam Shepard) live at the poverty level, Russell's only happiness is his relationship with Lena (Zoe Saldana). Rodney is serving separate deployments to Iraq and his mind is being irreversibly damaged by the war. An auto accident in which Russell (who has been drinking) includes a fatality and lands Russell in prison, unable to care for his dying father, losing Lena, and unable to support Rodney's debts. Rodney, unable to tolerate working in the mills associates with the strange John Petty (Willem Dafoe) who arranges and fixes fights. Desperate for income Rodney agrees to become involved with one of the most violent and ruthless crime rings in the Northeast, a crime ring run buy the grossly disgusting and malevolent Harlan DeGroat (Woody Harrelson) - a mistake that will cost him everything. Once released, Russell must choose between his own freedom, or risk it all to seek justice for his brother.

The cast is uniformly excellent - Bale, Affleck, Harrelson, Shepard, Dafoe, Saldana, and Forest Whitaker as the confused sheriff. The story is consistently dark in message and in cinematography, though the compassion and commitment within family is palpable. It offers some fine comparisons between PTSD effects from the constant misuse of soldiers in the Middle East and the chronic fatigue of poverty and crime in the depressed sector of America that used to be the pot of gold for industry. It is concerned with revenge that seems to have trouble finding a focus - so much of the world is out of focus for these tragic characters. This is a raw look at today. Were it not for a brilliant cast this film would not work at all. It pleads to be re-edited. Grady Harp, March 14",1394928000,,2225,4.946524064171123

Cinematography was beautiful! Acting was brilliant by the entire cast! The script consistent until the last seconds, simple but made no sense (sorry but it's true).

Misfortune and tragedy never stop happening to the main character, and there's nothing he can do about it. His reaction to the people he loses is the same as ours would be. You take the licks life gives you and don't let it destroy you.
But eventually he loses enough and goes after the villain of the movie and proves that trying to persevere and live a peaceful humble life is the hard thing to do. There's nothing difficult or disciplined about harming and killing people, but for his character enough is enough.
The three lead characters are all desperate in their own way. Whether it's post traumatic stress, or they were raised in a hopeless wasteland, or they are at the end of their rope.
An arthouse-y emotional revenge flick with a vague message about the decay of smalltown america that you don't often see on the big-screen with this kind of budget or actors involved. Definitely worth a watch",1394841600,2,1108,4.49009900990099

Christian Bale is always great at portraying different types of characters - this role was one type I don't recall seeing - not just where he's from but the emotion evoked by his character was new to me. Woody Harrelson has played the mean, badass before but he played this one differently, and very intense- crazed and mean like never before. I own most of these two actors' films, so I see a difference which could be attributed to the director even though these two are great at portraying characters of all types. Casey Affleck is even slightly different in his acting this time. Willem Dafoe's part was short, as was Sam Sheperd's and Forrest Whittaker's but their roles were played well, too. For a movie that encompasses many situations done on film before, this movie put them into one story that is ..""moving"" , for lack of a better word to describe how I was affected and isn't as strong an adjective as I want to use. I think the director, who's name unfortunately escapes me at the moment - will be one who's name I will not forget should he continue directing. I believe this was his first or second effort (I think he acted before); an excellent, well done effort at that.

I imagine the director trying to visually invoke the spirit of, ""The Dear Hunter"", the 1978 film by Michael Cimino, also set in a Western Pennsylvania steel town, but the story & script is another totally hackneyed unimaginative rehash of Hollywood storytelling.  The film has interesting characterizations performed by great actors but the 'secret sauce' that could've given this film weight is lacking.  Also, it rips off the name from the classic novel, ""Out of This Furnace"",  which was a cheap  shot.  The only thing in common with the book is a few scenes in a steel mill but none of it's power or insight.",1394668800,,780,4.776119402985074
5829937,5,B00DL47YY2,"Being a Christian Bale fan, I enjoyed this movie very much. The life that he brings to the character involves you deeply in his story. It's a good ""badass"" movie. Woody Harrelson plays a great bad guy!",1394668800,,201,4.45945945945946
5829938,4,B00DL47YY2,"With names like Casey Affleck, Christian Bale, Woody Harrelson and all the other big hitters in this movie I really expected more from the actors and more depth and intensity in the story. To me, the actors all looked as if they have been working way too much making too many films in the last year or so.

 I totally agree with the reviewer who noted the voices were mumbled and hard to understand. The film shot mostly at night or in dark rooms was difficult to appreciate in terms of cinematography or design. When stars like Forest Whitaker are reduced to playing cameo rolls something is wrong. There is too much money and not enough creativity behind this movie.",1394582400,,668,4.558333333333334
5829939,1,B00DL47YY2,"There are a lot of big names here, but this movie plays out like a made-for-TV drama, and a weak one at that. It is also FILLED with Hollywood's perception of reality, which is often inaccurate. For instance, in the prison visitation scene, the bothers shake hands and then hug. Yeah,right!  Try to touch your loved one and see what happens. The universal rule is ""Talk, but Do Not Touch"" because this is how drugs, weapon and cell phones get handed off to inmates. Laughable. In another prison scene, Bale gets a tattoo from another inmate out in the open on the yard!  LOL!  They would both get 30 days solitary for the offense, AND probably another 30 for being for bold (or stupid) to do it on the yard in the open. Who wrote this? Sean Penn???",1394582400,,748,4.405797101449275

5829991,1,B00DL47YY2,I can't believe anyone liked this. You couldn't pay me to watch it again. It was dark and depressing and just a bad story.,1394582400,,122,4.125
5829992,4,B00DL47YY2,"This is a story about family, love, loss and loyalty. Bale's character is struggling to get by in the rust belt. His father is ill and his younger brother is being sent back to Iraq. He has an unfortunate incident and ends up in prison. While he was there his father dies, his girlfriend leaves him and his brother does another tour and returns with PTSD. After his release from prison while he's trying to pick up the pieces of his life, his brother gets mixed up with a fight ring and disappears. He then goes on a mission to seek revenge against the perpetrators.

The movie is dark and gritty. It reminded me of ""The Deer Hunter"" and I suppose someone could spend a lot of time comparing and contrasting the two films. But while it is dark and sometimes violent, you begin to care about the characters as you realize they are only trying to cope with situations that are out of their control and do the one thing that they can to get some measure of justice.",1394582400,,962,4.344444444444444
5829993,5,B00DL47YY2,"I completely enjoyed this movie.  Great actors and story line  It was tense right up until the end. Christian Bale, Casey Affleck and Woody Harrelson all did an awesome job.",1394496000,,173,4.733333333333333
5829994,5,B00DL47YY2,"This was an intense movie with good acting and a great cast. Christian Bale did a great job in his role and really sold the character to me. Woody Harrelson, though only in the film a bit, was strong too and added much to the movie itself. Though I was not as familiar with Casey Affleck, I was so impressed with his performance. What I loved the most though was the details portrayed in the movie. You can tell that the Director really researched the locale of the movie itself to make it real for the viewer. The movie is emotional and raw and really draws you in a keeps you engaged from beginning to end. All-in-all this was a great movie, with a amazing story and actors that truly embody their characters - this is a must see for all!

5829995,5,B00DL47YY2,Loved this film. Worth watching...Christian Bale is SUCH a great actor!!! I would most definitely watch again. Casey Affleck is pretty good too!,1394496000,,144,5.304347826086956
5829996,5,B00DL47YY2,"Scott Cooper's moody, atmospheric followup to his Oscar-winning CRAZY HEART is a dark, winding journey through the torn soul of two brothers.  The film stars Christian Bale as working man Russell Baze, struggling to care for his ailing father and P.T.S.D.-afflicted brother Rodney (Casey Affleck).  After a fatal drunk driving accident, Russell finds himself doing time, during which Rodney's gambling addiction leads him to illegal bare-knuckle fighting.  Russell gets out, but it isn't long before Rodney goes missing, and Russell finds himself pursuing the man most likely responsible: local crime kingpin Harlan DeGroat (a terrifyingly brutal Woody Harrelson).

At first glimpse, OUT OF THE FURNACE seems to be an actor's piece.  Bale delivers, as usual; his performance is haunting, lingering with you after the credits role.  The same goes for Casey Affleck.  The rest of the supporting cast rounds out well, with Willem Defoe, Sam Shepard, and Forest Whitaker fleshing out their minor characters.  Zoe Saldana has a couple of great scenes, but her role is minimal at best, serving more to give Russell something to mourn from his prior life. (Her and Bale do share a tremendous scene after Russell's release from prison, making you wish Saldana has more screen time).  Among the supporting cast, it's Harrelson who shines; he turns DeGroat into a truly menacing threat.  The opening scene along leaves the spine tingling, and from there, Harrelson hulks his way through his scenes, chewing dialogue and spitting it out like tobacco.  His and Bale's final scene together, while mostly wordless, shows what two great actors can do when left to their own devices.

However, dig beneath the surface, and you'll find that there's a lot more than just expert casting here.  The script, by Cooper and Brad Ingelsby, is rich, deep, and thoughtful.  FURNACE is beautifully shot, and wholly unrelenting.  It's slow going at points, but this isn't wasted time; the slower scenes build either character or tension, until events explode with surprising brutality.  OUT OF THE FURNACE is a small, intimate film, but it has a lot to say, and a lot to offer.  A worthy follow-up to the tamer CRAZY HEART, and hopefully a promise of brilliant things to come from director Scott Cooper.",1394496000,6,2275,5.121951219512195
5829997,3,B00DL47YY2,"""I said I'll handle it, don't make it personal."" Russell Baze (Bale) is having a rough time. He is trying to hold down a job during the day, care for his dying father at night and trying to keep his brother Rodney (Affleck) out of trouble. When something terrible happens Russell winds up in jail. When he gets out his life is changed. No job, his father died, his girl is pregnant from another man and his brother is in way over his head. After Rodney goes missing Russell knows who is behind it but the police aren't moving fast enough for him so Russell does things his way. This is a movie where the trailer misrepresents the movie a little. Going off the trailer I expected a tense action movie, what this was was a very slow moving drama. The acting is great but I never felt the tense feeling I was expecting. The movie is very gritty and realistic but I never really got all the way involved in it. Christian Bale and Casey Affleck are great in it as always and Woody Harrelson is a master at playing creeps but Forest Whitaker seemed like an afterthought in this movie and his part wasn't really needed at all. For some reason every time he showed up it was a distraction and took me out of the movie. When you watch you will see what I mean. Overall, yet another movie with a great cast that is ultimately disappointing. I give this a B-.",1394409600,,1348,4.290196078431372
5829998,5,B00DL47YY2,I live in the real North Braddock PA and this movie was filmed on my block for 2 months. I was an awesome experience. I thought it portrayed Braddock and North Braddock accurately. I will never move because my Great Great Grandfather immigrated here from Czechoslovakia. The movie is depressing but real.,1394409600,,304,4.865384615384615
5829999,5,B00DL47YY2,"I am the mayor of the town (Braddock, Pa) where this amazing picture was shot.  Scott Cooper could not have rendered a more authentic film about what a rusted-out life and community feels like.

Cooper did his homework with an affection and deference that permeates the entire effort.  Every member of his cast gives a magnificent performance.  It was a true outrage this film was not nominated for an Academy Award.  To see Jared Leto win over Casey Affleck's heartbreaking performance as a shattered veteran is the most egregious omission this award season.  A close second is Mr. Bale- he fully deserved two nominations this year.  Woody Harrelson also delivers a career performance in the same league of iconic villainy of Anton Chigurh.

Scott Cooper has shown exactly what income equality looks like in America in a very powerful and moving film.",1394150400,15,852,4.950704225352113
