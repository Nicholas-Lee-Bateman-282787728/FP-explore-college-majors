8127222,1,B000FVGNRS,"This DVD was poorly made and edited.  It starts out with old cartoons that have no educational value at all.  The box came damaged, the graphics are of poor quality and the animal sounds at the begining are quite annoying.  DOn't waste your money on this one...instead purchase some real finger puppets and do the fingerplays on your own...your money will be put to better use. My chilren were not entertained by this at all, other than listening to Lori's annoying sounds and laughing at them.  I wish I had my 15 bucks back on this one.....",1265673600,,542,4.556701030927835

KIDS FIRST!(tm) Adult Juror Comments:

Teaches classic finger plays with familiar songs and nursery rhymes. Easy to follow and very interactive. Presenter is enthusiastic, positive, friendly and full of praise. Simple production values. Although quick-paced, very suitable for young children.

KIDS FIRST!(tm) KID Juror Comments:

Kids recognized the songs and rhymes and immediately started trying to do the finder plays and singing along. ""I sang with Miss Lori and used my hands."" "" It made me want to sing the songs."" Most wanted to watch it again and thought it was lots of fun.",1186876800,,769,5.278688524590164
