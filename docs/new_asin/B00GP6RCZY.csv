Disappointing, I was looking forward to viewing a live performance.",1407283200,,157,4.096774193548387
6097801,5,B00GP6RCZY,Great Buy...my son loved it..delivery time was great...,1404864000,2,55,6.0
6097802,3,B00GP6RCZY,"Like I said I wanted my iTunes Festival DVD, I already own the album and it is NOT my favorite sooooooo imma need a return, or trade in",1402531200,,135,3.857142857142857
6097803,2,B00GP6RCZY,"The trademark for Gaga used to be that no matter how many times you heard one of her songs, they were still infectious and original. They lent themselves to abstract  singles and remixes that were far less accessible, but HER original work was always something that was easy to get caught up in and enjoy.
This album has NONE of that. This seems like someone took a club mix of all the original works and got rid of the originals, which, without the context of the source material, seem random, abrasive, and largely incoherent.
Pity, I looked forward to having something new to put on constant repeat for a month or two, but this one i have played only twice.
And even that was a tough listen.
Yikes!",1400544000,,701,4.4765625
6097804,5,B00GP6RCZY,"I bought the CD the day it came out but when I found out this version with the live DVD was available, I had to have it too! It did not disappoint! It's an unbelievable concert introduction to over half of the tracks on Artpop. The CD is a little too heavy on sex and fashion for my taste, but there is enough included here to hold my interest. Gaga gambles! Gaga wins!

Lady Gaga is an authentic talent. For many it's hard to get past the gimmick side to her, but she's an amazingly talented young artist and she has something important to say- something that should be heard. I get her! She's a true artist,

LOVE HER!!!",1392163200,6,622,4.218487394957983
6097805,5,B00GP6RCZY,She previewed 7 songs from her upcoming ARTPOP album during iTunes Festival in 2013. It's a great performance not to be missed,1390953600,4,126,4.7727272727272725

6097808,4,B00GP6RCZY,"Complete with import tag and a friendly little note on the bubble-wrapped package (a delightful touch), the video shows the lady on stage with a limited cast and a startling urgency. More than half of the ARTPOP track list included. Highly recommended for Gaga monsters everywhere.",1388102400,3,281,5.130434782608695
6097809,5,B00GP6RCZY,"I don't' now how it is , was a gift for my nephew and he is crazy about Gaga...so I am sure he ill like it.",1387152000,,107,3.1538461538461537
8626027,5,B00GP6RCZY,LOVED most of the songs on the CD. But was hoping the special DVD was going to be the 'ArtRave' from NY when it first debuted and I think I caught live on the internet. Ive looked everywhere but cant seem to find that one except this one site that has a bunch of her concerts on it but I'm not sure if its legit or just a scam.,1490400000,,327,3.753623188405797
8626028,5,B00GP6RCZY,Great addition to my Lady Gaga collection!!!!  Very happy and it came sooner than expected,1424649600,,90,5.0
8626029,2,B00GP6RCZY,The ALBUM IS 10 stars and the video it came with was priceless to me. But the packaging inside was s***. The DVD behind the cd was not even held in by the cd holder it was all chipped (the part that holds the cd in) it lucky did not have too many scratches and still played flawlessly.,1419984000,,285,3.9310344827586206

8626033,1,B00GP6RCZY,Twice I ordered this cd and both times I just got the standard cd it was mislabeled not the deluxe version very disappointed,1413417600,,124,4.434782608695652
8626034,5,B00GP6RCZY,"What can I say, Lady Gaga is fabulous. Her shows/concerts are amazing. Artpop is another great creation. Maybe it's not for everyone but what is. Very happy with this deluxe edition. Already ordered Cheek to Cheek,  her collaboration with Tony Bennett. If she has a show near you,  do yourself a favor and go see it.",1411171200,,316,4.625
