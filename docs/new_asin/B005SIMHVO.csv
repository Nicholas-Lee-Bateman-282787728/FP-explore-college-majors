4885682,2,B005SIMHVO,"Kathy has been around a long time and is a very good instructor but, in this DVD much of Kathy's form is incorrect. She needs to get a true Kettlebell training certification. Kettlebell form is extremely important. The weight is being thrown around using much momentum and core. This is a power workout not an aerobic class.",1331856000,11,324,4.701754385964913
4885683,5,B005SIMHVO,I am new to kettlebell workouts and from other reveiws decided to give this one a try. I like the extra dvd which explains how to do each exercise properly. I like Kathy Smith's enthusiasm. She is easy to listen to and gives good instruction. I am 48 and have some shoulder issues so I definitly need the lighter 3lb weight for certain exercises but the heavier for the rest was fine. Then maybe I can move up to the 8lb or 10lb. Over all I think this is an excelent workout and would recommend to others!,1329177600,20,505,4.216494845360825
4885684,5,B005SIMHVO,"Wanted to get into some light kettlebell workouts.  Thought I knew what I was doing...I was wrong.  Would reccomend this for beginners to get used to the kettlebells.  Kathy is really fun and great in this DVD and made it educational, safe a fun.  Not for advanced but great for beginners.  Didn't even realize it's a 2 DVD set!",1323216000,39,328,4.491525423728813
4885685,1,B005SIMHVO,"Before I ordered this dvd, I read all reviews only one or two reviews where negative, so I went ahead and I ordered. I wish I can return this DVD. Her form is really bad. She does not explain while she is performing the workout completely. I have Jill Michaels, Amy Bento and Sara Lurie, they explain everything in the correct way and they perform it correctly, as well. This DVD is crazy. Please do no buy it.",1440547200,2,410,4.269230769230769
4885686,5,B005SIMHVO,"Fantastic videos ,clear and it won't  bog you down with lots of moves  when trying to  learn.
The same great  expectations-standard that I have come to expect from other videos in the past.
I look forward to more of her videos.",1438128000,2,227,4.463414634146342
4885687,5,B005SIMHVO,This is great especially for a beginner.  Been using it religiously for about a year now.  Your shoulders and arms start to take form immediately.  Am now looking for Kathy's advanced kettlebell  workout.,1437523200,4,204,5.090909090909091
4885688,4,B005SIMHVO,"This is a great set to determine if kettlebells are for you.  It's a nice little workout, and it convinced me that I finally found my perfect exercise...so I'm going with Pavel and heavier weights.",1436832000,,197,4.628571428571429

4885691,5,B005SIMHVO,"I wanted to review this as soon as I tried 2 parts of the workout because I loved it so much. (upper body and fat burning sections)  But, I thought, 'no you have to try out the rest to give it a fair review.'  I've since tried out the lower body and core solutions.  It is these four sections along with a good warm-up section.  Also, very importantly, there is a separate instructional video which I sat and watched, then grabbed my 5lb kettlebell and tried some of it out with them to make sure I was doing things correctly.  That is very important with kettlebells but once you've got it - you've got it!  It's pretty easy really.  None of the sections take too long, so you can survive them pretty well without wearing yourself out needlessly.  Also, I'm excited about working out with kettlebells for a few reasons.  A)  they work!  they trim and raise the heart rate like nobody's business!  B)  the workout is doable.  I can hang with everything in its entirety except I will have to work up to a couple of the core exercises but, I did most of it, which frankly does not hurt in the self-esteem department of exercise  C) Kettlebells give you something to concentrate on while you workout so your mind is occupied and not telling you - hey, let's go do something else.
Kathy Smith is a fitness doll - I'm 45 and I know I did a workout video of hers when I was in high school and I swear she looks better than ever - if that was possible.  She's a true inspiration!  She's not overbearing, she's informative and she keeps it simple and just gives you a good solid workout.  This is a good workout with kettlebells, beginner or intermediate.  She has some challenging moves for the advanced AND it is fun.  That is the best part.  I actually look forward to it.  Also, and someone back me up on this - I notice just after a few times of doing this my energy levels are off the chart.  I do other types of workouts (boot camp type stuff along with walking or jogging...)  Anyway, just curious if it really seemed to boost other people's energy to the point of noticing the differences.  Good stuff - order it! Enjoy.  3 - 5 lb kettlebell is enough in beginning.  I do a 5 lb.  I may use my 10lb for a couple of the exercises. I believe Kathy uses a 3 and a 5.  You can gauge what's best for you.",1424649600,3,2300,4.235023041474655

4885693,5,B005SIMHVO,"Of course, Kathy Smith puts out a very good video with easy to follow moves.  I have done her videos for years and she always comes through with a good and fun workout.  It is a tough workout but with Kathy Smith's instructions, it isn't too difficult for a beginner and is a good workout for a more advanced exerciser.",1422835200,,319,4.3
4885694,5,B005SIMHVO,"This is one of the best exercise DVD's I own.  I've always loved Kathy Smith tapes and this one is no exception.  Kettlebells are an incredible way to get your arms toned up and also work your core.  I'm not one for doing situps, but this DVD pretty much has you doing them standing up.  It's incredible.  It's been about 2 months of using this tape and I've lost a good bit of weight -- the best thing is I've lost it around my waist which is my Achilles' heel.",1420243200,3,462,4.088888888888889
4885695,4,B005SIMHVO,"Kathy provides 4 solid workouts. After doing the workouts for a few weeks they definitely become easier, but what workout doesn't. I have been doing the workouts for about a month and a half and have already seen results!",1410220800,,221,4.6923076923076925
4885696,4,B005SIMHVO,if you are just starting to exercise after a long while...this is the video for you...its not stressful ...exercises are easy to do...and her explanation of how to do the exercises are really simple...I like this video,1406592000,2,218,4.918918918918919
4885697,5,B005SIMHVO,"i was looking for an effective, enjoyable exercise that i could use at my current level of fitness [middle age sedentary overweight]. I tried some bodyweight type exercise videos, but it was so hard to do a push up the video was already on to the next set before i did even 2 - didn't seem like i was getting much activity for all the struggle..... This video set was a different experience! The videos present kettlebell technique that is easy to learn. I started by doing the tutorial, increasing my activity as i learned the exercises, then i was doing the upper and lower body and core routines 3x a week. Now, after 4 weeks, I'm doing kettlebell with Kathy every other day! My clothes are fitting better. I""m so happy to find something more like fun [playing catch] and less like work [lifting weights]. I'm getting progressively more and more sweaty too! I believe this product was endorsed/advertised for any fitness level, it worked for me!",1406160000,24,948,4.648809523809524
4885698,2,B005SIMHVO,I gave away the DVD since it was quite a bit harder than I thought it would have been. Her moves are so fast and it was hard for me to keep up. I am staying with the free u-tube videos that are more my speed.,1401321600,3,208,3.5434782608695654
4885699,3,B005SIMHVO,I am just starting to use this DVD.  It is very motivating and am excited to continue to exercise with this DVD.,1400976000,,112,4.090909090909091
4885700,4,B005SIMHVO,"I think this is a great workout but I only have a 20lb kettlebell and for some reason thought that would be fine but because Kathy uses a smaller one, I had a hard time keeping up with the movements. I gave it to a friend who has a smaller kettlebell and I know that she will get a good workout!",1400716800,3,295,3.8524590163934427
4885701,5,B005SIMHVO,"Male or female this is the finest work out I have ever experience!  I swear 4 pounds of sweat is burned in one week - four workouts!

I didn't know I had four pounds to loose.

After each work out I have energy for hours and hours.  I feel like I could kick in doors or tear down walls for 8 hours afterwards.",1400284800,7,309,3.857142857142857
4885702,5,B005SIMHVO,"This is a wonderful introduction to kettlebells. As with all of Katy Smith's  DVDS, the instructions are excellent, and the workout is fun to do",1397347200,,144,4.76
4885703,5,B005SIMHVO,"I was new to kettlebells and bought several different DVDs but I favor this one the most.  There are five segments on the DVD: Warm up,  Upper Body, Buns and Thighs, Core and Fat Burning.  Each segment is about 15 minutes and there is enough variety to keep you interested but the exercises are not so difficult that you want to throw up.

For a beginner, you can't go wrong with Kathy Smith's Kettlebell Solution.  This is all you need.",1388448000,6,437,4.4125
4885704,3,B005SIMHVO,I like Kathy Smith and her exercise programs.  This particular kettlebell program is fine for beginners.  It's workable for the more serious kettlebell fans if they use heavier weights.,1383350400,2,185,5.344827586206897
4885705,1,B005SIMHVO,This DVD is the pits Kathy goes too fast is not encouraging I wish Leslie Sansone would put out a kettle bell DVD I would buy it I will never buy Kathy's DVDs again,1375315200,4,164,3.8529411764705883
4885706,4,B005SIMHVO,"It's actually a hard kettle ball workout!  Don't let the 2 DVD's fool you, one is simply a ""how to use a kettle ball correctly"" DVD and after watching it once you won't need this one again.  I like Kathy Smith and have several of her workout DVD's.  This one did not disappoint me. She's pleasant and informed and makes you feel comfortable.",1372291200,9,341,4.380952380952381
4885707,5,B005SIMHVO,"The 2-DVD set includes a workout video and an instruction video. On the workout video there are four 15-17 minute segments that you can mix and match with an excellent menu system. Also, it includes a 6-minute warm up that is perfect to use before you start any of the segments. You will get results even if you do one 15-min segment a day! This is an excellent workout set and I would give it a 10-star if i could :-)  I also  love the upbeat music from yesfitnessmusic dot com

I like to breakup my workouts during the day; typically yoga/meditation in the morning, aerobics (running, elliptical, cycling, etc.) mid day, and weighted workout and a bit more cardio in the late afternoon. I can get an hour to an hour and a half everyday with this routine. This dvd makes it really fun and easy to add that afternoon weighted workout for a 15, 30, 45, or 60 minute workout (plus 6 minute warm-up)

The four segments are:
1. Upper Body
2. Buns and Thighs
3. Core
4. Fat Burning (overall body)
...Plus 6 minute warm-up.

With each segment you can choose to have Kathy Smith give verbal instruction, or just have music. Kathy is not too animated in this production like some of her other dvds, yet she is upbeat enough to keep interest and she provides a lot of variety with the exercises to keep your interest. The 15 minutes flys by!

The second dvd is instructional only and provides an additional workout just by following along. It includes all of the exercises used in the segments on the workout dvd. For each of the exercises Kathy Smith narrates and explains form, while student (who is really Kathy's instructor), Mia Finnegan shows the moves. Mia is in excellent shape from working with kettlebells. Also, beginner, intermediate, and advanced form is provided. This is one of those instruction videos that you can keep going back to as your improve your skills to learn better form. This DVD includes everything you need to know about starting a kettlebell workout. I only wish it had a better menu system like the accompanying workout dvd to choose individual exercises. This dvd just runs from beginning to end 25 minutes. The exercises include:
Standing exercises, kettlebell swings are included in all exercises
1. Swing with thrust (squatting up and down)
2. Hip extension (called ""Bull"" kicking alternating legs back)
3. Step forward, step back, then add leg lifts
4. One Arm Swings, then alternating hands, then add catching (fun!)
5. Clean with hip action (very important). Swinging down, rack it, and hold it, then add press overhead
6. Overhead snatch: down and up overhead
7. Standing Circles, moving to standing ribbon (taking around your body with a chop, stretch. I love this move, very creative and makes core/ab work fun!)
8. Twist side to side (more core work)
9. Chop (up and down, then sweeps, then dynamic
10. Reverse  lunges with arm swing. Then, add pass-through under the lunging leg to other hand to add intensity)
11. Bicep & Tricep work with added lunge (whole body workout)
12.  Deadlift
13. Lateral lunges, then add arm swing and leg lift (another fun one!)
14. Skater side to side
15. Upright row, then add overhead press
16. Bent-over rows
17. Alternating Kettle Drops
18. Ballet Plie swing side-to-side, zipping it up form
Floor exercises for the core/abs, starts on your back
1. On back, roll down, roll up
2. Pull-overs
3. Pull-overs with crunch
4. Imprinting spine (Pilates move), then add moving alternating legs up and down
5. Pull-overs with leg lowering
6. Plank using heavy bell in one hand on floor so you're elevated on one side (I didn't really get the point of the kettlebell on this one) Plan beginner and advanced (raising alternating legs, then to chest)
7. Side plank. Beginner has one leg bend on knee, advanced has both legs outstretched. Extra-Advanced, then raising kettlebell overhead to your side, wow, hard!!!

Recommended weight for kettlebells:
Kathy uses a 3 lb. and 5 lb. soft kettlebell. This is a good weight for women starting off. For some of the arm exercises a 3lb. might be a little too heavy, so you can you a regular dumbbell weight if needed. As you get better or if you are pretty strong already, you may want to use heavier weights. I have a Universal 3-weight set of 5, 7.5, and 10 lb. which works well for me (average weight/strength).

Kathy Smith has some excellent DVD workouts and this one is becoming one of my favorites. Produced in 2009 (I'm reviewing in 2013), it will be usable for years to come with upbeat music and excellent instruction. The clothing is really beautiful and Kathy is amazing for her age; she was born in 1951 and was 58 years old when she made this video. She's in amazing shape and I hope to look that good at her age! Kathy is really enthusasit and it makes me enthusiastic too. She is so funny in one segment she said ""boom-shak-a-lak-a""; cracked me up!

This dvd is well worth the $14 on Amazon...well worth the money if you want an excellent kettlebell workout!",1370649600,30,4975,4.667808219178082

4885711,4,B005SIMHVO,I bought this set to replace a DVD that didn't work anymore.  You can choose to do one or all of these simple kettleball exercises.  Great for someone not in good shape and not young anymore.,1355702400,9,191,4.277777777777778

4885714,5,B005SIMHVO,I have tried several other kettlebell workouts including Jillian Michael's and I prefer this one the best.  The workouts are not long and have a variety of moves you can really feel.  If you can do them at least 3 times a week you will see results.,1341187200,17,248,4.25531914893617
8485191,4,B005SIMHVO,"I like doing kettlebell workouts as it gives you strength and cardio workouts in one.  I was using a different trainer that was too beginner for me.  I was able to add my own spin, but somehow it was not enough of a pace and I prefer using a lighter kettlebell.  I find this workout challenging and with a lighter kettlebell.  Kathy explains the steps but does not slow the pace",1506556800,,378,4.28169014084507
8485192,3,B005SIMHVO,"It's very difficult to find a good kettlebell workout video.  Trust me, I've been looking.  This one is just ok.  I am fairly new to kettlebells but I want a workout that is easy to do but challenging.  This video has workout's but they are all target specific, such as legs, butts, core, etc.  I was looking for one that was a total body.  I also felt she went too fast while doing the moves.  It was difficult to keep up.  Maybe when I become more familiar with this type of a workout, I'll enjoy this video, but this isn't one for a beginner, in my opinion.",1489708800,,560,4.168224299065421
8485193,3,B005SIMHVO,"Positives first: this dvd has effective moves - if you're looking for quick moves to do with a light kettlebell - for a day when you're pressed for time or don't have the energy to face a big challenge. It's even a little fun.

It is divided into 1 unweighted warmup and 4 15-minute workout segments focusing on different parts of the body.  (This does not include the tutorial dvd, which I haven't actually tried).  The biggest problem is that the dvd doesn't give an option to create a play order.  You either play all or play one and then go all the way back to the menu.  Neither of these options is all that attractive.  15 minutes isn't a long enough workout.  Playing all ends up with a lot of repetition.  Stopping and starting in the middle of a workout is distracting and annoying.  Who puts a dvd together like that, especially an old pro like Smith?

Honestly, I think Smith and co phoned this one in.  Her form is inconsistent.  Some of her chatter makes it seem as if she's doing the moves herself for the first time.  Her rhythm is sometimes off.  The bleah music was probably added after the fact (just a guess). If you have limited patience, it will grate on you.  I still use it mainly because I hate for my light kettlebell to sit in the closet gathering dust, and the moves are actually pretty good, but if I find another dvd that does the same stuff, this one is heading to Goodwill in a heartbeat.",1473897600,3,1419,4.342205323193916
