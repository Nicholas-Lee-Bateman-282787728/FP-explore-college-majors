5186225,5,B008VR7TX0,"Best rock and roll book I've read in years (next to Keith Richards)! Bruce is honest and forthright in his description of his struggles, and his writing verges on the poetic at times.",1479772800,,183,4.575757575757576
5186226,3,B008VR7TX0,an English doc about Springsteen. No new in sights,1479772800,,50,4.666666666666667

5186229,1,B008VR7TX0,Too bad Bruce is such a loud-mouth liberal twat. Think about keeping your opinion to yourself.,1478908800,,94,4.9375
5186230,2,B008VR7TX0,Anything with the Boss has value.  This shows Bruce interviews from 10-15 years ago and for some reason has British people commenting on him.  Nothing special,1478044800,,158,5.038461538461538
5186231,3,B008VR7TX0,"Lots of critics agreeing that BS is great, but no music.",1477785600,,56,4.181818181818182
5186232,3,B008VR7TX0,"This is pretty well done, but sorely needs historical concert footage.",1476748800,,70,5.454545454545454

8531150,2,B008VR7TX0,Yawn. Someone just read copy while very brief flashes of Bruce appeared. Not enough music by far and no great insights for anyone who is even a casual fan.,1514332800,,155,4.379310344827586
8531151,1,B008VR7TX0,"Whoever wrote the review that said this DVD had good quality concert footage was trying to be funny, I guess. There is not a single song here, just a few seconds of low-res ancient concert footage. This is a British import, with British talking heads explaining what Bruce means to them. It is dull, has zero new information, and was geared to make money from the multitude of Bruce fans, of which I am one. I threw the DVD in the trash after watching it because I knew I'd never want to watch it again. The reviewer mentioned above who likened this DVD to the London Calling concert is either pulling a mean-spirited prank on Bruce fans or on strong hallucinogens...or both.",1492560000,,675,4.540983606557377

8531156,2,B008VR7TX0,Watched it for music not a biography. Didn't finish watching.,1482019200,,61,5.2
8531157,4,B008VR7TX0,A good documentary on a great artist!,1481846400,,37,4.428571428571429
8531158,5,B008VR7TX0,"Considering his song writing, it is not surprising he is a really good writer. Both his quality writing and the story he told made for an entertaining read",1481846400,,155,4.571428571428571
8531159,2,B008VR7TX0,There was very little interaction's with the band with Bruce never any original music being played. Left at flat!,1481155200,,113,5.0
