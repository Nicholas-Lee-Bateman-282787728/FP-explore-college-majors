8199249,4,B000R7HY1Y,"Kind of hard to go wrong with a DVD of a show my son already loves. This show is only on once per day M-F so we bought this dvd with multiple episodes to pop on when our son wants to watch ""monster trucks"".",1221091200,,206,3.7045454545454546
8199250,5,B000R7HY1Y,"I bought this DVD as my son is really into Monster trucks at the moment and was pleasantly surprised with the educational content of the DVD as well.  First of all, it is very cute and my son loves to watch it, but it also deals with feelings and other educational concepts like telling the truth or being scared, etc.  We absolutely love it; even my 18 month old daughter will sit down to watch it.  Episodes contained on this disc (Vol. 1) are as follows:
* Twin engines
* Fender bender
* Here comes the Crushmeister
* Pushing the limits
* Fright busters
* King Krush",1213660800,7,569,4.299065420560748
8199251,5,B000R7HY1Y,"My nephews started with the general monster truck toys, and when I came across these DVDs I hoped they would be able to enjoy the show as well. For the short time I've had them, they've asked daily to watch their monster truck show and I love how this show is not easily found on tv, so therefore serves as a real treat for us all to enjoy together!",1211587200,,349,4.072463768115942
8199252,4,B000R7HY1Y,"My 3 year old boy loves this video!  We watch at least one episode every day and he loves pretending his trucks are Mighty Monster Trucks.  We do not have Discovery Kids, but saw an episode on You Tube.  We bought volumes one and two and have not looked back.  We can't wait for volume 3.  This video has 6 episodes: ""Twin Engines,"" ""Fender Bender,"" ""Here Comes the Crushmeister,"" ""Pushing the Limits"", ""Fright Busters"", and ""King Krush"".

In the first episode Meteor and L.T. babysit Senora Rosa's (LT's mom) friend's twins and find themselves a little over their heads!  In Fender Bender, L.T. learns that the guilt one feels in telling a lie and blaming someone else for the damage he caused is not nearly as bad as accepting the consequences of his actions.  In ""...Crushmeister"" Meteor also learns about consequences when he fails to deliver on a promise he made to his friends.  ""Pushing the limits"" teaches kids what can happen when they don't listen to their parents/grandparents.  Meteor thinks he is a big kid and almost gets crushed.  Thankfully, grandpa is there to rescue him.  Fright Busters is my son's least favorite because it deals with the Bigfoot family visiting ""scary"" places around town to conquer their fears.  In the final episode the kids watch a scary movie and let their imaginations get the best of them in the schoolyard.

I like these videos and watch them with my son when I can. I think the messages are positive without being campy.  I highly, highly recommend this video series.",1208131200,,1513,4.743295019157088
8199253,5,B000R7HY1Y,"My son recently discovered this show on TV, and he loves it so much that I bought the first two volumes on DVD so he could watch it on the car DVD player. This show never gets old to him! He loves it. And it's actually one of the few cartoons that I can stand to watch! Funny, great graphics, and very cute!!",1204848000,,308,3.9047619047619047
8199254,5,B000R7HY1Y,I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old grandson.  He loves Monster Trucks and trucks in general.  He watches this over and over again - his very favorite show!!,1204243200,,157,4.2
