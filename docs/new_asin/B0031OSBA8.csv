8492473,2,B0031OSBA8,"I bought this for my daughter and we did it together. Neither of us liked it. After trying it once, I couldn't convince her to do it again. It is very long and dull. I know yoga is supposed to have a peaceful way about it, but when you target teens I think you need to add a little personality to the mix to engage them. This was very ""blah"".",1489190400,,342,3.9

8492476,3,B0031OSBA8,For my grand daughter.  She loves it.  She does it with her baby brother.  He keeps it interesting.,1425340800,,99,4.388888888888889
8492477,5,B0031OSBA8,I did this yesterday with my 13 yr old daughter and we both had a blast. She's a bit of a couch potato so anything that gets her motivated is a blessing. Based on our experience I'm sure that this tape will see a lot more action in our household. Thank you Teen Yogi!,1393804800,2,267,3.962962962962963
8492478,5,B0031OSBA8,I showed this to a group of teens and parents who really enjoyed the workout. The teen yogis are very relatable and it will help make yoga more accessible to them. This is a long workout so if you're doing it with a group you may want to show only parts of it at a time.,1393027200,4,270,3.8392857142857144
8492479,4,B0031OSBA8,Sent as a gift to my granddaughter.  She invited her friends in to try it with her.  They all enjoyed it.,1373068800,,105,3.9523809523809526
8492480,2,B0031OSBA8,This should be separated into sections so a teen could choose which one to do.  What teen would have time to do this much yoga?,1368576000,4,127,4.08
8492481,5,B0031OSBA8,"this is a great routine  for teens and really the family can join and have
a peaceful moment  together, great to to at night to wrap the day",1357603200,4,140,3.9642857142857144
8492482,3,B0031OSBA8,The video spends WAY to much time telling you how to breath and to lie lifeless on your mat. (about 10 minutes!) IN general the poses are very good if you are looking for a video to relieve stress and get a small amount of exercise this would be great. If you were looking for a real exercise video this is not for you. It's very slow paced and some of the poses could use a little more instruction.,1342828800,7,399,4.063291139240507
