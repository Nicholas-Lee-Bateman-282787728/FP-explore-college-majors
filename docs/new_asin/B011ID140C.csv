8724288,5,B011ID140C,"I watch a lot of documentaries, but without question this film will stand out as one of my top five. Here are my reasons:
First is the uniqueness and complexity of Mateo himself, whose very being connects  4 wildly disparate cultures: Cuba, East Los Angeles, New Hampshire and Japan. That element alone makes this portrayal like no other. He is a truly global character. On top of everything, Mateo is quite endearing and intriguing in a R. Crumb way -- in some ways introverted and reclusive, in others communal and social, with a hunger for women minus the emotional attachment. Oh yeah, then there is his history of jail time, almost a side note (I applaud the filmmakers choice of resisting the temptation to go down that rabbit hole, which would have been easy to do, but distracting from the flow of the narrative)
The music in the film is beautiful. Mateo's voice is angelic. Wonderful to watch his Cuban recording sessions, the musicians all working just to make a buck.
Next, it is one of the truest portrayals I've seen of real life as a working musician: thankless and grueling most of the time, punctuated by rare moments of sublime transcendence. Every aspiring musician should be made to watch this film. It's inspiring to see Matt's dedication and determination to produce work of perfection, at any cost.
The cinematography is stunning. Part of that has to do with the technicolor beauty of urban Havana, but also at play is the filmmakers eye for aesthetics. Masterful shots of Los Angeles Mexican restaurants, the Cuban ocean, even the artists own trashed bedroom.
While Cuba is a popular tourist destination for Europeans and Asians, it is completely uncharted territory for most Americans, which adds an element of adventure to the film, taking us to a place we've never seen before. This is the Cuba without the clich&eacute;d motifs of Castro or baseball.
It took me a couple of times watching it before I noticed how much food and drink play a reoccurring theme throughout this film, whether it's Matteo's love for sweet drinks, eating fast food on the run to a gig, feeding alley cats, half melted ice cream in the hot streets of Havanah, sugar cubes and Cuban coffee, tuna pizza, subway sandwiches, or sipping miso soup before a gig in Japan. That plus the tropical heat of Cuba really brings the viewer's senses alive. Song, sugar, sex, sun, struggle, sweat.
This is an amazing film. My hat is off to the filmmakers for an incredible piece of cinematic art.",1493424000,,2483,4.787878787878788

8724290,4,B011ID140C,"A thoroughly thought provoking, touching, and also inspiring, yet sad depressing documentary. A man with a dream of music, yet stuck in the day to day reality of existing. Matthew was an up and coming singer with a promising music career, but in 1996 he went to prison for stealing. While in prison he learned to sing in Spanish. When he left prison, he changed his name to Mateo, and went with a new adventure in singing.

Mateo has an obsession, and love affair with Cuba. He travels there often, and now is taking another trip to record and put together a new album. His ultimate dream is to live in both places, America and Cuba.

Mateo is a different soul. A man who understands the soul of music, and the reality of the beating heart of sound. He has a fantastic voice. He is a very gifted musician. Creating, and writing flawless music.

This documentary is very different, very odd, very frank in many realities. It showcases Mateos living setting, which is a total mess, definitely a hoarder. It showcases Mateo seeking out the companionship of prostitutes. Mateo's desire to find love and companionship is also a depressing side of this individual. His work life and daily struggles are showcased. His estranged relationship with his mother and father is also displayed.

I think the movie expresses a sad soul with a beautiful voice. It's almost a little too depressing in showcasing Mateo's ordeal, but it also displays the ultimate desire, and fortitude to never give up.

Something that is expressed is his reality. Some of his fault, is his own doing. His sexual appetite to spend money on prostitutes. That reality can also be looked at, as his loneliness, his desire to have companionship, or find someone to love as he sees fit. He washes away his pain, his demons. He try's so hard I think at times, he loses his way, or becomes more lost.

This is directed by Aaron I. Naar. This being his first feature length documentary. Naar created something unique and personal. This documentary is a character study, a biography that leaves a lasting impression.

He spent 7 years, and 350,000 dollars to complete his album of Cuban music. His desire. His approach, and ultimate will, is a truly fascinating experience that is unique. A very impressive documentary. Brilliant viewing. A very impressive character study. Mateo is someone filled with a desire that many of us lack. His desire is his ultimate reality. His passion for music inspires. His love for music makes this film come to life, and gives you an experience that lingers on your mind after the last shot.

A perfect blend of outrageous personality with a solid soundtrack of music. A film dressed up with total originality, and a life inspiration that lingers on a dramatic understanding of dreams, will power, and the quest for Cuban putang.
