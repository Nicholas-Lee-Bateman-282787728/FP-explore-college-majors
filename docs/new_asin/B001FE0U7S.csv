8301974,4,B001FE0U7S,"Since I really enjoyed this series when I was younger, I saw no problem with buying the first two seasons and honestly, after watching both I only had a few minor issues with them.

Although these are obvious bootlegs that are taken from the internet, they play pretty smoothly with minor audio fuzz here and there but a true Digimon fan will be pleased none the less. Season 1 was pretty clean all the way through with very little audio issues in the last few episodes (ep50-54). Season 2 on the other hand sounds like it's directly off the net through most of the season, which is sort of a drag, but not a huge issue. The price of these seasons is pretty ridiculous as well, especially for technical bootlegs. I'm still debating on buying Season 3 and possibly even 4 for these reasons, but other then those small problems, I'm pleased with my purchase. I also really like the casing. It looks good and keeps the discs safe. I also recieved the seasons sooner then I was told. Since I'm from canada, I figured it would have taken till almost September to recieve them but they were delivered about two, almost three weeks later. If you loved the original series, then I suggest investing in at least the first two seasons, just remember that these dvds aren't official, so expect minor issues.",1279843200,,1296,4.562231759656652
8301975,4,B001FE0U7S,"I first saw Digimon several years ago, as a slightly younger girl. At the time, I had about four TV channels, and actually, still do. However, every once in a while I was able to find someone with cable and could finally watch some decent TV. Digimon was one of the shows that I watched, and one of the shows I quickly became obsessed with, like most children might. It was very upsetting that I could never see the whole show, and only saw one episode every few monthes. So, as soon as I was old enough to own a debit card and buy things off the internet, the Digimon box sets happened to be some of the first things I set my eyes on.

After looking through at least ten different websites for the best price, I landed on Amazon. Believe me, it's the best one I've seen, and I've seen a lot.

The only noticeable problems with the box sets are that a) the dvds don't stay in their designated places very well (I'm constantly having them fall out when I close the box, or not stay in place very well to begin with.) and b) the final disc of season two has some serious issues. Those issues being: an unprecedented change in voice actors during an episode, and bad sound quality throughout several episodes. (I noticed it on the second or third episode of the disc, it sounded somewhat scratchy and I had to turn the volume up quite a bit to hear anything. This continued for several episodes.)

Other than that, everything was wonderful, and I am very happy to finally have seen the entirety of both season one and two. I expect to enjoy these DVDs for a long time to come and can't wait to share them with my children some day.",1247097600,5,1628,4.279220779220779
8301976,5,B001FE0U7S,"Digimon season 01 is the first season of this amazing show called Digimon.
Season one takes place during Summer Camp, where seven kids were magically transported to another world known as the Digial World. They must work together to stop evil.
Digimon Season 02 is the follow up of Adventure, but features three new digidestined, ones chosen to save the Digital World. TK and Kari are the only ones who are fully Digidestined. Both of the sets together is 2080 minutes.",1243468800,,469,4.802469135802469
8301977,4,B001FE0U7S,"Don't get me wrong: I grew up watching this show, and I'm absolutely ecstatic that it's now out on DVD. However, it's not like I remember it. The episodes are awkwardly cut at some points, and all the writing (notes, Digimon analysis entries, etc.) are in Japanese. Also, compatibility is an issue. The discs play fine in my laptop, but not in my portable DVD player (O.O). I haven't tried them yet in my actual DVD player. The packaging I like, all six discs stacked into a book-style case. The titles seem to be put in after production; capitalization and spelling are off sometimes.

All in all, since when it plays it's great, four stars.",1241395200,4,642,4.582608695652174
8301978,3,B001FE0U7S,"The series:

I have searched for a Digimon Box set for YEARS. It was by far my favorite childhood cartoon and I am so glad I bought it!!!

The actual item:

The Disks are held in by cheap clear plastic. Even as a ""brand new factory sealed package"" the inner most parts of the disks were a little scratched (and I'm assuming it's because of the kind of case).

Also, I do not own a ""dvd player"" I have a PS2 and a laptop. The disks do not work in my PS2. But because they work in my laptop I decided to keep them and not make a big fuss.

Overall, the series is wonderful, and the product was worth buying, just be aware of it's compatibility and casing.",1236556800,,653,4.0310077519379846
8301979,5,B001FE0U7S,"After waiting years for the release of these boxsets, I ended up putting off purchasing them. I finally decided ""why wait any longer"", when I had been wanting them for so long. I'm so glad I got them. These two season of Digimon are the best out of the four seasons of the series. Digimon fans should not be without these boxsets. Although, the price is ridiculous.",1232150400,5,365,4.462686567164179
