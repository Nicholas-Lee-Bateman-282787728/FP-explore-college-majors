5421618,5,B00AFDN5Y0,"A couple of months ago my other sister Melissa and I went to see  one of the most amazing movies that I have seen my whole life. That movie is called ""A Perfect Ending"" by Nicole Conn (And Family), it quickly became one of my favorite movies. People who know me well would say that it's only my favorite because it has some breathtaking love scenes but that's not the case, it's actually far from the truth for me. I mean they were how do I find the words, beautiful and intense, so real, but that's not why I love it. For me and this is the message that I get from it, is that sometimes in life you spend a good part of it, living a way or in a situation that well you don't want to be in but that you can't leave. You do things, forget and forgive things that you shouldn't and it sometimes tears you down. But in an instant, a moment that you least expect it, if allowed your life can change. You become the person that maybe you use to know and you hid it to please others, and then to finally reach the surface again and be set free is life changing.

Both of those women, their lives changed and they probably didn't expect it to be a woman to change it. But love knows no gender and the heart wants what it wants, and a lot of the time it wins, sooner or later. Although it was short, it was beautiful (The women who portrayed them are beautiful) and it made them better. It wasn't each characters perfect ending I'm sure, but for others love and being in love was. I can go on and on, but I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it. I love it though and it has made an impact in my life, you have to love yourself and know your worth. (You know in the end I believe that is when she felt the most alive, and that maybe for her it was ""A Perfect Ending"".)

I guess it taught me that sometimes you have to do the unexpected, and for me this is unexpected.

I absolutely love and recommend this movie... It's a must see...",1355443200,7,1931,4.033942558746737
5421619,5,B00AFDN5Y0,"I saw this movie at a film festival and was so moved and touched by this well written and presented story. Barbara Niven is spectacular. I'm still impacted by her performance. Jessica Clark delivers a spell binding role with that smoky voice, look and sexuality. A WOW! Nicole Conn has written and created a film that we will talk about for years- re-visiting it and learning every time we do. Remember the impact of High Art? or Elena Undone? This s not just a lesbian love story. This is a story of two women coming together to find themselves. And we viewers as voyeurs are privileged to follow them on their journey. A must watch!",1355097600,8,634,4.521739130434782
5421620,5,B00AFDN5Y0,"Let me begin by saying, the chemistry between Rebecca, brilliantly portrayed by Barbara Niven, and Paris, played by the amazing Jessica Clark, left me speechless.  I can't find the words to convey how powerful their on screen chemistry is.  You must experience it yourself.

For me, this movie is the first film I can recall watching about a subject many women deal with every single day, including myself.  The challenge of aging and feeling good about ourselves is ongoing for many of us.  As we mature and grow older, we sometimes settle for life being what it is each day, not even recognizing we are missing passion in our lives.  This is a compelling and powerful story about Rebecca, a mother and wife, looking for passion and Paris, a high priced call girl and artist, who is trying to overcome her own personal struggles.  This multilayered film is brilliantly written and the story presented in a way which is moving and thought provoking.  Quite frankly, it changed my life.  And while I recognize this may not be the case for all who see it, for me personally, it opened my eyes and helped me realize that I am who I am, and I am perfectly me.  Seeing a bit of myself in Rebecca and witnessing the power and strength she embraced to overcome her doubts and fears in `A Perfect Ending' allowed me to choose a new beginning.  This film will make you think about where you at in your life and question, is this where I want to be and am I living my life with passion each day.",1354838400,219,1485,4.462962962962963

5421673,5,B00AFDN5Y0,"This movie portrays a journey that so many women can relate to: of courage, personal growth, self acceptance, willingness to change, to be brave and stand up for the right. It is a movie about transformation and being true to yourself, about being honest and doing everything you have to to protect those you love.
Every time you watch it, you will find something new because it has many subtle layers. Truly a work of art by a director that knows the soul of a woman.",1493164800,,468,4.453488372093023

5421788,5,B00AFDN5Y0,"I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys watching two women together, whose lovemaking scenes seem ""real"" and not forced. First we meet Rebecca, played exquisitely by the beautiful and sexy Barbara Niven, who was 58 or 59 when this movie was made. I give her laudation for letting go of any inhibitions she may have had about doing nudity at her age. Delectable breasts and stretch marks on her belly, for which I'm thankful to Nicole for not covering them with make-up. It makes her character more real, more believable. I still found her body to be exquisite and sensual. She is an upper-class, prim and proper housewife, whose husband hasn't touched her in years. She has two friends she confides in that are married lesbians. When we first meet them, immediately it's, wait, Rebecca is friends with them?While visiting them, Rebecca makes a confession...in her whole life, she's never experienced an orgasm. She so much wants to feel the pleasure and the release. After they get over the shock of her confession, they tell her she needs to be with a woman. One of them says she has a cousin that could definitely help her. She runs a high-priced escort service. Rebecca tells her to ask for someone around her own age. The madam sends her older girl, but unbeknownst to her, the girl switches jobs with the much younger girl that showed up at Rebecca's door. When Rebecca answers the door to the hotel room, in front of her stands Paris, a tall, dark and beautiful woman, but half her age. Played by the sensuous and sexy Jessica Clark. Rebecca is visibly upset because she specifically requested someone closer to her own age, so she sends Paris away. Only to call back the next day to ask for ""the same girl"". The madam, unaware of the switch, sends the older girl. Rebecca is very nervous and upset. She tells her to go away, you're not who I asked for. The girl sees her losing control, but messes with her a bit before she leaves. She calls once again, but this time specifically requests Paris by name. I have to say, throughout the movie, they meet almost everyday. Paris has a secret she's been holding inside, but no one, not even Rebecca is allowed to know it. Paris does what she does, but to her it's just a job, she doesn't let feelings get involved. Until, Rebecca. Rebecca is also keeping a secret, but she has also told no one. Not Paris, her husband nor her children. The most memorable and heartfelt scenes in this movie are between Rebecca & Paris and not just because they're love scenes. When we see Rebecca for the first time she is alone and upset. She's constantly on edge, always nervous. Her family wants to know what's going on with her. She's been acting strangely for weeks. When we see Paris for the first time she is with a john. But once she goes home, she's alone and upset. The scenes they have together are like watching a metamorphosis. They are both caterpillars at the beginning, one so nervous, she has to drink before she goes any further and the other uncaring and void of any emotion. As their time together passes, you will gradually see the changes that happen to each of them separately and together. Towards the end you will see two very beautiful butterflies emerge from their cocoons. This movie touched me so much. I watched it Saturday night with my wife, it's now Wednesday and it's still on my mind. I know it's only a movie, but it touched my heart and soul very deeply. There haven't been all that many movies that do that to me.

Nicole Conn, on to the next please!",1462320000,,3534,4.547880690737833

I admit to thinking the acting was rather bland or predictable in parts, but I've come to expect that in most BadWolf production movies.  They are not big-budget actor movies, BUT they do often do well with what they have.",1455494400,,470,4.5058823529411764

5421830,5,B00AFDN5Y0,"A Perfect Ending is a remarkable film filled with the fragrance of love. It reminds me that beauty exists in our world. The kind where you are overcome with the beauty of an extraordinary flower or of a Jessica.  It fills my being with awe.  The introduction of the DVD bonus section with Barbara and Jessica joyfully laughing with each other makes my heart smile. Their empathy is literally ""beyond beliefs"".  When we give our attention to and receive that indescribable joyous feeling, our very essence is revealed.  We are love, exquisite and very precious. This lovely story of surrender to love is a rare gift for us all.
I am one of the many people whose life has changed with seeing this film.  I start my day with coffee and ""the movie"".  Nicole writes from her movie ""Elena Undone"" about snails that sleep for three years, half their life span.  I on the other hand have slept almost my whole lifespan waking up now with regrets and also very grateful that I am waking up even if it's in the last rays of my sunset.
Because of this movie I am assimilating the dots of many years of workshop experiences. Feeling the loving tenderness, sensuality and enjoying the humor has brought lightness into my life, and life into my body.  No !  It's not just the coffee and endorphin's (well maybe a little). A big jump for me was accepting myself as I am.  Just  one of the many issues this film brings to light.
A wholehearted thank you and appreciation for everyone who made this film happen !  Especially that wizard Nicole who made the magic of Jessica and Barbara come alive as she spun her mystical tale.  I just can't say enough about how wonderful this movie is.  The synergy between the cast and crew seems lovely.  The actors make their roles so real and natural.  The artistry and symbolism is unique and intriguing and some still puzzling to me. The soundtrack is cellular in me at this point.  Then their is the amazing artistic genius of the man behind his camera.

My wife died last year with cancer.  I am a believer who wants to believe leaving her body was a ""small death"". That she did follow her truth and realized herself in the end.  She was a warrior with a strong will.  Her surrendering consciously was a different pathway from Rebecca's. She asked myself and her adult twin daughters to keep her conscious with medications only to keep her out of pain.  At the end she glanced in the direction of her girls.  She could not see nor could she speak but uttered sounds of pure love and tenderness and then she seriously chastised them with her last advise.  As she transformed she surrendered at last her warriors way to become freedom itself.  The butterfly brings for me a soft, quiet stillness both sad and peaceful.

It came highly recommended to me but I was unsure about it since Nicole Conn was the director and I remember Claire of the Moon all too well.  I decided to rent the 3-day download just to see if I liked it or not before purchasing the DVD, and I was pleasantly surprised.  Actually, blown away would be a better term for it.  Yes, there was a tiny bit of Claire of the Moon overdramatics in there, but it's easily overlooked when I consider the rest of the movie.  I'd never heard of either Barbara Niven or Jessica Clark before, although Ms. Niven does look familiar.  However, Ms. Clark was completely unfamiliar to me, as I've never watched True Blood.  They were both perfect in their roles, especially Ms. Clark.  She's one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen, and she nailed the sensual Paris to a T.  This movie is my new obsession.  I immediately ordered the DVD, which arrived today thanks to my Prime subscription, and I'm sure I'll be watching it frequently.

A Perfect Ending fell short in all of those areas. It was extremely disappointing. The storyline wasn't believable. The dialog and the transition of the plot seem so overdramatized and forced. All the events were so extreme. The husband needed to seem like an uncaring person so the story randomly reveals he molested her daughter. Paris' true/first love died tragically when she playfully pushed him into oncoming traffic, and now she gives back by performing sexual favors. Wtf? And, the ""twist"" at the end was so abrupt and poorly executed. The most unfortunate shortcoming though was the lack of chemistry! They achieved maybe an intimate caring for each other but not a tornmenting, desperate passion like we would have hoped.

5422005,5,B00AFDN5Y0,"The film depicts Rebecca's last journey from fulfilling society's role as a wife and mother to self-fulfilment wherein she finds and expresses what might romantically be called 'true love'.  To get to this point involves an emotional and erotic involvement with another woman, a high class prostitute named Paris, a seductive,dark-haired,full-lipped beauty who helps Rebecca find her way,eventually, to her true nature.

This 'true nature' as she once perceived it was almost anathema to her,regarding herself as 'straight'. However,following the groove of routine has not made her happy at all and it takes a meeting with her lesbian friends to take the plunge into a relationship. Paris is bi-sexual in that she takes care of the detail in her encounters with clients. Paris works for Valentina, a madam who organises a call-girl service. However, so scared is Rebecca of what might develop that their encounters in a hotel room get off to some false starts.  Paris,however, persists in her task and slowly takes over Rebecca's body in an erotic scene and gives her the first orgasm she has ever had.  Nicole Conn takes her time with this scene as it was the crux of the matter as from then on, Rebecca becomes mistress of herself.

The tragedy was that Rebecca is dying of cancer but, even at the end of her life, she found a living paradise. The relationship between Paris and Rebecca develops to an extent when Rebecca states 'I love you' to her guide to her real self. In the background is a selfish husband, Mason, who is a businessman running a firm which may hit the buffers unless he transfers his stock to his wife,probably as a tax avoidance. He only wants his boys to inherit his fortune and not Jessica,the daughter. The siblings get along fine but are rather mystified when Mum doesn't turn up for dinner one night for her son's snooty girlfriend giving an idea of the shallow world of high society - a world of appearances and expensive restaurants. When her doctor tells her the bad news of her terminal illness, Rebecca hires a female lawyer to look after her interests when the stock is transferred to her.

Another strand of the film is the artist Paris. There was an engaging metaphor as she assembled broken pieces of glass and made a pictorial statement ; from the pieces of life one can build a complete picture or work of art. She has done that with Rebecca.  This is what Nicole Conn has done with the film too via her editing as opposing images, her experiences of her shallow life outside her marriage so crass and lifeless and the physical satisfaction of life with Paris, are shown in short,subsequent shots rather like flashbacks. These occur before Rebecca's transformation into a complete woman where the 'other half' of her life, the rituals of marriage and societal commitments, become irrelevant.  She becomes her own person.

The title engenders the idea of perfection. The whole piece is a mixture of elements; the life of Paris; the loveless marriage of Rebecca, the first halting steps to find herself and the fact that her death was a beginning for all concerned. There probably is a love of symmetry in all of us, especially in storytelling, and the film provided this although it is rare in real life that everything works out all right in the end.

5422007,5,B00AFDN5Y0,"This brilliant family drama portrays the life of a Stepford wife, namely a football mom, whose personal life has been in a rut and has been involved in nameless conflicts with her husband, who at one point in time, had illicit intercourse with his stepdaughter, but has callously left her out of his will, which leaves all of his company shares to his sons, who deviously wrestles her husband's company shares from under his nose and incorporates in her will the equal sharing of portions between all her siblings (thereby, guaranteeing, her daughter an equal share in the family wealth), and realizing that her cancer was terminal, decides to find true love and passion in the form of a social escort that was introduced to her by her lesbian friends, who convince her to have intercourse with a woman - for women are truly better lovers than men, and, thereby, are able to bring her to the orgasm that she has never experienced with men, gingerly rejecting all advances from the social escorts at first but, eventually, finding herself slowly being drawn to a call girl of Indian origin (who used to be an artist but chose the life of prostitution after her boyfriend was killed by a car), and, gradually, finds herself being seduced by this social escort and falls in love with her, first without reciprocity but, eventually, inducing a reciprocal amount of passion and love from her lesbian lover in an art du art movie that features a high degree of pointillism (high pointless moments whose significance is designed by the director to remain obscure to the viewer and is suffused with abstruse but highly symbolic allusions.

Truly a lesbian movie to be cherished by all from the LGBT community as well as those with a love for lesbian movies.

5422032,1,B00AFDN5Y0,"This is soft porn with only one really good emotionally riveting scene. With that one exception the script is awful and unrealistic and the editing atrocious. I realize this is a low budget film so I applaud the producer and director for even getting it released. However, with greater attention to detail and more time spent on creating a story and dialogue that more closely reflects the human experience you could have created something with merit. I suppose the intention here was to create a movie mainly for the Lesbian population. You perhaps succeeded there but unfortunately I think you also succeeded in insulting our intelligence. Come on we deserve better...much better.
One final observation and I really struggled whether or not to include this in my comments. I realize this is a movie and movies are frequently about ""make believe"" but sometimes that ""make believe"" crosses over the line of decency as I think was the case with this movie. If anyone has ever been around a brave cancer patient ( and all cancer patients are incredibly brave) who is in the final few months of Stage IV metastasized cancer then......need I say more.

5422075,5,B00AFDN5Y0,"While a lot of lesbian films have contrived plots that are nothing more than excuses to showcase sapphic love, this claim cannot be made for this movie.  Barbara Niven plays a middle aged woman who is in a listless marriage.  With the efficacy of adding some fun to her life, 2 lesbian friends of her's talk her into hiring an escort girl.  It's supposed to be a middle aged escort girl, but a young vivacious woman (played by Jessica clark) shows up instead.

Such is the story of a woman's search for love & finding it in the most unexpected places.  A young lady being intimate with a woman who is old enough to be her mother is quite unconventional......but it also offers some of the best girl/girl scenes I've ever seen!  THIS film is why I prefer softcore girl/girl movies to hardcore ones;  we get sensual passion, love and softness that's altogether lacking in most porn flicks.

If you're looking for a lesbian movie that ALSO has a compelling storyline, then this DVD should be @ the top of your list.  The story is realistic and the scenes in the bedroom are erotic.  If Sappho were around today, this DVD would be in her collection!!",1398816000,13,1146,4.519417475728155

I love Nicole Conn's films but this one has something that none of the others do: BARBARA NIVEN. She gives a most beautiful and brave portrayal of overcoming a lifetime of insecurities and unhappiness to find the beauty in herself and passion for another. I'll watch anything she's in now.

5422114,5,B00AFDN5Y0,"I'm giving this movie 5 stars (because it's that good) but it's like giving ""Gone With The Wind"" 5 stars and then saying I hate the ending because Rhett left Scarlet for good. A Perfect Ending is a beautiful movie tied up in a neat bow that I, and many others, wish was not there. The neat bow being Conn's IDEA of a ""perfect"" ending. Like most who have viewed this movie, I think the two leads were made for their parts and for each other as romantic leads. I can't imagine anyone else portraying Rebecca except Barbara Niven and I can't imagine anyone else portraying Paris except Jessica Clark. Their chemistry is amazing. The way they play off each other so naturally and so believably makes the viewer feel like they're spying on real people through a telescope (without making the viewer feel the least bit uncomfortable in doing so). That is rare. That is movie magic. A once in a lifetime gift to any director or screen writer. It's like being given a never before seen Rembrandt and all you have to do is frame it for the public to view it. Simple, right? Maybe for a seasoned Hollywood pro but, sadly, not for Nicole Conn with her obvious lack of imagination and genuine compassion for the lesbian community. Case in point: That ridiculous ending. Therefore, she expects multitudes of people to spend time and money viewing this movie, getting to know the characters, investing their emotions in the two leads and their stories and, especially, their falling in love with each other only to have the central character (the one the storyline is literally built around) die and leave her lover and countless viewers to grieve and wonder why. And that's just my first problem!

As someone else said, in another review, it's like Conn edited this movie with a hatchet instead of a scalpel and that's not what viewers want to see. They want to see, instead, seemless editing that helps the story to make sense. Like a smooth, flowing river without the need for anyone asking questions or saying ""huh?"" Because that is what a movie does. It tells a story while drawing in the viewier emotionally and holding that viewer's rapt attention until the breathless ending, sometimes making the viewer only craving more. That is a good movie. From time to time, if we're lucky, we get to see a great movie. And Conn, believe it or not, had the elements of a great movie if she could only have put them together in a much more inventive and satisfying way. If it had been me directing and writing...

#1 -- No wasting the viewers' time with artsy close-ups of objects between scenes in order to cover up choppy editing. A clumsy, amateur move avoided.
#2 -- No scenes of Paris satisfying her johns sexually. She's a call girl. We get it. The mere title of her profession is enough. No need to prove it explicitly.
#3 -- No scenes of Paris in her ""white room"" of sorrow. Showing Paris looking sad while creating her art (along with brief flashback scenes of her having fun with her new husband on their honeymoon) was enough to establish that she was carrying a heavy grief. To spend all that time with Paris suffering in the white room, over and over, was a big waste of time. Time that could have been spent better.
#4 -- No explicit sex scenes involving Paris and her boyfriend/husband. What's wrong with Conn? Why would she think her biggest audience and greatest supporters (the lesbian community) would want to see that? I'm still stumped.
#5 -- No loud music covering up the real music -- that of Rebecca's and Paris' sweet words to each other while making love. I would give anything to know what they were saying to each other during those scenes. Over and over, I've tried to read their lips to no avail. And when there was no music at all, they whispered! What is up with that? An audience wants to hear what lovers say to each other during their most tender moments of passion. Especially those two!
#6 -- No raping of Rebecca's daughter by her husband. That is the biggest waste of time in the whole movie. What is it for? What does it establish? How does it propel the storyline forward? It doesn't. It just lies there. If anything, it shows how spineless Rebecca was for not leaving her husband over such a horrible act. All it did was make her retreat into a world of booze and the pretense of a perfect life.
#7 -- No scene involving Rebecca and the older hooker, Sylvie. Another big waste of time. All it accomplished was more pain and shame for Rebecca with Sylvie telling her she was on the wrong side of the clock, tick, tock, reminding her that the best part of her life was gone AND that she had a redwood stick up her Doris Day a**. Resulting in Rebecca screaming at Sylvie to get out of the hotel room.
#8 -- The biggie. NO terminal illness for Rebecca. Otherwise, the first half of the movie makes no sense. There is Rebecca, having fun with her lesbian friends, confiding her deepest secret with them, they come up with a solution to her secret while joyfully laughing about it, a cousin (Madam) is contacted about securing the talents of a beautiful, young lady in her employ for Rebecca, etc. It was all so light hearted and happy and it should have been kept that way, except for the passion displayed between the two leads during their love scenes and their scenes of getting to know each other better. That way, everything else would have made better sense and it would have made a much more romantic story.

HUGE CASE IN POINT: Rebecca runs home, after having missed dinner by a couple of hours, and her three grown children are waiting for her with angry looks and questions about papers that were found in their father's desk drawer. What they were angry about and what they were accusing their mother of is all very confusing -- in order to keep Conn's little surprise ending in tact. But it falls flat because none of the dialogue in that scene makes any sense. Of course, when Rebecca looks at the papers (thrusted angrily at her by her son, Aaron), she sees the report about her inoperable, terminal cancer. But why would that make her sons so angry? Then her daughter says, ""Mom, you knew about this?"" Why wouldn't Rebecca know about her own illness? And when Rebecca says, ""You are not to say a word about this to your father until I've had a chance to speak to him,"" both sons jump up and shout ""What?!"" Then her son, Hank, says angrily, ""This is going to change everything!"" Is this how children react to their mother being terminally ill? Anger? When Rebecca first arrived, the children wanted to know if their father was with her. When she answered no, one of the sons said, ""Yeah, and we know why."" (Again, with anger.) No, they would not have reacted with anger at the news of their mother being terminally ill BUT they would have reacted with anger at the news of their mother having an affair with a beautiful woman. I'm reminded of an interview with Nicole Conn and in that interview she stated what a joy it was to discover how easy it is to edit a movie into anything you want it to be after it's been filmed. So my theory is this: She must have been planning to film a happy ending for Rebecca and Paris all along but something else seized her when she discovered those easy editing tricks and then decided to turn the ending into something entirely different. That of a tragic ending involving Rebecca's demise but she forgot how some scenes that were already shot would figure into that. For example: After the angry children scene, Rebecca waited for her husband to come home in order to tell him about her illness and she asks him, ""How long have you known?"" He answers, ""A few weeks."" Then, when his face is completely out of the picture, we hear him say something about going to see her doctor. That was just a cheap insert after the scene had been shot. Instead, having Rebecca tell her husband that she wanted out of the marriage because of her unhappiness and unfullment would have been so much more romantic because it would have been because of her love and passion for Paris. And it would have made better sense to the rest of that scene because her husband ended up saying that they could ""fix it"" and Rebecca answered by saying it was way too late for that and then she left him sitting there pondering what she had just said. Her husband saying they could ""fix"" her cancer made no sense at all BUT her husband saying they could ""fix"" their faltering marriage made perfect sense. So I think, in essense, Conn literally made two different movies, one with a tragic ending and one with a happy ending. I just wish she would release the one with the happy ending on dvd because her lesbian audience and supporters deserve it. One more thing. I think that the magazine, Curve, missed the memo about Conn's final version that she released because they took and printed photos of Barbara Niven and Jessica Clark in some very questionable poses and outfits. Like both dressed in white, standing close together, resembling wedding photos? And there's another photo shoot depicting them in very close poses, wearing identical wedding rings! Waaaa! I like it!

Then there are the why's. Why did Paris cry after Rebecca made love to her?
Why wasn't Paris shown telling Rebecca that she had quit the call girl service?
Why weren't we allowed to hear Rebecca tell Paris why she wanted to end their relationship? And what she said after that while she rocked a weeping Paris.
Why, why, why. I know there are so many more. That's what happens when a script is full of holes, the editing is choppy, and the audience ends up feeling empty and unfullfilled. That's what happens when Nicole Conn makes a movie.",1394236800,3,9652,4.535857716580608

5422123,1,B00AFDN5Y0,"So tired of lesbian movies that have s*x scenes with MEN! For the first HOUR of this movie there are disgusting scenes with men pretty much every 5 minutes. Why do American directors of lesbian films think we want to see nasty scenes with men - that is the whole reason we watch a lesbian film is so we don't have to watch that crap. there are ways of making it known to the audience that s*x occurred without actually showing it. it was not necessary to be so graphic and visual when your audience is gay and does not want to see men!
The scenes with the women are not memorable enough to make up for all the nasty scenes you have to watch before it gets to the women scenes. Then there is a scene with the husband trying to rape his daughter - why the hell would you put that in a movie called ""the perfect ending""? That scene is short but disturbing enough to be the one scene that sticks in your head more than anything else in the whole movie.
If you want a movie that ticks you off then this is a good choice.
just as things start to get good - you get pissed off again because the main lady dies.
It really is a shame the director ruined this movie with so much disgusting scenes with men because the women really played their roles well and had good chemistry.",1390608000,4,1268,4.137651821862348

True to Nicole Conn form, the acting is over the top; the story is over the top, etc... What makes the whole mash palatable are the tasteful and nicely explicit lesbian sex scenes...  However, unlike the chemistry between the main characters in Elena Undone, I felt no chemistry between the main characters in A Perfect Ending.

5422164,5,B00AFDN5Y0,"First, I have watched the movie multiple times.  Second, since watching it the first time, I have done a lot of research on the director, characters, and the making of this movie.  I say those things because they all have an influence on my rating and review.

I love this movie more than any other movie I have ever seen.  I think it's because the movie draws you in so very much and you begin to feel what the characters feel.  Watching a movie and enjoying it as a watcher is very different than watching a movie you become part of, or rather it becomes a part of you.  The latter is far more powerful because it stays with you long after the movie ends and that is very much the case with A Perfect Ending.

Prior to watching this movie, I had seen Elena Undone.  I did not realize until after watching A Perfect Ending they were both Nicole Conn films.  I am now a huge fan of her.  She is so passionate about her craft.  She did an amazing job casting her two leads in Barbara Niven & Jessica Clark.  Their on screen chemistry was off the charts.  Nicole found Jessica Clark through Facebook, what an amazing find!  Jessica is a newbie to acting, but you would never guess that by watching the film.  She is so perfectly Paris.

As for Barbara Niven, in a word, WOW!  First of all, she is beautiful, inside and out.  Her courage in taking on the role of Rebecca is truly inspirational.  She personally related to her character and that shows through in her performance, without a doubt.  Take note of the tear at the end of the first love scene.  She was 'all in' for this movie and displayed amazing bravery in doing so.  I don't know how you can watch this movie and not emerge as a Barbara Niven fan, if you weren't already.

Many of the negative reviews have focused on things like editing and all the artsy images.  This film was made on a shoestring budget, by all accounts, something in the neighborhood of $175,000.  If you expect flawless editing in a movie, this one may not be for you.  If you can't appreciate artistry and some symbolism, likewise this one may not be for you.

I just cannot express how much I enjoyed this movie, not just the first time, but every time I have watched it since. Kudos to Nicole Conn, Barbara Niven, and Jessica Clark for coming together to create an amazing, life changing movie.",1387497600,9,2331,4.3604651162790695

I would have liked to be able to hear what the ladies are saying to each other at the more passionate moments, tho.  I actually found myself getting emotional before I got hot LOL!

""ACTUAL"" issues that many of my female friends have gone or are currently going through. In my most humble opinion, the artistry and filming and photography of this movie was ABSOLUTELY ASTOUNDING!!!!

I have been a fan of Barbara Niven's performances for years, I remember her in her first TV commercials. The chemistry Ms. Niven had with the up and coming Jessica Clark just fueled what passion a lot of women don't have.

My kudos to reviewers Joyce and Ms. Deb Gallardo. Ms. Gallardo's review was OUTSTANDING and couldn't  have been written any better than that...

I will recommend this film to some of my lady friends in hopes that they use an open mind to the loving passion Ms. Niven & Ms. Clark portrayed.

Creepy because it involves an older, sexually frustrated woman hiring a younger female prostitute to help her experience ""passion."" Fascinating because they fall in love and that would have been nice but they are both tortured by their pasts and other relationships and I bought into all that and could go with it. There's lots of explicit love making that is a bit hard to take at times because it is their intimacy and not ours and I don't always enjoy too much information about that. The producer or director has an unusual sensibility in that there are many sort of ""poetic"" scenes intercut throughout the action that slow everything down, as with, for example, a closeup of an ant walking the edge of a table, and many strange interludes of one of the characters rolled up in a fetal position, implying her great suffering. I could have done without all these extra interpretive visuals that are supposed to explain her inner world.

be it unconscious or not was wonderful. At times I found the acting to be too false and that kinda make me disappointed. But the up side
is that Jessica Clark was in it. So all will be forever forgiven just for that one important factor. Barbara Niven gave a great performance opposite
a female love interest. Their chemistry was....hubba hubba. Jessica's line ""you are simply too much"" was screamingly perfect. I loved this movie for many reasons 1 being Jessica Clark, 2 story line, 3 Jessica Clark is English and the accent with that body and face.....well enuff said, 4 the evolution of themselves was beautiful. The movie was awesome, I loved it 100%. This is my opinion, it may or may not be yours, and that ok. One thing is the ending-didn't care for it only because we all like the fairy tale, though said ending was a catalyst for much needed healing.

5422224,1,B00AFDN5Y0,"With no prior knowledge of this movie outside of the synopsis I foolishly pressed 'x' on the controller of my Playstation intrigued by the cover and also prompted by my mood to watch a lesbian oriented movie.  I knew better than to expect grade A acting, best case scenario there would be enough chemistry between the characters to enjoy the obligatory lesbian sex scene.  Though not even twenty minutes in I realized that I said yes to a conceptually charged film with all the trimmings I didn't have an appetite for nor did it entice me as I continued to watch.  And as I watched I swallowed the annoyance of the cutaways, the random 'quirky' accents that I'm assuming should have complimented our characters, and the forced scenes that elicited disbelief rather than sympathy.

If you're into watching films that layer the characters in annoying extremes or writing that generates little depth or films that throw in random twists to impersonate depth then by all means this is the film for you.

(Spoiler ahead)
The characters are underdeveloped given vague tags (that may as well have been written in marker on their foreheads for how subtly it was executed) of how the audience should feel about them through minimal interactions with the main characters.  While the only people given the time of day for the audience to have an idea who they are are immersed in a push and pull that had me rooting for the prostitute to walk.  The housewife's indecision about whether this is really for her took up most of the film.  The first time could pass for cute, second time she didn't get what she wanted chalked up to mis-communication, third time I suppose it would have been just too cliche to give in.  And in the midst of all that we're greeted with these less than intriguing scenes that unveiled our characters at their core.  Somewhere along the way feelings developed and I'm not one to bash a montage (this is where I'm assuming is where they did all the connecting) but it left me wanting.  I'm told the film was meant to be felt and not analyzed perhaps mirroring the abandon the housewife should aspire to (concept cool execution sucked).  If anything I felt all these positive reviews were unfair to people who use public opinion unlike people like me who deserve what they get for falling prey to flashy covers, hot lesbians, and an inquisitive dare I say masochist nature.",1378598400,7,2387,4.697841726618705

Barbara and Jessica nailed their characters...so much so, it seemed real.  I learned so much from Rebecca.  Vulnerability, letting go of control, trust, freeing oneself and so much more.

5422256,5,B00AFDN5Y0,"I NEVER write reviews about movies - but this was not an average movie.  I read a few of the negative reviews and if you are expecting a typical movie then this is not your cup of tea.  Nicole Conn has made a film in the true sense of cinematic art.  The cinematography is fantastic, the extreme close ups to the wider view of the picture, replicating the experience of Rebecca and Paris - BRILLIANT.  I will admit I had to watch it twice to see the meaning in some scenes that at first I thought not relevant, but each moment moved character development forward without endless needless dialoge - thank you.  When Rebecca's daughter is talking to Ace about it's not to late, that is the moment life changes for Rebecca - the next scene is the begining of her love afair with Paris.  Again, this is a nuanced film, each scene has meaning.  SPOILER: In the very first shots of Rebecca going through her calendar you see below lunch with Mason her doctor's appointment - I caught that on the 3rd viewing of the movie.

I have always liked Barbara Niven, and I can now say I have a HUGE crush on her.  Jessica Clark is a beautiful woman, but all the sexy came from Niven.  Rebecca was played perfectly from insecure moments, to allowing herself to embrace the passion she wanted and portraying it in such a real way.  Ultimately that is what sold this movie, I believe Rebecca is a woman falling in love, the way she looks into Paris' eyes before a kiss, the no holds barred sex (loved the scene at the hotel door).  Thank you Nicole Conn for making a love scene that was erotic, realistic and more than 30 seconds! almost 6 minutes of some of the least graphic but erotic minutes I have seen in a movie - Jessica and Barabar made each intimate scene seem so real and at some point I wondered how much was scripted and how much was them being in the moment...

SPOILER:  The story doesn't end the way many of us had hoped, but it would have diminished the message of the film to have a happy ever after - Rebecca could not have let herself go if it wasn't for knowing she was working on limited time.  I am rarely surprised by plot twist but this one got me because I was so busy watching and not thinking about wait who's dying I need to figure it out.

Go on Youtube and watch Barbara's & Jessica's interview about the movie - even in the interview Jessica and Barbara have great chemistry.  Jessica Clark did a great job for being one of her first film roles, but this movie belongs to Barbara Niven for the bravery to bare it all (at the age of 58) emotionally and physically.

5422259,5,B00AFDN5Y0,"Finally, a movie showing a middle age woman finding love through a very unlikely source.
Writer/director, Nicole Conn's previous movie 'Elana Undone' has a fantastic subject matter: It is never to late to find your soul mate as well as the longest kiss in movie history.
With 'A Perfect Ending', Ms. Conn has hit this monumental home run out of the park.
'A Perfect Ending' is a movie that is funny, serious and throws a lot at the viewer, including a twisted ending that messed with my head so much, that I had to purchased the movie.
The casting of Veteran actor Barbara Niven as Rebecca and newcomer Jessica Clark as Paris is a wonderful fit.  Their on screen chemistry is so believable, there are times you forget you are watching a movie.  Jessica Clark (in her first featured film), creates Paris with an essence of smoldering sex appeal which is often seen in silence. Jessica's Paris draws you in not only by the obvious; her exotic, young, tall, graceful body; but through her brown eyed hypnotic stare and her deep, sexy, measured voice. When Paris speaks it is INTENSE.  Ms. Clark has scenes in which silence plays a very loud part in Paris's DNA. Yet, Jessica can somehow convey through the camera and to the viewer, what Paris is thinking or doing, so the viewer understands Paris when she is silent, as well as being mesmerized by Ms. Clark's performance.
Barbara Niven is just wonderful as the stereotypical rich, in control, sexual repressed Rebecca.
Ms. Niven's overall courage and trust in her director, leads to reveal all of Rebecca's flaws, including her beautiful body.  Rebecca as the older woman searching for passion in a loveless marriage, needs to feel alive again, and finds it in a stranger's touch. Since Paris and Rebecca are going through their own individual trama, when they come together through their unlikely encounter, they begin to create a bond based on trust, healing and eventually love for one another. Ms. Niven's Rebecca shows a a comic side in her growing relationship with Paris. With  Paris help, you see Rebecca start to blossom into a woman who is becoming more confident and at ease with her sexuality.  In a funny scene, Rebecca tries to initiate sex, by bum rushing Paris as she enters the room and strips her of her coat and blouse.  Paris is taken aback for a second and then decides to relax and enjoy as the teacher being ravished by the student, who was once this very shy and timid woman. The scene is not only funny but extremely hot at the same time.  [I thought it would be funnier if when Paris got jumped on, that she should say to Rebecca, ""No hello?"", ""How you are you?"", ""What's up""]?
In my opinion, great movies grab you and then you can't let go. If you are drawn in by the first scene and by the end of the movie, you are still caring about these characters, so much so, that you want to know what is going on with them during the next day, week, month and year. In 'A Perfect Ending' then you have truly witness a great movie.
'A Perfect Ending' is such a lovely addiction that you will begin to experience withdrawal symptoms after you stop watching a few times.  The movie stays with you!
A Standing Ovation all around to writer/director Nicole Conn, and to the brilliant acting of Barbara Niven and Jessica Clark. BRAVO!
You might as well purchase the movie for your own library. It will surely become a Classic.

5422290,5,B00AFDN5Y0,"I have been waiting a long time to see a lesbian movie that could come close to
challenging Desert Hearts.
I first saw this movie on OUT tv and ordered it along with Elena Undone.
For me, this is a stunningly photographed movie. The directors touch is gentle and
sensitive. It simply carries you along the lives of the characters like the water
in a stream.
SPOILER ! If someone had told me the ending before I actually saw the movie,I
wouldn't have watched it. I am thrilled that no one did !!! I think the title was
brilliant and the ending was perfect.( I got it.)
Again like Elena Undone,this movie has a dialogue that doesn't hit a false note.
The characters are well developed and very believable.
I couldn't believe that an older woman ( Barbara Niven) was going to have the
lead in a lesbian movie !!! Ms. Niven is simply stunning,and best of all,a superb
actress. She simply was Rebecca. ( and oh that orgasm,the best I've seen)
Jessica Clark ( the high priced call girl) gives a smouldering performance. Her anguish leaps off the screen. However,saying the dialogue in a halting manner,
although very sexy, it does not reach the caliber of acting that Ms. Niven exuded.
For those of you who complain that they don't want to see another a movie where a lesbian is murdered,commits suicide,or dies,get a grip. There have been bucket loads
of lesbian movies where no such occurrences have taken place. We are long past the
Killing of Sister George era. Have you heard of Desert Hearts,Bound,Claire Of The Moon,Bar Girls,When Night is Falling,It's in the Water,French Twist,Better Than Chocolate, Elena Undone, etc,etc,etc.
SPOILER !To have a character (whether straight or gay)who is in her 50's die of cancer is
what happens in real life,unfortunately.

highly reccommend this one.",1373846400,3,1867,4.78328173374613

However,it touches on good points,life,death,the change of life,ageism,sexism;simply searching for love and acceptance. Maybe not in the places we set out to find love,even passion. The film stars out very slow,yet capturing you as it dissects the conversations and dealings Paris and Rebecka encounter in everyday life and there past. I read some of the reviews on why they did not find someone other than the older woman. Yet, it was real as you watched the screen her age showed,how she felt about her body along with her unhappiness in her marriage,going along to get along. Well,that is reality in many individuals life after being together or drawn together for convenience. As we age we don't always feel as beautiful especially women. After-all society sets different standards for men and women in aging. Growing old is a reality and not always respected. As Paris pointed out her looks,body was nothing; state of mind. She too will age and beauty will be more about how we except and love each other inside. I think they both crossed paths to help each other in something they needed in life.  I love the erotic love scenes and finally there comfort with each other. Perhaps I was hoping for a different ending.

I gave this 5 stars because of the whole experience, but I do think that, as another reviewer mentioned, the ""art"" shots could have been a bit more condensed. I also felt that, while this was a nice effect, and did mirror the aloofness of the Paris character, it seemed a bit odd when juxtaposed with the more traditional storytelling in Rebecca's scenes. Both styles suited the individual characters, but the transitions seemed a bit rough for my tastes. However, I wholeheartedly recommend this film. Overall, very well done. And kudos to Nicole Conn for the story, and the message. This is the first film of hers that I felt was a good story, well told, without having to slap you across the face with the message, or the feminist theory. (I agree with all the messages she has proffered in her various films, the feminist lens she gives the viewer. I just always felt it was a bit heavy handed. This was so focused on story and character development that the message(s), while clear, seemed to just grow naturally from the strytelling, rather than seeming contrived and forced. My opinion, anyway.)",1370736000,4,1512,4.819230769230769

I really liked the May to September romance and the idea of a woman wanting to find passion in her life after having done without for so long.  I found both those ideas to be really interesting and I wished it had been delved into more.  But I guess there wasn't time because they had to kill her.  Ahem, excuse me, they had her die of cancer.  I'm still feeling pretty annoyed by that.  I also didn't like the choppy editing which is only found earlier in the film (how weird is that?).  I suppose it was done purposely for artistic purposes (?) but I didn't care for it.  This film tries too hard to be visually artistic and it was done at the expense of telling the story imo.  I started fast forwarding through those parts because I found them boring and not adding to the story or my enjoyment.  Use the time to tell the story in more detail, darn it!  Maybe I would have cried at the end instead of simply feeling annoyed and a little cheated.

The ending surprised me and I'm not so easily surprised. And *spoilerish* it actually made me cry ( :-/ ) which I haven't done since watching The Notebook ages ago.

Take it in more than once in order to discover what it will reveal next.  The development and ultimate transformation of the characters is presented in snippets or dots, just like Paris' art work.  The viewer must hold in their memory each scene as the movie progresses in order to see the entire image by the end.  It isn't as difficult to understand as Foucault, but by reading other reviews its apparent everyone doesn't get it.  Spoiler alert: for instance, in flash-back Paris smashes a vase amongst engagement/wedding presents and later on reassembles the shattered vase into a new object.  That's exactly what happens to her character once she opens herself up to Rebbekah.  Her life has been reassembled from its shattered pieces.  Even the use of Faure's pavane, Op. 50, screams out what is happening.  A pavane is a couple's dance.  And Faure conveys haunting beauty better than any one else.

5422433,5,B00AFDN5Y0,"Personally... I feel this movie marks the beginning of an era in many aspects... I've watched hundreds of movies (both gay and straight), series, books - you name it... but never had the opportunity to put my hands into such a brilliant piece of work. Nicole Conn somehow manages to bring to life a deeply emotional, highly erotic film to life that somehow caresses your soul and evokes the most intimate emotions from your very core.

In an time where being gay is either acclaimed or condemned but not necessarily accepted as if it was completely normal, Nicole finds a way to bring her characters on screen as thus what they are doing was the most natural thing in the world (not that I'm saying that it's not, at least not for many)... I've read some reviews where people state they feel this story didn't feel real etc.... to them I need to say in real life, I've seen things WAY crazier and I am not even 30, so the story seemed pretty natural to me. I believe this movie is great for anyone gay or straight, young or old who somehow feel stuck as if there is nothing more to life - opportunities show up when we least expect them to, and if we're not ready to be brave and jump out there and grab them when they show up, then it will be shame we are not living our life by the fullest.

Chemistry between Barbara (Niven) and Jessica (Clark) is so amazing, you won't be able to help feeling mesmerised by their interactions and the energy they expel with every exchange. I've seen this movie 5 times since I got it 6 days ago, and simply can't get tired of it. Every time I see it I find something new. Nicole is so focused in detail that probably makes it impossible to get the whole picture of her work the first time around, so it is recommended you keep on seeing it LOL.

Barbara is perhaps the most gorgeous woman I have ever seen on screen or real life, and she's simply magnificent in portraying the transition of her character throughout the movie where she not only shows how much of a professional and amazing actress she is, but also the fact that there still ARE great roles for women over 40. She will be often heard quoting on camera this was her role of a lifetime, and she might just be right -- not necessarily for her since I'm sure she will find other great roles to portray, but for the rest of us. There is a very thin line between what is erotic and what is pornographic, and somehow they found a way to make this film a piece of art.

I've known Barbara for a while from her previous work but it was not until recently after watching this movie that I started following her on social media, and as was surprised to find a human being so compassionate, full of love and understanding that she almost hypnotises you with every word, and as she keeps saying on an on probably every time she has a keyboard available to write, a mic or a camera in front of her: ""Never settle for less than perfect and don't give up 5 minutes before the miracle!"" -- and I think this overall message is what A Perfect Ending was trying to project, and managed to.

And yes, you've guessed right. If Barbara decides to reconsider and comes out of the closet, I will definitely ask her to marry me LOL.

They recommend that a woman can help her achieve an orgasm and may be much better than what her husband can give her.  At first she is unsure about it but decides, to listen to her friends and makes the call.

When Valentina receives the specifics of who to send to meet with Rebecca, Sylvie (portrayed by Rebecca Staab) who is supposed to meet with Rebecca, has an important engagement and has her friend Paris (portrayed by Jessica Clark) go in her place.

Paris is a talented artist, but something in her past continues to reside within her.  And she dreams of the past with her and her boyfriend, happy moments that make her work a bit difficult to focus on.

When Paris goes to meet Rebecca, Rebecca is unsure she can go through with it and is upset when see's Paris, a beautiful younger woman which she didn't want.  She wanted an experience woman around the same age and upset by what had taken place, Rebecca bolts out of the place.

Meanwhile, we start to learn more about the dysfunctional Westridge family.  And an argument between Rebecca and her husband Mason and see how the two are literally not in love and are just married.  Mason is planning to give his wife a number of stocks in his will and everything to his three sons.  Rebecca's husband does not want to acknowledge Jessica as a daughter and include her in the will.  We learn that Mason had molested his step-daughter Jessica when she was younger and Rebecca feels that Mason owes their daughter something. But Mason refuses.

Tired of the tension within her family, Rebecca decides that she's going to go through with the escort service and once again makes a call, and this time, she gets Sylvie (a woman her age) but once again, Rebecca is not ready and the two get into an argument and Sylvia tells Rebecca that she is uptight and that she should give Paris a try, as Paris can give her what she wants.

And so, after backing out twice, Rebecca decides to give Paris a try.  And while it seems that Rebecca is about to back out of it again for a third time, she decides to go for it and she begins seeing Paris, who is able to give her an orgasm but also introducing her to sexual pleasure that she had never felt before.

But it also instills confidence within Rebecca and wanting to give her daughter happiness.  As for Paris, we get to learn more about her backstory and why she has these memories of her and her boyfriend.

And as Rebecca's sexual life with Paris is at its best and realizing she has a connection with her, Rebecca has a secret that her family and Paris are unaware of.  A secret that will change the lives of Rebecca and the people she is close with, forever.

JUDGMENT CALL:

A heartfelt, beautiful romance drama from filmmaker Nicole Conn.  Featuring a sexy, elegant love scene and captivating, visual pointillism that makes this film standout from other LGBT films out there!

""A Perfect Ending"" is a film about one woman who has not felt sexual pleasure.  A family matriarch of having to take care of the interests of their four children and having a husband who cares about nothing but his business, but a family secret that she and her husband keeps, that torments her each and everyday.

What happens when a wealthy housewife who has never felt true pleasure, meets a young woman who is able to give her just that.  With a newfound confidence and experiencing sexual passion that she has never felt before, all should seem right for the protagonist, Rebecca.  But unfortunately, she keeps a secret that will change the lives of those close to her, forever.

Nicole Conn portrays the characters gently and uses pointillism, with extreme closeups until focused and giving a viewer a chance to see the true details of life that others probably do not see and eventually seeing a bigger picture.

The film has also one of the longest sex scenes between two women that I have ever seen in a commercial film.  There is a gentleness in the way the scenes were shot, believable and romantic, it's definitely a memorable scene from the film, as we see how life changes for Nicole by her new discovery in life, but also knowing that she needs to make things happen with the life that she has.  But made interesting with the twists and turns that take place toward the end of the film.  It' s a wonderful journey for the primary characters of this film and the title ""A Perfect Ending"" fits with the film perfectly.

I felt that casting is important and because we see Barbara Niven, an actress known for her work on soap operas taking on a role, that I never expected to see her in, she did a wonderful job, especially Jessica Clark. Both women were able to make their scenes seem believable but also sexy and elegant.  But Barbara Niven still looks incredible and Jessica Clark is an actress that I hope we see more of in the near future.  And Morgan Fairchild still looks incredible and also John Heard playing the jerk husband, it was great to see both talents in this film.

The DVD features the extended love scene but also six behind-the-scene featurettes with interviews with Barbara Niven, Jessica Clark, Morgan Fairchild and filmmaker Nicole Conn and more.

Overall, ""A Perfect Ending"" is a beautiful, romantic drama from filmmaker Nicole Conn that features a wonderful performance by Barbara Niven and Jessica Clark and one of the sexiest love scenes that I have ever seen in an LGBT film.  Recommended!",1364601600,,8593,4.824333561175666

Definitely ignore the cover of this video which is either out of control photoshopped or just a couple of random women... because the blonde (Barbara Niven) in this film is 60 yrs old.  She's lovely and doesn't really look her actual age, but she's definitely older.  (Watch the trailer.)

This is not a high quality flick. Let's face it, it's a Nicole Conn product (Claire of the Moon, Elena Undone)... I did find it kind of awful, but still her least cheesiest effort thus far-- even if she did sabotage the f@!!*!!g ending!!!  I watched the whole thing without turning it off, so I'll just call it a flawed but guilty pleasure. It also helped that I didn't actual buy it, lol.

I actually liked the uptight, older woman storyline who seeks out a high-end call girl for her first orgasm. Though she requests a woman her own age, the smoldering, late 20s Paris (Jessica Clark) shows up at her door instead. The clear age difference was kinda sexy and sad at the same time. The aging housewife, though wealthy and well-preserved, still looks much older than Paris and feels insecure... her vulnerability is endearing (however badly acted). I did like the aging beauty who never before explored passion theme. I just don't understand how someone this conservative and uptight has close lesbian friends.  And I will say that Barbara Niven in her younger days was a stunning beauty (hotter than Jessica Clark even, as far as my tastes go)... but boy was the filming and lighting harsh on her in this film at times and I'm hoping that was for some alignment with the theme.  However, Niven is a beauty even today and I've seen her looking 10x more beautiful and younger in recent youtube clips.

Sure it was kinda slow and full of implausibilities, the script and acting below average, a few too many hetero imageries and crazy long close ups on pointless objects, and the ending was awful and depressing (why did I rate this 3 stars?! lol)... but these leads were beautiful together and had some enticing chemistry. The hotel scenes were the best part of the movie. And I loved the whole blonde and dark, exotic beauty mix. Hot leads is one credit I gotta hand over to Conn.  But an ending like this drops us right back in time when lesbians aren't allowed to have a happy ending in love... and I kinda resent that. Really. What was the point of THAT?!

And is Jessica Clark hot or what??  And is it not even hotter that she is openly gay in real life?? Love it.

Morgan Fairchild as the Madam with all her crazy little barbies was hilarious... I don't know if that was supposed to be funny, but I laughed out loud at all those barbie scenes, lol.",1364428800,3,2655,4.540880503144654

5422453,5,B00AFDN5Y0,"I may have already reviewed this film, but because I became so entranced, so obsessed with it after renting it for three days, I had to own it. Now that I do, I have watched it again and again, still standing with what I wrote in my earlier review. There is, however, so much to this movie, it's difficult to do A Perfect Ending justice in only a few words.

1) Writer/Director Nicole Conn is a genius film maker.

2) Jessica Clark is a stunning newcomer to acting and a perfect foil for her co-star.

3) And then there's the incomparable Barbara Niven who boldly went where she'd never gone before. It's hard to say enough about her without sounding like I'm dishing out hype. But this gorgeous actress shines like a flame drawing us, like moths, to bask in her brightness, her warmth and her searingly memorable portrayal of a woman accustomed to maintaining control, who steps so far from her comfort zone that she finds herself in uncharted territory. (Much like Barbara, herself.)

And thrives. Ecstatically.

Imagine never having known passion in your life. Imagine never feeling you were good enough, pretty enough, thin enough, smart enough, ""fill-in-the-blank-yourself"" enough. These barely scratch the surface of the vulnerabilities women share that Nicole Conn addresses in her ground-breaking film.

You owe it to yourself to see this movie. Watch for the phenomenal detail Nicole uses, almost subliminally, with the flashes of imagery that guide you into what's to come in her scene transitions.

And don't, as some reviewers before me, view this film through a shallow, monochromatic lens. The ending COULD be depressing in the hands of a less deft writer/director than Nicole Conn. Instead, you'll be uplifted, inspired and never quite the same again. She created a truly perfect ending. May you have the eyes and heart to recognize it, to really ""get"" it. Most of all, enjoy this film that every woman should see.",1364083200,3,1929,4.898773006134969
5422454,5,B00AFDN5Y0,"A Perfect Ending is one of the few lesbian films that warrants watching it to the very end. It ranks up there with 'Loving Annabelle, Elena Undone, I Can't Think Straight, and Better than Chocolate.'

5422455,5,B00AFDN5Y0,This is a great movie. The girl who plays the call girl is unbelievably hot! It has a great story line and great actors.,1363910400,,120,4.041666666666667

I thought about it for days, which is always a good sign.  I believed in the characters and their journey.  It is a very touching, sweet film. I loved it.",1363737600,,464,4.542168674698795
5422457,5,B00AFDN5Y0,"Firstly, this is, in the strictest definition, an art film. If you want action, a bunch of T&A, just another chick flick, or a simple linear love story, then this probably is not a film for you.

Secondly, ""A Perfect Ending"" provides an entire range of potent emotion, from the poignant to the erotic. If you're ready to be transported emotionally, this IS a film you can't afford to miss. Guys will probably not get this, though.

Thirdly, it is not, IMHO, just another ""lesbian film."" To label it as such and nothing more is to do an injustice not only to writer/director Nicole Conn and the stellar cast and all those involved in the project, but to all those women ""out there"" who NEED to see the film, because it is, in so many ways, EVERY woman's story on some level.

If you are stuck in a situation, a relationship, a job, a state of mind--any of these things or countless others that tie you up and confine you--then you, too, are on a similar journey as Rebecca must travel. If you are facing your own mortality and have any regrets, this is your story, too. If you feel powerless, then come watch how Rebecca finds her own power. If your whole life you never felt thin enough, smart enough, pretty enough, rich enough, good enough, then you will identify with Rebecca (and surprisingly, the beautiful Barbara Niven who plays her). If you've been wounded, are feeling vulnerable, come see how Paris and Rebecca heal one another's wounds.

AND If you have never had an orgasm, you'll know exactly how Rebecca feels, and you will soar with her when she finally achieves release in the single most erotic love scene I have ever experienced. Nicole Conn holds nothing back, and yet it is not even close to pornographic because it's not about the actual sex (although that is incredibly-well-depicted and tastefully handled!), but rather, it is about how we as women respond to making love--on a profound emotional level. Rebecca's reaction, as portrayed by the incomparable Barbara Niven, will absolutely take your breath away. This is not of the ""When Harry Met Sally"" lusty ""Yes. Yes. Yes."" ilk. YOU MUST SEE IT to absorb the impact. You will be aroused and satisfied with this utterly mesmerizing sequence.

Finally, there are multiple themes running through the storyline. It is a complex tale with interleaving elements (over-simplified definition borrowed from computer science = alternating layers/non-contiguous) that Nicole Conn has brought together. She connected the dots beautifully. Think impressionist paintings, dots of color seemingly disconnected. Up close they don't make much sense. But step back and the spaces between the dots disappear and the image emerges before your eyes, as if by magic. Paris even explains her pointillist (post-Impressionist) artwork to Rebecca. A point here, a point there and there and way off to the side, a bigger point, then a darker point--these all have very little meaning in themselves, but when seen in relation to the whole, clarity comes.

This is a profound truth. All the seemingly disparate pieces of our lives actually do make sense with the perspective of distance. And time. But as the white box that Nicole Conn uses with such effectiveness showed, enough distance and we ourselves become a dot in a greater picture.

It's also a story about taking risks, emotionally, physically. And for me, the over-riding theme is that of metamorphosis. Paris begins the film as a high-class call girl. Rebecca gives her the courage to live her passion. Depending on your age you will likely identify with one character more than the other. Former model and up-and-coming actress Jessica Clark is the Yin to her co-star's Yang. If you are of a certain age, you will be entranced by Barbara Niven's artistry as she makes this metamorphosis happen for the character she brings to life. You will love and identify with Rebecca. But you will probably fall in love with Barbara Niven, if you haven't already. You've been warned. :)

So watch this art film for its imagery viewed in flashes. There IS meaning in them and you will understand it after absorbing the whole of the story. From the patina on the bronze statues at the opening, foreshadowing the ending, to the bright flashes of color and texture as Rebecca is about to emerge from her cocoon, all these ""dots,"" these pieces, combine with the ""stuff"" happening with Rebecca's family. And when the film is over and the credits roll, the images will start to make sense (once you start breathing again). And you'll want to watch it again and again until you've connected all the dots yourself.

The ending is poignant, uplifting, satisfying and perfect. You'll have to see it to understand. It is unequivocally NOT, as some reviewers have said, depressing. It is filled with hope, with possibility and redemption. It's only depressing when viewed through a shallow, simplistic, monochromatic lens.

I wept off and on for the rest of the day after watching it through once, re-watching it, then fast-forwarding to the main love scene and the subsequent, although no less revealing, intimate scenes.

A Perfect Ending was a genuine privilege to experience, and I am forever changed by it.

Run, don't walk, to see it, own it, devour it.

For the answer to what the heck Morgan Fairchild's character is doing with all the Barbie Dolls, take note of how the doll she's working on is attired when Paris wants to quit. Nicole Conn knows how to use detail to perfection.",1363737600,110,5493,4.849519743863394
5422458,4,B00AFDN5Y0,"Spoiler alert..as if there could be such a thing.***

I have often wondered why the best stories, the ones with true grit seem to give up in the end. The Perfect Ending is not so much about a Fairy Tale perfect ending as it is that all is right with the world in the end. Formulaic to romantic drama...they never end up together...this is not a romantic comedy. So why is it a perfect ending? When you can leave this life the way you want to leave it, in the hands of those you love and advocate for... that is perfect. I just regret the sacrifice always being present. I wanted to see the perfect ending...Paris and Rebecca together. But that is not where the writers have taken us, so we must find perfection elsewhere.

I loved the characters in this film even though they could have had more definition. Is it important to understand why Paris chooses a life of a call girl especially when she is as talented as she is? Guilt and derailed happiness brings her to that decision? Hmmm? Rebecca is unfulfilled and duty bound. You feel her angst and her frustration and her longing. Safely, I can say that I have seen just about every movie related to lesbians and their struggles. Elena Undone,for example, was great in that we had this passion that was captured quite nicely but I have never cried watching someone understand, for the first time, what it feels like to finally ""feel""...I did for Rebecca and again for Paris. Very moving.

Did we need some of the sub themes attempted? Maybe not. We could have had the same issue with Rebecca's daughter not being her husband's child and addressed the conflicts without the whole rape thing. Not sure why it was important.  We already hate the husband because he is void of compassion for his wife. Could have redirected that to more definition of Paris and the choice.

I have seen many movies that have stretched a thin story into 90+ minutes and this one had so much crammed together that we want to know more and are left sad never knowing. Paris is an interesting character...let's see the prequal... The Art of Paris.

All in all I enjoyed this film.  I have endured others that have taken me nowhere but to regret, this one was a story I could connect with and care about.

5422470,5,B00AFDN5Y0,"I found this film to be the most honest, sincere and tender film I have 'ever' seen in my life, and that's really saying something, considering the amount of films that I have seen, and even more importantly the genres of films that I tend to watch which include world cinema and a host of many talented directors, actors and intelligent scripts.
There are some that might be inclined to criticise this film unjustly / unfairly but then perhaps they themselves have never found their lives spinning out of control or in a quagmire of yearning.
This film is not about shocking or titillating the audience but rather opening the eyes of the viewer to the tender love that can be shared honestly between two women and indeed two human beings.
In a world that is intrinsically convoluted and boasts a delightful mixture of sweet cultures and customs, I found myself blissfully entranced by Nicole's film and the divine characters of Paris and Rebecca that could in all honesty be my next door neighbours.
Nicole's film is nothing more than genius, beautiful, inspiring, healing, educational, tender and full of hope. Jessica and Barbara portrayed their roles with effortless expertise and one could be forgiven for falling in love with either lady.
Nicole I most earnestly thank you and couldn't recommend this film enough, indeed I hope the whole world sees A Perfect Ending and comes away from it a little bit lighter, irrespective of their tastes in love and partnerships, and in so doing find renewed faith in life and the possibilities that love truly holds when embraced fearlessly.",1363564800,5,1584,4.892193308550186

5422495,3,B00AFDN5Y0,"When I say ""bittersweet"", I mean about my feelings toward the movie, and not the story. I don't even know where to start to critique this movie. I'll have to say that the only two best things about this movie are the hotel room scenes, and Barbara Niven. I don't think Jessica Clark stood out in particular; I think anyone else can do her role and act seductive and self-assured. She had *some* chemistry with Barbara Niven, but the latter was exquisite in the movie, and yes--I'm talking about the acting. The sex scenes were good...

The story in itself I feel like left so many unanswered questions. I'm not going to go through every single one of them lest I run out of room. I think we could do away with the depressed-Paris scenes and the million useless close-ups of inanimate objects, which would have left the movie so much room to talk about more. We don't even really know why Paris is in this profession--she gives Rebecca an excuse, but it felt like she was convincing herself of it, too. Did Rebecca *really* love Paris, or was she just caught up in the passion and lust? Is Paris flirting with the daughter in the end? So confusing. And all so useless!

I would say just make a two-hour movie of Rebecca and Paris in hotel rooms, but I don't want to sound like a pig. I just think this movie could've been so much more, and they already had two good actresses at their disposal. I would blame the director and scriptwriter (the same person? ha!), and maybe throw in the musical scorer.

All in all, I love the movie only because of the love scenes and Barbara Niven. Just felt they could've done more.",1362700800,,1616,4.434343434343434

5422523,5,B00AFDN5Y0,"This film is an honest portrayal of the anxiety of aging, the fallout of grief, and the frustration of the conflict between the patriarchal system and the modern view of gender equality. Throw in some sexual repression and exploitation, and you have a three-ring circus of emotions. Rebecca, a very conventional ""trophy"" wife, Jessica...a privileged daughter, two spoiled sons....and a 3rd generation trust-fund baby as the head of the household....and things can get get dicey! Add a scheme to allow Rebecca to experience her first ever orgasm, by way of a female ""hooker""....well, here we go! Sounds very sordid, but in fact, it is all presented with such beauty and class that one hardly thinks about the details.
 To me, the most fascinating aspect would be a sequel with the April character mentoring the daughter, Jessica in life-fulfilling lessons. I do not know where this might lead, but I know from what I have seen (so far) that this would be a most interesting journey.",1362096000,2,981,4.945454545454545

If this story could be edited by leaving only the scenes at the hotel, it would have been a good short movie. The rest is quite a crap

PROS:
- the excellent actressess
- the story of rebecca. The middle age woman of the surbs that discovers sex and sexuality at a late stage of here life
- the scenes at the hotel: the process of seducing rebecca. Very well written and filmed
- the point of view of the hookers

CONS:
- so much drama that is hardly credible
- another tragic ending
- the story of Paris. We don't get to know her. Se is hardly introduced, except for the tragic accident, we know nothing else about her.
- so many, useless and pointless close shots that prove that the director pretends to be someone she's not
- so many useless flashbacks
- so many useless shoots of a depressed Paris
- constant presence of the music. Too cheesy",1362096000,13,911,4.2601156069364166
5422525,4,B00AFDN5Y0,"I am glad to say that Wolf Movies are back.  A Perfect Ending was very good.  A little more artsy than my other favorite, Elena Undone, but a very good story indeed.  Without being a spoiler, this movie had twists and turns and things weren't all they appeared to be.  It is a tale of an older woman discovering herself all over again, and a call girl with a heart of gold.  Sure it's a fairy tale, but a good story is a good story.

Barbara Niven is to be commended for the total exposure she gave to the viewer.  It isn't easy to look at yourself in the mirror, noticing all the wrinkles and changes that accompanies age, but to show the world takes a very brave, self-assured woman.  She has nothing to worry about, she is still beautiful, regardless of her age.  Jessica Clark is stunning.  I watched True Blood and had no idea she played Lilith.  The again, in True Blood, she was naked and covered in blood everytime she was on the screen.  I prefer seeing her this way, as Paris.  Flawless in appearance and a voice you could listen to forever...lucky Rebecca/Barbara!  The film had a lot of close-ups, flashbacks and pieces of the puzzle the viewer tried to put together during the film.  At the end, all was revealed, and to be honest, I wished for a different conclusion.  This was a great film by Nicole Conn and I look forward to seeing more of her work.",1362096000,,1366,4.339920948616601

5422527,2,B00AFDN5Y0,"I eagerly anticpiated the arrival of this movie and was sorely disapointed. I watched it 2x to make sure I was reviewing the same movie that got all the rave reviews. My guess is that friends/investors have inflated the reviews.

The good:
* The actors-leads and supporting cast did the best that they could with what they had

The Bad:
* Annoying music that droned on
* The in-and-out of focus shots
* Tries to too hard to be artsy, and fails miserably
* The slow pace of the movie
* Lack of character development
* An IMPERFECT ending

This could have been so much better and I really expected more, and so should you.

5422551,1,B00AFDN5Y0,"I am completely stumped by all the raving reviews for this movie.  The only thing I can figure is that 1) people associated with the movie are reviewing it to bolster its sales or 2) viewers will tolerate garbage if it means that they get to see breasts.

I'll try to be brief: this movie is hacked to pieces. Editing, both content and sound, is done well when you don't even notice it. Sadly, this is not the case in this film. There's so much extraneous information in the plot that it's obvious that this movie was, at one time, about 3 times as long and whoever edited it did so with a hatchet rather than with a scalpel. And then, perhaps as an attempt to cover the nonsense, they inserted about 4 million ""artsy"" shots of close-ups of random objects that had absolutely nothing to do with the plot.

The characters weren't developed, and the story dragged. Until suddenly... it was over. I honestly don't know what was worse in this movie... the acting, the directing, the sound, the plot, the script... it's all so awful.

I feel bad offering such a negative review because so few stories like this are told in film. But I think those of us to whom this type of story speaks deserve better. We deserve so much better.",1361750400,15,1224,4.426666666666667

5422557,5,B00AFDN5Y0,"Alright, to be fair, my review might be a tad bias.  I am a huge fan of Nicole Conn and absolutely loved ""Elena Undone"" and ""Claire of the Moon""; this woman can do no wrong in my eyes.  She has done so much for the LGBT community and I admire her greatly.  As a lesbian who has viewed numerous LGBT movies, I generally find myself saddened and depressed with the lack of 'decent' lesbian movies out there.  I can only name a handful that I deem acceptable and could watch over and over again.  This movie just happens to be one of them.  I went into this movie fully understanding that I could be disappointed at the end, but I remained optimistic in hopes that Mrs. Conn would pull through and give a finished product worthy of applause.  This movie had so many things going for it; beautiful actors (with great chemistry), great acting, decent story line, beautiful cinematography, and so many issues that women (and men, too) struggle with on a day to day basis.  This may sound extremely cheesy, but I came away from this movie with a new perspective on life - it is never too late.  Live your life to the fullest and do what you want to do as soon as you can do it.  I will not give away the ending, but I will say this.  A true perfect ending is all in one's perspective and I for one, saw this as 'a perfect ending'.

Would I recommend this movie?  Of course I would!  If you go into it with an open mind, you will not be disappointed.  Just remember, a perfect ending is all in one's perspective.",1361404800,3,1504,4.246478873239437

It has all the tropes of a good love story intertwined with gorgeous shots and edits, taking this film to new heights. As a writer and future filmmaker, seeing this film only inspires me. The score was well done and appropriate. The acting, for me, was authentic and awe-inspiring. Barbara Niven and Jessica Clark did an amazing job portraying believable characters that individually and collectively overcome arcs.'A Perfect Ending' was well written, well shot and well acted. Overall, I HIGHLY recommend this film for anyone looking not only for a top ten Lesbian film, but for a good love story, period. Well worth watching and finding out for yourself :)",1361318400,2,780,4.961832061068702
5422569,1,B00AFDN5Y0,Great sex and wonderful acting but are lesbians not allowed to have a happy ending. Cant stand to watch another love story that ends in tragedy. Glad I didn't spend the money to buy the DVD. Im really disappointed with Nicole Conn.,1361145600,11,231,4.523809523809524
5422570,3,B00AFDN5Y0,"I was glad I rented this. I was sad about the ending and it was really, really artsy. The artistic scenes were vague and left up for interpretation (as art is, I suppose), but something about the call girl's dramatic art scenes left me feeling bored, and then as though I was missing something. They were also very, very lengthy. And boring to watch. If you appreciate artistic expression, you'll probably really love this film. If you're not as appreciative, you may find yourself wanting to fast forward but refraining from doing so because you think the obscure scene is going to lead to something. Well, it doesn't. They don't. They're very unresolved.

The movie is good, though. Really. I actually enjoyed it. Not on the same level as ""Imagine Me & You"" or ""Elena Undone""... but I enjoyed it about the same amount as I enjoyed ""Saving Face"" or episodes of ""The L Word"" where Jenny was featured more prominently.

Oh, and the filming was well done. The only complaint I had was How. Incredibly. Slow. The. Call. Girl. Spoke. I get that she was exuding confidence and control, but it was too much. Really.

All in all, I'll probably watch it again someday. And fast-forward through the vague art scenes. Yeah.",1361145600,2,1213,4.685446009389671

Wish I had my $55. back. The story line was OK, as an idea, but the lack of dialog and character development made the movie long and boring. You were never given a chance to get to know the characters, you didn't care about any of them. They had good actors in it but they did almost not acting. There are a bunch of ""F"" bombs that seem very much out of place. We hated the rape scene, and the lack of details that went along with it. There was no follow through, about a million things left unfinished. You get no answers to the questions that are raised. The movie is made up of a lot of artistic shots, and no substance. It's way too long, my wife kept falling asleep. I could be very detailed about all of this but because you have not seen it yet, I hesitate to do that. Just trust me if you are looking for a good movie and hoping this one is as good as Elena Undone, you will be VERY disappointed. Save your money please. I love Nicole and Marina but not their best efforts, and I have to be honest.",1361145600,21,1166,3.9871794871794872
5422573,5,B00AFDN5Y0,"""A Perfect Ending"" is absolutely a film that I love. It's a marvelous work that draws you in; simply keeps you watching till the end. The great chemistry of Paris and Rebecca, played by gorgeous Jessica Clark and fantastic Barbara Niven, is beyond description (go for it, you'll definitely feel the same way!)

It's really touching and compelling, to see how both the beautifully-portrayed characters by NICOLE CONN (director) romantically explore ""what they really want"" and who they are. Their journey of discovering the meaning of ""love"", I'm confidently sure you'll fall for the amazing film ;P Absolutely another romantic masterpiece after ""Elena Undone"" and I'm looking forward to more spectacular works from Soul Kiss Film!

It IS A Perfect Ending! ;)

It is uniquely put together - be open to appreciating something different.  This movie touches on quite a few extraordinarily important, potent and pervasive topics around for people who have the habit of settling for things in their life - or judge themselves too too harshly...(many of us I believe).  I do not want to give ANY of it away - just know this - one of the intimate scenes - left me with tears...  not sadness.  I was a bit taken - and certainly taken by surprise.

A stunningly beautiful young woman walks across a fancy hotel. The mature woman emotionally upset eats alone. The young woman plays a male's fantasy and gets paid. Across with other detail shots that will give us the course of the story, the title is revealed in a work of art.
It's 5 minutes of film and we all think we know what the movie is about. These two women will definitely get together and have ""A Perfect Ending"", but how will that happen? As the plot unfolds we discover that there were some unexpected twists to be revealed while we find out how this encounter is going to change their lives.
I could go on and on telling with details how the plot unfolds, but I won't be a spoilsport. Especially because the movie is a pleasure for the senses. You cannot just hear about it, you must see it, feel it, smell it, taste it, dive deep into it. I did and I fell completely in love with it. So I'll give you 9 out of 10 reasons to also go on this journey.

Reason #1/10: Paris
Paris has this kind of goddess quality. Not only is she a passionate person, but passion itself. As she presents herself in such a charming and seductive way, we know for sure that absolutely no one would resist. Not even the uptight housewife. She is so perfect, that we keep thinking ""can this woman be for real?"" Absolutely not. As irresistible as this Aphrodite may be, she truly captivates Rebecca's heart (and ours) when she slowly removes her self-defenses and surrenders to Rebecca's love. We get to know her true self through the white-room sequences and the flashbacks, as if we were her confidents. So we all anxiously expect the transformation and look forward to see the escort Paris becomes the loveable Paris. Jessica Clark couldn't be more perfect for the part. Look for her magazine photographs and you'll see the goddess. Look for her interviews and making off videos and you'll see the lovely down to earth girl.

Reason #2/10: Rebecca
Rebecca, on the other hand, immediately gains our affection. She is that vulnerable, sweet, friendly, respectful person that everyone would move mountains just to see her happy. Any rude behavior from her is forgiven and only makes us more empathic to her feelings and fears. We go through her struggle to overcome her self-image and accept this unorthodox solution. By the time she surrenders, we all can feel the butterflies in her stomach. The transformation that she goes through is so brilliant performed by Barbara Niven. It's hard to put a character to change so much without becoming implausible. But we do believe that she has fallen in love and that everything else in her life has become secondary.

Reason #3/10: Making love scenes
The sex scenes in this movie are so incredibly beautiful, romantic, real and also sexy, passionate and hot. From the first to the last, we see the characters change themselves so clearly by the way they connect as if each movement had been designed to mean much more than the search for pleasure. We can see the tenderness, sweetness and generosity of Paris as the goddess mask reveals her own vulnerability. In every gesture of Rebecca we can see her transformation as she opens herself up, exposing every fear, flaws and feelings. We see she moving herself from the passive position of a ""paying customer who wants to get what she wants"" to the passionate, very much in love woman who is not afraid to express everything she is feeling.

Reason #4/10: intimacy shared
Apart from the sex scenes, there are a few scenes so beautifully shot, that we feel ourselves as intruders accompanying from a privileged spot the relationship development between the two. A word, a look, a small gesture and we can see that they are so head over heels in love, that's impossible to deny. The intimate conversation scenes between the two are delightful and shows an even harder kind of intimacy. And they do it gracefully as soul mates united by screen.

Reason #5/10: Barbara Niven
If you just take a look in some previous work by Barbara Niven or even just a few interviews or her tweets and Facebook comments, you will be already pretty much interested in getting to know her better. She is the kind of person who makes you fall in love with at first sight. Very talented, friendly, beautiful and honest, she has exposed herself in a wonderfully brave way. She has literally denuded her body and soul to play this part. And we found ourselves very privileged to be sharing this moment with her.

Reason #6/10: Jessica Clark
She is a beautiful, tall, sexy, perfect, charming brunet with a seductive voice who could break your heart. Instead, she smiles at you with tender eyes and tells you that she will do whatever you want or need and you just melt away. It's hard to believe that Nicole hadn't met Jessica before writing this part. Could this perfection be easily imagined? She has the perfect body, the perfect skin, the perfect mouth, the perfect eyes. She is the perfect person to teach you about perfection. She plays three different parts with majesty. A scared young woman hidden in the skin of a high priced escort afraid to let herself love again. A deeply hurt woman in sorrow trying to deal with her own inside demons. A playful girl in love enjoying every second of her recent marriage. And they all live somehow in the unfolded Paris, that gently gives herself in.

Reason #7/10: The plot
Formed by many layers and connected subplots, the plot is very well constructed based in each character's fears and desires. Each encounter will define who the characters are and who they will become. And that's what conducts the story. The journey of transformation taken by Rebecca will affect everyone who is around her as well. Her lover Paris, her friends, her daughter, her boys and husband, all will be transformed somehow. And if we allow ourselves, we'll be too.

Reason #8/10: The supporting roles
Rebecca's friends and family, as well as Paris boss and work colleagues make the entertaining breath of the movie. The lesbian couple Shirin and Kelly give us some hilarious moments, like the one in the bar (great special appearance of Cathy DeBuono). Valentina's obsession with the Barbie dolls is another high point on the script. I also enjoyed very much the interaction between Rebecca's family. John Heard is a very talented actor and is great playing her husband. Her daughter and sons act as if they are so close and intimate as brothers and sisters would be.

Reason #9/10: The Soulkiss Nicole Conn and Marina Rice Bader
This real life couple has also given us the delightful Elena Undone some years ago and we couldn't expect less. The Soulkiss films literally put their soul in the pictures and it connects directly with our own souls. I may keep here finding ""reasons"" to convince you to watch this movie, when it's clear that it is not a rational choice. Nicole Conn makes movies to be felt not rationalized. Give the movie a chance and your body will feel the emotions, feelings and sensations that only your mind may unsuccessfully try to dodge.

Reason #1/10: Lesbian movie
I believe that every single movie ever made deals with humans' passions, emotions, feelings, desires, qualities and flaws. And every single person in the world can connect with that. How the person will react to the connection differs according to the point of self-awareness that he/she may be. Some mirrors are avoided. Some reflections are not welcomed. So, I think that when an artist (as I consider a filmmaker) express whatever he/she wants, he/she wants to connect, to communicate with as many people as they can. The restriction of a genre, a label, has to do with the commercial part of the deal. The distributor transforms the film into a product and the viewer into a customer. They want to make the customer happy so they can come back for more. So, they must give them exactly what they want. By ""lesbian movie"" they satisfy the lesbian public. That's safe. I'm not a lesbian, but I have no problem saying that I love most of the lesbian movies that I've seen. But what about my friends? How many of them would watch an ""indie movie""? All the ones who consider themselves cult, cool, non-traditional, open-minded people. How many of them would watch a ""lesbian movie""? Unfortunately not all listed above. Not being open to watch a lesbian movie is the only reason I can think of to not watch this one.",1360886400,56,8519,4.707578806170355
5422577,5,B00AFDN5Y0,The characters had a depth that is unusual in this genre.  The women playing the lead roles were excellent actors.  Highly recommend this film.,1360800000,8,143,4.916666666666667
5422578,4,B00AFDN5Y0,"If you want to stop watching after the first half hour, don't. It gets better. Jessica Clark and Barbara Niven are on fire, and they are perfectly cast. The movie is good, not great, but worth 4 stars for the two lead actresses.",1360713600,2,228,4.325581395348837

5422590,2,B00AFDN5Y0,"I downloaded this movie because I am a fan of Nicole Conn's past work, especially Claire of the Moon & Elena Undone. I was hoping that this movie would be at least as compelling as Elena, but I was soon very disappointed. Nicole has always included haunting melodies in her movies, but this time she over did it. Also, why couldn't she just make a movie without all of the introspection/retrospection psycho-babble flashbacks. Ok so they were supposed to explan why such a beautiful woman like Paris would become an escort and service male clients. Once the main character finally decides to commit to the arrangement, the sex scene is well played, and in true Nicole Conn style. I usually rent before I consider buying (a lesson learned the hard way), so I'm just out $3.99 because this one is NOT a keeper. Elena Undone is much, much, much better even if they both feauture some of the same actors. I hope Nicole gets away from the artsy crapola, and back towards depicting a compelling story about women.",1360627200,3,1007,4.662921348314606

eleven times so far. (The feeling this movie gave me....I still have today. I have not been able to shake it loose.)  It touched the essence of my soul.  To say that I love this movie is an under statement.

Barbara and Jessica's performances are flawless. All ""chemistry"" between them.....
I have no words to truly express how I felt/feel.  All kinds of emotions were stirred up in ""my being"".

The chemistry between Niven and Clark is ""electric"" and sensually smoldering. You can feel the emotional bond between these two women as their relationship progresses. This movie is not only a ""must see streamed"" (watched it twice so far) but a ""must have"" for your collection! Can't wait till it arrives! I related to both women: Niven, because of our age, and Clark because I am also an amateur artist; not to mention, a hopeless romantic. Not only 2 THUMBS UP, but ALL my fingers and toes as well!

It started out slow and we thought another dull coming out of the closet lesbian film when it got very hot halfway through the movie until the end. We were three lesbian couples watching this movie and most were talking making comments until the first love scene and then no one spoke except an ""oh my"".

I loved the twist at the end when I found out who the doctor had been speaking to the whole time. It wasn't who I thought it was! Both main actresses are jewels in this film. Barbara Nevin is a real find. The older she gets, the more attractive she becomes. Jessica Clark is too gorgeous to be real! I hope she makes more films. The production is top notch! Great camera work and editing. Great companion piece to 'Elena Undone' (another great film from soulkiss films.) I do wish, however, that a little more had been done to develop the story itself to make it more universal and less of a 'niche' film. The soundtrack was also a bit too heavy-handed.

I hated the way the movie was filmed; the camera is constantly zooming in/out on objects and artwork comes to life. Another thing I did not like was the voice of the character Paris; it sounds so unnatural and way too sexy. This film reminded me of a soft porn.

And left in the hands of lesser actresses, this film could have been a disaster (see Claire of the Moon). The story concept is a little bizzare, but thanks to a subtle and deft performance by Barbara Niven the film is not only saved it is actually quite good. Jessica Clark isn't bad either, although the speed at which she speaks did get a little tiresome.

5422618,5,B00AFDN5Y0,"Her question was ""What would happen if a woman had never had an orgasm by the time she was 50?""  Veteran filmmaker Nicole dropped everything to consider that situation and ""A Perfect Ending"" gave us the answer.  High-class call girl (played by the gorgeous Jessica Clark) is recruited to help a high-strung older society woman (sexy Barbara Niven) discover just what she's never known before she loses her chance.  This is another treasure from Ms Conn who brought us 1992's ""Claire of the Moon"" and 2010's ""Elena Undone,"" and we are eternally grateful that she shares these gems with us.  She truly loves to show the lesbian community its true light:  We share the same joys, and shoulder the same burdens, as our straight friends, and many more factors connect us than divide us.  As with all Soul Kiss films, you will get your money's worth in palpable heat on the screen but the secondary plot concerns family situations many of us have endured (myself included).  Yes, the story could have avoided the lesbian angle by having a male going to a female prostitute and the same basic truths would have been revealed, but we would have missed out on some really powerful performances by the leads and all the supporting players.  And if you want a real bonus, check out the featurettes.  Nicole always makes me feel like I'm taking a film appreciation class when I watch them.
I would recommend this film to anyone who wonders if there's anything more out there for them, and certainly to my fellow tribe members for obvious reasons (I mean, the two leads AND Morgan Fairchild?  Hot hot hot)!

It does get annoying watching close-up after close-up of random things going in and out of focus, but the storyline was good. I think, like with most lesbian movies there's plenty of room for improvement in the character development. Dear film makers, less mysteriousness, more story.

5422661,5,B00AFDN5Y0,"It was quite enjoyable, although far fetched, but it didn't really matter.  The sensual and sexy nature of Paris was what I gravitated to.  The sex scenes were beautifully done and the dreamlike, abstract nature of Paris' demons were thought provoking.  One needs to watch it more than once to better understand the symbolism involved.  Jessica Clark has a surreal voice which captivated me to no end.  I've watched it several times, each time enjoying it more.  I saw a comment about it being too ""artsy"" which at first I agreed with, but then watching it again I appreciated it.  Maybe my being an ""older"" woman made me see it from a different perspective.  I now would entertain the thought of being involved with a much younger woman.

Maybe I'm jaded but I think cutting about 10-15 minutes out, including a few of the no I can't, yes I want to, no I can't, yes I want to sceens would have served the overall movie well. I did like that our straight protagonist struggled with the decision to hire a woman for sex, but they seemed to be trying to force the point for comic effect. The thing I liked best about the movie is that the dialogue did not insult my intelligence. I found the movie to be a funny, romantic and touching story with hot sex sceens.

5422685,5,B00AFDN5Y0,"Given writer/director Nicole Conn's previous endeavor with Elena Undone, many will expect this film to have the same ""happy ever after"" ending. However, as the title states, on many levels, it truly is a perfect ending. One reviewer stated there were ""red herrings"" or parts that made absolutely no sense. This film does have far more symbolism than Conn's previous works and each part that seems ""out of place"" actually adds great depth and explanation to the characters. Date night film? Honestly, it's a toss up. There is sexual tension then beautiful (tasteful) love scenes. At the same time, while trying not to spoil the movie but assist your decision to make it a date night or not, let me stress, the ending is fitting, though not typical for Conn. Also, those ""red herring"" moments another reviewer pointed out add depth but may not be joyous happenings that have brought either woman to where she presently is. That said, the acting is spot-on, the flow of the film does work if you go with it, and finally, Conn has definitely set a higher standard for LGBT films in general, and Ending absolutely hits the mark.

5422686,5,B00AFDN5Y0,"Pointillism as art, as cinema, as life. That is A Perfect Ending. Pay attention. Be aware. Live fully. Live deeply. Give of yourself and you will be given in return. This film encompasses so much, it's hard to know where to begin. Such complexities, yet stated so simply, so purely... The pain, the loss, the mistakes, the lies, the avoidance, the confessions, the releases, the awakenings, the discoveries, the passions, the beauty, the love... I can't say I've lived a life that remotely translates to any of these characters' stories... yet there is so very much, under the surface, which I can relate to and connect with on some level. I was surprised how much, when I sat down to think about it. But most telling is how the film makes me feel. Whether you can relate or not, Nicole Conn's direction, and Barbara Niven and Jessica Clark's performances makes you FEEL. That is the highest praise I know to bestow on a film. The internal lives of these two characters are exquisitely expressed in a way that might surprise some people, but for me made perfect sense in my seemingly scattered brain. Random pieces that when put together make a whole. That is us. Individual persons brought together. That is life. Random moments ultimately connected. Pay attention. Be aware. Life is short. Live it...fully, deeply, completely...without reservation or fear. And above all, love. Love with your whole being. This film was made with such passionate love. You see it in every frame. One of the most moving moments of the entire film for me was watching the end credits. All the beautiful, hard working, loving people who made this film, shared with the audience, not just by name, but by their glowing faces. It's beautiful. That's art. That's love. That's life.

5422700,5,B00AFDN5Y0,"This movie is amazing. It's beautifully created and will touch you deep within. The chemistry between Barbara Nivens (Rebecca) and Jessica Clark (Paris) is off the charts. You could feel the intensity of the bond between these two women come in waves off the screen.

Nicole Conn has put together another amazing story with another amazing cast. She has a magical way of paring up the right people for her films and the stories are so well written that you will be talking about them for years after watching them. This is definitely another one of those films. This is destined to be a lesbian classic like Claire of the Moon and Elena Undone before it.

The supporting characters played an intricate part of helping make this film so believable and real. I am just in awe of Nicole's ability to create these stories and find the people who will make you feel like you are sitting in the scenes with them, living this experience.

Jessica Clark's beauty radiates from inside and you can see it and feel it all through the movie. And Barbara Niven, wow, she has shown that older women can be beautiful and sensual in a way that I don't think has been portrayed in any movie before this.

And Rebecca's story has been lived by so many of us. We get married, have children and go about our lives in a haze only to wake up one day and find that we've never really lived, we've never really felt real passion about anything or for anyone. I hope this movie wakes up a lot of people so they snap out of their haze and start really living.

There is definite chemistry between the 2 leading ladies and the sex scenes were well executed and believable.  I found the dialogue between the 2 lovers to be a bit sparse, but in art as well as life - sometimes less is more.  Barbara Niven is well suited to the role of a sexually frustrated, aging wife and mother facing life changing events.  Jessica Clarke has a physical and sexual aura that lights up the screen.  Her face is like a canvas and it is difficult not to be captivated by her. I even liked the ending of this film.

5422705,2,B00AFDN5Y0,"I rented this movie based on the 30 mostly positive reviews on Amazon regarding this film and seeing the preview of this film on youtube. What I expected to see was a passionate love story about an unhappy, sexually unfilled middle aged married straight woman who falls in love with a gorgeous call girl (what I imagined to be a lesbian version of Pretty Woman.) What I got instead was seeing a stepdad rape his daughter; not enough character development of the leads (especially Paris the call girl); some red herrings on the what was really going on with 'Rebecca', and a very sad and depressing ending (which is the exact opposite of ""A Perfect Ending"" imho.)  I wasn't expecting an unhappy ending, which is not 'A Perfect Ending' in my book

While I adored the (1) love scenes; (3) the incredibly gorgeous Jessica Clark who plays Paris the call girl; and (3) the divine Barbara Niven who plays Rebecca, the cliched script, direction, and over-loud soundtrack for this film couldn't overcome its assets.

I am very happy I rented this film so I didn't have to buy a $20 DVD that I never would have watched after the 1st showing.  If you want to see 'a perfect(ly) happy ending' to a lesbian film, watch -- When Night is Falling, Imagine Me and You, Elena Undone, or Kiss Me (a Swedish film).",1358553600,71,1294,4.564655172413793

5422721,5,B00AFDN5Y0,"This movie mesmerized and astonished me in a way that is indescribable. I cried throughout  because it opened my eyes to the pain I suffered for the last 30 years. Coming out as a trans-woman while still employed by a metro NYC police department as a Division Commander, I lost everything and everyone so loved by me. Since then for approximately 25 years, I too yearned for someone to love me for who I am but, to no avail. I went to bed that night thinking also of the loneliness and void that is my life. I guess that I too, will somehow fade from mortality ever destined never to have warmth, love and happiness just once in this lifetime. janetaiello13@yahoo.com",1358208000,2,667,4.512396694214876
5422722,5,B00AFDN5Y0,"The perfect movie. It's a cross between an art house film and a block buster movie.  I'm usually really aware of how a movie is built to manipulate my feelings, but I was totally absorbed in this one,  it is subtle and moving and heart felt.  The performances by Clark and Niven were impeccable and the direction and production values were perfection.",1358208000,,351,4.629032258064516
5422723,5,B00AFDN5Y0,"This was a beautiful love story. Though it was sad, it still had a happy ending. The acting was excellent.",1358208000,,106,4.35
5422724,4,B00AFDN5Y0,"I really liked it but at the same time was a tad disappointed. Barbara Niven was very very brave to play the role she did, there is a lot of nudity and the journey her character goes on is a tough one. She is gorgeous btw. I guess I expected more development outside of the bedroom between Rebecca and Paris. I would have liked to see them sneak a date in somewhere and to see Pairs being more affected by Rebecca while she was with her other John's. I also didn't care about what Rebecca's (Niven) children were doing, nor did I really care about Paris's (Clarke) past since it really had nothing to do with the main plot line of the story and the telling of Paris's past was choppy, drawn out, and hard to follow.

The amazing love scenes rival those in Desert Hearts BUT the music played during EVERY love making scene drove me INSANE. The sound editing throughout the movie was horrible. It was hard to make out words especially during the sex. I would have liked to hear the women, not some annoying LOUD music playing in the background. Also their editor of photography should be slapped, I found so many scenes were in one shot a person had a scarf on, a different camera angle of the same scene the scarf or glass or flowers or necklace were gone. It was little inconsistencies like this that brought my rating of 5 stars down to 4.

Slight Spoilers:

I found it hard to believe that a stuck up middle aged house wife would 1, have lesbians as best friends 2, stand by her husband (no matter how much money he had) after what he did to her daughter (she was much stronger than that)and 3, have a raging love affair with a woman while going through what she is going through instead of spending time with her kids.
Speaking of Rebecca's lesbian best friends (Wells and Corcoran) their chemistry was great! I'd love to see a movie with just them. John Heard (the ass hole husband) gave a great performance also. Morgan Fairchild as the `pimp' just confused me with her weird role and odd obsession with dolls.

Over all I really did like this movie, I watched it about 5 times, Barbara and Jessica had amazing chemistry and the plot line was decent, it just really needed to be tweaked so the story was tighter. I highly recommend checking it out its very hot and Barbara Niven's performance is amazing.",1358208000,22,2309,4.413145539906103
5422725,5,B00AFDN5Y0,"I finally saw this movie after watching the trailer several times.  I ended up renting it and watched it about 6 times.  This movie is so wonderful.  I laughed, I cried, I cried so hard.  I felt like I was living Rebecca's story.  It helped me understand some things I have been feeling lately.  I haven't been able to stop thinking about this movie.  They couldn't have picked anyone better to play these two ladies.  Congratulations on a very moving film.  I will be purchasing a copy of my very own.",1358035200,16,502,4.428571428571429

5422728,3,B00AFDN5Y0,"First of all I have to say that I was happy to see that a new lesbian movie was out, they're few and far between.
Not like some other reviewers, I didn't find it to be a masterpiece, I thought that it was confusing at times, lacked fluidity between the scenes with the overuse of in and out of focus and still frames which annoyed me more and more as the movie progressed. I also found some of the acting stiff by some of the supporting cast, like they were all too aware that they were on camera. It was fun though to see M. Fairchild and J. Heard.

I understood Rebecca where she was coming from and what she was looking for, i.e passion, etc. But nothing was said about how Paris went from widow to escort girl other than her saying that she was making a lot of money and her own schedule. I think that it would have been better to learn how this ""transition"" happened to get a better grasp on her character.

Overall, I thought that it was an OK movie, I have seen better but also way worse.",1357862400,4,995,4.123711340206185
5422729,5,B00AFDN5Y0,"So I have finally seen the movie or should I say the ""Emotionally Mesmerising Piece of Artistic Beauty"" I have seen in some time. Nicole Conn and Marina Rice Bader you have stunned me. I loved ""Elena Undone"" and never imagined you could reach so much higher with your works. Boy was I wrong. The artwork itself was simply awesome. The actors were passionate in every respect. From Imelda Corcoran and Mary Wells characters so beautifully matched as a couple (loved their words for love...erotic, delicious, magical, mystical). To Morgan Fairchild and Rebecca Staab's characters watching over Paris. They way you brought Barbara Niven/Rebecca's vulnerability from the first love scene to Jessica Clark/Paris' vulnerability to the last love scene...all I can say is what an emotional journey. The episode with the ring and whether it was precious due to it's monetary value...made me think of the true value of some of my possessions. And the way it was filmed with the smallest details and stunning angles. Tal Lazar is a truly talented artist in every respect. Congratulations ladies for once again bringing the best to us.",1357862400,18,1123,5.043010752688172

Yet.......The stroyline was so beautifully written it allowed time for the viewer to establish his or her own perspective of how you may think it's going to end however,  it wasn't till the last few scenes where the true essence of this movie fell into place (for me) & it just blew me away, truly.....""Well done"" yet again :)",1357862400,7,502,4.397849462365591

Morgan Fairchild was exceptionaly brilliant n lovely as Valentina.  Nicole has a way of making movies that you can watch over and over again and experience differently each time you watch.

5422734,5,B00AFDN5Y0,"Shoot me!!
What can I say?
As many of you know, I'm an ageing white hetero male....who lives for SEX!!
And the sex scenes in ""A Perfect Ending"" by Nicole Conn are HOT, baby, HOT!!
I'm telling you, I think Barbara Niven (who plays Rebecca, a 50'ish straight wife and mother) had a REAL orgasm when she bedded down with high-priced call girl ""Paris"" (played by an exotic erotic Jessica Clark)that first time!!
No, really!!
After seeing (and HEARING!!!) it...well, there goes Meg Ryan's claim to fame!!  (Remember ""When Harry Met Sally""??  In the deli??)
Ms Conn, who produced the ""longest kiss in cinema history"" in ""Elena Undone"", now can lay claim (I believe!) to THE most sustained erotic and pulse-pounding lesbian sex episode in a mainstream movie!!!
Okay, now that I got THAT off my chest, let me tell you a bit about the REST of the movie!!
(After my breathing returns to normal!!)
One reviewer thinks this has too much ""heterosexual"" activity.
I could sort of understand that, since Nicole Conn is known for her excellent ""lesbian movies"", such as ""Claire of the Moon"", ""Cynara:Poetry in Motion"", and ""Elena Undone"".
One problem, however.
Except for a couple of very brief scenes of call girl Paris ""doing her thing"" with some male clients, there AIN'T no heterosexual sex in this movie!!
Not even Rebecca with her husband, played by John Heard!
Okay, from the top!
Rebecca, as noted, is married with (3) children. (One of them is my namesake, thank you!!)
But her sex life ain't too great, as she tells her lesbian friends (Yes, straights CAN be friends with gays and lesbians, and not catch it!!) she's ""never ever"" had an orgasm, and has never known great passion.
(BTW, one of her friends is played by ""Elena Undone"" vet, Mary Wells, who was ""Wave"" in ""Elena""! Another ""Elena"" vet in this movie is Gary Weeks (He was ""Barry"" in ""Elena""!), who plays a doctor here.)
It's suggested she go to a WOMAN to try to heat up her sex life!!
Ms Conn shows her comedic turn with the first few encounters between Rebecca and Paris (and another call girl).
She freaks out when Paris starts to put the make on her!!
It's pretty funny!!
But eventually, things settle down a bit.
That is, until they get between the sheets!! (See beginning of this review!)
I won't go much further, because some things emerge that drastically alter what each imagined might happen.
Ms Niven is so INSIDE her character, you really believe she's a ""novice"", as Morgan Fairchild, who plays ""Valentine"", the ""Madame"" who sent Paris to Rebecca, writes on the appointment memo!!
And Jessica Clark reminded me somewhat of Necar Zadegan, who played ""Elena"".
They each exude a ""foreign"" quality, with a European undercurrent of sensual eroticism, that completely mesmerizes Rebecca....as she did ME!!
Sooooooo seductive!!
About ""Paris"", she's also a struggling artist, who does ""pointillist"" paintings.  Pointillism was made famous by Georges Seurat during the Impressionist period in, you guessed it, PARIS (France)!!
The ending (which came way too soon!!!) is unexpected, and.......! Sorry, this is where my review ends.  You'll have to see ""A Perfect Ending"" to find out for yourself if, indeed, ""A Perfect Ending"" HAD a perfect ending.
When watching it, have a couple of tissues handy!!
And DO watch it!!
You won't be sorry!!",1357689600,7,3296,4.8698752228163995
5422735,3,B00AFDN5Y0,"I saw this melodrama at the 2012 Los Angeles Gay & Lesbian Film Festival. By the time the end credits roll on Nicole Conn's latest idea for a lesbian story, you will have sat through an overdose of heterosexual sex, heterosexual relationships, and heterosexual lovemaking. It actually opens with a call girl, the mysterious Paris (Jessica Clark), helping a man get his S&M freak on, followed by a scene where she's giving another john a hand job. The plot in a nutshell: a wealthy middle-aged married woman, Rebecca (Barbara Niven), has never experienced an orgasm or passionate feelings and she's determined to know what both feel like. Solution? Hire a high-end call girl for the moan and groan. However, even though they both make merry in the homosexual hay, it's important to note that neither the client nor the prostitute considers herself a lesbian. There are intermittent scenes of a doctor informing an unidentified patient about the advancement of terminal cancer and to prepare for the inevitable. [um, gee, who can it be?] The dialogue is bromidic and tedious, the acting sometimes stiff, and the plot all too predictable. But in the end you will have seen sufficient girl-on-girl action to make the 3 hours...I mean, 105 minutes...bearable. Finally, I don't know what world Nicole Conn lives in, but her lesbian vision would be much improved if she understood her lesbian audience and the nature of a homosexual human. There are millions of lesbians who have never had sex with men, nor think about having sex with men, and more who deserve to see a lesbian-theme movie without depictions of romance and sex between men and women thrown into it.

(BTW: The photoshop of Niven (blonde) on this DVD cover is hilarious. It barely even resembles her. No, she's not a bleached-white blonde -- and no, she's not that young. LOL!)",1357516800,8,1837,4.906752411575563
