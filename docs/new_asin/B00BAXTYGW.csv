5568741,1,B00BAXTYGW,"I would gladly pay $50 for an entire season, but for a half season? Absolutely not! .. Paramount, if you don't stop with the half-season bs, and selling for unreasonable prices, the audience will all be dead by the team you release them all, and noone will be able to afford them now. You ought to be ashamed of yourselves for being so greedy!",1364169600,23,343,4.375

5568749,5,B00BAXTYGW,"Gunsmoke provides western-lovers with a family-friendly great show that emphasizes character, law & order, and good plain common sense. This half-season, as well as all previous episodes, provide a breath of fresh air in an age when many of the most entertaining movies have drifted from such character-building values. It is amazing to me that the writers were successful in making the plot and storyline consistently excellent and among the best of the classic Westerns from season to season for so many consecutive seasons. I cannot think of one episode to date that felt weak or that let me down.

Definitely a great addition for the video library of anyone who likes the Western genre, or who likes solid character and good role models in the primary characters, and a strengthening of the ideas of justice, fair play, the rule of law, and even compassion and wisdom throughout.",1471564800,,883,4.966216216216216

5568753,5,B00BAXTYGW,"Gunsmoke was the among the most consistently entertaining television show.  Praise is always lavished on James Arness,  Dennis Weaver, Milburn Stone, and Amanda Blake, and deservedly so.  But, the supporting characters unique to each episode were great too.  Every episode is believable and touches me in some way every time.",1465689600,,325,5.44

5568772,4,B00BAXTYGW,"I have no problem with Gunsmoke itself.  My problem is that I ordered Season 9, Volume 1 at the same time and since there are 5 DVDs in each pack and five to three episodes on each DVD, it takes awhile to view them.  I watched season 9 first and then season 8 volume 2.  The second DVD had several viewing problems but I could not get it replaced because by the time I viewed it it was too late.  It may be best to buy them one at a time unless you want to sit down and view them all at one time instead of spacing them out.",1438300800,4,524,3.779816513761468

5568792,5,B00BAXTYGW,In my opinion Gunsmoke is one of the all-time classic western shows. The shows are well written so the whole family can enjoy them. Sadly this is not the cast with some TV show on television today. DVD reviews are hard to write because is it all personal preference. If you like the show you will enjoy it,1411516800,,305,4.275862068965517

5568797,5,B00BAXTYGW,Ready for Season 9,1406851200,,18,3.75
5568798,5,B00BAXTYGW,"Now fully entrenched in the sixty minute format, the second half of season eight gives us another nineteen top-notch episodes with the expected high quality production values we enjoyed with all the previous years.  Once again veteran writers Kathleen Hite and John Meston were responsible for most of the episodes with six each.  One new writing talent to come on board was Paul Savage, a former actor on the radio series, who wrote the final three instalments of the season and who later would be a regular scripter and story consultant on the show. Harry Harris Jr. helmed seven episodes and Andrew V. McLaglen was director of five.
Among the bevy of great character actors (one of the great features of ""Gunsmoke"" over the years) featured in this half-season: John Dehner, Will Hutchins, Milton Selzer, Warren Stevens, Richard Jaeckel, Kent Smith, R.G. Armstrong, Sharon Farrell, Beverly Garland, James Best, Ben Johnson, Roy Thinnes  and Edgar Buchanan.
""Gunsmoke"" has never lost its universal appeal. Solid writing and directing with great characterizations, shrewd acting choices and the continuing strength of its principal cast now including Burt Reynolds as half-breed Quint Asper, adding a little extra edge to the series.
Now for season nine!",1405987200,,1254,5.2288557213930345

5568807,5,B00BAXTYGW,"Gunsmoke is one of the all time classic TV westerns. Still shown in B/W during season 8; hour long episodes. The DVD's due tend to be a little pricey but if you watch the sales at amazon, sometimes you can get it for a really good price. The shows are well written. I just wish they had had more episodes with Chester. Burt Reynolds joined the show in season 8. There ARE English subtitles for the hearing impaired.",1388966400,7,415,4.333333333333333
