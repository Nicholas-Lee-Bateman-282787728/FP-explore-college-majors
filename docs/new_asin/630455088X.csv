7874087,5,630455088X,"This movie is brilliant. It takes every rule any viewer could even theoretically cherish and shatters them gleefully. In a word, this movie is playful, and people hate it when you present that dreaded admixture of playfulness and ""adult"" topics. It makes no discernible nod to any blazed trail in moviemaking methodology, and that's why people don't like it: because they don't recognize it. You can't make something completely impossible to gauge against preexisting product unless you're dropdead serious like David Lynch. Big no-no. So if you have any expectations whatsoever, do not watch this movie. You won't like it, that's just the way it is being a neurogenetic collective of primates. But if you can dig something ridiculous sans bravado in an adult-ish setting, then by all means check your maturity at the door, get stupid and watch this.",1519084800,,850,5.078571428571428
7874088,1,630455088X,"I've seen bad movies before, or at least I thought I had. I've even referred to a couple of movies as the worst ever made. Then I watched Caress of the Vampire 2, and it has changed me forever; whatever innocence was left in my blackened soul is now gone. There aren't enough adjectives to describe just how horrible this movie is. I am literally in shock, having suffered a fate I would not wish on my worst enemy. I may never be able to laugh or smile again.
Don't worry if you haven't seen the first Caress of the Vampire movie because this ""sequel"" has absolutely nothing to do with it. This cinematic beast makes no sense whatsoever; I have no idea what it was supposed to be about, so all I can do is touch on a few ""lowlights"" of this curse inflicted on mankind by Brain Escape Pictures and Severed Lips Recordings. First, there is a flagrantly gay, androgynous fellow who is bitten by a great big lizard; he then bleeds all over a pale guy lying on the bed. This guy is none other than Billy the Vampire. Then we're in the office of Dr. Ackula, a podiatrist with an uncontrollable foot fetish, as he does nasty things with a patient's foot and then strangles her. After Ackula loses his job, Billy shows up to save the day, promising him eternal foot-slaves and then turning him into a vampire. A few girls pop up at random to dance, be turned into vampires, and play with each other's feet. Then Billy's agent comes over and decides to turn the disgusting mob of ghouls into a band; we, the incredibly reluctant audience, are forced to listen to it. Then both people and vampires start killing each other and eventually the movie ends (but not before destroying the sanity of the viewer). Throughout the story, we are treated to one-second flashbacks to things already having happened, we sometimes have to watch things repeated over and over again as if John Madden was practicing his coach's clicker with this movie, and blood appears and disappears according to some law that is not recognized in our universe, where time generally runs one way without hiccoughing. There's a little blood, as folks sometimes vomit ketchup out of their mouths for no reason, but this slight touch of gore accomplishes nothing.
The makers of this movie figured out how to include every single little nuance that guarantees complete and utter failure. This film should be turned over to authorities and destroyed, with monitors watching from all angles to make sure the job gets done completely. This world is a much darker, more hopeless place as long as a copy of this film exists anywhere. I can't even begin to tell you how utterly atrocious this movie is. I can only warn you to stay away from Caress of the Vampire 2 at all costs.",1045008000,,2729,4.560081466395112
7874089,2,630455088X,"This movie is well packaged, it appeals to people (like myself) who love ""bad"" films as well as people who love vampire movies and/or people who like Waters/Warhall-ish depraved sickness.  But the movie just  doesn't live up to the promise of the box, or for that matter, of the  review above from Alternative Cinema, which I suspect was written by  someone at least marginally associated with the fim...I'm sorry, this movie  just doesn't go far enough in any direction to be fun or interesting.  It's  not ""drole"", it's not ""hipster"", it's not even sick,  it's just very amaturish.  Sure, bad acting can be part of the fun in a low  budget effort, but here the actors improvise all of their own dialogue, so  we have awful writing, as well.  The filmakers here miss the point: bad  acting is most fun when it's unintentionally bad, i.e. when everybody is  really trying to be as good as they can. Nothing is ever clear enough in  this movie to be interesting or even mildly erotic. The girls are not  gorgeous, the vampires are not scary or sexy, the writing is beyond  bad...what's really lacking is that one person who actually has just a  modicum of talent who brings some fun or scary or stylish ideas to the  film. A vision of some kind. Having said all this, I give the film two  stars because 1) hey, they got it done and on the market 2) the music was  fun sometimes and 3) if you happen to be a foot fetish person (I'm not)  there are couple of scenes just for you, and that's fairly rare.",949536000,2,1500,4.4375
7874090,2,630455088X,"A very strange movie indeed. I am still not sure what it was about. It seems to be about a movie vampire with a foot fedish, but I can't be sure. The movie was OK but somehow I liked the first film better. If this is a  sequel they missed the point of a sequel.",949104000,2,261,3.7454545454545456
