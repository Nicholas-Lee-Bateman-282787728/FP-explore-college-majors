5253829,5,075792347X,"I am new to the mandolin so I was looking for something to start me off on the right foot. I have several years of guitar behind me (as well as some violin) so I was not sure whether to start on a beginner book.

The book starts you off with the real basics (how to hold a pick, read music and tab etc). It starts you off with really slow and simple songs and introduces the bluegrass backbeat and the simple chords.

For a guitar player the first half of the book goes very quickly, but the second has held my attention for some time. It describes a good set of left and right hand practice session and slowly builds to what I would think of as more intermediate level tunes.

The tunes are all played on the CD for demonstration, but at the end of the CD there are full band arrangements of the tunes. I am not a bluegrass player, but I think one of the really neat features of the book is that you can buy corresponding versions for guitar and banjo with the same tunes and put a fun little group together.",1213142400,18,1009,4.111675126903553

8534990,1,075792347X,"This was difficult to follow. The teacher moves much too fast and I am an experienced mandolin player. I was hoping to improve my skills and learn some new material. However, the lessons were too basic in the beginning then progressed much too rapidly.",1383177600,,252,4.75
8534991,3,075792347X,"I was never great at learning how to play instruments from a DVD, but this one was fairly explanatory and informative. If you want to learn the mandolin, it's probably best to learn from an instructor you can ask questions and not from a DVD.",1374364800,,242,4.4
8534992,4,075792347X,"Useful book and easy to read illustrations, tips, and instructions.  I'll eventually need a regular teacher, but at least I will be able to get started.",1359936000,,152,4.846153846153846
8534993,2,075792347X,The DVD  arrived fine and all. but the pictur quality was low and it was very difficult to navigate. I addition you have to look around for practice pages and then you have to print them out to use then and the print quality was poor. For about the same price I got a Mel Bay book through my local shop and it came with a far superior DVD. Since it is a book I don't have to print anything.,1358812800,,390,3.875
8534994,5,075792347X,"The DVD is quite easy to understand; you can simply pause or rewind when you want to slow down the pace a bit. The presenter knows how to explain the concepts quite well. This represents one of the best uses for DVDs, that of instruction in playing a musical instrument when no teachers are available. Highly recommended.",1335916800,2,321,4.649122807017544
8534995,2,075792347X,I bought this DVD and a mandolin chord book. The DVD I watched once then I signed up for a 7 week group beginner's mandolin lesson. The 10 person lesson for the 75.00 90min weekly far exceeds anything I could ever learn on a silly DVD. BUT... if you live in a rural area or an area that doesn't have or appreciate fantastic beautiful instruments like the mandolin-I guess the DVD may be you only exposure. You may want to buy it here or used or check you local library.,1290211200,,469,4.222222222222222
8534996,4,075792347X,"This is a good monkey-see, monkey do ensemble, but the instructor tends to move rather quickly through some moves and fingering routines. That said, it's one of the best available. A good introduction to some basic bluegrass tunes.",1279929600,6,231,5.105263157894737
8534997,5,075792347X,"I tried two other introduction to the mandolin DVDs and found both of them hard to learn from (though I'm sure they have much to teach someone with more basics).  This one starts with very basic instruction and moves quickly to songs and techniques that are challenging for a beginner and quite impressive.  Everything is explained very clearly, and there are some nice performances (with other instruments) that are inspiring enough to push you forward.  I'm actually taking private lessons as well, but we're using this disk as a starting point, which makes me even more confident that it teaches you the important stuff in the right way.

All in all, a very well thought out and helpful introduction; it uses the advantages of DVD (along with PDF files for the sheet music and tabs) to get you off (I hope) to a good start.  The instructor is Dennis Caplinger, and I am very grateful to him and his colleagues.",1268956800,18,913,4.68125
8534998,5,075792347X,"This is by far the best DVD for beginning the Mandolin and playing bluegrss. The
instuction and instrutor moved at a very good pace. Very Good.",1252972800,7,143,4.538461538461538
