8747350,2,B01AGX3UO8,Not worth the purchase.  Did not cover all aspects of options needed for research.,1503964800,,82,4.857142857142857
8747351,5,B01AGX3UO8,Johnna Janis does an extraordinary job of shattering the silence to sexual abuse. Something so many survivors are ashamed to talk about Johnna speaks bravely about her own childhood abuse. In this moving documentary Johnna not only shares her personal experience of abuse and breaking her silence but talks to the lives of many other survivors male and female. It is a wake up call to society on just how big of a problem child sexual abuse really is. Very inspiring documentary highly recommend.,1472256000,,496,4.916666666666667
8747352,5,B01AGX3UO8,I just met Johnna Janis and watched her amazing movie!!! We need to open up with people and share our stories so that people can heal and we can stop the abuse.,1464652800,,160,4.03125
8747353,5,B01AGX3UO8,"I really was moved by this documentary.  It's a vital look at one of our society's worst problems (sexual abuse of children) but also life-affirming and even uplifting in that it shows a positive way forward both to heal victims and to enlighten the general population about this horrific -- and very very common -- crime.  i really feel it should be required viewing for parents, and as well for upper-high school and college-age kids.  By not stigmatizing the victims we can help to wipe it out and jail the perpetrators.",1462320000,,523,4.725274725274725

8747355,5,B01AGX3UO8,"I have been working to recover from childhood sexual abuse consciously for more than 28 years.  I first ""encountered"" my memories in a
guided hypnosis session when I was approaching 40.  It was powerful and opened a painful door.  I have had years of therapy, done reams
of writing, been to many  meetings of Adults Molested as Children as well Survivors of Sexual Abuse (both 12-step programs).  I have
also attended workshops in this topic from both alternative and traditional counselors. It has all helped.  Nevertheless, I still felt anxious to sit and watch this film tonight. I asked my dear husband to watch with me, to help me deal with things that it might ""trigger"" and I admit having him sit near by was a TRUE COMFORT.  If you have someone to sit with you, do yourself a favor and ask for the support.  It will make it easier.  It was scary to ask but I'm really glad I did.  Throughout this clearly thought out, empowering and brave film, I watched my body react in a variety of positions of tightness, anxiety, and sometimes even peace.  The story is not so graphic and raw that I wanted to puke on myself, but it wasn't so watered down as to be a thousand euphemisms that ""wiped out the truth.""  I felt myself engaged, understood, appreciated, honored, respected and in multiple
ways, gained in self-confidence and self-awareness that are building more steps toward that which we all want:  Ultimate Healing.  This is not the only leaf to turn over, but its an entirely beautiful and essential one.  Its something I'll be passing around to my sister, my girl friend, and many others for the next years.  Recommended without hesitation.  I wrote a review about the classic book:  The Courage To Heal and in that, I said:  ""Don't read without first getting a therapist.""  This film can help you recognize your need for therapy, but it isn't likely to shock you into
a melt down or flashback of monumental proportions.  Of course, if it does, DO GET A THERAPIST...and a good one.  People who know EMDR and or EFT have been particularly helpful for this issue in my case. Also art therapists and Jungian therapists  seem more clued in. Note:  If you are a woman, be careful when you work with a male therapist. Some of them have turned out to be predators too.  Get good recommendations from others if you can.  I am glad I purchased this film and I know I will watch it many times.  Johnna has shared a brave and beautiful portrait and I admire her greatly.  Not one slice of film was superficial or meaningless.  Brilliantly done!  Likely to be a perennial best seller.",1460332800,,2583,4.588621444201313
8747356,5,B01AGX3UO8,"Amazing film, truly comprehensive look at the healing process and why it is important for all of us to understand the related financial and sociaL issues that result from childhood abuse.",1459296000,,187,5.064516129032258
