1348453,5,B00004STRJ,"I find the ""Ancient Secrets of the Bible"" a very helpful tool in providing a very reasonable scientific expalanation to some of the stories in Scripture. My students ranging from 3rd grade to university level have been able to follow the contents of the program without difficulty. I do hope the company will continue to produce more of this kind of videos. I am a Catholic priest and a university campus ministry chaplain. I highly recommend this set to anyone studying Scripture at any educational level. It provides a good response to those seeking to reconcile both faith and reason. And for those who already believe in the Bible, it provides an added affirmation to one's faith.",1103760000,33,684,4.854700854700854
1348454,3,B00004STRJ,"This was a pretty fun and entertaining series. It was great to see many stories from the bible re-enacted and, like the Veggie Tales series, provided once again a reminder of the many bible's passages. Every now and again when one wants to watch something other than cable/broadcast TV it's great to flip on.

 However, if one is looking for unbiased viewpoints and for an actual academic bible study, the series title is very misleading. When the main endorsement on the box is from the campus crusades for christ international versus a professor of a theological seminary, you realize the series is for entertainment and ""spiritual"" purposes and not for any actual theological or academic purpose. Even my friends who are ministers saw the series more as entertaining propoganda than revealing any actual historical or scientific secrets, but hey, I thought that all in all a pretty good effort. I would have given it more stars except for that the title of the series didn't really match the real intent of it.",1090627200,15,1013,4.883720930232558
1348455,4,B00004STRJ,"While many like to heckle science if it doesn't back up a Humanistic view of the world, these DVD's will be a very helpful addition to anyone's collection.  It shows good solid proofs for many of the ancient events recorded in the earliest parts of the Bible while giving detractors a voice. It's so funny that when good science is done it's called bad, but when bad science is done it's called good. Fortunetly (besides the more then 2000 years of attacks upon it) the stories of the Bible prove true.
Don't bother with people who give a silly one star rating with useless and biased comments like this: ""Amateurish, dubious archelogical references, this collection is poorly performed, edited, and researched. The bible stories are typically traditional. All in all, nothing new and intellectually painful viewing. I recommend Mysteries of the Bible for substance.""  You can tell by the rhetorical tone of their writing that their lying and are the ones with bad research.  Everything in the show's are scientifically verifiable and the top scientists (who aren't Anti-Christian) in their fields confirm the findings, even if they aren't Christians.",1076976000,32,1151,5.079365079365079
1348456,5,B00004STRJ,"I found one of these at a Best Buy years ago, and loved it till it went blurry. Have wanted the whole set ever since. Shows both the pro and con arguments about Bible events like Crossing the Red Sea, Samson, and Noah's Ark. Then lets you decide. Intelligent experiments and archaeological evidence support the experts' positions. Refreshing. I didn't feel I had to double check the information for prejudice.",1074556800,6,409,4.857142857142857
1348457,1,B00004STRJ,Perhaps my expectations were too high.  I found these stories to be re-enactments instead of documentary in type.  They were tacky.,982195200,4,131,5.190476190476191

1348466,3,B00004STRJ,"Seek and yea shall find, not accept and you will find. It takes an open mind and sincere effort to find truth.
Having studied the commonality of ideals of capitalistic democracy, communism and religion worldwide its disconcerting to find throughout the ages the majority of resources serving extravagance, hierarchy and consolidation of power often achieved and maintained through the exploitation, depredation and ignorance of the common man  - Not to mention the persecutions and ravages caused by related warfare.
Such social entities go great lengths to create the perception of order from chaos, then fill in the discontinuities with canned patriotism, the requirement of faith to obtain eternal life, or worse avoid eternal hell.
It seems many people need structure, ritual, definition  ...an iconic supernatural entity to embellish, plead their cares to, worship And integral reward system to derived security from being destined for eternal life.
Although within all creeds and religions there are exceptional individuals with characteristics and values worthy of emulation, its common to project lesser human qualities unto the character of the divine and worship, cater too and regulate others accordingly while depending on divine intervention instead of taking personal responsibility to create a sustainable world and purifying ones motives while realistically aspire to whatever brings about the greatest possible harmony for all things.
Must we subscribe to exclusive assumptions without reservation and continually seed the beds of worldwide ecological disaster, convolution, divisiveness and strife?
... And why not goodness for its own sake? What could be simpler, more purifying, self-affirming, divine in character ...and to the point!

Religions with by far with the greatest following are those having integral reward systems i.e. those that promise eternal bliss and other incentives for adhering to an assumed supreme doctrine. Though there are those of religious orientation with admirable motives, many delude themselves of having genuine love/devotion, the real fascination and motivation deriving primarily from celebrity like status and power of religious figures and promise of an eternally blissful after-life. Take away the embellishments: Business-as-usual insurance policy.

 Secure in being raptured and eternity bound beliefs based on faith rather than proven fact manifest into serious threats from a third of the world not sharing fully responsibility for critical issues such as over-population, environmental degradation and general long-term planetary sustainability.

 Personally I find the conventional Christian concept of salvation and crucification baffling. Was Christs sacrifice originally divine or necessary could such a love for humanity been demonstrated inspiringly yet in a less harsh, debt laden manner?

Unlike Christ with decisive foreknowledge of knowing where he came from and going Im didn't submit being born into a world of contradiction, confusion, injustice and chaos. I just want the opportunity to be accepted as an imperfect work in progress and live modestly in peace and harmony - Which should be an inherent birth-right for all things ...so is there a logical reason to be beholding or saved?

 If there be a divine entity he would not have the petty traits, egotism, subjugations, and inflexible technical judgments projected onto him by people, but qualities of compassionate commonality.

Regardless of orientation it would seem cultivating an open heart, mind, progressive nature and aspirational focus on whatever brings about the greatest possible harmony to all things without further expectation of reward the more essential integral qualifying, comprehensive, and purifying essence of spirituality and human potential.

Devastating Perfection: Many find reason to question the existence of an all-powerful God with so much suffering having occurred to the innocent throughout the ages. Was Jesus wondrously delusional in a beautiful way? Did his disciples pass on biases or exaggerate to have a personal sense of power, security and everlasting future or many thereafter delete, distort embellish to feel special, superior, exploit otherwise? Bearing in mind faith is just that; faith not fact, leaves one with the premise that if there is some kind of divine order then lifes primary purpose is to learn and evolve to interact harmoniously. Though there can be no doubt for those of progressive inclination living is a great character building, many experiences seem pointless and even cruel still there is hope: For just as its unreasonable to assume the existence of the divine, its also to conclude its non-existence, for as myself, many people around the world regardless of religion or otherwise have had similar miraculous experiences with a common thread with no other possible explanation other than being of divine origin (i.e. see oberf.org). Having exhausted logical explanations, could inexplicable chaos and confusion serve a greater purpose of purification of motive and goodness for its own sake in other words regardless of what the future may hold aspiring to whatever manifests the greatest harmony for all things and therefore our greater and truer salvation as a planet, race and individual?

Antidote for what may be a godless world: If we find transcendent beauty and compassion in ourselves and examples elsewhere then surely in the vastness of the universe are evolved worlds, dimensions and beings of empathy that have manifested such benevolent harmonious qualities sustainably.

Such certainty assures great possibilities here and beyond for beings throughout the cosmos of progressive inclination.",1426291200,,5705,5.634032634032634

1348470,2,B00004STRJ,"not science at all. If you look up the supposed scientists, the vast majority are creationists. It is really hilarious how their supposed scientific investigations always show the exact results they were looking for. This is a disgraceful misrepresentation of the real scientific findings. Dr Bryan Wood and his redating of Jerico so that it corresponds to the Bible is now refuted by numerous scientific findings.

1348471,5,B00004STRJ,"I remember channel surfing Dish Networks exhaustive guide 3 years and came across this gem of a show. The Flood epsiodes are some of my favorite ones because they include scientifical facts, a skepitcal approach and biblical truths.  The speakers in the shows can still be tracked on the internet to cross reference what they are saying.

This is an informative show, and wish it was on Blu-Ray.",1417046400,,395,4.794117647058823
1348472,3,B00004STRJ,Just like one reviewer said that its a religious group production not really unbiased. The content was good though but you can tell its like a Sunday school program. But I also believe what Albert Einstein had to say about universal creation an that he wasn't a believer in God so much as that there must be a divinity which had to start things going. So when you have a genius like Enstein scratching his head knowing nothing can't create something that there must be something or someone to have started the ball rolling somehow makes us all knowing there maybe life after death after all. I don't see a lot of secrets but mostly conformation on religious beliefs.,1413158400,4,666,4.605042016806722

1348477,5,B00004STRJ,I had borrowed the VHS version.  The DVD version produces a much higher quality picture.  The direction and production are top quality and the content which contrasts Bible Critics with Modern Archeology (through 1993) is very informative.  In a nutshell all critical comments on the video are in contrast to available archeological evidence.,1381708800,,342,5.415094339622642

Putting aside the absolutely pitiful production values, bad acting, and so on; the so-called proofs of historical accuracy of these stories are based, at least in part, on known hoaxes.  Evidence presented to support the story of Noah's ark being present today on Mt. Ararat was disproven as a deliberate hoax many years ago.  There is nothing of value presented on these discs.  Better support for whichever point of view you may be coming from, whether supporting the historical accuracy of these stories or disputing it, can be found elsewhere.",1207526400,4,632,4.824074074074074

7921956,3,B00004STRJ,"What fundamentalists of all the Abrahamic faiths fail to accept is that faith and knowledge are two separate things. Faith is not knowledge nor can faith in something be disputed. One can have faith that an invisible unicorn is standing beside them. But that faith is not knowledge. I cannot dispute that person's faith in his invisible unicorn.

But if that person attempts to prove that his invisible unicorn is an object in reality, then he fails. No longer is that person dealing in faith, but is now in the realm of empirical knowledge. Any attempt to make faith and knowledge the same always fails.

Faith is not proof of anything other than faith. If one has proof in the objective/empirical sense, there is no need of faith.

That's the reason that creationism is not science. It's not objective and is not subject to the process of science.

You can have your faith. What you can't have is objective proof and faith as either identical or compatable.",1484092800,,959,4.724550898203593
