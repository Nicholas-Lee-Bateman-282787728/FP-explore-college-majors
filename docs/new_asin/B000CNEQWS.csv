2466363,5,B000CNEQWS,"this is a fascinating documentary about coney island spectacles before the dawn of the PC era.  a brilliant capture of the evolution of one of new york's most intriguing historical landmarks, featuring everything from the advent of the baby incubator, to a village of little people, to the electrocution of a runaway elepahant.  my boyfriend and i went to coney island again after seeing it, and it totally enhanced the experience--a must-see for every new yorker, or new york enthusiast.",1162684800,9,488,5.0875
2466364,5,B000CNEQWS,"There are nights when I have watched this film twice or three times in a row. Wonderful silent film and still photographs accompanied by Eli Wallach's narration and a haunting score. Return to the days when Coney Island was the latest thing in American amusement. There are no other words besides ""absolutely stunning.""",1156118400,28,319,5.037735849056604
2466365,5,B000CNEQWS,"I highly recommend this installment of American Experience. Between the archive footage, celebrity voice overs and atmospheric sound track it really conveys a sense of what New York life was like at the turn of the century.",1156118400,18,223,5.054054054054054
2466366,5,B000CNEQWS,"What an impressive ""style"" of telling the history of Coney Island ! You float through the telling of this story in a haunting mist of many bygone scenes - which made me feel like I were looking through a dusty photo album from a trunk found in the attic of a Victorian home, and my imagination sent flying as I thumbed through the pages. The superb, stylized narrative telling of this history is - the other fifty percent of its' mesmerizing mood. And there's alot of story to tell. As far as I'm concerned - this film should receive some type of an award, if it already hasn't ? It is a real work of ""art."" I would have to sit and think alot - to adequately express all that could be said, because there is much to be said. I guess other's comments have done that for me.",1150588800,7,772,4.1879194630872485
2466367,5,B000CNEQWS,"Having been lucky enough to have seen and videotaped the original broadcast of Ric Burn's ""Coney Island"" way back in 1991 I found myself becoming more and more obsessed with this brilliant documentary. At the time I worked nights and would get home around 3 or 4 a.m. every night - most nights I would pop in my tape of ""Coney Island"" - I lived and breathed this film. It is everything the above review says it is and more. Anyone with a interest in history, immigration, carnivals, amusement parks, nostalgia, film and photography should definatley purchase this film. You will not regret it. Other titles from the amazing Ric Burns include "" The Way West"", "" The Donner Party"" "" New York"" as well as the epic ""The Civil War"" which he did with his brother Ken. As far as ""Coney Island"" goes you'd be nuts to pass this one up.",1147219200,9,826,4.440789473684211
2466368,5,B000CNEQWS,"I saw this years ago, and still can't get it out of my mind.  It is haunting in every way, from the simple up and down single note piano soundtrack to the ageless black and white photos.  It has a storyline with a sad ending, and yet is not depressing; it goes somewhere beyond joy or sadness, and yet it contains plenty of both.  It is strongly tied in my mind to the American story of immigrants, entrepreneurship, more! more! more! lights and razzle-dazzle, and yet has a coda like the lone clown blowing a sad tune from Fellini's movie The Clowns.  I hope that it will haunt you, too.",1136160000,54,588,4.318181818181818

Even if you are not old enough to remember the great parks that called Coney Island home, you will still marvel at the grandeur and grace this DVD explores regarding the history of Coney Island - the once ""playground"" of the rich and famous.  I never saw Luna Park or Dreamland, but I fondly remember Steeple Chase and the thrill of riding the mechanical horses. I loved this presentation when I first saw it on PBS and now I can share it with family and friends. You will not be disappointed with this product.",1351123200,2,621,4.391304347826087
2466397,1,B000CNEQWS,"This is an older show. Made in 1990. I wanted to see the old Coney my dad told me about. I only experienced the 60's at Coney Island! This is a very sad over blown doc. Sorry, but there is NO joy in this piece. Coney was a place of joy for millions of people! This doc shows non of that. The heavy hands who made it tried too hard. There are some good film pieces that show much of the parks that existed, but there is so little joy and happiness, and there are long voice over quotes from famous writers and such that linger on sad pictures with even sadder music!

BEWARE>>>>> there is SEVERE animal cruelty shown in this!!!! This is a scene where they show the electrocution of an elephant! It is totally unnecessary and cruel to show. So disappointing they felt this was needed. There should be a warning on this! Do not let a child watch. It is so disturbing.

What a sad piece of film making.",1310601600,11,898,4.184971098265896
2466398,1,B000CNEQWS,"I rented the ""American Experience - Coney Island DVD a couple of years ago and tried forever to re-rent it.  It was never available again so I purchased this one from Amazon.  When I watched it, it was very different from the rental I had.  There was almost no coverage of the ""little people village"" it was a just a mere mention.  The rental had a lot of coverage of that village, as well as the Moon Ride, among other features of the park.  This Amazon DVD didn't show more than a moment of the Moon ride, I was sad that it didn't have the details I saw on the rental.  I don't know if they re-edited it, but I cannot find that original, better copy with more pictures and much more detail.  If anyone knows where I might find it I would so appreciate it!  I don't remember it having so much of Al Lewis either, if at all. Sadly I didn't log the narrator or publisher, but it was definitely ""american experience""  Jmoore@hntb.com",1284249600,4,931,4.274285714285714

2466400,5,B000CNEQWS,"I saw this documentary yrs. ago on PBS. I gave it to the daughter of the man that re-openned Steeplechase in the 60's after George C. Tilloue sold it to Trumps father. He intially opened it as a parking lot and then added rides and called it Steeplechase Park for almost 50 yrs. His daughter, now 50 had never seen this film. She was suprised to see how large Coney was at the turn of the century. Her father will be too when he sees this film. You have to see this especially if you are a Coney Island fan or a New Yorker!",1231891200,6,523,4.038461538461538
2466401,5,B000CNEQWS,"This is something I remember first watching when I was 11 or 12 years old. It was something my mom wanted me to see because she experienced herself the joys of the (final) years of Steeplechase Park at Coney Island;the human roulette wheel,the blow hole theater,the Nathan's hot dogs;she did it all and all of that is here only more. After watching this I have to admit to myself Luna Park,although it's heyday was at the turn of the century and it burned down 40 years before I was born,looked pretty cool. This documentary shows how a famous beach inspired forward thinking showmen and arcitects to build three amusment parks on Coney Island in the early 1900's;how they provided whimsey,abandon and in some cases cultural stimulation to Americans. At the time Americans were witnessing the end of the Victorian age and the beginning of the modern world-Coney Island blended the two by inventing it's own world that mixed both the reason and morality with invention and industriousness;the perfect mix of old and new. This story becomes bittersweet at the end when Coney Island goes into decline-reason being first one of it's three assmusment parks burning down,the passing and downfall of it's innovators and the fact that the rest of New York (and the country) started catching up fast to the diversions Coney Island offered after WW1. One thing I should say about this is this movie is at least 15 minutes longer then the one PBS originally aired. One whole segment taken entirely from the televised version revolves around how after WW1 Coney Islands two remaining amusment parks began to rely mainly on circus type sideshows,not rides or spectacles to stay afloat. This dreamy documentary is mainly fancinating except,as stated by another review it does feature a chilling film made at Coney Island around 1907 or something of an old elephant named Topsy being electrocuted. Some might find this offensive and not want young kids to see this. And while it is highly unpleasant it illustrates that even the most fun place in the world has it's darker side. But there is a happy ending to this story not shown on this DVD;several years after this was made Austraillia opened up it's own Luna Park;not only does it have a lot of the same features as the original but it remains highly popular. Which proves to me with no doubt that if fire hadn't gutted it the original Luna Park,in the proper hands would've surely made a comeback. A compelling DVD for fans of Coney Island history,amusement parks and even some sociologists.",1222560000,17,2531,4.861111111111111
2466402,4,B000CNEQWS,"Coney Island has become legend. What once was a place for people to gather in excitement and fun is now a hollow ghost of its former self. Still, it is fun to look back on the way it once was during a simpler time in history.

This documentary is extremely well done. The narration is excellent and combines well with the film clips used. The editing is also masterful and helpful to the storytelling. Surprisingly, the film footage is in good condition. Since most of it did not come from a major motion picture, one would think it would be in the same condition as most newsreel footage, but it is clear and watchable. (Ironically, the bit from Clara Bow's ""It"" is in bad shape; it has since been restored.)

The only major flaw here is the little information provided about the 1920s and 30s. So much is explored from the early 1900s because that is when the amusement parks really took off, but what of the time between that and the collapse? One can get an idea of what it was like based on the film clips, but judging from the bathing suits, most of the clips come from the earliest parts of the century.

Overall, this film is a fascinating look at an era lost to the modern world. It is nostalgic and lovingly told.",1200096000,13,1223,4.378854625550661
2466403,4,B000CNEQWS,"Recently, after reading Sarah Hall's book ""The Electric Michelangelo"" i became interested in Coney Island and it's history. Stumbled across this DVD and ordered it. I was a little surprised at how dated the production seems to be. Not that it really interferes with the content since it deals with the history of Coney Island. There are some amazing images here of the three original amusement parks. The thing that I was really hoping for that was not here was some shots of what is in these locations today (I love that kind of stuff). Otherwise, it's a good, if slow paced, documentary.",1193702400,6,589,4.728155339805825
2466404,5,B000CNEQWS,"A beautiful film that gives a fascinating history of Coney Island from its discovery by Europeans to its current fading glory. As a child of the 50's, I'm happy to revisit a happy cache of memories. It also makes you wish you could have glimpsed Dreamland & Luna Park because the venues seem to rival the attractions available in today's amusement parks. I hope that the planned gentrification of modern Coney doesn't spoil the flavor & enchantment for future generations. Thanks Ric Burns for preserving an important piece of history, not just for New Yorkers, but for everyone who has a sense of imagination & love of adventure.",1191196800,4,630,4.842592592592593
2466405,5,B000CNEQWS,"For anyone to understand what Coney Island means to people (especially those with a direct connection to the place), they'd have to see this documentary. The legendary amusement parks and their eventual demise is a compelling story of the rise and fall of a universal icon.
In this, the first of Ric Burns' American Experience documentary films, the dynamic of this unique place is captured so well, I can barely watch it without tears emerging uncontrollably from my eyes.
A must see for anyone interested in New York City, the rise of recreation and amusement in America for the new working class with a day off, amusement parks; and most of all Coney Island itself.",1182816000,13,668,4.817391304347826

8099493,5,B000CNEQWS,"Thoroughly enjoyable history of Coney Island as a playground for the masses.  Full of amazing footage, great stories, wonderful actors reading letters, and some fun on camera interviews -- especially actor Al Lewis.  Lewis was known best as Grandpa Munster from the series ""The Munsters"", but it turns out he started as a barker on Coney Island, and he tells some terrific stories.

Even though I grew up in NYC, I never knew the level of grandeur and popularity Coney Island held from the 1890s through the 1940s before seeing Ric Burns' excellent film.  The images make it clear it really was a sort of vaguely perverse, but beautiful Disneyland of its time; ablaze with lights, inventive rides, and a place where people of all classes and races freely mixed.  Gotta love it when a part of the history of your home town is opened up to you, especially in such an entertaining way.",1462406400,,882,4.701298701298701
