8667003,4,B00LO0E8EE,"I really want to see this documentary which sounds first-rate, but I live in the UK, don't have access to Netflix, so it will do me no good to order it online.",1494374400,,159,4.0
8667004,1,B00LO0E8EE,"same old same old documentary about the most publicised artist in the game of blatant self-promotion. there's really nothing revelatory on this one except the title. He was, after all, expelled from the SurrealistGang for Crimes-Against-Art.

 if you haven't seen a Dali documentary before, maybe this'll be worth watching.",1484006400,,323,5.571428571428571
8667005,5,B00LO0E8EE,"Paul Perry opens the door to the mystifying account of the Vision of Hell by Dali.  His timely film helps to reveal the unknown truths. I find it interesting to note that having recently visited the Salvador Dali museum in St. Petersburg, our a well-informed tour guide, was unaware of this painting. Thank you, Paul Perry",1427760000,2,322,4.75
8667006,5,B00LO0E8EE,"Paul Perry's video ""Salvador Dali's Greatest Secret"" will leave you with a better understanding of who Dali was.  Dali wasn't only a Spanish actor but he was also a surreal artist in film, scripture and photography.  Dali painted the vision of ""Hell"" which was described to him by Sister Lucia from the Lady of Fatima.  Paul Perry impresses his audience by narrating and interviewing Dali's friends and those who knew him best.  I found ""Salvador Dali's Greatest Secret"" to be informative and interesting from beginning to end.  5 STARS",1424563200,2,536,4.977528089887641
8667007,5,B00LO0E8EE,"Salvador Dali was much more than an acclaimed artist. He was a writer, he was a visionary, he was a philosopher and he was an often confused and misguided religious zealot. Paul Perry's documentary centering around the famous painting, The Vision of Hell, tells us a great deal about how Dali thought and what he believed. It is also a documentary that doesn't sugar coat Dali's confusion on matters of religion, his personal life and his thoughts of an imminent death. The vision of the children at Fatima is central to the story and Perry tells it well. What sets Salvador Dali's Greatest Secret apart from other documentaries is the film making. In a carefully paced, but action filled, documentary, Perry illustrates what drove Dali's thinking, what the response of the Catholic hierarchy was to a painting that they were less than enthusiastic about, and he is able to illustrated how the times drove Dali's thinking. The highlight of the documentary is the cogent commentary, the use of illustrations and the pacing of what is a great mystery. The cinematographer provides sweeping shots of the influences that makes Salvador Dali's Greatest Secret a documentary that has already had an Oscar buzz in Europe. It deserves this consideration in the American market. This is the finest documentary I have ever seen on a single piece art, the artist in crisis,and the historical events that drove Dali's painting. This is an entertaining, well made, piece of film that should not be missed.",1418342400,3,1492,4.972
8667008,5,B00LO0E8EE,"Salvador Dali's connection with Our Lady of Fatima is a story that proves that truth really is stranger than fiction.  Dali - despite his fame and fortune - faced the same vexing questions about life and the afterlife that are uniformly part of the human experience.  Within this backdrop Dali was contacted by the Blue Army to paint ""The Vision of Hell"".  Before he took this commission, Dali met with one of the original shepherd children of Fatima - Sister Lucia.  After his visit with Sister Lucia, Dali's life took a dramatic turn that few outside of his inner circle were aware of.  Paul Perry does a fantastic job of narrating the tale of Dali's search for truth and his secret life - all while incorporating history surrounding the Blue Army, the Fatima Story and wonderful footage of Dali, the master himself.  If you are a fan of Dali, a believer in the Fatima visions or simply curious about the profound impact that a meeting with a cloistered nun had on Dali, this documentary is for you.  5-stars.",1416960000,7,1011,4.646067415730337
