8629334,5,B00H2Z7VD0,"This is a wonderful concert, one of the best Neil Finn has been associated with. A great introduction to the songs of Paul Kelly, a long term Australian singer-songwriter icon. Both men with melodic songs that play together wonderfully.
A great reason to invest in a universal DVD player as this will not play on region 1 players. BTW, the CD version has a great Paul Kelly song not on the DVD version. The 5.1 mix is very good also.
If you are a Neil Finn fan, then this comes highly recommended.",1414800000,2,497,4.413043478260869

8629336,1,B00H2Z7VD0,"When it comes to standardizing video playback equipment, can't we all just get along? I even took the extra step of contacting Amazon customer service prior to purchasing, believing that there's no way this Aussie production would be coded to play on my BluRay. (It's even described as coded for All Regions!) I was assured I could play it. Wrong. It was in my possession for about 5 minutes before it was repackaged and sent back to Amazon. Frustrating and disappointing.",1398384000,2,472,4.839506172839506
8629337,1,B00H2Z7VD0,"The label and the Amazon advertising for this disc both say all regions playable, Region 0.

This disc is coded Region 4 despite what it says on the label.",1393027200,3,155,4.344827586206897
