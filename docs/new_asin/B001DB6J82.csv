3528105,5,B001DB6J82,"A first-rate flick! Fabulous story, powerful interplay between the six leads, intriguing mode of unfolding coincidental parallel and near parallel paths. All the more tellingly resonant for me having recently travelled from Istanbul through Trabazon(where the film concludes)amd like the grieving German mum, had been in the place 30 years before. Of course, the soundtrack grabs by the chest fibres and cools them after they've been rent by the tragedy we witness. Wonderful moment of awakened compassion from the aforesaid mum, in Istanbul when she opens her heart to the younger Turkish woman. Reconciliation of the deepest kind is possible. This is real and painful and lovingly conveyed. A must see.",1219017600,5,704,5.351351351351352

The movie submerges you into the story line right after the first scene. being that it is a foreign movie, you do not quite no what to expect. as you watch, you figure typical story line , this is probably going to be a slow touchy-feely movie, with maybe sweet ending. But it completely takes you out of your comfort zone and into a story that you would of never imagined, much less with a story line like this.

The crisscrossing coincidences of proximity that take place in the background, and are recognizable only to the viewer rather than the characters, represent the alienation and isolation found in modern and technologically advanced societies.

At the end, we see the simplicity of life.

Great acting, great drama and shocking unexpected moments. Love the very quiet and beautiful scene at the end that is basically one long still shot that gives the audience time to reflect and reel back from the emotion this film creates. This scene thankfully depicts a positive ending, of sorts, in a film that does have a lot of tragedy.

Just be prepared for a very powerful movie. Kind of like the feeling you get after watching movies like 'The Killing Fields' or 'Shooting Dogs'. Conequently give yourself the time and space to watch this without being disturbed and certainly in one go, to really appreciate it. I wouldn't recommend this to those that can't deal with tragedy and loss but for all those that feel a sense of appreciation for telling such a story, enjoy!!",1356825600,5,997,4.659090909090909
3528131,2,B001DB6J82,"Every now and then I like to take a chance and watch a foreign film - occasionally it pays off and I get to see a decent movie (like ""Bread and Tulips"" or ""Mother of Mine""), but more often than not they are a waste of time.  As for the great cinematography others commented about - ""where?"" This was all mostly filmed in small cramped rooms. There was no great scenery to enjoy...perhaps the sea shot at the end...

This was a pointless story (was there a plot/point to it??) and it was not entertaining or particularly interesting.  It was also somewhat confusing because it seemed like they bounced from current time to past and back but in a way you wouldn't notice except that the person you're seeing now died a ways back in the movie - but it was done in a really confusing way.  Turns out at the end of the movie you were confused for nothing because the entire movie was a waste of time.

The Story:
Horny old man talks hooker into living with him and he'll pay her what she usually makes in a month but she's to do only him. Old guy has a not-horny son who is a young college professor. Hooker tells this son that she has a 27-yr old daughter in college (who thinks her mom works in a shoe store) but she hasn't been able to find her daughter in awhile. Later, old guy gets sloshed and gets sexually demanding with hooker (he's bought her so he should get what he wants when he wants it...) she tells him no and starts gathering her stuff to leave, he hits her once and manages to kill her. He goes to prison for murder. The son then feels obligated to find hookers daughter and take responsibility for paying for her education. Turns out the daughter is some kind of revolution person on the lamb into another country. There she meets a blonde girl who invites her home and they become ""involved"". The hookers daughter gets sent back to her country to jail, the blonde follows her to try to be of help. While there the blonde rents a room from the old guys son (who now owns a bookstore), and soon gets killed on the street by some little boys her stole her purse.  Blonde girls mom then comes and meets son and stays with him while she tries to help hookers daughter.  The old guys son doesn't seem to ever find hookers daughter, but decides to forgive his dad for being a murderer. -- End of movie.

3528132,4,B001DB6J82,"There are a lot of films nowadays that use this fragmented interwoven storytelling structure.  Some of those films really work, and others fall flat thanks to misapplied similarities and lack of depth in character development.  `The Edge of Heaven' is compelling and affecting despite moments that seem too preposterous for their own good.  Fatih Akin knows how to wrap this story around itself in a way that builds depth in areas that feel somewhat shallow.

In other words, this is an example of a film working and then again, not working in nearly the same breath.

The film tells three separate stories.  One is of a man who is desperately trying to right the wrongs of his father, an elderly drunk who manhandles and accidentally kills a prostitute he tried to pull out of the gutter.  Ashamed of his father's actions, this man goes out on a journey to find this dead prostitutes daughter.  The second story is of that daughter, a political rebel who manages to escape Germany and is trying to find her mother when she meets and falls into a relationship with the nave Lotte.  Lotte's mother is not happy about this relationship, and she propels the final story, that of a woman attempting to pick up broken pieces of tragedy.

All three of these lives collide in different ways, and yet no one knows of the importance of their union.  I found the construction of the film to be a little convoluted in parts and a tad choppy in others, and yet I have a ton of respect for the approach taken to the film's conclusion and mostly that third `story', which is fleshed out beautifully in a few small moments.  Overall, `The Edge of Heaven' is sincere enough to work, despite scenario flaws, but the film's opening story feels a bit forced when placed up against the second and third, and the lack of balance when portraying the amount of tragedy in one particular `circle' seemed off kilter at times.  It just seems to be trying to say something a little harder than it should.

And yet that final moment on the beach seems like such a marvelous way to conclude such a grisly tale.",1337904000,2,2081,4.589189189189189

3528140,4,B001DB6J82,"On an online message board about this movie, I found a thread headed by the question, ""Am I the only one who thinks this movie sucks?"" I almost answered it before I finished watching the movie, but I decided to wait it out and see if it improved, and it did.

My problem wasn't with the slow, lyrical pace of the movie (I actually loved that), the numerous gut-wrenching near-misses, the section titles that gave away key plot points before they happened, or all the loose ends and questions left unanswered when the credits rolled. I like movies that don't follow the Hollywood blockbuster formula, and the farther they depart from the formula the better I usually like them. But I pretty much have to care about somebody in a movie to care about the movie, and I just didn't care about a single one of these characters until very near the end.

With very few exceptions, my enjoyment of any movie depends on how deeply I get involved with the characters in it, and I just wasn't getting involved with these. The old man and both young women were so shallow, selfish, and stupid that all I wanted was never to have to see any of them again, and that didn't change at all in the course of the movie. To me, they were just three obnoxious, uninteresting losers who never learned from their mistakes. (A selfish, mean-spirited old man crying does not fill me with sympathy. It reminds me too much of somebody I know.)

The young man and the prostitute were a little better than the other three, only because they weren't selfish and obnoxious; but they were nearly as shallow, not much realer to me as human beings than the others were. I didn't dislike them, but I didn't care much about them either.

So, around 20 minutes from the end, when the old man pulled his put-the-book-down-slowly-and-weep-into-the-camera shtick, I was ready to write on that message board, ""You're right--this movie sucks!"" But immediately after that, Hanna Schygulla (I'd forgotten she even existed) rose slowly and gracefully out of the muck and brought a flesh-and-blood human being to life in this movie at last.

Her radiant but deeply grounded performance almost made the whole movie worthwhile, made even some of the other characters seem not so bad after all. Once her character fully appeared, even her welcoming the still-obnoxious Ayten into her life didn't ruin it for me, nor did her prompting Nejat to run off pathetically after his self-pitying jerk of a father. Hanna Schygulla saved this movie from tedium and transformed it into something worth watching--all by herself.

For her performance, and for the beautifully poetic pace of this movie, I give it several more stars than I would have if I'd stopped watching it 20 minutes before the end.",1247356800,,2739,4.743697478991597
3528141,4,B001DB6J82,"The writer/director (and sometimes actor) Fatih Akin again mines the depths of the complex and intense interrelationship between the peoples of Germany and Turkey.  Akin's previous film -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Head-On-Gegen-die-Wand/dp/B0009VND0E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Head-On [Gegen die Wand</a>] - was a masterpiece.  It won the European Film Award (2004) and swept the German Film awards for best film, actress, actor, direction and cinematography.  It's easily one of the top five movies on my list.  So, Akin set the bar very, very high for himself.  'Edge of Heaven' doesn't quite reach those heights, but is impressive and memorable nevertheless.

The film is constructed as a circular arc of near-misses, split-second tragedies and new beginnings as the characters move back and forth - sometimes legally, sometimes furtively - between Germany and Turkey.  I was especially wowed by Akin's simple filming of two caskets: one being unloaded on a plane landing in Turkey just landed from Germany; and, subsequently, one being unloaded on a plane in Germany just landed from Turkey.  In each case, the piece is wordless, but speaks volumes to the personal tragedy that has befallen one of the protagonists.",1243641600,,1269,5.821621621621621

First of all, I love foreign films, but at first I wondered about this movie. It wasn't long, however, before I was hooked and had to watch it to the end. There were so many tangled vines of a relationship of a son and father, another of a daughter and mother, and then these relationships begin to intersect.

The story takes place in Germany and Turkey. A young Turkish woman is arrested as a member of a terrorist organization, and that pulls a young German woman into this convoluted tale. The woman hides a gun, and when it is found, an unintentional killing occurs.

I don't want to reveal too much. The story weaves along right to the end, leaving you with a sense that everything will be okay.

Making symmetry of form out of seemingly random events, the Turkish-German co-production entitled ""The Edge of Heaven"" is a complex and beautifully realized human drama built on a series of carefully worked-out interlocking coincidences and parallel events.  The movie, written and directed by Fatih Akin, begins when an old Turkish man living in Germany accidental kills a prostitute he has paid to come and live with him.  As a means of atonement, the man's guilt-ridden son, a language professor at a German university, journeys to Istanbul to find the woman's daughter and offer her assistance in financing her college education.  Unbeknownst to him, the daughter is a member of a ""radical"" political group that the Turkish government has decreed to be a terrorist organization.  The plot becomes increasingly complicated as it continually wanders off onto unexpected pathways, introducing new and fascinating characters at each turn, and finally coming full circle around on itself at the end.  Suffice it to say, there are two unexpected murders, two sets of mothers and daughters, three pairs of parents and children, and two young ladies of a more than kindred spirit that become part of the finely woven tapestry of this film.

One of the primary virtues of ""The Edge of Heaven"" is that it doesn't feel compelled to follow any kind of standard storytelling arc just to please its audience.  It spends a certain amount of time with one set of characters, then moves on to another set, not concerned if we don't get all the connections right off the bat.  Major characters become minor ones, and minor ones major as the movie advances through its storyline.  Yet, perhaps that is a misleading way of putting it, for, in this movie, no one can ever be a truly ""minor"" player - for the film is based on the premise that even the most seemingly random, inconsequential event can set off a chain reaction of future events, all leading to major, sometimes devastating and certainly unforeseeable consequences for the people involved.  This lack of a conventional narrative purges the movie of contrivance, even when the characters keep crossing paths with one another in ways that would normally place a strain on our credulity.  Here, however, thanks to the naturalism in both the performances and the direction, this small-world pattern feels ever so right.

Filled with beautiful, heartfelt performances, ""The Edge of Heaven"" presents its tale of forgiveness, redemption and reconciliation in a form that is wholly unique and quietly spellbinding.  As with a beautiful pointillist painting, the movie reveals its full picture only after we have stood far enough back from it to be able to view it in its entirety.  And what a beautiful picture it turns out to be.",1232755200,8,2777,5.032751091703057
3528155,5,B001DB6J82,this is an astonishing work of art. What's it about?  You have to see it to say what it is about for you.  It's about life in short and in large terms.,1231718400,,151,3.6875
3528156,5,B001DB6J82,"Instead of a clunky description of the story, here are two examples of masterful filmmaking from this amazing film.

Example #1: The iconic German actress Hanna Schygulla plays the aged mother of one of the main characters. Her daughter, a German university student with an idealistic streak, brings a Turkish woman whom she has just met, to stay in their house. The daughter wants to help the Turkish woman, who is homeless and an illegal immigrant. The mother seems to project quiet disapproval and warns the daughter about harboring an illegal alien. In this manner, the film makes the viewer think he or she is seeing a contrast between the staid mother and the bohemian rebellious daughter.

Later, however, the film reveals that this staid mother is not who the viewer has come to think she is. In her youth, she was also a free spirit and a bit of a bohemian who hitchhiked to India. She shows herself to be someone so different than who she seemed to be.

Thus, the viewer's very perception is challenged and this character is revealed to be complex and truly human and not the ""type"" that the viewer has pegged her to be. In other words, the film challenges and undermines the viewers' perception to provide true insight.

Example #2: The opening scene of the film is of a car driving into a gas station in rural Turkey. A man gets out of the car, asks the gas station attendant to fill it up, then goes inside to the little convenience store, where he buys some snacks and exchanges small talk with the shopkeeper about a song that is playing on the radio. The shopkeeper says the singer is from the region but died of cancer due to fallout from Chernobyl that's only revealing itself to the public now. The man pays for his stuff and the scene ends. It's a two-minute scene. No tension. No conflict. No nothing. Completely mundane. Something that could happen to anyone.

Ninety-minutes of the film later, the same scene is replayed in exactly the same form. No changes. But the film has revealed the events that have led up to this man's setting foot in that gas station. It's the same scene. The same two minutes. But now, it's filled with tension, true pathos, and an abundance of meaning.

Again, this is an example where the film shows us something, makes us think we see it, only to reveal that what we think we're seeing is not so. It challenges the expectations and perception of the viewer. It makes us see with new eyes.",1229472000,41,2441,4.574370709382151
3528157,4,B001DB6J82,"Faith Akin's latest film tells the overlapping stories of six individuals whose lives are caught between Turkey and Germany.  A father's careless act sends his son back to their Turkish homeland on a quest for restitution.  A daughter's involvement in an anti-government protest that leads to violence forces her to leave her home and search for her estranged mother in Germany.  A young German woman's fierce loyalty to her Turkish lover puts her in harm's way.  A German mother travels to Turkey in search of a lost daughter.

Each central character is in many ways unsympathetic, and certainly none of them would want or require anyone's pity, yet somehow in the course of the film all had won my profound sympathy and concern.  What is remarkable about the film is that the unexpected and unpredictable ways in which their lives connect are depicted in such compelling fashion as to make them feel utterly plausible and profound.

This is a delicate film, more profound and yet more subtle than Akin's previous&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Head-On-Gegen-die-Wand/dp/B0009VND0E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Head-On [Gegen die Wand</a>] which was much more intense (and quite amazing), yet did not move me as strongly as this one.

I would hate to spoil the many delights of this film by saying much more, but I cannot say enough about how delightful this film really is.  Highly recommended for the right kind of viewer.  (in Turkish and German w/ English subtitles available)",1227830400,3,1523,5.3881856540084385

3528159,4,B001DB6J82,"The Edge of Heaven, to give you it's correct title, is a film that has received a lot of attention from worldwide film buffs. What you have here is a film that explores identity in a world in which realisations come much too late but, God willing, come.

There are several characters in the film whose stories interconnect and whose lives directly or indirectly affect one another's. The German professor, his father, his father's girlfriend, his father's girlfriend's daughter, his father's girlfriend's daughter's girlfriend...you see where this is going, a domino-like effect in narration which builds up throughout the film.

The Edge of Heaven does not attempt to bash you over the head with its meaning. It takes its time to show you, to move you, and its cinematography is never anything less than beautiful. The actors do a good job (although the Turkish girl is slightly grating) and my personal favourite is the old man: bitter, independent and very much alive.

Comes highly recommended.",1225929600,6,998,5.036363636363636
3528160,5,B001DB6J82,"THE EDGE OF HEAVEN (AUF DER ANDEREN SEITE) is a superb piece of writing by writer/director Fatih Akin - a study essentially about family fragility and strength as heightened by the immigrant struggles that both bond and divide.  It is an intelligent film, well acted, and presented in a challenging manner that defines it as an art film of the first order.

We are given three families to inspect, families whose paths cross not only by coincidence by also by a common 'border' between Germany and Turkey - a division that provides not only tension and emphasis in separation and communication flaws in relationships, but also allows the sensitive cinematographer the opportunity to contrast the dark German portions with the hot light of the Turkish segments.

The film opens innocently enough with a scene where young professor Nejat (Baki Davrak), a Turkish immigrant teaching in Germany, stops for gas - an ordinary event in life that will be recapitulated at movie's close.  Nejat's elderly father  Ali Aksu (Yuncel Kurtiz) wanders the red light district and encounters a Turkish immigrant hooker Yeter (Nusel Kose) whom he invites to come live with him for the same money that she would make in prostitution.  The home setting (Nejat, Ali, Yeter) is flawed and at the moment of dissolution Yeter dies accidentally during an altercation with Ali.  Ali is jailed and Nejat feels compelled to go to Istanbul to find and assist Yeter's daughter.  Meanwhile Yeter's daughter Ayten (Nurgut Yesilcay) is participating in anti government demonstrations and manages to flee to Germany to find her mother and is befriended by Lotte (Patrycia Ziokowska), a student whose mother Susanne (Hanna Schygulla) disapproves of Lotte's relationship with Ayten. Ayten is forced to flee to Istanbul, Lotte follows and tragedy occurs.  In a manner of twists and turns and fast-forwards and reflective moments the three families (Nejat/Ali, Yeter/Ayten, and Susanne/Lotte) intersect, always propelled by the need for acceptance and love and succor.

The levels of interpretation are many and writer/director Fatih Akin serves them well.  The superb cinematography is in the masterful hands of Rainer Klausmann  and the musical score is enhanced by recordings of a late Turkish artist  as integrated by composer Shantel . This is a stunning, fast paced, emotionally involving film filled with pleas of understanding of many problems that daily call for our attention.  In Turkish, German an English with subtitles.

3528161,4,B001DB6J82,"""The Edge of Heaven"" is a literally cross-cultural story that hinges on crossed paths between its German and Turkish characters. Deft handling of complexity and coincidence won writer/director Fatih Akin a host of awards in Europe, including Best Screenplay at Cannes, Best Direction at the German Film Awards, and Best Foreign Film at France's Cesars. Ali Aksu (Tuncel Kurtiz), a retired Turkish immigrant in Germany, invites a prostitute named Yeter (Nusel Kose), also a Turkish immigrant, to live with him. Ali's college professor son Nejat (Baki Davrak) is surprised by the arrangement but fond of Yeter. When Yeter dies, Nejat visits Turkey to find her grown daughter Ayten (Nurgut Yesilcay) with the intention of paying for her education. But Ayten's radical political activity have already compelled her to leave Turkey to seek her mother in Germany.

The film's division into four parts, only the last of which is entirely chronological, creates an interesting symmetry. The two central parts address Ali and Yeter's relationship and Ayten's relationship with a sympathetic German university student named Lotte (Patrycia Ziokowska), respectively. Two couples. But the brief opening sequence feels superfluous, as if it has been added only to balance the end of the film. Apart from that, this oddly structured film seems natural even though it relies heavily on coincidences. Two generations cross paths as well as two cultures: What Ali, Yeter, and Lotte's mother Susanne (Hanna Schygulla) want for their children is slyly compared to what Nejat, Ayten, and Lotte want for themselves. ""Edge of Heaven"" feels like a carefully crafted European character drama with a welcome helping of grit. In German, Turkish, and English with subtitles.

The DVD (Strand Releasing 2008): Bonus  features are a theatrical trailer (1 1/2 min) and a documentary entitled ""The Making of The Edge of Heaven"" (56 min), which is too long but includes behind-the-scenes footage and interviews with director Fatih Akin. He discusses story, themes, cast, the script, rehearsing, and directing the film. The cast makes some brief appearances. The documentary is in German with English subtitles.

3528162,5,B001DB6J82,"""The Edge of Heaven"" Fatih Akin, 2007

[Note: this review includes a fairly detailed description of the film's plot.  I have tried to avoid the critical 'surprise' moments, but if you want to approach the film tabula rasa, read only the first few paragraphs, and maybe the last.]

I find it hard to explicate just what it is I like so much about the films of Fatih Akin, but the two I've seen (this one and 2004's ""Head-On"") are breathtaking works of great beauty and emotional impact, easily among the best films of any given year.  There is much to like in the films -- they are well lensed, the acting is excellent, they are neatly structured.  But then lots of films share those attributes without being lifted to the level where you tell friends ""you have to see this one"".  Dealing with Turkish immigrants to Germany, the cultural conflicts and the relation to the homeland, obviously relates to a pressing topic in the US, indeed the very story of the US, but not every immigrant flick hits you so in the gut.  So though I can't say exactly why, I do urge you ""see it.""  I saw it once in theatre, and eagerly await the DVD.

""Head-On"" dealt with the explosive relationship of two rather extreme characters (they meet as clients in a mental health institute, for starters), and was definitely intense and edgy.  ""The Edge of Heaven,"" by contrast, features pretty ordinary seeming people, three parent/child pairs, and is precisely, almost coldly, fitted together in a way that makes the plot seem mundane, even though it deals with violent death, prison and revolution.

""The Edge of Heaven"" begins with a framing scene which resonates with the final scenes of ""Head-On"", where Cahit takes a bus to his home town in Turkey.  Here, a young man, Nejat, is driving on a country road in Turkey, and stops at a gas station, where he purchases gas and snacks, and discusses the music playing, which he has not heard before.  All very simple, very ordinary. This time stream will be rejoined near the end of the film.

Then we start the first of three titled sections, ""Yeter's Death"".  (Talk about spoilers!  But perhaps this is the director's way of saying we should be looking beyond, beneath, the details of plot.)

Nejat's father Ali is in Bremen, wandering through the red light district in the afternoon, where he chooses a woman and enters her apartment.  As he is leaving, something she says makes him realize she also is Turkish.  Ali keeps coming back, and eventually makes a proposition: that Yeter should come live with him and he'll replace her earnings.  She demurs, but when threatened by some Turkish street thugs -- nationalists or fundamentalists who don't like a countrywoman in her profession -- she moves in with Ali.  Nejat comes to visit, surprised but guardedly pleased to find his father has a girlfriend.  Yeter's one major regret in life is separation from her daughter Ayten, still in Turkey, who thinks she is working in a German shoe store.  Nejat returns to Hamburg, where we follow his life as a professor of (European) literature, including a lecture where a young woman is asleep at a desk.  Yeter dies (I won't spoilerize just how), and Nejat breaks relations with his father and goes to Istanbul to locate Ayten, with only her name and a picture of her mother.  Getting no response to the flyers her puts up, and stonewalled by the police, he buys a German bookstore and settles into Istanbul.

""Lotte's Death""

Now we follow the story of Ayten, young, sturdy, athletic and aggressive.  Eventually it becomes clear that we have gone back in time and are roughly paralleling the first section.  A masked figure in an anti-government demonstration, Ayten picks up a loose gun and flees.  She escapes and stashes the gun on a rooftop, then flees to Germany to look for Yeter.  With no luck at finding her mother in shoe stores,  Ayten winds up broke and hungry, hanging around the university where Nejat teaches.  She takes a nap in his lecture (reprising the scene mentioned above), then approaches a young German woman, Lotte, for money to buy a meal .. instead, Lotte eats with her, and then invites ""Gul"", as she is calling herself, to stay at her mother Susanne's.  Gul settles in, seemingly some time passes and the relation with Lotte grows, but eventually she is deported due to easing relations with Turkey.  Lotte is distraught and pursues her to Istanbul over the objections of Susanne.  Looking for cheap lodging while she waits to see Gul/Ayten in prison, she sees a notice in Nejat's store, and takes a room with him.  Ironically, the flyer Nejat has posted seeking information on Ayten means nothing to her, since it has only a picture of Yeter.  She finally sees Gul, who has been networking with fellow revolutionaries in the clink and asks Lotte to do a favor for her on the outside.

""The Edge of Heaven"" [More literal translation, ""On the Other Side""]

In this act, the threads are brought together, both cinematically and emotionally.  Susanne comes to Istanbul to claim Lotte's body, but stays to help Ayten, who is shaken to the core by her complicity in Lotte's death.  Ali comes to Turkey, but Nejat refuses to see him and he returns to his home village on the sea.  Eventually, inspired by the reconciliation of Susanne and Ayten, Nejat sets out after Ali.  The final scene, with credits rolling as Nejat sits on the beach, is both simple and powerful, with everything left to our imagination.  Through tragedy, the characters have each truly come through to the other side, either of death or broken relations.",1219190400,3,5570,4.732365145228216
3528163,5,B001DB6J82,"The emotional impact of this bleak cinema will not need enhancement, and the ""story"" is intentionally predictable from about minute 15 to the end. What I want to address is the ""intellectual"" content, since I think this is a film with fairly explicit intellectual aspirations -- in other words, a movie that makes a statement about life.

Coincidental relationships and chance encounters frame nearly every action/event of this film. Nothing that happens is inevitable or dramatically ""necessary"", yet everything is contingent on random intersections of people and places that another film-maker might perceive as fateful or predestined. Yet equally possible coincidences and indeed encounters that ""we"" are set up to expect don't occur as expected. Coincidence is no more powerful than non-coincidence; contingency is awkwardly random in the film-maker's vision of life, and resolution is utterly illusory. Perhaps only a Turk, or another person raised in a culture of religious predeterminism, could offer such insights into the linear inconsequentiality of existence -- ""just one d_mn thing after another.""

The Edge of Heaven is also a painful depiction of alienation -- the alienation of 'guestworker"" Turks in Germany, of political dissidence, and of generational conflict, a father-son and a mother-daughter, the former Turks and the latter Germans. This isn't the core of the movie so much as the substrate in which the character development takes place.

Wonderful acting! Especially from Hanna Schygulla, who plays the German mother so plausibly that you will hardly remember her as the star of German ""art"" films of yesteryear. Any time an actor/actress is unrecognizable, that's art!

Definitely a movie that you will leave feeling less ebullient than when you arrived; the reward is emotional insight rather than entertainment. It reminded me a good deal of Babel, though it's more modest and perhaps more real. If you appreciated Babel, you will surely relish Edge of Heaven.",1219104000,35,1989,5.406451612903226

The parallel story is that of a young professor whose father accidentally murders the mother of the Turkish girl. This character, played by Baki Davrak, is the the most sympathetic, and he crosses paths with all the others.

Tragically, throughout the story the Turkish mother, a prostitute, is doing everything in her power to find her daughter, and the daughter is looking desperately for her mother. They never meet.

Tuncel Kurtz (Maria Braun) plays the german girl's mother.

8292583,5,B001DB6J82,"Faith Arkin develops an absorbing film, building a dramatic chain of events that link six lives.

The movie centers around two cities Bremen and Istanbul, the crude portrait of Turkish inmigration ( Fassbinder had paid tribute in his memorable film Ali: Fear eats the soul)and the way each one of these human beings play hard for what they consider their goal in this puzzled multi-cultural universe of ideologies and ways of living.

Hanna Shygulla - the most relevant iconic actress of Fassbinder (in a small role) ignites the screen an captivates the audience through the second half of the film.

The agile script, well handled direction and fabulous cast make of this story a motive of serious reflection about what is right and what is wrong in this unsuspected web of facts.
