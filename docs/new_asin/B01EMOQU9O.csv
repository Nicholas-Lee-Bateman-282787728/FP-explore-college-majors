8759207,5,B01EMOQU9O,"great example of a 1940's style period film with fantastic surprises, frightening monsters, diabolical villains, and inspiring heroes.  Lots of fun to be had for the whole family, and just an all around good time watching Professor Jack plot his course through the challenges the universe has in store for our hero.",1532390400,,315,5.0576923076923075
8759208,3,B01EMOQU9O,Has to be the worse acting I've ever seen and the sets and cinematography was awful.  The storyline was fairly decent if they had of had decent actors to go along with it. Three stars are for the storyline only.,1468281600,,211,4.275
