8188043,5,B000P0LFUY,"Dragon ""is a very clever dragon"" and silly.  He is enthusiastic and isn't afraid to try new things.  He has amusing adventures with deductive logic and reasoning as when he justifies sampling one of the cookies he made for his friends and bit by bit thinks himself into eating all of them.

The Claymation style of animation is gentle but still maintains interest.  The colors are bold and bright but not assulting as many current animations seem to be.  I have never worried even for a moment that something about the presentation of the program or the stories it tells might be in anyway harmful to my children.

My son started watching this around age 3 and still loves it at 7.  He says he likes it because Dragon is clever.  Now his little sister, age 4, loves it too.  She says she likes it because he is blue.  We all enjoy watching this show, even my husband.

We only wish more episodes were available on DVD.",1343088000,,918,4.437125748502994
