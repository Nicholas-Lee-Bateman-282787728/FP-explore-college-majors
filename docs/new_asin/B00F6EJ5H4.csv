5968238,4,B00F6EJ5H4,"Campy, funny and enjoyable.  Beyond absurd but very well executed.  It does, however illustrate how parts of the world, in this case rural Philippines, have an enlightened, but 1970s view of gays.",1444262400,,196,5.09375
5968239,5,B00F6EJ5H4,"If you are familiar with Filipino films, and you like them with all their crazy idiosyncrasies, this is a movie you'll probably enjoy.  We certainly did.  If you want to become familiar with Filipino films, this is a great film to start with.

The acting is quite good, especially the lead, Martin Escudero.  What a well played trasition!

If this is your first Filipino film, please keep an open mind and remember, these films place less importance on linear story lines and add extra doses of goofy romantic ideas, maudlin sentimentality and fierce tests of loyalty.  That doesn't mean that the plot and production are simple or primitive.  You can expect some very novel and innovative content mixed in with the rest.  Seemingly minor events can bring on major changes to the story so you do need to pay attention so as not to get lost.

This movie, Remington and the Curse of the Zombadings is well produced, the characters are charming and interesting, the story is a lot of fun.  I hope you'll enjoy it as much as we did.",1440374400,3,1027,4.624309392265193
5968240,5,B00F6EJ5H4,"I was hoping I'd enjoy this, and was surprised that I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would.  Fun movie with some great performances.  Not as PC as it could be in places, but it's heart is in the right place.  I think what struck me the most is how likable the characters are.  Not falling over laughing funny, but will put a smile on your face.",1410566400,,352,3.9857142857142858
5968241,5,B00F6EJ5H4,"This film is so far out of left field that it is wonderful. Could of used more Zombadings... but it was a good morality play, cutely acted, campy and fun. Be yourself, accept others for what they choose to be! Taught me a lesson or two about the evils of ""gaydar"" guns and the wonders of ""Baklese"" the local gay slang. Spoiler Alert! Everyone has a happy ending (except the bad guy of course!) Watch this after a few Saturday night libations and you won't regret it!",1409616000,,466,4.367816091954023
5968242,5,B00F6EJ5H4,"FINALLY with English subtitles! Yes! I saw Zombadings in a film festival about 2 years ago and adored its absurd, campy, yet somehow gentle humor. The director was present for Q and A after the screening, and despite the often over the top goofiness of the film, it was clear that this film was still created with thoughtfulness and sensitivity.

True, there aren't too many other Filipino zombie drag queen horror comedies to compare it to, but I'm confident in proclaiming Zombadings to be the best in its genre that I'll ever see. Ordered the previous DVD version only to be sorely disappointed to find it lacked English subtitles (still watched it numerous times anyway). Thrilled to now be able to share this with friends.",1397433600,,727,4.816
5968243,4,B00F6EJ5H4,"When Remington was six years old, he innocently taunted a feminine man as Homo, and the man responded by putting a curse on him, saying he would turn gay when he became an adult.  Fast forward fifteen years, and the young man experiences some strange visions which are followed by a change in his preferences in clothes, music, behavior and  ultimately  a crush on his best friend.  And this comes at a time when a serial killer is on the loose, using a gaydar gun that turns its victims into drag queens before killing them. Before he becomes a victim, Remington tries to find a way to reverse his curse, just the risen drag queen zombies terrorize the town!  Oh, my!

Deliciously over-the-top and campy, this 2011 hit comedy from the Philippines is actually quite gay-positive in its message of self-acceptance and mutual tolerance, while poking fun at small-town homophobia.  As Remington, young Martin Escudero shows flawless comedic range, and you believe his apparent amazement that he is suddenly uncontrollably swinging his hips as he walks.  The rest of the cast seems somewhat wooden, especially the local police (which is led by Remingtons mother, a nice touch.)  Good photography and direction, though the special effects are laughable in this low-budget indie.  Interestingly, it is double subtitled, in English for the Tagalog that makes up most of the film, but also in Tagalog and English for the dialogue in Baklese, which is apparently local gay slang.  No extras on DVD.  Probably not for everyone, but I liked it, and give it four stars out of five.",1385856000,2,1569,4.879245283018868

8612666,5,B00F6EJ5H4,"Ok I went 5 stars - for what it is I think they did an excellent job! This is a Filipino movie, so there are subtitles and as a foreign film it might be a little unusual for some, but I really hope this movie is not overlooked. Yes it's silly, very campy and a bit preachy, but I must say it was laugh out loud for me a few times (and that is a rare occasion). It won't me for everyone, but if you're looking for gay, campy, zombie movie this has it all ..",1503792000,,456,3.7604166666666665
