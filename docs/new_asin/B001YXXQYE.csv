3830112,3,B001YXXQYE,once more another one that is not uncut but it is edited even though it makes up for it with extra scenes then the tv broadcast it would have been better uncut.,1249430400,,160,4.03125
3830113,5,B001YXXQYE,"""Second verse, same as the first!""

Yes, it's the return of the ""Robot Chicken: Star Wars""! It's full of thrill, spills, chills, and maybe a little bit of love. (aw)

SEE: AT-AT races on Hoth!

SEE: A stormtrooper's version of Take Your Daughter to Work Day!

SEE: Jar Jar Binks pitching insurance!

SEE: Boba Fett being a total jerk!

SEE: The Emperor getting a haircut!

NOW with extra footage not seen on TV!

SEE: The notorious Q-wing!

SEE: Yoda and Obi-Wan's long-lost musical number!

SEE: The Endor holocaust brought to life on your screen!

SEE: Dengar's customized spaceship!

In every way surpassing the original ""Robot Chicken: Star Wars"", this one brings you everything you've come to expect from one of the most hilarious and bizarre programs on TV! Yes, it's the kind of hyperbolic insanity you can find only here, on this DVD! Well, and on [Adult Swim].

In addition to the program itself, there's a whole raft of extra features, including multiple commentary tracks, deleted scenes, trailers, bumps and oodles of other nonsense!

It's one heck of a show, and only someone with a midicolorian count in the negative numbers would... would...

Ah, hell, I can't keep this up. It's a good disc. If you liked the first, you'll like this. Buy and enjoy! I certainly did. :)",1248393600,22,1284,4.799086757990867
3830114,5,B001YXXQYE,"Man, when I saw Seth on Conan pimping the DVD, I got all excited for this new second installment of Star Wars by Robot Chicken. But when I started watching it, I felt oddly familiar with most of the material and in the shower the next morning [I do most of my serious thinking in the shower]is where I remembered why. Most of the material on this DVD aired November 16th 2008; and thanks to my tivo, I watched this episode like forty times.

Don't get me wrong, every skit is hilarious and Breckin Meyer as Boba Fett is freakin' awesome. And the good news is; there IS more footage available, both in the skits and in the behind the scenes. This DVD is way bigger than the first one [content wise, not in actual size, then it wouldn't fit in your player and that would be stupid.]

My favorite moments are what I will call, ""the many beards of Seth Green"" I think that alone would make a good coffee table book [i'd buy it]. Plus there is a great vignette on the premiere at Skywalker ranch that includes George Lucas and there is even an Easter egg.

And let me add, my 2 brothers are NOT true Star Wars fans because they won't buy this DVD. [bffttthh!]",1248307200,5,1154,4.260273972602739
3830115,4,B001YXXQYE,"You knew there'd just have to be more didn't you?  Seth Green's Adult Swim brainchild Robot Chicken tackles the monolith that is Star Wars for the second time with the aptly titled Robot Chicken: Star Wars-Episode II.  Like Episode I before it, Episode II basically functions as a double episode full of Star Wars-related gags, ranging from the Emperor going to get his hair done, Luke wondering what life with his father would be (with hilariously goofy results, and dancing), Lando discovering just how worse his deal with Darth Vader is getting by the minute, Jar Jar Binks pitching an add for Geico, and Boba Fett causing all sorts of chaos, including discovering just what became of him after flying to his doom in Return of the Jedi.  The best of the bunch however is the ultra-awkward dinner between Vader, Han Solo, Leia, Lando, and Boba Fett; which will keep you in stitches whether you are a die hard or casual Star Wars fan.  Green makes great use of guest voices again as well, including having Star Wars vets Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams, and Ahmed Best; along with Amy Smart, Rachel Leigh Cook, Conan O'Brien, Andy Richter, Donald Faison, and Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane among others.  Though the viewer will wish it never came to an end, Episode II is a brisk and enjoyable Robot Chicken-flavored blast that's hard not to enjoy, and whether or not you are a casual or die hard fan of either Star Wars or Robot Chicken, you can't help but enjoy what you find here.",1246147200,9,1490,4.67175572519084

3830117,5,B001YXXQYE,"I enjoy Robot Chicken greatly, but some of their skits can be too crass for some kinds of company.  I've never had that problem with their Star Wars spoofs, which have been greatly enjoyed by most of my houseguests.  I highly recommend both DVDs (1 and 2).",1378684800,,256,4.425531914893617

3830119,5,B001YXXQYE,"Hilarious! Tied with the third for my favorite, I just wish they'd make more of these, at least a fourth one for the upcoming Episode VII.. I've re-watched this one several times, and laughed almost as hard each time.",1371513600,,217,4.589743589743589

3830123,5,B001YXXQYE,"Great product, with hilarious scenes - definitely a 'must-buy' for all Star Wars fans....the film is just a collection of parodied clips/scenes...to appreciate this DVD, you must have seen Star Wars episodes 1 to 6 and know the characters by heart....",1327363200,,251,5.146341463414634
3830124,5,B001YXXQYE,this parody and spoof seriously is amazing from the very begining to the very end robot chicken = epic win!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1326844800,,144,6.25
3830125,1,B001YXXQYE,"No, No, No, No, No, NO. This is not what fans want. Each of these Robot Chicken Star Wars episodes are just that, 1 episode. The first one didn't even go for a full 30 minutes. The next two ran barely over 40. And the DVD's are then packed with the most useless bonus content you will ever see, that is, unless you are completely obsessed with Seth Green and the rest of the cast, and wish to actually watch a bunch of clips of them talking to a hand held camera as they dribble on about things no one ever needed know, or watch some pretty horrible audio or visual quality scenes.

What Robot Chicken needs to do, is get rid of all that bonus content that is not needed, and combine these 3 Star Wars episodes onto the one disc, and have a main feature that runs at least the length of a regular movie. But here, they keep the same crappy release, and give you both parts 1 and 2 in a box... BIG DEAL. It's still not worth purchasing, as these episodes should either, as I am saying, be combined with all 3 parts on the SINGLE disc, or add them to whatever season of RC they came from... it is ridicules how obvious this is to cash in and get some cheap extra bucks from fans. But after buying the first, and renting the next two, I will not buy these things until they are done right, and released together on one disc, so that I do not have to either change discs to watch these things, or end up burning my own custom made copy so I am not changing discs every half an hour... or not even that long.

Combine the 3, and you will have a purchase worthy of buying. This is just a rip-off doing it this way.",1321315200,,1608,4.069400630914826
3830126,5,B001YXXQYE,"Its robot chicken, what else is there to say. Really though it well made and very funny, but caution don't eat or drink anything while watching this. Unless you want to clean your drink of every thing or choke on food.",1320364800,,218,4.341463414634147

The voices used in the video are great - can't believe they got some of these people to contribute to the project. Try to guess who voices the different characters before reading who's in the video.

The cuss words have been bleaped out, but you can still tell what the words are, so I'm not sure this would be appropriate for younger viewers; I don't have any in my household, so you'll have to be the judge, if you know what I mean.

3830135,5,B001YXXQYE,"The real tricky thing about doing Star Wars spoofs is they have already been done to death and any new attempt to add to the canon will amost always be kicking a dead horse. But what's great about both Robot Chicken's take on Star Wars is that it never feels cheap or tired. I think the key to success is that they never dwell too long on each skit (for lack of a better word) as each one seems to last anywhere from 5 to a minute at the most.  I don't know if they will be able to find more motivation, but I hope they keep on making more, or at least move on to other movies.

But just for the record, my favorite scene in both these episodes is the take on Yoda and Luke going through Jedi training ala the scene in the Empire Strikes Back. For those who have seen it already, ""begging you I am, sick I will be.....""

Ha-ha. classic",1294876800,,835,4.018072289156627
3830136,5,B001YXXQYE,"...and when I previewed it after purchase I came to the conclusion that letting my boy watch this would be tantamount to child abuse.  Profane, really violent, and wickedly funny, ""Robot Chicken"" Star Wars is a treat for adult fans of the original trilogy.

Think sawed off limbs, plenty of F-bombs (and worse), and incest humor (Leia and Luke did have a lingering kiss), it's not for kids, and so the son was denied..  But Dad thought it was pretty funny.

Being a Star Wars fan & collector for nearly 30 years I did enjoy the DVD.

Most of the bits are funny.  Not knowing Robot Chicken, is this normal to have curse words cut out on DVD's?
That I did NOT like.  It's a DVD, SAY THE WORDS.

OK, the other thing I did NOT like about this.  Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia) & Bill Dee Williams (Lando) supplied their voices on the DVD.  OK, where?  In only 1 part where Princess Leia was used could you tell it was Carrie & for Lando it sounded like someone doing an imitation of him.  IN ALL PARTS WHERE THE PRINCESS LEIA & LANDO CHARACTERS WERE USED WITH LINES, CARRIE & BILLY DEE SHOULD HAVE BEEN USED FOR THE CHARACTERS THEY CREATED.

Some good extras on the DVD.",1250294400,,802,4.223684210526316
