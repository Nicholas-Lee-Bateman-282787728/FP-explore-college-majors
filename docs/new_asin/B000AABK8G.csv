8076888,5,B000AABK8G,"Get ready to set sail on the high seas with everyone's favorite pig-taile powerhouse - the strongest girl in the world - Pippi Longstocking. This DVD contains episodes from the animated Canadian series starring Astrid Lindgren's most remarkable child. You'll meet her father, the sea captain, in these delightful adventures.

This DVD is just like the ""Pippi's Adventures on the South Seas"" DVD from HBO Home Video, except this title has a forth episode episode that you can't find on the ""South Seas"" DVD. That episode, which I consider as a ""BONUS"" episode, is ""Pippi is Shipwrecked."" See synopsis for that episode and the three others below. Also on this DVD, you can choose to watch all four eps or select one from the four to watch.

Here's what happens in each episode:

Pippi Goes to the South Seas: It is winter in the little town where Pippi and her friends, Tommy and Annika, live. Her father, the sea captain, docks in to take her on a trip to the South Seas. With permission from their parents, Tommy and Annika join her. On board, Pippi teaches the Settergren's about life on the ship, how to be lookouts, and how to stand up against pirates. Along with the three children and the captain, Thunder Karlson and Bloom, the two thieves who are in search of something to steal, come aboard. Unfortunately, the tramps get very seasick and they end up falling overboard. And then, they end up drifting away in a lifeboat. Returning to Pippi and her friends on board, they finally arrive to an island in the South Seas called Curi-Curi Dut.

Pippi Meets Some Pearl Poachers: After arriving on Curi-Curi Dut Island, Pippi's father the captain leaves her, Tommy and Annika in charge of the island's pearls. At the beginning of this episode, we find Thunder Karlson and Bloom washed up on an uncharted island. When the poachers arrive on Curi-Curi Dut, Pippi takes them as tourests at first. All three children have to uses their smarts against the poachers to keep them from stealing the pearls from the island. But when it comes to using strength to outdo those poachers, you know who is ready. I couldn't even help but get astonished when Pippi throws a shark at such a great distance.

Pippi Goes Home: After their adventures on Curi-Curi Island, it's time for Pippi, Tommy, and Annika to go home. On their way home, they rescue Thunder Karlson and Bloom from the deserted island they they landed on in the previous episode. After setting sail for home, they run into many problems like a windless passage and a title wave. It was Pippi, of course, who got the ship out of the windless channel! But the title wave scene put me in

a state where I was like, ""Oh my god! what's next?!"" I was on the edge of my seat during that scene! They soon get washed up on an unknown land, but then discover they may have seen that land before. In this episode, I couldn't help getting awestruck at some of Pippi's antics. For example, when Pippi calls for Mr. Nilson in the beginning of this episode, you'll find that Pippi has a loud voice! She yells so loudly she causes the ground to shake and Tommy and Annika could do nothing but hold their ears! Sometimes I think Pippi doesn't know some of her own strengths.

Pippi is Shipwrecked: In this ""BONUS"" episode, Pippi tells Tommy and Annika about some shipwrecks she's been in when she was sailing. Tommy and Annika get so interested in Pippi's adventures that they all decide to go on a shipwreck adventure of their own. So, Pippi pulls an old boat out of the water, gives it some repairs, and they set sail to an island that is in the middle of a lake. I must say that Pippi is so clever at repairing things. After arriving on that little island and encountering a shipwreck, they begin exploring after sending a bottled letter in hopes of being rescued. This was my most favorite episode of all off this DVD.

There's one thing all four Pippi Longstocking adventures have in common, ADVENTURE! And there's one thing for sure about these episodes, you will never get seasick as you watch.

If you're wanting to find more Pippi adventure, I also recommend these DVD titles: Here Comes Pippi and Pippi Goes to the Fair. Be sure to read my reviews on those titles and please comment me on those reviews after watching all three DVD titles.",1165881600,8,4284,4.58954248366013
