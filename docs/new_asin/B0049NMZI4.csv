8419148,1,B0049NMZI4,"I received this video for free from Pull Ups a few years ago. There was a little flyer inside our package of diapers to send the flyer in and receive the DVD along with one sample of the product. This video is one loooooong advertisement for training pants. That's all. I can sum up the whole DVD in one sentence: ""Make sure you use Pull-UpsTM training pants in your potty training program to ensure potty training success."" I didn't find any helpful tips on this video, which is exclusively for parents. I'm glad I got it for free (well, for the price of a stamp to send in the flyer). It was actually a bit comical to watch and would best be used as a drinking game for tired parents of toddlers and pre-schoolers; a just reward after a day of hearing ""no,"" ""I do it myself,"" and ""why?"" One shot or swig every time they say Pull-UpsTM or training pants. You're welcome. ;)",1428969600,2,874,4.335365853658536
8419149,1,B0049NMZI4,"This DVD is designed to teach parents how to toilet train their children. Of course, this company has a vested interest in making that process as long and drawn out as possible, so they can sell more Pull-Ups. There is really nothing of value here, other than a couple of songs to teach your kids which can be replaced by numerous other ideas on the internet. A much better resource for parents would be Potty Training 1 2 3 by Ezzo. I know many people disagree with his baby advice, but his toilet training advice is spot on.",1355702400,2,526,4.377551020408164
8419150,2,B0049NMZI4,This is a potty video for parents not for kids. It is okay but not great! Narrator is a cheer leader with lots of promotion for Pull Ups. I bought it for 4.00 including shipping so it was worth looking at. I'll pass this one on to another mother.,1349308800,3,246,4.040816326530612
