5673328,5,B00BTYXNRI,"Love it. Wish the story got into more detail about what happened to the kids and the evil guy, I found a cool short story written online that someone randomly wrote to give more background and it was awesome. It is always a dissapointment when a movie like this has such a good premise but they never really give you as much creepy detail as you wanted. Like throw in a few more hidden passageways scenes, throw in more details about what happened to the kids and it would have been 10x better. good for a casual viewing. Actors and acting was spot on.",1394928000,2,552,4.3173076923076925
5673329,5,B00BTYXNRI,"I had this movie originally on VHS, and have been waiting for its release on DVD!
My favorite thing about this movie has to be the graphic animation of the ""mansion"", the story behind it and the way it kept me on the edge of my seat!
It's almost like a combination of ""Rose Red"" & the new remake of ""Dark Shadows"" rolled into one!
Whenever I watch either of those movies, I go right for ""The Haunting"" next!

Thanks! :)",1394755200,,419,4.172839506172839

5673333,1,B00BTYXNRI,"My only and favorite scene is Theo describing her attire:

Eleanor "" Nell"" Vance: I love your boots.
Theo: Oh, you do? Thanks! Prada; Milan, not New York.

The rest of the movie is just an unrelenting series of CG special effects, most of which are ridiculous and altogether destroys any sense of the psychological horror element that defines the spirit of the original story.
The true nature of the characters have been mangled beyond recognition and the overall plot is likewise massacred.
This latest version of the much beloved Susan Hill horror classic is nothing more than a ham handed, insensitive re-write of the original source material; nothing more than a poor excuse for a deafening cacophony of senseless digitized effects.

Dr. Markway's premise that this is a study of insomniacs is pointless and rife with silly frames of Luke popping sleeping pills out of a Pez dispenser and other clumsy absurdities. This is nothing more than a study in using computer technology to compensate for a terrible script and taking artistic liberties with disastrous consequences.

The only version worth watching is the earlier and iconic 1963 film with Claire Bloom and Julie Harris.",1490918400,,1182,5.046153846153846

5673336,5,B00BTYXNRI,"I remember seeing this movie very shortly after it came out(I think I was 10 years old) and I loved it. Admittedly, I've never seen the original, which I do plan to see, so I can't compare the two, but I did enjoy this movie. I remember being nervous to see it because just about anything will scare me, but this was not scary at all. It had a few tense moments for me as a 10 year old, but there's nothing tense about it now. The best way to describe this move is that while it's not over done, it also didn't go far enough.

Watching it now, I still enjoy the story and the effects still mostly hold up, in my opinion. Over all, I enjoyed this movie then and I still enjoy it now.",1486425600,,682,3.978102189781022

5673345,1,B00BTYXNRI,"If you liked this overstuff, clueless remake of a great, classic horror film. you may also enjoy being spoon fed crap with glitter in it until you are overstuffed and obese.

It's not just that it is stupidly reimagined so that everything is fully explained, catalogued and wrapped up (traits that should never accompany a ghost story) or that it is hilariously and sophomorically over-designed... it completely, totally and tragically misses the whole point of the film and book that inspired it.... which is the unknown. Nothing...and I mean NOTHING is left to the imagination here. Every ""aren't we just too too clever"" CGI event is patently reasoned and explained away.

What a disaster! The quintessential example of ""more is less"".... remade from a film that proved ""less is more"". I'm embarrassed for everyone involved.",1479427200,,826,5.111111111111111

5673353,3,B00BTYXNRI,"Jan De Bonts embarrassing remake of the beloved horror film The Haunting is one of the 1990s' biggest turkeys, a cringe-inducing, pompous CGI dump that gets laughed off screen.  Not only does it monkey with the source material in nonsensical ways, but it effectively becomes Twister in a house by the end of its running time.

All of this is a shame because there is still a lot of fun to be had in this massive production, what I believe was the most expensive horror film of all time when it was released nearly two decades ago.  First and foremost is the knockout art direction of Eugenio Zanetti  Hill House is one of the greatest sets ever designed in the history of motion pictures.  It is a simply amazing neo-gothic, megalithic, gargantuan mashup of old and new world aesthetics.  And as bad as the film is, at least for the first half the house is given free reign to shine in scene after scene.  The only thing missing is a gorgeous hostess, right?

In steps Catherine Zeta-Jones looking simply drop-dead gorgeous, slithering through corridors in her Prada boots and miniskirts its a  beautiful thing.  She never looked more beautiful than in this film and she carries herself with complete confidence.  Her acting?  Well, along with the rest of the cast the less said the better.  Lets try and stay positive.

In that spirit, I will not harp on the cabbage patch cherubs, the mummy returns ghoul, or the angry stained glass windows.  Even as a childish haunted house ride, this movie is a complete fail.  Liam Neeson has never been worse, Owen Wilson is at his most cloying, Lili Taylor finding her voice is like bad talent show, and Bruce Dern couldn't pass a community theatre audition for his cameo as the caretaker.  But throw in some rehashed Jerry Goldsmith, a few beautiful helicopter shots, and youve got yourself a godawful but handsomely produced guilty pleasure.",1475539200,3,1884,4.730061349693251

5673371,1,B00BTYXNRI,"The Haunting.
Not a good movie and a waste of good acting talent",1453852800,2,64,4.0
5673372,4,B00BTYXNRI,"This remake of the 1963 classic The Haunting was nominated for five Razzie Awards: worst actress (Catherine Zeta-Jones), worst screen couple (Catherine Zeta-Jones & Lili Taylor), worst screenplay (David Self), worst director (Jan de Bont), and worst picture.  It couldn't even win those awards!

This is a loosey-goosey version of Shirley Jacksons novel The Haunting of Hill House.  Many liberties were taken with the story.  Theres an almost cartoon sensibility strewn throughout, beginning with the evil couple trying to throw poor Nell (Lili Taylor) into the street unless she agrees to be their live-in nanny for a cackling boy from hell.  Then theres the disreputable doctor of sorts (Liam Neeson) who uses fraud as a means of skewing his study of fear response.  Theres a malpractice suit waiting to happen!  That, and wrongful death suit!!!  Naturally, things do not go as plan.  The haunted house they're using for the study happens to be really and truly haunted.  They waste a BIG budget on CGI to prove there are ghosts galore.  But while this fright-fest might be artistically appealing, it needs to learn a thing or two about what really scares us.  At what point does parody replace homage?

Its fussy, its frantic, its funny..............I quite liked it.",1452038400,,1270,5.0772946859903385

5673375,3,B00BTYXNRI,"This version of The Haunting is best described as a carnival funhouse - colorful but more corny than scary.  That said, I give it three stars because despite the fact that it is a truly dreadful remake, it is nonetheless fun in its own right.  If I hadn't read the book and seen the original film I would have given it a higher ranking, not for its value as a horror film, but because it is so delightfully campy and in places so simply ridiculous that you either have to laugh or gaze in bemused wonder at the bizaare events taking place on the screen.. Haunted house clichs abound and the special effects are over the top.  The house itself is something special - not creepy or scary - think architect on a bad LSD trip.  It's almost worth seeing the movie for the house alone.  The actors do their best with what they've got to work with - trying to make the dreadful script into something meaningful, but it's a stretch.  The plot itself makes very little sense and has absolutely nothing to do with the book Shirley Jackson wrote or the 1963 movie of the same name.

Don't go see this movie expecting Shirley Jackson.  Don't expect to be scared.  Go see it expecting a funhouse and you'll probably enjoy it.",1446595200,7,1212,4.3991031390134525
