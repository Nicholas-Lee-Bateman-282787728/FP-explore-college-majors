3531259,5,B001DJ7Q0E,"For years, the Lone Ranger TV show has been in syndication somewhere.  Since the 1949 season, it has run continuously on satellite and TV networks around the world.  The Lone Ranger, like Roy Rogers, became synonymous with honesty, integrity, and is a `universal' personality.
That has been both a problem and a blessing.  With broadcast copies being the standard, and only 17 PD episodes available on VHS and DVD, fans have been waiting for the real thing.  Now it is here.  Classic Media has now released seasons I and II in a special collectors edition celebrating the 75th anniversary of the Masked Man and Tonto.  The 13 box set includes 78 episodes (1900 minutes), an 88 page book packed with photos, a mask, and a rare comic book reprint.  There are special features like the Lone Ranger appearance on Lassie (1958), Lone Ranger cartoons (1966), and an episode guide as well.  The well heeled Ranger fan should take note.
The quality of the programs is outstanding!  The video is crisp, the audio is clean, and the masked man never looked better in b/w.  It is clear that they spared no expense in the preservation/restoration process.  One thing that was very cool was the commercial break point that has not been deleted.  Blowing wheat fields never looked so good.  One hint to the origin of the `masters', is the commercial break insert here mark, indicating that these may be from masters or broadcast copies that were salted away somewhere.

If I can be critical of the collectors set it is the 88 page booklet.  It is attractively packaged, with graphic images of the Lone Ranger from comics, advertising, and animated features, but a legend might have been useful.  There are many photos from a variety of sources, but the book text is a largely a reprint from the Saturday Evening Post (1939!  It would have been far better had there been an authoritative booklet on the history of the Ranger.  The chronology is mostly based on the TV/movie history of the Lone Ranger with a couple of mentions that are not accurate.  1948 is the beginning of the Lone Ranger comic, but not at 145 issues.  There were 2 other books released, and actually, Magic Comics and another McKay book began to reprint the comic strip in 1941, and even further back, the Lone Ranger ice cream comic hit stands in 1938/9.
That aside, this is long overdue, and very welcome.

Thanks for bringing us a DVD set that will place the Lone Ranger on video shelves one more time.

3531261,5,B001DJ7Q0E,"...To Those Thrilling Days of Yesteryear! That's right Classic TV western fans - it's finally happened. Hi-Yo Silver, Away! Our favorite hero, The Lone Ranger, rides again! He is being given the DVD respect he deserves but has never received.

The years of wasting money on Lone Ranger DVDs only to get release-after-release of public domain junk that should have been dumped into the trash bin rather than the cut-rate DVD bin are over. Classic Media has produced the best quality and most extensive compilation of RE-MASTERED episodes of this icon of so many of our childhoods - whether male or female.

The Lone Ranger - the 75th Anniversary Collector's Edition includes every episode from Season 1 and Season 2, which aired on ABC from 1959-1960, together in one package. (In these seasons, Clayton Moore portrayed The Lone Ranger and Jay Silverheels was Tonto, his Native-American partner.)

In the classic story, our hero is a lone Texas Ranger who survived an ambush and was nursed back to health by Tonto, who referred to him as 'Kemo Sabe.' They bankrolled their efforts to do good via a silver mine, which also supplied the Ranger with the silver bullets -- the calling card he becomes known by throughout the West.

Enter the Lone Ranger! The first three episodes tells the origin of our hero, and how he met and joined forces with Tonto, as well as how he found his trusty steed, Silver. (Tonto rode Scout.)  After that, the episodes chronicle their exciting adventures.

In addition to the 78 episodes (1,900 plus minutes) of the show on about a dozen photo-discs, this Anniversary set also includes three bonus episodes from the '60s cartoon series, a classic episode of Lassie featuring The Lone Ranger, and an original Lone Ranger radio show broadcast from 1950. But, not to end there, this great package includes an 88-page Commemorative Book, a complete episode guide, reprints of rare comic books and photos, and limited edition collectibles, too.

Fran Stiker and George W. Trendle created the Lone Ranger as a local radio program in 1933. It quickly went nationwide and was the cornerstone of the old Mutual Radio network. The ""Hi-Yo Silver!"" shout at the beginning of each episode is a recording of Earle W. Graser, who played the Lone Ranger on radio from 1933-1941.

Here is the complete Classic TV opening (which played over the strains of Rossini's `William Tell' Overture):

""A fiery horse with the speed of light, a cloud of dust and a hearty `Hi Yo Silver!' The Lone Ranger...`Hi Yo Silver, away!' With his faithful Indian companion Tonto, the daring and resourceful masked rider of the plains, led the fight for law and order in the early west. Return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear. The Lone Ranger rides again!""

At the end of most episodes, the towns folk or others who were saved from the desperados often asked, ""Who was that Masked Man?"" to images of The Lone Ranger and Tonto galloping away into the sunset.

The Lone Ranger is truly immortal, with three feature films, more than 3,000 Classic Radio shows, 220 Classic TV shows, 18 novels, hundreds of comic books, and a Star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame. (In 1952, B-film actor John Hart replaced Clayton Moore, who had threatened to quit after 1950. He was being paid only $500 an episode for his hit show, and wanted a substantial raise. Audiences rejected Hart in the role, and after a mere 36 episodes Moore was back atop Silver. Moore wore the mask in 169 episodes through the end of the show's run in 1957, while Silverheels was Tonto for each episode of the TV series. Moore also brought and won a famous lawsuit to allow him to wear THE MASK and costume in personal appearances after he left the show. While the suit was pending, he wore wraparound sunglasses and starred in an equally famous sunglass commercial that asked, ""Who was that Masked Man behind those Foster Grants?"")

Still today, the Ranger remains a symbol of truth, justice, courage and friendship, embodied in the Lone Ranger creed, a copy of which is included in this boxed set, and reads in part: ""I do solemnly swear to be honest and truthful...to pledge my hand to the weak...to pledge my heart to the helpless...to pledge my life to my fellowmen.""

Hooray to Classic Media for this truly classic, and long-overdue, DVD tribute to the Ranger for both old and new fans alike.",1219276800,135,4359,4.780585106382978

3531330,3,B001DJ7Q0E,"Precious memories...I got 'em, just like most of the men (and a few women) who review this set.

Like the Season 1-Season 2 75th Anniversary DVD set, this set is important, because it keeps this classic TV series--and all the other stuff, the radio program, the comics--in this corner of North American (yeah, Canada, too) popular culture alive and out there.

But my memories ARE precious, so after watching an episode and a half...I ditched it.

 See, I was only about ten when I saw this stuff.  I'm not ten anymore. I've grown up.  The TV show, of course, didn't ""grow up"" with me--or anyone else. And it is unfair to ask it to do the impossible.  Sorry, folks, but it was almost impossible to produce really quality entertainment on the kind of crank-it-out treadmill much of filmed TV  was in those days. However, having just sampled a bit, my memories are still intact.

Before we owned at TV (1953), I ""saw"" the Masked Man on the radio, and those are the most precious memories of all, because they really are MY creation. Radio--and the Ranger's records--worked that way. There aren't a lot of those memories--I don't recall a local Vancouver, B.C. radio station carrying the show, so I only heard it via Seattle--static and all. Usually when I was sick, curled up in bed, watching the glow from my little red mantle radio.

The new Johnny Depp movie?  Great entertainment, clever stuff, fabulous visuals. I appreciated it, enjoyed it...and my memories are still intact!

Thanks to Mr. Hornaway in New Jersey: in his review of the 75th Anniversary set he takes the trouble to quote the introduction--a terrific, evocative piece of writing I have carried in my brain for over half a century. However, the review actually missed one line, which I have included below in caps. Jog your memory:

""A fiery horse with the speed of light, a cloud of dust and a hearty `Hi Yo Silver!' The Lone Ranger...(`Hi Yo Silver, away!') With his faithful Indian companion Tonto, the daring and resourceful masked rider of the plains led the fight for law and order in the early west. Return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear. FROM OUT OF THE PAST COME THE THUNDERING HOOFBEATS OF THE GREAT HORSE SILVER!

3531343,5,B001DJ7Q0E,"Having grown up with a dad who was a big fan of The Lone Ranger, I've been subjected to every poor quality ""bootleg"" VHS and DVD he could get his hands on, and they were only varying degrees of rubbish prints of the few public domain episodes we've all seen in ""bargain bin"" boxed sets.

With Father's Day coming on, I decided to take a look around and see if I couldn't find a DVD set that gave the Ranger his fair due. Enter the 75th Anniversary Seasons 1 and 2 Boxed set. The reviews were promising, raves about finally seeing the show in a proper release, picture and audio quality were praised.

So I bought it for him and waited until yesterday (Father's Day) when I gave it to him.

Well, the reviews were right! I've never seen the show look or sound better than it does here! I'm fussy about PQ and AQ on DVD/Blu-ray and taking into consideration the age of the film masters, this is one great treatment all around. Sure, a few episodes have some hiss(THAT DOESN'T DETRACT FROM HEARING DIALOGUE AND MUSIC), and some random shots are a bit muddy (usually the obvious ""stock footage"" of cattle and what not), but I doubt we'll ever see the show looking better.

The extras are plentiful and a blast to look at! The reproduction promotional pieces are fun, and the book appears to be informative (I've yet to read it). While I wasn't around (I'm Thirty) to see the Lone Ranger when it originally aired, nor am I much of a fan (I'm a BIG lover of things vintage including film/television/music, so it's not a ""generation gap"" or not ""getting"" the show, I'm just not a ""western"" fan), but I found myself getting sentimental about the Lone Ranger looking over the comic book and such. I greatly respect what The Lone Ranger and Tonto represent. Decency, standing up for what's right, morals... all things I find sorely lacking in today's (sadly MY) world. See, I'm getting sentimental again!

As always, there's usually something that bears mentioning, and this one's been mentioned before. The DVD packaging, while nice to look at, offers very little in the way of protection for the discs (somewhat humorously typo'ed as ""Disk"" on the DVD menus). The second disc was scratched on arrival, I will be contacting Classic to see about getting a replacement disc, will update this review when I know more.

3531360,5,B001DJ7Q0E,"i enjoy the more strict formula that is seen in these first two years of The Lone Ranger.  these were with Clayton Moore and black and white.  The Lone Ranger and Tonto did what they believed in and didn't ask for anything.  Both actors wanted to exemplify good qualities.  The Lone Ranger was a sharp, observant character and Tonto provided insights from his expertise and had humility.  both were loyal to each other.  it was really non violent.  nobody ever killed anybody.
you may see some other actors you know in here.  DeForest Kelley who was in westerns before he played Bones on Star Trek is in a couple of episodes.  Glenn Strange, Monte Blue, House Peters, Jr., Nestor Paiva, Lane Bradford, etal. are also in these.

3531366,5,B001DJ7Q0E,"I gave this item five stars because it exceeded my expectations in several ways. First, the box for this set looks good, and is sturdy. Second, it ships with a number of historical materials that add value to the set, including a rather lengthy picture book containing old articles and trivia about the radio and television shows. There is also a booklet with good descriptions of each episode, including mentioning any well-known actors who might have appeared in each episode. Third, the disc ""sleeves"" are not cheap sleeves, but sturdy folders containing the discs and additional photos and art related to the Lone Ranger. Finally, the video itself is of good quality (as well as the audio) and plays perfectly on my set-top player and computer. This set was done with an unusual attention to detail. My family loves the shows...they are clean, and are something I can let my children watch without worry. One last note...given the low price of this item, you should get it.

3531379,5,B001DJ7Q0E,"I bought this on a whim. I vaguely remembered the tv show from when it was in reruns during the early 1960's. In the last year, I had gotten into watching early television shows and enjoying them greatly. So much of what is on tv now is loaded with sexual innuendo, political correctness, reality programming, and a subtle (and not so subtle) moral depravity. The old tv shows were - surprise! - entertaining, and the characters lived in a moral universe where sex wasn't their 24/7 mental preoccupation and there was a clear line between right and wrong.
This dvd promised two seasons of episodes from 1949-1950 for 20$. I bought. When the package arrived, I was overwhelmed with the generosity of the DVD producers. I wish other dvd set producers took this much trouble with their shows. This is a beautiful package jam packed with extras. It comes in a sturdy, well designed box that opens up like an old fashioned cigar box. Inside the box is a comic book, Lone Ranger souvenirs, a glossy photo of Clayton Moore, Lone Ranger club membership card, color tv cards, etc. There is a lovingly designed and thick book of articles, photos, timelines, etc., about the Lone Ranger. Really, just the extras would be worth $20 to any Lone Ranger fan.
And then there's the dvd's themselves!
The first shows are from 1949. Yes, 1949! Tv was barely out of the cradle when these shows were broadcast. What would they look like? Grainy? Scratchy? Smudged? NO WAY! These were lovingly restored. They look MAGNIFICENT! Clear and sharp black and white. 78 episodes? All this for $20? If you have any interest in this show, ORDER THIS NOW! This may be the best 1950's dvd box set of a tv series ever put together!
The shows themselves are better than I expected. Simple but surprisingly moving story lines. And the Lone Ranger character is a deeply moral figure. No Quentin Tarantino violent revenge (and sadistically depraved) bloody nonsense here. The Lone Ranger has a strict moral code (look on Wikipedia to read it). Tonto and LR have a beautiful friendship (LR saved Tonto's life once and Tonto returned the favor years later (today, the Hollywood writers would be insinuating that it was gay)): they are two men sickened by lawlessness. They are out to do their best to make the West safe for one and all. LR is a great role model for kids and adults.

3531389,5,B001DJ7Q0E,"Return with us as we journey back to those thrilling days of yesteryear when I was in grade school and the Lone Ranger was the coolest thing going.

Five days a week, after school, Channel 40 (a family-oriented channel long since eaten up by the Christian Broadcast Network) aired the Lone Ranger, and I had an agreement with Mom and Pop: I could watch LR only if I knocked the homework out immediately afterward so, natch, I kept the agreement. And since we had meatloaf two nights a week there were also cold leftover sandwiches that went well while riding the dusty trail with Kemosabe (trusty scout, for the uninitiated). Re-runs of Batman and Gilligan's Island were also part of Channel 40's schedule, along with the Andy Griffith Show, Beverly Hillbillies and something called Superman.

The Lone Ranger was a major influence on me; lots of valuable moral and ethical elements on display and he put people ahead of his own needs and wants, a staple ingredient for larger than life heroes. And trust me, a Gen Xer I can recognize superior qualities with the speed of Superman.

There were a few guest appearances in this series, including DeForrest Kelley (Dr. McCoy from Star Trek), John Hart (the replacement Lone Ranger from season three, not included in this set) and Glenn Strange (yep, the fourth Frankenstein Monster, replacing Boris Karloff, Lon Chaney Jr. and Bela Lugosi); Strange, of course, was Butch Cavendish, the villain responsible for the origin of our hero, the Lone Ranger in the first three episodes.

The video looks sharp and the audio is almost too crisp, but it is indeed a pristine collection and I am extremely satisfied.

This boxset has all kinds of nifty items that I will cherish, but the episode guide and the booklet biography on the origin of the iconoclastic character that debuted on radio long before TV were awesome and way too informative for a geek like me.

Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels are ingraved in my memories as celluloid gods and will always be The Lone Ranger and Tonto to me, no slight meant for John Hart.

I hope the new Lone Ranger movie Hollyweird's been teasing us with doesn't disappoint like the rumors are suggesting: a whiny, sarcastic and self-aware Tonto played by very un-Indian Johnny Depp makes my skin crawl. Tonto would look and sound like a cartoon character undeserving of the title ""hero"".

It also appears, from the description, that the terrific extras are the same for both sets.  The new version is, of course, considerably more expensive.

One tiny gripe--1.  the Intro seems to be sped up.  And what happened to the part where LR rides back down the hill trail with the narrator's invitation to ""Return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear. The Lone Ranger rides again!""  Was that added in a later season?
  But, as everyone says:  Superb quality and wonderful packaging, filled with antiqued, souvenir extras that bring back the old days of Baby Boomer Consumerism!  Great gift I've been savoring for two years.  I long to get ahold of the final season and especially the final episode--Outlaws in Greasepaint--where the LR unmasks and disguises himself, not as the ""old prospector,"" but as Othello to catch a pair of crooked Shakespearean actors!

3531408,5,B001DJ7Q0E,"First of all, the picture quality is beautiful. You can tell they came from the original 35mm negatives because of how sharp and crisp these films are. The first 78 episodes on a 12 disc box set at the price Amazon is offering is a bargain. When they filmed the opening sequence with The Lone Ranger racing about to save the day, they shot it in color anticipating broadcasting in color later. While the first few seasons were black and white, including these, if you look reeeal carefully you will see at the very beginning as the episodes fades in the color tinting to black and white. Look real carefully and you'll see it. That is how you can also tell they came from the original masters. Else they would have been black and white from the fraction of the first second to the last. My only complaint is the old time radio broadcast included in this set. It sounds awful. So bad, in fact, that they scanned the original radio script and posted it on the screen for you to read as the radio recording is played. That's how bad it is. Sounds like something downloaded off the web. Which is a darn shame as there are a couple companies that specialize in old time radio shows and more specifically, they house original transcription discs to ensure first generation transfers.

They were shown here on the BBC on Saturday afternoons. The stories were always compact and often quite thoughtful, even if you did guess that the chief villain running the outlaw gang was one of the respected townspeople. Clayton Moore always had a nice quality to his voice and graceful movements, here was a cowboy who really could ride a horse and twirl a six gun. I always felt a bit sorry for Tonto as he often got beaten up, I was waiting for him to one day say to the ranger, ""No, this time you ride in to town and see what you can find out!""  I was pleasantly surpised by all the free gifts that accompany this release, particularly the signed photo which I have now framed. However the only reason I have not given it five stars is that the episodes do not have the original opening sequence, and half the opening dialogue is missing, what happened to the bit about, ""With his faithfull Indian companion Tonto, the daring and resourceful masked rider of the plains"" etc. That one complaint aside these episodes are a joy to watch, ""The Lone Ranger Rides Again!""",1311984000,5,1199,4.525345622119816

There is only one episode on disc 7 out of all of them that you cannot get the complete episode. I did not have any challenge with that since all the others are gems. This series came at the time that some of us remember, as the days when TV had clean, family entertainment no digital effects and did not need ratings and the good guys always won against the bad ones. There is strong moral teaching here that should be timeless. The other great thing is that the episodes are only about 25 minutes long, so that you can regulate how many to watch. I have gotten great pleasure out of this and can faintly remember seeing the later years of this wonderful series. I imagine many of you can remember sitting in your Living Rooms and being captivated by The Lone Ranger. One other great thing is that Mr. Silverheels was a real Indian and not some white guy pretending.

3531426,4,B001DJ7Q0E,"As I remember the early days of television, MY earliest days; I seem to remember that a LOT of shows were in transition from the already established and generally accepted medium of RADIO - - -  No pichurs.

The Lone Ranger, Dragnet, Burns & Allen, Captain Midnight....  were scripted so as to do dual duty for broadcast on either medium.  Maybe with a little sleuthing we can discover matching OTR (Old Time Radio) episodes using the same soundtracks.

I KNOW that Jack Webb specifically formulated the scripts for his tv show to be also broadcast as radio episodes.

I remember as a VERY little boy that the sound in the tv had failed and the repairman wasn't due til some later day.  My foster mother tuned in the Lone Ranger on the radio on a shelf near the top of the kitchen door (better reception there, I now suppose).  We sat in the doorway of the kitchen and watched an episode of the Lone Ranger on the tv in the living room whereas the audio came from the radio in the kitchen.

BTW - I am also remembering Clayton Moore as one of the characters in the serial Radar Men From The Moon where the hero dons some bullet shaped helmet and rocket backpack and flies aaround.  No one ever seem to notice just where that racket backpack exhaust is actually pointed.

Funny thing tho.....  Here in Atlanta we didn't get Captain Midnight on Saturday mornings....  we got Jet Jackson.  It is/was the same show.  Now THERE is a bit of trivia worth researching.

3531436,5,B001DJ7Q0E,When you consider that The Lone Ranger TV Show (1949 - 1957) was produced in the early years of TV the production values were quite good with great morals to be learned by the younger generation of that time.

BUT I'm into the seventh disk already and have seen the pattern of the shows. ( I might have to amend my comment when I'm all done, however )The episodes are the ones shown a bunch of years ago on the western channel. They are edited down because I happen to have a dvd set of "" Lost Episodes "" which give you the entire show, General Mills flag swaying before a wind-whipped field of wheat, and the original commercials--some with Clayton Moore himself. First off, the opening ride on this anniversary box set is from the color episodes with the color eliminated. The insert shot is who knows what. After the ranger rears Silver, he rides down the hill along a winding narrow path, a short shot of riding down a hill behind a boulder without Silver's extra chest piece ( it's from the origin episodes )and then out into a badlands scene with him riding right at you and firing his pistol straight at the camera and toward you the viewer. All this to "" with his faithful Indian companion Tonto the daring and resourceful masked rider of the plains led the fight for law and order in the early west....return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear when the Lone Ranger rides again""...

3531439,5,B001DJ7Q0E,"much more well known and influential adaptation of the Lone Ranger was the 1949-1957 television series starring Clayton Moore (though with John Hart as the Lone Ranger from 1952-1954) and Jay Silverheels as Tonto. The live-action TV series initially featured Gerald Mohr as the episode narrator. He was also narrator for seven episodes of the radio series in 1949, 1950 and 1952. Fred Foy served as both narrator and announcer of the radio series from 1948 to its finish, and became announcer of the TV version when story narration was dropped there.

Although George W. Trendle retained the title of Producer, he recognized that his experience in radio would not be adequate for producing the television series. For this, he hired veteran MGM film producer Jack Chertok. Chertok served as the producer for the first 182 episodes, as well as a rarely seen 1955 color special, retelling the origin.

The first 78 episodes were produced and broadcast for 78 consecutive weeks without any breaks or reruns. Then the entire 78 episodes were shown again, before any new episodes were produced. It was shot in Utah and California.

When it came time to produce another batch of 52 episodes, there was a wage dispute with Clayton Moore (until his death, the actor insisted the problem was creative differences), and John Hart was hired to play the role of the Lone Ranger. Once again, the 52 new episodes were aired in sequence, followed by 52 weeks rerunning them. Despite expectations that the mask would make the switch workable, Hart was not accepted in the role, and his episodes were not seen again until the 1980s.

In a radio interview, posted at [1], Clayton Moore acknowledged that he had a dispute with the producers over money and wanted better treatment. That was the reason he was replaced by John Hart.

At the end of the fifth year of the television series, Trendle sold the Lone Ranger rights to Jack Wrather, who bought them on August 3, 1954. Wrather immediately rehired Clayton Moore to play the Lone Ranger and another 52 episodes were produced. Once again, they were broadcast as a full year of new episodes followed by a full year of reruns.

The final season saw a number of changes, the most obvious at the time being an episode count of the by-then industry standard 39. Wrather invested money out of his own pocket to film in color -- then-perennial third place finisher ABC telecasting only in black and white -- and to go back outdoors for more than just second-unit style action footage, the series having been otherwise restricted to studio sound stages after the first filming block. Another big change, not readily detectable by the viewers, was replacing Jack Chertok with producer Sherman A. Harris. By this time, Chertok had established his own television production company and was busy producing other shows.

Wrather decided not to negotiate further with the network and took the property to the big screen, canceling TV production. The last new episode of the color series was broadcast June 6, 1957 and the series ended September 12, 1957, although ABC reaped the benefits of daytime reruns for several more years. Wrather's company produced two modestly budgeted theatrical features, The Lone Ranger (1956) (the cast included former child actress Bonita Granville, who had, by then, married Wrather) and The Lone Ranger and the Lost City of Gold (1958). Exactly what happened remains unclear, but Wrather changed distributors between films, indicating some problem",1227484800,8,3499,4.9811643835616435

I'm 37 as of last week, so I have only seen these in syndication (and that was twenty years ago), but I have bought every DVD release of LR material so far, and let me tell you, NOTHING compares to this set.  This time, they done it right!

That's not to say the set is perfect.  Even cleaned up, the episodes still show their age sometimes with artifacts from film deterioration (but nothing that you shouldn't expect for such old footage).  I'm not qualified to speak about which version these episodes represent (original broadcast vs. syndication), but I have no quibbles with the shows as presented here.  All I care about is finally getting to watch these episodes.  I don't think I even remember over half of them!

What pushes this set over the top is the extras.  The cartoons are great.  I grew up on the 1980 revival of the cartoon, but seeing the earlier version was awesome.  There's also a Lassie episode that's fun and a old-time rado episode (which I already had in MP3 format).  But the clincher for me was the reproductions of the memorabilia.  The old comic reprint is really cool.  I have a number of the old Dell issues, so this is right up my alley.

3531444,4,B001DJ7Q0E,"I just received this set this evening and have spent some time going through it.  I did not observe any 11-13 minute episodes that have been mentioned in other reviews, the ones I checked appeared to be full-length.  There are quite a few 22-23 minute episodes, but there do not appear to be any significant edits to the best of my knowledge.  There is some time compression but nothing that I found to be too distracting from what I've observed so far, and I've barely noticed any jumpiness in the picture or any warbling on the sound that sometimes accompanies severe time compression on other releases and TV broadcasts. In fact the episodes look better than any syndicated TV print I've seen. And of course the 25 minute shows look amazing.

The sections immediately following the main title intro that used to say ""Return with us now to the thrilling days of yesteryear"" do appear to be removed from the episodes I glanced at. There is also a weird insertion of a close-up of the Lone Ranger sitting still on his horse inserted at the point in the main title intro when he's charging up the hill on his horse and the narrator says ""...and a hearty hi-yo Silver"", then it cuts back to the standard shot of him rearing up on Silver. I don't ever remember that shot being inserted in syndication, I always recall that it was a continuous shot of him riding up the hill and rearing up. It appears in all of the episodes I glanced at. No biggie, but it still struck me as odd.

Only other quibbles I have are that there don't appear to be chapter stops inserted, and the time counter for the episodes continue to accrue; they don't start at 00:00:00 at the beginning of each episode but instead have one continuous running time from the beginning of the first episode to the end of the last episode on the disc. Makes it difficult to figure out each show's running time.

The extras included in this set are plentiful and nicely crafted. The commemorative book in particular has a lot of material to go through. There is a bonus disc featuring some LR cartoons, a Lassie episode with the LR and some radio shows, a Season 1 and 2 episode guide, a 'signed' photo, a vintage comic book reproduction, a vintage ID card, Victory Corps membership kit, Lone Ranger Safety Club postcard, and trading cards.

I was on the fence about this set for the last several days but several reviews here and at the Home Theater Forum (along with the great job Classic Media did on the Sergeant Preston sets I own) convinced me to take the plunge and I'm glad I did. It is a blast seeing these episodes again and reliving some fond memories from my childhood in the process. I hope we get more seasons released from Classic Media, perhaps one next year for the 60th anniversary of the TV show.

3531447,5,B001DJ7Q0E,"It is great news to hear that ""The Lone Ranger"" seasons one and two shall be released as a properly restored 13 disc set. This is the second of two good pieces of DVD news for me this fall, the first being the release of the 1929-1938 Little Rascals shorts.

There was a time, from my childhood up until the mid-1980's, when shows such as the Lone Ranger and The Little Rascals filled week-day afternoon and Saturday morning TV slots. Old movies could be readily found on TV late at night and on Sunday afternoons. Ever since TV stations began filling every extra additional minute with infomercials and their own first-run productions and reality shows, as well as the beginning of the continuous news cycle, these old classics have not seen the light of day. Even networks supposedly dedicated to classic TV seem to think that ""Scrubs"" and ""The Fresh Prince"" constitute classic TV. That's why it's great to have shows such as The Lone Ranger properly restored and available to us again.

I also appreciate that all 78 episodes of the first two seasons are in this set, oddly distributed as 52 weekly episodes in season one and 26 in season two. No stingy ""Season 1 Volume 1"" sets here, just because there were more episodes per season during the 50's and 60's than exist today. Do note that some of the episodes are very short - in some cases only 11 or 12 minutes long. That is because sometimes the sponsor would put two short serials in the same half hour slot. The time really belonged to the sponsor back in those days, and early TV schedules looked a lot like radio at first.

My favorite episode of the first two seasons was ""The Silent Voice"" towards the end of season two. The witness to a crime is a stroke victim who is completely paralyzed. The Lone Ranger comes up with a way for the woman to communicate by blinking in response to letters of the alphabet.

The other episode from this early part of the series that sticks out is one in which the wife in a husband/wife crime team betrays the husband and shoots him. He is presumed dead and taken to the undertaker's. The Lone Ranger discovers that the husband is not dead, and the husband makes a confession as to what is going on before he dies as he lies on a slab about to buried - alive. The Lone Ranger tricks the wife by claiming that her husband is still alive. That's what I liked about the Lone Ranger - it really could be very dark. There would always be the happy ending with the criminals rounded up and jailed, but that didn't mean that some good people didn't fall along the way or that something really creepy or cringe-worthy wasn't part of the plot. Highly recommended. The following is the listing of the episodes on each disc:
