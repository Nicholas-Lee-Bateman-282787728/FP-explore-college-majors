5736455,5,B00CRWDK74,I have always enjoyed watching these characters have so much fun with physics and science!  Can't wait for more!  Keep it coming guys!,1391644800,,134,4.782608695652174
5736456,5,B00CRWDK74,"It is Mythbusters.  If you don't know Mythbusters, the collections (any of them) are a great way to see what they are.  They are a nice grab bag of the various experiments they perform on the show and showcase the various personality of the staff.

#10 follows the prior 9 collections, with a random, but great, gathering of the more popular segments of that year's season.  And you get a little bit of everything.

If you love Mythbusters, keep it going and add to your collection.  If you don't know, or are curious, any of the collections, are a great start to get a respectable feel for the series.",1383696000,,602,4.477064220183486
5736457,5,B00CRWDK74,"Mythbusters is my favorite cable television show. Problem is I don't have cable. So when a new one of these collection sets I immediately order it. This new collection is great, a bunch of new experiments and a lot of stuff blowing up. What not to like? If you're a big fan like me, you need this set in your video library. The Newton's Cradle episode has to be my favorite of this collection mostly because how much Jamie giggles during it.

8585456,4,B00CRWDK74,"We really liked the Mythbusters series when we first saw them, but after Scotty left the build team and Carrie became the only woman, she got really annoying IMHO - very ""cutesy.""  After a while the ""clever interactions"" - particularly from the era of the Build Team - seemed to take the focus over from the actual science, and we just got tired of it, especially when they wouod do things just to be mean to each other. What kind of role mode is that? But, we still did enjoy the science part.  Maybe the thing to do is to not watch too many of the episodes from any one collection too often.",1451347200,,593,4.238938053097345

educational a-n-d entertaining.... with bonus huge E=X=P=L=O=S=I=O=N=S !
