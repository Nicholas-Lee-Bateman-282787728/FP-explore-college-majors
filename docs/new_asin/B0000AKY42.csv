1907939,4,B0000AKY42,"Sick: The Life and Death of Bob Flanagan, Supermasochist (Kirby [director's name censored for Amazon consumption], 1997)

One of my least favorite movies of all time contains a line that I often quote: ""there are some things the you see, and then you can't unsee them, you know?"" (Joaquin Phoenix in 8MM.) Just going to show that even an awful film can have a moment of scripting genius. Sick: The Life and Death of Bob Flanagan, Supermasochist, contains one of those things. Even if I never see it again, there's a particular scene in this film that will haunt me to my deathbed. It's not just the incredible act that's performed (and if you haven't seen the movie yet, when you stumble upon the scene in question, you will know it), but the way director Kirby [director's name censored for Amazon consumption] puts everything together: the film footage, the incredibly inappropriate music, the foreshadowing. (Flanagan mentions the scene in a few of his monologues earlier in the movie.) This is the third of Kirby [director's name censored for Amazon consumption]'s films I've seen, and the earliest of the three; I expected no less.

[director's name censored for Amazon consumption] here profiles Bob Flanagan, one of the longest-lived sufferers of cystic fibrosis. Flanagan handled his disease by controlling his body the only way he could: through masochism. We alternate scenes from various performance videos with interviews featuring, for the most part, Flanagan and his longtime partner/dominatrix, Sheree Rose. (About two thirds of the way through the film, a third major player enters the picture: Sarah Doucette, a Canadian sufferer of cystic fibrosis who meets Flanagan through the Make-a-Wish Foundation.) While it's tempting to see Flanagan solely through the lens of his being a masochist or a performance artist or whatever single facet of his personality one might find the most interesting (or vile, judging by some reactions to the movie), Kirby [director's name censored for Amazon consumption] presents a complex, hopelessly optimistic guy who's just getting by the best he can, until, as the title of the film warns us, he can't any more. Those final moments are touching in a way I can't explain; once again, [director's name censored for Amazon consumption] manages to put everything together (everything that happens after Flanagan's death is chronicled not by [director's name censored for Amazon consumption]'s filmmaking, but by photos Rose shot at the hospital and the morgue) in the most powerful way possible.

Fantastic, pure and simple. ****",1206403200,4,2577,5.189903846153846
1907940,5,B0000AKY42,"This is far from a simple story.

I have a very small, miniscule glimpse of what it's like to live in pain on a daily basis. After watching this mans story I realize I have nothing to complain about and so much yet to experience and learn.

I will never want to participate in S&M sexual behavior. I'm just not programmed that way. I didn't, however shudder away from the sights on the screen while Sheree, Bob's lover and partner of 15 years, poked needles through the skin of his scrotum and while Bob hung by his ankles and choked on his disease. He had Cystic Fibrosis. The most difficult part of the documentary was watching him die. It is in your face death, and death of the worst kind. He drowned in his own phlegm and fluids.

But he lived so incredibly hard and his way, with what seemed like no apologies or regrets. This documentary shows a humor of the sickest and smartest kind.

I remember being a young girl, maybe 9 and watching a ""Hallmark Movie of the Week"". It was called Alex: The Life of a Child. I later found out it was actually based on a book written by her father, Frank Deford. I was so moved by this story and didn't understand at that age why someone as old as me had to die from having a cold. I didn't understand Cystic Fibrosis or what it actually did to the body, but I never forgot the movie or the disease and eventually read the book. When I read about SICK, the documentary, I had to get it. I'm morbid in my own way I suppose. I'm curious about things that a lot of people wouldn't dare read or watch or even talk about, so this was right up my alley. Had I known I was going to become so entranced by Bob I think I would have chosen not to watch. Only because you see this sick but Alive man die...as I said and It's something that is incredibly difficult to just put out of my mind.

Regardless, I am so moved and am so glad he had the courage to put his story on film for the world to see. I only wish more people had the courage to watch his life, with out judgment and with empathy.",1164326400,13,2026,4.118987341772152
1907941,4,B0000AKY42,"Man, this movie makes for some truly harsh watching, yet Flanagan is a stunningly fascinating man. It's just hard to believe this is the same man shown in the clip of ""The Steve Allen Show"". Juuxtapose this with Bob getting... No, I'm not going to spoil it. But this is the movie for people who claim to have seen everything.

  Needless to say, don't watch it with your kids.",1137974400,3,376,4.420289855072464

1907943,3,B0000AKY42,"I couldn't help feeling for Bob, watching him die made me cry.

The movie has some VERY graphic scenes, but his humor and stories make it worth it.",1101340800,4,147,4.25
1907944,3,B0000AKY42,"It takes a certain kind of brave and twisted person to turn his life and body into an S & M performance piece.  Bob Flanagan is both sick and brilliant.  Flanagan survived cystic fibrosis until the age of forty-two - a very long time.  He attributes this to constantly inflicting pain on himself relentlessly over the years.  His dominatrix partner Sheree, helps him with is goals.  The various scenes are sometimes spliced with dark humor and other times simply shown in their bleak gruesomeness.  There is nothing that Bob and Sheree have not done to him to inflict pain in the most disgusting ways possible.  It's an entirely different world and it takes a strong stomach to watch.  Bob specializes in abusing his penis in ways unimaginable, including a scene with a hammer, a nail and a board - there is blood.  The most amazing part of this documentary is when Bob and Sheree take this `performance art' to various museums in New York and Los Angeles.  Bob allows himself to be raised by his feet, pierced, shackled and naked, high above the museum goers heads.  It is disturbing.  If you have an interest in the S & M/bondage world, you might find this interesting, but the scenes are so graphic and sometimes overwhelming in their intensity, it can be hard to stomach.  This is a perplexing film.",1087603200,23,1303,4.662280701754386
1907945,5,B0000AKY42,"First of all, this is a beautiful film in the way that Zwigoff's biopic Crumb is beautiful and sublime.  Artists who live outloud like Bob Flanagan and Robert Crumb, who trample over boundaries, convention, and mores in their pursuit of personal and creative expression are to be understood and admired.  This film is beautiful in how it behaves as art.
Yes, it's about a guy who hurts himself and lets others hurt him.  Yes, it's got some harsh images and scenes in it and there are parts that will make you cringe, but to describe it as ""beautiful"" is not a run at irony.  Calling it beautiful is the sum total of every aspect of ""Sick""  --  it's impact, his life, his images, and his intentions.  With this film, Bob Flanagan achieved the holy grail of modern art:  transforming a taboo act/attitude into a sublime and transcendant expression.  Wow.  An amazing feat, in life or death.
I hope this movie gets the attention it deserves, moreover, the attention that Bob Flanagan deserved.  What a brave artist.  I sure wish I'd paid more attention to him when I first heard of him and he was still present in the here and now.",1081728000,7,1128,4.557213930348259
1907946,4,B0000AKY42,"SICK (Lions Gate) is a caustic, brilliant, funny, compassionate look at the life and death of comedian Bob Flanagan, who embraced S/M to manage the pain of cystic fibrosis.  You will be shocked and amazed and moved to tears of laughter and sadness all at once.

Whether your into kink, art, have chronic pain or illness and are a little twisted, this film is a gift. This is not safe for kids as it has nudity & very adult situations (not porn though,) many BDSM situations. If you enjoy Bob or his art, I would recommend his books, The Pain Journal, and Slave Sonnets (and one more who's title I can't put here). RE/Search also did a full issue on him as well.",1467849600,,500,4.329787234042553

7997484,4,B0000AKY42,"essentially this the story of bob who has had an excruciating disease, cf, from birth and the genesis and development of his coping mechanism, masochism... there will be some who view this work and it will only be the experience of voyeurism into an extreme lifestyle choice... this was not my experience... i found it to be touching introspection into the life of clever optimistic witty person who was tasked with finding meaning, pleasure and simply the will to live under inescapable and continuous duress...

this film is EXTREMELY graphic... although masochism is not my bailiwick and it was difficult to watch... that being said... it is important for true understanding and authenticity... i think even the best imaginations would not be able to really perceive the nature of the choices he makes and why... it's too easy to dismiss this work as autobiographical fetish porn... there is true courage in this story and it is inspirational ... it has to be to people who are not enduring emotional or physical pain to this magnitude and perhaps even more to those who are ...

it is an extremely complete autobiography, his family is interviewed, his performance art is included, slice of life footage, direct to camera conversation, his girlfriend who is a coproducer of the film and she is prominently featured as an indivdual and as she is intergrated into his life... and his death with its aftermath are also included

intellectually speaking this film offers a vast repetoire for exploration and reflection ... i strongly recommend this film with the hope that the viewer will be able to surpress the tendency to view the subject as the masochism instead of the man",1416355200,3,1677,4.918727915194347

7997486,5,B0000AKY42,"I bought this movie years ago after seeing this guy in the NIN video. It's easy to place judgement on what you see here because of the cover. But I have to be the first to say Don't Judge A Book By its Cover!!! What I found most moving in this film is how this man was born with a disease that was attacking him from the inside out and he wan't to feel empowered by taking his body to the extremes. Its really about the power of the spirit, and the mind over the matter. Most of all though is the relationship between he and his wife. From his Life to His Death. Others may look at it as disgusting. But to me it was a testament of trust and true love. She was with him every step of the way from beginning to the end and even after. What I learned from this movie is that I hope to have a love in my life that accepts me for who I am and all that I am. I believe we all deserve someone like that in our corner. Someone who doesn't want to change us but to celebrate us as we are, as we celebrate them as they are. Riveting, Beautiful, Amazing, and a Hidden little Gem of a movie about someones real life. Great work to the director.",1304121600,2,1133,3.909090909090909
