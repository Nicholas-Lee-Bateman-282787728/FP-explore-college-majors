8380124,3,B002TEKAEG,Muscle testing has always fascinated me.  XK shows a slightly different way in muscle testing.  The physical and energetic releases shown were weak and not explained well.  It might be better to take the class in person but that is questionable.,1376352000,,245,4.926829268292683
8380125,1,B002TEKAEG,"I will sell you mine for $1 (bought it for $125) and I honestly don't think it's worth even that much! No educational content whatsoever, just some 'disturbed' person who hasn't been taking his psych meds rambling on and not making any sense. Some random person in the audience must have videotaped the crazy talks as the video quality and sound is very poor and changes from one setting to the next. Terrible! What a WASTE of time and money. There are 3 CDs but after watching the first one you will not touch the other two. So write up a check for ONE DOLLAR and mail it to me so can sell you my untouched copy! Just Don't buy this foolish video. Save your money!",1369699200,,665,4.285714285714286
8380126,5,B002TEKAEG,"Wow.  This DVD semimar is excellent.  I attended one of Dr. Gustafson's seminars many years ago and am so thankful that he has come out with a DVD to reference to.  I am not a doctor nor a practicing kineisolgist - I am a stay at home mother who is looking for ways to make life happier and healthier for my family and I have found it.  This is a wonderful set that lets you reference ideas and concepts over and over again - until you can understand them and relate them to your own life at your own pace.  The information that is covered is so, so amazing and yet most of it is common sense - you just need to think of things a little bit differently.  This DVD will forever change my life and the lives of those around me.  And I can't wait to keep watching it again and again and continue learning new things each time I see it.",1260316800,8,832,4.036585365853658
8380127,5,B002TEKAEG,"The DVD set, ""The Way of XK: The Wisdom Within"" with Dr. William Gustafson, blew me away! The premise---that the inner intelligence of the body system can guide the steps of healing and change---is a revolutionary shift away from treating symptoms. It will be welcomed by holistic, structural, and wellness practitioners and individuals who are interested in mind/body health. ""The Way of XK: The Wisdom Within"" takes us through a step-by-step process of using what Gustafson calls, ""XK Kinesiology"" to enter a treatment interaction without being inhibited by individual professional bias or judgment and then identify what the patient or client sequentially needs physically, chemically, and emotionally.

XK Kinesiology is based on the premise that the highest consciousness of the patient holds a wisdom that can guide treatment to help facilitate growth in the entire body/mind/emotion system. This simple, yet elegant system of muscle testing can be used by anyone and integrated into any practitioner's treatment approach. I especially appreciated the reference cards and practice slides provided on the DVD and the wonderful graphics. This is like being in a professional seminar with Dr. Gustafson where I could see him actually apply XK Kinesiology on people and then take questions from practitioners who are learning this process.

I have already tried XK Kinesiology--and have gotten wonderful results identifying nutritional supplements, structural needs, and emotional strategies. It's like talking to some inner wise part of the body! I'd recommend ""The Way of XK: The Wisdom Within"" DVD for anyone who wants a highly flexible, powerful system that gets us into deeper layers of treatment.",1260144000,6,1704,5.475285171102661
8380128,5,B002TEKAEG,"I've been waiting several years for a DVD series like this to come out.  The information has completely changed my life.  After all, I am one of the original participants and have been practicing the philosophies since the inception. If you want to change your life forever, buy the set.  While many kinesiology systems get more and more complicated, Dr. Gustafson has made them simpler and simpler.  He teaches you how to open up a dialogue with the innate intelligence that is running the body.  Do you want to experience miracles daily?  Do you want to stop treating problems and get down to the core of things?  If you answered yes place your order.

I will admit though that XK is not for everybody.  If you like to be in charge of everything and figure out every last detail it's not for you.  If you're a left brain thinker it's not for you.  Then again, buy it anyway.  You might learn something that will expand your mind and increase your results.  After all, that's what we're after isn't it?  Getting better results.

I will be forever indebted for the information I have learned from Dr. Gustafson.  The miracles and the magic it has brought to my life are astounding.",1259539200,8,1181,4.578947368421052
