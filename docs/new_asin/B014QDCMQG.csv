8731583,5,B014QDCMQG,"It was a good movie about addiction, shows how it can happen to anyone. I didn't realize that it was a true story until it was over and that made me appreciate that much more.
One of the main things to take away from this movie is that nothing is going to make an addict quit. When they feel that they've had enough, then they'll quit, and you never know what it's going to be that causes them to quit, they'll do it when they're ready. The best thing that a person can do for an addict is to be patient, help them to stay alive, and wait.",1506556800,,539,4.0
8731584,5,B014QDCMQG,"If youve ever had a good friend who continually made bad personal choices, this film will ring true for you. The movie follows Max Bornstein of New Jersey as he shuns an education at an Ivy League school and winds up as a driver for a producer of pornography. Max gets hooked on hard drugs and tries to hide his addiction from his wife and family. Its hard to believe that a smart, handsome guy with so much going for him can screw up so badly, but it happens. Ian Harding plays the part very well. The movie is fast paced, gut, and heart wrenching.",1500768000,,549,4.238095238095238
8731585,5,B014QDCMQG,"The story gave a true insight into the life of the main character. The movie takes unexpected turns and keeps you wondering is this going to end badly or is he going have a wake up call.  With what's going on in today's world it's a relevant story. It's a worthwhile viewing, however the content is too intense for children.  And most likely too graphic for most teens, unless you want to teach them about addiction and how life could be.  For those with addiction the movie can be inspirational.",1468713600,3,496,4.488888888888889
