8449711,3,B004ZG7RQK,"Hailing from Thailand, this was an ok horror flick. What made it worthwile for me are the 3 hotties. Another horror film having to do with cell phones...call this # and you die kinda thing. IMO this was one of the weakest out of that genre. This had too much more of comedy elements to really make me scared. The death scenes were cool, plenty of blood and violence. The CGI was kinda overdone at times on the death scenes. Like I said, the girls are what makes this movie worthwile.",1426550400,,483,4.318681318681318
