2199594,5,B00070HK2O,"The conflict between the two main characters seems at first one-sided, with the cynical, intellectual Burton more attractive than the stolid, uncertain Jurgens.  But by the end of the film, with one of the men dead, which is the better soldier and which the better man is not so clear.  It's a movie full of interesting, unanswered questions.

If you are intrigued by this brilliant and beautiful film where so much is left unsaid and unexplained, you will want to read James Harvey's chapter on Bitter Victory in his 2001 book Movie Love in the Fifties.  He relates the confusion and conflict from which this extraordinary movie arose and provides a detailed, shot-by-shot analysis of several important scenes.",1251072000,13,711,5.0

The desert is after all the main character of BITTER VICTORY, it's a place where men can't cheat and where they don't speak a lot. The scene of the scorpion is a model of the genre, the gazes of the characters at each other being the only dramatic stake of the scene.

2199596,4,B00070HK2O,"Richard Burton is at his best in this little war drama.

Unlike his later war movies, and other different ones, he starred in later on, he truly shines as an accomplished actor.

The support of German actor Curt Juergens has been a touch of class.

I won't reveal the contents of the movie, because it has to be watched as is.

Suffice it to say that it is a story about friendship, comraderie and betrayal, not forgetting cowardice.

I can only recommend it.

This is not a true war movie, in the conventional sense of the word, it it far more a story about human relationships during a war, just like ""The Hill"" by Sidney Lumet and starring Sean Connery and Harry Andrews, this is a social study and much less an actioner.

If you like to go deeper within the human soul, this one is truly yours.

I gave it 4 stars for its present DVD edition. The movie is well worth more, but I get the sensation that something is still missing (not from the movie), something like some interviews and a behind the scenes commentary for instance.

Buy it, it is well worth it.",1167782400,19,1064,4.3604060913705585

2199602,2,B00070HK2O,"Irrespective of director, Nicolas Ray's, `French New Wave' admirers this film simply doesn't make sense! Basically, it's a love triangle set during the desert campaign of World War II, between `Captain' Richard Burton's character, his erstwhile lover, Ruth Roman and her husband, South African `Major' Kurt Jurgens. The two men are sounded out to lead a commando mission in Libya. Burton is a well-qualified amateur who knows the territory, speaks fluent Arabic and can enlist the services of a native guide. Jurgens is a career officer with none of Burton's particular qualities relevant to this mission. It's decided that they will both go with Burton second in command.

At a social event prior to their leaving Jurgens `cottons on' to the fact that his wife and Burton used to be an item and as the mission progresses mutual animosity between the two men grows. However, it is never really established why Burton holds Jurgen's character in such contempt since he is only mildly contemptible, if that! To establish how contemptible he is the script has him hesitate when he needs to dispatch a German guard: Burton nips in slits the guard's throat! Okay, something of a drawback for soldier during a war and on a dangerous but vitally important mission but hesitating to kill another human being isn't contemptible in itself. There is very little other evidence of Jurgen's supposed lack of courage under fire and the only thing that Burton's contemptuous attitude does is instil, within this viewer at least, contempt for Burton's character.

If you want to see a very good war film set in the desert and starring Burton try The Desert Rats made 4 years earlier by Robert Wise.",1382572800,,1682,4.939929328621908

2199607,5,B00070HK2O,"So pessimistic even a lot of Ray cinephiles find this film difficult to respond to. Yet it's far
less dated than Rebel Without a Cause--and more interestingly complicated. Burton is fine--there's no chewing of the scenery--and the themes of courage, cowardice in various forms, cynicism & betrayal are deeply articulated not just in the script but in the many striking, sometimes mysterious images of the film. Finally this is a strange, troubling movie that deserves a wider audience.

Bravo to Michael Healey, the first reviewer here! I'm biased, since James Harvey is a friend of mine, but I'd second Healey's suggestion that you couple the viewing of this with Harvey's writing on Ray & ""Bitter Victory."" And, while you're at it, if you love the best movies from the 50's--& there were many--take a close look at Harvey's addictive, perceptive book. It was an interesting time. The studio system was breaking down, which provided room for a lot of smart, assertive directors to put their personal stamp on their films without studio interference.",1309564800,3,1050,5.069364161849711

Hot Toasty Rag, July 21, 2017

For 1957, Bitter Victory is a pretty graphic war movie. Its filmed in black and white, but bloodstains and bullet holes are shown, deaths are prolonged, and the suspense of war is captured well.

Curd Jurgens plays an officer in charge of a mission to German-controlled Benghazi during WWII. His second-in-command is Richard Burton, and since Burton is in love with Jurgenss wife, they don't have a very good working relationship. As interesting as this dynamic is, on and off the battlefield, the war scenes are where this movie really shines.

This is not your typical WWII movie where one randomly fired gun makes the bad guy fall over, and the good guy comes home with a tiny scratch on his forehead as a battle scar. These men are out in the desert, delirious from heat and dying from dehydration, unfamiliar with the terrain, fighting men, scorpions, and the sun, and forced to face worse situations than they thought possible. I won't spoil anything, but theres a very intense scene in which one soldier is dying and another soldier has to decide whether to shoot him and put him out of his misery or let him die a slow, painful death. Those scenes weren't generally filmed in 1957!

If you're used to lots of blood and torture in your war movies, you won't find this movie very exciting. But for a tasteful, classic war movie, its very good. Its one of the best war movies Ive seen. Plus, Richard Burton looks so incredibly handsome in his uniform. Ladies, youll definitely want to check this one out.",1500595200,,1566,4.663043478260869
