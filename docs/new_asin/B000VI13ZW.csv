8218684,2,B000VI13ZW,"Unfortunately, this is the same dvd as Preventions  Walk Yourself Fit Workout.  You would think that somewhere in the description it would state that it was previously packaged under a different name.  The ONLY difference is that in one section the clothes are different on the participants.  In one video she has and 'accelerated walk' which on the other dvd is called 'cardio walk'. Same workout, same people etc.  I am really angry about this.  In and of it self they aren't bad workouts, the walking is varied and not boring like some of these walks can be.  On the other hand, all participants are young and only one looks like she has any body fat whatsoever.  There are no modifications demonstrated, or even suggested.  I would not recommend this video on because of these issues. It seems like a shady practice IMO.  I plain to write the same review for the other video.",1486857600,5,879,4.64935064935065
8218685,5,B000VI13ZW,Just love this DVD!  I lost my first one and happy I found another.,1407628800,,67,3.7857142857142856
8218686,5,B000VI13ZW,This is an easy and effective workout video.  Most of it is very easy to follow which is a big plus.,1364515200,,100,3.761904761904762
8218687,5,B000VI13ZW,"I worked out to this at least 3x to 6x a week. I loved it. I loved how many routines you can choose from. It's clear, cuing is great and its fun.",1353110400,,145,3.5625
8218688,5,B000VI13ZW,"I call her ""Crazy Smiling Lady"". She has a joker's smile and wears it throughout the video which I realized was subconsciously making me smile. The workouts are energetic and fun. I also really like that she's obviously someone who had to exercise to get the body she has. You can tell she's not the girl who can put away a medium pizza by herself and not gain weight. She keeps me motivated. Just when I get to the point that I'm starting to get tired she says, ""You can do this!"" and I believe her. I've tried a lot of videos in the past and I now own several that I never use, but I use this one several times a week and I never get tired of it. There's also some good information on the video (aside from the workouts) on how to keep from hurting your feet and legs, when you know it's time for a new pair of walking shoes, and how to find the right step length for you. My Papa always said that walking was the best exercise, and it is, but now it's fun too. Try this video! I already have one but I'm going to buy one for my mom and one for my sister-in-law so they can be healthy and happy too.",1333756800,2,1101,3.986425339366516
8218689,3,B000VI13ZW,"I purchased this video hoping to change routines with my walking at home workout. I totally love Leslie's dvds but this video was very boring and the cues to change routines were awful. I found myself lost in the middle of the workout and frustrated. I did not finish the 20 minute session. I am disappointment because I like Chris Freytag's workouts,.",1327881600,3,352,4.693548387096774
8218690,5,B000VI13ZW,"THIS IS A GREAT DVD, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S SNOWING OR IT'S A RAINY DAY AND YOU CAN'T WALK OUTSIDE. FAST SHIPMENT",1282348800,,111,4.333333333333333
8218691,4,B000VI13ZW,"I, like the other reviewer recieved this DVD free with a subscription to Prevention magazine.  I too, was pleasently surprised.  I haven't done one of Prevention's workouts before.  There are 3 different workouts that are about 20 min. each. The instructor was good and the workouts fairly easy to follow.  Fitness videos are the only way I workout, and I have been through quite a few in the last 25 years.  These workout won't make an extreme athlete sweat, but for your average individual, they are nice for a short light workout.  This is one DVD I do actually expect to use.",1240272000,3,579,4.627450980392157
8218692,1,B000VI13ZW,Freytag is too stiff and bouncy (up and down fake walking) to be leading walk workouts. When she has a motivating word it is poorly timed and definitely scripted. This is not the first of her DVDs I have tried. She is bad in all of them that I have viewed to date. If you must have a Prevention workout go for the Flat Belly walking workout. Don't waste your money on this one!,1237075200,2,377,4.108108108108108
8218693,5,B000VI13ZW,"I received this DVD as a ""gift"" with my new subscription to prevention magazine. I assumed it was not going to be challenging because it was ""free"". Well, I am very pleased to say that I was wrong. I am unfamiliar with the instructor: Chris Freytag. However, I found her to be a very good instructor with great rhythm. She was motivating throughout the entire DVD and never became unnecessarily annoying.
There are three workouts included on the DVD each running about 15 min:
1. Walking workout which is the least challenging of all three but still gets you moving. This consists of general walking, leg lifts and side steps. She does variations however, which I was unfamiliar with.
2. The accelerated walking workout is the second workout. You walk a mile doing 4 segments. Each segment consists of three minutes of power walking and one minute of accelerated burn.
3. The body sculpting workout which follows the same pattern as the accelerated workout except instead of the minute burnout there is a minute of weight lifting.
I would suggest this video to anyone of any size and fitness level. Even if you are in great shape this is still an excellent workout for a light day. This video is challenging and fun. It sometimes even feels like a dance video. I am very pleased and will add it into my at home rotation.",1210982400,11,1320,4.645299145299146
