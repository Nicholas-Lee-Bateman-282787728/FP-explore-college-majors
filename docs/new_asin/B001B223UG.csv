3479879,2,B001B223UG,"This is not a production for the ages but for the Royal Ballet, perhaps. Instead, check out the two best Sleeping Beauties--the 2006 Paris Opera Ballet DVD and the 2001 Kirov Ballet DVD (with Larissa Lezhnina as Aurora). The dancing and production values of the French and Russian versions are superlative in all respects. The choreography of this English version is abridged, slow, dignified, not well executed and, well, boring, with several dancers plain embarrassing (eg, the Bluebird duet). To see what the Royal Ballet used to be capable of, check out the Evening with the Royal Ballet DVD, which features ACT III of Sleeping Beauty with Margot Fonteyn from 1962. At age 40, Dame Margot was an order of magnitude better than a twenty-something Cojocaru.",1221523200,10,759,5.031746031746032
3479880,2,B001B223UG,"At the time of this writing, there are two other reviews of this performance of ""The Sleeping Beauty."" (More have been added between that time and this editing of my original review) One reviewer divided her review into four sections: the production, the choreography, the dancers and the video quality. I won't repeat, or cover the same ground that she did, except for the fact that she did comment upon the fact that many previous recordings had been severely abridged. What was she thinking when she reviewed this DVD? EVERY DVD has been abridged, some more or less than others. Therefore, I would like to add a fifth category that was overlooked: the QUANTITY of music.
  Tchaikovsky's music for ""The Sleeping Beauty"" is nothing short of magnificent. There is no more beautiful ballet music. It is an atrocity to have so much of this beautiful music excised from any production, especially from one by a world-renowned ballet company such as The Royal Ballet. In this DVD, the Prologue and Act I contain most of the music that Tchaikovsky had written for them, but Acts II and III were completely emasculated. Dance after dance was either totally eliminated or substantially shortened. Perhaps the most beautiful piece of music in this entire ballet is the Entr'acte at the end of Scene 1 of Act II. It is a rhapsody for violin and orchestra that is simply mesmerizing. There have been many live performances during which the audience broke into applause for the orchestra's violinist for his/her magnificent solo work. This Entr'acte is one of the many missing pieces in this DVD. If you will pardon my language, that is an abomination. The Royal Ballet, in this DVD eliminates not only this magnificent Entr'acte, but also the Marche at the beginning of Act III, a beautiful march that is a wonderful introduction to the wedding.
  I realize that there is no live performance of this ballet that contains absolutely all the music that Tchaikovsky wrote for it. Every ballet company from the Bolshoi and Kirov to local companies eliminate or shorten some of the dances. But this Royal Ballet production has gone further than one would expect from such a world-renowned ballet company.
  My favorite recording of this marvelous ballet would probably be the Bolshoi recording with Nina Semizorova as Aurora and an absolutely fantastic Yuri Vetrov as Carabosse (I would probably prefer the Altynai Aslymuratova performance with the Kirov Ballet, but that has not yet been released on DVD. Besides the marvelous dancing, this version has more of Tchaikovsky's music than any DVD or VHS that I have seen. On the negative side, however, is the lighting. Whoever was in charge should have been shot. Most of the Prologue and many sections of Acts I-III are in a bluish-purple light that makes the stage so dark that it is almost impossible to see what is happening.). Miss Semizorova is not the most beautiful looking of ballerinas, but that does not detract from her dancing. As to Yuri Vetrov (see also my review of ""The Nutcracker"" in which he plays Drosselmeyer), I have never seen a Carabosse that comes even close to his interpretation. Watching him is worth the price of the DVD by itself. The ballerina playing Carabosse in this Royal Ballet DVD comes across to me as a mean prankster. Yuri Vetrov projects evil personified. However, unfortunately that version also eliminates the Entr'acte previously mentioned and, also, the Marche at the beginning of Act III. Nothing is perfect. The Kirov, in 1999, performed the absolutely complete ballet as Tchaikovsky wrote it (as near as possible since some of the choreography is lost), but I am unaware of any recording of this version, and my e-mail to the Kirov (now Mariinsky) has gone unanswered.
  More than one reviewer has stated that a woman is better suited to the role of Carabosse than a man. Neither position is right or wrong. It is simply a matter of opinion. You will notice, however, that a man usually plays the role of Widow Simone in ""La Fille Mal Gardee,"" and men play the parts of the two step-sisters in Frederick Ashton's version of ""Cinderella."" It is my opinion, and I emphasize that this is an opinion, that a man adds something to these roles that a woman cannot. Take your choice. Form your own opinion.
  I give this DVD two stars which represent the fact that the picture quality, the sets and costumes, and the music that this production does in fact contain are wonderful. I hope that my editing has made this review a little more useful to you.",1220918400,65,4527,4.829677419354839
3479881,5,B001B223UG,"Since what I consider the best staging of SLEEPING BEAUTY (by former Royal Opera Ballet stars Ronald Hynd & Annette Page), with the most beautiful costume/scenic design to match (Peter Docherty), and the best Aurora I've ever seen (Kaori Nakamura) is on film under lock and key in the library of Pacific NW Ballet in Seattle - with no indication that it will be released to the public - this Royal Opera production from 2006 will have pride of place as the one I will watch the most frequently from now on.

I think this production is better than the previous ROB production from the '90s with Viviana Durante as Aurora and Benazir Hussein as the Lilac Fairy. As fantastic as Durante was, Alina Cojocaru makes a perfect Princess, and she sails through the Rose Adagio with the brilliance that Durante did. Just as adorable a stage presence as Cojocaru is Marianela Nunez, who would make a very good Aurora herself. While I thought  similarities of dancing & personality were easy to see between Durante and Cojocaru, the contrast between Nunez's Lilac Fairy and Hussein's is stark. Hussein was regal, maybe a little bit maternal. Nunez eminates too much exuberant youth & gaiety to exhibit any maternity. I suppose that some may prefer Hussein's style, feeling that with Cojocaru and Nunez you almost have two Auroras. I loved both together in these roles, this has to be one of the best duos of all the  SLEEPING BEAUTYS on video. This is a beautiful, traditional, full-length setting with the original Petipa choreography, and less tweaks than Anthony Dowell tossed into the mix for the '94 production. As a traditional staging, expect colorful costumes in the style of the Sun King court era, backdrops of old castles and forests, everything very attractive to the eyes. You won't see any of those rather strange scenic designs from the '94 production, like that weird staircase that looked like an airport runway (...insert whoops of joy or sighs of relief here).

Camera work is as fine as it was for last year's SYLVIA revival with the departed Bussell, the music is amongst the greatest in ballet history, and this orchestra is at the top of its class. This is a wonderful version and with the way star ballerinas may jump to other companies unexpectedly (my local ballet lost their star soloist to Monte Carlo this past spring), one never knows whether we'll see Cojocaru & Nunez dance together on any other DVDs in the future. An easy recommendation.",1218931200,14,2459,4.806146572104019

The prelude, Act I, and Act II are all great and feature dancing that is not just technically brilliant, but actually works well dramatically. Cojocaru is great at emoting with her dancing, and the love between her and Prince Florimund felt real to me.

Unfortunately, Act III just felt like a complete afterthought. I really think this ballet could end with Act II, and you should feel free to do so when watching it on DVD.

So much work went into this production that I am very happy such a high quality DVD was made of it, so that we can all enjoy it for years to come.",1415318400,,658,4.341463414634147

3479900,3,B001B223UG,"I suspect that had I attended this performance at Covent Garden then I would have been generally pleased with it but as a document to be lived with, it is a real disappointment .  I had been looking forward to seeing Alina Cojacaru do Aurora as I have seen her in other roles and she is a great dancer but here she seems to be having an off night (she even falls off pointe in the Rose Adagio - granted that can happen to anyone).  I don't know if it was the rather flacid and slower tempi adopted by the conductor, Valeriy Ovsyanikov, but there seems to a general sense of everyone going through the motions but not being involved.  Genesia Rosato's Carabosse is a perfect example, she gives little sense of the menace of the character.  To see how Carabosse can - should be done, find the Royal Ballet YouTube video of the almost 70 year old Monica Mason demonstrating it while rehearsing a young dancer.  This is not to say that there are no good performances here, Marianela Nunez does an excellent Lilac Fairy and Federico Bonelli is a better than average Prince.  The fairies in the prolog do a good job, as do the various character dancers.  While I don't much care for Ovsyanikov's interpretation of the score, the orchestra is excellent.

As to the current version that the Royal Ballet is performing, this version is mostly a return to that done in the late 1940s but with a few updates.  The prolog and act 1 are as expected with the exception of a new garland dance .  The second act is also conventional but sadly does not include Sir Frederick Ashton's marvelous Awakening Pas de Deux at the end (why?).  Act 3 has the standard dances but paradoxically seems rather rushed and with little sense of celebration.

After watching this and wondering if my frustration was the result of a grumpy mood, I pulled out an old video tape of the Royal Ballet doing Sleeping Beauty in the late 1970s with Merle Park and David Wall, Marguerite Porter as the Lilac Fairy, Jennifer Penney in the Bluebird Pas de Deux and Monica Mason as Carabosse.  While the video quality left something to be desired, the difference was apparent from the first downbeat, the entire company seemed to be thoroughly inhabiting and enjoying their roles.  Lest you wonder if I am one of those who doesn't like anything new, a quick check of YouTube videos with Lauren Cuthbertson doing Aurora showed that the company can still generate that spark.

Technically, the audio and video quality and lighting and other production standards are on a par with the best, but overall an average performance and not one that I have much interest in revisiting.  It does not represent what the Royal Ballet can do, and that is a shame.",1388620800,4,2703,4.588357588357589

3479904,5,B001B223UG,"The Sleeping Beauty Ballet by the Royal Ballet is sweet, spectacular, and satisfying to watch.  Although it is Tchaikovskys more sleepy ballet without neither the excitement of a Christmas eve sword-fight between a Nutcracker-Prince and a Mouse King nor the drama of a Prince having to choose a wife that ends in a swans suicide, The Sleeping Beauty Ballet is a more elegant and fundamental form of storytelling.  The beaux arts score of Tchaikovsky pristinely fits the storyline of a princess who falls asleep when a spell is placed upon her only to be awakened with a kiss from a handsome Prince.  The dancing in this particular production by The Royal Ballet is reflective of their excellent tradition, with a high degree of precision and elegant formulation.  The whole production, from the costumes to the scenery to the music to the storyline, all have a colorful softness that is most appealing.  A stunning solo dance by the sleeping beauty to the accompaniment of a solo violin in Part I is complemented by an exquisite duo between the sleeping beauty and the handsome Prince to the accompaniment of a solo viola in Part 2.  The final pas de deux between the pair is spectacular and is performed to the accompaniment of an oboes plaintiff wail and the descending scales of a piano.  This beautiful production by The Royal Ballet shows that while Tchaikovsky was the master of overblown drama, he was also the master of understated grandness.",1378252800,9,1450,4.869918699186992

3479906,5,B001B223UG,"Unlike Swan Lake which I have 10 versions (unfortunately non have won me over completely, wait a minute, Ulyana Lopatkina is a very beautiful swan and her prince Danila Korsuntsev is quite good also: this is the Mariinsky Ballet, under the direction of Valery Gergiev version, I want to say that this version is quite satisfactory for me), for Sleeping Beauty, I have 4 versions, and I have to say the one I am reviewing is to my uncritical taste very satisfactory.  Alina Cojocaru, Marianela Nunez, and the prince  of Federico Bonelli are all very good, especially Marianela is a very outstanding Swan, but I don't have her dvd, I saw her perfomance on YouTube. The rest of the cast generally are very good also.

Alina Cojocaru is well cast, she is young enough for the role, and she certainly is an excellent dancer.  Marianela is a very  celestial fairly queen, and Bonelli is a handsome prince.

I have to say that the whole production keeps me interested  throughout:  I would of course recommend to whoever is interested in buying Sleeping Bueaty, this is the version to spend your precious money.

3479911,5,B001B223UG,"This 2006 performance and recording of the Royal Ballet's Sleeping Beauty has achieved a level of popular success that it could almost be described as having reached cult status. The only issue to decide is whether it deserves this level of popular support. The short answer, in my opinion, is a resounding 'Yes'!

In greater detail therefore:

Having owned several visual productions of note of this ballet I can truthfully say that this has completely replaced all the others with some ease. The staging is traditionally sumptuous with no expense spared on the glorious costumes. The backdrops and general settings are of the same order. The only similar attention to detail and visual beauty that I have seen previously has been by the Kirov ballet. Perhaps the additions to Petipa's original choreography by such luminaries as Frederick Ashton, Anthony Dowell and Christopher Wheeldon provide part of the answer.

As regards the dancers themselves - this particular recording has the benefit of many outstanding artists who perfectly fit their roles. In particular Alina Cojocaru and Marianela Nunez make a perfect coupling of Princess Aurora and the Lilac Fairy demonstrating limitless grace and charm. Genesia Rosato's enthusiastic portrayal of her role as Carabosse is a delight and Alastair Marriott clearly has a great time in his somewhat extravagant costume with spectacular feathery hat! Federico Bonelli lends appropriate support as Prince Florimund.

The corps de ballet and numerous supporting fairies, members of the Court and the character dancers are all equally excellent in their roles which are too many to itemise here. Suffice it to say that this is a state of the art production of the Royal Ballet at its very best.

The imaging is crisp with fully involving camera work providing excellent colour rendition without a trace of movement blur. The sound is provided in faithful PCM 5.1 surround and stereo formats. Initially this may seem a little dry but the ear quickly adjusts to the correct acoustics of a packed theatre with masses of soft clothing to soak up reverberation which fortunately has not been added artificially to compensate.

The bonuses are limited to an illustrated synopsis and a cast gallery. There are interesting sleeve notes giving some historical perspective to the development of the ballet from its inception to the present.

It all adds up to an unbeatable combination which fully warrants its lasting popularity. This will be the dream recording for a great number of purchasers and as such can only be rated with any seriousness as a clear 5 star issue.",1341532800,5,2608,5.136792452830188
3479912,1,B001B223UG,I don't want a new creation.  I want the one with Monica Mason as Carabous. That production was shown on PBS many years ago and my tape is wearing out. I need a copy on DVD. If they release that version I'll buy it in a heartbeat.  NOBODY does Carabous like Monica Mason. The rest of that production is just as good as anything done currently if not better than the new stuff.,1326844800,,376,4.136986301369863

3479916,3,B001B223UG,"Not being able to get to London, I was very much looking forward to this DVD. It seems to me that the production is always on the verge of being terrific but never quite gets there, certainly not on this evidence. The text is beautifully presented, the performances are always good, sometimes (Cojocaru, Bonelli, Lamb, Morera)outstanding, the famous sets as seen in so many photographs seem beautifully re-created. So why do I feel disappointed? I think the main reason is in the musical direction - it's often too slow. Where the music should generate excitement, the tempi are often leisurely; in the middle of a good fast tempo, the conductor will suddenly put the brakes on for a gently-shaded sequence, and then pick up speed again. I believe this tendency, In Act 1, goes against Cojocaru creating a sparkling Aurora. The Rose Adagio, ensuing solo and exultant coda are all taken at moderate pace, so much so that the dancer clearly has time on her hands and adds extra pirouettes or little affectations of the head and hands which serve to weaken the general impression. In the diagonal coda, she has time to pose in the jump sequence before taking off again, when the impression should be of a whirlwind of happy movement. The Messel sets look severely underlit, and the costumes by Peter Farmer are a symphony of let's-not-offend-anyone pastels. Can't fault the DVD direction, though, it's beautifully done.",1255219200,7,1416,4.904166666666667
3479917,5,B001B223UG,"Seeing this version reminds me of what happens when you buy a new television. One set may look to have all you might want, but put it alongside others in the shop and differences appear which change your mind. My view of this work falls into the first category- to accept it for what it is as a production filmed of a company that has been performing it for a very long time and as a star vehicle for Margot Fonteyn in her heyday. Now it's Alina Cojocaru's turn and she shines in the title role of a performance which hits all the right notes in a cheerful rendition of this old favourite. This is a fairy story well told, well acted,well costumed and well danced with an excellent surround soundtrack. What is also remarkable is that two other dancers could equally have stepped into the lead role and acquitted themselves with distinction- Marianela Nunez (the Lilac Fairy) and Sarah Lamb in the Bluebird divertissement. Both were exceptionally good and Sarah Lamb gave us a brief dynamic glimpse of what she can offer in a major role. Compared to how well Cojocaru carried off the Rose Adagio (beautifully) it can only be a pleasant thought as to how Sarah Lamb would have interpreted it. Other characterisations are also convincing and well presented-Federico Bonelli is a handsome dashing Prince who partners Cojocaru seamlessly, while Genesia Rosato is a suitably manic Carabosse whose rats are a real hit- they are superb and nearly steal the show. The minor roles are carried off well and the whole production has a good look and feel to it so this is a good buy. Caveats ? A few which are of little account as no one is going to return and amend the production because of viewer's opinions, but yes the music has been interfered with (yet again) and there are cuts which irritate the knowledgeable. And again I make the point that close-ups are unnatural by showing perspiration and heaving chests which work against the illusion being created all of a piece onstage. They also tend to miss key events happening elsewhere and I for one prefer to see the whole scene as I would at a live performance.
Family members who saw this at the ROH also mentioned this which reminded them of how much better the live version was (which it always is of course).In a similar way, considering how important dancers' feet are in what they do,showing only threequarter views of the body is criminal and should be a key issue in Camerawork 101. There are not many of these transgressions but one is too many for me. So should you buy it ? Well I say yes if you want an excellent example of the Royal Ballet style shown well in one of their key traditional productions- and on that basis it fits in very well with the other versions I have from the Bolshoi,POB,Kirov et al. And that is not faint praise but be ready for the differences when you make comparisons with the others and join the debate about what is the best overall version.",1253318400,9,2929,4.55977229601518
3479918,4,B001B223UG,"Tchaikovsky is one of the few composers who has ballets, operas, symphonies, concertos for piano and violin in the repertoire of major theaters in the world. His specialty is the melody, a descendant of the Russian tradition folk vein makes it special to Western ears.

Stand out in his work the 6 symphonies that reach their peak on Friday, known as the Pathetique, the operas Eugene Onegin and Queen of Spades staged today in the great houses of the lyrical world and a unique musical beauty. The delicacy of the Concerto for Violin and Orchestra and the 3 ballets, The Nutcracker Christmas ballet tradition, the Swan Lake with its catchy tune and Sleeping Beauty.

Ballet immediate success showed the supremacy of Tsarist Russia in the dance. Just so that they mimicked the French culture, to speak French was fashionable in the Russian nobility of the nineteenth century, the cultural imitators surpassed the masters. But enough talk and let the video in question.

Covent Garden presents us with a new production of this ballet, dated 2006. Luxury and refinement are essential in this work, let us not forget that the story takes place in court where nobles parade with all the pomp and circumstance. The London stage follows this rule, the fancy costumes and the scenery is perceptible in every detail, but without exaggeration, it is easy to create excesses that tend to geekiness. Soft pastels give charm and show the good taste of the producers. The choreography follows the Petipa produced by the small changes that give more impetus to work.

The music of the ballet is simple, sweet, sometimes naive, that does not mean easy to be touched. The orchestra of Covent Garden makes the score look easy such is the dexterity with which they implement the work. The conductor Valery Ovsyanikov captures the essence of the melody of Tchaikovsky, right time and in tune with the dance.

Alina Cojocaru lends ingenuity and beauty Princess Aurora, her dancing is safe, strong and delicate at the same time. Sutil in the first act, virtuous in the third, performs the difficult variations with good control. But lack the thrill of the great dancers (remember many actors of the network world) you can compare your views with Margot Fonteyn in 1955. Frederico Bonelli is a noble prince in the prime of youth, just right. The Lilac Fairy of Marianela Nuez has technique, grace and sweetness that excited about their pirouettes.

The main focus is for the Evil Fairy, Carabosse. In other versions a dancer interprets it, but who takes that role is our friend Genesia Rosato. It makes a villain the height of the Fairy of Evil, also overcomes this with their dark expressions, his stride and his cynical smile. A villain to fall in love.

DVDs of the Opus Arte label are exquisite quality, image and sound quality, easy to use menu with a choice of scenes. Booklet in English, French and German (not in Portuguese). Who likes ballet and wants to have a modern version of the work I recommend the DVD. Who cares more about the dance and give up sound quality and visual recommend the version with the Kirov Irina Kolpakova, Sergei Berezhnoi. This complete and very well choreographed and danced with all the weight of the tradition of Russian ballet. Too bad for modern technology of today is a little vencida. Mas this is a topic for another DVD.

PRIMEIRO BAL DE TCHAIKOVSKY DE SUCESSO.

  Tchaikovsky  um dos poucos compositores que tem bals, peras, sinfonias, concertos para piano e para violino no repertrio dos grandes teatros do mundo. Sua especialidade  a melodia, descendente da tradio russa sua veia folclrica faz dela especial aos ouvidos ocidentais.

  Destacam-se na sua obra as 6 sinfonias que atingem o auge na sexta, conhecida como Pattica, as peras Eugene Onegin e a Dama de Espadas encenadas at hoje nas grandes casas lricas do mundo e de uma beleza musical mpar. A delicadeza do Concerto para Violino e Orquestra e os 3 bals, Quebra Nozes bal de tradio natalina, o Lago dos Cisnes com sua msica envolvente e a Bela Adormecida.

  Bal de sucesso imediato mostrou a supremacia da Rssia Czarista na dana. Justamente eles que tanto imitavam a cultura francesa, falar francs era elegante na nobreza russa do sculo XIX , os imitadores culturais superaram os mestres. Mas chega de conversa e vamos ao vdeo em questo.

  O Covent Garden nos apresenta uma nova produo desse bal, datada de 2006. Luxo e requinte so imprescindveis nessa obra, no nos esqueamos que a histria se passa na corte onde desfilam nobres com toda a pompa e circunstncia. O teatro londrino segue essa regra, o capricho no cenrio e figurinos  perceptvel em cada detalhe, mas sem exagero,  fcil criar excessos que tendem para a cafonice. Tons pastis leves do charme e demonstram o bom gosto dos produtores. A coreografia segue a elaborada por Petipa com pequenas modificaes que do melhor dinmica a obra.

  A msica do bal  simples, adocicada ,as vezes ingnua, o que no quer dizer fcil de ser tocada. A orquestra do Covent Garden faz a partitura parecer fcil tamanha  a destreza com que executam a obra. O regente Valeriy Ovsyanikov capta a essncia da melodia de Tchaikovsky ,tempos corretos e em sintonia com a dana.

  Alina Cojocaru empresta ingenuidade e beleza a Princesa Aurora, sua dana  segura, firme e ao mesmo tempo delicada. Sutil no primeiro ato, virtuosa no terceiro, executa as difceis variaes com bom controle. Mas falta a emoo das grandes bailarinas (lembra muitos atores da rede globo) basta compararmos sua exibio com a de Margot Fonteyn em 1955. Frederico Bonelli faz um prncipe nobre no auge da juventude, correto apenas. A Fada Lils de Marianela Nuez tem tcnica segura, graa e doura que empolga com suas piruetas.

  O principal destaque fica para a Fada do Mal, Carabosse.  Em outras verses um bailarino a interpreta, mas nessa quem assume o papel  nossa amiga Genesia Rosato. Faz uma vil a altura da Fada do Mal, alis supera isso com suas expresses tenebrosas, seus passos largos e seu sorriso cnico. Uma vil para se apaixonar.

  Os DVDs do selo Opus Arte so de qualidade primorosa, imagem e som excelentes, menu da fcil manuseio  com a escolha de cenas. Encarte em ingls, francs e alemo (nunca em portugus) . Quem gosta de bal e quer ter uma verso moderna da obra recomendo o DVD. Quem se importa mais com a dana e abre mo da qualidade sonora e visual recomendo a verso do Kirov com Irina Kolpakova, Sergei Berezhnoi. Essa completa , muito bem danada e coreografada e com todo o peso da tradio do bal russo. Pena que para as modernidades tecnolgicas de hoje fica um pouco vencida. Mas isso  assunto para outro DVD.

3479920,4,B001B223UG,"I thought a lot before I bought this production.  I actually saw it live at the Kennedy Center during the summer before this was recorded and I was so disappointed.  I had waited so long to see the Royal Ballet perform Sleeping Beauty live.
I ought to say here I'm one of probably a few who actually like the Anthony Dowell 1993 production.  I think Viviana Durante was amazing and Dowell himself as Carabosse gave the performance of the ages.  I wasn't that nuts about the scenery but thought the costumes (especially those in Act 3) were great.
I think the company was just having an off day when I saw the live production.  It was a very hot summer day and, to be kind, maybe the heat and humidity was getting to them all.  The whole group lacked energy, Sarah Lamb was uninspiring as Aurora.  There was nothing between her and her Prince and the Elizabeth McGorian's Carabosse (she normally plays the Queen) looked and acted like she was a little annoyed because she hadn't been invited to a tea party.
Though I suspect Durante with her steely toed performance is much more comparable to Fonteyn, I like this performance and Cojocaru a lot.  In fact I like the whole cast a lot and Sarah Lamb is very good as Blue Bird.  Cuts in the music don't disturb me too much since almost all the companies take liberties in that area.
Like one of the other reviewers I'm also a fan of the Kirov version with Asylmuratova (and her husband Zaklinsky) but it was recorded at the Bolshoi Theatre and is so dark in places.  (Have others noticed that this is often the case with performances recorded at the Bolshoi?) So far it is only on VHS and I've wondered if it will ever come out on DVD because of the quality of the recording.
Anyway, for Sleeping Beauty fans it's well worth having.  Since so little of the original production is available today (Act 3 on the ""Evening With The Royal Ballet"" DVD, a severely cut black and white version filmed for American TV and bits on the Margot DVD) this is the best chance to get an idea of what the original was like.",1226016000,36,2052,4.416445623342175
3479921,4,B001B223UG,"I have always been a great fan of Alina Cojacaru. So right when this DVD came out I had to buy it. Alina and Frederico were great as Aurora and Prince Desiree. A perfect match and technique, beautiful and handsome, great as always. The Rose Adagio was just so charming and graceful. Everything was perfect except for one thing. The film was taken like you were sitting all the way in the back row and could not see their facial expression, which is important as well so that you can have the feeling of you being there with them. It was so small and I had to squint just to see them at times. However, the DVD is still worth buying and adding to your collection, especially if you are a fan of Alina and Frederico. The Royal Ballet will never disappoint you.",1223596800,20,758,4.3076923076923075
