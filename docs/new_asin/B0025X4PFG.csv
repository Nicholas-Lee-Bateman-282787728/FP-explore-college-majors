3850056,4,B0025X4PFG,"Video quality horrible. Audio horrible.
Narration beyond horrible. So why 4 stars?
Because these are the real-deal/old-ways Natives and they are on film.
Men & women in their 50's-70's means these folks survived the American Holocaust escaping to Canada to live.
Yes, they are ""acting"" for the camera, but these early records are so rare.
After satisfying your curiousity about the soundtrack, just watch it without sound and observe the beautiful people.
Watching Baluk wrestle two bear cubs bare-handed, wearing nothing but a breech-cloth or fight a pack of wolves & kill a moose with a stick(spear) must be seen to be appreciated. The man's physique alone makes one appreciate these people's natural prowness...and why europeans were so intimidated.",1254355200,54,752,5.3277310924369745
3850081,1,B0025X4PFG,One of the worst films ever!  Purchased on other reviews star rating. Unfortunate I cannot get money back - nothing but the garbage can for this.,1395273600,,145,4.576923076923077
3850082,5,B0025X4PFG,"While the movie was stylized for the time, it still shows scenes of what life was like for some natives at the time of filming.  I thank those who converted this rare film to DVD",1354147200,,178,4.085714285714285
3850083,4,B0025X4PFG,Enjoyed seeing actual Native Americans as actors in this movie.  Very insightful little movie.  Would recommend for those that do not know too much about some of the Native American cultures and previous way of life,1346976000,2,215,4.944444444444445
3850084,1,B0025X4PFG,"The Silent Enemy is a fascinating and important film.

Unfortunately, the version being sold by Alpha Home Entertainment is not the restored version of the 1930 original, but a severely shortened and dumbed-down version edited for American elementary school audiences. You can only imagine the results.

While the Amazon description says 90 minutes, what I received is the 56-minute version. All of the intertitles have been removed and replaced by simplistic, offensive and generally terrible narration.

Look instead for the restored Milestone Films version, if you can find one.",1323648000,28,581,5.50561797752809
3850085,5,B0025X4PFG,I loved this movie as it gave me an insight into the way of life and rituals of the Native American Indian during this period,1316217600,3,125,4.04
3850086,2,B0025X4PFG,"Plot and story line was good. If you like reading subtitles the whole movie and like old black and white films, you might like this one. I don't recommend buying it.",1294704000,3,165,4.354838709677419
3850087,5,B0025X4PFG,"I deeply appreciated the look back into the past.
The film basically holds to the Ojibwa Indian culture, but if you know what to look for and recognize, you will detect bits of the 'whiteman's' influence.
Being Native American myself, I'm sure that this film has more meaning to me than to those of other races.",1293494400,10,311,4.571428571428571
3850088,2,B0025X4PFG,"It may have been an epic in 1930 but not now.

3850089,5,B0025X4PFG,"..if you have any interest in primitive cultures or Native Americans.  It is truly an extraordinary film, almost mind-boggling.  I saw the second half by accident on TCM and immediately bought it.  The other reviews will give you an idea of what it is about, but it must be seen to be fully appreciated.  And the fact that it is a silent film makes no difference whatsoever because the images are what makes it so worthwhile.  While you're watching just remember that there were no special effects whatsoever used.  As I said, mind-boggling!",1277769600,22,541,4.763440860215054
3850090,5,B0025X4PFG,"It is nice to know that some things endure the test of time. This film was produced nearly eight decades ago and there is still an interest in it. With today's over the top productions, it is nice to see something made during simpler times that is just as entertaining and informative.",1256428800,24,285,4.5

8351401,5,B0025X4PFG,"I liked this video - subject was filmed in the 1930 and narrated silent film style, but after you get used to that difference it is entertaining and I'd like to think in some ways educational. Actors are Native American and story is interesting. I'd like to see the original version. Keep in mind this film was before humane society oversight and there are real animals in real predicaments which can be disturbing if you are so inclined. I recommend the movie since we get to see so few movies on Native American life enacted by Native Americans.",1499817600,,547,4.591836734693878

8351403,3,B0025X4PFG,"It is good, and I enjoyed it .. I learned a few more things about the native americans ... I didn't know it was so old ... not that it matters ... I did enjoy it, but not enough to watch it often ... I have been trying to find new native american films, which I know are out there but,when I try to find them, Amazon doesn't seem to have them ... why not?",1453939200,,355,3.7466666666666666

8351406,3,B0025X4PFG,"It's not what I expected, I would not recommend this one. I will say that
I appreciate what the American Indian went through. I was looking for
a full length movie. This may not be what you're",1421539200,,192,4.216216216216216
8351407,5,B0025X4PFG,VERY EARLY American Indian movie!!!! A good collector's keep!,1412726400,,61,5.888888888888889

8351409,5,B0025X4PFG,This film is an old original movie.  Colour hadn't quite made it.  A good story but with no high tech stuff to drive you speechless.  The story has to do that and it does.  A tale of a tribe that is confronted with choices.  Does it go and try the winter or stay in the safe and starve?  A good story.,1398729600,,301,3.8524590163934427
