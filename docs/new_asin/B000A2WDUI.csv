This DVD is a great collection of not only the best Brazilian singers, but it also pays homage to one of the best Brazilian Rock singers of all time. Raul Seixas, to whom the show is dedicated to, is probably one of the best known Brazilian singers who had a great influence on the Brazilian Rock scene during the 1970s. After his death, his music still continues to inspire generations of Brazilian fans and singers alike. Interestingly enough, Raul Seixas also held a musical partnership with the now-famous author Paulo Coelho. Some of the songs that came out of the Seixas/Coelho partnership are featured on this DVD, including the songs ""Sociedade Alternativa"" and ""Gita."" If you are looking for an excellent tribute concert from Brazil, look no further. ""O Ba do Raul"" is a show you will never forget.",1347580800,,936,4.644578313253012
