2656181,5,B000IHYRXQ,My two year old just got this for his second birthday and he will watch it with us but not alone yet. This is with any video though. I think he will love it by the time he's 2 1/2. He really loves construction type trucks like these. Yours will too. L.W. Wilm,1174262400,,259,3.9056603773584904
2656182,4,B000IHYRXQ,"Lots of action and big machines munching on old cars, we had many discussions later and he reinacts some of the scenes in playtime.",1171324800,,131,4.5
2656183,5,B000IHYRXQ,This series is terrific.  All the trucks a kid could want to see.  My son loves it.  Wonderful idea.  Would love to see more.,1161734400,,125,4.083333333333333
2656184,5,B000IHYRXQ,"We got all three dvds in this series for our nephew (2) because, like a lot of boys around his age, he seems obsessed with large industrial vehicles.  He watched these dvds in something like a trance.  There are educational elements cleverly slipped into the action, but mostly it's trucks doing all kinds of cool, trucky things I didn't even know about.",1158883200,2,354,4.693548387096774
2656185,5,B000IHYRXQ,"It's such a simple yet brilliant concept. Just give little boys what they want...TRUCKS. Real trucks, big trucks, every kind of truck and machine you can think of. The footage is put together in a fast and fun format that grabs their attention and holds it. My son loved the videos and keeps coming back for repeat viewings. You owe it to yourself to try them.",1158537600,,360,4.46969696969697
2656186,5,B000IHYRXQ,"Too cool!! I liked this one.  My grandson sat as quietly as I have ever seen him and when it was over pressed the button to repeat and repeat.  This set of  "" totally trucks ""  dvds is over the top.  Thanks to whoever made them.",1158537600,2,228,3.869565217391304
8145438,5,B000IHYRXQ,"Birthday present for grandson and he loves anything to do with trucks, excavators, back hoes etc.  Very pleased.",1451865600,,112,5.222222222222222

8145441,4,B000IHYRXQ,"downloaded this for my toddler son who is obsessed with trucks. decent photography and songs, he enjoyed watching a few times but nothing I would buy permanently but good for a rental",1392508800,,183,4.75
8145442,5,B000IHYRXQ,these videos are so well received by every little 2-4 year old boy I purchase them for.  great gift idea,1374364800,,104,4.2
8145443,5,B000IHYRXQ,"My 2 yo son LOVES all things trucks.  We have the other 4 titles from ""Totally Trucks"" and he can't decide which one he loves the best.  Simple video, nothing preachy or too focused on cramming a ton of educational material into a short video.  This one covers counting along with describing the various trucks and what they do.  Great for kids up to approx. age 5, then they aren't as interested.  This mama recommends it!",1363824000,,423,4.5131578947368425
8145444,3,B000IHYRXQ,too short but it is good for what it is.. Ive seen this movie within other movies careful of what u purchase,1361145600,,108,3.9545454545454546
8145445,5,B000IHYRXQ,My 4 year old son LOVES the DVD Metal Monsters as well the Garbage Monsters and Dirt Monsters. He watches it over and over again and particularly enjoys the giant magnet attachment. A great buy..........will no doubt go down well with my 18 month old in the future too!,1349913600,,269,4.510204081632653
8145446,1,B000IHYRXQ,"My son is 2 and into all kinds of trucks, but... not this DVD. But again all kids are different. It's just the overall quality of it isn't so nice. More like a kid's try to make a movie about scrap metal trucks.",1214006400,,211,3.9302325581395348
8145447,5,B000IHYRXQ,My sons asks for this one alot. He calls it crunchers! It has continous play which I love! He won't watch it from beggining to end but I have yet to find one that actually keeps his attention the whole time.,1180051200,,207,4.073170731707317
