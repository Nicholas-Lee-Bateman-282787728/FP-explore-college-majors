8117872,2,B000F6BYXG,"Expectations for writing and acting styles can change.  The writing and acting here are not to my taste, but I could see them working for someone else, maybe.  The production values, though, are bad.  Like, way below Hammer Horror level.

This movie is poorly paced and badly shot.  The camera visibly shakes at times during establishing shots of buildings and landscapes, as if someone nudged the tripod and no one bothered to check the footage. It doesn't seem to be for effect, even if that were an effect anyone could conceivably be going for.  There's at least one scene where the cuts are too quick for it to be clear what happened without rewinding and watching a couple of times.

And then it all just ends.  Some stuff happens -- some of it planned, most of it not, all of it bad -- and then one more thing happens and a title card pops up to say ""It's over.""

This is not worth your time.",1526342400,,898,4.393939393939394

8117875,4,B000F6BYXG,"This is a drama based on the real life activities of Donald Nielson played by Donald Sumpter. He was an ex soldier who had joined civvy street and his business had failed. So he started robbing Post Offices using a sawn off shotgun. He used his army survival training to hide out in woods and generally be a bit of a loon.

His home life is depicted as him being a misogynistic martinet and all round nasty bloke  he was never going to win father of the year. Then he accidentally shoots a sub Post Master on one of his jobs and his crimes take on a more serious hue. This leads him to commit one of the most notorious crimes of the seventies. That was the kidnapping of Leslie Whittle a 16 year old hieress.

Now this is quite well made, there is violence and some nudity (which seemed pointless) but it tries to stick to the facts for the most part. There are some great pieces of observational cinema from the time and I loved seeing how the World worked back when I was a lad. It is far from a feel good film and those that remember the time will probably recall certain aspects of the case differently. But for me this was a well made and acted time piece of a film about one despicable man and his crimes.",1457654400,,1211,4.1888412017167385
8117876,4,B000F6BYXG,"I am from the Kidsgrove area, where in 1974 one of the most evil kidnap plots in British criminal history took place.

Donald Sumpter evokes the character of evil mercenary psychopath Donald Nielson in a menacing and eccentrically superb performance.!!!!

Enjoy the dark, foreboding, haunting style of the film. A certain amount of dramatic licence has been employed here. We shall never know exactly what actually happened...events were confusing, fast paced, and the police utterly wrong-footed and made to look like complete idiots by Nielson for months.

Of course, the late Donald Nielson went to his grave never divulging precisely how Lesley Whittle met her end 70 feet underground in a rat infested drainage shaft on a ledge...her body found 6 weeks later hanging from a steel ligature.

We will never know.................

If you like real stories........this film will enthrall and haunt you ............ENJOY !!!!!",1371772800,,926,5.358620689655172
8117877,5,B000F6BYXG,great undiscovered gem of a movie well written for its time also well directed the movie had me on the edge of my seat. Base on a true story a great true crime movie when most true crime movie are very sensationalize to the point that they are very much larger than life and they become self parody of the event they are suppose to be portraying ... two thumbs up on this.,1367107200,3,372,4.109589041095891
