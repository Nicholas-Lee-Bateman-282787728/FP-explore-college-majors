8205157,1,B000SE70F6,"This was poorly filmed and edited in the 50's. It is no classic. Image quality is so poor that even mountains are difficult to distiguish. This movie is sadly morbid in music, tone and narration. There are no interesting dinosaur shots. There are no characters. Found it to be a total disappointment, as did, by the way, my five year old. This is rather gutsy for anyone to be selling B rate TV fare as if it were of value today. Put this one back in the time vault, its a complete waste of time and money.",1183680000,,506,4.22680412371134
