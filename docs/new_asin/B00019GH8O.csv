1982795,5,B00019GH8O,"Loved the many comments by Balanchine himself. Having enjoyed many of his ballets and reading Bernard Taper's Biography over the years, this was a wonderful blend of the master's personal views with actual ballet footage rarely seen together...a real treat.",1331942400,,257,5.45
1982796,5,B00019GH8O,"This is a wonderful biography of the life and works of Balanchine. I teach a class on critical thinking and movement and I use this to show how this man thought and translated thought. There are interviews with Balanchine himself, interspersed with presentations of his ballets, narration and other interviews. Well worth the investment.",1320624000,,337,5.2592592592592595
1982797,5,B00019GH8O,"I bought this, knowing nothing about Balanchine, and by the end I was completely hooked on him and everything he did.  The whole documentary was beautifully put together, and the dancing was sublime.  The best thing about it were the moments when he found a new graceful movement for his dancers out of the traditional forms (Serenade was particularly moving).  You have a sense of someone always thinking, always working.  The greatest moment I think was the end of the Prodigal Son, so completely unexpected.  You come away in awe -- no doubt about his genius, none whatsoever.",1256947200,6,579,4.86734693877551
1982798,5,B00019GH8O,"This documentary is must see for anyone and everyone who loves classical and modern ballet choreographed by the master choreographer George Balanchine.  It is as much story about his life as it is story about Balanchine'e relationship with composer Stravinsky who arranged many of the modern pieces Balanchine created.  It is also a story about creation of the two biggest ballet houses in the United States: American Ballet Theatre and New York City Ballet.

In the course of the documentary there are pieces of some of the most memorable works Balanchine created performed by American prima ballerinas who were his muses, wives and treasure of american ballet history.

Being that ballet is visual art and in a sense pagan since there is no way to ""memorize"" each movement - one can only improvise on creations of others or create new pieces, this documentary is important document to the legacy of one man's work that created performing art with american tradition.",1255564800,4,968,5.03125
1982799,5,B00019GH8O,This is an exceptional video.  I used it in a class I was doing about dance and it was enjoyed by all.  The biography  on balanchine was very informative and the dancing was very beautiful.  I have seen many performances of ballets corographed by Balanchine and enjoyed being able to watch him dance and work with the dancers.,1234137600,5,326,4.568965517241379
1982800,5,B00019GH8O,Balanchine's legacy is passed on through this beautiful historical documentary about one of ballet's greatest choreographers.  The scope of his work is amazing.,1200182400,2,160,5.956521739130435
1982801,4,B00019GH8O,"Since I knew little about either the life or the work of Balanchine, I really enjoyed this documentary.  I had no idea he was so instrumental in bringing ballet to the United States.  My main complaint was that the film was too short.  We found out almost nothing about the dancers Balanchine worked with, and we saw only snippets of the ballets.  I thought it particularly odd that although Suzanne Farrell appeared in dozens of clips, more than any other ballerina, nothing at all was said about her.",1140825600,13,502,4.670454545454546
1982802,3,B00019GH8O,"I've never seen a biography that contained less personal information about its subject.  This DVD, for example, never mentions Balanchine's marriages to the dancers Maria Tallchief and Tanquil leClerc, or his obsession with the forty-years-younger Suzanne Farrell.  These relationships are important for more than just gossipy reasons - all three women had a significant effect on his work.  There are some good performance clips on the DVD, but the selection is oddly biased: lots and lots of Peter Martins, but never a glimpse of Edward Villella.  A fine ""starter CD"" for those just learning about Balanchine, but frustrating for fans.",1106352000,33,637,5.34

8008799,5,B00019GH8O,Wonderful. The excerpts from the many ballets were perfectly enchanting,1419724800,,71,6.2
8008800,5,B00019GH8O,Balanchine was a genius! I've seen it many times and enjoy it very much every time!,1414022400,,83,4.25
8008801,5,B00019GH8O,"Loved watching the history, background, and clips of ballet.
Learned a lot and it was a glimpse into genius.",1411516800,,108,4.7368421052631575
8008802,5,B00019GH8O,"Balanchine was the Russian who brought his ballet to America to blend the two styles of ballet into the dance he both choreographed, taught, and created for us with just the right dancer because he knew them well since he hand picked each one. He was the first man of  American ballet, who perfected it and made The New York City Ballet his until his death.",1411084800,,357,4.409090909090909
8008803,5,B00019GH8O,"Always a classical music lover, many years ago I attended an NYCB performance to hear Hindemith's ""The Four Temperaments"".  While I didn't necessarily appreciate the Balanchine choreography (and for this particular work still don't), the performance was the beginning of my years long journey of discovering Balanchine's ballets and the associated music, most notably that of Stravinsky.  This DVD was an absolutely wonderful introduction, but it's not just for novices!  It remains my favorite DVD in my entire collection and I continue to watch it several times per year.  What I love is that it's packed full of information about all of the different phases of Balanchine's career, there is a great deal of amazing (often breathtaking) archival footage, the narration is very nicely done, and whether I watch just a few minutes of the DVD or the entire thing from start to finish I always feel energized, ""high"" even.  Balanchine was an absolute genius.  The final scene is so perfect, there couldn't be a more fitting symbolic representation of the end of Balanchine's life than the last few minutes of Apollo.",1406764800,,1114,5.093406593406593
8008804,5,B00019GH8O,I ordered 3 Balanchine videos and this was by far the best of them all!!!  Highly recommend to others who want to see a great video about this man.,1368403200,,147,4.068965517241379
8008805,5,B00019GH8O,"This is simply amazing!  Extremely well produced, with long video clips of Balanchine ballets.  I couldn't stop watching! Thank God for the people who captured these ballets! Mr Balanchine talks throughout. Great CD!",1352505600,,216,5.515151515151516
