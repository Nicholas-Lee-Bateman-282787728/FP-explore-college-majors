8575571,5,B00BYABHC0,"I highly recommend this murder movie to anyone who might be looking for an excellent old fashion film. This movie was directed by Robert Day in 1958 and has all elements needed to entrain any audience. It is based on a good story in which surgeon Dr. Thomas Bulton (played by the great Boris Karloff) was experimenting with himself to produce anesthesia and avoid pain to patients. In the middle, we have Black Ben who runs a tavern to hide his business to supply the local hospital with cadavers from ""involuntary"" subjects. Among the bad guy team we have a young Christopher Lee who takes care of the body count.

Technically, this Black and White DVD transfer comes in nice widescreen format with very good crisp clear image. The movie comes with English or Spanish audio. Spanish subtitles are also provided. This is a PAL, region 2 release.

Finally, I got a copy of this particular release from Amazon Spain for about 11 euros + shipping. Everything was perfect, no issues.",1420934400,,979,4.719298245614035
