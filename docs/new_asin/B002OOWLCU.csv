Sony I don't know why you neglect such funny shows. Is great comedy a dying art? It's been 7 years since seasons 1 & 2 were released. Then season 3 came... nearly 5 years later. Inexcusable treatment for any show.

Fans, don't just think season 4 needs to come out. Every last season should be out by now. I can only hope Shout Factory can save this show the way they do with other forgotten greats. I'll be waiting, and so will my money, Sony. Don't forget that.",1304812800,14,633,4.456896551724138
