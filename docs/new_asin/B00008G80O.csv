7982809,1,B00008G80O,"I saw this video with no expectations, quite frankly I was amused because this was part of my best friends collection of ""antiques"" and I had not seen a VHS since I was a kid. After having seen this novelty, I can appreciate why it was never made into a DVD. The video quality is about what you would expect for film footage of this time which has never been upgraded or digitally re-mastered, but its ""gritty"" imagery gives the film an almost ""classic"" feel I thought.

It is March 24th, 2014 as I write this review. So if you are looking for something to back up either your position on Christianity or Satanism, you have kind of come to the wrong place. I really can see the point a previous reviewer made of a ""symbiotic"" relationship between the two ideologies. I don't necessarily agree that one ""needs"" the other as much as I feel that both actually ""feed"" off each other.

At this day and age, both Zeena ""LeVey"", (ironically now Zeena ""Schreck"") and her now husband Nikolas Schreck, have publically denounced Satanism, Anton LeVey, and the Church of Satan completely. You should maybe know this know going in.  Bob Larson has taken his show on the road, literally. He now performs nationally and really you can just as easily say Bob Larson is: ""On tour with God"" performing miracles and exorcisms and is ""coming to a city near you.""

I am not kidding. I can really see how both religions are based on showboating and nonsense and how many sheep we have in this world that look like human beings. The banter is provocative, argumentative and childish. It almost reminds me of what talk shows and reality TV would morph into eventually. I think that the seeker of truth would need to do their own research as they will find no answers here, instead its just entertainment. Both religions have splintered into countless denominations, both have been denounced by former members, both have used pageantry, ritual and coercion to seduce members and at the end of the day you still have two systems created by man with very flawed perspectives of the world.

Each claims to be superior to the other, and neither one will appeal to anyone with any iota of critical thinking. Personally I think Satanism makes more sense and is less hypocritical. But I feel it is more a reaction than a legitimate philosophy. But you may not even get that by watching this laughable piece of television history...",1395619200,,2399,4.648584905660377

7982811,4,B00008G80O,"The First Family of Satanism (director unknown, 1990)

This insanely amusing video from wingnut-Christian video house American Portrait Films becomes infinitely more amusing when you realize that they're still using the tagline ""LaVey and Schreck are the driving force behind Satanism's plans. If you don't know what's going on in the world of Satanism, you can't confront it."" (As of this writing, anyway--December 1, 2008--it's still in the film's description on the American Portrait website.) In fact, that hasn't been the case since just after the film, which is actually an hour-long interview between Bob Larson, Zeena LaVey, and Nikolas Schreck, was made; LaVey and Schreck cut all ties with the Church of Satan in 1990, and have, in fact, reported that they've been harassed on and off by CoS members ever since. (The two, who have now been married for twenty years, joined the splinter group Temple of Set in 1995, stayed with them for a while, then split off yet again and have formed their own group. Ah, the purity of one's beliefs will never let one rest.) While LaVey and Schreck were members of CoS during the filming of this video, I've little doubt things have changed in the following eighteen years. And I've no doubt that those viewing this video now and assuming everything's the same as it was in 1990 would be surprised, if they did the research. (They wouldn't have to go too far; Zeena has appeared on Larson's radio show at least once since the split, right after her father's death in 1997.) In fact, Larson himself has interviewed Boyd Rice, who's much more in tune with the Church of Satan these days, numerous times. (You can find audio of these debates at Boyd Rice's website, but as usual, Amazon will redline this review if I link to external sources, so you will have to use your Google-fu.) You'd think American Portrait would want to get its facts straight. Oh, I forgot--they're interested in making money, not accurate depictions of current world events.

In any case, the tape itself is a nightmare, a textbook on what not to do when you're interviewing a hostile guest. (And it should be noted that neither LaVey nor Schreck are in any way hostile, even during Larson's more obvious baiting techniques.) Larson obviously has his agenda, and more interestingly, LaVey and Schreck are perfectly happy to rise to the bait every time he tosses it out there. There's no evasion, no ducking of questions, no hesitation. Of course, oftentimes Larson doesn't get the answers he wants, but that doesn't stop him from continuing on his prescribed path. (And one wouldn't expect him to get so flustered when Schreck, as he is won't to do, quotes the Bible at Larson every time Larson singles out one of the Satanic Bible's more lurid quotes; one would assume Larson, who often hosts ""undesirable"" guests on his radio show, would be used to this sort of thing by now.) You can actually see him trying to find ways to twist words and shove them back in his guests' mouths. He fails miserably every time to anyone who's even remotely observant. (One assumes most viewers of this cassette do not fall into that category.) LaVey and Schreck take it all with aplomb and, oftentimes, bemusement. They really do emerge the winners of this debate, not necessarily because of anything thy say, just because they behave themselves better.

Comedy gold. See this at your earliest convenience. Unless, of course, you actually think Bob Larson really does have it right. You lot will not get the humor here. *** ",1228608000,3,3528,4.8264462809917354
7982812,3,B00008G80O,"In this video presentation, Bob Larson proclaims his ""war"" on Satanism, as golden crosses and money signs fill his eyes with monetary prospects of such ""good vs. evil"" scenarios, which is typical christian dualism. But We do not play by their rules, not do we play their games unless amused to do so.

At that time, the late 80's / early 90's, in the wake of Geraldo Rivera's ""special"" ""Devil Worship: Exposing Satan's Underground"" sensationalistic media fodder, Zeena 'LaVey' and Nikolas Schrek were the official Church of Satan representatives, countering Larson's erronious accusations and jibing, attempting to trap Satanists into some kind of inconsistent admittance of advocating senseless murder and cruelty for nothing's sake, even though The Satanic Bible itself explains these subjects in full. At least he did have the said text beside him, along with the moldy babble, picking selected passages from each to justify his christian propaganda, always attempting to preserve his own personal fetishistic fantasies of murder, rape, Hitler, and Charles Manson - the latter two in particular, he seems to have a fascination with.

From the get-go, Larson implies that Dr. LaVey was not being ""intellectually honest"" by remaining in selective seclusion from the herd, but was answered solidly that it was simply no longer necessary, as his past media representations and written words are quite sufficient. These insights visibly irritated Larson, as he could not argue against this truth. Indeed, throughout the video, Larson is visibly stumped and frustrated on several occasions, as his convenient and delusional conclusions are thwarted at every turn with honesty and undefiled logic.

Other questions consisted of Satanic Music, as Schrek's band and King Diamond were mentioned. Although with some exceptions, preference for Classical music seems to be the concensus of many Satanists.

In one comedic moment, Larson actually tries to gain Zeena's compassion for the dregs of the world, soley because she happens to be female, who according to Larson, have ""more compassionate natures"". She giggled at this - yet another under-handed attempt to set one against the other.

The question of what The Church of Satan's stance on homosexuality came forth, to which the point was made that anyone demonstrating themselves as The Elite are accepted into active membership roles, regardless of sexual orientation - and the question is furthermore, irrelevant.

Throughout the entire interview, the Satanists held their ground, although The Satanic Bible pretty much speaks for itself. There was more evidence of Larson's selective thinking, merely picking and choosing particular selections in attempts to ratify his foolosophy.

In another mentionable moment, the statement was made that christianity needs Satanism, whereas we do not need christianity {read Satanic Statement #9}, as the Satanic Individual has always been throughout history by whatever name called, as well as the various slave/peasant blindlight religions.

The rest of the interview consisted on the definition of ""good and evil"", as Larson did not seem to get it into his head that Satanists do not ultimately believe in such concepts, but at the same time understand the herd's need for such simplistic explanations in their primitive thought process, and the possible entertaining manipulative implications thereof. However, if there is any type of terminological consideration to the Satanist, Dr. LaVey writes in The Devil's Notebook, ""Good is what you like. Evil is what you don't like."" Precisely.

It was also mentioned that journalists had been comparing Dr. LaVey with the likes of Rasputin, which was not at all surprising, as the general philosophies are similar.

As is typical, Larson was persistent in his ignorance. Satanic opinion and observation disturb him greatly, as is demonstrated in the concluding statements after the interview was done, alone with the camera in his studio, that ""Satan's Evil Plan"" and ""The Satanic Century"" cannot prevail, quoting some ubiquitous scripture. He was again visibly defeated, resorting to nothing more than accessing the fears of the herd, which is understandable, considering that he is ultimately a businessman, as are all of these 'evangelists'. Living opulently in his mansion, he depends on those very fears to keep him in a job.",1123632000,2,4366,5.4073529411764705
7982813,2,B00008G80O,"This is an interesting video. The Church of Satan chooses its representatives poorly, having Nichols Shrek on this committee was a mistake. He simply cannot shut up. He shows an inclination to showboating his hatred of Christianity with the same intolerant fervor as his bible thumping counterparts show toward him. While Ms. Levay (stunningly attractive woman)tries to explain the tennants of the Satanic religion, she is often silenced not by the religious banter of her Christian counterpart conducting the interview, but by her one-eared associate who should have stayed home. This would have been an excellent video had both parties stuck with the facts and left thier hatred at home. The Satanic committee was not prepared to answer the questions asked and suprisingly the interview conducted by the Christian was amazingly polite dispite the fundementalist inspiration in its creation. The effect this video will produce will vary. It will convince the Christian they are right and succsessfully conveys the blind fear that is such an intergal part of that religion. The Satanist will find inspiration in his belief, but the rest of us will be left shaking our heads afraid and mistrusting of BOTH. Nowhere have I seen in more clear and concise a manner, how symbionic those 2 religions are. One can clearly see how one CREATED the other. Christianity simply cannot exsist on its own and its precepts are not strong enough to support any belief unless it is crusading against someone or something. ANYTHING. But none so ripe a target as Satanism. Nicholas Shreks retorts are nothing short or ridiculous as he can only counter the interviewers points by pointing to the many contradictions found in the bible. While the interviewer makes his points based on the same book. Take away the element of the bible and you have no interview and both religions will collapse. Satanism needs Christianity as much as the reverse is true. And that is clearly evident by the time you get to the end of the tape. You can see 1st hand a microcosmic demonstration of what is truly wrong with the world. This tape does more service to the psycologist than the theologist.",1072742400,7,2161,4.972375690607735
