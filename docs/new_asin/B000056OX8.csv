1398958,5,B000056OX8,"Finally got the last two DVD's, which includes an episode that I didn't even know had been cut out.  It's the first one on disk two, but given it's content, cartoon network would have had about a 10 minute show if they had edited it.  It did explain where Jean got the #4, #9, and #13 casters, and why they drain his life energy.  Besides that, the rest of the series is more or less exactly the same as that shown on cartoon network save for the language.
There are no extra's on disk one, but there are a couple on disk 2.  It has the textless ending for the second song, which personelly I didn't like, liked the first one better, but that's just me, and the cover art from all the vhs tapes of the series.  I do really hope they come out with more episodes for this series though, it would be a shame to end it with just this few episodes.  Expecially since we never even got to see the space forces, just a security force.  It was a good series, and was nice with the DVD's to fill in the missing information that CN cut out for content.",986256000,3,1042,4.103448275862069
1398959,4,B000056OX8,"As with the other two OUTLAW STAR collections.  If you've yet to see the other two collections, I suggest obtaining them before this set as the series watches like one long storyline.  True, there is some nudity and a bit of strong language and so it shouldn't be viewed by kids (unless they watch the cartoon network version) but for the average young adult and adult animation lover, this set is a splendid treat that is well worth purchasing.",985478400,,445,4.620253164556962
1398960,5,B000056OX8,"I just got a hold of the 3rd and last installment to the Outlaw Star DVD collection.  This DVD includes 2 DVDs with episodes 19-26.
As with all the other DVD collections, extras are minimal and put on the 2nd Disc.  I would hope that they put more extras especially because there are only 3 collections for the series.  Anyway, this collection includes the textless ending scene for the 2nd ending song titled Tsuki no Ie (The house on the Moon? My japanese knowledge is very small).  The extras also include cover art for all the VHS tapes that have been released (13 in all, 2 episodes per tape).  I enjoyed this as it's a small alternative to owning all the tapes.
The video quality and transfer appeared very nice in this collection.  At times there were parts that were grainy but for the most part it looked amazing, lines were very sharp and clear.  Menus are the same format as the ones in the previous collections.  Very simple and easy to navigate.
Only thing I'll say about the episodes is that one episode (episode 19) introduces two crew members from the Angel Links, a ship from the military.  Now if you haven't heard of it, Angel Links is another anime soon to be released by Bandai Entertainment.  This shall prove interesting as two animes in the same (exact) world aren't very common.  You should check out Angel Links if you're looking for a new anime to try.  The episodes get more interesting and shocking as you go on.
Final Note:  The one thing I hate about Bandai DVDs are that each episode are on different 'Titles' as opposed to them all being in 1 Title with different chapters.  The problem?  Well, loading time is quite long and if you use the Episode Select, you end up going back to the menu after each episode and it gets annoying especially with all the episodes on these collections.",985478400,11,1818,4.516819571865444
1398961,4,B000056OX8,this collecrion is good but not for children. Seeing a naked chick in a tube is considered explecit conduct. ( i got that from the back of a blockbuster box),984700800,,157,4.266666666666667
1398962,4,B000056OX8,"We see the end of the series, the fates of the McDougall Brothers, the Pirates and the crew of the Outlaw Star, and an explaination of the Galatic Leyline.  The ending was kind of awkward and predictable, but at least it left an opening for a second series.  Also for the fans, we see some new Caster shells for Jean.
  These Grappler Ships still don't appeal to me, they look weird.",983836800,2,383,4.352112676056338
1398963,3,B000056OX8,"Outlaw Star is good fantasy/sci-fi, it also has some comedy in it.  Collection 3 contains two discs and the last eight episodes.  It deals with all the loose ends that were accumulated through-out the series.  Though the ending was rushed it did leave closure, but at the same time they left room to make a sequal, should they choose too.
I gave it 3 out of 5 stars because it was rushed compared to the earlier episodes.  The animation wasn't all that good, but it wasn't bad.  The story, however, was excellent.  This is a good series for fans that want a good blend of just about everything.",983750400,,594,4.453703703703703
1398984,5,B000056OX8,"This episode marks the end of the great title, the outlaw star, and in a way is the beginning of somethign greater.  Besides episode 23, which was unusually high in slapstick, the entire DVD set was action packed, and awesome. If you liked the first two, you won't be disappointed by the conclusion.",1012089600,,299,4.6415094339622645
1398985,5,B000056OX8,"OK, this whole series was a bit of a mind trip. I hate these ... who simply want to peg this in the gnere of a space western. To me, it is far more complicated than that. This set contains my favorite episode: The Strongest Woman in the Universe. Fred Luo hires Gene to take out a woman wrestler so he won't have to marry her. Wait til you see what lengths Gene goes to in order to get the job done. Hilarious! The entire series is definitely one of the best I've ever seen. I don't know why everyone was so hard, on the Hot Srpings episode. Unlike some anime that threw in a fan service episode, *cough*Bebop*cough*, this episode actually ties in with the series. Sure, it's all about the girls, but it still conects with the whole storyline. Anyway, buy this set! You will not regret it and you'll be compelled to watch it over and over.",1009756800,,839,4.25
1398986,5,B000056OX8,"...is the best anime EVER! The first disk has 3 great Episodes and one mediocre one: the mediocre one is pretty OK - Jim meets Hammyo, but doesn't know that she is one of the Anten Seven, an assassin group sent to eleiminate the Outlaw Star and its crew. There is a so so space battle. The other three are the Grave of the Dragon, which features a beautiful McDougle showdown; Law and Lawlessness introduces Valeria and Dooze as members of Angel Links (they're much cooler here than in their own show) and has some awesome fights scenes inside a space station inside the Outlaw Star. The last episode is my favorite of the disk, Gravity Jailbreak. Gene breaks into a 3 times gravity 'in-escapable' prison to ask an inmate the coordinates of the Leyline.
The second disk has the lost episode, Hotsprings Planet Tenrei. Once you see it, you'll love it AND know why it couldn't be shown on Cartoon Network. The 3 Leyline Episodes are also on this second disk. All four of these Episodes are probably the best of Outlaw Star, if not the entire collection. If you're even considering, BELIEVE ME IT'S WORTH IT!!",999820800,3,1106,4.590909090909091
1398987,5,B000056OX8,"This DVD is the best of all of the Outlaw Star DVDs. It has the best quality, the best extras(cover galleries, 2 textless endings, trailers, and more)and screaming cat-women. What more could an Outlaw Star fan ask for you say? Well I'll tell ya what! This review!  Episode 19: Law and Lawlessness is based around Gene and Jim being mistaken for pirates by an Angel Links(see Angel Links) security force. After Melfina takes some files from a pirate their battling she discorvers a plan to attack the security forces from the inside. Now besides dealing with Velairia and Duuz, two security force members, they have to save all of the people inside the base! The next episode, Cats and Girls and Spaceships, is based around Jim's first love Hamnyo, an Anten Seven pirate. While blindly fighting each other in grappler combat, is Jim's first love at stake?  Episode 21: Grave of The Dragon, the crew of the Outlaw Star goes to a mysterious planet with clues to the Galactic Leyline. Unfortunatly Ron and Harry Macdougall follow them and it winds up as a big battle. Will they save Melfina from Harry?  The next episode, Gravity Jailbrake, Gene goes into a jail where nobody's ever come out alive.  The catch is he goes in as a prisinor! On many false chares, he's brought in all because of Gwen Khan shutting down Mel and giving him no choice but to find the prisinor with the coordinates to the Galactic Leyline.  Episode 23: Hot Springs Planet Tenrei, is about the crew going to the Planet of Tenrei to search out wizards who can give them caster shells to help at the leyline. The only problem is that two of the wizards(Ark and Hadul)of the three want Gene to get some dirty footage of the third female wizard, who just happens to live ontop of Mount Nyotai, where men are banned! And only on this condition will he get any caster shells!  Episode 24:Cutting the Galactic Leyline is based around Melfina attempting to navigate the Outlaw Star through the outer defenses of the Galactic Leyline while Gene fights off all sorts of pirates, and once their almost there, who would show up but Ron, Harry, Hazanko, and the Anten Seven!  After that, Maze of Despair, is about trying to get to Melfina first through a maze for the sole purpose of getting ones wish granted, which will prove to be tough while fighting the Antens and an enraged Ron.  The final episode, Return to Space, as everyone makes it to the ""trophy room"" nobody wants to give up Melfina and when Hazanko and Gene both fire(Hazanko's magic, and Gene's caster) both the blasts react killing everyone in the room, and now that Hazanko's wish for power has been granted Gene and Melfina need to get back to the real world and kill the now mutated Hazanko/Tobigera Geomancer. Watch this surprising conclusion on Outlaw Star Collection 3 DVD! I highly recomend it!",996710400,,2826,4.6720321931589535
1398988,5,B000056OX8,"Most people assosiate Anime with undeveloped story lines and meaningless plots, but outlaw Star breaks all the common anime steriotypes. Not only does Outlaw star have a great story, but it has a memorable cast of characters that show true human aspects, making them seem more believable. I think that anyone who appretiates good entertainment, will enjoy Outlaw star. Though at times the language can be rather harsh, (mostly expressed by our friend Gene Starwind), and there are brief scenes of nudity, (Often seen with our friend Melfina as she runs the ship from her tank), it hardly takes away from the brilliants of the series, and in fact adds to it's unique perspective of what lies ahead in the futer hero generation. I personally think that these shows would make an asome movie, provided they got a good director, and didn't use Leonardo Dicaprio or the backstreet boys in it. Not saying that they're not good, but it just wouldn't go with the whole Outlaw Star gist. If I ever become a directer I certianly will make the series into a movie! In short, Anyone who appretiates a good story, inventive ideas, memorable characters, humor, and outstanding music, will fall in love with the Outlaw Star series.",994636800,5,1216,4.850961538461538
1398989,4,B000056OX8,"There are a certain number of quirks and foibles one has to endure if anime is going to hold your interest.  'Outlaw Star' has pretty much all of them.
  First, there is the team of heros, so exceptionally diverse you'd think they were each written by different people.  This problem is reflected in the villains who, (true to anime style) are each more bizarre and dangerous than the last.  The problem is that its almost impossible to tell a coherent story with this setup, as Suzuka demonstrates in one of the final episodes.
  Second, there is the problem with the TV-series setup itself.  Apparently there is a law somewhere that requires a certain number of 'filler' episodes that have nothing to do with the central plotline.  Sometimes the writers really struggle to connect these episodes to the central plot.  In several episodes the audience has no idea why the characters are where they are.  One episode in particular seems to serve no purpose other than provide a link to 'Outlaw Star's' spinoff series.
  And finally there's the fact that every Anime series lags heavily in the beginning before becoming good at the end.  The series that best serves as an example of this is 'Evangelion,' which becomes downright pathetic in the middle of the series before becoming beautifully brilliant at the end.
  That's pretty much the bottom line for 'Outlaw Star.'  Despite a rough beginning and a miserable middle, the ending is genuinely satisfying, enough to make up for all its quirks.  If you have the patience to make it all the way to the last disc, you will be richly rewarded.
  There is some genuinely cool stuff to be found here.  Jim is the star of an excellent episode.  Melfina and Harry MacDougal continue to steal the show, leaving the entire rest of the cast behind as their bizarre drama takes off.  The prison planet episode was also very good.  I suspect more scientific research went into this one episode than the entire rest of the series.  One of the 'filler' episodes, involving a tourist resort, seems pointless but (unlike the rest of the show) it is genuinely funny, with a vein of humor so strange, wacky, and downright hilarious it's worthy of Douglas Adams.
  The Anten Seven get some good scenes, but mostly they are the mismatched and mostly asinine villain team we've come to expect from the anime genre.  As I mentioned before, towards the end Suzuka becomes the subject of a pointless subplot that seems to be inserted only to drag the ending out a bit longer.  But these stumbles are made up for by the sheer beauty of the Galactic Leyline and the drama between Gene, Melfina, Harry.  Like most anime, this series becomes very strange at the end, but it is strange in a good way.  Unlike 'Evangelion,' the ending is odd enough to make you think, but not so bizarre that it's rendered incomprehensible.
  Taken together, the series is only average.  It has as many awful moments as it has brilliant ones.  It's one of the foibles of anime that the brilliant ones have to be stuck at the end.  If you were less-than-satisfied with the rest of the series, you can be assured that the final episodes are well worth your time and money.",990835200,2,3174,4.686594202898551
1398990,5,B000056OX8,"If you thought by watching Toonami's version of Outlaw Star was cool, you haven't seen nothing yet. Episode #23 is the ""Main Event"" episode in this collection of Outlaw Star. ""Hot Springs Planet Tenrei"" is got to be the most funniest episode out of the 26 episodes of Outlaw Star. You must buy this now cause you'll regret what you'll miss that was edited out from T.V.

It is maybe thue that it is not for little kids(So why didn't you people bought the Cartoon Network edition if you find it so ""violent""?)This anime is so cool and the ending is cool too because it really started what would be the continuation of the Outlaw Star. I personally found this anime great,pretty similar to Cowboy Bebop though but it is great. The plot is pretty nice and the music is cool too(The opening theme ""Through out the night""is one of the best song that I'd ever heard in my life. Buy this people,you won't be dissapointed.

7932453,4,B000056OX8,"The final episodes have some great scenes with Harry McDougall going wacko over his disturbing infaution with Melfina. He stalks her and obsesses over his hatred for Gene. The Hot Springs Tenrei episode is beyond awesome albeit in a naughty sort of way but I feel like the ending could have been better. So much buildup and enthusiasm to discover the Leyline that doesn't satisfy 100%.

I had already found the first two volumes at a used DVD store, but this one completed the set. My fiance was so excited to have the complete set. Great quality and value for anyone who loved the series and wants to have it on DVD. Finding it new is difficult and crazy expensive. Used is the way to go, especially if you can find great suppliers like this one.",1365379200,,520,4.158415841584159

After retrieving the ship, Gene and his partner, Jim, are now involved in a race to find the Galactic Leyline. The Galactic Leyline is a mythical place that holds the keys to the universe, and infinite wealth.

I saw this show on TV in the late 90's. It rocked my face off. The premise was pretty different, the characters kicked ass, and the animation was good. Everything about Outlaw Star is incredible. I'll be short and to the point. You must watch this anime; it's awesome!!",1354838400,,818,4.453333333333333

All you anime collectors out there know what im taking about when I say the most great anime endings are sad and dissapointing.  The characters die, or are separated.  Being tired of all the grief caused by such anime endings, I am glad to find one that leaves the viewer satisfied.  I recommend the entire series to every body because of its light heartedness, its superb graphics and fast action.  Enjoy!!!",1050105600,,589,4.735294117647059

I think the story is cool and the technology Evan cooler. The caster (a gun that shoots magic shells) is my favorite weapon. It has 9 episodes on 2 dvds and all the episodes are grate but the last 2 are my favorite...the Hot springs planet tenrai episode (I think that's how its spelled) got into the history of the caster and was funny to boot...if you like action adventure and a guy with a cool gun get this!",1039996800,,533,4.085714285714285

Outlaw star follows in the footsteps of Cowboy BeBop and Gundam Wing.  The 3rd collection is by far the best of all.  It has it's share of very serious and comedic episodes.  The final episode may come as some of a shoker leaving you with many questions (not as shocking as cowboy bebop's ending) and it left me depressed for several days.  I highly recomend that any anime fan checks this show out.",1016755200,,531,4.6063829787234045
7932461,5,B000056OX8,"The last of the DVDs for Outlaw Star is just as good as the first two.  This DVD features ""Hot Springs Planet Tenrei"" which wasn't shown on CN, something to do with a little thing called nudity.  I'm convinced that ""Hot Springs Planet Tenrei"" was written by someone who was drunk and horny.  It's the funniest espiode in the series.
  Hot Springs Planet Tenrei marks the last of the funny espiodes and starts with the serious ones.  I like Melfina's song in English (yes, I do watch it in English, got a problem with that??)
  The ending to Outlaw Star is a trip.  I enjoyed the series and hoping they might come out with futher adventures of Gene Starwind, the girl magnet of the universe.",1015804800,,690,4.456
