7914242,5,B00000K3UH,"""Sorceress"" is one of those romantic movies with a 'little' tragedy in the end that would make you throw offenses into the face of a social reality that sometimes is harmful, even deadly. Sorceress is a beautiful girl (Marina Vlady) who charms a city engenieer (Maurice Ronet) that has come to work in a remote scandinavian village.  The reality there is often supersticious and there is no place for harmless sorceresses.  If something bad happens, the locals have their someone, the sorceress, to blame.
A fantastik movie that will engulf you in its captivating world of dis-belief where love may have a start but with an uncertainty of its future.
