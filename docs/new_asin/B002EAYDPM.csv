3916612,2,B002EAYDPM,"This film has some nice set design and is at times enjoyable to watch. It is better than some of the newer filmed version of the 'Opera', but could easily be bettered.
It's only too bad that Warner has the copyright as their ARCHIVE editions are often no better than VHS tapes.  They refuse to go to the trouble of providing the viewer with the nice convenience of chapters so the disc also play like a tape.  If you wish to return to a particular scene to enjoy it again, you can not easily do so, however, the pricing is no cheaper than other DVDs.  Even the Korean pirates put chapters into their products but not Warner Brothers.",1269820800,12,633,4.3474576271186445
3916613,4,B002EAYDPM,"Noted stage director Peter Brook opens up John Gay's operatta for the screen quite nicely.  It's at once joyous, bawdy, and high-spirited.  I wouldn't call it a transcendant work but as entertainment it fills the bill.  Laurence Olivier does no wrong here as MacHeath, highwayman and rogue, who leaves a swath of hold-ups and breaches of promise across England.  This could have been a mere curio but Olivier and his castmates inject the film with energy that makes it timeless.  About my only gripe with this this Warner Archive release is that the Technicolor seemed a little faded.  Warners would have done this release justice by giving it a better restoration.",1256428800,15,665,4.945945945945946

8367279,2,B002EAYDPM,"This barely resembles the original play by John Gay. All of the political satire has been taken out, which was the original purpose, leaving a syrupy romance with incoherent singing. They should not have bothered, in my opinion. If you want the original, then get the version starring Roger Daltry, as well as the book with explanatory notes. If you just have to see everything Olivier ever did, including ride an obviously fake and silly horse, then go for it.",1509148800,,461,4.775
8367280,5,B002EAYDPM,"One of my all-time favorites; too bad it took more than fifty years to be released for home viewing! (They never did release it on videotape in the US, although it was sold in Great Britain--incompatible with American VHS players!) This DVD does work on American DVD players.",1505606400,,275,4.75

8367284,5,B002EAYDPM,"This is a classic play written as an 18th century spoof on 'high class' opera.  For lovers of the theatre, this is a must-see film as Laurence Olivier was spectacular in the main role (and directed it as well).",1437609600,,210,4.384615384615385

8367286,1,B002EAYDPM,"I've waited to see this movie since it came out in 1954 (?). It is just wonderful, music, acting, and all. Laurence Olivier is magnificent. BUT the DVD wouldn't play in my DVD player - which granted isn't the newest, but it plays everything else just fine. This disc skipped and dissolved into pixels. It worked in my MacBook but of course I only get a small screen. Amazon replaced the copy, but the copy wouldn't even start to play in the DVD player, all I got was ""disc error"".

There's some kind of mysterious warning on the DVD, saying this: ""This disc is expected to play back in DVD video ""play only"" devices, and may not play back in other DVD devices, including recorders and PC drives"" - whatever that means.

So I wouldn't recommend buying this DVD. Maybe somebody will create a workable copy, it would be worth it.",1332028800,11,826,4.4635761589403975
