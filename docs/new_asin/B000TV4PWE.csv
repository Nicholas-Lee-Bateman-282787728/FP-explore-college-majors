8211026,3,B000TV4PWE,"Set on a beautiful tropical island this film had a lot to offer but was majorly flawed by the pathetic quality of the DVD transfer. It is evident from the tell-tale 'tracking' lines that flicker across the picture periodically that this is an old VHS tape that has been unceremoniously dubbed onto DVD without any attempts to improve the image quality. The result is a grainy fuzzy picture that doesn't really allow one to see the detail of the many scenes of attractive women prancing about in the all together. The plot is intriguing enough to hold one's interest and there is a lot of nudity to be enjoyed from the attractive females in the cast. I purchased it primarily to see more of Olivia Pascal - a young brunette German actress who made a bit of a name for herself in the 70's after her 'break-out' performance in the film 'Vanessa' - where she displayed her luscious body to the max. Alas - as is often the case - her subsequent movies typically offer way less flesh and more 'acting' while clothed. Olivia does have a few good scenes in the buff (including a brief torture segment with the bad guy white slavers) but generally she's covered up. The 'white slavery' aspect of the film is minimal - most of the plot revolves around 'family intrigue'. There are ample sex scenes (all are pretty soft core) - but the girls are gorgeous and full female nudity abounds! In the final analysis I'd say the flik was over-priced for the visual quality that you get. This was packaged as part of the 'David Hamilton Collection' - but I doubt if D.H. ever watched it or he would have had second thoughts about lending his name to it. Hopefully, some day, there will be a nice sharp version of it made available.

NEW INFO ON IMPROVED QUALITY GERMAN (ONLY!) VERSION!

I am pleased to report that, subsequent to the previous review, I discovered that there IS a copy of this (relatively obscure) film available with a markedly improved visual quality. This version is a DVD pressing from Germany released by the 'MCP - Sound & Media' authoring group under the title ""Die Insel der 1000 Freuden"". Ironically - I found this (Region 2 PAL format) disk on the American - Amazon.com site - available from a USA distributor in New York! The one (fairly large) negative factor (for anglophiles) is the fact that this version is only presented in German - no English vocals nor subtitles! In my case - I fortunately had the, previusly noted, English dubbed version to help guide me through the film's rather complex plot line so I was able to simply enjoy the much improved clarity of the product. It should be noted that a 'Region Free' DVD player is required to view this Region 2 PAL disc.

All in all - I was happy with this (second) version of the film and would recommend it, principally, for its' attractive cast, and their willingness to shed their clothes -with or without English it's worth a look.",1374105600,3,2898,4.569230769230769
8211027,1,B000TV4PWE,"When I purchased this I was sure there was going to be sex, sex, and more sex.  Girls being sold into sex slavery and stuff like that....HA!!! There is not one sex scene in the whole movie and on top of that it was grainy and you could barley here what they were saying...SAVE UR MONEY PLEASE!!",1268956800,8,294,4.157894736842105
8211028,5,B000TV4PWE,"A very erotic movie, but what happen to the other 18 minutes of the movie? $21.99 is a good price to pay for the full movie.",1203206400,10,124,3.8076923076923075
