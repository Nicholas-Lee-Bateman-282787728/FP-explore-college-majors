1128762,3,7798954635,"I can easily remember the hype that was built around ""Kung Fu Dunk"".

First the announcement of pop star Jay Chou playing the lead character and then word that the film would be based on the Japanese manga/anime series ""Slam Dunk"" caught  the attention of many who were familiar with the series.

But then things changed and the next thing we heard is that the film would be like a ""Shaolin Soccer"" and feature Kung Fu with basketball.  Needless to say, it sounds unusual but ""Shaolin Soccer"" was an enjoyable film that you just have to sit back and see what Director Kevin Chu and writers Kevin Wu, Lam Chiu-Wing and Anne Wang had put together.  And the collaboration of Taiwan, Hong Kong and even mainland Chinese talent definitely raised the curiosity of fans of the various talent in the film.

VIDEO:

""Kung Fu Dunk"" is presented in 1080p.  For the most part, the picture quality looks very good on Blu-ray and much better than its DVD counterpart.  Blacks are nice and deep, I didn't notice any aliasing or compression artifacts but for the most part, the PQ was very solid for this release.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

Where the Blu-ray shines in PQ, unfortunately this 2008 Blu-ray release is missing a lossless soundtrack.  Not sure why but ""Kung Fu Dunk"" is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 and 2.0 Mandrarin and English Dolby Digital 5.1.  The audio quality is fine, but the fact that the audio is not lossless is a bit of a letdown, especially since the film has its share of action sequences.  The Mandarin Dolby Digital 5.1 track is good but the English dub is on par with a lot of the English dubs for Asian films these days.  It's not my preference but I did re-watch the film in English and for the most part, it works.

As for subtitles, subtitles are presented in English and the good news is that I didn't notice any bad subtitling errors or anything problematic.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Kung Fu Dunk"" comes with the following special features:

Please note: This is an all-region Blu-ray but there are times with European Blu-ray special features will not work on American Region A players.  For ""Kung Fu Dunk"", I was able to play the special features with no problems.

JUDGMENT CALL:

First, let me just say that I was really looking forward to this film.  As a big fan of music from Jay Chou and even TWINS member Charlene Choi, I felt that their pairing would be something unique and enjoyable.  And as a fan of Eric Tsang and seeing how he was there for HK actor Nicholas Tse when he first started out on film, I figured that Tsang would be a wonderful father-like figure for Jay Chou's character in ""Slam Dunk"".

But when I heard that the film was going to be more like ""Shaolin Soccer"", my skepticism for the film reached it's peak.  I couldn't fathom it.  If anything, memories of the video game ""NBA Jam"" came to mind and I imagined there would be high flying, crazy looking slam dunks and after watching this film, I was right.

The good news is that some action sequences were quite entertaining and the cameo by a few of the stars from ""Shaolin Soccer"" making their appearance on ""Kung Fu Dunk"" was pretty cool.  But unfortunately, the plot of the film is extremely kitschy.  After seeing Chou in ""Initial D"", I figured that this film would bring him more emotional depth but he's playing a stoic character and if anything, putting the talent in a martial arts position.  Nothing wrong with that, since it's common to see this in films, especially HK films.

But the build-up to the battle against the rivals wasn't as impressive as ""Shaolin Soccer"".  You felt the emotion of when the team was beaten by their rivals.  In ""Kung Fu Dunk"", everything was all over the place and to make things worse was the inclusion of ""time travel"" via martial arts.

Unfortunately, unless you are a hardcore fan of Jay Chou, Charlene Choi or any of the talent...""Kung Fu Dunk"" is a film that has its few enjoyable moments but mostly moments because of a badly written screenplay that the characters are not well-utilized, too many variables thrown in and as mentioned, everything looked like it was all over the place.

Where ""Shaolin Soccer"" focused on team dynamics, taking on a bad team and a relationship angle for the protagonist, in ""Kung Fu Dunk"", the viewer has to deal with not just those elements but also a relationship between Fang and Wang, Fang looking for his real parents, the inclusion of his martial arts teachers in a basketball match (which was not done well at all) and did I mention ""time travel"".  ""Shaolin Soccer"" kept things simple and utilized its characters effectively, director Kevin Chu may have been the action director of ""Shaolin Soccer"" but somehow his directorial effort in this film was poorly executed and part of it has to do with its ambitious screenplay of trying to have so many characters with too many variables.

As for the Blu-ray, you do get a lot of special features and a good looking film but unfortunately no lossless track.  Granted, I can chalk that up to this being a 2008 release (and its Hollywood counterparts doing the same thing for their older Blu-ray releases).

Overall, ""Kung Fu Dunk"" is a film that I was longing to see and in the end, I felt disappointed.  I've read that there will be a sequel and I can only hope that the writing for the film is much better than the first.",1279238400,,6321,4.681776971894832
1128763,5,7798954635,"The film explores nothing new in either martial arts or sports film but where it exceeds is in bringing the two genres together in a seamless, novel and entertaining combination which results in ""the sum being greater than its parts"". The moral subplots of commitment, ""being true to one's self"" and pursuing a dream helped build the characters. The acting and script conveyed both the comedic and action scenes without being over-indulgent thus allowing the movie to visually speak for itself. The sets were definitely a visual plus. The wire fighting and basketball scenes were performed well enough to convey their intent without being excessive as if often found in martial movies.  If you're a fan of either genre and don't want melodramatic story telling but a fun visual experience then kick back and enjoy ""Kung Fu Dunk"".",1240531200,2,829,5.007246376811594
1128764,5,7798954635,"This movie is classic fun in the vein of Kung Fu Hustle and Shaolin soccer. It is a heart-warming story about two wanderers who help one another out in order to get fame, but end up with a lasting friendship instead. The Kung Fu is cool and the basketball team is a great showcase for their special skills. An overall good time, anybody hating on this movie is too serious as this is a light-hearted story infused with comedy and martial arts. Dunking makes me happy!",1230854400,2,467,4.441860465116279

1128766,2,7798954635,"An orphaned boy Fang Shi-Jie (Jay Chou, ""Curse of the Golden Flower"") grows up to be a student of a kung fu school. Shi-Jie eventually leaves the school, however, after getting involved with a brawl, and meeting a small-time, down-and-out hustler Wang Li (Eric Tsang, ""Infernal Affairs"" trilogy), who discovers the young Shi-Jie's talent as basketball player. This is how the story of ""Kung Fu Dunk"" begins.

""Kung Fu Dunk,"" which unashamedly borrows the concept of ""Kung Fu Soccer,"" is in fact a hodge-podge of half-baked ideas that sit uncomfortably together. Director Yen-ping Chu throws in many jokes and actions, disregarding the storyline or any logics (OK, this is his style, right?), but the jokes and actions are just unfunny and unexciting.

For all you can see is those basketball players (including Chen Bo-lin and Baron Chen) passing and shooting helped by wire stunts. Four teachers of kung fu school arrive and are allowed to join the ""game,"" which means doing kung fu fighting in the basketball court. Apparently one master taught his pupil how to ""freeze"" the time and rewind it, something Christopher Reeve's Superman did many years ago. And don't forget the subplot about the parentage of Shi-Jie.

""Kung Fu Dunk"" asks us to embrace its chaos and enjoy it. I like chaotic comedy - ""chaotic"" could be anything from ""The Marx Brothers"" to ""ZAZ"" or Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker - but this chaos is not just hilarious. Stephen Chow successfully incorporated kung fu into soccer to great comedic effect. However, the kung fu elements (kicking, punching etc.) have no place in the plot (or the basketball court) of ""Kung Fu Dunk.""

The director gives it a try anyway, not knowing how to use the sports factors in comedy and action. The result is just a mess. Jay Chou (who was much better in ""Curse of the Golden Flower"") looks terribly bored; and so do Chen Bo-lin and Baron Chen. As to Charlene Choi, her job seems to stand and smile before the camera and nothing more.

At the time of writing, some sources including internet site IMDb cite the name of Japanese manga creator Takehiko Inoue (known for his ""SLUM DUNK"") as the basis of the film. ""Kung Fu Dunk"" might have been inspired by the story of this hugely popular comic, but the fact is the film's story or characters have nothing to do with the manga (as far as I remember, I couldn't find the name of Inoue in the credits).",1218931200,3,2397,4.752403846153846

1129033,4,7798954635,"Wholesome, family-friendly fun.  You may need to struggle through some subtitles, but this is way better than any of that Air Bud nonsense.

Our story begins with great cinematography (only early in the movie), an orphaned infant and a note.  The child is raised by a kung fu master and trained with all of the clichd wisdom behind the yins, yangs and qi (""chi"") of the universe and one's self.  After the untimely death of his master, Fang Shijie (Jay Chou) grows up as a kind-hearted yet semi-rebellious kung fu student.

Fang gets involved with some of the wrong people and gets expelled from his kung fu school.  But his skillful aim is quickly discovered by friendly hustler who directs his hands to basketball.  It turns out that Fang's skill in kung fu translates well, making him a 100% free thrower even from half court...that is, when there's no pressure or opposition.  His greatest opposition is from the team captain, who has a drinking problem that is presented in a rather family-friendly way.

Fang needs to learn the basic skills of the game and teamwork to be able to utilize his world class arm.  Through the support of his teammates and hard work he develops into a fine player.

Strong elements of comedy and classic kung fu theater action-isms mesh well with modern, stylistic camerawork.  The fighting and stunts are good (not great), and are not the focus of this movie after the first act.  This movie is about basketball and teamwork.

The greatest thing about this movie is that Fang's skill is never met with arrogance.  He is always humble.  He wants to be an appreciated member of the team in addition to showing what he can do.  He also helps his team captain ""defeat"" his drinking problem.

The only bad thing about this family flick is part of the finale during the final game.  At this point hokey-wholesome turns uber-ridiculous when Fang's kung fu school masters come to his aid with their weird, Harry Potter-esque personalities.  This scene also made everything about Fang instead of him being part of the team.  Thankfully, after 5-10 minutes of this, it's back to teamwork along with an unfortunately slow but happy ending.",1366588800,,2163,4.776280323450135

Too many scenes show The Loser making ridiculous faces directly into the camera, which destroys any immersion you may have been experiencing during the brief well-paced parts.

Where Shaolin Soccer has character development that draws you in, Kung Fu Drunk has fuzzy flashbacks to earlier in the film to remind you what you were trying to forget.

Overall I thought this movie is a guaranteed laugh-out-loud movie (plenty of gags all around) and great for the family who loves fighting mixed with comedy. The movie doesn't make sense at first, but it all makes sense in the end as all the pieces goes together. I love how this movie is so heartwarming and unpredictable. There are a lot of scenes though with smoking and drinking in this movie, that's about it if you're worried about what the kids are going to see but it goes with the comedy of this movie.

The rules (and real life physics) of basketball obviously does not apply in this movie, but it was still entertaining for me as the scenes also did not look computer generated to me. This movie reminded me a lot of the anime ""Slam Dunk"" which I assume they got their inspiration from there. The fight scenes are adequate, I thought it was not too much and not too little. Some scenes also does not make sense (seems cut off) as there were some stuff that was left unexplained and some fight scenes looked cut off as well as it looked like different takes stitched together.
