7829630,5,630268269X,"For a typical young boy, this is clean pure and funny for them.  Why is this no longer offered.  Put on DVD and re-release it.  I am sure there will be those who will buy it.  Not sure why it was available on Amazon Prime video and then taken off.  Anyway, it is a good intro for boys to spark their curiosity in martial arts.  Bring it back please.",1517270400,,349,3.9855072463768115
7829631,1,630268269X,"I never got off the ox cart.  Fortunately the player crashed and I didn't get to see any more.  This is the epitome of bad 80's kid movie.  Think of the Goonies made with bad acting, bad script, and no budget.  Actually I take that back the kids are better actors than the Mom.  As to the props in the ""sword"" fight, my six year old grandson made a better fake knife out of safety scissors.",1490486400,,390,4.078947368421052

7829634,3,630268269X,"Old little movie but wildly hilarious in laughing at the ""acting"". My kids Also laughed and there were not bad words--glad of that, but definitely an '80s produced film. Not TV's best decade--",1486166400,,192,4.848484848484849
7829635,3,630268269X,Its a okay family film however I feel after watching it is stole a lot of material from the '3 ninjas' movie making it no better than the concept.,1479168000,,146,4.068965517241379
7829636,5,630268269X,"This was one of my favorites as a child.  Jonathan Anzaldo, playing the role of Jon, provides another stunning, captivating performance.  He clearly has innate talent for performing and acting, exemplified by his commitment to the role.  I also recommend 3 Little Ninjas and the Lost Treasure for your child.",1329350400,,308,5.12

7829638,5,630268269X,"This movie rocks the world!  It's about three overconfident kids who think they can beat adults at martial arts, but believe it or not, they can!  Not to be confused with 3 Ninjas, a pale comparison, this movie combines the best of 5th grader mayhem, a la Home Alone, and martial arts action.  The villain in this movie is an excellent actor, and quite skilled in the use of plastic swords. He ""must have the map!""  A must have for the whole family!",975715200,2,449,4.373493975903615
