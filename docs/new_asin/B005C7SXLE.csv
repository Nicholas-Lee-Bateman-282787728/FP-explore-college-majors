4651783,5,B005C7SXLE,"I don't know what it is about Chuggington, but my 5-year-old son is ""abso-toot-tootly"" entranced by the adventures of Koko, Brewster, and Wilson. He's got all the videos and frequently begs to watch them. We restrict his screen time, but these videos are nice and short -- 10 minutes each -- and they have a nice innocent quality about them, so I let him watch fairly often.

If you're browsing this review, you probably already know Chuggington is basically a Thomas the Tank Engine redux. The key differences are the look of the characters (less ""creepy""/scary than Thomas, in my opinion), and the fact that the lead characters in Chuggington seem to be very young, while most of the Thomas characters seem to be adolescent or older. The three ""trainee"" characters get into adventures, learn valuable lessons, yadda yadda, you know, the usual. But it's well executed and has flashes of humor (particularly in recurring characters like the ridiculous flying superhero, ""Action Chugger"" [not seen in this DVD] and the doddering ""Old Puffer Pete""). The episodes move fast and, all told, I really enjoy sitting down to a Chuggington or two with my happy boy.

The adventures in this DVD are:

  ""The Chugger Championship"" -- All the chuggers compete in the annual Chugger Championship to see who is the fastest

  ""Helpful Hodge"" -- Wilson and Koko compete to see who can complete the most ""helpful"" tasks in a day

  ""Cool Wilson"" -- Brewster and Wilson vie to be assistants to the ice-cream train, ""The Great Frostini""

  ""Brewster's Hobby"" -- Brewster the train has a new hobby, ""people-spotting,"" (LOL), and it interferes with his work

  ""Wake Up Wilson"" -- Wilson and Koko stay up very late one night, with near-disastrous results

  ""Koko Pulls It Off"" -- The three trainees face a nerve-wracking test of passenger train-pulling skills

As of this writing, some can be previewed on the Disney Junior website, so if you're uncertain, check out a sample there. Or just take my word for it: These bright, cheerful and fast-moving adventures will enthrall any train-loving child.",1318464000,20,2080,4.953757225433526
4651784,5,B005C7SXLE,"Like many young boys, my grandson LOVES trains!!  I've seen many evolutions of the ""Thomas"" stories, from the creepy remote control type days, through the cartoon, to the computer animation now.  He likes these also - but when I got him Chuggington, it was another thing altogether!!  He CANNOT get enough.. and he has memorized the song (Which I admit gets completely stuck in my head ALL the time!!)  It's fun, upbeat and made for young kids.  All of the episodes teach a lesson, whether it's going too fast, not listening to directions, treating others kindly, etc.  and they are short episodes, so there is no waiting forever when it's ""Just ONE more show, Grammie.. pleeeeeease!!""",1378166400,,685,4.862068965517241
4651785,5,B005C7SXLE,My grandson loves Chuggington! Very entertaining for a 3 year old. He loves trains and the characters are great on this video.,1377043200,,126,4.7727272727272725
4651786,5,B005C7SXLE,My son's babysitter got him hooked on Chuggington. I don't like my kids watching mindlesss TV shows and with my littlest one (he is only 7 months old) this definitely takes the cake. This is the only show he stops dead doing what he's doing to watch and the storylines are so cute and teach so many lessons that I welcomed having my little guy watch Chuggington. Definitely better than Thomas the Train because there is no narrator and the trains are so cute and talk on their own they really capture my son's attention. LOVE LOVE LOVE! A must have for your little guy!!,1364774400,,570,4.438095238095238
4651787,5,B005C7SXLE,"I plan to order more videos.  Good wholesome entertainment.  I enjoy seeing the excitement in my grandchildren's eyes when they tell me names of the engines, etc.",1357430400,,162,4.962962962962963
4651788,5,B005C7SXLE,"My son is obsessed with Chuggington!  This dvd is great, especially for road trips because you can watch more than one show back to back (which I normally wouldn't let him do).  On this particular dvd all of the chuggers have Canadian accents, so it's not the US version you would see on Disney Junior.  I think it's actually pretty cool though and I don't think my 2 yr old son even notices the difference, at least not yet.",1339113600,,425,4.3544303797468356

4651791,5,B005C7SXLE,My 2 year old loves anything Chuggington.  He watches all the Chuggington videos over and over again.  The videos always have a moral to the story which helps teaching him how to play and work with others.,1321574400,2,205,4.513513513513513
4651792,5,B005C7SXLE,grandson that plays with all kind of trains  books wood track thomas trains  trains that go by georgia  lionel display train trains on tv  ts georgia  loves the whistle bell and any other train sounds,1320624000,,200,4.6
4651793,5,B005C7SXLE,"Our little boy (three-years old) just loves any kind of heavy equipment. It's amazing! The highlight of the week is the arrival of the garbage truck coming down our street and picking up the containers. A trip down to the airport to watch planes land and take off brings joy and excitement. A ride on the San Diego Trolley (a light rail system) beats Disneyland.

In any case, he loves this kind of stuff. As such, my wife brought a DVD titled ""Chuggington: The Chugger Championship"" home for him to watch. It's a lightweight cartoon about a rail-yard system in a city and a variety of competitions between the trains (each given it's own name). The DVD is divided into about a half dozen smaller stories in which the individually-named trains (called trainees) go through a simple series of activities. I find the stories corny, but mildly amusing, but the movie isn't meant for me. It's meant for a child. The short nature of the individual stories doesn't exceed my child''s attention span, Story follows story and the kid is just glued to watching the TV. It's amazing! In my opinion, the trains are overly animated and the voices are overly acted. No matter. The brightly-colored little trains captivate my kid, and that's what counts. The music is  simple and infectious and the sound on my stereo system is fairly good.

We sat down on the couch, I put my arm around the little guy and we watched the entire DVD without the slightest interruption. It had his undivided attention. When it was over, the boy wanted to watch it again. Now, I'd say that was a real successful children's cartoon.
