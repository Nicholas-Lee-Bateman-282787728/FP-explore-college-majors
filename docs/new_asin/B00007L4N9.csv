7978003,3,B00007L4N9,"An American widow (Adrienne Barbeau) moves to a Greek island with her son and their dog. She makes a simple life away from technology. One day while traversing a deserted stretch of beach they come upon a naked man (Keir Dullea.) He apparently washed ashore. On his back is an imprinted magnetic number. They befriend the stranger give him cloths, drugs, money and sex. In return they find out where he is from and that he just missed seeing his brother by two days or two millennia.
Can he ever go back?
If so will he ever return?
What would you do?

The story is more a study of human nature than it is sci-fi or time travel.

You may recognize Keir Dullea from ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968).
Of course we all recognize Adrienne Barbeau as Dr. Kurtz in ""Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death"" (1988). ""We eat our men""",1485043200,,828,4.405228758169935

7978006,2,B00007L4N9,This movie was not the movie I thought it was but it was okay for the money I would rather have something else.,1353801600,,111,3.869565217391304
7978007,4,B00007L4N9,"The difference between this film and a generic Hollywood bigger budget film is the scenery is used to it's advantage and the special effects are not the star. Acting is excellent, the plot will get you thinking. You will be able to absord this film compared to other similar films which are mainly chase films.",1351641600,,310,4.654545454545454

7978009,3,B00007L4N9,"Director Nico Mastorakis blames director John Carpenter for stealing ideas from The Time Traveler for his film Starman. No doubt there are some similarities, but overall Carpenter did it MUCH better. This film portrays a person from the future (not an alien) traveling back in time and is taken under the wing of a family. He needs their help to get back to his own time or he will die. If you can find this cheap, then go for it because it isn't too bad of a film. Otherwise spend the extra and purchase Starman instead.",1105833600,26,521,4.4375
7978010,2,B00007L4N9,I bought this DVD because I'm a big fan of Adrenne Barbeau. Boy is she hot. One sexy lady. The movie isn't too bad. This one  would be good for younger kids. Pretty good DVD transfer.,1098316800,14,183,4.083333333333333
