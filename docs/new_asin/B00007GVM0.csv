1809893,5,B00007GVM0,"First of all the Amish women wear white prayer veilings/ coverings.  They are not bonnets. Bonnets are black and/or dark blue and worn over the prayer veiling.
This movie moved me to tears.  I am a Mennonite who grew up among the Old Order Amish and Old Order Mennonites in Lancaster County Pennsylvania.  Many visitors do not understand our way of life.  People complain that the Amish are not well educated, well just last week I had an 8 year old Amish girl wait on me at her father's store.  She tallied the five items that I bought on a battery operated cash register and cheerfully gave me the correct change counting it out into my hand.  This is in such contrast to the urban young man I met about a month ago at McDonalds who although he gave me the incorrect change, argued with me for about three minutes until he finally, finally saw that he had made a mistake and then still had a major attitude because I pointed out that he had given me the incorrect change.
Many people do not understand us of Anabaptist origins.  They romanticize the Amish, they act like they are somehow holier than thou, etc. etc.  The Amish themselves realize how human they are.
We are descendants of the most radical wing of the Reformation.  Only once you are an adult and are able to choose for yourself are you expected to ""join church"" and take that baptismal vow.  The Amish take that promise perhaps too strongly.  My own parents suggested that ""you join our church because you are living with us now, but when you move away from home feel free to join another church.""
Perhaps the most moving part of the movie to me is when Faron takes out the Ausbund, the oldest Protestant hymnbook in continuous use and talks about the people from the 16th century being able to die for their faith.  In spite of talking like a street hoodlum, Faron respects the deep conviction that our Anabaptist foreparents had in being willing to die for their faith. He says ""those people were willing to die for their faith, man I don't know if I could do that.""
I am somewhat passionate in my defense of the Amish faith.  The movie represents that ALL young people go through this phase.  However, not all are as rebellious as these young people.  Many remain at home and eventually join the church of their parents without being too wild.  Some gatherings are hymnsings and not wild beer, drug induced orgies.  The filmmaker of course would not have been able to interview such young people, because they would not allow themselves to be interviewed.
This film is to be commended for its documentation of young Amish persons who are going through a rite of passage.  The human spirit remains bouyant and almost 90% rejoin the church of their parents.  Remaining in the Amish community has been likened by some in choosing to join a religious order.  There is safety, contentment and acceptance for you if you follow the Ordnung.

1809894,2,B00007GVM0,"""Amish kids got the best parties.  They got the wild parties.""  How can  you go wrong with a documentary about Amish teenagers smoking, drinking, and dealing drugs, bowling, roller skating, and taking the none-too-occasional bong rip?  Unfortunately, pretty wrong.  An awesome subject matter is completely underwhelmed in this uninspired, rhythmically challenged, visually amateurish  and all around clunky film.  See it?  Sure.

1809895,4,B00007GVM0,"The subject matter of ""Devil's Playground"" makes it sound like a bad comedy sketch: It's about Amish kids gone wild.
That description evokes images of girls in white bonnets partying down, and chain-smoking boys cruising around in their buggies. And while the movie does in fact present such scenes, it's actually a serious, non-glamorizing, non-patronizing look at cultures, religion and youth.
When children in the Amish community turn 16, they enter a period called rumspringa, during which they're exempt from the restrictions of the church and are allowed to experience the outside world before deciding whether or not they want to permanently commit to the Amish way of life - they have to face temptation before they can reject it.
And the teens in ""Devil's Playground"" almost immediately take to temptation and what they call the ""English"" culture like nobody's business. They don baggy jeans and visors and doo-rags, get pierced, absorb videogames and MTV, buy cars and move out of their parents' homes.
 ""If I was living at home,"" says one Amish teen, ""I couldn't have 200 channels of DirecTV, stereo, Nintendo and a fridge full of beer.""
""Devil's Playground"" focuses on several different teens during their rumspringa:
One moves into a small trailer and hosts a seemingly non-stop party for two years before he simply decides to go home and commit to his religion.
Another leaves behind her family and fiancee so she can go to college, and the scene in which she tries on the plain dark wedding dress she made as a girl but no longer needs is both terribly sad and incredibly hopeful at the same time.
But the central figure in the movie is Faron, a preacher's son and a methamphetamine dealer whose life spirals out of control and into serious trouble, on camera. Faron's ups-and-downs are vividly chronicled, and even when he's making terrible decisions he's an interesting and articulate presence.
By the end of the movie - at which point it's claimed that about 90% of Amish teens do eventually commit to their religion for life - he's become an unlikely but sympathetic spokesperson for a group he appears to be leaving behind.
""Devil's Playground"" is a surprisingly sober, thoughtful and provocative film that casts an objective eye on an unusual phenomenon. The DVD includes an incredibly informative commentary by writer-director Lucy Walker, producer Steven Cantor and editor Pax Wassermann, who explain how they got access to the Amish community, how they found their subjects and how they organized the stories and information they gathered.",1052611200,34,2563,5.0591016548463354

1809897,4,B00007GVM0,"A few years ago after my grandmother died an Amish family tried to buy her farm.  They seemed like friendly God-fearing and simple people to me.  I thought that they were naive.  Then I saw newspaper stories of how most of the drug trade in her area was being run by Amish and how Amish youth - and Amish ""biker gangs"" had a reputation for being the roughest segment in the community.  The newspaper stories didn't make sense to my preconceptions of what the Amish were like and the typical stereotypes about them.
How do you learn about the Amish?  Most books written about them or novels/movies with Amish characters are written by people who aren't Amish.  This movie deals with Amish youth, but interviews actual Amish people.  Now things make sense to me.
When Amish turn 16 they begin Rumspringa - which translates into ""running around.""  They have the next 5 years to decide whether or not they will ""go to heaven or to hell"" as some of the Amish in the movie put it.  They leave their Amish way of life to enjoy the comfort and temptations of the outside world.  By the time they turn 21 they have to decide whether they are going to return to the Amish church - and way of life - forever - or live in the outside world and be disowned by their family.
90% of the Amish return to the Amish church.  In the movie you can see why.  With little education or job skills they have a difficult finding away to have a good life in the outside world.  It easier for them to go back to the stability and comfort of their families - get married and build a family for themselves.  As one of the Amish adults in the movie put it - they have a more easy going and stress free life than those on the outside.
That's the positive way to look at things.  The negative is that they have to give up their independence and individuality to the greater community, which cannot be an easy thing.
The Amish use of technology is an example.  Cars are dangerous because they would provide mobility and bring Amish to the outside community.  TV's provide temptations and would cause Amish to think about leaving.  However, a battery pack is no problem.  Everything is centered around the larger community.
Movie gives a great glimpse into Amish life in their own words.",1046908800,20,2253,4.424757281553398
1809898,3,B00007GVM0,"If all you know about the Amish comes from seeing the movie ""Witness"" or passing the occasional buggy by the side of the road, many of the images in Lucy Walker's understated documentary will be jarring.  Girls in 19th century dresses chug beer from plastic cups, a small-time Amish crank dealer hides his stash inside a matchbox, and teenagers dance at a raucous party that, apart from the white bonnets dotting the crowd, could be happening anywhere.  The great achievement of Walker's film is to show how this is all less incongruous than it seems.
When Amish teenagers turn sixteen they are encouraged to leave their communities and experience the pleasures and conveniences of life in the outside ""English"" world.  This period is called Rumspringa (literally ""running around"") and is intended to ensure that the Amish who come back into the fold will have made a conscious choice to do so.  The appeal to free will is well-intentioned, but ultimately disingenuous.  When given their first taste of adult freedom, Amish teenagers do what any other teenagers do: they drink too much, have sex, and spend a lot of time driving around in cars.  For most teenagers this is just a phase.  For the Amish it's the preliminary to the most important decision of their life: whether or not to join the Amish church.  The subjects of Walker's documentary are no better prepared for the trials of adolescence than any other group of sixteen year olds, and it comes as no surprise that most of them, after a few tumultuous years, seem ready to return to a way of life that represents family, security, and a rock-solid sense of identity.
Rumspringa, an Amish elder says at one point, is really a vaccination.  You get just enough of a taste of the outside world so that when you give it up you won't wonder what you're missing.  His candor is winning, as is the level-headedness of most of the Amish elders Walker interviews.  Her main subjects are the kids, but they are in many ways like deeply religious small-town kids anywhere: confused and self-obsessed, but basically decent, and given to projecting a theological dimension onto the normal pains of growing up.  Beneath the strange clothing is a familiar conflict between piety and hell-raising.
It's in the interviews with Amish adults that the most intriguing aspects of Amish society are revealed.  Despite the horse-and-buggy trappings, the Amish are not opposed to technology per se, just technology that they consider disruptive to their way of life.  So cars and televisions are out, but a solar-powered battery charger is fine.  (You can imagine a hippie commune reaching a similar conclusion after much earnest debate.)  Their attitude towards sex, while hardly permissive, is surprisingly laid-back and pragmatic: a little premarital fooling around can be overlooked as long as it leads to an Amish marriage and Amish children.  The adults interviewed for this film come across as relaxed and candid, and have none of the prickly self-righteousness you find in other religious conservatives.  Their condemnations of the outside world are rote, without any real heat.  It appears that in choosing never to engage the modern world, either as participants or evangelicals, they feel little need to either judge it or defend themselves.  In their inwardness, the Amish seem more like Hasidic Jews than Christian fundamentalists.
But Hassids still drive cars.  Despite their conviction, you still come away wondering how long the Amish way of life can last.  In one telling interview, a preacher bemoans the way work has changed.  Fifty years ago, he says, Amish children would have stayed home and helped out on the farm.  Now they go to work in a factory, get some money, and the next thing you know, they want to buy a car.  Now here's a battle that started back when everyone drove a horse and buggy.  For family ties and religious values to overwhelm teenage rebellion is the easy part.  The hard part comes when an agrarian way of life squares off against factory jobs and pocket money.",1045440000,53,4045,4.927728613569322
1809899,5,B00007GVM0,"At first I missed this Documentary in Germany on TV. But than I bought this DVD, because there was no rerun un TV.
In fact I am glad I missed the much shorter TV-Version. This one is comprehensive and well timed. But most I liked the audio-commentary. There you got all the additional facts that explains what makes Rumspringa a difficult experience and about the limited view of the world that the young amish really have. Their limited knowledge of everything gives them only very limited options in life at best. The fate of Faron shows why. Though the end of the Dokumentary gives you hope about Faron's life, but in the audio-commentary you get the infos why his life will always be doomed.

1809905,5,B00007GVM0,"This is a very real look at what teenagers go through when they go through Rumspringa.  You follow these teens throughout the film, watching them grow, make mistakes and educate us on their Amish heritage.  It was raw and honest and I'm thankful they were willing to take us on their journeys.  Some chose to stay Amish and some decided to find their own dreams.

Emma Miller (Faron's former girlfriend) was last known to be living in London, England having graduated from college. The information I have for Gerald Yutzy (who owned the mobile home pictured in the film) is that he appears to be living a non-amish lifestyle. He is married and has a Facebook page which shows his wife and a little boy. Velda lives a life outside the Amish community with her husband and children.

Out of the teens profiled in the film, I believe, Joann Hochstetler was the only one who decided to be baptized in the amish church.  .",1390953600,2,917,4.560975609756097
1809906,4,B00007GVM0,"Yes, definitely one of my 5 favorite zombie flicks.  Very well done - w/ a decent plot and decent acting... Most will like this.",1386892800,,128,4.333333333333333
1809907,4,B00007GVM0,"Is it just me or whenever zombies take over the UK, it's usually a LOT better than when they take over any other part of the world?  Usually that's how it is!  Not sure why either.  The same type of zombie takeover just isn't as awesome when it's in America for example.

There's two things I love about Devil's Playground.  One, the script is incredibly simple to follow.  You will almost never get confused over any of the events taking place.  It's almost written for viewers who have no prior knowledge of zombie flicks and what these type of films are usually like/how they develop, which probably means more experienced and hardcore zombie lovers might find this movie somewhat boring (understandable, if so).

On the flipside, being easy to follow also means a few segments are really predictable.  I mean you *have* to know the guy who got bit on the arm in the boat was destined to turn into a zombie and subsequently turn on his friend, right?  It's only a matter of time.  Obvious writing.  But, I say who cares.  I enjoy the writing nonetheless.

I also love how we see something other than the traditional slower-moving more intimidating zombies.  These zombies are speed demons!  They have enhanced skills that the more ordinary type zombies from most zombie films *don't* have.  This means it takes more effort to bring them down... which means MORE awesome violence for us!  Don't just shoot at a zombies head and assume he's going to fall over dead- take a weapon and repeatedly BASH HIS BRAINS OUT to be sure he's dead!  I consider this a much welcomed breath of fresh air.  For the sake of being different and adding variety to a tired old formula, I appreciate a more aggressive approach to eliminating the zombies.  Again though- it's totally understandable if old school zombie lovers don't really like this change of direction.

Basically the storyline is that 6 people -some of which are only hanging together for the purpose of surviving and know nothing about the people they're with (which means they don't really trust each other in the slightest)- have to make a run for it and hide from the persistent zombies that always seem to be hot on their trail.  5 of the people are somewhat clueless and physically weak, so they always rely on the tougher guy of the group (played by Craig Fairbrass) to bail them out of a tough situation.

I believe there was another movie that focused on fast-moving zombies I watched a few years ago but I can't remember the name of it.  It wasn't as good as this one, however.  Highly recommended.",1374278400,,2557,4.651785714285714
1809908,1,B00007GVM0,"I found this movie so boring that I somehow wound up opening a new IE tab and reading articles until I wound up reading about wildlife habitat destruction in Uganda.  At this point I realinzed how terrible this movie is.  The zomibes are silly.  I get that they're supposed to be stronger and faster than a regualr person.  However, I can't understand their ability to perform technical gymnastic style diving front rolls and parkour-style obstacle jumps.  It should have been choreographed with the zombies moving more animalistically and less gymnastic floor routine.  The movie features the similar scene repeatedly: a character is running from one or more zombies giving chase.  The camera cuts bacl and forth between fast moving, wall climbing zombie and slow, stumbling human being chased.  Somehow the speedy, parkour expert zombie never quite catches up.  The zombies strength varies as well.  A zombie might throw a person across a scene and withstand pistol or shotgun round after round, then be subdued or choked by a person the next moment.  Still, my biggest beef with this flick is simply the aparent lack of vision, inspiration, or even effort.  It's the standard zombie story with silly, unrealistic action and boring, interchangeable scenes.  Wouldn't waste my $3.",1372896000,,1281,5.130434782608695
1809909,4,B00007GVM0,"""Devil's Playground"" is a good companion piece to ""Sons of Perdition,"" in that both films explore the way teens rebel against the repressive social strictures of the religious sects they grew up in. But there are differences. In ""Sons of Perdition"" the young people (most often young men) seek to escape a Fundamental Latter Day Saints church that has been ruled for years by the despotic but charismatic Warren Jeffs. ""Devil's Playground,"" on the other hand, explores the Amish tradition of Rumspringa, in which 16-year-olds are actually ALLOWED to do the mischievous things teens in the outer world take for granted. Problem is, these teens have very little social context in which to do those things the was most secular teens do, so they end up going stark raving NUTS. Is it any wonder that about 90% of them ultimately elect to rejoin their families and live in that isolated society?

1809925,2,B00007GVM0,"My support for the UK film industry continued with my purchase of Devil's Playground, a 2010 British zombie movie starring Danny Dyer, Craig Fairbrass and MyAnna Buring.

Devil's Playground is an action horror that shamelessly steals elements from 28 Days Later, Resident Evil and Doomsday. The greatest point for me (other than the vastly underused MyAnna Buring) would be the zombies/ infected here. Like me, if you are used to your zombies bumbling along, a la Romero or even fast hyper-aggressive bitey zombies like in the remake of Dawn of the Dead, then Devil's Playground may come as a bit of a surprise; what we have here are parkour zombies!

Unfortunately, these super agile zombies are not exploited to their full potential. Not enough is made of the chase scenes in this movie and subsequently lets itself down on this particular aspect.

Brit horror staple Sean Pertwee (Dog Soldiers) puts in a nice little turn here and Colin Salmon (Resident Evil) does corporate ruthlessness very well and a small role for Jaime Murray too. The film is effectively propped up by Fairbrass and Buring, two British actors who (along with the likes of Tamer Hassan) could really flourish in the right roles. Dyer once again is slotted in to a genre flick unnecessarily. To my mind, Dyer fits perfectly into the mockney gangster and cheeky chappy roles that he made a name for himself with but has as yet, failed to impress in roles in the horror genre of any significance.

There is very little more for me to say on Devil's Playground since the film lacks any real substance and is ultimately let down through what feels like sheer laziness. The plot is unoriginal, the dialogue is sub-standard, the characters are woefully under-developed and cliched; and the whole film rests on its low-budget set pieces and subsequently fails to hit the mark.",1352764800,,1843,4.878594249201278

1809928,3,B00007GVM0,"In 2010 I heard a British zombie film entitled The Devil's Playground was in the works. Well when I hear zombie film that doesn't always mean much these days. I hear about a lot of zombie films, many are never completed, many don't live up to their potential, so that doesn't always excite me. What DID excite me had nothing to do with the director, Mark McQueen, because honestly I hadn't seen any of his work until this point. Nor was I excited that it was going to be written by Bart Ruspoli as he had only written shorts that I had not seen until this point (though I did enjoy his acting in Band of Brothers and Rome.) What I WAS excited was that it was an action zombie film with Danny Dyer! The fact that Sean Pertwee(who we later find out is only in the film for almost no time whatsoever), MyAnna Buring, Craig Fairbrass, and the ever luscious Jaime Murray were also starring was also a plus.

SO with the cast being so well put together for an action zombie film it clearly has to be an instant success right? Well let me ask you something, honestly, how many of you have heard of the movie prior to this review? Or better yet how many of you have friends that have heard of it? The number is going to be pretty damn low and there's a reason for that. First though let's go over the movie itself shall we?

The film begins with a solid idea that there is a new performance-enhancing drug being tested across the UK. It's going well too - well until all of the test subjects start to die on them. Which isn't that bad until you first factor in that there are 29,000 test subjects. Talk about a lawsuit waiting to happen (that's the company's concern) but the real problem is none of these people are STAYING dead. Yes, zombies arise in the UK from drug testing and it's a completely original concept (since the Rage Virus in 28 Days Later doesn't produce zombies.)

We quickly move to follow one of the employees of Newgen (the company performing the tests) as he strives to find the one test subject who is not infected - hoping they can use her to create a cure. The employee is.... not Dryer who I originally thought would be the main character in the film and actually ended up being Craig Fairbrass's character. That's fine - he actually did a great job with what was written for him but Jamie Murray and Dryer really received pretty stunted roles they couldn't do much with and while it was good to see Sean Pertwee in the film he was off screen almost as quickly as he showed up.

At any rate Joe (Fairbrass) realizes he's got too much blood on his hands from cleaning up after Newgen and wants to do the right thing. He wants to help recover the girl to have a cure made, not for the company but for humanity. On his way out the door he's bitten and finds 3 'stabilizers' which are going to keep the zombie virus from taking him over for a little bit - but it won't be forever.

Don't get me wrong - the action sequences were good. We had fast zombies (yes I prefer slow ones) causing a menace trying to slow down our characters from getting to their goal of safety but the fight and running scenes were just done well - they just weren't done enough (and you didn't care about the characters enough) to feel any suspense.

There's a lot of gore, a lot of great shots, and a lot of roles that were cast well but just from a lack of dialogue and proper situations did not give the actors a real chance to shine. I'm more than a bit let down by this one as I loved the cast but I just could not love the film.",1349049600,,3524,4.228826151560178

The graphics in this movie were really quite awesome, there was even two parts that had me staring mouth agape at the brutality of it all. The zombies were extraordinarily aggressive, I like to call them zombie ninjas, another person described it as ""28 days later on crack"" which I think is good too. The plot wasn't impressive, not bad or ridiculous, just not impressive, and the acting was good. But in the end, all that really matters is the killing, and it had plenty of that. Watch it!

1809936,3,B00007GVM0,"You'd think, with a title like Devil's Playground, this movie would have some supernatural angle to it. That isn't the case with this movie.

A mercenary named Cole is tasked with bringing her in but, not only will he battle all manner of zombie to get to her, he's battling demons of his past as well.

While this movie was relatively entertaining, I'm afraid it felt too much like I'd seen this one somewhere before. It seemed like a cross between 28 Days/Weeks Later,the Resident Evil movies, and Children of Men to me. Course, I'm not the only one who sees that relation, lol. At any rate, I really wanted to like this one but there are so many other low-budget zombie apocalypse movies out there that do it much better with a new spin on things, to boot. The actors did a pretty good job of things. The cinematography and production were also good, so-for all intents and purposes- this movie should've kicked some tail...but it didn't do much, at all, for me. At times, it rocked. Then, other times, it didn't. Seems I was bored more than I was excited.

Devil's Playground is great for a rental but, as far as a definite purchase, I'd pass on that one. You'll be wishing you spent that money on something more deserving.

1809945,3,B00007GVM0,"<strong>Devil's Playground</strong> (Mark McQueen, 2010)

<em>Devil's Playground</em>, the debut feature from director Mark McQueen (<em>The Only Way Is Essex</em>) and scriptwriter Bart Ruspoli (you may remember him in front of the camera in <em>Band of Brothers</em>) is unapologetic <em>28 Days Later...</em> fanfic that, let's face it, is probably only worth watching if you're a fan of one or more of the principals. The thing is, I can't imagine anyone not being a fan of at least one of the principals, a number of whom have made their mark in both British and American movies and television over the past decade: Danny Dyer (<em>Doghouse</em>), Colin Salmon (<em>Resident Evil</em>), MyAnna Buring (<em>The Descent</em>), Sean Pertwee (<em>Event Horizon</em>), Jaime Murray (<em>Dexter</em>), Craig Fairbrass (<em>Prime Suspect 2</em>)... the list goes on. It's fun, it's predictable, it's well-acted (though as a number of reviews have noted, the actors are doing they best they can with a watery script), it's a pretty much perfect piece of turn-your-brain-off entertainment.

Which would normally be everything I have to say about this movie, but I want to point out one interesting thing that may have affected my judgment (other than my being an unapologetic Danny Dyer fanboy). I've read a number of comments on the film that mention parkour. I didn't even notice, in the same way I didn't notice the bullet-time sequences in <em>The Matrix</em> until it was pointed out to me a couple of years later that this was, in fact, A Thing. Unlike <em>The Matrix</em>'s bullet-time, which seems to have made a lot of people say ""wow, that's cool"" to a movie with an utterly generic script and lackluster-at-best acting, <em>Devil's Playground</em>'s parkour seems to have garnered the opposite reaction. And unfortunately, my mentioning it means that if you now go off and watch the movie you're not going to be able to not notice it. But at least you'll be prepared. In any case, just turn your brain off and have fun with it. ***",1341532800,,2038,5.172727272727273
1809946,2,B00007GVM0,"i find that horror films which lack any sense of humor generally also suffer from poor writing all around.  Like Underworld, which i finally saw for the first time recently, Devil's Playground just takes itself way too seriously.  it tries to take on an air of, i suppose, 'reality' (i get more than enough of that in, you know, real life), but what you end up with is a bunch of angry, snappy, manipulative characters spewing out rather dull, unimaginative dialog.  Without humor, and i mean relentlessly without it, i just don't really care about any of these characters or their relationships or situations, or whether they'll even survive.  in this film i would have been fine with everybody snuffing it.  A far better zombie film is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dead-Snow/dp/B0058ZWWEY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dead Snow</a>, which had more natural acting and interplay between the characters, along with hefty doses of humor and irony.  In that same vein, another truly scary, very funny, and brilliantly crafted horror flick (which incidentally contains Danny Dyer) is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Severance/dp/B000SM6FM2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Severance</a>, which i highly recommend.  That said, Devil's Playground is fine if you're looking for high-speed, non-stop, very red scenes of mayhem and cannibal chaos without being concerned about dialog (one test of a good script is whether it's enjoyable as merely audio)... but otherwise this movie's worth missing if your interests lie in quality writing and thoughtful storytelling, both of which are rarities in the over-saturated world of cinema.",1340668800,,1705,6.049792531120332

1809950,4,B00007GVM0,"Devil's Playground by British horror filmmaker Mark McQueen was a surprisingly entertaining, albeit flawed zombie film from across the pond. It is set in present-day London where it begins in medias res a hard-looking man all bloodied going by the name of Cole (played by Craig Fairbass) who uses a computer's webcam to record the events which has transpired to bring him to his current state.

We soon go back to the beginning of the crisis which starts from the human-testing of a new drug by the pharmaceutical company N-Gen. Of the 30,000 test-subjects only one doesn't succumb to the deadly side-effects of the drug which causes those injected to transform into ravening, cannibalistic killers who also happen to have had their agility amplified that they're able to parkour their way towards the uninfected.

Yes, you heard right, parkour zombies. That gimmick alone attached to the current trend of fast-moving zombies gives this film an edge over most fast-running zombie films.

Devil's Playground doesn't just try to make things interesting with a new brand of zombie-infected killers, but manages to create a story around the usual ""man on a mission"" plot. Cole has to find the only test subject who didn't succumb to the experimental drug's side-effects in hopes that this person carries the means to help end the spread of the virus. The cast itself helps in making this horror film rise above the usual dreck that gets released on video. While I've never been a fan of British ""tough guy"" actor Danny Dyer he wasn't as annoying in this film as he is in others and it's due to the performance by Craig Fairbass as the hardened mercenary Cole which makes Dyer's dishonored cop Joe from chewing everything in the scene he appears in.

Director Mark McQueen does a good job in keeping the story moving forward even as he juggles subplot involving a couple of London river cops trying to find a safe haven in a city that's going through a deadly crisis of apocalyptic proportion. Even the free-running zombies don't come across as laughable and at times even come across as quite horrifying when Cole and his small band of survivors try to move from haven to haven in the hopes of getting the one who may be the key to solving the crisis to the right people.

Devil's Playground may not join the ranks of the classic zombie films since Romero's Night of the Living Dead changed the world of horror in 1968, but it manages to be both entertaining and scary despite the parkour zombies.",1338595200,,2493,4.774941995359629

1809955,5,B00007GVM0,"Why do people who clearly hate zombie movies keep watching, let alone reviewing, them?  One after another zombie movie gets shot down until only the absolute grossest are left standing?  Apparently, unless every single aspect of every single zombie attack on every single victim is depicted in the most wrenchingly graphic detail, with full zoom in full effect, the movie's a bust.  When I try to imagine the kind of zombie movie that would appeal to such zombie fans, all I can conjure up is a twelve year old with ADD picking his nose while he farts continuously and wails over and over ""I'm bored! I'm bored!  I want to see people getting torn apart every second!  I'm bored!.""  Here's a news flash: there is such a think as suspense, and two thirds of any good horror movie consists of building the suspense so that when whatever it is that's going to happen happens, it's actually scary.  Sorry, but the grossness of the attack is no substitute for the suspense leading up to it.

That said, ""Devil's Playground"" is a great zombie movie.  Note that I didn't say ""a great movie"" but rather ""a great zombie movie.""  If I want to see a great movie, I'll watch something like ""The Mayor of Casterbridge.""  Face it, there are only so many plot devices possible in a zombie movie - the number one being which of the lead characters will make it, which will not.  So it was with ""Devil's Playground.""  Yes, you can pretty well tell who definitely won't make it - e.g., the elite couple who got rescued and tagged along with their rescuers looking for a chance to ditch them and save themselves; but you can't always tell who maybe won't make it - e.g., Steve, best friend of Angie' husband Joe; or Angie' brother Matthew or his wife (I never did get her name); or Cole, the only employee of N-Gen to survive, N-Gen being the biotech company whose experiments in marketing a new high-energy supplement created the zombies in the first place.  In other words, in terms of zombie movies: who will get bitten, who will not.

One of the things that makes a great zombie movie great is atmosphere.  ""Resident Evil"" had it, as did ""28 Days Later"" - and so, too, does ""Devil's Playground"" have it.  First there's the sterile atmosphere of the company's lab; then the atmosphere of the city as Angie and her sister-in-law attempt to escape the madness; then the atmosphere of the countryside, where all zombies eventually congregate; and, finally, the atmosphere of the warehouse district, where a helicopter is known to sit.  So, of course, all roads lead all characters to that enchanted rooftop where rescue for anyone who makes it is only a flight in a whirlybird away. Or not.

Along with the handling of the usual zombie elements, ""Devil's Playground"" has at least two trump cards: Danny Dyer and Craig Fairbrass.  So don't anybody dare diss the acting!  Dyer as Joe and, especially, Fairbrass as Cole are nothing short of superb!  Oh, by the way, here's another news flash: if a movie - even a zombie movie - is lucky enough to get such actors as Danny Dyer and Craig Fairbrass, it has to put a little extra meat on the characters' psyches to better showcase their talent.  Translated for twelve year olds: yeah, it's gonna get a little boring for you.",1334448000,8,3248,4.620209059233449

1809970,5,B00007GVM0,I became completely absorbed watching this DVD.  I have always been interested in different religions. The stories are so interesting and sometimes tragic.  It's quite an education.  I've probably watched this DVD 3 or 4 times.,1274572800,,227,5.25
1809971,4,B00007GVM0,"When most people think of the Amish they probably think of a group that tenaciously clings to ""the old ways"" in the name of religion. Devil's Playground highlights a completely-different aspect of Amish culture. The Amish force their children to drop out of school after the eighth grade (because they believe that education causes pride). When Amish youth turn 16, their families turn them out into the broader world in a ritual called rumspringa; the youths often indulge in all sorts of previously-forbidden activities (drinking, drugs, sex, driving, dressing in contemporary clothing, etc.). While the youth party, they must make a life-altering decision - whether to return to the Amish faith and promise to remain loyal for the rest of their lives.

The best part of this movie is the human angle. The viewer watches as sheltered children experience the broader world. We see Amish youth who have all sorts of reactions to the sudden freedom. One woman returns to the church and accepts baptism. Another woman accepted baptism, then left the church anyway; this causes her entire family to shun her. One preacher's son becomes involved in drug dealing and cannot decide what to do with his life.  Viewers will care about these kids, each of whom faces the same life-defining choice.

There are just a few areas where one could improve Devil's Playground. I would like to have an update on the kids in this film; I am sure that most of the youth returned to the Amish church, but I would enjoy knowing the details. Also, I thought that too many scenes were shot in the dark, which made the movie, at times, difficult to see.

1809973,4,B00007GVM0,"Synopsis: The '02 documentary film `Devil's Playground' is a surprisingly revealing look behind the black hats, beards and bonnets of the Amish enigma as it focuses on five young adults during a transitional period called ""rumspringa""( meaning: running around). The Amish believe baptism is only valid when one is old enough to make a rational, mature decision on their own.

Between the ages of sixteen and early to mid-twenties (it varies with the individual) is a time of experimentation when Amish young people are allowed to see how the rest of the world lives. They smoke, drink, drive cars, date non-Amish, take drugs and party. It is nothing short of a modern day ""rites of passage"" when each must decide for themselves to make the decision to renounce what the outside world has to offer and return to the community of believers, or leave behind everything they have known to embrace a new life.

The five who must decide their future are; Faron and his girlfriend Emma, Gerald, Velda and Joann. The camera follows them about on their daily activities as they reflect on the life in their community and the allure of the new world they have been recently thrust into. Who will return to and who will leave is the question that will keep you watching to the end.

Critique: The first thing I'd like to do is offer my congratulations to the producers of this film. How they ever attained to permission and Amish cooperation to make this documentary was quite an accomplishment. I consider myself an individual well versed in the field of religions but must admit to knowing almost nothing about the social and communal practices of this faith before watching this film. It was a real eye-opener. For some reason I never considered the possibility of an interim period like ""rumspringa"" to exist. I just assumed that youth just flowed into adolescence, then into adulthood without any special upheaval or chaos in-between. Yes some would leave the community occasionally but I would have never expected such a turbulent, chaotic time of experimentation and decision making. Little did I know.

`Devil's Playground' is definitely an informative and fascinating glimpse into the beliefs, life, and practices of the Amish. For that reason alone it is worth watching. If I were to point out any negatives in the production I would say 1- it's a little slow at times and easy to loose focus and 2- in my opinion they spent too much camera time on the drug dealing, crank addict Faron. I would have liked to see more of the others, especially the more articulate and introspective Velda.",1225411200,,2587,4.846153846153846
1809974,3,B00007GVM0,"I suppose that I have a somewhat overidealized appreciation for the Amish, and when I first heard about this documentary I figured it was just a sensationalistic attempt at exploitation. I had no intention of watching it, but a few years later after reading Rumspringa, I finally decided to see what it was all about. I'll admit, the first time it really shocked me, and I considered it to be just what I had expected it to be. I watched it again several times, my feelings about it unchanged; after shelving it for about six months, I've watched it again a number of times, and my attitude towards it has change a little. I no longer consider it to be ""exploitation"" as it does try to depict the Amish in a somewhat sympathetic manner, and in some respects the true underlying goodness of the Amish people filters through despite the movie's subject matter. Having listened to the commentary--which is essential if you really want to understand the documentary itself--it does strike me, though, that the movie has to be viewed with a critical eye. While the type of behaviour depicted is clearly something that does occur among modern Amish youth, what's not clear is how widespread it is. According to the director, it took quite some time to find the people featured in the movie; no one wanted to be involved in the project at first, and so eventually it was mostly only people who were pretty fargone that did because they didn't really care anymore what people thought. So we have Faron--drug addict and dealer--as ""the main character,"" and Velda, who left the church because it wouldn't allow her to be ""the girl I want to be"" and is now is shunned by her family, figuring prominently, as well. The former extremely rare, the latter with an axe to grind. Some of the lesser ""characters"" are not as extreme, and a few even decided to join the church in the end, but it's difficult to say for sure because they don't received the same attention. Moreover, in the commentary, it's easy to tell where the director's etc. sympathies lie--praise for Velda for writing and publishing a ""feminist poem,"" critical remarks about certain Amish practices, the director's naive claim that maybe Faron would be a meth addict if he could just continue his education--not to mention the general tone of the discussion. Another thing to keep in mind: the documentary is very brief and general when it comes to Amish culture and history; it does not differentiate between the various sects, for instance. Of lesser significance, the inclusion of home movie clips does not make it clear that these people are not related to anyone in the movie, nor are they in fact even Amish. I understand why they were included, but it seems a little deceptive to me; well, I think they could have been left out altogether, or included as extras. So in the end, I'm left with mixed feelings about the movie; it was certainly fascinating and revealing, but there is an underlying agenda and it is does not fully explore the nature of Amish culture by which the viewer can measure the behaviour depicted in it. Is this kind of behaviour really the product of being released from a strict religious culture, or is it something that these children would have engaged in anyway had they not been born Amish and thus an example of why the Amish are justified in their rigid worldview? Many will conclude from this documentary that it is the former, while I tend to think the latter is correct. In the end, I would recommend the movie, but caution that it should be viewed critically.",1200182400,8,3552,4.693910256410256
1809975,3,B00007GVM0,"OK, I got the funnies out of my system with the review's title and now I'll deal with it seriously and see if I can relate the good and not-so-good aspects of this documentary.  I'll likely not write anything that hasn't been written yet, but I'll try to do it succintly.

First the good points.

First, great idea for a documentary!  Who doesn't find the Amish mysterious?  What do we, who don't live near Amish communities, know about them other than maybe we saw the movie ""Witness"" many years ago, or we went furniture shopping and saw their craftsmanship on display.  Well, this film takes you up close and personal and really gives you the feeling that you're living with them for a while.  I tried to imagine what I would be like if I grew up Amish and had to make a choice between the benefits of community (and perhaps the salvation of my soul) and the benefits of living my life without all the rules that Amish must obey.  What would I do?

Second, great idea to focus in on the one aspect of Amish culture that nobody would ever guess, and that's that they let their kids run wild during their teenage years, starting at age sixteen, just to see what the world is like before deciding whether or not to join the Amish church.

Actually, I knew a little bit about this becuase I saw another documentary that was done years ago, and it showed Amish teenagers driving cars, a practice which they must cease and desist after joining the church, but this documentary takes it ""up to eleven"" by showing just how far the teens are allowed to stray, apparently without parental intervention.

Third, I got to see that the Amish really don't reject modern technology, just the technology that destroys community.  In fact, it seems that so much of being Amish is about preserving community, and that the rejection of technology is more of a byproduct than an end in itself.  One of the bonus features was a video tour of the main subjects family home, and I saw a rather state-of-the-art furnace in the basement.  Natural gas I assume.

Fourth, I just had to wonder whether the Amish really are that backward, or are they geniuses, or perhaps both.  They've pre-empted any generation gaps by simply letting their teens run wild and giving them no parental authority to rebel against.  By the time they're eighteen, many of them volunteer to be grownups and take on adult responsiblity.  What a feat!

Now for the not-so-good.

I really wish something like this had been done by the people who do the PBS ""frontline"" series.  That would have made an intriguing idea into a genuinly compelling documentary, but instead there were seemingly endless minutes of one particulary messed up kid blabbering on and on and on and on.  I think it may have been a mistake, and the downfall of this project, to concentrate on one young person, and one of the most troubled at that.  Seeing footage of other teens and parents was the relief and what kept me going through the whole thing.

Second, it just plain needed more Amish teens and tighter editing.  It was tedious to watch a lot of this, and there was more than enough subject matter to keep this from happening.  More views from the parental side might have helped, for example.

So the bottom line is that I'm glad I watched it, but I'll never likely want to watch it again.  One trip to the ""Devil's Playground"" is enough for me.",1194825600,2,3379,4.558872305140961
1809976,5,B00007GVM0,"A great way to spend a rainy afternoon! I love the Amish...reading about them, watching them and visiting them. This is a great quality video for a fair price and the delivery is super fast too!",1189900800,,194,4.416666666666667
1809977,5,B00007GVM0,"This documentary explores the Amish ritual of Rumspringa. This is when Amish youth reach age 16 and are allowed to enter the ""English world"" and to experience all it's temptations such as drinking, drugs and sex.

The doc focuses on Faron, an Amish teen who's Rumpspringa experience has led him to become a meth addict who also deals drugs to pay for his habit. He gets busted but avoids jail time by turning evidence on some other local dealers. Obviously, this puts him in physical danger and he heads for the safety of life back home. Faron eventually leaves again to follow a girlfriend who has moved to Florida. There he succeeds in staying clean but faces setbacks in his attempts to ""make it"" in the outside world.

Velda is another teen that the doc features. She is an intelligent, independent young woman who has suffered from depression while growing up Amish. She comes across as a determined and inspirational figure who succeeds in getting into a college in Texas, a terrific accomplishment since Amish are not allowed to attend school beyond the 8th grade.

Nearly all the kids seem to be good hearted and I really found myself pulling for them. But I also ended up with some very mixed feelings about the adult Amish community. Of course, it's easy to feel a sort of romantic nostalgia for the simple country life they live, far away from the materialistic and competitive excesses of the modern world. But I do have a serious problem with the fact that they discontinue education at the 8th grade. This obviously leaves young minds underdeveloped and puts the kids at a severe disadvantage when it comes to suceeding in the outside world. Also the Amish are a very strict fundamentalist religious sect who teach their young people that they must remain Amish to enter Heaven. If they do choose to live in the ""English world"" they are dooming themselves to eternity in Hell. This sort of judgemental and punishment based religious theology I find extremely disturbing.

But the documentary itself is both tremendously educational and entertaining. Highly recommended!",1189814400,,2083,4.875706214689266
1809978,4,B00007GVM0,"""Devil's Playground"" is about the rumspringa, a period in the life of Amish youth from 16 that lasts for months or years, when that youth can live as the ""english"" and experience life outside of the Amish culture.  This documentary does a good job showing this surprising aspect of Amish life.  ""Devil's Playground"" does not glamorize the life of the Amish, nor does it tear that life down; it simply tries to show it as it is.  And you learn a few things - for example, I hadn't known that Amish kids have to leave school after 8th grade.

However, the narrative of the movie breaks down at times.  It wasn't until I saw the deleted scenes that I realized that one of the teenage girls we saw in several of the clips was Velda, who we meet at 23.  And the movie relies a bit too much on Faron.  Yes, the idea of an Amish meth dealer is sensational, and a hook with which to market the movie, but in many ways Velda was far more the rebel and the individualist.  (For a textbook example of the way speed messes people up, compare clean Faron with meth-addled Faron.)

The rumspringa perhaps explains why Amish culture has survived for so long.  Young people are not forced into the religion, but rather must choose it for themselves.  You have to fully buy in to the church in order to join; you don't simply drift into it.  So, not only are rebels given a chance to escape, if you will, during rumspringa, those that remain have affirmatively chosen to be there.

Unless you are really, really interested in the Amish, a religious studies professor, or otherwise deeply engaged with the Amish culture and community, this is more of a rent than a buy.  But it's at least worth a rent.",1181520000,,1684,4.425324675324675

This documentary surely throws some light on this radical decision-making time by focusing on different profiles, however I find that some scenes are rather long and repetitive. Besides, given the poor quality of the sound at times and the strong American accent, I think that English subtitles might help my French pupils...",1173398400,2,546,5.010989010989011
1809980,4,B00007GVM0,"I had no idea what these kids went through in growing up. This is an anthropological documentary that looks at the Amish culture and lifestyle. While many religious groups endorse some sort of ""age of accountability"" doctrine, the Amish have a specific age (16) that seems to be a high estimate for when human beings begin to consciously sin. Rumspringa is when an Amish adolescent at sixteen goes to experience the ""English"" world and, consequently, becomes lost. A part of the rumspringa experience is enjoying the luxuries of technology, but just as important to the adolescents, is enjoying the freedom of copulation and consumption of alcohol and drugs. Beyond the theological motifs, the movie raises a great many of ethical questions. For instance, if many of the Amish adolescents will not choose to join the Amish church, and thus be destined to heal, is it morally justifiable to release them out into the world? It seems that the sixteen-year-old Amish kids would benefit from being thoroughly proselytized and catechized at this age, rather than sent into an English world replete with distractions. A less ""religious"" but equally troubling ethical question consists in the moral culpability of the Amish parents for the condition of their children. One of the movie's subjects becomes addicted to drugs and begins to sell narcotics. If the Amish did not continue this tradition, these adolescents would not be pushed into such dangerous situations. As shocking as it was to see an American subculture so detached from the larger culture, it is even more shocking to see the film's final fact: the Old Order Amish church has a greater retention rate now than it did throughout much of the twentieth century. In conclusion, this movie can generate great intellectual discussions and should be seen by anyone who is interested in religious studies.",1169251200,,1858,5.0950819672131145

 These churches are similar to the Amish in dress, rural lifestyle, limits on formal education, and no tv or movies, but allow electricity, telephones, and cars. Some members are peple who left the old order Amish for a less restrictive church.

The experimentation with drugs, alcohol and sex depicted in this documentary is more likely to happen in larger Amish settlements. Amish youth have money because they are often employed. Some people move away from larger settlements and towns to keep their teens away from such temptations. FOr many youth, rumspringa consists  only of  hymn sing parties, dinner parties at home and  playing team sports.

I am African American and while some pleople were very prejudiced against me ,many others were glad to meet someone different and wanted to share  their faith, their homes, and  their lifestyle with me.

1809984,4,B00007GVM0,"Sex, drugs, heavy metal/rap music, Nintendo. These are not things one would normally associate with the Amish, but there you go, it's time to learn about DEVIL'S PLAYGROUND

Most of us probably view the Amish as isolationists and backward thinkers. They don't use electricity or modern conveniences. They travel by horse and carriage. They dedicate themselves to their church and community for life or are banished if they give up the church and head out into the ""English"" world. This is mostly true, except for one period in an Amish person's life.

At age 16, all children of Amish parents are given the option of Rumspringa (Pennsylvania Dutch for ""running around""). Rumspringa can last minutes, hours, days, weeks, or even years, depending on the individual. During this time they are allowed to do whatever they like, which includes drinking, sexual relations, smoking, driving (cars), and doing illicit drugs.

One such person is Faron, an 18-year-old son of an Amish minister. He's been out of his parents' house for almost two years and gets involved with crystal meth dealers in order to support his own drug habit. His life spirals out of control, but his parents are helpless to do anything about it because of the Rumspringa tradition. Faron has to choose his own path. But with peer pressures so high, the decision is not an easy one for kids who want to explore a world beyond the Amish communities they grew up in. You can't help but cringe with fear as Faron drops in and out of the drug culture, nearly gets himself killed in a car accident, and eventually finds love and a decent job many miles away from his parents.

Other kids have similar issues, but battle more with internal conflicts than external pleasures and material things. One is Velda, a pretty Amish girl who left her community and found depression nesting within her. Trying to discover who she was without the help of her family and her church leads her down some dark paths but she eventually succeeds in life by finding a job and going to college; quite a surprise considering the Amish don't educate their young beyond the 8th grade level.

This documentary certainly was an eye-opener. Who would've thought that the Amish deal with similar problems that non-Amish parents are forced to deal with? The information gathered by the film makers is impressive but limited, as the Amish become reclusive once they join the church. But the kids have no such qualms about being filmed since they have yet to take their oath.

I am disturbed mostly by the fact that the Amish don't educate their young beyond a certain grade level because they feel it causes too much ""pride"" (one of the seven deadly sins). But this also creates an interesting paradox. If you don't educate your kids, they are destined for menial jobs. The upside (I guess) is that this makes it difficult to support themselves if they decide to try and make a go at living in the outside world. Not surprisingly, the return rate from Rumspringa back to the church is 90 percent.",1156032000,3,3028,4.780114722753346
1809985,4,B00007GVM0,"""The Devil's Playground"" is what the Amish refer to the modern world as. When an amish teenager turns 16, he or she is allowed to leave the community and join the modern world. It's called rumspringa. After this period, which could take months or years, the teenager is allowed the choice to either join the Amish church or join the modern world.

The reasons for this tradition stem from the core beliefs that began the Amish church. The Amish church began because of the belief that babies should not be baptized, and only a person of accountable age can make the conscious choice to become a Christian. In the same spirit of free will, Amish teenagers are encouraged to enter the real world for a time in order to know what they're giving up.

But Amish teenagers don't really get into it, right? They don't even know how, having been brought up under the strictest rules their entire life. Definitely not so. The documentary shows Amish parties, and they are just as wild as anything OSU can produce. It is a little stupifying to watch a group of 17-year old girls wearing bonnets and snorting crystal meth (Boys typically wear ""english"" clothes during rumpsringa. Girls do not). There is literally an Amish word for a teenage boy and girl sharing a bed. This is all sanctioned and permitted by the Amish elders, although they obviously stay far away from it while it is taking place.

The film features three main people: A young man with a crystal meth addiction trying to decide whether to join the church (But ultimately doesn't), a young girl who happily goes back to the church, and a girl who joined the church only to leave again (Which is anathema to the Amish).

The young man, Faron, describes the process of rumspringa as a ""vaccination"". ""You get a small dose of the real world and that prepares you for defending against it. Then you can go back to the church happier because you made the choice."" And most do make that choice.

 According to the film, 90% of the teenagers go back to the church, which is its highest retention rate since its founding. But what Faron discovers, and what you will while watching this film, is that those in rumspringa often don't really experience what the world has to offer. They live in small houses in groups of other Amish and get to experience all kinds of drugs, sex, electronics, and music. But what some of them never learn is that's not all the world has to offer. The girl who joined only to leave again is delighted to enter college, something she never imagined for herself. Most Amish teenagers leave rumspringa with no more of a concept of how big the world really is.

This film is also a fascinating insight into the Amish in general. It was a difficult film to make, since most Amish do not allow themselves to be photograped. One of the stereotypes that is rapidly dismissed is that the Amish shun technology simply because it is technology. Most Amish carry cell phones (!). As an Amish elder put it, ""The question is whether this particular invention will promote family and community, or whether it will tear it apart.""

Though clearly a documentary, The Devil's Playground is also a narrative in its own right in the way it allows you to get to know the real people of the Amish community in a way you otherwise never could. As someone who grew up in a Mennonite community myself, it was a huge eye opener for me, and one of the most educational 90 minutes I've ever spent.",1129852800,10,3447,4.575364667747164
1809986,4,B00007GVM0,"Watching this movie is a very bizarre experience.  Having attended high school in the countryside, close to large clusters of Amish farms, I had heard stories from my friends at school about rumspringing Amish teenagers.  I dismissed most of them as rumor.  This movie confirmed that those wild stories I heard were probably true.  A very intruiging look at the flipside of a lifestyle most Americans cannot even begin to comprehend.  Worth a rental at the very least.",1127001600,4,468,4.948717948717949
1809987,4,B00007GVM0,"I enjoyed watching the documentary tremendously. If you always wanted to know what the feelings and attitudes of young Amish are concerning their religious tradition and restrictions  this is a very good chance for `English`people like us to glimpse into their Amish world. It is very interesting how they deal to balance religious tradition and modern society.

What I really enjoyed was watching the movie a second time but this time commented by the movie maker. That way you realize how hard it must have been to get Amish people on camera and even talk about their life, feelings and fears.

Still if you already know a lot about Amish and their life especially about the period of 'rumspringa' in which teenagers are able to experience the English world before they decide whether or not to join the Amish church, this documentary does not give you deeper information.

But still it is the best you can find about Young Amish and their controverse life.",1124668800,4,959,4.829268292682927
1809988,4,B00007GVM0,"What an interesting film!  Before watching this film, I had imagined that the Amish lived in their own perfectly formed bubble, isolated from the rest of the world.  While I'd never want to live like them, I had a certain amount of respect for their premodern way of life.

After this film, I see the Amish in a whole new light-- as real people, with more than a touch of white trash, afflicted by the same concerns of most deeply religious folk in the Bible Belt.  Sure, their religion and way of life are more extreme, but the kids set loose at age 16 for their ""rumspringa"" are like kids everywhere-- maybe just a bit more lost at sea as a result of their strict upbringing.  When Faron struggles with meth addiction during his rumspringa, I came to appreciate the importance, and maybe necessity, of deep religiosity in some people's lives.  The amazing fact is that over 90% of these rumspringa kids return to the flock when their time is up!  Even so, the antiquated Amish religion and its aged, bearded wise men seem so quaint, so antiquated compared to the temptations of the Devil's Playground of the ""English"" (i.e., us).

Watching this film is a learning experience-- the documentary is up there with ""Dark Days.""",1123113600,5,1224,4.6342592592592595

1809990,3,B00007GVM0,"This is an interesting film about the lives of Amish teenagers. After the film I was left thinking that the Amish church has some pretty bizarre beliefs and practices-

That they can be so strict and segregated from modern society, yet all of a sudden once the kids are teenagers they can engage & dabble in ""sinful"" behaviors, such as drugs, and pre-marital sex.

Either the kids get confused and overwhelmed by American materialism and decide to join the church, or completely abandon their faith and join the rest of modern civilization. However, in my personal opinion, the belief in

""Rumspringa"" is a dangerous, and manipulative tactic by the church. Overall, its definitely worth seeing.",1093910400,,694,5.017391304347826

It's intersting becaouse you realize that where not so differn't from each other really.

1809992,5,B00007GVM0,"Anyone still sharing the common stereotypical image of the Amish culture should watch this film. ""Devil's Playground"" is a fascinating, sometimes shocking and sometimes deep view into the clash of one form of life with another. The main theme is the practice of ""Rumspringa,"" the period when Amish teens turn 16 and are allowed to venture into the outside world and taste exactly what the vices of secular culture are. In unrestrained detail we hear and watch as these teens, kept in such a closely structured community, experiment with drugs, alcohol and sometimes just simple freedom. Anyone who thinks Amish people are not in tune with the times should see the clip of the young Amish girl talking about how much she enjoyed Ozzfest '99 and watching Godsmack peform. Yet this isn't a documentary version of ""Kids"" with endless shots of sex and debauchery, it is a powerful exploration of themes as universal as the importance of personal faith in what you believe in and when it is confronted by something that deviates from that particular form of thinking. In a way ""Devil's Playground"" speaks to all of us with the idea of finding yourself, beginning to think for yourself and make your own decisions about what route your life will take. There are heartbreaking moments when some of the confused characters here almost lose their way in a haze of pot and sadness. In a way the film may even be a commentary on the results of a community so cut off from the outside world that when someone ventures out they have no idea as to how to deal with dangerous vices. Director Lucy Walker here has made a documentary that grips soley with it's material, without the aid of fancy editing or even a great score (the music is really just simple techno touches added for mood) she brings out the feelings and doubts in these people's lives. The fact that these are real people makes the film even more riveting, especially when we see the wheels turning in these 16 year olds' minds as they literally ponder whether they will indeed go to Hell or not. ""Devil's Playground"" is full of emotion and daring investigative work, giving us a glimpse of a world we seldom are allowed into. An important document and intriguing, highly engaging social commentary.",1092528000,6,2249,4.754475703324808
1809993,4,B00007GVM0,"I watched this DVD twice, being especially taken with the heartbreaking story of the main narrator, Faron, a minister's son, struggling with the destination of his soul. He has been taught that he will go to hell unless he lives and dies in the Amish church, but the pull of the world proves very seductive. Faron's buddy Gerald expresses the same nihilistic attitude--he's pretty sure he's going to hell, but that seems a long way off when beer, drugs & skater punk fashions are beckoning. Also memorable is Velda, a young woman who does the unthinkable by leaving the church after being baptized and breaking off a wedding. Disowned by her family & all her former community, she is successfully building a life for herself that includes a job & college. Her courage is remarkable. I was amazed to learn that these Amish young people, when dressed ""English"" are virtually indistinguishable from other American teens--how do they pick up the vernacular of the street with no access to TV, movies, popular music or other non-Amish kids? How do the boys obtain money for cars & driving lessons? Where do all the beer & cigarettes & drugs come from? They take to the activities that regular teens grow up doing like ducks to water, leading me to believe that the Amish are not as 'separate' as their elders would like to believe. The Amish boys portrayed in this film are leading a wild partying lifestyle that most of their 'English' peers can only dream of.

 This film will surprise, and shock you. Definitely worth viewing.",1091750400,3,1524,4.768939393939394
1809994,4,B00007GVM0,"Devil's Playground is a documentary on the Amish tradition of rumspringa, which is the time after  the age of 16 until embracement of the Amish religious beliefs.  The Amish believe that the decision to believe in the Christian faith can only be made by adults.  This decision can only be made after the age of 16, and during this time the Amish young adults are free to explore their faith.  During this exploration the teenagers are given complete freedom; including having modern trinkets, partying, drinking, doing drugs and living a life of their choice.  However, when they have made the decision to embrace the Amish faith they are embraced by the Amish community and if they join the church and later reject the Amish faith they are shunned.  In the end this film becomes a testimony showing Amish teenagers are very much like other teenagers, which offers an interesting cinematic experience.",1087430400,,901,4.933774834437086

1809996,4,B00007GVM0,"A short distance from Chicago in northern Indiana lays the Amish community that is the focus of this documentary. But although the Amish are in close proximity to a large modern city they have in fact nothing in common with the average Chicagoan. Unlike other Christian sects the Amish do not believe in baptism for infants, rather, individuals older than sixteen are able to pronounce their belief in God and life a proper Amish life until their death.
At the age of sixteen before deciding to be baptized and join the Church they engage in teenage activities that are common in their ""English"" counterparts: drinking, driving, smoking, etc. This tradition is named Rumspringa and it enables the youth to get a taste of the outside world before committing their future in an effort to ride themselves of various temptations.
Many of the scenes in this documentary are contrary to the common beliefs of the Amish. I admit that I was confronted by many of my own apparent misconceptions. In the short span of this film I was learned a great amount about the lifestyle and traditions of the Amish, especially the youth.
If you're interesting in other cultures then don't hesitate to watch this documentary. It raises many relevant issues that are worthy of consideration about the Amish and the wider population in general. Recommended.",1087084800,2,1334,4.933333333333334
1809997,4,B00007GVM0,"After watching this award winning documentary on the amish teens you won't think of them as so much diffrent than yourself or your kids anymore- they are just regular people who have problems just like the rest of us- if not more problems. The documentary revolves around the life of amish teens when they go through the period of Rumspringa , a time in thier life where they must decide whether to leave the amish family and life and live in the ((english)) world or to commit to a lifetime within the amish community. Most after experiencing the outside world come back to stay and have life in amish community but some decide to leave and want to live in outside world- to some being amish just isn't what they want for themselves , they don't picture themselves living that kind of life. Its hard decision for some and it shows the story of a group of amish teens and the experiences they go through during rumspringa, ( some of which might suprise you) it isn't typical of what you think the amish kids would do but they have many experiences then decide whether to leave thier familys and make life for themselves outside the amish religion and family or to remain in the community at the end of this period of finding themselves and experiencing both sides. The amish are very fascinating and im glad they have this documentary to give a bit more insight into the amish life. Highly recomended. 4 stars",1078876800,,1409,4.551181102362205
1809998,5,B00007GVM0,"I was Amish and I know some Old Order Amish people. I was a Swartzentruber Amish, a more strict Amish sect then the Old Order. In face the SA are a brake-off of the OOA years ago. I work for a house builder crew, owned by OOA brothers. I have discussed the movie with my boss, Allen, and he said that he knows that a lot of things happen in the OOA youth groups that should not.
The New Order Amish have hardly any such problem as the ones in the movie. The NOA are a more closly knit group then either the SA or OOA.
The SA on the other hand do not allow their teens to experince any of these things in this movie. When I was 10-14 I was sneeking out of the house to go to my ""Enlish"" brother's [now a Srg. in Iraq] house to watch TV.
But I personaly never had the beer parties that were in the movie, exept for about 2 weeks when my parents where away to sell our old house, 20-30 miles away!

I was surprised to see what kinds of trouble the kids get into while trying out the ""English"" way of living. This video will really make you question the Amish way of life. I though that the Amish religion was a sect of Christianity that followed the regular tenants of the religion. Now, I think its more of a cult that makes up extra-biblical rules for no apparent reason than one of the higher ranking men think its a good thing to do.
This movie really points out the need for a ""middle of the road"" lifestyle. It shows kids who rebel to the point where they have death threats, find that they like the sex, drugs, and alcohol better than the lifestyle they have been living their entire lives. This movie also points out the lures that the ""world"" can have on anyone. This movie also shows how the Amish have a good grasp on grace. They accept these kids back into their society after their decision making time regardless of what has happened to them in the past. This movie also shows how the Amish can reject their own when they decide that the Amish lifestyle is contrary to their own beliefs.
