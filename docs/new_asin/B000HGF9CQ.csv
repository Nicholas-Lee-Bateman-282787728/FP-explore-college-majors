8139692,5,B000HGF9CQ,"if you're a fan of Katherine Legge, you're gonna love this peak into her recent rise to racing excellence.  If you're not a fan, you SHOULD be!  and I think you will be after you watch this video.  it's of course available here on amazon and also on Katherine's personal web site.  buy it, enjoy it, and root for this driver to continue to succeed.  She got a much nicer personality than certain other current famous female drivers, she's actually an accomplished driver, she's actually won races, and she's succeeding on her talents.  See how hard it was to come up thru the ranks based on talent alone and help support her racing career into the future.

This video chronicles her racing exploits from childhood to the current day (2006) and even allows a quick glimpse of the most famous and talented artist and wrench on the PKV team ,the esteemed Norm Lessard.  It's well edited, complete, and while not flashy or on the level of something produced for Jessica Simpson or other rockstars, it keeps your attention and makes you appreciate what Katherine has gone thru to make it to North America's greatest race series--Champ Cars or whatever we are calling it this week (as long as we don't call it the IRL).

Don't hesitate to buy this video and enjoy it and send Katherine a note of your support (and Norm would want me to tell you to buy one of his most excellent drawings of Katherine while you visit her website--they really are great).",1170720000,,1446,4.595330739299611
