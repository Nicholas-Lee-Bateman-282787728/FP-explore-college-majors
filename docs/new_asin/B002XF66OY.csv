8383644,4,B002XF66OY,". . . this is a treat. Sure, there are cheesy elements but as we have long known about S&M entertainment beggars cannot afford to be choosers.

First, the main fault:
 THE MEN! Every erotic story ever told on film has been undermined by the male actors who are wooden, stiff, confused and ridiculous. The only major exception that I can think of is Mickey Rourke in 9.5 WEEKS. The men in THE STORY OF O: THE SERIES are average compared to the generally dreadful lot. They serve their purpose. After a half hour I was able to stop holding my breath for fear that one of them would say or do something that was so awful that I would have to turn off the television. By half watching I can generally avoid making eye contact with them. Were that I was the last man on earth but in lieu of that I suppose that we men must continue to do our best to get along. (Do not worry, amigos. I am no Mickey Rourke either.)

In contrast the women in this version are outstanding. Natural breasts and slender bodies are bared freely and casually. Their acting is better than merely competent.

The settings are elegant and appropriate to the story. Little if anything about the mise en scene looks cheap. The womens costumes are excellent and worn well. The S&M gear is sexy and convincing.

If you are generally receptive to S&M and enjoy the style of 1970s erotic cinema you will find plenty of interest in this production.

If you enjoy snickering at erotic people then seek your entertainment elsewhere.

If tearing down people who make themselves vulnerable to a camera lens is your thing then there is plenty of more appropriate material out there for you.

THE STORY OF O: THE SERIES is good enough to deserve not to be teased.

8383648,5,B002XF66OY,"I just purchased this series from this site. Obviously, since it is a Region 2 DVD, it doesn't work on American DVD players. However, it works perfectly well on the freeware VLC media player, so it's easy enough to watch on a computer monitor. Windows media center canalso be changed to display PAL discs. but you are limited to four switches between formats.
The quality of the disc is good. But, since this was filmed in the early 90s it is, of course, not HD.
As to the material itself: The book ""The  Story of O"" is a beautifully written sexual fantasy which is, at its heart, dark and sordid. The 1975 movie starring Corinne Clery was visually beautiful (As was Clery) but the very lushness of the scenery and the attractiveness of the actors, along with the shift in emphasis to make it a sort of love story all combined to turn the movie into general audience erotics, like ""Emmanuelle"" (by the same director.)
This series was produced in Brazil but apparently never shone there. I had seen episodes in German and Danish, but this set of disks is English dubbed with Danish subtitles.

O is played by Claudia Cepeda, who is attractive but not a stunning beauty like Clery. Likewise, the women at Roissy are not outstandingly beautiful. The Brazilian Roissy is downscale compared to the French chateau. It doesn't even have running water.
The series doesn't shrink from the more shocking and unpleasant features of the book. It does its best to show the characters as they are in the book. The series does a much better job than the movie in depicting Rene, who in the movie is a goffy nebbish. O's feelings are communicated by Cepeda's facial expressions and, unlike the movie, by narration which mostly consists of passages from the book.

""The Story of O"" has become something of a literary classic and the subject of much controversy. It has also become a launch point for artists and film makers to add their spin to classic erotica.
This series does an excellent job of capturing the eloquence of the book, as well as accurately depicting cruelty and exploitation. The characters are, objectively, mentally ill. The series captures that quality much better than the 1975 movie and, I think, better than the book - which is presented entirely from O's POV.

""Story of O - The Complete Series"" is a little hard to find, especially in English. But, IMHO, it's worth the effort.",1433635200,6,2386,4.7009569377990434
