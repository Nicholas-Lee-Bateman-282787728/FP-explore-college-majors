8633988,2,B00HNZU99W,"I bought this in a $2 bin (previously-viewed DVD), did not know anything about it except that it was a horror film dealing with a sorority house. OK, so I wasn't expecting it to be great. But, it was disappointingly bad. Not the worst film ever made, but not worth watching. It is sort of a comedy, with over-the-top smarminess oozing from the sorority president and from Morgan Fairchilde (the owner of the sorority house, and the defacto sorority house mother). The killings go on and on, and there really is no reason for the killings -- until a reason is revealed toward the end. It's not a good reason, and it still doesn't make a lot of sense, but there is a reason. Why the private investigator continues to snoop all day and all night around the sorority house, looking for a missing girl, is beyond me. The whole thing just doesn't add up to a good story, but there are many fairly good special effects gruesome death scenes. The acting is bad-- but, I can only assume it is due to the campy, ridiculous dialog. As a TV movie, it's OK. Others have said that it was made for TV, and Itake their word for it. But as a theatrical release, it stinks.",1531526400,,1155,4.376744186046512
8633989,4,B00HNZU99W,"Released to TV in 2012 and directed by Darin Scott, ""American Horror House (aka Sorority Horror House or ""Paranormal Initiation"") chronicles events during Halloween at a haunted Southern sorority house. Morgan Fairchild plays the housemother. Alessandra Torresani & Salina Duplessis play initiates for the sorority. Dave Davis is on hand as the male protagonist while Gralen Bryant Banks appears as a private detective.

The low ratings for this movie are hilarious. What were these critics expecting with a Syfy horror flick about a sorority house? For what it is, it delivers the goods. Its got a compelling story, plenty of low-budget gore and a buffet of good-looking women. The pics generally serious, but with a sense of humor (e.g. the veteran sorority girls). Sure, its cartoony, but it was made-for-TV, after all, and it scores high marks on the female front.

The film runs 87 minutes and was shot in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The script was written by Anthony C. Ferrante.

8633991,4,B00HNZU99W,"Sorority Horror House is actually a Sy-Fy original movie that went by the name American Horror House when it aired on that channel. I don't know why the name changed for this DVD, but I like the title Sorority Horror House better. It sounds like those 80's slashers House on Sorority Row and Sorority House Massacre. This is a fun movie and entertaining, but it isn't great. It's not that scary, but there are some awesome death scenes and some good laughs. The head sorority girl cracked me up with her vampy dialogue and performance. Worth checking out if you're a fan of cheesy horror.",1396483200,7,588,4.609523809523809
8633992,3,B00HNZU99W,"This is a 2012 recycled made for TV film called ""American Horror House."" The film opens with a Lizzie Borden scene and then the house changes ownership to a sorority house that has no secrets from the viewer. New pledges are hazed as a party happens on Halloween night with the ghost slashers of the house. That's about it. Four girls in bras/panties. No sex, nudity or swearing. Relatively kid safe. One for the girls on a sleep over. Plenty of blood.",1395360000,8,452,4.524390243902439
