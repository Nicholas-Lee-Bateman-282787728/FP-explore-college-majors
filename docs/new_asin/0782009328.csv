179835,5,0782009328,"...I hesitated for a couple of months to get this video, even considering myself a huge Bonanza fan. The reason for my reluctancy was simply that I had already owned many other episodes on that show and didn't want to take the risk of getting doubles. If you realized, Amazon.com doesn't name the episode, but it's a real Bonanza. If you had the same problem, I think it's over now for I took the chances for you and bought the tape. The episode name is ""Blood on the Land"". That episode was first seen on February 13, 1960. Sheep and Cows are not supposed to live together on that story. Because of that, Everett Sloane, who is the guest star and plays the role of a sheepherder, kidnaps Adam Cartwright. The ""small"" Ponderosa is the price for him not to kill Pernell Roberts, our ""Adam boy"", also known as 'The Dark Cartwright'. It's really worth seeing and owning that tape. Mature the idea if you are a Bonanza fan like me. I'm sure you won't regret watching it. Have fun!",983491200,33,976,4.427777777777778

179840,5,0782009328,"I bought this for my daughter's birthday one year as it was one of my children's favorite Bonanza episodes. Walter is a dog and no matter what happens, Walter just lays there and takes it in stride. Arthur Hunnicut is great as Walter's owner who can read Walter's different moods even though to us Walter looks exactly the same no matter what the situation. This is one of the few Bonanzas that tries for humor and actually accomplishes it without looking stupid. When we bought a dog for our children, they promptly named it Walter.",1383696000,,533,4.621052631578947

Movie Description
Two excellent episodes of the popular television series BONANAZA are paired on this set. In ""The Last Viking,"" the Cartwright family squares off against an outlaw clan passing through the Ponderosa. In ""Breed of Violence,"" Little Joe aids the sheriff's daughter when she gets involved with a robber.",1193875200,,410,5.276923076923077

179849,5,0782009328,"Sitting watching these episodes of Bonanza took me back in time, to when westerns were the best thing on television.  I will keep on purchasing as many westerns as I can.  My collection is growing.  Lorne Green was one of my favourite male actors.",1162771200,,247,4.568181818181818
179850,5,0782009328,"Walter (the dog) was real!
Walter wandered into the mining camps surrounding Virginia City, Carson City, and Catgutt Gulch some time in the mid-1870's or 80's.
Walter went from camp to camp appearing to beg, mooching a bite to eat, while he was really searching for the killer of his previous owner.
Few suspected Walter of starting the avalanche which buried the culprit.  Those who knew the truth were grateful to Walter for dispensing with the varmit, and Walter was never without a home ever after.

The ""Walter"" you see in this episode of Bonanza is very much like the Walter who actually lived back in the West in the late 19th century: He is friendly, astute, sensitive, vigilant, and vindictive.

There is a pen and ink drawing which still survives somewhere of the ""real"" Walter, but it should be mentioned that Walter was never happy with the likeness--he said it made him look too mean.",1094601600,3,897,4.737179487179487
179851,5,0782009328,"On these DVDs are 8 very entertaining episodes (on two double-sided discs) from the first two seasons of Bonanza, they are:
1. Escape To The Ponderosa.
2. The Ape
3. The Bloodline
4. Death At Dawn
5. Blood On The Land
6. Badge Without Honor
7. Day Of Reckoning
8. Desert Justice.
The visual quality of these 8 episodes is excellent, the audio quality is also very good.  More importantly, the original Bonanza theme is featured on these DVDs, which is important as some other companies releasing Bonanza on DVD (such as Platinum Disc and Madacy) feature a generic western theme.  The Ape features a young Leonard Nimoy in an early role 6 years before achieving fame as Spock in Star Trek, you can also catch a young Claude Akins in Desert Justice as a U.S. Marshall.
While watching these episodes it occurred to me that the late Lorne Greene seemed born to play Ben Cartwright, he is so good in that role, Michael Landon, Pernell Roberts, and Dan Blocker are also very good in roles that seemed to be tailor-made for them.
In short, if you're a true Bonanza fan, you can't go wrong with this DVD set!",1092873600,26,1100,4.522613065326633
179852,1,0782009328,"No Hoss.  Poor fellow died prior to this episode, so we don't get to see the big guy.  But that's not what makes this episode terrible.  If you want to see what really killed off this series, watch Landon (Little Joe) overacting in this reinterpretation of ""The Miracle Worker"".  Painful!  Poor Altman and Landon were just doing their jobs.  The blame goes to the scriptwriter and producer of this wasted effort.  IMPORTANT NOTE: The DVD does NOT use the original ""Bonanza"" title theme, which was probably too expensive for them to procure, but substitutes a nice little alternative country-music ditty. Should be banned from all reissue.  Not worth watching, even for Altman fans.  Thank goodness my two favorite Altman films have recently been made available on DVD: ""Three Women"" and ""Images""",1053475200,,795,5.00763358778626

Until she says she's in love with Joe. The Joe gets mad, but apologizes. They go back to normal later and then it has a surprising ending.

179856,5,0782009328,"Bonanza was the first series I watched on tv and it's great to see it back. This is a real good buy: eight episodes of good image and sound quality. The stories are a bit too simple for these times, but these episodes sling you right back forty years ago when you were a twelve year old kid. Great! Everything seemed clear and simple then. Hum. Curious but fun.",1028160000,7,361,4.246376811594203
179857,5,0782009328,"Fans of the Bonanza series should really ensure they watch this first programme. Unlike some later episodes, it features all four main characters and reveals tensions between the Cartwrights, as landowners, and other business interests in the locality. Dangers exist for the ranchers which seem to have evaporated at later stages in the series.
The story moves quickly and well. There is plenty of action, as befits the macho world of the cowboy. Ben Cartwright's hubris at owning such a large ranch seems amusing and dated now, as does his religious zeal. A generous portion of love interest is provided by Little Joe and Adam, which will appeal to their fans, whereas poor old Hoss has more mundane considerations on his mind.
Very interesting to compare with later episodes and to note how the characters and their situations develop.",1026259200,4,837,5.028776978417266

179862,5,0782009328,"Seeing the Julia Bulette Story episode of Bonanza was a real bonanza for me. Ms. Bulette was an actual woman who prospered in Virginia City and the plot line parallels her life and death (with certain creative liberties). I enjoyed researching the life of the real ""madame"" of this mining town. From this episode I also became famililar with Jane Greer, the actress who portrayed Ms. Bulette. In this episode, Ms. Greer, 35, was a strikingly beautiful woman. Subsequently, I studied her films, including one with Kirk Douglas and R. Mitchum, her bio (married to Rudy Vallee and was a savvy businesswoman) and actually got some autographed photos of her from eBay. Sadly, she died of cancer at 76, in late Aug, 2001.

179865,5,0782009328,"the audio and video are both excellent. but thats second to the actual story content. rose for lotta was the pilot for the series and shows ben as a bible quoting patriarch and almost too harsh a character to be likable. a far cry from the warm nurturing father figure he evolved into. the difference in the other characters is not quite as noticable. but its really interesting to compare all 4 of our heroes in this episode to the ben, adam hoss and joe of the early and mid sixtys. the scenery is specactular in both episodes and the stories both well written. the truckee strip quest stars a young james cobourn and is every bit as enjoyable as rose for lotta. watching these episodes a trip down memory lane even for non bonanza buffs.",988761600,3,740,4.448529411764706
