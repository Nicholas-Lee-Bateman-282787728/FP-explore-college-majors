7704863,5,B01D9EUNGY,"I absolutely LOVE this television show! It's extremely convoluted, dramatic, twistedly scripted, keeps you glued to your screen, and, well, pretty much anything that Viola Davis stars in is guaranteed to be a great watch :D If I had any complaints, its that this series isn't being released on BluRay media which I feel is much better viewing, but that doesn't apply to my love for this show :D",1463961600,3,394,4.72463768115942

7704893,4,B01D9EUNGY,"The only other TV show that I have ever loved enough to buy on disc is Downton Abbey.  I love this show enough that I wanted it to be a permanent part of my DVD collection (movies).  But I did want to leave feedback.  This was a pre-order deal, and Amazon did send it as soon as it was available and everything concerning the shipment, charges, arrival, etc. went as it should.  Very dependable.  My only complaint that didn't make it a perfect 5 stars is very minor.  The clear plastic that covers the DVD case itself and holds the paper cover in place is warped/wrinkled.....as if heat damaged it maybe??  But the discs are fine and all played perfectly. I don't feel like that is even a complaint as much as just feedback.",1469318400,2,725,4.365671641791045

7704903,3,B01D9EUNGY,"How to Get Away With Murder: The Complete Second Season contains all 15 episodes of the 2015-2016 season. Frank (Charlie Weber), Bonnie (Liza Weil), and the Keating Five take on challenging new cases while the shocking discovery of who killed Rebecca leads into the mystery of who shot Annalise (Viola Davis). This development sets the stage for a series of secrets, betrayals, and revelations that will prove that under the right circumstances, anyone can be a killer.

In the first episode, Its Time to Move On, Annalise and her students must move on with their lives, though the students are still shaken over Rebeccas disappearance. Only Annalise and Frank know that Rebecca was murdered and are determined to find out who killed her. Meanwhile, Annalise takes on a new client, a brother and sister who are accused of killing their parents. Also, an old friend turns up at Annalises door and teaches her a valuable lesson.

Other episodes deal with Annalise and team being hired by a client accused of driving someone to the point of suicide (I Want You to Die); Wes (Alfred Enoch) and the Keating Five dealing with fallout from the night Wes shot Annalise (What Happened to You, Annalise?); Annalise trying to keep her team from panicking and getting ahead of Philips threats as Wes and Laurel (Karla Souza) begin putting the pieces of Wes mothers death together (Something Bad Happened); and Annalise escaping from the mounting chaos surrounding her (Anna Mae).

Viola Davis is one of the best actresses working in television these days. With an impressive pedigree from feature films  Doubt, The Help, and the upcoming Suicide Squad  she portrays Annalise as strong, determined, secretive, and often arrogant. Her Annalise doesnt suffer fools and is often the smartest person in the room. Though the scripts are often over the top and highly improbable, Ms. Davis consistently first-rate performance anchors the show.

Bonus features on the 4-disc DVD release include deleted scenes and bloopers.",1466467200,3,2003,5.072948328267477

8755234,1,B01D9EUNGY,"Very dark and a low sense of morality in every character. Spoiler: Even the best succumbs in the second season. If they'd all do the right thing they would save themselves a lot of personal agony. But this is the way the writers want to go these days, even Disney. Poor Walt - it would be hell for him to see where some of his company productions are going. Viola Davis is excellent in this, but I would have liked to see her work with the student lawyers on cases without all the personal drama. You can't trust the Disney name any more. Our country needs hope, not this depressing stuff. I threw this away. I wouldn't pass this on to anybody else.
