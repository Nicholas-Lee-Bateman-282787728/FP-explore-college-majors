6968260,5,B00SB7T7L2,"After reading reviews from others, I thought I knew exactly what I would be receiving...and that proved to be correct. This retrospective video clocks in at just over 2 hours 20 minutes, and is a fairly thorough review of not only Lowell George's early career and his time with Little Feat but also his brief solo work.

As others have pointed out, the HUGE GLARING weakness and SERIOUS problem with this DVD is the lack of input from most of the major subjects/players/associates in George's life. While it is good to have input from producer George Massenberg, longtime Feat collaborators Neon Park and Martin Kibbee, where are the others? Many have bemoaned the lack of interviews with members of Little Feat, to me that's less of an issue than the many many others George knew and worked with. Conspicuously absent are such musicians and sidemen as Jackson Browne, Jorge Calderon, Linda Ronstadt, Bonnie Raitt, Valerie Carter or the late Robert Palmer, who is mentioned as giving Feat one of their first big breaks. How about his wife Elizabeth George...or his children, now grown?

It really feels like these principals are waiting, perhaps under contract for another George retrospective from a different producer. Maybe the monetary cost of their input was frankly too expensive to add their voices to this work, but after hearing about the affection his peers had for him that seems hard to believe, that they would not gladly lend their voices in praise (or even criticism) of him without cost.

Otherwise, it's definitely worth your time...but it could have been so much better.",1461888000,3,1588,4.962406015037594

6968265,4,B00SB7T7L2,"While I enjoyed this effort and have for some time desired to see some sort of film made explaining the life & times of Mr Lowell T George, my only real disappointment here is the lack of detail concerning LG's recorded output, which went well beyond Little Feat, and is already fairly common knowledge among his most devoted fans. A Complete Discography and a list of his published tunes, along with excerpts from those tunes, would have been immensely appropriate on a film like Feats First. Instead, the work they put in to this title comes off to me as sort of half-way there.",1447459200,,580,4.586538461538462

6968277,5,B00SB7T7L2,"A fantastic story of a great musician told against the sounds of Little Feat. Lowell George, like so many incredible musicians succumbed to the effects of success in the scene of the 60's and 70's. A great waste that leaves you wondering, ""What could have been?""",1434067200,,262,4.717391304347826
6968278,5,B00SB7T7L2,"Hello folks,

This is quite a remarkable & well deserved appraisal of a dearly missed musician / songwriter / producer & classic ""shooting star"", his life's achievements & sometimes short-comings, with offerings of what may have been his thoughts-through-life / career, as realized from many of his life-long-friends, associates, critics & artists alike. The film works remarkably well when one considers that there is no interview footage used from either his wife Elizabeth (or kindred), or from members of the legendary band Little Feat.

The many people that make up the cast here sincerely keep you involved through the film, & it's obvious that now over 30-years since his passing, he remains dearly missed by all who knew him. The insight gained into the times of California & Lowell's career at the turn of the 1960's & into the 1970's is well reflected here by all, & further insight into his real-life professional circumstances are well presented. This film also makes a great visual companion to the book ""Rock & Roll Doctor"" by Mark Brend. Inputs from legends like Van Dyke Parks, Martin Kibbee & George Massenberg make this film as credible as you can possibly get.

There are already a few good reviews printed here about this film, so I will not repeat what's already been said, short of saying that anyone who knows the band Little Feat, & the legend that surrounds it's mysterious founder, will be well enlightened ! And anyone who thought they knew all there was to know about Lowell through a life-long following of the band, well I'm sure you'll get something out-of-it too !

There are one or two contradictions of opinion that will surface from some of the interviewees, these mainly dealing with opinions of his solo album ""Thanks I'll Eat It Here"", &  the Little Feat release ""Down on the Farm"", all having to do with whether the band Little Feat was finished, or whether he was to continue onwards with his solo career, & that they appraised the albums as ""not the greatest achievements"" of his career. You'll find differing answers from anyone you ask about these matters that surrounded him at the time near his passing, & in truth, we'll never know what he was thinking. I'll gesture to say this however, & that's to say that the Little Feat album ""Down on the Farm"" featured more of his own original songwriting than his solo album did. And he sang more on this Little Feat album than many previous albums. That to me would indicate that perhaps Little feat were very much going to continue on as a band. They're still going strong to this day !!!

This is a good film people, we're lucky that we have this to watch & remember Lowell with !",1433894400,14,2670,4.706638115631692
6968279,3,B00SB7T7L2,"Too much opinion by people who reportedly knew him well.  Most of the video in this DVD is already available on You Tube.  The DVD was good at describing his approach to slide; there were a few things like that.  The history with Zappa was fascinating, as was his early skill with the flute.  At the end, I think the DVD ends up portraying him as another '70s burn-out who died because of drugs.  That is unfortunate, because I know Lowell George is so much more than that, and he is absolutely one of my favorite musicians ever.",1433462400,4,529,4.357142857142857

6968281,3,B00SB7T7L2,"I truly love Little Feat. One of the most under appreciated bands of all time. The fact they are not in the ""Rock n Roll"" Hall of Fame is an absurdity. As pointed out so often in the DVD, Lowell George's brilliance is self evident.( or even better listen to his lyrics, licks and vocals on any Feat ALBUM) Anyway, the DVD is inherently flawed. There is not a single interview or comment from a single member of Little Feat. Instead of speculation about the inter-workings of the band, the dynamics, the brilliant live shows and their ultimate demise- Interview the Band! (Very disappointing.) Otherwise,a thorough job on Lowell's early and Zappa years.",1432857600,16,652,4.778761061946903

6968284,5,B00SB7T7L2,"This is a fairly in depth film covering Lowell George's life and the creation of Little Feat
along with the difficulties that they encountered by not fitting into the record industry's pigeon hole
approach to artist support and development. None of the remaining members of Little Feat
are interviewed  for this film, which is alright I guess. I heard an interview in the 1990's on the radio
with Bill Payne and Paul Barrere and they spent a lot of time downplaying Lowell's importance in
the band which I found very odd. Lowell George was a great songwriter and musician. I was lucky enough
too see Little Feat at a late show at the Beacon Theater in 1978 and the show was just one of the best.
Lowell was a big junkie and he was twice the size he should have been & he was dead a year, or so later,
 As sad as a story that is, his music still sounds great 40 years on and any fan of Little Feat will
find this documentary interesting and worthwhile.
The only minus is the British dude who is interviewed - that gets a bit tiresome ...",1431388800,18,1036,4.3076923076923075

8697950,2,B00SB7T7L2,"First, my background: I lived Washington DC area for several years and listened almost exclusively to WHFS radio.  That station, and especially DJ Cerf (heard on the opening of ""Waiting for Columbus""), introduced me to the band, their sound and ideas.  I also helped out on their road crew for a show or two..jumped on board and got to talk to Bill Payne (fellow Texan and a great guy) quite a bit along with the rest of the band including Lowell.  As you can imagine, he was 'the man' everyone wanted to be around, talk to...looking back, what a beating it must have been.

I gave the movie two stars for several reasons.

First, the film spends a ridiculous amount of time showing clips of other artists like Howlin' Wolf and Frank Zappa. Don't get me wrong...I appreciated the footage, but, I thought the movie is about Lowell George, not Howlin' Wolf or Zappa.  And if I'm watching a film about Lowell George, why did we see so many scenes of Zappa writing, playing, etc.?  Or interviews with people who are talking about Zappa's brilliance, his house in Laurel Canyon for an extended period of time?

Second, how about interviewing members of Little Feat?  Elizabeth George?  I don't know if they refused to be in the movie or the filmmaker couldn't be bothered, but, I would rather have heard their insights over interviewees like Barney Hoskyns, etc.  Nothing against them, but, their role in Little Feat?  None.  Or the interviews with the Zappa fans but none with the Feat?  Payne, Richie Hayward, etc., were the guys making the music on their albums, on the road with Lowell.  Not some of these folks.

Third, why wasn't there more of an effort to get more clips from films, appearances, etc., that aren't already commercially available or on YouTube?  Especially interviews with Lowell, for example.  Those were the only films, interviews, photos they could find?

Fourth...Lowell George the producer is briefly covered.  A quick mention of Robert Palmer's album and the Meters?  How about the briliant work on Valerie Carter's first album?  Jackson Browne's The Pretender?  Yes, credit to his influence (long overdue) with people like Bonnie Raitt, Linda Rondstat, etc.  When I saw Raitt in the 90s, all I could think was Lowell...from her slide to vocal styling...Lowell George.  But again, would loved to have seen more on this vs. the extended interviews with critics or Frank Zappa pictures.

This video isn't likely to attract new fans and long time fans may find a few new items buried here and there.  But overall, a huge letdown and I'm glad I sawa this on Prime vs. paying for the DVD as I would have been very disappointed.",1505347200,4,2645,4.7687224669603525
