519451,5,6302760062,"This film about Diane de Poitiers, who was the French mistress of King Henri II, was originally planned for Garbo in the 1930's. It was finally made with the gorgeous Lana Turner in 1956. As only MGM could make them, it is lavish and spectacular with some of the most exquisite costumes ever seen on the screen. No expense has been spared. This was Lana's last film under her MGM contract. Marisa Pavan is excellent as Catherine de Medici. A must for Lana fans.",1372896000,5,461,4.5
519452,5,6302760062,"Before beginning a review of this movie, I must give plaudits to reviewer Sam A. Juliano III for his recognition of Miklos Rozsa's beautiful score. From the main theme, which is Diane's, to the various supporting themes that, for example, underscore the wizard-like presence of Sir Cedric Hardwicke, the machinations of Henry Daniell, and the emotional state of Marisa Pavan as Catherine de Medici, this film is an aural as well as visual feast. Both the movie and score were highly underrated at the time. This was Hollywood, NOT precise history - but was close enough.

Lana Turner as Diane displays both intellect and beauty. She captures the fancy of the King of France who appoints her tutor to his youthful second son played by Roger Moore in his first screen appearance. After awhile, they become lovers - a poorly kept secret. But Moore must marry, and so he is betrothed to a very young and innocent Catherine de Medici whose family has secret plans for her future. Catherine consults a Nostradamus type seer in the form of Hardwicke who predicts a trio of sons in her future. More ominous is the vision of a young boy who accompanies Hardwicke; he sees a fatal tragedy in the future that involves ""a cage of gold and a wild boar"". After Catherine leaves H, he tells his companions that her husband who will become king is destined to be killed by his best friend.  Shortly afterward, Moore and his bf go wild boar hunting. The forest of birch trees in which the boar is to be hunted takes on the appearance of ""a cage of gold"" in the eyes of Moore's friend. As the hunt continues, Moore is surprised by the boar and is gored but does not die.  The prophecy is apparently averted. Moore recovers and his affair with Diane continues unabated. Her power at court continues to grow and even exceeds that of Catherine's who becomes queen when Moore's older brother dies suddenly from foul play and Moore becomes king. Catherine is suspect but eventually cleared.  A momentary fainting spell during the investigation reveals that she is with child. The Medicis are impatient for Catherine to gain her full power. Their intention is to control France from Italy. However, they dare not kill Diane since that would bring the wrath of the king down on all.  Word comes from Italy: ""If you cannot rid yourself of the bird, cut down the tree in which it nests.""

Plotting on the part of Daniell now moves into high gear. An upcoming mock jousting tournament is rigged. Without giving too much away, suffice it to say that, for the occasion, Moore is dressed completely in golden armor. His helmet has a visor composed of vertical strips that look like ""a cage of gold"". His Italian opponent has a ""wild boar"" displayed on his shield. Yet, the Italian is defeated. But, in a final showdown insisted upon by Moore between his bf and himself (the only two left), the friend is forced to borrow the Italian's shield since his own was too badly damaged. Throw in one lance with a deliberately designed breakable cover and...

A final attempt to avert the predicted calamity on the part of the young boy who predicted it all after suddenly arriving with Hardwicke to observe the festivities is ""too late"".  What must be will be. (Note that all this occurs some 10 years after the prediction and the young boy hasn't aged a day.) Catherine now emerges as a force to be reckoned with and everyone gets his just deserts. However, a final reconciliation of sorts between Diane and Catherine does occur. Diane is banished from the court and left with nothing of her lover Henri. But, at the last moment, Catherine repents and gives her son a ring that Diane had given to Henri and which Catherine had removed from her husband's finger. She tells her son to give it to Diane. He immediately races to the courtyard just as Diane is about to leave in a horse drawn carriage and gives her the ring. A glance from Diane upwards meets that of Catherine and the unspoken moment says it all. As the coach leaves the confines of the palatial courtyard, Rozsa's music reaches a crescendo pitch as love, death, betrayal, forgiveness, and justice all come together in a rousing climax.

It took some 45 years for the complete score to this movie to be released. Do we have to wait another 45 for a DVD!!?  This is a disgrace! The costumes, the glamour, the storyline, the fine but unrecognized acting, and the emotional impact deserve a better fate than an aged VHS. Warner archive should put this out immediately since it is in the Turner Classic Movie stable.",1356134400,7,4537,4.6458852867830425
519453,3,6302760062,"The most unforgettable element in this average costumer is the extraordinary score by Miklos Rozsa, which ranks among his most magnificent compositions.  The central theme, a lilting melody, is presented with varying segments of the orchestra.  This score reduces the rest of this adequate film to cinders, but such is often the case with this seminal film composer.  A comprehensive two-disc set of the essential score with extensive liner notes is available from Film Score Monthly.  For film score fans, it is frankly a must-own.",1181001600,12,532,5.223529411764706
519454,4,6302760062,"I watched this excellent drama movie on TV, having never heard of it.  As other reviewers have done an excellent job of summarizing the content, I will merely state my reaction.
I'm not a James Bond fan, but I quite liked Roger Moore's performance and character here.  Lana Turner was likeable and glamorous.  I was caught up in the story from the first moment, and watched it rivited, until the end.  This was a period and place in history that I previously knew nothing about.  It was an emotional movie with a very satisfying ending.",1055030400,11,536,4.6
519455,4,6302760062,"Years ago, my friend David had a book about history as told thru Hollywood movies, and that was how I first learned of the movie, ""Diane"".  Seemed a silly movie, advertised by a dueling shot of French prince Roger Moore matching his epee with courtesan Lana Turner in her sixteenth-century Tudor style wimple. Fast forward to 2002, and put us in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where that venerable institution decides that a good movie to link to its current tapestry exhibit would be--yep--""Diane"", of all things. The week before, it had been ""A Man for All Seasons"". Well, I just had to check this out; I mean, I've NEVER even seen it listed in a tv guide. Saw it with Edith just last night.
Not bad! Not a classic, but not bad.
For one thing, the costumes are just wonderful, the creations of Walter Plunkett of ""Gone with the Wind"" fame. No, they're not authentic, but this was a Lana Turner movie, you know, not a BBC documentary. So, if you like gorgeous women in velvet and pearls, this is an appropriate flick for you. Lana is appealing and I didn't really mind Roger Moore, although another reviewer found him wooden. The real Henri II was a weakling--that why he was controlled by his mistress--so that a stronger performance would not really have made sense.
It is in the supporting performances that we have our best people. Sir Cedric Hardwicke is a Nostradamus-kind of astrologer who tells Henri's wife Catherine de Medici to dry her tears over her husband's lack of sexual interest and concentrate on her destiny as future Queen of France. Henry Daniell does a great job as Catherine's advisor who keeps those intrigues coming--always a joy to watch him. The actor playing King Francis I had a lot of bravado and some set of choppers. I liked him a lot.  And the woman playing Catherine was excellent, and actually there is where the film comes off the hinge for me.
Because ultimately, her Catherine wins the sympathy of the viewer away from Lana Turner's Diane. After all, she is the new King's lawful wife, and seems young and inexperienced. Might also be that there was so much publicity years gone by about the Prince Charles-Princess Diana-Camilla Parker-Bowes triangle that viewers of our generation would identify Catherine with the maritally neglected Princess Di. I was glad to see Catherine pounce on her newfound power once the King got mortally wounded, and assert herself finally.
Upshot of the whole experience: ""Diane"" is NOT a silly movie, by no means. You'll get a taste of French monarchal history (albeit a rather small one) that often Americans know nothing about, and see some really outstanding dresses for glamour queen Turner.",1022371200,30,2667,4.7956521739130435

519539,5,6302760062,Remains mostly true to history and brings entertainment and glamour to the screen as well.  Lana Turner should have made more of these historical costume movies as she portrayed her part so very well in this one.  A very young Roger Moore was surprising in his presentation of Henri...at first a bit wooden but later in the film loosened up and was believable.,1384905600,2,360,4.698412698412699
519540,4,6302760062,"It's a Hollywood take at French history, but one of the few movies that cover Diane de Poitiers as the central character. Great cast and lavish production values. A good fifties extravaganza in Technicolor.",1383264000,,206,5.088235294117647
519541,5,6302760062,"Lana Turner is so astute and involving in her portrayal of Diane that you are caught up right off, as she brings you into her life of intrigue, mystery, love, and tragedy.

Lana Turenr always had that way of looking and speaking so that you feel she is speaking and looking at you. She is not a great great actress, but a very good one, vastly underrated. Diane is one her best, along with Peyton Place, Imitation of Life, By Love Possessed, Portrait In Black, Madame X, and The Rains of Ranchipur.

This film is spectacular, in cinemascope, with the evil Marisa Pavan as Catherine De Medici, a startling performance. She had such gifts that were not used!!

Roger More is very fine as are all the cast memembers. Not to be overlooked as it was in the 50s when I saw it first run. Buy this and play it for years. One magnificent scene after another!

The Miklos Roza score is indeed one of his best. Check out too ""Lust For Life"" for Roza greatness.

Note: The credits for ""Diane"" have a crown and draperies beneath it.. it is the same credit backdrop for Grace Kelly's fabulous ""The Swan. MGM was getting cheap.",1380758400,3,1112,4.431372549019608
519542,4,6302760062,"While Ingrid Bergman, Grace Kelly and Eva Marie Saint were putting audiences to sleep with their girl-next-door vibe, Lana Turner was quickening male heartbeats in films during the late 30s into the mid 60s.  In ""Diane"", Turner's great figure does justice to Walter Plunkett's costumes and her acting acumen raises the stature of this soapy endeavor.",1379289600,,350,5.25
519543,5,6302760062,"As always Lana Turner has excelled herself in this movie. The story line is great and the costumes are excellent!! Roger Moore, was also wonderful in his role. I love watching Lana Turner movies. They always have a good story line.",1378684800,,231,4.658536585365853
519544,5,6302760062,"""Diane"" is probably the most unappreciated, under-rated little masterpiece in film history.  I was a college student movie-goer in 1955 when it was released, but not until years later when my Mother happened to mention how good it was, did I hear about it.  Then after 1993 when the Turner Home Video came out I discovered I wasn't the only one that had overlooked it, and no wonder with the inappropriate misleading advertising art such as the official graphics used for this DVD cover instead of a scene in costumes like the VHS version.  Pay no attention to that.  One would think it was a cheesy modern day love affair instead of a lavish historical romance.  Plus, there's the ridiculous teaser comment, ""Lana dares the devil.""  What?  It has nothing to do with the supernatual.  I suspect this unusual promotional blunder occurred during the time of turmoil and foolish change away from the grand and glorious tradition of MGM created by their renowned Studio boss Louis B. Mayer who had been unfortunately ousted.

It was, as others here have noted, Lana's last film for the roaring Lion before she went on to a new fame at Universal.  She gives one of her most gorgeous, impeccable performances, but I must admit Marisa Pavan in the supporting role almost steals the picture from her and should have been at least nominated for an Oscar.  Her portrayal of the ""other woman"" requiring a full spectrum of emotions that fosters both good and bad audience reactions toward her is magnificent!

Also making it definitely worthwhile, as pointed out by other reviewers, are the breathtaking costumes designed by Walter Plunkett of ""Gone With the Wind"" wardrobe fame, and of course the always brilliant Miklos Rozsa music score.  BUT, what really struck me the most are the final few minutes of the movie with an unexpected little added nuance that is so touching it has to be one of the tenderest heart-tugging endings of all time!",1378598400,9,1932,4.818181818181818
519545,5,6302760062,"There was a time, long ago, when MGM was ruling its kingdom in Culver City, California, sparing no expenses when it came to movie business. We have a fine example here, with this 1955 film, the french court of the 16th century had been so lavishly recreated, that you can't believe your eyes...The scenery, the costumes and the music by the great Miklos ROZSA are just perfect. The acting is quite good too, especially the scenes between Lana TURNER and Marisa PAVAN, even if a very young Roger MOORE is far less convincing as king HENRY II. Of course, being french, I noticed some historical mistakes ( I don't think that king FRANCOIS 1st died of  battle wounds) but does it really matter ? This Warner Collection release is a real treat with gorgeous colors, and full stereo sound.....Don't hesitate, you won't be sorry to get this DVD !",1373587200,9,840,4.6375838926174495

7832060,5,6302760062,"In 1956 the public wasn't interested in ''somewhere long ago in france''.  Dory Schary  took over M.G.M. and all the stars in heaven, and then did his best to shoot out all of the stars.  It is no secret that Lana Turner was not a Schary favorite, but he didn't like Clark Gable or Robert Taylor either.  Pushed to make Diane, Turner is spot on in a very long film.  This very photogenic lady puts in a performance in a believable way.  Her sword duel with Roger Moore is delightful.  She is so in to the duel, and she looks so beautiful all through it.  I can understand why the film was not a financial hit at the time.
Lana was capable of more contemporary.  George Cukor got an amazing performance out of Lana in; ''A Life of her Own'' 1950.  She was very well handled here, she could make herself look ugly when the moment required it.  Her famous tet a tet with Ray Milland:  Lana, '' you don't look much like a lawyer, you don't even look like a client''.  Which in a sense is quite funny, and at the same moment not!  The film didn't do well at the box office, as later Diane also didn't do well.  Six years after the 1950 film.  Ironic that it took a family tragedy to make Lana super box office again.  I hope Lana was able to enjoy the fact: she was Lana and no one could take that away.

Buy the film Diane before it fades away and is impossible to find as is ''The Flame and the Flesh''.  1954.  ??  Please trust me here,  Lana could have made, ''Designing Woman''.  Better.  ''North, by Northwest''.  Eva Marie Saint was doing a Turner in her voice and specially the hair. And M.G.M. made the Hitchcock film. Best!  ......................................... Why not believe me and give it a try, before it is gone.

Had Lana Turner lived a little longer I am sure the American Film Institute would have given her a night, and then her work would be preserved for  as long as always lasts.

There are for me two very sad actress artists.  Ladies that were judged mostly for a visual effect.  When the two ladies were working in film they were the top of the hill.  That they overlapped a little bit says nothing but. out with the old etc.  When each lady was at the top, there was no where higher to go.  One of these ladies all but disappeared.  The other lady, swathed in mink became a legend most.  Did some TV and died.  Garbo and Turner.",1477353600,,2355,4.2704545454545455
7832061,3,6302760062,"If you like 1950's films and/or like the actors, you will probably like it.  I watched this because I recently learned about Diane De Poitiers and saw that there was a movie made about her.  Naturally I was curious to see how she was depicted in 1950's cinema.",1467158400,,260,4.395833333333333

7832063,5,6302760062,If you love Lana Turner films and or history like i do this movie is a win win!....Lana is terrific as Diana de Portiers mistress of Henri II Valois of France.....the only thing off about her being cast as Diane is that she is too beautiful to be Diane.  Diane was an average looking woman but she had great fashion sense and style she was almost old enough to be Henri's mother but she was very glamorous and youthful for her age gap with Henri....Henri was married to Catherine de Medici a powerhouse of a queen that was plain in looks but her intelligence and brilliance at handling the reigns of government were unparalleled at this time in French history.  The country was being torn apart by religious wars between the Huguenots (protestants) and the Catholics....she inherited a mess and her sons were poorly equipted to manage on their own as they were weak and easily flattered by powerful men with their own agendas.  The story in this movie has Hollywood taking as usual poetic license to make it more interesting and intriguing that what actually transpired during this time but if it does nothing else it makes the viewer more interested in learning more about this woman and how she was treated more like the actual queen of France than Catherine was when Henri was alive...once he dies in a tragic accident....Catherine gets her time in the sun and Diane is exiled from court.....this film is wonderful and the real women in this film..Diane de Portiers and Catherine de Medici are certainly worth seeking out books to learn more about these fascinating real women of French history.,1447459200,5,1598,4.741007194244604
7832064,2,6302760062,"I have been fascinated by the story of Diane Di Portiers ever since we visited  Chteau de Chenonceau. This film bears very little resemblance to the actual history. What about her two daughters? The chronology is completely distorted. She went to King Francois to plead for her father, not her husband. And she never had a falling out with him. The whole film is overwrought. However, it is a product of the period in which it was made.",1431216000,,436,4.589743589743589
