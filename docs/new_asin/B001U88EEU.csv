8343137,5,B001U88EEU,"Charlie fractures Romance languages, provides goofy , misplaced answers to his own sophmoric questions and laughs inappropriately yet all it does is highlight the contrast between himself and his subjects.

Valentino comes across as an astute and proud fashion genius, a genially sensitive observer  and a charming lifestyle perfectionist. Giancarlo who appears intense, analytical and businesslike is so devoted, in the best sense of the word, to Valentino that he provides the necessary discipline, organizational skills and acumen to turn his partner's creativity into success on an immense scale.
Without Giancarlo , Valentino would have been a notable couture talent. With Giancarlo as helmsman,coordinator, promoter and insulator, Valentino achieves lasting fame, a rock solid following of the luminaries whose admiration and loyalty make him swell with justifiable pride and the means to own and furnish homes of astonishing luxe.
Valentino has gotten all he desired from life, and more, in large part through the love, friendship and unflagging efforts of Giancarlo, a strikingly handsome 70 year old who seems to get his greatest satisfaction from pleasing Valentino the man he so clearly loves and whose appreciation he so deeply desires, needs and generously gets.

Matt Tyrnauer has allowed us to see and feel a modern love so strong  that even the admirable dignity and authentic formality of these  two private  people can't keep it out of sight. With that love Valentino and Giancarlo Giammetti built an empire.
All three men are remarkable individuals whose gifts thankfully survive the ham handed Charlie Rose.",1238630400,10,1627,5.436507936507937
