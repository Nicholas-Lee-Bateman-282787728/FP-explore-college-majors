8468416,4,B005EKWYDC,"I bought this set with some hesitation as I have several WWII series already.  It focuses on about a dozen or so key battles ranging from 'The Battle of Britain,' 'The Battle of the Atlantic' and, of course, Normandy to the invasion of Ethiopia by Italy as well as Franco's takeover of Spain.  There were a lot that I had never heard before and I was surprised at how much I learned.  The only downside was the discs were placed in a case such that they were stacked on top each other with no protection between discs.  This set complements the other big WWII documentaries (Victory At Sea, Crusade In The Pacific, The World At War, etc) and is a good addition for anyone interested in WWII.",1390262400,5,691,4.417322834645669
