6761109,5,B00OU2GO5O,"I'm hoping there is a Season 3. The scenery, brooding atmosphere, criminal activities interwoven with the Inspector's family relationships held my attention. Acting so good it didn't matter that it was in German with English subtitles.",1426032000,9,235,5.555555555555555
6761110,3,B00OU2GO5O,"As rated, ""its Okay"". worth watching, but not exceptional.",1425168000,5,58,5.555555555555555

6761112,4,B00OU2GO5O,Great series! My husband and both enjoyed it.,1454284800,,45,4.75
6761113,5,B00OU2GO5O,Good TV series. Somewhat dark but entertaining. It made me think.,1444780800,2,65,5.0
6761114,4,B00OU2GO5O,ONE OF THE BEST!!,1443744000,,17,3.5
6761115,2,B00OU2GO5O,"This show along with Lindell,  is extremely slow, indeed....boring actually.  I left it to fix dinner, returned, and I hadn't missed a thing.  Don't waste your money.  Not like other Swedish crime shows like Beck and Hamilton, not even intellectually entertaining, alas :(",1443484800,,272,5.255813953488372
6761116,4,B00OU2GO5O,"Liked the first series so much, came back for # 2, and the stories are getting better, I think! Very good German Mystery/Thriller cop show!! Becoming one of my favorites!!!",1441584000,6,172,4.766666666666667
6761117,4,B00OU2GO5O,"Really enjoyed the series, hopefully there will be more available soon to purchase.",1439251200,,83,5.461538461538462
6761118,3,B00OU2GO5O,First series OK but more Miss Marples than 'The Killing'! Second series poor: Interesting wife gone and new woman was like a clingy leech.,1438992000,,138,4.791666666666667
6761119,5,B00OU2GO5O,Great!! Thanks.,1436227200,,15,7.0
6761120,2,B00OU2GO5O,"As far as mysteries go, this was good and kept me guessing. The inspector shows more emotion in Season 2 but is bewildered why his wife, who he hardly sees because of his work, would be getting bored with her life. The nudity was distracting, even full frontal male nudity that wasn't necessary. I should have read the reviews better before buying.",1434672000,,348,4.629032258064516
6761121,5,B00OU2GO5O,Quite interesting German language mystery set in the very lovely town of Visby. If you enjoyed the first series you will also enjoy the second series.,1430697600,5,150,4.8076923076923075
8684838,4,B00OU2GO5O,Walter Sittler stars as Robert Anders - to call him laid-back is an understatement.  He has no personality and not much going for him.  The episodes were written very well.,1518998400,,172,4.7
8684839,3,B00OU2GO5O,"Very mediocre and predictable.  The wife disappears and we really don't know why, then he falls for the amoral impossibly cheerful Emma who has a son whose father may or may not be her ex-husband.  He is supposed to be this great detective, but he lets his 14 yo daughter run all over him, staying away from home with a 24 yo boyfriend.  Incredible and disgusting.",1513382400,,364,4.484848484848484
8684840,5,B00OU2GO5O,Really good!,1500940800,,12,5.5

8684842,5,B00OU2GO5O,Excellent series,1488240000,,16,7.5
8684843,5,B00OU2GO5O,"Being born of German parents, I was excited to find this series on MHz and loved it!  Not only spoken in German which made me feel like I was visiting relatives in Germany, but the subtitles were great for my non-German-speaking husband to follow along.  We LOVE this series!",1469577600,4,275,4.591836734693878
8684844,5,B00OU2GO5O,great,1469059200,,5,5.0
8684845,5,B00OU2GO5O,Very well done. Is there a Season 3?,1456358400,2,36,3.625
8684846,5,B00OU2GO5O,I love the Inspector and the Sea series. Hope they make more.,1455926400,3,61,4.166666666666667
8684847,2,B00OU2GO5O,The first two episodes are ok BUT Episode 3 is not available--which means you're wasting a lot of your time watching Episode 4 because you're wondering why the wife has disappeared and a new actor has replaced one of the key characters etc,1454889600,2,239,4.5813953488372094
