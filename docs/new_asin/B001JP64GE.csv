8313369,4,B001JP64GE,"Dan Vadis leads an army of strong gladiators into a mission that involves kidnapping a queen in this action packed sword and sandal movie. Now this is the rather succinct description given about this movie. Given what this movie is and when and where this movie was made.....it simply is what it is ( I hate that expression but it is true here) we have grainy film, we have bad dubbing we have atrocious acting and the usual fighting style of bopping the opponents over the head or chest and I mean bopping. Now I loved Dan Vadis so much back in the day. He seemed to have so much fun with these movies and It showed. You have to be a fan of these kinds of movies to really appreciate them. I loved them and still do.",1509580800,,717,4.202898550724638
8313370,1,B001JP64GE,This movie was so bad I watched it for 3 minutes.,1479254400,,49,3.5454545454545454
8313371,5,B001JP64GE,all my purchases listed on this page were very good.  All of them was movies I wanted and I am very pleased. Got most of them delivered to me before they were supposed to be shipped out.,1473465600,,186,4.027027027027027
8313372,3,B001JP64GE,"Plenty of action, with a plot that kind of meanders around and doesn't make a whole lot of real sense. Dan Vadis gives a whole new meaning to stoic. He makes granite look expressive by comparison. Still, if you're in the right mood for mindless fun and some sword and sandal fun, this will fill the bill. I liked that it was pretty generic with no specific time (just ""Roman"" era), no emperor names, nothing like that. The 10 gladiators of the title are more like 10 or 11 or 12 depending on whether you count the Roman dude or the woman who hangs with them, but what the heck-- its all in fun anyway.",1470182400,,601,4.234782608695652
8313373,1,B001JP64GE,"I watch one of these movies just to laugh at how bad they are, then get bored after about 15 minutes and stop.",1463184000,,110,3.8260869565217392
8313374,5,B001JP64GE,Very entertaining movie!!,1461024000,,25,7.666666666666667
8313375,4,B001JP64GE,OK,1413417600,,2,2.0
8313376,3,B001JP64GE,"This might be the one that started it all. Browsing at the very last few titles of a genre listed as ""exciting"" I found a number of these relics. OK. OK. It was the picture that prompted me to chose this one. That and of course ""Airplane"". Anyway, it turned out to be an Italian Movie made in the late 50's. I like Italian movies and as the credits began I watched closely, enjoying the black and whiteness of it,the kind of blurry soundtrack, hoping I'd stumbled across an early Morricone effort. Maybe even Fellini when he was second assistant director. It was not to be, but at the end of the credits came an unexpected and presumably camaraderie building pre-movie meet and greet with the smiling ten gladiators. It was worth the laugh I got out of it. After that I turned it off figuring the title pretty much gave away the story. On second thought,if I had watched the whole movie I might have learned what a peplum is. I always thought it was part of a dress, but a gladiator would never wear a dress. Would he?",1402531200,,1018,4.363157894736842
8313377,3,B001JP64GE,the copy of this peplum is unfortunately 16/9 and the quality is poor but it is okay ! it is still a peplum hard to find !,1386633600,,122,3.5555555555555554
