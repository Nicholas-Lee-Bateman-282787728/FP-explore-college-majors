4282893,2,B0047A96LI,"Sometimes wrong, often meaningless, almost always overwrought, the narration is a very big disappointment.  The video is old (or at least looks old) and it is difficult to imagine any basis to recommend this DVD.  This is a waste of time and money.",1395619200,,248,4.744186046511628
4282894,3,B0047A96LI,The film is dated but gave us some good photos from the air.  It gave us a good overview of what was shown but was not complete.,1370736000,3,128,3.740740740740741

8417880,4,B0047A96LI,Very pretty views of D.C. Wish I would have watched it before I went to get orientation of the mall and such. My parents haven't been there so this was a great way for them to experience it.,1490486400,,190,4.026315789473684

8417882,2,B0047A96LI,This video is definitely from the early 1990s. It reminds me of a tourism promotional/highlight reel. Not at all what I thought it would be.,1483056000,,140,4.64
8417883,5,B0047A96LI,This is a terrific overview of Washington DC with great photography and informative narration.  The accompanying music also enhances the overall viewing experience.

8417885,5,B0047A96LI,"This is an older movie. However, we were planning a trip to Washington D.C. and wanted to show the kids a little bit of what they would see. This gave them a great overview with a little bit of information about some of the things there were to see and do while we were there.

I thought the pictures were very nice and showed many of the more famous Washington D.C. sites at their best (with no crowds).
There were some things my children were thinking of skipping but after watching this decided they might like to see after all.

Overall, this is a not very long, beautiful movie that covers many of the more famous sites in Washington. I'd watch it again if I were going to Washington D.C. Enjoy",1449878400,,699,4.32824427480916
