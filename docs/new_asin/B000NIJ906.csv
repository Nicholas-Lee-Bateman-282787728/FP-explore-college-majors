8177930,1,B000NIJ906,"Whoever did the transfer from the original video tape should be shot (or at least fired) - the video on this DVD is seriously washed-out (i.e. no contrast), but that seems to be typical of old Bennett videos that are converted to DVD (no doubt in an effort to milk some extra revenue out of their dated productions). I won't be buying anything from Bennett until they update their catalog to at least something from this century.",1412726400,,429,4.584415584415584
8177931,5,B000NIJ906,Was packaged and arrived as advertised.  Delivery was sooner than stated.  The footage was on a larger boat than I skipper.  I should be able to transfer the skills to our smaller boat.  I wish I could hire that young foredeck man who makes it look so easy for this sixty something grandma!,1357862400,,290,4.415094339622642
8177932,4,B000NIJ906,"There's not a huge number of spinnaker instructional videos online and this one, from Canadian Yachting, is helpful.

It has tips from Tom Whidden an America's Cup sailor (Tactician for Dennis Conner) and some good shots on the water and with model boats and sails that help viewers visualize spinnaker-handling basics and various ways that one can affect the spinnaker's sail shape to meet the windy or light conditions. From the VHF tapes in the video and the old clothes, I'm guessing the video was shot sometime in the late 80s--so, cutting edge, this isn't. Still, it's worth a watch.",1330128000,,589,4.89
