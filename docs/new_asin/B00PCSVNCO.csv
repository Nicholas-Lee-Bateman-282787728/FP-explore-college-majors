6797742,5,B00PCSVNCO,"Kudos to these indie film makers for the authentic guns and costumes, just enough special effects to indicate the blood and gore, music that worked with the story, and a revenge theme with a young woman prevailing over male opponents who underestimated her determination and prowess.  And for a heroine who seemed to feel that having clothes on was less important than getting the job done!",1427760000,12,390,4.909090909090909
6797743,3,B00PCSVNCO,"This film was featured in a recent issue of the magazine Girls and Corpses (which is a fun magazine if you have both a taste for the macabre and a strong stomach).  It looked like it might have promise, so I decided to check it out.  I do like schlock cinema as it's often less pretentious than what comes out of mainstream Hollywood.  Of course, not every exploitation film wins the ""so bad it's good"" label; some are just terrible films.  So is Scalped worth a viewing?  It is a tale of a woman taking revenge on a gang of outlaws who assaulted her and killed her family.  Amanda Elizabeth Sawyer has the lead role; she is an attractive woman but her acting is quite wooden.  Better performances are given by Robert Herrick and Tony Venture as two of the outlaws.  Overall, I would say that Scalped is not utter trash but it misses the guilty pleasure mark as well.  As exploitation films go, this one is an optional purchase.",1424217600,8,928,4.411764705882353

8687499,3,B00PCSVNCO,"It's a local Indie film, so check your big-studio expectations at the door.  The leading actress (Elizabeth Sawyer) does a fair job (the typical white-girl-as-Native-American casting) and was brave enough to do the nude scenes (an extended one where she is staked out on the ground as a victim of bandits and another one near the end of the movie where she baths in a river as symbolism of washing the evil from her soul).  She's cute and delivers her lines well enough.  The other actors are your typical community-theater type quality; certainly nothing to write home about. If the camerawork had been better and the dialogue and editing sharper, this could have been a cult classic some day.  Instead, it will get lost in the whitewater of other low-budget Indie films.  The plot is pretty basic and tells a good story, but really needs characters that are less stereotypical and more engaging.",1439251200,5,897,4.836601307189542
8687500,1,B00PCSVNCO,This is one of the very few movies (and I watch a lot of movies) that I actually stopped watching before it got to the end. It was just too dumb (borderline painful) to watch. Hate I wasted the money renting this.,1438992000,,213,4.095238095238095
