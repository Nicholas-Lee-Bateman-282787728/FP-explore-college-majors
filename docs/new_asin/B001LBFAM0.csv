8411834,5,B001LBFAM0,"I noticed that during playing this disk after 36th minute part of recording is deleted for 40 seconds, then sound appears again and continues OK. Any factory defect?

Oddly, this blu-ray is easily played on standard dvd-rw device not blu-ray. Don't understand how it can be. I checked few of disks released by Surround Records which I have, on different dvd-devices and they all are playable. And all of their blu-rays Classics are not bigger than volume of DVD9 (~6-8 Gb).",1234915200,4,473,4.839506172839506

DTS-HD sound is state-of-the-art, with remarkable clarity and presence it reveals greate ambience and convincing spatial transparency. The sound is absolutely ideal, with especially keen definition to the strings.",1233964800,5,523,5.986666666666666
