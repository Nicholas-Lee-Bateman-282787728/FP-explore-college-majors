7889514,5,6305458707,"Ivan the Terrible Parts I & II is an excellent film from Sergei M. Eisenstein.  It is a ""talkie"" but it still retains the exaggerated facial expressions and clear camera shots of the silent area which allows a non-Russian speaker to understand what is going on.

There is excellent camera work, excellent cinematography, and excellent music.  There is also the peculiar Soviet trait of having some scenes in black and white and some in color during Part II.",1438214400,,457,4.833333333333333

7889516,5,6305458707,"DVD quality is excellent -- back cover text is Korean, but English subtitles are available and high quality (good grammar, good spelling).  This would be excellent for a large screen.",1407888000,5,183,5.1
7889517,5,6305458707,"I last saw these films back when they were first released in US theaters (a very long time ago!) and seeing them again not only revived original memories but confirmed the thrill of their greatness.  For me, the most memorable are the scenes of non-verbal communication conveyed by extended close-ups of chilling facial expressions on friend and foe alike.  For any fans of the opera, Boris Godunov, this is the prologue; many familiar characters and events are here or mentioned in the dialogue.  The transfer is excellent and the final, experimental color scenes, are fascinating.  The history is sometimes blurred but the acting and cinematography are powerful, the former led by Cherkasov who was also Eisenstein's Alexander Nevsky.  Both Nevsky and Battleship Potemkin have received remastering and a modern re-recording of the musical score for video release, something I regret has not and probably will not be done for Ivan.  Nevertheless, this remains a cinematic masterpiece.",1404777600,,985,5.282051282051282
7889518,5,6305458707,"Sergei Eisenstein's two films about this infamous Russian czar are impressive even by modern standards.  I saw the films for the first time in high school in a film class and never forgot them.  If you appreciate old foreign films, you will love this set.",1376352000,2,255,4.644444444444445
7889519,5,6305458707,One of my favorite films.  The cinematography is incredible.  Eisenstein was a brilliant film maker.  The acting and actors are so expressive and moving.  Absolutely delighted with the quality of the film.,1358640000,,205,5.3125
7889520,2,6305458707,"By the time he made ""Ivan the Terrible"" Eisenstein had moved from employing film montage juxtapositions to creating juxtapositions within the frame so the feel of the movie is very different from his early films. Between that change in style and the high contract lighting and the overwrought pantomime acting style, ""Ivan"" looks almost like a parody of an early silent film - despite being a talkie. Add to that the mostly static framing, the majestic but often sparsely furnished sets, the elegant and sometimes extreme looking costumes and hair and I was often reminded of nothing so much as the old Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon serials I watched on television as a kid - but with Ming the Merciless as the hero - and without much of the action.

Not unrewarding, but not the Eisenstein I would recommend.",1322697600,3,808,4.771428571428571
7889521,5,6305458707,"This is the two films Ivan the Tterrible I, II.  A good transfer.  It's nice to have it available -- I saw it about 50 years ago and am glad to be able to get it.",1296691200,2,162,3.4722222222222223
7889522,4,6305458707,"Joseph Stalin was a smart old monster, and when he saw the second part of Sergei Eisenstein's ""Ivan the Terrible"" he must have thought: ""Hm, paranoia ... secret police ... pogroms ... you don't suppose ...?"" He had the film confiscated, and it was not shown publicly until 1958, five years after the great dictator's death and ten years after the great director's. Part I of the epic had pleased the man of steel, but in that film Ivan is presented as an idealist who wants to make Russia a world power and must fight corrupt Boyars to achieve his noble aims. A planned Part III was never accomplished, and one can only wonder how the Kremlin would have dealt with it: after the age of 40 Ivan IV became increasingly erratic, killing his own son in a fit of pique. As long as Eisenstein's spectacle depicted the Tsar agonizing over Mother Russia everything was fine; but once the mock trials and mass executions began, the 16th Century began looking suspiciously contemporary. (In one scene, Ivan is shown sending an envoy to Elizabeth I of England, who must have thought of Ivan the way FDR thought of Stalin.) The movie's plot is a somewhat fictionalized account of Ivan's struggle with an ambitious aunt and his forming of the oprichnina, a protective cadre of husky young men. Behind all this, according to Eisenstein's biographers, was a difficult relationship with his mother and his sexual frustration. I think ""Ivan the Terrible"" is one of the most fascinating films ever made, but I have to be honest: it takes a little getting use to. The sets and costumes are extremely ornate, sometimes quite bizarre; and Prokofiev's glamorous score seems slightly disassociated from the action. But strangest of all is the acting, which must have baffled Eisenstein's admirers, remembering the almost documentary style of 1925's ""The Battleship Potemkin"". Eisenstein had been directing a production of ""Die Walkre"" at the Bolshoi, and the acting in ""Ivan"" is blatantly operatic: silent-screen swooning and bug-eyed staring. All this can bewilder you or bewitch you. With me, it's the latter, which is why I'm glad that Home Vision's new video is such an improvement over the old cassette I had. The visuals are crisp and clear, showing Edward Tiss's classic, carefully-composed black-and-white frames at their elegant best. Much has been written regarding the quality of the color in the frenetic, joyless banquet sequence. Granted, this is not exactly a Fox musical; but I find the effects striking, especially when poor Vladimir literally turns green. And you can READ the subtitles because they have been electronically enhanced. The translation also seems to have been improved, making situations and relationships easier to understand. A single typo (""fiend"" for ""friend"") can be forgiven. Altogether, this is a superior presentation of an artistic work that is demanding but ultimately rewarding.",974332800,,2899,5.066945606694561
