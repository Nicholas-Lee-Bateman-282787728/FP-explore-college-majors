5891651,4,B00E5PHTR8,"Issues of anonymous hook-ups, love, trust, deceptions and danger are central in the thriller ""Solo"" (""Alone"").  After flirting online for some time, Manuel finally decides to take a chance and meet Julio, who has been suspiciously firm about not sharing photos or personal information.  The chemistry is there from the start, and Manuel gradually opens up to Julio, explaining about a previous relationship that did not end well, leaving some emotional scars.  Julio pledges complete honesty and shares Manuel's distaste for guys who try to manipulate others into sex.  It becomes clear that Manuel's suspicions are not completely satisfied, especially when Julio becomes somewhat aggressive when Manuel tries to take things slow.

The low budget is obvious in the limited cast and direction, which takes place mostly in Manuel's apartment, while the plot is developed through his repetitive flashbacks to earlier events.  The actors are attractive and capable, but have little to challenge them (or engage viewers) except for the final 15 minutes or so of this somewhat short (80 minute) film.  The direction in which the director takes the film is somewhat creative and unexpected. In Spanish with English subtitles, this would have rated an R for nudity (no frontal) and scenes of violence.  I give it four stars out of five.",1385337600,3,1328,5.2018779342723
5891652,4,B00E5PHTR8,"This is gay but it is really a thriller from Argentina, as mentioned in my lack lustre title. We meet the rather dashing Manuel who has been on an online dating chat room. And it is just a pick up site. Well he gets `chatting' to Julio and they agree to meet despite Julio having no on line profile. Then he brings him back and after a lot of pauses and describing how they have been hurt by selfish lovers before in their lives, they finally go for the action bits.

After the bedroom `eurhythmics', they decide they must be in love and are going to run away together, very romantically by coach. However, Julio seems to have far too much interest in Manuel's savings account and security arrangements than would be seen as normal and soon we all start to realise that something very wrong is going on.

To say anymore would be a plot spoiler and there is a fair bit more of the story so please do not be put off. This is a small budget film and most of the action takes place in Manuel's flat. The beginning is a bit on the slow side too and might have been done to build emotion, empathy or tension, but for me it did drag a bit. The good news is that once it does start to get moving it does so very fast and it did have me surprised.

It is not a long film either at 80 minutes but for the reasons mentioned above it felt longer. It is in Spanish with good sub titles. The cast are very good indeed, and we do have some frontal nudity but very fleeting, there is some bedroom encounters too but that is not the raison d'tre of this film, it is first and foremost a thriller. I wanted to give this 3 stars but it is probably 3.5 so am rounding it up as I thought the ending was done in a very good way indeed.",1380499200,26,1713,4.062130177514793

5891654,1,B00E5PHTR8,"If you want to watch a movie with gay romance and relationship, stay away from this one!  I DO NOT UNDERSTAND these producers, that think they are so clever, to kill off one of the 2 main characters in a relationship.  I have seen so many gay movies now, where one of the two involved dies.  What sick minds?  Producers of these movies think they are brilliant, creative, inventive, ingenious, yet at the end, they lack the creativity to bring a good ending, so they decide to kill off one of the 2 main characthers.  So you spend an hour, an hour and a half, watching a relationship take form, and build, and think, maybe something positive will come out of this, but only at the end, you experience a brutal murder.  Brilliant, right?  Aint it worth an academy award?  I mean come on, why else would you watch a gay romance movie?  I would feel easier watching Cape Fear, or the Shooter, because then, at least I know i am getting the real thing.  So you kill off one of the 2 main characters at the end.  Wow, I am so impressed.  One Star.  I would give it Zero stars if it was on the grading scale.  I said this in other reviews, and I will say it again, that I am so sick and tired of seeing a gay romance movie, where one of the 2 main characters dies at the end, and it seems always to be a brutal murder, and for what?  You spend so much time building a relationship, then in the last 5 minutes, out comes the weapon and woosh, caput!  A movie such as this, such as so many gay romance movies, insults my intellegence.

I suppose in a way, it's a thriller, yes, but save the internet, it kind of sets gay dating back 30 years.  I wouldn't have felt safe in the presence of either one of them. And even though both men are attractive, given the information that was coming from both of them, I would have been out the door a long time ago. So, in some ways, there is a lesson in this ""thriller"", a person has to be careful who one meets, and one shouldn't just meet, and or trust, or take home or even go home with just anyone one meets ... anywhere, much less on line.",1431734400,,688,4.165413533834586

5891664,1,B00E5PHTR8,"Two gay men meet in a chatroom online and have a passionate night but the creepiness starts when they start planning their relationship. The main character (clean shaven guy) opens up about his abusive relationship. It appears that he has serious baggage and viewers see his ""story"" in a series of flashbacks. We know nothing about the other guy (tattooed scruffy guy) so we assume he has a mysterious past and the clean shaven might be in trouble. Most of the film has dialogue that tests each person and the viewer cannot detect the true intentions of each characters. It does seem suspicious that after a one night stand they start planning their relationship by ditching town together with ""clean shaven"" guy's ex-boyfriend's bag of $100,000. We just assume tattooed guy is going to steal the money and run.  The climax is very postmodern with a completely unexpected plot twist.  Without providing a spoiler, the film's end is extremely disturbing. What a major disappointment. As the film's credits were rolling, all I could think is how this film warns us of the dangers of meeting anyone online.

As the story unfolds a certain suspense ignites the full attention of the viewer. The story is not Hitchcock-style, although there are a few similarities. A first sign of suspicion should have been realized by the viewer, when the director included the scene at the bank. However, this scene is quickly masked over as the dialogue flows between the two players; their movements seem to become fluid as each character dances around each other attempting to find answers to unasked questions.

5891673,1,B00E5PHTR8,"This is my first review on Amazon, motivated by watching a truly terrible film. It really may be the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. The trailer is very deceptive. This barely qualifies as a thriller--the creepy music that occasionally plays makes a viewer think something is going on, only to descend back into banal dialogue. The only thriller-esque aspect of the movie is the ending--and by the way, the ""twist"" ending is really poorly executed. There is really nothing redeeming about this film--the acting is not good, the film quality is poor (the trailer somehow makes that look better too), the script is atrocious, the directing and editing are horrible (there are long shots that seem to be straining to be artistic where the camera is focused on the character Juan smoking a cigarette on a couch for 40 seconds and an endless ""dream sequence"" of water--but they're really bad). If you were taken in by the two attractive men thinking this would be a steamy film, that's also false advertising. The guys are attractive, and there are numerous scenes that attempt to be sexy--but the actors are clearly not experienced, and the director clearly didn't give them enough direction, because it comes off as the most awkward making out and sex I have ever seen on camera. I highly recommend that you save yourself the $5 rental fee. I wish I had my money back. More importantly, I wish I had my time back.",1416787200,,1419,4.7028112449799195

I liked Solo, I read a hand full of reviews and decided to give it a try and am glad I did because as soon as I thought I figured it all out I was pleasantly surprised by the ending. It def caught me off guard and that was a good thing, especially considering the behavior of the one guy from the get go.  I will say that my only complaint was the lack of chemistry and believability in the sex scenes with that two main actors....there just was none!  In the flashback sequence the young man and the older man looked more into each other than the main characters, other than that no real complaints.

When the subtitles started I thought there would be no way I would be able to follow the movie and the plot though after the two main characters met I quickly caught on.

5891680,1,B00E5PHTR8,"Solo is one of the movies where nothing really happens for first 90% of the movie. Then, in the last 10%, the writer/director attempts to throw a neck-bending twist. It rarely works, and in this movie the twist is more insipid than inspired, more ""oh brother,"" than ""oh wow!""

Basically (and the movie is pretty basic) Solo tells the story of two young men who meet, talk, have sex in awkwardly choreographed positions that don't look very sexual, talk more, argue, fall in love, argue, awkward sex ... and well you get the point. Interspersed are a handful of flashbacks that are meant to flesh out a story that is already pretty darn slim.

The acting and the actions are all pretty stilted and as they movie beats along pretty slowly you begin to get think that things are going to end badly.

And they do end badly.

5891685,4,B00E5PHTR8,"(see upbeat UPDATE at end after second viewing)

I loved the first part of this movie because it was very well written and acted, but the sexual attraction between Julio and Miguel was completely unconvincing.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Weekend/dp/B0083V2VYG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Weekend</a>&nbsp;is much better in that regard (and in every other way too - there are too many superficial similarities to avoid comparing the two movies).

Julio and Miguel were naked a lot, and the two actors are very, very attractive as individuals, but I never believed in them as a couple. The dialog was sexy, but the physical interaction between them was so tightly choreographed that it was more like ballet than sex. I found myself wishing for more talk and less sex, which is a first. Their conversations were fascinating; their sex was cold and phony.

The story was pretty stupid, especially when it turned psycho at the end, but no more so than classic psycho thrillers like Psycho - realism is not a hallmark of the genre.

For acting and intelligent dialog, Solo is a definite winner. I'm amazed that this is the only feature-length film either actor has made so far; they're both extraordinarily good looking and talented. But the story is overwrought, the sex unbelievable, and the ending tiresome and very predictable.

UPDATE: I watched it again and liked it much more the second time. Knowing the ending makes me appreciate the writing even more than I already did. It is very intelligent and cleverly constructed. The sex is still unbelievable and cold, but everything else is really good. I'm adding another star.",1405036800,5,1670,5.3106060606060606
5891686,3,B00E5PHTR8,"In the beginning, I thought this was going to be a decent production seeing as how there were subtitles for the song in the beginning; something that is rarely seen in subtitled films. Then, it just turned creepy. What kind of guy says he will not meet another (online dating) guy who does not have a profile picture, turns around and does meet him, (immaturely) tells the stranger he is in love with him and then strings him along with psychological mind games?

Just as the viewer's mind is convinced, after minutes (that seem like hours) of boring, go nowhere, dialog to not trust the stranger, we are literally hit over the head with what other reviewers here call the bizarre plot twist; but you can really see it coming if you put all the flashbacks together (as the film does toward the ending just to make it crystal clear to the viewer).

The drama and suspense here is that most would be careful to invite a stranger into their home for fear that, not knowing anything whatsoever about him, he may rob or even kill you. Derangement is in the eye of the beholder. This film is a great reminder of why people should exercise caution when using online dating!

Four stars for the suspense, but minus 1 star for making us suffer through the pain and agony of the stupid, dysfunctional and boring dialog in the beginning before getting to the point where we even care for either of the characters.

Sad that subtitles were NOT created for the ending song; the song during the final scene that runs *after* the final credits.

As they probe one another before and after interludes of love making, conflicts involving trust and sincerity -- and feelings of dire inadequacy on the part of the ostensibly more aggressive young man -- slowly surface, and we begin wondering whether the two amorous protagonists are actually mature enough to settle down as adults and face the harsh realities of life together.  So far, so good!

Then comes the macabre ""surprise ending"" -- a death-dealing bolt from the blue in the form of a totally unexpected, mercilessly heartbreaking twist of plot (twist of conscience, actually, on the part of the ghoulish writer), which filled me with such loathsome disgust, I wound up destroying the DVD and retiring to bed sick to my very soul.

The script cautions against the temptation of online ""dating"" (code for hooking up with random strangers).",1392336000,3,701,4.9491525423728815
5891711,4,B00E5PHTR8,This film is a delight for any viewer who is a fan of Hitchcock films. The very clever plot and excellent performances by the actors create scene after scene of almost unbearable suspense. A superb script brought to life by two young but very capable actors who know how to generate tension in the viewer.,1392163200,12,305,4.5636363636363635
5891712,4,B00E5PHTR8,"This movie is about two men who meet in a chat room, and then meet in person.  The dialogue is all about trust, and within and around all the sex is a discussion about being honest and appreciating honesty.  Plans are made to escape from everything...to catch a plane (or a bus) to new opportunities.  The ending was quite a surprise.  This movie is in Spanish with subtitles.",1392076800,7,376,4.485294117647059
5891713,5,B00E5PHTR8,"Well thought out and elegantly paced, with a couple of handsome male eye candy. Loved the unabashed sexuality. Keep watching after the credits - you get a suprise ending!",1391904000,5,170,4.896551724137931
5891714,5,B00E5PHTR8,I did not review any into about this movie before I watched it and was totally surprised at the end.  Interesting twist!,1391644800,,120,4.454545454545454

5891717,2,B00E5PHTR8,"Interesting and full of surprises especially towards the end, but not a favorite of mine.  Challenges the imagination and not predictable.",1390953600,3,138,5.571428571428571
5891718,5,B00E5PHTR8,"I was surprise how good this movie was. You will never guess the end of the  movie. The only thing I didn't like is that it had english subs. I rather not read and watch a film at the same time. lol Well written, acted and made. I could see this film being main stream.",1390521600,,269,3.890909090909091
5891719,4,B00E5PHTR8,"Eye candy--check. Sex scenes (though not porno sex)--check. Gay romance--check. Just when you think you've found the typical pleasant, sexy, gay movie, things take a turn--actually several turns. This film is worth watching as a gay relationship movie (to a point), but even more so as a psychological thriller, which at root it is. The lead actors are wonderful to watch in every way, and the new actor Mario Ver&oacute;n, in his second film, is a real find. Let's hope we see much more of him in the future. Catch him also in Sexual Tension: Volatile, where he plays a sexy tattoo artist.",1390003200,2,590,4.737864077669903
5891720,1,B00E5PHTR8,"The film began as though the storyline would make sense.  Slowly the script began to lose its direction.  The stars of the film (two guys)  met each other for the first time and during that first date, they claimed to be in love and were making plans to run away the next day with each other to another country.  How silly!

The masculine guy who was at the house of his new chat room friend began to behave oddly and aggressively.  The other guy, during the beginning of the film was cast to be timid and delicate.  He was cast to show fear when the aggressive guy made verbal demands bordering on threats.  The guy would not leave after repeatedly being asked to leave.

Suddenly, the story changed direction and for no logical reason, the delicate guy took a hammer and began hitting the masculine guy repeatedly.  Instead of fighting back the attack as any normal person would do, the masculine guy simply allowed the delicate guy to continue hitting him with the hammer, all the while making no attempt to stop the attack.

I gave the film one star because the acting was good.  It is the story and plot that make no sense.

As I said above, what a disappointing film.  Dont waste your money.",1388793600,6,1197,4.456221198156682
5891721,4,B00E5PHTR8,"Ok, I'd like to give this film a 5 rating, but it just didn't end the way I wanted. On many levels, it's excellent. The twist in the tale and the way the directors keeps you suspended make for real entertainment. However, us Americans are spoiled with happy, unrealistic, Hollywood endings. The cast is attractive enough, in fact, the Julio character is ""drop dead"" gorgegous ! I'd buy another film he's in just for that reason alone.

As I've said before, there's a lot of crap promoted and sold here. This film is worth every penny...buy it, rent it, or steal it !",1385942400,3,566,4.495145631067961

You seldomly see good gay suspense films with a good plot, acting, and full frontal nudity (a major plus!) that will hold you and keep you on the edge of your seat!!!  I wish there could be more films like this.  I love it and will recommend it too many of my friends and straight people alike. Oh, did I mentioned there is a twist to this film?
