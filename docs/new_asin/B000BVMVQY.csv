8093132,5,B000BVMVQY,The entire family watches the dvd series and more than once. The shows have  a storyline each time and the every day becomes so entertaining when seen through the eyes of  a  Canadian and the Chicago attitudes are something that make us homesick but we love watching these and appreciate the fact all age groups can enjoy them and do it as a family time,1365897600,,353,4.4
8093133,3,B000BVMVQY,Season one of the four pack was missing the two-hour pilot;the contrast in almost all the episodes was very dark.,1346630400,,113,4.7
8093134,5,B000BVMVQY,"We loved this shoed sadly it went off the air. I wish they would bring ne good shows are even this one in todays time but same them.

8093135,4,B000BVMVQY,"Well my order finally arrived after some hassels.  I will not ever buy from this company again!  They advertised the product as ""Due South"" a 4 pack, including Seasons 1,2,3 plus the final season.  I received ""Due South"" Seasons 1,2 & 3 only; a total of 3 Seasons on 11 DVD's.  I'm okay without the final season, because we didn't like it anyhow; but boy, what bad marketing and selling.  You will be unhappy with the Canadian Company, ""We Are The Big Deal.""  It was also advertised as ""new"" but there was no new packaging.  I haven't watched any of the DVD's yet so I hope I will not be more disappointed.

8093137,5,B000BVMVQY,"We just love Due South.  rented it from netflix and then just bought it to share with friends and family.  totally tongue in cheek with real cop action.  lots of chases, blow ups, shoot outs, which always end silly.  and paul gross is very pretty to look at.  (he is currently in the horrible tv show EASTWICK, where he is a handsome devil).  originally we loved him in the canadian show SLINGS AND ARROWS  on netflix you cannot get the final (4th) season which was produced in canada.  funny, funny show.  and nice.  it is exciting and entertaining without being mean spirited.  did i mention that paul gross is really, really pretty?",1254441600,5,635,4.580357142857143
